        Hey everyone, I hope this group continues to grow as I would really like
        to see this method become mainstream one day in the future, assuming is
        has the potential of course. Here is how I have learned what I know of
        ZB so far. It has worked for me, but I don&#x27;t know if it is the best
        way. I would like this thread to be a discussion of the most efficient
        way to learn ZB. I guess this of course assumes you already know all of
        OLL and PLL. Or at the very very least all of PLL. Very first
        beginnings: I guess at the very start I learned the COLL algs before
        anything else. COLL recognition is such a core part of ZBLL recognition,
        that I think it is very important to learn these very early on. Moving
        on: After COLL I moved on to ZBF2L algs. I was basing off Macky&#x27;s
        quote that &quot;It&#x27;s all about F2L&quot; and I think for ZB it
        will most definitely be true that &quot;It&#x27;s all about ZBF2L&quot;
        in terms of whether a solve is a good solve or not. I&#x27;ve known the
        ZBF2L algs now for 8 months and I am starting to see the intuition on
        all but the most obscure cases. I think my ZBF2L is fairly fast, though
        still needs lots of improvement, and is probably only about 2 seconds
        slower than my Fridrich F2L, and on a good ZB average (sub-17) probably
        only 1 second or less. Moving on from ZBF2L: Ok so I saved ZBLL for last
        since it is so ridiculously huge. I am learning this by orientation
        cases with COLL cases as subgroups within an orientation case. I like
        this way since you can practice the algs by learning the transformation
        algs from your unknown OLL case into a known OLL case. I think this aids
        with learning, but is probably not the most optimal way for maximizing
        your speed while learning. I think optimally you should take your
        slowest COLL case and learn all the ZBLL algs for it. Then move on to
        your next slowest, until you know all 40 COLL cases. --------- Side
        notes: I think OLL, although not necessary for true ZB, should be
        required for learning ZB. I&#x27;ve found that sometimes I can use a
        multislotting trick to solve the 3rd and 4th corner edge pair very
        quickly and save a second or two. In this situation I would much rather
        do that, then end with OLL and PLL than to solve the 3rd pair only, then
        hope for a good ZBF2L for the 4th pair, then hope for a ZBLL case that
        you know. I think when you know 100% ZBLL this might also still be fast,
        assuming you have a well refined OLL/PLL combo. ---------------- I have
        no idea if this is the most efficient way, but I like the ability to
        know just based on orientation whether or not I know a case. For example
        if I see the T orientation I know immediately that I can do ZBLL. If I
        see the &quot;L&quot; I know I don&#x27;t know any algs for it and would
        just use COLL/PLL. I think having your ZBLL algs spread out over
        different OLL cases by learning your slowest COLL case would probably be
        faster in the long run, but would take my skill with recognition when
        first starting with ZBLL. Also I think COLL/PLL is a bad idea for COLL
        cases you don&#x27;t know. It can be fast, and the 1/12 PLL skip is
        nice, but some of the algs are so horribly slow for COLL. I think maybe
        using only fast COLL cases would be the best idea. The rest of the time
        you could just do OLL/PLL. Anyone have any opinions here?
        ---------------- Let&#x27;s try to figure out the best way to learn this
        method. I really don&#x27;t feel that the number of ZBLL algs is too
        many, even for recognition. However, in terms of learning them I think
        there must be better ways to approach it than others. Chris

      <div class="email-content">
        More posts here, I&#x27;m trying to start as many discussion threads as
        I can. When I first started learning ZBF2L, my first jump into ZB algs,
        I felt overwhelmed at first on how to learn them. Pretty quickly though
        I adopted a technique that worked very well for me, and let me average
        almost 2.5 algs per day. Within each ZBF2L case there are 8 edge cases
        (fewer for nicely symmetric F2L cases). Here is how you can approach an
        F2L case (all 8 subcases) and learn them in three days or less and
        average 2.5-4 algs per day for learning. Day 1: Look at all 8 algs for
        your chosen F2L case. Do them over an over again on your cube.
        Don&#x27;t just do the alg, but set up with the inverse of the solving
        alg so each time you see the case the algs solves. Concentrate today
        only on how to differentiate each case from the other 7. Give them
        names, or associate them with a picture. Just be able to know how to
        &quot;see&quot; each case today. Try to setup and solve each alg 20
        times or so. Day 2: Again try to do each alg about 20 times by setting
        it up and then solving it. Today though, focus on memorizing the first
        2-3 moves of each alg. You should already comfortably be able to
        diffentiate them, now just associate with each case the first say 2
        moves of the alg to solve it. Remember to do each alg 20 times at least
        though still. Day 3: Still do each alg 20 times each at least, but now
        focus on each alg individually and associate with your already memorized
        first 2-3 moves with the rest of the alg. So once you have done the
        first 2-3 moves you will be able to recall the rest of the alg. After
        having done each case at least 60 times already this is easier than it
        sounds. Now you know all 8 cases fairly solidly within 3 days (sometimes
        2). That&#x27;s a 2.5 algs per day rate. You will be able to recall the
        algs on a speedsolve but you might delay up to 10-20 seconds or more to
        recall it. You will, however, retain all 8. After 2-3 weeks you will
        recognize each case fairly quickly in a speedsolve with minimal delay.
        After 1 month on average for me, I could recognize all 8 cases within an
        F2L case extremely smoothly with hardly any delay other than the
        occasional amnesia. Chris

        I like your idea about spreading the learning out over several days, but
        in practice, I&#x27;ve found I retain algs better if I learn only a few
        at a time, and practice them until they&#x27;re second nature. I have a
        few algs from some COLL cases I&#x27;ve learned, and one ZBF2L case
        I&#x27;ve learned where I&#x27;m getting major amnesia, to the point
        that I&#x27;m going to go back, re-work them out with paper, and
        memorize the night away as soon as I&#x27;m done on this post. They are
        all from days where I learned several algs and practiced all of them.
        When I learn an alg, regardless of how many or few others I&#x27;ve
        learned recently, I always practice it. Generally, about a dozen or so
        times, just to get the feel of it, and at least two averages worth after
        that. The next day or so, I do the same. This usually works well for me,
        but for those few cases where I attempted to learn several at a time,
        I&#x27;m starting to get major amnesia anyhow. Your mileage may vary,
        though. Maybe I&#x27;m just a slow learner. ;) -Mike

        It took me 5 months to learn the T orientaton, but I think an entire
        orientatiton can be learned in 4.5 months as you get further into ZBLL
        learning. How I do it is this. For each ZBLL case I use ACube to find
        algs in the metrics I like. I usually search for quarter turn optimal
        algs in the [RUL] group or [RUF] group first. I have ACube display all
        algs, not just optimal cases. Then I have ACube search for all algs with
        all available moves and I have it display all algs found, not just
        optimal cases. Then I sift through the huge lists of algs to find the
        good ones (most are easily recognizable as horrible algs for
        speedcubing). I then get down to 2-3 algs that are very nice. I then use
        Netcube to time each alg. I don&#x27;t memorize the algs I just read
        them off and time my execution of each one. After 20-30 repeitions you
        can do each of the 2-3 algs without reading off the ACube printout since
        they are in very short term memory. Play with each alg and find the one
        that seems to be the fastest. Now that you have chosen an alg, do it
        30-40 more times and time each trial with ACube. By this point it is
        fairly well in your short term memory. Then before you go to bed do the
        alg a few times again and by then you will have it memorized fairly well
        and can use it in speedsolves. It usually takes ACube a day to a day and
        a half to find algs, then I spend either the second half day or full day
        trying to find the best alg and learn it. So for ZBLL I average about 2
        days per alg. For you guys learning from either my or Dan&#x27;s site I
        imagine you can learn faster since you can skip the alg searching phase.
        I&#x27;ve found that often I really dislike the Bernard Helmstetter
        algs, so I will continue to generate all of mine with ACube. If anyone
        is interested I can post the results for each case, or at least the algs
        that I sift through to be the best ones. I don&#x27;t have the files for
        most of the T cases, but I do for the last 1 or 2 COLL cases as well as
        all the U cases I know so far. Let me know if you&#x27;re interested in
        this fairly good algs. People have different styles, so I may have
        weeded out an alg that you would have kept though, so these lists might
        still not be optimal for your hands. Chris

        My approach to learning COLL was similar to your approach of learning
        ZBF2L, but a little different. I learned COLL in about 13 days, so it
        was just about 3 algs per day. This is what I did: Day 1: Learn how to
        perform/finger trick every alg of a given orientation. For example, all
        6 of the &quot;T&quot; orientation. Don&#x27;t worry about what they
        look like, just keep on performing them over and over so your hands know
        how to do it. Day 2: Decide how you want to recognize that case and
        spend the entire day distinguishing between each case and associating
        each alg to their respective cases. **Note: I learned COLL over the
        summer. Even though I was working, I had no schoolwork and could devote
        several hours per day to learn algorithms. ~ Bob --- In

        What is the best way to do this? I&#x27;ve found that long periods of

        Well, of course, since PLL is involved in ZB, it is only the OLL that
        you would have to worry about forgetting. However, I am sure you have
        known the OLLs long enough now that you probably won&#x27;t ever forget
        them, even if you never practice them again. Since there is less to look
        for in OLL than ZBLL, your recognition should be fast in comparision. I
        think start/stop is the best approach. I think my approach will probably
        be to start ZB and then not stop ZB except for competitions. Even then,
        though, I think I want to only practice Fridrich at the competition,
        since I plan on eventually abandoning it (unless I decide ZB will be
        slower than Fridrich for me). I am looking at the big picture: 2-4 weeks
        of stopping ZB to practice Fridrich means that it will take me an extra
        2-4 weeks to learn ZB. Multiply this time by every competition (and you
        know I go to a lot of them) and it will add a significant amount of
        learning time. I am not sure of this yet because I am not in this
        situation yet, but this is my plan as of now. ~ Bob --- In

        Hi guys, For a while I had been debating on what the best way to learn
        ZB would be; if it would be better to learn ZBF2L then ZBLL, or learn
        ZBLL then ZBF2L. I think I&#x27;ve come up with a pretty good way to do
        both though, and I&#x27;m going to try using it from now on. I know
        about 40 ZBF2L algs so far. Going by Chris&#x27; ZBF2L page, I know all
        of cases 1, 2, 3, 5, and 13 (including reflections). I can convert any
        case that I don&#x27;t know into case 1 or 13 very easily, and the ones
        that aren&#x27;t easy to convert I know the ZBF2L cases for (excluding
        case 4, which I&#x27;ll learn next). So, I can use ZBF2L on every solve
        without too much extra effort. I feel I can use this to my advantage to
        start working on ZBLL now. It seems pointless to start ZBLL without
        knowing any of ZBF2L, but if I can use ZBF2L on every solve even without
        knowing that many cases, then why not start learning ZBLL? At the same
        time though, I don&#x27;t want to completely abandon learning ZBF2L
        algs. So here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve decided to do. For ZBF2L, I&#x27;m
        going to use Chris&#x27; technique of spreading each case out over a
        three day time span and learning them all on the third day. At the same
        time though, I will try and learn one ZBLL each day. So, for
        approximately every 8 ZBF2L algs, I will learn 3 ZBLL algs. I think this
        should be completely managable, and this is nice because by the time
        I&#x27;m done learning ZBF2L, I&#x27;ll already have a decent chunk of
        ZBLL down (about 1 1/2 orientation cases). With practice, I think that
        one ZBLL case per day is very doable, and Chris has already proven that
        his 3 day ZBF2L method works fine, so why not combine the two? Of
        course, if this does prove to be too much, I will try a different
        learning method. However, this sounds like a nice way to focus both on
        ZBF2L and ZBLL without overloading your brain. Let me know what you guys
        think! -Jason

        Hey everyone, These are my first ever ZBLL averages. I only know the T,
        so I had to set it up with a transformation if it wasn&#x27;t already a
        T case after ZBF2L. For solves that were already the T orientation after
        ZBF2L I tried to start from a random angle, and when I needed to do a
        transformation into T I did the transformation without looking then
        started the timer when I first saw each case. So basically these
        averages include the recognition time for ZBLL as well. 05.50, 05.99,
        05.35, 05.25, 04.98, 06.58, (03.22), (07.97), 07.12, 06.67, 05.64, 6.56
        = 5.96 05.34, 09.58, 04.88, 06.94, 05.50, 05.29, (09.94), 05.11, 06.83,
        04.36, 05.05, (03.04) = 5.89 That&#x27;s actually pretty good for me
        even if I was doing Fridrich LL. I had some long delays on the case 6
        algs for my ZBLL T algs since I recently learned them. I think in 6
        months when I know all the T algs second nature that I can easily get
        sub-5 on average. So I think a sub-5 average is possible for ZBLL algs
        that you know very well. Maybe after 2-3 years of knowing ZBLL that
        could even get to low 4.xx, who knows? With all easy cases I think a
        sub-4 might be possible, though those types of averages would be
        infrequent. Anyway I thought this was promising, since it shows that
        even with delays on cases that I recently learned, I can get times that
        compare to a fairly good Fridrich LL average (for me). I think ZBLL will
        definitely be managable, even with recognition. Chris

        Hey friends, Here&#x27;s my ideas. I think practicing ZB would overall

        for most of the last layer cases I was working on, but the recognition
        was insane. Practicing this recognition i think would give even better

        Chris, what do you think about the zbll cases that actually require more
        moves (and possibly takes more time to execute) to solve than the
        oll/pll setup for that case? I guess it can be argued that the zbll alg

        Yeah I think that&#x27;s a good point. For my slowest ZBLL cases I would
        also look at the COLL/PLL case and see if it was fast. I never did try
        the OLL/PLL case though. I think I&#x27;m going to look into that for my
        really slow ZBLL cases. As long as OLL/PLL is faster than any other
        traditional style ZBLL alg I can find, then I would have no problem with
        using OLL/PLL (or maybe even COLL/PLL) for that case. I just want to use

        Hey Santiago, What I do is this. Open up the command window by clicking
        on &quot;start&quot;, then &quot;run&quot;, then type in
        &quot;command&quot; and click on &quot;OK&quot; If you don&#x27;t use
        windows then get to a place where you can run a java program from a
        command screen. In the windows command program you have to change
        directories to where your files are for ACube using the tradional DOS
        directory commands. Once you get to the right directory, type in this
        java -cp ACube3.jar ACube Now after that line you have a few options for
        attributes. You can have the program search in either face turn metric,
        slice turn metric, or quarter turn metric. Your other options are to
        search for optimal length algs or algs of any length, and also for the
        program to print out every alg it finds or only a small portion. The
        commands I use to search for ZBLL algs are these: java -cp ACube3.jar
        ACube q a The &quot;q&quot; means to search in quartern turn metrics and
        the &quot;a&quot; means print out every single alg. Once I&#x27;ve
        analyzed the positions in that metric I exit the program with &quot;Ctrl
        + C&quot; and start it again with java -cp ACube3.jar ACube a This
        searches in face turn metric (face turn is the default) and prints out
        every alg it finds. I then compare the best quarter turn algs and best
        face turn algs and try to find the best alg among those. If you are
        comfortable with slice moves, which I am not, then you would also want
        to use this search string java -cp ACube3.jar ACube s a --------------
        Once in ACube you have to decide which types of turns you want to allow,
        and you have to input the position. While in quarter turn searching
        (java -cp ACube3.jar ACube q a) I often start with searching for [RUL]
        only algs. To do this I have to come up with the octet that represents R
        U and L only. The order of the faces is UDFBLRESM I only want to allow R
        U and L so I would go through and put a &quot;0&quot; on the face I
        don&#x27;t want to allow and a &quot;1&quot; on the one I do want to
        allow. UDFBLRESM 100011000 Now break this up into three groups of three
        numbers. 100 011 000 and convert each group of three numbers to decimal.
        100 = 4 in decimal. 011 = 3 in decimal. and 000 = 0 in decimal. Now put
        those numbers together and you get 430 So to search for RUL only moves
        type &quot;430&quot; then a space then the cube position. I also like to
        do RULM moves which is 431 by the same process. Now you have to input
        the cube state. I&#x27;ll input the T-orientation case ZBLL alg that has
        all corners in the correct spot and the edges are in the H permutation.
        So UBR is rotated counter-clockwise, UBL is rotated clockwise, UF and UB
        switch, and UR and UL switch. In ACube this is: UB UL UF UR !! ! -UBR
        +UBL !! The edges are in the order UF UR UB UL DF DR DB DL FR FL BR BL
        and the corners are in the order UFR UBR UBL UFL DFR DFL DBL DBR The
        &quot;!!&quot; is short for everything past the last entry is in the
        correct spot and oriented correctly. A &quot;!&quot; means that single
        piece is solved and oriented correclty. Typing &quot;!!&quot; only goes
        through the end of that type of piece. So I have to type it once to say
        that all the remaining corners are ok, and again at the end to say that
        all the remaining edges are ok. So UB UL UF UR !! ! -UBR +UBL !! is
        short for UB UL UF UR DF DR DB DL FR FL BR BL UFR -UBR +UBL UFL DFR DFL
        DBL DBR The &quot;-&quot; means that corner is rotated counter-clockwise
        and the &quot;+&quot; means it is rotated clockwise. A &quot;-&quot; in
        front of an edge means the edges is flipped. So to search for a RULM
        moves only solution to the above ZBLL case you would type : 431 UB UL UF
        UR !! ! -UBR +UBL !! Here are some useful face searches that I use a
        lot: RUL = 430 RULM = 431 URF = 510 URLD = 630 URLF = 530 URFD = 710

        Hey everyone, Ever since I started I&#x27;ve been using COLL/EPLL (edge
        PLL) for ZBLL cases I don&#x27;t know. I think COLL/PLL is slower than
        OLL/PLL though, so I&#x27;ve been working on that lately. It&#x27;s hard
        to get used to, but I think with time it will be faster. The problem is
        your chance for 1 look LL changes dramatically between the two. In order
        for a EPLL skip to count as non-lucky for speedcubing.com you have to
        have a 20% or greater chance to skip the step you skipped. For COLL/PLL
        the 1/12 chance to skip EPLL helps tremendously. However if you change
        that to the odds for OLL or PLL skip then things change. Here are the
        numbers for how many ZBLL algs you have to know in order to count your
        skips as non-lucky for COLL/PLL and OLL/PLL COLL/PLL (1/27) +
        (4/27)*(x/72) + (22/27)*(1/12) = 0.2 x = 46.2 or 47. So you have to know
        basically 4 COLL cases and use all the PLL and COLL/PLL on any case you
        don&#x27;t know. OLL/PLL (1/27) + (4/27)*(x/72) +
        (22/27)*[(1/27)*(71/72) + (26/27)*(1/72) + (1/27)*(1/72)] = 0.2 x =
        59.24 or 60 So you have to know 60 ZBLL algs or 5 full COLL cases in
        order for OLL/PLL step skip solves to be non-lucky for speedcubing.com
        The only reason I say this is that you will start to get skip solves a
        lot that are faster than your pb solves with Fridrich. In order to count
        those on speedcubing.com though, you have to use the above strategies at
        the right time. This assumes you know all ZBF2L. At 4 COLL cases use
        COLL/PLL on *every* ZBLL case you don&#x27;t know and any skip solve
        that was previously lucky now counts for speedcubing.com lists. After 5
        full COLL cases you can use OLL/PLL on any COLL case you don&#x27;t know
        and still have your skip solves count for speedcubing.com Just some ways
        to stay motivated along the way :-D So benchmark #1 is 4 COLL cases to
        have non lucky skip step solves. Then benchmark #2 is to get to 5 COLL
        cases so that you can switch to OLL/PLL which is faster, and still have
        skip step solves non-lucky. Chris

        realize there will not always be faster times with ZB, but I think the
        potential for ZB is greater than that of Fridrich. Sure, the recognition
        time will be slightly more, but there&#x27;s only one recognition
        period. For OLL/PLL, there are two. If you can keep the single one with
        ZB reasonably short, combined with the potential for fewer moves, I
        think it&#x27;s a winning combination. Certainly, shorter algs are not
        necessarily faster ones; the T perm is one of my faster algs. But with
        as much optimization as Chris is putting into them, I really don&#x27;t
        think it&#x27;s going to be anywhere near a problem. I see sub 15 easily
        acheivable for him relatively soon. -Mike

        With the last c/e pair, I often attempt to influence my corner
        orientation on some of the simpler c/e cases. For example, from
        Chris&#x27; list, the first and some other assorted cases from groups 1,
        6, and 13, I would see if any U turns I could perform before or during
        insertion would grant me a better corner orientation (which comes in
        mighty useful considering I only know one alg from the Bruno COLL case
        at present). I was curious what the odds of OLL skips after ZBF2L change
        to when you only use these cases and what they are like after accounting
        for trying to fix corners. I&#x27;m also curious how difficult it would
        be to try to always fix corner permutation during the last pair.
        Certainly, it would add a lot of algs, whether memorized or intuitive,
        to the ZBF2L plate, but it would drastically reduce the number of
        necessary ZBLL algs. As someone who is planning to learn all only the ZB
        algs for correctly permuted corners (and perhaps a few other special
        cases), this seems very appealing. I&#x27;m just looking for someone
        else&#x27;s take on the idea, because I don&#x27;t recall anyone ever
        mentioning it before. I&#x27;m highly interested in learning more about

        really like trying to work out odds and scenarios. I don&#x27;t think I
        fully understand what you are doing yet, but I&#x27;d love to try to
        work out the odds for you. Do you mean that you still do a ZBF2L (flip
        all LL edges correctly after having solved the last c/e pair) and in
        addition orient some or all of the corners? Would you make sure that you
        have say at least 1, or at least 2, or all corners solved? > > I&#x27;m
        also curious how difficult it would be to try to always fix corner >
        permutation during the last pair. Certainly, it would add a lot of >

        is planning to learn all only the ZB algs for correctly permuted >
        corners (and perhaps a few other special cases), this seems very >
        appealing. What about this, you could learn all the algs to both orient
        edges and place all corners for ZBF2L case 1 and 13. I imagine for each
        ZBF2L case there would be around 12 algs not including reflections that
        you would need to also move corners. So for 16 cases you would need 12
        for each of them so that&#x27;s 192 algs for ZBF2L (a little more than
        full ZBF2L) but it would reduce your ZBLL count to the ones with just
        correct corners (84 I believe). That would take fewer algs than ZB, and
        I imagine it would be pretty fast. For F2L on the last c/e pair you
        could either pair up the corner and edge or form them into case 13, then
        use the required alg to flip edge, permute corners, and solve the c/e
        pair. Then you would have 84 possibilities for the truncated ZBLL solve.
        I think it would lose a little bit of time off regular ZB by having to
        either form case 1 or case 13 with the corner and edge (max 5-6 moves I
        would guess? maybe 7 moves on a very very small number of cases). The
        recognition for the extended ZBF2L would be a bit longer than regular
        ZBF2L as well. So the only time you add is maybe an extra second for
        recognition, plus .75-1.0 seconds for forming the pair. I believe with
        mastery of ZBF2L that sub-14 is possible for ZB, so with an extra up to
        2 seconds you could expect this method to average 15 seconds? Myabe even
        sub-15 with good cases over the average? I think it shouldn&#x27;t lose
        much time off regular ZB, and it requires far fewer cases to learn. I
        think the method seems sound personally. Chris > > I&#x27;m just looking

        do the inverse of the setup. I can only do this to cases where a single
        or double U turn fixes them. However, because I don&#x27;t know the
        Bruno COLL cases, and I&#x27;ve only just learned the Double Sune cases,
        it&#x27;s very helpful to see when the LL corners will come out all
        incorrectly oriented, and be able to switch them to a different case.
        Most times, if I can&#x27;t get a full OLL skip out of it, I can at
        least transform into either the L or T shapes, which all of my algs for
        are very fast. Again, this generally only adds 2 or so turns to a solve,
        and gives a much better LL. > > > > I&#x27;m also curious how difficult

        Hello, I&#x27;m kind of thinking to learn that system for the LL.
        However, I have a few question : Is it better to learn first the ZB-LL
        or the ZB-F2L ? I&#x27;m kind of thinking that it would be better to
        start with the ZB-LL and use it only when I have that OLL. But I would
        like your advices first. :-) Also, about the alg, should I use ACube to
        find some alg if the ones already displayed on the net don&#x27;t

        I&#x27;m still wondering if the zb method is really worth it. I mean,
        it&#x27;s just another way so solve the LL in 2 looks with a more
        complicated recognition. I think the only way to really improve the
        Fridrich system is to start learning the LL in one alg. That, as I see
        it, would be a very interesting improvement. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m
        thinking learning the ZB-LL as the first step of the LL in one look.
        There are not so many cases after all. If you want to learn the ZB-F2L,
        you could learn some other patterns to solve them in one alg. This is
        still a possibility and I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m really going to
        learn the complete LL in one look (over 5.000 cases) but I think the
        ZB-LL is very useful. Well, maybe tomorrow morning when I&#x27;ll
        re-read this message I&#x27;ll see that I&#x27;m actually completely
        tired, but I think this makes sense. What do you think ? Gilles.

        Look at things this way: ZBF2L really only adds a few moves to most of
        your solves, and none to several. ZBLL shortens the number of moves for
        your LL on average. If you could learn full ZB, you should be able to
        average 45 moves or less. Fridrich takes around 55 on average, I think.

        My claim is that ZBF2L, with &quot;enough&quot; practice, will require
        the same amount of recognition as the 4th normal Fridrich F2L pair. The
        question is: &quot;what is &#x27;enough&#x27; practice?&quot; Nobody yet
        knows the answer.... that is, unless chris has some sort of idea? ~ Bob

        I can&#x27;t really see how learning 1-look LL is better then learning
        full ZB. With a 1-look LL: * the averge number of moves to solve the
        complete cube is about the same as with full ZB (about 47 moves). * you
        would have to learn about 8 times the amount of algorihtms (3915 vesus
        798). * recognition would be much tougher since with ZB you spread the
        work more evenly over the last couple of steps. So it seems to me that
        you&#x27;re doing much more work to safe exactly the same amount of
        moves and time. What are others people opinions on this? Going back to
        Chris&#x27; point on ZBF2L/ZBLL &quot;replacing&quot; OLL/PLL but being
        more complicated: that&#x27;s true, but: * any recognition task that is
        or can be mastered to perfection will in the end become instantaneous
        and just as fast as an easier recognition task. This just requires
        practice. * Looking at it this way, you sort of skip the 4th pair and
        immediately start doing ZBF2L which gives you a signifcant advantage in
        terms of move count. I&#x27;m still very convinced that ZB is the best
        Fridrich extension that people have come up with so far. Any other idea
        I&#x27;ve heard so far (and I&#x27;ve heard many), either don&#x27;t
        give as much advantage lengthwise and just makes your method more
        complicated, or either give the same advantage as ZB but require much
        more learning in the end (Gilles&#x27; idea being a good example). I
        understand why people get discouraged by the number of algorithms you
        have to learn, but think about how ominous Fridrich seemed when you
        first learned about it (it certainly was for me!). Although ZB has much
        more cases, you already have so much expierence from learning your
        current system that you can rely on and that you can use as a leverage
        for learning ZB. There&#x27;s only one way to find out if ZB is worth
        it: try it! Lars --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, Gilles van den

        Yeah, that&#x27;s correct. Using COLL, you have a 8/12 chance of getting
        a 3 edge cycle, 2/12 chance of getting a Z perm, 1/12 chance of a cross
        perm, and 1/12 chance of a PLL skip. Recognition will slow you down at
        first, but with some practice I&#x27;ve found COLL to be pretty helpful

        That should be R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27;. Anyway, I&#x27;m getting much
        better at fixing or altering corner orientation with the last F2L pair.
        Right now, I can really only use it to fix similar cases to the above,
        and to change cases with four incorrectly oriented corners to cases with
        fewer (which I know better). I know that there are simple ways to expand
        upon this, such as the setup RU2R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;. You can
        fix it with the inverse, which is very quick. I know there are probably
        similar ways to speed up other cases, but I haven&#x27;t tried to find
        any yet. Using this, I managed an 18.40 average earlier, beating my
        previous best average by almost 1 second. I don&#x27;t know if there are
        more cases it&#x27;s easy to fix this way, but I&#x27;m curious what the
        odds to skip the OLL step entirely improve to. I&#x27;m wondering if
        anything more than what I&#x27;m using already is worthwhile in terms of
        moves or time saved. I know that without this, the odds are something
        like 1/27, or ~3.7%. Added to the 1/12 (8.33%)chance for skipping PLL,
        that&#x27;s just over 12% chances for a skipped step every solve. I know
        this improves the odds slightly, but I&#x27;d like to know how much. If
        anyone has any ideas on how to fix corner permutation instead I&#x27;d
        like to hear them, as well. -Mike

        Hey everyone, So I know the french guys have been doing team absolut for
        a while, and competing against eachother and helping eachother has
        clearly done wonders for their times. Well Bob Burton and I were talking
        and we think maybe a team [zb] could do the same for us. Here is the
        proposal. We all invade the sunday contest every sunday, and we use
        however much zb techniques we know. This is great practice to time
        yourself with the new techniques. I mean go all out, make mistakes, try
        new things with the timer still going, etc. I&#x27;ve found that knowing
        ZBLL and ZBF2L and speedsolving ZBLL and ZBF2L are two entirely
        different things, so I think starting early on timing would be a good
        thing. Also, this would be a good chance for us to motivate eachother to
        learn more. We can share tips afterward, talk through solves on this
        group etc.. Also having people see our progress on the sunday contest
        over time may motivate others to try. So remember, if you want to work
        on your zb, do the sunday contest and at the end of your quote but
        something [zb] or ZB or whatever to show that is what you used. Bob and
        I will be doing this for this week&#x27;s sunday contest and we would
        love for everyone to join in! Use whatever you know, even if it&#x27;s
        no much! This is a chance to try out your new algs! Hope to see you all
        there, Chris

        Ya there is a huge difference between knowing it and speedsolving with
        it. I can definitely attest to that. Just to introduce myself here a
        bit. I have been using ideas from the ZB method for roughly 2.5 years
        now. I started speeedsolving about 6 years ago with CLL/ELL and my own
        F2L system after having spent a lot of time finding CLL and ELL algs
        (about a year). At that time I didn&#x27;t know about the speedsolving
        community and my times where around 90s. Three years ago I finished
        learning the COLL set (this was before it was called COLL). Around the
        same time I started learning the ZBLL cases for no corner permutation
        (1/6 chance of running into this). I am a relatively slow solver,
        averaging 22.30 (a non-RA I did last week). I am learning the ZBLL by
        Corner Permutation category (and CLL sub-categories). I get a 1-look LL
        about 45% of the time now. Off Chris&#x27;s ZBF2L page, I know cases
        1,2,3,5,13 and a bit of 4,6,7. The reason I get so many 1-look LL is
        because I know multiple CLL&#x27;s for each CLL case. Also I do some
        more advanced stuff during F2L, such as flipping edges on 3rd c/e pair;
        choosing which of the last two to do as my 3rd pair; and knowing a set
        of algorithms for partial cross solving. That is availible here:
        http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/NewAlgSet.html after RichardP
        requested it. I am working on multiple things now. Learning ZBF2L cases
        4,6,7; geting better at regonizing ZBLL cases in the Sune category; and
        mastering the alg set given above (I have a couple more to go). -Doug

        That&#x27;s not what I meant. Due to the low number of ZBF2L cases I
        know, I resort to certain tricks to get 4 correctly flipped edges. I

        Hi guys, I just got my first sub 20 using the VH system! 22.65, 18.56,
        18.89, 17.36, (25.37), 17.46, 22.28, 20.22, 19.22, 20.76, (17.00), 22.41
        ==> 19.98 The 17.46 was a PLL skip using COLL, and on the 18.89 I used
        ZBLL (took a while to recall it though!). For all of these solves I had
        to convert the fourth pair into either a pair and instert case or just
        an insert case. I was really not expecting this because previously my
        best average with this method was 22.xx. To top it off, this was for the
        Sunday Contest! On a side note, how many ZB algs do I have to know until
        I can say I use ZB and not VH? I&#x27;m feeling very good about this
        method right now. I think that once I know more of it, I&#x27;ll be
        getting some very nice times! :P -Jason team [zb]

        Hi Chris, You have it right except for the 4th pair. VHF2L is done in
        two steps. First, you pair up the fourth pair. Then, you insert it while
        orienting LL edges. I&#x27;m not sure if the pair+insert cases count as
        VHF2L or ZBF2L, though. But yeah, VH is basically just a simplified form
        of the ZB method. -Jason --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, Chris Hunt

        I&#x27;m using all but one of the COLL algs, partial edge control and
        some corner control on top of that, and a few ZB cases for corners
        correctly permuted. My average was 21.37, because of a few very slow

        Conceivably, if you could learn how to orient all corners after fixing
        the edges for every case, that narrows your LL following that to the PLL
        cases. I imagine the number of algs for this to be something like 24 x 2
        x 2 cases, for both the reflections and the case 1 and 13 edge orienting
        algs. This leaves us with 96 algs and our LL is reduced to the PLL. Any
        thoughts? -Mike

        Old habit, I always called it the Bruno. In it&#x27;s pure form it is
        the &quot;4 corners&quot; (4 courners twisted but not the
        &quot;double-superman&quot;), no CP and a specific 3 edge cycle. To me
        Bruno=R&#x27; U2 R2 U R2 U R2 U2 R&#x27;. It goes by the names in team
        BLD as &quot;The Wheel&quot;, &quot;Four Corners&quot; and
        &quot;Pie&quot;. I think these 4 terms are pretty standard now. It can
        be extended to include all the ones in that COLL case (those w/o CP). Or
        it can be extended to what DanH, Hardwick (I think), and I call the
        Pi-Orientation. It&#x27;s all the ZBLL cases with all 4 corners twisted
        (the less symmetric of the two). It really depends on the context.
        However I&#x27;d prefer it to be stated clearly as there seems to be
        confusion frequently. -Doug --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, Brent

        Last night I changed my alg for &quot;Case #13 with a bar&quot;. Also I
        went through and learned Case #4 fully and consolidated on #5. So now I
        know Cases 1,2,3,4,5,13 fully and the others sporatically. As for ZBLL,
        I am now actively using all of H-Orientation Case 1 (not yet on
        Chris&#x27;s site). I am missing two more for the S- Orientation without
        CP. T-Orientation case 1, I&#x27;ll hold off on. I have fully
        incorporated half of T2 and half of U2 into my solving now. My Sunday
        Contest avarage was 22.72. On a unrelated topic... I just got a shipment
        of 5 magics :). -Doug --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bob

        I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of thinking, now that I&#x27;ve learned all
        of my COLL and have begun tackling ZBF2L in earnest, and a lot of it has
        centered on whether it&#x27;s better to use an intuitive or rigid
        approach to ZBF2L. Both have their benefits: Rigid approach probably
        affords faster recognition and execution. This can lead to great times.
        Chris Hardwick is a testament to this. Intuitive approach makes for less
        to learn, helps you understand the way the cube works more so you get
        less amnesia, and allows you to optimize on the fly. I think throughout
        ZBF2L, I&#x27;m going to try to learn as many algorithms intuitively as
        possible, because I like the benefits more. I can perform many of them
        from more than one angle, and I can often fix or influence corner
        orientation along the way. Is anyone else attempting to learn algs like
        this, or does everyone try to learn the cases, rather than what&#x27;s
        going on with the cube? -Mike P.S. Where has our fearless leader been?

        I memorize the ZBF2L cases intuitively. There really aren&#x27;t that
        many algs in my arsenal that I don&#x27;t understand and apply blindly.
        I&#x27;d like to keep it that way. When learning a ZBF2L alg, I&#x27;ll
        disect it into parts: if it&#x27;s a conjugator, if it messes with a
        cross edge, if it transforms it into another ZBF2L case... etc. I also
        know all the secondary effects of my COLL algs. So I pick between doing
        it or it&#x27;s mirror depending on edges. -Doug --- In

        I think between the various cases I know about 75 or 76, discounting

        Hey everyone, I&#x27;m still working on a page that shows the most
        common ZBF2L patterns. Quite often a few cases are really just one
        underlying short case, with setup moves into it. That will be up
        shortly, I just need to find time around my homework, of which
        unfortunately there is a lot :-( As far as intuitive vs. concrete, I
        guess I have always been in the conrete camp on anything new, maybe the
        4x4 is the only exception where I try to discover new things on my own.
        I tend to be too impatient, and would rather learn it all and recall
        from memory, then over time come to understand. That is just my laziness
        to be perfectly honest, I think intuitive zbf2l would ultimately be
        faster. I can only hope that after a year when you guys all know
        intuitive zbf2l second nature that I can hope to keep up :-P Anyway, I
        think intuitive learning is a very good idea, and my page to help with
        that will hopefully be done very shortly. Chris team [zb] --- In

        Tonight I finished learning ZBF2l Case #7 and Case #10. A couple hours
        later after doing other things, I quized myself on each one randomly and
        got em. I also double checked that I can do all the Case 4 and 5 that I
        learned the previous day. Most notably however I think I got to the 25%
        mark on the S- Orientation (or S and AS combined). Tonight I spent a few
        hours trying to make sure I can do recognition for these cases. I&#x27;m
        sure Chris would agree that these are the hardest to recognize cases in
        ZBLL. The bulk of it were all the ones that had no CP. There are dozens
        of cases here alone if you count mirrors and inverses. Outside of no CP,
        I learned 2 cases for each Sunish-COLL. I just spent an additional 30
        minutes after taking a shower to quiz myself on these S-Ori with no CP
        ones. I think I can actively use them in my speedsolving now.
        Recognition is now pretty comfortable. Ok my eyes really, really hurt
        now. -Doug

        Actually, it is only the &quot;bad&quot; cases that take

        Hey everyone, I&#x27;m really going to being in earnest with this
        &quot;one parity&quot; method for the 4x4x4. Bascailly it entails using
        the COLL case to identify whether or not your have double parity or just
        single parity whenever you see the OLL parity. I&#x27;m going to
        complete all the orientation pages and COLL images on my ZBLL page in
        order to use it as a study aid. I will continue to only add the actual
        algorithms as I learn them. I really only post an alg once I know it
        through and through, so that won&#x27;t change. If you&#x27;re
        interested in this method, let me know and I can explain more about it.
        ZB is what gave me the idea to try it, and since working out better
        solutions to the parity algs is the hot topic for 4x4x4 solving right
        now I want to pursue it pretty hard myself. So ZB helps for other cubes,
        not just the 3x3x3. The advantage to using the &quot;one-parity&quot;
        method is also that ZBLL becomes a viable option on 4x4x4 since you can
        be certain of a true ZBLL case without parity. Something to think about
        if you&#x27;re interested in using your new ZB stuff to help for the
        larger cubes as well. Chris team [zb]

        Hey everyone, We had six team [zb] solvers in the sunday contest! This
        is totally cool! Congrats to everyone who used ZB, and I hope you were
        able to learn something new, or cement your new cases a little better! I
        really do think competing once a week like this will help us all to
        really not only learn this method, but learn to speedsolve with it. It
        will take work yes, but if we all motivate eachother I think the time
        spent learning it can be quite fun! Looking forward to using ZB with you

        I am rather behind on the posts in the other forum. I just read
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/20
        694 and decided to open JNetCube and see how many it took me. It gave me
        the following scramble: B U&#x27; F&#x27; U F2 U&#x27; D2 L&#x27;
        B&#x27; L2 U&#x27; R&#x27; L2 U2 R2 F&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; D R B
        F&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; F I was able to do F2L in 31 turns. Moreover it
        was ZBF2L. Even better was that I applied your idea of avoiding 4
        twisted corners while still ZB-ing. It was a Case #1 so it was a bit
        trivial. I knew the ZBLL for that particular L-Orientation I got. Total
        number of turns: 40!!! Funny, my WC05 FMC qualifying was 51 :(. -Doug

        I think it&#x27;d be good if we all periodically post updates here about
        our progress. So today I found that I am forgetting a couple of the Case
        7 and Case 10&#x27;s. But I&#x27;m only off by one move somewhere, so it
        should should be okay. I worked on quizing myself on the S-Orientaion
        with no CP yesterday and I think I have them all down now. I have an
        interesting naming scheme for these guys if your interested. I just did
        a sitting in which about half of my solves where 1-look LL. I did lag up
        a bit though. The two algs I need to work on are the T2 with an F-ish
        perm, and the U2 with an F-ish perm. Altogether, I know (and ACTIVELY
        USE!) 5 in T1, 6 in T2, 5 in U1, and 8 in U2. (I prefer to think of T1
        and U1 as the same thing though.) I average knowing 1.7 cases in each of
        the other COLL categories. I also have all the H1, missing one L1, and
        about half the Pi1. I think I won&#x27;t learn anymore ZBF2L for a
        while, I don&#x27;t want to confuse myself. (I know 1,2,3,4,5,7,10,13.)
        I have yet to come across the S1 cases in speedsolving, so I hope to
        have fully incorporated these ZBLL into my solving by the end of the
        month. Then I&#x27;ll move on... maybe finish Case 6 (2 of 6 I have been
        using for over a year so only 4 more there). Where are you guys at?

        I sadly have not been practicing as much as I should be lately. I mostly
        just practice transformation solves (transform whatever OLL I get after
        ZBF2L into &quot;T&quot;) and I haven&#x27;t timed myself with ZB since
        the sunday contest. Lately 4x4x4 BLD has consumed all of my free time,
        big cubes BLD is a drug lol, be wary ;-) I still remember all of my T
        algs, though I delay recognizing my T6 cases and about half of my
        T5&#x27;s still :-( I still know my U1 cases and the half of U2 that I
        know. I need to decide on an alg for my next two cases and I should soon
        finish up U2. School has been kicking my butt lately :-( so I
        haven&#x27;t been as diligent as I should be right now. Once things calm
        down a bit I&#x27;ll jump back in full strength. Doug I think you know
        more ZBLL than I or Dan H by now don&#x27;t you? You have it more spread
        out than we do, but it definitely seems like quite a bit. Heh heh gotta
        try and keep up, don&#x27;t want to get too far behind :-P Chris P.S.

        Today I finished learning all the T1 algs. I&#x27;ve been more focused
        on ZBLL than I have ZBF2L, but I learned all of case 4 for ZBF2L.
        Tomorrow I&#x27;ll move on to case 5 for ZBF2L and T2 for ZBLL.
        I&#x27;ve found some pretty nice algs for some of the T1 cases that
        aren&#x27;t on Chris or Dan&#x27;s pages. I want to make a website for
        my ZB algs just so I can keep track of which ones I use in case I forget
        them and have to look them up or anything, and also just to have another
        ZBLL page out there to help other people learning. Unfortunately I
        really don&#x27;t know a thing about HTML so it would be like learning
        it as I go along. I still want to do this though, so I&#x27;ll post it

        Hey everyone, I just did an average using transformations sometimes
        instead of always COLL when I don&#x27;t know the ZBLL algs for the COLL
        case. Basically, on my slowest COLL cases I do the transformation into T
        instead of COLL, since the transformations are all suney type algs and
        the T is a ZBLL alg. 17.24, 17.52, 17.46, (14.44), 21.18, (30.01),
        16.94, 19.01, 18.94, 22.21, 18.55, 16.20 = 18.52 The 16.94 was actually
        transforming either an S or AS orientation into T then doing the T alg.
        Some solves were straight ZB, some were fast COLL. The 16.20 at the very
        end was a straight ZB solve, I knew the ZBLL case, and I think 1 of the
        17&#x27;s also. I kind of like this, since some of my COLL cases are
        horrible, and I think it might be faster to do the transformation then a
        T alg. I&#x27;m going to mess around with this some more, but even with
        only beginning to do this I can get sub-19 with it. I think this method
        will definitely be worth considering for when you know a full
        orientation case. I don&#x27;t mean to brag here, I&#x27;m not trying to
        rub in knowing the T orientation. I just know that you guys will all be
        to this point very shortly, so I&#x27;m trying to mess around with new
        techniques and hopefully you guys will know a really good strategy for
        handling your non-ZBLL case solves better than COLL/PLL by the time you
        get her. I definitely agree with Mike that COLL/EPLL is not a good LL
        strategy in the long run, so I&#x27;m trying to find new things as well.
        Mike I do remember those posts on the regular speedsolving group a while
        back, and though I disagreed then I have come to agree now with more
        practice. Chris

        this. I started learning COLL this week, with the intention of spending
        a few weeks learning the algorithms, then a few weeks with a some ZBF2L
        cases. I guess that&#x27;s VH. I was thinking this would be a good
        starting point to begin learning ZBLL in mid-January. Do you think my
        time would be better spent learning a full ZBLL case and transforming
        what I don&#x27;t know from the start, or should knowing COLL be a
        prerequisite to ZBLL, even without a long-term value? Thanks. Matt

        Hey Matt, I guess I should have clarified a little more ;-) COLL/EPLL is
        extremely fast, and I think when you factor in the 1/12 chance to skip
        EPLL that it might be faster than most people&#x27;s OLL/PLL combos. I
        think a really good OLL/PLL set of algs though would probably win out.
        What I don&#x27;t like is getting a slow COLL case, and ending with a Z
        permutation. As weird as that sounds, and as much as I like the Z perm
        in my solving, it is my slowest and longest EPLL alg. That double
        combination can mean a slow LL time compared to the average COLL/PLL
        gives you. On this page: http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zbstats.html I
        have twice done a 100 cube average that shows the number of moves used
        in COLL/PLL finish. I get that, including the EPLL skips, COLL/PLL
        averages 21.12 moves on average. I think Fridrich averages around 19-20
        as well so they are fairly close. The problem though, for me, is that
        keeping the edges oriented for some CLL cases means a slow alg. Having
        said that though I have managed sub-17 averages using COLL/PLL on ZBLL
        cases that I don&#x27;t know. I am certain I have had a full 12 cube
        sub-17 average that only had EPLL skips for the ZBLL stuff, meaning that
        sub-17 is definitely possible. I don&#x27;t think a transformation+ZBLL
        combo used exclusively would be faster, but rather a combination of
        COLL/PLL finish (only on fast COLL cases) and transformation+ZBLL on
        slow COLL cases would be best. I think all of COLL should be required
        before learning any ZBLL though, since the recognition of ZBLL for me is
        so heavily based on COLL. I use the block recognition technique for
        ZBLL, and often the only thing different between three different ZBLL
        cases is the COLL case. They can have the same block structure, but be
        different COLL cases. So I would definitely say to learn COLL, and use
        COLL/EPLL until you finish your first orientation case for ZBLL. After
        that point, replace your slowest COLL cases with transformations into
        your ZBLL orientation. At least that is the experiment I am trying, but
        I have a feeling it has potential to e very fast. So when I say slower,
        I only mean sometimes. COLL/EPLL is still fast, but I don&#x27;t think
        it is the best option. It is, however, still a good one. Chris --- In

        I&#x27;d recommend learning COLL first. At least you can use it in every
        ZBF2L solve. And you can OLL in cases where you don&#x27;t ZBF2L it.
        Learning specific groups of ZBLL means that you don&#x27;t get to see it
        much, thus you hardly ever use it (unless you transform to it like Chris
        does). This means that it would be harder to retain. It&#x27;s easier to
        retain algs that you use more frequently. If you learn COLL first, I
        think you&#x27;ll start to understand the types of recognition tricks
        involved for ZBLL (if that is your final goal). -Doug --- In

        I have been transforming cases as well. When I get to the LL I will flip
        edges if I haven&#x27;t already. Then I solve the corner permutation
        using one of two pre-picked COLLs. (The fastest ones I know for adj swap
        and diag swap, resp.) If it is a PLL, I&#x27;ll solve it straight up
        since I still need work on my PLL. (I only recently mastered... ok maybe
        not mastered, PLL. Like only a bit over a year.) Else, I do a single
        Sune (also in pre-picked grippings) to get it into the S-Orientation if
        it is not already. This way I get to practice my S-Orientation cases
        (those w/o CP). I pre-pick all my grippings to ensure uniform

        Even though I do know on average 1.7 for each COLL, that was not what I
        was refering to. What I meant was that if you pay attention to the
        secondary effects of your choosen COLL (edge effect), then it is
        possible to avoid H Perm and Z Perm by choosing between the alg and
        it&#x27;s mirror (or in some cases it is possible that the inverse or
        mirrored-inverse will do the trick). So even the standard COLL knowhow
        can be buffed up a bit. Due note that I have been COLL-ing for over 2

        I&#x27;m toying with two possible other routes for solvers, instead of
        normal ZB. As I see it, when you&#x27;re finishing your last pair, there
        are four possible LL substeps you can accomplish with it. Orient edges,
        as in ZB Orient corners Permute corners Permute edges. I don&#x27;t
        think permuting edges would be very effective, because you would be left
        with edge OLL and COLL without disturbing edges. This leaves the middle
        two strategies unexamined. The latter of which would leave an
        interesting combination. Assuming you used ZB cases (however many up to
        you, but at least 1 and 13)to flip edges first, it would basically leave
        you with an easy ZB case for the remaining step. It would be an
        interesting alternative to ZB, but without quite so much potential.
        Perhaps as an alternative to someone who doesn&#x27;t want to learn full
        ZB, but wouldn&#x27;t mind a reduced number of cases. The former choice
        seems more interesting to me. There are two possible ways to pursue this
        option. The first involves learning cases to orient corners only, seeing
        as this has the greatest number of possible cases concerning these four
        substeps, it offers the greatest possible rewards for lessening the
        number of cases for your last step. If you could orient corners with
        your last pair, simply using cases 1 and 13 that gives us 27*2*2 cases,
        accounting for symmetry. That gives us 108 cases to learn, compared to
        the 306 for ZBF2L. Also this leaves us with an intruiging last layer.
        Essentially, it would give you of the 21 PLL cases, with one of 7
        possible edge orientations. As far as recognition is concerned, I think
        it could be quite fast. The trick would be finding algs that did it
        quickly. I&#x27;m terrible at finding move counts and whatnot, so I
        don&#x27;t know if this would prove to even be an improvement over
        normal CFOP, but I suspect it would be, if only for the reduced number
        of moves for corner orientation. Alternately, if one were to perform a
        ZB case 1 or 13 alg *followed* by a corner orienter, this brings your
        OLL skip percentage to 100%, leaving you with a simple PLL for your LL
        (except in cases where your fourth pair is finished after you place your
        third). Again, I&#x27;m no expert on move counts, but I would assume
        exploiting an open slot would be useful. Especially in cases where
        you&#x27;ve got an easy edge orientaion, this could be quite fast. In
        fact, I got a 14.25 today with it. Technically I had one pair come up
        ready to insert and a very easy two move cross, but it was still way
        faster any of my other solves. Again, I doubt this will approach full ZB
        in terms of potential, but for those wary of learning several hundred
        algorithms, this might be a good way to go. Really, it&#x27;s got 140
        F2L cases and 21 LL cases. Anyway, this was all inspired by my foolings
        with ZB, and may be an interesting path to try. If anyone wants to work
        out possible move numbers or percentages and things for me, or explain
        how, that would be fantastic. > I don&#x27;t mean to brag here, I&#x27;m

        than COLL/PLL by the time you get her. If you have 1/12 odds of a PLL
        skip with COLL, and the T cases account for about 1/5 of what comes up,
        that means you have a 1/4 or better chance to come up with a 1 Look LL
        after learning only this case. I think taking stock of your inventory of
        COLL algs every now and then to see which cases are slow and which are
        fast is a good idea anyway. However, if you&#x27;ve already learned all
        of the T&#x27;s, now is the time to do it again. Decide based on the
        orientation case whether or not you&#x27;re going to do COLL or just
        transform to the T case. In general, I think you&#x27;d want to stick
        with COLL, simply because recognizing the case to transform into the T
        and then a ZB alg on top of that would add incredible odds for delay. >I

        Actually, I think I said C/COLL+E/PLL was a bad idea. Too ambiguous and
        not beneficial enough. It&#x27;s why I decided to go with straight
        COLL+PLL. And, at least for me, this is proving far more promising than
        OLL+PLL. Since I&#x27;ve started learning them a few months ago,
        I&#x27;ve dropped my best average of 100 down to 19.96. Then again, I
        think I&#x27;ll have more luck in the end with COLL+PLL/specialized ZB,
        but your mileage may vary. > > Chris > Mike team [zb]

        reduced number of cases. There are two ways to divide this further, now
        that I think about it: permuting after pairing/edge flipping and
        permuting while pairing/edge flipping. The first one would be much
        simpler, and only require something like 42 F2L cases, and about 70 LL
        cases, while the second option would give something like 48*2*however
        many ZBF2L cases you want to learn (probably at least cases 1 and 13) +
        70 LL cases. Again, it&#x27;s doubtful either of these methods will
        prove to have a significantly reduced move count from standard CFOP or
        even COLL+PLL, but I can definitely dream. :) > Mike > team [zb]

        Just a quick post to say hi to everyone in this group, I have been
        reading the messages and I have now joined. I have quite a bit of
        experience with ZBLL, and I hope that this group will allow us all to
        improve every aspect of this method, because I feel it has the potential
        to be very fast. I once learned all the T Orientation, but have as a
        consequence of practicing for WC2005 not had the time to practice them
        as much as I would have liked. I am currently working on learning 100%
        of the 2-generator cases for ZBLL, with the goal of always being able to
        solve the 2-gen LL in one look. This has a nice advantage of being easy
        to practice, since if you scramble using the 2-generator you will always
        end up with a case that you are trying to practice (especially if you
        know all the transformation algorithms that Chris has mentioned before)
        The hard part about that is the algorithms are so similar it is unreal,
        but it&#x27;s just like learning different edge 3-cycles for different
        angles I guess, it all comes with practice! Good Luck everyone, keep me
        posted :) Dan :)

      <strong>109. Another idea for solving the cube!</strong><br />

        HI everyone, Thanks to Chris for pointing out this group to me, I
        didn&#x27;t even realise it existed before this morning! :-S Sorry. The
        ZBLL is dependent on all 4 LL edges being correctly oriented once you
        finish the F2L. As you get further on in your solution, edge control
        gets harder and harder, simply because you have less freedom. Recently I
        have been experimenting with Orienting edges right at the beginning of
        the solve. Orienting edges and then solving the cross is easy enough to
        do, but I think you would only reap any benefit from this if you could
        orient edges AND solve the cross SIMULTANEOUSLY. I suggested to Chris
        that with a lot of practice, this might be in the same league as solving
        the XCross, which Chris himself admits he can regularly see now given
        the 15 seconds inspection. I must note that this idea was not
        fundamentally mine, it was discussing this possibility with Ron at
        WC2005 and also hearing about it sometime in the past that caused me to
        try and work at it. Really, it&#x27;s the first time I heard about it
        and had enough cubing experience to know exactly what it means for the
        rest of the solve ;) Of course, most of you guys are a lot sharper than
        me, and you would probably realise even now, that if you could have
        12correctly oriented edges after the cross is solved, you have 2
        advantages. Firstly, you can blaze through the F2L, the number of cases
        is halved? (intuition tells me this but like most things where intuition
        is involved ive probably missed a simple counter-example...). But you
        can speed through it using only R U and L (and D of course, for empty
        slots), and of course F2 and B2 if necessary. You can even use F and B
        if it&#x27;s easier, as long as the algorithm is 2-generator and you
        replace the cross edge after solving the pair it won&#x27;t affect the
        edges! Secondly, once you&#x27;ve solved the F2L, without any work at
        all (and ensuring you haven&#x27;t changed edge orientation during F2L),
        you end up with a ZBLL case by default. I realise a lot of people in
        this group are learning ZBF2L, and this would render those 300 or so
        algs redundant. I don&#x27;t want to &quot;urinate on your bonfire&quot;
        by any means, I still think it is worth learning since my original idea
        of orienting edges is still unproved to work, but this is why I am
        posting about it! But you have to work far less hard to orient edges
        during the F2L, so you could go at it absolutely full speed, and with
        the ease of the algorithms perhaps even solve it in 5-6 seconds. However
        I would like you to consider this idea. So you would proceed: Orient
        edges + Solve Cross together F2L ZBLL I am currently learning the ZBLL
        element which is common to both this idea and the full ZB system, so I
        am not in too far that I can&#x27;t get out yet ;) I would appreciate
        some feedback :) DanH :)

        this together, it could provide a benefit, not necessarily in number of
        moves, though, because two-generator algs are often longer but faster.
        However, I have enough trouble as it is trying to find the cross in the
        15 seconds most of the time. How do you even see which edges to flip?
        Also, after trying this out, I managed to average about 38 with this,
        but I was often flipping edges long after my cross. If you could manage
        to do this simultaneously, like I did for a couple of solves, I think it
        could be very useful. I got several solves in the low 20&#x27;s like
        this, which isn&#x27;t far off from my average. What&#x27;s the worst
        case scenario possible with this? If you had no decent cross (one of the
        8 move cases probably) and all 8 other edges flipped, perhaps. Would the
        time saved by using two gen algs to finish things be worth it with the
        number of moves this will potentially add? Just some things to think
        about. -Mike team [zb]

        (my last hard data I was at 28% but I use it a good bit more often after
        RWC so I think I might be close or around 33% by now), is that sometimes
        the Xcross is so hard I wouldn&#x27;t even dream of trying it. If
        orienting edges like this is indeed roughly the same difficulty as
        Xcross, then you would need a backup plan for when that strategy is too
        difficult. Obviously my back is just cross and 4 pairs. I wonder how you
        would handle a 10 edges flipped where the edges are in an 8 move state
        away from solved case? Perhaps this strategy would work, like Xcross,
        only for the easy/medium cases? Or if it is indeed easier and can be
        done all the time then that would solve this whole problem. Just trying
        to think out loud, I think it is a good idea, but I think we need to
        refine it a bit too. Chris

        Oh gosh... this is terribly addictive... or I am just way too competitve

        I don&#x27;t understand the naming you choose. I am assuming all these
        cases are for the no CP cases. I like your first two. It&#x27;s actually
        the only ones in this group I have yet to learn. I would have done
        something horrible like (R&#x27;B2)(L2U2&#x27;F)(UF&#x27;U)(L&#x27;B)^2
        (R). I&#x27;ll have to adapt yours. I haven&#x27;t gone through each and
        every one of these, but I do use some different algs: Like > OPPX =
        R&#x27; U2 R2 U R&#x27; U&#x27; R2 U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R2 U R2 U&#x27;
        R&#x27; I do
        zU&#x27;(R&#x27;UR&#x27;U&#x27;)(R2U)z&#x27;(R&#x27;U2)(RUR&#x27;U)R. As
        for determining which case, I have to pre-adjust the U layer first so
        that the corners are in place. Then I check for no EP (I have a very
        fast alg for that); the H-EP (I do a triple sune here); one of the Z-EPs
        (the one above is the default CLL I have been using for ages, it is a
        Sune/Sune combination) I will do the analogous Antisune/Antisune
        combination in the other Z case. What&#x27;s left are the 3-cycle cases.
        I sort of do the following: hold it so that I see both LL face colors on
        the side (holding it on a diagonal), then I look at the edge that needs
        to go opposite where it is now. If it needs to come towards me I think
        &quot;in&quot;, if it needs to go away I think &quot;out&quot;. Next I
        make note of how many of those two edges in front are out of place. So I
        would call them &quot;in1&quot;,&quot;in2&quot;,&quot;out1&quot;,
        &quot;out2&quot;. The nice thing about this way of thinking about it is
        that the &quot;in&#x27;s&quot; are the same alg but inverse and so are
        the &quot;out&#x27;s&quot;. I use a Sune/Sune combination for my
        &quot;out1&quot; case, and an Antisune/Antisune combination for my
        &quot;out2&quot; case. I started incorporating this into my solves right
        after WC. The &quot;in&quot; cases I have yet to learn, seeing as I have
        a terrible alg for it. The non-3cycle ones I have been actively using
        since b4 Toronto, so I have mastered those. I am curious aobut your
        naming scheme here. -Doug > L - BR > LB > > O/A = R U2 R U R2 U R&#x27;

        I typically run it in a command shell/prompt in windowsXP. To copy I
        right-click, click Mark, highlight the stuff I want, and then hit enter.

        Hi, Yes sorry, I didnt think that people would pay much attention to the
        names. The scheme is very simple, to determine the case you look at the
        coll case which you have (and I use Ron&#x27;s scheme to determine the
        coll) Then you need to identify the 12 sub-cases using the edges. x/y
        means you would look at FU and FUR stickers/RUF and RU stickers, and
        compare them to one another. C means the colours match, O means
        opposite, and A means adajcent. There is a more detailed description on
        my ZB pages where the algs for the T orient are. This is nice because it
        breaks every step down into recognising a pattern. I&#x27;m not sure
        exactly what I am going to do for the cases where there are 4 twisted
        corners... but we&#x27;ll cross that bridge when we come to it :)
        Perhaps all we need to do is look at a different sticker. Sorry this
        post is pretty vague, but it&#x27;s late and I want to go to bed,
        getting up early to fly to Hungary tomorrow! Dan :) - team[zb] :D --- In

        I see... the last time I checked your ZB pages they wheren&#x27;t up yet
        so I guess I&#x27;ll have to look at them sometime. The H1 case is nice,
        it only has 4 algs to learn and two of them are related (swap the first
        and second half of the alg). I think recognition for these are the
        easiest of all the ZBLL no CP cases. For the Pi1 cases, I first look if
        the edge between &quot;the pair&quot; (in bld lingo) is in place or not
        and then grip it as necessary. Though I must admit that the recognition
        is very difficult here. I take 3s to figure it out, but I&#x27;ve only
        recently learned these. In fact I forgot them all this morning, lol. The
        only confusing one (although really confusing) for me is the 3 edge
        cycle cases where it&#x27;s 1 alg for 4 distinct cases. -Doug --- In

        I got a LL skip yesterday. 18.75 was the time, but I used ZBF2L. This is
        only the second time I have ever gotten one of these. Even though the
        F2L was very slow, it was rewarding to know that I had 8 times larger of
        a chance of this happening because of what I am practicing. It was fun.

        Hey everyone, Here was my sunday contest: 16.37, 18.20, 22.82, 18.95,
        17.50, 21.36, 16.16, (15.00), 17.87, 21.42, 18.89, (48.32) = 18.95 The
        18.20, 21.36, 17.87 were T ZBLL orientation cases. I&#x27;m not happy
        that I had a huuuuuuuuge delay on recognizing each one :-( Also the
        48.32 was a ZBF2L case that I forgot, and then I got a U case ZBLL that
        I knew but messed up the alg and had to start over. :-( Not very happy,
        but hoping to do better next week. :-( Hope everyone else had a better
        Sunday contest experience, Chris

        Of course, for the 2x2, you would simply ignore slices and double-layer
        turns become normal layer-turns. Hence, when I use COLL for the 2x2, the

        distracting yourself and taking short breaks between solves helps you to

        suppose that will have to wait until next week. Motivation to learn
        more, I guess. I still delay bigtime on a few of the easy case 1 cases
        with two wrongly flipped edges in the U layer, and even when I can do
        them intuitively with no pauses, they&#x27;re slow cases with grip

        Hey everyone, I recently have been having some doubts about ZB, which I
        would prefer not to be having, but I wanted to bring them up. I recently
        met with Dan Knights and asked him what he thought about ZB. His
        response was, for the most part, that it seemed like a good method but
        that recognition seems that it would be a big problem. I also have
        noticed that I still delay quite a bit using the block method for my
        ZBLL cases. I&#x27;m at a dilemma. I have been talking with lots of
        people about Fridrich after the 2005RWC and have found lots of really
        useful ways to drop my average. I even think now that I could get sub-15
        with Fridrich were I to just implement all the changes that I should
        implement. Also though, I really am curious about the potential for ZB.
        I know that if I don&#x27;t try it out myself, knowing all or at least
        almost all of it, my curiosity of whether or not it is a worthwhile
        method would eventually drive me insane. So I&#x27;m stuck. I have two
        methods that both require quite a bit of work to learn/master and only
        24 hours in a day. How can we balance these methods? Should I extend my
        goal to learning ZB for another year or two and learn at a slower pace,
        and also practice Fridrich half the time? Also, after talking with Dan I
        think we really are underestimating the problem of recognition. I think
        we need to develop several methods for recognizing each case. Be able to
        recognize from any angle, etc. I really think just saying &quot;oh and
        look at the case to reconize&quot; will not work. We need to turn ZBF2L
        and ZBLL recognition into a science. I am going to post pictures of all
        my algs from all 4 angles for all my ZBLL algs. I will make a page for
        recognition at every angle since I believe just recognizing at one will
        not work to master this method. The more I think about it, the harder
        this method will be to master, and the more I want to learn it :-) So
        anyway, I think we have grossly and terribly underestimated the problem
        of recognition. I think at a bare minimum we all need to recognize ZBF2L
        and ZBLL from any angle, and ZBF2L done in any F2L slot. So I&#x27;m
        trying to find a balance, but there is so much to do and so little free
        time in a day :-( Any help whatsoever would be appreciated, I just want
        to stay motivated. Chris

        Hm... Whenever I do an average of 500, I either learn something new
        (small f2l trick or trigger), and I almost always break some kind of
        record in a category (average of 100, average of 10, single, the avg of
        500, or something, etc.). When I do these long sessions (in a single
        sitting or 2), I learn which last layer algs do not work for me, and
        which algs I need to work on. To simply put it out, I am still
        &quot;mastering&quot; Fridrich f2l and last layer, and I think there is
        yet much improvement to be made on the current system. However, I
        believe zb, with extensive practice and training, can lead to similar
        results, in a sense that with enough experience in mind, the system
        itself will become a &quot;no brainer,&quot; but I think it will take
        much longer (atleast for me) to understand zb like I do Fridrich. I have
        done sub 14 times with full zb, and these times in particular were much
        _easier_ to obtain than a sub 14 fridrich time- and I think this will be
        the general ideal, (on average of course). A smoother and slower zb
        solve can get a &quot;super fast moving&quot; fridrich time, in other
        words. As far as recoginition goes, I do believe it goes beyond just
        &quot;oh look at this and execute.&quot; It does need to be refined (to
        be a &quot;science,&quot; if you will), for it&#x27;s much more
        advanced. I think reaching new levels, one can be comfortable with the
        recognition. Thousands of solves will be required to picture the last
        laer cases as a whole (like I do with fridrich last layer), but yes I do
        believe it is possible. I&#x27;m not just saying this; I decided to do a
        few 24 hour marathons using ONLY ZB (on my own in my room, of course-
        not for records) once I know full ZB, and the purpose of this will be to
        conquer the recognition hurdles with the known cases. Sure, the cases
        would be learned, but recognizing them is a different story... When it
        comes to me, I learn all the necessary cases for the system to be full,
        then I practice like crazy; that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m approaching zb,
        atleast. That&#x27;s me. Though I don&#x27;t think I will know zb by
        2007, I do believe I will know it in the course of a couple years. This
        is only my opinion, and I could be wrong, but that&#x27;s how I see it.
        I&#x27;ve put a lot of thought into this as well. -Brent M --- cmhardw

        Hey everyone, After reading Brent&#x27;s last post I decided to really
        start refining my recognition. What I have been doing is to do
        transformation solves, but only allow myself to see two sides to
        recognize the ZBLL. I do not allow AUF (adjust U face) turns either. It
        sometimes takes me as much as 2-3 minutes to recognize one case, but I
        am learning new things. I think the goal should be to, like Fridrich,
        recognize by looking at only 2 faces (I think mastery will recquire no
        less). I am not going to time myself for ZB for quite some time (except
        the sunday contest of course, since I don&#x27;t want to completely
        atrophy my recognition) and just work on these identify using two sides
        only recognition for the T case. I also do not want to learn any new
        algs for a while. I will probably finish my current COLL case, but I
        want to recognize the T case perfectly before moving on. Also, I can let
        this be a microcosm of what the other cases will be like. After I can
        recognize the T case using only two sides I want to work on averages
        with transformations, since I think that would show how fast ZB can be
        (just ignore the average it takes me to do the transformation alg for
        comparison). Anyway, I think this will extend my time to learn ZB to
        beyond three years, but I would rather be working on mastering ZBLL than
        just learning algs and have horrible delays in the future. I don&#x27;t
        know if this is the best strategy, but I am also using the T cases to
        see if I think this will work for the other orientation cases. Let me
        know what you all think, does this seem like a good idea? I&#x27;d
        rather not totally commit until I think it might work. I supppose I will
        take 2-3 months to work on nothing but T ZBLL recognition. That will be
        about 8 months of working on just 1 OLL case. So I could extrapolate
        that time to the total amount of algs. I&#x27;m setting two side
        recognition as my goal though, I want to master this system, and I think
        2 side recognition will be required for that. And I can&#x27;t even do
        COLL with only two sides yet lol, but I am learning how to since
        I&#x27;ve started practicing this. Aaaaah so much to do, I hope it is
        worth it. Chris

        I haven&#x27;t actually thought about it too much. However I would like
        to point out that the S-Orientation cases and the Pi-Orientation cases
        are so rediculously hard to recognize... T- Orientation recognition is a
        breeze for me now, as are many of the L- Orientation (*with CP*). The
        recogniton differs widely for ZBLL. For people that use the block
        method, the more solved corners there are (say for T,U,L Orientaitons,
        and PLL), the easier it would be to get information from the blocks
        quickly. A couple years ago I started using pattern recognition for CLL
        and COLL, this has helped a lot, but even without it, recognizing by CP
        then CO was really fast for me. This was becuase I had been practicing
        it for very long. With enough practice the recognition should become
        second nature. As for balence, I&#x27;d say, don&#x27;t learn too much
        too fast. Take an estimate of the ratio of what you have mastered to
        what you know. I define what I mastered to be stuff that I have actively
        and fully incorporated into my solving without delays. I keep this value
        over 96% always. I know that for instance Hardwick is far from no-delays
        on what he knows of the T5 and T6 cases. I think this is bad... at a
        certain point one should stop learning new things and stablize in
        solving and especially in times. Lately I have found lots of 31s-44s
        times. I get a lot of sub-18 times as well. What ZB does, *especially if
        you don&#x27;t fully master COLL first* is increase one&#x27;s SD
        significantly. The rule of thumb I use (got it from Jon) is that your SD
        should be at about 2s. If it is over that then you need to figure out
        what your doing wrong to get rid of those high outliers. If your SD is
        under 1.7 then you are not taking enough risks. By risks I mean that for
        instance I will do part of recognition and b4 being totally sure of the
        case, I&#x27;ll begin an algorithm. By knowing the probabilities well
        enough instinctively, my average will be lowered this way. As for
        motivation, that always comes right after I get back from a competition.
        Every competition I do BLD solves on the plane trip home, something I
        typically dred doing. I am very motivated to get faster and learn new
        things. For me it is finding the balence between learning new techniques
        and getting faster times. I learn new things and get to do more exotic
        things when I solve slowly, even taking back moves occasioanlly. I get
        faster by practicing at full speed. rarely do I go full speed though, I
        would hate to have an injury that prevents me from going about my daily
        school life or typing. Chris: I think that if you feel overwhelmed by
        the influx of new algs, to stop learning for a while. Work on hte new
        Fridrich techniques you takled about. A change of pace is good. As for
        me I have a lot of problems in my solving. I pre-inspect for alot of
        things. First I see if it&#x27;s a very easy cross. If so I check for
        extended cross. If not I check the locations fo the 4 middle edges for
        my F2L method and then pre-inspect further. In some cases I would go
        about a Petrus solve or a Gilles method solve. I use a lot of
        methodology in my solving. My times would probaly be much faster if I
        quit doing that, but it would be less fun. I like getting to see all
        sorts of new things during a sitting, like Brent does. A big problem is
        that for the same CLL/COLL case, I might do the CLL with LL on D and
        COLL with LL on U. Also, most of my ELL&#x27;s are still with LL on F or
        LL on D. I re-grip the hell out of it during my solves. This is a big
        problem I need to sort out if I want to be competitive again. If I go
        with a Fridrich cross start, then (like Jessica) I hold my cross on L.
        Learning ZBF2L with LL on U has added extra difficulty to my solving. I
        decided not to learn anything new for a few months. My S1 cases are
        coming along nicely, but Pi1 is a total disaster. I use that popular
        6-turn oLL a lot, but I do it with on D... this is hampering my Pi1 and
        S1 cases (most of them can be done with compositions of this alg). Half
        my ELL&#x27;s are with LL on D.... I would need to spend 4 months
        converting... *sigh* At least I can consistantly get under 25s... What
        would you do if you where me? (last time I asked this question someone

        In reply to all: I think this is the dilemma: Fridrich, while averaging
        more moves and having less potential for speed with full mastery, is
        much, much easier to implement. It is a simple and efficient solution.
        ZB averages far fewer moves, but has the nasty side effect of incredibly
        difficult recognition. It is much, much harder to fully incorporate into
        solving. In the end, I think the best possible scenario would be a
        hybrid of the two systems. One that could offer fewer cases (which
        provides easier recognition) and has the potential for fewer moves than
        standard Fridrich. Like I&#x27;ve mentioned a few times before, there
        are four distinct possibilities for using the last c/e pair to influence
        your last layer. Orient edges Permute edges Orient corners Permute
        corners Orienting corners has the most cases by a long shot. I think to
        learn how to orient all the corners is 27 possible cases for whichever
        way you insert them. Taking that a step further, learning to orient
        edges and corners with the last pair is 432 cases, including
        reflections, just using case 1 insertions. This is only 126 cases more
        than ZBF2L. This reduces the entire last layer to a PLL case. That makes
        for 432+21=453 cases for the method, which is just over half of
        what&#x27;s required for ZB, and your PLL cases are all easy to
        recognize. Again, though, whichever step you place more burden on, the
        harder recognition for that step will be. The option that I think could
        be most promising, though I haven&#x27;t found a reliable way to do it
        yet, would be orienting edges and permuting corners together. This would
        give you a ZB case with no corner permutation for your last step,
        significantly easing recognition (not to mention the number of required
        algs). However, it&#x27;s 112 cases for the c/e pair for whichever case
        you want to learn. I would imagine at least 1 and 13, making for 224+99
        possible LL cases=323 cases. Much better than 797 for full ZB. Again,
        just some thoughts, but I&#x27;m fairly convinced full ZB will be too
        difficult to recognize under pressure consistently, at least without
        years and years of practice. -Mike team [zb]

        Well, I am still quite new to learning ZB and I have not even begun to
        learn ZBLL, but for ZBF2L, it seems very very easy. I still get some
        amnesia, but the ZBF2L I have learned so far (just under 50%) has been
        quite easy to learn (both learning algs and recognition). I think with
        enough practice, ZBF2L will be require no more recognition time than
        Fridrich F2L and as little as .5 second additional time for execution.
        This would require looking ahead during the 3rd pair, but that is
        something that should definitely be practiced. As Chris mentioned, this
        will also require doing ZBF2L into any slot, though I think that is
        something that will not require an insane amount of additional work
        (only a crazy amount). :) I won&#x27;t offer any ideas about ZBLL
        recognition yet because I haven&#x27;t begun to think about it, but I do
        not think it will be required to recognize any case from seeing only two
        sides to &quot;master&quot; ZB. Maybe to become as proficient in it as
        possible, it might, but I don&#x27;t even do this for Fridrich. I know I
        am not a very fast Fridrich solver, but I have a 5-6 second LL using my
        recognition system, and it is my 14-15 second F2L that keeps me from
        getting more sub-20 averages. ;) I have several ideas for ZBLL
        recognition based on the little that I know, but I haven&#x27;t done a
        thorough analysis of cases yet to see if any of them will work. ~ Bob

        > > What changes do you need to implement with Fridrich? > Hey David,
        I&#x27;ve been thinking about a number of things. Here are the ones I
        want to learn most 1) go fast-fast - Though people advocate slow-fast, I
        think for 15.xx and faster times you have to just go really really fast.
        I&#x27;ve only averaged sub-16 twice, but both times I tried to
        literally go as fast as possible and just hope I would recognize.
        I&#x27;m trying to get good at going faster during F2L, yet still
        recognize. 2) Master using Xcross and opposite cross - If I can get my
        odds for using Xcross up to 33%, and I am equally as comfortable solving
        either white or yellow, then my odds for an Xcross are the odds for
        getting either a white or yellow Xcross. If each face is 33% then I have
        a 1-(2/3)^2=5/9=55.56% chance of getting an Xcross. And what&#x27;s
        better is the more I learn for Xcross, the more often I can solve with
        it on both faces rather than just one. 3) flow - Macky talks about this
        a lot, I try to always follow each move with the next one that flows
        best. I may choose a longer F2L alg just since the shorter one
        doesn&#x27;t flow well, etc.. 4) learn new algs for my slow cases - some
        of my algs stink, and I just simply need to not be lazy and fix them. 5)
        belive I can do it - I took an average today that was 16.04 seconds with
        a +2 penalty on one of my counting solves. Had it not been +2, it would
        have been a new pb average record. All I did different is to just think,
        &quot;I&#x27;m better than [insert my previous goals, ideas of what a
        good time is, etc.] and this average will show that.&quot; I think a lot
        of cubing is in our heads. Just stop telling yourself that your current
        good times are good enough, but that 1 second faster is a what a good
        time is. If you change your view like this, you will try harder to
        achieve your new good times. You don&#x27;t have to go overboad, just
        drop your current good times by 0.5 second or no higher than 1.0 second
        and see what happens. Just my $0.02 of course, Chris

        I think another great way to get better situations and easier solves is
        to get used to block solving, like you do with X-cross. I think it can
        be much more efficient than 100% cross/4 pairs. There are really good
        odds for at least 1 pair being matched up to start with, and inserting a
        cross edge before the last pair is generally not hard at all. Also, in
        keeping with the &#x27;be flexible to get easier solves&#x27; theme, I
        decided to take some averages with the Roux method, which is incredibly
        fast if you like slice moves. Even without learning the advanced final
        step, without any of the easy optimizations for the hardest cases, and
        using slower COLL instead of CLL, I managed as low as a 21.33 average. I
        think I may finish off learning my current ZBF2L case and work strictly
        on learning the optimizations and the more advanced recognition step for
        the final six edges. If that goes well over the next few days, I may
        even learn the rest of the ELL&#x27;s, just for the times it comes up
        with the whole F2L. I&#x27;m trying to think of a way to apply some sort
        of technique to finish more than just one step at a time for the end of
        solve approach, but I can&#x27;t seem to find anything promising. The
        best I can think of is to try to find the number of cases to learn for
        placing all six U+M edges at once after they&#x27;re correctly oriented.
        Can someone help me work out the number of possible combinations for
        when there are 1x3x4 blocks on the sides, all four U layer corners
        correct, and the final 6 edges and centers oriented? I&#x27;d really
        like to know, to see if this is a strategy worth pursuing. Granted,
        I&#x27;m very tired at the moment, but the number I keep working it out
        to is 96, which seems quite doable, especially considering the length of
        the algs, which I would imagine to be rather short. All U and M turns,
        as well. -Mike team [zb]

        Ignoring the solved case and counting mirrors together but inverses
        distinct... First off, I looked at the number of totally distinct cases,
        that&#x27;d be 6!/2 = 360. Exploiting two planes of symmetry that gives
        90 cases while exploiting 4 planes of symmetry gives 15 cases. But that
        was just to get a rough estimate so that I know that my answer is going
        to be between 14 and 79. Some cases are self-mirrors that shouldn&#x27;t
        be counted twice and some cases have more or less symmetry than
        others... a bit of a mess trying to apply Burnside&#x27;s Lemma on. So
        then I broke it up into categories: There are 8 cases involving a 5-edge
        cycle. There are 7 cases involving a 4-edge cycle and a 2-edge cycle.
        There are 6 cases involving two disjoint 3-edge cycles. There are 4
        cases involving a single 3-edge cycle. There are 6 cases involving two
        disjoint 2-edge cycles. There is the solved case. Thus I conclude that
        there are 31 cases not counting the solved case. Also 3 of the algs
        needed are from PLL, so it&#x27;s really only 28 algs to memorize, some
        of which maybe inverse of each other. That is a quick count, nothing
        rigorous... see if you can find any flaws in my reasoning. -Doug --- In

        Hey all... I actually had this weird dream in which somebody suggested
        to me that I slow down because I&#x27;m learning too much too fast and
        that my times will slow down too much if I continue to learn. I thought
        this was very very strange, but I am going to keep on learning anyway.

        only 31 cases+inverses and mirrors, I would be very interested in
        learning them. Especially considering how many of those I know already,
        like the 3 PLL&#x27;s and the 3 cases permuting M slice pieces only.

        makes more sense to list the probability for a 1 look LL, as opposed to
        the percentage of algs known, because the probability has some practical
        application. I just ammended my entry. The only real problem is that
        I&#x27;m not really certain the probabilities on some of them. I think
        my new entry more accurately reflects the probabilities now. I have a 6%
        or so chance for just a PLL after my F2L, based on some corner
        orientation. This will be a good way to track everyone&#x27;s progress.
        I suppose I should go learn some more ZBF2L... -Mike team [zb]

        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been working on just transformation solves
        lately, and have not been timing myself. I&#x27;m trying to learn to
        recognize the T cases without having to AUF. It&#x27;s awesome, I&#x27;m
        actually getting to the point where I can recognize fairly quickly cases
        5 and 6 without evening having to AUF. I haven&#x27;t timed myself yet,
        but I think my delays are getting shorter. I&#x27;m also getting more
        comfortable at recognizing the cases I&#x27;m already comfortable with,
        but without AUF at first. Once I can comfortably identify without having
        to adjust the U face, I&#x27;m going top get started with the U algs
        again. I was getting discouraged at how hard this might be, but with
        more practice it is getting easier! Heh heh ZB is such a roller coaster
        sometimes, but it&#x27;s still fun! Chris Team [ZB]

        Correction: +mirrors only, I counted inverses separately. I can generate
        the algs and give an average move statistic on this using ACube. It
        would take ACube less than 1 minute on my newest machine to generate. It

        contest. About time. The 16.33 was a PLL skip using COLL, the 14.72 was
        a 3 edge cycle after ZBF2L, and the 18.16 was an OLL skip with ZBF2L. SD
        = 2.02 Team [ZB] The first 22&#x27;s both had bad crosses and the last
        solve I messed up the ZBF2L. The first two solves were both the same
        COLL case, which I just changed algs on last night. >:P I&#x27;ve got
        very little work this week, so I think I may try to finish off as much
        ZBF2L as I can, and maybe change a few more COLL&#x27;s to faster ones.
        I would like to have all of them well under 3 seconds on average, and
        most of them less. I know I looked up during one of my 21&#x27;s and saw
        I finished the F2L in about 14, which means I had a 7 second LL. Not

        Just to check in: Using straight COLL+PLL/ZBLL when appropriate I got my
        best average ever. I&#x27;ve finally broken 18 seconds, though just
        barely. 17.98 = 16.94, 18.86, 16.02, 18.12, 18.84, 18.30, 19.41, 20.22,

        still beating kind of hard. What a rush. The 14.92 was an OLL skip with
        some corner orientation control, and it landed me with a nice counter
        clockwise 3 cycle for the PLL. The 16.12 at the end was an L orientation
        ZB case I know, and one of the other 16&#x27;s was a PLL skip. I was

        Hey Chris, I was wondering what your opinion would be for an
        &quot;advanced&quot; Team BLD technique. It would be based around ZB.
        The first 3 pairs would be the same. Then for the 4th pair, for example,
        instead of C3, you could say C3 bad front, to indicate that all edges
        are flipped correctly except the front one. This would give a ZBF2L with
        almost no added cost (since the solves are longer, the small fraction of
        added recognition becomes less significant). Then you can call COLL for
        the next step. What I&#x27;m ultimately curious about, is if it would be
        possible to assign a simple system that you could use to distinguish
        among any case and easily decide what algorithm to use for full ZB. Any

        began trying team blindsolving in Orlando, we used OLL+PLL. Now,
        she&#x27;s learning COLL, and I&#x27;m already much faster with it than
        PLL. Because we recognize cases the &#x27;crazy&#x27; non-sticker way,
        it&#x27;s easy to explain the case. You can give a side that the two
        corners that need to switch are on, diagonal, or all correct, which is
        just the orientation. However, I&#x27;m not sure how you could explain
        the ZB alg very well. There are 12 sub-cases within each COLL case. I
        don&#x27;t know how you would hope to distinguish between them verbally.
        ZBF2L is very helpful, though. Especially when you can get OLL skips out
        of it. I think it&#x27;s definitely something worth pursuing.

        categorization probably. Learned a lot of team BLD codes too... what a
        pity the closest person to me is JonM and he&#x27;s 5 hrs away. Though
        he doesn&#x27;t seem like the type to be into team BLD. Oh and
        ther&#x27;s this BenK guy, but I&#x27;ve never really meant him. Hem...
        I do know Chris&#x27;s ZBLL naming/code convention as well now. Though I
        pool all the inverses together: T1 and U1 are the same thing to me, as
        are A and AS cases, as are T3 and T4, etc. Speaking of which I am
        avoiding learning the T3/T4 cases. I think those will be one of the last
        of ZBLL I want to learn, the COLL is just so fast... For me next up is
        the Heise-subset... the portion of ZBLL where the edges are solved
        (About two per COLL category, but many of them non- standard COLL.).

        So forcing myself to go through and do weighted case counts has really
        boosted my confidence. I have nearly a 1/3 chance of full out ZB. I now
        expect this, if I get a few that are not ZB, I know that (law of
        averages), it will happen on my next solve or soemthing. It feels really
        great... even though my average in practice is still about 24s (same as
        3 years ago, lol). I just have to work on the rest of my solving: cross
        and the first 3 c/e pairs. I am relatively new at cross starting, and
        not even fully committed to it yet. I have also been trying to learn the
        remaining ZBF2Ls sporatically again, and I realize that my intuitive
        reductions for them are actually optimal (for speed, comparing with
        LarsV&#x27;s sheets and Chris&#x27;s). This combined with partial cross
        techniques has really helped my confidence. Back in the day, I used to
        be afraid of public cubing becuse, what if everything goes wrong... I
        get worst case senarios at every step, with lockups, and doing the wrong
        alg. The time could be over a minute easily. But now even if I lock up
        badly I know to remain calm. I can perform all my algs slowly and nearly
        all of them I can call out turn-by- turn. I can direct solve things to
        correct something. It&#x27;s like I have an instant undo button where my
        hands just know what my last few turns where and I don&#x27;t even have
        to think about it. I learned a few U5 cases and a U3/U4 case today. The
        bad thing is that I&#x27;m starting to forget a lot of my T1/U1.... they
        are just so darn similar. Well just an update to get conversation
        started, cuz I don&#x27;t like how quite this place is. -Doug

        It says this right on the page: &quot;After the &quot;pair-up&quot;
        stage, there are only 32 possible configurations of the pair and the LL
        edge-orientation. These are broken down into 2 groups of 16 cases, 1
        group of connected pairs, and 1 group of seperated pairs. So if you know
        just 32 little tricks, you can almost always flip the LL edges to your
        advantage after the F2L. If you are unlucky you will have a case for
        which your algorithm isn&#x27;t a simple pair up and insert, and in
        these cases it is very awkward to do anything about it. That is where

        Hey David, Here are the ZBF2L algs that pair up those cases into a 3

        Sorry for not reading more carefully. :) Dan acknowledges that the

        learn more ZBF2L algs. Short of that, would it be useful in these
        difficult cases to first flip the edges and then solve the last pair
        using two-generator algs? Or am I better off just reverting to OLL? Or

        just hurts me to look up during a solve and see that I have a fantastic
        F2L and still be hampered by a slow LL to wind up with a 20+ solve.
        Besides that, I know that the LL is where most of the moves in a solve
        are saved, and that using VH+some corner control is helping to make up
        for not knowing full ZBF2L. -Mike team [zb]

        Ok. I&#x27;ve calculated some odds and come up with a new gameplan. 1/27
        solves (~3.7%)of the time (or more, with a little corner orienting) you
        get an OLL skip and have a PLL for ZBLL. 26/27 solves you get a COLL
        case. Of those 26, 1/6 have corners correctly permuted. Learning the ZB
        cases for those gives a 16% chance for a 1 look. Add these together for
        just under 20% chance. Now factor in the 1/12 chance for the other 5/6
        of the 26/27 that COLL still gives you. That&#x27;s an additional 6.7%,
        for a grand total of about 26.5% chance of a 1 look LL, and at only the
        number of algs required for COLL, PLL, and the correct corner ZB cases,
        of which I think there are about 66. However, 7 of these you will
        already know from COLL, so 59 + 40 + 21 = 120 cases to learn, of which i
        know 65. 55 to go. (4 of those are PLL&#x27;s... :P) -Mike team [zb]

        VHF2L + COLL was meant to be a stepping stone towards the full ZB. With
        it, you would learn some indirect ZBF2L, and of course some ZBLL algs
        (the one&#x27;s that are COLL&#x27;s). So the fact that you would have
        to learn some ZBF2L algorithms to cover the cases which you don&#x27;t
        use pair up and insert for only helps this process along :) > I&#x27;ve

        case, you might end up with the 1 in 12 skip. Or of course it could go

        Hi Mike, I use 2 tricks which I now see simultaneously, but this didnt
        come with lots of practice! First I locate the only connected pair of
        stickers around the side of the top layer. At the same time, I look
        around the other side to see whether the two stickers around the corner
        are adjacent to one another, or opposite to one another (or you could
        say I identify it as one of C/A C/O O/C or A/C). This is enough to
        determine the permutation. With a bit of practice you will get the hang
        of seeing whether it is a &quot;left hand&quot; G, or a &quot;right
        hand&quot; G. So now you&#x27;ve broken it into two possibilities. Next
        you use the opposite or adjacent trick to identify which of the 2 it is,
        and once you know this you then know exactly where to hold the block of
        two connected stickers. It seems a lot when I explain it all but it
        really is a split second decision! For my algorithms I have a different
        starting point for each one, so it makes the algs a little less similar
        than they otherwise could be. So if it was a left hand G, and the
        stickers were opposite, I hold the two connected stickers at LFU and LU.
        If they were opposite, then I hold the stickers at FU and FRU If it was
        a right hand G, and stickers are opposites, then they go at RFU and RU.
        And if adjacent, then they go at BRU and BU. Remember that the first
        letter in the three letter sticker code denotes the face the sticker is
        on :) Hope this helps a bit! Dan :) --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi Bob, No, I haven&#x27;t learned any of ZBF2L, apart from knowing a
        few tricks which I learned before ZBF2L was even heard of. I am a firm
        believer in the fact that to learn a giant amount of cases you need to
        chop it up into fine chunks. The way I learn is all about building
        pathways and extending out from what I already know, so I think that the
        most logical extension of VHF2L in the direction of ZBF2L is to learn
        the set of algorithms which covers first the case which I can&#x27;t use
        VHF2L for (my algorithm for the F2L case is U2 R2 U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R
        U&#x27; R2) - and then begin learning the ones which cover the most
        yucky cases. You are right to say that the C/E pair trapped in the F2L
        is a great place to start also, but for me it&#x27;s not as useful
        because I almost always break the pair up while solving another pair
        first, and using the slot as an empty slot. So I don&#x27;t have these
        cases very often at all. In fact, I&#x27;m sure they can always be
        avoided, and give you less ZBF2L algorithms to learn. But that&#x27;s
        only speculation on my part :) Dan :) --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com,

        I think that the reason he sugguests learning the trapped ZBF2L cases is
        that there are so few. It only took me 2-4 days to learn. (I am assuming

        That took me a few reads to understand, so allow me to explain another
        approach to this problem. I use this method and I believe many other PLL
        users also do. But just to warn you, it is tailored towards a specific
        choice of G-Perm algs. First, I determine that it is indeed a G-Perm by
        readily ruling out everything else according to the location of
        &quot;blocks&quot; (c/e pairs). Assuming it is a G-Perm, I hold
        &quot;the pair&quot; (typical teamBld lingo for the two corners that are
        correct relative to each other), on the left. It is personal preference
        whether to just re-grip, or pre- adjust U and re-grip. Next (or really,
        at the same time) find &quot;the block&quot; (there should be precisely
        one and it should be on the r-layers). It can either be on the back,
        &quot;upper right&quot;, &quot;lower right&quot;, or front. (This is
        then sometimes numbered G1,G2,G3,G4, respectively for teamBld calls.) If
        the block is on the back (UB+uBR), I start with the (R2u&#x27;) trigger.
        If it is on the &quot;upper right&quot; (UBR+UR), I start with a
        (R&#x27;U&#x27;R) trigger. If it is on the &quot;lower right&quot;
        (UR+uFR), I start with a (RUR&#x27;) trigger. If the block is on the
        front (uFR+UF), I start with the (R2&#x27;u) trigger. Notice the
        symmetry in this method. *Gosh, I do hope you use similar algs... -Doug

        Cycling Three Corners &amp; Three Edges Though these look th= e
        trickiest to recognize, they are actually quite simple. I first AUF to

        of the right, or clos= e part of the right, I know whether to apply #14,

        at high speeds, even though it looks the most confusing. = Algorithms
        #14-#17 are all performed somewhat similarly because they have s= ome

        modification to this algorithm to make it flow a l= ot nicer. It is
        quite easy to perform with a little practice. 16 2.567 = (R&#x27;
        U&#x27; R) y (R2&#x27; u R&#x27; U) (R U&#x27; R u&#x27; R2&#x27;) This

        Hey Dan, I also try to avoid the last pair connected in the F2L slot but
        not flipped right, even though I can use the ZB alg for it. I&#x27;ve
        found that it&#x27;s faster even when I see that case early on, to still
        use that slot as an empty slot and do whatever otehr ZBF2L comes up than
        to know which case that slot is, save for last, and just do ZBF2L. The
        reason I learned them first though, is that I didn&#x27;t know any
        VHF2L. So what I did was to just pair up the pieces and place at least
        one of them into it&#x27;s slot. That way I knew the ZBF2L way to
        finish. It was sort of my pseudo-VH way of doing ZBF2L. The cases where
        both pieces are in the F2L slot but the slot is not solved are mostly
        slow for me, except for a few which are very very fast. So I try to
        avoid them since a larger proportion of them are slow for me than just
        all the rest of the ZBF2Ls. I do still use those cases though if the
        last pair is one of them. I just try to avoid them if I can. Just my two
        cents, Chris --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dan&quot;

        Hey Brent, I did the following to find an alg: 1) Look at
        Zbigniew&#x27;s algs and see if I like one. If yes I&#x27;m done. 2) If
        no to above I use ACube and see if I like one. If yes I&#x27;m done. If
        no I compare all my options (including Lars) and pick the best one.
        Always 3) Compare my alg to Lars V&#x27;s alg and see he a) we use the
        same or b) I like his better than mine. Hope that helps, Chris P.S.
        There often were 2-3 algs that were really really good, but I chose the
        one I liked best. This happened a lot with Zbigniew&#x27;s algs, so
        don&#x27;t just stop at mine, his are really good usually too. P.P.S.
        Sometimes Zbigniew&#x27;s algs were horrible, but that&#x27;s just
        because the case is horrible. I recommend ACube for something Sub-
        optimal but with lots of FUF or RUR conjugates type moves. P.P.P.S

        i do have a question on the zbf2l algs though- how did Chris find them?
        a program? i know i found some on my own, but i&#x27;m not sure i could
        find all of them on my own in a sufficient amount of time... was a
        program used? (ron&#x27;s sticker prog i would guess). but i don&#x27;t

        Hey everyone, I just took some ZB and Fridrich averages and am kind of
        surprised by the results. It seems, I&#x27;m sure also due to committing
        fully to opposite color also, that my Fridrich times have dropped by a
        second while my ZB times have remained roughly the same, if not slightly
        slower than I used to get. Here were the average: 1) Done with Fridrich
        (12.45), 17.54, 18.82, (19.09), 15.76, 15.16, 18.19, 16.05, 14.95,
        18.19, 15.15, 16.46 = 16.63 It&#x27;s weird that 12.xx was my first
        solve of the day too, it wasn&#x27;t a preplanned &quot;hey I&#x27;ll
        start with that 12!&quot; 2) Next one with ZB 18.44, 20.96, (26.09),
        (13.85), 15.32, 18.02, 18.15, 17.36, 21.40, 18.02, 19.67, 17.92 = 18.53
        3) And next one with Fridrich 16.82, 14.90, 17.96, 17.52, 15.71,
        (14.63), (20.35), 16.96, 14.96, 15.40, 14.75, 18.18 = 16.32 4) And next
        one again with ZB 15.54, 16.94, (23.56), 16.92, 18.90, (13.47), 22.43,
        21.56, 15.67, 16.26, 17.50, 17.58 = 17.93 (the 13 was a T case ZBLL!!!!!
        Recognition is not always bad!!!) I find it weird that the Fridrich
        averages feel about like my average, or at least thereabouts. Neither
        one felt extraordinarily fast to me. Yet I have definitely been
        neglecting Fridrich lately for ZB, even after WC2005. Why does it seem
        that ZB helps for Fridrich, but not so much the other way around? My ZB
        times are actually slower than a few months ago. I think that could
        either be a) I know more ZBLL cases and need to learn to identify them
        better or b) I have neglected ZB before WC. Anyway I find it very odd
        that not practicing Fridrich.... makes me faster with Fridrich (??).
        However, practicing with Fridrich is painfully slow improvement for me
        by comparison. My only theory is that the larger number of algs for ZB
        will work like a &quot;weighted bat&quot; when switching back to
        Fridrich. Anyway, this makes me think that even if ZBLL recognition is
        too much, that using ZB for practice and Fridrich for competitions will
        make your Fridrich better. Also, why not use ZB for the first rounds of
        a competition and hope for a 1/1944 LL skip? Or maybe a 1/6 super
        awesome easy ZBLL case. I think maybe ZB and Fridrich should coexist and
        one not replace the other. I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of thinking about
        the future of ZB, and I think that were I in a final round of a big
        competition, that I would want a simpler method that is still fast since
        nerves are INTENSE. The final round for the WC was very stressful, and I
        imagine that trying to use ZB there (except for super easy cases) might
        only cause problems. But then again maybe a master of the ZB method
        would identify ZBLL algs from all angles, AUF only once, etc.. Anyway
        just some thoughts, what does everyone think? Chris

        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been doing lots of practicing switching between
        ZB and Fridrich today. My Fridrich averages have definitely gotten much
        faster as of late, and my ZB averages definitely much slower. I think
        I&#x27;ve found the reason too. Because of WC2005 I&#x27;ve been
        thinking in Fridrich mode, which for F2L for me means go as fast as
        absolutely possible while still being able to catch glimpses of pieces
        I&#x27;ll need later. I&#x27;ve found that instead of slow-fast going
        &quot;not quite break neck fast&quot; for F2L gives me better averages.
        Well I noticed that this is influencing my ZBF2L. My ZB solves are
        always really really bad immediately after switching from a really good
        Fridrich average, and then get better. I also tried going what felt like
        &quot;too slow&quot; after doing a good Fridrich average and then my ZB
        times got back down to my usual good range for ZB. So anyway I think
        that ZBF2L, even when mastered, should definitely be done slower than
        Fridrich F2L. I think ZBF2L should be strictly defined as &quot;the 4
        corners and 4 edges of the first layer, the 4 edges of the middle layer,
        and the opposite layer stickers of the last layer edges.&quot; I&#x27;ve
        noticed that by going slower and keeping an idea of how the LL edge
        orientations will end up, or even inserting pairs earlier in the F2L so
        as to keep my LL edges oriented, helps my times a lot. This has me
        thinking though, obviously since ZBF2L requires more moves than Fridrich
        F2L, and by all my experience should be done slower, that means that
        ZBLL has to make up the lost time from ZBF2L. Also recognition is
        clearly going to be an issue, so that time is added as well. That means
        that execution of the ZBLL cases has to overcome that lost time, and
        should be FAST. What I&#x27;ve been thinking lately, and again I am not
        trying to keep a negative attitude about ZB, I think the method is
        brilliant, but I lately I&#x27;ve had some persistent doubts about using
        it in a high pressure situation. I am starting to fall back on my idea
        of using ZB as a first and second round method. Meaning in the first and
        second rounds of a competition you use ZB, which is fast enough to get
        you to the next rounds. However, it also has the added benefit of, much
        more likely than Firdrich, getting a super incredibly easy LL and a
        super fast solve. So you can use ZB to still make it into the next
        rounds, and have the potential to set some incredibly fast solves. Then
        in the final switch back to Fridrich. Fridrich will seem easier at this
        point, and you will be under more stress as well. You will feel as if
        the easier method balances the more stress and hopefully get a burst of
        confidence to help with nerves. Maybe this is the best way to approach
        ZB before mastering it. Obviously if someone with the mind of Kasparov
        were an addicted speedcuber he/she would probably be able to speedcube
        ZB very easily. I imagine with practice most people could do that too.
        So maybe before mastering ZB we should approach it as a slightly slower
        than the main stream methods, that has a greater potential for spike
        superfast times and use it accordingly. Then once people start to master
        it we can rethink its future. What does everyone else think? Chris

        Hey Mike, I also am starting to like this subset of ZBLL quite a bit.
        When I am solving with Fridrich, even if I identify a ZBLL case I know,
        I try to just stick to Fridrich algs and separate the two. However,
        today when doing a Fridrich average I had a no corner perm ZBLL T case
        and just had to do the alg, and it was still a fast solve! Perhaps this
        could be the new &quot;fad&quot; for Fridrich solving. After COLL you
        could learn no corner perm ZBLL cases ;-) Anyway, I think these algs
        will be fine to include into Fridrich solving. I am definitely also
        starting to like your idea to use them very much. Chris

        Hello guys/gals, that&#x27;s interesting. I have been thinking of f2l a
        bit lately, pertaining to Fridrich f2l and ZBf2l. When I take Fridrich
        f2l averages just to see how my f2l is, I average around 8-9 seconds-
        but sometimes I&#x27;m &quot;time aware,&quot; meaning, aware of the
        time and going as fast as I can, as I watch piece by piece, which might
        even be faster than just solving cubes. So this can follow your idea
        here, Chris. Fridrich f2l, fast times for it (atleast for me) include
        going as fast as possible, and seeing each piece and looking ahead (and,
        also, when your hands are &quot;in the mood,&quot; which is a completely
        new idea that sprung to me the other day- i&#x27;ll discuss further in
        the email). Ah, but when I try Zbf2l, I really don&#x27;t understand
        _what&#x27;s_ going on... I go fast, and the algs don&#x27;t match up
        with my style (zbf2l algs require, me atleast, to rotate often, turn D
        and B more often than usual, and is just way wierd). Yeah, for me right
        now, ZBF2L is way slow, and chaotic... I&#x27;ll take this &quot;super
        slow, maybe too slow&quot; idea when I practice more, see if it helps
        me. Another thing, that I found the other day. I think it was last
        Wednesday, I had a good day and was refreshed; I did all my school work
        and was comfortable with myself- I did an average, and I did a 14.52 NOT
        ROLLING average. My hands were &quot;warm&quot; I guess, and things
        seemed &quot;cheery&quot; or something- I really can&#x27;t explain it.
        My average of 60 was still sub 15- then I had to go do something so I
        abandoned it. Then the next day, I did a 17.8 average or something- and
        my hands just &quot;couldn&#x27;t move,&quot; so to speak. This spreads
        to the observation at the WC2005- I was racing a lot of people, since I
        like it :). Like when I was racing Chris/Dan Knights/Joel/Andy C/Ryan
        Patricio/Stefann/others, I pulled a few 12&#x27;s and 13&#x27;s that I
        wouldn&#x27;t have usually done- then, my hands were &quot;in the
        mode&quot; and keeping constant motion during the F2L- which was making
        hte biggest difference. When I was racing Lars V, too, I was
        experiencing this- I was surprised by how fast my hands were moving!
        They were just &quot;in the mood&quot; and warm, I guess. I dunno, just
        something to ponder or observe- the mood of your body and mind when you
        make an average may make the difference. Anyway, I see the possible
        doubts for ZB in full. zbF2l is the biggest nightmare, I agree- I&#x27;m
        making like 16+ zb f2l times, which is crazy. But anyway, sorry for hte
        long email- there is information out there to help us with the F2L
        times, that goes beyond the algs. Human capabilities are much
        underestimated in the matter, i think. ZB full, when the time comes,
        will lead to Master times. but this is only my opinion, and not the
        &quot;actual&quot; answer. -Brent M cmhardw &lt;foozman17@...> wrote:

        Hey Chris, I haven&#x27;t done ANY Fridrich solves in over a month
        (since WC!) but today at the library I did a few on JNetCube just
        because I was bored. The first two solves were sub-20! I had to be
        quiet, too, because I was in the library. Keep in mind I have only one
        sub-20 average EVER. I feel that learning ZB does improve Fridrich. I
        have difficulty going back to Fridrich now, though, because my mind has
        been working purely in the land of ZBF2L, so the most natural thing for
        me now has been do use ZBF2L on the fourth pair. I will use ZBF2L on the
        Sunday contest later tonight to see my progress and hold off on using
        Fridrich until I compete at the Caltech Winter tournament. :) ~ Bob ---

        I have listed the algs for my cases #1-15 + the four basic cases. I
        wrote them all in the notation that demonstrates how I perform the

        thinking of f2l a bit lately, pertaining to Fridrich f2l and ZBf2l. When
        I take Fridrich f2l averages just to see how my f2l is, I average around
        8-9 seconds- but sometimes I&#x27;m &quot;time aware,&quot; meaning,
        aware of the time and going as fast as I can, as I watch piece by piece,
        which might even be faster than just solving cubes. So this can follow
        your idea here, Chris. Fridrich f2l, fast times for it (atleast for me)
        include going as fast as possible, and seeing each piece and looking
        ahead (and, also, when your hands are &quot;in the mood,&quot; which is
        a completely new idea that sprung to me the other day- i&#x27;ll discuss
        further in the email). > Ah, but when I try Zbf2l, I really don&#x27;t
        understand _what&#x27;s_ going on... I go fast, and the algs don&#x27;t
        match up with my style (zbf2l algs require, me atleast, to rotate often,
        turn D and B more often than usual, and is just way wierd). Yeah, for me
        right now, ZBF2L is way slow, and chaotic... I&#x27;ll take this
        &quot;super slow, maybe too slow&quot; idea when I practice more, see if
        it helps me. > Another thing, that I found the other day. I think it was
        last Wednesday, I had a good day and was refreshed; I did all my school
        work and was comfortable with myself- I did an average, and I did a
        14.52 NOT ROLLING average. My hands were &quot;warm&quot; I guess, and
        things seemed &quot;cheery&quot; or something- I really can&#x27;t
        explain it. My average of 60 was still sub 15- then I had to go do
        something so I abandoned it. Then the next day, I did a 17.8 average or
        something- and my hands just &quot;couldn&#x27;t move,&quot; so to
        speak. This spreads to the observation at the WC2005- I was racing a lot
        of people, since I like it :). Like when I was racing Chris/Dan
        Knights/Joel/Andy C/Ryan Patricio/Stefann/others, I pulled a few
        12&#x27;s and 13&#x27;s that I wouldn&#x27;t have usually done- then, my
        hands were &quot;in the mode&quot; and keeping constant motion during
        the F2L- which was making hte biggest difference. When I was racing Lars
        V, too, I was experiencing this- I was surprised by how fast my hands
        were moving! They > were just &quot;in the mood&quot; and warm, I guess.
        I dunno, just something to ponder or observe- the mood of your body and
        mind when you make an average may make the difference. > Anyway, I see
        the possible doubts for ZB in full. zbF2l is the biggest nightmare, I
        agree- I&#x27;m making like 16+ zb f2l times, which is crazy. But

        ~ Bob > Team [zb] I think I&#x27;ve just found my new favorite place to
        learn ZB algs. I like the fact that you show mirrors. I&#x27;m also not
        a big fan of B turns. I think I may try learning more ZBF2L cases now
        before I move onto more ZBLL algs. I&#x27;ve still got a few COLL&#x27;s
        I&#x27;m getting used to, and I&#x27;ve realized my normal PLL&#x27;s
        really aren&#x27;t very fast when I get OLL skips. So, for the added
        benefit of OLL skips, the corner control seems not to be worth it yet.
        It may be something to play around with more once I do, but for now, I
        think it actually hurts my chances for a good LL step skip, and hurts my
        chances for a good time even so. That said, I think I&#x27;ve got a plan
        worked out for the order I&#x27;d like to learn the ZBLL cases. First,
        the no corner permutation cases. These are often very nice combinations
        of Sune type moves, and can be both fast to recognize and execute. After
        these alone, your chances of a 1 look LL are around 26.44%. Next, all of
        the algs for the opposite corners switched. The recognition on these
        should be slightly less complicated than the other cases, and these
        bring your chance for a 1 look LL up to almost 41.15%. After that, I
        suppose the U perm would be first for me, because most of the
        COLL&#x27;s I have for that are somewhat slow. Then the T and L cases.
        I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d learn anything after that, because
        that&#x27;s already a ton to learn, and because the chance for a 1 look
        is something like 71% or more. That ought to keep me busy for an awful
        long time, especially considering I&#x27;m still working on solidifying
        those last 4 PLL&#x27;s... -Mike team [zb] P.S. Terrible Sunday Contest

        Hey all, This is for anybody who can recognize using the
        &quot;sticker&quot; method for COLL. I have been considering switching
        the way I recognize COLL for the Sune/AntiSune cases. Currently, I put
        the oriented sticker at the back such that the LL color on the front
        face is on the opposite side of the oriented corner. I determine the
        case by looking at the other front sticker, the top sticker of the other
        front corner, and the top sticker of the third non-oriented corner. It
        is, however, possible to recognize using only the top face (as long as
        you know which orientation case you have) how the corners are oriented.
        However, this requires a bit more advanced thinking. Currently, I just
        think in terms of whether colors are opposite of each other, the same as
        each other, or neither. Using the new system of recognition, I would
        have to determine whether a sticker is opposite another color, left of
        another color, or right of another color. I suppose it is not all too
        difficult to decide this and it would help me learn my color scheme a
        little better, so I am quite inclined to try this new recognition
        system. This means, though, that I have to relearn all of my
        Sune/AntiSune recognition. Does anybody else recognize Sune cases by
        only looking at the top face? Any thoughts about this system? And
        please, if you recognize only by seeing which corners need to swap, then
        I tell you in advance that I have tried that system and used it for 3
        years didn&#x27;t like it. :P ~ Bob

        Bob I did it :P I just can&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s possible to
        solve ZBLL fast enough. Because OLL+PLL can be done in 5-6 seconds, and
        ZBF2L is approximately 1 second slower than F2L, ZBLL has to be done
        faster than 4-5 seconds. And even if you average 3-4 seconds for ZBLL,
        it&#x27;s only a second faster than Fridrich, and you have spent many
        years just to achieve that one second. I think it would be better to
        just practice Fridrich or other &quot;normal&quot; methods and I&#x27;m
        sure that your average times will drop more than one second in 2-3 years

        Ok. So a post on the other group got me thinking. If, after ZBF2L, you
        are left with three steps, what ways can you divide them? Not dividing
        at all gives you full ZB. Dividing between corner
        orientation/permutation and edge permutation leaves us with COLL. What
        if we divided between corner permutation and corner orientation? We
        would have a two step LL: Corner permutation, and then no corner perm ZB
        cases. The corner permutation can be fixed in an average of 7 moves, and
        I believe the final step can be performed in 16 or fewer, and generally
        requires only Sune type moves. This gives us a 23 move LL, but you
        retain the benefits of the 1/6 chance to skip corner perm. That&#x27;s
        an almost 18% chance for a 1 look LL. The other way to go with this
        would be to learn how to orient edges and permute corners
        simultaneously. I know it can be done, but I&#x27;m having trouble
        coming up with algs for a few of the cases. If it can be done in 10 or
        fewer moves per case, that system ought to be at least comparable to
        standard CFOP in terms of number of moves and potential speed.
        Especially if you can avoid most of the 4 incorrect edges cases using
        simple ZBF2L tricks. Any thoughts? -Mike

        Also, I was looking around Lars Petrus&#x27; site the other day and
        realized something. Using the VH method for edge flipping, you can
        usually influence the corner orientation in your favor with the last
        pair, simply by using U turns to adjust when you insert the pair. Doing
        this, you can pretty much end up with a Sune or AntiSune case every
        time. If one were to learn the complete Sune and AntiSune cases of ZBLL
        algs, at a total of about 144, you could always have a 1 look LL. As
        much as I like the no corner perm ones, and am terrified of the Sune
        case recognition, this seems like the best possible bang for the buck,
        hands down. Thoughts? -Mike

        Hey Mike, I&#x27;ve also been thinking about ways to modify ZB somehow.
        I guess lately, I have had some doubts about full ZB but I&#x27;ve had
        some encouragement as well. The all edges correct ZBLL cases are useful
        for a new BLD system I want to implement. Basically it is like the best
        of Stefan Pochman&#x27;s solve orientation and permutation startegy,
        combined with the quickness of cycle solving. Basically you use algs to
        both permute and orient 2 corners at a time, like in cycles solving.
        Also you can use ELL to do the same for the edges. Also, I&#x27;ve
        noticed that sometimes in my Fridrich solving I use ZB stuff even when I
        tell myself &quot;Fridrich only this average.&quot; I had one particular
        solve lately where I had a case 4 ZBF2L (the corner is flipped,
        otherwise the pair is already solved) and all LL edges flipped. Normally
        I use the all edges correct alg for my standard Fridrich alg, but during
        this solve without even thinking I did the ZBF2L, the COLL and PLL
        finsih and got a 16.xx solve. Also, for me at least ZB helps
        tremendously for making Fridrich seem like an &quot;easier&quot; method.
        The weighted bat effect I call it. So here is what I am thinking, I
        still want to learn full ZB since there are so many subsets of ZBLL that
        are so incredibly useful. Also, though I am doubting the speed of ZB
        (how do we overcome the time lost in ZBF2L and also ZBLL recognition and
        also in some cases the slow execution of the ZBLL alg?) I can only think
        of good effects from learning it. It&#x27;s a weird thought, and I
        wonder if I am the only one who thinks this way. The more I learn for
        ZBLL the more I find that there are in fact really, incredibly crappy
        cases that are very slow to solve. However, with enough practice I can
        still make my ZBLL alg faster than OLL/PLL or COLL/PLL finish on average
        (not every execution). So anyway, I am still very dedicated to learning
        all of ZB, since it does so many good things for cubing in general, but
        I seriously doubt I will use ZB in a future competition other than as a
        &quot;first round method&quot; Sort of as saying I know I can use ZB
        fast enough to make the first cut, so I might as well go for a lucky LL
        case and hopefully some sort of single solve record, and for the other
        rounds use Fridrich. I wonder also if maybe learning all of ZB, then
        using it for 5 years will make the delay problems just go away. Maybe
        learning ZB and using it in practice until the day comes when you can
        recognize very quickly will be a good strategy for how to learn it, yet
        maintain the ability to do well in competitions also. Anyway this e-mail
        is getting long, but I just wanted to post about how I was thinking
        lately. Chris P.S. Also in case anyone is interested, in the last week I
        have averaged sub-16 three times, and have been getting solves 20 and
        over only about 5% of the time or even less. This is a _huge_
        improvement for me, and the reason is that I now use opposite colors
        solving religiously. I seriously see the difference with my new roughly
        50% chance for getting a good Xcross solve on either face. Let&#x27;s
        get rid of this &quot;always solve the same color&quot; dogma. It&#x27;s
        outdated, and not as fast as opposite color, and opposite color is by
        far a better method (just look at the math behind it for proof). It has
        already drastically improved my times from what they used to be. Just
        food for thought. --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Mike

        The first idea, I already do this in accordance with Chris&#x27;s use of
        transformations to practice ZBLL algs. I am almost done with learning
        all the no CP ZBLL algs, just 4 more left (though this has been the case
        for a few weeks). I think it&#x27;s a good short-term thing to do, but
        for the long run, I definately want to finish learning the rest of ZBLL.
        In regards of the second idea, a few of us in the community already do
        this... CP and EO together. Most notably, Masayuki and I. A few years
        ago we where working on completing the list where you do CP+EO+CO. There
        are a lot of algs here, but I still use many of the algs in this set. I
        know that a CP+EO set can&#x27;t be found anywhere on the net, that
        kinda sucks. I just happen to know all of them as subsets of other sets
        I know. Which ones are you having trouble with? Hem there are so few of
        these, i should just list them out somewhere for you guys. Though the
        ugly part is that I still do about half of those algs with LL on D.
        Also, which alg do you use for Diagonal Corner Swap while preserving
        edge flip? I don&#x27;t think the one I have been using is very fast.

        I&#x27;m terrified with that recognization as well. And this is after
        actively using the S-Orientation no CP set for a few weeks. I think that
        144 algs is way to many here, and having to do CO manipulation would
        slow me down a lot. Besides a lot of the shortest ZBF2L algs don&#x27;t
        end with an oportunity where you can &quot;embed a SUne&quot;. Really
        what you are doing is &quot;embedding a sune&quot; early on. (Hope to

        are all easy to recognize. I think, though, the recognition for this
        step would be pretty easy in comparison to ZBLL, right? Recognizing only
        OLL should not be TOO difficult. You should still even be able to
        determine OLL case by looking only at the LL because the twist on the
        corners is fixed and you can&#x27;t have an odd number of flipped edges.
        Let&#x27;s ignore reflections because they&#x27;re trivial. ;) So that
        is only 216 (assuming your math is right, I didn&#x27;t double check it)
        in order to have a 2-look LL. Of course, there is still the 3 or so
        moves to consider to get into the Case1 situation, but it is *almost*
        always trivial. Has anybody considered what the recognition would be
        like for this case? ~ Bob

        Hey everyone, I feel like I&#x27;ve been pretty hard on the ZB method
        lately, and I&#x27;ve also hardly been practicing it in exchange for
        Fridrich, except on weekends so I can do the sunday contest. Well
        I&#x27;ve come to a conclusion. Just practicing with Fridrich, and doing
        solves all the time, is really boring for me. I really miss spending the
        time learning a new method every day. My exams are over on the 17th
        (thank God!) and I&#x27;ll be able to jump back in and finish the U ZBLL
        algs. I don&#x27;t know if ZB will pass Fridrich still, but to be honest
        I don&#x27;t really care. ZB is a very, very awesome method and whether
        or not it is faster I still want to know the whole thing. Just
        practicing the same method over and over is too boring for me. I like
        the rush of getting a good ZBLL solve and looking up to see a fast time,
        knowing I did it a very different way from the usual methods ;-) Chris

        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been talking to Richard a lot lately, and he
        really inspired me about one thing. I think ZBLL can be extremely fast,
        but we have to set a higher standard for it. We have to set the standard
        of sub-3 average for every alg (just straight execution) and that would
        make the LL have a sub-4 solve time with recognition also (in theory).
        Well I don&#x27;t think even a few people could do this in a short
        amount of time, so here is the suggestion. ZB doesn&#x27;t have much
        popularity yet, since it isn&#x27;t fast. Sadly it will take that to get
        many to notice. Also, why learn ZBLL quickly now and redo 300 algs later
        when it does gain some popularity after people have learned it, when we
        can all work on generating algs (with the sub-3 requirement) and make it
        fast now? It would work like this, learn ZBLL in any way you want, and
        generate and save all algs for that path. If you are learning algs that
        have already been generated, then learn the algs you want from a webpage
        or from someone, but generate other cases only to make them fast, learn
        them later. We could each take a COLL case and generate algs and spend a
        few weeks or maybe a month on optimizing each case to sub-3. After that
        we can meet here and post the best ones on a central website (perhaps
        Ron will lend us a space in the Algs section). I think if we make ZBLL
        fast right from the start, then we can learn the fastest ZBLL right from
        the start and have a chance for the method to be fast. I know a lot of
        you guys are very serious about the method, so I ask: who is willing to
        help me make a sub-3 requirement for ZBLL a reality? I can start with my
        slowest T algs (some are already easily sub-3) and work from there.
        Again you don&#x27;t have to learn the algs you generate, learn however
        you want, but spend time each day helping optimize the ZBLL. I think
        with all of us it will still not be much man power, but it will be
        enough to make a start. I will now require sub-3 for all algs, and try
        to spend a few weeks to 1 month on each COLL case to really get this
        right. I will stop learning until my T and U algs are fully sub-3
        optimized. Also if sub-3 is just not possible, let&#x27;s find the true
        limit, and get under that. ZB can still have a change, but we have to
        have a higher standard than sub-4. I&#x27;m already convinced that a
        sub-4 ZBLL stands no change whatsoever against Fridrich. I&#x27;m going
        to start on my worst T cases and go from there. Is anyone else
        interested? Let me know, I would really love for all of us to really
        take this method seriously (we already do, but I think a new level of
        dedication will be required for ZB to be fast) and move this method into
        being a top level method? Chris

        I&#x27;ve been taking a lot of time off lately from ZB to work on the
        Roux method and various improvements I have ideas for. This is helping
        my ZB in three ways: First, when I solve for extended periods of time
        and then switch to COLL/ZB, it forces me to go slower on my F2L, because
        I&#x27;m not as used to it. I&#x27;m more fluid, and I always get nice
        times, often sub-17. Usually I have to do at least 10 or more Roux
        solves before I can guarantee times like that, though. I can even do
        great times with terrible crosses much more frequently this way. Roux
        solving uses a lot of flexible ways to start the 1x2x3 blocks, and is
        aiding in my practice for x-cross. I&#x27;m not very good at it yet, but
        I&#x27;m getting much better with all of this block practice. Last,
        I&#x27;m starting to learn Doug&#x27;s algs for orienting edges while
        inserting the last cross piece. It&#x27;s really only 22 distinct cases
        (3 of those being ones where the piece is already inserted and you must
        flip edges manually. These shouldn&#x27;t come up except in unusual
        circumstances.) Because starting with only 3 cross pieces makes x-cross
        far, far easier, and gives you only 19 real cases for flipping edges,
        this may be something for ZB beginners to look into as an entry point,
        or even a semi-permanent stepping stone to full ZBF2L. It could be an
        alternative to VHF2L, really. The downside to always starting with this
        is that it averages about 6.5 moves per alg, so it&#x27;s a few extra
        moves, but this is balanced by the fact that they&#x27;re almost all
        completable using only M and U turns. I think I&#x27;m going to keep
        working on improvements for the Roux method for a bit, though, because
        it&#x27;s a great method that deserves as much attention and effort as
        ZB is getting (and Fridrich has gotten). If I can average about 50 moves
        with it (STM), without learning any real special cases, still using COLL
        instead of CLL, and using the slower and more moves edge orienting step,
        I think the potential here is very great. Add in the improvements I
        mentioned in a post on the big group, and I think this method could
        rival ZB for speed, at least in single solves. Especially at a small
        fraction of the number of algs, the flexibility of the beginning of the
        solves, much easier recognition, and the very quick M and U turn finish.
        Still, I like to think of any sort of improvement to an existing system
        along these lines as an extension of ZB. At least until I come up with a
        snappy name. ;) -Mike

        It&#x27;s very similar to using opposite color solving. There are some

        quickly enough, I&#x27;m basically giving myself much better odds to get
        a good start by having two completely different methods to use. Besides,
        there&#x27;s still a 1/120 chance that I&#x27;ll end up with a full F2L

        Hello, Even though I stopped learning ZB a few weeks ago, I&#x27;m still
        interested in that extension. I&#x27;m kind of fed up with learning an
        huge amount of algorithms without always understanding what I do. But
        I&#x27;m really interested in finding new ones either by myself or with
        the help of a computer. If you want some help, I could help for exemple
        on one of the orientation case (maybe split it with someone if anybody
        is interested). I&#x27;m rather fond of the Double-Sune orientation so
        if there is any case you prefer to have first (since I&#x27;m probably
        not gonna use this in competition), just tell me which one :-) Gilles.

        Hey Gilles, That would be awesome thank you! I&#x27;m also going to
        start searching and including all the search lists for the algs for
        others to search for ones they like too. Here is the biggest problem. We
        all have different styles. I vastly prefer RULM to anything else, and
        will often choose a sub-optimal RULM alg over an optimal length one.
        Also, some people are better at using the optimal algs and getting them
        to full speed. So here is the idea. I am a self proclaimed RULM user. I
        prefer RULM to anything else, although I do have lots of RUF and RULFD
        types algs that I like a lot. So once someone finds a list of potential
        algs for a case I could search for the RULM alg, and someone who is
        better at making the optimal alg fast could search for that. We can
        group ourselves accorind go out styles. That way, on the central site
        where we post these algs, each case will have upwards of hopefully 10
        different algs that are optimized for different styles. If 10 isn&#x27;t
        possible, at least a few to choose from. I don&#x27;t know the best way
        to set up this group interaction, perhaps we can all vote for our
        favorite and vastly preferred styles to start with. I am very much a
        RULM solver though, and prefer it to all other types by far. If too many
        of us are the same style then we can branch out. I also like RUF a lot
        and could search for those. Basically we need people to just search for
        algs in all types of metrics, and people to sift through algs once they
        are found. Imay even be able to get Richard Patterson to help us for the
        sifting part. I am willing to run my processor 24-7 to search for algs,
        as well as look for good ones among those found. We should coordinate as
        a team and work on these together. Let&#x27;s serioulsly turn team [zb]
        into a group effort to improve the ZB method. I do think with a truly
        optimized ZBLL, that this method can be one of the best, if not the
        best. But it will take a flawless ZBLL. Let me know what you guys think.
        I want to start with my T-orientations case 1 algs first. Most are sub-3
        already, but I want to optimize those that aren&#x27;t and also research
        and provide algs for different styles as well. What do you guys think?
        Should we make a database and divy up all the COLL cases? What would
        work best, I want as much input from everyone as we can get so that
        everyone can enjoy what they are working on, and do what they want to
        work on. Chris definitely still team [zb] as well --- In

        Well we need to make the T-Orientation ones that need to be worked on,
        in fact it would be great if either we each posted our alg times on our
        sites, or we have this stuff recorded on a central site. After finals,
        I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have a lot of time to devote to all this. Chris,
        you could go through all of your T-Orintation algs and list a time for
        them. I know that I use a slightly different set of algs than you,
        perhaps some of mine are faster. I have all of the no CP cases down. A
        few of my Pi1&#x27;s need to be optimizd though. I have two fast
        computers sitting around, If you ever need me to run say... a couple
        hundred ACubes... I can do that. I also have access to computer labs. My
        only problem with &lt;R,U,L,M> algs is that my left hand isn&#x27;t as
        dexterous as most of you. I couldn&#x27;t trigger L&#x27;U2 for
        instance. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe my style, but one thing is
        clear: I use my right thumb more than anybody other cubers I&#x27;ve
        watched. I&#x27;m going to post my algs up sometime over break, if you
        don&#x27;t mind Chris, I&#x27;m going to use your pages as a template to
        get these up quicker (and I love the php cube image thing). I recommend
        working on the U3 and U4 cases since they are next on the list, so to
        speak. Or for some of you that don&#x27;t follow that order of learning,
        try to work on the COLL cases with no EP (plus those with edges-H). I
        like the idea of leraning 2 algs for each COLL case so that you never
        end up with an H-Perm finish. (H-Perm is my slowest) Also these tend to
        be the shortest/fastest within their COLL category.

        What do you mean by double-Sune? Are you refering to the H1 cases? I
        already have those. The one where there is no EP is my slowest, feel
        free to work on that one, it&#x27;s the only non-trivial one there I
        think, the ohter&#x27;s are easy/fast. Work on the other H-Orientation
        cases, I don&#x27;t think many people have looked at those yet. If you
        are talking about general double-sune cases outside of H1, then I have
        many of those covered too. Me and DanH have good L1 sets completed. I
        don&#x27;t know if Pi1 needs work, I have a set, but it&#x27;s kinda
        slow I think. -Doug --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, Gilles van den

        believe the 1.97 for T1-11 that was so amazing! I had no idea that alg
        was that fast! No wonder I always get my best times with that one! My
        record with it was 1.78 when timing. Alright, well I feel ok with the T
        Case 1 algs. Some of them could be better practiced for me (the
        2.9&#x27;s can be faster in my opinion). How much work shoudl we spend
        on T1? I will time the others tomorrow, my wrists really hurt after this
        session. Chris --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cmhardw&quot;

        And the ones Doug was referring to were labeled similarly to Dan
        Harris&#x27; site. H is Double Sune, Pi is Bruno, etc. If you want to
        look up useful algs, because others have gotten a decent start on
        finding the T, U and no corner perm algs, I suggest starting with the
        diagonal corner perm ones. For the Double Sune case, there will only be

        Thanks Mike (Chris you were very clear, it&#x27;s just that I
        didn&#x27;t know the notation further than U and T :p) So yes :

        Hi Chris, Nice stuff there. If you think it would be beneficial to the
        group, I can also take averages of my T1 algs and post the results/algs
        here. I know there are a few that I&#x27;ve gotten sub 2 before. I can
        also help out with alg optimization, but I don&#x27;t want to do any
        sets of algs that I&#x27;m not already working on learning. Since
        I&#x27;m working on learning the T5&#x27;s now and only have 5 more to
        go, I can help with getting fast algs for that case. I tend to like algs
        that are RUD or RUF. -Jason --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com,

        There are plenty of people working on T and even U algs, Doug and others
        have the no corner perm algs covered pretty well, and I know at least
        Dan Harris has a start on the L algs. After that, no one seems to have a
        distinct order in mind. I think the smartest way to learn the algs would
        be to learn the diagonal perm algs, because the recognization is
        slightly easier than adjacent corner perms, and because that gives you a
        37% chance for a 1 look. The H orientation only comes up 2/3 as often as
        the others, but it would be a good starting point because it only has
        2/3 as many cases. -Mike P.S. If someone really wants to be helpful,
        they could use ACube for me for a day, first. ;)

        everyone, I&#x27;ve been talking to Richard a lot lately, and he really
        inspired me about one thing. I think ZBLL can be extremely fast, but we
        have to set a higher standard for it. We have to set the standard of
        sub-3 average for every alg (just straight execution) and that would
        make the LL have a sub-4 solve time with recognition also (in theory).
        Well I don&#x27;t think even a few people could do this in a short
        amount of time, so here is the suggestion. ZB doesn&#x27;t have much
        popularity yet, since it isn&#x27;t fast. Sadly it will take that to get
        many to notice. Also, why learn ZBLL quickly now and redo 300 algs later
        when it does gain some popularity after people have learned it, when we
        can all work on generating algs (with the sub-3 requirement) and make it
        fast now? It would work like this, learn ZBLL in any way you want, and
        generate and save all algs for that path. If you are learning algs that
        have already been generated, then learn the algs you want from a webpage
        or from someone, but generate other cases only to make them fast, learn
        them later. We could each take a COLL case and generate algs and spend a
        few weeks or maybe a month on optimizing each case to sub-3. After that
        we can meet here and post the best ones on a central website (perhaps
        Ron will lend us a space in the Algs section). I think if we make ZBLL
        fast right from the start, then we can learn the fastest ZBLL right from
        the start and have a chance for the method to be fast. I know a lot of
        you guys are very serious about the method, so I ask: who is willing to
        help me make a sub-3 requirement for ZBLL a reality? I can start with my
        slowest T algs (some are already easily sub-3) and work from there.
        Again you don&#x27;t have to learn the algs you generate, learn however
        you want, but spend time each day helping optimize the ZBLL. I think
        with all of us it will still not be much man power, but it will be
        enough to make a start. I will now require sub-3 for all algs, and try
        to spend a few weeks to 1 month on each COLL case to really get this
        right. I will stop learning until my T and U algs are fully sub-3
        optimized. Also if sub-3 is just not possible, let&#x27;s find the true
        limit, and get under that. ZB can still have a change, but we have to
        have a higher standard than sub-4. I&#x27;m already convinced that a
        sub-4 ZBLL stands no change whatsoever against Fridrich. I&#x27;m going
        to start on my worst T cases and go from there. Is anyone else
        interested? Let me know, I would really love for all of us to really
        take this method seriously (we already do, but I think a new level of
        dedication will be required for ZB to be fast) and move this method into
        being a top level method? Chris --------------------------------- YAHOO!

        Hey everyone, Richard Patterson and I have been talking, and here is a
        proposed delgation of responsibility. We&#x27;re really turning into a
        research team like Gilles said, so I think it would be best if we
        delegated the responsibility. Here is the proposed delegation.
        Let&#x27;s see how this would work based on our resources, and also with
        what each person wants to do.
        ----------------------------------------------------------------- A->
        The lead will be in charge of delegating groups B, C, &amp; D. B-> Those
        in charge of Web Space Management have two main responsibilities. First,
        to receive raw sequences from group C, and to post them online in a way
        that it is readily available for group D. Second, to post optimized
        sequences received from group D. C-> This group&#x27;s main
        responsibility is to generate raw sequences for target cases, as
        delegated by the lead. Upon generating those raw cases, this group will
        be responsible for sending their output to group B. D-> This group is
        responsible for optimizing raw sequences posted online by group B. Upon
        optimizing, this group will send their results to group B to be posted.
        ** To insure focus and synergy among the groups, the lead must
        collaborate with all the groups. The target cases should be known and
        sought by each group. This will help for organizational purposes.
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Also since we are a small group, we may need to overlap a little bit as
        well. I am willing to do any of the above responsibilities. My computer
        processor is open for searching, and I also really enjoy optimizing
        sequences. Also we can use my space on speedcubing.com to post sequences
        that are both raw sequences and optimized. I will e-mail Ron as well and
        see if we can use the space on the algorithms page for our final
        sequences. This is really exciting! I think with this group effort to
        optimize ZBLL that we will be able to bring it into prominence as a
        method and get others interested. Also, I belive that a group effort
        could make ZB a very efficient method, possibly even more efficient that
        Fridrich. It sounds like we are all dedicated and ready to start working
        on the method. All we need now is to organize ourselves and we can
        really efficiently start optimizing algs. Let me know what you think. It
        already sounds like we have people wanting to do certain things, so
        let&#x27;s try to organize. First thing, everyone say what you think of
        the proposed delegation. First off, does it fit our resources? Also, do
        we have enough people to make this work? I&#x27;ve made a database,
        basically just a roll call, of who is interested in working in taking
        part of the optimization. Well, we won&#x27;t be the inventors of ZB,
        but we&#x27;ll sure be remembered as the ones who really turned it into
        a nice speedcubing method :-) Let&#x27;s really turn this team [zb] idea
        into a serious team that&#x27;s well known in the speedcubing community.
        Also, with the new variations that are coming up, I think we should
        handle those accordingly on the central website. Any alternative to ZBLL
        that includes ZBLL will need optimized algs, so perhaps we should start
        with those cases first in our optimization. If we can fill all the algs
        necessary for a variation of ZB with super nice algs, maybe we can bring
        the skeptics into the method by allowing them to try a superfast
        variation of ZB before committing to the whole method. This is all very
        exciting for me! I&#x27;m glad that we all have the interest in this
        method! Ok, everyone post in the database if you are interested in being
        on the research team, and also what resources are available to you.
        Thanks everyone, and I think we&#x27;ve definitely become a full
        strength team. Now we just have to show the speedcubing community that
        we&#x27;re serious, and that we mean business. Chris Team [ZB]

        I totally agree with that organisation :-) We should just wait a few
        days to have all the volunteers and start to organize it completely. I

        Hey Chris, I have used ZBLL only very seldom after I stopped learning

        Hey Doug, Wow that would be awesome! I can start coming up with some
        search strings that I always use. Also, I think we should come up with a
        set procedure for the searching so that every case gets the same amount
        of search time. Here is what I think should be done based on my
        experience with the T and U cases, but I&#x27;m of course open to
        suggestions. First search for quartern turn optimized algs and print out
        all of them. The startup string for ACube is then java -cp ACube3.jar
        ACube qa Then search for all algs (this includes ones in RULM, RUF,
        etc.. since it prints every alg, or at least most of them, more on that
        later). Then since we have to accomodate all styles we should do the
        same thing in also HTM and STM. So the other two search strings would be
        java -cp ACube3.jar ACube a (for HTM, since ACube defaults to HTM) and
        java -cp ACube3.jar ACube sa Now, everyone gets a copy of the QTM
        optimized list, and then the STM users also take the STM list and the
        HTM users take the HTM list too. When searching for an alg try to find
        the best ones on the QTM list that are also on either the HTM or STM
        list. This gives you an idea of what a fast alg in either HTM or STM is
        like. Then compare you QTM and HTM dual optimized alg to other algs on
        the HTM list and see if one is better. That is how I found all my ZBLL
        algs. The QTM list is an amazingly powerful filter for algs, and I
        always use it in conjunction with the HTM list (STM users would do well
        to also use it for their STM algs I believe). So the most important is
        that we have a search string with each of these java -cp ACube3.jar
        ACube a java -cp ACube3.jar ACube qa java -cp ACube3.jar ACube sa Also,
        the program is more likely to find suboptimal length cases if you search
        within your preferred faces. Suboptimal length algs tend to be the
        faster ones for me (not always of course). So you would again search in
        QTM for algs in the RULM group say, and also in the HTM group. It is a
        tedious process, but the algs you get out of it the best quality
        I&#x27;ve been able to find. So this would mean that we may need to do a
        lot of searches on each case. For example take a new H case. Now search
        that case in QTM with java -cp ACube3.jar ACube qa after that search is
        over, run another one still within QTM for every preferred move group.
        RUF, RULM, etc.. Now restart ACube in HTM and STM and do the same, do an
        all search, and also search for our preferred face groups. This may be
        very repetitive, and not the most efficient way. I am not a computer
        programmer, so those with computer experience please help to optimize
        this process! Basically, this is the procedure I used to find my best
        algs for ZBLL. I think the most important is that any search must have a
        QTM counterpart to compare to the HTM and STM search to dual optimize
        each alg for HTM and QTM or also STM and QTM. Also, it is very important
        that we also search specifically for moves in our preferred move groups,
        since Acube doesn&#x27;t print out every single alg it finds, but only
        95-99% of them. Also this maximizes your chances of finding the
        suboptimal length algs that are super fast (suney type algs are a good
        example, ACube optimal searches weed them out almost 100% of the time,
        since they are almost never optimal length) I could only ever find suney
        type algs with searches in RUL moves specifically. Again these are just
        my thoughts, you guys have more computer experience than me by far!
        Let&#x27;s come up with a rigid procedure for generation raw algs! This
        will be a very important substep to moving on. Chris --- In

        Sounds very good. I know that I use the &quot;~U&quot; command too so
        that it doens&#x27;t count the U turn as part of the length when
        searching. I am very strong when it comes to parsing data, writting
        parsers, writting scripts that will turn the ACube output directly into
        a webpage layout, stuff like that. So you guys don&#x27;t have to worry
        about filtering through data besides making them all triggerific! We
        need someone to write up a bunch of txt files with all the input
        strings. Perhaps even separated into q,h,s metrics. But organized in a
        really nice way. It looks like it&#x27;s something that I could run next
        weekend. Just a lucky coincidence I&#x27;m doing a bit of computer lab
        admin this weeka and setting up 20 brand new workstations
        (multi-processor) that should help out big time. I&#x27;ve been running
        ACube for over 6 years now, so I know how it&#x27;s done. -Doug Li ---

        Hey Doug and all searchers, Start ACube with these java -cp ACube3.jar
        ACube a java -cp ACube3.jar ACube qa java -cp ACube3.jar ACube sa And
        preface the positions with whichever of these you like. These are all
        the search faces I&#x27;ve ever used. RUL = 430 RULM = 431 RU = 410 LU =
        420 RUF = 510 LUF = 520 RUFM = 511 LUFM = 521 RULD = 630 RUFD = 710 LUFD
        = 720 URD = 610 ULD = 620 MU = 401 (only for EPLL only) MUD = 601 MUR =
        411 MUL = 421 My style is heavily RULM influenced, so will be these face
        groupings. Please add any that I have left out that you all use.
        Everyone searching a case please put in the ACube codes for the position
        and preface it with the face groupings you like most. Now we need to
        know exactly who is searching which cases? I can do the T cases, since I
        already have a lot of my output files still from those. For some reason
        my command window (where I run ACube) won&#x27;t let me copy text, so
        I&#x27;ll make .jpgs of my screen captures for the search data I still
        have. Nobody go too crazy on T cases until I can put up my T searches
        that are already completed (that will save of search time that I&#x27;ve
        already done). Also every who is familiar with ACube put up the codes
        for your favorite face groupings. If you are not familiar with ACube,
        simply request some face groupings here and one of us will convert it.

        That is way too many turnface mask codes. We need just 2 or 3.
        Especially if we are searious about searching all 3 metrics (although I
        sugguest not doing slice metric). What I tend to do myself is search inf
        FTM/HTM all the time, and then look at the subset of solutions that are
        lowest in QTM within those results. RUL = 430 RULM = 431 RUF = 510 URD =
        610 Are ones I like, in fact I think RUL is enough, so take out the
        RULM. Actually how about just RUL and a general search? Both only in
        HTM. And then we go back thorugh the especially slow cases. Cuz right
        now, it looks to me like every little thing you add adds a factor into
        the equation. And this really adds up.... -Doug --- In

        Hi all, I really have no intentions to learn ZBLL, but I do believe in
        the method. I&#x27;ll do everything I can to assist in the effort. I
        have to disagree with you though Doug, in regards to eliminating group
        C. While you could be the main core of the group with your army of
        computers, I think it would be a bad idea to rely entirely on one person
        for this aspect of the effort. As a side note, I know acube has the
        highest potential in finding sequences, but cube explorer and even
        Ron&#x27;s block solver can be used. I&#x27;ve found a few gems using
        both tools, even though one is fast and usually gives you nothing, and
        the other is painfully slow. As far as the individual groups go,
        they&#x27;re not intended to be restrictive in any way. I&#x27;m sure
        many people will be involved in all aspects of the process anyway.
        Organizing it this way will just help people prioritize their work time
        (I think). I was talking with Chris about the team and I really feel
        that if we divide up the tasks, and work together, we&#x27;ll all be
        amazed by the result (gotta love synergy) --- In

        Yeah I agree, using each turn mask all the time would make this take
        forever. For cases that are really bad I try a lot of those different
        turn masks though too to try to find something. I wouldn&#x27;t throw
        out RULM, or maybe I can do all the RULM searches, since some of my best
        ZBLL algs use M turns in an otherwise RUL type alg too. This is where we
        need to find out what type of turns we all like the most, and try to
        accomodate everyone. Actualyl it will take longer for just RUL searches,
        but will include RULM moves too, maybe Doug we could condense the RUL
        into RULM and be left with RULM = 431 RUF = 510 URD = 610 The problem is
        I also like RULD = 630 moves and already 4 is getting to be too much to
        do for every case. Perhaps we can restrict to the &quot;all&quot;
        general searches, and only do the other side searches in case one of the
        cases we try just does not have anything good at all. The problem is
        that if we do these side searches for everything, Doug you may run too
        many searches. Say the RUL algs for one case stink, but the general
        includes an optimal alg that is awesome? We have then wasted that search
        time. I think getting just the QTM/HTM/STM searches for each case would
        be an ok starting point. From there STM solvers, HTM solvers, etc. can
        search for the ones they like and if the algs stink, then individualyl
        we can go through and search for lots of different metrics to find a
        good alg. Chris Chris --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Doug

        Who here wants STM optimized algs? We aren&#x27;t Corners First people
        here, I used to search only in STM on principle, but I no longer feel it
        holds much potential. I use it a lot for my ELL though, but that&#x27;s
        totally different. I think it&#x27;s better to look at the output of a
        QTM or HTM set, and look for those that then lowest in STM. This times 3
        factor is a bit daunting for the timespan I imagine. It would be great
        if we could get all the Acube outputs generated very early on and then
        have everybody filter through it. I think RULM = 431, RUF = 510, URD =
        610, and general search would be enough. I have a thing for URD type
        ones. -Doug --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, &quot;cmhardw&quot;

        Hey Jason, Yes I think it would definitely be beneficial to have another
        sample of T1 alg averages. Also, go ahead and average all your other
        cases. I would be working on my T2 and further cases today, but these
        darn final exams are getting in my way ;-) Particularly if you have a
        sub-3 alg that is different from one of mine or Dan&#x27;s or
        Bob&#x27;s, I think it would be awesome to gather as many fast algs that
        are different for each case as we can. Chris --- In

        Alright, so I just went through my L1 notes and typed them up. I used
        Chris&#x27;s page as a template, but I changed the widths so that if you
        print it, it won&#x27;t be cut off. The last 4 algs I attribute to DanH
        and LarsP, before looking at the way they did it, I used a really nasty
        FLBRU type alg. Tell me if there are any errors or if things should be
        organized differently, I might have added confusion by giving the
        diagrams from the vantage point of how the alg should be executed. I
        should do my H1 algs next. Unless of course someone gives me some ACube
        lines to run :). I would like to get all my no CP ZB algs up (except T1
        and U1 which Chris already covered, though some one should double check
        the timings on those... looks at Jason). I will list timings for my L1
        algs once I have time, I have not yet mastered the last 4 on the bottom
        though, but Chris assures me they should be fast. Here&#x27;s the link:
        http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/zblll1.html Oh ya and since I have
        been using a different COLL set than any of you guys, I should be able
        to provide some insight for a few cases here and there outside of
        &quot;no CP territory&quot;. -Doug

        Yes I agree. Well in addition to the desired masks, it is probably best
        to also do a general (no mask) search. I can run an entire COLL category
        for you guys, just prepare the input lines, so I don&#x27;t have to
        think about it. E-mail them to me at d_funny007 [at] yahoo. 1 COLL times
        12 edge possibilites (though usually less) times 4 maskings times 3
        metrics is 144 (though typically half due to symmetries) ACube runs per
        COLL... this is rediculous (although I can do one in one night if need
        be). We need to take out STM and one of the masks, you see we don&#x27;t
        really lose much, it usualy happens that the nice RUF or URD algs come
        through in the general search. (RUL algs are genereal too far away from
        optimal to catch in the general serach) If we just do RULM and a general
        search, each in FTM only then it&#x27;s only 24 outputs to sort through
        per COLL case (and thare are not too many COLLs). Only if there is some
        serious problems with finding a good one there should we go farther. But
        this is my opinion only, and I acknowledge that being part of a group
        means that I will have to do what ever task is assigned to me. Thus I
        await school to be over so that someone from self- selected &quot;group
        A&quot; gives me concrete instructions. Until then I will continue
        posting my &quot;no CP&quot; algs, which have been in my notes and gone
        through a few years of evolution. Also, if no one wants to do this task,
        I guess I can spend time coding something that will generate a lot of
        input lines. But that will take up a lot of my time. Ok perhaps someone
        here has time, and wants to take up a chunk of the ZBLL and type out the
        input lines for them. And before you run them, e-mail them to me and if
        I&#x27;m not terribly busy I bet I will beat your computer to it.
        (don&#x27;t take my enthusiasm the wrong way) Also, just to get started
        with things (as we wait for further direction from our fearless leader),
        could some one go through T1 timings for Chris&#x27;s page, look at his
        T5 algs, and also my L1 algs that I posted earlier, as well as the ones
        someone else posted earlier at http://www.belgiancubes.be/zbll/ for
        diagonal CP H- Orientaion cases. -Doug --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com,

      <strong>270. Group A delegation</strong><br />

        Hey everyone, I wanted to ask basically what we wanted to do as a group
        about the lead position, or group A. I honestly am willing to devote the
        time to any of the activities in our delegation, but I would love to
        help direct. I will have the free time after I graduate (I really do
        cube in all of my free time, so it won&#x27;t be a big change). However,
        there is an issue. On Dec. 19 I am leaving for California to visit my
        Grandparents and won&#x27;t be back until Jan. 6. During this time I
        won&#x27;t have any access to the internet whatsoever. In this formative
        period of team [zb] I don&#x27;t think it would be good for me to
        delegate, simply since I will be absent for roughly three weeks very
        shortly. I will take my laptop with me and analyze cases and optimize
        algs while I am gone though. My question is this, what should we do
        about the lead position? I would love to really be a part of this group
        and help each of the groups and try to do all of the group activities we
        need, but the truth is that I will be absent for three weeks very soon.
        So we need a lead, or preferably more than one in case the other is
        absent. I am more than willing to dedicate my time to team [zb] and
        would love to do so, but I simply cannot do that until after Jan. 6 next
        year. Who else wants to take over in a lead position and make sure the
        group is directed in a good direction? This organization is so awesome,
        and I am so excited to see us coming together into a real research team.
        I hope everyone has a good holiday, and in my free time between finals
        up until I leave I will try to do as much as I can. I will only be able
        to analyze cases and generate raw algs while on vacation, but after I
        return I will have the free time and the ability to fully dedicate
        myself to our effort. Let me know what everyone thinks, Chris

        This site seems to be issing some cases:
        http://www.belgiancubes.be/zbll/index.html There are typically 12 edge
        cases if you count mirrors and inverses. Give timings for these, and
        write them in trigger notation. I typically avoid taking a lead role in
        things, but since it&#x27;s beeen rather quite and people are itching to
        do work I&#x27;m going to give some suggestions. Since Jason is working
        on T5, he could work on improving those algs and give us timings. Since
        Chris started work on U2, that is his territory. I have yet to get a
        reply about my L1 algs, I would especially appriciate it if DanH would
        give those a look since he asked about them a while ago. (Although
        I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s busy lately since he hasn&#x27;t even posted his
        L1 list yet, on his site.) I am going to post my H1 algs next. In
        general look though the T-Orientation cases and see if there&#x27;s a
        rather long one that can be beter executed. If anyone has other no CP
        algs (that are possiblity better than what we already have), now is a
        good time to post them. I would especially like revised T1 and U1 algs,
        since those seem to be the slowest no CP cases..., for me at least. If
        any of you want to work on unexplored territory, claim it first by
        posting here so that we don&#x27;t have people working on the identical
        thing. Collaborate, Divide and Conquer! -Doug --- In

        Also, due to their difference in symmetry with the T/U category, it is
        not yet clear what the numbering should be since, there is no analog I
        can see. There should be only 4 COLL sub-categories within the
        H-Orientation. So not the 6 we see in T and U, using the way Chris is
        counting/sorthing them. As a guess, I believe Chris would name those H4,
        but I leave it up to him. Also, Bob, what do you think of my L1 listing?

        Hello, I&#x27;m surprised that there hasn&#x27;t been any message on the
        research recently. Even though Chris went on holiday for 3 weeks, this
        doesn&#x27;t mean we have to stop everything. I&#x27;m still searching
        for these H cases with the diagonals but at the moment I&#x27;ve found
        only one that I can perform under 3 seconds. Most of them are really
        complicated and even though I simplify them, I usually stay around 5
        seconds. What are you guys working on ? Gilles.

        I&#x27;m wondering, where have you posted your raw output? Surely we
        have better chances of finding fast algs if we work together on
        optimizing! We really do need someone to host all raw sequences and
        optimized algs. This is key to being organized I think. happy cubing

        I have been learning algs, that&#x27;s also an important part of things
        albeit a bit selfish. I have been helping Mike with 5-edge alg sets...
        sort of a warm up to doing the serious work. (I&#x27;m adding 1GB of
        RAM, to get up to 2GB, and see some perfomance increase on my ACube
        runs... hehe.) We will first try to use the files section here to post
        work done, use very discriptive namings, zip related files together,
        make your own directory there under your name. If that doens&#x27;t work
        out, we will have to make a mailing list, and send stuff through as
        attachments (no comments, commments should be made here). Secondly I
        could set up a group-gmail account for us... nearly unlimited space, but
        it means we have to trust everybody with the same password. Let&#x27;s
        stick to popular ways of communicating/sharing information. (Although by
        popular, I do bias American ways.) -Doug --- In

        Agreed, but I was more talking about the intermediate data, I will make
        a gmail account and give you guys the password, it will act as a group
        file server for us (if space here runs out that is). As for final
        results, Chris has been talking to Ron abour getting a separate part of
        speedcubing.com for it all. I am going to write up a bunch of input
        lines for various cases and run them this week. I just noticed a
        shipment of 20 new computers have arrived for a lab I manage... the idea
        is to set them up this week and do a lot of runs soon. -Doug --- In

      <strong>288. Finished Generating some algs</strong><br />

        I did a full pass on the U2 cases today on my fastest computer. Could
        someone look at those and perhaps see if the ones (half) Chris posted on
        his site are among them... or perhaps better ones. This was to benchmark
        my computer setup. It took about 8 hours... I had a second computer also
        do the same run to double-check the results (sort of unnecessary). I
        posted the results in the files section of this group. I think each of
        you should create a folder with your name when you post data like this.
        I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll run out of room here.... it&#x27;s all
        text files. I also posted the 5EO/5EP algs sets... something Mike said
        he was interested in. Have a look if you&#x27;re curious. I have 3
        fairly powerful computers in my apartment (1 seems to beep a lot when
        overheated though)... I can spend about 10 hrs (so 1 day) to do 3 COLL
        cases. For the purposes of generating algs, I think inverses should be
        counted separately, mirrors together, and PLLs skipped (obviously). This
        yields 29 cases by my rough count. (5 T, 5 U, 4 L, 6 S, 5 Pi, 4 H) Chris
        has 6.5 of these done. Now that I went through U2 in it&#x27;s entirety,
        that leaves only 22 COLLs. I should be able to do this in about 11 days.
        (Keep one computer free for my gaming needs :).) This is a &quot;quick
        and dirty double pass,&quot; I run them all FTM optimized with 777 and
        431 masking. 431 is many times faster than 777 it turns out. Once I take
        the 16 brand new Dells out of their boxes, set them up and run have them
        running ACube... I&#x27;m thinking 2.5 days, or 2 days based on what
        I&#x27;ll already have completed. By getting through all this so fast, I
        can go back though at a latter time to work on specific ones, for
        FUR-type or various sub-opt finds. I&#x27;ve already started churning
        out the U3/U4 algs on my 2 fastest computers. I estimate being 25% done
        with this COLL. Someone start on the L-Orientation (minus no CP) if you
        want to join in on my effort. I hope you guys are satisfied that me and
        Chris have the U-Orientation covered. At the end of this &quot;first
        quick pass&quot;, I&#x27;ll also do on the T- Orientations and &quot;no
        CP ones&quot; just for completeness. -Doug

        Maybe I&#x27;m beating a dead dog here, but I believe starting an
        orginizational effort with scattering everyones results among multiple
        folders is a bad idea. It is key to start off on the right foot here.
        When everyone realizes this scattered approach isn&#x27;t beneficial, it
        will take even longer to correct. The importance of a central location
        for all results (raw and optimized) is vital. Instead of looking for
        algs right now we should be looking for webspace; as well as people who
        are willing to receive, sort through, and post results that are sent in.

        I agree, I proposed a possible location but it doesn&#x27;t look like
        many people like it. And we need something more designed than just txt
        documents in the file section. Webspace is not the problem, what we need
        is a powerful interface that fits our needs. Gilles. 2005/12/20, Richard

      <strong>295. U3 and U4 Cases Done</strong><br />

        I just uploaded raw algs for the U3 case. U4 is just it&#x27;s mirror so
        it shouldn&#x27;t need to be done separately. I just did all 12 edge
        cases in the COLL. I ran them in FTM optimized, one file is in 777 (for
        all turns) and another in 431 (for RULM restriction). I noticed that 777
        take about 5 times longer to search. Also there is always one or two
        777, that take forever (like 2 hrs for my computers to do). I have some
        triggered-algs for some of them already... I&#x27;ll post those
        sometime... in the same way I posted my L1 set. Also, do note that I
        posted U2 algs. I reduced it down to 7 cases, I ran them 777 and 431
        alternating for 14 runs. This is also availble. U5 is small, so
        I&#x27;ll start them now and they oughta be done in 3- 4hrs so I&#x27;ll
        post those tomorrow when i get the chance. It can be reduced to 6 cases,
        so only 12 runs... I&#x27;m taking care of all the U-Orientatations like
        Chris wanted from me... I hope he likes what I tried to do. (Side-note:
        U3_431 only took a couple hrs and was availble at 2pm...) -Doug

        So.. I would have been able to post the U5 set like 4 hrs ago, but there
        is this one rediculous case that is taking it forever to genrerate.
        U-Orientation, CP is diagonal, EP is 4E-circular, turnmask 777. Over 4.5
        hrs for just one ZBLL alg has got to be a record. I have yet to find a
        way to have multiple computers work on the same input line at the same
        time to cut the time up. I have a friend that specializes in converting
        code into something parallel-processing capable. I should see if he can
        help me. Anyways, it&#x27;s 6:30am here, I&#x27;m bored with insomnia.
        Also one of my computers is busted, not really..., but just many times
        slower than my new one, so it&#x27;s not worth using anymore. 3 COLLs in
        1.5 days isn&#x27;t too bad right? That leaves 20 categories, times 12
        hrs per category (conservatively factoring in various down-times)... so
        10 days. Still I gotta pump up the throughput at some point.
        There&#x27;s a lot of down-time, like for now, I have 2 computers not
        doing anything... should just start the U6 cases. That would require me
        to make the input file though, and I can&#x27;t be bothered with that
        right now. Just wanted to check in. I want to look at the U2 cases
        myself (Chris is working on them too, and we have been discussing
        specific U2 algs for a couple weeks). One of you can do the U3/U4 if you
        have time. I&#x27;ll post the U5 ASAP. It seems that with 12 cases in U3
        to look through we should be busy for a while anyhow. My goal is to take
        care of the distributed commputing workload. Now since that leaves room
        for a break to skip elsewhere, feel free to post input lines for regions
        of ZB your working on and I&#x27;ll get on it over the weekend. (This is
        for those of you out there with slow computers and a lot of cases to
        run.) If nobody asks me to do anything, I&#x27;m going to run the the
        Diagonal H-Orientation cases that Gilles is working on. It should give
        him more raw data to work with. -Doug

        Got up noticed that 1 computer finally finished all the U5 cases. So I
        posted them. that wasn&#x27;t the orignal idea, if it hadn&#x27;t been
        for one case taking 7 hrs to do, I would have had it out there already.
        I have two coputers going at it. One does all the 431 then 777; the
        other does all the 777 then the 431. Hopefully they meet int he middle
        somewhere and I can merge the results together and post in 2/3 the time
        (one machine is faster). But I fell asleep so one did all the work after
        I stopped the other one, since there was only one case left. I started
        running the U6 on two computers this way. 7 cases there, so 14 runs.
        They should meet in the middle in 4 hrs or so. Do note however that U6
        and T6 cases are inverse of each other... running these seems a little
        redundent, but I think Chris wants me to do them anyways. With
        U-Orientation done, I&#x27;ll go back and re-do U1 and all the T cases
        just to have them in case we need them and for completeness value. I
        have one more final exam left. Hopefully then I can start posting H1
        alg, followed by some U2, some Pi1, some S1.... in that order... -Doug

        Looks better Thom, good work! Now that we have a central location, I
        have a few questions: Have we decided on a labeling system? If not, that
        is of course important. Also, what format will we present the cases in?
        3D+2D image? Lets brainstorm here. After we&#x27;ve decide we can put
        together a cumulative schedule for researching cases. Many thanks to
        everyone who are working so hard for organizing the effort. -Richard --

        Yes, I assumed many people would be busy this time of year, it&#x27;s
        cool. So I lied, the U5 I posted where really T5. My mistake, I just
        fized it, and only a few more U5 left to process. I posted U1&#x27;s
        just incase we need to look at them again. I am doing to redo all of
        T-Orientation (except T5 since that got accidentally done). I have a few
        T1, T2, and T6 done already... They should be finished in a few hours.
        Then I&#x27;ll do the T3/T4. Instead of working on H diagonal, I&#x27;ll
        do the Pi-Orientation next since I can safely assume the
        numbering/coding that Chris uses extends there. -Doug --- In

        Each COLL category is labeled according to Chris&#x27;s numbering found
        at: www.speedcubing.com/chris/zbll.html So I extended his T number to U.
        I skipped mirrors since that would be a big waste of time to do both.
        For a U-Orientation COLL category, look at the corresponding T on his
        page. I ordered them in that order... the first column going down,
        unless there is one that is not mirror on the right then I included in
        in that slot. (i.e. they are numbered according to the way English is
        read: top to bottom, left to right, but skipping redundant ones.) One
        exception: U3 and T3 I had a program (Mathematica) populate the input
        lines for since there where all 12 EP possiblities there. They are
        ordered in alphabetical order of the input line.... so not very helpful
        but it was my quick and dirty way of cooking the input lines up. The
        first half of the file is done in no turn mask (or equiv. 777). The
        second half is done in 431. I recommend that you look at both when
        digging though a specific case. 777 is general search, 431 is RULM-type
        search. Both are FTM optimized as you can see. Help is appriciated. But
        do post on what cases you are working on so that we don&#x27;t have two
        ppl doing the same thing. Post your results oon WikiCube if possible.

        I posted the corrected U5&#x27;s. Thus U-Orientation is killed off. I
        have all of T-Orientation except for 3 more T2_777 that are all running
        on 4 different computers now. Those have been running for over an hour
        now. Once that is done T-Orientation will be killed off. T1,T3,T5,T6 are
        all posted. I know many ppl have final algs for these already, but I
        give them here for completeness and just in case we need to go back and
        re-evaluate one, as Chris mentioned (3s goal). I have Pi2_431, Pi5_431
        done but not posted. I am up to using 7 computers now. I still
        haven&#x27;t recruited the 18 new Dells I have... (I&#x27;d have to take
        them out of the box first though). Ok... so it seems T2:2, T2:6, T2:7
        are taking forever... I&#x27;m having 4 machines crunching these 3
        cases. Ah, looks like Pi6_431 is about done though :). Hem those beeping
        noises to warn of overheating can&#x27;t be good... -Doug

        For this quick double pass.... like I said, I depends on how many
        computers I have access to, I am currently using 7. I am just doing U,T,
        and Pi orientations. I don&#x27;t know the numbering for the other 3. I
        want Chris to post plank pages up for those so that I can have something
        to correspond my runs for. I justed posted all of Pi2. I also finished
        all of the RULM sets for all the Pi-Orientaitons last night. I&#x27;ll
        post those as the general (UDFBLR) searches are done. Half of Pi3_777 is
        done. (Still one T2 case remains at large... I&#x27;m thinking I run it
        on my fastest computer.) -Doug --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, Gilles

        I just finihsed cranking out all of the Pi-Orietnations. That was 78
        ACube runs. The last 3 ended up taking a few hours even though I had
        each working on different computers. So ya... that now makes
        3-Orientations: U,T,Pi all up for your viewing pleasure. (Check out the
        files section here.) Since L seems to be DanH territory, I&#x27;m going
        to work on H-Orientation next. -Doug

        Well right now we are just waiting for people to get back from
        break/vacation. I think we espeically need Chris around. I think that
        next year we&#x27;ll have a lot of material out there for people to
        learn. A lot of the T5 algs need to be looked at again I think. I need
        to continue looking at DanH&#x27;s L1, and I hope he looks at my L1.
        I&#x27;ll post my H1 soon. I have a lot to do, becuase I had been doing
        ZB stuff for so long and not collaborating. I have notes dating back to
        b4 Toronto that I need to post. I have some fast algs for the second
        half of U2 that Chris has yet to post. A lot of my COLL&#x27;s will be
        different so that should add to it. I have stopped running ACubes. Yuo
        guys can e-mail me stuff to run if you&#x27;d like. I have about 7
        computers available. Right now I&#x27;m spending Christmas at home
        though. -Doug --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, Gilles van den Peereboom
