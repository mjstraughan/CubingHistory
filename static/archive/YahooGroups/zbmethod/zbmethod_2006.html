          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
Some of you may have already been using Transformation algorithms in <br>
your ZB practice, either through inspiration from Chris or maybe you <br>
came up with the idea yourself.<br>
<br>
If you don&#x27;t know what it is, the idea is to apply a simple <br>
algorithm to the Orientation case you end up with after ZBF2L or <br>
VHF2L, to end up with a case that you know. So if you had only <br>
learned some T-Orientation ZBLL cases, and when solving you ended up <br>
with an L, you could apply an algorithm to transform it into a T-<br>
Orientation. Of course, this doesn&#x27;t advance you any further as far <br>
as the method is concerned, because it&#x27;s not useful for <br>
speedsolving, but it is a very useful practice tool because it <br>
allows you to rehearse your knowledge with every cube.<br>
<br>
Most of the transformation algorithms I have used are very simple, <br>
and sometimes involve 4 or more Sunes just to get the right case, so <br>
it&#x27;s not very efficient. It would be very nice if we could have a <br>
standard set of transformation algorithms that use the minimum <br>
amount of sequences.<br>
<br>
It would be elegant if we could have something like<br>
1 = Sune (R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;)<br>
2 = A-Sune (R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27;)<br>
3 = a move which only affects two corners<br>
4 = inverse of 3?<br>
<br>
using the minimum amount of sequences - 4 would be nice but I think <br>
we may have to use 6?<br>
<br>
Then we could write the algorithms as a combination of U moves and <br>
these move sequences.<br>
<br>
Example: U -&gt; L = U [1]<br>
         T -&gt; L = U&#x27; [2] U&#x27;<br>
<br>
Anybody willing to help work on this set? First thing would be to <br>
standardise a set of moves sequences to use.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ok.  So I&#x27;ve been experimenting with the Roux method and several<br>
variations of Step 4 (last 6 edges), as well as FMC.  Anyway, all this<br>
playing around has breathed new life into one of my old ideas.<br>
<br>
I was looking for ways to break the burden of the ZBLL up into easier<br>
chunks earlier in the solve.  My original idea was to use the last<br>
pair to try and fix corner orientation.  Something like 54 cases,<br>
probably long and definitely hard to recognize.  I also realized it<br>
would be most useful to learn how to earlier achieve correct<br>
permutation on the LL corners, as well as edges, leaving you with only<br>
a no corners perm ZBLL alg.  However, I couldn&#x27;t find good ways to do<br>
that, and it was something like 100+ cases, also probably difficult to<br>
recognize.  Last night, I had a new idea.<br>
<br>
What if you finished the F2L minus one pair?  As long as the corner is<br>
in the top layer, you have one of 3 possible cases.  Corner with white<br>
facing up, left, or right.  If you place this corner, there are 6<br>
possible cases for each of the 3 orientations above for fixing the LL<br>
corner perm.  Most of these are simple and intuitive (just different<br>
ways to place the corner: RUR&#x27;, U&#x27;F&#x27;UF, etc.).  18 cases total, not<br>
bad.  You could learn the 14 cases for when the corner is in the<br>
correct spot, if you wanted, but you pretty much always avoid those<br>
with some careful solving of the first three pairs.  COLL and CLL<br>
would come in handy, too.<br>
<br>
Next, if you solve the final middle layer edge, you can orient the LL<br>
edges at the same time.  20 more cases for fixing the LL edge<br>
orientation (edge in place but flipped: 4, edge at UR flipped: 8,<br>
mirrors of the last 8: 8).  38 cases (most of them are just 3 cycles<br>
of edges), and you&#x27;re left with a no corners perm ZBLL.  Add in those<br>
cases, and you&#x27;ve got 72 more (76 with the edge PLL&#x27;s).  114 total<br>
algs (just about half of which are reflections), but I&#x27;m not sure of<br>
the length yet.  I&#x27;ll keep working on that and post again.<br>
<br>
1/27 cases would be a simple edge PLL to finish.  If you could learn a<br>
few extra cases to place the final middle layer edge while also<br>
playing with corner orientation, you could increase that number<br>
substantially.  I know this may be a potentially longer method in<br>
terms of number of moves, but having an edge PLL for possibly 1/13.5<br>
solves or more has some definite potential. 1/162 solves, you get a LL<br>
skip!<br>
<br>
As an alternative, you could solve 3 cross pieces, 3 pairs, and use<br>
ZBF2L or VHF2L on the final pair, orienting edges, then perform COLL,<br>
and finish with any of the L5E algs Doug was nice enough to find for<br>
me.  This gives you more freedom for building the F2L and makes Xcross<br>
much easier.  If you like slice moves in the MU set, this might be a<br>
good way to go for you.<br>
<br>
Anywho, I&#x27;m tired of rambling, so someone else let me know what you think.<br>

I take it back.  There are really only 8 cases for when the corner is
already in the right spot, and these come up 1/5 of the time, so it&#x27;s
probably a good idea.  One of those is even just FRUR&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27; or its
inverse. 18 + 8 = 26.  Still not bad to get all the LL cases down to
no corner perm.  All in all, this step should average between 5 and 6
moves by my calculations, but probably closer to 5.  If I can find
nice enough algs, perhaps even under.

I was wrong again.  There are 3 cases for when the edge is in place, 3
for when it&#x27;s in place but flipped,  and then the other 8 and 8.  That
makes 22 instead of 20.  The average length for these should be
between 7 and 9, but I&#x27;m not certain yet.  The upside to this is that
they&#x27;re all performable with only MU and RU moves.  The hardest cases
are when 4 edges are flipped, but I&#x27;m working on ways to solve those
quickly. (read: Cubesolver, here I come...)

Anyway, that&#x27;s about 124 algs total, a good chunk of which we all
already know.  The average length is about 12 or 13, so it&#x27;s
comparable to learning ZBLL, but there are a whole lot less of them.

Around 27.5% of the time, you&#x27;re left with a Sune or Antisune ZBLL
case.  1/12 of those cases are just the normal algs.  Between those
and the edge PLL cases (not including the long Z perm), you have
greater than a 1/12 chance for a 7 move or less solve.  I wouldn&#x27;t
mind getting a Sune only solve once an average.

As for the final move count, that&#x27;s still a bit up in the air. 
Assuming a 23 move F2L minus the last pair, 6 moves to place the final
corner and permute the U corners, 9 moves to place the final middle
edge and orient the U edges, and 14 to finish with ZBLL, that&#x27;s still
a 52 move average.  However, I&#x27;m fairly certain you can get the F2L
step down closer to 20 using Xcross and opposite color solving, and
the other numbers are highballing it (just in case).  I think the
final average will be closer to 46-48 moves.  On top of only using 1/7
of the algs required for ZB (and only having 1/7 of the decision
choices to make on the fly, not to mention learning), it&#x27;s got a great
potential for spike times with skips and short cases.  A great
possible case that includes all of the steps could be as short as 17
moves after the F2L step.  With a decent F2L, that&#x27;s a non lucky
sub-40 moves.  Good enough for an advanced rank on the FMC.  Of
course, full ZB will inevitably average fewer moves, and have the
potential for bigger spikes and fewer moves, but I think this is a
nice compromise for number of algs and potential.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, so I&#x27;ve been gone for a while, and even since being back my heart<br>
has been into 4x4x4 BLD solving.  Well I finally set a good time for<br>
the 4x4x4, that I can be satisfied for at least a little while, so I&#x27;m<br>
back into working on ZB stuff again.<br>
<br>
Also I realized how often I recognize a ZBLL case and execute it<br>
during a Fridrich average and still get a good time.  I&#x27;ve accented a<br>
few Fridrich averages with a 13.xx or 14.xx ZBLL solve so far so I&#x27;m<br>
in this for the long run still.<br>
<br>
So far I&#x27;ve been asked to finish off the numbering system for cases on<br>
my site (though Doug has already done a number of these so I&#x27;ll just<br>
copy him there) and also to start working on analyzing the U<br>
orientation case 2 algs.<br>
<br>
I also need to add Dan H&#x27;s notation for ZBLL cases to my page.  It&#x27;s<br>
late now, but I wanted to post to say that I&#x27;m back and ready to work.<br>
<br>
Hope everyone is still doing well, and I hope you all are still<br>
motivated for ZB.  I still think it is an awesome method and can&#x27;t<br>
even get over how amazing it will be after we have optimized the ZBLL<br>
cases!  Seriously, even when I think &quot;this average will only be<br>
Fridrich&quot; and I see a ZBLL I know, I execute the ZBLL and still get a<br>
good solve.  Whether you are set on full ZB or a hybrid this method is<br>
awesome.  Plus the all edges correct ZBLL cases are the makings of a<br>
superawesome 3x3x3 BLD method, so we have to generate that set as well.<br>
<br>
Hope everyone is doing well, I&#x27;ll post again once I&#x27;ve finished my<br>
template pages and I&#x27;ll start my computer on analyzing the other half<br>
of the U2 cases.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll post again soon when I have stopped being a lazy bum and have<br>
brought more to the table :-)<br>

I got 3 zb cases in an average while talking to richard tonight.  I
locked up a little and had a long pause before 1, locked up a little
during another, and did one well, and got sub-19 for the first two and
sub-18 for the second.  Being out of practice with COLL/ZB and taking
an average for the first time in forever with no warmup (20.46), I was
pretty happy.

I think in the end, I&#x27;m definitely going to go with a hybrid.  When
you get a chance, Chris (and everyone else), look through my last two
posts.  There is some definite potential there, but I would like some
input.  Is there something obvious or useful I&#x27;m missing?

Wouldn&#x27;t these all just be commutators?  You can pretty much find them
all on Ryan Heise&#x27;s site.

Anyway, glad to have you back.  Hopefully now this group will pick
back up again.

That&#x27;s one of the nice things about using Roux, COLL+PLL, and PLL. 
When you start with Roux and get DF and DB placed, you can solve like
COLL+PLL or CLL+ELL, when you start with a cross and skip the OLL
after VH/ZBF2L you can use PLL, and you get nice PLL skips with COLL.

I think having two complimentary systems for the start of the solve is
just as important as for the later steps.  If you could use xcross,
normal cross, and Roux, especially using opposite color solving, for
example, you get very good odds of getting a nice start to most solves.

-Mike

P.S.  I really think the only way ZB will pan out for me is if I can
find a way to narrow it down to only no corners perm cases.  They&#x27;re
fast, easy to recognize, and there are only 72 of them (which we all
know at least 6).  Someone figure that out!

Chris: I posted the raw U2 algs I generated on ACube in the files

think you&#x27;ll have to re-run them.

I have an idea for the U2 with edges circular.

Mike: It&#x27;s quite in here because it takes us forever to read your 
lengthy posts, try to split them up a bit if you can. I used to 
write long posts, but then realized how bad that is. For me it feels

I get tempted to run all the cases for this CP idea of yours...

Ok.  I&#x27;d just about given up on ZB, but I knew there had to be a way<br>
to make it work for me that was obvious and I was missing.  I&#x27;ve been<br>
brainstorming with Richard for the past few days, and I found it. <br>
Combine a Roux start (two 1x2x3 blocks) minus 1 pair.  Use VHF2L to<br>
insert that pair, flipping all of the edges either to solved or to 3<br>
incorrect edges on top.  After that, use COLL to solve corners, and<br>
you&#x27;re left with 6 edges to permute.  30% of the time, you get 1 of<br>
the DF or DB edges solved, and you&#x27;re left with an L5E alg.  The rest<br>
of the time, you can just finish the cube as in normal Roux solves for<br>
a very efficient finish.<br>
<br>
Quick stats:<br>
9/32 you can place the pair normally with no VH necessary<br>
15/32 for a normal VH alg<br>
8/32 give you a VH alg with a D edge to flip*<br>
~1/8 you&#x27;d get an orient skip completely<br>
~7/8 orienting would be 3 moves<br>
3/10 for an L5E finish (~8 average)<br>
<br>
Based on what we&#x27;ve tried so far, I think the average for this could<br>
be very low, given the freedom in constructing two blocks to start.<br>
Assuming the last pair doesn&#x27;t average too many moves, this method is<br>
solid.  For a while earlier, I was averaging &gt;45 moves on slow solves<br>
(and my two blocks stage is atrocious).  Non-lucky 35 move solves are<br>
nice, too. :)<br>
<br>
Crap.  This is getting long.  :P  Anyway, I was wondering whether<br>
Chris or Doug would have time to look into using ACube to find some<br>
nice cases for this.  If this pans out, expect results. Please and<br>
thank you ahead of time, if anyone does.<br>

Anyways, I&#x27;ve just been trying to progress with ZB, I haven&#x27;t given 
up on it. Not sure why, maybe I&#x27;m just more okay with holding on to 
a lot of algs in my memory.

Today I finished learning all the L1 algs from my page:
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/zblll1.html

I started using some T1 algs I haven&#x27;t fully learned, but I guess 
Sune compositions aren&#x27;t hard to work with. So I have have about 1 
or 2 algs left to finish all the No CP ZBLL.

I have been forgetting Case 6 algs again, and Case 8+9 aren&#x27;t 
sticking.

I should make a few revisions to the last 4 there, but I have lots 
of hw tonight.

This should take over the 32% mark for ZBLL...

It&#x27;s great to hear you&#x27;re getting so far with it!  I was worried that
people were losing interest because of how quiet it&#x27;s gotten on here
lately.  Hopefully once more people are back at school or into the
normal swing of things, this will pick back up.

Anyway, congrats, Doug.

          <div class="email-content">Nothing to be worried about, its a big undertaking and should take a 
lot of time, but be aware that the more algs you know the easier it is 
to pick up more, it&#x27;s an exponential learning curve from my experience.

I finished L1, just need a couple more T1 and I&#x27;ll have all the no CP.

You&#x27;re right though, ppl are losing interest. But that is OKAY. 
Peronsally, I need time to get adjusted to using all htese algs I now 
know.

I caught Chris&#x27;s addiction/fad of blindfold solving big cubes. Just 
today I made a video of myself doing a 4x4 in 26 minutes. Lots of 30s 
pauses where I do absolutley nothing and choke or course. I feel 
confident to do a 5x5 :) now.

But yes, I really should post my S1, H1, and Pi1 sets sometime. this 
is certainly going to be my roughest semester academically though.

If and when you get bored next, would you do me a favor?  I&#x27;ve pretty
much decided on a definite path for my speedsolve method, and it&#x27;s
basically Roux+VHF2L+L5E.  Would you be able to run any of the VH algs
(cases 1 and 13 ZBF2L) with a free M slice?  I&#x27;m absolutely certain
this can cut down moves and make this very useful.  Centers would need
to remain fixed, but the position of last 6 edges and the U corners
can change as needed.

I understand if you can&#x27;t get these done for a while.  I&#x27;m not in a
big rush yet.  I still have to learn my L5E...

Thanks ahead of time.

          <div class="email-content">Okay, but personally I feel that the current set of Case 1 and 13 
are really good as they are.

The only difference is that me and Chris now use the following 
algorithm instead of the one listed:
L F L&#x27; U2 M&#x27; U M (inverse to setup)

But I assume stuff like this is what you wanted to see. I have all 
the case 1+13 fully locked into my brain now so it would take some 
serious effort to change them now.

I&#x27;m not as certain as you about M being able to cut down moves, but 
I&#x27;ll see what I can do, probably won&#x27;t get to it today though.

Well, I&#x27;ve been lazy and haven&#x27;t worked on ZB for a while now.  To be<br>
honest BLD solving has consumed me, but funny how things come full<br>
circle sometimes.<br>
<br>
So I&#x27;ve finally decided to learn the BLD method I&#x27;ve been thinking<br>
about since after seeing Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s BLD method where he does<br>
orientation and permutation at the same time.<br>
<br>
My idea is to use the no-edge-perm ZBLL to solve corners like Stefan,<br>
but use 3 cycles in stead of 2-swaps.  Then I&#x27;ll use ELL for the edges<br>
to do the same.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve done example solves using lookup sheets before, and I like the<br>
idea very much.<br>
<br>
Well, BLD still consumes me, but has come full circle to incorporate a<br>
large subset of ZBLL that I don&#x27;t know very much of.<br>
<br>
So in short, I&#x27;m a very weird person in that I switch around a lot in<br>
my cubing and focus really hard on things for a short time, stop for a<br>
while, then come back.  But it turns out that I&#x27;m back to ZBLL, and I<br>
want to learn this subset very badly.<br>
<br>
I also don&#x27;t know ELL yet lol, so that is another thing to look into.<br>
<br>
Anyway I hope everyone is well, I&#x27;ve missed some of the recent<br>
progress in what has been going on, so sorry to be all focused on ZB<br>
and then to just disappear.<br>

          <div class="email-content">For those wondering what the heck I&#x27;m talking about with my this BLD
method, here is my idea.

Solve like Stefan by doing orientation and position at once, but do
three cycles instead of 2 swaps.

I don&#x27;t know if I am the iventor of this approach, but I&#x27;ve been
wanting to learn how to do this ever since I saw Stefan&#x27;s idea.

Here is an example solve.  I used ACube to supply the ZBLL algs I
didn&#x27;t know, and I did edges in a way as to not use any ELL I don&#x27;t know.

The cube is solved completely in 7 algorithms:

Sscramble from JNetcube: D2 U2 F2 D L2 B2 R&#x27; L&#x27; B2 F2 L R&#x27; U&#x27; D L2 U
F2 B2 L U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; D2 R&#x27; U&#x27;

CORNERS:
1) x&#x27; L2 D L&#x27; U2 L D&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L&#x27; x
2) D&#x27; B2 (F&#x27; L F&#x27; R2 F L&#x27; F&#x27; R2 F2) B2 D
3) F D F&#x27; (R D L U&#x27; L D L&#x27; U L D2 R D L2 D&#x27; R2) F D&#x27; F&#x27;

EDGES:
1) L (L2 U&#x27; F&#x27; B L2 F B&#x27; U&#x27; L2) L&#x27;
2) B2 (x2 L2 U&#x27;F&#x27;B L2 F B&#x27; U&#x27; L2x2) B2
3) F R&#x27; (M&#x27; B&#x27;)x4 R F&#x27;
4) R&#x27; B2 R2 B2 R2 B2 R&#x27;

I want to know this BLD method.  very... badly..

Hope you guys find it interesting.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I started reviewing my ZBF2L and ZBLL today.  I had only gone fuzzy on<br>
3-4 T-case ZBLL algs and about half of the U algs.  Also I still have<br>
5-10 ZBF2L that I&#x27;m fuzzy on, but it feels good to know I haven&#x27;t<br>
forgotten much after this long hiatus.<br>
<br>
Also, in response to Mike&#x27;s question about ZBF2L, I talked to Lars V<br>
about that, and we think that if it uses too many extra moves it would<br>
prolong F2L too much, since ZBF2L is slower than F2L anyway, and it&#x27;s<br>
really worth it.  Also a lot of the all edges incorrect ZBF2L cases<br>
are actually really, really nice.<br>
<br>
Sometimes on the third pair I&#x27;ll do partial edge control to orient<br>
edges, and you can also do this to flip edges, and get an all edges<br>
incorrect case.<br>
<br>
So yeah I think partial edge control is a good idea for the 3rd pair,<br>
but otherwise that extends the F2L move count alot and you lose time,<br>
even with an RU finish for ZBF2L.<br>
<br>
Just my $0.02 though,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Mike,

Yes, this has been thought about a little before I&#x27;m sure. It&#x27;s 
quite possible to orient edges during the 3rd or even 2nd pair, but 
therein lie a couple of problems (at least problems I haven&#x27;t worked 
out a strategy for yet!)

Firstly, because when coming to the 3rd pair, you have 2 unsolved 
pairs, it&#x27;s quite difficult to spot exactly the orientation of the 
edges, and which edges if any need to be affected. Sometimes it&#x27;s 
can look like you have no good edges, and so you might insert a pair 
R&#x27; F R F&#x27;, but the situation was such that it didn&#x27;t really help 
matters, because you may have flipped one edge while unflipping 
another. 

Also, if you try to flip edges during the 2nd pair, it gets 
increasingly hard to make sure to not undo in the 3rd pair what you 
have made good in the 2nd pair :)

I would love to hear ideas on this.

Dan :)
