        I&#x27;d like to know. My opinion about the two 1x2x3? Build a 1x2x3 in
        an outer layer, and another 1x2x3 in the opposite outer layer. No more
        constraint, because this result is interesting for both speedcubing and
        fewest-moves. Gilles.

        Hello Gilles =) I tried something a bit similair to your methods first
        step a while ago. I start with a &quot;cross&quot; of three edges (one
        from FL and two from ML) on one of the sides (R,F,L or B) then I add two
        FL-corners and two FL-edges to build a 2x2x3. This can be done in a mass
        of ways (pair up and insert like CFOP-F2L for example) and often it ends
        in rather few moves like 12-13 (well, not always but often).

        Hi :-) I use that or else i use white paper and a tape loop made from 5
        cm wide clear tape. The latter is much more durable and sticks well even
        on the Studio cube stickers. Post-it stickers do not stick well on the
        Studio cube stickers for some reason :-( I normally hardly ever use more
        than 5 extra numbered stickers at a time. That caters for corner 5-cycle
        and also corner 3-cycle and a single twisted corner. For both those
        cases i use/need 5 stickers. When inserting both a corner 3-cycle and
        edge 3-cycle i can do them independently :-) Cheers! -Per PS! For this
        kind of edge 5-cycle M D M&#x27; D&#x27; also 5 stickers only is needed.
        Make a drawing how the stickers should be placed (or use a second cube)
        when finding the required setup moves. > --- In

        Hi everyone, First of all, thanks to everyone who took part in the
        Christmas Challenge FMC! I have a lot of entries to deal with, and I
        will promise to post the results on the FMC page sometime tomorrow
        morning :) There were lots of great solutions as always! Finally,
        FMC#102 will be launched at midnight tonight, falling back down to earth
        after the novelties of the TeamFMC100 and then the Christmas Challenge,
        with a regular FMC scramble. All you have to do is solve the scramble in
        as least moves as possible! All are welcome, and it is always great to
        have new people on board! Yes, that includes all you speedcubers too!
        Good Luck! Dan :)

        better, because of few double turns and thus low QTM. But 38 would make

        Hi, FMcubers, I&#x27;m back here and I&#x27;m wondering how everybody
        did in the Christmas Challenge :-) Per, in your last case with 3-cycles
        of both edges and corners, I prefer to mark all 6 cubies for a simple
        reason that I preferably look for 4 moves for solving edges like
        U&#x27;R U R&#x27; and such. It also permutes 4 corners three of which
        may be the 3 not yet solved. Sometimes one additional move is enough to
        position the corners right. It&#x27;s quite likely that I may end up
        with some other 3-cycle of corners. Mirek --- In

        Hi Stefan :-) For now Dan is only rating in htm :-) He has promised (i
        think he has ...) to switch to rating in all metrics soon, so for ur
        rating u should then submit the 38 htm solution, putting the second
        solution in the quote of ur solution ;-) My preferred metric however is
        stm now. I consider it to be most fair, and also it&#x27;s always the
        shortest one ;-) Another not often discussed metric is the axial metric.
        For every axial used increase count with one. So something (familiar)
        like : (F B R L)*3 will have length 6 in that metric. F B are on same
        axis, same with R L so F B R L is length 2, and repeated 3 times gives 6
        in total. This metric is somewhat similar to Chris Hardwick&#x27;s
        metric for larger cube. He counts chunks of adjacent-layer moves as only
        1 move. However long we discuss metrics i don&#x27;t think everyone will
        ever agree what is the best ;-) Cheers! -Per > --- In

        Mmh... I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s similar. He moves one block
        relative to the rest of the cube. In that axial metric, you have 3 parts
        moving relative to each other. That&#x27;s a big difference in my
        opinion. I think of a move as a part of the cube standing still, and
        moving another part. I&#x27;m always moving one part at a time. Axial
        metric moves two parts at the same time, and my brain doesn&#x27;t like
        to do more than one thing at a time :-) Cheers! Stefan

        Hi :-) The same scrambling technique has also given some of the worst
        (toughest) scrambles i have seen. Im only happy that there is a huge
        variety in the &quot;complexity&quot; of the scrambles for the FMC. Is
        it really desired to have some kinda quality control over the scrambles?
        How to do that? Who will do it? I think rigorous control over the
        complexity of the scrambles will make it less fun. It&#x27;s nice to
        know that the scramble is indeed random and that sometimes real easy
        solutions are possible. Unusual as a 3-move roux block or 6-move 2x2x3
        might be it doesn&#x27;t make the scramble useless. The scramble was
        same for everyone and was suitable for many different approaches :-)

        Well, I think &quot;corners only&quot; should *always* include the
        centers. Otherwise the name is bad because then it&#x27;s no need to
        talk about the corners of a 3x3, instead the 2x2 cube should be used.
        Actually I&#x27;d prefer to call it &quot;corners + centers&quot;. And
        if Dan wants to keep requiring centers for Roux blocks, it should be
        &quot;Roux blocks + centers&quot;. Ok ok, when you explain the cube to
        little dumb kids it might be helpful to tell them the centers are
        something special they can hold on to. But I like to think of it as just
        one out of 21 pieces that I have to match. Is a 40x25 pieces jigsaw
        puzzle called &quot;999 pieces puzzle&quot; because you have to solve
        999 relative to one certain one? No. So &quot;centers&quot; should be
        explicitly mentioned if they shall be solved. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        So you like playing with our words ;) Of course I meant &quot;corners
        only&quot; for &quot;corners only&quot; :) That way you solve a 2x2x2,
        and consider the DBL corner as already solved. I guess Dan added some
        slice moves at the end of my solution in order to line up the centers
        with respect to the corners. I would not have done it like this (of
        course), I would just have transformed my U&#x27;L F L&#x27; F&#x27; U
        L2 D2 into: U&#x27;L F l&#x27; F&#x27; U L2 d2 = U&#x27; L F R&#x27;
        D&#x27; F L2 F2, following the way Charles used in a previous post.
        (8,10,8,10) as well, exactly the same as Mirek&#x27;s now ... I know the
        challenge is over now, but in the spirit of a center-first approach, I
        could hardly imagine the need of aligning the centers. --- In

        agree, everyone has the same scramble and that&#x27;s the most important
        thing. But you know, people are interested in world records and we
        should avoid choosing a scrambling method that has 1% chances of
        generating lucky configurations that should almost never occur. The
        technique used may be ok, I don&#x27;t know. In this easy scramble,
        IIRC, there was a part with (RB2R&#x27;U2)4. That&#x27;s 16 moves that
        may do not generate a lot of chaos. Why can&#x27;t we just use a

        doesn&#x27;t seem to have much effect (STM was the winner by far), I
        guess we&#x27;ll have to live with HTM forever. One reason could be
        simplicity, HTM can&#x27;t be ignored cause most people use it, and
        maybe it&#x27;s too complicated to have two different metrics in the
        rules? It&#x27;s used for scrambling, and for example for Megaminx there
        isn&#x27;t really an alternative (except fifth turn metric) since there
        are no inner slices. Ok, I hereby suggest the &quot;new&quot; metric
        &quot;LTM&quot;. It&#x27;s the same as STM but means &quot;layer turn
        metric&quot;. Just because people think &quot;slice&quot; = &quot;inner
        slice&quot;, which is not the case for &quot;layer&quot;. Or maybe
        we&#x27;ll just have to win the next WC (speed 3x3 I mean) with Roux,
        Corners first or similar, something where LTM appears more
        natural/obvious... Cheers! Stefan

        I think HTM is definitely biased toward a specific type of solution. As
        someone who greatly prefers finishing with edges, it really limits what
        I&#x27;m able to do. I&#x27;m glad the normal speedsolving rules have
        changed so that slice moves are considered for +2 penalties instead of
        DNF&#x27;s now, but I&#x27;m unsure why FMC wasn&#x27;t impacted by
        this. The logic behind allowing slightly misalinged slices is that for
        methods that aren&#x27;t standard CFOP, slices are used far more
        frequently as single moves, so they should be considered as such when
        determining if the puzzle is solved. In FMC, what counts as solved
        hasn&#x27;t changed, but slice moves are no longer considered valid
        moves. Why is that? As it seems to me, this would equalize different
        methods for FMC and allow more people and solutions opportunities, but
        that&#x27;s not the point. The point is, slices count as a single move
        in every other aspect of cubing, and I don&#x27;t understand why they
        don&#x27;t for FMC. I know it seems baised to say this, because I
        greatly prefer STM, but I really can&#x27;t see why slices are counted
        as two moves. Anti-slice moves and unequal slice moves (LR2) still seem
        like separate moves to me, so axial metric would be unfair (sorry Per),
        but HTM is pretty much forcing people to adopt a specific type of
        solution to be competitive in FMC at all. That&#x27;s equivalent to
        forcing every speedcuber to use Fridrich (which it also seems like
        sometimes). Just my thoughts on the subject... -Mike > > --- In

        Hi all, Which metric is the best / fairest / most honest / smartest ? I
        don&#x27;t think we should discuss that subject again here ;-) As Gilles
        said in his last post, we spent a huge amount of time discussing the
        pros and cons of each metric, we voted, and submitted the result to WCA
        ears . .. They decided to keep HTM, ok. We can discuss again and agree
        that another should be chosen (I voted for STM as well), but I doubt it
        would change anything ... However, I wanted to react to Mike&#x27;s
        post. I do NOT think that choosing HTM forces any of us to stick to a
        unique method ... and to which one, by the way ? Most of the submitted
        solutions are optimized Petrus-like solves, but Sebastian and Charles
        have a different way for solving the cube after the initial 2x2x3.
        Mirek&#x27;s sense of anticipation and QTM optimization is amazing and
        his solutions are quite far from classical petrus approaches. Zbigniew
        posts nearly always sub-40 solutions with his speed mehod. Per
        introduced his edges-first solutions a few months ago and now he has
        demonstrated that it is a really powerful approach ... all these
        approaches are derived from speedcubing methods, but they were
        re-optimized in order to match FMC regulations. Gilles himself is
        getting scores in the low 30&#x27;s in a few minutes, and expert
        solutions quite often when he takes the time to optimize his solve.
        Everyone is dreaming of a method that could combine both speed and FM
        advantages ... but I think we should not forget what the &quot;C&quot;
        of FMC stands for ... it is indeed a challenge to struggle with a
        scramble during hours in order to optimize a solution ;) So you Roux
        solvers, go for it ! There may exist a slight modification in
        Gilles&#x27; method (like changing the order of the steps, or permuting
        the L5E or L6E by inserting commutators within the previous moves, .. .)
        that could make you win all next FMC&#x27;s ... Good luck ... ... and
        explain it in your next winning solutions quotes once you have found it
        :) cyril --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Mike

        My initial response was not to rebirth controversy. Perhaps I was not
        clear in my ideas. This is my idea: * Keep HTM as the Primary metric for
        competitions. For specific competition rankings. (1st Place, 2nd Place,
        etc) This would give consistency within individual competitions I think.
        * Recognize a WR for each seperate metric. While a CF solver might not
        place first in HTM because of the nature of the solution, a WR could
        still be set in STM. This would at least give recognition to brilliant
        solutions in all metrics. This would of course leave all methods
        (somewhat) equal, and provide incentive to explore otherwise unappealing
        solutions in competition environments. -Richard --- Cyril Castella

        Hi :-) I never said i was in favor of the axial metric as the official
        metric for fewest moves competitions. I have openly favored slice turn
        metric as the most objective one. I mentioned the axial metric as an
        alternative one (theoretically) to the other 4 common metrics. That was
        all ;-) Quarter turn metrics have more a mathematical appeal than
        practical importance. A layer turn is a layer turn in my eyes,
        regardless if it&#x27;s a half turn or a quarter turn. Htm does not
        honor inner slice turns, so im ending up favoring the stm. The fact that
        scrambling is done using solely outer layer turns is for practical
        reasons. Scramblers are not necessarily cubers and need something easy
        to relate to :-) Those who do fewest moves and judge such solutions
        should be (in general) more knowledgeable than the scramblers ;-) A
        practical problem from having stm as the official metric would be those
        cases where a solution is submitted that is not optimised notationwise
        in the metric, like for instance ... D F2 R&#x27; L B ... In my opinion
        it should not be the responsibility of judges/organisers to see that
        R&#x27; L is a slice turn. It must be the competitors responisbility (in
        offline competitions) to write those moves in brackets if stm was the
        official metric used. Alternatively, use inner slice move notation (MES)
        and transform the moves accordingly. Using MES we no longer have that a
        certain center-color is one particular layer ;-) So personally i would
        not use MES in my notation cause i lose the relation between color and
        facename. Umm, maybe except in cases of commutators where i would use
        say E and then followed by E&#x27; later on. Well you know what i mean

        Hi friends, This discussion keeps going on and on. :-) Please give me a
        better argument than not to favor systems. Because I feel that you favor
        slice systems if you use STM. :-) Look at almost all scientific stuff on
        Rubik&#x27;s cube. You hardly see slices counted as 1 move. QTM would be
        a more scientific approach, and HTM is nicely in the middle. Would
        antislices be one move too (Fa &lt;=> Fs)? If you are a true fewest
        moves competitor, then you just follow the rules and find a solution
        that fits the rules the best. That way changing from HTM to STM would
        actually be a bad thing, because you have so much experience now in
        solving HTM. :-) This discussion is a bit like: we should make the
        hurdles for 110 meters hurdles lower, because then people who jump
        backwards could also participate. :-) If the hurdles would be lower or
        higher, then we would have a very different event! Anyway, I am still
        not convinced. I am open to discussions for the 2007 version of the
        regulation. But we need better arguments than favoring systems. Have
        fun, Ron ----- Original Message ----- From: Per Kristen Fredlund To:

        Hi :-) Why should we bother about scientific literature? Those articles
        are written by mathematicians for the most part, and they are not
        speedcubers and certainly not fewest moves cubers ;-) The natural choice
        for an &quot;objective&quot; metric is either htm (cause everyone
        understands it) or stm cause i feel that metric does not really favor
        any particular solving system whereas htm truly does. Sorry Ron, this is
        the key point in this discussion. Like it or not. And who are the
        &quot;we&quot; u refer to? Surely not everyone on the WCA board has the
        same opinion on this? I know for sure that Gilles is the only one on the
        board who does fewest moves and he does not favor htm as the official
        metric in competitions. Well anyway, i&#x27;m fine with either htm or
        stm used as the official metric in competitions to decide a winner.
        Richard Patterson&#x27;s idea about separate world records for each
        metric is a great idea. As he said in his post that will be a great
        incentive (motivation) for whichever method used. To come up with many
        winners (due to different metrics) would be ridiculous :D Happy cubing
        :-) -Per PS! I&#x27;m also in favor of using some software to determine
        the length of solutions in competitions. This will require that a judge
        copies the written solution on the paper to the software (as well as the
        scramble) and then both confirm the solution is correct and finds the
        length (in various metrics). Obviously the matter of confirming a fewest
        moves solution is less trivial than confirming validity of a speedsolve.
        Somehow there should be rules for this in the WCA fewest moves
        regulations. Even i benefitted from this in Orlando, writing down a
        solution in parts and not as a continuous sequence that makes up the
        full solution should not be accepted in my opinion. Well unless the
        solution is just doing one part after another, and there is no
        insertions needed to be done by a judge :-) Thinking about it, there
        should be a standard form for submitting the solution like on Dan&#x27;s
        pages. One field for the solution and one field for the explanation. And
        so on ... :-) Only the standard form should be accepted. Not the
        &quot;working papers&quot;. (Sorry about the long PS!) > --- In

        That&#x27;s probably because those people hardly are able to think about
        slice turns. They&#x27;re just happy they&#x27;ve found something to
        hold on (the centers) so they don&#x27;t get lost all the time. They
        fear if they move the centers, all hell will break loose and thus they
        never even think about twisting anything that moves centers and never
        discover slice turns. But like Per already mentioned, what do we have to
        do with them? Cheers! Stefan

        When viewed as a puzzle for two hands, it is easy to see why those moves
        that divide the cube into two segments (e.g. quarter turns, half turns),
        are the least controversial of moves. They are the easiest and most
        natural to perform with two hands. That is the &quot;physical&quot;
        view. The &quot;logical&quot; view is to ignore the hands, and say that
        if we think of a sequence as 4 basic &quot;logical&quot; movements, then
        it consists of 4 moves. I personally can&#x27;t remove myself from the
        physical view, because to me the cube will always be a puzzle for the
        hands, even if we do think about the cube logically in our heads. By way
        of example: - M2 is counted as 1 move in STM, but I don&#x27;t see any
        natural way to perform it physically in 1 move with two hands. If M2 is
        performed as two moves, why should we count it as 1 move? - Even
        &quot;M&quot; is often performed as 2 moves, according to videos
        I&#x27;ve seen. - On a 5x5x5 cube, taking the notation R[n] (1 &lt;= n
        &lt;= 5) for a movement of the nth layer relative to face R, the
        sequence (R[2]2 R[4]2) (F[1]2) (R[2]2 R[4]2) (F[1]2) can be seen as 4
        logical moves (that&#x27;s the way you would think about it in your
        head, right?). However, without 5 physical hands, it would be difficult
        (or impossible?) to perform it in 4 physical moves. We can use whatever
        logic we want in our heads, but I think that any measurement of a
        solution should not be based on the number of logical steps (Fridrich is
        only 7 steps), but on the number of physical steps. For that, we need to
        consider the hands, and HTM seems to be one of the least controversial
        metrics we have for two-handed solves. Ryan

        You can perform slice moves with one motion quite easily. M&#x27; with a

        counted inner slice turns as single moves. The OLL parity sounds much
        more daunting at 22 or more moves than 15. Again, I favor slice moves,
        but they are generally very easy to perform as single clicks of a

        to do with following the thoughts of the cuber than what seems practical
        for actual execution. As for the ambiguities involved with submitting a
        solution containing slice turns, it should be left entirely up to the
        competitor to mark their solution in the way that leaves them with the
        most desirable movecount. If he submits U R L&#x27; F, for example, that
        should be four moves. If he were to submit U {R L&#x27;} F, that would
        be 3. If a speecuber can be expected to correctly stop the timer, not

        Again, I think there is no reason not to at least have WR recognition
        for all metrics. Beyond that I don&#x27;t care which metric becomes
        primary. At least then all styles of solving become equal. To say these
        are the rules, and you should change your solution method
        accordingly...This is an incredibly ludacris idea, and unquestionably
        discriminates against any methods that favor slice turns. Would it be so
        difficult for the WCA to recognize: FMC; HTM World Record FMC; STM World
        Record Surely having that extra record spot is not an inconvenience to
        anyone. Obviously a primary metric has to be used within a competition.
        This should not prevent seperate world records in each metric. Is this
        not a reasonable compromise? At least for the time being. -Richard ---

        Hi again friends, Richard: > I think there is no reason not to at least

        bit strange situation: you try to solve in as few moves in HTM, which
        could be a longer solution in QTM. Anyway, let me know if there is a
        majority for this idea. Richard: > To say these are the rules, and you

        that favor slice turns. Of course setting a standard discriminates at
        least some other systems. That is my whole point. If the hurdles were
        taller, then you discriminate short people, or people jumping backwards.
        If the hurdles were shorter, then you discriminate people with good
        jumping techniques. Same goes if you change the distance between the
        hurdles. Mike: > You can perform slice moves with one motion quite
        easily. Have you ever seen a beginner do that? I think only 10% of pro
        cubers can actually do that. And still it would be an awkward move.
        Mike: > As for larger cubes, I thought the general consensus > counted
        inner slice turns as single moves. I don&#x27;t think so. I think it
        goes for double slices (like Rr) nowadays, but not for internal slices
        (r). Not many people use an internal slice OLL parity for 4x4x4. Stefan:
        > Look at this alg: [M D M&#x27;, U] = (M D M&#x27;) U (M D&#x27;

        fundamental step in my thinking. > Why on earth would I think of it as
        two steps? It&#x27;s just one! That is exactly what I mean. This
        algorithm is absolutely favoring STM! How many moves would you need in

        all. Because it sucks for HTM. Stefan: > More than most other (*)

        thinking, ultimately not measuring how I solve. Because you see many
        different ways of solving, you are a person who wants &#x27;the hurdles
        to be lower&#x27;. Then you can use different jumping systems. But I am
        better jumper, so I want the hurdles to be higher. Seeing STM the same
        as HTM puts me in a disadvantage for now. Although I could prepare
        myself in STM, and maybe become better at it. Stefan: > They fear if

        even think about twisting anything that moves centers and never discover
        > slice turns. Indeed. Slice moves change the orientation of the cube to
        most HTM solvers. Very hard for them (centers fixed). On the other hand:
        to corners first solvers using HTM moves (RL&#x27;) is very hard,
        because it changes orientation of the cube to them (corners fixed) No
        discrimination here. Per: > Why should we bother about scientific
        literature? Example: Singmaster was doing this before many of us were
        born, and don&#x27;t tell me he did not make good contributions, even to
        your current thinking. Per: > The natural choice for an
        &quot;objective&quot; metric is either htm (cause > everyone understands
        it) or stm cause i feel that metric does not > really favor any
        particular solving system whereas htm truly does. Look at the current
        categories of solving methods. Then look at the average number of moves
        per method. In general you could say that a system depending on slice
        moves takes fewer moves, with the same work and memorisation. Beginners
        example: The Ideal solution takes 120-150 HTM. A similar corners first
        system takes 80-110 moves in STM. That is a huge difference.
        Professional example: CFOP system takes 50-60 moves HTM. Waterman system
        takes 40-48 moves STM. What I am trying to say is that you can achieve
        more with STM, so solutions are shorter. An interesting question is how
        many slices moves does Waterman system need? If you would count them
        double, then you would be close to the CFOP system. Even if you would
        use standard Roux system, then you would only use a few slice moves. So
        I don&#x27;t think HTM favors systems at all, and I also think that STM
        does favor systems that use many slice moves. Counting slice moves as 2
        moves, gives about equal chances to HTM and STM solvers. Counting slices
        moves as 1 move, gives better chances to STM solvers. Per: > And who are
        the &quot;we&quot; u refer to? Surely not everyone on the WCA > board
        has the same opinion on this? I hope that remark was not meant nastily.
        OF COURSE with &#x27;we&#x27; I meant: our community. Everyone is equal
        here. But my goal is to come to a conclusion. That is much harder than
        just talking about ideas. The current choice was done because the
        community was not able to come to a conclusion. And still we are
        discussing. Should we have waited until the discussion was over, before
        organizing competitions? Per: > To come up with many winners (due to
        different metrics) would be > ridiculous :D I agree. Fewest moves is a
        relatively impopular event in competitions: we do not have many
        competitions with the event (2005: 3), and not many competitors (2005:
        11) in each event. To me this doesn&#x27;t sound like we need more
        fewest moves events with different formats. It would be great to hear
        ideas on how to make Fewest moves events more popular. Per: > I&#x27;m

        we need better arguments than favoring systems. Very simple, better and
        old arguments: - Any child with an eye or two who sees a 3x3x3 cube for
        the first time can see 3 free equal slices in every direction. Slice 1,
        slice 2, slice 3. They all can be rotated the same way, around the very
        same axis, that&#x27;s what makes the cube so magical and perfect. -
        Because corners are the pieces that generate more complexity, moving
        slice 2 even is less complex than moving slices 1 or 3. I agree, not
        favoring systems is the worst argument. When a system sucks, don&#x27;t
        invent a metric to make it shine. Other bad arguments: Speedcubing and
        dexterity concerns, or taking software solvers as a reference when they
        decided to work with a more simple model (fixed centers, and a reduced
        set of moves) to make things convenient, even if solutions found are
        slightly longer. Keeping notation simple enough for competitions is a
        concern, but since all FMC competitors are experts, that should not be a
        problem. Considering that someone is &quot;jumping backwards&quot;
        because he does not see cube solving through a FaceTM-filter is not the
        right image. I would prefer another one. Because hurdles seemed to high
        or unatural to jump, some competitors decided it was safer and faster to
        jump over them with one leg only, the other leg on the side. They
        practiced this technique only. But other competitors decided that, after
        all, jumping over with the two legs was very possible and natural...
        hum... just another stupid image. :-) Now a fact: If some people
        optimize for XTM only and other people optimize for YTM only, choosing
        XTM, YTM or ZTM as the official metric can&#x27;t make them all happy.
        And we need only *one* metric. But maybe you remember an idea I was
        suggesting last year. 0) In my opinion, the gap between the length of
        slice-based speedcubing methods and face-based speedcubing methods is
        different for fewest-moves solving (try to find a sub-25 STM solution
        every week using a corners-first system, if it&#x27;s so easy). 1)
        *Pure* F(Q)TM-solving often leads to 1-2 move shorter S(Q)TM solutions.
        2) An F(Q)TM-expert who decides to use a few rather basic
        S(Q)TM-friendly tricks could reduce the move count even more. ---> I was
        hoping for Face-experts to try to do their best to optimize for slices
        (Per, I think you tried it, your opinion?), to know how easy it is.
        You&#x27;ll tell me that, similarly, a Face-metric could be good for a
        slice-expert with more efforts. That&#x27;s why I was asking for a STM
        Cube Explorer (Kociemba did not answer). It could prove, maybe, that
        inner-slices are not that useful to reduce the move count, less than
        they are for speedcubing, if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s frightening people.
        No really, if someone proves mathematically that if, under STM, the
        average length of perfect STM solves is 17.1, and the average length of
        perfect HTM solves with unwanted lucky slice optimizations is 17.3,
        wouldn&#x27;t it change something? Gilles. PS: Choosing whether to use a
        quarter-turn or half-turn based metric is another topic of course. PS2:
        Please don&#x27;t mention anti-slice moves (by the way, the
        &quot;anti&quot; prefix is not well choosen, it&#x27;s not the opposite
        of an inner-slice move). I may mistaken, but I think this problem has
        not been raised before and it leads directly to the axial metric.

        As Ron pointed out, Waterman only requires about three quarters the
        moves of Fridrich (in &quot;STM&quot;, that is) to solve a cube, but
        roughly the same number of moves in HTM. If we were to actually see a
        Waterman practitioner solve a cube in three quarters the time of the
        best Fridrich practitioner (on average), then there would be some
        evidence to suggest that STM measures movements of the hands comparably
        for Waterman and Fridrich. Presently, it would seem that HTM measures
        movements of the hands more comparably for Waterman and Fridrich than
        does STM. According to current timings, it would seem that: * the
        average appearance of M &quot;in an algorithm&quot; is slower than the
        average appearance of R in an algorithm. * the average appearance of M2
        &quot;in an algorithm&quot; is slower than the average appearance of R2
        in an algorithm. I can&#x27;t say I know &quot;why&quot;, just that
        current timings of solutions seem to suggest this. If I were to guess at
        &quot;why&quot;, I would say that the problem is only slightly caused by
        the additional friction of movements of two joints (for a three-segment
        move) rather than one (for a two-segment move) and the less muscle
        available to force the movement (the opposable finger *and* thumb are
        generally not &quot;both&quot; available to force the movement of the
        middle slice, since one or the other will hold one of the outer layers
        to stop it from moving), since a well-lubed cube can minimise this
        problem. If that is only a &quot;slight&quot; factor, I would say that
        the major factor is that, since these moves require more fingers in
        precise locations, it can take longer to get your fingers into place
        before you&#x27;re ready to perform a move, and longer to get them to
        the next place after the move. This would only be a problem when an M or
        M2 appears &quot;in an algorithm&quot; (as was the case set above). I
        may indeed be wrong about my guess, but it was only a guess, not the
        crux of my argument. The crux is that current timings suggest that HTM
        measurements of Fridrich and Waterman solutions are more comparable than
        their STM counterparts. For this, and the original reasons given, HTM
        seems to be a less controversial metric when considering the cube as
        fundamentally a physical puzzle. Two ways to go about getting STM
        accepted as a more accurate metric would be: 1. Convince people that the
        cube is not fundamentally a physical puzzle, and convince people to take
        an alternative view. -- or -- 2. Learn to perform the Waterman method in
        three quarters the speed of the fastest Fridrich practitioner, on
        average. Ryan

        is standing still. I understand what you mean, but it is controversial
        because here the &quot;rest&quot; is actually two segments, not one. In
        terms of force, the two &quot;rests&quot; need to be forced to stay
        still by two separate forces. Relatively speaking, we can view this also
        as the middle layer staying still, and the two &quot;rests&quot; being
        pushed away by two separate forces. I&#x27;m sure you can argue on this,
        but I&#x27;m merely trying to point out that it is controversial. Ryan

        Mike, a technical suggestion: let&#x27;s talk about &quot;inner
        slices&quot; if we mean inner slices, not just &quot;slices&quot;. Doing
        the latter will only feed the guys who want to make inner slices look
        like something special. I know it&#x27;s hard cause it&#x27;s sadly the
        way I was introduced to and got used to, buy I&#x27;m trying. And I
        think Gilles already does it, too. The real problem I think is that
        people aren&#x27;t willing to accept better methods. It&#x27;s like a
        newbie-cuber who learned a beginners-method and got a 1-minute-average
        and says it&#x27;s not fair others average under 20 seconds because they
        learned a better method. Waterman is better than Fridrich in STM? That
        alone proves that STM must be wrong. Really, that&#x27;s their point.

        Josef sufficient? I proposed, in a previous message, two ways to go
        about getting STM accepted as a more accurate metric (Richard, this may
        be what you missed?): 1. Convince people that the cube is not
        fundamentally a physical puzzle, and convince people to take an
        alternative view. -- or -- 2. Learn to perform the Waterman method in
        three quarters the speed of the fastest Fridrich practitioner, on
        average. Josef&#x27;s time does not convince me that STM is a good
        measure of physical movements. The evidence is still in favour of HTM.
        Unless you would like to argue that the cube is not fundamentally a

        record just for the people who care about slice moves? If so, there is
        very little difference in the ranking of those people between HTM and
        STM. In the common case, the HTM measurement of a solution is equal to
        the STM measurement plus the number of slice moves. In this case, the
        ranking stays the same. In some special cases, people who were tied will
        be split. Specifically, (L&#x27;R.R) and (L&#x27;R.D) are tied in STM,
        but the first is more efficient than the second in HTM. Maybe you can
        see the reason in that and live with it. If you can live with it, there
        is a significant advantage to choosing a HTM based ranking over a STM
        based ranking: the ranking would be comparable with the rest of the
        competitors who used strategies not based around slice moves. Ryan

        Hi Ron :-) U are missing lots of points here. Most of ur specific
        comments abouts methods that u discuss here are speedcubing methods, not
        fewest moves methods. Those who solely use speedcubing methods for
        fewest moves are not likely, in my opinion, to participate often or at
        all in offline fewest moves competitions. Those who are likely to
        participate use a whole lot of various methods i guess, at least the top
        fewest movers. When i say htm favor certain methods im not thinking
        about those methods u mention. Actually it kinda doesn&#x27;t make sense
        to say that the top fewest movers use any particular method. There are
        certain principles that are used that are very different from normal
        speedcubing. Most of these principles arise because the solution process
        is not linear but iterative, unlike speedcubing :-) Of course
        scientists, particularly mathematicians have made great contributions to
        cubing. But by and large theoretical contributions. All scientifically
        based solutions i have seen are either essentially quite bad beginners
        solution or hevaily group theoretical solutions like the 2-phase
        algorithm. Now of them suitable for speedcubing or for fewest moves :-)
        About regulations for submitting fewest moves solutions and verifying i
        am willing to write a proposal. I will try to make a draft this coming
        week :-) Kind regards, Per :-) > --- In fewestmoveschallenge@...m,

        using a metric that bears little relation to physical performance.
        Solutions that are &quot;better&quot; in the STM may be merely
        &quot;equal&quot; in the physical world. For example, Waterman is better
        than Fridrich in the STM, but roughly equal to Fridrich in the real
        world. Using the STM for FMC would encourage people to use slice moves
        for no reason. Can you give me any reason to use slice moves other than
        just that they score well in STM? If not, then I have no reason to use
        slice moves except for an artificial one. I do not buy that they are
        really any &quot;better&quot; ( - or any worse, for that matter. They
        are just a different kind of move that support a different kind of
        strategy). So why introduce a metric that would encourage people to use
        slice moves? Ryan

        really answered the question, and you have removed the context in which
        it was asked. Let me bring it back: Why should we adopt a metric that
        treats slice-based methods as better than non-slice-based methods when
        there is good real-world evidence to suggest that they are actually
        roughly the same? This would eventually encourage people to incorporate
        slice moves into their methods for artificial reasons only. On Mon, Jan

        HTM. I think I chose my words precisely enough. HTM is less
        controversial for this purpose than is STM. I am not proposing we invent
        a new metric that is perfectly accurate, I am proposing that we select
        one of the least controversial existing metrics. There is no strong
        evidence to suggest that the current HTM isn&#x27;t giving slice and
        non-slice -based methods a level playing field. I don&#x27;t see how
        anything can be changed if there isn&#x27;t any real issue to address.
        Nobody has yet developed corners first methods to the level that Mirek
        initially developed block methods for fewest moves. Changing the metric
        is not the way to get corners first methods, and other slice-based
        methods, to catch up. It is debatable that there is really any problem
        to fix, but it is certain that introducing STM would create a new
        problem. STM would give people an artificial incentive to modify their
        methods to incorporate slice moves. STM by definition will allow shorter
        solutions that are not possible to achieve by methods that do not employ
        slice moves. I don&#x27;t see a good reason why non-slice-based methods
        should lose their rating to slice-based methods through the use of a
        metric that rewards slice-based methods relative to non-slice-based
        methods, when evidence suggests that these methods are roughly
        equivalent. STM will allow you to get better scores by switching to a
        method that is equivalent. Do we really want everybody to switch to
        slice-based methods, when there is no real evidence to suggest that they
        are better? Don&#x27;t we prefer diversity? Let&#x27;s just keep the HTM
        which has historically done a good job in rating slice-based and
        non-slice-based methods as roughly equivalent. Ryan

        why they are being slighted. There is nothing wrong with methods that

        achieve a move count that is lower than what is possible by a
        non-slice-based method. It only makes sense to allow this if you can

        Do you think slice methods are inherently better than non-slice methods?
        Please answer that question. > I don&#x27;t think block methods are more

        then I will of course agree to use STM. Unfortunately, you haven&#x27;t
        supplied evidence. The best winning FMC solutions in STM happen to have
        been developed using block methods, not slice methods, where the bonus
        slice moves were just a happy coincidence. Fewest moves solving for
        block methods has been practiced by Mirek and Lars for decades, and
        their wisdom kindly donated to us for free. Fewest moves solving for
        slice methods is relatively new, and dare I say it, has more room for
        improvement. Rather than try to change the metric, why not just put
        development efforts into your method to equal the decades of effort that
        have been put behind fewest moves solving with block methods? > I

        How is that different than our complaint that HTM has taken over and >
        everyone only uses HTM based methods? The difference is that one side is
        backed by evidence. Let&#x27;s look at the two extremes: - Suppose
        competitors are so good that they regularly submit optimal solutions.
        Under STM, it is possible that an optimal solution cannot be achieved by
        methods that do not employ slice moves. - Suppose competitors are new to
        the game use stock standard methods with memorised algorithms. Under
        STM, known slice-based methods are scored as better than their non-slice
        counterparts. It is not difficult to interpolate the middle ground. If
        you think that slice methods are in fact better, then fine. Let&#x27;s
        use STM. But first you need to convince me that slice methods *are* in
        fact better. Then STM is justified. Ryan

        Hi all, interesting arguments... We should not argue by referring to
        existing methods (especially the speedcubing ones) and people
        performance... I would like to add one point I have not seen here...
        Counting inner slice turn as one turn seems to me equivalent to counting
        centers as movable cubies... If you do that then outer slice turn =
        moving 4 + 4 cubie block wrt 4 + 8 + 6 cubies inner slice turn = moving
        4 + 4 cubie block wrt 8 + 8 + 2 cubies It does not matter for computer
        programs, because they do not think and can easily convert slice turns
        to face turns + cube rotations and it simplifies the data structures
        while increasing speed... (that is why ACube cannot ignore centers (in
        the current version) - they are bound to cube rotation).. Btw, it should
        be quite easy to add slice turns to Cube Explorer this way...
        transformation tables would be extended to handle Xs style turns and
        pruning tables (the biggest memory eater) would stay the same... You can
        transform the output then to output real slice turns... (the same thing
        I did on ACube 2)... Josef

        why didn&#x27;t you spend some time trying to solve #103 scramble ? This
        metric problem has been discussed last year and 2006 rules have been
        established, why are you sticking to the old subject instead of
        continuing the good optimization work on both block AND slices methods
        we are all making together ? Don&#x27;t use arguments like &quot;you
        fear changing the metric&quot; or &quot;you want to change the metric to
        suite YOUR speedcubing method&quot;, and concentrate on solving instead
        of complaining :-) Rules are established, just accept them and live with
        them. Did any Guimond/CF solver ever asked to change the official
        speedcubing inspection time because he thought 15 seconds is
        better-suited for Fridrich solvers than for other methods ? I guess no
        ... But for example, guys like Gilles developed other approaches to make
        use of these 15 seconds. Or thought to the X-Cross. Or opposite X-
        Cross. Let&#x27;s prove that FMC solvers are as smart as speedsolvers
        (no comment ...) and that we are able to develop efficient methods
        whatever the rules. I&#x27;m still convinced that CF/Roux methods can do
        miracles in terms of moves cancellations if you experimented solvers
        take time to swap some steps or insert cycles or whatever you may
        invent... So hurry up and atomize my quite bad #104 solution ;-) cyril -

        it&#x27;s fundamental to focus of what a move is, cognitively and
        intuitively (because it&#x27;s a craft, because it&#x27;s a physical
        puzzle you have in front of you, not a virtual riddle), and
        scientifically. Focusing on finding a metric to make systems
        &quot;equal&quot; is a wrong debate. 1) When you &quot;see slices&quot;,
        rotating around the same axis, you can think with inner slice moves
        naturally, you can speedcube with them, etc. There&#x27;s no good reason
        to reject them, or consider they&#x27;re complex. 2) When you &quot;see
        cutplanes&quot;, they define 2 sliding blocks. If you focus too much on
        slices (as I was), looking at a square-1 could change your opinion.
        There&#x27;s no metric to rule them all, and in puzzleness bind them.

        that&#x27;s still 10 in HTM. And yes there&#x27;s also (U2 M U2 M&#x27;)
        but do you know how lucky you need to be to find them aligned like this
        for free without setup moves? I ended up finding one good spot,
        inserting a 10-move 3-cycle luckyily cancelling 4 moves. That was by far
        the best insertion I found, adding 6 moves to my solution length. But
        whether or not it&#x27;s fun, whether or not edges are discriminated,
        whether or not whatever, that&#x27;s all not the point. The point is
        that HTM is not measuring what I&#x27;m doing. Stefan

        You&#x27;re assuming that corners and edges are the same - they&#x27;re
        not. In a corners first, edges last system, it may take more moves to
        cycle edges, but it takes fewer moves to set up the corners because
        there are only 8 of them. In an edges first, corners last system, it may
        take fewer moves to cycle corners, but it takes more moves to set up the
        edges because there are 12 of them. Ryan

        Hi :-) The choice between htm and stm (or qtm for that matter) as the
        official fewest move metric has nothing to do with: 1 - popularity of
        methods for speedcubing 2 - which method is best for speeding or fewest
        moves 3 - wanting to discriminate particular methods The fact remains
        that in my opinion a layer turn is a layer, regardless whether this is
        an outer or inner layer. Let&#x27;s not turn this whole discussion into
        a political/strategical discussion about methods. Sadly it seems that
        some people here take this discussion very personally. Im only
        interested in : &quot;what is a move on the (3x3x3) cube&quot;? The
        natural way to define this is that turning an outer OR inner layer makes
        up a single move/turn on the cube. Corner cycles are made up (normally)
        of outer layer turns, while it&#x27;s natural for edge cycles to be made
        up using inner slice turns. In fact for larger cubes using inner slice
        turns is the ONLY way to make edge cycles. No other turns will break the
        &quot;edge-blocks&quot;. I know this is primarily a discussion about
        metric for 3x3x3 fewest moves. But i have to mention it :-) From that
        definition of what is a move i can only conclude that stm is the best,
        most neutral, metric to use. We also had a poll amongst those who
        regularly participate in the FMC challenge. The majority wanted to have
        stm as the official metric. I don&#x27;t see why people who not do
        fewest moves at all should have a saying in this. Im sorry if this
        remark offends people. But this is how it should be in any aspect of
        life. Speedcubers have no need for a move metric. As mentioned elsewhere
        their metric is TIME, not moves :-) Kind regards, -Per > --- In

        since I&#x27;m seldomly twisting with my hands, usually I do use my
        fingers. Also, as far as I know I only have *one* brain, and I think a
        brain is somewhat important for solving the cube, but that allows me to
        only twist the cube as *one* whole, right? But then it becomes boring
        since I can&#x27;t even scramble it and thus don&#x27;t need a brain
        anymore. It&#x27;s a paradox :-) Cheers! Stefan

        scientifically. Any argument that one metric is more valid than another
        is doomed to failure, unless we know what we are trying to measure. Are
        we trying to measure the length of thought, or the length of physical
        movement? I have suggested to ground this discussion in physical
        movement, and to pick a metric that most closely corresponds to time. I
        suggest we ground the discussion here, because physical movement is
        tangible, time is absolute, this is where cubing was first conceived, it
        is familiar, and we can compare the metric to time, something that is
        real. Trying to ground the discussion elsewhere leaves too many
        alternative and equally valid options open to debate, and none can ever
        be chosen over the other. > Focusing on finding a metric to make systems
        &quot;equal&quot; is a wrong debate. That debate never happened. It is,
        however, the case that various systems happen to be equal under both
        time and HTM. They were not &quot;made&quot; this way, they just happen
        to be this way. I suggest HTM as a good all round metric for anything
        ground in the physical side of the cube because of this nice (even if
        not perfect) correspondence between time and HTM. Ryan

        Hi :-) We are discussing a metric to be used for fewest moves for the
        3x3x3 cube. We can discuss metric for other kinds of puzzles when fewest
        moves for those become a reality. I can&#x27;t see that happening in the
        near future ;-) There&#x27;s already few people doing fewest moves on
        the 3x3x3 even heaps of ppl do normal speedcubing with it. Outer layer
        moves are contained within the stm&#x27;s &quot;arsenal of moves&quot;.
        I&#x27;d vote like this for puzzles u have mentioned: 3x3x3 : stm 4x4x4
        : chris hardwick&#x27;s &quot;stm&quot; metric - R is 1 move, Rr is 1
        move, rl&#x27; is one move, rl is 2 moves because it can&#x27;t be
        fingertricked like one natural move (5x5x5 : same as 4x4x4) Skewb : has
        only one kind of possible move, no problem :-) Square-1 : i&#x27;d vote
        for axial metric, adjusting U and D layers (in any way possible is 1
        move, flipping over is 1 move Pyraminx : see Skewb! ( i would NOT!
        consider adjusting the corner- tips as moves since those moves are
        trivial!) Megaminx : see Skewb! Let&#x27;s keep this discussion to the
        3x3x3 for now :-) Cheers! -Per > --- In

        Hi guys, You lost me! A good debate is about arguments and respect. Just
        let me know the outcome of this endless discussion. Have fun, Ron -----

        10:08 PM Subject: [fewestmoveschallenge] Re: STM sucks Hi :-) We are
        discussing a metric to be used for fewest moves for the 3x3x3 cube. We
        can discuss metric for other kinds of puzzles when fewest moves for
        those become a reality. I can&#x27;t see that happening in the near
        future ;-) There&#x27;s already few people doing fewest moves on the
        3x3x3 even heaps of ppl do normal speedcubing with it. Outer layer moves
        are contained within the stm&#x27;s &quot;arsenal of moves&quot;.
        I&#x27;d vote like this for puzzles u have mentioned: 3x3x3 : stm 4x4x4
        : chris hardwick&#x27;s &quot;stm&quot; metric - R is 1 move, Rr is 1
        move, rl&#x27; is one move, rl is 2 moves because it can&#x27;t be
        fingertricked like one natural move (5x5x5 : same as 4x4x4) Skewb : has
        only one kind of possible move, no problem :-) Square-1 : i&#x27;d vote
        for axial metric, adjusting U and D layers (in any way possible is 1
        move, flipping over is 1 move Pyraminx : see Skewb! ( i would NOT!
        consider adjusting the corner- tips as moves since those moves are
        trivial!) Megaminx : see Skewb! Let&#x27;s keep this discussion to the
        3x3x3 for now :-) Cheers! -Per > --- In

        your conclusion is easily debatable, as you are already seeing. I would
        urge this debate to be placed on physical grounds, since that is where
        the cube was conceived, and that is where relevant measurements can take
        place. If there is no relation to &quot;physical&quot; cubing, what is
        the relevance? Since the number of hands we have affects how easy it is
        to perform certain moves, we should consider the hands. If humans only
        had one hand, STM would definitely be out. If humans had three hands,
        STM would possibly be in (or some other generalisation of three-segment
        moves). When you go back to the roots of cubing, solving with your
        hands, it can be verified that HTM is a good measure for two hands. (As
        an aside, it is easy to answer your question about &quot;what is a valid
        definition of a move&quot;. We have done that and come up with several
        valid alternatives. So yes, while it is important to agree on what are
        the valid definitions, that is not the end of it all. Now we must select
        one, and we can&#x27;t do that simply on the validity of the
        definitions.) Ryan

        I&#x27;m saying we use HTM as primary, but recognize both as seperate
        records. Why is this a decent compromise: If you think HTM is superior
        to STM: both metrics recognized seperately as WRs so that is ok. If you
        think STM is superior to HTM: both metrics recognized seperately as WRs
        so that is ok. If you think HTM and STM are equal: both metrics are
        recognized seperately as WRs, and this is still ok. Instead of directing
        me to past emails give me reasons why recognizing an STM WR and an HTM
        WR is a bad idea. In fact, I challenge you to give me a good reason.

        If you agree that a metric is more relevant if it has some basis in the
        physical world of cubing, then HTM would be a better pick than STM
        because it reflects that L&#x27;R is twice as difficult as R in physical
        contexts. Ryan (*) The evidence measures the way people actually perform
        L&#x27;R. It could be to apply force to all three layers simultaneously,
        or to do it in two steps.

        Hi Ryan :-) Your physical world is restricted to &quot;wrist

        Hi :-) Ladies and gentlemen ;-) We are never going to come to an
        agreement by discussing this any further. Let us create a final poll on
        this matter. Anyone has objections to that? Whatever we decide in the
        poll (only about fewest moves metric for the 3x3x3 cube) will be the
        suggested official metric in my proposal for fewest moves regulations.
        Please when voting don&#x27;t be tactical. Vote for what u honestly

        I&#x27;m not really interested in solving that way. How about another
        division for linear solving? i.e. No going back in time to fix mistakes
        earlier in the solution? etc. Anyway, here are all of my entries into

        HTM is much closer. a bit offtopic, addressed to Ryan: how many Waterman
        practitioners you know of? Or you compare me to the most of other
        cubists (that practice much more) :-(? I doubt that you have much data
        to put this as a fact... If you know about other (active) Watermanians,
        please, tell me.. I would not feel so alone :-). And yes,
        Waterman&#x27;s method is quite efficient compared to Fridrich&#x27;s in
        STM, but do you have an idea how many sequences need to be learned to
        average in low 40s STM? And since it is not a method based on intuition,
        it is not any good for FMC (as well as Fridrich&#x27;s)... Keep cubing
        (and thinking)! :-) Josef

        It&#x27;s that the rules allow people to improve their solutions after
        their first attempt. The competition decides who is best at playing by
        those rules, not who can find the shortest solution after a single
        attempt. I would be entering a competition where the goal is to be best
        at something that I am not trying to be best at. What I&#x27;m saying is
        similar to a speedcubist being asked to enter a competition in which the
        rules state you are allowed to pause the stop watch to think, or to
        rewind the stop watch if you made a mistake. A speedcubist would not be
        interested in entering such a competition. This doesn&#x27;t mean that
        that person isn&#x27;t a speedcubist, and it doesn&#x27;t mean that
        I&#x27;m not a fewest moves cubist. Ryan

        tell me.. I would not feel so alone :-). The evidence I used was not
        comparing you with all of the Fridrich speedcubists. That doesn&#x27;t
        provide any useful information. Before Fridrich posted her method on the
        Internet so that many people could learn it, there was for the most part
        only one practitioner for each method - the inventor. Comparing the best
        slice practitioners with the best layer practitioners has not revealed
        at all the superiority of slice methods which STM indicates that it has.
        So don&#x27;t worry, I wasn&#x27;t trying to conclude anything from the
        fact that Fridrich practitioners are currently in the lead. However,
        present and past turns up no evidence that the short STM lengths of
        slice method solutions actually means anything useful in terms of the
        physical length of those solutions. HTM seems to do a better job when it
        comes to the physical length of a solution. In case people have
        forgotten again, this relates to FMC only if you think a measurement of
        a solution should be grounded in the physical context of the cube (i.e.
        solving it with hands) in order to be relevant. Ryan

        that WCA doesn&#x27;t endorse a particular metric. If possible, I think
        WCA should just codify an existing consensus among cubers rather than
        trying to decide/dictate/predict what the Best Way is. Because
        that&#x27;s both very hard, and also controversial. Here we have no
        consensus, which is why there is such a storm in this teacup. Ideally,
        each competition organizer could pick whatever metric they wanted, and
        over time a pattern would emerge. That pattern could be one universally
        respected metric, or several different &quot;schools&quot; of thought on
        the matter. Of course, there are almost no competitions arranged in this
        field, so that&#x27;s a bit problematic. I would take that as an
        indication that a rule framework governing these non existent
        competitions isn&#x27;t urgently needed, but I can see how you could
        make other arguments. As for recognizing records, I find it a bit odd
        with single solve FMC records, especially without regards to how much
        time was allowed. The discussion also made me think of some new possible
        metrics for competitions: -- Time FMC A: How fast can you turn in a
        solution shorter than X moves? -- Time FMC B: You&#x27;re given X hours
        to find the FASTEST solution to a certain position. The one who executes
        their solve fastest on a stack mat after that wins. -- Classic: Fewest
        physical moves, done live within X minutes. I think all could be a lot
        of fun at an actual competition. And I&#x27;m sure we can think of more.

        Hi guys! BTW, is anybody trying FMC #104? Anyway, Charles, now you know
        why I did not join the never ending debate ;-). I may come up with
        arguments for/against everybody. Just let me know when and where to vote
        and I&#x27;ll vote for QTM :-). I&#x27;ll surely try FMC A once its on.
        It&#x27;s a good idea how to be competitive without spending 2-10 hours
        with one FMC. If possible, such contest should be real-time so that we
        don&#x27;t have to rely on honesty of competitors. Something like
        starting Saturday 5pm and counting time to submision of one&#x27;s
        solution. Another scramble may be posted on Sunday. If this setting does
        not work we may leave the starting time on the competitor. Mirek --- In

        Hi Lars :-) Many new nice thoughts there :-) I particularly think that B
        would attract more people into fewest moves. It might also discourage
        some slow cubers, but so be it. One can never satisfy everyone at the
        same time ;-) Category B seems to be an almost perfect combination of
        fewest moves skills and fast execution skills. But i guess that in the
        long run it would be won largely by fast fridrich solvers (since they
        are in abundance of course). Given some time to optimise the fridrish
        steps and executing at say 5 moves/sec we should see many 7-8-9 secs
        solves ;-) I think this would be a great deal of fun. Also it will be
        easier i guess to perform a &quot;logical&quot; solution fast than an
        engineered move-optimised solution. Really, this will be tons of fun :D
        Category A i can&#x27;t really see how to easily decide the number of
        move that is to be achieved. Setting it too low and not many will be
        able to find a solution at all. Setting it high it will be found
        quickly. Still it&#x27;s worth trying :-) Leaving up to organisers what
        metric to be used for fewest moves i know what the result will be ;-) I
        can live with that :D Cheers! -Per > --- In

        have no idea about which metric to use ;) Maybe FMC&#x27;s could be
        judged on the average of all 4 FMC metrics, or even the sum total. It
        wouldn&#x27;t be too hard I&#x27;m sure for organisers to plug the
        solutions into Charles&#x27; FMC companion to find out the relevant move
        counts. I think it would be a good idea to try and standardise some FMC
        practices to be in line with competitions, and there is one easy thing
        we could implement. In most real FMC competitions you can have 60
        minutes or 90 minutes to find and write down your solution. So why
        don&#x27;t we do the same for online FMC? Most people I&#x27;m sure
        could find 90 minutes of their week where they could sit down and really
        have a go at the FMC. This would benefit those people who have busier
        lives and cannot spend as much time in a whole week on the FMC than
        others. And it would also give us lots of practice for making good
        solves in competition conditions. Let me know what you think. Anyhoo, I
        have launched FMC#105 today, and I think you will find that the idea is
        quite similar to some of the ideas that Lars posted earlier in the week!
        We shall definitely have to devote some other weeks to trying out those
        new variations :) But this week, the aim is to find a good FMC solution,
        and then time how long it takes you to memorise and execute it. The
        winner will be decided on the lowest total of moves + time in seconds.
        When memorising, be sure to take your time because you are only allowed
        one attempt to complete the cube and successfully complete the event.
        But don&#x27;t go too slowly, or you won&#x27;t win! And the lower you
        can get your move count, the easier it will be to memorise and execute
        quickly! The scramble is as always, posted on the FMC page. I hope you
        enjoy this variation, and Good Luck! Dan :)

        Memorization time could be *zero* cause I&#x27;ll be thinking about the
        solution so much while finding it. What do you think? Cheers! Stefan

        Hi! I want to say the same. There is no way to separate time for
        memorization from time needed for finding the solution if the solution
        is a simple step-by-step one, i.e. without insertions. OK, this gives us
        basically some restrictions on what kind of solution this should be so
        that there&#x27;s almost no time needed for memorization. Let&#x27;s try
        and see. I understand that we should start the stopwatch once we know
        that we found the solution that we&#x27;re going to perform. Good luck

        Hi :-) Then why don&#x27;t u simply submite ur &quot;one-go&quot;
        solutions? Does it matter too much for u to be competitive? U can submit
        ur solutions just for fun. I used to do fewest moves solve like i guess
        u like to do it back in the 80&#x27;s. I didn&#x27;t even write down the
        scramble. Just scrambled the cube randomly and allowed myself simple
        backtracking and solved the cube in usually 41-42 moves average. I did
        the same for fewest moves with the supercube (orienting centers too) and
        got my average down to about 52 moves or so. Sadly i haven&#x27;t kept
        all the old statistics ;-) The way i see it we should have about half
        the rounds with competition rules, 60-90 mins allocated maximum. And
        half the rounds dedicated to unlimited time solving, classic mode. And
        then have more experimental rounds once a while only. Just my thoughts

        Forget everything you&#x27;ve seen. If you solve a cube slowly,
        it&#x27;s often not too difficult to remember everything and solve it
        again, blindfolded, in less than a minute. Finding a short FM-style
        solution won&#x27;t help. Gilles.

        Forget everything you&#x27;ve seen. If you solve a cube slowly,
        it&#x27;s often not too difficult to remember everything and solve it
        again, blindfolded, in less than a minute. Finding a short FM-style
        solution won&#x27;t help. Gilles. Yahoo! Groups Links

        I think this kind of format could make its way to competitions. But 1
        minute would not be enough, maybe 2 or 3 minutes would be better,
        because clear and slow moves have to be made, one at a time, live
        counting in front of the judge. There shouldn&#x27;t be any ambiguity.

        and Maybe 2 minutes is better. That seems like a lot of time to think
        about a single attempt. Without the ability to take back moves and try
        many alternatives for hours on end, I don&#x27;t see the need for more
        time than this. Also, anything longer would make an average of 10 too
        tedious. Or would an average of 5 be ok? While I don&#x27;t think this
        would really be a &quot;speed&quot; competition, there is certainly a
        connection to speed competitions: they both have the same notion of
        &quot;solving&quot;. That is, you start from the beginning and your
        solution progresses linearly in time until you reach the final move.
        This means that if you improve your method for linear FMC, you may be
        able to transfer those method improvements over to speed competitions.
        The current FMC notion of solving is very different. You can construct
        your solution in a random order. e.g. you can start at the end, and
        finish at the beginning, or go from the beginning, to the end, to the
        middle (with backtracking and insertions). It&#x27;s far removed from
        physical solving (and you know I&#x27;m a big advocate of the
        &quot;physical&quot; view :-) Ryan

        I spent the past week building an automated competition system, which
        takes care of things like submissions and generation of ranking tables.
        I made a demo of Charles&#x27; &quot;Blitz&quot; competition here:
        http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/competitions/fmb/ Please continue
        to submit your solutions to Charles, but it would be helpful in testing
        this new system if you were to also submit an exact copy of your
        submission here. If it doesn&#x27;t crash after 1 week, then maybe it
        will be useful in future :-) There is also a copy of the above
        competition with admin options open to everyone (who registers) so that
        you can see how it works:
        http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/competitions/fmbopen/ You can also
        create your own experimental competition using the online user interface
        here: http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/competitions/ Please let me
        know if there are any bugs (or feature requests) before I let the main
        cube list know :-) ** About the system ** A competition holds
        &quot;tournaments&quot;. In the Blitz example above, the current
        tournament will run over 20 weeks, with one new challenge each week. As
        each challenge closes and the next one starts, the rankings table is
        updated to reflect the current points tally. The person with highest
        points tally at the end of the tournament is the tournament winner. The
        administrator for the competition may start a new tournament once the
        current one is finished, and a history of all previous tournament
        rankings is kept in the database (the actual challenge results are also
        in the database, but I haven&#x27;t built the user interface to show
        them yet). This means that if you are the champion of the Summer
        tournament of 2006, you will still be remembered as such in the future.
        Ryan P.S. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m releasing this prematurely (I
        haven&#x27;t done anywhere near enough testing), but it will still be
        helpful for other people to discover and report bugs.

        as well as the time. Submissions should be ranked by the time field, but
        the solution should be displayed in the results table (along with an
        automatically generated cube applet). The fmb (test) competition is

        Hi :-) Im not gonna compete in any threshold or speed/bld fewest moves
        events. I will only participate in the classic style (unlimited time)
        and the 1 hr standard competition style. The other formats do not honor
        iterative solving style that distinguishes fewest moves from normal
        solving. If other formats start to get into official competitions i will

        server&#x27;s been unreachable for a few days. I think I will finally
        have to consider moving my site to a more reliable server. FYI, the
        results of the latest fewestmoves5 challenge were: Place Name Moves
        Quote 1. Gilles Roux 41 2. Ryan Heise 45 Solved in 45 steps. 3. Johannes
        Laire 46 2x2x3 in 11 moves, but I had 6 edges to orient... This would
        produce a final ranking of: Rank Name Points 1. Johannes Lair 576 2.
        Lars Petrus 256 2. Ryan Heise 256 2. Gilles Roux 256 making Johannes
        Lair the Champion of this Tournament. Thanks to everyone who tested the
        system. If you have any suggestions as to how the system could be made
        more useful, that would be very helpful. The first priority will be to
        add missing features, and after that, to polish up the rough edges of
        the UI. Ryan

        &quot;fewest moves&quot; are goals. Then &quot;blindfolded&quot; and
        &quot;pre-inspection&quot; are just additional attributes which can be
        combined. So we could have: - iterative fewest moves - linear fewest
        moves - linear blindfolded fewest moves - iterative speed + fewest moves
        - linear speed + fewest moves - etc. What distinguishes fewest moves
        from anything else is &quot;fewest moves&quot;, not
        &quot;iterative&quot; :-) I think there are many people who stumbled
        upon linear fewest moves solving before iterative fewest moves solving
        (and maybe vice versa), but I accept that they both fall under the
        umbrella of fewest moves. I agree that different people are interested
        in different competitions. Maybe it would be good not to mix those
        &#x27;impure&#x27; competitions into the FMC, and keep FMC classic?
        Other competitions could be set up for linear FMC (e.g. fewestmoves5)
        and linear blindfolded fewest moves. Ryan

        Yes, it looks like it was displaying the results of the previous
        challenge using the current scramble instead of the previous one. It is
        now fixed: http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/competitions/fmb/ I
        think I&#x27;ll also add some code to print out the previous scramble
        along with the results. Ryan

        Charles, I put you on the administrator list for fmb so that you can
        experiment with the options. The look and feel is controlled by a CSS
        stylesheet which you can replace through the admin UI. The instructions
        are specified in HTML, where %challenge% is a special word that will be
        replaced by the current scramble when it is served. e.g.
        &quot;&lt;p>Please scramble your cube using %challenge%&lt;/p>&quot; I
        will improve access to the past competition results tomorrow, and
        provide appropriate hooks for the stylesheet. Ryan

        45 Went too fast and lost a move. Video at

        here I noticed that only two edges are flipped. This is easy to fix with

        Very lucky. I practiced just before this with random scramblings and
        made sure that I manage to write moves down during solving. The best I
        did during warm-up was 40. 2 Ryan Heise (ryan) 44 44 Steps 3 Gilles Roux
        (Gilles) 47 http://grrroux.free.fr/fmry4.avi - 39 STM and 2 moves are
        useless. 4 Pedro Santos (pedro) 62 Pff...my fridrich sucks...
        http://www.ryanheise.com/competitions/fewestmoves5/ And the final

        Bennett (mizzle) 64 6 Lars Petrus (TheChamp) 64 That makes Gilles Roux
        champion of the 2nd tournament. I quite like this format, and I think if
        we practiced for it, we could be averaging sub-40. Although next time I
        might make it a weekly event. Ryan

        don&#x27;t forget, I just created such a system:
        http://www.ryanheise.com/competitions/ Current features: - automatically
        releases new challenges periodically - automatically closes off
        challenges after the deadline - automatically compiles the
        results/rankings tables each period - keeps archives of past
        results/rankings - handles login/authentication - provides administrator
        UI to the owner of each competition - it is generic, it allows you to
        create new custom competitions through the user interface, following
        user-defined rules. For example, the rules for selecting the winner are
        completely user-definable through the admin user interface. I would like
        to also allow different point systems to be chosen. Currently, every
        competition uses the following point system: 1st place: 100 points 2nd
        place: 90 points 3rd place: 81 points etc. I think most competitions
        would be happy with that. (fewestmoves5 used a different point system,
        but I have since changed it) The advantage of a points system for fewest
        moves challenges as with other sports, is that some days will be easier
        than others. E.g. in running, some days the wind can assist you, others
        it can hold you back. Some days, you will get an easy cube scramble,
        others it will be difficult (for humans). A points system assumes that
        everyone gets the same advantage (i.e. same conditions), and only
        considers who was better than whom, given a shared set of conditions.
        Ryan

        Hi :-) Yes i know that. But mine will be for purely classical fewest
        moves and i will use ranking similarly to what Dan has done in the past.
        My system would only require some authentication when submitting a
        solution and have automatic solution verification, incorporate Charles
        FMC companion and more ... But if there&#x27;s little interest for it i

        Hi Per, My system can support automatic solution verification,
        integration of Charles&#x27; FMC companion, etc.. without any change to
        the core system code. And maybe having one server, one login account,
        for several competitions would be nice for users, and, may open
        possibilities to generate interesting statistics for individual users

        Hi everyone, I&#x27;m currently trying to redesign my pages, but
        it&#x27;s going pretty slowly. Firstly I don&#x27;t have a lot of spare
        time, and while I am redesigning I am also learning php and css along
        the way to make a better website, as well as better html practices.
        I&#x27;m working on the FMC page, but it isn&#x27;t finished by tonight
        as I hoped it would be. As soona s it is finished, a new challenge will
        be launched, and we will be able to get the FMC back on the road :) Dan

        currently working on redesigning my web pages, so currently the FMC page
        is just the bare bones, there is a challenge, and a link to a submission
        form which works correctly, when all the data is added into it :) You
        can access the new competition by clicking on the Fewest Moves Challenge

        accessing it directly via

        Hi Dan, hi all ! FMC comes to life again, cooool :D ! I skipped #106,

        Woow! 34 stm in 30 secs is amazing! If u are just open to many different
        approaches and have a feel for what is leading anywhere i don&#x27;t see
        why u shouldn&#x27;t improve on that solution easily :-) The method
        which really takes me ages is edges first approach that i use if my
        other approaches fail to give me something below 30 moves (htm). Or i
        might try it anyhow if i find lots of time to spare on it :-) Cheers!

        Hi everyone, The results of FMC#107 are out, and it was a very high
        standard of entries that I received over the week! 14 participants this
        week, so thank you all for taking part! Next challenge #108 will be
        launched at midnight tonight. You can check out the results here:

        Hey - just did my first FMC (#108) - have spent some time trying to
        improve. I wanted to let you guys know (if you didn&#x27;t already) that
        the FMC cube companion does not appear to work in Firefox. I
        couldn&#x27;t figure it out last night why it wasn&#x27;t doing anything
        when I hit setup cube. Then I got the bright idea this morning to try
        using IE and it worked fine. Probably something with the differences in
        Javascript / DOM between the 2 browsers. In any case, thanks for setting
        up FMC. I&#x27;m currently at 44 htm 53 qtm 41 stm 50 sqtm, which
        isn&#x27;t very good when compared to most of you guys, but still not
        bad for me :-) I&#x27;m still trying to figure out what most of you are
        talking about, with insertions and such. I have a decent grasp of
        commutators and conjugates, but you guys are amazing... (the other) dan.

        Dan, I also found out that it does not work with firefox. One of the few
        times that I have to use IE. Have you tried the IE tab for firefox?
        Also, did anyone notice that Cyril and I found the exact same solution
        for 107, except we put the insertion to fix the corners at differenct
        places?

        So here&#x27;s a question that I couldn&#x27;t find answered anywhere.
        What&#x27;s the policy on using aids / tables / charts? For example, at
        one point I had gotten it down to the PLL stage, and it came up to one
        of the PLLs I don&#x27;t know off the top of my head. Am I allowed to
        look up what the appropriate PLL is? In a similar vein, at one point I
        was I believe 19 moves in, and had 3 c/e pairs on the f2l and the top
        edges oriented. I plugged it in to Cube Explorer and it gave me an 11
        move solution from that point. Am I allowed to submit the total 30 move
        solution? thanks, (the other) dan.

        Hi :-) U are of course allowed to spend time constructing that PLL step

        HI The policy is that you are not allowed to look up algorithms
        specifically for the purpose of FMC. If you can, imagine that you are in
        a real WCA competition scenario. All that you are allowed to have is pen
        and paper. The add in the Fewest Moves Companion, you can use that to
        help you since it doesn&#x27;t calculate anything except for telling you
        how many moves you have used. You are NOT allowed to look up a PLL if
        you don&#x27;t know it, and you are not allowed to use Cube Explorer or
        any type of computer program to calculate a solution from a particular
        position. Algorithms that you have learned previously for other purposes
        and that you know off by heart can be used. I am almost done with the
        new automated FMC system, I just have to do some testing and hopefully I
        will be able to launch the new pages just after the launch of the new

        A limited time as the WCA format would be a good thing. 1 hour is long
        enough to try a few solutions with a good start. Spending more time
        makes you find better solutions - because you can explore more and find
        lucky tricks, - and because you can think more and use your science of
        cubing. But my opinion is that a high level in cube science should make
        you find any useful information in less then 1 hour. Exceeding this time

        Hi everyone, Starting from next week the FMC at Dan&#x27;s CubeStation
        will undergo some big changes. The system will be much more automatic
        compared to the current system, and has one or two nifty featues. You
        now need an FMC Account to submit solutions to the FMC. If you have
        participated in the FMC before, then if I have an email address for you,
        I will send you your username and password. Sometime after 12pm on
        Sunday, I shall launch the new FMC pages, and once they are online, you
        will be able to update your user details by logging onto your account
        via the FMC control panel. I recommend that you check your details
        carefully and make any corrections if I entered anything in wrong. If
        you have participated in the FMC before, and haven&#x27;t received
        details of your account, then please send me an email at fmc@... If
        you&#x27;ve never participated in the FMC before, then you can easily
        create an account to allow you to submit your entries, The new system
        will automatically check and validate your solution, and either prevent
        you from submitting if your solution is invalid, or count up all the
        necessary move counts so all you need to enter is your user/pass and a
        quote if you want to. I have to approve solutions before they will be
        displayed on the results page after the challenge deadline expires. Only
        your most recent solution up until the deadline will count. I am not
        expecting the transition to be smooth, I am sure there will be some
        glitches along the way, but please bear with me and I am sure that we
        will be able to sort them out as they appear. If you find any bugs,
        please report them to me on fmc@... If anything major happens, then I
        will revert back to the old system, and try to fix it offline :) I
        really hope that you will enjoy the new system, thank you for making the
        FMC a great competition to run. Many many thanks to Charlie Tsai and
        Craig Vincent, without who the new system would not be possible, I am
        forever indebted to you guys. DanH :) - www.cubestation.co.uk

        HI Ryan, I am afraid that while FMC was on a break on my site, I
        didn&#x27;t really keep in touch with any FMC goings on, which includes
        your automated system, so I wasn&#x27;t really in the picture about it,
        very remiss of me. I can assure you that I have not stolen any of your
        coding or work, and the idea was independently created a long time
        before you designed your original automated system. The only thing
        holding me back was the fact that I had no knowledge of web databases. I
        will of course acknowledge you on the new FMC page, for the work which
        you carried out prior to my new system. I&#x27;m pretty inexperienced at
        making stuff like this, so perhaps when it is launched, you could take a
        look at it and see if you could find anything that you would improve, I
        would be very grateful for your input and any help you may be able to
        offer. Once again, I apologise for overlooking your work, and I hope
        that we are cool about it :) Dan :) -----Original Message----- From:

        Insertion is a very simple idea to understand, not quite as simple to
        put into practice, but if you work at it it will suddenly click :) I
        will give an example of the simplest possible insertion, probably stolen
        from one of Per&#x27;s solutions... ( I haven&#x27;t searched yet ;) )
        The scramble: U&#x27; D (L B2 D&#x27; L2 F)*4 B&#x27; U&#x27; R2 B
        F&#x27; (R&#x27; U B2 U2 L)*4 B R After searching, Per somehow magically
        came up with the very short base solution L F&#x27; D L2 U&#x27; F
        D&#x27; B&#x27; R2 B2 U.F2 U&#x27; L&#x27; The above sequence solves
        everything but for 3 corners. You could of course then use a commutator
        at the end of the move sequence to solve those 3 corners, but it is
        usually more beneficial to backtrack through the solution, while
        following those 3 corners. The reason for doing this, is that at any
        point during the solve where you could solve the corner 3-cycle using a
        commutator, there is a possibility that moves in your
        &quot;insertion&quot; would cancel out with moves in your original
        solve, thus being more efficient. The idea is simple, but I found it
        very hard to put into practice, so maybe more specialist people could
        also give their input :) Per inserted U&#x27; B D2 B&#x27; U B D2
        B&#x27; at the dot, so you can see that U U&#x27; cancelled, and then B2
        B combined into B&#x27;, to cancel 3 moves, giving a 19 move solution.
        (14 move start + 8 move commutator - 3 cancelled moves) Using insertions
        is a clever way of reducing the number of moves you need to solve a
        3-cycle of corners. I believe it can be used for edge cycles too, but I
        have never used it. I think that to master it requires a lot of
        experience, so don&#x27;t be frustrated if you can&#x27;t see it right
        away! Dan :) --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi Tim, Yes I was aware of this issue, but only very recently since i
        installed firefox one week ago. Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t rectify
        the situation because I don&#x27;t understand the code for the FM
        companion :( However, this issue has been resolved in the new system,
        the checker used in submitting a solution works in both firefox and ie.

        Hi :-) I would say that inserting ONE corner 3-cycle into a skeleton
        solution is quite straight forward. Once the concept of ceorrectly
        labelling the 3 required corners correctly with sticker (such that
        cycling them according to the stickers will rotate them correctly as
        well). Quite another matter is to insert say a corner 5-cycle. First of
        all more stickers are required. There is more possible cycles to look
        out for. And inserting the &quot;best first&quot; 3-cycle is not
        guarantee for overall best insertion. The 5-cycle is broken down into 2
        3-cycles that are inserted individually :-) As for inserting edge-cycle
        it&#x27;s not any harder in principle, but the abundance of edge 3-cycle
        algs is quite overwhelming. It&#x27;s easier to keep track of corner
        3-cycle algs. And besides, i find it generally easier to solve edges
        first and then corners later. Rather than the opposite approach. That
        said i have indeed had solutions that end with edge-insertions :-)
        Cheers! -Per PS! Don&#x27;t be put off by 14 moves with 3 corners left.
        That was a really rare case, where i got 2 solved corners for free while
        arranging the edges :-) > --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi Dan, I understand that you were not around at the time of my original
        announcement. I built the automated competition server originally to
        address the problems you were having at the time regarding the running
        of the FMC. There&#x27;s no need to give any kind of acknowledgement on
        your web page, your email is enough. -- Ryan Heise

        Cheating by luck. Having second attempts is also cheating by luck ;-) If
        &quot;luck&quot; means receiving good fortune by chance, then one way to
        reduce luck is to reduce the number of chances down to just 1. It is
        still possible to be lucky, given just one chance, so the next step is
        to take an average over a series of separate challenges. I have an idea
        for another format which can be run in parallel to the FMC, if there is
        any interest: - 5 scrambles, 5 minutes per scramble, 1 attempt per
        scramble. - Average the 5 solution lengths (or the best 3 out of 5?) As
        for FMC, yes I think a 1 hour limit is better than a 168 hour limit, but
        there is no reason why both formats could not run in parallel on the
        same scramble. -- Ryan Heise http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/

        wait participating in the 1 hr version until i have something really
        good. I think they should at least be different scrambles IMHO :-) And
        one more idea. For a 1 hr time-limited challenge u can with ur system
        log what time a participant is opening the challenge. Then use that info
        to actually limit when he/she can submit also. So that it&#x27;s
        impossible to spend excessive time on it. I like that idea! Sounds

        :-) That&#x27;s what they do for online sudoku competitions. But you
        need to detect logins from the same IP address too, because it&#x27;s
        easy to create a dummy user, and send it as a scout :-) It&#x27;s
        getting difficult when the competitor has access to more than 1 client
        IP address, and that&#x27;s pretty common. And there are dynamic IP
        address. Or a common proxy for different users. --> You must be sure you
        can trust 100% of your registered users. Gilles.

        :-) To prevent cheating, every person would have to start the challenge
        at the same time, otherwise two people (or possibly one person with two
        email addresses) could collude by one person letting the other one know
        what the scramble is before they open the challenge. Another way to
        prevent this could be to provide each person a different scramble, but I
        don&#x27;t think this is fair for FMC, since some scrambles seem easier
        than others. On the other hand, that problem can be solved by taking
        averages.. -- Ryan Heise http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/

        Hi everyone, Of course, the FMC is as much yours as it is mine, so you
        only have to give the word and I can introduce new formats (providing
        they are within my capabilities). If you would like a 60 minute or 90
        minute (i personally am in favour of the 90 min, but perhaps because I
        am not as skilled as you guys) type challenge, then I can easily
        incorporate it. I totally agree with Charlie though, the classical style
        is great for exploring new ideas and building up your knowledge of FMC
        techniques, and I would hope that beginners would be encouraged to spend
        a longer time to really try to get to grips with some of the more
        advanced stuff. Also, the fact that the classical FMC has run for around
        100 challenges says something for its longevity. Thanks to everyone who
        has been kind enough to comment on the new system, thus far I
        haven&#x27;t had too many problems to deal with. However, has anyone
        using a Mac had trouble with the FMC pages? I recently tried to do some
        admin stuff on my pages using a Mac and have encountered some weird
        problems... Dan :) (still struggling with this weeks challenge) > >

        Hi Fewest Moves Cubists, I see the contest going on again for a while.
        And I liked the number 111, so I gave a try. Although I had my solution
        on Saturday I somehow failed to post it. Especially Lars may like it.
        Here it is: First, I got a short F2L after 15 moves as R&#x27; B F2 L
        B&#x27; D&#x27; R B L U B&#x27; U B U2 B2 (the same as Lars) and a
        pseudo F2L in 14 moves R&#x27; B F2 L B&#x27; D&#x27; R B L B&#x27;
        U&#x27; B&#x27; R [U], where the move in the bracket can be prepended to
        the scrambling moves. Then I modified it in the search of a better last
        layer, R&#x27; B F2 L B&#x27; D&#x27; R B&#x27; R&#x27; B2 L B&#x27; U
        F&#x27; U2 F R. U R&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; R2, insert the final corner
        3-cycle at the dot as R&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U R U&#x27; L U; The
        result is R&#x27; B F2 L B&#x27; D&#x27; R B&#x27; R&#x27; B2 L B&#x27;
        U F&#x27; U2 F U&#x27; L&#x27; U R U&#x27; L U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27;

        think), which would probably put the total at 28. Not that I intend to
        memorize all that. Final layer positions like that are pretty thankless
        with all 8 pieces &quot;on the loose&quot;. You have to find some way to
        fix the edges AND one corner somewhere to get down to a 3 corner
        commutator. There isn&#x27;t much &quot;wiggle room&quot; in this start
        either. Normally, you can insert a few random moves here and there that
        doesn&#x27;t affect the block you&#x27;re building, but here a lot of
        the moves are forced. > and a pseudo F2L in 14 moves > R&#x27; B F2 L

        sure where the confusion arose. It arose from a text on the page, where
        the countdown timer usually is, saying to reload to see this weeks
        challenge. It was there for several hours, but when reloading, no new
        challenge appeared. Maybe the timer controlling that message, and the

        orienting edges at that point surely plays a part. BTW, the

        Hi Charles ! (and all) I had overlooked Charles&#x27; easy start.
        Studying his start i came up with the following: F R2 D&#x27; R&#x27; B
        D2 B for a pseudoblock > add D2 premove to scramble. Now continue F R
        F&#x27; F2 > add another premove R&#x27; to scramble. Now finish edges
        with F&#x27; D&#x27; F D, leaving 5 corners. Now D&#x27; L D R&#x27;
        D&#x27; L&#x27; D R solves 3 corners and cancels 2 moves. Adjust for the
        premoves by adding R&#x27; D2 and 3 more moves cancel nicely! Then we
        have : F R2 D&#x27; R&#x27; B D2 B F R F&#x27; R2 F&#x27; D&#x27;.F L D
        R&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27; with 3 corners to go. Now either add (D2
        L&#x27; U2 L)*2 at the end to cancel 1 move for a direct 27-move
        solution. Or, insert D L&#x27; U L D&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L at the dot
        for a 26-move solution. The latter also gives excellent sub-30 qtm. The
        good start did it all :-) Cheers! -Per

        Hi Guys :-) Seems like Dan is not around to approvemy solution today.
        Yes, the system is not 100% automated as of yet.Dan still needs to
        approve solutions. So here it is: __________ Solution: D&#x27; F R U2 L

        back again now. The cube did not look all that scrambled, but good
        blocks were not all that easy to find. My solution is like this: D&#x27;
        F R U2 L U&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27; F U2 does a 2x2x3 block. Then
        R&#x27;aligns some blocks and i force the cube together with F B&#x27; R
        F U F U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; B U&#x27; R&#x27; U. Other interesting
        finds were : U R2 B&#x27; U&#x27; D2 F&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; F2 D B2
        D&#x27; U B2 D [U&#x27;.U] B R B&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27;.B&#x27; leaving 2
        flipped edges in 21 moves and this variation : U R2 B&#x27; U&#x27; D2

        Hi, everybody, did you notice that the cube scramble was unusually of
        &quot;low complexity&quot;? It&#x27;s true at least for the Cube

        L&#x27; U F R&#x27; F2 D B&#x27; L B U L R&#x27; U . Does any of you
        have a table showing how many different positions can be reached in 14
        or less moves? What is the probability that a random scrambled position
        can be solved in less than 15 moves? It must be very low. Mirek

        I don&#x27;t have a table, but if you assume that 18 is the norm, and
        there are 15 moves in each position, and negligible duplication,
        you&#x27;d end up with one chance in 15^4 = 50625 to get a 14 mover.
        Pretty shaky assumptions, I know. If anyone has any better, do let us
        know. In 116 competitions, that would mean we&#x27;d have about 0.2% for
        this to occur randomly. /Lars On Aug 2, 2006, at 19:17, mirek_goljan

        I have added a lot of results to the FMC archive now, and done some more

        which count towards your rating in the results box. I am going to soon
        work on producing a World Rankings list based on these ratings, but I
        would like some opinions on a way to do it. I am going to draw up a list
        based on &quot;active&quot; players, but how long do you think a player
        should remain active for? If they haven&#x27;t posted a solution within

        Hi, I did not have enough time to participate, but I found an
        interesting start for #119 FMC and thought that I could share it with
        you here. Suggestions are welcome, especially for smarter &quot;R
        move&quot; insertion and/or corners cycle :-) Have fun, Cyril Scramble :
        (F B&#x27; R2 D)*3 L2 U D&#x27; B2 (F&#x27; R U2)*4 L D&#x27; U B (U2 L
        F&#x27; R2)*3 Solution (2 flipped edges, 26 HTM-24 STM) : U B2 D
        {L&#x27; R} {F B&#x27;} R&#x27; B2 L2 U&#x27; F&#x27; U2 B&#x27; F&#x27;
        R F&#x27; U B2 U&#x27; F U B2 U&#x27; F R2 Quote : Partial solution
        only. Had not much time but I found this very interesting start for F2L
        minus one pair in 13 HTM: UB2DL&#x27;.F.
        B&#x27;R&#x27;B2L2U&#x27;F&#x27;U2B&#x27; The miracle is that it is
        possible to insert any R- slice move at the first OR the second dot. R
        at the first dot does it, since F2L are solved with an additional
        F&#x27;R|F. Insert (F&#x27;UB2U&#x27;FUB2U&#x27;) at the colon for the
        corners (I was lazy) and you get UB2DL&#x27;(R)

        (F&#x27;UB2U&#x27;FUB2U&#x27;) FR2: 26 HTM ... but 2 flipped edges. My
        solution would be too long if flip them, so I leave it as a partial
        solution :)

        Hi Dan, I like your start for FMC #120. To remind you the scramble, it
        was U&#x27; B2 L B&#x27; R2 U2 B&#x27; D&#x27; U2 F L&#x27; R D2 F U B2
        L F2 R2 B F U&#x27; D F L You did 2x2x3 block as D&#x27; F D2 R&#x27; U
        R2 B&#x27; L2 B2. I spent about 15 minutes to find the following. Begin
        with your 6 moves D&#x27; F D2 R&#x27; U R2, here I opt for making
        another corner-edge pair as F L&#x27; F&#x27;. Then finish 2x2x3 B&#x27;
        L2 B2, fix another pair L&#x27; D2 L and now a little trick F&#x27;
        B&#x27; D F D&#x27; B D and only 3 corners left after 22 moves (HTM).
        Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see an insertion of a corner 3 cycle better
        than D2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L D2 L&#x27; U L after the L2 move. Alltogether,
        it&#x27;s D&#x27; F D2 R&#x27; U R2 F L&#x27; F&#x27; B&#x27; L2 (D2
        L&#x27; U&#x27; L D2 L&#x27; U L) B2 L&#x27; D2 L F&#x27; B&#x27; D F

        Hi James, There are not many websites about GMC techniques, some posts
        here may give you a good basis :
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/fewestmoveschallenge/message/852
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/fewestmoveschallenge/message/854 and
        so on ... The idea with insertions is that is it often shorter to solve
        &quot;nearly&quot; every cubie than the whole cube. Then you insert a
        corner or an edge cycle in the &quot;near-solution&quot; to fix the
        remaining pieces. The good thing with insertions is that you can usually
        cancel some moves if you find a good place. You can use PLL&#x27;s for
        cycling edges or corners, but there are some algs (commutators) that are
        usually shorter and that are often easier to insert. The stickers are
        useful to follow the pieces that you want to cycle throughout your
        &quot;near- solution&quot;, and see when they have the right
        configuration. It takes time, but it is really cool when you can for
        example replace a 20+ moves OLL + PLL by 1 corner cycle and 1 edges
        cycle, saving some moves, and ending with a 10-12 moves LL :) Last thing
        ... none of us uses Acube or algs table ;-) Just take some time to read
        the posts I mentioned above, google commutators+rubik and be prepared to
        spend some hours on the scrambles ! Good luck, Cyril --- In

        I read through all of the posts that were part of the ones you gave. I
        also went to Ryan Heise&#x27;s site and read his commutators section. I
        could solve them on my own except for the last one, it&#x27;s a little
        different from the others he described. 1. What&#x27;s a premove?
        I&#x27;ve read stuff about doing moves to the cube before you scramble,
        that seems like cheating. 2. Setup moves? 3. I still don&#x27;t
        understand the point of stickers, do people really have a hard time
        remembering what they are doing? 4. 5-cycles? 3-cycles? 5. I did some
        google searches but every site I saw (except Ryan&#x27;s page) described
        stuff very mathematically. 6. Last thing, can I have an explanation of
        the reason for putting &quot;.&quot; or &quot;:&quot; in your comments
        for FMC and saying you inserted something there? I need a better
        explanation of this and insertions. Sorry, I just want to know all of
        these terms so I can do better and so I don&#x27;t sound stupid when
        explaining things. I don&#x27;t know how everyone else knows this. I did

        they do. But that&#x27;s not what the stickers are for. The stickers are
        for insertions. When you understand insertions, you will understand the
        need for stickers. Before you understand insertions, don&#x27;t worry
        about the stickers. > 4. 5-cycles? 3-cycles? N-cycle: Algorithm that

        Hi James, Just some more comments on your questions. Lars gave really
        helpful answers ... > 1. What&#x27;s a premove? I&#x27;ve read stuff
        about doing moves to the cube > before you scramble, that seems like
        cheating. > 2. Setup moves? Actually it&#x27;s the same thing. Suppose
        you have a block approach like Petrus&#x27;, you find a lovely 2x2x2
        block but no good possibility to extend it to a 2x2x3. Instead, you may
        find easier to finish a 2x2x1 block that does NOT belong to the 2x2x3,
        and place it next to your 2x2x2. You now have a pseudo-block (pseudo
        2x2x3 in this case). There are now two possibities: A) You are really
        smart and you are not disturbed by the fact the color do not match and
        you continue to solve the cube B) You are like us and you prefer when
        colors match. So you simply add the move that would place the
        non-matching pieces of your pseudo block BEFORE scrambling, and the
        miracle will happen: the colors will now match. In your final
        submission, you will however still have to add the inverse of the setup
        move (= premove) after your solution in order to solve the real
        scramble. For example, see Dan&#x27;s #120 solution : D&#x27; F D2
        R&#x27; U R2 B&#x27; L2 B2 D&#x27; F D2 R&#x27; U R2 solve pseudo-F2L,
        but if you add D2 before scrambling you&#x27;ll see &quot;true
        F2L&quot;, which is much easier for figuring out the LL :) Actually it
        is NOT cheating, since you still end up with a moves sequence that
        solves the given scamble ! Hope this helps ... > 6. Last thing, can I
        have an explanation of the reason for > putting &quot;.&quot; or
        &quot;:&quot; in your comments for FMC and saying you inserted >
        something there? I need a better explanation of this and insertions.
        Well, it&#x27;s just a simple way to indicate where you inserted the
        cycle. Actually easier than saying &quot;I inserted the corner cycle
        after the 4th D2&quot; or &quot;... after the 23rd move&quot; ;) >
        Sorry, I just want to know all of these terms so I can do better and >
        so I don&#x27;t sound stupid when explaining things. I don&#x27;t know
        how > everyone else knows this. I did search the forums but since I
        don&#x27;t > know much I can&#x27;t find the right posts. You&#x27;re
        not stupid at all, or I am too ! I had the same questions when I started
        doing FMC. I thought that the others were adding random premoves to make
        the scramble easier ! Good luck ;) cyril

        Hi :-) Finally an interesting thread on this forum. One about ... umm
        ... fewest moves ... lol ;-) Premoves are related to pseudoblocks. Let
        me explain what it&#x27;s all about. Take a solved cube and do R then
        (DB) couple of times to mess up the cube a bit. U know have a
        pseudoblock (2x2x3) at the UF position. Say u had arrived at that
        configuration after n moves in ur solution. And now u wish that the
        2x2x3 block was PURE (so that u can see more clearly what to do with the
        rest of the cubies). In this case write down ur n moves (or use the
        Fewest Move Companion). Now set up the scramble again but do an
        additional R&#x27; at the start first. Now ur n turns will set up a PURE
        2x2x3 block. It&#x27;s not too hard to understand how this works when
        thinking about it :-) Now this example only used ONE premove. I have
        seen 2 premoves used in solutions, but only 1 is usually sufficient. Or
        possibly u arrive at a situation where u want to do 1 premove and then a
        bit later again u add one more. It all depends. Just remember that the
        solution u end with is solution to an incorrect scramble (it has
        premoves). So adjust for this by adding some turns in the end. U easily
        see what those additional moves are anyway ;-) I am not sure if this has
        been mentioned already. But one extra trick of the trade (that i have
        never used successfully) is to instead do the reverse of the scramble
        and solve that configuration (with all normal tricks used). Then when u
        have ur solution just reverse it. This reversed solution is the solution
        to the ORIGINAL scramble. Also quite easy to understand why it must be
        so ;-) Finally about cycles there is more to it than just tracking
        positions. A 3-cycle can be PURE or twisted. Ok, let me explain this. Do
        following 3-cycle on a solved cube : R&#x27; D&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; D
        R U. This is a PURE 3-cycle. The 3 corners can be correctly solved by a
        corner 3-cycle. In this case that cycle is just the reverse of the given
        moves. Now say u did some alg that flipped 2 corners. One of them being
        a corner involved in the cycle and one which is NOT. Now there is NO WAY
        to correctly solve those 3 corners with just a 3- cycle. No matter what
        u do 1 or more of them will be incorrectly oriented!! U might wonder if
        doing a corner 2-twist then a 3-cycle is the best way to solve this? I
        would generally say NO! There is a better way. Can u see how? The
        generally best way is to correctly solve 1 of those 3 corners that u
        cycled first. Do this by a 3-cycle (yes!!) but one that involves just 2
        of the corners u cycled first but also involved the lonely twisted
        corner :D If done correctly u now have one more PURE corner 3-cycle to
        do. This should i guess always be the best approach. As a note i can
        mention that u could also do a corner 2-twist as 2 3-cycles. I leave it
        up to u to see how ;-) The point about insertion and stickers is that
        it&#x27;s quite easy to &quot;track&quot; ur 3 corner a few moves
        backwards from the end of ur &quot;skeleton&quot; solution. But
        it&#x27;s damn hard to track them many moves back. And even if u track
        positions correctly, tracking orientations is much harder. That&#x27;s
        why it&#x27;s good to put stickers on the cubies of interest, the cubies
        u are gonna find insertion alg for. Now insertion would NOT be of much
        use if one didn&#x27;t try to insert at a point where u will get move
        cancellations. A corner 3-cycle done at the end would maybe take 8
        turns, or possibly more ... Unless rare case an inserted corner 3-cycle
        takes 7 additional moves or less. I have managed once to insert corner
        5-cycle in only 7 additional moves. A rare case yes, but worth looking
        for, with stickers!! Best of luck, -Per (PS! The more options u are
        exploring the better the chance for finding something GOOD :D The
        luck-factor;-) ) > --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com, Lars

        R U? Or was that something not related to the moving 3 corners alg

        you mean the best way for this solution is the solve UBL, UFL, UFR, or
        DFR THEN solve the other 3 corners (3-cycle?) Or is the
        (RU2R&#x27;F2rU&#x27;R&#x27;U2L&#x27;U2RU&#x27;) part (flip 2 corners)
        that you said to do just something else. >U might wonder if doing a

        understand what you were saying. I like figuring these things out. I
        spent about ten minutes searching for a solution to the thing I said and
        I found one. D&#x27;F&#x27;D&#x27;F UF&#x27;DF D
        LD&#x27;L&#x27;DLD&#x27;L&#x27;U2 LDL&#x27;D&#x27;LDL&#x27;U But
        it&#x27;s longer than the original! That was a little hard... So if I AM
        left with 4 corners in you are talking about, is the best way to solve 2
        corners at a time (2-cycle?, 2-twist?) (like in the above solution)?

        real 2x2x3. Try (DB)*10 without the R before those moves, now it&#x27;s

        2 corners? Yes, 3-cycle means cycle 3 corners. In Per&#x27;s example,
        there was one 3-cycle and one corner in its right place, but twisted.
        The best way is to first do one 3-cycle that solves one corner and
        leaves 3 other corners to cycle. I&#x27;m not an expert, but I hope this
        makes sense... > >Now say u did some alg that flipped 2 corners. > > Are

        colors match. This depends on whether the misalignment is off by 90
        degrees or 180 degrees. It also depends on the underlying method being
        used. - A misalignment of 90 degrees makes orientation cases difficult
        to recognise in most methods, while a misalignment of 180 degrees is
        fairly easy to get used to. - However, a method designed to take
        advantage of non-matching blocks might not have the same problems. e.g.:
        http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/method/stage1.html I use this approach in
        speedcubing, so it certainly isn&#x27;t so difficult that you would need
        to be &quot;really smart&quot; to do it. This approach was designed for
        &quot;normal&quot; solving (i.e. solving from beginning to end, and not
        beginning -> end -> middle, or end -> middle -> beginning, as many FMC
        people like to do - I don&#x27;t), so it can be done without
        &quot;premoves&quot;. Examples of this solving approach can be found

        moves and trying alternatives, as if there were some obvious rules. - In
        FMC, I&#x27;m sure lots of people do this, because the rules allow it.
        Under these rules, the cube is not viewed as a game that you play move
        by move, but is instead viewed as a &quot;graph&quot;, and the goal
        being to use a search algorithm to find the shortest path within that
        graph between one node and another. In context, these rules make no
        sense to me. The 3 twisted corners case is certainly a bad case, but is
        only bad luck if you were not trying to avoid it. -- Ryan Heise

        remember most people who can do the cube, given the challenge to do it
        in FMC rules, would not shave much off their average. So just give them
        two averages (say, 61 moves for WCA standard solving, but 34 under WCA
        FMC rules). > The 3 twisted corners case is certainly a bad case, but is

        move, and so on, every place in your solution. And if you find a good
        place, insert the commutator or algorithm there. - Johannes Laire > >

        Hi :-) Try inserting a sune (R&#x27; D&#x27; R D&#x27; R&#x27; D2
        R&#x27; D2 equivalent) and also insert an edge 3-cycle to compensate for
        the edge cycle done by the sune. This may or may not work out well. Two

        Yesterday, 7 competitors found a 1-hour solution in 36 moves or less. I
        suppose the scramble was not difficult. You may want to have a look at
        it:
        RD&#x27;B&#x27;L2R2B2L&#x27;R&#x27;DL2B2D&#x27;LB&#x27;F2LUFD&#x27;L&#x27;R&#x27;D2B&#x27;F&#x27;D
        I found my winning 31-move solution in about 20 minutes:
        S&#x27;zDL2D&#x27; (left block) F&#x27;RL2B&#x27;LRU&#x27; (right block)
        x&#x27;L2URU&#x27;LU (corners - B5 case) rR2 (last 6 edges orientation)
        U&#x27;MU2M&#x27; (insert UL+UR) U&#x27;MU2R2 (M-permutation) Overall, I
        got about 10 sub-40 solutions: 31, 32, 34, 36 and worse. Congratulations
        to those who achieved good results, with maybe less luck than I had,
        especially those who managed to insert 3-cycles (waiting for Dan&#x27;s
        comment). Gilles.

        So, here is my solution, as transcribed from my awful scrawly notes ;)
        There were two nice looking blocks at the start, one on F, and one on U.
        It took me a minute to notice that you could form a 2x2x3 with these. I
        tried something like L U2 F&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; L U F&#x27; U
        B&#x27; D B U&#x27; before settling on: L U2 F&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L U
        L&#x27; F2 U B2 U&#x27; forms a 2x2x3, not pseudo. Now I try to solve
        all edges, and hope that something good happens to the corners. F L2
        F&#x27; takes care of the remaining edge on the U face. I then solve the
        remaining edges two generator style - D&#x27; B D2 B&#x27; D2. I found
        this fairly quickly, but then tried to look for other solutions solving
        more corners, perhaps wasting 15 minutes finding nothing. so we have L
        U2 F&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L U L&#x27; F2 U B2 U&#x27; F L2 F&#x27;
        D&#x27; B D2 B&#x27; D2 leaving two pure corner 3-cycles, which can be
        solved with two insertions. Right at the end I solved one corner cycle
        with D&#x27; B&#x27; U B D B&#x27; U&#x27; B cancelling 1 move now we
        have L U2 F&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L U L&#x27; F2 U B2 U&#x27; F L2
        F&#x27; D&#x27; B D2 B&#x27; D B&#x27; U B D B&#x27; . U&#x27; B and
        inserting F&#x27; U&#x27; B2 U F U&#x27; B2 U at the dot cancels another
        3 moves leaving the final 32 move solution L U2 F&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27;
        L U L&#x27; F2 U B2 U&#x27; F L2 F&#x27; D&#x27; B D2 B&#x27; D B&#x27;
        U B D B&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; B2 U F U&#x27; B&#x27; - 32 HTM Dan :)

        Hi Eric :-) I read ur comment to last weeks fewest moves challenge. Ur
        start is actually very good :-) After 12 turns u have solved first 2
        layers minus one corner. Apart from this ur best help is maybe actually
        to break away from thinking u have to do f2l then last layer for fewest
        moves. What u are doing is to solve 20 cubies, no more and no less.
        There is many many ways to do this. And i dare say that thinking
        f2l>solved is in general not very productive for fewest moves.
        Especially if ur knowledge about last layer does not stretch far beyond
        OLL/PLL. Now back to ur solution, first 12 turns : B&#x27; U D L&#x27;
        D&#x27; L2 B R&#x27; B&#x27; F&#x27; D F. If u know do D2 u have an easy
        6-move alg that solves the edges for u : F L D L&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27;.
        This algorithm is always very handy. Forward or backwards or mirrored
        ... Interestingly in this case we can do much better by helping with a
        simple setup move : R. So now instead of simply F L D L&#x27; D&#x27;
        F&#x27; we do R F L D L&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27;. And magically we
        have solved 2 more corners. So my point is, learn not only how the edges
        move for F L D L&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27;-like algs, but also how corners
        move. And use this knowledge together with setup-moves for sometimes
        very good results. Note that in addition to setup moves before F L D
        L&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; one can also insert a move of U layer after the
        first turn for other effects on the corners .. and so on ... So ur
        solution is now : B&#x27; U D L&#x27; D&#x27; L2 B R&#x27; B&#x27;
        F&#x27; D F D2 R F L D L&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27;. 21 turns and
        only a corner 3-cycle left. This should be dealt with by insertion. Read
        earlier posts about this or contact me :-) Cheers! -Per

        Hello, thank you for your advice, I normally do Petrus F2L/OC/PLL for
        speed, but have recently been in the process of learning COLL. I have
        recently started trying to lower my move count, both for speed and for
        just good brain work. I am trying to follow insertion, but that will
        take a little more work to really get it. I also use pseudo blocks/F2L,
        then sometimes have 3 moves at the end to correct all pseudo&#x27;s. I
        spent about 15 min on that solution and about 30 transcribing it
        properly, much tougher than I thought. thank you for the suggestions

        Last week&#x27;s FMC was the scramble from the FMC event at the Polish
        Open. Zbigniew Zborowski won the event with a World Record equalling 28
        moves. Here is his solution - unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a way of
        adding them to the results without them being counted in the ranking and

        Yay !! I beat the OWR on the same scramble ;-) Sadly though my solution
        took much longer than 1 hr, somewhere between 3 and 4 in total.
        Definitely orienting edges (and corners) early has great potential.
        it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s hard sometimes to see how to deal with the
        edges without bringing the corners into a really bad configuration
        requiring too many inserted cycles. Cheers to zz, 28 turns in 1 hr is
        awesome :-) -Per > --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi :) I was just wondering why Dan doesn&#x27;t want this solution to
        count in rankings. And even though zz only spent one hour and other
        people usually use more time, that&#x27;s the case in normal FMC
        scrambles, too. I&#x27;m sure he would save some moves if he used more
        time, but it&#x27;s his own choice to use only 1 hour. - Johannes Laire

        Hi Johannes, I don&#x27;t want it to &quot;count&quot; for the pruposes
        of my online FMC since ZZ made the solution in a competition outside the
        time frame. The idea of this competition (like ones we used to do in the
        past) is have some scramble that has been worked on before (like with
        the CFF competitions they used to have), and see if people can beat the
        winner of the original competition in the actual online competition. Dan

        Hello, I just posted my solution for this week&#x27;s FMC, ended up with
        a 29move solve. Generally I am satisfied with anything under 40 (F2L,
        COLL, PE) I do pseudo alot. I am slowly trying to figure out insertions
        and working on solving the cube, just not F2L/LL. When I did my solve
        this week I found a 20mo F2L (pseudo) within 4-5min, then I ended up
        spending 90min working on the last layer. My corners were permuted
        correctly but 2 were oriented incorrectly. I did Sunes and variations
        over and over trying to get it all and just when I was about to accept a
        40move solve I found the solution I entered. Sorry, so long The reason I
        am posting is because after I looked at my 35move solution I noticed
        that I had a R2 L2 right next to each other-moved it to M2 and saved a
        move. (34) then I noticed that I was able to cancel 5 more moves. (ex: U
        R L L&#x27; R&#x27; U) the L/L&#x27; cancel, then R/R&#x27; cancel and
        U/U turn to U2. Has this ever happened to you? I was able to take 6
        moves off just by canceling. Eric Stalter

        Hi Eric, The &quot;numbers&quot; are a rating calculated from your
        previous 6 performances. Those 6 performances can be seen underneath
        your solution, and the current week is highlighted in bold. If you
        haven&#x27;t solved 6 cubes yet, then your rating would be provisional.
        There are no strict boundaries, but I would suggest that 800+ is
        grandmaster, 700+ expert, 500+ advanced, 400+ intermediate, and &lt;400

        Hey! I finally took some time to look at it again. I gain a slice turn
        whichever way actually ... 1) L&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; R U L U F&#x27;
        D&#x27; F2 D&#x27; B U&#x27; D2 [F2 U U&#x27; F&#x27;>]F D F U [F&#x27;

        Hi :-) There are no sites about edges-first solving that im aware of,
        and if there are they are most likely for speedsolving anyway. The basic
        approach to edges first, which may be what u have tried, is to do cross
        first then the middle layer by simple 3-move algs and then finally last
        layer also with very simple algs. This works for speeding but gives a
        high move count yes. To make it short one makes use of the given edge
        configuration, like checking if one face has 2 or more edges placed
        correctly wrt eachother and so on. Then explore many ways to do the last
        edge(s) on that layer while &quot;picking other edges&quot;, and so
        forth. This just gives u an idea... it&#x27;s a little bit more co
        mplicated than doing corners first because there are 12 edges versus 8
        corners, but an edge has only 2 orientations versus 3 for corners. Most
        people find it not that hard to do corners first ignoring edges. edges
        first can be done ignoring corners completely. To get some corners along
        the way insert moves at appropriate places (usually one turn) to make a
        c/e pair that is not broken later. Or just reply on luck (trial end
        error) to get some corners. There&#x27;s no secret recipe just like
        there&#x27;s really no recipe for making petrus blocks either. One just
        SEES how to bring the cubies together. -Per > --- In

        Hi Eric, To solve the corners, you don&#x27;t really need a list as
        such, you can make up commutators &quot;on the fly&quot; (as Per calls
        it) One form is the PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; commutator - for example (R U
        R&#x27;) D (R U&#x27; R&#x27;) D&#x27; - the Q part is always the
        opposite layer to the middle move in the P part. Do that on your cube
        and try to understand how it works. Then talk to Per :) It took me many
        days to grasp this concept, and I only managed it for these types of
        commutator. But I think there are many other useful (if slightly longer)
        forms which you could apply. my yahoo id is hatadey if you want to chat
        about this sometime :) Dan :) _____ From:

        Doing the corners is a problem for me too. I can only do the last 5
        (easily) by messing up the edges. When trying to go fast I can do the
        edges in 16 moves on average. But like the TC the corners take too many

        Hey Eric! yoiu can try sort out the duo-twist by using 2 inserted corner
        3- cycles. The first cycle must use the 2 corners that should be twisted
        and ANY other corner. Orientation for this cycle will also not matter.
        So there is VERY good chances you will have good cancellations with the
        first one. For the second you do a strict 3- cycle to solve the 3
        corners that were permuted with the first cycle. Now you require a bit
        more luck to get cancellations. But this way of doing it will most
        likely be better than inserting ONE alg to do the work ;-) -Per --- In

        Hi Eric! I would say anything below 16 turns for edges first is good. As
        for corner insertions after that it depends a whole lot on luck. But
        usually there is at least one ok insertion (2 or more turns cancelled)
        when u have to do 2 insertions. It happens that i find no insertion for
        a single corner 3-cycle that will give any cancellation at all. But
        sometimes still save a turn or 2 coz at least u find a 8- turn
        insertion, whereas cycling those corners right at the end would have
        required 9 or 10 turns ;-) An edges first start with more than 5 corners
        to solve is not too useful unless extremely short, because 3 or more
        insertions will be needed, unless u get lucky and have 6 corners to sort
        out as 2 disjoint 3-cycle. A 3-cycle + a corner-twist is equivalent in
        terms of work to having a corner 5-cycle left to deal with :-) -Per

        Hi everyone, The website is back up, and the challenge deadline is
        extended to next week so if you couldnt access the site in recent days
        you still have a chance to submit. Next weeks challenge is the Christmas
        challenge, so watch this space! Dan :)
