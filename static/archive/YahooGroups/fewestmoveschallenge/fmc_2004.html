<br>
Just a short note to say hi, and welcome to the group!<br>
<br>
Although the group is named Fewest Moves Challenge Forum, I hope <br>
that this group can become a hub for people who would like to talk <br>
about any aspect of solving Rubik&#x27;s Cube in the fewest moves, rather <br>
than for speed.<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s make 2004 the best year yet for the Rubik&#x27;s Cube!<br>

<br>
The first challenge of the New Year is also ready for your <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
Leonid Popov suggested to me some time ago that a system of rating <br>
players performace in the FMC would be useful for tracking <br>
performance and make the FMC more competitive and therefore more <br>
enjoyable.<br>
<br>
He has sent me a detailed document containing the mathematics behind <br>
the ratings system, and has obviously put a lot of hard work into <br>
it. I shan&#x27;t go into details here, but one point worth noting is <br>
that the challenger must posted at least 6 solutions before he or <br>
she can have an established rating.<br>
<br>
How would you all feel about such a system being implemented into <br>
the Fewest Moves Challenge? Please let me know.<br>

          <div class="email-content">A ratings system could be fun, as long as we don&#x27;t take it too seriously.<br>
<br>
One problem is how to avoid penalising people for posting results. If<br>
you have two equally skilled contestants, and one always posts his<br>
results, and the other only posts when he gets results under 30, it<br>
seems hard to device a system that doesn&#x27;t rate the player that posts<br>
less better than the other. Hopefully, Leonid has a good solution for<br>
this.<br>
<br>
The other issue is that it is extremely easy to cheat in this game.<br>
You can get a 20 or less solution from a computer very quickly. And I<br>
doubt it can become much more competitive before people will start<br>
doing that - and suspect others of doing it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,
  well, I think anything that will spice the competition up is good.
A time ago, Zbigniew mentioned he would like to have the solutions 
been ranked in quarter move counting, at least the same way as you do 
for slice turn counting. I am asking you if it is possible for you to 
arrange it. 
Thank you for doing what you do. :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi, 
  congrats to Lars for his first place in the last contest and 
getting his personal record 22 moves. I wonder who is gonna be first 
to beat this number! I encourage everybody to look at Charles Tsai&#x27;s 
very nice solution, too.
I haven&#x27;t seen anybody cheating so far in this contest. Every very 
short (like under 30 moves) solution should have an explanation 
attached to it and this is what we everybody do in some or other way. 
If someone gets help from Cube Explorer program it doesn&#x27;t generate 
any explanation and there is usually none at all. I can imagine the 
program may still help in some smart way but I don&#x27;t think about it 
further.

I&#x27;m very sorry but due to problems with the website I am going to <br>

On the bright side, it gives you even more time to compete and beat <br>

I have also added the two competition pages which I hadn&#x27;t realised

          <div class="email-content">Hi!<br>
Most of us who take part in this contest prefer to complete 2x2x3 <br>
portion of the cube, first. <br>
There are 12 different such portions so you have a lot of freedom <br>
where to start. <br>
So I like putting corner and edge pieces together and then see which <br>
2x2x3 is easiest. <br>
It can be done by solving two 2x2x1 (one corner and 2 edge pieces) <br>
and putting them together with one more edge piece. After a few <br>
attempts you begin to understand the position better.<br>
This part should take no more than 12 moves (when my goal is below 30 <br>
for the whole solution). <br>

          <em>Date:</em> No Date<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">already done and see if the situation looks promising. When I feel I 
will be too far from the solved cube after about 20 moves I try to 
modify some of preceeding moves or I start from the begining again. 
I do not necesserily insist on solving 2 layers first but rather 
solve whatever is possible in few moves. 

I actually know many different methods but very rearly use any of 
them in FMC because they require more than 30 moves even in most of 
the lucky cases. 
Sometimes I use some short sequences, although not in the shortest 
solutions. 
One technique I use frequently is backtracking for solving 3 corner 
pieces in less then 8 moves.
That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m very happy when all pieces but 3 corners are solved in 
about 20 moves.
Intuition and experience (they are the same thing, IMHO) play a big 
role, here.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone!<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s Friday again, which means the results of the FMC are now<br>
online, and available from www.cubestation.co.uk<br>
<br>
You may notice a couple of changes to the layout of the results.<br>
<br>
Firstly, due to the big demand I have added a seperate QTM (Quarter<br>
Turn Metric) ranking alongside the Half Turn and Slice turn Metrics.<br>
So there are now 3 first positions up for grabs! When you enter your<br>
solutions by using the form on the FMC page, could you please also<br>
provide all three counts using the boxes provided.<br>
<br>
Secondly, from an idea given to me by Chris Hardwick, to try and get<br>
more people involved in Fewest Moves Solving, I have added different<br>
grades to aim for when playing the FMC each week. For some of you it<br>
may seem almost impossble to reach a first place with some of the<br>
amazing solutions that get posted by the greats in FMC solving. But<br>
now there is the chance to aim for personal goals, by aiming for the<br>
different levels that I have set up. You may want to aim for Expert<br>
(0-27 moves), or Advanced (28-39 moves), or if you are inexperienced<br>
in Fewest Moves Solving and are learning the ropes, you may like to<br>
go for Intermediate (40-51 moves) or Beginner (52+ moves). Whatever<br>
you decide to do, set yourself a realistic goal and try and maintain<br>
a consistent standard each week! (I did not have time to add<br>
the &quot;detailed explanation&quot; to the results page just yet, but smaller<br>
explanations can be found by clicking the buttons on the submission<br>
form)<br>
<br>
Good Luck to all of you, I hope to see you all taking part in the<br>
FMC&#x27;s to come!<br>

<br>
for the LL I&#x27;d like to use an alg that I don&#x27;t know yet, but it&#x27;s a <br>
normal OLL alg (e.g. from speedcubing.com). Are we allowed to look <br>
up and use these algs? I would use a computer to do so and the rules <br>
say that&#x27;s forbidden ;-) It&#x27;s one of those I haven&#x27;t learned yet, <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

I&#x27;m sorry, but looking up algorithms that you do not know yet, no 
matter how common they are, is forbidden in the FMC. Of course, I 
have no way to make sure that competitors are abiding by this rule, 
but I like to think that all the people taking part are sportsmen 
enough to honour these rules.

It would be the same for someone to try and look up a COLL algorithm 
to solve the LL in 1, because other people use them. 

Simple solution, learn the algorithm, and once you can execute it 
from memory, you can use it! Great for learning new algs, eh?! :)

Dan :)

P.S. I fixed the link issue, there is now a direct link to the FMC 
page in the Links section :D

The move count boxes on my form have crapped up, so I had to count

          <div class="email-content">It would mean to achieve a rating you would have to take part in 6
consecutivr challenges, otherwise to achieve a high rating a player may only
enter when he has a really great solution.

As for how it would work after that, I am not sure, ideally a player would
take part every week, and the 6 most recent challenges would be used. I
would have to iron out the system because it may be unreasonable to expect a
player to compete in every FMC every week, to acheive a rating.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, that is a good idea, I don&#x27;t think many people have taken part in 12
challenges yet however!

I will investigate a few options, and if it doesn&#x27;t happen this coming week,
I&#x27;m sure I can arrange a ratings system to begin the week after.

A good person to contact would be Leonid Popov, he is the man who supplied
the maths behind the ratings system idea. selen_a@... is his address.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody.<br>
<br>
&gt; P.S. I would really like to introduce a ratings system soon, but <br>
&gt; this may involve people taking part in 6 consecutive challenges or <br>
&gt; so. How do you feel about this?<br>
<br>
First of all I am afraid that there is a difference between <br>
consecutive average and average taken every second time.<br>
There appeare ideas about rankings in my head. I am not sure about <br>
the exact form of this, but what do you think about this (two <br>
versions):<br>
<br>
version I<br>
1. the minimum number of takings part since the beginning of FMC - 6<br>
Here let me show you an example. Let us suppose the following results:<br>
No   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20<br>
res. - 40  - 20  - 22 23  - 25  -  - 28  -  - 32  -  -  - 38  -<br>
2. the best rank - the best 6 pseudoconsecutive (breaks included) <br>
challenges + the number of breaks between challenges - in this <br>
example FMC No 4 to FMC No 15 using the following formula:<br>
(20+22+23+25+28+32)/6 + (15 - 4 - 5 (as minimum)) = 31,00<br>
or<br>
(20+22+23+25+28+32) + (15-4 - 5) = 156,00<br>
<br>
3. the actual rank - last 6 pseudoconsecutive challenges + the number <br>
of breaks between challenges and after last challenge (in which you <br>
took part) - in this example since FMC No 6 till now using the <br>
following formula:<br>
(22+23+25+28+32+37)/6 + (20 - 6 - 5) = 37,00<br>
or<br>
(22+23+25+28+32+37) + (20-6 - 5) = 177,00<br>
<br>
version II<br>
1. the minimum number of takings part since the beginning of FMC - 6 <br>
consecutive challenges<br>
2. the best rank - the best 6 consecutive challenges ever as average <br>
or sum<br>
3. the actual rank - last 6 consecutive challenges but only in last 6 <br>
months as average or sum<br>
<br>
There are of course many variations, that can be introduced.<br>
What do you think about my complicated ideas?<br>

Don&#x27;t let the number of rules and rankings exceed the number of
participants :-)

I don&#x27;t know. I just meant that you all have many ideas on how to make
a nice evaluation and rating system. But it&#x27;s never gonna be perfect,
and most of all, I like simplicity (for example, I would prefer to
keep only the first turn metric, even if it&#x27;s a big disadvantage for me).

If this becomes too serious, you&#x27;ll end up spending 20 hours every
week on it, or else your average would suffer ;-)

Anyway, nice work Dan.


Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone....

I have implemented a ratings system into the FMC, I have added these ratings
to the results page of the FMC 13/02/04, just so you can see the sorts of
numbers and differences we are dealing with here.

I have used Leonid Popov&#x27;s method of calculating ratings, or at least I have
used his formula with my rules. Leonid suggested calculating the ratings
based on the previous 6 (arbitrary) challenges, and counting those
challenges a participant didn&#x27;t enter as an infinte number of moves with 0
sports bonus. This has implications for the formula, each non-participated
in challenge results in a 0 term. I think that this is unreasonable, because
to achieve a rating based on performance, a challenger would have to take
part in 6 consecutive challenges, and continue to do so for as long as the
FMC exists. So I used the 6 previous challenges that the participant entered
when calculating the rating. This means that a contestant would not be
penalised for missing challenges due to holidays etc, but unfortunately it
means that if a contestant so decides he/she can bias their ratings by only
entering if they have a spectacular solution. However, we&#x27;re all adults
here, and I&#x27;m sure that everyone will continue to take part in the FMC in a
fair and sporting way... and in any case, if you cheat, you&#x27;re not going to
get anything out of it. So it&#x27;s in everyones best interest to cause their
ratings to become as accurate as possible so they can compare themselves
with everyone else!

If you would like to see the document sent to me by Leonid Popov, detailing
the method of calculating a rating, please drop me a line at
cubestation@... .

I hope you find the ratings useful, as it is in it&#x27;s infant stage I&#x27;m sure
that there will be some problems, but nothing we can&#x27;t sort out :)

Finally, remember, its only meant to be fun!

Dan Harris :)

          <div class="email-content">Talking about FIRST TURN METRIC, I would like to add my two cents.
I agree with Gilles and I want to say more:
The first turn metric is not only a question of sb&#x27;s preferation! 
This is a question of nature of solving the cube.
We all should slowly change our direction to this metric, not 
excluding the future championships!
Why we do not have many chances solving in speedcubing? Why this rule 
is different (read: &quot;special&quot;) for fewest moves challenges???
If the reason is: &quot;to reach better results&quot; then I say: &quot;let us do 
the same in speedcubing&quot;!
Before the beginning of Dan&#x27;s challenge I have never solved the same 
situation twice.
I strongly recommend to change this sooner or later.
What is your opinion?

If your not allowed to try many options with your cube, you just can
simulate with pen &amp; paper. If papers are forbidden, it becomes a kind
of blindfolded sport, but mental visualization and memory are not what
we&#x27;re looking for.
The problem is only that time is not limited enough -- 7*24 hours.
A 2-hour limit would be cool.

By the way, even if I&#x27;m impressed by very short solutions, I like most
of all nice solutions. We need... artistical rating! ;-)

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Part of the appeal of FMC (for me) is to see how short a solution <br>
&gt; other people can come up with and how my best solution compares. <br>
&gt; With time limits, we&#x27;d lose the stunning solutions that we sometimes <br>

I perfectly understand your point.<br>
I&#x27;ve got a mixed feeling about this question of time because:<br>
- It sometimes allows you to find stupidely very lucky cases (but<br>
after all, &quot;luck&quot; is something you cannot avoid).<br>
- Most of all, because you always want to waste more time to find a<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;d love to do FMC on a time limit some times. The person who devotes <br>
the most time to it has a big advantage the way it is now. With a <br>
time limit, it would be more a measure of skill than of invested <br>
time. It could attract some people to compete who are interested, but <br>
don&#x27;t want to spend too much time on it.<br>
<br>
The simple way to do it would be to just announce an X hour limit, <br>
and assume people will respect it. It&#x27;s easy to cheat anyway for <br>
those who want. If you wanted to police it more, you could email each <br>
competitor when they&#x27;re ready, and expect an answer back within the <br>
time limit.<br>
<br>
What other fun variations could we have? No redoing, average of 10, <br>
10 minutes per cube, would be interesting. One handed, probably not.<br>

          <div class="email-content">What about to do both every week? I mean we can submit one solution 
that we found within 1 hour (or 2 hours?) and another solution (who 
wants) obtained within a week. I actually prefer &quot;Limited time 
contest&quot; because it would save me time. I often want to improve my 
first solution later or next day, although I rarely succeed. So I 
waste time. And on the other side, I sometimes don&#x27;t have my first 
good solution within 2 hours leaving first place for others this 
way. ;-)

I would suggest that if you want to go for a self-imposed time limit, then
by all means do so, and mention this in your quote. However, I am merely the
organiser and host of the challenge, it is you guys, the competitors, who
make the challenge all that it is, and so I leave the final
decision/discussion to you. If you really think it is necessary to have more
FMC categories, then I will make this a feature of future Fewest Moves
Challenges.

It is very difficult to get your head around all the possibilities!

As I said before: Keep it simple.

It&#x27;s not like if it was a very serious official competition, with
prizes and so on.
FMC participants are a small family, and the important thing is to
share and talk about our solutions with each others.

<br>
To achieve an accurate rating - simply ALWAYS submit a solution if you<br>
ATTEMPT the Fewest Moves Challenge in any particular week. If you do not<br>
decide to attempt a challenge, then you will not be &quot;declining to submit&quot;<br>
because of a poor solution, and your rating will not be biased either way.<br>
<br>
Of course, there is no way of policing this, but if you want to acheive a<br>
fair and accurate rating then this is the way to go!<br>

          <div class="email-content">David, you presented very nice and clean solution. At the end, I <br>
noticed you have corners and edges paired nicely but you move them <br>
around way too long. Why don&#x27;t you simply continue <br>
F U2 F&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U before the last U2 replacing 10 moves with only 6? <br>

No. If I have 3-4 minutes only and no backtracking, my average is
about 38 moves (slice-turn metric).
But if more trials are allowed, I can try different starting
approaches or corner algorithms (&lt;35 moves in 15 minutes).
Then, luck is required (&lt;30 moves).

Question to all: Is luck as important for you as it seems to be for me?

Gilles.

I spent 2 hours on this week&#x27;s challenge, but can&#x27;t find a shorter
solution.
It&#x27;s incredible, I found 10+ solutions in 30 moves (STM) exactly,
starting from at least 2 very different locations...

I think it might be fun to do such a FMoC :-). 
Say, you have an hour to find a short solution and to practise it for 
speed. Then you solve it 3 times, the best one counts.

   it&#x27;s good to have a shorter mix once in a while. :-)
I hope Zbigniew reads this, otherwise I am going to e-mail him. 
I tried couple of times his solution 
 [pseudo1] B2 {U D&#x27;} (B&#x27; [3] B) L B&#x27; R B F L&#x27; B L F&#x27; L&#x27; B2 R&#x27; [/3] D2 
L&#x27; B2 D B U L2 U&#x27; [/pseudo1] R [2] B L2 D L&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; [/2] L
it works but I don&#x27;t understand the first about 20 moves. My cube is 
total mess almost all the time. 
Am I alone not understanding these moves?

          <div class="email-content">Ok thanks for letting me know Charles, I&#x27;ll update it immediately.

If you mark the slice moves it would be a great help, I tried to make the
boxes for the move counts display in the email that sends to me after
filling in the form, to check against my &quot;finding&quot; of the slice turns and
quarter turns.

But I can&#x27;t make it work :(

So yeah, it would be very useful to me!

Cheers, Dan :)

          <div class="email-content">Sheesh, sorry guys, that&#x27;s a pretty major &quot;faux pas&quot; on my account, I hope
that you find the scramble is still ok, like Lars says it is still a 25 move
mix.

As you can probably see, I make the scrambles up in my head, and so I guess
this was probably going to happen at some point. It is a lesson for me, to
check the scramble through before I release it. Perhaps one of you
programmer guys could make a small program to make random scrambles in the
FMC form?

Apologies,

Dan :)

          <div class="email-content">I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it. It will almost never happen, and it&#x27;s hard 
to spot. It took me 10 mixes to realize what was going on.

And if a less than perfectly mixed cube would get through once in a 
while, that just makes the competition a little more interesting that 
week.

Then again, I guess you could avoid cycles of 4. They&#x27;re notoriously 
repeating. Stick to 3 or 5.

          <div class="email-content">Interesting - comparing my first find I see it is the same up to 9-<br>
th move (and 2 moves at the end, too!) with what Charles posted. <br>
This is what I got: <br>
R2 L&#x27; {B F&#x27;} L R2 F. D2 F&#x27; B&#x27; U R U&#x27; R B R2 B {D U&#x27;} B&#x27; D&#x27; B U B&#x27; R&#x27; <br>
L2 and insert F&#x27; R F L&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F L at &quot;.&quot; to solve the remaining <br>
corners (31 moves).<br>
<br>
BTW, I also found a nice 28-move solution:<br>
R U B2 L2 U R2 F&#x27; B. L B&#x27; R&#x27; / U2 F U L&#x27; U2 (L L&#x27;) B&#x27; U&#x27; B U L U F2 <br>
and insert B&#x27; R&#x27; B L&#x27; B&#x27; R B L at &quot;.&quot; to solve the remaining <br>

It is &quot;cleaner&quot; than that 27-move but 1 move longer.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Mirek
Maybe I should use your terminology in which my solution would be 
described as follows:
First I&#x27;ve found solution for the whole cube but 4 corners (steps [1] 
and [2]):
[pseudo1] B2 {U D&#x27;} B&#x27; . D2 L&#x27; B2 D B U L2 U&#x27; [/pseudo1] R [2] B L2 D 
L&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; [/2] L
pseudo means, that this time not completed step 1 is done (two 
corners are left unsolved instead of one; first layer: green).
At the dot put the following alg for the remaining four corners (step 
[3]):
B L B&#x27; R B F L&#x27; B L F&#x27; L&#x27; B2 R&#x27;
moves B&#x27; and B are canceling each other.
I hope the above discription is much more understable for you.

Do not think &quot;four corners algs&quot; is any problem for me - I base on 
ELL and CLL since over 20 years...

          <div class="email-content">Thank you, Zbigniew, 
   now it&#x27;s clear to me. 
Although I came up with an extensive table for 4 corners in LL two 
decades ago I don&#x27;t remember it since I switched to Fridrich system 
for LL soon after that. The algorithms for Fridrich system were 
still developing so I learned new ones once I found a better one. 
This is why I have to solve 4 corners as a combination of 2 3-cycles.
Anyway, nice solution :-).

I spent a lot of time on the 6+1 approach too, with even less <br>

I&#x27;m not used to the approach of just getting most of the pieces right <br>

<br>
It was hard to find good edge solutions. I expect to get 6 moves most <br>
of the time, but this one is 11, or 8 after 3 moves cancelling, and <br>
it took work to find. With only 12 moves in the basic solution, there <br>

You are right of course. There seems to be a pattern occurring here, I am
probably getting lazy or less careful, but I seem to make a silly error at
least once a week :(

There is a box to enter your move count on the form, but at present it
doesn&#x27;t work. (Because I can&#x27;t remember how to make it work)
So if it&#x27;s not too much trouble, could you please enter your move counts for
all the metrics in the same box as you enter your solutions. I will assume
that all numbers sent to me are correct, although I will check them of
course.

I shall correct the results page now, thanks for letting me know!

Dan :)

Paul, can you answer? (If your name is not computer generated like 
the solutions you post.)
IMHO, the solutions are most likely optimal or at least near optimal. 
If they are only near optimal then they are not obtained simply 
tossing the scrambling algorithm to Kociemba&#x27;s Cube Explorer. 
Thus, I bet it&#x27;s an optimal solver.
If I had more than one of his solutions I am convinced be able to 
likely answer the dilema. 
Dan, can you send me few more of his solutions?

          <div class="email-content">Paul Searcy,
   this contest is about something else than using a computer program 
like Cube Explorer to let it find an optimal solution and post it. 
There are actual rules that interested competitors must follow. You 
probably missed them.
The first rule reads:
* Absolutely NO computers are to be used to assist you in finding 
part of or a complete solution.
Good luck in using your brain next time.

What&#x27;s even better, is I have already received a solution for this week&#x27;s

it works though)

Dan :)

P.S. would you still like some more of his solutions Mirek? Or not, since we
have already discovered for definite that he uses Cube Explorer.

          <div class="email-content">Dan, Mirek, you&#x27;re not fair. It could also be any other optimal cube 
solver program ;-)

I still wouldn&#x27;t call it &quot;proof&quot;, btw. Maybe the cube has some 
underlying system where you can easily &quot;compute&quot; a solution with pen 
and paper using some formulae. Similar to the matrix inversion 
solution for Rubik&#x27;s Clock that Jaap describes: 
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/clock.htm

Also, the fact that Cube Explorer prints Paul&#x27;s exact sequence 
doesn&#x27;t mean much. I think Cube Explorer finds *all* shortest 
solutions, so it&#x27;s no surprise it&#x27;s found.

However, note that I&#x27;m almost as convinced as you that he used a 
computer ;-)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Stefan, Dan,
   I&#x27;ve been running Cube Explorer for about 7 hours on my notebook. 
Although I am not finished yet it already found 7 solutions in the 
following order:
B&#x27; L&#x27; R2 D2 B2 L R&#x27; D2 F U R F U L2 D&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; U2  (18f*) 
L2 U B2 U F D2 B&#x27; R2 B&#x27; U2 F U&#x27; B&#x27; L2 R D&#x27; L2 U2  (18f*) 
F&#x27; D&#x27; U F U R2 F&#x27; R2 B U B2 U&#x27; L2 U R&#x27; D&#x27; U2 R2  (18f*) 
R&#x27; F D U2 F U&#x27; F2 R F&#x27; U B2 L&#x27; D2 U B&#x27; U2 R&#x27; F2  (18f*) 
B U&#x27; R&#x27; U F2 U L&#x27; U2 F2 D2 U R D&#x27; R2 B2 D&#x27; U&#x27; F  (18f*) 
B U F2 L2 F2 L2 D&#x27; U2 R&#x27; F2 U2 R&#x27; D2 U&#x27; L2 B2 R&#x27; F  (18f*) 
B D R2 D L R2 U F2 R2 U2 L&#x27; D&#x27; U&#x27; R D U B2 F  (18f*) 
It is quite common case when a random position can be solved in many 
ways in 18 moves.
You still need more convincing proof? 
BTW, it&#x27;s up to the competitor to convince others that a computer 
was not used to find a part of or the whole solution if asked to.

          <div class="email-content">Finally, Cube Explorer searched through all 10 18-move solutions 
giving them in this order (I appologize they are in their inverse 
form - generators):

Stefan, we cannot prove that our theory is 100% correct but like in 
physics we can test the theory making predictions based on it and 
see if these predictions fulfill.
Not knowing Paul Searcy&#x27;s other solutions he posted I predict that 
like Cube Explorer&#x27;s first optimal solutions they start more likely 
with U2, U or U&#x27; than with other moves. 
Dan, can you confirm this?

Guys, stop wasting your time ;-) You said it yourself... it&#x27;s *his* 
job to explain/defend his solution.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone...<br>
<br>
I have been in contact with Dave Hedley Jones of Seventowns regarding the issue that has cropped up lately of standard competition FMC rules. He was most helpful, he said that if we as a group could draw up a set of rules for standard FMC competition, he would pass them on to Thierry Karpiel who is the guy in charge of the French contest.<br>
<br>
So come on guys, it&#x27;s our big chance! If we as a group can all agree on a set of rules, then I will pass them onto DHJ. So what I suggest is that you all send to me by email a set of rules which you believe should be the standard rules for competition FMC. I shall compare them all, and in most cases the majority will get it, or nearest to it probably in the case of time limit/number of cubes.<br>
<br>
Here are the points which I think we should try to include.<br>
<br>
Number of cubes<br>
Time limit per cube<br>
If in the case of more than one cube, should the time limits run consecutively or concurrently?<br>
Show to judges from scratch, or have time to prepare a solution/solutions? (will most likely affect time limit)<br>
Which metric? Do we want a metric which gives low numbers, or which is easiest to count? Once we have a decision on the metric, I will pass on very details instructions of how to count moves using this metric, so there is NO confusion. Bear in mind the FMC Online counts in HTM, which usually produces sub30 solutions every week!<br>
Colour Scheme?<br>
Use own cube or one supplied?<br>
Will the competitors be isolated from each other and everyone else, or free to participate in other activities during their time limit?<br>
How many moves should the scramble be?<br>
How will the scramble be generated?<br>
<br>
And any other things you think are relevant.<br>
<br>
Reply soon, and I will get onto DHJ as soon as possible. Of course, I will not pass anything onto him before showing it to the group.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

> Number of cubes
   Solving cubes in fewest number of moves is an exhaustive mind 
work. 3 cubes or 4 hours maximum for all cubes whatever the number is.

> Time limit per cube
   The more time the better the solutions. I like 1 hour per cube. I 
would not complain if its more than that or less than that, no less 
than half an hour. If it&#x27;s less it&#x27;s a new contest. I think I can 
average not better than 35 (HTM) if having 15 minutes per cube.

   Why not concurrently?

solution/solutions? (will most likely affect time limit)
   Again, having time to prepare is like your FMC in a shorter time. 
Not having time to prepare is another contest which on the other way 
may attract other cubers. Interestingly, not every speedcuber can 
perform his/her solution slowly while counting moves. 
Systems &quot;optimal&quot; to solve the cube in fewest moves right away are 
completely different from those used when moves can be taken back 
unrestrictively. While the first have to use large lists of 
algorithms for particular situations (advantage for those who can 
easily memorize a phone book), the second do not need almost any 
algorithm at all.
   About 1 hour per cube to prepare is what I suggest.

> Which metric? Do we want a metric which gives low numbers, or which

   We talked a lot on this theme. I give up my vote. :-)

> Colour Scheme?
   six colors of course
   I prefer W-Y, R-O, B-G as oposite colors

> Use own cube or one supplied?
   Not big deal for FMContest. I don&#x27;t mind if contestants are given 
new cubes (for free :-))
   Maybe you mean another issue - should scrabled cubes be provided 
or scrambling algorithms? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;d be able to deal with both.

> Will the competitors be isolated from each other and everyone else, 
or free to participate in other activities during their time limit?
   Isolation is a good idea.

> How many moves should the scramble be?
   between 40-50

> How will the scramble be generated?
   &quot;randomly&quot;

> And any other things you think are relevant.
   Contestants may show their solutions while counting moves after 
the time&#x27;s up and the cube is verified of being scrambled in the 
correct way.

          <div class="email-content">First of all, there&#x27;s a choice between 2 kinds of contests:

FMC-1) Lot of time to think and try many things (DH&#x27;s FMC).
FMC-2) Live solving in front of the jury, no take-backs.

(***) means &quot;just my opinion&quot;


Common questions:
-----------------

- Number of cubes: 
More than one would be a good idea in order to minimize luck (3
different cubes (***)).

- Scrambles:
Competitors must face the same scrambles. Computer generated and
short. 25 moves.

- Metric:
The main problem remains slice-moves, that look perfectly basic and
natural to corners-first or big cubes solvers, and unnatural to others.
Quarter-turns or half-turns? I would say quarter (***).

- Isolation:
Yes, and that&#x27;s a big organizational problem I think. If competitors
don&#x27;t solve their cube in front of the jury at the same time, given
that scrambles are identical, they must not see other competitors
doing it before. (*)


Specific questions:
-------------------

FMC-1) Timing:
Maybe not a big problem if you got 4 hours or so, but if you give
people 30 minutes, it&#x27;s not 25 or 35, and that&#x27;s a problem if there&#x27;s
only 1 jury. Delaying starting times of competitors is not easy.
That&#x27;s why I proposed before that competitors could write down how
they will solve it. There&#x27;s no standardized notation, but at least
they could describe a minimum (steps, colors, etc) in order to
legitimate what they&#x27;re showing.
This would solve (*) too, but I agree the paper solution is far from
perfect :-(

FMC-2) As Mirek noticed &quot;not every speedcuber can perform his/her
solution slowly while counting moves&quot;. I fear that counting moves
clear, slow and loud in front of a jury could disturb competitors and
lead to unexpectedly bad results. But after all, that&#x27;s a part of the
game too.

FMC-2) If competitors solve all their cubes in a row in front of 1
single jury, there&#x27;s an advantage for those coming last, they know if
they can relax or if they should take risks.


Regarding the French championships:
-------------------------------

Did you know that the whole competition will last only 2 or 3 hours
(including speed &amp;&amp; FM contests) ?!
I think, that&#x27;s why they thought of FMC-2). So, maybe they don&#x27;t have
choice, but 5 cubes in 15 minutes is too much (***).
If they&#x27;re short of time, maybe 3 cubes in 15 minutes could be a
compromise, but they should find a different name (Live-FMC...). Don&#x27;t
expect many sub-40 achievements!


That&#x27;s all for today Dan :-)


Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dan, hi Gilles, hi everybody.<br>
<br>
Here is my proposiotion of FMC rules:<br>
<br>
&gt;Number of cubes:<br>
Five (average of three excluding the best and worst)<br>
<br>
&gt;Time limit per cube:<br>
Yes. Maximum five minutes, but no move back!<br>
<br>
&gt;If in the case of more than one cube, should the time limits run <br>
consecutively or concurrently?<br>
Consecutively<br>
<br>
&gt;Show to judges from scratch, or have time to prepare a <br>
solution/solutions? (will most likely affect time limit)<br>
Show to judges from scratch. Competitor can tell loudly his moves, <br>
using face&#x27;s colors, for example red, green double... One person of <br>
judges can write the moves down or/and make the same moves on another <br>
cube or/and it can be recorded - all these for future check <br>
posibilities.<br>
<br>
&gt;Which metric? Do we want a metric which gives low numbers, or which <br>
is easiest to count? Once we have a decision on the metric, I will <br>
pass on very details instructions of how to count moves using this <br>
metric, so there is NO confusion. Bear in mind the FMC Online counts <br>
in HTM, which usually produces sub30 solutions every week!<br>
QTM plus FTM.<br>
If you want to get sub30 solutions you have to let rules something <br>
like in Toronto - sorry, but this is unacceptable!<br>
<br>
&gt;Colour Scheme?<br>
Any you like. For judge check porposes, again somebody of judges has <br>
to normalize what has been written down.<br>
<br>
&gt;Use own cube or one supplied?<br>
Own if competitor wants to. Why not the same rule as in speedcubing?<br>
<br>
&gt;Will the competitors be isolated from each other and everyone else, <br>
or free to participate in other activities during their time limit?<br>
The best would be to isolate, but even this point was not fulfilled <br>
in speedcubing on World Championship 2003! Why? Will this point be <br>
fulfilled in future championships in any category? If yes - also do <br>
it in FMC...<br>
<br>
&gt;How many moves should the scramble be?<br>
25 HTM<br>
<br>
&gt;How will the scramble be generated?<br>
Computer<br>
 <br>
&gt;And any other things you think are relevant.<br>
Maybe it should be carried over behind closed doors to exclude most <br>
(but not all) of possible frauds?<br>
Maybe, in the case of a huge attendance, you should make less <br>
restrected eliminations? And then, the final of three, for example, <br>
with the rules as described above (with closed doors and <br>
competitors...)?<br>

   thank you for doing the search for me. So 24 moves in QTM is the 
record.
I did not go on leave but must admit I was not able to get under 30 
or didn&#x27;t want to spend that much time after my 23 within an hour the 
week before. 
You are likely the best when a time limit(like 20 minutes) is posted. 
This is because you have learnt a lot of moves for LL.
Good luck this week!

          <div class="email-content">This is interesting question with which I was puzzled decades ago :-
). IMHO, after I flipped it over many times, the grass is more likely 
to be less green on the other side. 
Ahhh, your first question, that&#x27;s what I want to talk about. To 
switch 2 corners and 2 edges and nothing else, you need a minimum of 
10 moves (there is only 1 &quot;independent&quot; solution). 
Thus, 2+2>=10.
During my early cube years, I collected moves that do just 2e+2c in 
13 or 15 quarter turns. I worked without any computer program. The 
result is available at 
http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/c2e2.html 
I did not convert the notation from ABCDEF to FRBLUD but you can do 
it easily yourself. The notation had one advantage for me - as you 
know when solving FMC, you turn the cube frequently and 
Front,Right,... does not mean what it meant originally. You assign 
colors to FRBLUD to keep track of the moves.
I also needed an alphabetical order to sort all the algorithms for 
2e+2c. Why? Because I treated all the inverses, mirrored versions and 
circular shifts of one algorithm as the same thing and put the 
minimal version in the alphabetical order in the table. This way, I 
found 17 different ways to do 2e+2c in 13 quarter turns and 46 ways 
in 15 q.turns. 
I am quite sure the list of 13-qt long algorithms is complete and the 
list of 15-qt long algorithms is INCOMPLETE. 
Is anybody able to generate missing few 15-qt long ones? There is, of 
course, nothing shorter than 13 measured in quarter turns.
Note, that there are some notation conventions used in the table:
   Aa = Ca = AC, Ba = Da = BD, Ea = Fa = EF
   As = C&#x27;s = AC&#x27;, Bs = D&#x27;s = BD&#x27;, Es = F&#x27;s = EF&#x27;

I think, also 2+2+1>=10, meaning two swapped edges + two swapped 
corners plus one twisted corner. 
It is this L&#x27;F²L&#x27;B&#x27;R U²R&#x27;B L²F&#x27; 
In quarter turns the minimum for 2+2+1 is 13.

<br>
Unfortunately time has run out for me, I have to go this evening for my<br>
field trip, and I shall not be back until the evening of Friday 30 April at<br>
the earliest.<br>
<br>
I have therefore decided to extend the deadline of the challenge 16-04-04 to<br>
next week, and here is the scramble for Friday 23-04-04<br>
<br>
R2 U2 D&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27; L (D L U2 R&#x27;)*3 D R F2 (B&#x27; U2 D L)*3<br>
<br>
Just email me your solutions please, I think the website will still be down<br>
and I won&#x27;t have a chance to sort it until I get back. I&#x27;m sorry for this<br>
inconvenience, but as usual it is bad timing!<br>
<br>
Best of luck, and the FMC should be back to normal after the 30th.<br>
<br>
Dan :)<br>
<br>
BTW: I have been emailing Ron about FMC rules for the competition, I<br>
suggested all the rules that were posted in this forum a while back, and<br>
they have been accepted graciously. However, the sticky point is the<br>
counting metric, I suggested QTM, but he wants HTM, although I put a good<br>
case to him. We have still yet to decide, I think he will make a final<br>
decision by tomorrow. So if you want to have a say, email him! But don&#x27;t<br>
annoy him too much :)<br>

B&#x27;U2R2U&#x27;B2R2F&#x27;R2U&#x27; looks like a good start, but I can&#x27;t find any good

          <div class="email-content">I agree, it looks very good and useful. I have some further 
suggestions, though:

- &quot;reversed play&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference? I just 
tried &quot;F R&quot; and it looked the same with and without that option.

- I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what &quot;reversed play&quot; is supposed to do, but 
there should be a &quot;solve&quot; option so that the entered algorithm is 
not applied to the solved cube, but that the cube is solved *after* 
applying the algorithm (so apply it&#x27;s inverse initially, I think 
there&#x27;s such a parameter for the applet).

- Let the F2L/OLL/PLL algorithms be links. When I click them, it 
should be just like when I copy them into the box with the &quot;solve&quot; 
option, so that I can easily just watch them.

Thanks!

<br>
Thanks for your entries to the past two week&#x27;s FMCs. Unfortunately the<br>
website is still down as you can probably see, but I am uploading to a new<br>
server and it should be back up by this evening.<br>
<br>
However, due to personal committments I regret to say that the FMC will not<br>
run this week, instead there shall be a week long break, and the next FMC<br>
will be launched on 7 May.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you al taking part, and sorry for any inconvenience of course :)<br>

<br>
Just wanted to let you know I am working on a small javascript program that can do various algorithm related stuff. Anyone can use it in their HTML pages. I made a &quot;howto&quot; page so you can all get started easily.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the suggestions on my page (mostly from the FMC group).<br>
<br>
You can generate random algs with it. Maybe someone can tell me the best algorithm (here I mean it in the strict programming sence) for generating random algs.<br>
<br>
here is the link<br>
http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/model/CubeObjectsHowTo.htm<br>

It works closely with my applet page<br>

I just had chance to check out your Cube Companion, and I really 
would like
to personally thank you for it. It makes my job hosting the 
competition so
much easier! Now I have a way to check my scramble, check the 
solutions, and
count the moves all in one simple to use program.

I encourage you all to download it to self-check your solutions, 
it&#x27;s really
cool.

Thanks Charles!

Dan :)

P.S. You do spell colour like that! ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Charles and everyone,

I just had chance to check out your Cube Companion, and I really would like
to personally thank you for it. It makes my job hosting the competition so
much easier! Now I have a way to check my scramble, check the solutions, and
count the moves all in one simple to use program.

I encourage you all to download it to self-check your solutions, it&#x27;s really
cool.

Thanks Charles!

Dan :)

P.S. You do spell colour like that! ;)

Or maybe yes because there was no 4th position, but three 2nd&#x27;s.

I personaly don&#x27;t like notation x,y&#x27;,x2 and such. It&#x27;s harder to 
follow and as you see two equal solutions look different. Namely 
when a slice turn is incorrectly identified. Instead of 
x2 B U&#x27; R D R y2 D R&#x27; D&#x27; R B D&#x27; {B&#x27; y&#x27; F} D F&#x27; y&#x27; L D&#x27; L&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27; F x2 
R B&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R B R&#x27; B&#x27; U B 
should be 
x2 B U&#x27; R D R y2 D R&#x27; D&#x27; R B D&#x27; B&#x27; y&#x27; F D {F&#x27; y&#x27; L} D&#x27; L&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27; F x2 
R B&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R B R&#x27; B&#x27; U B 
or what I like more, simply
F D&#x27; R U R U L&#x27; U&#x27; L B U&#x27; B&#x27; R U {R&#x27; L} U&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27; B R B&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R B 
R&#x27; B&#x27; U B
Ya, I can imagine the above notation is easier for someone to put 
down but not for everybody. 
It&#x27;s a &quot;lucky&quot; solution with no permutation in LL and thus I believe 
two people found it - first time ever in FMC :-).

          <div class="email-content">Charles, I decided to start using your FMC cube companion v.2. It 
really helps me to prevent posting solutions with typos or other 
mistakes which happened to me in the past several times. :-)
Anyway, my solution for this weak contains moves squared, something 
like (L U&#x27; L&#x27; U)*2 and your companion insists on giving me wrong 
counts even after I downloaded the latest version. I wish my 
solution was that short as what your program says.
BTW, not only scrambling algorithm may contain (L U&#x27; L&#x27; U)2 but a 
solution can too, am I right?

One note only: didn&#x27;t you consider to place the Set Up button closer

Ok, time to change. Because I&#x27;m not learning anymore. It seems that I
can find sub-30 (STM) solutions quite fast most of the time, but
sub-25 looks impossible with this (too rigid) method. 
And because I suspect the STM will not be the metric used at Amsterdam
(I asked about it, but had no answer from them yet).

A big problem remains the time I can spend on this challenge.
Sometimes it&#x27;s a bit frustrating to waste 2 hours, only to find a
solution that&#x27;s just a little more lucky, and I didn&#x27;t learn anything new.

And you, did you learn a lot of new strategies recently thanks to the FMC?

Gilles.

You all are excelent in fmc! Especially I liked the solution from <br>
Alpha Centauri :)<br>
A year ago I was able to win, but now... :( You give no chances! <br>
(except of taking holidays - do not do it again :)<br>
I am using z-b system in the range I know. Usually I try many ways <br>
until I find the way that I know.<br>
There is probably one new strategy which I learned last year in fmc - <br>
I mix my system&#x27;s steps. You do the same with corners usually.<br>

Fewest Moves Challenge #50 is here, and this time it has a twist. I urge you to give it a go!<br>
<br>
Instead of the usual &quot;lowest move count&quot; wins contest, this week the winner will be determined on a time factor as well!<br>
<br>
Time how long it takes you to come up with as short a solution as you can, and enter this somewhere in your quote on the FMC submission form when you enter. The winner will be decided by the lowest combined score, where 1 move counts as 1 point, and 3 minutes counts as 1 point. Be tactical, and please be honest!<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s make FMC #50 a fun one to remember, and also let&#x27;s see if it potentially could become a way of making FMC competitions more appealing to the real world competitive scene!<br>

Good Luck!<br>

          <div class="email-content">For the God sake, David, how did you come up with the third move U&#x27; ?
Was it just trial-and-error move? That&#x27;s what I would do. 
Nice job! Only masters can solve the cube just by intuition. :-)
It&#x27;s very rare for me, anyway. :-)
ZZ must especially like QTM! Ya, 26 in QTM is extremely good! Am I 
right, Zbigniew?

Wait, what happened to my rating? :-( It seems I did not do my 
homework. This rating relies on your last 5 submissions only and you 
definitely were better than me, David. 
At least I have 28 winnings in all 49 games - not bad. :-)

The contest is getting tight. And David brought his brother, so its 
a power play now - 3 Swedish players against weak teams like one 
Czech, one Polish, etc.
Even Lars stopped playing for USA, did you notice?
Lars, it&#x27;s not fair!

The 50th anniversary contest is going to be tough. I bet ZZ has high 
chances to win. I&#x27;ll try it on Sunday. Guys, what is the best 
strategy? OK, I know, getting below 30 within 3 minutes, right?
Good luck to all of us!

Sorry that the rules were not clear, I did not really think about modifying
them for the different competition this week.

The time starts ticking for your first attempt, and does not finish until
you have your final solution. You cannot restart the timer at any point.

Hope this makes sense!

   it seems everybody understands the rules now but they are not

Can I decide later which was my final solution? Say I found 45-move 
solution in 5 minutes and continue looking for another in next 22 
minutes I find 39-move solution. Then I realize that the first 45-
move scores better (or otherwise may happen) so I post the first one

solution because I continued?
   Thank you Dan for making the rules clear :-).

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dan, Mirek, Everybody!

It is a very good idea with mixing time and moves. I am also joining 
Mirek&#x27;s question.
If I can suggest anything than I propose to allow choosing better 
score (45-move in Mirek&#x27;s example) - this will be more similarly to 
traditional contest, I think.
I want to ask additionally one thing: Which moment is treated as 
finish: finding solution on the cube (virtually) or writing it down? 
Sometimes I need much time to take it down!

do not stop cubing :)

OK, I did not really consider that there would be confusion with the rules,
they were perfectly clear in my head... ;) Shame I am not telepathic :P

Here is how I wanted this week&#x27;s FMC to be contested:
Sometime during the week, you would sit down with the scramble, and scramble
your cube.
Then you would start the timer, and proceed to find your solution, not
stopping until you find your best solution, or you think that you would not
gain any more by using more time.
Stop the timer.
That is your attempt, you cannot make another attempt, unless you count all
the time inbetween as part of your time score. This is because you could
work on what you have learnt previously, and like Zbigniew said, would make
it a more traditional contest.

TO answer Zbigniew, the finish would be the moment you are happy with your
solution. If you can take your solution down without more manipulation of
the cube, then do not count the time to write it down. If you have to make
moves on the cube to write your solution down, then this counts in the time
period!

Hope this helps :)

Dan :)

Everything is clear to me.
Only one thing I want to be certain:
In Mirek&#x27;s example, as far as I understand, you should send 39-moves 
solution because he continued. Do we choose this version?

  I haven&#x27;t give a shot yet. Now, the rules are clear. 
Here&#x27;s what I understand now:
Suppose I find 17-move solution in 30 minutes :-) and want to improve 
it. I spend another 2 hours looking for something shorter (not 
knowing there is nothing like that) not finding anything (obviously). 
Therefore my time is 150 minutes and score 17+150/3=67 points, ending 
up with the worst score among all contestants. 
That&#x27;s fun! I am ready. :-)

I like this kind of challenge, because I got a lot (a lot) of
practice. The day I broke my record of fewest moves/STM/100 cubes/5
mins max per cube (37.X moves on average), I solved about 70 cubes in
a row this way.

So this time, I didn&#x27;t even think about spending more than 3 minutes
on my solution, and it&#x27;s perfect because the weather is very nice here
and I got many things to do outdoor :-)

<br>
&gt; What did you make of the Speed FMC?<br>
&gt; Did you enjoy it?<br>
<br>
Of course it is easy for me to say &quot;I enjoyed it!&quot;. You all know that <br>
I have had a little luck, and you a little less...<br>
Talking objectively I think it is a good idea, especially for me, <br>
because my time is continuelly limited :)<br>
<br>
&gt; Do you think that 1 time point per 3 minutes is fair, should it be <br>
longer/shorter?<br>
<br>
I think it should be five minutes.<br>
<br>
&gt; What do you now think the best strategy is?<br>
<br>
Time is not going, time is running very quiqly. So the best strategy <br>
is to finish with the first or possibly second attempt!<br>
<br>
&gt; I hope you all enjoyed it, perhaps we can make it a once a month <br>
contest or so, let me know what you think!<br>
<br>
Once a month could be ok, I think<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi, everybody,
   it seems people liked the speed variant of the contest. So did I, 
although i was not particularly lucky. 
It&#x27;s not surprising for those who met Zbigniew (ZZ) in Toronto last 
year that this new challenge is suited for him. I can imagine he was 
like a fish in water. :-) I also think that everyone who is capable 
to find a short solution (around 30 HTMoves) can beat ZZ sooner or 
later. 
One point for 3 minutes is OK but yields to longer highest score 
solutions than if the time penalty is lower, like 1 point per 5 
minutes. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s better. What&#x27;s clear is that 1 point 
should not be for less than 3 minutes. 
Best strategy? - Think quick and don&#x27;t hesitate to stop the time 
once you get shorter solution than what&#x27;s your average you measured 
within 3-5 minutes time frame.

I&#x27;d love to have this contest every week along with the classical 
one. This way those who don&#x27;t have enough time still will be able to 
participate every week. The scrambling moves can be the same for 
both FMC and the SpeedFMC but those who would participate in both 
parts must start with the SpeedFMC.
So, larger burden would be on Dan. 
Dan, what do you think? Will you be willing to sort out and post 
results from both contests later on?

          <div class="email-content">Hi, guys!<br>
   If you haven&#x27;t noticed, an interesting happened. It was first <br>
time 10 days ago I lost my highest ranking to David Wesley. He&#x27;s <br>
currently 748! BTW, it&#x27;s not the higest ranking since it was <br>
introduced. The highest was 753 I had on 19/03/04. I expect that <br>
David will brake it soon (if not I :-)). <br>
There is still one disadvantage in how the ranking is calculated. <br>
It&#x27;s better to skip one or more weeks and not post solutions that do <br>
not guarantee an improved rating in a long term. Skipping by best <br>
competitors is not good for the contest, right? So, I propose either <br>
a penalty of few points for such a skipping or few bonus points for <br>
a consecutive posting (no skip). <br>
Can we agree upon this?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Mirek, everybody,

Some great thoughts on the Speed FMC this week, thank you.

I would, if people wish it, be prepared to set up a speed FMC alongside the
current FMC, and post both sets of results each week.

This could work two ways however, the same people would compete, and we may
get some competing in speed only, and some competing in the classical FMC,
and so there would be smaller participation than there could be in both
competitions. Or in the best case, everybody who competes in the classical
FMC would also try their hand at the speed FMC, and we would also get some
new competitors attracted by the idea of the quickness of the competition.

It is a tough choice!

I was thinking of something more along the lines of Charles&#x27; suggestion, one
speed FMC every 5 weeks. That way we could also have a celebratory speed FMC
on the 75th and 100th versions of the competition (assuming it goes that
far! I hope so).

As for the ranking points system, you are right, there is an advantage in
missing weeks in which you cannot find a good solution. This is why I urge
anyone who makes an attempt on a solution also posts it in the same week.
But I would consider docking 3-5 points or so for every week missed.

What do you think?

Dan :)

First of all it&#x27;s been another successful week for the FMC, David Wesley winning with a beautiful 23 mover, with Mirek close behind also with an Expert solution.<br>
<br>
Also congrats to Chris Szlatenyi for taking part in his first FMC!<br>
<br>
Just to let you know, after some thought, I have decided to deduct 10 (ten) rating points for each competitor for each week missed. This will not damage those who miss the odd weeks here and there but will punish those who only post when they have good solutions.<br>
<br>
Good Luck this week, hope to see you taking part!<br>

<br>
This week&#x27;s FMC will run as usual, and deadline for entry will be 12 pm (UK time) Friday.<br>
After that, I will run a speed FMC using an algorithm I will post later on in the week.<br>
<br>
I shall post both sets of results the Friday after, along with a new challenge.<br>

I will update the news page later on to reflect this, but for now, it&#x27;s bedtime! <br>

1 penalty point / minute would be nice :-)
I&#x27;m half serious. If the speed-fmc is here to make people find
effective methods that could become speedcubing methods... no, I&#x27;m
wrong, speedcubing is a matter a 1/100s, not minutes.

Dan, I think the rule should be more strict. The timer should be
stopped when the final solution is on paper, and not before. Even if
you don&#x27;t touch the cube, you&#x27;re still potentially working on your
solution.

Gilles.

I agree with Gilles and Ryan:
- 1point/minute
- no back moves allowed and
(zz)- QTM (not SQTM!) as a base :)

<br>
Thank you all guys.<br>
In final I had a solution of 36 after half an hour. Then I have found <br>
33 and... could not repeat :( I was trying to repeat about half an <br>
hour and finally I gave up. It was good, because thanks to that I was <br>
looking very hard for the better one and... 31 :))<br>
<br>
By the way, Mirek. How long have you been thinking on your 29 moves <br>
in Toronto? Do you remember how many hours?<br>
<br>
Also I am very glad of 14,4s. Last year my time was so limited (for <br>
train) that I could not think about good average. But this one result <br>
let me earn some money for my and Wiktoria&#x27;s trip :)<br>
This 14,4s was not a lucky case in our definition. F2L I have made <br>
very quickly - maybe 7 or 8 sec. Thanks to this I could finish under <br>
15 :)<br>

Yes, congratulations to Zbigniew on his EC win, you deserve it man!

Concerning the online FMC, I am really sorry that I failed to make an update
for the whole of last week, but tomorrow evening I shall post the results of
the last challenge, and start a fresh one.

It&#x27;s been a very manic, but enjoyable couple of weeks!

Dan :)

Guys, we can try to solve the same position now. The scrambling

David had all his puzzles in a small suitcase, but he did show me a cloth
bag that he had also, with a 3 rabbits puzzle on it, something like &quot;how can
you draw three rabbits with two ears each, only using 3 ears&quot; or something
like that. He also said he was flying to China the next day to see the very
first example of this puzzle.

Last week&#x27;s solutions were very cool, spare a thought for Francois Sechet
who came up with a very nice solution, but to the wrong scramble :( oh dear.

Good to be back!

Dan :)

Hello to all!<br>
<br>
This is Sebastian from FMC. I decided to join this group when I saw <br>
Mirek&#x27;s message (#211). Thanks Mirek, I like very much your solution <br>
too! This is the first time I get a first place in FMC. Now I have <br>
to hurry and solve the new FMC in the week-end, because school has <br>
started here in Finland and I don&#x27;t have as much time :( .<br>
<br>
Congratulations to Zbigniew for his results at EC! I&#x27;m sure going to <br>
come at the next European Championships, I&#x27;ll get better at Fewest <br>
Moves and speedcubing until then.<br>
<br>
Good luck to all,¨<br>

Try this ec2004 scrambles limiting with 90 minutes! I am almost sure 
you will get better than me.
Also all you guys who could not be present at ec - try and send

We are waiting for your results :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi, there,
   as Charles said, not being under presure, no distraction, and 
with some luck we can do better. I was not far from running out of 
time. What I found was 30-move solution in 77 minutes. But I was 
aiming under 30 and therefore did not bother with potentially 35 and 
more. BTW, I did not see any straightforward solution under 38 
within those 77 minutes. After a short break I realized I could find 
a better insertion of a 3-corner-cycle (getting my final 29-move 
piece). It overall a bit more than 90 minutes, however.
Mirek

Zbigniew, if you give me less than 10 minutes for FMC, I&#x27;m pretty 
sure you will beat me. MG

such a short time and not having stickers to wind back for insertion <br>
points like i normally would :D<br>
<br>
I want to toss out an idea for u fewest-moves freaks. How about <br>
running a parallell super-FMC to Dan&#x27;s FMC. What one would need to do <br>
is to solve a cube with all centers also solved (super-solved). Apply <br>
the scramble given. Then find a short algorithm that not only solves <br>
the cube, but also supersolves it. I have never really heard of <br>
anyone besides me who likes to do that kinda stuff. But it&#x27;s fun and <br>
quite different from normal fewest moves solving. I only know a <br>
couple of ppl who have ever tried this. But they haven&#x27;t really <br>
gotten into it. <br>
<br>
Anyone else who would be interested in this or have other ideas about <br>
super-fewest-moves ?<br>
<br>
Happy counting ;-)<br>

That&#x27;s what I did once, long ago. More precisely, with U/u/R/r turns:

Too bad there was no artistic ranking :-)

Why not super-fewest-moves? It is new for me. Maybe we should count 
people interested in it on this forum? Or first we can put sfmc into 
this forum? Dan, what do you think?

I am only afraid that there will be not to many people interested in 
it. Enough to say that in standard fmc there were sometimes only two 
people (not excluding me) :(

keep fewest-moving :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone!

Yes I am still about, I have been reading your posts every night after
getting in from work, but spare time has been very short in supply at the
moment so I am very sorry that I have been putting off my usual tasks.

First of all, FMC 57 was still open at the time of your message Gilles, but
is NOW CLOSED, and the results are online on my website
www.cubestation.co.uk and follow the Fewest Moves Challenge link.

I will post another scramble soon today, since I won&#x27;t be home at all
tomorrow, and this will form the FMC for the week beginning Friday
27th/Saturday 28th.
I like your ideas about 2-generator and super-FMC, and I have been having
some thoughts about it. To be honest Per, I don&#x27;t know if there will be any
interest in super-FMC at all, the FMC community is quite small, when
compared to speedcubing, there are not many supercubers to begin with, and I
don&#x27;t think anybody who supercubes takes part in the FMC at all! (Apart from
you of course :) )

2-generator style may be popular, it is much easier to solve than a
supercube, and I am very fond of the 2-generator group as you know :)
The only reservations I have is that since you only have a choice of two
sides to move, the solutions would be much less diverse, and we may have
many people coming up with the same solution. But I might try it! There are
still a few hours left before I post the scramble :)

Let me know what you think guys.

Dan :)

Interesting results!!!
4 solutions in 38 QTM, 5 in 28-31 STM and 5 in 29-31 HTM!
F&#x27;UB&#x27; looked like a good start, isnt&#x27;it ?

Ryan, could you explain your solving a bit more please? You comment
makes me think you could be god or one of her friends ;-)

<br>
Very nice solutions this time, congratulations to Mirek for again <br>
beating me with one move :( and also to Gilles for having best STM! <br>
The move F&#x27; was the obvious start, and in step 2 I only wanted to <br>
orient the edges, the corners were luckily in their places.<br>
Ryan, your method&#x27;s step 3 is very intelligent! I always have <br>
trouble with corner permutes (other than Niklas). Now it will be <br>
much easier. And in the next FMC I&#x27;ll try to use corner 3-cycles ;)<br>

Cubestation. Seems that being second by a difference of one move is <br>
starting to be a habit for me :(. Anyway, that&#x27;s a progress and I <br>
should be satisfied with that (I have just got rid of <br>
the &quot;provisional&quot;).<br>
This break was welcome because I just had the tests period, and an <br>
active FMC would have got me much lower grades...but now I can&#x27;t <br>
wait for Friday!<br>
See you in a week!<br>

Hi, Dan,
   you really kept your word! Great! 
I hope that advertising the restart of FMC at www.cubestation.co.uk 
in the speed solving group helps to bring many guys to this Fewest 
Moves Challenge. 
I&#x27;ll give my shot this week, too.

Charles, how you only got 6th place in the STM category with 29 moves is unbelievable!<br>

Despite all the excelent battle, we didn&#x27;t see any expert solution. 
According to the legend on the FMC web page, an expert solves the 
cube between 0-27 moves. 
Who wants to be an expert next this week? (not me, so far).

I just posted my solution. Of course, not expert (31 moves), but I&#x27;m 
glad with it. Two weeks from now I&#x27;ll be able two spend more time on 
FMC (and I hope that it will be seen!).

Dan, is it possible to post the competitor rankings too (the ones 
resulting from the previous 6 FMCs)?

Hi Charles!!<br>
<br>
Just a few suggestions for the FMC companion:<br>
<br>
1) Add an option to test ur solution. Simply append the solution to <br>
the scramble and generate the applet (or a second instance of the <br>
applet) I know it can be done by copying my solution over into the <br>
scramble (append). But that is not a really nice way of doing it.<br>
<br>
2) (If Dan will allow it) Add a possibility to post ur solution <br>
directly. Either from running the companion locally or by adding the <br>
companion to Dan&#x27;s site. Either way would be nice.<br>
<br>
And finally a question:<br>
<br>
Am i allowed to modify the javascript/html code to make my <br>
own &quot;companion&quot; ??<br>
<br>
Cheers!!<br>
<br>
Oh, and btw Charles, i hope u noticed that i do like the companion ;-)<br>

Maybe we could get 13 this week?<br>

If i have three corners to twist at the end of my solution, and I know the necessary algorithm... I look through my solution and mark with a dot everywhere where the corner pieces appear in the same layer.

          <div class="email-content">You can apply any algorithm that moves the three corners at any time 
during the solution. They don&#x27;t need to be in the same layer, most 
often they are not.

To do this, you need to learn how to do a generic 8 move 3 corner 
moving commutator, and recognize those positions. I see one about every 
5 positions or so.

It&#x27;s not extremely hard, but it&#x27;s not simple either. There is 
definitely some learning effort involved.

I think I heard that Ryan Heise has a good page on that stuff.

Hi!

I thought Dan said TWIST 3 corners ?? To CYCLE 3 corners is 
different. Some corners 3-cycles are not the basic 8 move variation, 
but need a conjugate (with partial move cancellation) in order to 
work. Or one seeks another insertion pont in order to cut down from 
8 moves to like 7 or 6 or less if lucky. And indeed this requires 
some practice. Some corner 3-cycles have at least 2 basic 8-move 
solutions. Maybe a program could be made for this ??

Cheers!!

That&#x27;s really cool... just how adaptable is the code? It wasn&#x27;t exactly what

How easy is it to script and host (for me) ?

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody...<br>
<br>
I have been thinking about the problem of competitors only posting when they have a better than average solution, so they can make their rating higher than it&#x27;s true value.<br>
<br>
I propose the following solution...<br>
<br>
A rating is taken over the previous 6 solutions sent in by the competitor, and calculated by the formula shown on my website, derived by Leonid Popov.<br>
<br>
I suggest a modified rating &quot;mr&quot; calculated such:<br>
                                                                            mr = r * cuberoot(6/n)<br>
<br>
where r = rating, and n is the number of FMC competitions that there have been from the competitors first solution to their sixth solution (6 + w , where w = weeks missed)<br>
<br>
As you can see, if n = 6 (no weeks missed) then mr = r<br>
As n increases, mr decreases, which is the effect we want to achieve<br>
This system punishes higher rated competitors harder than lower rated competitors... whether this is a good thing or not I don&#x27;t know.<br>
<br>
For example - <br>
<br>
David Wesley, r = 777, number of weeks to post most recent 6 solutions = 11<br>
                      mr = 777 * cuberoot(6/11) = 635<br>
<br>
Mirek Goljan, r = 709, number of weeks to post most recent 6 solutions = 9<br>
                    mr = 709 * cuberoot(6/9) = 619<br>

Hi everybody,<br>
<br>
Let me share my joy for my first FMC victory! I really like my <br>
solution, it&#x27;s my first expert. When I saw the scrolling test appear <br>
on Cubestation saying &quot;3 experts&quot;, I said I had no chance :)<br>
Dan, I can hardly wait to explain my solution to you, we had same <br>
first 11 moves, David had it too. The 2x2x3 was found when playing <br>
around with the applet on the FMC page after first seeing the <br>
scramble, so a mighty good start ;)<br>

That would do for me, I have taken part in all FMC&#x27;s since FMC#49 :D

Your post also helped me find out that I had a wrong idea about the 
rating. I thought that the i-th sports bonus is accorded to the i-th 
last week you participated in, so that the 6th last solution has the 
lowest sports bonus (then we wouldn&#x27;t call it a sports bonus 
anymore) so it counts less on the rating. In this way the rating 
will be kept up to date.

So far my criticism is the presenting of a new idea, but still...we 
could extend it and not count the weeks when the person in question 
hasn&#x27;t sent a solution. Thus the rating gets even lower if he/she 
has been skipping FMC.

Hope you can figure out something from this mess. I&#x27;ll write a more 
detailed post -including math and I hope examples- tomorrrow (i.e. 
today), I have to wake up early.

Sebastian

Hi Dan!<br>
<br>
Sorry for not contributing last week. I also had the same 8 first <br>
moves as u did to make the 2x2x3 block. Then i didn&#x27;t immediately <br>
find a nice finish to it. And then days just went by and i forgot to <br>
finish it off and send it :-o Just for fun i fed those first 8 moves <br>
into Cube Explorer. It found a nice 15 move finish to it. Hence 23 <br>
moves, but that&#x27;s cheating. 15 moves is still good for a random <br>
position, meaning those 8 moves is a good start :-)<br>
<br>
But this is not really the reason im posting. Ur scramble for FMC <br>
this week is : L&#x27; U2 (R2&#x27; D B L)*3 F2 D&#x27; <br>
(R&#x27; L U2 D&#x27;)*3 U R (F&#x27; D2 L R2)*3<br>
<br>
R2&#x27; is new notation for me. So i need to do that 180 degree rotation <br>
COUNTERclockwise? ... hehe ... Will it be same as if i did them <br>
clockwise? :-P<br>
<br>
OK, i promise i will make a contribution this week. I find that i <br>
need to work out my solutions in new ways to keep up w people here. <br>
My original method is better suited for superFMC.<br>
<br>
And sorry i never wrote down last week&#x27;s scramble. Im sure someone <br>
must have done.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Per,

Bit topical isn&#x27;t it! Seeing as there has been a lot of posts about notation 
in the speedsolving group just recently.
Well noticed, I wondered if people might spot it or just do it without 
thinking about it, but I guess it is too unusual to just pass it by.

(move)2&#x27; is a useful tool when writing down moves for speedcubing, because 
sometimes it is much easier to turn a side in one direction than it is in 
the other. This notation is compatible with java applets too, because it 
makes the move look more realistic to how it should be performed.
So my point was, and is, that R2&#x27; is a valid (although strictly unnecessary) 
token used in my notation :) . And yes, it is the same if you do it 
clockwise :P

By the way, those moves for the last FMC were very cool, the 2x2x2 was easy 
to find, and the other two pairs fell into place. Mirek showed me how to 
make 31 moves from my 20 move start, which would have been a great effort 
for me! 23 moves after the 2x2x3 is amazing, shame that we couldnt find it 
ourselves!

Dan :)

At first glance, this looks so cool! I haven&#x27;t got time to test it fully 
right now, I am now going to bed, but I shall review it properly in the 
morning.

It looks awesome, I love the capability of being able to sort the ranks by 
metric.

Thanks for your work!

Dan :)

D&#x27;F2LFL&#x27;FU2B&#x27;RBDU2.<br>

This gives 26 move solution :-) (30 - QTM)<br>
(I think possibly there is a 25 move solution with those first 15 <br>
moves)<br>

PS! I&#x27;m still stuck with my superFMC way of doing fewest moves. Not <br>
used to building those blocks .. and if i do i don&#x27;t find a nice <br>
finish. I will improve with lots of practice. Have fun!! I have done <br>
superFMC in 31 moves, lucky of coz. My best average is around 51 <br>
moves for also orienting centers. I used to practice that lots in <br>
mid/late 80&#x27;s :-D<br>

Hi everyone!<br>
Lars esked me to post improved solutions of his and of Dan H.<br>
Dan had easier job than Lars after he found D F&#x27; U&#x27; F D&#x27; F&#x27; U  R B&#x27; <br>
L&#x27; U2 F D F&#x27; B&#x27; D B&#x27;. D&#x27; B&#x27; D L&#x27; D2 L D2 B D. He could have <br>
inserted  B U B&#x27; D B U&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27; at the dot. 26+8-3=31 moves.<br>
<br>
After R L&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; F2 L&#x27; F&#x27; in the Lars&#x27; ingenious solution, insert F&#x27; <br>
R U2 L&#x27; B L U2 R2 F R . <br>
It is definitely not easy to figure this out. The inserted moves <br>
come from the well known shortest F R, F&#x27; R U2 L&#x27; B L U2 R2 for 2-<br>
corner 2-edge permutation as a its circular shift.<br>
 R L&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; F2 L&#x27; F&#x27;/F&#x27; R U2 L&#x27; B L U2 R2 F R/ D B R2 B R2 B R D&#x27;  <br>
(24)<br>
See that this insertion leads to the solution one move shorter than <br>
the shortest expansion of the 15 moves  R L&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; F2 L&#x27; F&#x27; D B R2 B <br>
R2 B R D&#x27;  if we are restricted to appending.<br>
<br>
For Per Kristen and whoever is interested, there are two corner 3-<br>
cycles that have unique 8-move solutions and 4 that have two 8-move <br>
solutions. <br>
Using notation [X,Y] = X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27; for commutators (notice that [X,Y]&#x27; <br>
= [Y,X]), we have the following 8-move 3-corner permutations.<br>
[R&#x27; D R, U] = [U&#x27;,B&#x27; D2 B]<br>
[R&#x27; D R, U&#x27;] = [U, L D L&#x27;]<br>
[R&#x27; D&#x27; R, U] = [F&#x27;, R B R&#x27;]<br>
[R&#x27; D R, U2]<br>
[R&#x27; D2 R, U]<br>
[R&#x27; D2 R, U2] = [U2, B D B&#x27;] <br>
Others can be transformed to the above ones by inversion, mirror <br>
reflection or cube rotation. <br>
For example, <br>
[R&#x27; D&#x27; R, U&#x27;]  is the inversion of a mirror reflection of [R&#x27; D R, <br>
U&#x27;] <br>
[R&#x27; D&#x27; R, U2]  is a cube rotated inversion of a mirror reflection of <br>
[R&#x27; D2 R, U2]<br>
IMHO, a position with 3 or more 8-move solution doesn&#x27;t exist.<br>
Can anybody double check my findings? <br>
<br>
You see that all 8-move corner 3-cycles have a simple structure. <br>
A little bit more complicated it is with 10-move edge 3-cycles. Not <br>
only they have more solutions but also not only the commutator <br>
structure. A simple F R F R F R&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; is not a commutator <br>
(BTW, why does it work?). <br>

Hi, DH, ZZ, CT, LP, SD, and others!
I oppose Dans idea. Dan, why don&#x27;t you like the simple square root? 
If we try   mr = r * sqrt(6/n) then for example
David Wesley, r = 777, number of weeks to post most recent 6 
 solutions = 11
                    mr = 777 * sqrt(6/11) = 574
Mirek Goljan, r = 709, number of weeks to post most recent 6 
 solutions = 9
                    mr = 709 * sqrt(6/9) = 579
I like it better :-)).
Well, JUST JOKING :-). I know that cubists may prefer the cuberoot :-
) but keep following me.
I don&#x27;t like the modification, that&#x27;s true, because the rating 
numbers will drop. I prefer to actually multiply the current rating 
by a number greater than one. This number should be the largest when 
the number of weeks in which one posted his recent 6 solutions = 6. 
How large (?) and this is the point, what about number 1.2? This 
means that today&#x27;s rating of 833 without skipping a week will become 
1000. 
Now, we can design a formulas that can do it. 
A) mr = r* (6/n+0.2)       /too bad for &quot;skippers&quot;
B) mr = r* sqrt(6/n+0.44)  /good enough?
C) mr = r* sqrt(6/n+0.44)  /I like this one best

Using C) we have 
- higher rating than today if n&lt;10
- lower rating  than today if n>10
- the same rating if n=10
- 1000 if today 845 and no skipped week (n=6)
- our examples:
   David Wesley, r = 777, n = 11
                    mr = 777 * sqrt(6/11+0.4) = 756
   Mirek Goljan, r = 709, n = 9
                    mr = 709 * sqrt(6/9+0.4) = 732
This is worse for me (both difference and ratio) than what Dan 
suggests but I like it better because rating 1000 is achievable.

Hi!<br>
<br>
I just wonder if any of u have any hints on how to efficiently fix a <br>
corner 5-cycle. The way i do fewest moves i usually end up with <br>
having to cycle a number of corners. It&#x27;s &quot;optimal&quot; to end up 3 or 5 <br>
corners that will need to be cycled. In the case where i have only 3 <br>
coners it&#x27;s not really that hard to look for a good insertion point. <br>
But being left with 5 corners gives u a plethora of options. If i for <br>
simplicity just number the corners 1 -&gt; 5 and i need to cycle the <br>
corners like this : (1,2,3,4,5) it could break into 2 3-cycles in 5 <br>
ways. Correct me if im wrong. This leaves us with a rather huge <br>
number of cases when looking for optimal insertion points. Which is <br>
the best way to go about with this? Yes i know and i do use small <br>
stickers on those corners with a number on them, on the correct face <br>
of the corners so they cycle correctly ;-)<br>
<br>
Any help and/or ideas is mostly welcome!<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
<br>
-Per<br>
<br>
PS! Changing insertion point can of course reduce the QTM even if it <br>
won&#x27;t reduce the HTM. So the solution will look a bit nicer :D<br>

Hi Per,
   as you say, 5 corner ending is not very welcome. Well, if it is 
after 16 moves not bad at all. I also search for two 3-cycles but 
not separately for each. I watch all 5 corners moving around trying 
to catch the right moment when to perform one of those 5 possible 3-
cycles. It&#x27;s not easy but doable. Sometimes I miss some, sure. After 
that, next 3-cycle is easier to find. A drawback is that you never 
know if you did the best, because the order in which you choose 
those 3-cycles, matters.
IMHO, average number of moves for 5-corner cycle is about 11 when 
you can insert them in about 18 moves. Yap, stickers are the 
necessity.

Hey Mirek!

Yes i agree that order matters when u break the 5-cycle in 2. Putting 
stickers on all those 5 corners is almost a must i believe. It saves 
u time from having to look for insertion point 5 times over for the 
different brakdowns. By the way, it is of course easiest to look for 
insertion of a basic commutator 8-move 3-cycle. But at least 
theoretically it can be worthwhile to check out 9- or 10-move 3-
cycles also, if the move-cancellation u can achieve is paying off ;-) 
This weeks FMC i did end up with corner 5-cycle as u might have 
guessed. I had 19 start. And i then got them cycled in 13 extra 
moves. And one last thing. Sometimes there is several similar 
insertion points for a 3-cycle. What i mean is that they give same 
number of moves in HTM. But they could of course be different in QTM. 
You can even find one way to insert that is longer in HTM, but it is 
shorter in QTM.

Hey!<br>
<br>
Here is a great challenge (opportunity) ;-) Anyone who is willing to <br>
try to supersolve the normal FMC scramble can submit the solution to <br>
me (no explanation required). Just submit the sequence of moves and <br>
ur name. Please use FRBLUD only. I will announce the (eventual) <br>
winner in this group. Solutions can be submitted to : <br>
perfredlundSPAM@.... Please use subject &quot;Super FMC&quot;.<br>
(Remove SPAM from address above)<br>
<br>
Here is how it works. First u need a supercube so that u can see how <br>
the centers are oriented, be it a picture cube or normal cube with <br>
some markers on the centers (or other pieces). Supersolve this cube. <br>
Then apply Dan&#x27;s scrambling algorithm. Now try to find short sequence <br>
that supersolves the cube again. For most ppl i guess they need to <br>
think completely differently in order to orient centers as u go <br>
along. It is NOT productive to just orient all centers at the end of <br>
normal solve, that will probably give like 60-70 move solution or <br>
worse.<br>
<br>
We will start from FMC #64. Deadline will be just the same as normal <br>
FMC.<br>
<br>
If noone sends their solution i will contribute one, so u can see how <br>
it&#x27;s done. I&#x27;m sure some of u can come up with a better method than <br>
the one i use :-)<br>

Hey Per!<br>
<br>
Speaking of corner 5-cycles, I got one for this week&#x27;s FMC this <br>
morning at school. Because today is the last day of the FMC week, I <br>
didn&#x27;t have enough time to search every posible 3-cycle. Inserting <br>
directly a 5-cycle is really painful (I managed to insert a 6-move 5-<br>
edge permutation in FMC 60, and I&#x27;m proud of that one!), because the <br>
corners have so many orientations.<br>
BTW, I use the stickers exactly how you described it (not that there <br>
would be another good way...)! They are small, round and red - I try <br>
to avoid putting them on the orange facelets, and I have to replace <br>
them every 5 cycles.<br>
Any experts this week?<br>

Hey!<br>
<br>
Ok, it&#x27;s past submission deadline for this weeks FMC so i can safely <br>
post my SUPERsolution here in the group. I will give the sequence as <br>
well as comment the various steps.<br>
<br>
Here is the sequence :<br>
<br>
RFR2D2RD2L&#x27;BLD&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;BUB&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27; (17)<br>
<br>
Now all edges except 3 are solved. All centers are oriented <br>
correctly. And one corner is solved. I wanna keep this corner solved <br>
while solving last 3 edges. That will leave me with 3 3-cycles on <br>
corners instead of 4. So i turn F&#x27; before R&#x27;U2RU2.<br>
<br>
F&#x27;R&#x27;U2RU2 (5)<br>
<br>
At this stage i solve remaining corners (7) with 3 3-cycles that fit <br>
together quite nicely. Didn&#x27;t try to optimise cancellations further.<br>
<br>
R&#x27;BR-F-R&#x27;B&#x27;R.DF2D&#x27;-B2-DF2D&#x27;.LF&#x27;L&#x27;-B2-LFL&#x27; (21)<br>
<br>
Altogether : (43-HTM) (52-QTM)<br>
<br>
This solution wasn&#x27;t too typical of how i supersolve, but at least it <br>
shows that the approach to supersolving is different from normal <br>
solving. And the solution was quite short and nice;-) In most cases <br>
my supersolution will have a start more like Fridrich - cross, then <br>
some c/e pairs, final edges and the last corners w 3-cycles. Hope u <br>
liked my solution. U will of course need a supercube to see properly <br>
what is going on.<br>

Hi, all,
   this is not a bad idea at all. Guys, what about to give a shot 
and try to beat Per for FMC#63 scramble! We have a week break from 
FMC otherwise.

Hi!

I have received contribution from 2 ppl so far (Charles Tsai and 
Mirek Goljan). So far one has beaten me and one hasn&#x27;t ;-) Yes Mirek, 
i found ur mistake in notation after insertions. So ur solution is 
correct ;-)

Hope we can have some more solutions as well. I will post all the 
sequences found some time on saturday 27.11.

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s too late, but I got a half decent solution I thought I might as <br>
well share.<br>
<br>
B2 L B2 R L&#x27; U F L2 B R2 D2 B&#x27; L&#x27;<br>
<br>
Pretty cool for 13 moves! The best continuation I found was R F2 D F&#x27; <br>
D&#x27; R&#x27;, which leaves only 4 stickers wrong after 19 moves. I can <br>
complete it in 31 with the same ending as last week, but it can be done <br>
in 29 using the well known 10 move solution, that I clearly should <br>
learn. That ending is R&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; D2 R D&#x27; R&#x27; D2 L R D.<br>
<br>
Interesting to see that for the second time, the solutions were very <br>
similar. place 1-3 all had the same idea, which is simllar to mine, and <br>
4 and 5 had the same first 7 moves! I guess we&#x27;ve all converged on a <br>
pretty similar method.<br>
<br>
I spent most of my time trying to get some variation of L&#x27; U&#x27; L to <br>
work, but it didn&#x27;t want to.<br>

The results for the 12/11 FMC are online now, a lot of quite similar solutions! I look forward to the result of Per&#x27;s Super FMC also.<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t been able to update the ratings this week, because I don&#x27;t have Microsoft Office on my new hard drive yet, and I need Excel and Access to update the database.<br>
<br>
But I will post them as soon as I can. New scramble is up, hope you had a nice break from FMC last week, and hope you&#x27;re all fired up for this week!<br>

Good Luck!<br>

Sebastian, you could have cut two moves from your excellent solution <br>
in one of the three following ways:<br>
B2 R U D2 F L B R2. B&#x27; D F2. D F&#x27; D2. F2 D&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27; + 3 edges inserting<br>
[R2,U&#x27;B&#x27;D&#x27;F&#x27;] at the first dot or inserting<br>
F D RL&#x27; F2 R&#x27;L D F&#x27; at the second dot (best in STM) or inserting <br>
[D2,R&#x27;B&#x27;L&#x27;F&#x27;] at the third dot. I am recalling notation of <br>
commutators [X,Y] = X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27;. <br>
Unfortunately, you missed all of these.<br>

Here are the results of the  first Super Fewest moves challenge.<br>
I had 3 entries (apart from my own ... lol ... )<br>

Congratulations to everyone who participated!!<br>
<br>
Here is the breakdown of Mirek&#x27;s winning solution :<br>
<br>
L&#x27; U&#x27; B2 L F R&#x27; D2 R L B&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; D B R D&#x27; R D R L B&#x27; R&#x27; F R&#x27; B R <br>

B&#x27; R&#x27; D [2] B R D&#x27; R D R L B&#x27; R B. L&#x27; D&#x27; R2 D. R2 Insert B&#x27; R F R&#x27; B <br>
R F&#x27; R&#x27; and D&#x27; R U R&#x27; D R U&#x27; R&#x27;, respectively. Interestingly, you see <br>
4 antislice moves (RL or R&#x27;L&#x27;) in this solution and 15 turns of the <br>
right face - clearly, I&#x27;m right handed:-). The best 2x2x3 I can do in <br>
11 moves L&#x27; U&#x27; B2 L F U&#x27; B U D2 B&#x27; R2. <br>
<br>
-Mirek<br>
<br>
I think everyone except me had their first go at this. I&#x27;m impressed <br>
with all solutions sent to me :-)<br>
<br>
Maybe we will have another go at this at a later time. Now i will <br>
gonna try to crack (normal) FMC #64 ;-)<br>

Hey Mirek,<br>
<br>
I remember that I encountered those positions in my solution, but I<br>
didn&#x27;t know how to solve them in less than 10 moves, and I didn&#x27;t know<br>
the commutator you used. It is though possible that I found a 9-move<br>
cycle in one of those positions and that I didn&#x27;t write it down<br>
correctly, so when I came later to it it looked like it didn&#x27;t work.<br>
This week I&#x27;m going to try to get corner 3-cycles: they are easier to<br>
handle!<br>

Hi everyone
All your solutions are nice.
Until Wednesday I have got 48 (as far as I remember) HTM solution 
(have not written it down). I was hoping to find something under 43 
(Per&#x27;s of course) but unfortunatelly I have got not a minute of free 
time since Thursday :-((
Once more congratulations :)

Hi Charles!!

I will try to explain, but i will use a slightly different variant:

[RBLF,U2] (=RBLF-U2-F&#x27;L&#x27;B&#x27;R&#x27;-U2)

Study what the top layer looks like after those 4 first moves. U 
almost have rotation symmetry :-) If the edge now at RF had been in 
RU position, the symmetry would be perfect. And in that case the full 
commutator sequence would just yield the identity. It is this slight 
deviation that does create the 3-cycle of the edges ;-)

If u really wanne see that do the following :

[RBLF-E&#x27;R&#x27;ER,U2] (=RBLF-E&#x27;R&#x27;ER-U2-R&#x27;E&#x27;RE-F&#x27;L&#x27;B&#x27;R&#x27;-U2)

Voilâ!! No change!!

Maybe Mirek has a better explanation ?? 

Happy cubing :-)

PS! If u wanna do a 2 flip do like this :

[RBLF-U&#x27;BE2B&#x27;,U2] (=RBLF-U&#x27;BE2B&#x27;-U2-BE2B&#x27;U-F&#x27;L&#x27;B&#x27;R&#x27;-U2) (long!!)

Hi!

I found yet a better improvement :

Take the first 18 moves again :

B2 R U D2 F L B R2 B&#x27; D F2 D F&#x27;.D2 F2 D&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27;

Insert F L2 U2 R2 B R2 U2 L2 at the dot:

B2 R U D2 F L B R2 B&#x27; D F2 D L2 U2 R2 B R2 U2 L2 D2 F2 D&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27; (24-
HTM)

Here are 4 different versions of the same edge 3-cycle:<br>

1) U2 B&#x27; U2 L2 D2 F&#x27; D2 L2<br>
2) D2 L2 U2 B&#x27; U2 L2 D2 F&#x27;<br>

Hi, everybody,
  thanks Per for helping me to explain why commutator [RBLF,U2] = 
RBLF U2 F&#x27;L&#x27;B&#x27;R&#x27; U2 works. I don&#x27;t have a better explanation. It is 
true that this one and a few others below are not that easy to 
understand as 3-corner cycles.
Good job, Per, finding 3-cycle  F L2 U2 R2 B R2 U2 L2  that makes 
Sebastian&#x27;s solution as short as 24 HTM! I completely forgot this 
move. It is not a commutator if we insist on using just uppercase 
letters notation, see 
http://www.necrophagous.co.uk/cubestation/cubenotation.html
Here we need an operation &quot;mirror reflection&quot; Z that maps F&lt;->B&#x27;, L&lt;-
>L&#x27;, R&lt;->R&#x27;, U&lt;->U&#x27;, D&lt;->D&#x27;.
Then, F L2 U2 R2 B R2 U2 L2 = [F, L2 U2 R2 Z].
This reminds me that there are other 3-cycles that may come useful in 
canceling moves beside  
F  L2 U2 R2  B R2 U2 L2 = [F, L2 U2 R2 Z].
F2 L2 U2 R2 B2 R2 U2 L2 = [F2, L2 U2 R2 Z],
F R F R F  R&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27;,   likewise the previous transfer cubies 
from F to B layer and perform single intermediate move F (B) or F2 
(B2), this one transfers cubies (mostly those that eventually come 
back to their original place) from R to F and back.
F R F R F2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R2,
R B L F  U2 F&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; U2 = [R B L F, U2], this is found at the 
beginning of this text,
R B L F  U  F&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; = [R B L F, U].
It is then useful to know all these including their cyclic shifts 
like L F  U&#x27;  F&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; U R B , from the inverse of the last one, 
or B L F  U2 F&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R.

BTW, to flip two edges, the shortest commutator is [R&#x27; F D&#x27; R F&#x27;, E] 
which is not hard to understant.

Hi Dan,

The link saying &quot;Click here for a full explanation of how the 
rankings are calculated&quot; is not working, i.e. there is actually no 
link there. Is there really a page, or are you making it now? But I 
guess that the modified ratings are calculated after one of the 
rules mentioned here in the forum.

Concerning chat, I propose that if all of us have the Yahoo 
Messenger, then we can make each other contacts and we can make a 
conference using Yahoo Messenger. This of course if Dan&#x27;s efforts 
will have no success.

What do you think?

Sebastian

P.S. Congratulations, Mirek!

Yeah, it&#x27;s ready in anticipation for a page to be made ;)

I have been working on the site all day, and so I will make this page some
other day.

I have managed to set up the chat again, it uses different software, and
unfortunately has advertising. But they justify it by giving me the software
for free :D

You can access the chat directly at
http://www.necrophagous.co.uk/cubestation/cubechat.php - or in the usual way
from my homepage.

IMPORTANT - Read the chat notes in the yellow box before you log in :)
I hope I covered everything, see you in the chat at 7 or maybe a bit before!

I guess that&#x27;s because I asked Dan not to be part of the rankings.
I rarely have enough time to participate, and I wan&#x27;t to feel free.
If I begin to look at the rankings, I&#x27;ll waste my time trying to
improve mine and I&#x27;ll get fired ;-)
But if it&#x27;s a problem, do as you wish.

Gilles.

The results of this week&#x27;s challenge are now available from the FMC page -
www.cubestation.co.uk &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/>  

 

Quite a quiet week, but congratulations to Charles Tsai who posted the
shortest solution to an FMC since the competition began, he has reduced the
benchmark to just 21 moves!

Thank you to all who entered!

 

Also added to the results of FMC #65 03/10/04 is Alexander Ooms&#x27; solution,
which was posted in time last week but an error on my part meant that I
didn&#x27;t post it with the other results! Sorry Alex, your solution is now
listed on the results page.

 

I&#x27;m planning to do something a little different for the Christmas Challenge,
but at the moment I haven&#x27;t got a clue what! Any suggestions would be taken
on board :D

 

Speak soon!

Hi, 
  Dan is looking for something a little different for the Christmas
Challenge. I&#x27;ve got ideas for FMC.
a) solve any two layers of the scrambled cube
b) solve any one layer
c) solve any one side (pretty nice idea for beginners, isn&#x27;t it?)
d) solve the cube regardless corners and edges orientation, i.e.
coreners can be twisted, edges flipped
I think even c) may not be easy when moves count. I&#x27;d love to do a),
b), and c) the same week.

Hi!

Congratz to Charlie for his amazing 21 move solution!! Makes me feel 
like a complete beginner with fewest moves :-P

Well anyway, my question is whether one needs to post separately for 
each category of the Christmas Fewest Moves ? Otherwise i think Dan 
will have a rather tough job compiling the results. I assume that the 
number of contributers will increase again. Being 12 or 13 is much 
better than just 4 like last week. Whether people were just busy or 
found the scramble hard i don&#x27;t know.

Good luck to everyone in the Christmas Challenge!! And thanx to our 
host Dan :D

Merry Christmas everyone ;-)

Yeah, if it is not too much trouble, could you send in either the results
separately, or really make it clear in the solution box which solution is
which. Space to write in the solution box is unlimited (I think).

But if there is any trouble compiling any results, I will get in touch to
clear things up :)

Does solving one layer (for the special Christmas Challenge) imply <br>
also that we have to align the layer with respect to the centers, or <br>
can it be oriented in any way?<br>
I&#x27;m having a hard time with the 2x2x3&#x27;s and the one-face solutions, <br>

Hi,
  I suggest that the one solved layer doesn&#x27;t have to be aligned with 
center in the second layer.

2x2x3 is tough this time. Whoever makes it in 9 moves wins. I&#x27;m not 
the one yet.

<br>
Hi everybody,<br>
<br>
Does solving one layer (for the special Christmas Challenge) imply <br>
also that we have to align the layer with respect to the centers, or <br>
can it be oriented in any way?<br>
I&#x27;m having a hard time with the 2x2x3&#x27;s and the one-face solutions, <br>
but I hope I&#x27;m gonna compensate on the whole cube solution ;)<br>
<br>
Merry Christmas to all!<br>

I didn&#x27;t check it before, I just assumed that you had found a cool solution
for one layer. But that is really cool. 

No it&#x27;s not allowed, you found a loophole I suppose :P

So it&#x27;s one layer consisting of 4 edges, 4 corners, and a centre piece
please :)

Stefan, I like your findings. 
Surely, if there was a 5-move (QTM) to a &quot;regular&quot; one layer, almost 
everybody here would find it.
BTW, can you find 4 moves (HTM) that solve a center layer?

Hi ! :-)

I can !!!

D L2 D R2, this is 6 in QTM though ... lol ... :D

There are also other loopholes! If one applies the scramble to a 
5x5x5 cube, then one has plenty 2x2x2 and 2x2x3 blocks for free :-P 

Who says they have to include a corner? ... hahaha ...

And hey, those 4 moves above will solve 3 (!!!) layers on the 5x5x5 
cube ... :-P

Have fun :-)

Hi Mirek!!

Im about to create an &quot;alg-inserter&quot; program :-)

So i&#x27;m starting with looking into all possible basic corner 3-cycles. 
By simple reasoning all basic commutator style corner 3-cycles will 
have 2 facelets (stickers) on the same face of the cube. These 2 can 
be either adjacent or opposite. If i let the 2 facelets be on the U-
face then there are 8 cases for the last facelet for each of those 2 
situations. 2 on each of the 4 faces adjacent to the U-layer. Now we 
can also have either clockwise or counterclockwise cycling of the 3 
facelets when the corresponding corners are cycled. Half the cases 
have 2 solutions. This gives 24 different sequences. By 
rotation/translation/inversion (mirror reflection is already 
covered!) we will end up with 24*12*2+12*12*2 = 864 different cases 
for 8-move corner 3-cycles. All of these need to be checked at every 
insertion point. And repeatedly for each corner 3-cycle to be 
inserted. I want to first complete the program for the devilish 
corner 5-cycle problem i always end up with. Then later expand it to 
edge 3-cycles that are more complicated i believe. (each possible 
cycle has numerous solutions!!!)

I do however agree with ur 6 basic cases! But i need all possible 
sequences :-)

And also i need a way to normalise the description of the cycles.
For instance (UFR,UBL,LBD) = (BLU,BDL,FRU) ...

Any ideas about this project is warmly welcome :-)

Hey Lars :-)

I don&#x27;t think Mirek invented the technique of inserting a corner 3-
cycle at an earlier stage in ur solution. I have been doing that for 
20 yrs now, using stickers. Until 2 yrs ago i never heard of anyone 
else doing alg insertion like that :-)

What i want to achieve first is to find optimal insertion of corner 3-
cycles. I&#x27;ll start off with disjoint 3-cycles. Then proceed with 
decomposition of corner 5-cycle to 2 3-cycles. 7-cycle into 3 3-
cycles. And other varieties. Yes it&#x27;s ambitious. I want to deal with 
edge 3-cycles later on as well. Their sequences are more numerous. 
What i need is to work out all the basic 3-cycles. Then have my 
program automatically generate all variations by symmetry/inversion 
etc. And keep adding algs for the basic cases as i find more ... Edge 
3-cycles come in 6,7,8,9,10 or 11 moves variations.

I could have included other corner 3-cycles than the basic 8-move 
commutator style ones. But the chance that inserting one of those is 
the best insertion is pretty low i guess.

I also need to normalise my cycle notation. For corners i can for 
instance order them from 1-8 and always put the lowest numbered 
corner first. And then &quot;rotate&quot; this first corner (notationwise) so 
that it always starts with U or D and &quot;rotate&quot; the other affected 
corners correspondingly. I can do something similar for the edges 
also.

Other algs are also possible to find insertions for, like corner swap 
+ edge swap variations. But searching for setup moves is more 
complicated ;-)

Cheers!

PS! It will initially be a standalone program with a simple GUI.

Hi Dan,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not worried, but let&#x27;s just make sure. I just sent my solutions <br>
(all of them) and after every one I got the page saying<br>
<br>
Thanks for participating in the Fewest Moves Challenge! <br>
Your solution has now been added to The Cube Station database and <br>
the results of the challenge will be posted on the &quot;Fewest Moves <br>
Challenge&quot; section on Friday evening! etc. etc.<br>
<br>
so there should be no problem. And I think I also sent you one <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone!

 

The results of the Christmas FMC are now online on my website -
www.cubestation.co.uk &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/>  and click on the
Fewest Move Challenge link.

It was a really enjoyable challenge, I hope you had a lot of fun taking
part, and if you didn&#x27;t take part there is always the New Years challenge to
play in!

 

It was hard work posting the results, so I apologise for any aesthetic
mistakes, although I am 99.9% sure that all the solutions listed are correct
and do solve the scramble to the desired position. If you think there is an
error please get in touch.

 

Happy New Year guys, have a great cubing 2005, and make it your New Year
resolution to take part in the FMC, we are a friendly bunch ;)

 

Dan Harris :-)
