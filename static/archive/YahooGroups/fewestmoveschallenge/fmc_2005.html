        Hi, guys, sorry for the delay. It seems that we both (I and Per and
        maybe somebody else too) invented the same technique. I was using it
        when solving cube pretty patterns in about 1981 already. 8-move corner
        3-cycles are commutators as follows, [ABA&#x27;,C] =
        ABA&#x27;CAB&#x27;A&#x27;C&#x27; , B and C can be 180 degree turns, and
        their inverse. All cyclic shifts are covered, i.e. if ABCD..H is an
        8-move corner 3- cycle then BCD..HA is a corner 3-cycle as well. So you
        do not have to consider cyclic shifts, as you have noticed. What I want
        to say is the next. If you want to include 10-move corner 3-cycles like
        [R F&#x27; R&#x27; F, U] then a few cyclic shifts should be included,
        like F&#x27; R&#x27; F U F&#x27; R F R&#x27; U&#x27; R. It happened to
        me in one of FMCs that a 10-move was the best to be inserted (don&#x27;t
        remember which FMC #). Anyway, I don&#x27;t know what is a good way to
        deal with the problem you have. What is a use for the program when it is
        finished? We cannot use a computer program when doing FMC. And it for
        sure is not an easy project. Mirek --- In

        Ouch! With Per&#x27;s FMC 63 improved solution (from 28 to 24 moves) and

        Hi :-) If Mirek started using stickers as an insertion technique already
        back in 1981, then i think he has beaten me by a year or two :-) I used
        that technique solely to insert edge and corner 3-cycles. To use the
        technique for other things like orienting edges, swap 2 corners and 2
        edges and so on is more complicated. So i think that is beyond what my
        program will be capable of (because it will not look into setup moves
        and such). I also compiled a rather huge list of pretty patterns
        throughout the 80&#x27;s. I think i stopped at around 255 or so. After
        that it beacame too tedious, and some of them were rather symmetrical
        exercices than really beautiful striking visual patterns on the cube...
        Nowadays u can produce thousands of symmetric patterns in no time with
        the Cube Explorer. The reasons for making such a program is that it is a
        real timesaver for what it will do. And it&#x27;s a cool programming
        challenge. Yes i know it can be used for &quot;cheating&quot; in FMC.
        But basically it won&#x27;t find more than u would find urself spending
        lots of time looking at every insertion possibility. This is not really
        where one would create a fmc winner anyway. It&#x27;s the moves before u
        do ur final insertions that determines how good ur solution is gonna be.
        Formally, using the fmc-companion of Charles tsai is not allowed, since
        the rules state that NO computer program is allowed. Even of the
        companion is not solving anything for u it is a computer program used to
        verify ur solution. It verifies basically 2 things : that u set up the
        scramble correctly, and that u wrote down ur solution correctly also. My
        program would fall somewhere between the ACube and the FMC-companion in
        terms of how much it is doing solutionwise. With ACube it is
        (theoretically anyway) possible to come up solutions that look like
        typical way of solving. 2x2x2 block, extend to 2x2x3, extend to 2x3x3
        with one c/e-pair missing and then finally the last bit. Or some other
        steps as u prefer. I&#x27;m still only at the planning stage as there is
        lots to consider and plan before i go ahead with the coding. There are 2
        key issues that i need to get right before coding: a normalised way of
        cyclic notation (and corresponding mechanisms for transforming a cycle
        into the normalised form), the break down of longer cycles to a set of
        3- cycles (or 2-cycles) and a way to compile a list of all orders of the
        resulting disjoint cycles. For instance a corner 5-cycle breaks into 2
        3-cycles in 5 different ways. And a corner 7-cycle breaks into 3 3-
        cycles in 35 different ways. I will probably only find time for this
        project during weekends, so it could be a while before i get any results
        ... :-o Happy move-counting :-) -Per

        Hello, I could see much better usage of such a program if it were
        extended to handle 4x4x4 cube. Before CubeExplorer and similar programs
        appeared, many 3x3x3 sequences were found by means of commutators and
        insertions... Now, the situation for 4x4x4 is similar, because computer
        programs are limited to sequences of length about 12. (As far as I know
        the only 2 programs that tries to solve 4x4x4 optimally are my ACube4
        and Jaap&#x27;s - if you want be a betatester, tell me). The problem is
        that there is no good way to compute good short (sub-optimal) solutions
        for 4x4x4 automatically if the optimal sequence is not short enough. A
        program that uses a database of short optimal sequences for various 3
        cycles (and 5 cycles and orientations etc.) that is able to combine them
        (using comutators and insertions) would be quite fast in providing at
        least some sequences fast and possibly good sequences in short time. The
        problem is still hard, but the state-space is dramatically reduced...
        The additional advantage would be that the program could explain a way
        to create the found sequence from the elementary ones... What is your
        opinion? (Per?) Best regards, Josef > The reasons for making such a

        Hi Josef! Yes it&#x27;s a good idea to create an alg-inserting program
        that also could work for larger cubes (revenge + professor). Corners
        would of course work the same way on any size cube. What will be a bit
        different is the edges. There will be lots more of the basic edge 3-
        cycle cases (both in terms of which edges are being cycled, and also of
        course which sequences of moves will yield them). And also we get the
        added fun of cycling around centerpieces ;-) Singular ones or blocks. We
        will indeed have blocks also for edges of course. In order to normalise
        cycle notation on the larger cubes i would need a way to order the
        pieces and to put the lowest numbered cubie first in the cycle notation.
        Pluss of course normalise the &quot;rotation&quot; of the first cubie in
        the first slot of the cycle. Example : (UBR,RFU,BLD)->piece
        ordering->(RFU,BLD,UBR) (RFU,BLD,UBR)->orient first cubie->(URF,DBL,RUB)
        We would have something similar for edges, first ordering then
        orientation. One way to determine the basic cycles that the program will
        try to insert is to supply a scramble + a partial solution. Then the
        program will determine the missing bits (cycles), and finally it will
        try insert those missing cycles (in every possible way). By the way i
        think i will not try to make it general for any size cube. In principle
        this is of course possible. It&#x27;s also possible to code the program
        so that it finds all the basic cycles for us automatically. Then it gets
        really quite horrible to code i guess. Cheers! -Per PS! I look forward
        to this week&#x27;s results. For the first time i posted expert solution

        Hi :-) Many Congratulations to Mirek Goljan who set a new official world
        record in fewest moves during Caltech Winter Tournament. He solved the
        scramble in 28 moves. AFAIK this was done in 90 minutes. (Same rules as
        applied in Amsterdam last yr for the EC.) Lars Petrus managed 32 moves
        which is also very good in only 90 minutes :-) Cheers!! -Per PS! Mirek
        also did normal speedsolving very fast. Average 23.39 in the final!!

        Hi, all! I have to say that I really wanted to see Macky solving the
        cube in 13 to 15 seconds. This was probably the main reason I
        couldn&#x27;t miss the tournament. The kid is amazing. And then he
        solved one- handed while juggling with two small cubes in the other
        (right) hand in under one minute!!! Here I post my solution from the
        contest. Please, use the inverse of my solution at the end of this text
        to scramble your cube, because I didn&#x27;t copy the scrambling
        algorithm. We had two corner-edge pairs ready in the begining, which was
        a help. It took me about 5 minutes to find this interesting 7-move
        start: L U2 B U B F U&#x27;. Next, for about 10 minutes I was trying to
        continue with F L B2 F&#x27; R&#x27; F. It didn&#x27;t turn out to be a
        promising way. Next 20 minutes I spent investigating ways to complete
        the Up and middle layers and found L U2 B U B F U&#x27; L B2 R&#x27;
        B&#x27; L&#x27; F D&#x27; L - 2 layers in 15 moves. Orienting the bottom
        layer in 7 moves leads to a long permutation at the end. So, I solved
        the edges first as L&#x27; F&#x27; D. F L B D&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27;
        ending up with a 3-corner. Inserting D&#x27; B U&#x27; B&#x27; D B U
        B&#x27; at the dot solves the corners. The total time I needed was less
        than one hour (the rules allowed 90 min). The complete solution is L U2
        B U B F U&#x27; L B2 R&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27; F D&#x27; {F&#x27; B}
        U&#x27; B&#x27; D B U {B&#x27; F} L B D&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27;

        Hi! I&#x27;m not so sure that we need another category/term quite yet.
        We have only have 2 21&#x27;s. It could become too exclusive to add
        another category. If most ppl here in the group really want another
        category then why not start at 23 and downwards? And let less than 30 be

        Hey Mirek! Just out of curiosity... It is not allowed in fewest moves
        competititons to use stickers. How do u keep track of the corners when u
        look for insertions in a competition when u don&#x27;t have stickers at
        hand? Do u write down the colors of the corners u want to cycle on a
        piece of paper? I can see myself spending lots of time like that :-o And
        i don&#x27;t dare to think of the complexity if i had a 5-cycle at hand
        :D Kind regards :-) -Per > --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        move solution also Lars, on another day that would have probably been

        Hi! My guess is that basically there are 4 potential reasons for this:
        1) They wanted to keep rules simple. 2) Nobody in WCA, or at least those
        who shaped the current rules, are active fewest moves solvers. So they
        didn&#x27;t think of it. 3) For some reason they might have thought
        using stickers is somehow unfair. First point is understandable. Second
        point is also understandable, it&#x27;s just a little lack of
        understanding of how fewest moves is done. Third point is a bit unlikely
        though. One is responsible for providing own cubes (3 cubes were allowed
        in Amsterdam), so it&#x27;s then up to the individual to provide
        stickers. Be it post-it pads, vinyl or whatever. As long as the stickers
        can&#x27;t be possibly used for cheating. Meaning probably that
        it&#x27;s not allowed to have anything whatsoever written on the
        stickers beforehand. And u can then bring a pen or pencil as u fancy.
        Pluss possibly some adhesive if u need it. Yes, the rules have to be
        changed :-) So maybe we should send a mail to WCA and bring forward our
        recommendation? -Per > --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        Hey! Here is my solution to the caltech scramble. I spent about 20
        minutes coming up with this one. Scramble was: L D2 B U2 (F&#x27;
        R&#x27; L&#x27;)*4 R2 U F2 L2(B R&#x27; D)*4 L F B2 L R U2 R2 L My
        solution: L&#x27; U&#x27; L2 U&#x27; B&#x27; - L2 U&#x27; F U R F
        R&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; L B D2 R U&#x27; D F D&#x27; F&#x27; U - B&#x27;
        U B D2 B&#x27; U&#x27; B D2 - R&#x27; The first 5 moves sets up a 2x2x2
        block at URB. The rest is pretty straight forward stuff. The 8 moves
        before the last moves is an inserted corner 3-cycle. So it&#x27;s 33
        moves without trying to optimise. Actually i found this before seeing
        the other solutions :-) Cheers! -Per PS! A rather easy scramble compared
        with the speed fmc this week ;-) > --- In

        Sorry for being late here. I&#x27;m not at home yet. Here are some
        important facts: I&#x27;ve never heard that putting stickers on my cube
        when doing FMC was not allowed. As I know the other way is true. In
        fact, I do usually use stickers. During CWTournament in San Francisco, I
        asked organizers if it was OK to use them. The answer was YES. Another
        fact is that if the answer was &quot;no&quot; it is still allowed to use
        a pen and paper. One can either write directly on the cube stickers
        (which I never did) or make notes as was said here. Whenever I
        don&#x27;t have stickers on hand I write down the colors of the cubies
        that are to be followed and keep some of my fingers on places where I
        would put stickers otherwise. I did it many times with 3 or 4 cubies
        (not with 5 however). It is not as convenient as stickers are. Another
        way can be putting little pieces of paper partialy under existing
        stickers (haven&#x27;t try this either). Why would we rule out using
        stickers if it is so easy to get around? Such a rule does not make a
        difference. Mirek --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        Hey everyone, The results to the 3rd speed FMC are now online! Firstly,
        I received a lot of blank submissions this week. I hope that there were
        not any problems in submitting, if you had a problem this week and feel
        that your solution should have been listed but wasn&#x27;t, please email
        me! Secondly, it seems that the rules aren&#x27;t very clear at the
        moment, and I want to clarify a couple of things. When I said one
        &quot;attempt&quot; at solving, I may have chosen the wrong word. What I
        meant to put across was that you can have as many attempts at the
        solution as you like (scramble - solve - rescramble solve etc etc), but
        once you have started the clock you cannot stop it and restart it at a
        later time. This is not allowed in competitions, and so is not allowed
        in the Speed FMC. Also, Gilles raised a good point in his quote. He said
        that he didn&#x27;t like SpeedScrambling, and in my &quot;blurb&quot; on
        the FMC page I stated that you should begin the clock before scrambling.
        I cannot remember how this worked at the Europeans and the Worlds, were
        we allowed to scramble first so we could check we had the scramble down
        correctly, and then the competition would start? Or did it work as in
        this Speed FMC where we started the clock before the first scrambling. I
        would like it if someone could clarify which one it was, and also I
        wouldn&#x27;t mind some feedback on what you think about this. But I
        think we should be consistent with official tournaments, maybe you think
        different ;) Happy cubing everyone, hope to see you in the FMC #71 this
        week :-) Dan :-)

        sense. From what u say now we can refind the same solution over and over
        again, or improve it, and also faster and faster eact time. Then it
        becomes meaningless. Or i misunderstand u on this point ?? Everyone
        would then just find their optimal normal short solution in a time

        Hi Per, Yes, I think you misunderstand me... It is supposed to be
        exactly like the European Championships, where we were allowed as many
        attempts at finding a solution, but only one 90 minute period in which
        to find it. So extend this to having as long as you want, but once you
        have begun, you cannot stop the clock until you have found (and
        written/noted) down your final solution. As for the FMC companion, I
        guess even though it doesn&#x27;t help you by giving you algorithms or
        whatever, I don&#x27;t think it should be allowed since we couldn&#x27;t
        use it in a competition. Finally, the first scramble... well I
        don&#x27;t mind whichever way. It would make more sense to have your
        first scramble for free, especially if you have written it down from the
        webpage and want to check it before you go away and begin to find a
        solution. Dan :) -----Original Message----- From: Per Kristen Fredlund

        but of course others might remember too) if it ever occured that two

        and a good start is quite obvious, then it might be possible. What do
        you think the odds are that, say, two identical 23-move solutions were
        sent? I&#x27;m having nightmares about somebody finding the same 21-move

        Sebastian, as I know this coincidence never happened. First about 10
        moves in two different solutions occurred, however. Even if two guys
        find the same good start then they hardly find the same ending or it
        would not be the shortest for both. Well, I think the odds are not
        negligable for few of us who use the same strategies. I predict that two
        same submissions will occurr within next 400 FMC. Based on 1 per week,
        it would be within next 8 years. At least, you don&#x27;t have to worry
        this week. To find a possible 21- move solution was very very tough this
        week. I bet my car that we will not see two identical solutions of this
        length this week. To have better odds I haven&#x27;t submit any such.

        Hmm! Just looking at the moves for mine and Mirek&#x27;s solution last
        week (FMC #72) don&#x27;t look too similar. But there are similarities:
        - Same length in htm. - Same 2x2x3 block done in 7 moves with same 2
        first moves. - Both of us finished with a corner 3-cycle. - Both
        experienced 5 moves cancellation with our last corner 3-cycle. Probably

        Hi everyone, I&#x27;m not very well at the moment, and I don&#x27;t want
        to be staring at FMC solutions for hours on end, so I haven&#x27;t been
        able to post the results tonight :-( I will post them first thing
        tomorrow morning, when I will hopefully feel a bit better! Sorryyy :-(

        Hehe Mirek! I haven&#x27;t really been trying to adopt any particular
        style. Just exploring other idea than doing the edges first and
        finishing with lots of corners. Well, i will still probably for the most
        part end up with 1 3-cycle. If i should copy anyone i would copy
        sebastian or david :-P Or why not all of u and see which works best that
        particular week ;-) I doubt i will be sub 30 this week. But maybe

        one has ever submitted the same solution as me. So it actually
        happenned. And the solution was not very short, only as compatible as
        possible with the Fridrich method, even the colours were the usual ones
        i.e. cross on the white face. Now I know it won&#x27;t happen to me :)

        OK, Per, however it is, our methods are similar mostly because they are
        very effective and flexible. We use a collection of tools, insertion
        technique and doing one or more moves before scrambilng to name two.
        Right, you should copy Sebastian or David, because they know how to do
        21. I&#x27;m still waiting for my chance ;-). BTW, I should have

        Hey again! :-) Yes i agree that we both have a collection of tools that
        we can use. And that we can adopt to what the scramble requires of us. U
        mention 2 things : insertion technique and doing moves before scramble.
        As i have noticed from the submitted solutions many now have adopted the
        technique of inserting 3-cycles (on edges or corners). Especially u
        Mirek have lots of experience also inserting other kinds of algoritms.
        And the technique of doing moves before scramble has also been used by
        quite a few. I think that most participants here will gradually expand
        their toolkit as they can study all submitted solutions (with
        explanations) from week to week. What will yield a best solution is the
        power to see when to use which tool. And also extremely important is to
        get off to a good start, and not waste time on a bad start. Also
        important is to know the cyclic structure of ur building blocks. If u
        are aware that a say : URU&#x27;R&#x27; commutator cycles 3 edges and
        also has 2 twisted corner 2-cycles then u can use it for various
        purposes, not only solving those edges. U can for example get out of the
        way corners already solved. Set up corners so that u solve 1 or more of
        them. This is very efficient compared with doing another 3- cycle in the
        end or by plain insertion later. This was just some of my thoughts ;-)
        And finally there is the element of luck also. When u suddenly get a
        5-move cancellation one can hardly say that it was planned :D Happy
        counting-moves :-) -Per > --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi ! I&#x27;m new in the FMC community, I started to be interested in
        that more &quot;cerebral&quot; way of solving the cube about 2 months
        ago, perhaps because I will never be patient enough to learn all
        Fridrich algs to solve the cube really fast ;-). I am learning ...
        slowly, but as Per mentions in his last post, your comments posted with
        each solution are of great help ! It&#x27;s amazing how I could improve
        my first very basic solutions based on a bad approximation of Lars&#x27;
        method just by watching your solutions, and finally lower down to 30 for
        #71 (by the way using exactly the same 7 moves 2x2x3 block as Per&#x27;s
        winning solution, too bad I wasn&#x27;t so inspired until the end !).
        Thank you for sharing your secrets :-) To answer Charlie&#x27;s question
        (see below), I think Alexander Ooms regularly posts sub 30 solutions...
        See you soon for #73 results ! Cyril --- In

        Hi Cyril! Great that you like FMC, I think that it&#x27;s a more
        elevated way to solve the cube than speedsolving. Probably because it
        takes more time so it has to be either more complicated or smarter :) I
        too learnt the basic tricks such as alg insertion and making corner-edge
        pairs from people&#x27;s comments. Only steal from the best! (that was
        what Lars Petrus says on his website, and he quoted that from somewhere
        else....whatever) Good luck! Sebastian

        Hey everyone !! Since there is no normal FMC challenge for u guys this
        week i have asked for Dan&#x27;s permission to organise another
        super-FMC challenge. So u have to first supersolve a cube (possible
        first make one too ;- ) ) Then u apply the fmc #73 scramble. I paste it
        here for those who have already lost it : (R B2 U L)*4 F&#x27; L D2
        R&#x27; U2 R B&#x27; (D&#x27; F2 B R)*4 D2 U&#x27; F U2 Now u simply
        supersolve the cube in as few moves as possible. It&#x27;s not
        productive to solve normally then apply center-osienting algs in the
        end. So somehow do it as u go along with the solving :-) U can submit ur
        solution to : perfredlund@... (or alternatively to my yahoo address) I
        wil post the results sometime on saturday. Deadline for submitting
        solutions is midnite GMT on friday ... U can like normally submit
        several times. Have fun supercubing :-) -Per

        This is a nice mathematical explanation/proof, Per. In fact, I have used
        this tool once or twice here more than a year ago. It is more common
        that the inverse position is about as hard to solve as the forward one.
        For example, if there is not a corner-edge pair in the position then
        there is not one in the inverse either. But, the fewest number of moves
        to forming a 2x2x2 block can be pretty different as you&#x27;ve seen.

        Hello everybody, Since I&#x27;m too tired (read: too lazy) to try to get
        a supersolution, I did something like the opposite: I found a solution
        where not only the orientation of centres does not matter, but neither
        do the orientations of all corners and edges. It&#x27;s very interesting
        to solve for such a position. So for the FMC #73 position my solution is
        the following: R U R2 L&#x27; U L F R&#x27; U R U2 B U2 B&#x27; U&#x27;
        L (16,16,19) By doing an L move before scrambling we get a pseudo-2x2x2
        for free. R U R2 makes a 2x2x3 and L&#x27; U L F make another 1x2x2
        block, leaving the F2L without an edge solved. The continuation is
        2-generator-ish: R&#x27; U R permutes the corners (the 2-gen cosists of
        faces B and U), and then U2 B U2 B&#x27; U&#x27; solves the rest. Do L
        at the end to correct the move done before scrambling. Quite
        interesting, isn&#x27;t it? And it takes ridiculously short time
        compared to the normal FMC (and super-FMC...). Sebastian

        Hey!! Im ashamed to say that i didn&#x27;t look for a super solution
        myself yet. Yes i know it&#x27;s bad. But Mirek sent me a very nice
        solution : ======= As opposed the first challenge, I found a good start
        right away. [1] R&#x27; F R&#x27; U R2 F [2] [I recommend to do F2
        before scramble] L B U L U2 L B&#x27; [3] U B&#x27; U2 B U L&#x27;
        D&#x27; R D&#x27; R&#x27; D2 L U B&#x27; L F&#x27; L&#x27; B2 L F
        L&#x27; F2 (35,41) I do not see how the last 3 corners could be solved
        better sooner. It is likely that you can improve this solution somehow -
        the part between [2] and the end. BTW, I wonder how many guys will give
        a shot. Mirek ======= So the winner is Mirek :D It&#x27;s probably an
        expert solution for supersolving. Gotta think of the limits. Something
        like 33% more moves than normal solving seems feasible. Ok, i will pull
        myself together and come up with a solution. But i doubt it will be as
        good as Mirek&#x27;s :-) Kind regards, Per PS! Dan doesn&#x27;t submit

        Hey there ! Just a comment about #75 FMC result. I have the (bad ?)
        habit to include all cube rotations in my posts, so the comparison with
        other solutions may not be evident. Most of you however surely remarked
        that all our 2x2x3 options were quite similar, but I just wanted to
        point on the fact that Charlie and I did the same 13 moves to begin our
        solutions (they diverge after edges orientation) and finish with nearly
        the same moves count (31 and 30). I think I was just lucky enough to
        land into a Sune as last layer, instead of keeping restricted to the
        2-gen part ;-) Have fun fot the next one and happy counting ! Cyril PS :

        Hi everyone, I would just like to apologise for the erratic nature of

        Hey! Wow! U have that after 17 moves? Real impressive. U always seem to
        be good at gathering most of the pieces in very few moves. There is of
        course the well known (?) algorithm that flips 2 edges and twists 3
        corners. That maybe won&#x27;t do u too much good. But here it is : (i
        used that alg in my 26 move solution some weeks ago!) R&#x27; D&#x27; R2
        F&#x27; R&#x27; F2 D&#x27; F&#x27; D2 (9,11,9) If u then are left with a
        corner 3-cycle u might be lucky to insert it in 4 or 5 moves. Giving u
        approx 30 moves in total. Or else u can try to search for a pure 2-flip
        + corner 3-cycle using ACube (or Cube Explorer). Another way to flip 2
        edges and permute 4/5/4 corners is like this: &lt;R&#x27; U
        F&#x27;,U/U2/U&#x27;> (8,8/10/8,8) - commutator, use either U, U2 or
        U&#x27; as desired. Maybe u already know all of those algs?? Kind
        regards, Per PS! Hmm was playing around for a while. A pure 2-flip and
        corner 3- cycle is like this: &lt;R&#x27; U F2 D&#x27; F, U> (12,14,12)

        Well, Per already replied and posted the most useful and
        easy_to_remember_and_work_with moves. There is another shortest case
        that can be solved easily in 12 moves: R U&#x27;R&#x27;U. F&#x27;L U
        L&#x27;F L U&#x27;L&#x27; = R&#x27;D F D&#x27;R D F&#x27;D&#x27;.R
        U&#x27;R&#x27;U (12) and related R&#x27;F L&#x27;D&#x27;L F L&#x27;D L
        F&#x27;R F&#x27; = R&#x27;F D&#x27;L F L&#x27;D L F&#x27;R
        L&#x27;F&#x27; (12) All other cases require more than 12. Like D2 F
        D&#x27;R D F&#x27;U D&#x27;F&#x27;U&#x27;F R&#x27;D&#x27; (13,14,12).
        These are from my old list of solutions of all cases in the second stage
        of my method for last layer. This method solves in the first stage one
        corner with two attached edges, then the last 5 pieces. The average
        number of moves is lower than in the Fridrich method (orientation first,
        permutation next), requires slightly more algorithms but is of course
        more difficult for differentiating between all cases and therefore
        probably not as good for speedcubing. Mirek --- In

        You need to understand the 3-cycle. This is how I think about it. 0.
        Have 2 of your corners (a and b) in the D layer and one in U (c). 1.
        Move a or b to U. 2. Replace it with c using a U move. 3. Move c to D by
        undoing 1. 4. Replace c in D with b or a, similarly to 2. So far we have
        X U* X&#x27; D*. Now commutate the whole thing by X U&#x27;* X&#x27;
        D*&#x27;. That&#x27;s a corner 3 cycle. And the inverse of it is as
        well, of course. Once you have that figured out, go back to your 29 move
        (almost) solution. 1. Pick a sticker on one of the remaining corners,
        and mark it with a pen or a piece of tape. 2. Mark the sticker that is
        in the position where the first sticker should go the same way. 3.
        Repeat 2 for the second sticker. You now have three marked stickers,
        showing how you want the corners to travel.. Now step through all your
        29 moves. You can insert an 8 move sequence if... 1. You can put the
        three corners so that 2 are in D and 1 in U, where... 2. You can move
        one of the D corners to U, so that it&#x27;s marked sticker can be
        replaced by the U marked sticker using an U move, and... 3. The marked
        stickers in D can replace each other using a D move. In that case, a 3
        cycle, or its inverse, can be inserted there to solve the cube. That
        should happen about 1/3 of the time, or 9-10 times in your case. And for
        each of them there is about a 1/3 chance that one or more moves will
        cancel, leaving you with a 36 or lower solution. I wrote this a little
        quickly and babbling, but I believe all the needed info is there, if
        maybe not in the most easily read form.. /Lars On Mar 13, 2005, at 7:31,

        Thank you very much!! Your explanation was clear enough, now I
        understand how to insert algs. The thing I still can´t figure out any
        other way than by trying is wether to use X U* X&#x27; D* X U*&#x27;

        Y&#x27;)? But as they are two moves longer you´d have to be really lucky

        thought about that, but you&#x27;re probably right. Since it stops and
        starts with the same side, it can only cancel in one end, and to get 3
        moves cancel you&#x27;d have to have one exact move cancel, and then the
        next move be on the same side. Which seems like a 1/54 chance. Then
        again there are many more of these possible, so maybe it would be
        practically useful after all. /Lars - - - - - - - - - - - - &quot;He who

        I´m sure there´s some simple rule to that. Notice that one is basically
        the inverse of the other. The way I think of it in practice is to search
        for a way to 3-cycle the stickers I want to 3-cycle, but first
        don&#x27;t care about the direction of the cycle. For example,
        &quot;scramble&quot; like this: R&#x27; D R U2 R&#x27; D&#x27; R U2 To
        solve then I want to cycle (LFD->ULB->URF->LFD). But replacing ULB in
        the U layer with LFD looks awkward. However, the inverse cycle
        (LFD->URF->ULB->LFD) looks very sweet - replacing URF with LFD is a
        piece of cake. That would be (R&#x27; D R) U2 (R&#x27; D&#x27; R) U2.
        But I want to cycle the other direction, so I apply the inverse instead:
        U2 (R&#x27; D R) U2 (R&#x27; D&#x27; R) So don&#x27;t just look for the
        cycle in the right direction, but in both directions. Does that help?

        Hi, one of my rules is &quot;never try a conjugate of a 3-corner
        cycle&quot;. Here is why. If two moves (one pair) can cancel out at the
        beginning, like A B C Y&#x27; (Y [X U* X&#x27; D* X U*&#x27; X&#x27;
        D*&#x27;] Y&#x27; ), then the result is A B C [X U* X&#x27; D* X
        U*&#x27; X&#x27; D*&#x27;] Y&#x27;. The same you get if you insert not
        conjugated X U* X&#x27; D* X U*&#x27; X&#x27; D*&#x27; between A B and
        C. So you never gain more cancellations considering conjugates. The same
        is true for edges with one possible exception for 6-mover U2 F B&#x27;
        R2 F&#x27; B because it is very short. Its 8-move conjugate without
        cancellations may still be occasionally optimal. As for stickers, what
        helps a lot is to have numbered stickers (1,2,3 for this case). This way
        you always easily see that 1 moves to 2, 2 moves to 3. I used unnumbered
        stickers for years which required to remember their order and was
        distracting. Once you have your 29 moves written down that solve all but
        3 corners, you put stickers and start redoing those moves one after
        another. Use a pointer to remember where you are currently within those
        29 moves. As you slowly do each move (inverse moves of course) you try
        to match these moves with a beginning of an above commutator. For
        example, your 29 moves are like this A B C ... D C ... and you undo C
        and you are about to undo D, i.e. doing D&#x27;, and at the same time
        you notice that D&#x27; X U* X&#x27; D X U*&#x27; X&#x27; fixes the
        corners. You got a matching D&#x27;. Here, 2 moves cancel out when you
        insert the commutator between D and C. I say that one move calcels out
        if two moves become one, like X X = X2, or X&#x27; X2 = X. I position
        two corners in U and one in D, the upside down version of what Lars just
        explained. During the search for an insertion point you need to rotate
        the cube a lot, so get used to a fixed color assignment. For me, U is
        white, Front is red, ... Mirek --- In

        Thanks to all of you for your answers! I´ll read them again tomorrow
        when I´m a bit more awake (it´s 1.00 in the night in Finland) and try
        out all the exemples you have written. There is one question I still
        have (it might become clear tomorrow though): do the two stickers in the
        D layer (having the cubies like Lars explained) in the D face or can
        they be pointing out to the sides (so that they can replace each other
        with a D turn)? Because it depends on which stickers you mark, right? If
        this is possible I assume the same rules how to rotate them applies? I´m
        sure I could figure most of this out using trial and error method but as
        there are so many helpful experts here I think I benefit more from
        training other things than having trouble with the above. Good night,
        Mikael PS. Worked out a better start (28 moves) and managed to insert
        the 3-cycle and cancel one move out for a total 35 =D

        Hey! Many good explanations on how to insert 3-cycles so far. I would
        just like to emphasize the object of doing an alg insertion. The object
        is of course the hunt for good move cancellations. Now say u want to
        cycle 3 corners (which is what has been discussed so far). Two of them
        in U-layer and the last one in D-layer. Looking at the stickers like
        Stefan pointed out is the easiest way to make sure that the orientation
        of the corners will be correct when cycling them. And numbering them
        like Mirek said makes sure u cycle the right way, and not opposite way
        of what u want. When u have worked out what the algorithm will be u will
        know what the first and last move will be. Now check if that gives u any
        cancellation. If not look for another insertion point and repeat the
        same procedure and see if u get cancellation wrt first and/or last move
        of the cycling alg. U can indeed compile a list this way of insertion
        points vs cancellations (how many moves cancelled, keeping in mind that
        u can have more than 1 or 2 moves cancelled at either end). Now if u
        need to insert more than 1 corner 3-cycle the insertions are never
        independent of eachother so u will have more work at ur hands. Generally
        insert the alg first that gives u the largest move- cancellation. Not
        doing so might unfortunately give u a better overall cancellation :-o In
        fact 2 weeks ago i inserted 2 corner 3- cycles. Inserting the first one
        cancelled 2 moves. Inserting the second (in fact into the first as it
        happened) cancelled another 4 moves! So that i guess was a bit unusual
        :-) Cheers! -Per > --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        Sure, the stickers can be pointing sideways, as long as D,D&#x27;,or D2
        moves one sticker to the place where the other sticker just has been.
        You&#x27;ll see once you play with for a while. Later, you can replace D
        with E (which is the middle layer between U and D, see
        http://www.necrophagous.co.uk/cubestation/cubenotation.html).

        Hi Mirek The explanation for this is quite simple. The rating takes into
        account a players previous 6 performances. Sebastian&#x27;s 23-move
        solution happened to replace his 21-move solution which was his sixth
        previous solution. SO unfortunately, even though he solved in 23, his

        Hey! Hmm ... I sense that most ppl are not happy with the rating. Why
        not just drop the rating? It&#x27;s not really needed. It&#x27;s fun
        enough to see how well u perform a particular week against the others

        Hi all, I see this ranking system as an ordinary rolling average
        obtained however on a much longer amount of time than the speedcubing
        rolling average. If the 13th last solve was better than very last solve,
        than the total average will drop, no matter how good these two times
        were compared to the average (in this case the good solves of 21 and 23
        moves). Also, if you don&#x27;t take part in a certain week&#x27;s FMC,
        then the ranking will drop as if you would have a very bad speedsolve or
        a failed attempt. The ranking is more complicated than the simple
        average taking, but I still think it is fair. Sebastian

        Hi everyone ! A few weeks ago, I made a proposition to Dan : &lt;&lt;I
        saw you had some unusual FMC competition (X-mas, Speed, 2-Gen...) and
        while playing with FMC companion I had an idea for a next &quot;special
        FMC&quot; : one could imagine to solve a 3 colors-cube, with {F &amp;
        B}, {L &amp; R}, {U &amp; D} having the same colors. A lot of people
        participated to X- mas challenge because they found it to be different
        than the others, and I&#x27;m sure it would be interesting to see the
        &quot;masters&quot; solve this unusual kind of cube. What do you think
        about it ? I did not want to post this suggestion on the FMC forum
        because I thought it would be better if no one could train before that
        day :-) >> What do you guys think about it ? Dan told me he would use
        this idea for #75 FMC but apparently forgot... I propose to make this
        special version with #77 scramble : B&#x27; D2 L&#x27; (F2 U R&#x27;
        F&#x27; D)*4 U2 R&#x27; B (U D&#x27; L2 F&#x27; R)*4 D&#x27; L2 F&#x27;
        It&#x27;s a nightmare of CE pairs ... but I have no idea how shorter it
        is compared to normal FMC - I guess anyone can can be convinced
        it&#x27;s not longer ;-). You can send me your solutions at my email
        address cyrilca[at]caramail[dot]com until March, 25. I will definitley
        try to solve it and hope you&#x27;ll participate ! Cheers, Cyril

        Hi all, I seem to have the habit to stay up all night to find a solution
        exactly when the deadline is postponed. I&#x27;m now at school, I have
        just sent another solution two movws shorter than the one I sent last

        means that on a normal cube you would have to get into a position where

        I like the idea with solving 3-color cube. As you might not know, having
        a solution S3 for this, applying it to the regular 6-color cube there is
        1/6 chance that the position is solvable with square moves ( i.e. the
        position will be in the subgroup [F2,B2,R2,L2,U2,D2]. Also, there is 1/2
        chance that the position will be an odd permutation. The reason for 1/6
        is the existence of 3-corner cycles (cycled left or right) like this: U
        R2 D R2 D&#x27; R2 U2 R2 D R2 D&#x27; R2 U = U B&#x27; R&#x27; B2 R B U2
        B&#x27; R&#x27; B2 R B U BTW, this is the worst case for 3-corner cycle
        to solve in fewest moves. I even don&#x27;t remember its optimal 12-HTM
        generator R2 U&#x27; B2 U B2 U R2 U&#x27; B2 U&#x27; B2 U , but
        it&#x27;s not hard to figure it out. Mirek --- In

        Actually a 2-edges or 2-corners switch can be seen as a 3 cycle :-) The
        awful thing is to differenciate the corners but as soon as you know
        which are the same and get a good solution ending with a switch,
        it&#x27;s not any harder than 6 colors FMC ! Remember you can as well
        use well known LL algs like T permutation to switch 2 corners on a
        solved 3-colors cube ... Btw, I found a solution (will post it at the
        end of the week) which had 1/6 chance to be a FMC world record,
        according to Mirek&#x27;s last post... But when I switched back to

        Hey! U could always &quot;cheat&quot; by having some marks on the

        looking at the orientation of the centers. I won&#x27;t call that

        Hi! 3-color cube with same color on adjacent faces (case 2) is much
        harder than with same color on opposite faces (case 1). The best easy
        way to measure the &quot;hardness&quot; is to calculate entropy of
        randomized cube or the number of possible positions. Case 2 has 3 times
        3 identical edges and 3 1-color edges. This way, number of all possible
        positions on regular 6-color cube would be reduced by factor 3^3*2^3 if
        any position on 6-color cube was possible. Since 2-cycle and 1-flip of
        edges is not possible, the reduction coefficient is 9*8/4 = 18. Corners
        are all different. Case 1 has 3 times 4 identical edges and twice 4
        identical corners. Twisting one corner or one edge is still not
        possible, so the reduction coefficient is 6^3*6^2/2 = 3888. So its for
        sure that the case 1 is easier and the average optimal solution is
        shorter than in case 2. Can anyone double check the numbers? I invented
        (as you know decadees ago :-), no patent issued ;-)) comparably
        difficult 4-color cube. With only four colors its difficulty is between
        the above two cases. You divide each side with one diagonal and color
        half of them - the triangular shape - with different color. Do it so
        that 4 corners will be painted with one color and other four with three
        colors. All centers have 2 colors and must be oriented like for
        supercube. For this cube the number of all positions is reduced by
        3^4*3^4*2^12 (4 1-color corners, 4 times 3 identical edges and 12
        -1color edges) but multiplied by 4^6*12 (oriented centers and single
        twists and odd permutation possible). If I am correct, the reduction
        number is = 3^8/12 = 546.75 . I recall that there was a 1/2 chance that
        the last corner could not fit at all and I had to rotate all centers and
        solve the cube over again. This actual painted cube of mine is cross the
        ocean in Czech Republic and I can&#x27;t play with it for now. Who is
        gonna paint yours? Mirek --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi Alexander! (and everyone) I happened to browse prvious results when i
        spotted ur comments to ur solution for FMC #76. U said u had started

        R&#x27;.B R B&#x27; (D&#x27;) reaching 2 twisted corners in 24 moves. If
        u now insert the following 2-twist at the dot : (R&#x27;D2R
        B&#x27;U2B)*2 u will have solved the scramble given in 34 moves. One
        less than ur final solution :-) The inserted 2-twist is very easy and
        short. Keep it in mind for later FMC&#x27;s :-) It&#x27;s cyclic shifts
        and symmetrical variations are of course also useful. -Per PS! I

        Yes, the closest is Rubenking Cube at the
        www.randelshofer.ch/rubik/virtualcubes/index.html Just use 4 colors
        instead so that 4 corners have only 1 color and other 4 has 3 colors.

        Per, it&#x27;s worth to look further towards the beginning of the
        sequence. You show that the following insertion of 2-twist gives you

        D R&#x27;((R&#x27;D2R B&#x27;U2B)*2)B R B&#x27; D&#x27; I found 33-move
        solutions of this type, i.e. 3 moves cancel out at the insertion: R B
        L&#x27; U L R D L B2 L B&#x27; L U (U&#x27;R F2 R&#x27; U B2)*2 B

        B&#x27; L U B U&#x27; L U2 R D R&#x27;B R B&#x27; D&#x27; The 2-twist
        and its cyclic shifts as we insert here is indeed very useful, easily

        Hi, guys, did you try to solve that 3-color cube as Cyril asked to?
        Interesting, there are tricks we use for 6-color cube that do not work
        here. Per once wrote the proof that the inverse of any solution to
        scrabled cube solves the inversly scrambled cube:
        &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; If we call the scramble M
        (mix) and solution S then obviously : MS = I (identity)
        (M&#x27;M)(SS&#x27;) = I (trivial, M&#x27; = inverse of M, likewise
        S&#x27; = inverse of S) M&#x27;(MS)S&#x27; = I M&#x27;S&#x27; = I
        &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; Well, this is not true for
        3-color cube (and other), where some cubies are considered identical.
        The reason is because (MS)=I doesn&#x27;t imply that A(MS)A&#x27;=I.
        Performing MS on other that solved cube is not identity unles MS is
        identity on 6-color cube! Another (strange) implication is that we
        cannot use the trick with performing one move before scramble and than
        appending it to a solution algorithm. Mirek --- In

        Hi everyone! It&#x27;s really great to see the group so active! Thank
        you Cyril for hosting the 3-colour contest this week, it wasn&#x27;t so
        much that I forgot to make #75 a special contest, it was that when we
        suddenly came round to #75 I had not prepared anything and I did not
        have any time! So I would like to announce that 08/04/05 FMC#80 will be
        a special 3-colour cube (opposite colours the same) contest. So get
        restickering your cubes today! The ratings system has again come into
        question recently, and I&#x27;m still pretty much in the same place as
        when I started. It is definitely not a perfect system, but I would like
        to stick my neck on the line and say that at any one time the ratings
        seem to reflect fairly well the long-term abilities of any competitor,
        in my opinion :-S Please feel free to shoot me :D It would certainly
        save me a lot of work if the ratings were ditched, but I think that
        people would also like a way to compare themselves against the other
        competitors, it&#x27;s something to work towards, so for the moment I
        think they will remain as they are. But I&#x27;m sure the discussions
        aren&#x27;t yet over! To Charles, I want to begin implementing the
        search facility that we came up with very soon, it&#x27;s an ideal time
        for me because at the moment I am on my Easter break. I haven&#x27;t
        forgotten about it, but I think it&#x27;s going to take a few hours to
        get it all up and running and to get my head around the procedure I will
        need to get into each time results day comes round. Could we possibly
        speak in real-time over Yahoo Messenger or so? I am usually online most
        of the time, my handle is hatadey. Finally, I have uploaded Per&#x27;s
        Puzzle Scrambler into the FMC tools section of the FMC page. Per coded a
        really useful FMC scrambling option into his scrambler, so you can now
        generate practice scrambles which are in the style of the FMC scrambles.
        And they will be in the FMC style because from now I shall be using his
        scrambler to generate the weekly scrambles! Thanks Per! FMC #78 is now
        up and running, so best of luck everybody, and hope to see you all soon!

        Per, you presented a new way of solving FMC - edges first. Very nice! I
        thought about this way but never tried. It&#x27;s not easy to &quot;not
        to care about corners for a while&quot; or pretend that you don&#x27;t
        care and solve just 3 or more corners along. I looked at your solution
        and modified your 14 moves U2 L&#x27; U B D2 R&#x27; U R . B U2 L2 R F2
        D2 inserting 3-corner cycle R&#x27; U&#x27; R D2 R&#x27; U R D2 (for
        free) at the dot. You can see it as postponing D2 move. I just gave a
        shot and then counted how many corners were not solved - five. U2
        ..L&#x27; U B R&#x27; U. R D2 B U2 L2 R F2 D2 insert U&#x27; R D2

        Hey! No need to say that i was indeed lucky to get 3 corners after doing

        Hi everyone! Thanks to Charlie we now have a brilliant new way to access
        the FMC archives. It&#x27;s not running perfectly yet, but the main
        problems are only aesthetic. You can now sort each weeks results using 4
        different metrics (HTM, QTM, STM, and SQTM), and you can also look up
        solutions by a particular person given an upper and lower limit to their
        move count in any of the four metrics. And there will be more to come! I
        have only put the two most recent sets of results into this search
        facility, but this should be enough for everyone just to see the power
        of this new archive, so have a play around with it! And if you have any
        suggestions, then please let Charlie and I know. It&#x27;s already
        available from the FMC homepage -
        www.cubestation.co.uk/fmcresults/fmc.php - maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have
        posted it until we got things absolutely perfect but I am just so
        pleased with the way it works I couldn&#x27;t wait to put it online :)
        Eventually the whole archive of FMC results (almost 80 weeks worth!)
        will be available using this method. This is going to be quite a task,
        so I would be really grateful, if you have the time and energy, for some
        help with this. All you would need to do is create 5 or 10 weeks worth
        of xml files using data from the archive we have presently. We have a
        cool little tool which helps you create the data with all the tags and
        stuff, so it&#x27;s just a matter of cutting and pasting really. If you
        are interested, please get in touch with me and I will give you the full
        details. Happy FMC&#x27;ing! Dan :)

        Hello! The new results archive is very useful! One thing that I miss is
        that when looking at a result you only see the results of that specific
        metric, it would be nice to see the results for all metrics (as it was
        before). But there may be a tecnical reason for this change. A return to
        FMC main page or cubestation main page would be nice. Once I come to the
        results page I can´t get back using the back button either. These might
        all be temporary problems that will be fixed when the final version of
        the new archive is up. May the few moves force be with you all, Mikael

        Hey Anssi :-) I had a look at ur solution for last weeks FMC. After 21
        moves u complete f2l like this : F D B2 L D F U&#x27; R F R F&#x27; R D
        R D&#x27; U F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B. There is better continuation than
        OLL and PLL. Finish the edges and one corner like this : B U L U&#x27;
        L&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27; Then u have : F D B2 L D F U&#x27; R F R
        F&#x27;.R D R D&#x27; U F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B2 U L U&#x27; L&#x27;
        B&#x27; U&#x27;. Now insert F&#x27; R&#x27; B2 R F R&#x27; B2 R at the
        dot. This gives the final solution : F D B2 L D F U&#x27; R F R F2
        R&#x27; B2 R F R&#x27; B2 R2 D R D&#x27; U F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B2 U L
        U&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27;. That has improved ur solution from 39
        to 33 moves in HTM :-) It&#x27;s worth not looking solely at OLL and PLL
        when doing final layer. It&#x27;s usually not good for fewest moves
        solutions. Unless u can skip one step. The way i see how to insert the
        corner 3-cycle is using stickers. U will master that with some practice.
        Kind regards :-) -Per

        Hi, I just had a look at the rankings from #69 FMC on, and picked the
        LAST rating of all of us. This is actually not the way Dan computes the
        unofficial ratings for a given date, but this was just to have an
        overview of the small FMC world... It&#x27;s actually not very
        surprising to see Mirek at the top of the list ;-) Mirek : 774 David :
        695 Sebastian : 692 Per : 649 Lars : 640 Gilles 556 Cyril : 552 Ville :
        543 (p) Charlie : 540 Mikael : 511 (p) Alexander : 477 Chris : 472 Eric
        : 455 (p) Alan : 440 Francois : 438 Max : 404 (p) Zbigniew : 401 Anssi :
        396 (p) Mike : 320 (p) Fernando : 312 (p) indicates provisional ranking
        Hope I didn&#x27;t make too many mistakes, and wish you all the best for
        the next challenges ! Cheers, Cyril

        HI Everyone, My computer broke down yesterday, and I have to take it to
        a shop to get it repaired. This means that I have not got access to the
        emails that contain the FMC submission data, and I only have acccess to
        my temperamental little database. The only solutions I have so far are:
        Paul Searcy (:-S) Anssi Vanhala (details were added but no solution or
        quote) Alexander Ooms If your name isn&#x27;t on this list, and you have
        submitted a solution for this week&#x27;s FMC 79, then if it is not too
        much trouble, could you please resubmit your details. As requested I
        will soon calculate a new FMC world rankings list as well, we will see
        how close it comes to Cyril&#x27;s approximate list! Happy FMC&#x27;ing!
        Dan :)

        Second of all, why is this message posted? Is this a good method for FMC
        or is this someone trying to advertise his/her products? Totally off

        Hello FMCers, First of all congratulations to Mirek who strengthens his
        leader position and to me who weaken my non-leader position, after which
        we get to the point: I will show how I was about to be very happy about
        a FMC solution, but didn&#x27;t ge to be. Here&#x27;s a path that I
        tried for FMC 79: L F&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; D F D F L F&#x27; B2
        D&#x27; B&#x27; which is pseudo-F2L without an edge. At this point I
        thought about solving the corners so that I could be lucky to get an
        edge 3-cycle left, and I soon found that a F R&#x27; F&#x27; R U R
        U&#x27; R&#x27;-like algorithm would solve the corners. The position
        could thus be continued in two ways: B R&#x27; B&#x27; R D R D&#x27;
        R&#x27; D B&#x27;, first the alg then correcting the LL and the
        pseudo-move, but the first move cancels out with the last move of F2L,
        giving 5 edges left after 22 moves; D L B&#x27; L&#x27; B D B&#x27;
        D&#x27; B2, first the LL correction and then the alg, no moves cancelled
        out at the beginning but the last move merges with the pseudo-correction
        move, giving 5 edges left after 23 moves. We have either L F&#x27;
        U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; D F D F L F&#x27; B2 D&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; R D
        R D&#x27; R&#x27; D B&#x27; or L F&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; D F D F
        L F&#x27; B2 D&#x27; B&#x27; D L B&#x27; L&#x27; B D B&#x27; D&#x27; B2.
        At this point I had already started to look for insertions, when I
        noticed that the last 11 or 12 moves use only three faces. Mindful that
        I had once a 27-move solution (in the Christmas Challenge , message #344
        on this forum) which could very well have been 25 move if I had checked
        it for LL correction cancellations (which were not that obvious because
        of an inserted corner 3-cycle), I checked for a possible shorter
        solution. What I got is B L&#x27; D L B D&#x27; B2 instead of B2 D&#x27;
        R&#x27; B&#x27; R D R D&#x27; R&#x27; D B&#x27; or B2 D&#x27; B&#x27; D
        L B&#x27; L&#x27; B D B&#x27; D&#x27; B2 giving 5 edges left after 18
        moves L F&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; D F D F L F&#x27; B L&#x27; D
        L.B D&#x27; B2 which is pretty nice. It gave me hope for looking for a
        5-cycle of edges. I did look, but all I found was a 14-move insertion F
        U&#x27; F&#x27; L D B&#x27; F L B F&#x27; L&#x27; F U F&#x27; at the dot
        which consists of the edge 5-cycle D B&#x27; F L B F&#x27; done after 4
        positioning moves. I&#x27;m quite sure that there is a shorter way of
        doing this 5-cycle. Can you help me? I don&#x27;t expect a concrete
        example, just a hint or some clever tricks of doing positioning moves in
        edge cycles. Sebastian

        Hi Sebastian! I found a good way to finish off ur 18 move start :-) Like
        this : L F&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; D F D F [1] L F&#x27; B [2]
        L&#x27; D L B D&#x27; B2 [1] = F&#x27; B D B D&#x27; F B&#x27; L B&#x27;
        L&#x27; [2] = D&#x27; B&#x27; F L2 B F&#x27; D&#x27; (2 inserted edge

        D&#x27; B2 (29-htm,31-qtm,26-stm) So that&#x27;s an improvement even to

        Sure I remember that one, Charles. I like both as you do because for
        these two I didn&#x27;t need any knowledge, even not about commutators.
        This approach is somewhat close to what Lars once named &quot;playing
        God&quot;. One exception from that notion was going through 2x2x3 stage.
        BTW, Lars, I haven&#x27;t seen you here for a while! Are you listening?

        Hey guys ... Well done Mirek, i didn&#x27;t get that far since i started
        from the end working backwards;-) I thought it was quite cool to insert
        a 10-move 3-cycle and have 6 moves cancelled. I really liked that. But
        ur insertions gave shorter solution :D Btw Mirek. Congratz with ur
        winning solution:-) Sometimes the key is not just a short block start.
        But having a block start where u have dealt with the rest of the cubies

        Mirek Strange that I didn&#x27;t see that one. Anyway, I can get an
        excuse from the fact that it was quite late. In a previous FMC I ended
        with a 6- move edge 5-cycle, so I probably thought I will find one here
        as well. Thanks for your solutions! Sebastian

        Hi everyone! Results for the 3-colour FMC are now out, congratulations
        to Cyril! Now we know why he suggested the idea in the first place ;)
        Only kidding :P Back to normality at midnight tonight, with the launch
        of FMC #81, a standard FMC. Try and get as many of the speedcubers as
        possible interested in FMC, now we have so many great players there are
        lots of people to learn from at least! In the future I want to make a
        series of webpages describing some FMC techniques, much like there are
        hundreds of speedcubing websites out there (including mine i know :P )
        But it would be nothing without input from you guys, so any input would
        be greatly appreciated. But this is something for the future, because at
        the moment I have to revise for my exams, which are in lessthan 1 months
        time! Good Luck with FMC #81 everyone! Dan :)

        Hi everyone, just to let you know FMC 81 is now open and ready for you
        to take part in. I had an interesting submission today from
        &quot;kociemba&quot; - I think it was from the man himself, showing that
        the 3-color cube was solvable in 13 moves! I will post details of this
        solve later next week, now I have to go to bed and i will be away all

        Hi, if you miss my solution of that 3-color cube ;-), here it is. First
        not too long was D B&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; F D&#x27; F&#x27; B&#x27;

        B&#x27; R2 B (22). I was too busy and missed submition deadline.
        It&#x27;s frustrating that we can&#x27;t find the optimal only 13 moves!
        Well, we have a little or no experience with this 3-color cube yet.

        lot of time to find the best solution I could ... What I especially like
        in the 3-colour cube is that you always feel lucky when you start
        building pairs and blocks (at least for the first moves) !! Btw Anssi, u
        can save one move to your solution by removing the last R2 :) Good luck
        for #81, I have a very busy week but will try to submit a solution

        Yes how come that could pass? Is it actually a full normal 6-color cube
        solve? I will check it, hehe. Ok, so it wasn&#x27;t. Furthermore the
        last move of a 3-color cube solution could be either clockwise or
        counterclockwise. Won&#x27;t matter at all ;-) Also from solved state of
        3-color cube (same color on opposite faces of coz) u can achieve what
        looks like 2 flipped edges in 9 moves only. Cheers! -Per > > Good luck

        Oh, yeea, my comment originally belonged to a different sequence. And it
        was late night,... I found obvious 9-moves for flipping edges. It&#x27;s
        the same idea as that for twisted corners. U R L&#x27; B&#x27; R2 B L
        R&#x27; U&#x27; and U R L&#x27; B&#x27; R2 B L R&#x27; U - flips edges
        in two positions. Like that sequence for corners, both edges are of the

        Hello! I transmitted my a new, better solution monday, I think. I found
        a 24-mover to FMC #81 but it has most have been lost in cyber-space. My
        new improved solution was the following: B D B&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27;
        F&#x27; R D2 F&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; F U B R2 U2 R2 U&#x27; R2 U&#x27;
        R2 U2 F B&#x27; with the following comment: Do F before scramble to
        better se Step 1 and an additional B&#x27; for Step 2. Lots of new stuff
        for me again. First time I do more than one move before scramble and
        this is also a new approach for me. Step 1: B D B&#x27; U&#x27; builds
        the first 2x2x1 block, R&#x27; F&#x27; R is the second block and D2
        F&#x27; D&#x27; is the third one. L&#x27; F finishes a pseudo-2x2x3 and
        U B is a pseudo-F2L without one corner. Step 2: After many hours and
        fruitless paths I found the perfect solution... (it is the inverse of
        the alg that I usually use for this situation when speedcubing) R2 U2 R2
        U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R2 U2 solves the whole cube and F B&#x27; solves the
        pseudoness. Do I have to say how exited I am? =D I first tried with U2
        R2 U R2 U R2 U2 R2 and tried to found a good insertion for the 3
        edge-cycle I was left with. When I found no good insertions I tried with
        the inverse (R2 U2 R2 U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R2 U2) and BINGO, the whole
        cube was solved. I guess it´s not possible to change the results any
        more but I just wanted to let you know the solution on Dan´s site is not
        the best I found. If it matters, I e-mailed Mirek about my new improved
        solution last friday but as I was not able to post it then (as I was as
        visiting my parents last weekend and e-mail Mirek just a few sec before
        I rushed to the train). I submitted it when I got back. I hope that
        Mirek can confirm that I actually did talk about a 24-mover last weekend
        to prove I´m not making it all up. Just wanted to let you all know I
        found a better soultion, beeing by far the best for me so far. Congrats

        Hi guys! A few weeks back we had a special fewest moves contest, on a
        3-color cube. This brought back old memories of a 2-color cube that i
        heard about in the early 80&#x27;s, but never had seen in real life. So
        while staying w Ron van Bruchem for the GCD i decided to build one. Ron
        kindly gave me a free cube and stickers to go with it :-) (I have
        uploaded some pictures in the files section of this group. Please check
        them out. The cube really looks cool IMHO.) Now to what&#x27;s
        interesting about it. How to solve that thing in as few moves as
        possible? I have (together with Dan) come up with a few possible
        strategies for solving it: 1-Do the middle layer band of 2-colored
        cubies first. Then finish off rest w Domino style sequences and or other
        simple 3-cycles. 2-Do the cross of top or bottom layer while also
        orienting centers (Dan&#x27;s idea, and it&#x27;s basically how i start
        supersolving a normal 6- color cube) Then set up c/e pairs and insert
        them. Completing f2l of coz gives u LL for free :-) 3-Petrus style.
        First setup 2x2x2 block, then extend to 2x2x3. Then rest w various
        simple algs. My best so far is 12-move solve with the first method. I
        guess short solutions are possible with either method. Any suggestions
        for other good methods? I would like to build a small databank of simple
        algs for this puzzle. Stuff like exchanging a few pieces between the
        white and blue layers. Flipping 2-colored edges (1, 2, 3 or 4).
        Orienting centers and so on. If anyone would like to contribute they can
        be post here in the group. I will post soon some of the algs i have
        found so far. I guess one would need to make a real such cube in order
        to play with it. The fmc-companion or other cube software i know
        won&#x27;t let u have cubies w multi-color tiles. This also makes it
        more interesting IMHO ;-) Due to the fact that u really have to make ur
        own real cube for this, i guess it&#x27;s not so easy to have a fmc
        challenge with this cube, unless we just run it here in the group :-)
        Kind regards, Per

        Hey! That applet is so cool :D Almost as cool as a real 2-color cube ...
        hehe ... As for my 12-move solution, that was for a random scramble that
        i didn&#x27;t write down. I did however compete w Dan on a &quot;real
        scramble&quot; that i still have written down, so here it is : B&#x27;

        My best solution for this scramble is 16 moves. It&#x27;s not strictly
        necessary, but i scrambled the cube with one color in the U-layer, the
        other in the D-layer (and the 2-colored cubies in the E-layer
        obviously). Im not gonna spoil ur fun by giving my solution yet ;-) Have

        individual with a fitness function, and use Darwin&#x27;s rules of
        selection, mutation and reproduction to evolve to better individuals at
        each &quot;generation&quot; and hopefully maximize the fitness function.
        How could this be related to FMC ? Actually the progs I developed for my
        work could easily be translated to this problem, and I chose to adapt
        Charlie&#x27;s and Sebastian&#x27;s approach to solve the cube : 1) Try
        to solve the 2x2x3 in Back-Down in fewest moves as possible 2) Try (1)
        for the 8 possible 2x2x3 rotations 3) Get into 2-gen group, using edges
        orientation check and corners position check (see Sebastian&#x27;s page)
        4) Solve the cube in the (F,U) group The question was  was it going to
        work ? I have no definitive answer, as no &quot;serious&quot; validation
        was made and there are still lots of parameters I can tune in the
        genetic alg, but I fed it with #82 FMC scramble and here is what I got :
        Scramble : D2 R&#x27; B2 D2 (L&#x27; F2 B&#x27; D2 F&#x27; )*3 U&#x27; B
        U2 B&#x27; F&#x27; (R F&#x27; B U D2 )*3 F U B&#x27; F&#x27; 1-2) I made
        a search of about 1 minute (computing time) for the 8 locations and the
        shortest solution found was xyL&#x27;B&#x27;L&#x27;URB&#x27;U2R2BR2F2L2
        (12 moves HTM). I&#x27;m quite certain it is possible to do better with
        longer search time  The genetic alg found 13-14-15 or 16 moves solutions
        for other locations (or no solution under 30 moves, which is not really
        smart !) 3) I decided not to use any table or known alg for this part,
        and let the alg find a 6-moves sequence to get into the 2-gen group :
        U2LF&#x27;L2U&#x27;L 4) The alg found in about 1 hour a 21 moves
        sequence to solve the 2- gen group, and reduced it to 17 after another
        hour search :
        F2U&#x27;F2U&#x27;F2U&#x27;FU&#x27;F2U&#x27;F&#x27;U&#x27;F2U&#x27;F2U&#x27;F
        So the total is 35 HTM  not bad for a first try in FMC challenge ;-) So
        now  why am I telling you all this ? I thought it would be great to use
        your experience to improve the performance of the algorithms. The
        question I am trying to answer is : &quot;what is the best mean to
        compute short, human-understandable solutions ?&quot; - One of the best
        approaches to find a short solution (probably the best one ?) is
        Kociemba&#x27;s alg, but as we all noticed there is no way one could
        figure out such a solution  - Lars&#x27; general method is good but
        there is a need to know quite a lot o LL algs to be really efficient in
        terms of metrics - Fridrich is definitely not a good FM method I
        don&#x27;t think any further discussion about this method is needed :) -
        Gilles&#x27; methods seems very interesting, but I doubt I could
        implement it easily in my program. The drawback of his approach is the
        STM optimization  but quite bad in HTM. Actually a &quot;standard&quot;
        solution (with &quot;normal&quot; opposite 1x2x3 blocks) should not be
        too hard to program  - &quot;solving all but some edges/corners&quot;
        should be possible to implement, I will think about that. The point is
        to define an efficient fitness function for that task. And the alg
        insertion promise tough problems to solve  - pseudo-moves is quite easy
        to figure out for a human solver, but apart from trying all 18 possible
        moves before the scramble (or 18*15 or 18*15*15 or ) I don&#x27;t see
        any efficient way to implement it in a genetic alg. - What about other
        ideas ? I think I will describe this project more precisely in a few
        weeks (fitness functions used, performance, ), when the beta version is
        more ready, and of course let you test the code on random scrambles if
        you&#x27;re interested ! The aim of this post is to have some feedback
        about other FMC techniques I could have missed, I strongly encourage you
        to reply :) At the beginning (and even now, but with a little less hope
        ) I thought genetic algs could offer an elegant alternative to
        kociemba&#x27;s &quot;brute force&quot; optimal solutions, without any
        table or known alg, but the whole cube solve seems to be a really tough
        problem for GA. Let the future answer this question ! Have fun FMC-ing !

        Hey Mirek! Yes i really was so lucky :-) After the 9 move 2x2x3 and
        extension to 14 moves with 5 corners left i just thought that i
        can&#x27;t really have had just luck to get there. There must be other
        moves leading to this. So i spent a long time trying to do all edges
        first while fishing corners. I guess i spent something like 4-5 hrs on
        that. I was kinda fed up with the really bad insertion scenario for my
        first 14 moves. I would have ended with 29 or possibly 28 moves. Saving
        only 2 moves, which is unusually bad. I have yet to come up with a
        combination of a lucky good start and a really lucky insertion scenario.
        Saving 5 moves is ur own estimated average save on inserting corner
        5-cycle. Last 4-5 normal FMC&#x27;s i have really spent ages on it,
        maybe 6-7 hr pr week. During 60 mins (or possibly 90) i can still only
        hope for a solution at about 30 moves or so :-) Did u also notice my 17
        moves with 2 twisted corners? And by the way Mirek, ur solution was
        better than mine in qtm. U are still unbeatable in terms of qtm ;-) Just
        like Gilles is normally really good in stm. I focus solely on htm cause
        that is where the rating is at the moment. I discussed briefly with Dan
        and it&#x27;s not impossible that in the future we will be rated on all
        metrics. And also that we might submit separately to them :-) Regards!
        -Per PS! Thinking about it it&#x27;s logical that a short first part
        will have worse insertion scenario than longer starts. Statistally u are
        less lucky to find good insertion points simple due to the shorter
        sequence u work with. Devil&#x27;s work indeed :D PPS! I seem to have
        drifted from my old original way of doing fmc, basically cross then fish
        c/e pairs then rest via block-style 2x2x2- >2x2x3 and finally to my
        current way of doing it by trying an edges first approach. All of those
        3 are actually based on ending up with corner insertion finish :-) Am i
        right in saying that ending up with corner insertions is generally more
        productive than ending up with edge insertions? Or is it simply that i
        have most experience with that :-? PPPS! It also seems that the past 2
        weeks the scrambles have been slightly easier than average. 4 experts
        for FMC #82 and 3 really short solutions (avg 23 moves) for FMC #83. >

        Hi Cyril! Interesting post. I know a little about gentic algorithms.
        Could u describe more how ur approach works. How do u evaluate good and
        bad &quot;species&quot;? More specifically how do u define fitness
        functions? And how do u perform crossover and mutation? Do u at all have
        some built-in &quot;cube-knowledge&quot; in ur code? U also mention some
        approaches solving cube effciently and &quot;human- like&quot;.
        Can&#x27;t see that u have listed the popular approach to FMC, namely
        blockstyle. For blockstyle beginning u have many alternative paths to
        take. After say 2x2x2 and 2x2x3 u can either: - do f2l, then rest by OLL
        + PLL (or replace OLL and PLL with an alg that leaves either corner or
        edge 3-cycle to be inserted ... here my planned but not realised
        alg-insertion program could be handy) - orient edges and fix corners so
        that u end up with 2-G finish ... u have already looked at 2-G using GA
        so this is maybe a very interesting path for u - do all edges and finish
        off with a bunch of corner cycle insertions - do all corners and finish
        with some edge-cycle insertions - do ZBf2l for easier LL - do f2l minus
        1 c/e pair, orient all corners, then rest Just to mention a few of the
        most common ones :-) Cheers! -Per > --- In

        Hi Fantastic. I have also been working on a genetic solver for a while
        now, in a deep secret underground factory, preparing for world
        domination. And I have come up with a different technique. I am
        connecting pairs of cubies and just optimize that. This is just a first
        step, and it appears to be a pretty devious problem to tackle. I hoped
        to just magically see a solved cube, but... not yet. My program is
        written in VBA. I will convert it to VB and then later maybe VB.NET (or
        even C or Java) for speed. A solved cube has 72 connected pairs. The
        program jumps pretty quick from a start of 9 pairs to say 20-30 pairs.
        That&#x27;s when it starts to slow down. 40-50 pairs is usually a
        solution with only 3 or 4 cubies incorrectly placed or oriented. My
        first solver was a python program, but that one was for the 2x2 and
        didn&#x27;t use the right search path , so it led to nothing. I am
        willing to share my code and work with others on a better solver, so
        when I have mine prepared I will post it to the group. If you like a
        copy, please email me. It&#x27;s a self-explaining Excel file with a
        cube view and a scramble and solve button. I really thing this kind of
        program could have a huge potential in looking for a good solution, and
        maybe even more human-readable than the brute force programs. bye

        I spent a weekend a few months back working on something similar. I came
        up with 3-4 more or less advanced metrics and tried to weigh them. It
        got pretty far, but never actually solved the cube. I&#x27;ll never
        finish it, so I&#x27;d be happy to work with others as well. /Lars On

        Hi! What exactly do u mean by a pair? Say u have a 2x2x3 block and no
        other pairs. How many pairs have u got? Is a center and an edge also a
        pair? Or is it always just corner/edge? Do u let a single cubie be
        assigned to several pairs. I guess u have to do that to reach 40-50

        Building blocks looks nice at first, but you quickly realize that a nice
        looking pre-PLL cube is still more than 10 moves away from the solution
        (travelling through positions with much fewer blocks)... Optimization
        functions are really hard to find. No surprise, that&#x27;s why
        it&#x27;s so difficult to solve a cube in 20 moves!! Cyril, tell us more

        Hi Charles! It&#x27;d be really interesting to see the program/code u
        have made for 4x4x4. Is it easily extendible to 5x5x5? Writing a
        separate center- cubie solver for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 shouldn&#x27;t be too
        complex i think :-) -Per PS! Of course some merge btw those 2 progs
        would be nice. If there are several ways to do the cage (corners+edges)
        then at least pick the one with best centers (generally means that as

        Hi Yes my mistake. I meant facelet, not cubie. And yes, it takes centers
        into account, since otherwise you&#x27;d end up with a pretty pattern

        Hey there ! Lots of comments, many thanks to all of you ! It seems that
        many of us have such a secret dream to become a new Kociemba :) I had a
        lot of fun when I noticed that within a few hours your comments were
        really coming from all parts of the world (France, USA, No-way, Santa
        Cruz, ) I don&#x27;t have much time and as told you these are only
        preliminary results, but here are the facts. The names after the titles
        are related to some of your recent posts and questions on that topic. 1)
        Blocks, facelets, pairs  (Michiel, Gilles) 2) The solving method I
        implemented (Per, Charles) 3) Fitness functions (Lars, Gilles, Per) 4)
        Other GA parameter (GA = genetic alg) (Per, Gilles) 1) I first tried the
        most obvious way : defining a cube as 54 facelets, optimizing the number
        of facelets matching a solved cube. He he he would say Per ! It is
        actually possible to converge to about 40 corrects &quot;stickers&quot;,
        but then impossible to solve the cube quickly, since all incorrect
        pieces are disseminated on all faces. So I decided to define kind of a
        &quot;cube entropy&quot;, using that definition : entropy = -(sum[CEp] +
        sum[ECep]) , where a CEp is a corner-edge pair (WHICH IS REALLY CORRECT,
        as opposite to Michiel&#x27;s more permissive definition, see his post),
        and ECep is an Edge-center pair. Entropy of a solve cube is 48, entropy
        of a random cube is  I actually never looked at, but probably around 3
        to 6 (?) So in terms of pairs a 2x2x3 is built with 16
        &quot;pairs&quot;. 2) Actually I used a block method. I wrote I
        implemented Charle&#x27;s and Sebastian&#x27;s way, perhaps I should
        have been more explicit : I look for a &quot;good&quot; 2x2x3 (I
        actually noted that there are 12 possibilities and not 8, as I wrote !),
        THEN jump into the 2-gen group THEN try to solve the cube in the 2-gen
        group. I will think about the other methods you mention after the 2x2x3,
        but I really want to keep my GA &quot;memory- free&quot;, without using
        any LL alg or built-in insertion technique. At the moment is really
        using only Darwin&#x27;s laws, and Darwin did not know a single
        Rubik&#x27;s cube alg ;-) 3) THIS IS THE POINT ! What do we all want to
        do when participating to FMC ? Eventually solve the cube  and minimize
        the number of moves. My fitness functions are no less than a
        mathematical expression of this fact : when evaluating a 30-moves
        individual of the population (say for the 2x2x3 stage) I use that
        procedure : Nmax = 0 Jmax = 0 For j = 1, 30 Do move j N = -entropy of
        the 2x2x3 location (between 0 and 16) If N>Nmax then Nmax = N and Jmax =
        j End for Fitness = 10Nmax-Jmax That is, at a given stage of the
        optimization process, I will allow longer solutions to be well rated, if
        they build more pairs than other shorter solutions. The factor 10 is
        purely empirical :) For getting into the 2-gen group I decided not to
        teach the alg any moves sequence. Starting with the 2x2x3 already built,
        I simply tell my GA that he can break it  only for a short time : the
        procedure is exactly the same, except that N = is2gen + 100is2x2x3,
        where is2gen is a Boolean variable telling if the edges are correctly
        oriented AND the corners correctly positioned to be solvable in the
        2-gen group (thanks to Sebastian for the elegant way to define it), and
        is2x2x3 is another Boolean variable to tell if the 2x2x3 is still alive.
        This fitness function makes sure the alg will not come up with a broken
        2x2x3 at the end of the stage, which could be problematic for the
        edges/corners checks. Then the 2-gen part is solved using N = -entropy,
        which still has the bad habit to converge in too many situations to a
        value of 42 instead of 48 2 twisted corners :( 4) Just to be short, I
        use : elitist GA (best individual of a generation is kept) / pop_size =
        51 / mutation prob = 0.05 / crossover prob = 0.8 / parents selection by
        rank (best parents are more likely to have children  do not try to
        compare with real life ) / each individual is a string of 30 integers A
        crossover is a gene exchange with crossover point at random location, a
        mutation is the replacement of a gene by another random one. I played
        with the idea of &quot;diseases&quot; in the population, and I kill the
        5 weakest individuals at each generation and replace them with random
        individuals. I&#x27;m probably not the first to have that idea  OK,
        that&#x27;s all folks, I just started reading the Da Vinci Code 2 days
        ago and I have to return to my book ! I will make a webpage on my site
        with all your suggestions and the state of advancement of this solver,
        and post my FORTRAN codes once they are more presentable (at the present
        time it is just a bunch of codes lines with tons of unnecessary comments
        !) Have fun, Cyril

        Hi, Per, I feel that it&#x27;s better to shortly respond to your
        elaborate message this late than not to respond. Yes I noticed to your
        17 moves solving to 2 twisted corners. I like that it&#x27;s the
        &quot;meson pattern&quot;. Keep producing the pattern with two oposite
        corners twisted one of which twisted either 120, 240, or 360 degrees
        under 20 moves. After doing it several times the chance getting solved
        cube under 20 moves is increasing quickly. That&#x27;s because only 8
        different such cases are the &quot;meson&quot;, others are/is the solved
        cube. :-) > Am i right in saying that ending up with > corner insertions
        is generally more productive than ending up with > edge insertions? Or
        is it simply that i have most experience with > that :-? The same with
        me - more experience with corner insertion. Average edge 3-cycle
        requires little bit more moves than 10, while less then 9 for corners.
        On the other hand, many differnt 10 moves can solve some edge positions
        and thefore more chances that more moves cancel out. I&#x27;d say that
        inserting edges is roughly 1 move longer than inserting corners. But
        maybe I&#x27;m wrong and it&#x27;s about the same length. Here I give an
        example of 10-move sequences solving the same edges. R U&#x27; R&#x27;

        What&#x27;s wrong with me? ;-) I noticed that my solutions somehow tend
        to be shorter in QTM than others&#x27;. My only explanation is that I
        always prefer fishing in QT sea first. Ehmmmmm,.. this is not a very
        good explanation, though. Mirek --- In

        That&#x27;s a golden oldy. I might still have my GA library in Pascal
        somewhere. My most fun GA used to be one that wrote a program for
        getting out of a maze. But the cube is more fascinating. BTW: how many
        times does it find a solution, and in how many generations? Does it need
        a lot of processing power? I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing it.

        Hi michiel, just some more comments : Of course I did not meant that
        &quot;my&quot; definition of a pair was more clever than
        &quot;yours&quot;, I just wanted to point out that in my case a
        Corner-Edge pair is a &quot;F2L corner-edge pair&quot;. I really think
        it is more efficient for converging to the solved 2x2x3 or whole cube. A
        gene is an integer representing a move : 0-5 = FURBDL, 6-11 = F2... L2,
        12-17 = F&#x27;...L&#x27;. An individual is therefore a sequence of 30
        moves. But the fitness function is not necessarly defined for the whole
        sequence, but at the best point (see the definition of Jmax in the
        pseudo-code I gave in my last post). That really makes a difference,
        IMH... I use a &quot;trim function&quot; to remove cancelling moves and
        add random moves at the end of a trimmed individual after crossover or
        mutation processes. To obtain the whole solution, I used about 3 hours
        computing time. About 12 x 10&#x27;000 generations (12 x 3 minutes) for
        finding a good 2x2x3, then about a minute to find a good way to get into
        2-gen group, then ~2 hours to solve the 2-gen group. I only tested a few
        scrambles, but it seems to be reliable (it found a nice 23 moves
        solution for #58 2-gen FMC) Cheers ! Cyril

        I&#x27;m very glad that I could contribute with something for this, but
        I still don&#x27;t understand the main idea of genetic algorithms. I
        won&#x27;t try to understand the FORTRAN code or any other code, I just
        want somebody to explain the extra-basic idea of the GA. Can it be
        mathematically represented as a function or as a composition of
        functions? How can it be associated with the cube moves? I know that
        this has been explained, but I would really like to understand this
        better. Thanks, Sebastian

        Hey! Ok im lazy ;-) So i do the URL solution. The ideas are quite well
        explained there. A short answer to ur most poignant question is that we
        don&#x27;t really have _a_ function or _composition_ of functions. We
        have now moved into the area of sub-symbolic artificial intelligence or
        sub-symbolic computing. The only function we have is the fitness
        function used to evaluate &quot;appropriateness&quot; or goodness of
        individual species. It&#x27;s not a good idea to keep or mutate only
        species that have a high fitness, ie are &quot;good&quot;. It&#x27;s
        usually smart to keep at least a few bad ones to randomly get lucky and
        avoid local minima ... OK that said. Here is the link to introduction to
        GA in general : http://cs.felk.cvut.cz/~xobitko/ga/ Cheers! -Per > ---

        Interesting. Those (* new) are completely new to me. What a surprise!!!
        Mirek P.S. It&#x27;s basically just one algorithm, we all know that,

        Hi! Yes it&#x27;s kinda last resort edge 3-cycle. If none of the easy

        > I just want somebody to explain the extra-basic idea of the GA. Can it
        be mathematically represented as a function or as a composition of >
        functions? How can it be associated with the cube moves? OK, here goes A
        genetic algorithm is not an algorithm in the common &#x27;programming
        language&#x27; at all. You cannot create everything with a GA. A GA is
        actually a complex &#x27;search engine&#x27;. It searches for solutions
        to a given problem by exploring a given search-space. Consider your DNA.
        It&#x27;s a string of codes that has evolved to describe a series of
        steps to recreate you. In the same way an FMC solution is a series of
        steps to recreate the solved cube state. We create the solution the same
        way your DNA is created: through evolution. A whole bunch of random
        algorithms (cube algs) is thrown into a boiling soup, where they get
        children (yes really) by combining the algs in some way or other. This
        is where the fitness function comes in. If the children are better
        suited to solve the cube, they survive and get children. If they are
        not, they die (it&#x27;s a tough world). Immediately the problem of this
        way of programming is apparent: how to decide which alg is better at
        solving the cube? The second problem is time. Some problems need to go
        through thousands or even millions of generations to get to a good
        enough solution. Actually the cube is not an easy problem for a GA
        (genetic algorithm). It has 43 trillion states, and with raw computing
        power you&#x27;d still have to search a long time to get to a solution.
        So if you can come up with a better fitness function you get a solution
        faster. I think my approach of a fitness function (counting facelet
        pairs) is more ideal in the sense that minimal cube knowledge is added.
        Even the 2x2 then 2x2x3 then RU group is cube knowledge. On the other
        end I havent found a solution yet, so, well ;-) Other more well known
        problems GA&#x27;s tackle are: - the traveling salesman problem, or
        &#x27;connecting all dots in graph&#x27; - optimizing processes -
        generating programs (yes a program is also a series of steps that can be
        coded in a string!) HTH Michiel

        I don&#x27;t know much about genetic programming, and I probably did
        that part mediocrily at best, but I have a bit more ambitious fitness
        function than what I&#x27;ve heard mentioned so far. By fitness function
        I mean something that measures how close a position is to the solved
        state. First consider the &quot;Connectivity Number&quot;, which
        I&#x27;ll define as the number of formed pairs. There are 24 such
        corner/edge pairs and 24 center/edge pairs. One move can only change
        either number by 4 or less. You can use this for
        &quot;backtracking&quot; problems (when you want to trace back n moves)
        since you know that when there are x moves left, each Connectivity
        Number has to be at least 24 - (4 * x). The advanced part is to take
        into account that unformed pairs can be more or less close to being
        formed. A corner/edge pair can be up to 3 moves from being joined, while
        a center/edge pair is at most 2 moves away. So for each corner/edge pair
        you have a number from 0 to 3, and for each center/edge pair a number
        from 0-2. In total that gives a corner number from 0 to 72 and a center
        number from 0 to 48. Having watched the program trying to solve using
        this metric it&#x27;s not hard to get more ideas on how to refine it. -

        Have you seen Tom&#x27;s cube contest? The three top solutions used
        Thistlethwaite, fourth place used large searches, but fifth place (David
        Barr&#x27;s solution) uses a human-like solution and averaged 35.03
        moves (though only half of the scrambles were really random, the others
        were scrambled with up to three moves only, but then again if the
        program uses a fixed order it might still take many moves even for such
        a scramble... don&#x27;t know, haven&#x27;t checked).

        But I think it&#x27;s still inefficient, because the problem comes from
        other global constraints. You can make a pair in 2 moves and another one
        in 3 moves, but 7 moves are required if you want both. When I was young,
        I was dreaming of such fitness functions. The more I cube, the more I

        Thanks for that. It&#x27;s much clearer now. Sebastian PS. I&#x27;ll
        soon try to find an easy way to see if the corners after 2x2x3 are
        correct. It shouldn&#x27;t use setup moves, or it should use at most one
        move. Then it would be more suitable for speedcubing too as the step now
        consists of first the setup moves, then the alg which very often undoes
        some of the setup moves. This is pretty annoying. But still, my fresh
        record of 23.49 seconds is made with my method: my previous records
        weren&#x27;t, they were usually pure Lars Petrus which is a bit faster.

        Years have passed, and HTM is still considered as the main metric in
        3x3x3 &quot;fewest-moves&quot; competitions. And I still can&#x27;t
        understand why. I changed my mind about several things, but in this
        case, it&#x27;s quite the opposite. The more I think about it, the more
        I think SQTM is the &quot;right&quot; metric. I discussed it with many
        people, it seems there&#x27;s just no valid reason why an inner slice
        move should count as 2 moves, and an outer slice move as only 1
        (&quot;...dexterity...&quot;, &quot;...Fridrich and Petrus don&#x27;t
        need slices...&quot; are no valid reasons). In addition to what has been
        said before (look at this thread:
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/13414
        ), please consider the following points. - When you study the very
        nature of the cube, you realize that a quarter of a turn and a half-turn
        are completely different. Parity is quite important in scientific
        cubing! - Some people who firmly believe that HTM is the right 3x3x3
        metric don&#x27;t have problem thinking with inner slices when they
        solve a 4x4x4. Even worse, the same people consider (lr&#x27;) or (Ll)
        as 1 move. - More 4x4x4 analogy. Try to solve a 3x3x3 following a
        &quot;centers-last&quot; technique, as you can do with a 4x4x4. A parity
        problem may appear. For example, apply
        (MUM&#x27;U2M&#x27;U2MUM&#x27;U2MU2M&#x27;U&#x27;M2U&#x27;D2M&#x27;D2M)&#x27;.
        All edges are correctly oriented, but UF and UB are swapped.
        There&#x27;s a parity constraint that links them to the centers. It
        looks quite simple and logical for a puzzle expert to fix this parity
        case with a M move, don&#x27;t you think? (inner slice, quarter-turn) -
        When you ask ACube to look for optimized solutions, you often get many
        sequences with about the same QTM length, and a few that can be much
        shorter thanks to HTM. These ones don&#x27;t necessarily look more
        clever, they seem to be lucky optimizations. It&#x27;s easier to
        understand a 7-move HTM &quot;Sune&quot; (RUR&#x27;URU2R&#x27;) when you
        write it (RUR&#x27;URU&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;), or (RU) [R&#x27;, U]
        (RU)&#x27;. I&#x27;m not saying that all solutions should be &quot;human
        readable&quot; and lucky optimizations forbidden. But it gives me the
        intuition that the natural language of the cube is Q(S)TM :-) - If you
        think that using inner slices is unfair because 6 moves are enough to
        solve a 3x3x3 cube, one of my answers could be: 6 moves is overkill, 4
        are enough, L/M/R/U ;-) - Some corners-first solvers never or rarely
        tried fewest-moves challenges. Of course! Imagine you being ranked
        &quot;beginner&quot; when you found a rather nice solve (I remember the
        day I found a really clever solve, the kind of solves that make you
        proud, in 24 STM and... 31 HTM!...). For them, it&#x27;s anti-slicers
        discrimination. As a consequence, I imagine that most of you who read
        this post are H/Q-TM cubers (strong bias?). That&#x27;s not a problem,
        but another sad consequence is that noone tries to optimize
        slice-oriented solving methods. That&#x27;s not a reason why (S)QTM
        would be a more logical metric, but se below... ************** READ
        CAREFULLY ************** - Because there are no &quot;slice
        experts&quot; here, we don&#x27;t even know if counting in (S)QTM would
        be a huge/slight advantage for them, or no advantage at all. It&#x27;s
        clear that beginners do have an advantage, finding a sub-50 STM solution
        is quite easy. But believe me when I say that sub-30 STM is much much
        more difficult. Important too: Even if you think with outer-slice turns
        only, you often get 1/2-move shorter STM solutions. Remember
        Sebastian&#x27;s fantastic 19-moves solve? Mirek, Per, Charles, Lars and
        the crowd, I want to hear your opinion about this. Convince me, show me
        that with your science of optimization you can get sub-20 STM solutions
        every week. Please! **************** Thanks :-) **************** Gilles.

        Hey Gilles! I do agree with all that u have written. But i just accept
        that htm is the metric we are currently rated by. So that&#x27;s the one
        i try to optimise. When doing say corner 3-cycle insertions it&#x27;s
        sometime possible to insert one so that u cancel moves in STM, but since
        the rating is in htm i always look for insertions that will cancel out
        in htm. One could say im a coward but im just being pragmatic about it.
        I think it would be fair to be able to submit to all our 4 metrics and
        be rated individually on each of them. Then a few practical problems
        might arise. Must we really submit same solution 4 times (one for each
        metric) if we have only worked out 1 solution? And if u only submit in 1
        metric does that mean u don&#x27;t want to be rated in the other
        metrics. Or does it also mean u don&#x27;t want to be listed for the
        other metrics in the result list(s)? All this will create lots of extra
        work for Dan, since it&#x27;s not fully automated yet. He still compiles
        results and generates ratings manually to a large extent ... I have no
        proof but i guess that it&#x27;s much harder always hit sub 20 in stm
        than it is to be expert every week in htm. I don&#x27;t really have a
        science for optimisation. Im good at the few tricks i use to optimise
        htm. Im good at inserting algs at the end of a sequence reaching a
        partially incomplete solve. Im good at making blocks, and im getting
        fairly good at doing all edges first. None of this makes me an overall
        optimization expert. Im still 6-10 moves behind what Cube Explorer or
        other optimal solvers would find :-) Htm metric is most widely used due
        to following factors : - The common element of all notations widely used
        are the FRBLUD face turns. The rest the possible moves be it inner
        slices or fingertrick 2-layer turns vary from notation to notation -
        It&#x27;s somewhat elegant to say that what u have is the turns of the 6
        axis attached to the core of the cube, and that inner slice moves are
        best described as 2 outer slice turns. This way will always keep the
        &quot;cube-orientation&quot; so to speak. (This does break down for
        larger cubes of even size, in fact also for the 2x2x2). So i guess one
        could im both pragmatic and cynical just focusing on optimising htm when
        there are 3 other metrics. I do admit it&#x27;s almost solely cause
        that&#x27;s the only one currently rated. But also cause i have done
        fewest moves (normal and supercube) since early- mid 80&#x27;s. And i
        always always used to count in htm. Conceptually, in terms of cubie
        permutations on cubes, it&#x27;s most logical to count in sqtm. It just
        does not have a historical consensus to it. For historical reasons we
        also have the MES and even worse the xyz. All of these can be replaced
        with better notation (in my opinion). Rc for x (c for cube rotation)
        R&#x27;m for M (m for middle slice on that axis) And so on and on ... I
        guess this is enough words on these topics for now ;-) -Per > --- In

        This is a very interesting question IMHO. I´m very new to FMC (I still
        have no permanent rating but Dan still puts the &quot;provisional&quot;
        after my rating ;) so I´ll try to give a beginners look at the question.
        As already stated RLUDFB are the usual abbreveritons used, this gives
        one reason to using HTM (still does not explain why HTM is more
        acceptable than QTM). The big reason for using HTM -mark that this in
        only my opinion- as the rating metric is FMC started using this metric
        and has used it ever since. This means most people who participate on a
        regular basis use this metric as &quot;first&quot; metric to get the
        best possible rating. I don´t see that as a good reason for using HTM as
        rating metric but I´m sure that fact plays a big role in it. When I look
        for FMC solutions I mostly look at HTM and secondly on QTM. I don´t know
        why, but I do. BUT (!) I do note, especially when inserting algs, that
        these two solutions are equally long in HTM (and QTM) but the
        first/second one is shorter in STM. In a case like that I always chose
        the solution shorter in STM. One reason I have for using HTM is that it
        is a lot easier for me to visualize and understand solution using only
        RLUDFB-notation. This could be either because the fact I´m new in to FMC
        or that I in speedcubing use a method not using slice-moves (Petrus). I
        do understand your point that STM would be the &quot;best&quot; metric
        to use as primary metric as it gives the shortest solutions and adds new
        possibilites for FMC (edge-cycles would be a lot more attractive if STM
        was considered first metric). In my opinion HTM give an unfair handicap
        for people used to using slice moves. What I´m trying to say is that old
        habits die hard and it&#x27;s not easy to get improvments accpeted. The
        only *good* reason for using HTM is as Per said: you preserve cube
        rotation. Another point Per brough up is that the system is not
        automated and Dan does a lot of work by hand. I would, however, like to
        be able to submit soultions for each metric. I think this would be quite
        easy to implement with a few check boxes indicating which metrics that
        solutions is meant for (to clear out the problems Per mentioned). But it
        would be most inconsiderent (towards Dan, who is making an excellent
        job) to ask for such a system before the soultion-to-result process is
        automated. The few thoughts I had became a very long post. I hope you
        were able to follow through and that I made sence. Finally I´d like to
        say that if I could chose two parallel ratings, one in HTM and one in
        SHTM, would be the best. But as long as only one metric is rated I´d
        perfer HTM (not because it&#x27;s the right metric but because I&#x27;m
        used to it). Mikael PS. Please take into consideration that Finland just
        lost on penalty shots in ice-hockey and the few drinks I took to cheer
        myself up could cloud my mind ;)

        Hi, I see this new/old hot topic! All the HTM race started with the
        Thistlewaite algorithm in about 1981. The preference for HTM has been
        strengthen by Kociemba&#x27;s Cube Explorer. This face-turn metric is
        the best for these algorithms to compete in. And it looks better when
        you say that it&#x27;s possible to solve the cube always in 20 moves or
        less (HTM) than saying ..in 24 moves or less (QTM). (BTW, no proof yet.)
        Well, SQTM looks even better, but .. too late to switch to. BTW, is
        (S)QTM just another name for SQTM? Actually I had been dissapointed to
        know that HTM was widely used instead of QTM. ZZ is not happy as far as
        I know, too. Hey, Zb. Zb. we (=I) need you here for this disscussion!
        Some arguments Gilles gave are good for QTM as well. I also argue that
        QTM is the only metric that measures the best how the cube inner
        mechanism ages during use. OK, now I think that everybody believes that
        prefering HTM (counting number of face moves) was not invented to harm
        cubists doing corners first. However, the fact is, it is discriminating
        them. As Gilles pointed out, two main places have something to do with
        TM. First, WCA rules. I don&#x27;t see an easy way out here. We cannot
        have 3 or 4 different metrics for live competitions. Thinking about the
        two mainstreams - people who prefer SQTM and those prefering HTM - the
        easiest compromise is to count in QTM. The numbers are not looking as
        cool (my first paragraph), QTM gives more equal chances to both
        corner-first solvers and F2L solvers, however. Second, we have (thanks
        to Dan H) FMC. We agree that the best of all would be possibility to
        submit more than one solution, one for each metric. This brings one
        drawback - Dan may will give up sorting all the solutions and shut the
        FMC at all being fed up with the work. Here comes my suggestion:
        Let&#x27;s switch to SQTM or QTM as the main metric (I vote for SQTM!)
        until Dan has an automated sorting tool for all metrics. Also calculate
        rating according that ..TM. We would see more of corner-first solutions
        and also more 3-edge-cycles insertions. I think this can still be a good
        competition. Mirek --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        Wow, so much hot debate on the forum lately :) I have been following
        closely, but have not had much chance to respond recently because of
        exams. But I&#x27;m almost a free man now :) Submitting different
        solutions for different metrics would be ok in practice, but how many
        people would actually bother to submit 4 different solutions? I feel if
        this was the case, the competition would become much more diluted, and
        there would be few competitors taking part in all the competitions.
        Logistically, I don&#x27;t think it would be that difficult to process 4
        different solutions, there would be a checkbox on the submission form
        which would turn on a flag on the email I receive to indicate which
        metric it is. A little program could be made to open up the email,
        extract the relevant data, and perhaps even use RubikPlayer to validate
        the solution and count the number of moves. The output would then be the
        HTML which I could copy and paste into the xml file. There is no
        &quot;main metric&quot; now, since separate results are now dynamically
        created and posted for all 4 metrics. Ratings could be calculated in
        each metric in exactly the same way as for HTM, and then a conversion
        factor could be decided upon to scale all the ratings to a similar
        range. So we/I (well it was me actually) decided that 27 moves was the
        worst &quot;Expert solution&quot; you could have. 6 27&#x27;s in a row,
        all taking first place, would give a rating of 741. So then if we found
        the top 15% of all solutions were Expert in HTM, and we made the top 15%
        solution in QTM Expert also. Imagine that this makes the Expert boundary
        for QTM 32 moves. 6 first place solutions at 32 moves gives a rating of
        625. So the conversion factor would be to multiply by 741/625, to give
        the QTM Rating. Again, this wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to implement, but
        at the moment it makes 4 times more work for me. So I would have to have
        a think on that to see what tools I need to make the process of
        calculating ratings more efficient. One thing I can do soon, is to work
        out reasonable boundaries for Expert, Advanced, Intermediate, and
        Beginner for all 4 metrics, and then post them here, to see what the
        consensus is. I am no programmer, but I know a lot of you are really
        good programmers, so with your help, I am sure that we can continue to
        improve the FMC by allowing more work to be done in the same time frame.
        I do believe however, that whichever metric the WCA counts in official
        competitions, should be the most important metric in FMC. So it&#x27;s
        up to us to lobby the WCA to get them to change the rules to how we
        would like. But the WCA only regards the FMC as a side event, and if it
        had its way, would not include it in official competitions, indeed only
        the Europeans and the Worlds seem to have these competitions, and
        occasionally Caltech. I don&#x27;t think the timeframe is a problem,
        because whereas we have a week to make a solution, in a competition you
        would only have 90 minutes for example. This is analagous to speedcubers
        at home doing averages of 12, but in a competition doing averages of 5.
        But we must all count in the same metric, and we must all be happy with
        that metric when we as the WCA to change the rules, because I don&#x27;t
        think the guys at the WCA would appreciate lots of people telling them
        lots of different things, and in the end they would take matters into
        their own hands. And as speedcubers, I think it is unlikely that they
        would make the best decision. Personally I think HTM as a main metric is
        dead in the water, not many people like it, and people are beginning to
        come round to the idea that something like SQTM is a much better metric,
        for lots of reasons as described in previous posts. So we have to make a
        choice between 3 metrics, and personally I vote for SQTM. The numbers
        are much less &quot;cool&quot;, but i suppose it levels out the playing
        field somewhat. As Mirek said, we would most likely see a bigger variety
        of solutions if this were the case. And if this were the official
        competition metric, it would be more healthy for competition. If someone
        got a 21 in HTM, they would know that someone has to get 20 or under to
        win. However, this is less likely in SQTM, if someone were to manage a
        32 in SQTM, while still good, there&#x27;s still a bigger possibility
        that someone has 31 or less. What a change of opinion from a year or so
        ago ;) Just my thoughts, I hope that the FMC is a competition which will
        continue to grow in popularity every week :) Dan :) ----- Original

        Hi friends, At the moment I consider fewest moves a side event. But do
        not forget that we had the fewest moves final on stage during Euro 2004.
        Media do like the fewest moves event, probably because it is for the
        most brainy guys. The smartest of the fastest. :-) I think the question
        is: &quot;what is scientifically the best?&quot; or &quot;what is
        entertaining yet a good competition?. Which in my opinion is SQTM or
        HTM. In that case STM may be the best choice in the middle. About the
        time: I think that 1 cube is not enough to decide a winner. So we have
        to have at least two cubes for a big championship. Then we have the
        choice between one time period for two cubes or two shorter time periods
        for two single cubes. I prefer to have two single cube rounds, with 4
        people on stage in the final. Since we are getting more events, we can
        only have 60 minutes stage time. This said I personally think a 60
        minute STM event would be the best. It is relatively short and outsiders
        understand STM. Outsiders do not understand QTM: a move is a move.
        Anyway, if only the community could decide and after that stop
        discussing. :-) Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message ----- From:

        Hello everybody! I just checked the results for this week and noticed
        that the four of us finishing after Per all have the same start. We all
        have the exact same 2x2x2 block and the following 2x2x1 aswell. This is
        no big surpise as that was the only obvious start when you go for
        blocks. Cyril and myself have all 17 moves (!) before insertions exactly
        the same, Charles has 11 moves incommon and also Alexander has the same
        7 first moves. Too bad Cyril couldn&#x27;t find any good insertions,
        then we might have had two identical solutions for the first time.
        Congrats to Per for the winning solution (once again)! Good luck with
        this weeks challange, Mikael

        However, the fact is, it is discriminating them. Another belief maybe
        ;-) I have seen no evidence that the half turn metric discriminates
        against corners first cubists. As a metric that compares the lengths of
        different solutions, HTM does remarkably well. The top layer methods and
        the top corner methods for speedcubing both measure at around 50-55
        moves in HTM. If you use STM, the corner methods come out in front, at
        about 45 moves which clearly does not make a fair comparison with layer
        methods. I think the same comparison can be made for fewest moves
        methods. Also, I have not seen any evidence that QTM discriminates
        against slicers. Surely SQTM would give the advantage to the slicers.
        For example, most slice moves *are* quarter slice moves and so SQTM will
        measure them as efficiently as STM. And half slice moves are measured as
        two moves, so SQTM will measure them as efficiently as HTM. Now for the
        poor blockers, SQTM will only be as good as QTM, since they do not uses
        slices (except by accident). I think slice turns and half turns are fine
        ways to cube, but the question is, which metric makes a good comparison
        of different solutions? It seems to me that the answer is HTM. Ryan

        Hi, based on your and other arguments, it seems to me that the answer is
        QTM. But few people argue for QTM because nobody feels to have an
        advantage in QTM. I don&#x27;t care much what TM we decide. The most
        important is that nobody should feel much handicapped. Either SQTM or

        Not that I have strong objections to change to something else, but I
        thought I&#x27;d explain why I prefer HTM. I understand the mathematical
        arguments for QTM, but to me cubing has always been something you do
        with your hands. So HTM is the obvious one for me. Like Ron put it, a
        move is a move. Also I&#x27;ve always seen the cube as a frame of six
        centers that corners and edges move around. From that perspective, a
        slice move is clearly two moves. &quot;A move is a move&quot; is a bit
        ambiguous here, since I have seen people do slice moves as one movement,
        but in my hands it is always two distinct moves. There *are* other
        possible metrics than the 4 being discussed. Such as the Snyder metric,
        where you count an anti-slice as a single move as well, since it can be
        performed in a single motion. Another metric would be to take &quot;a
        move is a move&quot; to it&#x27;s extreme, and count anything that can
        be performed as one fluid motion as a move. Seen that way I do a Sune in
        3 moves. Maybe we&#x27;d have to send in the solutions as videos.
        Actually that could be a fun &quot;special FMC&quot; we could do some
        time! - - - - - - - - - - - - &quot;They say the grass is greener on the

        I&#x27;m for QTM. If you see a move as a certain amount of friction
        between the centre axle and the centre piece, then a 180 degree move
        would be twice as long as a 90 degree move, so it&#x27;s reasonable to
        see it as two moves. If you do a 90 degree slice move, friction appears
        in two centre axles, so this one too is 2 moves. A 180 degree slice move
        would be 4 moves, because it takes 4 times as much energy to perform as
        a 90 degree outer layer move. QTM also respects parity: this has been
        discussed before. And SQTM does not respect parity, which is another
        reason why I prefer QTM. Sebastian

        a piece from the cube (provided it&#x27;s loose enough so that you can

        arguments why this metric is better than that one. There are
        anti-examples for many of them... (e.g. pointing to the mechanics as
        6-arm spider determining orientation... I can imagine other viable cube
        designs... or counting one turn if you are able to do it as one
        movement... some cubers can do extremely complex movements...) Hey, we
        are talking about FMC here! What should we use to determine one turn?
        Well, I think that our brain should be used. However everyone here
        thinks of one turn in other way ... and we are back at the beginning...
        So let&#x27;s do other thing: QTM: action of one turn - 4E affected
        (cycled), 4C affected (cycled) HTM: as QTM or 4E (swapping 2 pairs) and
        4C (swapping 2 pairs) SQTM: as QTM or 4E (cycled) and 4Centers (cycled)
        STM: as SQTM or HTM or 4E (2-swap) and 4Centers (2-swap) For each metric
        all cycles and swaps are done in one layer only... Why should centers be
        ignored when thinking about a turn? The advantage of S(Q)TM is that you
        can move edges (plus centers) without corners... It can bring some new
        possibilities to the FMC for any method not just Centers-first ...
        Imagine those 3 (or more) edge cycles/swaps added to the set of tricks
        you can use to improve any solution and requires better understanding
        (not different!) of the cube. Is this too unacceptable? Some thoughts
        that can be skipped: { The fact that the speedcubing methods optimized
        for HTM seem to be longer than e.g. corners-first ones in not a good
        argument to say that this would be advantage in FMC competition if STM
        was used... Look at methods achieving less than 50 slice turns (there
        are only few of those anyway) they are quite sophisticated and really
        utilize the slice turns to move edges without corners. It is quite
        accidental that it can be used even in speedcubing (IMHO). There was no
        effort put to other methods to optimize them to STM. In addition FMC is
        a different area and uses tricks that can utilize slice turns well. } I
        am really for a slice turn counted as one turn. My opinion is that SQTM
        would be too restrictive because it forces cubers used to FTM to use
        only part of their abilities and tricks (e.g. some cancelations). STM
        enables for new tricks to be investigated and used that may be a nice
        new challenge for any FMCr using any system. Moreover, it does make the
        FMC competitions attractive for cubers using other methods (e.g.
        corners-first like), bacause it is really a pain for me to count 2 turns
        each time I cycle 4 edges + 4 centers (i.e. doing a slice turn) in a
        layer and count only 1 turn when 4 edges + 4 corners are cycled in a
        layer... especially after a good beginning... My opimion on various
        merics is: QTM and HTM are good for computers QTM and SQTM are good for
        &quot;mathematical&quot; solving STM is good for official FMC
        competitions :)) BTW: for 4x4x4 and bigger cubes it would be really hard
        to find an argument for using &quot;non-slice&quot; metric!! Josef

        Many thanks Per ! I had been looking for good insertions after these 17
        moves for such a long time ! I found a 3-cycle with 2 moves cancelling,
        but could not find any insertion to solve the 3 remaining corners after
        that. I didn&#x27;t underestimate the Force ... I was just too
        disappointed and I thought I should not spend one more hour to save 2-3
        moves :) This would have been my first expert solution ... too bad !!
        BTW ... I just checked ... U should have a look at Mikael&#x27;s
        solution ! Well, he swapped 2 moves (U D2) but he found exactly that
        solution ;-) Actually I tried commutators and (R F&#x27; L&#x27; F
        R&#x27; F&#x27; L F)-like cycles, but not those from the form of R F
        L&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F L F&#x27;. That&#x27;s why I missed these
        insertions I presume. For FMC #100, I totally agree with the idea of
        teams ! We could imagine to make geographical teams ?! Well ... Sweden
        and USA would be better represented than Switzerland I guess, but what
        about this idea? Cheers ! Cyril --- In

        Oh Per! As I already said I and Cyril had the exact same 16+1 moves and
        the insertions algs you gave (even though they aren&#x27;t exactly the
        same ones I used) produce the same solution I posted ;) Did you also
        find the insertion cancelling 4 moves? Unfortunately the second
        insertion didn&#x27;t cancel any moves so the above insertions gave the

        That&#x27;s really really great, Cyril. I&#x27;m glad that you run it

        not at my computer, and I&#x27;ll be back home a week from now, so I
        will probably catch the program on a more advanced phase. I did

        This one is much easier to do than the one I currently use, and even in
        its most simplified version it uses less setup moves. But I don&#x27;t

        Hi all! In order to agree on what is the best metric (a definition of
        &quot;move&quot;), I think we should stay focused on mathematical
        properties (groups...), and geometrical symetry and simplicity (for
        example, a very simple group generated by &lt;L,R,U,D,F,B> is more than
        enough, but there&#x27;s no reason to forbid L&#x27; if L is allowed).
        We should avoid to consider things that have little to do with the art
        of fewest-moves solving. I&#x27;m thinking about dexterity for example,
        or if the metric gives an advantage to people using a certain kind of
        methods, or historical reasons, or computer solving, etc. In my opinion
        there&#x27;s no link between the two questions that must be answered: 1)
        Inner slice moves. Are they really &quot;moves&quot; ? - People seem to
        agree that an inner slice move should count as 1 when solving big cubes
        (4x4x4, 5x5x5.... and soon(?) Olympic cubes). A 3x3x3 IS A (SMALL) BIG
        CUBE. Of course you can solve it without moving the centers (or use a
        computer solver that won&#x27;t even think about it). But should we a
        have special metric for every kind of cubes? - I still can&#x27;t see
        why an inner slice move should be considered as complex. Geometrically
        speaking (or should I say visually?), moving left, center or right slice
        has the same complexity. If you get lost as soon as you move the
        centers, you&#x27;re in trouble because of your solving method and
        mental model, because it&#x27;s only a slice with 9 cubies in it (or
        less if you forget the hidden one ;-) ) that rotates around the same
        axis. Because an inner slice move do not change any corner slot (3*8
        configurations), it&#x27;s even more simple than a face move. When I
        talked about discrimation, it was not only because some people were
        angry with their bad ranking (if their method sucks, they just should
        change), but because the rule looks at least very arbitrary. 2) Quarter
        (*QTM) or Half (*HTM) ? If I wanted to fight for the metric that gives
        me the best results, I would have proposed *HTM! There are 2 reasons why
        I think *QTM is the right choice: - Because R and R2 have different
        effects on the parity signature of a cube configuration, I have problems
        putting the same label on them. - R2 is clearly based on RR or
        R&#x27;R&#x27;. It&#x27;s a complex move. You can object that
        R&#x27;==RRR, but remember what I said about symetry. Instead of writing
        multiple messages, let&#x27;s gather the pros/cons in a single document.
        We&#x27;ll try to keep only the interesting points and discuss them.
        Gilles. Now for a few comments, sorry if your ideas are considered out
        of their original context. I fear you&#x27;ll all hate me ;-) Per:
        &quot;I have no proof but i guess that it&#x27;s much harder always hit
        sub 20 in stm than it is to be expert every week in htm.&quot; Please
        find only one, you&#x27;ll make me happy :-) Indeed we have no proof.
        Last year, I was dreaming of a STM Cube Explorer that would at least
        show us the theoretical differences between HTM and STM. I can
        understand HTM cubers who fear the hordes of STM invaders, but if
        you&#x27;ve understood my previous message, I suspect the gap is not
        wide. Mirek: &quot;I also argue that QTM is the only metric that
        measures the best how the cube inner mechanism ages during use.&quot; I
        think, it&#x27;s the second time I can read this idea here. On the first
        time, I thought it was a joke. :-) We&#x27;re on the
        fewestmoveschallenge group, it&#x27;s not Twisty forum! The science of
        optimized cube solving is the same with a virtual cube. Mirek: &quot;We
        cannot have 3 or 4 different metrics for live competitions. Thinking
        about the two mainstreams - people who prefer SQTM and those prefering
        HTM - the easiest compromise is to count in QTM. The numbers are not
        looking as cool (my first paragraph), QTM gives more equal chances to
        both corner-first solvers and F2L solvers, however.&quot; Yes, only one
        metric, keep it simple. But QTM is not a compromise between SQTM and
        HTM, and I was hoping for a decision based on geometrical properties,
        not a compromise. Ron: &quot;About the time: I think that 1 cube is not
        enough to decide a winner. So we have to have at least two cubes for a
        big championship.&quot; Very interesting question! Let&#x27;s open a
        different thread. Ron: &quot;Outsiders do not understand QTM: a move is
        a move.&quot; I was thinking exactly the opposite. They do understand
        *QTM, because &quot;a move is a move (not two)&quot;! If by turning your
        hand PI/4 further you can make 2 moves in one, it&#x27;s nice, but
        don&#x27;t forget that speecubers can do much more sophisticated
        fingertricks. When I show beginners how you can solve a cube in less
        than 50 moves, they always object because I count half-turns as 1 move.
        Others? Ron: &quot;Anyway, if only the community could decide and after
        that stop discussing. :-)&quot; The community is still discussing, I
        think the WCA can sleep quietly for a few nights :-) Ryan: &quot;I have
        seen no evidence that the half turn metric discriminates against corners
        first cubists. As a metric that compares the lengths of different
        solutions, HTM does remarkably well. The top layer methods and the top
        corner methods for speedcubing both measure at around 50-55 moves in
        HTM. If you use STM, the corner methods come out in front, at about 45
        moves which clearly does not make a fair comparison with layer methods.
        I think the same comparison can be made for fewest moves
        methods...&quot; You&#x27;re perfectly right, HTM does a good job in
        comparing speedcubing methods (in my opinion QTM is even better). But I
        suspect it&#x27;s significantly different for fewest moves. Maybe
        we&#x27;ll never know. Your message makes me uncomfortable. As I said,
        it should not be all about giving &quot;equal&quot; chances to every
        technique, because it&#x27;s not possible. Mirek: &quot;Based on your
        and other arguments, it seems to me that the answer is QTM. But few
        people argue for QTM because nobody feels to have an advantage in QTM.
        Nobody? Really? &quot;I noticed that my solutions somehow tend to be
        shorter in QTM than others&#x27;.&quot; -- Mirek, 2005 :-))) Sebastian:
        &quot;I&#x27;m for QTM. If you see a move as a certain amount of
        friction between the centre axle and the centre piece, then a 180 degree
        move would be twice as long as a 90 degree move, so it&#x27;s reasonable
        to see it as two moves. If you do a 90 degree slice move, friction
        appears in two centre axles, so this one too is 2 moves. A 180 degree
        slice move would be 4 moves, because it takes 4 times as much energy to
        perform as a 90 degree outer layer move.&quot; ...Twisty forum?..
        Sebastian: &quot;And SQTM does not respect parity, which is another
        reason why I prefer QTM.&quot; Oh, that&#x27;s interesting, it seems we
        don&#x27;t see parity the same way. Of course, you need to consider
        centers when computing parity (think 4x4x4). Josef: &quot;There are lots
        of various arguments why this metric is better than that one. There are
        anti-examples for many of them... (e.g. pointing to the mechanics as
        6-arm spider determining orientation... I can imagine other viable cube
        designs... or counting one turn if you are able to do it as one
        movement... some cubers can do extremely complex movements...) Hey, we
        are talking about FMC here! What should we use to determine one turn?
        Well, I think that our brain should be used. However everyone here
        thinks of one turn in other way ... and we are back at the
        beginning...&quot; You&#x27;re so right! Josef: &quot;Moreover, it does
        make the FMC competitions attractive for cubers using other methods
        (e.g. corners-first like), because it is really a pain for me to count 2
        turns each time I cycle 4 edges + 4 centers (i.e. doing a slice turn) in
        a layer and count only 1 turn when 4 edges + 4 corners are cycled in a
        layer... especially after a good beginning...&quot; That&#x27;s a not a
        valid reason! ;-)

        I agree, if M changes the parity, a cube rotation will change it too.
        It&#x27;s too unnatural, even to me. It turns out that parity laws are
        an anti-slice argument. Nice, I like to be wrong, I may soon become a

        Hey! No no no no. To say that a cube turn changes parity is meaningless!
        A cube turn is if u like a change of reference. Thats all! Normally when
        calculating number of positions on an even size regular cube (2x2x2 or
        4x4x4 etc) one fixes one corner, since there are no centers that can
        naturally be fixed. If u allow a cube turn to be a change of parity
        it&#x27;s like disqualifying half of all possible solutions in a
        competition. Would u consider a cube out of parity as solved? OK
        consider this : the 4x4x4 was scrambled with white top, blue front and
        orange right. The contestant solve s the cube and puts it down with
        white up, orange front and green right. Is the cube solved or not?
        It&#x27;s out of parity wrt state before scrambling!!! Anyone would
        agree that this is meaningless. So please please never say that a
        physical turn of the cube (or any puzzle) is a change of parity.
        It&#x27;s just a change of reference. And when not keeping the reference
        it&#x27;s pointless to even talk about parity ;-) Cheers! -Per > --- In

        I like what you said, Charles. Anyway, I think QTM is quite neutral, not
        giving the most common solving systems much advantage over the other
        (which is why this disscussion came up here, isn&#x27;t it?). Adopting
        QTM as the basic metric could bring hopefully more diversity to FMC,
        too. QTM preserves parity in this sense: all solutions have either odd
        or even number of moves. If majority cannot agree on QTM (or SQTM?),
        then the only right way is to let everybody choose their own metric (not
        more than 4 different we already have, pleeeeease) in (near?) future.

        It is &quot;out of parity&quot; (using a particular definition of
        parity), but solved, according to the usual criterion (see above). >
        Anyone would agree that this is meaningless. Well, the parity appears to
        be an irrelevance here, so I can&#x27;t say that I strongly agree or
        disagree. Nevertheless, I would still like to know why people feel that
        parity is relevant to the metrics debate. The &quot;parity&quot; of a
        cube state is just one &quot;bit&quot; of information about it. Sure,
        this parity (of the corner or edge permutation now) changes when you
        make a quarter turn, but what of that? It is not the only effect of a
        quarter turn... Mike

        do care a little bit about parity, just like in speedsolving I care
        about fast execution, but you said yourself we should avoid non-FMC
        concerns. I like STM because when I invent algorithms I think that way.
        For example, the PLL where I swap opposite edges I&#x27;d *think* about
        it like this: 1) Bring two down (M2) 2) Swap them there (D2) 3) Brign
        them up again (M2) 4) Get the other pair in place (U) 5) Bring two down
        (M2) 6) Swap them there (D2) 7) Brign them up again (M2) 8) Undo 4) Each
        M2 and D2 looks like one move and for my brain (pretty closely related

        I&#x27;m far from FMC expert but what does parity have to do with FMC?
        Hey! Well parity in a sense has lots to with FMC. Here are a few
        examples where u can utilise parity information. Im not only talking
        about total parity of a cube state but also the parity of the cycles
        that makes up the current state. - Ending up with say a corner 2-cycle
        and an edge 2-cycle is for the most part a bad thing. We don&#x27;t know
        too many algorithms for these cases. And it can be hard to find setup
        moves for them. Those who know PLL very well will have an advantage
        here. I don&#x27;t so i avoid these cases ;-) - Ending up with 6 corners
        is usually bad news unless u are really lucky and get 2 distinct pure
        3-cycles (each is order 3!) Most other cases are bad. - Parity
        information can help u placing edges correctly on last layer after 2x2x3
        (or 2x3x3 with a missing c/e pair). - Parity information can help u
        check whether u will end up in a possible 2-g state after doing 2x2x3
        block. U will need to check that each edge is correctly flipped and that
        the corners are in a possible state too (corner 3-cycles are not
        possible in 2-g) Im sure there are also other cases where parity
        information is really useful. Being left with only edges is similar to
        being left with only corners in this respect. There is sorta consensus
        that it&#x27;s generally easier to insert corner 3-cycles than to insert
        edge 3-cycles. And also that we usually save more moves on inserting the
        corner cycles. Happy counting :-) -Per > How do you make use of it? In

        Yes, sure I also care about parity. If I end up in an odd position,

        I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be the wise Gandalf (see Gilles post ...),
        but here are my thoughts : It seems that all metrics have their pros and
        cons, their fans and opponents, and a bunch of reasons to chose them or
        not to chose them. Corner-first and blocks-approaches ARE different and
        result from (rather than lead to) different optimisations related to
        different metrics. The swiss way would be ... neutrality ;-) Let&#x27;s
        simply take the average of these four metrics and let everyone optimise
        his preffered ! Have a look at #82 challenge and compare : Name (HTM)

        will be carefully read and treated ASAP :) It&#x27;s actually really a
        swiss compromise, since it does not change much the ranks ! What I
        wanted to point out is that a good solution remains a good solution in
        whatever metric we choose. Concerning the categories (expert, advanced,
        beginner, ...), they should be adapted in some way, but it&#x27;s not
        the hot part of the debate ! That&#x27;s my first and only post on that

        I&#x27;m sorry, I don&#x27;t see the obvious solution... I think here at
        Dan&#x27;s FMC it should count as 2 moves, independently of how you
        write it down. It&#x27;s so trivial even a simple program could count
        this. So we can write it any way we like it (preferably the way that
        makes the most sense, i.e. which allows understanding the solution
        best). For official competitions I suggest either the competitor uses
        slice notation or if for some reason he doesn&#x27;t want to, he should
        clearly mark the slice moves as such or provide his total move count.
        For example he could write &quot;R B M R...&quot; or &quot;R B [L&#x27;
        R2]&quot; (needs to be standardized). If he doesn&#x27;t write anything,
        L R2 should count as three quarter turns unless an automatic counter
        tool is available. It should be the job of the competitor, not the
        judge, to make sure it counts as 2. That said, STM is better anyway, not
        just because of this issue ;-) Cheers! Stefan

        agree with Stefan that it must be contestant responsibility to utilise
        any existing metric ambiguity trick. And hence i also suggest that this
        metric not be used officially. Yes sure, a clever computer program could
        have sorted this out. But it&#x27;s not very likely that such programs
        will be available in all official competitions. And i firmly beileve a
        contestants solution to be taken &quot;as is&quot;. If someone writes
        down a solution that has the last move wrong or a missing move, one
        should not be so kind as to correct this discretely. It&#x27;s an error
        of the contestant. What if last 2 moves are missing? Where to set the
        limits if we are permissive to errors? There is of coz no
        &quot;45-degree&quot; equivalent in fewest moves which could give
        equivalent to a 2 sec penalty (2 moves?). A move is either written down
        or it isn&#x27;t written down !! It can&#x27;t be half written down :D
        Cheers! -Per PS! After some thought i have done my poll voting and voted
        for STM as official metric. This should cater for various methods and
        won&#x27;t contain any ambiguity like the one mentioned for SQTM. Those
        who haven&#x27;t voted yet please do so (check Dan&#x27;s post a bit up
        the list)!! I know the swiss neutral solution is not part of the poll,
        but i believe it&#x27;s too tedious to be used in official competitions.
        For FMC it&#x27;s feasible to use it, but will still contain that SQTM
        ambiguity.

        Hey Mirek! I should think that both make sense &quot;foot&quot; or
        &quot;food&quot;. If u use foot it has a more subtle meaning, namely u
        have to speak up for urself if u are gonna get anywhere. So using ur
        feet is an analogy for getting somewhere. Using latter word food will
        have an obvious meaning, but it&#x27;s not so deep words then. Ok might

        I like the idea of teams too. So let&#x27;s do it! So in the very near
        future I will put a little form on the FMC page where you can register
        for the team event. Around FMC#93 I shall close the registration, and
        decide upon the teams. I don&#x27;t know the criteria I will use for
        making teams yet, except it will be 3 per team, but lets not have
        another &quot;metric-esque&quot; debate about it ;) By FMC#94, I will
        have sent emails to all the teams, giving contact details of all their
        team-members. By FMC#95 I shall release the scrambled cube, along with
        the normal one-week cube. For FMC#100 I shall not release a normal
        scramble, but will give the whole week to devote to solving the special
        team cube. This is when you must submit your solutions. By the end of
        FMC#100, I will post the results as usual! With a big party and
        fireworks ;) I will let you know when you can begin to register for the
        teams :) Dan :) - www.cubestation.co.uk FMC Co-ordinator (sounds

        Hey! Submitting several solutions still won&#x27;t prevent the &quot;yup
        yup, good one&quot;. We could instead end up with &quot;yup yup, good
        ones&quot;. How different do solutions have to be to be considered
        different? Same start and slightly different insertions will that be
        good enough? And if we force that the different solutions come from
        different ppl within each group the whole idea of making teams will seem
        a bit pointless. In any teamwork one is never sure that everyone
        contributes equally. As Stefan might have said: that&#x27;s life!
        Anyway. Lets see how well this team exercise will work out :-) And how

        (sounds important! :P ) Is it possible that we form teams ourselves and
        Dan approves them? Or do we have to let Dan decide for everything? I for
        example, would like to be in the same team with Mikael, so that for
        example we could meet (we live at less than 200 km away from each other)
        and discuss it. But then that would not be possible with all the teams
        and our live meeting would be considered an advantage. Anyway, I would
        really appreciate teams based on location (maybe even get in the same
        team with Per :) ) Sebastian

        I will select teams since I think this is the fairest way to do it. For
        instance, Per, Mirek, and David Wesley might all decide to get in a team
        together, which clearly would be unfair on all the rest. Of course, I
        don&#x27;t mind if you would like me to consider putting you in a team
        with Mikael, especially if you live near each other. I am also willing
        to consider any suggestions for teams, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s

        Yay! I want to be in the same team as Sebastian too!! Please Dan,
        please!!! No just kidding, but it would be fun to meet and have a live
        discussion with someone who also understands the art of FMC. We have
        talked a little about meeting and this would give us the perfect excuse
        to actually do it. But on the other hand I understand if others see this
        as an unfair advantage. If it&#x27;s possible to make even teams and at
        the same time take location into consideration that would be cool. Btw,
        are we allowed to make up our own team names or is Dan going to decide
        that too? ;) Per: I know submitting multiple solutions wouldn&#x27;t
        prevent that all solutions came from one member but the chance that the
        same person would find three starts better than any start the two others
        come up with is unlikely. I do agree that the teamwork would suffer if
        everybody had to contribute with one solution. But I still think
        submitting two solutions could be a good idea. As these two solution
        could use two different approaches (maybe force it?) and there would be
        a new challange to find two good solutions to the same scramble not only
        one. I just wanted to share my idea and see what everybody else thinks.
        If the decission is to go with one solutions I&#x27;m of course happy

        Hey! No normally i find something good without resorting to those kinda
        3- cycles. Mirek has however used another 10-move commutator variety : R
        F&#x27; R&#x27; F - U - F&#x27; R F R&#x27; - U&#x27; Now if i instead
        use U2 we get R F&#x27; R&#x27; F U2 F&#x27; R F R&#x27; U2 which is
        just a cyclical shift of the one u gave. Interesting ... Didn&#x27;t
        think of that before. I do also remember to have seen a proof that every
        cyclical shift of a commutator is a commutator. And likewise also a
        commutator with setup moves like this : S A B A&#x27; B&#x27; S&#x27;
        The proofs are a bit longish and not really interesting for us :-) Nice

        Hey, I don&#x27;t see a completion of my start here (yet). This
        interesting 10 move 3-cycle RB&#x27; U2 BR&#x27;B&#x27;R U2 R&#x27;B was
        the last one I found to complete all corner 3-cycle &quot;in one
        layer&quot; moves. That was decades ago when I was doing edges first in
        the last layer. Yes, it&#x27;s the commutator [R&#x27;BRB&#x27;,U2]
        shifted by two moves, or B&#x27;R[R&#x27;BRB&#x27;,U2]R&#x27;B. IMHO, it
        is n o t a commutator anymore. I may have overlooked it doing insertion
        because I thought it&#x27;s not necessary to check for it. My line of
        thought was that if 1+1 move cancels out then it&#x27;s not better than
        an 8-move commutator. So I need more than that. If 2+2 moves cancel out
        then I can shift the thing two moves and insert it at a differnt point
        (2 moves later). Now I see I was not correct, namely because of cases
        ...R&#x27;.B&#x27;... where inserting at the dot one plus one move
        cancel out from each side. Also case like ...B&#x27;R&#x27;.B&#x27;...
        gives ...B&#x27;R&#x27;RB&#x27; U2 BR&#x27;B&#x27;R U2 R&#x27;B B&#x27;
        = B2 U2 BR&#x27;B&#x27;R U2 R&#x27; handles the 3-cycle in 5 moves,
        pretty short not to check it out. Cyclical shift of the commutator [P,Q]
        is always a commutator if the shift does not split P or Q. All shifts of
        8-move corner 3-cycles are commutators, however. Did I clear the thing
        up? Or am I wrong at some point? Mirek --- In

        Hi ! I uploaded the 2.0 version of my genetic solver. The program should
        now solve any fully scrambled cube in about 30-40 moves. Email me if you
        are interested in the source code (Fortran), and feel free to test it
        and report any bug or suggestion ;-) I decided to use only genetic
        programming and no additional alg is hidden in the source code: this
        program learns each time how to solve the cube. This is not THE
        definitive version, but from now on I don&#x27;t think I will post again
        on that topic, unless I make an incredible discovery in my secret,
        genetically modified, cube program factory. Enjoy ! Cyril

        Hi everyone, I am really trying hard to suss the practice of inserting
        moves to solve corners. Now, I understand the concept of it, and
        although Per has spent a lot of time trying to explain it to me, I still
        can&#x27;t make them happen by myself. But as I try more and more, I am
        getting little insights, but still not finding out the whole truth. I
        try it the commutator way, doing something like PQ P&#x27;Q&#x27; where
        Q is a 3 move string, but I&#x27;m still not really sure how to find out
        what P and Q should be. I use stickers with numbers on, so i can make
        the orientation correct, as Per (and Mirek sometime ago) showed me.
        Would it be useful for me to know moves for all the different 3 cycles
        you can have in one layer? Or can you intuitively put them together
        using this commutator method? It is really frustrating me, especially
        when some of you guys seem to pick it up really quickly. Once I&#x27;ve
        got the hang of this, what is the best way to solve a corner 5-cycle? At
        the moment I am just trying to solve 1->2->3, and then just solving
        whats left with another 3-cycle. Well, I would be solving them if i
        could find the insertions :P I hope you can help :) Dan :)

        Hi Dan, to know moves for all the different 3 cycles you can have in one
        layer may be useful but not for now. Some of them take 9 or even 10
        moves. You want to insert 3-cycle sequences that are 8-move long. We
        discussed one exeption here recently (you rather don&#x27;t think about
        it now). Often the 3 corners do not fall in one layer when an 8-move
        commutator is possible. If your Q is 3 moves then its middle move is
        with the opposite face than P. After you perform such a commutator on
        the solved cube, you see that one corner in the layer P keeps its
        P-color in the P- face. Is it P-clear to you? I mean &quot;pretty
        clear&quot; :-)? The reason I&#x27;m telling you this is because it
        helps you with getting oriented. Two consecutive numbered stickers of
        1->2->3->1 should lie in the same face (P of cause). If they do, you
        have mostly 2 different 8-move commutators that solve the 3-cycle. After
        some practice you&#x27;ll be able to see pretty quickly how many moves
        if any cancel out in each case. Keep trying! Mirek --- In

        Hey Mirek, Thanks for your tips, I was able to use them already! I still
        have lots of troubles though, for instance now I am getting cases where
        there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a layer which contains two of the
        pieces, or i can cycle them correct but i can get the orientation
        correct. It hurts my head :( It&#x27;s like, you don&#x27;t only have to
        look for when the corner pieces are all in the same layer, but you also
        have to find when they are in a particular orientation as well! I&#x27;m
        sure there must be a way of doing it, but i can&#x27;t find it :( Dan :)

        cube like this: R&#x27; D R U R&#x27; D&#x27; R U&#x27; Now put a marker
        on the U(BR) sticker, because that&#x27;s a sticker that&#x27;s already
        on the correct face. It needs to be solved to U(RF), so put a marker on
        that sticker as well. That sticker needs to go to L(FD) so put a marker
        on that one as well. Let me show the &quot;forward&quot; commutator
        first (it&#x27;s how I like to think of it). What you want to do is
        replace the U(BR) sticker with the L(FD) sticker without doing any other
        changes to the U-layer. This can be done with (B&#x27; D2 B). Like you
        pick up a corner of the first layer if you can&#x27;t do F2L and hold
        cross at top. You&#x27;ve somewhat swapped two of our three bad pieces.
        Now you want to do another swap (remember a 3-cycle is just two swaps).
        So bring the U(RF) sticker to U(BR) so it can play in the next swap
        instead of the already solved piece. Do U&#x27; and undo the first
        moves, thereby applying the second &quot;swap&quot;: (B&#x27; D2 B). Now
        all that&#x27;s left to do is bring U back with a U move. It helps me a
        lot to think in terms of stickers, not pieces. Yes, I want to solve
        pieces, but if I solve just one sticker of a piece then of course the
        piece is solved, too. That is, if you think of the stickers as being
        part of a piece, i.e. the U sticker of the URF sticker does belong to
        U(RF), not at U(FL), for example. Scramble again like above (R&#x27; D R
        U R&#x27; D&#x27; R U&#x27;). You can also do it &quot;backwards&quot;.
        Start with U to let the U(BR) sticker replace the U(RF) sticker inside
        the U layer. Then replace it with the L(FD) sticker doing (R&#x27; D R).
        Then let the other U sticker participate in the second swap, i.e. do
        U&#x27;. Now do the second swap: (R&#x27; D&#x27; R). In this case the
        two possibilities differ only in QTM but sometimes the also differ in
        HTM. Try this scramble: (R&#x27; D R U2 R&#x27; D&#x27; R U2). The U
        sticker that&#x27;s in the D layer needs to go to U(LB) which takes 4
        moves, e.g. (D&#x27; B D B&#x27;). Thus, the whole forward commutator
        would be: (D&#x27; B D B&#x27;) U2 (B D&#x27; B&#x27; D) U2. But
        it&#x27;s easy to bring it to U(RF) instead of U(LB) so do the backward
        commutator instead: U2 (R&#x27; D R) U2 (R&#x27; D&#x27; R). I&#x27;d
        recommend you first try a bit to *not* insert a 3-cylce somewhere in the
        middle of your solution, but only at the end. Just until you get a good
        feeling for it. Then when you try to insert somewhere in the middle,
        instead of looking for one sticker being on the correct face, look for
        two markers on the same face. Finally let me show an ugly one. Hold
        white at top. Do (R&#x27; B&#x27; D2 B R). Imagine you want to solve the
        top layer (because you&#x27;re a beginner at solving the cube). The
        white sticker is on the D face which is the worst case. The above
        sequence can solve this in just five moves. So solve it again and
        scramble like this: (U2 R&#x27; B&#x27; D2 B R U2 R&#x27; B&#x27; D2 B
        R). You can solve it with this commutator: (R&#x27; B&#x27; D2 B R) U2
        (R&#x27; B&#x27; D2 B R) U2. Normally for this you&#x27;d put markers on
        U(RF), U(LB) and D(FR) . Alternatively, you could for example put the
        markers on R(FU), L(BU) and F(RD), which is also a 3-cycle of stickers
        that would solve the cube. Now we don&#x27;t have any two markers on the
        same face, but it&#x27;s easier to find a nice setup-alg for a nice
        commutator. Do (R&#x27; B2). Now there are two nice commutators, the
        shorter in QTM is: R&#x27; (D L&#x27; D&#x27;) R (D L D&#x27;). Undo the
        setup-moves: (B2 R). Overall it&#x27;s the same in HTM but we save 2 in
        QTM. How do you guys take care for the three possible 3-sticker-cycles?
        I think I might use three differently colored markers in the future.

        Hey Stefan, Thanks for all the tips! They have certainly helped. I guess
        I was being a bit blind or stupid but I was under the impression that
        you could have solved any corner case using the PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; in 8
        moves. But now I realise depending on Orientation you sometimes need
        another move or so. But this brings up another confusion... how do i
        know what to look for when going through my solution to find suitable
        insertion points? At the moment I try to see when all 3 corner pieces
        are in 1-layer (layer of the cube, not the definition of layer we used
        when solving the actual corners), but it seems you could also spot other
        situations which are not of this type, but if you did a set-up move to
        get all pieces in one layer, you might then have to undo the set-up move
        to start the commutator. I just need some concrete rules to use when
        looking for pieces! Until I get enough experience that I start seeing
        things a bit easier. But this is really fun to explore! And thank you
        for the practice idea, it is really clever, wish I had thought of it :P

        sorry, I don&#x27;t understand what you mean here. Actually what you
        want is two markers on the same face and the third marker not in the
        layer of that face. Optimally the third marker would also not be on the
        opposite face, but on an adjacent one. Since there are three
        3-sticker-cycles you can use three differently colored sets of three
        markers each. Let&#x27;s say you have pink, black and turquoise markers.
        Example again: Scramble with: R&#x27; D R U R&#x27; D&#x27; R U&#x27;.
        Now put markers on the stickers of the bad pieces. Choose some sticker
        first and follow its path to know where to put the other two of the same
        color. Put pink markers on U(RF), L(FD) and U(BR). Put black markers on
        R(FU), F(DL) and B(RU). Put turquoise markers on F(UR), D(LF) and R(UB).
        Clear so far? Now let&#x27;s see how the different marker sets can lead
        to different solutions: Pink: I see two markers on the U face and the
        third outside the U layer. Perfect already. Two possibilities: [B&#x27;
        D2 B, U&#x27;] [U, R&#x27; D R] Black: No two markers on one face, but I
        can easily reach that with a setup move, for example with R2 bringing
        two black markers to the F face and one outside the F layer. Let&#x27;s
        put F to U with an x rotation just to make things clearer. Then we have
        two possible nice solutions: [L D&#x27; L&#x27;, U] [U&#x27;, R&#x27;
        D&#x27; R] Of course you&#x27;ll have to undo the R2 at the end, which
        will at least cancel out in the second solution. There are other setup
        moves as well, try to find a nice one and show us! Turquoise: Again no
        two markers share a face. But with one setup-move we can reach a good
        state, e.g. with R&#x27; or B&#x27;. Try to find good commutators that
        work using these. As you can see, the pink markers lead to the best
        solutions in this case because already at start two of them were on one
        face and the third outside of its layer and even on an adjacent face.
        The black and turquoise markers were slightly slower but of course this
        won&#x27;t always be the case. When you go through your solution, trying
        to insert a 3-cycle, look for two markers of the same color on one face
        and the third marker of the same color outside its layer and hopefully
        on an adjacent face. Good luck... uh, I mean... insight and wisdom! And
        let us know how it&#x27;s going. Cheers! Stefan > seems you could also

        Hey! What he means by good insertion points is to see easily whether
        there is gonna be any cancellation when inserting a corner 3-cycle
        there. This assumes a basic 8-move corner 3-cycle is at all possible at
        that specific point. With practice u can see fast what the first and
        last move will be when u &quot;construct&quot; ur PQP&#x27;Q&#x27;
        commutator 3-cycles. Either P or Q could be the 3-move part that
        replaces one corner in the layer moved by Q or P. If u know the P part
        will be say R B R&#x27; and the Q part is F2 u know that the sequence
        will start with R and end with F2. If the Q part was simply F then it
        would instead end with F&#x27; (Q&#x27; is F&#x27; in this case). I
        agree that the most confusing part can be that there are 3 ways to put
        on the stickers, and the chance is only 1/3 that 2 stickers will be on
        the same face when a 8-move corner 3-cycle is possible. Again u see with
        practice that there is a move that moves one sticker to the other (while
        not moving the last corner) and that there exists a 3-mover transporting
        the last sticker to either of the 2 others (being in the same layer),
        changing only 1 corner in that layer of course. It helps to imagine the
        layer with the 2 corners as entirely black apart from the 2 corners and
        the rest of the cube transparent apart from the 3rd corner ;-) It&#x27;s
        not easy i know but if u manage u are a long way to find those magic
        3-movers :-) In fact it&#x27;s exactly those cases when the last sticker
        (on the third corner) can be moved to either of the 2 first 2 stickers
        (corners) in 3 moves that we have 2 possible 8-move corner 3-cycles with
        same effect :-) To see this assume the stickers are numbers 1,2,3. 1 and
        2 are in the same layer (assume for simplicity in the same face). If
        moving 3 to 1 in 3 turns first gives the desired cycle then instead
        moving 3 to 2 first gives the inverse cycle. So if u do that (3 to 2
        first) u can reverse ur whole cycle. For obvious reasons this can&#x27;t
        be the same sequence as the first, since this sequence will start w
        moving the layer that has corners w stickers 1 and 2. And the first
        sequence will not :-) Example if the desired cycle is reached by :
        R&#x27; D&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; D R U then we can also do following to
        create the inverse cycle : L D&#x27; L&#x27; U L D L&#x27; U&#x27;.
        Inverting the latter gives U L D&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L D L&#x27; U
        which is not same as R&#x27; D&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; D R U.
        Incidentally also R&#x27; D&#x27; R U2 R&#x27; D R U2 has another
        possible sequence giving same result. Can u work it out (Dan) ? Cheers!

        last night I thought about this a bit more and now I understand it. Will

        Yes, you still have only two 8-move commutators doing the same 3-cycle
        in that case. For Dan: Once you are comfortable solving corner 3-cycles
        with 8-move commutators (when it is possible), you can start searching
        for good insertions the way I do it. Here is the know-how. Let the
        sequence ABCDE...XYZ solves the cube up to 3 corners (cycled). I
        don&#x27;t use no middle layer moves here. Stick numbered stickers
        correspondigly on these corners, 3 or if you like 9 colored stickers,
        numbers 1,2,3. Start undoing all the moves slowly one by one as
        Z&#x27;Y&#x27;X&#x27;.... Use a pointer (a pen is not very good) to show
        on your written sequence where you currently are. At each point, think
        about the move you&#x27;re doing as a beginning of an 8-move commutator
        that can solve the current position the corners are in. If the move does
        not match your commutator (either one of two, one or none possible),
        continue. If it matches write it down. Continue until you&#x27;re back
        in the scrambled cube. Incentives: you have your cube ready for another
        solving attempt. Example. Suppose you&#x27;ve done
        Z&#x27;Y&#x27;X&#x27;...E&#x27;. Now you&#x27;re about to do D&#x27; and
        you notice that [D&#x27;,Q] (Q is 3 moves) solves the case. Two moves, D
        D&#x27;, will cancel out. More you can figure out when practicing on
        FMC#eightysomething. Happy 3-cycling! Mirek --- In

        Hi everybody! FIrst of all thanks for your helpful comments and tips and
        examples of commutators in FMC solves. I have said it before to people I
        know, but I really AM getting the hang of it now! It&#x27;s really fun
        searching for commutators now I can spot them a bit easier and not have
        to think too hard. I have taken all your comments on board, and my
        system is a bit of a hybrid of methods, like Mirek&#x27;s pointer and
        Per&#x27;s commutators and Stefan&#x27;s stickers... and also some of my
        own discoveries, like I labelled each of the centres U B R L F D to help
        me write down the commutators directly into the same frame of reference
        as my scramble/solution reference frame, without having another thing to
        think about. So now I have another question... What routines do you use,
        when starting from a solution with some corners left? I know you&#x27;ve
        talked about it before, but I really want to hear it in one post. There
        are so many different possibilities at each stage. It&#x27;s even worse
        when you have to insert 2 3-cycles to make a 5-cycle, because you could
        find a couple of insertions yielding the same number of moves for the
        first 3-cycle, which leads to 2 different solutions in which to look for
        insertions of the 2nd 3- cycle! How do you deal with all the
        possibilities? And it doesn&#x27;t stop there... once I&#x27;ve really
        mastered corners, I might start asking about edge commutators ;) I feel
        the best way to learn is to always ask lots of questions, my school
        teachers knew all about that LOL. Once again thanks for everything, and
        I hope to be a regular competitor in my own competition from now on! I
        finally got bitten by the FMC bug, about time too ;) Dan :) --- In

        Hello Dan! When I have found something with a corner 3-cycle I put my
        numbered stickers on the faces and start backtracking. I use Cube
        Companion to keep track of where I am and doublecheck the commutator. I
        start with checking if a commutator can be used, if it&#x27;s possible I
        check if any moves cancel. If 2 or more moves cancel I write the
        commutator down. Then I make the next (actually previous if you
        backtrack ;) turn and repeat the steps above. If there was no insertion
        cancelling 2 moves or more it&#x27;s easy to remember where insertions
        cancelling one move were possible. If I have to solve a 5-cycle I do the
        same as with a single 3-cycle but I also note which corners are rotated.
        That way I can do the checking a bit faster. For example if I found a
        commutator with the corners 1,2 and 3 that cancels 5 moves it&#x27;s no
        point trying commutators with those corners that only cancel 3 moves
        (the insertion points for the next 3-cycle will be exactly the same
        apart from the alg just inserted). On the other hand if I found a 3 move
        canceller with corners 4,5 and 1 I would note it down because then I
        would have different corners for the second cycle giving me totally
        different insertion points. So 5-cycles are a lot more work than a
        normal 3 cycle (the same is true for 4-cycles). In this weeks FMC I
        ended up with a corner 5-cycle. I found one insertion cancelling 4 moves
        and 3 others cancelling 3 moves (all using different corners) so I had
        to do the second insertion check 4 times. This time the best overall
        insertion was using the insertion cancelling 4 moves but quite often I
        have found better overall cancellations using another insertion than the
        one giving maximum cancellation. I hope I make any sence and that you
        get a picture of how I do it, Mikael

        Hey! _No computers_ basically means no computer software that helps u in
        any way to search for moves/sequences. So yes, taking it literally, the
        companion is not allowed. But i guess most here or many anyway use the
        companion for various purposes other than the solving bit: -verify
        correctness of ur sequence/solution -normalise notation to UFRBLD only
        -check length of ur sequence/solution in all the metrics None of this is
        really helping u towards finding ur solution :-) In Amsterdam last year
        3 cubes were allowed for the fewest moves. No other aids were allowed.
        But now, if i understand correctly, stickers will also be allowed in
        fewest moves. So this will help a lot when inserting algs (3-cycles and
        others!) into ur sequence/solution :D Regards, -Per > --- In

        cubes and stickers should help... throw in enough Lego, too, and maybe

        has been on the internet, using a computer. You are allowed to use OLL
        and PLL algs you know, but you are not allowed to search for a specific
        one on the internet. I&#x27;m quite new to FMC so I often end up in a
        situation I know can be solved in few moves but I don&#x27;t know those
        moves. Then I find another solution but learn the new alg so that I can
        use it next time I get a similar position. But learning algs without
        understanding how they work give you very limited gains in FMC. It is
        essential to try to understand how the alg works so that you can modify
        it to your needs. > Stupid Question; What is a commutator? How does >
        corner Insertion work? Those are not stupid questions at all. A
        commutator is a sequence that only manipulates a few cubies (for example
        3 corners). A commutator works like this PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; where P and Q
        are sequences of moves and &#x27; indicates the inverse of the sequence.
        Here is an example, lets say P = R U R&#x27; and Q = D then you would
        have R U R&#x27; D R U&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; (a basic corner 3-cycle).
        Sometimes commutators are noted {R U R&#x27;, D} where everything before
        the comma is P and the rest is Q. The inverse is of course also a
        commutator (PQP&#x27;Q&#x27;)&#x27; = QPQ&#x27;P. If you do the example
        on a solved cube and then apply the inverse of it you will see this.
        Corner insertion is when you have found a solution that solves
        everything but a few corners (3 corners wrong is the best) and then
        backtrack that solution and try to find a spot where to insert a
        commutator that solves the remaining corners and at the same time
        cancels out some moves. For a good example check Mireks solution to FMC
        #82 (read his comments and first solve the scramble without inserting
        the commutator, then backtrack, do the insertion (notice that a few
        moves cancel), solve and you will have a fully solved cube ). Edge
        insertion works the same way. The aim with both is that it&#x27;s easier
        to not solve all pieces at once and then solve the remaining ones where
        it&#x27;s most beneficial. > THanks A Lot You are welcome, hope I
        answered your questions. Mikael PS. I will give a more detailed
        explanation of how I use Cube Companion to doublecheck my commutators so
        noone thinks I cheat =). First I do all backtracking on paper using
        multiple cubes to try commutators as I go. When I&#x27;m done I insert
        the best one in my solution and the run it on CC checking the whole
        solution and the commutator in one go. While searching insertion points
        I only use CC as my pointer of where in the solution I am.

        Hello :-) They can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s not allowed to use any OLL or
        PLL alg just because a computer got it first. And who knows if a
        computer found it or another human a long time ago. Even so, u have
        memorised that alg so are u to use it ;-) A commutator is a sequence of
        moves in 4 parts like this : PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; P is any sequence of
        moves, so is Q. P&#x27; is the inverse sequence of P and Q&#x27; is
        inverse of Q&#x27;. So if P = URF and Q=DLB then PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; = URF
        DLB F&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27; B&#x27;L&#x27;D&#x27; =
        URFDLBF&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;B&#x27;L&#x27;D&#x27; :-) Umm for corner
        insertions read many of the recent posts. There are some very good
        explanations on how to do it there :-) Basically what u do is to insert
        a corner 3-cycle somewhere earlier on in order to cancel moves, instead
        of just simply add it to the end. Cheers! -Per > --- In

        Hi everyone! The FMC has a new, fresh look, and registration has opened
        for the special Team Fewest Moves Event which will be held to celebrate
        FMC #100! Registered competitors will be put into teams of 3, and will
        be given 5 weeks to solve the special scramble as a team.You can
        communicate as much as possible via email, phone, or whatever, and if it
        is possible, you will be teamed with people who live near you so you
        could even arrange a face to face meeting! You are guaranteed to learn
        lots from the experience, and you will also have a lot of fun!
        Absolutely anyone is welcome to take part, and if you are a beginner,
        you are sure to be teamed up with a more knowledgeable FMC&#x27;er so
        you can get the most out of the competition! All you have to do to take
        part in this &quot;historic&quot; event is to register your details
        using the Team FMC registration form. The form is on this page
        http://www.cubestation.co.uk/fmcresults/teamfmc100.php - or
        alternatively you can visit www.cubestation.co.uk, click on the Fewest
        Moves Challenge link in the Red menu panel, and then click the yellow
        box to get to the Team FMC page. And why not browse around the new look
        FMC pages while you are there :) Full details of the competition will be
        emailed to all registered competitors, and registration closes at around
        FMC week 95, and the scramble will be released at FMC #96. Hope you can
        take part! Dan Harris :)

        make a suggestion for &quot;forcing&quot; the teamwork to be a bit
        better distributed : for this FMC (and this one only ...) we could
        imagine submitting 2 (not necessarly different) solutions in two
        different metrics (one with slice moves and the other without) and sum
        the number of moves. I think that it would encourage ppl to try various

        Yes, I wouldn&#x27;t mind posting all the solutions which were sent in,
        if they came with explanations, and we can make it a showcase of how to

        I intend to participate, too. I&#x27;m a complete beginner, though. I
        just started FMC a couple of weeks ago and my method needs some definite

        of FMC #87 up today, but I will post them very soon. Meanwhile I have
        already launched FMC #88 as I won&#x27;t be in a position to do it this
        evening. The Submit button should begin working again at midnight :)

        Hi :-) Yes, both FR&#x27;F&#x27;R and RUR&#x27;U&#x27; are commutators
        :-) A commutator is like this : P Q P&#x27; Q&#x27; where P is any
        sequence of moves and so is Q. P&#x27; and Q&#x27; are the inverse
        sequences of P and Q respectively. So P&#x27; mean the sequence P done
        backwards, and likewise Q&#x27; is sequence Q done backwards. In ur 2
        cases both P and Q are single moves, but that&#x27;s ok. The sequences
        can be single moves :-) About insertion (of corner 3-cycles) read up on
        this. There has been many posts about it. It would be nice with a
        website devoted to explaining insertions in depth. With diagrams and so
        on. Maybe it&#x27;s coming some day. Basically an insertion is to do an
        alg somewhere else instead of at the end. Umm it&#x27;s not technically
        the same alg u insert somewhere but an alg moving those same cubies in
        the same way as u would have done adding at the end. What u try to
        achieve by insertions is to have move cancellations so that ur solution
        becomes shorter. Sometimes i end up with 5 unsolved corners that i split
        into 2 3-cycles and then insert those 2 somewhere to save moves. This
        does take a long time cause there are many possible combinations to
        break the 5-cycles into 2 3-cycles. And there are many possible
        insertion points to check out. But with some experience this is rather
        fun. The way to find the alg giving u the desired effect is to put extra
        (numbered) stickers on ur cube on the facelets of the cube and then
        reverse one move at a time and see if u find an alg that can give u
        cancellation while (of coz) cycling the cubies like u want. Happy
        counting moves ;-) -Per K PS! As a curiosity also F B F&#x27; B&#x27; is
        a commutator, obviously doing nothing at all. 2 moves or sequences are
        said to _commute_ when the commutator between them is the identity
        (doing nothing). An example of 2 commuting sequences is P = R&#x27;
        L&#x27; D2 L R, Q = F B D2 F&#x27; B&#x27;. U can easily verify that in
        this case P Q P&#x27; Q&#x27; does nothing. In this case not hard to
        explain why. Looking carefully u see that P = P&#x27; and Q = Q&#x27;.
        And also P Q produces 2 2-cycles on the edges only. So P Q P&#x27;
        Q&#x27; is like doing (P Q)*2 and since P Q gives 2 2-cycles then (P
        Q)*2 = I (identity) Neat ;-) > --- In

        Hi! Mirek, after ur marvellous 12 move start U2 F R&#x27; B R&#x27;
        F&#x27; L2 D&#x27; F2 D&#x27; F L there is a rather short finish like

        Hi Per, I was almost sure that I could do better after my first 11 moves
        (those are pretty easy to find). The rest can be solved as D&#x27; L
        F&#x27; L&#x27; D L2 F&#x27; D&#x27; F2 L&#x27; as you pointed out. Did
        you ask Cube Explorer or you saw it? These moves are very hard to find
        (!), at least for me. I was sure that 15 moves was too much because I
        found several solutions of that length. I also started to look at the
        inverse position obtained as L F&#x27; L F&#x27; U F2 D&#x27; F&#x27; D
        F2 U&#x27; F D&#x27; F2 L&#x27;. Here is one way how to get its optimal
        solution: The first move is rather obvious - L, then make the UR corner
        of F face as F2 D F L&#x27; F, then L&#x27; and finish three pairs as
        commutator [L F&#x27; L&#x27;, D&#x27;]. Putting it all together - L F2
        D F L2 D&#x27; L F L&#x27; D which is the inverse of what I needed to
        win with 21-move solution that would be even with the unoficial world
        record you already have. Mirek --- In

        Hehe ... Yes i must admit i didn&#x27;t find those nice moves myself. I
        was in a rush. I tried to find something short myself but only found
        26/27 and i found also a 18 mover with 2 remaining c/e pairs left

        Ya, I found it, at least two of my solutions go through this odd
        permutation called &quot;J&quot; in Fridrich system. Both solutions are
        26 moves long (too much). Mirek P.S. We didn&#x27;t have to play with

        that does require that the whole cube is setup (from solved) according
        to the moves in the file i guess. I never used that before. The way it

        Hi everyone! In association with www.cubesmith.com,
        www.cubestation.co.uk is proud to annouce that from next week we will be
        offering small prizes to the winners of each metric each week in the
        FMC! www.cubesmith.com is a small yet rapidly growing enterprise
        manufacturing custom cube stickers for the various shapes and sizes of
        rubik&#x27;s puzzles. Each week we will offer small prizes such as set
        of stickers or tiles, for the various cubes. Let&#x27;s face it,
        everyone will need some replacerment stickers sometime! So why not have
        a practice at this week&#x27;s FMC scramble (week #88) which is listed
        on the FMC page at www.cubestation.co.uk , in preparation for the
        following prize FMC&#x27;s to come! Check the FMC newswire for more
        details as I get a chance to post them :) Good Luck! Dan Harris -

        Hi Dan ! you made a little typo in my solution move count : STM result
        is 28 instead of 38 ... Btw, did anyone had a look at my edge 3-cycle
        insertion after the 22 moves I mention ? I have no real feeling about
        edges cycles, and I wonder if it&#x27;s possible to cancel more moves

        Hi you! I looked at the edges. I can&#x27;t tell you what to do after
        those 22 moves. But I suggest to do
        L&#x27;FLFB&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27;UF&#x27;B before them. You gain in QTM
        which will help once multiple submitions are allowed. In HTM it is still

        Hi Cyril! After ur 22 moves like this : B&#x27; L U2 R&#x27; D B R L2 D2
        L&#x27; D2 F&#x27; D F&#x27; L D&#x27; L&#x27; D2 F D.F2 D&#x27; u can
        insert the following at the dot : R2 U2 L2 B L2 U2 R2 F This gives u a
        29 move solution, cancelling 1 move only. But as pointed out by Mirek
        its also worth thinking about qtm (or other metrics) also. Im getting
        more and more convinced that corner finishing is indeed the best way of
        FMC-ing :-) (There are exceptions to anything though ... ) Cheers! -Per

        Per, your #88 solution is very interesting - elegant. You should win a
        prize for it! BTW, how did you come up with the first 6 moves? It can be
        written as (U&#x27;D&#x27; F&#x27;B&#x27; L&#x27;R&#x27;) (R&#x27;
        U&#x27; R&#x27; D2 R U R) (R U2 R D2) (F&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; B2
        D&#x27; F2 U2). This also reminds me an interesting task: Solve the
        scrambled cube with single right moves only. (Or with left ones only.)
        For example such a solution for R F&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; R F L2 U2
        B&#x27; R2 U&#x27; L B R2 D&#x27; R2 L2 U&#x27; D R2 is L U F R U F U B

        Umm ... I must make sure to win prize by winning again sometime soon.
        The prize are up from this week onwards only ;-) Interesting way u
        rewrote my solution Mirek. I hadn&#x27;t thought of that. In fact i had
        thought the solution was quite ugly since it uses many half turns. And
        the insertions also worked out by many half turns in them. It was quite
        nice that i inserted first 3-cycle exactly in the middle of the
        sequence, and also the second 3-cycle was inserted right in the middle
        of the first insertion. So there was so symmetry in that respect. Having
        so good cancellations when there are relatively few possible insertion
        points i would say is really lucky. It&#x27;s not easy to say exactly
        how i came up with those 6 first moves. Working on edges is quite
        different from working w blocks first. There is larger variation in how
        u approach it. And u reach to the &quot;endgame&quot; faster than u
        would do starting w blocks. My approach is sorta pure engineering. I
        know what are good starts for plundering w insertions afterwards. So im
        just happy find starting a start like that. This approach also leads to
        less readable final solutions (i guess). Solutions that are short and
        have no insertion tricks in them are inherently more beautiful IMHO. But
        it&#x27;s all about the length of the solution anyway. There&#x27;s no
        prize for beauty. Lol ... I&#x27;m more interested in the
        &quot;clockwise solving&quot;. How do u come up with a solution like u
        have shown? I would have no easy way to deal with that. Except real
        lengthy sequences i guess. Cheers! -Per > --- In

        I think &quot;clockwise solving&quot; is more practical than
        counterclockwise, too. It&#x27;s shorter when you write it down and it
        does not cause you old cube with loose screws to fall apart. How I came

        I was wondering actually why the scramble wasn&#x27;t the standard
        length og 25 or 30 or 40 :D But seriously how would we come up with
        &quot;short&quot; solutions for clockwise solving? I recall there was
        some discussion about thise in the speedsolving group a long time ago
        (last yr most likely). But the focus of discussion was only to show that
        solving is possible. So some algs were derived for stuff like edge-flip,
        corner-twist, simple cycles ... But not how to combine all this to
        feasible length overall solutions. Hmm ... -Per > > > --- In

        Hi Mirek, First of all, congratulations to the winners! I hope though
        that prize FMCs won&#x27;t stop just because there&#x27;s nore than one
        winner every time. Now to the point: I tried a lot to get something out
        of L D&#x27; F&#x27; D F2 D F2 D&#x27; B&#x27;, and here&#x27;s what I
        found out. Notice that the move sequence D&#x27; F&#x27; D F2 D F2
        D&#x27; B&#x27; solves all the pieces that are part of the DR 2x2x3
        block. That means that no matter how we move the L and U faces before
        applying this sequence, those pieces will be solved. So I naturally
        thought about finding some moves that will actually solve the cube. I
        didn&#x27;t manage to find that, I found B L B&#x27; L U L2 U2 L U
        (D&#x27; F&#x27; D F2 D F2 D&#x27; B&#x27;) which leaves five corners,
        and L U2 L&#x27; U L U&#x27; L&#x27; U L U (D&#x27; F&#x27; D F2 D F2
        D&#x27; B&#x27;) which leaves five edges. Since those edges were part of
        that two-generator for 10 moves, I expected to find a good position for
        a 5-cycle of edges (belonging to the F U F&#x27; B L&#x27; B&#x27;
        family), but I didn&#x27;t. I had already found my 23 STM, 26 HTM
        solution, and this 5-cycle had good chances of lowering both. I will let
        you find out by yourselves how one can see which move sequence to apply
        at the beginning of the solution. It&#x27;s easy and interesting. This
        approach is somehow the complementary of the block style. It might be a
        bit easier to use this one rather than normal blocks. I&#x27;ll see
        about it in FMC 91. Sebastian

        Hey everyone, Recently as you know, I&#x27;ve been trying the techniques
        of corner insertion to optimise my solves. Last week FMC #89, I
        didn&#x27;t have time to come up with much because I was spending most
        of my time with Joel, but on the trainwhen I travelled to meet him in
        London, I did come up with the following: Scramble: F R2 B R (U&#x27;
        R&#x27; L2)*5 B2 L2 R B2 D2 (U2 F2 D)*5 R&#x27; U D&#x27; R Solution:
        R&#x27; B U&#x27; L2 R F L&#x27; D F2 D&#x27; B&#x27; L B2 D F&#x27; D F
        L D&#x27; L2 D&#x27; L D L&#x27; D&#x27; L D&#x27; = 27 moves with 3
        edges left. I don&#x27;t really know how to insert edges, and I
        don&#x27;t know the kind of tricks like PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; for the
        corners. So any help would be greatly appreciated :) Dan :) -

        Sebastian, this is interesting approach. Why can&#x27;t I get it?
        D&#x27; F&#x27; D F2 D F2 D&#x27; B&#x27; solves all the pieces that are
        part of the DR ? Their orientation does not matter for now. The RD-edge
        piece is missing, though. And you apply your sequence B L B&#x27; L U L2
        U2 L U before the above. Can you explain it to me? Anyway, the position
        after my 9 moves is not an easy one. I tried your first suggestion B L
        B&#x27; L. U L2 U2 L U _ D&#x27; F&#x27; D F2 D F2 D&#x27; B&#x27;. +5
        corners, and I found only L&#x27; D R&#x27; D&#x27; L D R D&#x27;, B
        D&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27; B D B&#x27; U to insert at the dots =>

        Hi there, I have two questions. One for Dan and one for Gilles. For Dan:
        I understand from the speed FMC rules you just wrote that the solution
        we submit must be the last solution we find, and that if we want to
        further search for a better solution, we must abandon the solution we
        just found. This makes e.g. insertions more risky than they are already,
        and I don&#x27;t think that would be correct. What if we find the next
        solution after an hour, are we not allowed to come back to the first
        one? For Gilles: how do you manage to find and write solutions in such a
        short time? You said in your quote that it&#x27;s 1 minute for the
        solution (one move in less than two seconds on average), and two minutes
        for writing it down. How do you write it down? Do you memorize it? Or do
        yo rescramble the cube and write it the second time you go through it?

        HI Seb, *sigh* this was the hardest bit to find the right words for, and
        it seems like I have failed. And I&#x27;m a native speaker of English...
        The crucial point is this: You don&#x27;t have to abandon a solution
        once you start looking for a new one. It&#x27;s perfectly valid to
        submit any solution that you have found. BUT you can&#x27;t submit the
        time you found it at if you then continued looking elsewhere. You MUST
        submit the total time you spent searching the cube, even if it was
        wasted time leading to nothing :) I hope this is clear at last! Dan :)

        Hi Mirek, Firstly, yes FMC #91 is again a Speed FMC! I thought we could
        all do with the practice ;) I think I have made the rules pretty clear
        on this point though. In the rules it says &quot;Once you have scrambled
        your cube for the first time, you are allowed time (no more than 5
        seconds) to verify that you have scrambled the cube correctly&quot; And
        &quot;You are NOT allowed any pre-inspection in the time between
        scrambling your cube, and starting the stopclock. All inspection and
        mental manipulation must be made while the stopclock is running&quot; So
        no, you can&#x27;t write down moves you are possibly going to make. Your
        first interpretation is right, you start the clock with your first look
        at the scrambled cube. Dan :) -----Original Message----- From:

        Hey Dan/Everyone !! Then i have one idea (again). Why not on the FMC
        homepage show only the scramble? And have a link to the applet of the
        scrambled cube. Then we can set up our cube according to scramble
        without having seen what it looks like. Already when we see the applet
        we immediately break the rules by making &quot;mental
        calculations&quot;. At least i can&#x27;t avoid doing that. When there
        is easy 2x2x2 i always see it before setting up the scramble on my own
        cube. It&#x27;s just an idea, not a big deal ;-) I would prefer some
        amendment to the rules, where it will potentially pay off to look
        further and find improvements to ur solution that might pay off without
        having to suffer if u fail with that. So say u have 40 moves after 10
        minutes > score 43. And u decide to keep looking. And then u have 35
        moves after say 30 minutes. This however gives u score of 45. And u
        carry on for 5 more minutes and find a 30 move solution. U have now
        spent 35 minutes which gives u 12 points for the time so 42 points in
        total. Now u decide to not look any further. So u can submit ur 42
        points solution. However if u hadn&#x27;t found ur 30 move solution u
        could still have submitted the 40 moves after 10 minutes. (With current
        rules u would have to submit 40 moves and 35 minutes > 52 points!!!)
        IMHO i think this is much more fair. And it adds more fun to the
        challenge. Of course spending *infinite* time does not pay off as u
        would need a solution with negative lenghth :-P What do u other guys
        think about this ? Cheers! -Per > --- In

        Hey! No, my toy example is correct, if following my proposed amendment.
        There is 30 move solution after 35 minutes > 42 points. Ur point is that
        if i didn&#x27;t find the 30 and following current rules then yes what i
        had is still the 35 moves obtained at 30 mins, but now the time is 35.
        So with current rules i have to submit that and not the 40 moves after
        10 minutes. With my amendment there is no penalty even for searching in
        vain after the 30 moves and 35 minutes. Is it clear now ? Best regards,

        did after an uninteresting F3 sequence) it&#x27;s like working with a
        LIFO stack. 32 STM was perfect (i.e. lucky), so I didn&#x27;t try to
        improve and stopped the timer. After, I only changed L&#x27;L&#x27; to
        L2. I wrote &quot;1 minute for the solution&quot; because I guess
        that&#x27;s the time I would have spent on it without having to write it
        down. I practiced twice (with different scrambles! :-) ) before trying
        it, because I&#x27;m not a speedwriter. Opinion about the rules: They
        should follow the tournament regulations. I mean that the timer should
        start as soon as the competitor can see the scrambling sequence (or a
        display of the scrambled cube), and stop when the final solution is
        written down, ready to be submitted. I still don&#x27;t know what to
        think about &quot;time points&quot;. If you don&#x27;t want to get any,
        as I wrote before this event is mainly speedscrambling and speedwriting.
        I feel it would be more interesting for many people here (not for me,
        but for the FMC champions) with lighter time penalities (penalty points
        starting at 10 minutes, and non linear progression). FMC Prize: Give it
        to another competitor please. Unofficial competitions are better without
        rankings and prizes :-) Gilles.

        Hi ! Actually the title is not a joke, I would greatly appreciate if you
        could help me with my genetic solver project. One solve for a 30-moves
        scramble takes about 3 hours on my computer, and my aim is to test the
        program on 100 random scrambles ... So if you are kind enough for
        helping me, here is what you can do : 1)Download the 2.1 version of the
        program : http://cyril.webzzanine.net/cube/genetic21.exe It&#x27;s a
        simple windows executable, virus-free (I swear :) ), about 430 ko
        2)Launch the program from your hard drive and enter the following
        parameters : 1 [enter], then 50000 [enter], then 30 [enter] : this leads
        to a 30-moves random scramble, with each 2x2x3 location searched for
        50000 generations 3)Once the program is over, you&#x27;ll see a sentence
        telling that &quot;the cube was solved in XXX moves&quot;, meaning that
        it&#x27;s done. A new file called results.txt should have been created
        in the same folder as the genetic21.exe file. It contains the scramble,
        and the different phases of the solution found. Save it with any other
        name (since results.txt is emptied at the start of each new simulation),
        and once you have some results you can email them to me at cyrilca [at]
        caramail [dot] com The program does not require a lot of cpu and memory,
        one is able to work normally when it&#x27;s running... I feel like the
        guys in charge of the SETI@Home project, even if the goal is here
        slightly different ! Many thanks to the FMC community for helping me in
        that project ! cyril PS : and of course all suggestions are welcome,
        even if there are lots of things I already would like to implement
        without having time to do so ...

        Well, I downloaded your genetic solver, run it on my fast notebook
        (it&#x27;s Pentium something like 1.8 GHz, not sure now) and kept
        checking if the program was running. After more than 6 hours I got tired
        and canceled the job. I conclude this suggestion: show an estimated
        total time the calculations will take. If it&#x27;s not possible, show
        some information about how far the calculations are. It&#x27;s well
        possible that I canceled the job very close to the finish because I had
        no clue how far the finish was. I&#x27;ve been running the program on
        Pentium 3.4 GHz for 2 hours now. Whuooooo, it finished and I don&#x27;t
        know when. Can&#x27;t you show the total time? I could run the program
        overnight on this PC if you supported multiple runs. This is what you
        should do if you want me to run it more than twice. :-) Are you sure
        it&#x27;s any faster than a random search in each phase? The resulting
        39 moves is what we can often do under one minute. With a help of your
        program it takes hours. I know, it&#x27;s a project on genetic

        Hi Mirek ! I really like this kind of message, especially your last
        sentence : It makes me think to my boss, when I have to explain why do I
        find interesting what I&#x27;m making :) Concerning your first 6 hours
        run, I guess it was a &quot;bad&quot; case. What I call a bad case is
        when you solve the 2x2x3 and are left with a tricky position (ie non
        trivial orientation of quite a lot of edges and permutation of corners
        to enter into the 2-gen group). In these cases, the convergence is
        stopped until a solution for that given stage is found. Since no alg is
        entered in the memory (it&#x27;s a deliberate choice ...), it can be
        slow, but in my knowledge it has never failed when I gave it enough time
        for searching. Concerning the elepsed time, it&#x27;s quite the same
        from a run to another. You can keep a track of the steps in the DOS-like
        window : 1) 12 tries for 2x2x3 (one per possible location) (total time
        is 12 X generations # = 12 X 50&#x27;000 = 600&#x27;000 generations in
        our case) 2) 10&#x27;000 more generations to enter the 2gen subgroup 3)
        200&#x27;000 more generations to solve the 2gen group The thing is, (2)
        and (3) have an open length : if no solution is found after 10&#x27;000
        generations in step 2, then 10&#x27;000 more are searched, and so on.
        Usually no more than 100&#x27;000 (step 2) and 600&#x27;000 (step 3) are
        needed in the extremely tough cases. I guess your 6 hours run was stuck
        in one of these cases, waiting for &quot;the one&quot; (yes, kind of
        Matrix-like ...), the magic individual that would solve this phase. Now
        to the point : is this interesting to develop such a program :) ? Of
        course you can guess my point of view : first, I slightly disagree when
        you tell we can find sub-40 solutions within one minute : we would have
        amazing results in the speed-FMC&#x27;s, what I did not observe last
        week ;-) And don&#x27;t forget that (it&#x27;s only a personnal
        estimation) no more than say 1% of all cubers and speedcubers can
        produce sub-40 moves averages. My program average, calculated on 15
        independent runs, is at the moment 34 : just to test I used your
        scramble and the alg found y D&#x27; L2 F&#x27; R2 B&#x27; F&#x27; L2 R
        D F&#x27; D&#x27; F L&#x27; U L2 F L&#x27; U F2 U2 F&#x27; U F U&#x27; F
        U F&#x27; U2 F&#x27; U2 F2 U&#x27; F&#x27; U F&#x27; U2 (36 moves HTM).
        The aim is not (actually it was once but not I feel more modest ...) to
        find solutions as good as yours, or Per&#x27;s or other FMC champions,
        but to produce relatively short solutions without knowing a single
        algorithm ! What about the random search ? Well, my program examines
        about 3000 moves sequences per second. For building a 2x2x3, you need an
        average of (let&#x27;s be optimistic) 9-10 moves, that means about 18 X
        15^8 > 10^10 sequences, or 925 hours ... and the 2-gen phase would have
        about the same length ... The good performance of Kociemba&#x27;s alg
        and (some) human players is a question of tactics, but also of known
        algs or caracteristical positions (Kociemba&#x27;s uses Mo-sized tables)
        ... I hope I convinced you :) I will try to incorporate some time
        indications in the program, but at the moment you can have a quite
        accurate idea if you remember that there are 12x50&#x27;000 generations
        for phase 1, about 10&#x27;000 for phase 2 and about 200&#x27;000 for
        the last one. Finally, an easy way to run multiple instances of the prog
        is to run copies of the .exe file from different folders. One result
        file per folder will then be created ... I know it&#x27;s not the
        ultimate programmer&#x27;s way but I claim I&#x27;m not a computer
        scientist ;-) Thanks for your comments and your help :) cyril --- In

        Many congratz to Mirek/Gilles :-) Managing 34 pts is absolutely
        brilliant achievement! I can&#x27;t see how that it is possible to do it

        i heard about Sebastian doing 35 pts last week i was sure he was gonna
        take the UWR. I was wrong. I found the scramble last week worse to deal
        with than the scramble the week before. So i guess i just tried all the

        In my case it&#x27;s a matter of luck. My average without taking moves
        back is still likely above 40 in about 4 minutes for each attempt. Here

        Well, This is last time i will forget to finalise my solution until 30
        mins before deadline :-P The pressure of getting it done in time made me
        miss the best insertion *shrugs* The way i work now is to first come up
        with a few good starts which i leave for finalisation later. I use my
        &quot;cube-math&quot; skills to judge what is a good start. Finding a
        good start is most often the hard work so i leave finishing them off for
        later sometimes, instead of having all the fun there and then ;-) Yes
        that 13 move f2l was really cool. It&#x27;s not the best i ever found,
        or that others found for that matter. I recall u Mirek had a 12-move f2l
        once. I also think i have found 12 before. Not sure if that start made
        it into the final solution at that time though. A shame u missed the
        deadline Mirek. Great solution also with a splendid insertion to finish
        it off. My best ever insertion for corner 3-cycle was cancelling 7
        moves. Umm .. apart from &quot;move-shift&quot; insertions which were
        not really productive for a real solution purpose. But i have used that
        to yield &quot;solution&quot; with a few twisted corners only :-) Ok,

        given 5 weeks to come up with the best solution to the cube. You can
        submit as many solutions as you like, but you will only be ranked on the
        solution with the lowest number of turns, averaged over all 4 turning
        metrics. I will post all the solutions, so if you want to come up with
        some fun and crazy solutions too, then feel free! The teams (at the
        moment) currently stand as: Per Kristen Fredlund (C), Bob Burton, Sachin
        [surname not supplied] Mirek Goljan (C), Chris Hardwick, Alexander Ooms
        Sebastian Dumitrescu (C), Mikael Nyberg, Ravi Fernando Lars Petrus (C),
        Gilles Roux, Cyril Castella Charles Tsai (C), Francois Sechet, Parker
        Gaitley. Please come up with some decent team names before the launch of
        the scramble, and let me know ;) Jason Kovacic is currently looking for
        2 team members to join him, can you help? Email me at danh@... if you
        want to participate with Jason. I will also stand in if necessary, but
        be warned, I&#x27;m not very good ;) Shortly you will receive contact
        details for your team members, so try to establish some sort of contact
        before the launch of the scramble, which all being well, will be in 3
        weeks time. Eventually all the things you need to know will find their
        way onto this page:
        http://www.necrophagous.co.uk/cubestation/fmcresults/teamfmc100.php - so
        check it out! Good Luck everyone! Dan :)

        Hi, I&#x27;m puzzled which 7 moves you mean. I don&#x27;t remember any
        evident 7 moves for 2x2x3. After I submitted my solution first week I
        found the same as Per [L&#x27;] D&#x27; L2 F2 R&#x27; D2 L, the first
        move is realized before scrambling and thus at the end of a solution,
        Per calls it &quot;premove&quot;. I count it together as 7-move 2x2x3. I
        spend a lot of time with this start without any good finish. The best
        was 2 twisted corners after 22 moves. Congrats Per! Doing edges first
        with 3 or more corners seems to be the most efficient method, now. Bad
        for others, Per, you&#x27;re the only one who currently masters it.
        Interestingly, edges first is one of the worst methods for speedcubing!

        Hi! Yes, indeed its the same 7-move start as Cyril struggled with. If i
        do the premove to the scramble it&#x27;s 2x2x3 in 6 moves. Otherwise
        it&#x27;s simply 7 moves, yes :-) The point doing the premove to the
        scramble though is that ur life is a whole lot easier when seeing how to
        do the rest after the otherwise pseudo block :-) I wouldn&#x27;t say i
        master that technique of all edges and 3 or more corners really. Some
        weeks i struggle and don&#x27;t find them. Usually need at least a
        couple of hrs with trial and error cause the edges end up wrong ... lol
        ... Well it&#x27;s fun when i get it to work. I often also find bad
        cases with several twisted corners or too many unsolved. That is kinda
        ok if i get 1 twisted corner and a 3-cycle. Or the rather rare 2 pure
        corner 3-cycles (6 unsolved corners). It&#x27;s more or less eqvivalent
        to finding 4 corners which is 2 2- cycles. It&#x27;s a bit more strict
        with that twisted corner cause i need to &quot;bring it out of its
        twistedness&quot; and into a 3-cycle. How i do that is to use 5
        stickers. I do like for normal pure 3-cycle put on stickers numbered 1,2
        and 3. Now i add another sticker on the cubie with 1 already on it. This
        is because the sticker 3 can move to this sticker now numbered 4. The
        last sticker i label for instance _*_ or simply 5 and put on the twisted
        corner. Now my first insertion must do one of following :
        (1,2,[5]),(2,3,[5]) or (3,4,[5]) meaning i just use the cubie with 5 on
        it, orientation of this cubie won&#x27;t matter. Please note that
        (3,1,[5]) will be really wrong. This just gives me a new case with
        3-cycle and a twisted corner again :-( Now i have a normal 3-cycle that
        i deal with the usual way :-) Ummm ... i hope this helps some at least
        :D Also, as mentioned before it&#x27;s worth trying to try solve 2 or 3
        twisted corners as a series of 2 pure 3-cycles if the start is otherwise
        good :-) I leave it to urselves to work out how. It&#x27;s not hard at
        all in principle :-) But many combinations to consider ... Have fun!

        Exactly, the same game with corners I play if I solve edges in a short
        enough way. The sticker I put on twisted corners has no number - this is
        the only (negligable) difference. It&#x27;s maybe worth to say how I
        found the 7-moves. I didn&#x27;t see them easily. First, the premove can
        be recognized as a move that puts few pieces on their final correct
        place but you don&#x27;t want to make that move because it pushes solved
        pieces apart. OK, look at scramble #93 and then the same scramble with
        additional move L&#x27; at the beginning. Now, L2 F2 R&#x27; D2 solves a
        2x2x2 part. I try to insert one move that does not make an effect on the
        2x2x2 and then see if there is any advantage of doing it or not. Here I
        tried D, D2, and D&#x27; before L2 F2 R&#x27; D2. Sure, D&#x27; wins.

        Hi Mirek :-) Very nice insertions at the end ur solution :-) I
        haven&#x27;t got round to check the &quot;no-insertion&quot; scenario
        yet. Maybe i do so tomorrow. Indeed using so long cycles u need a rather
        huge overlap for it to pay off versus inserting 8 moves w no
        cancellation. I&#x27;m still to see a scenario were inserting 8 move
        3-cycle wasn&#x27;t possible, even with no cancellation ;-) My best ever
        5-cycle insertion was 7 moves. One 7-move cancellation. And one 2-move
        cancellation. It takes damn luck to do better than that ;-) Cheers! -Per

        Thank you for noticing! What is still true that this was a very rare

        I wanted to submit this idea for a FMC to come, but I think it may be a
        bit difficult. You already know famous 2-generators like &lt;R,U>. But
        can you solve in &lt;r,U> ? (r=R+slice). On a solved cube, do a random

        Hmmm ... Set of rules? I think u know the insertion game just as well as
        i do. How good insertions we manage to get is determined by and large by
        the sequence we have found before beginning the insertions. Well
        it&#x27;s true that i normally stop searching for finding better
        insertion when i have already found best first insertion and then best
        second insertions (for scenarios which require 2 insertions). There is
        no guarantee this is the best overall insertion though. I normally have
        spent so much time finding the first sequence so that i don&#x27;t have
        time to consider all possible combinations and find global best overall
        insertion(s). But really i think u mean a set of rules for finding best
        single insertion including longer cycles then the basic 8-move ones. I
        think that&#x27;s a really hard problem. And theoretically even longer
        cycles then 12 moves might be best insertion? I don&#x27;t have any easy
        proof that that couldn&#x27;t be the case in some circumstances... One
        can only prove that the probability is really poor for that longer
        cycles than 12 moves (or even 10) will give the lowest length solution
        due to a very high number of cancelled moves. Umm i can take this one
        step further. If a very long corner 3-cycle is simply a conjugate of a
        shorter corner 3-cycle it can never be a better insertion than the
        shorter one contained in it. I think u Mirek has sorta proved this in
        the past. So the longer ones can&#x27;t be conjugates at least. They
        must be long atomic 3-cycles so to speak. Another interesting issue is
        if all corner 3-cycles must be commutators? I guess that must be the
        case. All that i have seen are. Or at least a cyclical shift of one
        (which can be proven to still be commutator). The cyclically shifted one
        might not follow the isolation principle however. Which means that that
        one part P (or Q) in the PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; pattern won&#x27;t necessarily
        change only 1 corner in some layer. Hmm... This got very technical
        towards the end. Maybe some enjoy reading it ;-) Have fun! -Per > --- In

        Hi, I was on holiday this week ... many interesting posts to read ... I
        just wanted to mention the 2x2x3 block I was speaking about in my last
        post : I did not want to give the moves at that time since the challenge
        was not closed, but it&#x27;s not the same as you mention : Scramble was
        : F2 B U&#x27; L (R2 U&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27;)*4 U&#x27; B2 R L2 (D&#x27;
        F2 B L2)*4 U2 L R F (without premove) 2x2x3 in 7 moves :
        B&#x27;L&#x27;BF2D2F&#x27;L&#x27; it&#x27;s quite self-explaining :
        while building the 2x2x2, the first 2 moves connect the other
        Corner-Edge pair. So instead of finising the 2x2x2, just put the 2 CE
        pairs in the same layer and build the 2x2x3 as two 2x3x1 blocks :-) I
        noticed that for us it&#x27;s very often much easier to find 2x2x3
        blocks as 2x2x2 + 2x2x1 ... This leaves 6 bad oriented edges that one
        could fix either with F2UD&#x27;F&#x27;U&#x27;D2RD&#x27; (getting into
        2-gen group in 15 moves) or with D&#x27;UF&#x27;DU2R&#x27;U (2x2x3 +
        orientation of the edges in 14 moves), for example. I then tried to form
        some 2x2x1 blocks but did not manage to find any good ending. I think
        after the 7 moves I should have tried to mix the orientation of the bad
        edges with the building of such blocks, but I&#x27;m not an expert with
        that approach ... Good luck to you if you want to use this week&#x27;s
        break to play with that idea ;-) cyril --- In

        Hi ! I had a go at Gilles&#x27; idea ... damn it feels insane ! I tried
        some tricks with Charles&#x27; FMC companion and here is what I found :
        (r U&#x27; r&#x27; U)*3 (r U r&#x27; U&#x27;)*3 (let&#x27;s call it C5)
        is a corner 5-cyle : all corners move except BDR. 24 moves. And should
        be quite fast to execute ... Interesting are the variations one can
        make, like (C5 U2)*2, which twists the same corners without affecting
        their position. 50 moves, let&#x27;s call it T5. ... then the
        combination with stefan&#x27;s alg T3 : (((r U&#x27; r&#x27; U)*3 (r U
        r&#x27; U&#x27;)*3) U2)*4 ((r U&#x27; r&#x27; U&#x27; r U r&#x27;
        U&#x27;)*10 U2)*2 , or (C5 U2)*4 (T3 U2)*2 , or T5*2 (T3 U2)*2 which
        twists 2 corners, that&#x27;s all ! This one may be interesting ...
        don&#x27;t forget it next time you find 2 twisted corners after a nice
        FMC start : more than 250 moves, but being slightly lucky one can
        honestly hope cancelling a few dozens ;-) Actually I wonder if these
        algs + eventually another corner 3-cycle would be sufficient to solve
        the cube. I would imply solve all edges first, then the corners ... OK,
        that was my contribution ... I gotta work now :-) cyril --- In

        We&#x27;ll think about it :-) More strange or unefficient sequences: -
        (rUr2U)6 - permutation that do not change corners - (r2U2)6 -
        permutation that do not change corners -
        rUr&#x27;UrU2r&#x27;U&#x27;r&#x27;U&#x27;rU&#x27;r&#x27;U2rU - it&#x27;s
        only two symetrical &quot;r-Sune&quot;s - (rUrUr&#x27;Ur&#x27;U)4 -
        (r2Ur2U&#x27;rUr&#x27;) (U*) (r2Ur2U&#x27;rUr&#x27;) (U*)&#x27; - a

      <strong>343. Display of our FMC solutions : a suggestion</strong><br />

        Hi, While having a look at some past FMC results, I had an idea (Dan,
        don&#x27;t be afraid, it would not take you much more time I think ...)
        A lot of us [well ... except you Gilles, who never act like the others
        when cubing :) ] find first the &quot;skeleton&quot; of the solution, a
        short sequence with some edges and/or corners out of place or flipped,
        and then fix them with corners- or edges-cycles inserted at good places.
        I don&#x27;t know if you take a real cube to have a look at these
        skeletons, but personnaly I don&#x27;t since the probability I would
        mess up in the scramble or in the solution is a bit too high :) ... and
        I think the cube applet is a really good way to present the full
        solutions. The idea would be to add another optional field in the
        submission page called &quot;basis&quot; or &quot;skeleton&quot; or
        whatever, that you Dan could use for displaying another applet next to
        the one giving the solution. I think it could be really interesting to
        learn from Per the magic of edges- first solving, or to see the blocks
        built by other competitors ... What do you think about it ? Can&#x27;t
        wait for the special #100 scramble :) cyril

        form is located on the Team FMC page, which you can find here
        http://www.necrophagous.co.uk/cubestation/fmcresults/teamfmc100.php - or
        go to the Main FMC page and click Play Team FMC#100! Lists of teams have
        been sent out already, so you should all know who you are with, and have
        made contact with them. Any problems, please let me know by sending a
        mail to teamfmc@... Also, a new regular scramble (FMC #95) has been
        launched also, so if you need to practice, now is the ideal week to get
        some in! Good Luck! Dan :)

        Guys! Nevermind that that post was sorta spam. The demo at their site is
        great! U can test out cubes up to 9x9x9 in very nice 3D. A bit like java
        applets but much nicer graphics. For those who can&#x27;t wait for the
        6x6x6 olympicube it&#x27;s well worth checking out. Maybe i should speak
        to those guys about implementing super-supercubing. Hehe ;-) Cheers!

        Just in case you are interested, here are the rules of our team for what
        I called the ultimate blindfolded-like team solve : of course, you can
        adapt them in your team ... Our solution is growing, it&#x27;s really
        funny to see the complementarity :) cyril - each of us can add up to 4
        moves to the current partial solution. Gilles, your slice moves count as
        one move - one can propose moves that undo one or more moves - when one
        has added some moves to the partial solution, any other team member can
        continue (otherwise it might be a bit long ...) - one can add premoves
        (or setup moves) before the scramble. This counts as one move. - I claim
        we can use FMC companion here : http://www.necrophagous.co.
        uk/cubestation/fmcresults/teamfmccomp2_1/fmccomp.php to avoid too much
        scrambling ... - of course, no constructive comment about the added
        moves is allowed :) --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi! I think the point about no constructive comments defeats the object
        of what u try to achieve ;-) Fewest moves is different from
        speedsolving. Doing a few moves there u could hope the other will
        recognize which case u are doing according to how far u are in the
        solution (well-defined steps). But hey, you can change that later.
        It&#x27;s easier to follow up moves if u know the idea/plan behind the
        previous moves made. I can of coz understand why u wanted that rule
        also. Not to restrict urselves too much :-) Cheers! -Per > --- In

        Greetings, We want to thank everyone from the online cubing community
        who has been kind enough to send us their comments, ideas, and
        suggestions. Over the past week, we have accumulated some great ideas
        from you folks as to how we can make our product better! Please keep
        sending us feedback and continue to try out the new versions as we post
        them. The biggest change in the new version is related to the comments
        we&#x27;ve received about wanting an alternate method of orienting your
        view of the cube. So, without losing the existing freedom of rotation,
        we have added a secondary way to change your view of the cube. Holding
        down the left shift key while rotating a slice of the cube will turn the
        *entire* cube 90 degrees (or 180 if you also have the left CTRL key
        down) in the same axis/direction the single slice would have moved. This
        eases the ability to &#x27;flip&#x27; the cube around and see the
        backside without losing your current perspective on the cube. Thanks to
        Joël van Noort for this suggestion! An in-game help screen has been
        added that details all the available controls as well. The change log
        for the demo project is now posted on the downloads page of our website
        (http://www.gabbasoft.com) if anyone is interested in seeing everything
        that has been modified to date. Again, thanks so much for all of your
        input and we hope you will continue to send us your thoughts and ideas
        for making our product better. Regards, Jamey Pittman President

        Greetings, I can&#x27;t believe how many requests we&#x27;ve received
        about the desire for larger cubes! Of course, I should have known better
        after I saw that someone in Japan had solved the 9x9x9 in a little over
        2 hours and posted the screenshots on his site. So, as of this release,
        we now support cube sizes up to 20x20x20. I would certainly expect that
        performance will noticably degrade on slower/older systems when you get
        up to 15x15x15 and above but you are free to give `em a try. Ton from
        Speedcubing.com made the request for changing the timer behavior to wait
        until the first move is made after a scramble to start  seemed to be a
        good idea to me so that has been added as well. We&#x27;ve also received
        enough comments about the moving background making people dizzy to
        change it and make it static  we hope you like it better! You can get
        the latest version from our downloads page:

        Greetings, Our newest cube demo (ver 0.03.0007) includes (among other
        changes) supercube versions for every puzzle size! It is available now
        on our website (http://www.gabbasoft.com). Although not originally
        something we had considered doing, you online cubers have been so
        wonderful about sharing your ideas and comments with us that we wanted
        to make something just for you: the only folks we know that might not
        cry at the thought of solving a 20x20x20 supercube. We also increased
        the range of the timer and move counters to accomodate the larger cube
        sizes. So enjoy and keep the suggestions coming!! Thanks again, Jamey

        Hi guys !! Since it&#x27;s creating so much havoc to have luck in a
        short solution im now retiring from FMC. I am spending hours and hours
        each week working on block starts and edge-first starts. I sometimes
        produce more than 10 different edges- first starts before i get useful
        corners so that i can carry on with insertions. Over the last 20 or so
        normal FMC&#x27;s i have produced maybe closer to 200 edges-first
        starts. The chance of getting a &quot;lucky&quot; corner after having 3
        corners is 1/6*1/3 (position and orientation repectively). Working on
        all those starts of mine one or more lucky corners are bound to happen.
        And yes i agree it might seem like magic. But im ditching closer to 95%
        of my edges-first starts due to bad corners. When i can&#x27;t find a
        useful edges-first start i go for the slightly worse 2x2x3 block start
        which is a lot easier to find. And this produces on average a 2 moves
        longer solution. Both of those starts let me do corner insertions in the
        end which is my favorite way of fewest moves. And it should be proven
        already it&#x27;s one of the best ways also. As explained to Dan there
        is no way i can explain that sometimes i get 2 &quot;lucky&quot;
        corners. But to carry on reasoning the odds is not that bad : 1/(18*15).
        So ok it&#x27;s happened twice i got 2 &quot;lucky&quot; corners. This
        should have taken me 540 solves and i have achieved it after 200 solves.
        I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a crime. Take care everyone :-) -Per

        a crime, I shouldn&#x27;t go back home tonight. Gunmen, tanks and

        attempts are independent (not obvious, since you make ~10 on each cube),
        the probability of /not/ getting 2 lucky corners on a given cube is q =
        (1 - 1/(15*18))^10 = 0.9636 Probability of never getting 2 lucky corners
        in 20 cubes is q^20 = 0.476 Probability of getting 2 lucky corners
        exactly once in 20 cubes is 20*(1-q)*q^19 = 0.360 Probability of it
        happening twice /or more/ times = 0.164 So what happened is about as
        lucky as getting a &quot;six&quot; in a single throw of a die. No big
        deal. Mike

        [That was assuming that the &quot;luckily&quot; solved corners have to
        be a particular pair -- the probability will be considerably higher if
        it can be any pair.] As for being left with a 3-cycle after solving
        edges and (intentionally) solving 2 corners -- is that the
        &quot;disputed&quot; case? -- there are 2*binomial(6,3)=40 ways for this
        to happen out of 6!/2 = 360 permutations. Taking into acount the
        orientations as well, the probability of it happening on one attempt is
        (40/360)*(1/3)^6 = 1/6561, corresponding to about a 3% chance of it
        happening once in 200 trials. Again, it&#x27;s not outrageously
        improbable... and the chances could be much higher if you are keeping an
        eye on those 6 corners as you solve the first two. Mike

        Hi, As much as i like to see the talk about probabilities, its not the
        real issue here. I asked Per as nicely as possible to shed some more
        light on his 14 move start, which is standard practice for solutions as
        short as that one, if anything so that other people can appreciate why
        the person went the way he/she did. Per,in my opinion completely
        overreacted when asked this, refused to explain and share his secret,
        got very defensive and &quot;retired&quot; from FMC. How am I expected
        to respond? I hope Per, that you will contiue to work with your team for

        Sorry, Dan -- I didn&#x27;t realize that the issue was the short
        &quot;start&quot;. Although it&#x27;s remarkable that 14 turns is
        optimal for solving everything except the corners DLB/UFR/UBL, it
        presumably is not optimal for solving edges and 2 corners. It would
        certainly be fun to know how the reasoning works, if this kind of thing
        can actually be analysed. But it might be rather like asking a gymnast
        /exactly/ how a backwards somersault is executed, in the hope that a
        verbal description will make it easier to do it oneself. ;) Mike --- In

        that participation in FMC will increase! Don&#x27;t worry Dan,
        there&#x27;s two new participants, if I&#x27;m not mistaken. I will soon
        start again if I find a time where I can schedule FMC-ing. I&#x27;m not
        that busy, but I will probably soon be. And if nobody takes part in FMC,
        you can just make the same scramble go on and on until somebody submits.
        There&#x27;s been no blank FMC until now, has there? Sebastian

        Hi everyone, I&#x27;ve been thinking a little recently. shock. I think
        it would be nice to have ratings for all 4 metrics, and some statistics
        pages, but don&#x27;t know what yet. If a player is inactive for 6
        months, he or she will have their rating removed, and will have to start
        afresh. I also think it would be nice to have some little history pages
        for each competitor, but I will need to think about that some more, to
        work out if it&#x27;s worth the extra effort :P Let me know what you

        Hi Mike :-) In fact i believe those scrambles are no longer generated by
        hand but by my scrambler program. Dan used to make hand-made scrambles
        for quite a while actually. My scrambler has flexible options for
        generating scrambles in the typical FMC style with repeating parts of
        various lenghts and also flexible number of parts. With a part i mean a
        non-repeating sequence, then a repeating sequence, then non- repeating
        again ... etc ... Unfortunately it&#x27;s not perfect wrt move
        cancellations and/or anomalies in the repeating parts, since it was made
        as a simple extension to my normal scrambler. There are repeating parts
        in order that setting up a scramble will be easier than a plain vanilla
        25/30 move sequence. So it&#x27;s basically still human responsibility
        to check that generated scrambles are ok, as long as i haven&#x27;t
        fixed those mentioned problems in my scrambler. Cheers! -Per > --- In

        Hi! You mean so that not the total sequence will be too long? Well it is
        already somewhat restricted. U select values from dropdown comboboxes.

        Hi! Oh, the scrambler is not so advanced that it checks the cyclic
        decomposition of a sequence. That might maybe be useful. It&#x27;s not
        very likely to encouter a part where the sequence will pass by identity
        with the built-in available &quot;orders&quot;. Ok, say u have the
        simplest style : a [b]*k1 c [d]*k2 e If symmetric is unchecked and u
        have say k1=2 and k2=3. If u check symmetric again k2 changes to 3 (same
        as k1). For symmetry with this style length of a must be same as length
        of e, length of b same as length of d, and we must have k1=k2.
        Equivalently for the longer style. The options built in are mostly to
        satisfy Dan&#x27;s specifications. Pluss some of my own ideas ;-)

      <strong>383. My quarterturn only FMC#99 solution!</strong><br />

        Hi everyone! For FMC#99 the scramble was : D2 B&#x27; F U&#x27; L
        (R&#x27; D U2 B2 U2 )*3 D2 F2 L F&#x27; (B D&#x27; R2 D B&#x27; )*3 U
        L&#x27; B D2 R&#x27; My solution started like this : U&#x27; L&#x27; D B
        D B L&#x27; F&#x27; B L B D F.R This leaves 5 corners to be solved. I
        fix this with 2 corner 3-cycle insertions like this : first insert
        F&#x27; U&#x27; B U F:U&#x27; B&#x27; U at the dot and then a rather
        long D R B&#x27; L B R&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27; B D&#x27; at the colon to
        make sure to use only quarterturns all the way :D So the final solution
        is then : U&#x27; L&#x27; D B D B L&#x27; F&#x27; B L B D U&#x27; B U F
        D R B&#x27; L B R&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27; B D&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; U R It
        was very fun to have achieved this. My submitted best solution was 3
        moves shorter (and used some half turns ... lol). Cheers! -Per

        Hi everyone, I&#x27;m really sorry for the lack of updates to the
        website and FMC recently. Please don&#x27;t be too hard on me, but I
        have been swamped with work at the beginning of the university term, and
        because I have lagged a bit on my project, I really need to get some
        speed up with that too. FMC is going to be put on hold for a little

        In a solution (r2R) counts as 2 HTM, and 3 SQTM. But if you write it
        (Mr&#x27;), it may count as 3 HTM and 2 SQTM. I think this kind of
        questions has been asked before. What did you decide, the competitor has
        to choose to optimize for the metric he wants, or did you consider that
        since the solutions are identical you can compute the lowest score for
        each metric? Gilles.

        Umm ... That question is actually very interesting and relevant. For
        normal competitions the metric is htm so it wouldn&#x27;t matter. There
        will be a clear UDFBRL notation when converted to that by for instance
        the FMC companion. But since the metric is now a combined one it does
        matter. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to resolve this but i guess u have
        to write it both (all) ways and get the metrics from FMC companion and
        see what comes out shorter ... So yes it is the competitor
        responsibility to make the solution as short as possible by notational
        tricks :-) -Per > --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        I won. Not sure about the other positions, or even how the score was

        only had 60 minutes. My 39: R B D&#x27; B2 U&#x27; B&#x27; R B&#x27; L U
        B U2 I don&#x27; t know about you, but full 2x2x3 block with edges

        R U2 And I have to finish with just a plain LL solve in 17 painful

        Congrats Lars ;-) This must have been fun ... though one hour is really
        short when you are under pressure, I guess ! Congratulations to the
        other contestants as well: even if you probably could not use all FMC
        techniques your master like insertions or edges-first approach (!), the
        names of the finalists shows that these rules allowed the best of us to
        compete for the victory! Did you all used block approaches like
        Lars&#x27; speedsolving method ? Or did you manage to end up with cycles
        and insertions in that short time ? Btw, Dan ... any results for FMC
        #100 ? Do you figure out how we are waiting for them :) ?!? And now we

        I don&#x27;t have the scramble from day 2, but here is my 38 move
        solution. you&#x27;ll have to backtrack through it. D&#x27; U&#x27; L2 B
        U&#x27; L2 R U&#x27; R F R U&#x27; F&#x27; U F U F2 U F2 U2 F2 U&#x27; L
        D&#x27; L&#x27; U L D L&#x27; U R2 L2 D2 B&#x27; D2 R2 L2 U&#x27; Move
        by move analysis: Just like the first scramble, it was pretty
        unfriendly. It really couldn&#x27;t see any good beginning, so I started
        by looking hard at each corner for a good 2x2x2 start. Only the last
        gave something useful, but it was really good: U&#x27; L2 B U&#x27; L2.
        Fine as far as that went, but the resulting position was again useless.
        So I tried a &quot;stir and see what happens&quot; technique I use
        sometimes. While building the 2x2x2, you can move any layer that does
        not contain any of the 4 pieces that will make up the 2x2x2 block. In
        this case, you can move D before move 0, 1 and 2, and also R before move
        3. That&#x27;s 9 different ways you can change things. After checking
        the third one, I didn&#x27;t have to look any further: D&#x27; U&#x27;
        L2 B U&#x27; L2 R U&#x27; R F R. That&#x27;s even one move better than
        my first round! I looked at a few continuations, none of which turned
        out well, and then I realized I had only 15 minutes left and not even a
        single solution to show. So I tried to stop looking for perfection, and
        just finish this thing off. First try was U&#x27; F&#x27; U F U F2 U F2
        U2 F2 U&#x27;. I don&#x27;t usually go for &quot;pseudo&quot; solutions,
        but times were desperate. If you look through the mixed up colors,
        you&#x27;ll see this is a basic corner commutator (I call it Evelyn
        (http://lar5.com/cube/yE.html)), and 4 opposite edges to switch.
        Normally I&#x27;d try to insert them and probably cancel several moves,
        but when I had done them in place, written down the full resulting
        solution and double checked it, the time was out. At least one move
        cancelled between them. - - - - - - - - - - - - &quot;He who refuses to

        Hi! To set up the second scramble use the following moves : R2 U D

        Hi Lars! I checked ur second day solution and played with it for a
        little while. From ur first 9 moves i simply changed the last R turn to
        a half turn like this : D&#x27; U&#x27; L2 B U&#x27; L2 R U&#x27; R2
        Then i continue with D&#x27; F U2 F&#x27;:D Now i finish off the 5 edges
        with L D [L&#x27;.L] R&#x27; F R L&#x27; U&#x27;.L D&#x27; L&#x27;,
        where the first 3 moves sets up the well known 6-move edge 5-cycle and 2
        moves also cancel nicely. The remaining 3 corners are dealt with by
        U&#x27; R&#x27; U L2 U&#x27; R U L2 inserted at the colon, easy to see
        this since the edge 5-cycle is not doing anything. In fact the edge
        5-cycle can be done straight after the corner 3-cycle since the last D
        doesn&#x27;t move any of the 5 cycled edges. This trick cancels one more
        move. The final solution is then : D&#x27; U&#x27; L2 B U&#x27; L2 R
        U&#x27; R2 D&#x27; F U2 F&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U L2 U&#x27; R U L&#x27;
        D R&#x27; F R L&#x27; U&#x27; L D&#x27; L&#x27; D (31-htm, 30 stm, 36
        qtm) Pretty good from what seemed like a hard scramble :-) There should
        also be a better corner insertion somewhere, but this is too hard to see
        not allowing stickers being used. Cheers! We&#x27;d make a great team
        Lars ;-) -Per > --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com, Lars Petrus

        Hi Alexander :-) I also played a little with your first day solution.
        Here is what i found: I started with ur first 12 moves R B D&#x27; L2
        F&#x27; D F L&#x27; B U&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27;. Then i extended with the
        following: D&#x27; R&#x27; D R&#x27; B&#x27;. This leaves a postponed R
        move only. Luckily the corners are all solved! Here i insert a 10-move
        LL edge algorithm i know : B R U R2 U&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; R2
        D. This cancels 4 moves and leaves an easy edge 3-cycle R2 U&#x27; D B2
        U D&#x27; which cancels 1 more move with the postponed R. The final
        solution is then : R B D&#x27; L2 F&#x27; D F L&#x27; B U&#x27; B&#x27;
        U&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; D U R2 U&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; R2 D
        R&#x27; U&#x27; D B2 U D&#x27; (29 htm, 27 stm, 33 qtm) Woow! Had u only
        found that :-) [My solutions, i don&#x27;t have them cause i didn&#x27;t
        have time copy them to separate paper :-( ] Cheers! -Per > --- In

        Hi! You are priviliged to learn them now. I dare say that the 6 move 5-
        cycle for the edges R L&#x27; F R&#x27; L D&#x27; is trivial. It&#x27;s
        maybe easier to see this as M D M&#x27; D&#x27;. Use a second cube to
        see how it works, cause not too easy to remember just like that :-) It
        can be used to solve 2,3 or more edges in very few moves, often with
        cancellations too :-) Ending w a bunch of edges is often not too bad
        also ;-) Cheers! -Per > --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        Hmm!! ... Gilles, was this ur first attempt at speedsolving the
        scramble? A method which averages 39 htm seems awesome to me. I guess
        you were a bit lucky if it really was ur first speedsolve of this
        scramble. I&#x27;m a bit embarassed with my first day solve now ... ;-)
        I gotta practice 1 hr solving. It&#x27;s not like either normal FMC or
        the speed FMC. One needs a good plan to succeed :-) -Per PS! How can u
        recall ur moves after a speedsolve? I would not be able to do that.
        I&#x27;d get lost recalling what i did in the middle of the solve ... >

        bad! Yes bad :-) Doesn&#x27;t solve it. Tried it by hand and with

        good that you solve the cube in 4 seconds and take the remaining 10 to

        Just after a solve, I can remember what I did pretty well. I can&#x27;t
        write down the moves, but I can replay the solve on a similar cube.
        Can&#x27;t you? Since I already spent 15s on the first block,
        remembering the choice is easy. But sometimes I may have problems
        finding the same solution again for the 2nd block (especially when you
        panic and do stupid useless moves, but in these cases, you don&#x27;t
        want to replay your ugly solve!). The 3rd and 4th steps are almost
        straightforward. When you always solve your cubes following a set of
        fuzzy rules, all you have to record is very few choices and rare
        exceptions. I suck at memorization. Stefan, you are a genius(*) is that
        the kind of things you can easily remember? Gilles. (*) ;-)

        Hmm !! There are ways to force ur brain to think faster. I have used
        this technique both for minesweeper and also speedsolving 4by and 5by
        cube. The principle is rather easy. If ur brain hasn&#x27;t still
        decided what to do. Just let ur hands do &quot;something&quot; as a
        &quot;random best choice&quot; that will not be destructive. Eventually
        when practicing this ur brain will become faster and be forced to get up
        to speed w ur hands. This is how i have cut down my time considerably on
        the 5x5x5 solving. It really helps your lookahead quite incredibly.
        Don&#x27;t be afraid to do the wrong stuff with ur hands. U will quickly
        get better at it. Im not sure this way of practicing will really work on
        the 3x3x3 since a solve is way too fast. The fastest 3x3x3 methods
        already are quite tabular and the recognition methods are fairly
        established. So it&#x27;s less intuitive than larger cube solving. Well
        this is true for my cage method anyway. This way of practicing to become
        faster did help lower my minesweeper expert level time from 100 down to
        only 60. The best guys do low 40&#x27;s however and i have no idea how
        they do that ... lol ... Cheers! -Per > --- In

        Hi Alexander :) There is a nice 3-corner cycle that I learnt on this
        forum that can be quite handy ... The most trivial (well ... once you
        know this one) &quot;insertion&quot; is to apply it at the end of our
        solve : D U R&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; F2 U B D B&#x27;
        D&#x27; L&#x27; U B&#x27; D2 B D&#x27; R D&#x27; R&#x27;
        (F&#x27;R&#x27;BRFR&#x27;B&#x27;R) (31,34,31,34) It&#x27;s a &quot;10
        seconds&quot; ending to your solution, I&#x27;ll try if I find some more
        time to insert it elsewhere and cancel moves ;) I nearly never got stuck
        when looking for corners insertions with only two algs + L/R mirrors :
        that one and the classical L&#x27;URU&#x27;LUR&#x27;U&#x27;... that
        takes me ages but this is usually not the hardest part of the job !

        Nice solution, Per, finishing with edges. I finally tried one hour
        search for the shortest solution, too. I could not create the stress of
        the competition, though. What I found within half an hour was 2 layers
        in 18-moves as R2 U L2 F D2_ R&#x27; U L&#x27; F R U R&#x27; F R&#x27; D
        F&#x27; D&#x27; F and after B R&#x27; B&#x27; R D R D&#x27; R&#x27;_
        R&#x27; L&#x27; D2 R D R&#x27; D2 L D&#x27; R, I got (35,40). Then I
        modified the first 18 moves a little to R2 U L2 F D2 R&#x27; U L&#x27; F
        R U R&#x27; F_ D F&#x27; D&#x27; F R&#x27;, permuted the last layer
        pieces L&#x27; D&#x27; L D&#x27; L&#x27; D2 L D2 and finished the easy
        orientation D2 L D L2 F L F2 D F . Altogether, it&#x27;s R2 U L2 F D2
        R&#x27; U L&#x27; F R U R&#x27; F D F&#x27; D&#x27; F R&#x27; L&#x27;
        D&#x27; L D&#x27; L&#x27; D2 L2 D L2 F L F2 D F (32,40) which I had
        luckily in about 53 minutes. With the second day scramble I was not
        doing very good and couldn&#x27;t improve a 38-HTM (that I had in about
        35 min) move within one hour. I don&#x27;t post it here because
        it&#x27;s not any interesting. It was 4 corner ending. Mirek --- In

        Tnx the end part i did find but i was looking for a good insertion. The
        one that tsai has found i could not find :( it was a very easy one but i
        did not see it. i was more looking for something like when i have in my
        solution for example R.D to look for a insertion that start with R&#x27;
        and end with D&#x27; but never was thinking of for just looking to
        cancel 1 move. i was hoping to find a much nicer insert but i have not
        found that yet :( for more cancelation :) greets Alexander --- In

        Hi Mirek :-) Really nice 18-move f2l. And yes a rather lucky finish with
        2 easy short algs with some cancelled moved :-) There is always some
        luck with short solutions. 32 moves i consider short for only 1 hr and
        no stickers. I&#x27;m too slow for 1 hr solving. Need to practice it.
        Umm ... i recall i did that Dallas (??) fewest moves scramble in 33
        moves in like 25 minutes. But that was a nice scramble ;-) I would like
        to see ur solution with 4 corner finish. I wonder if u found some good
        cancellations by not using stickers. Ans also if u had 3-cycle and a
        twisted corner or 2 2-cycles :-) -Per > --- In

        Hi fellowship .... ;-) Browsing through ur interesting discussions for
        FMC #100 i found the following start: F&#x27; R D R&#x27; D&#x27;
        B&#x27; D2 L U L&#x27; D2 L&#x27; R B&#x27; L R&#x27; You seem to have

        U B&#x27; U&#x27; F U2 B&#x27; U D&#x27; gives 3 twisted corners in
        (25,28,22,25) This is better than ur other nearly good solution with
        also 3 twisted corners :D Cheers! -Per PS! We also had a bunch of

        Hi Per ! Did you visit the forum on my website ? We found it really
        handy for exchanging information about this horrible scramble. Everyone
        is free to post as guest on ths forum ... Btw I found another frustratig
        solution last week : {F B&#x27;} D&#x27; L B L&#x27; U&#x27; D2 B R2 B2
        U&#x27; F&#x27; U L&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; leaves 5 corners after 17
        moves. I found two fantastically lousy insertions to end up with
        (30,36,29,35), but I&#x27;m really sure it&#x27;s possible to finish
        under 30 ! {F B&#x27;} D&#x27; (D&#x27;FUF&#x27;DFU&#x27;F&#x27;) L B
        L&#x27; U&#x27; D2 B R2 B2 U&#x27; F&#x27; U L&#x27; F&#x27;
        (UL&#x27;D2LU&#x27;L&#x27;D2) (30,36,29,35) or {F B&#x27;} D&#x27; L B
        L&#x27; U&#x27; D2 B R2 B2 U&#x27; F&#x27; U L&#x27; F&#x27; (U
        L&#x27;D2 L (LF&#x27;R&#x27;FL&#x27;F&#x27;RF) U&#x27;L&#x27;D2)
        (30,36,29,35) I found interesting to post our partial solutions as well,
        since I know that you, Mirek and others are always glad to demonstrate
        that we could have done better ;) What do you think of our incredible
        ultimate team solve ? I wish there is such a competition at EC2006 or
        WC2007 ;) Thanks Dan for the results, that was really fun to compete in
        teams (although I still can&#x27;t imagine how you managed to produce
        such a frustrating scramble, I was expecting UWR broken by at least half
        of the teams before you published it), I&#x27;ll miss Gilles and Lars
        for the next challenges I guess ... Congrats to all participants, I
        noticed some speedcubers&#x27; names in the results table, cool :D cyril

        Hi ;.) I think your group was more or less the only one that was working
        really well together as a team. Lars&#x27; no-insertion 27-move solution
        is really cool. Wow, you are still working on that scramble, that&#x27;s
        crazy ... lol ... Yes i found that start of yours from ur discussion
        forum :-) Actually, my best ever near-solution with only 2 twisted
        corners was 17 moves. This was quite a while ago, and i guess i&#x27;d
        find it if i browse past fmc results. It was found using insertions with
        stickers and backtracking. Saving 3 moves on inserting 2 corner 3-cycles
        is not very good, yes. But i have seen worse scenarios ... However, my
        best insertion of a corner 5-cycle was using only 7 moves (cancelling 9)

        Hi Dan ! Ur site is pretty much up already. As far as i can see all that
        needs to be done is to fix some links for the navigation of the site. U
        can actually &quot;future-proof&quot; this by using relative links and
        virtual directories. I suppose ur new site lets u use virtual
        directories?? Just an idea anyway. I know you probably not gonna move
        yet once more in the near future :-) -Per

        Hi Gilles, I participated to my first FMC 1 year ago for the special
        Xmas FMC (btw Dan, are you going to organise another one this year ?)
        ... 47 moves for solving the cube, quite pathetic ;-) Now I average
        around 29-32 I guess, mainly because : 1) I re-learnt Petrus solution
        instead of trying to work with Fridrich related methods 2) I better
        understand the edges orientation step of his method 3) I better
        &quot;see&quot; and follow the 2x2x3 pieces while I&#x27;m building it
        4) I learnt about setup moves and pseudo-blocks 5) I learnt about
        commutators for corners and basic edges cycles 6) I&#x27;ve been quite
        lucky while solving the cube like : 2x2x3, edges orientation, 2 2x2x1,
        last 3 edges, insert a commutator for the last 3 corners 7) I now spent
        MUCH MORE time on the scrambles 8) It allows me for getting lucky more
        often ... There are many other ways like edges-first solutions (Per is
        the only specialist on Earth I think), STM optimisation (Gilles R. has
        been trying for years to change the official metric since his method is
        incredible for this), 2-Generator finish (Charles, Sebastian are
        specialists). I guess the best is to begin slowly and aim good Petrus
        solves. Then learn some other techniques like insertions and pseudo
        blocks, this forum is full of posts about them ;-) Good luck ! cyril ---

        Hi all, I don&#x27;t post on the FMC forum very often, but Cyril! our
        solutions are identical in approach! The one thing I&#x27;ve been
        working on a bit (and haven&#x27;t had a chance to apply it yet in FMC)
        is watching edge orientation very early in the solve. I&#x27;ve been
        trying to solve a 2x2x3 block+have all edges oriented. I&#x27;ve been
        inconsistent in this, but it seems promising. --- Cyril Castella

        Hi :-) And add to that list of tools and tricks the most useful one for
        me : - INSERTIONS !! Without those i would never have achieved all my
        really short solutions. The prime candidates for insertion are corner or
        edge 3- cycles. But any algorithm that shifts few pieces around are good
        candidates for trying to find some insertion for them that will give
        move cancellations. I guess starting with looking into corner 3- cycle
        insertions is ur best bet. It&#x27;s not all that hard when putting
        stickers (numbered) on the corners to be cycles in such a way that the
        orientation is correct. There are many posts in this groups about this
        topc. Just search for them :-) Some more hints: - cross first with
        clever c/e inserts can be good. Use slanting corner technique when
        needed - starting w 2x2x2 block is also good (better), gives many
        options - if you can do directly a 2x2x3 and skipping the 2x2x2 it can
        save u moves, but this requires more experience - the ultimate method
        for me now is doing &quot;edges first&quot;, this however takes me ages
        and is impossible timewise in competitions - generally i always aim for
        a start (skeleton solution) where i am left with a few cycles (edges or
        corners) to be done w insertions - basic insight into &quot;cycle
        structures&quot; is also useful, for instance ending with corner 5-cycle
        is not any worse than ending w corner 3- cycle and a twisted corner,
        both are dealt with by 2 3-cycles .. and so on ... - advanced techniques
        : scramble premove(s), solve the inverse scramble instead, use the
        &quot;put all into one layer and solve it&quot;- method ... There is
        lots of fun in the world of fewest moves ;-) Cheers! -Per > --- In

        Be careful Gilles, you should not try #100 scramble, that one was one of
        the toughest Dan had ever proposed ;-) But I would advise to choose one
        of the latest FMC scrambles, so you can compare with other solutions
        once you&#x27;ve come up with yours ... Per, I was speaking about
        insertions when I mentioned commutators, I should have made things
        clearer :) Btw, what would be the optimal way (in terms of optimisation
        time/number of cancelled moves) one should use for inserting 2
        corner-cycles, for example for solving 1 5-cycle ? Let&#x27;s call the
        corners to be cycled 1-2-3-4-5 (in that order) I usually look for the
        best 1-2-3 cycle, then for the best 1-4-5 remaing cycle, then I look
        only for groovy insertions of other &quot;primary&quot; cycle (2-3-4,
        3-4-5 or 4-5-1), and eventually look further if they are REALLY
        promising. What about your strategy ? Do you always check all
        &quot;primary cycles&quot; before trying to complete the solution ? I
        usually try to avoid 5-cycles, since I know it is usually very long for
        me ... cyril

        Hi! I put stickers on all 5 corners then and look for best insertion for
        all 5 candidates at every insertion point. It&#x27;s not all that hard
        but yes not trivially easy either. Looking at 5 different ones at every
        step requires full concentration to not miss anything. Then i pick the
        best insertion and then i look for the remaining insert. So i can&#x27;t
        really be sure it&#x27;s the global optimum insert scheme :-( Cheers!

        Hi :-) I agree. Now would be a perfect time to get going with a new
        challenge that we can enjoy over the holiday seasons. But actually, we
        could just launch a scramble here in the group. We don&#x27;t HAVE to
        wait for Dan to organise it, but his consent would be nice. I understand
        his new site is coming very soon also. It was really nice with the

        Hi :-) Yes, good idea. It&#x27;s not all that hard to put together only
        the edges. Much harder though, to do it while also managing to pull

        Hi guys :-) At http://www.svekub.se they have launched a 2x2x2 fewest
        moves challenge. The scramble is as follows : B R B&#x27; R&#x27;
        F&#x27; R&#x27; F L D B R F R2 B&#x27; U2 L D&#x27; B2 L&#x27; F2
        L&#x27; U2 B2 D B&#x27; So far i have done a 10-move solution.
        Let&#x27;s see how well u guys can do it. Send your solutions to
        perkrif(at]idi(dot]ntnu(dot]no For those of you who can read swedish i
        have posted my solution here: (spoils some fun ... )

        Hi everyone! The FMC is back for Christmas! This year, similar to last
        year, we will have a special challenge over Christmas. This year there
        are a few more events, but the format is the same! You have to find the
        shortest solution for each category; you can take part in as many or as
        few events as you wish! The categories are: * Shortest solution to
        complete one face * Shortest solution to complete one layer (not a
        middle layer) * Shortest solution to any 1x2x3 block (a Roux block) *
        Shortest solution to 2 complete Roux blocks (Roux step 2.) * Shortest
        solution to any 2x2x2 block * Shortest solution to any 2x2x3 block *
        Shortest solution to the F2L * Shortest solution to solve all edges *
        Shortest solution to solve all corners * Shortest solution to the whole
        cube You have two weeks in which to submit your entries, and the
        competition details and the scramble can all be found at my website -
        www.cubestation.co.uk &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/> and follow the

        I think the theoretical answer is that &quot;It depends on the
        position&quot;. Here is a similar question, that may be what you&#x27;re
        trying to ask (but I doubt it): What is the shortest non trivial case
        where two different algorithms of the same length produce the same
        position? I believe there is a LL case with two different 8 move algs
        solving the same position. There are probably shorter examples for the
        general case. /Lars On Dec 24, 2005, at 9:55, Stefan Pochmann wrote: >

        Yeah, my wording was a bit unfortunate. What I meant was a rule like
        this: &quot;Every non-stupid solution with 5 moves or less is
        optimal.&quot; That is, a guarantee over all cube states. The task is is
        to find the correct number (5 is just a guess). It&#x27;s indeed similar
        to your question. Obviously if N doesn&#x27;t give you an
        optimality-guarantee, then neither does N+1. So it&#x27;s valid for all
        numbers 0..G and not for G+1..infinity and we have to find that G. The
        number G+1 is the smallest number that doesn&#x27;t guarantee
        optimality, meaning there&#x27;s a cube state that can be solved in G+1
        moves (your solution) but also in fewer moves (optimal solution).
        Here&#x27;s proof that length 7 is *no* guarantee for optimality:
        U&#x27; R U&#x27; B U B&#x27; R&#x27; can be achieved shorter with F
        R&#x27; F&#x27; R U&#x27; Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Hi :-) R&#x27; D&#x27; R F D2 L can be achieved with D2 F L D&#x27;
        Thats the shortest one i know ;-) And then also : R&#x27; D&#x27; R F D2
        can be achieved with D2 F L D&#x27; L&#x27; (can split as desired ... )
        So, yes maybe 4 is the maximum ... hmm ?? I guess that several optimal
        solutions should be allowed. Uniquely minimal is not necessary. Cheers!

        guaranteed optimality under N moves ? Yeah, my wording was a bit
        unfortunate. What I meant was a rule like this: &quot;Every non-stupid
        solution with 5 moves or less is optimal.&quot; That is, a guarantee
        over all cube states. The task is is to find the correct number (5 is
        just a guess). It&#x27;s indeed similar to your question. Obviously if N
        doesn&#x27;t give you an optimality-guarantee, then neither does N+1. So
        it&#x27;s valid for all numbers 0..G and not for G+1..infinity and we
        have to find that G. The number G+1 is the smallest number that
        doesn&#x27;t guarantee optimality, meaning there&#x27;s a cube state
        that can be solved in G+1 moves (your solution) but also in fewer moves
        (optimal solution). Here&#x27;s proof that length 7 is *no* guarantee
        for optimality: U&#x27; R U&#x27; B U B&#x27; R&#x27; can be achieved
        shorter with F R&#x27; F&#x27; R U&#x27; Cheers! Stefan --- In

        I do not cube following Gilles&#x27; method, but I propose to assume

        Hi everyone, good point, I did not consider it too carefully. Please
        correct me if I am wrong Gilles, for it&#x27;s pretty likely... I think
        what happens is that you are allowed to create any 1x2x3 blocks as long
        as they finish up situated in the same position with respect to the cube
        itself, not the colours. On the page
        http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Step_2.html Gilles tells us &quot;The
        number of moves can be reduced by choosing the easiest 1x2x3 block
        belonging to R-side.&quot; This suggests to me that you are allowed to
        choose any of the 4 possible 1x2x3 blocks which you could build opposite
        the first 1x2x3 block. However, in practice, I&#x27;m sure it is far
        easier to (and as Gilles also implies) analyse the 3rd step if you make
        the 1x2x3 blocks match up nicely. And it looks nicer. So it is for this
        aesthetic reason that I have decided that for the event &quot;solve 2
        Roux blocks&quot; I would like the 2 blocks to finish up in a completely
        solved position. This means they have to be on opposite faces, and they
        have to be totally aligned with the centres, and they must both sit on
        the bottom of the cube. Please see the diagram here:
        http://grrroux.free.fr/method/steps_2.gif - to see this visually. I will
        add this to the FMC page, I realise that this probably isn&#x27;t true
        Roux blocks but that&#x27;s the final word. Dan :) --- In

        your description says all six centers must be solved, but in
        Gilles&#x27; method it&#x27;s only the L and R centers, which is also
        emphasized in the picture you linked to. So please clarify what you
        mean. I vote for L/R centers only (in addition to matching blocks). The
        result should look like the result in the six applets on the bottom of
        this page: http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Step_2.html (except using a
        different color scheme, of course) Cheers! Stefan

        Hi Stefan :-) Good point. I also found the diagram didn&#x27;t really
        match what dan had said. In the spirit of the roux method i also suggest
        that the result should look like on the bottom of the page Stefan
        referred to. This implies that only 2 centres need be aligned with the
        blocks. Those 2 centers that belong to the 2 faces where the 2 1x2x3

        Hi everybody, Just to clarify this point then, I would like solution to
        the 2 Roux blocks events to end up solving the cube to a state like the
        one shown on this webpage http://www.cubestation.co.uk/rouxblocks.html -
        where the blocks are in the positions they would be if the cube was
        solved completely. I realise that this isn&#x27;t quite how Gilles would
        need to position the blocks in his method, but I think it is more
        aesthetically pleasing to have it this way. Submitting anything else, to
        my mind, is similar to submitting a pseudo 2x2x2 block for the 2x2x2
        event. However, for the events we had last year, I wasn&#x27;t so
        strict. So for one layer it is not necessary to align the centres
        correctly, but only to have one layer solved. And of course for one
        face, the only requirement is that one complete face is solved :) Good
        Luck everybody! Dan :) P.S. I&#x27;ve even had a go this time! So if you
        are thinking that you won&#x27;t submit, at least do it to beat me! ---

        Dan, can we have a vote on this? I think your new definitions are
        counterintuitive and it means I&#x27;ve wasted time for something
        that&#x27;s not good and I could imagine I&#x27;m not the only one. If
        you call it &quot;Roux&quot; blocks, then it should be like the Roux
        method. Aligning the M-slice centers that early is *not* part of the
        Roux method. I also don&#x27;t find it more aestetical. To the contrary,
        the true two Roux blocks are two nice blocks. What you suggest is
        something with ugly holes (at DF and DB). On the other hand, at least
        most methods that start by solving one layer will align the layer with
        the four centers touching that layer. Usually they start by first
        solving the edges relative to each other, then adjusting with four
        centers around, then solve the corners. Or vice versa with corners
        first. Cheers! Stefan --- In fewestmoveschallenge@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi again, as you have probably seen, I started two *survey* polls.
        I&#x27;d like to emphasize that this is intended to be a survey only,
        trying to find out how people initially understood the tasks. It is
        *not* a vote for what you want the tasks to be. Dan, if you&#x27;d
        rather not have these surveys, let me know and I&#x27;ll stop them (or
        maybe you&#x27;re able to do it yourself, don&#x27;t know). I just went
        ahead starting them cause we have limited time so I&#x27;d like to get
        this cleared as soon as possible. Cheers! Stefan

        In my opinion Centers being matched up should not be a factor. I use
        this system exclusively, and I don&#x27;t think that centers need to be
        in place. When finishing B2, you can make an R and r or vice versa to
        put Red/Orange on top. As long as REd or Orange is on top, you can
        recognize Edge Orientation quickly and easlily. There is no reason in
        the world to align centers after B1. Bottom Line; Step 4 fixes last 6
        edges and Centers. You will mess up the centers *Guaranteed* during
        execution of step 4. IT&#x27;s all M and U moves! So to Iterate, In my
        opinion, centers defenitely dont need to be aligned for either B1 or B2.
        Its one of the great advantages of the ROUX method to have the M slice
        Free. Happy CUbing JASON Kovacic c_w_tsai &lt;c_w_tsai@...> wrote: > I
