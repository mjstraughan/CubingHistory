          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I had a brief look at google docs. I was not too impressed withe the 
userfriendliness. I still did not find out how to make a named 
folder or start sharing. Oh well, im sure it does work somehow :-P

Lars, if you need it ... my google (gmail) account = 
per.kristen.fredlund

I agree with doing only the 10 mins format for now. I could probably 
do 1 hr every week, but 10 mins only is more safe ;-) I can do 1 
insertion within 5 minutes most of the time :D

Hi,

10 minutes, or 5 minutes without writing down the solution, is a nice
format.
That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been doing for years. Averages of 12-2 or 7-2.
But I like to do them all in a row.
A good result for me would be 42 HTM or 36 STM. I even did a series of
100 solves (2 days): 37.9 STM.
Who would be patient enough to wait for 12 weeks for such a stat?

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I used to achieve avgs of 41/52 for normal solving and supersolving 
about 20 years ago. All done semi-linearly. Only simple undoing 
moves. Never restart. I propose this semi-linear format and 10 mins 
INCLUDING writing it down and verifying it. I also recommend the fmc 
companion to save time ;-) If anyone wants to ban it i&#x27;m still game, 
but excessive time is spent non-productively :D

My 20 cents!!

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

FMC companion can help you to verify your solution later and count
moves. Is that what you mean, Per? Of course, why not. If you mean we
can record our solution by typing it in FMC companion and still have
10 minutes I am not against it. Although you will have time for an
insertion of a 3-cycle or so, you cannot do it since this short time
format does not allow taking moves back. You are suggesting to allow
counting F F2 as F&#x27;(1 move), R R as R2 (1 move), B B&#x27; (0 moves). I am
not sure about this. Let&#x27;s see what others thing, I am for either
(forbid or allow). 10 weeks is a long time, so I understand Gilles
that he likes to do 10 attempts in a row. So far, we agreed on using
FMC #182 - #191 scrambles. Gilles, I can do 10 times 10-minutes in a
row if we throw in 10 random scrambles here, too. Then, anybody can
solve them and comment his/her results. We don&#x27;t need a deadline for
such a free unofficial contest. I would not expect anybody of us doing
it often. I know, some of us are pretty busy, me included; Lars are
you with us? Both, the 10-week and 10 in a row (once the scrambles are
posted) can go in parallel. We&#x27;ll see what interesting will come out
of this. And yeah, lets do 1-hour solutions each week. If somebody
wants to join but has to skip a week, do it later next week and just
catch up.
Any more suggestions? We&#x27;re pretty much set.
So lube your cubes!
  Mirek

I had such a competition running once (fewestmoves5), but it is shut<br>

solutions. I know it is more work, but it is interesting to see other<br>
people&#x27;s strategies for linear solving.<br>
<br>
But it isn&#x27;t necessarily me that has to host it if you want to use my<br>

P.S. A number of people noticed that the &quot;forgot password&quot; feature<br>

and have authentication by email which I think is much nicer.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ah, i had forgotten the not taking back moves restriction. Actually 
i&#x27;m AGAINST that restriction for the 10 minutes format. It does allow 
for a few possible starts. If we really stick to linear solutions 
then most of the usefulness of the companion is lost anyway. I will 
only use it for verification and counting :D

I don&#x27;t think the best lubed cube will win it :-P

get away with passwords how?? Everytime you submit you just give your 
email address, then get a reply you have to reply to?? I have 
designed online systems that require email confirmation. I can 
honestly say it has been a pain. So mny users have email with very 
tough restrictions. The emails sent out are never received... 
Personally i&#x27;m starting to be in favor of not relying on email 
sending from server. Oh well, that&#x27;s another discussion ;-)

<br>
Not quite, the scheme I have in mind is a bit more subtle than that.<br>
To login (or in words that are perhaps more enlightening, to<br>
&quot;authenticate&quot; yourself) you just type in your email address (no<br>
password). You will then be sent an email containing a secret URL.<br>
Click on it, and you&#x27;re logged in. The next, and most essential part<br>
of the recipe is that a persistent cookie is then set which allows you<br>
to remain logged in for months on end without having to<br>
re-authenticate, much in the same way that you may remain logged into<br>
youtube.com without having to re-authenticate. This makes the actual<br>
authentication step a negligible since it only happens once, ever<br>
(practically), but the advantage is that if you ever do logout, then<br>
you don&#x27;t need to remember that pesky password to log in again.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

My wording was a bit unclear. One does not really reply to the 
automatic email being sent, one responds to a link sent. Still there 
may be problems with the user not getting the email. I know this from 
bitter experience :-( Also, is there not a security concern that such 
a cookie is set without the users consent? I suggest making it 
voluntary to set such a cookie. Getting away with passwords is s good 
thing, it&#x27;s only a matter of how to best do it ;-)

Have fun!!

Not joking really: why not, when having official FMC competitons <br>

best QTM wins QTM, the best STM wins STM and so on. That must be one <br>
of the easiest things to implement.<br>

As it is today, methods like Roux are unfavored, the strictly HTM <br>
used forces competitors to use certian methods.<br>
<br>
I propose the use of QTM, HTM, STM and ATM (axis turn metric) as the <br>
ones we should use in competiton, that way any method can find it&#x27;s <br>
favorite metric (how about that? for competitons in one =)<br>

What does the rest of the FMC group think about this?<br>

  Dan did exactly that for us long time ago. On the result link from
http://www.cubestation.co.uk/ we can choose to see winner in either of
4 metrics, HTM, STM, QTM, and SQTM. There is no ATM so far, however,
once Dan becomes rich he may provide some on-line cash for e-money at
his virtual ATM :-).

          <div class="email-content">Nice, Per,
I have practiced for some time only to see that I often end up with
above 40 moves in my sequential solving. Worried that I may not get
lucky again, I did my #182 today. Well, the first moves turned up to
be great and I finished in 31 moves (about 10 moves better than my
average). They were so good that I used them to get my final under 30
solution. It was unfortunately after 1-hour limit was over. I&#x27;ll show
details after #182 is closed this Sunday. 
Who will keep track of the results of our 10-week 10-minute sequential
FMC? Maybe Lars? Or Guus? Or me?
#182 is the first as I see from my post on Jan 4.

I know Dans competiton is in that form but I was thinking of the 
official WCA competitons, I would like to have it there too.

  anybody did 10-min sequential solving? My lucky solution is the <br>
following.<br>
10-min:<br>
D B&#x27; D F L2 B&#x27; D B&#x27; R&#x27; B2 R2 B D2 here I spent most time checking an <br>
option of fixing corner pieces first because several LL algorithms <br>
handle this case. But than I saw that after fixing edges I will end <br>
up with corner 5-cycle which is better.  B L B2 here it takes a <br>

L D&#x27; U&#x27; (31 moves, 8:32 min). <br>
1-hour:<br>

B2 D&#x27; B&#x27; D B&#x27; (30) Only soon later I found how to finish the same <br>
beginning in 26 moves.<br>
About 1 hour, 30 min:<br>
D B&#x27; D F L2 B&#x27; D B&#x27; R&#x27; B2 R2 B D2 B&#x27; notice that 3 corners need to <br>
be twisted and 3 edges moved. This can be often solved by well <br>
remembered &quot;sune&quot; 8-mover. Do  L&#x27; B2 (the two moves prepare for the <br>
8-move sune) D&#x27; L&#x27; D L&#x27; D&#x27; L2 D L2 ,return the two moves B2 L and <br>
that&#x27;s it. The two preparing moves can also be done differently so <br>
that the whole solution becomes D B&#x27; D F L2 B&#x27; D B&#x27; R&#x27; B2 R2 B D2 B&#x27; <br>

Hello Mirek,<br>
<br>
Well done, 31 for 10min is very good! <br>
For FMC182 my 10min solve was 34 moves: D&#x27; F B&#x27; L2 D L2 R D2 R&#x27; B2 R B
D&#x27; B D B&#x27; D2 B D2 R F&#x27; R&#x27; F B2 R2 B D&#x27; L&#x27; D L B&#x27; R2 B2 D <br>
cross + pair: D&#x27; F B&#x27; L2 D L2 R (7)<br>
other 3 pairs: D2 R&#x27; B2 R B D&#x27; B D B&#x27; D2 B D2 R F&#x27; R&#x27; F (23)<br>
LL : B2 R2 B D&#x27; L&#x27; D L B&#x27; R2 B2 D (34)<br>
<br>
I had no time this week to complete a 1 hour solve.<br>
I&#x27;ll keep track of the results. For now I have:<br>
<br>
&lt;b>Per:&lt;/b><br>
FMC179 5min: 40 moves<br>
FMC179 1h:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 31 moves<br>

<br>
No solutions so far from Ryan, Lars and GillesR <br>
<br>
My conclusions so far: 28-move world record is hard to beat!<br>
10min solves results vary too much to take conclusions yet.<br>
<br>
When a shared google-spreadsheet will come available (Lars?) I&#x27;ll put
the results there and meanwhile I&#x27;ll think about a ranking system.<br>
But my preferred system would someting like: count a &quot;no posted
solution&quot; as &quot;bad solution&quot; which means: whatever solution you post, it
is even better than posting no solution! And if you post a 10min solve
and no 1hour solve, moves for 10min are also counted for 1hour solve.<br>
Does anyone disagree?<br>

Yes, I can understand that but my main reason was that you do not use 
a slice turn approach for FMC because every turn you do counts as 
two. So you are more or less forced to use a face turn approach, even 
if you can do better using a slice approach.

I always try and keep my FMC at an hour, that way
someday when I enter a competition I will be used to
it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)<br>
<br>
I am slowly catching up on the backlog of fmc solves in the 10/60 min <br>
categories. Here is my contribution for 10-min #184<br>
<br>
U D&#x27; B L D&#x27; F R2 F&#x27; D F&#x27; D F D F&#x27; R D&#x27; R&#x27; F L&#x27; B2 L F&#x27; L&#x27; B2 L F2 U&#x27; <br>
R2 F D F&#x27; B R&#x27; B&#x27; R2 U F2 <br>
<br>
Breakdown:<br>
<br>
U D&#x27; B L (2x2x2)<br>
D&#x27; F R2 F&#x27; D F&#x27; D F D F&#x27; (edges)<br>
R D&#x27; R&#x27; (insert corner)<br>
F L&#x27; B2 L F&#x27; L&#x27; B2 L (finish corners)<br>
F2 U&#x27; R2 F D F&#x27; B R&#x27; B&#x27; R2 U F2 (solve edges)<br>
<br>
Easy start. 5 unsolved edges after approx 5 minutes. Last 5 mins <br>
spent on setup-moves for easy 5-cycle **phew**. Completed in last <br>
minute!<br>
<br>
Not sure if i will pursue the 4-move 2x2x2 for 1 hr solution. Not <br>
really a good start ...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I suggest counting turns the way it was done for 1 hr linear aolving 
hosted with ryan heise. Every face turned counts as 1 turn. So F F2 
counts as one, same with F F&#x27; ... etc ... This makes sense to me. F 
F&#x27; is a &quot;mistake&quot; to be punished.

Some great solves there, would be nice to see the actual solutions

Why have a complicated rating scheme. Just assign scores by position 
in every round.

Like 10-9-8-7 ... or 100-80-60 or similar. We are very few 
participants so nothing complicated is needed :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)<br>
<br>
I had a go at scramble #180 (the one that seemed to have the &quot;worst&quot; <br>
solutions so far.<br>
R&#x27; U&#x27; B L&#x27; F&#x27; D U2 F U F&#x27; U D2 R U R&#x27; D2 U R&#x27; U2 R2 B U B&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; R2 <br>
B&#x27; U&#x27; R F&#x27; B U&#x27; F B&#x27; U B R2 (37/36)<br>
<br>
I didnt see how to make a block start so i chose to follow a cross <br>
first approach<br>
<br>
R&#x27; U&#x27; B L&#x27; F&#x27; D (cross)<br>
U2 F U F&#x27; U D2 R U R&#x27; (insert &quot;pairs&quot;)<br>
D2 U R&#x27; U2 (last 1L corner)<br>
R2 B U B&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; (last corners and an edge)<br>
R2 B&#x27; U&#x27;.R F&#x27; B U&#x27; F B&#x27;.U B R2  (conjugate base 5e-cycle)<br>
<br>
Yay! Yet another 5e finish. Is this my new approach ? :-P <br>
Coincidence only :-)<br>

Just realised this should have been a 5-min solve - not 10 min. 
Anyway it&#x27;s not part of the unofficial competition :D

Hi Guys,<br>
<br>
I just opened a shared google spreadsheet to share FMC solutions,
results &amp;amp; rankings for &quot;10min linear&quot; and &quot;1 hour&quot; FMC 2008 <br>
I already gave Per &lt;span class=&quot;&quot;>collaborators&lt;/span>&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;>&lt;/span>
rights, he&#x27;s got a google account already.<br>
If everyone who wants to join provide us his/her google account, I (or
Per) could &lt;span class=&quot;&quot;>add you as collaborators&lt;/span>&lt;span class=&quot;&quot;>&lt;/span>
as well.<br>
Format and layout are provisional. Feel free to improve<br>
<br>
I propose the following scores/totals (not yet implemented):<br>
- score is the number of HTM moves above the optimal solution<br>
- Best solution and worst 5 solutions&amp;nbsp; are skipped,&amp;nbsp; Average of other 4
is your score<br>
- So you must at least participate in 50% of all 10min and/or 1 hour
competitions<br>
- Rankings from 10min and 1 hour competitions are seperated.<br>
- ranking recalculated&amp;nbsp; each week<br>
- equal scores means we compare 6th result of past 10 weeks<br>
- competition starts from FMC 181<br>
- If&amp;nbsp; Dan&#x27;s site&amp;nbsp; does not provide a scramble We generate a scramble
from cube explroer.com and copy it to the scambles sheet<br>
<br>
I also propose:<br>
- Every competitor adds his/her own results, scores, totals, solutions
to the spreadsheet<br>
- Every competitor has his/her own sheet for solutions in the
spreadsheet<br>
<br>
Any suggestions?<br>
<br>
Most important: Have fun, be inspired and learn from each other!<br>

<br>
I did post an FMC186 scramble-stub in the shared spreadsheet (sheet: <br>
&quot;scrambles&quot;):<br>
U2 B&#x27; U2 D&#x27; R2 B U&#x27; B L2 F L R&#x27; D B&#x27; F2 D R&#x27; F D&#x27; L U2 R2 U&#x27; R2 F&#x27;<br>
Let&#x27;s play with this one!<br>
NB did you notice on Dan&#x27;s site the FMC-186 scramble is hidden? Just try <br>
to submit a solution: in the submit form the scramble shown, which is <br>
the scramle above!<br>
<br>
Happy cubing!<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I was working on FMC #185 while travelling in an airplane <br>
&gt;&gt; this &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thursday. I had not very good attempt at 10-min - 41 <br>
&gt;&gt; moves, &gt;&gt; skipped &gt; &gt;&gt; the 1-hour because not finishing in the time <br>
&gt;&gt; frame :-(. &gt;&gt; At least, I &gt; &gt;&gt; found a nice 24 moves within few hours <br>
&gt;&gt; (submitted &gt;&gt; next day).<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Started with probably the shortest (5 moves) 2x2x2 block <br>
&gt;&gt; filled &gt;&gt; in &gt;&gt; &gt; with one move to prepare another c-e pair: D&#x27; B R2 <br>
&gt;&gt; (L2) U&#x27; B, &gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt; rest &gt; is easy, B&#x27; D2 B D&#x27; R&#x27; (2X2X3) F&#x27; L D L2 <br>
&gt;&gt; F L (2 layers) &gt;&gt; L&#x27; D&#x27; &gt;&gt; F&#x27; D2 F &gt; L D B D2 B&#x27; D2 (4 edges at the <br>

Hi FMC guys,<br>
<br>
In the shared google document fewestmovechallenge2008.doc I started a
new challenge 189 for the next comming week.<br>
The scramble is: F2 U&#x27; D2 F2 D L2 B&#x27; L&#x27; B2 R B2 L2 F2 L&#x27; F D&#x27; F
(optimized from 50 a moves scramble)<br>
The competitions are 10 minutes linear solve (no moves take back) and
an 1 hour challenge.<br>
Oher regulations are in the document.<br>
<br>
If Dan&#x27;s/Per&#x27;s FMC site is comming up we try to synchronize the
competitions &amp;amp; scrambles<br>
<br>
For FMC 188 Mirek Goljan was the winner with 38 moves for linear solve
and 28 moves for 1 hour.<br>
<br>
You can add results &amp;amp; remarks yourself to the document. If you want
to &lt;span style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; class=&quot;&quot;>collaborate&amp;nbsp; the document,
to add &amp;amp; view results, you&amp;nbsp; can send your email&amp;nbsp; to me
(<a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-abbreviated&quot; href=&quot;mailto:guusrs@...&quot;>guusrs@...</a>) and I will share the document with you<br>

<br>
As some of you may have seen, Dan Harris is no more running his FMC <br>
Challenge. He asked for volunteers to bring it further into the future.<br>
<br>
So I am designing a new version of FMC right now. There is not much <br>
there yet - but i have released a scramble nonetheless. Proper <br>
registration/submission and results will be developed during this <br>
week. The system will be fully automated and run without any <br>
administration. No need to feed it with manual scrambles. For the time <br>
being im using the official WCA scrambler and a length of 25 turns <br>
(htm). I may change this to use my own PHP scrambler and length 30 at <br>
a later stage <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,
   thanks for taking over this FMC contest. Bringing the 1-hour limit
will make it more accessible to anybody who could not afford spending
4 hours or more as we sometimes used. 
Question regarding the rules. Since you allow any number of cubes to
work with, scrambling them should not be allowed before the time
starts. I suggest that only one cube can be scrambled and double
checked and the 1-hour limit starts right after that.
Can you post the submition deadline and the way how to submit our
solutions on http://fmc.mustcube.net? 
BTW, why not to include 10-min sequential contest on the same
scrambles? This may attract new people, too.

Happy cubing!
Mirek

Hi Per &amp;amp; Mirek,<br>
<br>
1 hour and 10 min (linear) would be a good thing to do. You think this
is possible Per?<br>
<br>
Btw this weekend the google-fewestmoveschallenge openen for scramble
#190:<br>
<br>
U F&#x27; U B L&#x27; U2 L2 U&#x27; B&#x27; R2 U&#x27; B2 U&#x27; B D L&#x27; F (17 moves, optimized from
50 moves scramble)<br>
<br>
Good luck all of you, especially Per,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I am actually considering doing 3 different formats (with the same 
scramble). 10 min linear, 1 hr and no time limit (like before). This 
will require some kind of honesty from the competitor. It does not 
make sense to first do the timeless one, and then the 2 others with 
same solution. I will think about how to deal with this. Is it better 
with 3 separate scrambles after all ??

You can initialise with two scrambles if you need your &#x27;fix&#x27; ;p

          <div class="email-content">You can work on last week scramble as long as you want. But you 
cannot expect your solution being counted after all others&#x27; 
solutions were already posted. I doubt that everybody wants to wait 
one more week to see how others were doing. 
Keep it simple!
BTW, what&#x27;s the deadline for the first #180 scramble?

Hi <br>
Well done Charles, 26 is very good. A corner 5-cycle within the hour
insertion is really expert.<br>
I tried the scramble myself but this time I couldn&#x27;t find better than
34 moves.<br>
I found very interesting starts but needed more time to go sub 30;)<br>

  it is straightforward with a rocket fast start! Nice!

  did you see my cute under-2-hour solution for #190? I included it in
the google spreadsheet.
Just to remind, the scramble was U F&#x27; U B L&#x27; U2 L2 U&#x27; B&#x27; R2 U&#x27; B2 U&#x27; B
D L&#x27; F.

This might be a linear solve if it didn&#x27;t take me too long to modify
my 8-move 2x2x3 part! 
B U2 R F U R2 F D F R2_ F R&#x27; D + 4-cycle of ce-pairs. Move the 4 pairs
in the front layer and cycle them by single move: L&#x27; U&#x27; D&#x27; R D (F&#x27;)
and return the five preparing moves D&#x27; R&#x27; D U L  (24).

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gu(u)s &amp; guys :D

The new FMC challenge at fmc.mustcube.net will be fully open from this 
coming sunday. Hence i would like to propose that the google challenge 
change name to something else. I will in respect to the challenges 
posted at google so far renumber the challenges at the new site, 
starting off with round 192.

I have decided to go for 2 wekly scrambles. One for speed and one for 
both 1 hr and unlimited time. The 1 hr challenge should be done BEFORE 
unlimited time challenge. I will post detailed rules and guidelines for 
participating.

I hope to get hold of the old results from Dan&#x27;s site quite shortly - 
when me and Dan decide how to do it practically. Including the google 
rounds also would be possible - if so desired.

I have been too busy to participate in challenges lately. Great 
solutions (congrats!!) by Mirek and Charles :D

Best wishes,

Per

Hi Per, do you have plans for running Linear FMC?<br>
<br>
I think it would be very convenient to run all of the competitions at<br>
the same place. I would have suggested *my* competitions server but I<br>
was too late for that ;-)<br>
<br>
If you build one from scratch, I estimate it will take a week to get<br>
it off the ground, and then several weeks after that to add all of the<br>
 missing things and fix all of the problems.<br>
<br>
By the way, congratulations to the participants of the last round of<br>
Linear FMC. The final rankings after this round are at:<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan / All !!

yes i will be running linear solving also, i didnt know you had yet 
another round going actually. The linear solving will be a speed 
challenge (10 mins). Most of my time so far has been to code 
javascript to automatically check if a solution solves a scramble. 
This is now done. I need another day to get the full submission 
routine up and running. I used ideas from super-supercubing to track 
pieces and rotations during turning layers of the cube. And i have 
used script from the fmc companion to calculate metrics 
automatically. Also new challenges are added automatically when a 
round is expired. There will be 2 scrambles each week. One for speed, 
and one for classic (unlimited time) and 1 hr solving. Results will 
also be automatically compiled (with very short solutions needing my 
approval!) My site will support all major browsers (IE/FF
(Mozilla)/Opera/Safari). My biggest obstacle was the lack of some 
array methods in Internet Explorer. I will renumber the rounds at my 
new site, since im already a bit delayed.

After it is all up and runnimg smoothly i will finally have time 
to &quot;FMC&quot; again :D

Best wishes,

Per

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan :-)

Don&#x27;t throw it away :-) Your linear challenge is different. The one 
on the new site will be 10 minutes speed linear. Different from your 
1 hr linear. And besides the new FMC site will support all major 
browsers, IE included. I do not see this as bad thing - even it&#x27;s not 
standards compliant. Which browser fully is anyway?? As i know it all 
major browsers fail the Acid3 test, with exception of non-public (as 
of yet) versions. I target a wide audience, not solely standards. I 
know how p***** o** some will be if it does not support IE - sadly 
still the most widely used browsers amongst common users.

I didn&#x27;t know that your system supports automatic correctness / all 
metric checking. All this functionality is not (directly) exposed to 
the users.

I am developing the new FMC site as much for myself as for the fewest 
moves community. It is a great learning experience for me. My work 
related projects are mostly routine work - nothing much to learn 
(technically).

Keep well !!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan !!

How about the following deal:

I run 1 hr and classic (&quot;no limit&quot;) on the new fmc site and i let go 
of the speed linear. Now that my site is 99% complete i don&#x27;t want to 
let go of it. So then it&#x27;s up to you and Guus how you will do about 
the (speed)linear fewest moves. I am opening the new site because Dan 
wanted a successor. I was the only one offering to do it. And even if 
there should be duplicate same format competition i do not see a big 
problem. There are many sites running weekly speedsolving 
competitions. It does not mean that all but one should close down ;-) 
With all the work i have put into the new site i cannot just let it 
not go public. So the consolation is that i let go of the speed 
competition. I can link for that to your site/system. I guess you 
wont be running it at all times - but so be it :-)

Best regards,

Per

Maybe I was being too subtle? So I&#x27;ll have another go:<br>
<br>
My preference is for all FMC competitions to be hosted at the same<br>
place under the same umbrella. There are a number of advantages to this:<br>
<br>
1. Some of the different disciplines of FMC can be combined using the<br>
same scramble, such as making the first 10 minutes linear and the<br>
remaining 50 minutes non-linear with the same scramble.<br>
<br>
2. All rankings can be in one place for easy comparison and better<br>
possibilities for statistics.<br>
<br>
3. Competitors do not need to visit several websites and remember<br>
several different passwords for what are all tightly related competitions.<br>
<br>
Just because I am disappointed that you did not consider my earlier<br>
efforts and my objective to automate FMC the first time, does not mean<br>
that I still want to host Linear FMC on my own system at any cost.<br>
<br>
I would much prefer it if *either* you *or* I ran all of these<br>
FM-related competitions in one place. Given the way things have turned<br>
out and your strong conviction to achieve what I tried to achieve,<br>
from scratch, I will stand aside.<br>
<br>
I hereby willingly grant you permission to host my competition on your<br>
own site, and I will spend my time helping in some other way(*).<br>
<br>
(*) Fewest Moves Simulator?? :-) One plus: You can attempt to get a<br>
highscore in your own time rather than having to compete every week.<br>

&gt; I think that there *is* a difference between the fm competitions that<br>
&gt; you run and the ones that that Per/Dan runs/ran. Yours is a tournament<br>
&gt; 12week format where the other is a single week event. This, I think,<br>
&gt; is enough of a difference to justify keeping both. Not the same<br>
&gt; competition just on duplicate websites<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t the 12 week format is an important factor. It was only<br>
experimental after all and I was intending to change that (we can&#x27;t<br>
expect people to be present for all 12 weeks).<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sure that Per could add a &quot;12-week champion&quot; database view over<br>
the top of an ordinary week-by-week challenge.<br>

The site is very close to going live now. When it&#x27;s time i will 
announce it in all the approprite fora and all &quot;work in progress&quot; 
images will be gone from the site.

Making such an automated site (that runs by itself) was far more work 
than expected - as expected :-P

Opening in April never meant April 1st - who would believe that 
anyway ;-)

<br>
Apologies for all the useless spam flooding into this group. I do <br>
check and delete spam regularly (many times pr week). As i do not have <br>
full access to this group i am not sure how to go about with this <br>
problem. To have all messages pending is an option, but i cannot set <br>
it up with only moderator rights. And besides, this might create more <br>
harm than it would do good. We all want this to be a lively and active <br>
group, right ? :D<br>
<br>
With the rather low activity maybe it&#x27;s not a big problem for many <br>
people after all ??? On the other hand, getting rid of spam might be a <br>
catalyst for boosting the number of useful posts :-)<br>

Scramble: U&#x27; R2 B R B&#x27; U&#x27; L2 F&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; D2 L2 U2 D&#x27; L D2 U&#x27; L2 R2 D U&#x27; L F U R&#x27; B R&#x27; F&#x27; U2 L2<br>
<br>
Solution: (31f)<br>
2x2x2: U&#x27; D&#x27; B2<br>
2X2X3: R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 R&#x27; U2 F2<br>
Add 2x2x1: U&#x27; R F&#x27; U F<br>
Pair up UFL+UF, URF+UR: R F R2 F&#x27; R2 F R2 F&#x27;<br>
Form pseudo-tripod: U&#x27; R&#x27; U R&#x27;<br>
Finish: F R&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27;<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

If you have read my previous post (spamalot) you already know i have 
very limited powers. All i can do is to delete already posted 
messages. I guess we can can just hope that dan would pass on higher 
responsibilities to someone else (i will gladly do it).

I&#x27;m happy to see that the new fmc site is going well - fully 
automated. I will soon add more features. For the time being my free 
moments are very limited. As a minimum i will have applets up for all 
solutions byt the end of the week - more changes/additions are lined 
up for later :-)

Best regards,

-Per

          <div class="email-content">Hmmm ... on your first submit you already broke the rules for fmc ;-)

Not to worry - it is indeed a very informal competition. However, 
spending 60 minutes and competing with guys spending at most 10 
minutes seems a bit unfair.

The FMC is all about having fun in coming up with short solutions. 
Thanks for participating. The site is still under slow development - 
due to lack of time. At least it works with no intervention on my 
behalf.

I am planning (a) major new feature(s) quite soon, but it will take 
some time to implement it (the checking bit).

The one who guesses what it is will receive a private confirmation 
message - no prize is given :D

If there are any other inputs/comments it is highly appreciated.

          <div class="email-content">But I didn&#x27;t submit my &quot;improper&quot; solution to the contest site. I 
have submitted a number of &quot;legal&quot; solutions to the contest site 
already.

I posted my solution here instead of the contest site precisely 
because it wasn&#x27;t done in accordance with the rules. I also waited 
until after the contest ended (for that week) before posting it here.

I just thought people might be interested in seeing my relatively 
short solution, even though it wasn&#x27;t a valid speed-style solve. It 
was 23 moves shorter than the only solution that was submitted for 
that scramble, although one would expect proper &quot;speed&quot; solutions to 
be longer, of course.

By the way, I got first place for &quot;classic format&quot; in 3 out 4 
metrics! OK, I think the contest will get more competitive once it is 
announced that it is officially working and the &quot;still some 
outstanding issues&quot; message is removed, etc.

Comments on the contest site:

I see solutions now contain applets similar to the old site. Nice!

I think it would be nice to see the scramble sequence on the results 
page.

The displayed results don&#x27;t indicate the week/format they are for. 
Since changing the selected item in the dropdown selection controls 
doesn&#x27;t immediately update the display, those controls don&#x27;t 
necessarily indicate what&#x27;s being displayed at the moment.

While the GUI of the results page doesn&#x27;t allow you to select the 
current week (contest in progress), it is still possible to view the 
results already submitted for the current week. I think you should 
prevent access to the current week&#x27;s results.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Yes i hadnt double check if your solution posted here was submitted 
at the site. My apologies.

The possibility to bypass the gui and list the current running week 
is a mistake from my side. On the other hand this is 
obvious &quot;hacking&quot; from users - but i will (try to) fix it anyway, it 
shouldn&#x27;t be like that ;-)

I will fix this issue and then post &quot;all clear&quot; messages in the 
appropriate fora :-)

All the best,

Per

          <div class="email-content">I noticed that the FMC 194 official/classic scramble had a 6q orient 
all sequence. It doesn&#x27;t appear to me any submitted solutions were 
based on orienting first, though. Except ZZ&#x27;s solution also oriented 
the edges in the first 3 moves.

Scramble: B&#x27; L&#x27; U2 B R D&#x27; R2 U&#x27; D&#x27; B F&#x27; R&#x27; D2 L2 F D2 B2 D&#x27; U&#x27; F U2 D&#x27; 
L2 U D2 R&#x27; B&#x27; F R&#x27; F&#x27;

U&#x27; R F&#x27; orients edges in the &lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2> edge orientation scheme.

Then L D&#x27; L&#x27; orients corners in the &lt;U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2> corner 
orientation scheme.

  I have been off for some time, but I plan to join you guys at <br>
http://fmc.mustcube.net/<br>
Bruce, your find about fast orientation was really interesting. <br>
I tried #197 but I was disapointed for not being able to get under <br>
30 moves. Although, I discovered a very short 2x2x3 start (pseudo): <br>
with pre-move B&#x27; which is the move you do before scrambling and the <br>
same move you will have to append to your solution, do D R U2 B&#x27; D <br>
R&#x27;. So, you have 2x2x3 in 6+1 moves. You can also insert arbitrary <br>
move with L before DR&#x27; just to have more to explore. <br>
Then I continued with F L2 U L&#x27; F&#x27; D2 F U&#x27; L F&#x27; L D&#x27; L&#x27; D L&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; <br>
for which there is no good insertion of 3-corner cycle  or <br>
F L F2 D2 F D&#x27; L2 D2 L2 D&#x27; F L&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; L B L&#x27;_ L B L&#x27; F&#x27; L B&#x27; L&#x27; F <br>
(31)<br>
Another: [pre-move B&#x27;] D R U2 B&#x27; L&#x27; D R&#x27;  D F&#x27; B D B&#x27; F L2 F L&#x27; <br>
(insert L D L&#x27; U&#x27; L D&#x27; L&#x27; U) F&#x27; D2 L&#x27; D L D L&#x27; (30)<br>
For those, who are not familiar with pre-moves, do first 6 moves <br>
after normal scrambling and compare to (on another cobe) what you <br>
get after applying the same 6 moves when scrambling (B&#x27; + Scramble) .<br>

I noticed there were 8 (unique) solutions submitted for <br>
official/classic, and no two of them started out the same way, not even <br>

compensating for cube rotations):<br>

Congratulations with your incredible 26-move solve for Per&#x27;s classic <br>
challenge<br>
(guys, check: <br>
http://fmc.mustcube.net/results.php?round=201&amp;format=official&amp;metric=htm).<br>
7 moves cancel for an 10 move edge-3cycle insertions is amazing!<br>
<br>
When I tried to post my not-so-bad-31-move-solve the site was down for a <br>
while so I couldn&#x27;t post.<br>
This scramble made me crazy because I found very short F2L (13moves) or <br>
pseudo F2L but no good continuations.<br>
<br>
See ya@202<br>

Happy cubing<br>

          <div class="email-content">I also was not able to submit my solutions. I had a 46-move &quot;official 
format&quot; solution, and came up with the following 38-move solution 
under the classic format.

F2 U R&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F D F&#x27; U F&#x27; B D F&#x27; R B U L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 R B U2 R2 B&#x27;

2x2x2: F2 U R&#x27; . D B F2 D F&#x27; R
2x2x3: B U L2
Add 2x2x1 while preserving a CE pair: L U R&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 R B U2 B&#x27; ..
Remaining edges: L U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 B&#x27; U&#x27; B
Remaining corners:
Insert at &quot;.&quot;: F&#x27; U&#x27; F D F&#x27; U F D&#x27;
Insert at &quot;..&quot;: B R2 B&#x27; L2 B R2 B&#x27; L2

I note that Mirek&#x27;s solution was submitted under &quot;official format.&quot; 
My congratulations, too.

I might also note that there&#x27;s been a number of times when the 
best &quot;official format&quot; entry is better than any of the &quot;classic 
format&quot; solutions, but the person didn&#x27;t also submit it under 
classic. It might make sense to have &quot;official format&quot; entries 
automatically become &quot;classic format&quot; entries as well, if the same 
person hasn&#x27;t submitted a &quot;classic format&quot; entry by the time the 
round expires.

Mirek,<br>
<br>
For FMC 201 classic I found the following excellent start:<br>
Turn pre-scramble moves B D, (then scramble,) then start solving with
D&#x27; L2 B R&#x27; D2 U&#x27; B2 U&#x27; L&#x27; B U&#x27; (11) which solves F2L minus a pair &lt;b>and&lt;/b>
a 2x2x1 block in the last layer. When I continued these 11 moves I
ended up with 20 moves, leaving 4 nasty corners.<br>
<br>
How would you finish this, or modify the first 11 moves? <br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

Hi Mirek,<br>
<br>
I got it! 23 moves!<br>
<br>
***** SPOILER *****<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I transformed my starting moves a little bit by changing the
pre-scramble-moves to U&#x27; L2 B D and then solve with D&#x27; L2 B R&#x27; D2 U&#x27; B2
(7) (F2L minus 2 moves)<br>
Then finish with&amp;nbsp; R L&#x27; B R&#x27; B&#x27; R B R&#x27; B&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; (12) (a nice double
commutator in the middle)<br>
This give us a full solution: D&#x27; L2 B R&#x27; D2 U&#x27; B2 + R L&#x27; B R&#x27; B&#x27; R B R&#x27;
B&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27;&amp;nbsp; + U&#x27; L2 B D (23)<br>
Took me one hour extra after the classic competition hour<br>
<br>
pfffff.;)<br>

Hi Mirek,<br>
<br>
Clever but very complex insertion. Nevertheless, 29 moves will be very
good for a competition.<br>
<br>
I tried FMC 203, yes I was surprised! <br>
I think everyone should give this scramble (D U&#x27; F2 U&#x27; R&#x27; F R2 B D&#x27; B R
F B&#x27; U R&#x27; D2 L&#x27; R2 F2 B&#x27; U&#x27; B D B2 F2 U L F U&#x27; B2) a try<br>

Hi Mirek,<br>
<br>
Indeed, that was an amazing scramble with an amazing result<br>
It took me about 20 minutes to find this 19-move solution. You took 16?<br>
I expected others to find this 19-move solution, but in the results
&amp;amp; on the speedsolving forum nobody found it, only you an me.<br>
<br>
Yesterday at the dutch masters I solved the cube in 27 moves and broke
your worldrecord.<br>
So you should join competitions again to get it back.<br>
I&#x27;m sure you will be able to do that.<br>
At Dutch masters the scramble was:<br>
F2 U B2 D2 F2 D&#x27; L2 U B2 L&#x27; U2 B&#x27; D L F2 R2 U B2 D B (20f)<br>
What can you do with it?<br>
<br>
Happy cubing;)<br>

          <div class="email-content">First, my congratulations to Guus for his Fewest Moves Solving world <br>
record (27).<br>
<br>
Also, congratulations to Mirek and Guus on your 19-move solutions to <br>
FMC #203 - only one more move than optimal! Also, Arnaud also had a <br>
very nice &quot;classic&quot; rules solution.<br>
<br>
Optimal solutions for FMC #203 include:<br>
<br>
FTM: U L B&#x27; U F&#x27; R2 U L2 F&#x27; U&#x27; B2 R F2 D F B U&#x27; R&#x27;  (18f*)<br>

<br>
I also noticed someone submitted two &quot;official&quot; solutions. I would have <br>
to assume that both solutions were determined during one 60-minute time <br>
period. Also, it lowers the ranking for eight people.<br>

First of all can I just say &quot;Wow&quot;. Amazing. I don&#x27;t know how you guys 
do it. I&#x27;m advanced, but nowhere in the same league as you guys. This 
is going to be required study on my part. Once again, Mirek and Guus, 
you guys kick ass!

          <div class="email-content">OK, the site no longer has multiple entries by the same person. I 
wonder if the entry that was left in was the first attempt, or if 
it&#x27;s actually a &quot;restart&quot; attempt. I would have guessed the entry by 
that person with the longest solution would have been the one that 
was the first attempt. Personally, I went over the time limit and did 
not submit an entry, and did not do any &quot;restart&quot; attempts.

I apologize in advance for the double post. But I should add I use my 
dark cube for insertions. I have a cube stripped of all colors except 
for the centers for reference. I&#x27;m completely aware that it&#x27;s a purely 
psychological thing on my part. But I swear I find insertions twice as 
fast without all the &quot;confetti&quot; if you will. I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s 
legal, but unless someone tells me otherwise I will continue this :)

David, IMHO, you cannot tell which option will lead to a shorter 
overall solution. As you insert one 8-move sequence, some moves 
cancel or not and the next insertion can fit inside the other. the 
best is to explore all alternatives. You should start with 
insertions where most moves cancel out, this is usually but not 
always the best. If it&#x27;s a tie, try all such.

I think that in competitions you are allowed to use paper, pencil, 
stickers, another regular cube and nothing else. Your dark cube may 
not qualify. Now, the question is, whether you can apply black 
stickers to make a regular cube dark. I would say Why Not?, however, 
you would have to use few minutes out of your 1-hour limit to make 
the dark cube. It may not be worth it.  

Happy cubing!

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
Something went wrong while posting my FMC #206 solution for the 1 hour <br>
format. It didn&#x27;t appear in the list<br>
<br>
Here it is:<br>
<br>
scramble: D&#x27; F2 B&#x27; L R&#x27; U F U&#x27; D2 B R2 L2 D&#x27; B2 F R2 L2 D U2 B2 L2 D R <br>
D2 U L D R2 U&#x27; R&#x27;<br>
my solution: L&#x27; U&#x27; F U F&#x27; L&#x27; F&#x27; L2 F L2 D2 L F&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; R2 D&#x27; L D R2 <br>
D&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U B2 D2 (29)<br>
<br>
explanation:<br>
Not excellent but very funny solution:<br>
I first found D2 . L F&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; D2 U&#x27; L&#x27; U B2 D2 (12) which solves a <br>
lot and leaves 4 edges and 3 corners unsolved.<br>
D2 was an inserted move after I found the other 11 not very promising.<br>
I stickered all 7 unsolved cubies and check if I could bring them to an <br>
LL-position.<br>
Best way to do that was L2 F&#x27; before the 12-move sequence, which brings <br>
all stickered cubies to the left side.<br>
using another cube and simulating these LL-positions I solved the edges <br>
and 1 corner with F L U F U F&#x27; L&#x27; F&#x27; L2 (9)<br>
So I got: L2 F&#x27;.F L U F U F&#x27; L&#x27; F&#x27; L2. F L2 (10) + D2 L F&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; D2: <br>
U&#x27; L&#x27; U B2 D2 (10+12) yielding a corner 3-cycle. At the colon I inserted <br>
D R2 D&#x27; L D R2 D&#x27; L&#x27;. All close to the time 1 hour time limit<br>
funny fact: It could have been a solve for the inverted scramble!<br>
<br>
Per, can you see what went wrong with my solution, on the screen it <br>
looked right!<br>
<br>
happy cubing;)<br>

          <div class="email-content">As I assume David knows, a 5-cycle can be broken down into two 3-
cycles. So let&#x27;s say you put numbered stickers on the 5 pieces that 
you want to cycle so that 1->2->3->4->5->1 (meaning piece #1 needs to 
go where piece #2 is, etc.) or also written (1,2,3,4,5). You can pick 
any of 5 possible cycles as your first cycle: (1,2,3), (2,3,4), 
(3,4,5), (4,5,1), or (5,1,2).

Let&#x27;s say you pick (2,3,4) because there is a nice insertion for that 
with a good number of cancellations. You then will also need to 
either: pick an insertion for (4,5,1) earlier than the (2,3,4) 
insertion point, or pick an insertion for (5,1,2) later than the 
(2,3,4) insertion point. That is, if the earlier insertion is for 
(n,n+1,n+2), the later insertion should be for (n+3,n+4, n). (Of 
course, modulo arithmetic is assumed here so that n+4 would mean n-1 
if the n+4 is literally > 5.)

The above assumes you go through the solve looking for all possible 
insertions without yet actually performing any of the insertions 
found. You can then try to pick a pair of insertions matching the 
above constraints that minimize the number of added moves (taking 
cancellations into account). This assumes the insertion points you 
pick aren&#x27;t too close together that one insertion point gets 
cancelled out by the other. Also, as Mirek pointed out, this will not 
take into consideration the possibility of making an insertion within 
an insertion, so you may not end up with best possible choice. But 
with limited time, you may not have time to explore all possibilities 
anyway. You will have to choose how to proceed based upon what you 
estimate will give you the best chances to find as good as solution 
as possible in the time you have.

            Eric,

Your skeleton really was pretty good. You may look into insertions once 

again, though.

U&#x27; D&#x27; F D&#x27; F&#x27; R... = 2x2x3

D&#x27; L D2 F2 = orient edges

D* F&#x27; D2 F L&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27; L D&#x27; all but 5 corners

And now, 

insert at *: [D&#x27; B D, F&#x27;] 5 moves cancel! = 

U&#x27; D&#x27; F D&#x27; F&#x27; R D&#x27; L D2 F2 B D F&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27; F L&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27; L D&#x27;,

insert one of 4 commutators (additional 2 moves cancel): U&#x27; D&#x27; F D&#x27; F&#x27; 

R D&#x27; L D2 F2 B[B&#x27;, R F R&#x27;] D[D&#x27;, R&#x27; U&#x27; R] F&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27; F L&#x27;[L, U&#x27; R2 U] 

F&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27;[D, B U2 B&#x27;] L D&#x27;

= (for example) U&#x27; D&#x27; F D&#x27; F&#x27; R D&#x27; L D2 F2 B D F&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27; F L&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; 

D&#x27;(D B U2 B&#x27; D&#x27; B U2 B&#x27;) L D&#x27; (29)



Happy cubing!

Your 24-move solution was splendid, well done.<br>
Mirek, as said, missed the skeleton, but he did get an 24-mover anyway.
That was even harder.<br>
But I have to congratulate him with his unbelievable
10-minute-linear-30move-solve!&amp;nbsp; He left me 13 moves behind.<br>
Well-comeback Per, nice to compete you again and of course thanx for
you website. <br>
Also welcome back Alexander, back on track for Dutch Open 2008?<br>

Hope to see you all soon<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I would like to find these optimal solutions in some automatic 
fashion if only i knew how (I&#x27;m limited to do this on linux shared 
hosting!!) 17 htm and 20 qtm is very good. My best ever qtm was 24 or 
25 as far as i can recall it. And nope that wasn&#x27;t one of my 2 19 
turn solutions (Dan never posted my first 19-turner!!) In fact i 
believe i have had 3 19-tuen solutions. One with domino solving 
finish and the other 2 were edges first skeletons with 3 unsolved 
corners (very lucky!!!)

Recently, FMC #208, the scramble was D&#x27; B&#x27; D U F B2 R&#x27; U L2 F U R&#x27; L 
B2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R B&#x27; U2 L D2 U&#x27; B F&#x27; D2 L2 R B&#x27; R2 U2. I did not submit any 
1-hour solution since it took me about 90 minutes. But I posted 
under unlimited time few solutions. One, the best in HTM was 
D&#x27; F2 D F&#x27; U F R B L2 B&#x27; R&#x27; B L B2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R B2 R2 L2 B R L&#x27; (23,29), 
which is 26 &quot;on average&quot;, i.e. (23+29)/2. Another solution was 
D&#x27; F U2 F D F&#x27; U&#x27; F B R&#x27; L&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; L2 B R B R&#x27; B&#x27; L2 B R B&#x27; L  
(24,27) with average 25.5 and the last was  
D&#x27; F U F D B R&#x27; L&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; L2 (L U&#x27; L&#x27; U)3 B L&#x27; R (25,25), having the 
best average and best quarter turns. This was my quarter turn only 
solution after a very long time.

          <div class="email-content">It seemed to me that I had a solve with mostly quarter-turns, so I 
went through the results on Per&#x27;s FMC site and found that were three 
cases where a submitted solution had only two half-turns. Two of 
those were mine: (37,39) on FMC208 (the same scramble that Mirek 
talked about) and (44,46) on FMC187. Someone else had a (34,36) on 
FMC195.

On Per&#x27;s site, I believe those are no submitted solutions (that is, 
not counting any mentioned only in the quote field) with fewer half 
turns than 2. There are also some with 3.

Interesting! I shall try this scramble. You said that Ron won with a
1min linear solution? Really? That&#x27;s awesome. What&#x27;s his and yours
solutions?

Pretty good! Was the sune at the end just luck or did you have to try
a lot of ways? How much time did you spend?

I am taking my opportunity here to announce that I had DNF at this
one.  I shot for sub-30 as usually and used up whole hour without any
success. Even then, about 1 more hour of attempts I found this
scramble quite hard. Nothing below 32 moves. I would post &quot;DNF&quot; if the
submission webpage allowed. 
Hopefully FMC 212 will be easier.

I looked for Ron&#x27;s solution. To make it easier for others, here it is:

D F D&#x27; L U R2
F2 D2 L
F D&#x27; F&#x27; L2 F&#x27; 
z U R U&#x27; B U B&#x27; U R&#x27; 
y&#x27; L F R&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; F R F&#x27; U (31)

Gus noticed that 3-cycle of corners at the end may have been exercised
two moves earlier (which makes it an insertion in our terminology) and
 2 move could have been saved that way. That may be hard to see but
one move could be saved very easily as maybe everybody can see. 
I congratulation Ron. It&#x27;s quite a surprise for me, cause we don&#x27;t see
him competing at fmc.mustcube.net or at www.speedsolving.com. Or do
we? His solution is clean, nice and, yes, lucky.

Gus, can we see your 33-mover?  
I don&#x27;t think I could do better with this scramble. Maybe one-hour
contest. Should we try?

all but 3 corners D&#x27; B2&amp;nbsp; D&#x27; B&#x27; D B&#x27; L&#x27; D B&#x27; D2&amp;nbsp; B D&#x27; R D2 F D2 F&#x27; (26)<br>
at dot&amp;nbsp; (after move 9) insert: R F&#x27; R&#x27; B2 R F R&#x27; B2, 1 move cancels<br>
Spent 15 minutes in the 1st frame (26 moves), then searched 30 minutes
for other options with no results, then turned back to the 1st frame,
made the insertion and checked the solution 3 times!<br>

  <br>
I looked for Ron&#x27;s solution. To make it easier for others, here it is:<br>
  <br>
D F D&#x27; L U R2<br>
F2 D2 L<br>
F D&#x27; F&#x27; L2 F&#x27; <br>
z U R U&#x27; B U B&#x27; U R&#x27; <br>
y&#x27; L F R&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; F R F&#x27; U (31)<br>
  <br>
Gus noticed that 3-cycle of corners at the end may have been exercised<br>
two moves earlier (which makes it an insertion in our terminology) and<br>
2 move could have been saved that way. That may be hard to see but<br>
one move could be saved very easily as maybe everybody can see. <br>
I congratulation Ron. It&#x27;s quite a surprise for me, cause we don&#x27;t see<br>
him competing at fmc.mustcube.&lt;wbr>net or at <a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-abbreviated&quot; href=&quot;http://www.speedsolving&quot;>www.speedsolving</a>.&lt;wbr>com.
Or do<br>
we? His solution is clean, nice and, yes, lucky.<br>
  <br>
Gus, can we see your 33-mover? <br>
I don&#x27;t think I could do better with this scramble. Maybe one-hour<br>
contest. Should we try?<br>

Again this week was an very interesting FMC.<br>
<br>
10 minutes linear : close with 30 (me) and 31 moves (Mirek) solutions! <br>
Also Charles and Eric ended up with sub 40, which is very good.<br>

Great find, Gus! I was too fixed on doing edges first. 
Did you see that in 10-min contest, we started with the same 8 moves?
Next two guys started with another same 7 or 8 moves. 

Have fun with the cube!

For me as long as i have the numbered stickers i am not disturbed by 
the other stickers, but i like the idea. 

Actually i&#x27;d love an applet that let me do insertions, ie possiblity 
to add &quot;stickers&quot; to it.

I had a plan to mae a program aautomatically doing the best 
insertions. This has been &quot;infinitely postponed&quot; because of lack of 
time. I guess many would also see this as cheating. Fm is supposed to 
be a manual art :-)

I&#x27;ve also thought about trying to write a program that would not only 
do insertions, but try to come up with entire solves using techniques 
used by human FMC solvers. A computer should easily be able to try 
millions of such possible solution paths in a small amount of time. 
So I would guess it might always find solutions in the low 20s (or 
sometimes better). Basically, I think it would find solutions that 
humans would miss (but could have found if lucky enough to find the 
right skeleton and insertions in the limited amount of time they 
would spend searching for a solution).

It&#x27;s just pretty low on my priority list of things to do, so I 
probably won&#x27;t get to it for some time.

Of course, I would consider using any computer program to help search 
for solutions  or partial solutions for use in any fewest moves 
contest as cheating, since a computer can perform searches at much 
higher speed (and without making mistakes), giving an unfair 
advantage over a human searching manually. And if a computer is used, 
why not just have it look for optimal solutions?

That is correct. I guess I&#x27;ll rephrase the question. In a limited 
amount of time (one hour)how many possibilites is it humanly possible 
to try out? I have left myself 5-corner cycles on purpose just to 
find out. You have to rush your ass off. You find the first 
insertion, but is it the right one. Is going with the first insertion 
that cancels out the most moves the right move? Sometimes yes, 
sometimes no. Everyone here is extremely sharp, but sometimes you 
have to shoot craps and cross your fingers. If anyone here has ideas 
about doing an &quot;insertion program&quot;, I&#x27;ll wish you good luck and 
advise against it. You don&#x27;t want your hair to fall out or turn gray 
before its time. LOL JK.

          <div class="email-content">I like the short scrambling sequence because it cut time for re-shuffling.
Attempt: D&#x27; B U&#x27; [U2] _ R F R&#x27; F&#x27; D2 [D2] _ R F2 R F L, dead end. The
next is better.
2x2x3: D&#x27; F2 L&#x27; B * U B&#x27; D B D&#x27;
finish edges: D U&#x27; F D&#x27; F U (13), 5-cycle of corners remain.
Insertion of two 3-cycles was not easy this time.
At * : B&#x27; L&#x27; F&#x27; L B2 L&#x27; F L B&#x27; and then after the very first move D R&#x27;
D&#x27; L&#x27; D R D&#x27; L or after the U-turn in the middle U&#x27; F&#x27; D2 F U F&#x27; D2 F
So I have two solutions:
D&#x27; (D R&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; D R D&#x27; L) F2 L2 F&#x27; L B2 L&#x27; F L B&#x27; U B&#x27; D B U&#x27; F D&#x27; F U (25)
and 
D&#x27; F2 L2 F&#x27; L B2 L&#x27; F L B&#x27; U (U&#x27; F&#x27; D2 F U F&#x27; D2 F) B&#x27; D B U&#x27; F D&#x27; F U
(25)

Anyway, I didn&#x27;t watch the time but it took me over an hour since the
insertions were difficult. I would be below one hour with finishing
the corners at the end, say as F L B L&#x27; (U2 F D&#x27; F&#x27; U2 F D F&#x27;) F&#x27; L B&#x27;
L&#x27;. That would be 13+15=28 moves. 

How did you do in this contest? I see some 30-move winner.

Hi Mirek,<br>
<br>
25 moves, amazing.<br>
My solve at Dutch Nationals was: <br>
pseudo F2L minus pair: D&#x27; F2. L&#x27; B U B&#x27; D B D&#x27; (9)<br>
f2l: U&#x27; F&#x27; D F2 U D&#x27; (15)<br>
LL edges: R F2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; (23)<br>
leaving a corner 3-cyle. <br>
to solve at dot insert: U R&#x27; U&#x27; L U R U&#x27; L&#x27; (30 moves)<br>
<br>
I see we had the same 9-move starter. So I really missed a chance for
the 13-move skeleton. Sadly, because I found these start in 5
minutes....<br>

This is very interesting. I considered this 9-move 2x2x3 block<br>
difficult to find! You were  r e a l l y  close to that skeleton and<br>
having 15 minutes or more for insertions would be probably enough for<br>

Hi Mirek,<br>
I was excited when I found these 9 moves, thought&amp;nbsp; 26-moves-finish or
less was possible,&amp;nbsp; 55 minutes left! <br>
But it was hard to concentrate, very noisy game-fancy-fair environment,
people passing by, talking, making remarks etc.<br>
30 moves was best I could make of it.<br>
Next year next try.....<br>

Great start, Eric! This calls for an improvement using insertions. <br>

Great start, Eric! This calls for an improvement using insertions. 

This is what I found for edges insertion, corners stay the same:

B2 L&#x27; U&#x27; F B2 U&#x27; D&#x27; L F&#x27; D&#x27; F (F&#x27; B D&#x27; B D F B&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; L) L&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27; (D L

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Corner insertions are (for the most part) easier to do than edge 
insertions. Corner cycles are intuitive and there arent too many of 
them (i mean a single case has at most 2 sequences normally). An edge 
3-cycle case can have quite a few (near/optimal) sequences available. 
Making exhaustive insertion searches near impossible in a short 
time ...

Not all edge 3-cycles are commutators (in SOME notation)!
(Example : R2 D2 L2 F L2 D2 R2 B.)

          <div class="email-content">Hi All!<br>
<br>
I received an interesting email from Morley Davidson last week. I <br>
have decided to allow his computer generated solutions into the <br>
weekly FMC challenges. For now they are part of the normal solutions, <br>
but i will shortly make an own category so as not to show UNFAIR <br>
resultlists.<br>
<br>
Below i quote his email to me: <br>
<br>
======<br>
<br>
Greetings Per!<br>
<br>
My name is Morley Davidson; I am a mathematics professor at Kent State<br>
University in Ohio. In 2006, my graduate student Joe Miller and I <br>
started<br>
writing software to analyze various speed-solving and FMC solution<br>
methods. We were wondering if you might be interested in adding some<br>
computer results along with the weekly announcement of winners?<br>
<br>
For example, I just ran FMC 216&#x27;s scramble (with winning solutions at <br>
28<br>
HTM) using the solution partition<br>
<br>
[2x2, 2x2x3, F2L minus one slot, ZBF2L, ZBLL]<br>
<br>
in our depth-first search routine. This routine compares solutions in <br>
HTM<br>
using all permissible conjugations by whole-cube symmetries (M group) <br>
at<br>
each of these 5 steps. After searching just a fraction of the whole <br>
tree,<br>
it found several sub-30 (in HTM) solutions; I&#x27;ll paste these partial<br>
results to the end of this message. I didn&#x27;t bother to include the<br>
solutions it found with more than 32 moves, and I only had it output<br>
solutions which are strictly fewer moves than the previous minimum. <br>
Also,<br>
I only had it print out one solution at a given depth, even if <br>
multiple<br>
ones were found. In this example I also didn&#x27;t have it take advantage <br>
of<br>
pseudo-blocks or back-tracking, but we can do that with no problem. <br>
On the<br>
other hand, it is taking advantage of ALL optimal (in HTM) solutions <br>
to<br>
each step, although this can easily be replaced with any given set of<br>
(e.g. single choice of ) alg representatives. We could also replace <br>
this<br>
partition with many other popular solution methods, for example CFOP <br>
with<br>
LL in two or even one step (it took some doing, but in the summer we<br>
calculated all optimal LL-at-once algs-- Helmstetter&#x27;s tables are <br>
missing<br>
many optimals).<br>
<br>
It might be interesting to FMC regulars to see what the computer <br>
comes up<br>
with each week using a variety of popular &quot;human&quot; partitions and<br>
techniques...it doesn&#x27;t always win! But of course we could expand its<br>
search tree to include things like doing the 2x2x3 in one step, which <br>
it<br>
appears that many winning FMC solves do.<br>
<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>
Morley<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,
   In fact, I was surprised that this optimal two-stage (2x2x3 block)
computer solution is not much better. This suggests that one pre-move
is neccessary tyo include to the search so that we can see how close
humans can be. We still have a huge advantage over this program when
being able to do some insertions.
  
BTW, would you put a link to this forum on your FMC web page? I think
many people who find the competition pages don&#x27;t know how to
communicate with us. 

I&#x27;d be interested to see where Helmstetter&#x27;s tables are not optimal
and also to see some alternative solutions of equal lengths or shorter
in quarter turns.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Mirek!!

A optimal &quot;human&quot; computer solution would not necessarily have an 
optimal start for the first stage(s). Indeed we also see that many 
good fully human solutions start off with a suboptimal block for 
instance. A super start often results in &quot;dead locks&quot; later. Due to 
bad edge orientations or whatever ...

More often than not an optimal 2x2x3 block gives a quite bad 
continued human solution. I can not back this up with statistics, but 
my experience tells me so. You and Guus and others often experiment 
with inserting random moves into a block start for better 
continuation...

Yes insertions is a major area for &quot;human&quot; computer solutions. I do 
not think that Morley has thought about skeleton + insertion 
techniques as a human approach ;-) I had the idea to write an 
insertion software already yrs ago, i guess 2005. But i never got 
going with it. Due to quite obvious complications. A solely corner 
insertion software is not overly complicated and could be made in a 
couple of weeks of hard work (at most).

And yes, a link to this forum from the FMC site is an excellent idea. 
I will think about the best way to do this. Direct link from top manu 
is an obvious candidate ;-)

Except it seems quite clear to me that it&#x27;s against the rules to use 
Cube Companion for the 1-hour solution.

I&#x27;ve also always assumed it was illegal to use Cube Companion for the 
10-minute (&quot;speed format&quot;) solution, but after rereading the rules, 
it&#x27;s not clear to me that it actually is. If it is legal for the 10-
minute (&quot;speed&quot;) solution, then I would assume you still have to use 
Cube Companion in a way that complies with the rules about counting 
every move you make on the cube and not starting over, etc.

For classic (&quot;unlimited&quot; time) solution, of course, it&#x27;s explicitly 
allowed.

(By the way, is there any decent documentation on using Cube 
Companion?)

I&#x27;ve also noticed people using the word &quot;linear&quot; with two different 
meanings in the context of fewest moves solving:
1) Solving without insertions (perhaps without using pre-moves as 
well).
2) Solving directly from a scrambled cube to a solved cube where 
every move made on the cube along the way counts in the solution, 
even if you undo or change a move. (And even for this meaning 
of &quot;linear,&quot; different counting rules can be used.)

          <div class="email-content">The Cube Companion performs &quot;instantaneous&quot; scrambling for you. That 
is clearly &quot;unfair&quot; compared to WCA fewest moves solving (1-hour) 
procedures as it can save a significant amount of time.

In FMC 217, someone submitted two solutions for speed. They were 
really for the same solve, but moves entered differently. In one 
case, same-layer moves across a step boundary were entered as a 
single move, and in the other case those moves across the step 
boundary were optimized to a single move. It seems to me, the rules 
imply those moves across a step boundary should be counted as two 
moves, unless the person had actually looked ahead and performed them 
as a single move. I&#x27;m guessing the competitor submitted a 2nd entry 
thinking it would replace the other, and perhaps the 2nd entry was 
the non-optimized version. But I can&#x27;t tell. Perhaps the rules should 
include examples on how moves are to be counted in situations like 
this.

I&#x27;m trying to be friendly, and not explicitly calling anyone a 
cheater, but *if* people are playing by different rules, then to me 
the results are rather meaningless. My intent is to have a friendly 
discussion of what&#x27;s fair under the rules, not to make personal 
attacks.

As for Cube Companion, the help doesn&#x27;t mention that shift or alt can 
be used for moving in the other direction (such as counter-clockwise 
for face turns). As far as I know, you can&#x27;t directly apply half-
turns on the cube applets. The Help button does not give any 
information about the combo box. And generally, I find the user 
interface rather quirky, and you have to play with it for a little 
while to understand it. And I&#x27;ve wondered if you perform moves on the 
cube applet, if those moves are recorded and could be transferred to 
the solution text box some way.

          <div class="email-content">Bruce, we have two kinds of rules for 10 mins linear speed solving. It
was Ryan Heise, who introduced this format a year or two ago. He also
set up rules
(http://www.ryanheise.com/competitions/linearfmc/page.cgi?file=Rules).
Under these rules, conscutive turns with one face count as one move.
For example, R R, R&#x27; R, R R2, and R2 R2 are always counted as 1 move.
Notice that R&#x27; R can be written as R0 being 1 move. 
Then we have Per&#x27;s FMC page, currently active website, where (you&#x27;re
right) the rules imply that two separate turns are counted as two
moves. I personaly like the original Ryan&#x27;s rules better. I vote for
adopting the original rule and chnaging the text at
http://fmc.mustcube.net/fmcrules.php

What is others&#x27; opinion?

It was me!<br>
I agree with Mirek that R R should be counted as one move, (so does
R&#x27;R, R2 R2, R2 R etc..)<br>
Becasue of that I posted my solution another time with &quot;normalized&quot;
moves.<br>
In my opinion Per&#x27;s counting algorithm is not correct. R R should be
counted as one.<br>
<br>
I use online FMC-competitions as a training for real competitions, for
fun and spending my time during travelling to my work (without a
laptop). <br>
So Cube Companion does not belong to my training attributes.<br>

getting off the thread topic.

Yes, I remember Heise announcing a &quot;Linear FMC&quot; competition, but I 
didn&#x27;t participate in it. And, as Mirek said, I thought Heise&#x27;s rules 
on counting moves were a little different from Per&#x27;s. As far as I&#x27;m 
concerned, it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of difference to me which scheme is 
used going forward. Per&#x27;s rules may encourage trying to look ahead a 
little more, while Heise&#x27;s rules may be what several people are 
accustomed to using. I may be slightly inclined to favor switching to 
Heise&#x27;s rules if that means better compliance among competitors. (I 
note that so far, I&#x27;ve rarely actually submitted &quot;speed&quot; solutions on 
Per&#x27;s site. I&#x27;ve done a number of them, but usually used too much 
time considering how to proceed to build blocks and run over the time 
limit.)

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I do not intend to make ctaegories or ways of submission that makes 
the FMC a manual task for me. The beauty of my site (as i see it) is 
that it runs itself fully automatically. We dont have to wait until 
some admin goes through all submissions and lets them through for 
results compilation. This said, i still follow my ban policy. So 
previous entries may vanish in thin air if i decide to ban a solution. 
Actually the banning works like this: the contrubutor is completely 
banned. All his/her solutions are removed from any result lists. The 
solutions however do remain in the database. A ban may be disputed by 
contacting me and dicussing the solution(s).

I do as of yet not have way of counting turns other than in a brut 
force manner. So a solution submitted as F R R B&#x27; would be 4 turns and 
not 3 as it should. I see this as a mistake in submission actually. I 
believe the same rather harsh treatment is done in official WCA 
competitions. The judges will not simplify notation to make a solution 
shorter. I think this is only fair :-)

Just bring enough dark stickers so that you put a dark sticker on any 
cubie face not getting a regular (numbered) sticker :D A time waster 
of course.

I guess dark cube for fewest moves insertions would be comparable to 
(semi) transparent cubes for speedsolving. If the issue came up to 
higher level i&#x27;m sure such cube would be EXPLICITLY disallowed. And 
besides, the people writing the regulations are not necessarily the 
ones who understands the art of FM&#x27;ing the best :-P

<br>
For now you cannot easily submit directly from the cube companion. I <br>
do not see this as a serious obstacle. It is NOT hard to copy the move <br>
sequence from the edit box. In my experience. The more little user <br>
friendly quirks you put into a website the more such quirks the <br>
user(s) will request - biting the hand that feeds syndrome.<br>
<br>
On the more technical side i deliberately did not code sessions and <br>
session variables into the site. This is in spirit with the old FMC <br>
site. You cannot just log into the site and remain logged in. If the <br>
majority of users request this i will consider it. I designed the site <br>
for simplicity- There are still many things i want to improve. And new <br>
features i want to add. But i still want to leave the site very easy <br>
to use and have the results come up every week automatically, with no <br>
prescreening (except permanent banning of course). The results are <br>
compiled on the fly.<br>
<br>
There&#x27;s a script running to check for rollover every time a user <br>

Depending on how you arrive at your f2l solution. In many cases a few 
insertions would be more efficent than the optimal LL sequence ;-) 
Basically find a new f2l start until you can insert 2 short algs. So 
knowing all of LL algorithms in many cases won&#x27;t be more useful than 
learning proper insertion techniques ;-)

The easiest way to adopt the Ryan&#x27;s rules will be accepting notation
as R0, F0, U0, and such. Whenever we returned a move we would use this
notation to make sure it&#x27;s counted according the rules. You would not
have to change the move counting script.  
I agree that a big plus of your site is that it runs automatically. I
remember Dan Harris having hard time with sorting all the submitted
solutions, which I believe eventually killed his site.

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Mirek that whether or not the way moves are to be 
counted is changed for the speed challenge, there&#x27;s no reason that 
the move counting should require any manual involvement. Some one-
time work would be required to implement Heise&#x27;s version of move 
counting, as Mirek indicated.

Whether what is submitted properly represents the sequence of moves 
actually performed on the cube is another thing, and I don&#x27;t see how 
that can be detected automatically or even manually if the submitter 
doesn&#x27;t actually admit it in some way. (Of course, for 
official/classic challenges, there is no requirement to actually make 
the moves on a cube! This applies strictly to the speed challenge.)

Quoting Per&#x27;s message:
> I do as of yet not have way of counting
> turns other than in a brut
> force manner. So a solution submitted as

> not 3 as it should.

For official/classic challenges, for sure this would be a &quot;mistake&quot; 
in submitting the solution. Now let&#x27;s consider the speed challenge.

Let&#x27;s say the user performs move F, and writes down &quot;F&quot;. Then the 
user performs move R, and writes down &quot;R&quot;. Then after thinking awhile 
what to do next, the user decides to do move R again. In 
official/classic solving, the user would simply add a &quot;2&quot; after 
the &quot;R&quot; he/she already wrote down, to change the previous move from R 
to R2. But if this is considered to be what the speed challenge rules 
refer to as &quot;changing a move,&quot; then it appears that the person is 
*expected* to notate this as &quot;R R&quot; instead of &quot;R2&quot; and have it 
counted as two moves. If that is not how the speed challenge rules 
are meant to be interpreted, then a clarification would be nice so 
that some persons don&#x27;t unnecessarily penalize themselves in this way.

> I believe the same rather harsh treatment
> is done in official WCA competitions. 

But official WCA competitions do not have a &quot;linear FMC&quot; format.

To get back to the thread topic, I did not think that my suggestion 
to allow people to submit solutions that they themselves flagged 
as &quot;illegal&quot; solutions would in any way require any manual tasks for 
the person running the site (Per). Before further discussion I&#x27;ll 
quote from one of Per&#x27;s messages.

Per mentions making a &quot;category&quot; for allowing these computer-
generated solutions. OK, I&#x27;ve just noticed he has actually already 
implemented this! What he has done is to make it a fourth category in 
addition to official/classic/speed. The submission form has been 
updated to allow the user to select this. So it looks like any user 
could submit such solutions. But by the title, Per seems to intend it 
only for computer-generated solutions, instead of also for &quot;unfair&quot; 
human-generated solutions. Perhaps Per will clarify if this choice is 
open to everyone, and what rules may apply to its use.

I also guess that this implementation does not support submitting 
solutions for the speed challenge scramble in this &quot;computer-
generated&quot; category. My idea would have been to allow either classic 
or speed solutions to have this &quot;unfair solution&quot; flag.

Any ways, it&#x27;s nice to see Per has implemented this new category so 
soon. I was expecting it would probably be a few weeks (or more).

I will try to implement that simple layer check in the counting 
routine. It only affects the counting and not the validity 
verification. However, now i have to treat categories differently. A 
fairly small problem i would guess.

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s what i meant. Actually in Euro 2006 i brought prenumbered 
stickers to the fmc event. I had 2 sets of stickers numbered 1-5. 
Nobody said anything. In fact, my stickers were paper stickers. 
Prenumbered small sheets of paper and had looped scotch tape on the 
flipside for easy attachment. They were not &quot;normal&quot; stickers.

          <div class="email-content">Hi All :-)<br>
<br>
After a long time spent thinking i have decided not to change the <br>
automatic count - including speed solutions. The turns will be counted <br>
as they stand. However the time spent on writing/submitting a solution <br>
is not included in the 10 minutes. Automatic corrections would not <br>
treat all the metrics correctly. When having achieved a notation move <br>
reduction like R R &gt; R2. The quote should include all the original <br>
moves taken.<br>
<br>
If original sequence was like .... F R&#x27; R D2 .... it is NOT allowed to <br>
delete the R&#x27; R entirely as this would break with another rule. <br>
Rewrite .... L L ... to  .... L2 .... is ALLOWED!!<br>
<br>
I will probably rewrite/clarify the rules in the near future.<br>
