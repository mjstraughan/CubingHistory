          <div class="email-content">Hey all!

Since Dan is away all this week i would like to post my &quot;results&quot; 
here.
For now i will only submit the lenghts of my found solutions. As i 
understand it Dan will not accept entries for this challenge already 
since a new one is already open. I will submit my full solutions here 
if there is any interest:

2x2x2: 5 turns
2x2x3: 8 turns
1 roux: 5 turns
2 roux: 12 turns
f2l: 14 turns
edges only: 12 turns (no useful corners gained)
1-face/1-layer: 9 turns (same solution, didn&#x27;t find shorter for just 
1-face than for 1-layer, a bit odd, but found many of same length;-))
full cube: 23 turns(10 + 7 + 9 + 1 - 4)
corners only: no time to complete my search for this, when full cube 
was done it was already 11 pm day before the deadline and i was 
knackered.

I found all these solutions during the saturday, 7-8 hrs spent in 
total ;-)

Have fun!

   people, incluing me, come here infrequently. There not much going
on. At least your message is here :-). The Christmas challenge was
really challenging, so I didn&#x27;t try all the tasks. In fact, I tried
few. This week challenge is tough but if you&#x27;re finished with it, go
back to the Christmas one and look for one face in 8 moves. I may work
on 1 layer in 9 moves that I didn&#x27;t find back then. 
   
Happy cubing!

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m forwarding a message i got from Richard Carr:

(Personally, I think a better way to measure this fewest moves record 
is either a) least
number of moves taken above the optimum or least ratio (moves 
taken)/optimum, After
all, if non-optimal solution 19 was reached (for a cube requiring 18 
moves( then a solution
requiring 20 moves could never even equal the record even if the 
optimal solution was
found.

This sounds to me like a great idea. Especially for official world 
records. Of course it will not change results order each week for the 
fmc. And if fmc starts to use this, the &quot;categories&quot; must be changed 
also. For instance a ratio better than 1.5 is expert, better than 2.0 
is advanced and so on ...

Rating system may also change. Instead of using the average solution 
length in the calculations one could use the optimal length 
multiplied by a factor...

Anyone has any comments??

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been talking to the WCA guys about the timing for official FMC  
competitions.

I think 60 minutes is just too little time to do a serious FMC  
solution. With all the time spent setting up your cubes, getting  
started on on side, and writing down the solution and double checking  
it on the other,  I&#x27;m pretty much just using 30 minutes for actual  
solving. My suggestion is to use 90 minutes instead, which would  
effectively double the time, while still not killing the schedule for  
a one day competition.

An other argument is that Mirek&#x27;s official world record was in fact  
set using 90 minutes, which makes things fairly odd right now.

They&#x27;re not opposed to the idea, but they want to hear this from a  
majority of FMC solvers, rather than just me. Which is as it should be.

I realize some people would prefer to have much shorter fewest moves  
competitions where you get to solve in a few minutes, just counting  
actual physical moves. I think that is a very valid competition  
format that I would really like to do, but I think it&#x27;s a *very*  
different thing than the FMC solving, and those things should be  
separate events with separate rules , records, titles etc. Trying to  
force both things into some compromise would just combine the worst  
of both worlds.

So what do people think?

          <div class="email-content">I agree.

  I have yet to be able to compete in a competition,
but I know that an extra 30min can mean a few more
moves taken off, which is great for pure competition.

  I would also like to see a 3-5min solve FMC where
you get one solve with moves counted, just a good
veriation of the FMC.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I may be partially guilty for the 60 mins time limit. I was once 
asked by Ron about what time limit is suitable for fewest moves. And 
i recall that i answered either 60 or 90 minutes is too short for me, 
so it doesn&#x27;t matter too much ...

But yeah, regarding Mirek and 90 minutes, Zbigniew equalled 28 turns 
with 60 mins time limit so the record would still stand, but perhaps 
not being shared ...

Anyway, ideally for me the fewest moves event would take at least 3 
hrs, but i know that&#x27;s not practical for competitions. Time limit is 
not really a BIG deal. The time is same for everyone, and we can 
prepare for that time limit. Me not being able to do my best in 60 
mins is my own fault, not practicing the official format enough :-o

I am definitely in favour of having a 90 minute time limit, for all of the

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

I saw this discussion and thought: &quot;Oh no, not again.... :-(&quot;.

What is the goal of the event? 
I think it is to decide which competitor is best at solving FMC, given certain parameters.
So the goal is not to find the shortest solution ever for FMC.

An important parameter is the time for the solve.
I think the optimal time for the solve is the time:
1) needed for competitors to find a decent solution and check it
2) suitable for competition organisers to fit the FMC event into the time schedule (FMC will often be overlapping with other events)
3) appealing enough for non frequent FMC competitors to also give it a try (only a little overlapping is OK)

I see no proof that 1) is a problem.
I know 2) is a problem. There were actually competitors who wanted to do &#x27;best of 2&#x27; or &#x27;average of 2&#x27; because that would be a better format.
I see that 3) the number of competitors has risen since FMC is 60 minutes.</div>

  Hi Lars,

  I am definitely in favour of having a 9=
0 minute time limit, for all of the reasons you describe.

  I have emailed=
 Ron also, to let him know my opinion.

  Thanks for voicing your concerns!=

  Dan :)

  I&#x27;ve been talking to the WCA guys abou=
t the timing for official FMC 
  competitions.

  I think 60 minutes is jus=
t too little time to do a serious FMC 
  solution. With all the time spent =
setting up your cubes, getting 
  started on on side, and writing down the =
solution and double checking 
  it on the other, I&#x27;m pretty much just using=
 30 minutes for actual 
  solving. My suggestion is to use 90 minutes inste=
ad, which would 
  effectively double the time, while still not killing the=
 schedule for 
  a one day competition.

  An other argument is that Mirek&#x27;=
s official world record was in fact 
  set using 90 minutes, which makes th=
ings fairly odd right now.

  They&#x27;re not opposed to the idea, but they wan=
t to hear this from a 
  majority of FMC solvers, rather than just me. Whic=
h is as it should be.

  I realize some people would prefer to have much sh=
orter fewest moves 
  competitions where you get to solve in a few minutes,=
 just counting 
  actual physical moves. I think that is a very valid compe=
tition 
  format that I would really like to do, but I think it&#x27;s a *very* =

  different thing than the FMC solving, and those things should be 
  sepa=
rate events with separate rules , records, titles etc. Trying to 
  force b=
oth things into some compromise would just combine the worst 
  of both wor=
lds.

  So what do people think?

I supposed the WCA guys you talked too are Tyson. When he submitted
the request, I gave my opinion which was:

&quot;60 minutes is not that short. Of course you can find better solutions
with more time, but: 

- Because you need time for scrambling, solving, checking, writing, 30
mins is a bit too short. 
- In 60 mins, you got time to find advanced solutions. 
- In 90 mins, you could do better, but maybe not significantly better. 
- 3 hours or more: that&#x27;s what some FMCers would need...&quot;

So I agree that 60 minutes is the minimum for such an event that is
very different from linear cubing (fast or slow).

Per&#x27;s comment seems to confirm my last point, and I think many would
still be very angry with &quot;only&quot; 90 minutes, but I can perfectly
understand that with 90 minutes some can feel much more comfortable
and get more elaborate intuitions and solutions.

How many cubers do consider that 60 minutes is hardly acceptable,
whereas 90 minutes would be much better?

Gilles.


P.S.: I used to naïvely consider speed solving and optimized solving
as equally important. So, I was a bit sad when we had only 1 round (1
hour) for the whole optimized solving category at the european champ,
because of lack of popularity and organizational constraints.</div>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I will just repeat my point. Personally i think either 60 or 90 mins 
is way too little for a serious solution, but at least it&#x27;s same for 
everyone. And yes a shorter time may appeal more to other cubers than 
a longer time allowed.

Ideally i would prefer to have best-of-2 or avg-of-2 with 60 mins 
rather than than just a single 90 mins solve.

When we know the constraints we can prepare for that...

We will never have perfect cubes and never enough time for all events 
we want. Life is compromises. For hardcore fewest-movers we already 
have the fmc allowing us to spend days on a scramble ;-)

I submitted my solution on Tuesday (last week), 22 moves. =) My first

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody,
 
Firstly, apologies to the speedcubing group, if you are uninterested in FMC
then please do not bother with this post, I only posted in here to more
quickly get hold of some of the regular readers of both your group and the
FMC group.
 
I am really sorry for my prolonged period of absence and negligence with the
FMC pages for the past few weeks. I can only offer in my defence that I have
been snowed under with both university work, and work work, followed by a 10
day stint in Germany, and then food poisoning! :(
 
I&#x27;m sorry that you had to also post your results in the FMC forum, when they
should have been readily available on the website.
 
All the results have been posted now (bar the Xmas ones, again sorry!), and
the ratings have been updated. FMC 140 was an amazing week, despite
everything we still had 13 entries! plus 2 computer generated ones,
unapproved of course. 
 
I hope to see you all for FMC #141, which will kick off at midnight on
Monday 12th Feb :) at www.cubestation.co.uk 
 
All the best,
DanH :)</div>

          <strong>21. FMC companion configuration</strong><br>
          <em>From:</em> &quot;fonnny&quot; &lt;superdoubledan@...&gt;<br>

          <div class="email-content">First of all, let me just say that I love the FMC companion - it&#x27;s
quite helpful for me.  One thing I did find somewhat annoying is
having to keep changing the colors of the (online) cube to match my
physical cube.    It&#x27;s nice that the option is there to change them,
but it was frustrating not having them persist.

So in looking at the HTML code, I found a way to set it up the way my
cube is, and I thought I&#x27;d share it in case anyone else could be
helped by this.  You don&#x27;t have to be HTML savvy to do this, but it
certainly helps.

There are 2 things that need to change.

First, in right.html find the line that says

&lt;param name=&quot;faces&quot; value=&quot;r,g,w,o,b,y&quot;>

That&#x27;s the colors for the front, right, down, back, left and up faces.
 Change those letters to the colors of your cube.  In my case, I
changed it to say 
&lt;param name=&quot;faces&quot; value=&quot;b,o,y,g,r,w&quot;> - white on top, blue in front
and red to the left

Then, in left.html look for the line that says

&lt;td>&lt;select name=&quot;front&quot;>&lt;option value=&quot;b&quot;>Blue&lt;/option>&lt;option
value=&quot;g&quot;>Green&lt;/option>&lt;option value=&quot;o&quot;>Orange&lt;/option>&lt;option
value=&quot;r&quot; selected>Red&lt;/option>&lt;option value=&quot;w&quot;>White&lt;/option>&lt;option
value=&quot;y&quot;>Yellow&lt;/option>&lt;/select>&lt;/td>

That&#x27;s the select box for the front face.  Currently red is &quot;selected&quot;
by having the keyword selected right after the value tag.  Move the
word selected to after the color that is your front face (in my case
blue).  So mine says

&lt;td>&lt;select name=&quot;front&quot;>&lt;option value=&quot;b&quot;
selected>Blue&lt;/option>&lt;option value=&quot;g&quot;>Green&lt;/option>&lt;option
value=&quot;o&quot;>Orange&lt;/option>&lt;option value=&quot;r&quot; >Red&lt;/option>&lt;option
value=&quot;w&quot;>White&lt;/option>&lt;option value=&quot;y&quot;>Yellow&lt;/option>&lt;/select>&lt;/td>

You&#x27;ll have to do that for each of the 6 lines corresponding to the 6
faces.  

Hope this helps someone.  

I was wondering where all the other solvers were for FMC 141 - when I
looked at the results yesterday I was very surprised to see myself
having (apparently) won?!?  I see now the full results are up and I
find myself in 5th - much closer to where I would expect to be :-)

I have already done this for my comnpanion. Plus i added one more 
cube to play with, and other small fixes that work nicely in Internet 
Explorer. More compact GUI and each select now has the proper color 
via CSS :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys :-)

I wanted to submit my solution to fmc #142 yesterday, but dans site 
was already mistakenly showing #143 already. So, because of that i 
had to email Dan my solution. It seems he is not around this 
weekend, probably at Belgian Open so i just gonna show my solution 
here:

Solution:
B&#x27; L U&#x27; R&#x27; B2 D2 L U R F&#x27; D&#x27; R2 D R L&#x27; F2 L B&#x27; L&#x27; F2 L R B&#x27; R&#x27; B R&#x27;

Quote:
B&#x27; L U&#x27; R&#x27; B2 D2 L U R F&#x27; does a 2x2x3 block. Now i do D&#x27; R2 D 
leaving 4 edges and 2 corners to be solved. The following conjugate 
solves the 4 edges and leaves 3 corners unsolved: R B&#x27; R-B&#x27;-R&#x27; B R&#x27;. 
Then i have B&#x27; L U&#x27; R&#x27; B2 D2 L U R F&#x27; R.B&#x27; R B&#x27; R&#x27; B R&#x27; Now i insert 
L&#x27; F2 L B&#x27; L&#x27; F2 L B at the dot cancelling 2 turns and gaining a 
slice turn :-) About 2 hours spent in total. Still im too slow ...

Here is my solution:

QR&#x27; - R&#x27; F&#x27; L F2 U2 L2 F - U&#x27; B2 U2 R2 - U R&#x27; U F&#x27; U2 F R - L U2 L&#x27;

U2 - L2 U S U2 S&#x27; U L2

56 HTM 53 STM 68 QTM (if I counted it correctly)

At first a cube orintation QR&#x27;, then a 2x2x2 block R&#x27; F&#x27; L F2 U2 L2 
F, expand to Xcross U&#x27; B2 U2 R2, second pair U R&#x27; U F&#x27; U2 F R, third 
L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U2 L&#x27;, last pair U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F U R&#x27; F R F&#x27;, and then a 
inverse Sune for CLL R U R&#x27; U L&#x27; U R U&#x27; L U2 R&#x27;, align U-layer using 
U2 and then the only easy step I had in this solve, a U-PLL as the 
ELL case L2 U S U2 S&#x27; U L2

Not wery good, I seldomly get this hig figures, but it is at leat a 
result and I only spent 21 of the 60 minutes to get here.

My solution: http://grrroux.free.fr/belgique2007/my_fmc.JPG
32 HTM, 27 STM

In the last 6 months, I think I did 6 FMC, including the Euro and the
Belgian open. Everytime, I got between 30 and 32. It means that I always
have the same amount of luck.
As usual, I found this solution in a bit less than 30 minutes, after
trying a few different starts in 11-12 moves for the 2 first blocks.
Then, I began to start exploring other ways. It wasn&#x27;t looking easy, the
room was becoming noisy, so I just wrote this solution down, checked 4
times to avoid surprises, took a photograph and left.

If you ask me, a 30-minute event would be fine. :-)

At first I thought your stopwatch said 50 seconds :-)

Anyway, that mistake inspired me to do a linear solution:

          <div class="email-content">OK, here is what I do.

 

Imagine I have found a skeleton solution with 3 corners left to solve. These
could be any 3 corners, and twisted in any direction.

 

So I then put numbers on the pieces, 1, 2 and 3. You have to make sure that
you are doing the correct cycle of stickers, not just pieces. So if for
example, you put number 1 on the Yellow of Yellow-Green-Red, then number 2
would go on the corner piece that is in the Yellow-Green-Red position, upon
the sticker that would be Yellow if the Yellow-Green-Red were in it&#x27;s
correct position. 

 

Now, we can track those corner stickers at any point in the solution. The
three corners can be solved using an 8-move commutator, which you make up on
the fly. The commutator is of the form PQP&#x27;Q&#x27;. So when going through the
solution, after each move you note where the corners are, and try to find 8
move commutators which solve the 3-cycle. It doesn&#x27;t matter where in the
solution you do it, because the commutator affects only those 3 corners, so
you try to do it at the optimal point, where the most moves cancel. You
would be lucky to cancel more than 4 moves I think, but 4 is very good.

 

On a solved cube, you could do R&#x27; D R U2 R&#x27; D&#x27; R U2 - this is one of those 8
move commutators, see how it affects the 3 corners only. 

 

Im very rushed for time, so can&#x27;t explain further, but if anyone else could
help clarify what I&#x27;ve written (if needed) that would be great.

 

All this was made possible by the Godfather of commutators in FMC and
cubing, Per Kristen Fredlund.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

2 tips for now:

When u end up with edge or corner 3-cycle put numbered stickers on 
them so that cycling them in order of the stickers will solve them. 
In some cases this may not be possible (if you have singular flipped 
edge(s) or twisted singular corners. Or other &quot;bad&quot; cycles. 
Understanding cycles is a main concept for understanding what goes 
on during the insertions.

Another thing is making up 3-cycles from basic principles, namely 
commutators and conjugates. These are not hard concepts to grasp. 
But surely this is stepping outside  normal speedsolving paths. 
Fewest moves solving is not a tabular exercise!!

I will come back with more, but i hope this will trigger the small 
grey cells to some serious self-study ;-)

Have fun!!

No mention of Mirek Goljan? It was &quot;all&quot; made possible by Per?

(Actually, Mirek was the first person of the two to discover (1981)
*and* teach us (2003) how to do it.)

Ok, although I think you might have worded it more clearly, to sound
less like &quot;We have Per to thank for insertions&quot;, and more like &quot;*I* have
Per to thank for *teaching me* insertions&quot;.

For example,

There is another technique for solving in few moves with the aid of a
computer, known as the two phase algorithm, which works by defining a
group G1 = &lt;U,D,R2,L2,F2,B2> which is a subset of the entire cube group
G = &lt;U,D,R,L,F,B>. The ingenious algorithm works as follows. In the
first phase, the algorithm searches for a sequence that will transform
the cube into G1. Then the second phase searches for a sequence using
&quot;only&quot; the moves from G1 to transform the cube into G.

All this was made possible by Josef Jelinek, the Godfather of computer
solver designers.


I think most people would want to clarify that Herbert Kociemba and
Josef Jelinek both developed similar solving programs, Herbert&#x27;s was
called &quot;two-phase algorithm&quot;, Josef&#x27;s was called ACube, and Herbert
invented his first. (Not exactly the same kind of scenario, but good
enough to get the idea, I think).

I hope this explains how I interpreted your statement :-)

In any case, I&#x27;m glad you have clarified everything above.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

it could be that Mirek did insertions before me, but i thought that 
up the same on my own also early-mid 80s and i had never heard of 
anyone doing that before. Ironically i first used that technique 
exclusively for making pretty patterns, while i was actually still 
only doing linear fewest moves solutions, with basic backtracking, 
only. There was no code or anything of the kind to give me randowm 
scrambles back then , so i never wrote down the scrambles or 
solutions, just counting the moves - taking averages of 10. And i 
then did the same for supersolving because i found it even more 
challenging. If my memory is correct my best ever linear solves back 
then was 24 turns for normal solving and 28 turns for supersolving. 
My technique was the main part cross-first and then clever c/e pair 
insertions and corner cycling finishing.

About the 2-phase solution, neither Herbert Kociemba nor Josef 
Jelinek developed that. Mike Reid was the first to make software 
based on that method. But with all respect Herbert Kociemba was the 
first who made a really user friendly version of a 2-phase solver 
for the public masses. Cube Explorer has lots of features ACube 
lacks, basically because these features do require a graphical 
frontend. Acube does also have its own unique features lacking in 
Cube Explorer. So it&#x27;s great to have both :-)

I&#x27;m not disputing this, so rest easy :-)  My purpose is just to let
people know (who didn&#x27;t already know) that this technique was first
introduced to the FMC by Mirek Goljan more than a year before you joined
FMC, and when we credit someone by saying &quot;all this was made possible by
...someone...&quot; we should be careful so that people are aware that Mirek
did introduce it earlier.

This is not true. You say it like it&#x27;s true, so some people might
believe you, but again I think we should be extremely careful when
assigning credit.

The path of influence was as follows:

Thistlethwaite (4 phase)
-> Kociemba (2 phase)
------> Reid (optimal)
------> Jelinek (partial)

These people are also respectful and particular about giving credit, and
you will find nowhere on Kociemba&#x27;s page that he based is work on Mike
Reid&#x27;s. However, you will find on Mike Reid&#x27;s page that he based his
work on Kociemba&#x27;s. Similarly, Josef Jelinek gives credit to both
Kociemba and Reid.

Let&#x27;s not diminish Kociemba&#x27;s contribution. He not only developed the 2
phase algorithm, but also developed new and efficient ways to represent
cube permutations and orientations that made large-scale searches
possible.

I should add to this that after Reid developed his famous &quot;optimal&quot;
solver, based on Kociemba&#x27;s work, the Kociemba used Reid&#x27;s ideas to add
an &quot;optimal&quot; feature to his own CubeExplorer program. So, there is a
path of influence as follows:

Kociemba (2 phase) [1] -> Reid (optimal) [2] -> Kociemba (optimal) [3]

Yes i got my facts slightly wrong. Mike Reid&#x27;s solver that predates 
Kociemba&#x27;s was optimal but was based on a single phase algorithm. 
Kociemba does give credit to Reid, but not as far as the 2-phase 
algorithm is concerned. I stay corrected. In fact it seems that they 
fed ideas off eachother for a while in early-mid 90s. And yes it all 
stems from Tisthlethwaite&#x27;s groundbreaking work on nested subgroups.

Fucking Christ! I didn&#x27;t want an argument to ensue about who did what 
and when. I just wanted advice. And there&#x27;s plenty of it. I&#x27;ve  been 
taking this all in. Like Per said, I&#x27;ve been too linear. Maybe a 
little lsd wiil help me see things more clearly.

Anyway, you received several answers to your question, and it is not
forbidden for someone to want to clarify something in someone else&#x27;s

incorrect in it.

And if you stay around long enough, you might see what a &quot;real&quot; debate

Just want to say, although I find this language unwelcome, I do want to
welcome you to the group. It seems you do just want to learn more
mysteries behind the cube, like the rest of us. But beware, we do tend
to have debates and have offtopic threads. I just hope we don&#x27;t have to

I want to apologize for that. As my brother reminded me, even though 
that is my normal everyday speaking language, I shouldn&#x27;t bring that 
to this forum. It won&#x27;t happen again, and I&#x27;ll think before I type. 
As a matter of fact, I don&#x27;t think I censored myself in a few im&#x27;s to 
Dan. But that was different. That was one on one. I should have 
considered that all ages are reading this. Again, Sorry.</div>

It&#x27;s common to have precomputed sequences for the G1 phase. Search in 
G is done until some predetermined length and a match in G1 is sought 
by simple table lookup (pruning).

The advantage of ACube (so far) over Cube Explorer is that ACube uses 
pruning also for a non fully specified cube, whereas Cube Explorer 
doesn&#x27;t do this as of yet.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan,
 
The best rule of thumb is to not do anything you couldn&#x27;t do in a
competition. 
 
Therefore if you want to write out computations on a piece of paper, that is
perfectly allowable. If you can&#x27;t do all that in less than 60 minutes, you
have to of course wonder if it&#x27;s very good practice for competition FMC, but
for the purposes of the weekly online FMC which is a week long, that is
fine.
 
In a competition you wouldn&#x27;t have access to a computer so no, you are not
allowed to use a simulator which helps you along the way. I don&#x27;t have a
problem with people using FMC companion, because although it does make
things easier and you couldn&#x27;t do this in a competition, it doesn&#x27;t do
anything you couldn&#x27;t do yourself manually. Again you have to decide whether
its good practice for competition FMC, it might be better to get very fast
at doing the backtracking using a piece of paper, a pen, and a cube.

Doesn&#x27;t this also apply to the tool I just described? All of these
things could be done manually too:

- notating moves while you&#x27;re solving
- undoing moves (backtracking)
- keeping track of branches

The fmc rules are actually very simple: Your solution has to be created 
by YOU entirely!

So software is allowed for &quot;book-keeping&quot; only, not for anything 
creative, like making up parts of your solution. Book-keeping excludes 
(IMHO) finding out inverse/mirror and the like of otherwise knows 
algos/sequences ;-)

In principle one can manually do the 2-phase algorithm too. But time 
and other factors prohibits that naturally :-P You can use sofware as 
long as EVERY SINGLE TURN of your solution is SELF DEVISED, 
including &quot;happy-go-lucky shooting&quot; :-)

I always have a hard time in competitions because my normal fmc 
routine/methods take me far too long. I should really try to restrict 
myself to strictly no more than 1 hr, but it&#x27;s so tempting to find 
that gold nugget solution i know i can find when spending excessive 
time. Always practice the official format is the best way to go 
naturally, but with 1 week allocated time it&#x27;s too tempting for me to 
deviate from official format. Arguably Guus and Gilles are the 
best &quot;60-minute&quot; solvers at the moment ;-)

As long as your simulator doesn&#x27;t do anything for you automatically,
including automatically notating the solution for you, then you can use that
at your discretion. I do think it is rather using a sledgehammer to crack a
nut though, but thats a personal opinion and is no way based in fact.

Doesn&#x27;t this also apply to the tool I just described? All of these
things could be done manually too:

- notating moves while you&#x27;re solving
- undoing moves (backtracking)
- keeping track of branches

Sorry but I still don&#x27;t understand... YES, it automatically notates the
solution (I said that in my last email), so what you&#x27;re saying is
actually &quot;no&quot; my tool cannot be used? Still, FMC companion automatically
does something for you. What is the difference?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan :-)

If i understood your first post correctly your program will do 
nothing but book-keeping right? You do all the turns and branching. 
That&#x27;s fine with me actually :-) If your program comes up with turns 
YOU didn&#x27;t do yourself then it&#x27;s NOT ok.

ACube or CubeExplorer or Ron/Jaap&#x27;s solvers etc. do much more than 
book-keeping and all such software is not allowed. Likewise sofware 
which automaticllay does sequnce/cycle-insertions should also be 
banned.

I was planning such software earlier, but it was abandoned due to 
complexity and lack of time. Maybe at some later time i may go on 
with it :-)

Well, there are already some bits of code, but it would need a lot more
effort to display the branches nicely etc.

My thoughts were, (1) notating wastes half the time (which implies it
wastes part of our lives); (2) resetting the cube and re-applying the
scramble also takes up time; (3) counting the number of moves takes up
time.

--> Therefore: (4) FMC is too tedious and wastes part of our lives.

If a computer helped to automate the non-creative parts of the process,
we could reclaim a lot of time for our lives.

Anyway, I will not continue work on the program because these things
generally take a lot of effort, and in this case the program is not
allowed to be used here. Instead, I will think more about what I can do
for a linear FMC.

Ok, then don&#x27;t waste your time on fmc ;-) J/K :D

Yes i can see that dealing with branching nicely is a challenge as 
far as GUI is concerned. It would be nice to have something like you 
explain incorporated into the fmc-companion. I sometimes use the 
companion to find my starts. Although it&#x27;s not doing much of what you 
have suggested it saves me time setting up the scramble again, and i 
do note my moves as i go along. Occasionallly i mess up by using 
UDRLFB-only feature by mistake, losing all my commented parts :-(

I haven&#x27;t since 2004 :-)

I think the time limit on FMC should be much less. I would like 10
minutes, but why not 60 minutes? Anything more means that the playing
field is not even with some people able to spare more time than others.

(Yes, people will say 10 minutes is too short, because there is not
enough time to do notation! ;-)

Maybe you should restart your 5 minute FMC. I would definitely
participate, even though I&#x27;d prefer 2 minutes. ;-) But 5 or 10 is
fine. Cubers have different solving styles so it&#x27;s impossible to say
what time limit is the &quot;best&quot;.

The simulator you were talking about sounds perfect. It would make FMC
much more comfortable, scrambling and writing down the moves are the
main reasons why I&#x27;m not very interested in it. And it would also be
useful for analyzing direct (speed)solves afterwards. Chess players
replay their games later to find their own mistakes/weaknesses, often
with a computer. From my experience it helps in cubing as well.

If dan were to change the time limit to say 1 hr he would need 
modify the code and we had to do a solution while logged in to check 
the time spent. If getting the scramble on a monday and submitting 
on say the friday after how to know how much time was spent?? And 
yes was also discussed before :D

E.g. if you use intuitive F2L but memorised LL, then 2 minutes may be
enough.

What do you think about &quot;average of 3&quot; vs &quot;best of 3&quot;?

Luck might be a too big factor for &quot;best of 3&quot;, so I&#x27;d prefer average.

As posted before my best lucky linear solve was 24 turns (htm) set 
back in mid-late 80s. My best lucky linear supersolve (orienting 
centers) was 28 turns. I consider 28 to be a better achievement than 
24 for normal solve ;-) I used to do like 50-60 linear fewest moves 
solve pr day in my heyday :D Those days i had not much else to do. 
And i thought i was like the only one in the world still into 
cubing ;-)

By the way, this solve raises an interesting question about counting
moves. If I had done this solve 10 years ago, I might have counted it as
22 moves, and silently not counted the mistake/undo. But I think we need
to be more strict if we want to turn this into a proper event.

Above, I counted the RR&#x27; mistake as 2 moves (very expensive), but maybe
a more reasonable approach is to count such mistakes as 1 move. A
justification for this might be to view it as R4 (1 move) instead of RR&#x27;
(2 moves). Does it sound reasonable?

&quot;Best of 3&quot; does have the advantage of allowing you to stop after the
first solve and submit DNS for the rest if you don&#x27;t have that much time
to spend each week.

But I think I agree, I just got another 23 move linear solve yesterday.
Who knows, it could happen quite often when taking all of the
competitors into account. If so, then the winner would really be as good
as random. Still, such extremely lucky solves will significantly bring
down the average. Another option yet again is to use the &quot;median&quot;.

So far, I am happy with 5 minutes per solve, and need to decide on:

- Average of / Median of / Best of?
- 3 solves or 5 solves?

Good point. But doing all solves takes &lt;30 minutes at most, so time
shouldn&#x27;t be a big problem.

> But I think I agree, I just got another 23 move linear solve yesterday.

That&#x27;s crazy. I remember getting below 30 only twice, and they were
both speedsolves (so just very lucky).

Median is a very good idea, better than the other two IMO. And I&#x27;d
prefer 5 solves over 3. It would be possible to participate with only
3 solutions and two DNS&#x27;s, if somebody doesn&#x27;t have the
time/patience/interest to do all 5.

I think there was not much time for this.

The most fun part of German open is that the first day you
can buy many puzzles and watch puzzle and try.
I was to busy with that also :)

Modifying the fewest moves companion has been discussed before. I 
have made my modification available at this address:

http://cubix.idi.ntnu.no/fmccomp23_per/fmccomp.html

I made this modification with Internet Explorer in mind. It doesn&#x27;t 
look so nice in other browsers. The main differences are:

- 2 cube applets to play with
- more compact GUI
- i moved the buttons closer to the scramble &amp; solution areas
- colored background options in the color scheme selection area

As mentioned already not all of this works so nuicely in other 
browsers than Internet Explorer. My version does work in 
IE/Opera/Firefox browsers. For some reason Dan&#x27;s cubestation site 
only has version 2.1 for download. Not Charles Tsai&#x27;s latest 2.3 
version, on which my version is based :-)

I guess he actually means all algs of MAXIMUM 10 moves best solution. 
And about seeing mirrored or inverted versions. For fewest moves we 
have amble time, we don&#x27;t need to see it within a split second ;-)

It might also be useful to know all of those and try to use their

versions will not be single layer algs of course :D

          <div class="email-content">Hi Guys,

I mean all 10-moves algs that only affect the last layer. Some algs
solve the same position but they are worth memorizing because it
probably cancels out some moves. From Helmstetter&#x27;s list (I use for 2
years now to improve my speedcubing) I selected 88 algs.

I think there is 50% chance that I will get a shorter solve using this
memorized list. But I&#x27;m not there yet, but I will be during the
worldchampions in Budapest...

Good luck guys;)

          <div class="email-content">Per, I understand your answer in the forum.
But I am trying to find some way of making a &quot;fewest-moves&quot; event more
attractive.
Every time at the world championships, its importance is decreasing.
1 hour, 1 round!
Meanwhile, multi-bld has made its way into competitions, even if it&#x27;s
a long event with an awkward ranking system.
More than a matter of format, it&#x27;s a matter of will.
If the community considers fewest-moves styles as minor hobbies, fine.
But I think it&#x27;s a bit weird.

It may be argued that it is another debate, but for me the actual 
Rubik&#x27;s magic competitions are only dexterity shows : you can actually 
win such a competition and not know how to solve the puzzle starting

For me, FMC has always been the alternative to dexterity competitions.

That&#x27;s an excellent idea! I haven&#x27;t used my DGT 2000 for ages, but
looks like it isn&#x27;t completely useless. Now I just need to find an
opponent... Some other clocks (like Phileon, IIRC) even count the
number of moves (how many times each button is pressed) and it can be
displayed after the clock is stopped.

Come on, everything doesn&#x27;t need to be so black-and-white. You can
solve for fewest moves and use your brains without spending a week on
the solution... I agree that 5 minute linear FM solving isn&#x27;t the same
as Dan&#x27;s FMC, it&#x27;s another event. Just like rapid chess, it&#x27;s neither
bullet nor correspondence. It seems odd to me that you only see the
two extremes.

Just my it-coin2 (you don&#x27;t need to ask)

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Let us not mix up FMC and Fewest Moves. FMC is Dan&#x27;s beloved online 
weekly fewest moves challenge. Fewest moves in a real-life competion 
can never be FMC ;-) I sometimes abuse the term FMC myself so don&#x27;t 
take it too seriously :D I guess mixing fewest moves and FMC is a bit 
like mixing case and algo. What is meant is understood even if not 
phrased formally correct :-o

I would also like to see a more spectator friendly fewest moves 
format, but not one that would take very long or need excessive 
amount of judges. Also it should not replace the corrent format that 
honors the spirit of (iterative) solving. To me the whole idea of 
fewest move solving is to NOT do a typical linear solve, but to 
explore many options and tricks to come up with a short optimised 
solution. Even though linear fewest moves solving with a short time 
limit may attract more participants and more spectators it will be a 
sellout for me, unless it&#x27;s a supplement to the current 1 hr format. 
Ideally we should have 2 tries á 1 hr like for EC 2004. Whether to go 
for best of 2 or average of 2 is another discussion :D

For me speedsolving shows off ONE aspect of cubing and fewest an 
entirely other. IMHO fewest moves is underrated amongst most cubers 
and seen as something somewhat esoteric. To me solving like that 
allows to show off a deeper understanding of the cube. And even not 
spectator friendly is worth something in itself.

If speeeding can have many events like normal, OH and BLD why 
shouldn&#x27;t fewest moves be able to have more than 1 event? For 
practical reasons i do not see how we could have fewest moves events 
for larger cubes. Also writing down long sequences is prone to 
errors. Normally during a 1 hr fewest moves event i do at least 1 
silly mistake in notation that i waste a lot of time to track down! 
( For 100-120 turns or more this may become quite painful! )

That could be fun. You&#x27;d need to write down the made moves somehow,  
since a speedcuber can make several moves with one movement, as well  
as when no one is looking.

A lot of people would have a hard time doing their final algorithms  
one move at a time.


A whole other angle would be to have FMC solvers solve on a computer  
cube, that recorded their every move, and displayed their best  
solution so far on a screen. It would be audience friendly, and you  
wouldn&#x27;t have to write down your solution manually (source of all my  
DNFs).

For me, linear FMC is about solving and nonlinear FMC is about searching.

Of course, but my point is that searching is a HUUUUUUGE part of
nonlinear FMC.

Sorry to burst this bubble, but there is not really much mystery to
the FMC techniques, I don&#x27;t think.

Per&#x27;s advanced method is designed to &quot;create&quot; search alternatives. He
allows for two insertion points instead of just one, and this means
that he creates many more combinations and this maximises his chances
of finding the lucky short solution. For example, suppose your
skeleton is 22 moves and you have one insertion left. There are 23
possible insertion points, and therefore you have increased your
chances of finding a good solution by 23 times. However, suppose your
skeleton is 16 moves and you have two insertions left. There are now
17 chances for the first insertion, and 17+N chances for the second
(where N is the length of the first inserted sequence) giving you the
multiplication of 17*(17+N) times increased chances to find a lucky case.

In other words, Per has a method that is well-suited to searching, and
as we know, Per has been open about the fact that he is willing to put
in enormous amounts of time to search these possibilities.

Now, I have to admit that this must be a valid sport. Of course, my
personal opinion is WHY???!?! Why would anyone be interested in
searching for so long? But you might also ask the question, WHY would
anyone care about doing the magic when it&#x27;s the same sequence of hand
movements each time you perform it? Or, why are people interested in
speedsolving using a memorised system? I wonder that one myself. But
different people are interested in these things, and that makes them
valid.

My personal choice, however, is that I don&#x27;t like this &quot;try all
combinations&quot; aspect to FMC. That is exactly what you have to do when
you look for an insertion point. You can&#x27;t possibly know ahead of time
which is the best insertion point - you MUST test EVERY SINGLE POINT.
That is brute force, and in the end, what is this really testing?

I am more interested to see how well people can perform when they
aren&#x27;t allowed second chances. I think this is a much better test of
solving skill, and one&#x27;s understanding of the cube.

The fundamental skill in both styles is &quot;linear solving&quot;. Once you
have that, you can dilute it by adding nonlinear techniques ;-)

But to be serious, many of us have always done fewest moves the linear
way. How can that be considered a diluted version?

I don&#x27;t disagree with you.

My claim is that what nonlinear FMC adds over and above linear FMC is
the ability to search and test different paths, and then jump back in
time if it turned out to be the wrong way forward. Yes, it has linear
solving at its root, but one linear solve to test one path may take
only a few minutes, but a whole nonlinear FMC experience may take
several hours of searching, so &quot;searching&quot; is the word I used to
characterise nonlinear FMC because that is the reason why the process
takes so long.

Searching permeates every facet of nonlinear FMC. Not only at the
insertion stage, where brute force is used to search different
possible insertion points, but also during the construction of the
skeleton, since none of us here are capable of finding an expert-grade
skeleton on our first try, without a lot of L-U-C-K, and will
therefore just have a first try, and if it turns out bad, have a
second try, and so on.

For me, searching is an interesting application of computers, but it
is not something that I find interesting to do by hand. As a
programmer, if I ever have a hundred possibilities to test, I will
write a computer program to test them because Humans should never have
to suffer by performing such routine work. I am not saying it is an
invalid practice, but it is just not interesting to me :-)

When I was thinking about linear FM solving as an event, I thought of
the following approach to judging, which my apply here, too:

The idea is for each competitor to &quot;dictate&quot; each move they make to
the judge as they solve. So, as you solve, you say out aloud &quot;Right -
Up 2 - Right inverse - etc.&quot;. Then the judge replicates these moves on
their own cubes to verify that the competitor did actually perform
what he/she said and did not insert any extra moves while the judge
was not looking. The competitor can also watch as the judge replicates
each move to make sure that he/she has heard you correctly.

It could take some getting used to for each competitor to
automatically know that &quot;Red side&quot; translates to &quot;Right&quot;. The
alternative is for the competitor to dictate the colour names, but
this would mean that the judge would need the same colour scheme as
the competitor which may not be feasible.

Another issue for this newly proposed event is that competitors should
not be able to see each other&#x27;s cube, otherwise one cubist may copy
the other&#x27;s moves. Yes, you could require the second competitor not to
use the same moves, but there is really no need for either competitor
to see each other&#x27;s cube or even interact.

I like the idea of having 10 competitors up on stage side by side,
competing simultaneously. In a race, competitors also do not
&quot;interact&quot;, they are racing individually but just trying to be faster
than everyone else. For speed cubing, it would be exciting, and easy
to see who finished first (and last :-). For fewest moves solving, we
can still have a race format even though we are measuring number of
moves rather than time - all we need to do is synchronise the moves
with some time interval - say 10 seconds per move.

If we can rig the timer devices, it might be possible to run the race
as follows:

- Every 10 seconds, there is a &quot;beep&quot; indicating that you may now lift
your hands from the pads and apply one move to the cube, and then
return your hands back to the pad.
- If you do not return your hands back to the pad before 10 seconds is
up, you will hear a &quot;bzzzt&quot; and you will receive a DNF result, or if
your cube is solved, then you will receive a move count.

That sounds like a good feature :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan!!

Indeed you do make it sound like taking more time in fewest moves is 
only to allow for more excessive random searches. You are far from 
correct in this. Sorry!! Or at least it&#x27;s only half the story. The 
point in spending more time is that one should have many targets for 
the search. That requires knowledge about what is a good &quot;skeletal 
solution&quot;. And yes insertions is perhaps the key aspect of this. In 
addition to some other standard tricks like premoves/pseudoblocks. A 
thorough knowledge of commutators and conjugates is also important 
alongside more general short sequence construction knowledge. This 
may sound very vague. But it does involve things like utilising 
cyclical shifts and symmetries amongst other things.

I&#x27;m actually a  bit tired of hearing that when taking longer time to 
solve it just depends on luck. Of course it does depend on luck to 
some extent, but only partially. To be honest with you, a linear 
solve depends more on luck than a &quot;search solve&quot;. That&#x27;s a fact! Take 
this example: we have a linear solution competition with only 5 mins 
allocated. Let&#x27;s say the scramble is not that hard and that the first 
5/6 turns are rather obvious block making turns. 2 participants both 
see this good start. Now there would be a few good paths to choose 
from to carry on ... Choosing a path here with very limited time 
depends almost SOLELY on luck i&#x27;d say.

I just had to say something about the luck aspect of fewest moves 
solving. It&#x27;s often very misunderstood. 

When i started with fewest moves solving back in mid 80s i did solely 
linear solving because i never even wrote down the scramble. I had 
ONE attempt only. No way to set up the same scramble again. The only 
option to carry on from same scramble if i did mistake was to undo 
turns i had made. I quickly realised that i got some very good solves 
and some very bad ones this way. This is by and large due to the 
randomness of luck when sticking to ONE main path only. Taking 
averages of linear solving does make sense, but single ones not 
really. Too much luck ;-) If one takes more time and does iterative 
solving with all the tricks of the trade, one can combine a &quot;linear 
average&quot; into a &quot;singular iterative&quot; solve so to speak and avoid many 
of the luck aspects of single fast linear solves.

Of course it&#x27;s true that practising either linear or iterative 
solving you will gradually improve. The luck factor does decrease 
over time with practice. But IMHO linear solving involves much more 
luck than the current 1 hr official format. We can sacrifice that for 
making fewest moves more spectator friendly, i don&#x27;t have problems 
with that. But i dont want to see fast linear solves replacing the 
current format. They should supplement eachother.

My 1 euro ;-)

What... how can you suggest that I&#x27;m missing half of the story. I

I agree, that is why I recently suggested setting the format for
linear FMC to an average of N.

Conflict over.

Yes, I actually wasn&#x27;t conspiring to replace the current format, and
so it is funny to hear you bring that up ;-) RElax, I was only
expressing my own opinion, and if you read my previous messages you
will see it is quite clear that I&#x27;m expressing my own thoughts since I
used words like &quot;for me&quot; and &quot;my opinion&quot;.

Ok ok you didn&#x27;t say &quot;random searches&quot;. My main point anyway was that 
i think linear fast solving involves much more luck than slow 
iterative solving.

Instead of nitpicking here in the group we should write a proposal to 
the WCA that we would like some kind of alternative more spectator 
friendly format for fewest moves. Personally i think the whole speed 
business of cubing is too exaggerated. Solving fast does not show off 
deep understanding or creativity of the cube (and other puzzles). 
Competitions and gatherings should not solely focus on speed just to 
make it spectator and sponsor friendly ... **sigh**.

At least fewest moves is also measurable and understandable in that 
sense ;-)

Are you taking into account that linear FMC will use averages? If you
take that into account I no longer think it is &quot;much more&quot;.

Also, this does not take away from the fact that iterative solving
allows you to substitute luck for skill. And in /that/ sense,
iterative solving allows the solver to &quot;use&quot; luck much more than in
linear solving.

What if I removed the time limit of 5 minutes?

The focus of linear fewest moves is not to solve quickly, not at all.
The goal is simply to challenge you to solve without the safety net of
second chances.

I just find it hard to believe that the extra time would be useful
when restricted to one chance.

By the way, I already use premoves and the insertion technique in
linear solving. Technically, this involves &quot;forward tracking&quot; because
I must look into the future to see how things might be so that I know
what to expect when I get there. Backtracking means that you are going
to edit the past.

I think setting different time limits just allows for different
amounts of analysis, but this is an orthogonal issue and doesn&#x27;t
change the fact that we are still doing linear solving with different
time limits.

We agreed before that 5 minutes was plenty of time, and so it
certainly didn&#x27;t feel to us like this was &quot;diluted by speed&quot;. The
purpose of the time limit was just to create fairness. We don&#x27;t really
want a one week time limit because that means that some people who
have more free time available will have an advantage over people who
have less free time. 5 minutes was both enough, and not too much.

Or at least, that was the consensus back then. If you think it is time
to reassess that figure, by how much do you think we should increase
the time limit so that you won&#x27;t feel it is diluted by speed?

          <div class="email-content">-- Hi Gilles,

I like this idea very much. 
How about giving it the name FMK (Fewest Moves Knokout) of FMD (Fewest
Moves Duel)?

I also suggest a variation: don&#x27; t give the competitors the same
scramble but let you oponent scramble your cube while his (!) time is
running! 

Don&#x27;t let the &quot;boys&quot; discuss too much about searching-lineair solving
pureness stuff. I just like to try this in Budapest as an off-site
competition and let&#x27;s see if it gives fun. Who&#x27;ll bring a chess-clock?
(sorry, I don&#x27;t own one)

Hope to meet you all guys in Budapest: Charles, Ryan, Per, Johannes,
Cyril, Lars (!), Dan and of course you Gilles.

Happy cubing ;)

Gus

http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/36321

I decided to make the format just one cube each week, with a time
limit of 1 hour to solve. This time, the notated solution must also be
submitted.

Although the format is not an average, the point system will still
reward you well for coming second, and the real winner is the person
who has accumulated the most points after 12 weeks and so I still
think this works out in terms of fairness.

The advantage of this is that people who are short on time (like
myself) will still be able to participate. If I had to do an average
of 5 each week, I&#x27;d probably not have enough time to do it.

At the end of 12 weeks we&#x27;ll be able to look back on it and see if the
format is any good.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Eric!

I studied your solution to fmc #158.

Scramble was:
R F R&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; U2 R2 F D L F D&#x27; B&#x27; F&#x27; R2 B&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; D F&#x27; B&#x27; U2 F B L&#x27;

You start off nicely with:
L&#x27; U B {D2 U2} B&#x27; F2 R D&#x27; B&#x27; D2 B2 R2 B&#x27; R D&#x27; R F2 
to complete f2l.

I found a slightly better to finish the LL than your:
U&#x27; B&#x27; D B U B&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; D B2 U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 R&#x27;

I did like so: 
First do F D F&#x27; U F D&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; to orient corners while also solving one.
Then do the following block 3-cycle:
U&#x27; D&#x27; R2 U R U&#x27; R2 D R&#x27; U
2 moves cancel for a total of 34 (2 better than yours!)

The linear fewest moves challenge is already running in it&#x27;s third 
week. For those who don&#x27;t like to spend an excessive anount of time 
on a singular solve it&#x27;s a great alternative to Dan&#x27;s challenge. And 
also it seems that results are always prompt with no delay (I&#x27;m 
asleep at the end of each round:-P )

Ryan, I would say that you probably only use pseudoblocks which is 
*almost* the same as premoves. Premoves are used to remove the 
pseudoness and ease the lookahead for the rest of the solve. Making 
the actual premoves to the scramble would be disallowed for your 
linear challenge right? (On a real cube, not a simulator, it could 
only be achieved by physical turns.)</div>

On average i&#x27;d say one might cancel about 5 moves with 2 corner 3-cycle 
insertions. It does depend on the length of the &quot;skeleton&quot; that you are 
inserting them into. A skeleton of 23 sounds good. With more half turns 
in the skeleton it becomes harder to find good insertions. Likewise 
with limited time of course ;-) 30 minutes is more than i normally need 
anyway. I would normally sticker all those 5 corners and do the best 
insertion first amongst the 5 candidates: (1,2,3),(2,3,4),(3,4,5),
(1,4,5) and (1,2,5). There&#x27;s no guarantee that best-first insertion 
gives best overall ...

Same thing as I ment when I wrote &quot;any slice&quot;, more explicit: any slice 
or face as long as they stick together = no gaps in between.

I was rather thinking of doing a round or two, just to test. If it&#x27;s

I&#x27;m a little suprised you did not get a better result, there were so 
many 1x2 blocks and possible 1x2&#x27;s in this scramble. Also a little 
suprised you did not see the already compleated pseudo 1x2x2 that was 
in the D-layer. Try my first four turns and then see what you can do 
to the rest, it would not suprise me if you can get to sub 30 from 
there.

I fed the scramble into CubeX this morning and the first phase solver 
found a 17 turn solution in no time (optimal gave the same result).

Here it is: D R2 B2 U&#x27; R&#x27; D2 L2 F&#x27; L F2 U&#x27; F2 L&#x27; U2 D2 F2 U2

17 turns and 10 are quadric, that&#x27;s an easy scramble =)

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Yes that&#x27;s the thing about linear solving, you are caught by your 
early choices. Since the cost of undoing/changing a turn is high im 
not doing that. That&#x27;s also why i argued before that single linear 
solves are almost worthless. Too much luck. And that&#x27;s also why, i 
believe, that the linear fewest moves will be best of 10 rounds. That 
eliminates most of the luck.

Before the competition i also decided NOT to go for my usual solution 
styles i do with FMC simply because they are a lot slower, and the 
approaches may lead to dead ends. I&#x27;m using a more flexible but less 
optimal approach for this challenge.

I&#x27;m not really too keen on using pseudoblocks unless it&#x27;s some kind 
of last resort. For normal fewest moves pseudoblocks are easy to deal 
with using scramble premoves. No such thing allowed here. But if an 
amazing 2x2x3 pseudoblock comes up i MAY want to use it ;-)

Best wishes,

Dead ends, sometimes when I&#x27;m practising LFMC I get into situations 
where I got most of F2L blocked up but the blocks are stucked behind 
each other. What looks like 3-4 turns to fix ends up in some 8-12 and 
I have to break parts of what I already built. Runds like that 
sometimes ends in horrible 50+ turns, not fun :-S

Yes, although I wonder if we will reconsider this in 20 years... Luck
is only a byproduct of our limited knowledge. For example, someone
might have a strategy that finds very good solutions in 10% of cases.
When a situation falls within that 10%, we say he is lucky. In FMC,
you can use a strategy of just trying again (about 10 times) until you
get lucky.

In 20 years, our knowledge should have increased. Will we be able to
deal with all cases -- the good, the bad, the ugly -- with equal skill
(roughly speaking) and come up with a very good solution no matter
what the case? I hope so, and that (to me) is what it means to master
the cube. In 20 years, hopefully we will observe more, be aware of
more things, and make better decisions on each move.

The FMC results service seems to be ill, and I can&#x27;t work out why at
the moment. I haven&#x27;t changed anything, but the results are now coming
out scrambled. The results are stored on a database and accessed using
php and mysql. The only thing I can think of perhaps that might be
behind the issue is that the entries table recently went over 1000
records. Does anyone know if there can be a problem like this with
large tables?

I continue to investigate.

Some suggestions:

- Make an index to the &quot;htm column&quot; whatever it is called.

- Even you have an ORDER BY in the query, dump the result set into 
arrays and do your own sorting (PHP code) before displaying results 
(tedious)

- Copy over to a new table &quot;newer data&quot; not the full table, and see if 
the listing is ok then.

- Swap data storage engine to InnoDB from MyIsam

It&#x27;s worth checking out quite a few things ...

I don&#x27;t think 3 trials will be enough. Based on the results so far, it
seems just as likely for the same person to get 42,45,41 as 33,39,35.

Like Per said, we need a much longer set of trials. The way I get
around the length/time problem is by doing a running tally over 12
weeks, which I think is kind of fun. So, each week, there is a winner
for that particular challenge, but the ultimate winner is the person
who has accumulated the most points over 12 weeks. Right now, I&#x27;m on
Per&#x27;s tail and am trying to over take him :-) Interestingly, Per has
never won an individual challenge, but is still in the lead in the
points tally because he has performed consistently well each week.

Another idea. Doing 5 linear solves of same scramble within 2 hours. 
Repeating a solution is not allowed ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

I am a total beginner at Fewest Moves, but I really like it. So far I 
have only attempted it twice (US Open, Czech Open) and I have gotten 48 
and 47 moves using keyhole/fridrich F2L + OLL + PLL.

My reason for posting is that I would like to get better at this and 
that I would like to share the challenge from the Czech Open with all 
of you.

Scramble: F&#x27; R2 D U F2 R2 D2 L R D R2 F D2 U R2 F L2 R F&#x27; U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; F R 
D U2 F2 L&#x27; F&#x27; D2 U&#x27; R2 B2 R2 F U&#x27; F D2 U F L D2 U&#x27; L2 B&#x27; (45 moves)

I found a great beginning of building a 2x2x3 block in 8 moves:
x&#x27; y2 B&#x27; L B&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; L2 F2
And than I continued with finishing the cross and another pair in 4 
more moves:
x&#x27; y2 U2 F U F

That means that in 12 moves F2L is done except for 1 pair! (pretty good 
for a keyhole solver right )

After this beginning I couldn&#x27;t find anything interesting to finish, so 
I needed 47 moves in total to finish with a 3 look last layer which is 
just ridiculously bad 

Can anyone find a very good solution that uses this first 8/12 moves?</div>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Arnaud =)

First thing, you need to learn more algs to solve simple LL-cases 
like all three cycles for corners and all for edges. Corners are 
pretty easy to do as Ryan does it using commutators, take a look at 
his page to learn. For the edges there are not many cases, you can 
solve those in only three algs if you ignore mirrors and reverses.

U-PLL (3-cycle edges) you know how to solve I assume =)

Then: M&#x27; U M U2 M&#x27; U M + mirror (or reverse)

And: (x&#x27;) M&#x27; U&#x27; R U M U&#x27; R&#x27; U + mirror + reverse

If there are simple LL-cases like two corners and two edges need to 
change place and sometimes orient, the rest is done, those you often 
can solve using a PLL after some set up turns.

I will now try your first 12 moves and see what I can do to the end.

That&#x27;s why i always use same color scheme U=white, F=blue and never 
write x,y,z,M,E or S in my fewest moves solutions. Same with 
lowercase faces, i avoid them as much as i can. Only for 3-cycle do i 
use them rarely ;-)

Arnaud, in addition to Kenneths advice you should quite soon try to 
understand simple insertions, ie start with corner 3-cycles :-)
Sometimes OLL+PLL can be replaced with 2 insertions saving a bunch of 
turns :D

Hehe, that&#x27;s the same alg anyway, it is U or U&#x27; in both cases, stupid 
me! :P


> I will now try your first 12 moves and see what I can do to the end.

And that took the whole day =)

Na, I actually first tried your 8 + 4 turns but got no better result 
than you from there and then I had other things to do.

Now, later I tried again and gave it some little thinking at first:

It is when you solve that third pair you get into trouble, it leaves a 
bad pair and all LL-edges unoriented and that&#x27;s not good, at least not 
from my point of view.

So, I go from your first eight turns instead, my first choise, linear 
solving:

XXcross: (x&#x27; y2) U2 F2

Then I build the last pair before I down anything using: U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27;

Now I use &quot;FRFR&quot; do down both pairs and also orient LL-edges, one pair-
two edges at the time:

First: U&#x27; F R&#x27; F&#x27; R

Second: U&#x27; F&#x27; L F (L&#x27;) (I newer do that last L&#x27;)

This makes F2L + LL-edges oriented in 23 HTM and that&#x27;s pretty good.

Now, for LL I first do COLL:

L2 U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; L U (R&#x27;) (agin not doing the last turn = R&#x27;. The 
alg is Sune + Antisune saving some turns between algs, wery nice =)

This gives 33 HTM and a 1:12 chance to skip edges permutation, but it 
did not :(

Left is a U-PLL: R d R L&#x27; F2 R&#x27; L d L2

42 HTM, 40 STM

Then I found I can also solve the COLL using the mirror alg (I normaly 
do L because I&#x27;m left handed, using the mirror I can save that first L2 
I used in the first choise, stupid me again =)

This will also increase the chance to skip edge permutation to the 
double = 1:6 and that&#x27;s a good chance:

Mirror COLL (from turn 23): U L&#x27; U L U R&#x27; U&#x27; (R)

32 HTM, one turn better than before =)

But again it did not skip, it gave a Z-PLL intead.

So I save that last R and starts the alg from there: L&#x27; R2 D&#x27; R L&#x27; F2 
B2 R L&#x27; D2 L2 R2 D&#x27; L2 R2

47 HTM, 40 STM

Blah! or well, the STM is the same =)

Now, i I continue to search for a better result I would try to down one 
of the pairs usin &quot;FRFR&quot; and the second (or first) using &quot;RUR&quot; to see 
if if I get a better LL from there. More possibilitys I can get if I 
change &quot;RUR&quot; to &quot;RU2R&quot;. some of the ways may be really good, if I only 
can find it in time...

Hope that description of my way**  can give you some idéas for a 
approach for better results =)

** I always do linear and try diffrent ways when I do FMC. If I only 
get a single chance as in Ryans competition, then I use far more time 
to look ahead and sometimes traces the pices 5-6 turns. Then I do one 
turn and start to look for more posibillitys, tracing pieces again. It 
is more like chess than the normal twist and pray for a skip you can 
use if you can get back to some point and try again :P

I think that&#x27;s wrong (I&#x27;m not wery good at writing my turns), maybe F2 
= B2, try both =)

Well, I tried to down both the piars using &quot;FRFR&quot; but in the oppsite 
order from my first try. That gave the same LL, same COLL + mirror + 
both PLL&#x27;s but this time more turns because the case was in an diffrent 
angle so I had to end F2L compleatly before I could start the COLL.

ZB would do the job for me in this case ending in some pretty nice 32-
37 turns but I only know a some cases, mostly those where the corners 
are permuted already.

What! A 45 moves scramble?
1 hour is already not that long, moves 45 takes time and increases the
chances of making a mistake (and force the competitor to solve the
cube and rescramble it).

*** Am I the only who has a problem with long scrambles? ***

Article 4 of http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/ defines
the 3x3x3, and they&#x27;re 25 move long. There&#x27;s no exception in Article E.

Give me a *good* for requiring a special scrambling method in
fewest-moves events.

Me too. I often fail at 2 of the first 3 scrambles. With practice it  
gets better, but within the one hour format it definitely eats real  
time for me.

I actually only learned to read notation at any real speed when doing  
FMC a few years ago. If you learned cubing through notation, I&#x27;m sure  
that&#x27;s almost incomprehensible.

There was some research a few months ago showing that 25 move is far  
from a random scramble. We should change those rules. You could  
actually argue that all world records under these less-than-scrambled  
rules should be voided. But that&#x27;s an other list.

There&#x27;s also the fear that giving the competitors a 25 move solution  
will taint the competition. I suspect that fear mostly exist among  
people who don&#x27;t compete at FMC.

I agree. But keep in mind that the meaning of lower case latters when
scrambling big cubes was changed just to make the scrambling faster
and easier for the judges. The change also made the scrambles less
efficient, but it seems to be considered less important...

It&#x27;s possible to use wery long scrambles, like a 1,000 turns. The 
only thing you need to do is to run that long scramble in CubeX using 
the first phase solver. That will return a scramble of about 20 
turns, exactly the same as the long one.

Using the &quot;optimal&quot; function will shorten the scamble more but that 
takes mostly a long time, you will only gain a few turns from that if 
any, not worth waiting for.

Yes, I remember what was said about it, and the WCA scrambling
technique should be revised to make scrambles even more random. But
it&#x27;s not FM specific. Speed competitions may be biased the same way.
It&#x27;s a good reason, not a *good* reason. :-)

Exactly. What are the risks of giving the competitor a 25 move
scramble instead of 45? Do people think it&#x27;s easy to find some logic
or intuition in the 25 move sequence and get a good solution from it?
For now, I can&#x27;t see any risk, but I may be wrong.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Personally i prefer to stay with 25-turn scrambles due to the fact 
that setting up a longer scramble takes more time and is more prone 
to errors, like Lars said. Also i dont see the problem in having the 
occasional easy scramble. All have the same scramble anyway. Knowing 
the scramble will be &quot;hard&quot; may put off some from participating in 
the fewest moves i guess. My vote goes for no changes wrt scramble 
length. But if there is a majority wanting longer scrambles i still 
will them with repetiting parts, which makes them faster to set up, 
unless you are Stefan :-P

Also, for fewest moves events there should always be a diagram 
showing the scramble or a cube showing the correct scrambled state 
passed around for verification purposes. In Paris there was no way to 
verify we had actually set up the scramble correctly, which is bad.

          <div class="email-content">Hello Arnaud,

Your first 8 moves where on world record schedule! That 3th pair could
be inserted in many ways using some extra moves but better LL. So I
found a nice continuation after your 9th move:  F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; 
then U2 F U&#x27; F&#x27; finishes F2L with an 11-move last layer but this alg
starts with F U2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; U cancelling out 3 moves
at the beginning. This resulted in a 28 move solve which equals the
world record!
I needed about 20 minutes to find this solve but I am not sure I would
have found your 8 move start if I was in that competition.

a 45 move scramble is indeed very long, I agree with Gilles. I like
Kenneths&#x27;s idea about a long scramble (>50 moves), then generate a
short solve for it (eg with Kociemba&#x27;s Cube Explorer mostly in 19 or
20 moves) and use this solution as the competition scramble. 

For whom that think 25 moves is long enough: see the linear competion
#7 scramble which has already 4 pairs ready! 

See ya

Pick your choise, they are all basicly the same. But I still belive

          <div class="email-content">WOW!

I already thought I found a nice beginning, but now I feel even worse about my ending (me: 39 moves, you: 20 moves). Maybe we can add team-FMC to the list of events :)

I am pretty sure you could also have found this start, it only took me 5 minutes to create the first 2x2x2 block, 5 more minutes to create the 2x2x3 block and 5 more minutes to create the 2x2x3 block while creating/preserving the rest of the cross + 3rd F2L pair. The other 45 minutes were spent on doing the scramble over-and-over again (yes, I messed up a lot), writing/checking my solution and trying to find a way to make the 4th pair + Last Layer become &quot;lucky&quot;. I only enjoyed the first 15 minutes of that hour. The rest of the time I just felt like I was a total beginner trying to figure out how to &quot;solve&quot; the cube without succes. Getting this 8+4 move beginning was definately not just luck. Somehow I saw the scramble and decided to begin with the blue-yellow part (scramble was done competition style green-white) because I was sure that I could make it work out.

I think the most important reason for giving a 45 move scramble is to make it easier for the judges to determine if the solution is not related to the scramble. Obviously a 34 moves solution is not related to a 45 move scramble. However if they would give a 21 move scramble (cube explorer 2-phase) or an 18 move scramble (optimal) than a 34 moves solution might just be a smart variation of (R2U2)*3 + inverse scramble + (R2U2)*3. For an untrained judge this would seem unrelated.

Not influenced by me, Fewest Moves finally got the required 10 votes (http://www.speedsolving.com/showthread.php?t=842) and will now be included in the weekly competition at http://rubiks.has.it (or http://www.speedsolving.com). You can find this weeks competition at http://www.speedsolving.com/showthread.php?t=1202 and all new competitions will become available at http://www.speedsolving.com/forumdisplay.php?f=17. I have used a 45 move scramble and reduced it to a 18 move scramble using cube explorer.

And just maybe someone can mix this alg and a 4x4x4 PLL-parity fix to create a short AND fast parity fix?

Can&#x27;t you do a example where you show how it can be done? I&#x27;m intrested 
to learn and I&#x27;m surley not the only one.

Just make a &quot;pseudo&quot; scramble + solve = start from a solved cube and do 
backwards turns as it was a FMC solve including the insertions, that 
must be pretty easy to do.

Bah! you don&#x27;t need to, I gave it a little thought and grasped it kinda 
quickly, it&#x27;s easy if you got the pices in position =)

I also directly understood that olny four extra turns are needed, if 
your next turn to do is an R then you do L F2 L&#x27; R U2 and you get the 3-
cycle and the R-turn in only five twists.

          <div class="email-content">Hi again everyone,

I finally found the time to try and understand your solutions.

Ryan, am I correct in the following analysis?
&quot;First 12 moves, than [...] U2 L2 B L B&#x27; U L U2 R L&#x27; U&#x27; L U R&#x27; U2 B 
D&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27; B D B&#x27;&quot;
U2 L2 B L B&#x27; U L = setup top layer edges
U2 R L&#x27; U&#x27; L U R&#x27; U = finish F2L (on the right) and ELL
U B D&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27; B D B&#x27;= COLL

Kenneth, thanks for the detailed analysis, to bad it didn&#x27;t lead to 
anything good.

Guus, I can follow the 6 moves after my first 9 (F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R&#x27;) 
that finish the 3rd pair, while forming the 4th pair. But was 
inserting that last pair in 4 moves while also performing PLL just a 
lot of luck? And did you just happen to know the OLL for that case 
that didn&#x27;t change the permutation of any pieces or did you come up 
with that on-the-fly? After that first 9 + 6 moves, your solution is 
actually optimal U2 F U&#x27; F&#x27; F U2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; U (16) = 
U2 F U F&#x27; U&#x27; F2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; U (13).

I did some optimal analysis on this solve
Directly after the scramble: 18 moves was optimal
After my first 8 moves: 15 moves was optimal
After my first 12 moves: 15 moves was optimal
After Guus&#x27; first 9 moves: 16 was optimal
After Guus&#x27; first 15 moves: 13 was optimal (and he found it!)

Here is my analysis:

This also aligns a pair, and I join it with

          <div class="email-content">Hi Kenneth :-)

Actually you get that for only 4 additional turns ... R&#x27; and R both 
cancel. The 2 edges to be flipped has to be in 2 of the 3 slots used 
by that 3-cycle. 3 different faces may start the 3-cycle, so chances 
are quite high u will indeed get a  killer first insertion. 
Cancelling 3 is not totally uncommon i guess. There&#x27;s also lots of 
ways to do that 13-turn straight double flip. Mirrored and backwards 
give u 4 straight away. Then u can try cyclical shifts also ;-)

ACube found a bunch ;-)

No... If I didn&#x27;t have any time to think about it, I probably would
have instinctively started with:

F R&#x27; F R F2

Followed by two pairs with:

U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L U2 L&#x27; U2 L

I am currently researching the advanced &quot;one pair&quot; approach and
hopefully will be able to use it in speed cubing one day.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Arnaud,

The 28 moves solution was not lucky, at least I would not call so. Let
me explain. I tried 20 ways or so to insert the F2L 3rd pair and
choose the best one of it. And while choosing the best option I&#x27;m not
looking for a nice 2-step LL solve but actually I go for the 1-step LL
solve or as an alternative for one short LL-process leaving a 3-cycle
on corners or edges for inserting (using stickers) But this 3rd-pair
solve was the best because after the easy 4th pair was inserted I
recognized an 11 move LL alg as a conjugation of a 8 move LL alg: F&#x27;
U&#x27; F2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R&#x27;. 

Was it coincidence I &quot;recognized&quot; the 8 move LL alg? I would say no,
currently I&#x27;m memorizing all 6,7,8,9 and 10 move LL algs, which means
what it does to all LL corners &amp; edges. I hope to finish this before
the worldchampionships in Budapest. But this peticular 8-move alg was
already in my memory sinces the 80s.


See ya ;)

I&#x27;m soon going to the Finnish Open 2007 contest and there I&#x27;m going 
to do my first ever FMC competition (Hi Johannes, see you there =)

Any tips? what&#x27;s important to think about?

Can I use more than one cube doing this or is it only one?

What to use for stickers? Also, I&#x27;m not compleatly clear about the 
rules about stickers.

Per:

Are you comming? It&#x27;s not far from Trondheim. Take a flight to 
Helsinki and join us in the FMC that will take place Saturday evning. 
You can probably find a flight back to Norway the same evning if you 
like that. Or better come Suturday morning and stay the whole weekend 
and do big cubes and of corse some Snake** too.

what I did in the 80&#x27;s but it was something similair (sub 5).

Hi Kenneth,

Practising at home under the same rules (most importantly one hour
time limit) is probably a good idea. But I&#x27;ve never done it in
competition so I don&#x27;t have any other tips.

> Can I use more than one cube doing this or is it only one?

You can use 3 cubes.

> rules about stickers.

The rules say you may use &quot;unlimited coloured stickers&quot;. I&#x27;ll take
some (bad) spare stickers with me, you can use them if you want.

I&#x27;ve always used 3 special corner pieces with different shaped
stickers for finding insertions. I guess these will be allowed if I
put them to one of the cubes.

And I broke my Snake... Samuel has one but it&#x27;s too stiff, I can get
barely sub-4. I hope that will be enough for a win.

See you there =)

You can use mine, it&#x27;s loose. Problem is that it has to be sqeesed a 
little in the end to fix the shape, otherwise it falls apart. But I 
remember from the last competition this winter you alredy did that to 
yours =)

He he, we are totaly O.T, talking Snake in a FMC forum ;P ;P ;P

          <div class="email-content">Very important tip: You have exactly 1 hour, so make sure you have your solution written down clearly and checked/double-checked/tripple-checked it!

Other info and tips:
1) You can use 3 cubes (bring them yourself)
2) You can use stickers (bring them yourself). There are not really any rules about how you use them.
3) Make a global estimation for a time-schedule and try to stick with it.
4) If you have a good beginning, but can&#x27;t find a good continuation you should probably try to find another beginning.

I am still really new to Fewest Moves and have only done it 5 times now. My best so far is 31 moves (http://speedsolving.com/showthread.php?t=1263)

Have fun and good luck,
Arnaud

Thank&#x27;s Arnaud.

31 is good, if I can do that in competition I will take the Swedish NR 
from Lars Petrus (32 moves). But that will be wery hard I understand,

It&#x27;s 25 according to the regulations.

The best way to scramble would be to generate a random position and
then find a move sequence to get into that position. This has been
suggested before. But for some reason WCA seems to like the number 25,
even though it&#x27;s not enough to give a fair scramble.

          <div class="email-content">Johannes is correct.  

 According to the official rules:  

 http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#fewestmovessolving
[1]
 E1) Regulations are as described in Article A (Speed Solving).   

 http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#speedsolving [2]
 A2b) A scrambler scrambles the puzzle according to the regulations
in Article 4  

 http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#scrambling [3]
 4f) The number of moves to scramble a puzzle must be: 3x3x3 Cube 25
moves   

 However, at the US Open 2007 we got a 45 moves scramble  (with
repeating parts like (R D&#x27; R&#x27; D)*3 in it) and at the Czech Open 2007
we just got a regular 45 moves scramble.  

 Johannes is also right about the best way to generate a good
scramble: Create a scramble with many moves (45 was found to be
sufficient, but there isn&#x27;t really a reason not to use hundreds) and
optimize that to produce the same scramble in as few moves as
possible.
 I use that way of generating scrambles in the weekly
competition at
speedsolving.com (http://www.speedsolving.com/showthread.php?t=1373
[4])  

 R2 F D U&#x27; R U2 L R2 D&#x27; U R2 D2 B&#x27; F&#x27; D R&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; B F&#x27; U2 L R2 D&#x27; B&#x27;
F D&#x27; L R2 B&#x27; U F&#x27; U2 B L R U F&#x27; L R&#x27; U B&#x27; F2 U (45 moves original)
 D L F2 U&#x27; L2 F2 L F&#x27; U&#x27; R2 U2 L D2 U&#x27; F L D U2 (18 moves optimal
solution, easier to apply multiple times)

I find it unbelievable how loosely the regulations are being followed.

Actually, I said &quot;random position&quot;. I.e., generate (pseudo)random
EP, CP, EO and CO (in whatever format the solver uses). It&#x27;s not just
easier and faster, it also avoids the issue &quot;how many moves is enough&quot;
(I&#x27;m pretty sure an infinite number of moves would be required to make
every position equally probable).

          <div class="email-content">[disclaimer]The following is a summary that is meant to be easily
understanable. It is not meant to be scientifically
fullproof[/disclaimer]  

 If you scramble a cube, it can be restored in 18 moves on average,
somestimes less and probably always in 20 moves maximum (26/27 has
been proven)  

 The cube has about 43 * 10^19 possible positions and if you were to
use a 15 move scramble not all of them can be reached. Even if you
were to use 30 moves it has been argued that not all possible
positions have an equal chance to be reached. After about 45 moves
the chances of reaching any possible position was found to be &quot;not
significantly different&quot;.  

 All of this doesn&#x27;t mean that  

 1) you need to perform 45 moves to scramble it to be &quot;not
significantly different&quot;. Optimizing a 45 moves scramble to it&#x27;s 18
moves optimal scramble is considered human-friendly
 2) a 19 moves optimal scramble is hard and a 17 moves optimal
scramble is easy (neither for speed or fewest moves)
 3) using
20 random moves will always give you an easy scramble
 4) using a 50, 100 or 1000 moves scramble would be better or worse  

 My recommendation would be to generate 1000 moves scrambles and to
have them sub-optimally solved to 20 moves for competitions. That
process is very fast and could be included in the official 3x3x3
scrambler by using Cube Explorers Web Interface.  

 My second recommendation would be to &quot;not care&quot; about the
theoretical quality of the scrambles anymore but focus on the
practical side:
 1) Scramblers don&#x27;t scramble perfectly, especially on megaminx and
bigger cubes
 2) Even very long scrambles can result in very easy cases on a 2x2x2
quite often. It is almost impossible to determine what an easy case is
because people use different methods
 3) Someones cube can get scrambled by a befriended scrambler and/or
judged by a befriended judge, leaving the option for fraud  

 I don&#x27;t have any solutions for the above practical problems besides
&quot;that&#x27;s the way the cookie

          <div class="email-content">There are 2 different points:
- Scrambles quality. Is the cube scientifically scrambled/enough
random/... ? How many random moves are necessary and can we find a
better scrambling technique, like solving a random configuration? This
matters for all cube events.
- For fewest moves, organizers seem to prefer long scrambles, longer
than the solutions found by the best competitors. Because they could
supposedly cheat, and this way they want to make sure winning
solutions are not inspired by the scrambling sequence. That&#x27;s what I
thought we were talking about in this group.

          <div class="email-content">Hi.

I have some questions. Per in one post mentioned few &quot;advanced&quot; 
techniques in fewest moves solving. 

1. &quot;Put all into one layer and solve it&quot;. I really don&#x27;t understand 
what that mean? I supose that is some kind o conjugating but I&#x27;m not 
sure.

2. Scramble premoves. I now what it is, but I can&#x27;t figure what 
premove should I use. Is there any method? Or it&#x27;s just guessing?

Next. In few posts I read about cyclical shifts. I know only that, 
what tells me the term. I played with some algorithms but didn&#x27;t see 
any pattern. Is there any method to figure that this concrete 
cyclical shift on this concrete algorithm will make concrete effect?

Thanks in advice.
Adrian.

PS. I know, my English is horrible.</div>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

As an example of &quot;solving all in same layer&quot; i will show how to do a 
simple pattern, the 4 T

- put 4 c/e blocks into U with L B R L&#x27; F L
- make 4-cycle on them with simply U
- undo first step

>>>> L B R L&#x27; F L U L&#x27; F&#x27; L R&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27;
it is ALWAYS possible to solve the state(s) with corner 4-cycle and 
edge 4-cycle by a rather long U or U&#x27; conjugation. In fact both ways 
are always possible. If left with sucah a state after som intitial 
turns always look for inserting that conjugate at some previous 
point, it may be more efficient than just doing it at the end :D So 
it&#x27;s a bit like inserting 3-cycle, but less chance of cancelled turns.

Scramble premoves is closely related to pseudoblocks. To explain the 
theory is a bit long winded. I will explain how to use ONE premove. 
Making more is just the nesting of doing 1 at a time of course.</div>

          <div class="email-content">D B)*x, that is do F then 
D B x number of times. We now have a pseudo 2x2x=
3 block at UF 
position. If we had only done D B x number of times we would=
 have had 
a perfect 2x2x3 block at UF position. What actually happens here=
 is a 
bit like: &quot;i have almost a perfect 2x2x3 block here, i can make it 
=
perfect if before the scramble that layer making the block pseudo had 
been=
 in a different position first&quot;. This is exactly what we do. We 
force the =
&quot;imperfect layer&quot; to become perfect by changing it before 
the scramble. No=
w we basically solve a different scramble. 
Fortunately the adjusted scramb=
le and original scramble are closely 
related. And the solution to the adju=
sted scramble is transformed to 
a solution of the original scramble with a=
 few turns done at the end.
For examples see the FMC archives.

Cyclical sh=
ift is nothing but a particular form of conjugation which 
you seem to know=
 about already.

If you have a sequence M1 M2 M3 ... ... Mk conjugate it wi=
th the 
inverse of the first move like so:
(M1)&#x27; M1 M2 M3 ... ... Mk M1, th=
en (M1)&#x27; M1 obviously cancels. This 
is a cyclical shift 1 step countercloc=
kwise. Further steps are easily 
achieved by now comjugating with (M2)&#x27; and=
 so on.

Cyclical shift the other way is also possible:(different conjugati=
on)

Mk M1 M2 M3 ... ... Mk (Mk)&#x27; where Mk (Mk)&#x27; cancels.

And so on ...

I guess &quot;I could not care less&quot; is holding the same meaning, and is 
used in all english-speaking countries natively. Yes ?? I guess the 
other phrases mentioned are slang versions ...

My wife can bear with my cubing. I guess i am just lucky ;-)

Where did i imply that? I never said english-english. English means 
american-english, english-english, australian-english, singaporean-
english or any amongst other &quot;prefix nationality&quot;-english versions :D

Yes, my wife is sorta within IT. At least it&#x27;s part of her BSc-

          <div class="email-content">Hi.

Big thanks for anwser! It helps me a lot. But this not the end ;) 
Some more questions, this time about methods usefull in FM ( I 
think ).

Heise method. 
Sometimes I can&#x27;t manage with parity in Stage 3. What I mean? I take 
the first pair and permute edges to get four corners left. But in 
some cases I have to switch only two edges in last layer ( or one 
from the middle and one from ll ). I don&#x27;t have any effective way for 
solve that.


Petrus method.
I dig in internet for 2-gen approach. I found some archives of 
Charles Tsai homepage but not complete and without pictures. I don&#x27;t 
know how to permute corners and flip edges simultaneously. Have 
somebody complete table of algs? Or full backup of Charles site?


And how to recognize more efficient which corners should be changed? 
Now I just bring two first layer corners in place, look at last layer 
and choose the corners to permute. I read something about tetrads ( 
by the Thistlethwaite algorithm. ) - it will be usefull for this?

Cheers.
Adrian.</div>

There are a few basic/simple strategies:

{ R2, U } moves, e.g. R2 U2 R2 U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R2 (very efficient),
{ R, U } moves, e.g. R U2 R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; (not so efficient).
{ R, U, L } moves, e.g. R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; U2 L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L (not so efficient).

And an advanced strategy:

I still haven&#x27;t written about this on my page. I am calling it the
&quot;Down-Under&quot; maneuver:

    B2 D&#x27; R D B2

The free slot is at F-R, the FR edge is at UB, and this maneuver moves
UB into FR by going down (B2) and under (D&#x27; R). The BL slot is also
affected, and so you need to prepare that slot before applying the
maneuver.

Among the things that it is useful for is your trouble case above:

    L U L&#x27; U down-under

Other unrelated examples of its use:

    L down-under L&#x27;
    L U2 L&#x27; down-under

  Hi everyone,

  The FMC is now fixed and the results for all previous challenges are
  available and are displaying properly. Challenge 167 will begin at
  midnight (or a few hours before) on Monday (UK time) :)

  Cheers,
  Dan :)

I&#x27;ll try to make sure you don&#x27;t need to be so humble this time ;-)
This first round has shorter deadline, but it&#x27;s ok. it&#x27;s only 1 hr 
anyway :D And you didnt need to fix any code to move the deadline ;-)

Have fun!!

improved my personal best from 47 to 37 and then to 33.

On both scrambles I found a 7 move 2x2x3 block. On the first attempt 
I got a 13 move full F2L (I used a different approach to do my 37 
move solve because I don&#x27;t know OLL/PLL). On the second solve I 
almost got really lucky, it could have been a 20 moves solution if it 
weren&#x27;t for 2 misoriented corners.

On both attempts Zbigniew Zborowski got first place with 33 and 31 
moves!

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I had a quick look at first scramble:
D2 U&#x27; R D&#x27; U2 L&#x27; D&#x27; R2 B F2 R2 B&#x27; F L&#x27; D&#x27; B2 F2 D&#x27; U B2 F&#x27; D2 B2 D2 L2

After your first 9 moves: U2 R B R D2 L F2 U2 F i found a nice 
continuation like so: B R B R&#x27; then solve remaining edges and a 
corner with R D B D&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27;, 2 moves cancel out. Now solve remaining 
corners with 2 easy 3-cycles like so: R&#x27; F&#x27; L F R F&#x27; L&#x27; and B R&#x27; U&#x27; R 
D&#x27; R&#x27; U R D. 32 turns total but surely it&#x27;s better to insert the last 
2 3-cycles :-) Completing f2l is not always the best way to go about 
it :D

Best wishes

For the second scramble i insert (D2 R B&#x27; U2 B R&#x27;)*2 into the dot for

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for all this info Per, I will study it this weekend. I seem
to be pretty good at finding good beginnings, but I lack the
experience (only 10 FMC&#x27;s sofar, 31 is my best) and knowledge (4 look
last layer) to make for a very good finish. For me a 2 look last layer
(6/7 + 9/10) is a good ending.  

  Oh, and the fact that I find a 13 move F2L doesn&#x27;t mean that I used
it. I throw some edge-control or other moves in there to get a better
last layer at the expense of a worse F2L. I will practise
&quot;edge-insertions&quot; this weekend and I have been a little succesfull
with mispaired F2L-pairs (I don&#x27;t know if that is a common technique,
I mean inserting 2 corner with 2 edges that don&#x27;t match, by using an
R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 variation you can fix the F2L and manipulate the last
layer in a very easy way)  

  Finally I just heard that I got your spot for FMC, does that mean
you are not coming at all to Worlds?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Arnaud,

Nice to hear we will compete in Budapest, since you are now the new
Dutch record holder.....

As a FMC training I studied the Polish Open scrambles and your
solutions. I agree with Per your starting moves are very good.
For the 1st round I found a somewhat better continuation after your
splendid 13move LL (U2 R B R D2 L F2 U2 F R B2 R&#x27; F&#x27;)
1) cycle 3 edges to prepare for a 10 move LL: L2 B (U&#x27; D) L2 (D&#x27; U) B
L2 (9)
2) then my speedcubing alg for corners: L U&#x27; B U&#x27; B2 R&#x27; B L&#x27; B&#x27; R B2
(10+1)
which give a total of 32 moves

For the final (2nd scramble) after your 13th move (so after R&#x27; U . F&#x27;
D2 U2 L2 U&#x27; L B&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27; B D2) I found a good continuation: B&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27;
B R D R&#x27; D which left a corner-3-cycle. When inserting R B2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R B2
R&#x27; F after your second move (at the dot), cancelling out 2 moves which
left 28 moves! I needed 30 minutes to find this continuation.


My independant 1 hour solves were:
1st round: R&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27; L U2 B&#x27; D2 L&#x27; R&#x27; F2 R L2 U&#x27; B&#x27; U2 B&#x27; R B R&#x27; B L U
L&#x27; B L&#x27; B&#x27; L U&#x27; (28)
pseudo F2L (19) finishing with a 10 move LL-alg and cancelling out 1
more move  .

final: D&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R D R&#x27; U2 R . R&#x27; U F&#x27; U2 D2 L2 U&#x27; B2 R D&#x27; R&#x27; B D B2 D
B&#x27; L B L&#x27; B2 D&#x27; B&#x27; D B&#x27; (29) 
(corner-3-cycle at the beginning,cancelling 3 moves)

So your start was much better than mine....

See ya ;)

Gus

I found a 37 move solution, but wrote it down wrong, despite spending
10 minutes on writing it :(. I doubt it matters, as several people
should have beaten that number.

It&#x27;s a pseudo 2x2x3 block, so you should do L2 before mixing to see
what&#x27;s what.

B&#x27; L&#x27; B2 F L2 B R&#x27; B&#x27; D2 R2 D

(Pseudo)block with edges oriented in 11 moves is good. This is a
fairly natural continuation:

R&#x27; B R B2 R2 B R2 B&#x27; R2 B&#x27;

(Pseudo) 2 layers in 21 moves. This is what I call Dx2
(http://lar5.com/cube/270/zDx.html) and can be solved with Sune +
Niklas in 13 moves, resulting in a total of 35.

I didn&#x27;t have that memorized (I do now :), so the best I found (20
minutes in) was a Sune + what I call BH54 (It&#x27;s number 54 in
Helmstetters list for step 5+6+7):

B&#x27; R&#x27; B R&#x27; B&#x27; R2 B + B R2 B L* F&#x27; U2 F L&#x27; B2 R&#x27; + D2

Where &quot;L*&quot; is what I wrote down wrong as &quot;D&quot;, because of how I think
about that alg. This is the third competition in a row where I fail to
submit a solution because I can&#x27;t get the notation right. Very
frustrating, and entirely my fault, of course. I&#x27;ve never been good at
(or liked) notation, and really only learned to use it semi fluently
for FMC a few years back.</div>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Lars :-)

After your pseudoblock start you can carry on like so:
R B2 R2 B2 R
This leaves 6 corners to leave as 2 3-cycles
L&#x27; F2 L B2 L&#x27; F2 L B&#x27; then D2 L U&#x27; L&#x27; D2 L U L&#x27; and complete solution 
with D2 for 33 total, so easy. With insertions it&#x27;s surely quite a 
few moves better :-)

look at my notes at home and after 5 minutes I found a good continuation 
that seems incredible clear and easy right now. I found both the &quot;Best

for a 34 move solution which would have made me the world champion. It looks

After expanding with D R&#x27; D2 R continuing with D&#x27; L&#x27;... would be the 
natural choice due to the free corner on first layer. The D&#x27; L D&#x27; L&#x27; 
D&#x27; L D2 L&#x27; that works well is not really a natural continuation but 
worked well in this case :D

          <div class="email-content">Hi Lars &amp; others,

It was nice to meet and compete you Lars!
The FMC competition definitely had a hard scramble, after a few moves
that seemed right all remaining blocks or pairs were hard to solve.
But with a sub-optimal 2x2x3 block I found a nice 33 move solution
after 40 minutes or so. I was so stupid to write it down und check
only 3 minutes before the end of the hour because I wanted to do a
nice insertion on a 3-corner-cycle wich I couldn&#x27;t find quickly
enough. I made errors writing my first it down and had no time to
check &amp; correct. I have to wait another 2 years for my next chance....

My solution after 40 minutes was:
premove: D2
2x2x3 block: B&#x27; L&#x27; F B2 L&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27;
pseudo F2L minus pair: R D B&#x27; D
pseudo F2L: R B2 D&#x27; R&#x27; D R B&#x27;
LL edges: U F R F&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27;
LL corners &amp; correction: F&#x27; U F D&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F D . D2
Total: 33 moves.

See ya guys ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Mirek :-)

Thanks. Yes i knew there was probably a better insertion scenario to 
be found. But the one you found should have been obvious as the 2 
insertions are independent. Odd miss out from me ;-)

I also had a look at the WC scramble. I started with R B&#x27; L&#x27; B2 F&#x27; R 
F2 L2, making good blocks and creating 2 useful c/e pairs. But then 
i didnt find a really good continuation. Ended up with a 34 solution 
using an easy insertion ... Not all that good really. Going past 1 
hr i would have found something better :-)

Best wishes,

Per

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends of FMC,
   although I didn&#x27;t attend Budapest WC (unfortunately), I dedicated
one hour today and pretended I&#x27;m there. Well, there was no presure
from other contestants and not the exciting athmosphere some of you
enjoyed in Budapest. Here is how I proceded. 
To remind you, the scramble was L D2 R D&#x27; L&#x27; B F&#x27; L R B&#x27; F L2 R2 B L2
R B2 U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; B D2 B L R. The very first start I found immediately
looked pretty good:
B&#x27; L&#x27; F B2 L2 R&#x27; D&#x27; [D2] The brackets indicate a pre-move. So since, I
scrambled with putting D2 before scrambling L D2 R D&#x27;....
This is my kind of standard approach solving a 2x2x3 block first. The
next didn&#x27;t look that good, so I improved it with D&#x27; R2 D. I bet on
this start B&#x27; L&#x27; F B2 L2 R&#x27; D2 R2 D [D2] and solved edges next. After
R B&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; U B&#x27; R2 B&#x27; R B, 5 corners remain. Insertions of 2 3-cycles
of corner cubies were difficult and I ended up with a 35-move solution
after total 30 min 10 sec. The next attempt was [D2] B&#x27; L&#x27; F B2 L2 R&#x27;
D2 R2 D _ R B&#x27; R&#x27; B R2 B2 R&#x27; B2 R&#x27; D&#x27; R2 .D R&#x27; and having 4 corners to
solve. This time the insertions were quick and efficient. At the dot,
insert R2 D&#x27; L&#x27; D R2 D&#x27; L :D and at the colon, insert L&#x27; D&#x27; R D L  D&#x27;
R&#x27; D. 
Putting it together, the solution has 31 moves: B&#x27; L&#x27; F B2 L2 R&#x27; D2 R2
D R B&#x27; R&#x27; B R2 B2 R&#x27; B2 R&#x27; D2 L&#x27; D R2 D2 R D L D&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; D2. I
needed 39 minutes even, including double checking. I couldn&#x27;t find
anything better within 1 hour.

I have had 17 turns with 2 twisted corners, and many other 17-
solutions with twisted corners and flipped edges. Of course not all 
of these had a solved f2l. Yes it&#x27;s a bit annoying to be so close, 
yet so far from a good solution :D

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

I have just recently gotten very interested in FMC and am interested
to try it in competitions.  I was wondering if someone could describe
the competition FMC experience?

What I am interested in are how many pieces of paper are you allowed
to have based on the rules?  Also how much do nerves come into play?

I haven&#x27;t yet tried doing my FMC attempts in 1 hour yet, so I will
start that soon to get used to the time pressure as well.  But I was
curious to hear of how it feels to do FMC actually in competition and
if anyone has any hints for a beginner FMC&#x27;er.

Also I do use insertions so I can see how stickers would be useful,
but I usually just remember the pieces that I need to follow and check
insertions for and look after each turn of my partial solution.  Would
it be better to invest in some actual FMC stickers for this?

Thanks,
Chris</div>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris :-)

The fewest moves rules in a nutshell:

- Find and write down the shortest solution you find to a given 
scramble within 60 minutes.

- Solution length is based on face turn metric (also called half 
turn metric - R and R2 both have length 1 in this metric)

- You are allowed to bring 3 cubes. How to make use of more than one 
cube is up to the indivisual, i find it useful - i always keep one 
cube with the scramble set up so i can quickly check i set up the 
scramble correctly successive times :-)

- You are also allowed to bring unlimited extra stickers (for 
insertions most of all - one may bring paper stickers to write on 
also, to keep track of cycles ...)

- IMHO the rules should state that the organisers must bring a cube 
with the correct scramble set up (or at least a color diagram on 
paper) for verification purposes.

Experiences.

Given 60 minutes only about half the time only is spent actively 
looking for a solution. The rest is spent to set up the cube over 
and over again, and to verify the solution is correct. The 
verification can be a very nerve racking experience :-s Being a 
faster solver than me gives more time to search for solution ;-)

Tips.

Do not make many turns without writing down what you are doing. It 
is surprisingly easy to forget what you just did :-P

Work with fixed color orientation - i always have U=white, F=blue

Avoid using cube rotations (xyz) in notation, this is very confusing 
as you &quot;lose&quot; information which face is which color. I always rotate 
the cube in my hands while examining :D

I also avoid inner slice turns entirely, with rare exceptions for 
using them in simple commutators. Inner slice turns mess with the 
face-color matching ;-) Same goes for lower case (double outer 
layer) turns, for exactly same reason as inner slice turns.

Do not spend excessive time on finding a good start, though a good 
start is always beneficial.

Know all OLL/PLL algs if you always do a complete f2l!! It is 
beneficial to know many algs for each case actually to try to find 
cancellations.

Skeleton solution + insertion(s) is in most cases superior to a 
linear solve (be it a speed method variation or more intuitive).

And finally, do not understimate the time needed for final 
verification. It is better to submit a working &quot;45 turn&quot; solution 
than a &quot;would be killer&quot; solution with mistakes in it. 

Strictly UDFBRL notation also makes it easier for the judges to 
validate :-)

Good luck!!

If you want an example about what nerves could do during competition
read the following topic at speedsolving.com:

You&#x27;re doing already pretty well at FMC competition in this forum!

This was a great solve doing all this within the hour. It also
confirms this was a hard scramble. We should compete sometimes,
somewhere......
I&#x27;m chasing your worldrecord so I hope you&#x27;ll do the same.

I am sorry for the pretty poor hosting of the FMC recently, but I have

Thanks for your continued support, and I hope to see you all sometime

  thanks for your note!
  Looking at  FMC #178, it seems like you were quite lucky. Your good
start turned up to be good at the end. Nice, anyway!
I found a 15-move F2L but did not know what to do with it. This one,
F&#x27; U B&#x27; F&#x27; R U2 R2 _ L&#x27; B D2_ B&#x27; L2 B2 L&#x27; B. 

If you want to compete, we can do it on #179 that I haven&#x27;t look at
yet. Let&#x27;s do sequential FMC first, that is no moves taking back, 5
minutes limit. Then continue with 1 hour FMC, means you already have
up to 5 minutes less than 1 hour.
In case you already started working on #179, we can do it next week.
Maybe, Gilles will join us?

After your 15-move f2l i would do like so:
L&#x27; F&#x27;D&#x27; L&#x27; D L F

Then i&#x27;d look for an edge 3-cycle insertion.
Probably not terribly good but anyway it&#x27;s sub 30 :D

          <div class="email-content">Hi Mirek,

I like to compete this way. I could start this week already because I
haven&#x27;t had a look at the FMC #179 scramble yet. But we better post
our solutions at this forum because sometimes Dan&#x27;s site &quot;refuses&quot; to
give results for a couple of weeks.

I think Gilles reads this forum also, so if he likes he can join us.
Does anybody know if Zbigniew is reading this forum? 

Well, let&#x27;s wait for our posts.....

This is good. And don&#x27;t worry, nobody is realy good at 5 minutes FMC
but anybody can get little bit lucky. It&#x27;s just fun.

  5 minutes is pretty short when you expect writing the moves down. I
 was affraid of that and sticked to less risky strategy than usually.

U&#x27; F U B U&#x27; F&#x27; finished 2 three-cycles of corners. 40 moves total :-)
which is about my average.
Hey, Per, much better in QTM than yours! :-) It would be the metric of
my choice.

Hi Guys,

I had some luck at the 5min solve, resulting in a 34-mover:
F2L: F&#x27; U&#x27; D F2 U2 D2 B R&#x27; B&#x27; F R2 F D&#x27; R2 D&#x27; F B&#x27; D2 B R F&#x27; R&#x27; F2 D
F&#x27; (25)
LL: R D R2 B R B2 D B D2 (9)

Then I continued for the hour challenge, I focused too long on the
start of the solution above, resulting in a poorly 33 moves:
F2L: F&#x27; U&#x27; D F2 U2 D2 B R&#x27; B&#x27; F R2 F D&#x27; R2 D&#x27; R2 F B R2 F D&#x27; F&#x27; D B&#x27;  (24)
LL: L D B&#x27; L B L&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27;  (9)

I shall keep the results in a small spreadsheet. How about calculating
the average of 3 out of 5 attemps (5 weeks), best &amp; worst attempt not
counting (just like speedcubing competition)?

See you guys,

Gus

I looked at your solution. For the f2l part the last F&#x27; should not be 
there. The LL is correct (a pure fliptwister!!). This makes the total 
33, not 34. Very impressive (and lucky) for only 5 minutes.

I never got round to doing the full hour solution, a very busy week :-

          <div class="email-content">Hi Pe(e)r, :-)
  I think that &quot;e&quot; should not be there but F&#x27; is OK. Yes, 34 is 
excelent and Guus is the 5-minute winner. 
In my 1-hour attempt, I found U D F R B&#x27; (2) R2 B&#x27; R&#x27; _ F2 U&#x27; L F&#x27; 
U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; (1)_ R&#x27; D F&#x27; D&#x27; R + swap 2x2 corners. Then I spent half an 
hour finding nothing else, so I returned to this one and inserted U 
L D L&#x27; U&#x27; L D&#x27; L&#x27; at (1). Then I made a mistake and ran out of 
time :-(. Later, I finished with the second insertion B&#x27; R B L2 B&#x27; 
R&#x27; B L2 at (2) which gives not very good 31-moves solution. I was 
too busy this week to work on it more, ended up not submitting 
anything to Dan&#x27;s FMC. 
Hopefully next week will be better.
Happy cubing!
  Mirek

Hmm. When i used the fewest moves companion i simply removed F&#x27; from 
Guus solution step 1. Then his solution worked perfectly - in 33 
turns.

Mirek - you can go beyound 1 hr for Dan&#x27;s FMC. For this unofficial 
friendly competition we have to stick to 5 min linear and 1 hr 
official rules respectively.

Happy &quot;reductions&quot; :D

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per, Mirek,

For Dan&#x27;s FMC 180 my 5min solve was 45 moves:
D&#x27; F&#x27; U B2 D&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27; L U D&#x27; L D R U2 L B L&#x27; B&#x27; U2 B&#x27; L&#x27; B L&#x27; B D&#x27; B&#x27; D
U&#x27; L&#x27; U L&#x27; U&#x27; L2 U L2 B&#x27; F L F&#x27; L&#x27; B F&#x27; D F D&#x27;  (45)
Not very good, I couldn&#x27;t see nice blocks zo quickly. I started with a
siamese 2x2x2 (14 moves) then two seperate pairs (6 + 7 moves) and a
two fase F2L (18 moves).

My 1 hour solution was 30 moves:
2x2x3: L2 D&#x27; F&#x27; U L D&#x27; B&#x27; R (8)
F2L-pair: L2 D&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; F D2 L&#x27; (15)
F2L + smooth LL: D&#x27; L B D2 B&#x27; L&#x27; D L D R&#x27; D L&#x27; D&#x27; R D (30)

Do you have solutions for FMC180?

Greetz;)

PS. Per thanx for correcting my previous solution. Working precisely
is my weakest point.</div>

about 30 trials were below 30 and the worst were close to 50 moves 
and over time. 
The FMC 180 I finished as one of the worst and over time as well. 
Then I tried it second time: D&#x27; U2 R2 F B R L U&#x27; B&#x27; L2 B&#x27; U2 L B L 
F&#x27; L2 F L&#x27; F&#x27; L F L(23) + 11 moves for the edge 3-cycle. 
In 1-hour span I did not find anything better than inserting this 3-
cycle:  D&#x27; U2 R2 F B R L U&#x27; B&#x27; L2 B&#x27; U2 L (U B F&#x27; L2 B&#x27; F U) B L F&#x27; 
L2 F L&#x27; F&#x27; L F L (30).
I would prefer to expand the 5-minutes to 10-minutes if you agree. 
Still just one trial, no moves taking back, time does not include 
scrambling but includes writing the solution down.

Happy holiday!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Mirek &amp; others,

I agree, 5 minutes is too short, it&#x27;s only turning and writing down
and almost no time to think. So this week (Dan&#x27;s FMC 181) I did 10
minutes and 1 hour. These are my results:

Scramble:  D F&#x27; L R U&#x27; L2 R&#x27; D2 B2 F2 R&#x27; L B2 L2 U2 B2 D&#x27; B2 U&#x27; D L U2
B2 R F2

my solution 10min: 37 moves:
Pseudo 2x2x3: B2 F R&#x27; {U&#x27; D} R U2 B&#x27; (8)
Pseudo F2L: D&#x27; R&#x27; D2 R B&#x27; D&#x27; B R&#x27; D2 R D&#x27; F D F&#x27; (22)
LL edges: F&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; D R F (27)
LL Corners:  F L F&#x27; R F L&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; (34)
undo pseudoness: D F2 U2 (37)

1hour solution: B2 F R&#x27; {U&#x27; D} R F&#x27; U B2 U&#x27; F U B2 U B&#x27; D R2 D R&#x27; D&#x27;
R&#x27; B R2 B&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; D R&#x27; D&#x27; R F2 U2 (32)
explanation:
pseudo 2x2x3: B2 F R&#x27; {U&#x27; D} R U2 . B&#x27; (8)
pseudo F2L + LL edges: D R2 D R&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; B R2 B&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; D R&#x27; D&#x27; R (23)
undo pseudoness: F2 U2 (25)
at dot (after move 7) insert: F&#x27; U B2 U&#x27; F U B2 U&#x27;

Shall we start a 10 week competition starting from FMC 182?
The rules I propose are: Best &amp; worst two attemps doare cancelled ,
for the other 6 attemps the avarage is calculated. FMC-10min and
FMC-1hour counted are seperately? Any suggestions on this? 

Happy Cubing;)

I&#x27;m a bit uncertain if you mean 10 weeks with best and worst deleted 
or 12 weeks with 10 counting entries ?? Best and worst wrt submitted 
lengths or wrt placement for that week?? Honestly i wish Ryan Heise 
would host those challenges. Just having results/entries floating in

          <div class="email-content">I predict it will be hard to find people who will turn in 2 solutions  
for 10 straight weeks. I&#x27;d prefer some scheme where you can miss a  
few weeks and still do well.

We all enjoy doing this, but I think/hope it is not anyone&#x27;s number 1  
priority in life, and now and then you&#x27;re busy with other things.

Average of top 5 solutions during 10 weeks perhaps?

          <div class="email-content">Hi gu(y)s,
   I agree with all good ideas you came up with the last week. I am 
willing to get a Google account and fill in a shared excel 
spreadsheet that Lars wants to prepare. Ten consecutive FMC solved 
in 10 minutes should not be a problem to anybody while spending 1-
hour every week could be a bit more difficult for some. I suggest 
that one can skip one week of two and catch up later. We trust each 
other anyway and we agree not to work on (or look at others 
solutions) any FMC until the 1-hour attempt is finished and recorded.
So, 10 weeks, two longest and two shortest out of 10 solutions will 
not be counted (for each contestant) in the final average of 6. For 
Per, 12 would take 3 months, so we agree on 10, OK. We count in HTM, 
i.e. B2 is one move, R&#x27;L are two moves. We can see later if other 
metric would have helped somebody. For example, counting R F R&#x27; as 
one move (HaHa :-), just kidding). 
BTW, my last challenge in 10 minutes was not lucky again. 
L2 B&#x27; R2 L F D2 F&#x27; L2 F&#x27;_ L U L B&#x27; U&#x27; B L&#x27; F2 U2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F U&#x27; F2 D&#x27; B&#x27; 
U&#x27; B&#x27; R B R&#x27; U B L U&#x27; R U2 L&#x27; U L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; (42 moves, in 7min 12sec).
1-hour: R&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; D. L2 U _ L2 F2 R&#x27; D F L&#x27; B D2 B&#x27; L&#x27; F B&#x27; U2 B2 F&#x27; 
L D L&#x27; D2 B&#x27;, insert D&#x27; B D F&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; D F at the dot (32).
  Happy and lucky cubing!
