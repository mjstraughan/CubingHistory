Well, your solution still beat mine by 3 moves, Gus. Congratulations. 
I still need to work on block-building.

I also spent a lot of time looking for a reasonable skeleton, hoping 
to find something to get me a final move count in the 30s. With the 
round nearing expiration, I found a skeleton that was slightly better 
than another previous one I had found, so I started looking for 
insertions into that skeleton. That skeleton left a 5-cycle of 
corners. I found an insertion with 2 moves cancelling, one with 3 
moves cancelling, and then the &quot;free&quot; one. I then realized that the 
free insertion and the insertion that only had only 2 moves 
cancelling could be combined to solve the 5-cycle, so I just decided 
to go with that solution. I figured there was a reasonable chance (if 
I searched the rest of the skeleton) of finding a better insertion 
for the one cancelling only 2 moves, but what I had already found 
(two 8-move commutators with a total of 10 moves cancelling) was 
already better than what I expected to find.

Bruce,
 Neither I have experienced a free insertion ever. I wish I had such 
case when having an 18-move skeleton. :-)

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s my story from San Francisco Open 2009 - FMC

Scramble for 1-hour fewest moves challenge was: 
D2 (U&#x27; F2 U&#x27; B&#x27;)5 U&#x27; B U&#x27; (R&#x27; F R&#x27; U&#x27;)4 B2 D&#x27; (B&#x27; L&#x27; U)3 F&#x27;

First, I have to say that I hate this form of scrambling. I am glad 
it&#x27;s not used any more in an on-line competition any more. And, of 
course, I messed up my first scramble. Then I mixed the second cube 
and guess what, wrong mix again. I had to solve one cube and to 
scramble it again. This was the last time I had to scramble the cube 
this way. Since, I kept inverting my solution.
	
Solution:
F2 U&#x27; L D&#x27; B2 U2 D F2 D&#x27; B2 D F2 D&#x27; R2 D F D2 F D2 F&#x27; D&#x27; F D2 R F&#x27; R&#x27; 
D&#x27; L&#x27; F L D (31) 

2X2X3 block: F2 U&#x27; L D&#x27; B2 U2 B2 *R2
pseudo f2l:   D F D2 F D2 F&#x27; D&#x27; F D 
edges of last layer: D R F&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; F L D
corners - insert at *: B2 D F2 D&#x27; B2 D F2 D&#x27;

In fact, this was my backup solution after first 10 minutes. I liked 
the scramble, found two ways for an 8-move 2x2x3 block, other two 9 
moves long and more. Yet I couldn&#x27;t hit a jackpot. Lars Petrus, 
working at the next table on his solutions, finished aftre 38 
minutes, leaving the place, just sending a message that he had 
something that he didn&#x27;t hope to improve. That convinced me he had 
something around 26 moves. He was bluffing but made me nervous, 
anyway. 
Lars, can you post your nice 32-move piece here?

BTW, I believe, Gus can find a sub-30 at his home environment easily.
  
Hope for more luck next time.

I once had 9 turns cancel from 2 3-cycle insertions. I guess i have had 
6 turns cancel on inserting a plain vanilla 8-turn 3-cycle.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Mirek,

Yes, I got sub-30 on this scramble, but not easy.
I had to scramble over 20 times, at least 6 times wrong. Note that
scramble is over 50 moves and suddenly counting to 5 is very
difficult....  
So over 50% of the hour I was scrambling and meaningless (speed)solving.
This is what I finally got:

L2 U R2 U&#x27;L2 U R2 U F2 U D&#x27; L&#x27; D L D&#x27; R2 D2 L D L&#x27; D F&#x27;L B&#x27; L B L2 F2
D2 (29)
2x2x3 + 2 F2L pairs: U2 F2 U D&#x27; L&#x27; D L D&#x27; R2
F2L + LL edges: D2 L D L&#x27; D F&#x27;L B&#x27; L B L2 F2 D2
leaving a corner 3-cycle.
At beginning insert L2 U R2 U&#x27;L2 U R2 U&#x27;, 1 move cancel.

You 8-move 2x2x3 was great. I missed it, luckily because when I would
have found it I wasn&#x27;t be able to do sub-30. I tried to finish nicely
for over 30 minutes but could find a nice continuation. Also tried
pre-moves D2 and F2 D2 for 11 or 12 move F2L-minus-pair, but no sub-30
finish at all!

I&#x27;m amazed you can solve and reverse-solve back to the original
scramble. I can&#x27;t do that, only 4 or 5 moves reverse maximum. you
know, I&#x27;m not writing down all my moves, only after I find something
promising. Maybe I should switch to your strategy, or you to mine....

Anyway, trying to solve a competition scramble always gives fun.

Hope you and Lars can figure out to seriously attack my world record.
Breaking it by others will give me a new impulse.

So the scramble was not as easy as it looks.
You touched an interesting topic - is it good idea to write down every
move you make? I&#x27;ve been thinking about it in the past, too. And don&#x27;t
take me wrong, I can&#x27;t keep taking moves back without writing them
down, just a small number like you can. My conclusion was this: if the
scramble is short, say 20 moves, or if I don&#x27;t have a pen and paper
(for example while commuting), I keep solving and scrambling. However,
if the scramble is long, say 30 moves or more, I scramble once and
also any time I mess it up. It seems to be faster for me avoiding
repeated scrambling. 
The problem comes with pre-moves when I need to scramble differently.
Recently, I try to avoid pre-moves unless the position is really
promissing. I even solved this week FMC without pre-moves! They just
take too much time unless the pre-moves are the right ones. I am
considering scrambling the second cube once a pre-move pops up to my
eyes, leaving an option of switching back to normal scramble quickly.
BTW, I mostly use just one cube.

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

Personally i think writing down every move is quite bad. It steals 
time away from the solve. When &quot;happy go lucky&quot;-ing it is a good idea 
to try out 6-7 turns that you can reverse &quot;easily&quot; from short term 
memory.

On the other side, writing down every turn for speed solution is a 
very good idea. In fact i would be lost without that. Recalling a 
complete solution is not an easy task, new ideas pop up all the time 
and distracts your memory :-P

Hi Per,<br>
<br>
I didn&#x27;t use Mirek&#x27;s inverse solution to scramble because that doesn&#x27;t
simulate the competition circumstances.<br>
<br>
Always nice to hear from you. Hope you and your family are all doing
well and in good health.<br>
<br>
By the way, do you check the weekly scrambles in advance? Last weeks&#x27;
scramble was very easy with two, already prepared,&amp;nbsp; 1x2x2 blocks.<br>
<br>
Enjoy<br>
<br>
Gus. <br>

Per, I think having 4-months old sun IS a lot of fun. :-)
Thanks for small updates on your FMC site. We now have a link to this
forum from there.

You know, I don&#x27;t write down all move I make, just those that look
promising. Few moves I try and take back. But I want to be able to go
back at any time and to avoid solving-scrambling cycles. I need less
than 2 sheets of paper to fill with notes (1-sided) in 1 hour. 
Gus, you&#x27;re funny about why he didn&#x27;t use my inverse solve to
scramble. Or you did not get the question? 

Have fun with the cube and/or the baby, whatever applies.

No i do not do any kind of prescreening on the scrambles. I do not care 
about avoiding &quot;easy&quot; scrambles. I only care about randomness. If 
anyone knows about how to set up generating scrambles automatically, 
using fully random positions and in a linux environment please let me 
know. My site is on linux shared hosting, so i cannot use the cube 
explorer. Actually i think fmc-ing is more fun when i know that the 
scramble(s) are not made deliberately &quot;hard&quot; ;-)

I used to love this form of scrambling. At Dan&#x27;s old site this format 
was used a lot. It made it easier to memorise a scramble, after 
performing it many time over. Not that it was a time saver, but for 
unlimited time i didnt care about it ;-)

Welcome to the 21-turns club:-) HTM is what counts (for me and 
officially). QTM is fun to play with when HTM becomes bad. And yes, 
Mirek is hard to beat in 1 hr and also in QTM. I hope to participate

Grzegorz, you did the hardest part and let your computer to earn the
credit. I need less than 5 minutes to search for the best insertion
like this. Can you write a program that would find skeletons? 
Or, maybe, we should team up. You&#x27;d be giving me skeletons and I&#x27;d be
finishing them. :-)

My strategy: when I can&#x27;t make an short edge- or corner-framework I
search for several ways to create a (pseudo) F2L an check if&amp;nbsp; I
recognize the F2L alg. I know &amp;plusmn;120 F2L algs.<br>

Hi Mirek &amp;amp; others,<br>
<br>
I agree, this was a hard scramble. No starting pair(s) neither after 1
move! <br>
My solution was 32 moves in 1 hour but I wasn&#x27;t able to post it because
of illness.<br>
Congratulations to Oliver&amp;nbsp;Wolff sub 30 is very good. Actually, I also
found that 11move F2L-minus-1-slot but couldn&#x27;t find a good finish.<br>
Sadly no entries for 10 minutes linear solve. My solve this time was 42
moves. Com&#x27;on boys (&amp;amp;girls) give it a try!<br>
<br>
Hope to see you all competing in #229<br>
<br>

  &lt;p>I am wondering what would be the shortest 2x2x3 block found with a<br>
computer program. I had DNF for 1-hour limit and forgot to post the<br>
following under unlimited time. <br>
This 9-move block B&#x27; D2 R2 L&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; L2 F U2 (9) did not look good, so<br>
I modified it to <br>
2x2x3: B&#x27; D2 R2 L&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; L F L U2 (10) which looks very nice.<br>
I spent too much time working on this only to find 29-move solution in<br>
total about 90 minutes. <br>
B&#x27; D2 R2 L&#x27; *U&#x27; B&#x27; L F L U2 _ D&#x27; B D B U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 R&#x27; U R U2 B L2 and<br>

Hi Guys,<br>
<br>
Scramble #230 on &lt;a
 href=&quot;http://fmc.mustcube.net/results.php?round=230&amp;amp;format=official&amp;amp;metric=htm&quot;>Per
site</a> was a terrible one for me. Congratz&amp;nbsp; to Mirek (31 moves),
Joan-Carles (33 moves) and Grzegorz (34 moves).<br>
I didn&#x27;t find anything sub 35, was on the wrong track, like Benelux
Open (also 35 moves. <br>
Actually too much I rely on my last pair e/o LL-algs and not on frame
building. I really should change my strategy!<br>
<br>
I promise to post my results next weeks<br>
<br>
Bye<br>

Hi Mirek,<br>
<br>
30 moves is good. You would have won that competition, together with
Jacco Krijnen, who had a lucky, 6 moves, LL solve.<br>
<br>
Because I wasn&#x27;t happy with my 35-move solve after the competition I
spent another hour on that scramble and I got:<br>
&lt;font color=&quot;White&quot;>&lt;font color=&quot;#330033&quot;>R F&#x27; D F D2 R&#x27; U2 F2 L&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27;
F D2 F&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; R2 F U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; R&#x27; F B&#x27; (26)<br>
Also a luck LL.<br>
<br>
Your 24 moves on speedsolving.com was excellent. I didn&#x27;t find it after
I read about the 6-move 2x2x3.<br>
Did you already check my solution on that scramble?<br>
<br>
My next competition be after the summer or so, I will practice on
frame-building.<br>
<br>
See ya<br>

Hi Mirek,<br>
Breaking the world record is not easy! We already knew this since your
28-WR was standing for over 3 years.<br>
You don&#x27;t need to check my c3-insertions anymore. I&#x27;m not a beginner: I
claim they are optimal all the time!<br>
Meet you at #232 (which looks promising)<br>

Can you prove corner 5-cycle insertion optimality? If you say yes, it would be hard to believe - unless you had some software or couple of hrs at your disposal ;-)

Make a better site?
Have some simple prices?
More categories?

I do not see it as a goal to get 20 or more 50+ solutions each week. I want to make FMC attractive mostly for fmc &quot;purists&quot;, not for the sake of having a high participation each week - although that is also nice in itself :D

To promote FMC it should be made more attractive to attend official FMC events at regular competitions. Most often FMC is run in parallell with other events - preventing many &quot;cubers&quot; from taking part.

I still remeber Euro 2004. They forgot to even mention the FMC results in the closing ceremony, until they were made aware of it - gosh!!

My guess is I may need about 1 hour when the skeleton is about 25 moves.  But often much less than that if there is a major cancellation at one 3-cycle insertion. You can use the fact that corner 5-cycles are at least 12 moves long (is it right?). That limits possible cancellations in nested insertions.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I don&#x27;t know the minimal 5-cycle of corners. MOre than 20 yrs ago i found this easy corner 7-cycle: (L D R&#x27; D&#x27;)*4 Probably not optimally short for a 7-cycle, but at least extremely easy to remember :D

I guess it was about the same time i found this easy edge 4-flip: (M D)*4 and an easy edge 11-cycle that i don&#x27;t recall off hand. 

This probably dates back to around 1982 or so ;-)

Per

PS! For added bonus i can also list this easy corner 3-twist:
(R&#x27; D&#x27; R L z&#x27;)*4. Not optimal but nice ;-)

          <div class="email-content">In my previous message, I said I thought &lt;R,x,y> might very well be generated using only two generators. My GAP calculations indicate this to be the case. In fact, my GAP calculations indicate that &lt;x,Ry> is the same group as &lt;R,x,y>. So for a direct proof of two generators being sufficient, we just need to find a way to generate R and y using x and Ry as generators. (And if we can generate one of these with x and Ry, then generating the other is trivial.)

Johannes Laire had a page for that. Actually not really. It first found shortest 2x2x2 blocks. Then you find extensions for these.

My guess is that the ones found by humans are pretty much optimal anyway. Maybe 1 or 2 moves off. Then again, how useful would it be to find an optimal 2x2x3 block? Would the solution necessarily be easy from such a start. It might have a lot of bad edge orientations, Etc etc ...

I organize a weekly FM contest on the french biggest forum about Rubik&#x27;s Cube : francocube.com.

I&#x27;ve already posted solutions for the FMC but not regulary so I&#x27;ll try to practice more because practice makes perfect ;)

The 2x2x2 block solver is at http://laire.dy.fi/old/step_1/.
A newer but not finished solver is at http://laire.dy.fi/jarcs/,
and it can find optimal 2x2x3 blocks.

I only test on Firefox, other browsers might or might not work.

Isn&#x27;t it the truth that you specifically target only users of other browsers than Internet Explorer. This was the case with previous versions of your page anyhow. Whenever i tried (by mistake) to open your page in Internet Explorer it told me to use a decent browser. So not only are you testing only on a limited set of browsers, you seem to be actively blocking a large chunk of users. I have done extensive coding with javascript and never found serious issues with the IE implementation. Layoutwise yes - but at least it worked ;-)

I target people using browsers that support the standards I use. Whenever I&#x27;m unsure about something, I read the standards and not some specific browser&#x27;s documentation. It just happens that Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera etc. support the standards well enough. IE and Lynx, at the moment, don&#x27;t.

I only test on Firefox, yes. I don&#x27;t use Windows so even if I wanted, I couldn&#x27;t test IE easily.

Some time ago I did try it, and almost nothing worked like in other browsers. I think it&#x27;s better to make it clear to the user that IE isn&#x27;t supported than to just leave them wondering.

I can&#x27;t be bothered to get the exact statistics, but IE users are actually well below 50% of all visitors. Occasionally someone, after trying that browser, comes back in a few minutes with FF.

You might not care about cross-platform or free/open source software or standards, but some people do.

Even tiny issues are enough to make it fail, since I don&#x27;t know what they are and don&#x27;t feel like spending time learning about them.

I&#x27;m much more interested in the solving algorithms than web stuff. So I can either 1) do what I like doing and improve the solvers, or 2) do something I don&#x27;t like just to make Per happy.

If I was paid to make websites and they had to work on IE, that&#x27;d be a completely different thing of course. But this is just a hobby. Use my site or don&#x27;t.

Hi Mirek,<br>
<br>
I agree, the results of last few weeks were remarkable. I really missed
your effort.<br>
A list, as you mentioned, already exists, check out:
<a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-freetext&quot; href=&quot;http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_stats_fm.html&quot;>http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_stats_fm.html</a><br>

<br>
Already 7 people on that list with sub-23. Xavier will be a new one.<br>
Mirek, your result is outdated, 22 moves, while you achived 19 moves on
FMC 203 at <a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-freetext&quot; href=&quot;http://fmc.mustcube.net&quot;>http://fmc.mustcube.net</a><br>

Would be nice if you register your newest achievements.<br>

Happy cubing.<br>

NB. FMC #238 at fmc.mustcube.net seems to be a hard scramble...<br>

I could compile such a list if i had access to all the old results from Dan Harris&#x27; old site. I have many times asked to get access to this - but still i do not have it. I do not like spending hours manually browsing the old result lists online.

Here is the names of the people i seem to recall have done 22 turns or less:

Mirek Goljan
Guus Razoux Schultz
Sebastian Dumitrescu
Xavier Morin
Lars Petrus
David Wesley
Per Kristen Fredlund
Jimmy Coll (Barcelona Open 2009)

I&#x27;m not sure whether this list is complete ...

Solutions achieved without insertions should IMHO rank higher than the others.

Maybe all who got 22 moves or less.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Of course i care about standards and open-source software. Yes i guess i&#x27;m pretty biased towards tweaking to make things work - rather than blindly just following standards and best practices. This is by and large because i do web-programming mainly for work. This actually make me lazy doing my own web stuff. I do not really feel like doing &quot;work stuff&quot; in my spare time. Besides having to make pages work in IE through my work, i do feel obliged to support the largest user base (IE is still the most widely used browser). The new IE 8 seems to make IE more popular again - even i cannot really see that this would be technically justified (!!). So my view is pragmatic and guided by the user base i target. On the pluss side i actually find it better to make it work in IE first. Then it&#x27;s much much easier to work out the little quirks afterwards. Rather than leaving IE as the last challenge ;-)

This is way outside cube related stuff so we better stop it here :-P

Hi Per,<br>
<br>
Why solutions with insertions ranked higher than the others? It&#x27;s
doesn&#x27;t seem to make any sense. <br>
For example my strategy in most cases is to get an easy (pseudo)LL and
insertions only in emergency-cases.....<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Well, in a sense non-insertion solves are purer and harder to find in a short time - when very short. It is only my personal opinion that short solves with no insertion have a higher merit. Both &quot;linear&quot; and &quot;skeletal&quot; solving has chance of big luck. But a complete acceptable solution of luck is hard to find. For speeding there is an official definition of luck (skip a step). That does not really applies to fewest moves, as we always strive to find an easy, lucky path.

My short previous list was only based on what i could recall from the fewest moves results.

Please allow me to be sceptical about Tony Snyders claims. Very short fewest moves and sub 10 times.

For speeding there is an official definition of luck (skip a step). That does not really applies to fewest moves, as we always strive to find an easy, lucky path.

All I can say is that I agree completely.
The more qualified attempts you can make in a short time the more chance for luck you have.

          <div class="email-content">Hi !

You can use the fmc companion - online version - to remove x,y and z from your solutions. My fmc site uses the companion (indirectly) to verify submitted solutions. While inspecting the cube (while also rotating it), i find it extremely useful to have fixed colourscheme and avoiding x,y, z (also in temporary notations). It&#x27;s just far more realiable - less prone to doing errors. Especially in competitions where you cannot verify notation by automatic means ...

It seems that Jimmy Coll just hit one of those lucky solves when he set his Official World Record (OWR) of 22 face turns. Just recently, in Nantes Open he did a more &quot;humane&quot; 40 turns.

Oh well, most OWR&#x27;s are probably lucky solves by now :D

No, the purpose isn&#x27;t finding useful move sequences. As you said, computers can do that much better than humans. We do fewest moves solving because it&#x27;s fun and challenging, just like people who like solving Sudokus or playing chess.

          <div class="email-content">Joan-Carles, 
For some reason, I pushed L2 D R F ... and was not lucky with forming a good position. Also found a 9-move 2x2x3 block as L2 B R F B2 D&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; B. Nothing good enough to submit.

You found a better second move. Excellent!
Here is what you submitted:
2x2x2: L2 D&#x27; .. R F B R&#x27; (6) 
All but 4 corners: U *R&#x27; L U R B L&#x27; . B2 L&#x27; (15)
Insert 3CP at (.): L F&#x27; L&#x27; B L F L&#x27; B&#x27; (3 moves cancel) (20)
Insert 3CP at (..): D2 B&#x27; U&#x27; B D2 B&#x27; U B (1 move cancel) (27)

As you sugested, better insertions should exist. So I took a look and sure enough, yes. You were so close to the right one
Insert 3CP at (.): L B&#x27; R B L&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; B (6 moves cancel!) (17)
The last insertion is interesting. You can easily find many insertions of 8-move commutators and 1 move cancel, ending up with a 24-move solution. However, this is an exceptional case when a 10-move commutator is more suitable. Insert U&#x27; R U R&#x27; B2 R U&#x27; R&#x27; U B2 at * and you get L2 D&#x27; R F B U R&#x27; B2 R U&#x27; R&#x27; U B2 R&#x27; L U R2 B L&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27; (23).</div>

Besides having to make pages work in IE through my work, i do feel obliged to support the largest user base (IE is still the most widely used browser). The new IE 8 seems to make IE more popular again - even i cannot really see that this would be technically justified (!!). So my view is pragmatic and guided by the user base i target. On the pluss side i actually find it better to make it work in IE first. Then it&#x27;s much much easier to work out the little quirks afterwards. Rather than leaving IE as the last challenge ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi, I am new in this forum.
I have tried to search this forum and the rest of the internet for some guidelines for few moves.
I learned that the heise-method should be a method that uses relatively few moves do people use this one?
I also saw one mention a method he called something like &quot;skeleton with insertions&quot; is this a good method? And where can I find information about it?
If there is some other method which would generate solves with few moves please say I am very eager to try to learn to solve the cube with few moves.
Thank you very much!</div>

          <div class="email-content">No, you must manually enter the solution in both places. I think it would be nice if a person submits a 1-hour solution, but not a &quot;classic&quot; solution, that the 1-hour solution would automatically be taken as a &quot;classic&quot; solution as well. But it doesn&#x27;t work that way, and there have been a number of times where a 1-hour solution would have been first place as a &quot;classic&quot; solution, but the person did not resubmit the 1-hour solution in the classic category.

Hi Lars,<br>
<br>
Welcome (back) to Per&#x27;s place!<br>
I always post my (same) solution twice, one time for officail format
(1-hour) and one time for classic format (168-hours).<br>
There seems no other way to do it.<br>
But after posting a solution you can navigate back in your browser,
change the &quot;Competition format&quot; enter your password and submit again<br>
(sorry Lars, this trick was invented before Google existed)<br>

          <div class="email-content">OK, I can do it manually.
I&#x27;m reluctant to post both, since I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll find something better
later. There is always more options to explore. But now that I think of it,
I assume I can always submit a new solution later?

Hi Guys,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d like to welcome all those new great FMC-cubers that give us close
results for Per&#x27;s FMC&amp;nbsp; (fmc.mustcube.net) each week, Tomoaki, Lui,
Ardianto. And last but not least welcome Lars Petrus from a long break.
Sadly enough I did not spot him on the WC2009 entry list.<br>
<br>
Something went wrong after I entered my solution for #260, I didn&#x27;t see
my solution on the list on Sunday.<br>
My hour solution was:<br>
F2 R&#x27; U2 L2 U R&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; U B R&#x27; B&#x27; R L&#x27; B&#x27; L D R&#x27; B2 R B2 R D2 R&#x27; D F (&lt;b>27&lt;/b>)<br>
<br>
explanation:<br>
turn pre-scramble-move F to understand<br>
cross + pair: F2 R&#x27; U2 L2 U R&#x27; (6)<br>
2nd pair: B&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; U (10)<br>
3th pair: B R&#x27; B&#x27; R (14)<br>
last pair: L&#x27; B&#x27; L (17)<br>
F2L: D R&#x27; B2 R B2 R D2 R&#x27; D (26)<br>
premove correction: F&amp;nbsp; (27)<br>
Very classic solution, It took me a while to find this 6 move starter
but then everything went fluently...<br>
<br>
Congratz Tomoaki for you 27 move solve, very different from mine. <br>
<br>
Hope to see you all next week in the results (very promising scramble!)<br>
Ad hopefully we will see Per, Mirek and&amp;nbsp; Joan-Carles&amp;nbsp;Vilaseca back soon.<br>

4th pair+LL cross: B D2 B D2 B&#x27; D&#x27; B<br>
LL corners: B R F R&#x27; B&#x27; R F&#x27; R&#x27;<br>
Which is a very smart Fridrich solve!<br>
Well done Oliver!<br>
<br>
I ended up with a 32-move solution, made a mistake while writing down
(and wiping out my 34-move backup solution), no time left to check.<br>
I searched the wrong paths, missed an easy 29-move opportunity
(nerves!) and at home I check and find out I was nearby a 26-move
solution.<br>
<br>
All these solution (32, 29,and 26 movers) were all based on
pre-scramble-moves [B2 U&#x27; D&#x27; F] (last three of them found using the
inverse scramble) followed by <br>
F2L minus pair: [U F L B U F&#x27; U2 D2 B2] (9+4). <br>
With 20 minutes left I decided to stick on this start because I was
sure I would find a sub 30 on it.<br>
<br>
But I got nervous, with 15 minutes to go I found a 25 move edge frame: <br>
my start: [pre: B2 U&#x27; D&#x27; F][scramble][U F L B U.F&#x27; U2 D2 B&#x27;] (13)<br>
F2L: B&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U L&#x27; B (18)<br>
LL edges: D L F L&#x27; F&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; (25) <br>
at the dot I inserted D&#x27;B2 D F2 D&#x27; B2 D F2, poorly enough only 1 move
cancelled.<br>
<br>
But time was almost up and only 2 minutes left to write this solution
on the result paper. I checked if I didn&#x27;t make any writing errors, I
didn&#x27;t but sad enough the original solution contained an error already
and there was no time left to check it on a clean cube! Resulting in
DNF.<br>
<br>
What I should have done is finishing F2L an alternate way (I normally
always check, without pressure) which would have given me:<br>
My start: [pre: B2 U&#x27; D&#x27; F][scramble][U F L B U.F&#x27; U2 D2 B2] (13)<br>
F2L: D L B&#x27; L2 B (18)<br>
LL: U&#x27; L&#x27; U L&#x27; U&#x27; L F&#x27; L F U L2 (29) <br>
PS. Last LL-alg is very common for speedcubers (my system and Fridrich)<br>
Still can&#x27;t beleave I missed this one!<br>
<br>
But What I really should have done is apply my nice start on the
inverse scramble (so pre-moves and starting moves will be inversed and
swapped!):<br>
[pre: B2 D2 U2 F U&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27;][inverse scramble] [F&#x27; D] (11)<br>
finishing F2L: U2 B (13)<br>
Last pair+smoothly continue with LL-alg: L U&#x27; L F&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; D L&#x27; F L U
L&#x27; (26)<br>
At home, without nerves, I needed 10 minutes to find this.<br>
<br>
After 27 years of waiting to become a world-champion I won&#x27;t bother
waiting another 2 years...<br>
<br>
Most important: I had a lot of fun, especially with Maarten, that crazy
guy from Israel (Shuka), Yasmine&amp;amp;Peter and may others.<br>

  &lt;p>Hi Guys,<br>
WC is over, Surprising Result, Oliver Perge won on 26 moves, Guus and
Arnaud got DNF..<br>
  <br>
What happen there Guus? I heard in speedsolving.&lt;wbr>com, the scramble
is D2 B&#x27; F&#x27; D2 U2 F&#x27; D&#x27; F2 L2 R D2 L U&#x27; F&#x27; L2 D2 F2 L U2<br>
  <br>
I got 43 moves within an hour, found 15 moves pseudo F2L minus pair,
but not find good continuation.&lt;wbr>.<br>
  <br>

          <div class="email-content">Ardianto, it looks like you have an error in the scramble. I believe the 2nd move is B, not B&#x27;. (Please use copy/paste to avoid errors.) So I think you need to add another premove (B2 D2) to use your solution, which then becomes 44 moves.

I spent less than 10 minutes, I think, and came up with a 43-move solution with a mediocre OLL/PLL finish (22-move F2L and effectively 21-move LL after cancellations). I didn&#x27;t spend any more time on it.

Maarten posted his 30-move solution on speedsolving.com in Puzzle Theory -> The FMC Thread.

I posted this scramble based on post on this http://www.speedsolving.com/forum/showthread.php?p=248140#post248140, before saw Mats&#x27; post in FMC thread..

after a day, I saw Mats&#x27; post and I just realized that 2nd move is B&#x27; not B. Sorry for my mistakes ;)
