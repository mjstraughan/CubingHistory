doing a lot of thinking about my method and I think I might be able <br>
to significantly reduce my solving time for doing the cube <br>
blindfolded using the Fridrich method.  Right now I estimate the <br>
limit to be about an hour with memorizing and solving, but I&#x27;m not <br>
very sure of the accuracy of that right now.  I&#x27;m not sure how <br>
practical this is, as it is essentially purposefully doing a problem <br>
one of the hardest ways possible and trying to get good at it, but <br>
I&#x27;m interested to see what happens.  Anyway I&#x27;m going to be very <br>
stubborn and not look at any of the other pages until I really work <br>
my method out.  I&#x27;ll probably devote a section of my page to it once <br>
I really work all the kinks of it, in case anyone ever feels inclined <br>
to do it the hard way :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m trying to learn to do the cube blindfolded exactly the same way 
as when I speed solve it, only it should actually be more like me 
solving for fewest moves since I have more time to think about it.  
At least that&#x27;s my goal anyway.  Not sure if it&#x27;s practical but I 
want to try it.  I figure if I can work on the mental aspect of 
following the pieces then I could probably do this pretty quickly 
(maybe sub-1 hour but I&#x27;m not sure about that yet).

<br>
What about a midway method ?<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s really easier to keep a numbers list (one dimensional) in memory <br>
than a colored cube (3D).<br>
But it&#x27;s much more efficient to apply algos that will move several <br>
pieces at a time like f2l or LL algs.<br>
<br>
I was wondering of the possibility of an hybrid method that would <br>
work like this :<br>
<br>
Orienting the corners : with the digit sequence for orientation we <br>
mentally compute a unique number.<br>
This number will refer to a specific algorithm which will solve<br>
the whole corners orientation without touching the corners <br>
permutations or the edges in any way.<br>
<br>
We would basically do the same thing for permuting the corners and <br>
for the edges in several steps.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know the feasibility of such a method...<br>
For exemple how many orient/permuts exists for the 8 corners ?<br>
<br>
With Carr&#x27;s method corners are solved using very few algorithms.<br>
But since algorithms are fore-memorized we should store more of them <br>
for blindfoldspeedcubing.<br>
<br>
The main problem of the fridrich method (for blindfold) is that every <br>
single alg will scramble the rest of the cube.<br>
It&#x27;s determinant to find a technique that do solve the cube gradually<br>
so we don&#x27;t have to update or save again the sequence number <br>
memorized at the beginning...( an edges first method might do <br>
this ?? )<br>

It took me 10 minutes for memorizing the cube, and 30 minutes for solving.<br>

They&#x27;re not in production yet though, right? That would be hard. 
Generally speaking going up a size increases the difficulty a lot.
For instance, a Revenge is much harder than 2 3x3x3&#x27;s, maybe harder 
than 3 3x3x3&#x27;s. You don&#x27;t have to remember as much but you can&#x27;t put 
as much to the back of your mind as doing separate cubes. Also the 
algorithms tend to be longer so it takes more time to finish and that 
in itself makes it harder. Plus they are really much harder to twist. 
You get very nervous when it feels as if maybe the centre pieces are 
about to come off and break away from the puzzle as you are twisting 
but you can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s best to make sure the puzzle stays in one 
piece.

I think 6x6x6 would be too hard for me at the moment. Probably need 
to do at least a 4x4x4 and a 5x5x5 first and before that 3 3x3x3s and 
a 5x5x5.

Maybe some day...

That megaminx is a bit troublesome too. It&#x27;s pretty difficult to keep 
the orientation of the puzzle as a whole in mind.

          <div class="email-content">Hey all, I joined up a while ago and didn&#x27;t really get serious about <br>
trying to learn to blindfold cube until about a week ago.  I hashed <br>
out a method and tried decided it was good enough to try about 2 days <br>
ago.  And today I have solved my first (and second and third and <br>
fourth...etc.) blindfolded 2x2x2 cube.  Nothing compared to some of <br>
you pros, but it&#x27;s a step in the right direction!<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve done it correctly probably around 10 times today.  Takes me <br>
about 3-5 minutes with memorization, but for a newb, I don&#x27;t think <br>
that&#x27;s too terrible.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll practice this for a while longer before I attempt the 3x3x3.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just thought I&#x27;d share!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I solved 2 cubes blindfolded today. <br>
I just thought I should do this to get myself ready for 5x5x5...<br>
It took me 12:20, and I don&#x27;t think I can improve much on it at this <br>
point. gotta practice this some more before I can memorize the <br>
5x5x5... almost gave me a headache... I don&#x27;t know how you can do 3-5 <br>
all at once, Dr.C!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Here is most of Richard&#x27;s advanced method in one email, a total of 95 <br>
algorithms!  These appeared in instalments over at speedsolving.<br>
<br>
I have changed some values to make it more useful for me to see -- at a <br>
glance -- probabilities.  My thinking is that this is too much for one <br>
person to memorize (though I would love it if someone proved me wrong) but <br>
that the list can be used to assemble a shorter list (that is what I am <br>
doing now).  This could drastically cut down execution times for <br>
blindfolding.  All credit goes to Dr C., of course.<br>

I&#x27;ll probably just practice quite a bit. once I get the memorization time down, then I&#x27;ll work on getting the solution method down.<br>

<br>
  Here is most of Richard&#x27;s advanced method in one email, a total of 95 <br>
  algorithms!  These appeared in instalments over at speedsolving.<br>
<br>
  I have changed some values to make it more useful for me to see -- at a <br>
  glance -- probabilities.  My thinking is that this is too much for one <br>
  person to memorize (though I would love it if someone proved me wrong) but <br>
  that the list can be used to assemble a shorter list (that is what I am <br>
  doing now).  This could drastically cut down execution times for <br>
  blindfolding.  All credit goes to Dr C., of course.<br>
