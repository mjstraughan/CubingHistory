        Hey everyone, I&#x27;m back from vacation, and seriously did use the
        whole time just to practice BLD solving. I&#x27;m becoming an addict,
        it&#x27;s so much fun! I did break my 3x3 BLD record, but only by 2
        seconds, and I successfully did the 5x5 BLD. I came up with a new set of
        24 nouns that are very similar to my orginal set, but still with
        absolutely no overlap. This way I can use both sets for the 4x4 so I can
        do lots of consecutive solves without getting as much interference from
        stories from previous solves, and I use the original 24set for my X
        centers on the 5x5 and the new set for the +centers making my centers
        memorization both with the story method (which I like). I&#x27;m still
        focusing on the 4x4 mainly, but I want to get better at the 5x5 too. My
        best memorization time for the 4x4 (not on a successful solve, but I
        traced the mistake and had only undone two setup moves in the wrong
        order) was 6:15. I think I can improve this to sub-6 and my best sighted
        solve with my BLD method so far is about 5:10 so I&#x27;m inching
        towards sub-10, which I still think is possible. Also I found the reason
        why I couldn&#x27;t improve my 3x3 memorization. When working out the
        cycles of both the corners and edges I count the number of pieces in
        each cycle, but I was doing this such as to give each piece in the cycle
        a number, which is useless since I don&#x27;t remember the number
        sequence. Now I&#x27;m working on just quickly memorizing the shapes of
        the pieces and giving each group of 4-5 pieces a name to help me
        remember the shape. I refuse to believe that my memory is not good
        enough, I&#x27;m trying to convince myself that I was using a dumb
        method and need to work on a better way of doing it. Anyway this message
        is getting long, but I just wanted to say that I&#x27;m back and have
        definitely found that I love BLD solving. Alright, good to be back and
        happy cubing all! Chris

        Well.... I finally did it, and I&#x27;ve been trying off and on for

        out on the last solve because of the DNF that I seriously tried to
        memorize and solve as if my life depended on it, I didn&#x27;t care at
        all about the time, I just wanted to finally get an average. I had such
        a hard time towards the end since I still remembered bits and pieces of
        cycles and orientations from previous solves. Often I had to sift
        through a cycle and think... no I&#x27;ve done that one already... no
        that was 2 solves ago... Man I don&#x27;t know how you guys do this and
        still keep getting fast times. After the first 3 solves I couldn&#x27;t
        forget my earlier ones and just switched to a slow gear and went more
        carefully. There was a lot of &quot;noise&quot; for me of trying to find
        the real cycle this cube in my hands had, how do you super BLDers handle
        this? Glad to finally have done it, it felt so wonderful! Chris

        If you can solve a particular edge, ignoring all other pieces, using
        only U F D B moves, (no 90 degree R or L moves), then that piece is
        oriented correctly. With practice, you&#x27;ll figure out your own

        Unless someone&#x27;s holding a gun to your head demanding a blindfolded
        average of 10, you shouldn&#x27;t get too freaked out by the DNF. No one
        expects you to get 12 solves in a row! When I practice, I just solve a
        few times, or if time permitting, until I DNF which is usually by the
        sixth or seventh try. Rarely, I make it past 12 because of fails or
        because it takes too much time. The problem with getting stressed out
        after the DNF is that when you finally do make it to 12 solves, the
        average you get is not representative of your actual average at all. It
        defeats the whole purpose of &quot;getting an average&quot;!! Chris, the
        first 7 solves before the DNF average to 3:06, which is almost a minute
        under what your final average turned out to be. And don&#x27;t worry, I
        always slow down after the first solve of a set. Something you could try
        is take a break in between BLD&#x27;s and do a quick speedsolve. Have

        Hey Leyan, I definitely see what you&#x27;re saying, and in the future
        if I DNF an average I won&#x27;t worry about it too much and will just
        try again another time. For me though if I try to go what I would
        consider my regular speed I might be able to get an actual average of 12
        once in 100 solves, but I tend to get 2 or 3 DNFs for every 12 solves at
        least (yeah my accuracy sucks). I think for you superhumans it&#x27;s
        possible to take an average of 12 and find out how fast you actually
        solve on average ;-) For me just getting an average of 12 is a feat in
        itself, though I hope to change that with more practice. But I do
        appreciate the tips though, I will definitely try to not freak out if I
        get a DNF and maybe solve just a bit slower to hope for a more
        representative average soon. Chris --- In

        I&#x27;ve been working on 4x4x4 pretty hard again, and I&#x27;ve come to
        the conclusion that I really hate the period between solves where I try
        to forget my last solve so that I can attempt another with a clean
        memory slate. Anyone have any tips to speed this up? I&#x27;d like to
        maximize my time as best I can, and currently I&#x27;d rather spend 5
        minutes not solving and doing nothing than doing two solves right in a
        row and spending that extra 5 minutes during recall to sort through my
        current solve and the one just before it. I&#x27;d prefer to limit this
        down to less than 5 minutes though. How much time are we given in a
        competition between solves for the bigger cubes? None basically? Do you
        go straight from one solve into the next since the big cube categories
        take up so much time? Or is the best idea to solve for 100% accuracy and
        not take your second solve to save yourself for the other big cube? You
        would then only use the 2nd solve for one cube just in case you
        don&#x27;t solve it the first time? Just wondering, I&#x27;d rather
        train for competitions now and be used to it when I get there than to be
        surprised. Stupid short term memory being better than I expected. I wish
        I could just repress the memory of my previous cube or forget it
        outright or something so I can do lots of solves in a row. Sigh... Chris

        Wow this really is interesting to think about. Take memory experiments
        in general, they have you memorize a string of say 10 words, and then
        they have you count backwards by 3&#x27;s or something for a while,
        something to really occupy your mind. Then afterward they tell you to
        repeat the words. The longer period of time you have to count backwards,
        the less likely you are to recall the information. Also, rehearsal of a
        piece of information is what lodges it into your memory. Each part of
        the cycle on your cube was rehearsed really hard during memorization,
        but also once again when you went through that part of the cycle. So you
        have to overcome a piece of information that is doubly rehearsed, plus
        you will have adrenaline during a competition which will help to
        rehearse it even further. So clearly the way to forget the information
        is to do something that is a lot of interference. Maybe you could
        multiply two 4 digit numbers in your head? Whether or not you get the
        answer right doesn&#x27;t matter, what matters is that you do something
        very mentally taxing that is not cube related at all. Afterward you will
        have a lot of interference working against your doubly rehearsed last
        cube state. I think I&#x27;m going to try this after my next solve.
        I&#x27;ll try multiplying two large numbers in my head, and try as best
        as I can to get the answer correct. After I&#x27;m done, if I feel
        I&#x27;ve forgotten my last cube I&#x27;ll try another solve. If I
        haven&#x27;t, I multiply two more numbers. Wow I think this might work
        for competitions too. Or you could try to factor a 4-5 digit number into
        it&#x27;s prime factorization or something, just something to really
        occupy your mind while the judges are scrambling your next cube. Hmmm...
        This sounds interesting to me, any ideas from anybody? Chris --- In

        I just thought of another way to try to create a lot of interference,
        you could rehearse a lot of fake cycles in your head for some pretend
        scramble. Don&#x27;t actually try to memorize them, but track the motion
        of locations across the cube the same way you would memorize, only in an
        endless loop. Research shows that memorizing a LOT of items that are all
        very similar makes it very hard to remember them. So why not absolutely
        and completely overload your brain with edge cycles to the point that it
        has to much similar information that you won&#x27;t remember any of what
        you just did, and hopefully you&#x27;ll have created some major
        interference helping you to forget your last solve. Whoa gotta try this
        too.... Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        It&#x27;s well known that feeling a smell or hearing a sound can make
        memories come back to you. They&#x27;re more easily accessible from a
        context. I don&#x27;t know anything about the science of memorization,
        but I wonder if you could plug in to this mechanism in some useful way.
        What if you were to create a context to your memorization by, for
        example eating candy with a special taste? Solve 1 is vanilla, solve 2
        is chocolate etc. I say candy because there is hard candy that you can
        suck on for quite a while, to keep the context alive. There are
        obviously many other possible markers than taste. Hope that made sense.

        hi guys, i would like to improve my blindfold system, i hope you can
        help me. i think you are using a similar method, but i don&#x27;t know
        why you are faster. here&#x27;s my current method: i always hold white
        on top and green in front. i thought this is the best but now i was
        thinking if it is better first to look if there is a better position to
        start from. first i orient the corners. therefor i use 4 moves, which
        are basically the same. it depends on the position of the corner, which
        one i use: UFR-position (clockwise): RF&#x27;R&#x27;F RF&#x27;R&#x27;F ,
        then i put the next one at UFR position and do the same twice again (if
        also clockwise) or the invers for counterclockwise. if the corner is in
        the bottom layer i use: RU&#x27;R&#x27;U RU&#x27;R&#x27;U, which is
        easyer to execute and twists DFR counterclockwise. if i have to twist
        clocksie, i put the corner to DBR-position and do: R&#x27;URU&#x27;
        R&#x27;URU&#x27; (three times). i think there is a faster move to turn 3
        corners clockwise (or counterclockwise) in the upper layer, but the move
        i use is easy and i dont have to think. edge-orieintation: (RE)4 is the
        basic move. with set-up-moves i put two edges in the upper layer and do
        the move twice. i i have to switch 4 edges, i put them in UR, FR, FL and
        BL position and do the move once. cornerpermutation: when i memorize i
        look which peace in in UFR position, i jump to the target position and
        look which peace is there and so on until i end at position 1. this is
        called a cycle? with a set-up-move i put 3 corners in the upper layer
        and do a 3-cycle and undo the setupmove. so 2 corners get placed
        correctly and the third one ends up in UFR position. i go on until
        everything is correct (if no parity). edgeorientation: here the
        setupmoves seem to be easyer (i only use UDRL and F2B2 moves). my
        3-cycle does UB->UR->UL->UB or counterclockwise, but UF stays where it
        is. thats why i start with UB position. if there is a parity i use the
        T-permutation. my best time with this method is 3:39 average about 5
        minutes, but i only solve 70%. how can i get faster. i need 1:20 to
        memorize. (1:10 is my record). are you only executing the moves faster
        or do you use another method? i know the pochmann-system, but i&#x27;m
        sure that cycles are faster. questions: 1) how many different moves do
        you use to orient/permute corners and edges 2) how long are your
        set-up-moves? 3) how many single moves are you doing during a solve? 4)
        are you alway holding the same color on top and in front? 5) how long do
        you memorize? 6) are you nervous before competitions? i only solved at
        chalmer&#x27;s open in 19 minutes. since that i try to go faster but
        alway DNS 7) what is the difference between DNS and DNF? i hope i
        didn&#x27;t annoy you and you understand my bad english. thanks, thomas

        think I might start using your moves to flip corners in the D layer.
        I&#x27;ve been using Macky&#x27;s way (or at least I learned it from
        Macky back at the US2004 competition). It twists three corners in either
        the L or R layer. Clockwise would be U&#x27; (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U
        R&#x27;) L U&#x27; (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;) L U&#x27; (R U
        R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;) L2 Counterclockwise is U&#x27; (R&#x27; U R
        U&#x27; R&#x27; U R) L U&#x27; (R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R) L
        U&#x27; (R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R) L2 I also flip corners in
        groups too: 2 corners: L&#x27; U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27;
        R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U R and the inverse is nice too R&#x27; U&#x27; R
        U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R L U L&#x27; U L U2 L 4 corners: L&#x27; U2 L U
        L&#x27; U&#x27; L U L&#x27; U L2 U&#x27; L U L U L U&#x27; L&#x27;
        U&#x27; L2 and the inverse to flip the corners the other way (I prefer
        LU moves so reflect for RU if you like RU better). > edge-orieintation:

        also use the move you are using, and I would use it as (RE)x4 if the

        it can be executed so much faster. Also I recommend using more algs too

        you are right, the term is cycles) and I solve them like you do.
        However, consider using cycles on the F or B or D face too. Also
        don&#x27;t neglect moves like U2 M&#x27; U2 M as well. Use commutators
        whenver you see them, since they tend to be shorter (you do a move to
        cycle them right there with no setup moves) . Do cycles on other faces
        than just U to minimize your setup moves. > questions: > 1) how many
        different moves do you use to orient/permute corners and edges I just
        use the same 3 cycles on other faces, and maybe a few more orientation

        sure what Macky and Leyan and Tyson and those guys use though. > 2) how
        long are your set-up-moves? cycling: Max 2, Min 0 and I probably average
        about a little over 1 setup move per alg execution. parity fix: I can
        get upwards of 7 moves or more, this is not my strongest point and is
        usually where I lose the most time. > 3) how many single moves are you
        doing during a solve? I just did a sighted BLD solve and got 158 moves
        for all steps > 4) are you alway holding the same color on top and in
        front? yes, I tried starting with the best corner orientation and
        switching centers, but probably not as much as I should have. I should
        look into that again... > 5) how long do you memorize? About as long as
        you do 1:20, close to 1:10 on a really good solve. I think once ever I
        got 58 or 59. 6) are you nervous before competitions? i only solved at
        chalmer&#x27;s open in 19 minutes. since that i try to go faster but
        alway DNS No, competitive BLD solving doesn&#x27;t make me nervous. If
        you are given 3 solves in the round you must solve with a roughly 78.5%
        accuracy rate in order to have a 99% chance of getting at least 1
        successful solve in the round. If you have 2 solves, then you must solve
        with exactly 90% accuracy rate to guarantee a 99% chance of getting at
        least one successful solve. In competition I don&#x27;t take many risks
        and just try for 100% accuracy for my first solve, so I&#x27;m not very
        fast but I never have DNF&#x27;d all the solves in a round. It depends
        on what you want out of your competitive solving. I&#x27;ll probably
        never set a record this way, so maybe I should take more risks. > 7)

        Hey everyone, I&#x27;m very excited right now, I just set a new personal
        best for the 4x4x4 BLD, 12 minutes 4.64 seconds. I&#x27;ve been trying
        lately to go very very very fast for both memorization and solving. At
        first my solves were horrible, horrible DNFs with stuff out of place all
        over the cube. Then as I got more used to the speed my solves turned
        into close DNFs with one or two traceable mistakes (one inner slice
        cleary one turn away from solved and 8 centers out of place). Then I
        started getting solves with just two corners left at the end (forgetting
        corner parity) or just two edges swapped (forgetting to solve edge
        parity). Well I&#x27;m glad that it finally paid off and I got a
        successful solve going full speed. For this solve I memorized in 6:15.xx
        and solved in rougly 5:49. My best ever correct memorization (I DNFd the
        solve but it was a traceable mistake) was 4:50 and the 5:49 is my new
        best successful solve time. Together they would have been a 10:39 so
        sub-10 does not seem so far away anymore. I think I can memorize yet
        faster on average and I know I can solve faster with more practice.
        Many, many, many thanks to Dror for all the inspiration you give me, and
        also for teaching me how to BLD the 3x3x3 back in 2003 and getting me
        started in the first place ;-) I seriously doubt we&#x27;ve heard the
        last of Dror on the 4x4x4 (and many others of you) but I&#x27;m glad to
        be back on top for a short while :-D Chris

        edge-cycles with UB-position and put the other two in UR and UL
        position, but here UB already was solved so i started with UF and i
        always had to do U2. i can execute the 3-edge-cycle very fast when UF
        remains and the other 3 cycle. if there is a parity i use the
        T-permutation. with R2 and L2-moves i first put the two corners in the
        upper layer and then do T. so usually UF and UB edges change places.
        then i do H (UF &lt;->UB and UR&lt;-> UL, so with the set-up move i put
        the last two edges in UR and UL position). if both corners and edges are
        already in the upper layer i use a standard PLL. questions: 1) how would
        you solve this example? 2) what is a commutator? 3) do you first
        memorize the positions and then the orientation or both at the same
        time? 4) how long are your delays between algorithms? 5) the night
        before the dutch cube day i invented the &quot;hybrid system&quot;: i
        start with cycles and if there is a problem i switch to pochmann-system.
        each system has advantages and disadvantages and i want to use the best.
        what do you think about that? thanks, thomas -- Telefonieren Sie schon

        you&#x27;re done! Total: 184 moves [wow! : )] 2) I don&#x27;t really
        know how to explain what&#x27;s a comutator, but basically is something
        like: A B A&#x27; B&#x27;. You some move sequence, then another move,
        then the inverse of the first sequence, then the inverse of the move.
        Your and my ways to do CO are both commutators. You flip one corner,
        bring another to UFR, flip that other, and move U back. That&#x27;s a
        commutator. 3) I first memorise orientations, and then permutations, in
        this order: CO, EO, CP, EP. 4) Well, I&#x27;m not a BLD master, my best
        solve is 2:30.xx, so you shouldn&#x27;t take me as a parameter. I really
        don&#x27;t know my delays between algs. If I memorise well, I can solve
        very fast, almost without delays. But if I don&#x27;t memorise properly,
        it takes some time to remember the cycles : ) 5) I never gave
        Stefan&#x27;s method a real chance, but I think it can be fast. If you
        can deal with both method, you&#x27;re lucky. Just make use of that.

        is a commutator? A commutator is a permutation of the form X Y X&#x27;
        Y&#x27; My first algorithm in the edge cycle was a commutator. U S&#x27;
        U2 S D&#x27; S&#x27; U2 S D U&#x27; Take away the U turns at the
        beginning and end, which are just a setup moves, and you get: S&#x27; U2
        S D&#x27; S&#x27; U2 S D X = S&#x27; U2 S Y = D&#x27; and put them
        together as X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27; to get (S&#x27; U2 S) (D&#x27;) (S&#x27;
        U2 S) (D) Also, looking back it would have been more efficient to have
        X=D Y=(M U2 M&#x27;) and in 2 less moves I would have had (D) (M U2
        M&#x27;) (D&#x27;) (M U2 M&#x27;) for the same cycle. Oh well,
        that&#x27;s why I need to practice more I guess. > 3) do you first

        are your delays between algorithms? Not too long, for the solve above I
        must have delayed at most 3-4 seconds between my slowest algs. I tend to

        algs most times. > 5) the night before the dutch cube day i invented the

        P.S. I tried your solve and it solved everything but left 4 of the edges
        flipped in their correct places? Either way though I mean it looks like
        a good strategy to me. Your solve felt like about the same number of alg
        executions I use, but I mean I&#x27;m no expert compared to the sub-2:00
        guys. I think the solve looks ok personally.

        Stefan&#x27;s method does this which is why it&#x27;s so fast, [...] I
        disagree :-) Yes, I do think my method is somewhat fast but not because
        of memorization (in fact, I don&#x27;t really consider memorization as
        part of &quot;my method&quot;). And only partly because I solve
        permutation and orientation at the same time. The real essential element
        is that I solve one piece at a time, making setup moves very easy,
        eliminating the need for thinking (which is the main reason my brain
        made me come up with the method, I think). Cheers! Stefan

        work out how to compress video in linux for about a year now with no

        15:41.82 and am sending it to Frank Morris and Chris Hunt (whoever gets
        it first I guess) to try to make it into less of a ridiculously huge
        file format. Hope to get this up soon, I included the memorization in
        the video (all spellbounding 8:30 minutes of it lol) and also I said
        when I had finished solving corners/edges/centers too during the solving

        really just try to treat it as a 4x4x4 with +centers and central edges.
        I memorize as Xcenters +centers wing-edges central-edge-permutation CP
        CO EO and I solve in reverse. I handle parities as, 3x3x3 corner and
        central edge parity I save for the very, very end, after solving
        Xcenters. During the 3x3x3 solve I set them up for the T permutation and
        at the very end use the alg L&#x27; U&#x27; L U L F&#x27; L2 U L U
        L&#x27; U&#x27; L F f R U&#x27; B R&#x27; U f&#x27; b&#x27; U&#x27; R
        B&#x27; U R&#x27; b to solve the cube. I handle wing-edge parity by
        saving it until I have solved the plus centers. I then setup the
        wingedges to use this move to solve them: r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2
        F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r&#x27; l d2 l&#x27; r&#x27; U r l d2 l&#x27; r&#x27;
        U&#x27; This also swaps slU&lt;->srU but I don&#x27;t care since
        I&#x27;ve already solved them, and I&#x27;m swapping indistinct pieces
        of the same color. For centers I use a set of 24 nouns to memorize the
        Xcenters and make a story. For the +centers I use another set of 24
        nouns to memorize them as a story that mimics my first set, but is
        completely non-overlapping. I really like the story method, and I like
        my nouns from the 4x4, so I just tried my best to come up with similar
        nouns that were still different enough to not let me switch stories
        during a solve. I use freestyle commutators to solve everything for the
        5x5x5, except corners where I do my regular stuff from 3x3x3 supercube
        BLD. Not sure if that is helpful, but that&#x27;s how I do it. I need to
        practice more, since I have only attempted the 5x5 4 times and got it
        successfully twice. It&#x27;s very fun, but man oh man does 25 minutes
        seem like a long ways away for me right now. Hope that helps. Again not
        sure if my method even compares to whatever you&#x27;re using, but I put
        a lot of thought into it before attempting a solve and I like doing it
        this way. I think I just need to practice more and get over my fear of
        trying to go fast during memorization. Chris

        current fastest (and only other solve) is 47:01.00. Also I just did a
        sighted 5x5x5 solve and got 12:43.92 is that good? How long does it take
        you to solve usually? Also how long does it take you to memorize? I know
        that I usually memorize in 20-25 minutes from the few solves I&#x27;ve
        done so far, so I *really* need to work on that area seeing as how
        you&#x27;ve done the whole solve that fast and I only did half. I
        remember my first solve the memorization took 29:30 ish. I mean I guess
        I can see memorizing in 12 minutes, but man you must be brave to make
        sure you will remember the cycles :-) I&#x27;m still too chicken to go
        fast heh heh, but I guess the more you do it the more used to the
        memorizing you get, so that makes sense. Anyway just curious if my solve
        time is any good, I don&#x27;t even really know the goals of what I
        should be shooting for. I know my real solve times must be double what
        my sighted solve just now was, since my real solves are full of delays.
        So I guess I should shoot for actually getting a solve in around that
        time. Chris

        Hey chris...if ur on windows then use VirtualDub to encode movies...its
        free and supports a lot of formats to export into. U can change the
        resolution, acpect ratio, bit rate...and many more things. And on linux
        u can always use mencoder ... it comes with the mplayer media player.
        Its just great! You have to learn how to use it at the start though.

        To those who orient corners first so that U/D stickers are all on U/D
        faces: Why on earth do you do that? Each corner *piece* and each corner
        *place* has a reference sticker/side/direction/whateverYouWannaCallIt. A
        *piece* is called &quot;correctly oriented&quot; iff its reference
        sticker is in the same direction as that of the *place*. Now what
        you&#x27;re doing is you define the reference directions to be all on U
        and D. What I suggest instead is to rotate all reference directions in
        the D layer clockwise. That results in these rules for &quot;correct
        orientation&quot;: - U corner in U layer must have U sticker on U face.
        - D corner in D layer must have D sticker on D face. - U corner in D
        layer must have U sticker clockwise from D face. - D corner in U layer
        must have D sticker anticlockwise from U face. The advantage of this is
        that any 3-cycle of corners that includes both U and D layers (which is
        75% of the time) is a simple 8-move commutator. Using the example Thomas
        posted... Scramble: D&#x27; B2 L B&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; D2 F2 R
        B L&#x27; B&#x27; U F R U2 F R U2 L2 D&#x27; U F&#x27; L R&#x27; B2 F2 R
        U&#x27; Orient L-corners: (U&#x27; R U R&#x27;)2 L&#x27; (U&#x27; R U

        Hey Stefan, Wow, I really like this idea. I also am starting to like
        using commutators much more often, and am starting to switch edges from
        U to D or vice versa via a commutator involving a S&#x27; U2 S or M U2
        M&#x27; type move in it. Having said that I want to give your idea a try
        since it really won&#x27;t take that much getting used to for memorizing
        corner orientation. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that now I
        can&#x27;t use the (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;)x3 move really anymore. Even
        though this move is long I&#x27;ve found that it lets me flow through
        the corner cycles very quickly (or at least it feels quickly to me,
        I&#x27;m still slower than the big names, so maybe that is my problem,
        using long moves). However, the plus side is that your way allows all
        the corner cycles to be easy commutators (which are all short!!). So I
        think I&#x27;ll have an open mind and try a few blindfold solves your
        way, I think it definitely has potential, plus I just plain like
        commutators in general ;-) Chris --- In

        I think it&#x27;s better now, right? Well, I think I do that because

        orientation pattern. I just search for the brightest stickers on the
        corners, and memorise the positions. Having U/D as reference is good for
        this, since you don&#x27;t have to check if the corner is from U or D.

        think I like the first one better since there&#x27;s not a single
        regrip. And it&#x27;s very repetitive, the right hand always goes back
        and forth every second move, and the left hand pulls U&#x27; every other
        move, except those few occasions where the right hand instead pulls U.
        Modifying them a bit you also get more nice algs: (R U&#x27; R&#x27;
        U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2)2 ((L U&#x27; L2 U) (L U&#x27; L U))2

        Hey everyone, I started thinking today, and since I do my 5x5x5 central
        edges using freestlye commutators, then why the heck do I still use
        regular speedsolve 3 cycles for the 3x3x3 BLD for edges on a hard cycle?
        I can definitely see some cases where a speedsolve move would be faster,
        but some of my cases use 2 setups moves and a x2 cube rotation, when I
        could just easily use an 8 move commutator. Stefan actually your post
        about the new way to orient the corners got me thinking about this.
        I&#x27;ve hit a plateau for the 3x3 with speedsolve 3 cycles, I want to
        try to start using my usual commutators in there for my harder cases and
        see if it helps. heh heh I like the flow of ideas on this forum,
        it&#x27;s really cool to get a new idea from someone and try to see how
        it would help. Not sure if this will work, but what&#x27;s the harm in
        trying right? Chris

        my mind again. The second alg is faster for me, it flows very well. I
        just got too confused initially because of the repetion. Hey Chris, are
        these good enough to be comparable to 3*(R B&#x27; R&#x27; B)? Cheers!

        Ok, watched it now. I guess from 7:17 to 8:33 it&#x27;s not putting on
        the blindfold :-) Hey, from 12:18 to 12:30 that&#x27;s a parity fix I
        guess? Cause all of a sudden you&#x27;re twisting like a madman there...
        Great achievement and great video, thanks!! Maybe you&#x27;ve motivated
        me enough now to try 4x4, too... Cheers! Stefan

        To permute the corners you can use: R B&#x27; R F2 R&#x27; B R F2 R2 (or

        adjacent corner, 2 by 2, like: L U&#x27; R D2 R&#x27; U L&#x27; R

        and you should! If you can do the megaminx BLD, which still scares me
        btw :-P then you can definitely do the 4x4 in some low times. It just
        took getting through the DNFs when first trying to go fast to get my

        I don&#x27;t exactly remember what it was. Not a 404 or connection
        problem. It was a yahoo group special error message, something like
        &quot;we don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re coming from&quot;. Maybe it
        had to do with me opening two posts in different windows, then click
        &quot;reply&quot; on both, then had to log into both, then wrote and
        submitted both replies. So maybe it got confused between the separate
        windows and the logging in. No idea. If it ever happens again, I&#x27;ll
        let you know. Now something slightly more interesting again: I&#x27;ve
        tried your edge-3-cycle-freeystyle again (sighted), I&#x27;m nowhere
        near your times but I&#x27;m getting better, now around 6 minutes and
        fewer errors. But I&#x27;m also trying to improve my own method, solving
        one edge at a time with the buffer/helper idea. The old way is setup the
        goal to FUr, apply the 3-cycle &quot;swap&quot; with 10 moves, then undo
        the setup moves. I&#x27;m trying without setup moves and 8-move 3-cycle
        &quot;swaps&quot; now. I&#x27;ll let you know once I have some results
        (right now I&#x27;m still defining the algs). Cheers! Stefan --- In

        did another sighted average with my 4x4x4 BLD edges method. I did it the
        way we did before, I solved the centers and corners as referrence
        points, but I still solved parity as if the centers were unsolved, same
        as I regularly do. 1:54.45 1:57.50 1:44.42 1:47.78 1:58.41 2:02.82
        1:39.90 (2:13.49) 2:07.03 1:38.44 1:54.39 (1:28.94) = 1:52.51 I&#x27;m
        glad that I&#x27;ve gotten faster, but I&#x27;m still inconsistent with
        a 44.55 second spread. Ending with lots of odd cycles is faster for me
        but still slow. I still use the (ABC) followed by (ADC) method to solve
        all but the last if there is parity and I only ever use that terrible
        parity alg once a solve, and then only if there is parity obviously.
        Again I would like to stress that this was a sighted average and that I
        don&#x27;t go quite that fast on real solves, since part of my time is
        spent on recall and I can&#x27;t transition from one cycle to the next
        as fast as with my eyes open. I think I still average pretty close to
        1.0 for the setup moves. Again often I do just one, sometimes I do 2 and
        just about as often as 2 I do none. I use all the types of commutators
        before that I was like &quot;Oh man I need to learn that!&quot; so I
        have a pretty varied toolbelt to draw from now that I am also very used
        to using. I personally really like this method, since it uses so many
        fewer moves, and if practiced can be done quickly. However your method
        uses less thought than mine by design and if it were equally as
        practiced and with your dexterity for alg execution, I think it could
        probably be equally as fast. I&#x27;m going to say that BLD for edges is
        probably fast with either method if practiced well enough, so I
        don&#x27;t find one better than the other. I hope your method works out
        as well as freestyle cycles, it feels awesome to use your own idea. I
        don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m the first to try freestyle cycles, but I
        think even if it has been invented that I have added my own personal
        touch to it. Just for that reason I like using my own personal version
        of it and will most likely just try to improve it. > > Cheers! > Stefan
        Happy cubing, and god luck with your method! I hope it turns out to be
        fast! Chris

        Yes, you don&#x27;t &quot;need&quot; to, but you *can*, because there
        are so few possibilities. Also, for edges every setup alg appears about

        Hey everyone, I have some questions for the 5x5x5 BLD if you all
        don&#x27;t mind. I got another 5x5x5 BLD solve successfully today (which
        I am very happy about!) and did it in 47:45.55. But my question is, it
        still takes me forever to memorize and to solve compared to what I feel
        I should be doing. I tend to memorize the 4x4 in anywhere from low 5
        minutes to high 7 minutes, so theoretically if I memorize the 4x4x4
        within the 5x5x5 in 7 minutes say, then I should theoretically memorize
        the +centers in 3 minutes and the central edges in 1:00 more I should be
        done memorizing by 11:00-12:00 minutes, somewhere around there. Well my
        solve today took me 23:22 to memorize. Marcus did his entire solve in
        only about a minute and a half more so clearly I am wasting a whole lot
        of time somewhere. I still feel scared to go too fast for the 5x5x5 for
        both memorizing and solving. Getting 45-50 minutes of quiet time to sit
        down and memorize and solve without being disturbed is sort of rare for
        me. Should I just try to get over this by going fast and just work
        through the initial DNFs? That was my strategy with the 4x4 pretty much,
        go slow at first to get used to the method, then when I felt I had an ok
        grasp of it I started to purposefully go really fast. I had to work
        through long strings of DNFs but eventually I got to where that faster
        pace turned into my normal pace and my accuracy came back. Should I do
        this with the 5x5x5 too? Marcus how did you get so incredibly fast at
        this? I mean I can see how the theory (11-12 min for memorization and
        11-12 min for the solve) can get to your time, now I just need to get
        rid of my tremendous number of delays. Dror, how do you memorize and
        solve so fast? I&#x27;m still a good 10 minutes at least from your
        solving times and don&#x27;t know how to whittle that time away. Thanks
        in advance for any help, Chris

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve recently started working on this, and have
        gotten a successful BLD centers solve with it so far. I just got a 13:09
        DNF (grrrrr), but my mistake was in the edges and I was only off by 3
        edges in a cycle. For the centers I used a new approach and it worked
        and they were solved. Normally I always cycle a center to my next
        highest priority spot on the given face (each of the four spots has a
        rank, and I can tell which spots I am at when I cycle back to that face
        based on the last noun I&#x27;ve used in that category). Well this time
        I had a nice *almost* block transposition, so rather than have to cycle
        all of those pieces around and waste the opportunity, I used my center
        cycles to create the block transposition and then solved it at the end.
        This shortened my main centers cycles by 3 pieces, which sped up my
        memorization considerably. Basically what I did was this, if I had had a
        green center at dfL I would have been able to do the block cycle (dbL +
        dfL) &lt;-> (dlF + drF). So instead of cycling all those wrong pieces
        once the priority got there on that face I cycled my first green piece
        to dfL and created that block cycle. I then pretended the two blocks
        were solved for the rest of my centers cycle. During the solve, I did
        the whole main centers cycle first, then at the very end finished with:
        [u (lr)2 u&#x27;, L2] I have used this strategy before if the blocks
        were already built, but I have never changed my centers cycles in order
        to setup a block cycle until now. I think this is a great trick to speed
        up memorization for the 4x4x4, I didn&#x27;t check the time but it felt
        much faster than usual since I had to create 3 less additions to my
        story with the nouns. Anyway, I post this since I think it is an awesome
        trick to use for the 4x4x4 centers, and I will definitely be using this
        in the future. Hope this helps for you other 4x4x4 BLD&#x27;ers, Chris

        Hello all... I&#x27;ve been here for a while, lurking, listening to your
        interesting discussions... but I haven&#x27;t actually tried to learn
        BLD until recently. Could someone help me out? I&#x27;ve read two or
        three blindfold manuals, but I&#x27;ve still got a bunch of problems: 1)
        I haven&#x27;t found a decent method for memorizing corner permutation
        (note: I&#x27;m not a visual learner, I need #s). Could someone supply
        one? 2) I&#x27;m not familiar with Fridrich, so could someone provide an
        explanation (or an algorithm) for the edge/corner permutation parity
        switch other than &quot;use the T perm&quot; (what is that?!?)? 3) How
        do I keep track of setup moves? I keep messing up the entire thing (and

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been thinking about block centers cycling all
        day, and tonight I purposefully did it on a solve where I normally
        wouldn&#x27;t do anything special. Man it works well! I just got a
        successful 12:04.48 4x4x4 BLD solve using it too! Again I created two
        clocks to be cycled at the very end for the centers. If I had had a blue
        center piece at frU I would have had the group cycle (frU +
        brU)&lt;->(urB+drB). So instead of cycling through the pieces like I
        usually do I cycled my first blue piece in the cycle to frU and at the
        very end of my centers solve I ended with [l&#x27; (fb)2 l, B2] to solve
        the cube. What makes this technique so nice is that it really speeds up
        the centers memorization, and the solving goes a lot faster, since I
        cycle 4 pieces to their correct spot in 1 commutator. The memorization
        for this solve took 5:25 (a very good time for me usually, so this shows
        how block memorizing helps) and the solve was about 6:40 which is also a
        very good solve for me too. This is definitely my new method and I will
        try to actively search for ways to form these blocks on every solve. If
        you have a row of two same colored centers on the wrong face, then all
        you have to do is to create a block on the face where it belongs and you
        have a block cycle. Wow this technique rocks! I want to turn it into a
        common approach rather than a trick to be used every now and then if
        possible. Has anyone else tried it yet? It really does work nicely!

        help out some. For corner permutation you can use the numbers 1-8. You
        could have a scheme such that say UBL=1 UBR=2 UFR=3 UFL=4 DBL=5 DBR=6
        DFR=7 DFL=8 or of course any scheme you want. That works quite well for
        helping memorize. The scheme I use when I use numbers is this UBL=1
        UBR=2 UFL=3 UFR=4 DBL=5 DBR=6 DFL=7 DFR=8 > 2) I&#x27;m not familiar

        algorithm that swaps two corners and two edges. The common one is the
        &quot;T-perm&quot; which is R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R2 U&#x27;

        too. This way you use your auditory memory to help you remember them. So
        if my moves are F2 U then a three cycle, I&#x27;ll say &quot;F2 U&quot;
        as I do the moves, and while doing the 3 cycle I think F2 U F2 U F2

        2) flip the corner using either (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;) or
        (R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R) depending on which direction it goes

        sufficiently slowly and solved as carefully as possible, but I wanted to

        is several hours, I just want to have done it. So far my biggest BLD

        Based on my experience with memorizing stuff, I&#x27;d say to memorize
        the largest cube first (if you do it last it can mess up the smaller
        ones&#x27; memories) and to associate each cube with a separate idea. If
        you&#x27;re into stories, you should make the 5x5x5 story about a
        specific topic, the 4x4x4 about a different topic, etc. so you
        won&#x27;t confuse which story goes with which cube. After you&#x27;ve
        gone through all of the cubes once to memorize them, you should probably
        go over everything again to make sure you know it. --qqwref

        Hey Chris, It&#x27;s cool that you&#x27;re going for a relay --
        they&#x27;re a lot of fun. The trick is not to care about time, but
        memory. Even if you&#x27;re fast at normal BLD, I learned that the same
        methods tend to break down in the long-term framework. You need separate
        memorization methods. Instead of relying on visual clues and brute-force
        memory (things which are effective for quick solves but inherently
        ineffective for a solve that may not be done for an hour or two after
        memorization), you should use methods that allow for information to be
        extracted. The easiest example I can tell you is, again, the Binary
        method for memorizing edge orientations (you can also get away with
        using it for corner orientations!). A simple three-word phrase is very
        easy to remember and will not be difficult to recall, even if you do the
        cube a day later after memorizing it, haha. Slow and steady! Basically,
        you need to memorize your cubes using such methods, and then memorize
        them again to *ensure* you won&#x27;t have any memory mixups. If you can
        honestly say to yourself, &quot;I could walk away from these cubes, come
        back in a few hours, and still be able to solve them blindfolded,&quot;
        then you are good to go. Otherwise you may run into some trouble. The
        most cubes I&#x27;ve ever done was around 7 I think (different cubes
        though). Here is my general experience: Don&#x27;t fret the 2x2x2 so
        much, as it&#x27;s just a 3x3x3 without the edges anyway (ie. 3x3x3
        corner permutation and corner orientation methods are still sufficient.
        The 2x2x2, using memory hooks, can be simplified to six words). Your
        experience with 3x3x3 solving shouldn&#x27;t give you much trouble. The
        real challenge comes in memorizing the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. I REALLY
        recommend doing the cubes from largest from smallest. The larger cubes
        are much harder to memorize using &quot;data- derivation&quot; methods
        like the 3x3x3 Binary approach, and therefore they rely more on memory
        in the short-term. I tried solving a big cube last one time and found
        that I had forgotten virtually half of the layout when I got to it!
        Solving the 5x5x5 and 4x4x4 first will take care of the short-term
        memory issues, and you&#x27;ll still have your memory hooks ready for
        the smaller cubes like the 3x3x3 and 2x2x2. This may seem really
        obvious, but make sure you know what cube you&#x27;re picking up if
        you&#x27;re doing multiple cubes of the same type (eg. two
        3x3x3&#x27;s). You don&#x27;t want to pick up the second cube thinking
        it&#x27;s the first. The first time you try a relay, you might, like me,
        find that ALL of them end up as DNF&#x27;s... don&#x27;t be upset if
        this happens :P Solving relays is a little different than solving cubes
        individually. Just make sure your memory tricks are strong and you can
        start doing more and more without too much extra strain.

        Hi Chris, I&#x27;ve only tried this once so my level of experience
        isn&#x27;t all that high but ... I found that memorizing all the
        &#x27;big cube specific&#x27; information was surprisingly easy. i.e. I
        had no trouble at all with either memorizing or recalling the long
        center and edge cycles for the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. Admittedly I invested a
        lot of time on them but they presented no significant obstacle. When it
        came to solving my biggest concern was with what is arguably the easiest
        stage - OC and PC. Not that it was alll that difficult but that there
        were so many of them so they were potentially easier to intermingle and
        since they are so short and so simple I found I invested a lot less time
        on them in the actual memorization process. I would agree with Marcus
        that it would be advisable to go an extra step and invent a word / story
        trigger for them just to be sure that you have them. And finally - RELAX
        ! Given everything else you can do on a cube this is well within your
        abilities. Go slow, be patient. Be extra careful when undoing set up
        moves. This one is not a race so GO SLOW and enjoy a patient, methodical
        solve. This one is yours for the taking. Best of luck, Rob --- kyuubree

        Hey, I would also like to emphasize that your times speed up when you do
        not worry about time. Any mental energy spent towards worrying about
        speed will only detract from the task at hand and cause potential memory
        mixups. To start out just go for completion, no matter how long it
        takes. After you approach relays this way for a while, your times will
        speed up whether or not you are actually trying to go faster.

        How long do you need to solve the 3x3 edges, sighted but using your
        blindsolving method? I.e. same thing as Chris and I recently did with
        4x4, now with 3x3. Cheers! Stefan

        Cheers! > Stefan Ok... I have finished preparing the scrambles. I
        generated random cube states with a Java program and fed them into Cube
        Explorer&#x27;s Web Server interface. The task now is only permuting the
        edges. Corners are solved. And edges are oriented according to
        &lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2>. If you&#x27;re used to &lt;U, D,L2,R2,F,B> then just
        do y before scrambling. I&#x27;d be very interested especially in Tyson,
        Leyan, Macky &amp; Co, i.e. the very fast guys who have EP as one of
        their four steps. But everybody else is of course invited, too :-) Oh,
        almost forgot: no inspection, i.e. you start right after scrambling. Now

        Hey Stefan, Here is my average. Although I solve like Tyson and Leyan
        and crew I would venture to guess that this is still a bad average for
        cycles+orient first if you are shooting for sub-2 solving. All the 30+
        times were solves where I had to end with two odd cycles and use either
        the Z or H perm and LOTS of setup moves. The 25.84 also ended in a Z but
        had easy setup moves. I need to work on ending with parity, since
        corner+edge parity trips me up just as much. (22.55) 26.64 24.77 28.58
        29.18 38.87 45.03 32.47 37.49 (46.94) 25.84 23.56 = 31.24 Chris --- In

        I&#x27;m getting better at it. Going to generate more scrambles, can
        post them if someone is interested... Cheers! Stefan

        Hey Stefan, Two more averages here: Scrambles 25-36 35.41 28.87 32.29
        32.26 30.09 20.87 (38.99) 29.45 (20.51) 28.52 24.45 32.80 = 29.50
        Scrambles 37-48 25.24 (41.02) 36.39 33.34 30.58 15.63 24.43 22.73 39.89
        (13.99) 31.34 26.35 = 28.59 Still can&#x27;t get as fast as you on
        average heh heh, my slow times are really quite slow, but my fastest was
        13.99 with a 15.63 second fastest. This showed me that ending with two
        odd edge cycles is a *very* bad ending for me, I need to learn new ways
        to do this. I may just go with my 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 BLD strategy of (ABC)
        then (ADC) to solve (AB)(CD) rather than try to solve all at once with a
        Z or H permutation. If you generate more scrambles I will definitely do
        more averages, I need to work on this as well. Chris --- In

        Stefan, No my time is below average -- for some reason I had edge
        orientations to take care of. Perhaps I executed the scramble
        incorrectly or we use different systems for which two sides to treat as
        dual-spins only.

        Stefan, After doing this exercise of timing 3x3x3 edges I think I know
        how a sub-2 is possible for me. Me memorization is always 1:10-1:30 so
        in order to get a sub-2 I need to memorize in 1:00-1:10 (so go a little
        fast for me, but not so much so as to forget the info) and to solve at
        absolutely *break-neck* speed (for me). That way if I do get a sub-20 or
        low 2x.xx EP and a fast CP, and CO and EO do not require setup moves,
        then I can get a sub-2 solve overall. In fact I got a 1:58.xx DNF where
        I messed up the CP near the end, but still the time was fast enough to
        be sub-2 had I done it correctly. I can&#x27;t get my memory as fast as
        Tyson and crew (and Marcus you also have an impressive memory to me) so
        I have to overcome it with solving extra, extra quickly in order to try
        for sub-2. I already did 4-5 solves in a row and am having a hard time
        forgetting my previous solves, so I&#x27;ll give it a break and try
        again in a little while. I think I could realistically get sub-2 very
        soon if everything goes well on one solve. Before I didn&#x27;t even see
        how it would be possible but now I know. Aaaaaah so excited, I want
        sub-2 so badly!! :-D Chris

        Very nice, thanks a lot! I like the short 3-cycles everywhere,
        especially the first one with no setup moves. Do you work with S-slice
        only? I tried finding something shorter for your 4th step, for example
        this would work: (U&#x27; F U) F E&#x27; F2 E F (U&#x27; F&#x27; U)

        Hey Marcus, How fast do you memorize and solve usually? I&#x27;ve been
        working on memorizing a lot lately and have improved, but I still have
        plateaud off at 1:10-1:20. It seems reasonable to me that I could solve
        in less than 50 seconds sometimes so I am working on my solving to try
        for sub-2 (even once in a while would be more than awesome to me). You
        have to give us regular guys a goal lol, what should I shoot for when it
        comes to my solving phase? I just broke my 3x3x3 BLD record by half a
        second, so apparently trying to solve *incredibly* fast (for me) still
        lets me get successful solves, and now my new best time even. I got a
        2:11.06 which has me very excited (not all that great compared to you
        though). My breakdown was probably 1:10 to memorize since it felt fast
        for me and 1:01.06 to solve. Again still not great, but if I can get the
        solving down by 10 more seconds I can hope for a sub-2 solve once in a
        while. Still it&#x27;s disheartening to know that at my very best
        I&#x27;m still 20-30 seconds slower for each step probably than what the
        best do (you, Tyson, Leyan, Macky, etc..) *sigh* one day, one day. I
        refuse to believe I&#x27;m not capable, I&#x27;m just a slow learner
        lol. Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hey Stefan, That move would be great too :P Certainly shorter. I just
        tend to stick with things that rely on my right hand because I am not
        very good with using both, doing intricate moves all over. I tend to
        stick with R, S, and U moves if I can because they take very little time
        for me (like, I could do a 10-move algorithm with those moves more
        quickly than a 7-move algorithm that might have an L, B, or D thrown in
        there). Like there was a 3-cycle move that went like: R&#x27; U2 R&#x27;
        U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R2 U R U R2 (11 moves), something like this
        takes maybe 2-3 seconds for me, but sometimes I can use a shorter
        algorithm: R2 U S&#x27; U2 S U R2 (7 moves), takes only like 1.5-2
        seconds, assuming my crappy cube cooperates (it locks up a LOT) Now
        something like R2 U R2 F&#x27; B U2 F B&#x27; U&#x27; R2 is 10 moves
        long, one move shorter than the first alg posted, but it takes me a lot
        longer. Usually short algs that use R S U are the best for me.

        Oh my God!!!!!!!! 1:56.73!! Wow, I didn&#x27;t think I would get one
        this soon, but I&#x27;m happy! Memorization took 5x.xx seconds, not sure
        which second in the 50&#x27;s, but the tenth digit was a 5 and it was
        definitely sub-min. I ended with two odd cycles during the EP but it was
        alright becuase it only required 1 setup move (one of my rare ok times
        that I can handle that quickly). Also I ended the corners with (UBL DBR)
        (UFR DFL) and just did it as (ABC) then (ADC) rather than something with
        weird setup moves to finish in one algorithm. Yay! I&#x27;m so happy to
        finally have done it! I still don&#x27;t see how you guys do 30 seconds
        faster than that. I have so much left to learn heh heh. Chris

        up the permuting algorithms into &quot;groups&quot; like, an alg for two
        adjacent edges with an edge on the D layer, etc. For 4 and 5 cycles I
        tend to use them only when the edges are on U and D (otherwise it gets
        too messy for me and it takes too long to figure out when I could just
        take care of it with two shorter cycles instead of longer algorithms).
        Say my cycle was (UF DL DF UR). Looks a little ugly, but with some easy
        setup moves, I can just execute a &quot;4-cycle two-adjacent-U-layer
        2-adjacent D layer&quot; algorithm: Such an algorithm in this case, I
        tend to keep things on the F and R faces. I would do a D to get
        everything lined up. From here, you have to think about what needs to go
        where, because in four-cycles, there are different ways to cycle such
        things). In this case, I call this algorithm a
        &quot;QuadCounterClock&quot; because the pieces cycle in a
        visually-counterclockwise format. My different algs for 2- adjacent U
        and D consist of QuadCounterClock, QuadClock, QuadVerticalBow1 and 2,
        QuadHorizontalBow1 and 2, etc. It may seem like a lot but it&#x27;s
        around the same difficulty as memorizing OLL. There are only so many
        cases you can get with 4-cycles on the U and D layer. Anyway in this
        case, I would use a QuadCounterClock (setup D) R2 F&#x27; D&#x27;
        F&#x27; D R2 F2 R2 F&#x27; D&#x27; F D F&#x27; (unsetup D&#x27;) Such an
        alg, you can see, is VERY easy to do with the right hand alone
        (something I have to have). Now, most of my algs in the 4- cycle range I
        set up such that the UFL and UFR corners switch. If I can somehow get
        the already-incorrect corners in those spots, great. Otherwise I just
        remember that those two are switched and deal with the rest of the cube
        accordingly. Depending on where the bad corners are, there are methods
        you can apply to figure out how the numbers change when you switch these
        two corners. I tend to not use 4/5 edge cyclers unless it&#x27;s
        painfully obvious, though. Sometimes it is just quicker to do a
        three-cycle and then fix the parity issue.

        Chris, Wow! Congratulations! It shows you are DEFINITELY capable -- as
        with 3x3x3 speedsolving, the more algorithms you know, and the more you
        practice, the easier it will all become. I&#x27;m sure you can do the
        Sune without giving it a second thought -- you just need to treat
        blindfolding the same way, doing things until they become reflexive and
        you don&#x27;t need much extra time to think about it. I think your
        execution times are wonderful and that you can cut a lot of time off
        with memory. For example, memorizing corner orientation: 2-5 seconds
        Memorizing corner permutations: 3-8 seconds Memorizing edge
        orientations: 2-3 seconds Memorizing edge permutations: I think 8-10
        seconds is safe here So at the very best I could do maybe a 15 second
        memorization of the cube, with an upper threshold of around 26-30
        seconds. Sometimes it takes even more time if you have ugly parity
        issues or particularly long cycles (which in many cases can be cut down
        with 4/5 cycles to compensate for memorization time in order to equalize
        the averages). Solving takes me about a minute or so, give or take
        depending on the easiness of the cases.

        All right, so I wasn&#x27;t able to do 12 solves in a row. Because the
        orientation isn&#x27;t correct, I stopped the timer a few times before
        actually finishing it, but it seems to me that sub-25 isn&#x27;t too
        hard. With practice, sub-20 is doable. The problem for me right now is
        that I&#x27;m not very good with looking ahead. In other words, the
        cycle ABC, check the spot C wants to go to D, look in spot D to get
        ready for the next cycle while you do ABC. This is certainly a good
        exercise for reviewing how to do every cycle though. I&#x27;ll work on
        it a bit more later. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        thanks. Is there some understandable idea behind this, too? The 3-cycles
        tend to be easy understandable commutators, but I don&#x27;t see yet how
        to explain this one. It&#x27;s not a must, but if possible I prefer to
        use algs I understand, cause then they&#x27;re often flexible and I can
        modify them for different situations without having to use extra setup
        moves. Also, how about this instead: R L F L2 E&#x27; L2 F&#x27; L&#x27;
        R&#x27; Yeah I know, different side effect (centers instead of
        corners)... but still nice and short :-) Cheers! Stefan

        thread subject :-) Of course it&#x27;s also not perfectly correct
        anymore. When I started it, I was doing edge permutation and orientation
        at the same time. Then I discovered a beautiful improvement of my method
        if I orient first, and practiced that. I&#x27;ll go back to perm+orient
        now, cause I&#x27;d like to give it the same chances as
        permutation-only. Now that I have a good method to generate certain
        scrambles it&#x27;ll be much more fun than before. I often got the edges
        in 40 seconds, peaks were around 25 seconds. Maybe 30 on average is
        possible for me. Btw, how many &quot;steps&quot; (e.g. a 3-cycle with
        setup moves) do you usually need? I estimate about 12 for me, will do a
        computer simulation to find out, maybe I&#x27;ll also do it for
        3-cycles... Cheers! Stefan

        Hi Stefan, For permutation of the edges? Well, keep in mind these are
        easier because the corners are correct so no corner/edge parity. Anyway,
        uh... maybe 5 cycles? If the cycle length is 11, then you have 5 cycles
        right? Parity plays into it as well, but I think a mathematician out
        there should be able to calculate the average number of
        &quot;cycles&quot; necessary. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        this has come up, I have a math question. How many ways are there to
        group N objects into groups? For example if I have 10 objects, I can
        have all objects in one group, 5 objects in two separate groups, 1
        object each in 10 separate groups, 5 groups with 2 objects each, etc..
        This problem leads into how many unique cycles can be made of either the
        corners or edges? Chris

        trying to measure? In BLD, you won&#x27;t attempt the same solution you
        would for a sighted BLD solve. For example, in dealing with even cycles
        during sighted BLD, I would be looking for another even cycle to pair up
        with it, but in BLD, I would have already found it in my memorization.
        If you wanted to measure just the EP step of the BLD solution, you would
        want to allow some inspection time to memorize the edges first. Leyan

        maybe allowing some inspection would be better. I was trying to find out
        how long execution of EP takes people. But you&#x27;re right, in real
        blindsolves you&#x27;d have less decisions/planning during executions.
        On the other hand, it does count to your overall time anyway. On the
        other other hand, I guess it overlaps with memorizing, i.e. while
        you&#x27;re planning your brain is already working with it and
        you&#x27;re memorizing at the same time. That&#x27;s maybe a crucial
        difference between us. I don&#x27;t plan as much, I mainly react. I made
        50 more scrambles, but they&#x27;re all a special case. They&#x27;re all
        one long 11-cycle with the UB edge solved. For me that&#x27;s the nicest
        case except being more lucky with more solved edges. It&#x27;s always 10
        steps for me, and my brain can go auto-pilot. I started slowly but got
        faster at the end, best average was 19.51 seconds: 19.86 19.70 20.33
        20.31 18.79 18.97 19.88 (18.24) 18.78 (20.44) 19.36 19.09 Overall I had
        one DNF and average of the other 49 was 21.00 seconds. Here are the

        Hey Stefan, Ok after reading your question I definitely started to doubt
        my answer. I got my old textbook out from my combinatorics class and
        read up on Catalan numbers and Bell numbers (the sequence you
        mentioned). I think here is what I was thinking when I said I thought
        the Catalan numbers counted the number of cycles. I was thinking the
        interpretation of the Catalan numbers that they count the number of ways
        to multiply n elements assuming the commutative property doesn&#x27;t
        hold. But the problem with that is that it doesn&#x27;t allow the
        permutations as if all the elements were in 1 set. However, the Bell
        numbers count the number of ways to put the edge pieces into groups of
        varying sizes (so cycles), and then we would still need to permute the
        cycles for each grouping scheme. So yeah I agree that the Catalan
        numbers don&#x27;t do the trick. Let me see if I understand this
        correct. B(4) = 15 so does that count the sets as below? (1234)
        (1)(2)(3)(4) (12)(3)(4) (13)(2)(4) (14)(2)(3) (23)(1)(4) (24)(1)(3)
        (34)(1)(2) (123)(4) (124)(3) (134)(2) (234)(1) (12)(34) (13)(24)
        (14)(23) If I did that correctly then I agree that this sequence would
        better apply to the cube. Wow, that brings up another question, but I
        think I already have an answer. B(12)=4213597 and B(8)=4140 but you
        don&#x27;t have to go through and permute the cycles in each of these
        types? You would just count the number of possible permutations for each
        group? So for example you could assume that the parity is odd and say
        that the edges have 12!/2 permutations, which would mean that there are
        12!/2 different cycles of edges with odd parity? Also there would be
        12!/2 with even parity so 12! total. The same process gives 8! for
        corners. So would we say that there are B(8) and B(12) unique ways to
        form cycles of the corners and edges respectively, but 8! and 12! unique
        cycles after permuting the pieces in each group counted by the Bell
        sequence? If that is the case I don&#x27;t know why I was thinking this
        problem was so hard. I do find it interesting that there are 4 213 597
        ways to group the edges into cycles, I had no idea it would be that
        many. Sorry for the rambling, I&#x27;m thinking out loud about this
        number sequence, since it&#x27;s new to me ;-) Chris --- In

        Ok so I know it hasn&#x27;t been released to the general public yet, but
        does anyone else have plans to tackle this beast? I&#x27;ve been
        thinking about how I want to go about it, and here are my ideas.
        Memorization: I have two groups of 24 nouns that are non-overlapping,
        and I was thinking of using them to handle both Xcenter orbits (I&#x27;m
        thickheaded, is that the correct word?). For the other two center orbits
        I will use numbers 1-24 and the letters A-X to form short words or
        sentences. For the edges I am thinking that I will just memorize the
        shapes of cycles, but try to view the innermost orbit as always being in
        a narrow/small context and the outer ones as being in a wide/full
        context. Solving: I think actually executing [l[2] u[2]&#x27; l[2]&#x27;
        , U] might present some issues, anyone have any ideas? I was thinking it
        might be better to not do any multi-layer turns and just turn inner
        faces, to ease any problems of overturning or forgetting whether or not
        you did a multi-layer turn? Or maybe the cube won&#x27;t be that stable?
        I guess we can&#x27;t answer this until someone tries out a 6x6x6 cube.
        Also, can we do this? I issue this challenge to anyone wanting to do a
        6x6x6. Solve a 4x4x4 BLD, and a 5x5x5 BLD (except the corners, and
        central edges) and the centers of one more 4x4x4 BLD and time it. This
        will give you 4 center orbits, 2 edge oribts, and the corners of an even
        cube. It&#x27;s not an exact match obviously since two center orbits on
        the 6x6x6 are neither Xcenters or +centers in nature, but I guess
        it&#x27;s close enough. Can we try to come up with a formal way for
        doing this so as to standardize our attempts? I would love to see what
        the times for a 6x6x6 will be like, and if anyone is willing to try with
        me, I say we start practicing so that when the real one gets here we
        will have an idea of how to handle this beast. Just some ideas, hope
        there are some takers. Chris

        I know this won&#x27;t be doing a real 6x6x6, and whoever does this
        weird hybrid relay I would not agree is the first to do a 6x6x6, but
        still I would like to try a simulated 6x6x6 solve using 2 4x4&#x27;s and
        a 5x5. I just wanted to ask for a standardization of this hybrid relay
        so if anyone else tries it we all have some basis of comparison. What I
        suggest is this, the 4 center orbits will be the center orbits of the
        two 4x4&#x27;s and the center orbits of the 5x5. The corners will be the
        corners of one of the 4x4&#x27;s, and the edges will come from the edges
        of one of the 4x4&#x27;s and the edges of the 5x5. I suggest this over
        having both edge orbits taken up from the 4x4&#x27;s since the edge
        orbits are of different widths from the center of a face on the 6x6, and
        doing edges on the 4x4 and 5x5 would make it feel like that. It&#x27;s
        not a perfect match obviously, but if we can set a standard for the
        &quot;fake 6x6&quot; then I would like to try it. I don&#x27;t think
        that anyone doing the fake 6x6 can claim the real 6x6, since the center
        orbits behave different on a 6x6, plus it&#x27;s just not the same as a
        real 6x6 period. But it&#x27;s close, and I&#x27;d like to go ahead and
        get my brain used to thinking that hard before the real one comes out.

        that someone should see if they can find the old Oinkleburger applet (or

        Hey everyone, I have a math question. I know this came up on the yahoo
        group a while back, but after lots of searching I couldn&#x27;t really
        find it. What was ever decided on the general definition of whether an
        edge is flipped or not? And I mean the general definition, not
        restricting two opposite faces to only double turns and defining flips
        from there. The reason I ask, it seems odd to me that if I restrict R
        and L to only double turns as my definition of which edges are flipped,
        then doing the turn R from a solved cube results in four flipped edges.
        But if I restrict F and B in my mind, doing the turn R from solved
        leaves all 12 edges correctly oriented. The only thing that has changed
        is my perception of the cube, so clearly our definition isn&#x27;t a
        general one. Again I know this has been discussed before, but I
        didn&#x27;t remember the result, and couldn&#x27;t find the old posts
        about it. The other part of this question is, when two people with
        different edge flip schemes get a scramble, do they have the same number
        of edges flipped in EO? My guess is not always, and I site the above as
        my counter-example. Thanks, Chris

        I&#x27;m doing :-). What I&#x27;m doing is maybe what you think I&#x27;m
        doing, but I developed it further. And I reduced it a bit for fun to see
        how that would be. That&#x27;s how I permute those 11-edge-cycles one
        edge at a time in 10 steps under 20 seconds, i.e. less than 2 seconds
        for recognition+setup+alg+setdown on sustained average. Oh, that sounded
        cool :-) What *are* you thinking I&#x27;m doing? Maybe your thoughts
        differ from mine and lead to yet another method? Cheers! Stefan

        Remember my recent idea to choose different reference directions for the
        D-corner orientations? It&#x27;s your own choice. I think it&#x27;s
        really a good idea to think in terms of reference directions. You can
        see another example for edges in that physics paper Edgardo posted two
        days or so. With that reference scheme, *every* quarter turn
        &quot;flips&quot; four edges. Cheers! Stefan

        Chris, Really, at the core, edges are either oriented or not oriented
        relative to each other. There is no &quot;absolutely oriented or
        nonoriented&quot; edge. Therefore, you simply must use algs that take
        care of &quot;relative cases&quot;, and this is the quickest way to get
        things to where they belong (if your intent is to do multiple things at
        once or understand how to permute without caring about orientation). In
        short, I don&#x27;t think there is a much quicker way than simply
        restricting sides, but you&#x27;ll find with time that this is hardly an
        obstacle with the right algorithms. I hope I&#x27;ve understood your
        question correctly.

        Stefan, Ah, you are right about that first point. Hmm. My point though
        was, is that there are many perspectives -- what is oriented to one
        person&#x27;s method may not be for another. Therefore, perhaps there is
        a lot less work we need to do in terms of orienting. As for the second,
        I did not mean &quot;not caring&quot; about orientation, but rather
        moves that &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; about avoiding double-turning
        certain opposite sides. For example, instead of figuring out how to
        permute three oriented edges, maybe it would help to have a permute move
        such that the &quot;middle edge&quot; in the permute cycle is not
        oriented. Just an example of what I meant. --- In

        differ from > mine and lead to yet another method? Heh heh I was
        thinking along the same lines as your 4x4x4 BLD method for edges. You
        could have three pieces in the U layer, one as buffer, then the other
        piece that moves back and forth in the U layer, and the place where you
        always setup edges. This way you could choose your setup moves to take
        care of orientation as well, giving only 20 ways to setup edges (10
        edges to choose from and 2 ways to place each edge to take care of
        orientation too), which is pretty much the same as the number of setup
        moves your 4x4 method requires. You would have to handle the orientation
        and placement of the one edge that moves back and forth, but I suppose
        solving it first could take care of that. Again I&#x27;m just guessing
        here, not sure if this would work for that second buffer edge. I mean it
        sounds sort of like you might be doing this? That is what first came
        into my head when you said that. What *are* you doing in fact? (if
        it&#x27;s not secret of course) :-) > > Cheers! > Stefan > Chris

        I thought about that edge orientation scheme from the physics paper
        again. The one where every quarter turn flips the four edges involved.
        It&#x27;s cool, since it treats all faces equally! Now take this
        3-cycle: M&#x27; U M U2 M&#x27; U M You can apply this 3-cycle
        *everywhere*, on every face from every angle. It preserves orientation
        everywhere. Cheers! Stefan

      <strong>168. Stirling numbers of the second kind</strong><br />
      <em>From:</em> &quot;cmhardw&quot; &lt;foozman17@...&gt;<br />

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, Ok, so I&#x27;m learning about Stirling numbers of the
        second kind for the first time. These numbers are really cool for
        determining the types of cycles you can have on the cubes. So for
        example, say we have 12 pieces (edges on the 3x3) and I want to know how
        many ways we can group those into 2 cycles (forgetting the number of
        ways to permute the pieces in each grouping). This is equal to S(12,2)
        where S(n,k) = 1/k! * [sumation(i=0 to (k- 1) : (-1)^i * (k choose i) *
        (k - i)^n )] This comes out to 2^11-1 = 2047 This includes cycles like
        (1)(2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12) or (1 2 3 4 5 6)(7 8 9 10 11 12) For a
        simpler example S(4,2) = 7 which is the number of ways to group 4
        objects into 2 groups. These 7 are (12)(34) (13)(24) (14)(23) (1)(234)
        (2)(134) (3)(124) (4)(123) The Bell numbers, which I mentioned earlier,
        are just summations of these Stirling numbers. So the nth Bell number is
        the same as the sum of all S(n,k) as k goes from 1 to n. So given 12
        objects the 12th Bell number counts how many possible ways there are to
        group them, from 1 group up to 12 groups, which is just a sum of the
        Stirling numbers S(12,k) k from 1 to 12. Ok, anyway I think this is
        really cool stuff since it&#x27;s all new to me. I have been wondering
        how to find out how many ways there are to form types of cycles so I
        think it&#x27;s totally awesome to read up on how. We never covered
        these numbers in my combinatorics class, but I&#x27;m reading about them
        from my textbook. Ok, I&#x27;m not sure if you other math people knew
        this already, but man is this cool stuff! Is there anything else I
        should be looking into that relates to this type of math? I&#x27;m still
        not entirely certain how the Stirling numbers of the second kind are
        formed, but I know it is done via difference sequences, which I&#x27;m
        also reading up on. Ok anyway just wanted to post, I love math!
        Can&#x27;t wait until I understand this stuff better! Chris

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, Well... I finally did the super4x4 BLD again. The last
        time I tried it was a little over two years ago and my method was
        terrible. Here was my method from that first time (no joke). Solving: 1)
        solve corner orientation 2) do two swaps on edges with r2 B2 U2 l U2
        r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2 R L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R L
        U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; to pair up each edge with its adjacent pair.
        Make sure to do this in such a way as to create the same parity in the
        3x3x3 edge groups as the corners 3) Solve the now created 3x3 edge
        cycles and corner cycles. 4) Use [f&#x27; : r&#x27; u&#x27; r, U] and
        setup moves to solve centers. And yes that beautifully terrible method
        took me 5 hours and 30 minutes to solve it lol. Well this time I just
        did my usual and got it in 35:09 minutes. It feels very cool to come
        full circle like this lol, and makes me wonder how I ever came up with
        that first method at all. I think I didn&#x27;t even understand how
        exactly [f&#x27; : r&#x27; u&#x27; r, U] moved centers around, and just
        applied it as a memorized alg. Anyway I want to do the 5x5x5 supercube
        now. I think it should be pretty similar to the regular 5x5x5. I think
        part of the reason my super4x4 time was much slower was that I
        wasn&#x27;t able to do any tricks for the centers. I started with 0
        solved and wasn&#x27;t able to form any blocks and use block cycles at
        the end. Having tried both for the 4x4 I think the super4x4 is much
        harder. It sucks to potentially have to solve 24 centers AND 24 edges (I
        maximize oriented corners, or try to place 2 corners correctly after the
        scramble). Ok, so my two cents are that the regular 4x4 is waaaaaaaay
        easier than the super4x4. But again, that&#x27;s just my opinion. Chris

        I managed to do two cubes the same way I do one. No memory techniques
        for permutation cycles. Usually I memorize orientations last and solve
        it first so I really dont memorize it to well. I memorized edge-flips
        with the help of three numbers (0-15) for each cube, that was the only
        trick I invented just for multiple cubes. Corner orientation was just
        crammed in to my mind as usual. Solve order was: CO 1, CO 2, EO 1, EO 2,
        CP/EP 1, CP/EP 2 I might be able to do more cubes this way. But really,
        you want some sort of memory system for this much data. /Kåre -----

      <strong>180. Big cubes BLD tutorial??</strong><br />

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I really want to add a new section to my site relating to
        the big cubes BLD and am wondering what to add. My main goal with this
        is to get people to try the bigger cubes BLD. I mean I was perfectly
        content to do just the 3x3x3 for 2.5 years, but having tried the larger
        cubes now I think they are waaaaaaaaaay cooler than the 3x3, no
        question. So my target audience is people who have an interest in BLD,
        and maybe even already do the 3x3, but want to try something else. I
        suppose I should maybe require the 3x3 BLD for this tutorial, since I
        don&#x27;t condone trying say the 5x5 right off the bat with no other
        BLD experience. I&#x27;m sure it could be done, but why have that hard
        of a time learning it at first when you can learn the basics on a
        smaller cube? Also, since my method for solving the big cubes (other
        than sometimes CO and also CP) involves basically nothing but freestlye
        commutators, if I write a tutorial it would most likely turn into a
        tutorial about how to use freestyle commutators. Is there are any
        interest/use in something like this? I have the interest and desire to
        write it, do you guys think anyone would want to read it? Does anyone on
        this group want to read a &quot;so you can do the 3x3, here&#x27;s how
        to do the nxn&quot; tutorial? I just wanted to get some feedback, I very
        much so want to write this and make a new section on my page, but want
        to know what would be most appreciated way to write it? Also, should I
        post stuff about my memory techniques? I guess for the larger cubes the
        memory aspect turns into a little bit more of an issue. Just curious, I
        know there are a lot of big cube BLD&#x27;ers already (and Richard Carr
        already has a tutorial) but I&#x27;d just like to make my contribution
        to this area of cubing as well. Any feedback would be very much
        appreciated. Thanks, Chris

        Hey everyone, I finally did the 5x5x5 supercube BLD :-D This was my
        third try, and my very first try was a gut-wrenchingly close DNF (three
        +centers miscycled). Anyway I&#x27;ve been saying forever that getting
        this cube was my biggest BLD aspiration, so I&#x27;m so crazy happy that
        I finally got there!! :-D The time was 53 minutes 25.35 seconds. I think
        memorization took about 26 minutes something. Well... I guess my next
        BLD goal is to do the relay of course, it seems ridiculously hard
        thinking about it right now, but I want to do it one day. My ultimate
        goal now is the supercube relay. I consider the supercubes much harder
        than the regular version now, because you have zero options for block
        cycling tricks for the centers, making everything just a plain track the
        cycle type solve. So I think the supercube relay is the hardest thing
        that I think I still might be able to do *crosses fingers* Gotta work on
        the relay first. :-S Hope everyone else is doing well in their
        BLD&#x27;ing. This category is so much fun, I really think I am
        addicted. I love the feeling of seeing a solved cube after opening my
        eyes - it&#x27;s like a drug to me. :-) Chris

        centers on the bigger cubes, particularly on the 5x5x5? For the 4x4x4 I
        try to only use one instance of block cycling per solve, and sometimes I
        won&#x27;t do anything special with blocks. But I just had a 5x5x5 solve
        where I had a number of partial blocks and used my cycles to create 4
        blocks setup in 2 transpositions. Then at the very end I cycled the
        blocks back. This considerably sped up my memorization, but sadly the
        solve was a DNF (corners were 2 moves away from solved, and 1 inner
        layer was off) so I assume I undid setup moves incorrectly at 2
        different points. Anyway the reason I am posting is that block cycling
        seems to be much more likely on a 5x5x5, and this solve taught me that
        even creating multiple blocks (4 worked just fine for memorization for
        me) is not a big deal. I want to practice this more, I wish the solve
        wasn&#x27;t a DNF, but it seems like I messed up during the centers
        somewhere (after fixing those two setup move undo errors the corners,
        and all edge types were solved). Anyway I&#x27;m curious what you guys
        think of block cycling? I&#x27;m really starting to like it. I&#x27;m
        still getting used to keeping track of which places in the pseudo-blocks
        I actually see I&#x27;ve already filled in by altering my cycle, but I
        think that won&#x27;t take long. This is cool, but I need more work on
        it. Chris

        Aaaaaah!!!! I just had a frustrating DNF for 4x4, but also very
        exciting. Again it was a DNF, but I memorized in 5:00 exactly and the
        solve would have been 10:33 had I not screwed up (various pieces out of
        place). What I tried was to create 4 blocks on this solve (setup as 2
        transpositions). This made the memorization for centers surprisingly
        quick, and also the solving was faster since I do less individual cycles
        and cycle most of the stuff to its correct spot with blocks at the end.
        I&#x27;m convinced now that getting sub-10 on the 4x4x4 will absolutely
        require block cycling. I think I will try to always use block cycling
        when I have a 2x1 row already built after the scramble, and if I have an
        opportunity to use multiple blocks (like on this solve) then I will go
        for it, rather than limit myself to only 1 instance of block cycling.
        Wow, this is exciting. I treat BLD DNF&#x27;s like DNF&#x27;s on the
        magic, they show the direction you&#x27;re heading. If you DNF a lot
        around a certain time, then you can expect to hope for a time in that
        area soon. I hope to be in the 10 minute range soon, and reach my goal
        of sub-10 before the US2006 competition (July?). I know block cycling is
        the way to do it, and I&#x27;m going to seriously start working on
        training this and getting used to it. I think this technique is
        invaluable for BLD on the bigger cubes. Chris

        5x5, so this is a more regular example of what I&#x27;ve been doing.
        However, I&#x27;m working on getting used to do multiple blocks now,
        instead of just one instance (or 2 blocks in a transposition) like in
        this example. Hold your cube in the usual orientation you solve it into.
        Do the scramble: b r b l2 u&#x27; U l d2 F2 U2 b2 B&#x27; D F f L2 F L d
        l&#x27; r&#x27; u R2 U&#x27; f2 l&#x27; D l2 b R2 B2 R2 B2 D&#x27; u2
        f&#x27; U D l2 u&#x27; And after the scramble rotate the cube z2 (like
        F2) to maximize solved centers. There are now 9 solved centers, but
        using blocks you can consider 12 of them to be solved already. There is
        a block on [Rub + Rdb] that belongs on F. And the piece Fru belongs on
        R. This is perfect. So during the center cycles I&#x27;m going to cycle
        another R face color piece next to the piece at Fru and create 2 blocks
        setup in a transposition. Here is the cycle I will do on the centers:
        (Ubl Dbl Ful Fdl Ubr Bdr Lub Dfr Ruf Dfl Bdl Rdf Luf) Basically I cycle
        through the centers normally until I get to a piece that belongs on R.
        At this point I cycle that R face center next to Fru and then continue
        the rest of the cycle as normal. (Ubl Dbl ... This part is just normal
        cycling, but the piece in Dbl is an R face color piece, so I cycle it to
        Ful to place it next to Fru and create a block. ...Ful... (see above,
        creates a block) ... Fdl Ubr Bdr Lub Dfr Ruf Dfl Bdl Rdf Luf) This is
        just finishing off the center cycle as per normal. Here are the actual
        moves I would do to solve centers. (Ubl Dbl Ful Fdl Ubr Bdr Lub Dfr Ruf
        Dfl Bdl Rdf Luf) (Ubl Dbl Ful): D2 r2 U b u b&#x27; U&#x27; b u&#x27;
        b&#x27; r2 D2 (Ubl Fdl Ubr): r d2 r&#x27; U r d2 r&#x27; U&#x27; (Ubl
        Bdr Lub): L&#x27; r&#x27; U r d&#x27; r&#x27; U&#x27; r d L (Ubl Dfr
        Ruf): r2 l u l&#x27; U&#x27; l u&#x27; l&#x27; U r2 (Ubl Dfl Bdl): U2 l
        U2 r&#x27; d2 r U2 r&#x27; d2 r l&#x27; U2 (Ubl Rdf Luf): L2 f&#x27; U2
        f d2 f&#x27; U2 f d2 L2 And now this leaves only the [Rbu + Rbd] and
        [Luf + Lur] blocks to cycle. And you finish them with R&#x27; d&#x27;
        (fb)2 d F2 d&#x27; (fb)2 d F2 R That&#x27;s the basic idea, but again it
        gets much cooler when you get 3 blocks and 3 cycle them, or create 4
        blocks. Again I&#x27;m new to doing multiple blocks, but I have a
        feeling this is a worthwhile thing to spend my time on, since it speeds
        up memorization so much, and makes the solving faster too (you solve 3
        pieces from your original scramble at once). Was just wondering if you
        guys used this? I was still wondering whether I was going to fully
        commit to this and pursue it, but that 10:33 DNF on 4x4 convinced me
        that it is worth it :-D Let me know what you think still, I think this
        is a great way to improve BLD solving and memorization times for the
        bigger cubes. Chris

        I must have done the scramble wrong, or I still don&#x27;t get it. Why
        did I have to rotate the cube around so my U is D and so forth? Do I use
        my old scheme or this one now? For instance, my front face is red, and I
        can see two red centers on Rub and Rdb, but I don&#x27;t see where you

        Hey everyone, Here is my most complicated block cycle solve to date. The
        centers were successful on this solve, and the whole cube almost, but I
        did one of the edge 3 cycles the wrong direction, leaving 3 edges out of
        place at the end. Here was the scramble: l&#x27; B&#x27; b U2 r&#x27;
        U&#x27; f&#x27; L F l2 d&#x27; U&#x27; r2 R2 u2 D&#x27; B D&#x27; f2 u2
        R f&#x27; b L&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; L F2 D r2 B2 d2 r&#x27; f L2 R&#x27;
        U&#x27; R d&#x27; F&#x27; After the scramble I rotated as y z2 (do them
        in that order, do y first followed by z2) to maximize solved centers and
        setup a block cycle type solve. I did the edge cycles like this (lfU ->
        lbD -> urB -> rbD -> lfD -> dbR) and the other cycle was (rfU -> drB ->
        dbL -> ulB) This purposefully cycles two center pieces to an incorrect
        location in order to setup a block cycle. The moves I did to follow
        those cycles were (lfU -> lbD -> urB) : D&#x27; r&#x27; U f u f&#x27;
        U&#x27; f u&#x27; f&#x27; r D (lfU -> rbD -> lfD) : l F2 l&#x27; b
        u&#x27; b&#x27; D2 b u b&#x27; D2 l F2 l&#x27; (lfU -> dbR) : l&#x27; d
        l U l&#x27; d&#x27; l U&#x27; then for the second cycle (rfU -> drB ->
        dbL) : d b&#x27; U2 b d&#x27; b&#x27; U2 b (rfU -> ulB) : b&#x27; u b U2
        b&#x27; u&#x27; b U2 If you look at the centers now they don&#x27;t
        appear to be even close to solved, but I did this to setup two easy
        block cycles. The cycles are [fuL + fdL] -> [ulF + dlF] -> [buR + bdR]
        and also [urF + drF] &lt;-> [frD + brD] To finish the centers I then did
        [fuL + fdL] -> [ulF + dlF] -> [buR + bdR] : b2 L&#x27; (fb&#x27;)
        l&#x27; (f&#x27;b) L2 (fb&#x27;) l (f&#x27;b) L&#x27; b2 And to solve
        centers all that is left is [urF + drF] &lt;-> [frD + brD] : l&#x27;
        (fb&#x27;)2 l F2 l&#x27; (fb&#x27;)2 l F2 Memorization took 4:00 exactly
        for edges, which is a bit slow for me, but I&#x27;m still getting used
        to seeing these block cycles. In terms of amount of stuff memorized I
        only had 10 things to place into a story and 2 other pieces of
        information to remember (how each of the two block cycles worked). To me
        this felt like having 12 centers already solved (since I effectively had
        to handle 10 centers and 2 extra pieces of information). Adding a new
        item into a story and remembering a block cycle take about the same
        amount of time for me, so memorizing this solve felt to me like a solve
        with half the centers already solved. I need to get used to how exactly
        to cycle the centers to create the blocks (that&#x27;s what took me a
        while for this solve) but still, this technique is very, very cool! All
        I need is more practice to really be able to take advantage of this. I
        get the feeling that I&#x27;m the only one excited about block cycling,
        I hope I&#x27;m not reinventing the wheel or anything, but based on
        basically no response to my last post I decided to try and post one more
        example. And yes I double checked all the moves (and the scramble) and
        everything works. If no one cares about block cycling I&#x27;ll just
        keep to myself and try to develop it, but I would much rather share and
        throw ideas back and forth with others. Hope to get a response this
        time, Chris

        Hey everyone, I just wanted to write a follow up, I think I was a bit
        too harsh below about asking for a response from this post. I guess I
        was just a bit too excited about this technique, and was frustrated at
        only one response, and I guess I didn&#x27;t explain my first post about
        it as well as I should have. I&#x27;m still working on new techniques
        and ways to handle different situations. Mike Bennett also led me to a
        really innovative way to handle the corner parity using the same idea
        from block centers on the edges. This would of course, only happen when
        you had 1 edge group already solved, and also had corner parity, but
        when that happens this technique would really speed things up a bit.
        There&#x27;s a lot to be done in 4x4 BLD land heh heh, trying to learn
        as many of these tricks as I can. If anyone wants to talk 4x4 BLD
        strategies either post here or send me an e-mail, I&#x27;ve got a lot of
        ideas that I want to share with someone in order to try for my goal of a
        sub-10 minute solve (including the memorization). Chris --- In

        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been working on this cube a lot lately, so far
        I&#x27;m down to 4:27.xx as my best time. I&#x27;ve found that the
        memorization is of course the same as for the 3x3x3, except memorizing
        for EO and also that you have to remember the center twists too. I solve
        exactly like I solve the centralmost edges and centers and corners on
        the 5x5x5 supercube, which is to rotate the centers correctly first
        (leaving the U center 1 counterclockwise twist from solved during parity
        solves) and then to use all center safe algs after that point. For EP I
        like algs like these: R2 U F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U2 F B&#x27; R2
        F&#x27; B U R2 (M U2 M&#x27; U2)x2 and for EO I use R&#x27; E&#x27; R2
        E2 R&#x27; U2 R E2 R2 E R U2 Has anyone tried this cube out yet? Is
        there a better way to solve? Handling the edges takes a lot of time on
        this cube because of the longer moves for EP and also for EO. I&#x27;ve
        started resorting to using commutators more like what I&#x27;d use on
        the 4x4x4 rather than doing regular stuff for the edges, since
        everything has to be center safe. Just trying to start a conversation in
        case anyone has also tried this cube and has cool ideas for it. Chris

        Hello, When records are recorded for blindfold cube activities, how

        Hey everyone, Ok so I am fully committed to using blocks in the centers
        and edges when solving a larger cube BLD, and many thanks to Mike
        Bennett for getting me to think beyond centers only :-) Also, today I
        had another idea (stemmed from talking with Mike about blocks), why not
        combine centers AND edges into a block? U (Rr) U&#x27; l&#x27; U
        (Rr)&#x27; U&#x27; l which is just [U (Rr) U&#x27;, l&#x27;] is a cycle
        that moves blocks consisting of 1 edge and 1 center. I think these will
        be a bit harder to see/setup for, but then again I thought that about
        center blocks when I first started too. I&#x27;m going to try to see if
        combining centers and edges into blocks will help things at all, that
        would be a great way to speed up 2 parts of the solve with one short
        trick. Anyone else have any cool experiences with/ideas about blocks?
        They&#x27;re really cool, I&#x27;m quickly becoming a very huge fan :-)

        I think 2x2x1 blocks would be easier to make and also spot when solving.
        These would consist of two edges and two centers. Examples: [(l&#x27;r)
        (U)2 (lr&#x27;), (Dd)2] [(Rr)&#x27; D2 (Rr), (du&#x27;)] [(Rr) U2
        (Rr)&#x27;, (d2u2)] also why forget about including corners into a 2x2x1
        block just for fun? [(Rr) U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27;, (Dd)&#x27;] [(Bb)2, (Rr) F
        (Rr)&#x27;] Wow there is so much here to look into and learn about! Heh

        Hey everyone, Ok so I know the spirit of a BLD solve is that you are to
        have no tactile input from your cube. However for a 5x5x5 cube I just
        realized that a flaw in the design makes tactile information possible on
        the 5x5x5. I just got done from a 5x5x5 BLD solve where I lost track of
        the orientation in the middle of executing a PLL alg that I don&#x27;t
        usually use in a BLD solve. However, because the centers are uneven on a
        rubiks.com 5x5x5 (some stick out more than others) I was able to find my
        original orientation based on whether the center caps sticking out felt
        &quot;right&quot; or not. So again this is cheating by the true spirit
        of things, but it&#x27;s a flaw that can&#x27;t exactly be fixed without
        fixing the problem of uneven center caps on a 5x5x5 cube from rubiks.com
        Should this be accounted for in the WCA rules somehow? Or is this just a
        flaw that is inherent to doing a BLD solve on a physical rubiks.com
        cube? Chris

        Hey everyone, Marcus: The centralmost pieces are not perfectly even with
        the rest of the center pieces surrounding it unless you are just damn
        lucky and have an awesome 5x5x5 cube. I have 5 rubiks.com 5x5x5 cubes
        and I just checked them all and even on my best quality one, meaning as
        few centers as possible are uneven, I can still feel minute differences
        in the &quot;height&quot; of each centralmost center above the others
        surrounding it - enough to tell which face is which even with a
        blindfold on. Tyson: I don&#x27;t mean to sound like I am cheating or
        whatever when I do BLD solves, again I just discovered this last night
        when I lost the orientation on my solve and panicked. Honestly, if I
        were in a competition and lost my orientation and panicked - and I had
        memorized for 20 minutes or more and was most of the way through my
        solve and was feeling good about what the time might be, I could get
        away with it without a judge noticing. I could easily act like I was
        thinking about a hard next freestlye commutator cycle and tap the edge
        pieces I would be &quot;cycling&quot; a lot as if I were thinking about
        setup moves, but in fact be feeling the heights of the center caps to
        see if my orientation was correct. And even if you were looking for
        someone trying to figure out a hard cycle then rotating the cube
        afterward instead of doing moves, I could just do a 3 cycle on edges
        after finding the orientation, then undo it with a different commutator
        (wow that 3 cycle was hard! see how many moves it took to solve it?)
        then after getting back to where I started rotate the cube correctly.
        Maybe I have bad luck with buying 5x5&#x27;s, but I swear I don&#x27;t
        modify them to have the centers be noticeable. I just buy them, break
        them in with some twisting for a week or so, lube them after that once
        every few days until they&#x27;re nice. Again though, even on my best
        quality 5x5x5 there are enough differences in the heights of the
        centralmost centers for me to be able to discern my correct orientation
        should I get lost during a solve. Again I&#x27;m not trying to make it
        sound like every 5x5x5 solver ever cheats, but I noticed this and was
        able to use tactile information to help me fix an error in my solve
        when, by the spirit of things, that shouldn&#x27;t be possible. Chris

        Hey Thom, that&#x27;s awesome that you&#x27;re getting interested in
        4x4x4 BLD, it&#x27;s very addicting so be aware of that :-) If
        you&#x27;re not hooked already, you will be soon I expect :-) >> Anyone
        up for teaching me centres? If you like Stefan&#x27;s method for edges,
        then there&#x27;s no reason not to use it for centers too. I personally
        would use this setup, let lbU and rbU be your two buffer spots (or the
        buffer and the other center I guess) and then let ufL be the center spot
        to where you setup your locations. For instance if rbU is the buffer
        center and you want to move it to dbR, then setup dbR to ufL by doing
        R&#x27; u2 then do U r&#x27; u&#x27; r U&#x27; r&#x27; u r then undo
        your setup with u2 R Also you can have the position to where you move
        all your edges be Ufl instead of Luf and keep all three locations in the
        same layer. So if you want to move rbU to dbR this way you can do R2
        f&#x27; as setup then do the move f l u l&#x27; U&#x27; l u&#x27;
        l&#x27; U f&#x27; then undo the setup with f R2. One thing to think
        about, if you are going to try for very fast times eventually, you have
        to think about moving blocks of centers also rather then just one or two
        at a time all the time. If the cube sets up a block for you (or a
        situation where a small amount of cycling on your part can make a number
        of blocks), then it is easier to save those blocks to the end, them move
        them. This will save time over moving all the pieces to their spots
        using regular cycles and move them individually. In terms of solving
        centers though, I see no reason not to use Stefan&#x27;s method for
        those too, it would be just as good and just as fast as using his method
        for the edges is. Just be open minded about taking advanage of blocks.
        Also the same can go for edges too, even with Stefan&#x27;s method. If
        the cube gives you a block, take advantage of that! It will make your
        solve easier and speed up your memorization too (more stuff is memorized
        with the &quot;chunking&quot; idea rather than the linear cycle idea so
        it goes much faster). Let us know how your 4x4 BLD exploits go :-) Chris

        I think the 3-cycle &quot;fake swap&quot; itself is of course slower to
        execute, but setup moves should generally be shorter. And of course
        there are fewer centers to solve... Cheers! Stefan

        I&#x27;ve noticed is that you can skip out a big chunk of moves. You can
        repeat the same alg as the last one when you know both buffer pieces are
        the same, when they&#x27;re the same and you wanna put another piece in
        that&#x27;s the same you skip that alg and do nothing, etc, etc. There
        are so many shortcuts here :) I go thte idea from skipping a move when
        you get he helper stuck in the buffer in the edges method. I can see how
        supercube would be easyer for memorising but harder for execution... no
        shortcuts with the super. Another great thing.. you always have at least
        one buffer piece solved at the start :), then when the other pop&#x27;s
        in, you can start cutting out moves. It&#x27;s not just a generic set of
        moves you do, you actually have to think :) This is a lot of fun, I can
        see what you&#x27;re talking about, chris. Stefan: You forgot to add
        that it&#x27;s easyer to understand :) ~Thom --- In

        Hey Thom, congrats on your centers solve! You definitely have all the
        parts now, it just takes putting it all together, which you definitely
        can do. My only suggestion is to try to memorize the centers and edges a
        different way from eachother. For example, don&#x27;t use numbers say
        for both, because what if you mix up the numbers between centers and
        edges? Also I had an idea for you and Stefan. What happens if both the
        helper and buffer solve while doing the cycles? My thinking is that you
        would generally &quot;break into&quot; another cycle and continue. But
        since you have so many centers so choose from, why not choose a
        completely different buffer and helper that would let you continue
        without any sort of &quot;break into&quot; move? And it could be that
        what you just suggested Thom is exactly that, I&#x27;m still new to the
        idea of using a helper and a buffer pieces, but I think I&#x27;m
        starting to catch on to how it works. So forgive me if I am repeating
        exactly what you just said but with different words. Anyway if that is a
        new idea maybe that could work sometimes if things are setup correctly?
        Good luck with your solve and let us know how things go! Chris --- In

        Hey everyone, Recently I&#x27;ve started doing my BLD solves with loud
        music playing, and also in rooms where people are talking, the TV is
        playing loudly, etc. My accuracy has gone down considerably in these
        situations. Does anyone have any tricks for concentrating with lots of
        distractions? I&#x27;m getting better at focusing, but it is still hard
        to get a successful solve for me under these conditions. The hardest
        distractions for me right now are to listen to comedy while doing a
        solve. I tried doing a 5x5x5 solve last night while listening to one of
        my favorite comedians. It&#x27;s very hard to concentrate this way, but
        I noticed toward the end of the solve that I was better able to tune out
        the jokes. The solve was still a DNF though, but close! Anyone have any
        tips for tuning out distractions? I&#x27;m trying to listen to my
        favorite songs, favorite comedians, or just have a lot of distractions
        going at once to make it as hard as I can, but I&#x27;m having a harder
        time with it than I thought I would. Any help would be appreciated,
        Chris

        I just had an idea! I just got a successful 4x4 BLD solve with loud
        music playing, and I think I have an idea for not letting distractions
        get to you. I was listening to loud music while doing my solve, and
        instead of trying to block out the music I was trying to listen to it
        and enjoy it. It&#x27;s a weird feeling, but actually letting go and
        just listening to the music and enjoying it seems to take less brain
        power than trying to block it out completely. It sort of that I let my
        brain listen to it, but I don&#x27;t really pay much attention to it. I
        don&#x27;t know if this will work for listening to talking also, but
        I&#x27;ll try that too. It&#x27;s sort of like you listen to it to some
        extent, but only as background. This seems to work better than a
        &quot;oh my god tune out that distraction!&quot; mentality. Still
        messing around with this, but I think it will work in general. If this
        does work, I may try doing a solve with my alarm clock going to see how
        to handle a solve with a really annoying noise that you can&#x27;t
        really enjoy listening too. I&#x27;m not sure how to handle something
        like that. I feel like training with distractions though will make a
        solve in front of an audience seem rather easy. Actually I think
        I&#x27;m going to try the alarm clock idea next, I really have no idea
        how I would handle that, and I think if you can solve with something
        like that going you can handle most anything. I&#x27;ll post how it goes
        after I try it, gotta go run some errands right now though. Chris --- In

        Chris, I had the same problems before with BLD chess. If your thought
        process is to tune out the distractions, that is probably a distraction
        in itself :) Instead I worked on a stronger focus of the task at hand,
        then the &quot;tuning out&quot; occurs naturally. Just an idea, -Richard

        Hey everyone, I successfully solved the 4x4 blindfolded while my alarm
        clock was going off! I set it to go off and left it on during the entire
        solve, memorization and solving. The memorization took 8:30 roughly and
        the solving took about 7:46. The total time was 15:16.21! It was much
        harder to focus during the memorization than usual, and also when
        performing a commutator I had to speak out loud whether I had done the
        single slice move first or the stuff to place and edge/center first.
        Also, instead of trying to block out the alarm clock I found it useful
        to sort of follow the pattern of it and try to think of it as a beat to
        solve to, rather than a sound I need to drown out. I&#x27;m so happy to
        know that I can still do this even with distraction! Arrgh I can&#x27;t
        wait to do this in front of an audience and prove that I&#x27;m not just
        making this stuff up! I can&#x27;t wait until the April tournament in
        Tennesse!! Chris

        Hey Marcus, Congrats on the new UWR for 3x3x3 BLD! Also your 5x5x5 time
        is quite awesome! I have a question though, why aren&#x27;t you on the
        list for 4x4 BLD? I think given the disparity between you and I on the
        5x5 list, that assuming the same disparity for 4x4 would put you under
        10 minutes easy. I think you could get there much sooner than anyone
        else can, why not also try for this barrier and show it is possible? Btw
        I had a 9:09 DNF for the 4x4x4 today. I had memorized too quickly and
        didn&#x27;t take into account a small edge cycle (thought I had 24
        accounted for but I didn&#x27;t). But I am nearing this barrier.
        Memorization, without all the edges of course so not completely real or
        comparable, was just under 4:20. Seriously, please try the 4x4 alone the
        same as you do the 5x5. I know you would do very well at it. I&#x27;ll
        even offer a race for first to sub-10 lol, but I doubt I will make it
        first :-P Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@...m,

        You will be definetly distracted by noise, if you have rote memorised
        the cube. Instead, if you have memorised the cube by visualising the
        position of the cube as a picture, then you may not be distracted by
        noise. Concentration is nothing but visualising the picture in your
        minds eye. When you do this, you can not hear anything even if someone
        speaks to you. The music without words is far better. A music with words
        might trigger your thoughts based on those words. John Louis cmhardw

        I don&#x27;t remember my best time precisely but it was around 7 minutes
        I think but it was a slightly lucky case in terms of center
        permutations. I can do one again here soon when this big midterm I have
        passes, but in general I don&#x27;t submit records unless I am really
        proud of them; I&#x27;d consider myself a very &quot;under the
        radar&quot; cuber regardless. That particular 4x4 solve was maybe a
        little too lucky to add to the list. How come I never hear of anyone
        else having wrist issues by the way? Normally my hands don&#x27;t hurt
        but after a cubing session they tend to be on fire and that can&#x27;t
        be good. BTW, as for your 9:09, it shows you can definitely break the 10
        barrier in, I&#x27;m guessing, no time at all. Your &quot;memorizing too
        quickly&quot; is actually a good way to go about it. What I do is put on
        some loud, fast music. It tends to get you energized so you never make
        any lethargic moves or decisions. Music with a high tempo also seems to
        have influence over your turns-per-second rate, strangely enough --
        it&#x27;s like keeping in tune. Sometimes if you just memorize as fast
        as you can, you can execute the moves while the patterns linger in your
        short-term memory. You can manipulate the cube physically faster than I
        can; try it out sometime and see what happens? :P This idea was actually
        influenced by Katsu (Planet Puzzle), I believe his name is. He did a few
        solves on video to a metronome and it seemed like a really nice way to
        stick the process to a &quot;schedule&quot; to at least guarantee a
        certain degree of speed. Like I can memorize things quickly but it only
        compensates for my decreasing handspeed -- all those fast finger tricks
        kick the crap out of my wrists nowadays. I don&#x27;t have my 4x4x4 with
        me at the moment, but I can treat my 5x5x5 as a 4x4x4 and just ignore
        the central chambers I presume? Anyways let me know how your progress
        goes. Also how would you define your block cycling method? You seem
        excited about it but I can&#x27;t bring myself to actually try out the
        examples you&#x27;ve listed (I tend to mess up the cube executing the
        algorithms -- not used to the notation). --- In

        you should try simon@garfunkel. when i listened to themn during a BLD

        Hey everyone, I have a question for you memory experts. I&#x27;ve been
        working on my 3x3 memorization in a way I&#x27;ve never tried before. I
        scramble a cube and solve corners visually. Then I memorize the edge
        permutation for 10 seconds (or whatever I can memorize in 10 seconds)
        and then put on the blindfold and see how much I can recall. I&#x27;ve
        found that the way I usually memorize is not very good for memorizing
        quickly in that I actually say words in my head. Instead of doing
        everything entirely visually I actually think phrases like &quot;that
        piece goes here which goes here and those three together look sort of
        like a staircase.&quot; Then I remember &quot;staircase&quot; as my cue
        to recall the whole shape during the solve. When I tried doing this in
        10 seconds I was only able to memorize about 5 edges into the cycle. I
        then tried doing it entirely visually (which feels weird for me since
        I&#x27;m used to using this internal dialogue). My best so far was to
        memorize 8 edges and solve them correctly in about 12 seconds (it&#x27;s
        hard to stop at 10 seconds flat). Anyway I&#x27;ve noticed a pattern
        here, the way I memorize edges with that internal dialogue is also the
        way I read. When reading I actually say the words inside my head and I
        comprehend the story exactly as if I were hearing it told by someone,
        only that someone is me. As you can guess I&#x27;m a slow reader. So
        anyway, do you super fast guys use entirely visual techniques for
        memorizing a cube? Or do you use a mix of methods? Does anyone use an
        internal dialogue like this? I&#x27;m trying to really analyze exactly
        what I do when I memorize since I want to try to speed things up. I have
        a feeling that for 3x3 speed BLD this sort of internal dialogue is not a
        good idea, but then again maybe there is a more efficient way for me to
        use it than what I do now? Hoping someone here has any advice. I really
        want to learn how to train my memory, as I am really starting to get
        into this BLD stuff. Chris

        Hey Chris I use numbers for the edge orientation and both permutations.
        Usually I memorise the numbers more than visually...but I use some

        (exactly opposite of me...haha...maybe that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s

        Chris, I would assume you use language as a way to further verify where
        things are. By saying things out loud you &quot;ensure&quot; that pieces
        are where they are and thusly you&#x27;re able to execute algorithms
        with more certainty. However, of course this is a potential obstacle.
        Consider your speedcubing -- do you also use internal language when
        solving it? I would presume no -- you go based on reflexes and pattern
        recognition and the muscle memory inherent in your hands after
        practicing certain executions. The same goes for blindfold solving in
        the sense that you want to move to a point where you can do things on
        reflex, but since this case involves memorizing new data, it&#x27;s a
        little different: When you use language to verify your positionings,
        usually it will be correct. Now, assuming this, you are probably going
        to make a correct move without the language and thus lowering your
        memorization time. Instead you can think &quot;Staircase&quot; which is
        a visual cue, a visual cue similar in nature to the visual cues of
        speedcubing. If you can get blindfolding cubing into this same sphere of
        action that you can with speedcubing in terms of how you view patterns,
        you can execute the moves much more quickly without the worry of making
        a wrong move or cycling an incorrect piece. Hope this makes sense. ---

        about the block method. I mean it&#x27;s kind of hard to describe
        without an example solve, so without using an example solve I&#x27;ll
        try my best. Basically I purposefully cycle centers/edges/pieces in
        general to an incorrect face (if the center is red I&#x27;ll cycle it on
        purpose to the yellow face say) to create a 2x1 block with a red piece
        that was already there. If you do this in a clever/useful way though,
        the blocks you create will be in a 3 cycle with eachother. Or maybe even
        a 4 cycle, or just a 2-swap. There are all kinds of ways you can create
        blocks. Also, I&#x27;m trying to mess around with forming two 2x2x1
        blocks each made up of a corner, the two adjecent edges and the center
        piece that touches them. Then I can set them up to do (Rr)2 D&#x27; U
        (Rr)2 U&#x27; (Rr)2 D (Rr)2 D&#x27; (Rr)2 D (Rr)2 U&#x27; to swap them.
        And if they&#x27;re in a 3 cycle I can do that same move without the
        final U turn or also something like (Rr) U2 (Rr)&#x27; (Dd) (Rr) U2
        (Rr)&#x27; (Dd)&#x27; The reason I like using blocks it is that it
        allows me to really take advantage of chunking. When memorizing my
        cycles where I move centers individually I can consider every piece in a
        block to be &quot;solved&quot;. So my individual pieces cycle could only
        be 8 pieces long or so. Then I remember the cycle of the blocks in place
        of the potentially 8-9 other pieces that would have been in that first
        cycle. Chris

        The method I use is hard to describe, but I&#x27;ll try. Basically, I
        carried this over from speedreading. When you were a kid, you used to
        start reading by reading each letter in turn, then recognising the word,
        then moving onto the next word. Now you just recognise the words as a
        whole. In speedreading, you start to read phrases and sentences as a
        whole, this is what I carried over. It&#x27;s like how 3247237284 is
        harder to memorise than (324) (723) (728) (4) You need to start looking
        at the cycles in patterns, not &quot;This cubie, then that one, then
        that one.&quot; More like &quot;These three&quot;. I memorise visually
        (no numbers/text/images, I feel it slows me down), so this is easyer for
        me. I try and do things like how you did with the staircase. But
        don&#x27;t assign anything to it, just remember that pattern. I try not
        to think &quot;the pattern that is in-out-in and the one that goes
        around the middle slice&quot; but instead &quot;this pattern and that
        pattern&quot;. I do a lot of feeling of the cube when I memorise. :)
        Like when I was doing the 4x4x4 centres, I had a pattern that went dlB ,
        dlR and dlF. What went through my mind wasn&#x27;t &quot;They go around
        hte cube&quot; it was just &quot;that pattern&quot;. (Well, actually, it
        wasn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s nearly impossable to describe yourself
        feeling a pattern in your head on the cube ;) ). Even things that
        don&#x27;t make patterns can make patterns. you just have to visualise
        it. I think my technique is faulty, though. I&#x27;ll memorise the first
        4, and lock the first three in my memory. I&#x27;ll still know the
        fourth, but I always go ovver the cycles multiple times to make sure I
        won&#x27;t forget them. I could probibly do a one-pass memorisation, but
        I always go over them again, fearing I will messup. Then I&#x27;ll go
        over the first 7, memorise them, go over the first 10, etc... I need a
        better technique, but &#x27;spiderman-banana-abacus&#x27; doesn&#x27;t
        appeal to me. ~Thom --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        Why not do *first three numbers* then going 2 by 2? like: you have the
        cycle (1 3 6 8 2 4 10 12 5 7 9) for EP...this is how I memorise: (1 3 6)
        (8 2) (4 10) (12 5) (7 9). That way it&#x27;s easy for me, &#x27;cause I
        do the first cycle, &quot;erase&quot; 3 and 6, and join 8 and 2. Do the
        next, erase 8 and 2, add 4 and 10...and so on...and if I end with a
        number alone, I know I&#x27;ll have to fix the parity. Pedro thomkirjava
        &lt;snkenjoi@...> escreveu: The method I use is hard to describe, but
        I&#x27;ll try. Basically, I carried this over from speedreading. When
        you were a kid, you used to start reading by reading each letter in
        turn, then recognising the word, then moving onto the next word. Now you
        just recognise the words as a whole. In speedreading, you start to read
        phrases and sentences as a whole, this is what I carried over. It&#x27;s
        like how 3247237284 is harder to memorise than (324) (723) (728) (4) You
        need to start looking at the cycles in patterns, not &quot;This cubie,
        then that one, then that one.&quot; More like &quot;These three&quot;. I
        memorise visually (no numbers/text/images, I feel it slows me down), so
        this is easyer for me. I try and do things like how you did with the
        staircase. But don&#x27;t assign anything to it, just remember that
        pattern. I try not to think &quot;the pattern that is in-out-in and the
        one that goes around the middle slice&quot; but instead &quot;this
        pattern and that pattern&quot;. I do a lot of feeling of the cube when I
        memorise. :) Like when I was doing the 4x4x4 centres, I had a pattern
        that went dlB , dlR and dlF. What went through my mind wasn&#x27;t
        &quot;They go around hte cube&quot; it was just &quot;that
        pattern&quot;. (Well, actually, it wasn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s nearly
        impossable to describe yourself feeling a pattern in your head on the
        cube ;) ). Even things that don&#x27;t make patterns can make patterns.
        you just have to visualise it. I think my technique is faulty, though.
        I&#x27;ll memorise the first 4, and lock the first three in my memory.
        I&#x27;ll still know the fourth, but I always go ovver the cycles
        multiple times to make sure I won&#x27;t forget them. I could probibly
        do a one-pass memorisation, but I always go over them again, fearing I
        will messup. Then I&#x27;ll go over the first 7, memorise them, go over
        the first 10, etc... I need a better technique, but
        &#x27;spiderman-banana-abacus&#x27; doesn&#x27;t appeal to me. ~Thom ---

        Hey Thom, Congratulations on your solve! Welcome to the addiction ;-)
        Looking at your scramble, yes that is definitely not the nicest of
        solves to attempt, so again congrats on your success! Also I know what
        you mean about being afraid to do the last permutation. I hardly ever do
        finger tricks for the T if I have to end with it, and I usually go super
        slow just because I&#x27;m afraid of misaligning a face during a trigger
        and not knowing which way it went. Also, just to get you thinking about
        blocks too. From the start of your scramble, imgaine instead of cycling
        the centers normally, cycle a D face center piece very early on (your
        first opportunity even) to lfD. Notice then that the newly created block
        at [lfD + lbD] switches with the block already at [urB + drB]. This is a
        perfect example of using blocks. It&#x27;s a faster way to memorize
        three of the center pieces, and also you move those three to the correct
        location in 1 move (but you did waste a move moving the first D face
        center to lfD. So the net effect is to move 2 centers to their correct
        location for free). Awesome job, and again congrats on your 4x4x4 BLD
        solve! Lots of luck with all your future BLD exploits, and keep us
        updated on how it goes! Chris --- In

        Cycle a *B* face center very early on to lfD (the incorrect face for
        it). But this creates a B face block at [lfD + lbD] which switches with
        the D face block already at [urB + drB]. Sorry for the mistype, but
        check out that block setup and see if it is something that interests
        you. Other than cycling that one B face center to lfD the cycles work
        the same way as you normally handle them. The only difference is that at
        the very end of your centers cycles you need to also fix the blocks,
        which you could do with B2 r&#x27; f2 b2 r B2 r&#x27; f2 b2 r and that
        would finish off the centers completely. Just food for thought, Chris

        Hey everyone, I have a question about a corner scenario for CP. I want
        to hear every possible viewpoint, so even those who don&#x27;t orient
        first please let me know if you have any cool ideas. Let&#x27;s say I
        have the cycle (UBL -> DBL -> DBR) I used to use this move, D&#x27; B2 R
        F R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R&#x27; D Recently I switched to this move after
        watching videos of Tyson: x&#x27; (L&#x27;ULU&#x27;)x3 F
        (RU&#x27;R&#x27;U)x3 F&#x27; x I&#x27;ve found that Tyson&#x27;s way
        helps me to memorize very quickly, since the cycles are done with an
        easy process. However, it really irks me to do 26 moves for a cycle when
        I could just as easily do 10. Sure those 26 moves are super fast, but I
        mean so are those 10. But solving with those 10 makes it a bit slower
        for me during memorization than if I solved with the 26 moves. Long
        story short, I&#x27;m undecided. What would others do for that case?

        No but I&#x27;m planning to release a few videos all at once -- one with
        a solve of a 3x3x3, one describing method/approach of a 3x3x3, and maybe

        Hi Stefan, Thank you very much. My apologies for being too lazy to
        compress... but I uploaded the file onto strangepuzzle.com. Marcus, if
        you need a place to host your video, just use strangepuzzle.com. You can
        send your video to Chris Hunt by using yousendit.com or some other web
        service like that. Otherwise, if you want to transfer it to me, I&#x27;d
        be happy to upload it onto my web space. Just in case you forgot, the
        scramble is here: D2 U R U L&#x27; U D2 R U L&#x27; D B2 U&#x27; D
        L&#x27; B&#x27; R2 D2 B2 U2 F2 D&#x27; F2 L F How did you correct the
        edge parity? I did it in an inefficient manner, which explains my pause
        right before I corrected it. I was trying to think of something good,
        but then decided to give up on it for the sake of total time. I have a
        better way now but I&#x27;d be curious as to how you solved it. If you
        don&#x27;t remember, I&#x27;m sure we can figure it out from the video
        you took. Tyson Mao Astrophysics &#x27;06 California Institute of

        hi guys! yesterday i did a successful BLD-solve while my brain waves
        were measured (EEG). i kept my eyes closed and didn&#x27;t have to use a
        blindfold, because they see every single eye-movement and if you twinkle
        or not. in the first 20 seconds i calmed down and tried to think of
        nothing. during the memorization phase my eyes moved rapidly and the
        brain activity raised (i memorized for 2 minutes because i wantet to
        play it safe). during the solve (also 2 minutes) you can see that i
        needed one second of thinking, then i execute a move deep im my
        subconsciousness, while the activity goes down. a few seconds of
        thinking and then the next algorithm and so on. i don&#x27;t know what
        we can learn out if it and if i could get faster by cubing during the
        EEG, but it was funny. i would lilke to check the differences between
        memorizing with numbers and with pictures. > --- UrsprÂ¤ngliche

        The 3x3 speed corner cycle is awesome. I was inspired by it to find a
        way to fix one of my worst edge cycles. I use to hate seeing lUB -> lUF
        -> lDF but now I just use the same idea as the corners cycle, F&#x27; d
        F&#x27; U2 F d&#x27; F&#x27; U2 F2 :-D I like that style of conjugate,
        having the conjugate move combine with the first move of the commutator
        itself, so it condenses to 9 moves. Not sure if anyone has tried that
        cycle, but I like it a lot. Works for 5x5 too. Chris

        The 1:17 solve had no edge orientation issues and had three/four edges
        solved already. Memorization was about 22 seconds. My memorization times
        are not normally this low -- I&#x27;d say on average it takes me maybe
        25-30 seconds for an average solve. 15 is the lower bound and usually
        occurs around cases with more obvious visual patterns that stand out
        (for instance, in a corner orientation case looks kinda like a Sune,
        etc). My execution time is indeed slow because of wrist pain. I used to
        have a speedsolving average of about 15 or so seconds but that quickly
        shot back down to around 30 or 35, where I am now actually. My fingers
        and hands just hurt like hell trying to do fast finger tricks (there is
        also a lot of shaking in my fingers). A lot of this probably has to do
        with my DDR playing (sometimes I like to play really hard songs on the
        keyboard). You&#x27;ve seen my PSMO video so you can see how hard it is
        on the hands (if you look at them in action). Over time this has
        probably caused damage so I&#x27;m staying away from damaging my hands
        in whatever ways I can. The damaged hands was the sole reason in the
        first place why I attempted to find better memory methods. And no I
        don&#x27;t happen to have the scramble, I didn&#x27;t keep it.
        Furthermore I need a battery to access my camera, I can&#x27;t access it
        otherwise even with the USB connector; it just doesn&#x27;t turn on.
        I&#x27;ll probably do a search on Ebay or something. > What was the

        Wait a second.... So what type of method are you using? If your
        execution is slow because of hand pain, but your memorization is about
        25-30 seconds, that would still mean 60 seconds for execution.
        Leyan&#x27;s execution is about 60 seconds, and my execution is about
        the same speed, maybe slightly slower. If you look at the video of my
        solve, I have a few pauses here and there, but generally the moves
        I&#x27;m doing take a good amount of dexterity. Leyan, on the other
        hand, will do 60 seconds or less on execution, but he&#x27;s making the
        same number of moves as me, and he&#x27;s just not pausing. In other
        words, if your speed solve goes from 15 seconds and increases to 30
        seconds, it seems like you&#x27;re making moves twice as slowly as
        before. I would think that your maximum hand speed is about the same as
        Leyan who has recorded 15.1x averages in competition, so if you&#x27;re
        executing the moves on the cube in 60 seconds for the blindfold method,
        your method must take half as many moves. What method are you using?

        Oh yeah, that&#x27;s definitely true. So how do you still solve the
        cube? I&#x27;m guessing if you come across an OLL you don&#x27;t know,
        you just do something twice, like (R U F U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27;) until
        you get an algorithm that you do know, and for PLL, you just use A-perms
        to fix the corners and things like that? Are you using BLD moves that
        you haven&#x27;t forgot as well? The reason I ask is that if your hand
        speed is still the same and you still have all of your F2L, then your
        times shouldn&#x27;t really drop from 15 to 30... F2L is the main
        component of any speed solve, and using a four-look LL, I can still
        average under 20. Are you using BLD algorithms to put everything in
        place gradually which accounts for the 15 seconds extra it&#x27;s taking
        you to solve the cube? Tyson Mao Astrophysics &#x27;06 California

        Hey everybody, It has been a while since I did anything with blindfold
        cubing... But did any of the top-blindfold cubers try Stefan Pochmanns
        method? And what do you think about it? I personally believe that it
        will be faster that the OE/PE strategy, if you can learn to use three
        cycles and still do orientation/permuation at the same time... And I
        would just love to see a top-blindfold cuber try that. I haven&#x27;t
        done it in a while, but maybe I have some ideas to expand my system of
        memorisation... I&#x27;ll try that soon. - Joël.

        Hey Joel, I&#x27;m currently working on a similar approach, inspired by
        Stefan&#x27;s method, for 5x5x5 central edges (and thus also 3x3x3
        edges). My plan is to use commutators and setup moves to solve
        orientation and permutation at the same time for two pieces per cycle.
        So I would correctly permute and orient 2 pieces for each three cycle,
        then let the 3rd edge just make it a possible cycle. Then at the end I
        might have to flip a few edges, but there would not be much work left to
        do either way. Not sure if that qualifies exactly as Stefan&#x27;s
        method, but it is heavily inspired by his method. I&#x27;m not sure how
        fast it would be for 3x3x3, but it would save me a lot of moves for the
        5x5x5, since my edge flip algs are very slow to execute. Not sure if
        this is what you&#x27;re asking for, but it is something inspired very
        strongly by ideas form Stefan. Chris --- In

        Oik... the only &quot;top BLD&quot; cuber that uses Stefan&#x27;s method
        is Jean Pons I believe... and by &quot;top,&quot; I guess I mean under
        2:30. But yeah, he did a low 2-minute solve at worlds so I know times
        like those are definitely possible with the Pochmann method. No offense

        You pretty much have it down -- I use algs I know until I see a case I
        remember. I generally only use blindfold algs for the LL if they only
        deal with sets of pieces that are identical (eg all edges, all corners).
        I just tried speedsolving and got 24 seconds so I am not actually so far
        down the line, but the last layer eats up a lot of my time. I really
        can&#x27;t say where the time is going -- it&#x27;s not just one factor
        but the sum of many, and the times are a lot different if I happen to
        remember or not remember a certain OLL or PLL case. --- In

        Oh... sorry Joel, I didn&#x27;t read your message that carefully. I
        personally haven&#x27;t tried Stefan&#x27;s method. One reason is that I
        don&#x27;t understand it completely, but part of that is because I
        haven&#x27;t spent the time to study it. I&#x27;ve been so lazy lately
        in terms of practicing because, well, when you cube for a public
        audience, (i.e., in front of hot girls) your times don&#x27;t matter.
        These last few days I&#x27;ve been getting back into the groove of
        things and I think my times are strong again. No more of these DNF, DNF,
        2:40 competitions :-P. Georgia 3/11 should be better. Anyway, it seems
        that Stefan&#x27;s method can be very powerful. Perhaps the utilization
        of 2-cycles as opposed to 3-cycles gives less delays during the
        execution. One question which I&#x27;m not sure about is the ease in
        memory. I can generally memorize the edge permutation by my method in
        under 20 seconds... I wonder what it would increase to? One thing to
        keep in mind is that edge orientation memorization takes maybe 2 to 3
        seconds, and edge orientation execution takes another 3 to 5 seconds...
        so I&#x27;m not sure how much you save. Time to run. Yay! Cube mile
        anyone? Well... hmm... I should look into it. I might e-mail some of you
        guys for help, but my idea is that if I can memorize the edges using
        Stefan&#x27;s method in under 25 seconds, then the payoff is worth it.
        Otherwise, I&#x27;m not sure, because edge orientation in our method is
        so trivial to deal with. It literally is &quot;glance, put on blindfold,
        execute&quot;... many times just one setup move plus one algorithm...

        making me think about where I can improve my memorisation. I basically
        use 24 letters for the edges (letters that are connected to words like
        &#x27;Donald duck&#x27; yes). And a while ago, I got to the point where
        I could instantly convert cubies into letters and vice versa. However,
        memorising a sequence of letters was actually quite timeconsuming
        (allthough I was getting better a little while ago), so I was thinking
        about a system to make a story with them... Of course, this can slow me
        down too, but if I can &#x27;standardise&#x27; the story, I don&#x27;t
        have to make the whole thing up on the fly... So maybe that would
        work... Or maybe I should just memorise the first 5 letters, and think
        &#x27;this pattern, that pattern&#x27; for the rest ;). I know Jean Pons
        memorised 7 objects, and does the rest with numbers, because he says 7
        objects are not hard to memorise... - Joël.

        Hey Tyson Well, breaking up the 3 cycles into 2-cycles is not the power
        of the method... I actually suspect you will have to use three cycles to
        make it more powerfull than what you do now. I definately think
        memorisation of the whole permutation can be done in the same time as
        you memorise your permutation. I remember Dror Vomberg told me there is
        too much information to memorise if you do orientation and permutation
        in one go, but I actually think you memorise less information... You
        memorise the same amount of info as you memorise for the permutation
        only, not more than that. So I predict you save at least 7 (that is 5+2)
        seconds on the edges orientation. It will however take time to develop a
        nice system of memorisation (you&#x27;ll need 24 numbers, or
        &#x27;objects&#x27;) and it will take time to get used to doing it in
        three cycles... The reason for this post is just that I would love to
        see a top BLD cuber try it, so one person can compare both methods. -

        It&#x27;s real easy, the core idea is just: &quot;Solve one piece at a
        time.&quot; That&#x27;s the simplest most natural idea that comes to my
        mind after thinking that for blindsolving, you want to go in very small
        steps. Doing orientation and permutation together is inherent and
        natural in this idea, or in other words: even thinking about these two
        issues as separate issures is unnatural (for my idea). So yeah, solving
        two pieces at a time could be called an extension of my method, but on
        the other hand it breaks with the core idea. It does share the aspect of
        doing orientation and permutation together, but actually that&#x27;s
        only noticed by people who think of them separately. So for me this
        shared aspect isn&#x27;t even really noticable, but the difference of
        solving two pieces instead of one is. > One thing to keep in mind is
        that edge orientation memorization takes > maybe 2 to 3 seconds, and
        edge orientation execution takes another 3 to > 5 seconds... so I&#x27;m
        not sure how much you save. In addition to not doing orientation
        separately, it might also save time for setup moves. With the
        orient-first strategy, you need to setup pieces with a certain
        orientation. Actually of course it depends on how you execute both
        methods, particularly whether you setup pieces to certain standard
        positions or do completely free-style cycles like Chris does for 4x4
        edges. Cheers! Stefan

        Hey Stefan, Actually Stefan, this is really a funny post to me... >
        It&#x27;s real easy, the core idea is just: > &quot;Solve one piece at a
        time.&quot; Haha... I was almost going to say: &#x27;You are sooo wrong
        about that!&#x27;. But of course, it&#x27;s your method, so you must be
        right.. Right? Well, actually, with the traditional cycle method, I
        solved one piece at a time when I did the corners. In my view, the
        essential new thing of your method is NOT solving 1 piece at the time,
        but losing the orientation, because it is an unnesecary burden. As you
        say, there&#x27;s no need to think about orientations. Even when the
        piece is in place. It&#x27;s just that most of us (including me) think
        of it that way! > Actually of course it depends > on how you execute

        Ok, lets take a sample solve of however you want this done. Algo
        Scramble 3x3: F D U&#x27; R D B2 U2 R D2 B2 R&#x27; D2 F R2 L2 D2 L2 D

        (F2U&#x27;M&#x27;U2MU&#x27;F2) L&#x27;M d2L&#x27;y2
        (F2U&#x27;M&#x27;U2MU&#x27;F2) y2Ld2 Maybe this is a lucky case, but no
        more than two setup moves on this? That&#x27;s amazingly good. I think
        corners should still be done traditionally, though. I agree that
        it&#x27;s just like memorising permutation on it&#x27;s own. I memorise
        faster by remembering orientation + permutation together than if I
        remember just the permutation. It&#x27;s probibly the way I memorise,
        though. > (you&#x27;ll need 24 numbers, or &#x27;objects&#x27;) not if
        you&#x27;re cool and use patterns ;) Seriously, I belive patterns
        eliminate a further level of memorisation. I shall try a few solves of
        this method tomorrow and see what becomes of it. ~Thom

        Hey everyone, Let me just state from the start that my purpose in using
        this approach if for the 5x5x5 central edges. I&#x27;m not interested in
        making the new fastest approach for 3x3 edges ever, I don&#x27;t even
        know if it could be done. I like it because it uses fewer moves than my
        current approach for the 5x5x5 central edges. Ok with that disclaimer, I
        am going to show this on a 3x3x3 cube, even though it&#x27;s purpose is
        to be used on the 5x5x5. Do the scramble: L&#x27; B&#x27; F2 U&#x27; D2
        R B R B2 D2 U L2 U L R D F D&#x27; B R D2 R2 L&#x27; D&#x27; B After
        doing this scramble the edge permutation is even, so I will solve the
        edges ignoring the corners. To solve the edges with this new approach I
        am going to use freestlye commutators to perform 3 cycles, and each 3
        cycle will completely solve two pieces. Step 1: UB -> UR -> DR and UR
        needs to flip before cycling to DR. To do this I would do D&#x27; F U R
        E2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R E2 R&#x27; F&#x27; D I don&#x27;t care how this
        moves the DR edge to UB, all I care is to memorize how the DR edges ends
        up at UB. Ok so now I have solved UR and DR. Now I have UB -> DF -> DB
        and DF needs to flip before going to DB. To do this I would do U2
        B&#x27; L&#x27; M&#x27; U2 M D M&#x27; U2 M D&#x27; L B U2 Ok now I have
        DF and DB solved. Next I start with UB and continue. I have UB &lt;-> FR
        and UB needs to flip before going to FR. I&#x27;ll save this till the
        end instead of doing it now. Next I&#x27;ll start looking at UL and see
        how the cycles from there go. So I have UL -> DL -> FL and I need to
        flip UL before placing it in DL. To do this I would do: F&#x27; L&#x27;
        E L D&#x27; L&#x27; E&#x27; L D F Now I start over at UL and move on UL
        -> BR -> UF and I need to flip UL before placing in BR. To do this I do:
        F R S D2 S&#x27; U2 S D2 S&#x27; U2 R&#x27; F&#x27; Now I have that UL
        &lt;-> BL and I need to flip UL before placing in BL. So now I have two
        transpositions left, which I&#x27;ll do as two 3 cycles. So to do the
        first three cycle, I only need to solve 1 piece correclty. I&#x27;ll
        place UL -> BL -> FR and placing BL to FR will be my side effect. To do
        UL -> BL -> FR I do: E2 R U2 R&#x27; E2 R U2 R&#x27; Now all I have is
        UB -> FR -> UL and FL needs to flip before going to UB and UB needs to
        flip before going to FR. To do this I do: B U L B E2 B&#x27; U B E2
        B&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; -------- So step by step I did
        this: 1) D&#x27; F U R E2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R E2 R&#x27; F&#x27; D 2) U2
        B&#x27; L&#x27; M&#x27; U2 M D M&#x27; U2 M D&#x27; L B U2 3) F&#x27;
        L&#x27; E L D&#x27; L&#x27; E&#x27; L D F 4) F R S D2 S&#x27; U2 S D2
        S&#x27; U2 R&#x27; F&#x27; 5) E2 R U2 R&#x27; E2 R U2 R&#x27; 6) B U L B
        E2 B&#x27; U B E2 B&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; If you made it
        this far, first off congratulations, I don&#x27;t expect many people
        will have read this far. If you did read this far, my thoughts on this
        method are are that for the 5x5x5 central edges it is awesome. It is far
        fewer moves then first flipping and then moving edges. Also it will
        speed up my memorization in that I memorize the edge cycles by sticker
        to also include orientation as well as permutation. I guess my question
        is, should I memorize the cycles the same way as Stefan does, by
        stickers as well as by where the pieces go? Meaning I think that the U
        sticker of UB goes to the D sticker of DF rather than UB goes to DF?
        Also, I&#x27;ve been thinking about the setup moves, and because I can
        do the commutators any way I want, setup moves might only be to flip one
        edge, then do a usual commutator, then at the end unflip that edge. So
        setup moves might average about 3 per cycle, which is not bad. With a
        rigid system I think it will be very fast. So anyway, this is what
        I&#x27;m in the process of learning. Does any other 5x5 BLD&#x27;er have
        any comments? Also do any of you 3x3 guys have any interest in a system
        like this? My guess is not really, probably absolutely not for you top
        cubers, but I thought I would ask in case anyone is interested. Chris

        piece is always the UR edge (for edges) or the ULB corner (for corners).
        And I use setup moves to bring pieces to standard positions. Now imagine
        just the opposite, i.e. no fixed included pieces (cycling *any* three
        pieces) and no setup moves except necessary for a core cycle (in
        Chris&#x27;s case, an 8-move edges-cycle). So pretty much the shortest
        way to solve with 3-cycles. Cheers! Stefan

        Hi again Stefan. 1. Go to sleep. 2. I guess I just interpreted your
        method differently that you did yourself. And I don&#x27;t think
        that&#x27;s a bad thing! Solving 1 pieces at a time is efficient, but I
        am pretty sure solving 2 pieces at a time with your method will be just
        as easy as solving 2 pieces at a time with the traditional EO/EP
        methods, after enough practice, and it will be faster than solving 1
        piece at a time. The way you describe solving the edges sounds exactly
        like what I am working on... Allthough I haven&#x27;t been doing it for
        2 months now... I think it has great potential. I am just looking for a

        Yes.. Stefan, I know I am not very good with inner slice moves for Q.
        :). But I don&#x27;t ignore them.. I just don&#x27;t spot them very
        easily.. And yes, I could have also saved 2 moves by making a cube
        rotation, but I would not prefer to do that in a blindfold solve,
        because I find it confusing. And the first one is exactly the reason why
        I like the idea of free- style, but I also realise that too much freedom
        will slow me down (because I would have to think too much). That&#x27;s
        why I am more thinking of a method where UR is the &#x27;buffer&#x27;,
        the first target can be anything, and the setup moves depend on the
        second target... So the setup moves are always the same in similar
        situations... Go to sleep! ;) - Joël --- In

        Hi Stefan, You say the speed comes from simplicity. How ever.. I think
        you can devellop a procedure where you solve 2 edges at a time, and
        it&#x27;s still simple. You know, I remember something Ron told us at
        the yahoo group: When he say the idea of solving CE pairs for
        speedcubing, he wrote down &#x27;too hard to apply&#x27; next to it...
        Now, for most of the speedcubing population, solving a CE pair is a no-
        brainer. I really think that it&#x27;s possible to use your method to
        solve 2 edges at a time, without getting too difficult. - Joël. --- In

        Simple commutators will do it! And only 1 move setup is required. U

        Oooh Stefan, this was in fact what I was looking for as a response to
        this post. Also, I managed to do a successful blindfolded solve of my
        3x3 edges with this approach, and I can see how with practice this could
        be a very nice way to solve, even for the 3x3x3. I like the idea of
        using it for 5x5x5 for now since it uses many fewer moves than what I do
        now. I will definitely take a detailed look at your commutators and get
        an idea of how you are approaching this, thanks for the super detailed
        response! Chris P.S. I choose 28 as my number form 1-50 :-D Sorry about
        not replying sooner, I got caught up in either the speedsolving group or
        something else and forgot about that thread, but yes I am definitely
        interested in yuor new method! I choose 28 I choose 28!! --- In

        slow solves blindfolded, exactly like you described here: solving 2

        2 pieces at a time using 3 cycles... Maybe not optimal, but with easy
        setup-moves and fast algorithms. I&#x27;ll let you know when I have any
        succes :). Joël.

        You can do this actually, and is really isn&#x27;t that hard. I just got
        my first successful BLD solve of edges using an approach like you
        describe just a few minutes ago. See the thread &quot;Looking for advice
        for freestlying EO+EP&quot; and also Stefan&#x27;s response. This thread
        deals with exactly that, Stefan&#x27;s method only you solve two edges
        at a time instead of just one. Freestlye cycling is quickly becoming a
        favorite strategy of mine, though of course it&#x27;s downside is the
        thinking time. I spend probably 3 times as long as Stefan does thinking
        about my cycles, if not more. However, I try to make up for that by
        doing many fewer moves than he does. It&#x27;s all about what approach
        you like, both approaches are proven to be equally fast (Stefan and I
        raced eachother for 4x4x4 edges many many times, and got very similar
        averages as far as solving time goes). Chris

        I was thinking about standardising the moves a bit like this: The first
        sticker of the cycle is always UR. - If the second sticker is on the D
        face, setup the third sticker in the D face, and use the same standard
        commutator every time. (Like y M&#x27;U2 M D M&#x27;U2M D&#x27; y&#x27;)
        - If the second sticker in in the D layer (NOT D face), setup the third
        sticker in the D layer (not D face) and use a standerd commutator for
        this case every time. (Like M&#x27;UM D M&#x27;U&#x27;M D&#x27;) - ...
        Maybe I&#x27;ll even make large tables to describe all the cases and
        their solutions... But maybe you can also do it on the fly once you get
        used to it.. Anyways, I should go to sleep... Good luck! Joël.

        Hey Stefan, I just successfully tried a BLD solve on edges using this
        approach again and was able to use nicer moves more like what you are
        doing. I think I was thinking a bit too restrictive with my solves on
        that first attempt. I probably averaged about my usual 1.0-1.25 on setup
        turns by just trying to think of two edges already setup nicely, then
        maneuever the third edge into a good position as compared to the other
        two. Thanks for the heads up and making me think a bit more about these
        types of cycles. Also Joel, yes I think having a set strategy would be a
        very good idea. I found also that I do care how I cycle the third edge
        to UB, in that I have to keep all the edges oriented in the commutator
        such that my sticker of the third edge ends up as the U sticker of UB (I
        always start with UB, but it can be UR too). I think allowing more
        freedom, and being able to switch between the B and the U sticker of UB
        and make my cycles a little less rigid would be a good way to speed up
        this method. I would just have to know when the third edge is flipped
        when it is sent to UB (or UR for you) and when it is not. I think
        allowing that freedom for the third edge would make this metod even more
        powerful. Just some ideas to throw out, I&#x27;m starting to like this
        approach already. Can&#x27;t wait to try it out on an actual 5x5x5 BLD
        solve, but I need to be more comfortable with it on my 3x3x3 first.

        Hey everyone, Well I think I am finally starting to get the hang of
        visual memorization. I&#x27;ve been using it lately for the 3x3 and also
        for the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 edges. What I used to do was have an internal
        dialogue with myself &quot;this piece goes here, then the piece that is
        there goes over to here&quot;. When I first started I had even done that
        in addition to numbering each piece, but I didn&#x27;t even remember the
        numbers, I just numbered them so as to count all 12 edges which is not
        necessary. Well, tonight I just improved my 3x3x3 BLD record using this
        new technique, I got 1:48.12 which makes me very happy! I purposely did
        not allow myself to speak internally (my usual dialogue) during the
        memorization, except that I did use my usual names for shapes in the CO
        and EO steps. Also, I&#x27;ve found that I am getting a bit more
        accurate with big cube edges by simply trying to picture 3-4 pieces at a
        time for any given part of the cycle, rather than to say &quot;ok so if
        I am at lUB I go &#x27;short hop&#x27; to uFL then I move &#x27;far
        away&#x27; to bDR...&quot; etc. which is how I used to do things. I
        still have my names for different ways to move around the cube, in case
        the visual part is a bit weird, but I don&#x27;t use them as often.
        Again this is like changing the way that I read, it&#x27;s so
        fundamental to the way I think. So anyway, it feels weird to memorize
        this way, but it is definitely faster. Can&#x27;t wait until I get used
        to this. Thanks for showing me that my brain was broken! I&#x27;m glad
        to finally be on the right track to fixing it. What worries me though is
        actually trying to read in a visual sense rather than with an internal
        dialogue. I&#x27;ve been cubing for only 7 years, but I&#x27;ve been
        reading for about 17 so that&#x27;s quite a lot of bad habit to break.
        Thanks for the help guys! It is very much appreciated! Chris

        BLD method I&#x27;ve slept on it, and came up with a few ideas. Memorise
        a cycle of stickers, not cubies. Just need to get all the lead stickers
        on the same face and do a three-cycle, they can be on any face in any
        order, moves are also not restricted. Cycle with (F2UM&#x27;U2MUF2) and
        (F2U&#x27;M&#x27;U2MU&#x27;F2) or similar. Look at the patterns, if the
        cycle that returns to the piece returns to a sticker that is not the
        sticker of that at the start, the last edge in the cycle will need to be
        flipped with another flipped edge. Improvements; they don&#x27;t even
        have to be on the same face, a la the following: R U R&#x27; U&#x27; r
        R&#x27; U R U&#x27; r&#x27; r U R&#x27; U&#x27; r&#x27; R U R U&#x27;
        R&#x27; This lets you cycle around the LU, UF and UR stickers.
        &quot;this pattern ;)&quot; I&#x27;m not any good with making up algs on
        the fly, but if I learnt a lot of algs with multiple ways to cycle the
        pieces, I&#x27;m sure this could be very powerful. Note: the following
        is a baad way to go about it. On swapping two sets of two pieces; Just
        solve them pochmann style, the corners will be fine at the end, and if
        pieces from the two sets need to be flipped, they cancel, if not, the
        flipped piece will be the buffer. Then you can use the buffer as one of
        the flipped pieces from the end of another cycle. On swapping one set of
        pieces; Swap them with the set of buffer corners, if the cycle that
        returns to the piece returns to a sticker that is not the sticker of
        that at the start, on the one at the start of the cycle,, pick the
        sticker that is the one at the end of the cycle to be the one at the
        start, then at the end, the buffer piece will be flipped, leaving you to
        flip it with another piece, or just fix the flipped buffer. And
        remember, memorise the patterns :) So, in what ways can this be
        improved? I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t the best way to go about this, I
        doubt it&#x27;s even a good way, in fact ;) The bits where you ahve two
        pieces to swap are really bad. But this is all I could think of for now.
        Maybe it shouldbn&#x27;t be for a full method, maybe just for little
        bits here and there. Hey, at least I&#x27;m thinking. ~Thom

      <strong>318. Stefan&#x27;s M2 method</strong><br />

        Ok, so here&#x27;s my new method for permuting 3x3 edges, I call it
        &quot;M2 method&quot;. It&#x27;s very simple, fast, and 100% intuitive
        so you don&#x27;t need to learn a single alg for it. Of course it&#x27;s
        a 2-cycle method, one piece getting solved each time. The piece to be
        solved is at FD. Since I can&#x27;t just swap two pieces, I need to have
        some side effect. Here it is swapping (FU,BD)+(U,D)+(F,B) . Note FU and
        BD are solved relative to the M centers. Here&#x27;s an example solve,
        using scramble #28 from post #754 (http: //tinyurl.com/lytqj). It&#x27;s
        ready to be pasted into this page:
        http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/wrapplet.asp --------------------
        start -------------------- [Scramble] U2 D2 L&#x27; U D2 R2 L2 D R
        D&#x27; B2 U D&#x27; F2 R2 U&#x27; F2 R2 B2 [solve LU] (L U&#x27;
        L&#x27; U) M2 (U&#x27; L U L&#x27;) [solve LD] (U&#x27; L2 U) M2
        (U&#x27; L2 U) [solve RF] (U R U&#x27;) M2 (U R&#x27; U&#x27;) [solve
        RU] (R&#x27; U R U&#x27;) M2 (U R&#x27; U&#x27; R) [solve BD] M U2 M U2
        [solve LF] (U&#x27; L&#x27; U) M2 (U&#x27; L U) [solve RD] (U R2
        U&#x27;) M2 (U R2 U&#x27;) [solve FU] M U2 M U2 [solve RB] (U R&#x27;
        U&#x27;) M2 (U R U&#x27;) [solve LB] (U&#x27; L U) M2 (U&#x27; L&#x27;
        U) --------------------- end --------------------- For M2 I use
        Joel&#x27;s finger trick, i.e. L (l&#x27; M&#x27;), using my left ring
        finger to pull the M&#x27;. My left middle finger holds the B stickers
        of LB+LBD, so my ring finger is free for the M&#x27; and my index finger
        is free for U&#x27;. Oh, and actually it was a bad choice to have BU
        already solved. It&#x27;s the easiest to solve, it looks like: [solve
        BU] M2 So, how do you like it? Cheers! Stefan

        Cycle with (F2UM&#x27;U2MUF2) and (F2U&#x27;M&#x27;U2MU&#x27;F2) or

        Funny, with my old cycle method, I hated 12 cycles for the edges... Now
        I actually prefer them :). - Joël.

        already a lot of fun to do sighted :-) For blindsolving I&#x27;d
        probably use the full-cubie version (that&#x27;ll be my name for both
        permuting and orienting a cubie). It&#x27;s very similar, but instead of
        using U you use B, which should be done as U after cube rotation, e.g.
        [solve UR] x&#x27; (U&#x27; R U) M2 (U&#x27; R&#x27; U) x [solve BR] (l
        U&#x27; R&#x27; U) M2 (U&#x27; R U l&#x27;) > I am not really sure if I
        understand how the M slice edges are > handled... But it sure looks
        cool! - FD is the buffer and thus ignored - BU is solved with M2 - FU
        and BD are solved relative to the M centers either with (M U2 M U2) or
        (U2 M&#x27; U2 M&#x27;) Cheers! Stefan

        clarification: Of course you don&#x27;t just use B *instead* of U but
        you use it *additionally*. And actually I&#x27;d like to call the
        full-cubie version &quot;M2&quot; and the permute-only version
        &quot;M2p&quot;. I just wanted to demonstrate M2p first cause it&#x27;s

        After a while it&#x27;ll be easy to memorise. I find it so easy to
        recall, because you&#x27;re recalling something from the cube, not some
        numbers that convert to something on the cube. When i switched from
        numbers to &#x27;feeling&#x27; the patterns on the cube, I sped up my
        execution by a lot. Memorisation caught up later, but it&#x27;s all
        pretty nifty. I don&#x27;t have delays in my solving anymore at all.
        Also, it&#x27;s good for when you&#x27;re doing a new puzzle (like 4x4x4
        or 5x5x5) so that you don&#x27;t have to create new nouns or a new
        technique, I memorised the entire 4x4x4 with visualisation of patterns.
        Oh, now I switched to doing 3-cycles of solving permutation and
        orientation at once, when something comes up I can&#x27;t do, I
        don&#x27;t follow what I did in the earyer post and just fall back onto
        pochmann&#x27;s method. Also, if there&#x27;s a 3-cycle I can&#x27;t
        setup instantly, i can solve the next cubie and think of how I&#x27;ll
        setup the next 3-cycle while I solve the current 2-cycle. It&#x27;s a
        good little addition to the method I&#x27;m using. Which is now a mix of
        O then P for corners and 3-cycles and 2-cycles of O+P together for
        edges. ~Thom --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com, Joël

        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been working on memorizing visually again today,
        and here is what I have been trying. Rather than memorizing a sequence
        of instructions on how to follow a cycle, I try to picture the entire
        cycle all at one time. I picture vectors instead of lines for each cycle
        and I try to picture all of them at once, rather than think about each
        line individually. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that memorizing this way
        speeds up recall, since you are picturing the entire cycle all at one
        time, it&#x27;s easy to see what the next two pieces in your cycle will
        be since you&#x27;re thinking about all the pieces left at once. I
        really like memorizing this way! It still feels weird, since I am used
        to memorizing verbally, but I like it so far! Joel how&#x27;s it going
        for you? Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com, Joël

        doing the corners with visualisation a few times, and it seems to work
        fine.. Still have to get used to it, to get better accuracy. I so far
        only tried the corners (not the whole solve), and I got a lot of times
        in the 1:00 - 1:20 range. Well, for me that&#x27;s satisfying :).
        I&#x27;ll try to do some solves combining this with letters for the
        edges, and visualisation for the corners to see how that works. What I
        also noticed is that, allthough accuracy is not too good, I can do more

        Respected BLD solvers, I have written my own strategy for 3*3*3
        permutation memorisation. I feel memorising just 4 nouns will take much
        less time than the time you take to memorise the cornors permutation by
        anyother method. I agree that it takes time to master the phonetic sound
        and its value system. But once you are through with it, I won&#x27;t be
        surprised if the great blinders like Leyan, Tyson, Chris, Macky, Joel
        and others will be sub 1 min. Why not have a look at my page.

        That&#x27;s an interesting site. Mnemonics are a less painful way to
        memorise information. The down-side is that information has to become
        encoded in a visual way and then decoded later whereas rote memory is
        instant access to information. Someone was writing about seeing patterns
        the other day. And mnemonics are a way to memorise a range of moves for
        handling a particular pattern; but it sounds like a lot of people in
        this group are recognising patterns and doing fine without using
        mnemonics or at least, not using them for tackling patterns. And rote
        memorisation should always be faster than mnemonics. Having said that,
        your approach to using mnemonics is commendable. You are taking
        hard-to-learn material and making it easier to learn. Well done!! I am
        developing a mnemonics-based solution myself. Before putting on the
        blindfold, I want to have memorised edges and corners not where they are
        but where they soon will be. I don&#x27;t know if that is cheating. I
        want all green edge pieces to be in the middle tier early on. So I am
        thinking about the moves that will do that, then memorising those moves
        before allowing the blindfold to be put on. I have not listed the
        mnemonics but just the principles.

        I would like to recommend something to anybody who writes a blindfold
        solution and using notation familiar to cube enthusiasts: why not
        include a link early on to a site that gives a tutorial on that notation
        and language. And it is good to re-read your tutorial as if you are a
        reader who knows nothing about the cube. That is, unless your target
        audience is the cube enthusiast who now wants to go a step further. Mike

      <em>From:</em> smoothcuber &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br />

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey all, Plenty of interesting posts lately, nice to see. I thought I
        might as well post my way of doing the edge perms(already oriented) to
        see if anyone is doing something similar, and maybe someone will help me
        find improvements. It&#x27;s based on Carr&#x27;s beginner and
        intermediate methods, links to which are in speedsolving group message
        #17059. Sorry, this might get long and sound horrible, but that&#x27;s
        just because it&#x27;s harder to explain than do. The overall way is
        this: 1. Get middle edges to the middle layer. (E layer) 2. Finish
        solving middle layer. 3. Get U and D edges to their layers. 4. Solve U
        and D edges together in one. First, the edges are numbered, although I
        have converted those to a phonetic system, so I use sounds/letters now.
        So, UF=t,d; UB=n; UR=m; UL=r; DF=L; DB=sh,ch; DR=k; DL=f,v; FR=p,b;
        FL=s; BR=x; BL=y. It takes a while to learn those, but after a while you
        will see an edge and think of its sound/letter and not a number. Take a
        recent scramble: U2 D2 L&#x27; U D2 R2 L2 D R D&#x27; B2 U D&#x27; F2 R2
        U&#x27; F2 R2 B2. To memorize, I take two edges, make a word, then the
        next two edges, make another word, then combine those two words to get
        one image, and stick that image into a location. First, choose three
        locations; let&#x27;s say your front doorway, kitchen, and bedroom. So,
        starting in this case in the middle layer at FR, we have the UR edge=m;
        next to FL, we have DR edge=k. So, first word= mac(guy I know, or the
        comp., or big mac). Next, I go to BR, BL edge=y; BL, DF edge=l. Second
        word= yell. Combining the two words, I have mac yell (ing) in my front
        doorway. Continuing with the U layer in that way, we have at UF, BR
        edge=x; UB, UB edge=n; UR, DB edge=ch; UL, DL edge=f. So, again making
        two words and one image, I have Exxon(gas pump) with a chef next to it,
        in my kitchen. Doing the D layer in the same way, going from
        DF->DB->DR->DL, we get r+ s; t+ b, or a &quot;rose in a tub&quot; in my
        bedroom. When I go to recall, I start at my front doorway, and recall
        mac yelling, or m,k,y,l. So I know I have one middle edge already in the
        middle layer. I now try to get the other three middle edges to the
        middle layer. I do this one, two, three, or four edges at a time,
        depending on the setup. In this case, I would try to get the two middle
        edges from the D layer to the middle layer. I do this: First I 3-cycle
        the D edges to get the two mid edges opposite one another, so: x2 R2 UR
        UR&#x27; U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27; R&#x27;U R&#x27;. Now, this is what some
        may consider the hard part, but it really isn&#x27;t too bad(trust me).
        That is, the words change as you move edges around. So, we had rose-tub;
        after the 3-cycle, it became red-bus. Now, I move the mid edges from D
        to E layer: x F M U&#x27; M&#x27; U2 M2 U2 M&#x27; U M&#x27; F&#x27;
        x&#x27;. Once again, the words change; but now we can forget about FR
        and FL(solved); D layer is now: red-mac. Note that &quot;mac&quot;
        doesn&#x27;t change when it moves to the D layer. Next, the UF edge must
        go in BR, but first I move BR to BL with: y (U2 R2)*3 y&#x27;. That move
        changes a word on the U layer, exxon-chef becomes exxon-fish. Now, I put
        UF in BR with: U (M2 R&#x27;U&#x27; M2U2M2 U&#x27;R M2) U&#x27;. This
        move swaps UL position with BR and UF with UB, so the U words are now:
        lion-chef. Middle layer is done. Now I get U and D edges to their
        correct layers; in this case, in two moves. First: U2 M2 U&#x27;D M2
        U&#x27;D&#x27;. That swaps all four; note the words stay the same, just
        switching from U and D; so U is now red- mac, and D is lion-chef. Next:
        D&#x27;y (D2 M&#x27; D2 M) y&#x27; D. Now we have all edges on their
        correct layers; the U words are now: rod-man (Dennis), the D words are
        now: kill-chef. Note: no need to make images as the words-edges change
        position, verbal will be enough to recall. Finally, we solve U and D in
        one move from here; using U and/or D setup moves, there are 25 cases, 9
        of which one layer will already be solved, so really only 16 to learn.
        In this case: y&#x27; U2 (U M S U&#x27; S2 U&#x27; S M&#x27; U) U2. Once
        you get used to the letters/sounds, moving them around is not too bad
        since not too many move at one time, and they mostly move together, or
        swap back and forth. You only need images and the locations for the
        initial setup, and even then, you might be able to just verbalize and
        then recall. I find making images and using locations is effective when
        doing multiple cubes though. I would welcome any suggestions for
        improvements, better moves, etc. Thanks, -Dave O.

        1. First of all: I am very surprised to see my name in the list... Times
        in the 1:00-1:20 range were times where I only did the corners!! Whaha..
        So I am not a top-BLD cuber at all... I hope to get better, but I am not
        making any plans for world records :). 2. It&#x27;s funny this comes up
        now... I have thought about designing a method like this for every three
        cycle that I can get, but using Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s method. So in my
        case, there will be 440 cases... And many of them are very similar...
        Anyway, memorising mulitple pieces with one noun is interesting and
        efficient :). Bye! - Joël. --- In

        master the phonetic sound and its value system. But once you are through

        really just use B instead of U. And an x-rotation helps make it easy to
        twist. So for LF/FL I&#x27;d do: [solve LF] (U&#x27; L&#x27; U) M2
        (U&#x27; L U) [solve FL] x&#x27; (U L2 U&#x27;) M2 (U L2 U&#x27;) x The

        M - one move (out of L/L2/L&#x27;/R/R2/R&#x27;) to replace it with the
        target we really want - undo that first of the three moves to get the
        real target into M There are of course a few exceptions but this is the

        In case of odd parity, simply finish edges with this: (D&#x27; L2 D) M2
        (D&#x27; L2 D) This will fix the M-slice and leave (UB,UL) swapped,
        which is what I need for my regular method for solving corners. Cheers!

        Do these two mix well? I&#x27;ve read that drinking caffeine gives you a
        short boost in concentration and focus shortly after drinking a drink,
        but when the crash comes right after that it actually hinders your
        concentration. How long does the heightened concentration last from
        drinking caffeine, and is it worth it to consider drinking a coke or
        something right before a solve? Will it speed you up, and if yes will
        this be considered &quot;doping&quot; in a way for our sport? Chris

        --qqwref Actually, Chris, you should do at least a third run, one with a
        placebo, e.g. caffeine-free drink. Though make sure that you don&#x27;t
        know which is which, and that the taste doesn&#x27;t give you a hint. So
        maybe try drinks you don&#x27;t know yet. Or use something different,
        e.g. some caffeine powder mixed into the drink and some similar powder
        mixed into the other. Oh well, you get the idea. Is it
        &quot;doping&quot;? Well, what exactly is doping? And why are some
        things forbidden in other sports? Practice makes better. Wearing a
        sharkskin-like swimsuit may help swimming faster. Eating a banana might
        help. I think everyhing should be allowed, including things like
        caffeine, unless they&#x27;re harmful. Cause really, why should
        something be allowed if it helped make you better? Practice isn&#x27;t
        forbidden, either, is it? The only reason I see for forbidding things is
        if they&#x27;re harmful. Both to protect the single person but also to
        protect the community as a whole, to prevent others from feeling a need
        to do harm to themselves in order to keep up with others. And
        c&#x27;mon... worried about a coke??? Cheers! Stefan

        STReet) FRies SHRei RD STaFF Lo ReaLM. Ok so that is a pretty
        nonsensical phrase, but I break it down like this. &quot;TaCK THe BLue
        TRue Goo FLaSH&quot; is not hard to remember because of the
        alliteration, though it is meaningless. Just focus on the sounds.
        &quot;SPee BaCkLe ST (Mouth STReet)&quot; I picture as a street hotdog
        vendor on Speebackle St and they Fry hotdogs so much better than the
        staff of the hotdog stand on Shrei RD that they put them to shame (low
        realm). Again it sounds weird, but I think this would be much faster
        than memorizing visually. My question is that I highly doubt my
        number/sound correspondence is proven to work well. Is there one where I
        can utilize 24 distinct sounds that is proven by memory masters to work
        well? Are there better consonant clusters I can pick? I like this idea,
        but I want something that works. Chris

        Hello, With my rubik&#x27;s cube memory project, I want 1 image for any
        combination of 1234, 1243, 1324, etc. I often have situations where I
        have 4 edge pieces of the final layer and they need a memorised routine;
        or there are 4 corners in the wrong position and they need a memorised
        routine. What I have tried is to take the word &#x27;ROTA&#x27; and to
        make R = red = 1 O = orange = 3 T = white = 2 A = yellow 4 My final
        layer of the cube is the blue layer. Each of the 4 remaining edges is
        blue and one of the 4 colours listed. By that point, I think I need less
        than the 24 combinations of 1234. I made RTOA represent 1234 and I tried
        to make a word or phrase that sounds a bit like the first 3 letters. In
        this way, I made 24 images for the 24 combinations. I can associate each
        image with useful information now concerning the final edge moves of the
        cube or how to treat the cube in order to position some corners. Mike

        Hey everyone, I just read the link Marcus posted about the US memory
        championship. It sounds like I am using a similar method to how those
        guys memorize a deck of cards, just for centers with stories. However, I
        can&#x27;t memorize the centers in 45 seconds, and they could probably
        do it in 10-20. I think I know why, I memorize my stories audibly. I
        actually speak out the stories sometimes even, why is my brain broken
        and why do I not do things visually????? I&#x27;m going to try to
        memorize my stories silently (no internal dialogue) and just picture the
        elements of the story visually. My method could not even speak through
        52 cards in 45 seconds, because I would literally speak the words in my
        head. Now I&#x27;m just going to do it visually and see how it works.
        Why is my brain broken??? This auditory memorizing does not seem to cut
        it for superfast times, and my brain just seems to work that way,
        it&#x27;s like that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m wired to think and I&#x27;m
        trying to combat that. Arrrrgggghhh, so much to learn.. I feel like a
        complete beginner at this. Chris

        10:06 DNF off by 2 centers and 3 edges. Done with loud music playing.
        Visualizing the pictures for the center cycles rather than speaking the
        story works well. Also I&#x27;m still using rote memorization for the
        edges, but I tried to picture groups of 3-4 edges together. Also when
        solving I went REALLY fast to try to get through everything I memorized
        before I would forget it. I can see sub-10 possible now. I even used
        blocks here too, so it&#x27; not that hard to include a block too. It
        took me 5:18 to memorize this way, which is still a far cry from 2:30,
        but I can see how 2:30 is possible now. I memorized the centers in 3:08
        about (visually feels weird to me) and the edges I got in about 1:40 and
        the corners in about 30 seconds. Going to keep practicing this,
        I&#x27;ll post the next time I get a good solve, and hopefully it will
        be with this new way of memorizing visually. Chris --- In

        Hello, Yeah, that&#x27;s the same thing for me, I&#x27;m just a reader
        for now because I just started to learn a method for the 3x3x3
        blindfolded, after 5 years of cubing. I think the 3x3x3 won&#x27;t be so
        difficult with practice but the 5x5x5... maybe in the future ;-)
        That&#x27;s interesting also to read about memory challenges in this

      <strong>367. story method for 4x4 and 5x5 edges</strong><br />

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been doing some practicing tonight and I have
        noticed that I can memorize the centers of a 4x4x4 in about 1:30 on a
        really good attempt using the story method. Now there are fewer
        incorrect centers than incorrect edges, so I assume if I were well
        practiced for a story method for edges I could do maybe 2:00 and about
        30 seconds for the 2x2x2. That&#x27;s 4:00 right there. And the better I
        can&#x27;t at using this story idea that faster the centers and edges
        will become. I use my same set of nouns as from the 5x5x5 +centers so I
        don&#x27;t have to create a new one. To do this I need 6
        &quot;faces&quot; for the 24 edges, which as you can see is a bit weird
        to setup so I just use the 4 edges in each layer as my 4 pieces, and
        that gives me 6 faces of 4. I&#x27;m not used to thinking of the edges
        in these 6 &quot;faces&quot; yet so my memorization is a good deal
        slower this way, but I think with more practice it could speed up my
        edges to the level of my centers, it&#x27;s just that the cycles would
        be longer for the edge stories. One problem is that I can&#x27;t cycle
        systematically for the edges, I just have to follow the cycles. So to
        know which edges I haven&#x27;t used yet I have to count the number of
        edges in each cycle to make sure I don&#x27;t miss something. I do this
        by counting in base 5 with my feet. &quot;14&quot; In base 5 is
        &quot;24&quot; in decimal which is really convenient. So I have 5
        positions per foot (even though feet are relections of eachother I still
        do left side and right side of each foot as if I were looking at them,
        don&#x27;t reflect the directions for each foot.) 0 = do nothing 1 =
        pressure on the left side 2 = pressure on the right side 3 = press toes
        down hard 4 = lift toes up hard Doing this I can encode my cycles while
        also counting them without a &quot;mental dialogue&quot; which is the
        old way I used to memorize and is slower than I would like. I consider
        my right foot the ones digit and the left foot the 5&#x27;s digit. So
        say if I count a long cycle and count along and at the end my left foot
        is pressing toes down hard and my right foot is pressing hard right
        that&#x27;s a 17 cycle, so I need to account for 7 more pieces to
        memorize all 24. It sounds hard, but if I can memorize my edges as fast
        as my centers, or even close to it, I think getting used to base 5
        counting with my feet is a small price to pay. What do you all think?

        Sorry for the typos, I tend to get excited and hit post before really
        reading through. I meant that I use the 4 edges in each inner layer as a
        face. Also &quot;44&quot; in base 5 is &quot;24&quot; in decimal lol, no
        idea what I was thinking with &quot;14&quot; The more I think about
        this, the more I wonder whether it is better to count cycles by foot
        counting, or to go through and rehearse a cycle once while also counting
        it. I usually do the latter, but I would prefer to be able to do one
        time through memorization like for centers, so I think I may end up
        using the foot counting. It&#x27;s harder, but it allows me to do one
        time through memorization. I&#x27;m very open to ideas about this, this
        is all new territory and seems like it will take a lot of work. To
        answer one question in advance that I think might get asked, I think
        counting cycles is required for fast memorization for the edges. You
        can&#x27;t memorize a long cycle in a hurry and know whether you had 22
        or 23 or 24 elements in it. You have to have a precise way to know
        whether you have a 23 cycle and you are done memorizing, or whether you
        have a 22 cycle and you better hunt for that 2 cycle realy quickly.

        Oh wow I just thought of a huge problem with doing this idea, doing it
        means that when solving the 5x5 I can&#x27;t use my +centers set to go
        with my edges since then I would have two stories for two different
        parts of the cube which I could easily confuse parts from one with the
        other. Yeah maybe a sound-number system would be better. Aaaaaaah sorry
        for all the posts but I really am racking my brain for a faster way to
        memorize edges and don&#x27;t have any real ideas yet. Chris

        Dear Blindsolvers, Being a grand master of memory and seeing all your
        interest, esp.Chris Hardwick, I am spending sometime on this group
        nowadays. The first method what came to my mind is explained here. It
        can be used for both CENTERS and EDGES. Hope you will appreciate my
        effort, though the method is not ok to you. PERSON, ACTION &amp; OBJECT
        METHOD :- 1). Name all the 24 center pieces in alphabetical order(A to
        X). Assign a person&#x27;s name (nouns) whom you know very well. 2).
        Think of an action (verbs) for every person, say kicking, killing,
        milking, washing, blowing, sucking etc 3). Select an object for all the
        24 pieces again in the alphabetical order(A to X). 4). That is
        person/action/object for each piece. A person doing an action on an
        object is easy to vizualise and the action and object are already well
        known to you, the time taken here is much less than that of in story
        method. 5). How to associate is the beauty here. The person of the first
        piece should be associated with the action of the second piece followed
        by the object of the third piece. example :- 283. For number 2, the
        person name starting with B is BUSH, for number 8, the action of the 8th
        person(Hitler) is KILLING and for the number 3, the object is CAT. BUSH
        KILLING CAT. This can be vizualised as a picture much faster than story
        method using nouns. 6). In your memorisation, you are memorising
        continuously and after every cycle (ABC) you have to adjust your
        thinking for the next cycle(ADE), (AFG)etc. Every time you have to break
        your chain in the story you framed already. It restricts your flow of
        solving.You must have experienced it, haven&#x27;t you ? Here is my
        suggestion. Instead of memorising all the centers contnuously in 2
        cycles, you can memorise them in 12 cycles(considering all the 24 pieces
        are to be solved). Example :- cycle-1:-
        2,8,9,13,4,6,17,24,12,23,11,10,21 cycle-2:-
        3,7,5,1,19,16,13,18,14,15,20,22 Memorise cycle-1 as:-
        (2,8,9),(2,13,4),(2,6,17),(2,24,12),(2,23,11),(2,10,21) Memorise cycle-2
        as:- (3,7,5),(3,5,1),(3,19,16),(3,13,18),(3,14,15),(3,20,22).
        7).Storing(fixing) the picture in your brain:- This is the part I think
        all the blind solvers are not using except bernett and
        Stefan(hahaha....and of course me?!?). This helps you to avoid
        checking(revising) your memorisation after memorising it once. This is
        called journey method. For memorising 12 cycles, maximum you need is 12
        locations. Example:- you select your house. Think of the order in which
        things are placed in your house. Say, 1).entrance door 2).Sofa 3).TV
        4).Computer 5). Study table 6).dining table etc. Mentally rerun the
        locations in your mind again and again until it is very familiar to you.
        Now when you memorise the first cycle BUSH KILLING CAT, fix this picture
        or imagine this event happening in the first location of your
        house-ENTRANCE DOOR. Fix or imagine the second cycle event BUSH MILKING
        DOG (2,13,4)in the second location of your house-SOFA. 8)So, what should
        you do now:- (a).It might take few hours for you to prepare the 24
        persons, 24 actions and 24 objects for all the 24 center pieces.
        (b).Then you must get used to them to get the exact place of the piece
        for all of them. (c).Prepare a journey with 12 locations and master them
        in the same order 9). Try yourself and experience it 10).Share your
        thoughts, ideas, ADVANTAGES, DISADVANTAGES and difficulties. Have fun,
        John Louis P.S:- My next memorisation method for 4*4*4 is based on
        phonetic sound and its value. I am thinking on this line. Plz wait for
        some more time. --------------------------------- Jiyo cricket on Yahoo!

        Hi John, It&#x27;s funny.. I already have a system with 24 letters for
        memorising the edges (with Pochmann&#x27;s method), and a while ago, I
        was thinking of doing exactly this (person action and object)!! And then
        yesterday, I saw some people who memorise card decks also do this :). So
        it makes me more motivated to actually try this soon, allthough I am
        also working on an other memorisation method. BTW, what kind of words
        are you using? Bush? Hitler? :p.. Okok, as long as you can memorise it
        well, it&#x27;s ok :). Thanks for all your help and you tips. I will try
        this person, action and object method soon now! By the way, the names of
        the persons, would they all have to have a unique first letter (A to X)?

        Hey Stefan, That is a really good idea, I hadn&#x27;t thought of that. I
        think using a journey method would be much better than a freestyle
        method for the 4x4 and 5x5 edges, since you can&#x27;t apply any sort of
        system to how you cycle them. The centers is a bit different I think,
        with a picture system, it&#x27;s really easy to know whether you&#x27;ve
        already used a piece from a face and which one. When I cycle back to
        orange say (places), I don&#x27;t think of the pieces as orange pieces
        anymore, I just think &quot;have I been to the south pole yet? ...
        yeah.. I&#x27;ve already crashed a plane into the classroom, so that one
        is in there. The Giant Hamster already rampaged in my old neighborhood
        so that one&#x27;s there, ok yeah I need to go to Germany now.&quot; I
        can see how using a subject action verb system would allow you to know
        whether you&#x27;ve hit a face already and how many times, just keep a
        hierarchy still for each face. Chris --- In

        Hey John Louis, Thanks so much for helping us with memory techniques! I
        know it is very much appreciated by a number of us, so thank you again!
        I have one question though about the journey method. I can definitely
        see how using the journey method for 4x4 and 5x5 edges is a really good
        idea because of what Stefan said, that it allows you the ability to
        count the number of cycles by knowing the number of your places in the
        journey method. Also what happens if you have an odd cycle? Say you have
        (1 5 6 7 9 4) that could be Aaron Escapes Feather - then Aaron Glues
        Image - Aaron Destroys ... How would you handle the missing object? I
        can imagine Aaron trying to Destroy the air and being frustrated that
        there is no object, that would make the story funny and also the absence
        of an object would tell me the last cycle is a 2 cycle. Would that work?
        Also I have a question about how I am using my stories. If the Person
        verb object method, combined with the journey method, is faster I would
        very much like to switch to it. However if there is any way I can
        salvage the current system I have in any form I would like to do that
        too. For the centers I do everything via cause and effect. I make sure
        that the next item in the story is directly caused by the one before it.
        I also use a sentence structure sometimes which allows me to combine a
        number of words into one sentence like idea. So if I have (Larry ->
        rubber duckie -> airplane) and I wanted to use cause and effect I would
        have Larry push a rubber duckie with his finger, and this would turn on
        a homing device showing the airplane where they are and it flies over
        head. If I wanted to use a sentence structure I would think &quot;Larry
        pets a rubber duckie while on an airplane&quot;. (Think Golom with the
        one ring.. &quot;my precioussssssssssss&quot;) I wouldn&#x27;t think
        those words, I would just picture Batman in an airplane seat petting the
        rubber duckie and just know that Batman is perferming an action on the
        rubberduckie in the place airplane. I do that a lot too, subject object
        place and I add my own verb between the subject and object. Again, if
        this is slower please let me know and I&#x27;ll scrap it, or save it for
        the 6x6x6 only or something and learn the journey method and the
        subject-verb-object method for the 4x4 and 5x5. Sorry to bombard you
        with so many question, but thanks so much for all the help you&#x27;re
        giving us! Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        In your memorisation, you are memorising continuously and after every

        them in 12 cycles(considering all the 24 pieces are to be solved). >
        Example :- cycle-1:- 2,8,9,13,4,6,17,24,12,23,11,10,21 > cycle-2:-

        Stefan(hahaha....and of course me?!?). This helps you to avoid
        checking(revising) your memorisation after memorising it once. This is
        called journey method. For memorising 12 cycles, maximum you need is 12
        locations. > Example:- you select your house. Think of the order in

        Hi Stefan, It is further improved and the current record for card
        memorisation is 30.xy sec by Ben Pridmore (using stackmat, I think). The
        rules for card memorisation and recalling is completely different from
        memorising and solving cube blindfolded. For cards memorisation the
        maximum time given is 5 min. Even if you finished memorising in 30+ sec,
        you have to wait for the entire 5 min, of course without looking back
        the card physically. So, you have 4 min 30 sec left to revise or recall
        mentally what you memorised in that 30 sec. Then while recalling you
        need not recall mentally. Instead you are given a new pack of card and
        you have to rearrange the pack in the same order you have memorised in 5
        min. Recalling time is not counted at any cost and only memorisation
        time is taken. Here while rearranging, if you forget anything you need
        not panic. Instead you can go ahead leaving that position vaccant until
        you arrange the rest of the cards. Sometime you may be left with 4 or
        5cards also. Now looking at the cards left, we can easily find out where
        they fit in from the vague picture of the card in our mind. Such chances
        are not possible in blindfold solving!! My official personal best is
        77.xy sec for cards(limca bookof records) and unofficial best is 48.xy
        sec. My unofficial 3*3*3 Bld solving is 6 min xy sec. www.andibell.net
        is not available for more than a year now. John Louis Stefan Pochmann

        Hi John Louis, What&#x27;s a 4 level system? >To get an idea of the
        times that might be possible for memorising a >cube, let&#x27;s compare
        with memorising a deck of cards. Most people >memorise a deck of cards
        using one image per card. At 52 seconds for >a deck this is 1 second per
        image. If we can match that speed for a >cube, we would take 24 seconds
        with a level 2 system, 16 seconds with >a level 3 system, and 12 seconds
        with a level 4 system. Would this be something like SVOP for subject
        verb object place? Or are there two objects, or two subjects? Or subject
        verb adverb object? Or subject verb adjective object? Or a mix? If there
        is a way to encode 4 pieces at a time for memorizing a cube, that has me
        very interested. That would require only 6 pictures max (and of course a
        great deal of work before hand to be able to do that). I think it would
        be a great deal of work, but would allow for some fast times for
        memorizing a cube. How exactly do the systems Simon described work?

        all. >I have one question though about the journey method. I can
        definitely see how using the journey method for 4x4 and 5x5 edges is a
        really good idea because of what Stefan said, that it allows you the
        ability to count the number of cycles by knowing the number of your
        places in the journey method. yes, he is perfectly correct. >Also what
        happens if you have an odd cycle? Say you have (1 5 6 7 9 4) that could
        be Aaron Escapes Feather - then Aaron Glues Image - Aaron Destroys ...
        How would you handle the missing object? I can imagine Aaron trying to
        Destroy the air and being frustrated that there is no object, that would
        make the story funny and also the absence of an object would tell me the
        last cycle is a 2 cycle. Would that work? That is correct. It works
        perfectly ok. I always use curtain to end it all instead of air in your
        example. A visual picture is always better. >Also I have a question
        about how I am using my stories. If the Person verb object method,
        combined with the journey method, is faster I would very much like to
        switch to it. However if there is any way I can salvage the current
        system I have in any form I would like to do that too. For the centers I
        do everything via cause and effect. I make sure that the next item in
        the story is directly caused by the one before it. I also use a sentence
        structure sometimes which allows me to combine a number of words into
        one sentence like idea. So if I have (Larry -> rubber duckie ->
        airplane) and I wanted to use cause and effect I would have Larry push a
        rubber duckie with his finger, and this would turn on a homing device
        showing the airplane where they are and it flies over head. If I wanted
        to use a sentence structure I would think &quot;Larry pets a rubber
        duckie while on an airplane&quot;. (Think Golom with the one ring..
        &quot;my precioussssssssssss&quot;) I wouldn&#x27;t think those words, I
        would just picture Batman in an airplane seat petting the rubber duckie
        and just know that Batman is perferming an action on the rubberduckie in
        the place airplane. I do that a lot too, subject object place and I add
        my own verb between the subject and object. Even in your cause and
        effect association you use some action verb like PUSH( you are really
        pushing everyone in this group)TURN, PET etc. Is itn&#x27;t? My question
        is why not you use the same to memorise one more piece? Thats why I feel
        this method PERSON/ACTION/OBJECT method is slightly advantageous.
        >Again, if this is slower please let me know and I&#x27;ll scrap it, or
        save it for the 6x6x6 only or something and learn the journey method and
        the subject-verb-object method for the 4x4 and 5x5. Initially it may
        appear bit slower than your usual method. But once you master the P/A/O
        and the location of pieces and journeys become habitual, you can really
        see the advantages of this method. Now, you have to put it into use and
        let us know the result - faster or slower. >Sorry to bombard you with so
        many question, but thanks so much for all the help you&#x27;re giving
        us! Not at all bombarding. It is my pleasure reciprocating what Stefan

        thinking you can use either SVO or journey but not both. Why? I&#x27;ve
        been using SO+journey for quite a while now and I like it. Also, Andi
        Bell (and I guess many others) make a mental SVO scene and picture it on
        one location of the journey. So 17 locations for a deck of 52 cards (if
        you memorize the last card just in short term memory). Cheers! Stefan

        Would this be something like SVOP for subject verb object place? Or are
        there two objects, or two subjects? Or subject verb adverb object? Or
        subject verb adjective object? Or a mix? If there is a way to encode 4
        pieces at a time for memorizing a cube, that has me very interested.
        That would require only 6 pictures max (and of course a great deal of
        work before hand to be able to do that). I think it would be a great
        deal of work, but would allow for some fast times for memorizing a cube.

        In your memorisation, you are memorising continuously and after every
        cycle (ABC) you have to adjust your thinking for the next cycle(ADE),
        (AFG)etc. Every time you have to break your chain in the story you
        framed already. It restricts your flow of solving.You must have
        experienced it, haven&#x27;t you ? Here is my suggestion. Instead of
        memorising all the centers contnuously in 2 cycles, you can memorise
        them in 12 cycles(considering all the 24 pieces are to be solved). >
        Example :- cycle-1:- 2,8,9,13,4,6,17,24,12,23,11,10,21 > cycle-2:-

        (2,8,9),(2,13,4),(2,6,17),(2,24,12),(2,23,11),(2,10,21) > Memorise
        cycle-2 as:- > (3,7,5),(3,5,1),(3,19,16),(3,13,18),(3,14,15),(3,20,22).

        think all the blind solvers are not using except bernett and
        Stefan(hahaha....and of course me?!?). This helps you to avoid
        checking(revising) your memorisation after memorising it once. This is
        called journey method. For memorising 12 cycles, maximum you need is 12
        locations. > Example:- you select your house. Think of the order in
        which things are placed in your house. Say, 1).entrance door 2).Sofa
        3).TV 4).Computer 5). Study table 6).dining table etc. Mentally rerun
        the locations in your mind again and again until it is very familiar to
        you. > Now when you memorise the first cycle BUSH KILLING CAT, fix this

        Your question was to John and he probably has better knowledge and
        vocabulary, but here are my thoughts anyway. There are two different
        levels of levels. I&#x27;d like to call one static and the other
        dynamic. Imagine you want to memorize a sequence of 60 digits. You could
        translate each single digit into an image, this requires learning 10
        static translations and you&#x27;d have a sequence of 60 images. But
        that&#x27;s a waste, it&#x27;s much better to learn 100 static
        translations and encode each digit pair as one image, resulting in 30
        images. You could go further and learn 1000 images to encode digit
        triples to get 20 images, but that&#x27;s quite some work before you can
        start playing. Besides these static levels you can also dynamically
        combine several images into one scene, for example three images using
        the SVO pattern. I call it dynamic because you don&#x27;t
        &quot;learn&quot; an encoding for the combinations, but instead make
        them up on the fly when you encounter them. Using static level-2 and
        dynamic level-3 let&#x27;s you memorize 60 digits in 10 scenes. It
        requires preparing and learning 100 images and a journey of 10
        locations. Cheers! Stefan

      <strong>388. 3*3*3 corner perms in two</strong><br />

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey all, It&#x27;s pretty fun to do corner perms in two moves(ok, with U
        and D setup moves too). Sometimes it can be quite fast; of course other
        times it&#x27;s more difficult. Anyhow, here it is: Move 1: Get all U
        corners to the U layer so that the U layer permutation is even. Move 2:
        Solve U and D corners in one move (using U and D setup moves, and
        possibly needing to exchange two edge pieces(if the D perm is odd)) Take
        first a simple example: Do on a solved cube: R&#x27;BR&#x27; F2
        RB&#x27;R2B&#x27;R F2 R&#x27;BR&#x27; to setup. Obviously, this could be
        solved with two quick corner 3-cycles. But it could also be solved in
        one move: x&#x27; RU&#x27;R D2 R&#x27;UR2UR&#x27; D2 RU&#x27;R x. To do
        the first move, there are these possible situations: 1.) 4 or 3 D
        corners are on the U layer 2.) 2 D corners are on the U layer, and they
        are diagonal one another (UFR-UBL or UFL-UBR) AND the 2 U corners on the
        D layer are adjacent one another (DFR-DFL,etc.). 3.) 2 D corners are on
        the U layer, diagonal one another AND the 2 U corners on the D layer are
        diagonal one another (DFR-DBL or DFL-DBR). 4.) 2 D corners are on the U
        layer, adjacent one another (ex. UFR- UFL) AND the 2 U corners on the D
        layer are adjacent one another. 5.) 2 D corners are on the U layer,
        adjacent one another AND the 2 U corners on the D layer are diagonal one
        another. 6.) 1 D corner is on the U layer. 7.) All corners are already
        on their correct layers. For #1, I do z2 giving me 1 or no D corners on
        the U layer (Stefan&#x27;s idea a while back), and use M2 S M2 S&#x27;
        to correct the centers later. (ok, this could be counted as a third
        move). For #2, I use: y&#x27;x RURU&#x27; (R&#x27;URU&#x27;)*2 R2
        x&#x27;y For #3, I use: FR&#x27; (U&#x27;RUR&#x27;)*2 U&#x27;RU F&#x27;
        For #4, I use: (FU2M2U2)*2 or r&#x27;U&#x27;z&#x27;(U&#x27;RUR&#x27;)*3
        ryL For #5, I use: y&#x27;x R&#x27;U&#x27; (R&#x27;URU&#x27;)*2
        R&#x27;UR2 x&#x27;y For #6, I use: x (R&#x27;URU&#x27;)*3 x&#x27; or
        x&#x27;z&#x27; (R&#x27;URU&#x27;)*3 zx Of course, you might need to turn
        U and/or D to setup for those moves. Also, you need to setup so that the
        U layer becomes an even perm. So, after you have done the first move,
        and all corners are on their correct layers, it&#x27;s easy enough to
        solve each layer by itself. But they can also be solved in one, using U
        and D setup moves. To solve U and D together, I&#x27;ve worked out 50
        cases, 14 of which one or both layers will already be solved. You need
        to have a starting position for each layer, so you might need to move U
        and/or D to setup for the move. Example: If I have a 3-cycle on U and a
        3-cycle on D, I always line up the solved corners at UBL and DBL. There
        are 10 possible setups: solved, 3-cycle clockwise, 3-cycle
        counterclockwise, 4 corner adjacent swap, 4 corner diagonal swap, 2
        corner adjacent swap, 2 corner diagonal swap, 4-cycle clockwise, 4 cycle
        counterclockwise, and what I call the z formation. If the D layer
        corners are odd, then the move I use swaps 2 edges also. Sample moves:
        3-cycle + &quot;z&quot;: R2D2R2 F2D&#x27;R2 y&#x27; R2DR2D2 y R2D&#x27;
        4 corner adjacent swap + Adjacent swap: y&#x27;R2(U&#x27;R2)*3 U2B2R2 y
        U&#x27;R2U F2R2 Example corner solve: Do: F&#x27;L&#x27;U&#x27;R
        F&#x27;B&#x27;L&#x27;UL&#x27;DF&#x27;L&#x27;F&#x27;UR&#x27;L&#x27;D2U&#x27;
        Move 1: y&#x27;x RURU&#x27; (R&#x27;URU&#x27;)*2 R2 x&#x27;y Move 2:
        U&#x27;D (U2F2 R2U R2U R2 y&#x27; U&#x27;R2 U&#x27;R2 y U&#x27;R2)
        D&#x27;U Note that move 2 also swaps edges FR-FL. Suggestions for
        improvements are most welcome; sorry for any typos or errors. Thanks,

        I&#x27;d be interested to hear how everyone memorizes these; I often
        have a bit of trouble. I start on the top layer, and look for unoriented
        edges, then go to the middle layer and do the same, and then the bottom
        layer. If there are 8 or 10 unoriented, do you guys try to remember
        those, or the 4 or 2 oriented ones? I do the latter, which sometimes
        causes problems, because as I go from top to middle to bottom layers,
        whether there are 8 or more or fewer than 8 is still in doubt. In other
        words, sometimes I look at all three layers before realizing there are 8
        or 10, then I have to backtrack to find the 4 or 2 oriented ones. Any
        suggestions for improvement? Thanks, -Dave O.

        Dear Chris, Here is my opinion about 4 level or 5 level system. 1).First
        of all, as you think it may reduce number of locations in a journey. But
        the time taken to memorise a 4 level may be twice or more as that of 3
        level system. 2).Then it becomes too much of prepared set of words and
        you have to search to find the words. Again it takes more time to
        memorise.More information in one location will be conjested and affects
        quick recall. 3).You have to realise why memory athletes are going for 4
        level and 5 level system. They are increasing it for want of journey,
        because they want to memorise 2400 random numbers, 3600 binary digits
        etc. In blindfold cubing, you don&#x27;thave to memorise so much
        numbers. 4).In memory sports, 3 hours time is there(1 hr to memorise + 2
        hrs to recall).It is a marathan, where as blindfold cubing is a sprint.
        You can not afford to loose a second. 5).In number sprint, many memory
        arhletes are using only P/A. Dominic , 8 times world champion has
        confirmed me this last time when I met him. 6).He has developed a system
        to prepare person for all the numbers from 00 to 99. Since my mother
        tongue is not English and the persons are alien to me, I have developed
        my own system using my mother tongue Tamil. If you are interested I
        shall mail you his system. But it is better to prepare your own. 7).I am
        working on 3*3*3 as well. Bernett is just explaining me how he memorises
        and blindsolves 3*3*3 by orientation and permutation method.(I know only
        Stefan&#x27;s method). John Louis cmhardw &lt;foozman17@...> wrote: Hi
        John Louis, What&#x27;s a 4 level system? >To get an idea of the times

        verb object place? Or are there two objects, or two subjects? Or subject
        verb adverb object? Or subject verb adjective object? Or a mix? If there
        is a way to encode 4 pieces at a time for memorizing a cube, that has me
        very interested. That would require only 6 pictures max (and of course a
        great deal of work before hand to be able to do that). I think it would
        be a great deal of work, but would allow for some fast times for
        memorizing a cube. How exactly do the systems Simon described work?

        beauty here. The person of the first piece should be associated with the
        action of the second piece followed by the object of the third piece. >
        example :- 283. For number 2, the person name starting with B is BUSH,

        vizualised as a picture much faster than story method using nouns. > 6).
        In your memorisation, you are memorising continuously and after every
        cycle (ABC) you have to adjust your thinking for the next cycle(ADE),
        (AFG)etc. Every time you have to break your chain in the story you
        framed already. It restricts your flow of solving.You must have
        experienced it, haven&#x27;t you ? Here is my suggestion. Instead of
        memorising all the centers contnuously in 2 cycles, you can memorise
        them in 12 cycles(considering all the 24 pieces are to be solved). >
        Example :- cycle-1:- 2,8,9,13,4,6,17,24,12,23,11,10,21 > cycle-2:-
        3,7,5,1,19,16,13,18,14,15,20,22 > Memorise cycle-1 as:- >
        (2,8,9),(2,13,4),(2,6,17),(2,24,12),(2,23,11),(2,10,21) > Memorise
        cycle-2 as:- > (3,7,5),(3,5,1),(3,19,16),(3,13,18),(3,14,15),(3,20,22).
        > 7).Storing(fixing) the picture in your brain:- This is the part I
        think all the blind solvers are not using except bernett and
        Stefan(hahaha....and of course me?!?). This helps you to avoid
        checking(revising) your memorisation after memorising it once. This is
        called journey method. For memorising 12 cycles, maximum you need is 12
        locations. > Example:- you select your house. Think of the order in
        which things are placed in your house. Say, 1).entrance door 2).Sofa
        3).TV 4).Computer 5). Study table 6).dining table etc. Mentally rerun
        the locations in your mind again and again until it is very familiar to
        you. > Now when you memorise the first cycle BUSH KILLING CAT, fix this
        picture or imagine this event happening in the first location of your
        house-ENTRANCE DOOR. > Fix or imagine the second cycle event BUSH

        Hi John Louis, Thanks again so much for your help. I really do
        appreciate it, and I know a number of us here do as well. I do have one
        more question for you, I seem to never end with them do I? :-) For
        memorizing with P/A/O I feel that it would be best to memorize 3 pieces
        at a time to speed up the memorization. This presents an issue with
        solving. Say I have Bellboy Arrests Cat at my first location, then Dan
        Throws Umbrella at my next location. As cycles this is (Bellboy Arrests
        Cat) followed by (Bellboy Dan Throws) followed by (Bellboy Umbrella
        ....) etc. My stories as I use them now are often interrupted in weird
        places by my cycles, but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me, the speed at
        which I can memorize is well worth having to break up my encoding in
        weird locations. I think this will be the case for P/A/O as well. I do
        not like idea of memorizing as: Bellboy Arrests Cat at my first
        location, then Bellboy Destroys Tree then Bellboy uproots ..... I think
        this will be too slow to add 2 pieces into a picture each time, and
        always use the first spot (here Bellboy) in each picture. What do you
        think? I prefer to encode three unique items per picture, and just have
        the encoding by interupted in weird locations by the cycles, I already
        do this with my stories and am comfortable with it. I am very curious
        what you think though. Chris --- In

        Dear Chris, 1). If you have 3 different P/A/O in every location and very
        comfortable with decoding at weird places, that is fine. In my opinion
        it slows down your solving speed. (Something like solving cross slowly
        in order to look ahead 1st F2L piece is better than solving cross faster
        and stops to find first F2L). 2).Since you got used to that, you feel
        comfortable. But, I think it slowsdown solving speed. 3). If you have
        same person in each location doing differnt action on different object
        is much easier to remember and your thoughts will be fluent. You will
        not and need not stop solving to think. 4). In worst case, if you are
        not able to retrive the person in a particular location quickly, you
        will be in trouble in the system you are following already. If you have
        the same person in each location, the retrivel will be much easier. 5).
        It is all just my opinion. You have to try both to come to a decision.
        Warning! first master the P/A/O before taking decision. Good luck John

        much for your help. I really do appreciate it, and I know a number of us
        here do as well. I do have one more question for you, I seem to never
        end with them do I? :-) For memorizing with P/A/O I feel that it would
        be best to memorize 3 pieces at a time to speed up the memorization.
        This presents an issue with solving. Say I have Bellboy Arrests Cat at
        my first location, then Dan Throws Umbrella at my next location. As
        cycles this is (Bellboy Arrests Cat) followed by (Bellboy Dan Throws)
        followed by (Bellboy Umbrella ....) etc. My stories as I use them now
        are often interrupted in weird places by my cycles, but that
        doesn&#x27;t matter to me, the speed at which I can memorize is well
        worth having to break up my encoding in weird locations. I think this
        will be the case for P/A/O as well. I do not like idea of memorizing as:
        Bellboy Arrests Cat at my first location, then Bellboy Destroys Tree
        then Bellboy uproots ..... I think this will be too slow to add 2 pieces
        into a picture each time, and always use the first spot (here Bellboy)
        in each picture. What do you think? I prefer to encode three unique
        items per picture, and just have the encoding by interupted in weird
        locations by the cycles, I already do this with my stories and am
        comfortable with it. I am very curious what you think though. Chris ---

        It&#x27;s interesting to read all the memory experts&#x27; advice, and
        it&#x27;s great to have one among us here in John Louis. I am a total
        amateur memorizer, but have used the phonetic+journey techniques now for
        the cube for almost 4 years, so I can relate what I as an amateur have
        experienced. I&#x27;ve known of many of these techniques for 15 years or
        so, since first reading Lorayne&#x27;s book. I started blindfold cubing
        in July 2002, after learning from Richard Carr. Since I already knew the
        phonetic and journey systems, I could see how they might apply to
        memorizing a cube blindfold. Since then, I have tried many ways to
        memorize the cube; as yet none has felt as comfortable as the way I
        mentioned in my previous posts. I&#x27;m a terrible visualizer (rote?)
        cube memorizer, but I guess I use some of that when memorizing the
        orientations when solving one cube - but never with the perms. I&#x27;m
        very impressed with those who can visualize shapes, etc; for me it is
        just too hard. At first I linked images together; later seeing that that
        was too slow, I changed to the journey system. I also tried once making
        a list of persons-actions-objects, but was not comfortable with persons,
        since they seemed too much the same to me after a while, and also my
        solving style doesn&#x27;t well accomodate taking 3 pieces at once; I
        found 2 pieces easier for me. The phonetic + journey system works well
        for doing multiple cubes blindfold; and to answer John Louis, it&#x27;s
        what I used for all my multiple cube attempts (I also used it for all
        the orientations). Indeed, multiple cubes done this way are not
        &quot;hard&quot; (if an average guy like me can do it, that&#x27;s some
        good evidence of the power of the systems). I only did 10 cubes for the
        fun of it, obviously many guys could do many more. -Dave O.

        When you are imagining P/A/O, you need not force yourself. Instead you
        can use one of the following or all. 1).Exaggerate the size
        2).Exaggerate the numbers 3).Subsitute and vizualise the entire P/A/O in
        colours. Chris,Joel - a warning for you both. If you memorise a cube in
        a journey applying all the above priciples, then you can not use the
        same journey for memorising your next cube atleast for a day. It is
        because you will be having the picture you have stored in the location
        remains atleast for a day. When you memorise the next cube, the previous
        one interferes. Thats why mentally tune yourself to prepare more
        journeys. Same journeys you can you to memorise your college subjects as
        well!!! (Once I had 25 journeys each with 52 locations , 30 journeys
        with 20 locations, 50 jurneys with 10 locations) Have fun John Louis

        Euro2004 I could still remember the whole cube, even though I
        hadn&#x27;t recalled it again in the meantime. A full month after the
        solve and still without further recall (except that one time two days
        after the solve) I tried again and I still knew maybe 70-80%. Oh well,
        in that case I didn&#x27;t even try to &quot;overwrite&quot; the old
        data with a new solve, so I can&#x27;t tell how well that would&#x27;ve
        worked. Also, it was the very first time I used that journey and I had
        built it mostly in the hour before the attempt, so that cube had a very
        strong binding with that journey... Cheers! Stefan

        the other hand... I&#x27;m quite sure I&#x27;ve used the same journey
        for 3x3 blindsolving several times on one day. For my average-of-10 I
        used a journey of around 60 locations and when I got to the end I
        continued at the start again. I think I used the first few locations for
        three cubes in those two hours. Cheers! Stefan

        Hi John! I was already wondering how it would work with this method, and
        if I would be able to do multiple cubes in a row without problems... Is
        it really impossible to use the same journey the same day, even with an
        hour, or 30 minutes in between? Well.. I guess I will have to prepare
        more journey&#x27;s then :). I am already trying to let my imagination
        make the images, and it leads to some very funny ones if I take 3 words
        and let my imagination add some random elements to the situation. Like

        Hi Thomas, Do you think the PAO method takes too long to design the
        system and memorise/learn all the words and their corresponding
        positions, or do you think memorisation of the cube takes longer? If so,
        can you explain to me why you are so sure that PAO method will slow me
        down? I actually started using it, and I am convinced it will make me
        faster drastically... I am still getting used to the system now, though

        yesterday i memorized in 57 seconds, but did not solve :( i will try the
        PAO-method this week, but only to solve multiple cubes. to solve
        multiple cubes i have 5 routes, each with 25 positions (8+12 for CO+EO,
        and 5 for orientation (2 for corners, 3 for edges). but then i need 10
        minutes to memorize. that must be faster (maybe with PAO?!?). the
        problem is, that i used numbers when i started blindcubing. then i
        transformed the numbers in pictures. for the first 8 edges i use the
        same pictures as for the 8 corners. yesterday i had 6 DNS in a row, now
        i&#x27;m frustrated. -- &quot;Feel free&quot; mit GMX FreeMail! Monat

        Hi, I have been working on a new version of ACube program

        use it to solve cube blindfolded so I need a specifications of the most

        Hello guys... I have been trying the PAO method a couple of times now
        (for speed), but it is much harder than I thought it would be... It
        still takes me too long to convert the information into the pictures in
        my head.. I like the memorisation method, but it&#x27;s harder to get
        used to this system than I thought it would be... It now takes me a bit
        longer to memorise the edges... But that&#x27;s probably because I am
        also spending a lot of time recalling which word belongs to the letters,
        and stuff like that... And also, I think I understand now, that making
        more routes for the journey method makes sense... So it&#x27;s going to
        take more practice than I thought (or hoped)... But I still like it, and
        I am going to continue practicing it. bye! - Joël.

        I tried a few more solves today... And I am getting used to the system
        more.. However, it still takes me a lot of time to read the cube and
        convert the information... I hope the time for doing that will go down
        sooooo much. John Louis, I read that people who use this PAO method for
        memorising cards really convert 3 cards into an image automatically.
        Now, I assume not everybody can get to this level, but how fast will the
        average individual be able to do this after practicing? And how long
        will the average person have to practice to get good results? I guess I
        just want to hear that it&#x27;s normal that I have to get used to this

        Hey Joel, I ran into a similar problem with my stories for the centers
        on the 4x4 and 5x5. But with a lot of practice now I don&#x27;t even do
        the conversion, if I see the piece reF that&#x27;s a space ship, or lbD
        that&#x27;s a knife. I think (or hope rather) that using PAO will be the
        same with enough practice. I&#x27;ve only tried memorizing one 4x4x4
        edges permutation with my journey and words so far, but I had my sheet
        there in front of me to make sure I got my images right. I still need to
        work on memorizing my pieces for the PAO part, but I will try a solve
        this way soon and see how it goes. Hope things are going well for you

        Hi Chris! Yes! We should keep each other motivated on this... In fact, I
        also tried motivating some Dutch cubers for this, because I would like
        some competition on the national level in this... But of course, trying
        to get at the same level as guys like you is also good motivation :). I
        know that converting the information faster must be possible... It must
        be possible to see three pieces of the cycle, and almost instantly (in 1
        second) know the image in your mind... Because that&#x27;s what must be
        going on with people that are memorising decks of cards... I really hope
        I can do something similar with memorising cubes.. Well.. I guess it
        takes a lot of practice :). I do notice that with practice, it becomes
        easier to make the stories every time, and I feel I am approaching my
        old memorisation speed. So... More practice I guess!! Good luck Chris! -

        does work (at least PO worked well for me). Actually my huge problem was
        not memorization but analysis. Cause I can&#x27;t just read where the
        center pieces go, I must decide myself and keep track for which pieces
        I&#x27;ve decided already. My previous method (keep a finger pointing
        into each face) sucks badly. Using a better developed memory method
        (like Chris&#x27;s) will hopefully help me to turn this ugly part into
        an ok part (I doubt I&#x27;ll ever really like it). Cheers! Stefan P.S.
        now 23 triples :-)

        Hey Stefan, Glad to know you&#x27;re trying this too! You&#x27;re
        definitely one of the memory masters among us cubers, so it would be
        good to see what type of things you can do with a really good technique.
        As for the analyzation the hierarchy on each face works really well for
        me, and makes it really easy to know which spots on a face you&#x27;ve
        filled already. So for people I have Larry > Batman > Terminator >
        Spiderman and if I were using my letters for the centers (I&#x27;m
        thinking about this too, since my journey could easily contain the 4x4
        centers and edges even if both were setup as 12 transpositions as a
        worst case) then I would just have A-D on the first face and A > B > C >
        D Also, you get to the point where you don&#x27;t even have to think
        about the hierarchy much, I just think &quot;Ok I&#x27;m back to people
        so far and two pictures ago Batman threw a Rubber duckie at the Giant
        Hamster so I need the Terminator now&quot; Also, I am considering
        keeping my picture for the centers the way I have them now and trying to
        add more characteristics to them. I wnat every place to have a related
        verb and object and noun. So my verbs face needs a suject and an object
        per piece, and my people face needs verbs. I already do this to some
        extent with the verbs face. An Ironman bicyclcist is the people version
        of the competing in the ironman competition verb. I want to really
        systematize this and maybe even add it into my journey and hopefully be
        able to memorize the cetners even more quickly. I&#x27;m not looking
        forward to coming up with multiple journeys but I do like the idea of
        not having to fight through interference and just using a different
        journey. So much work to do, but I think it will definitely be worth it.
        I also can&#x27;t wait until I am very familiar with these nouns from
        the 4x4 and can try a subset of them on the 3x3x3. I think I could
        definitely memorize much more quickly on the 3x3 if I took 3 pieces at a
        time into a picture, rather than trying to visualize lines inside the
        cube. I&#x27;m very excited to be learning such a powerful technique! I
        tried a 4x4 edges solve with my new PAO triplets and my journey and
        sadly had an execution error and forget to undo a setup turn. But I will
        work on it and let you guys know when I get my first edges solve this

        Hey everyone, Here is my list of PAO questions so far (well really just
        one). How do you distinguish people when doing this quickly? Should
        every person have some visual characteristic that is different from what
        the others have and just stands out really well? I find that I am also
        mixing up the people in my stories and am having a hard time remembering
        who did what. Also these stories are great! My favorites so far with my
        names are Ray Charles throwing an Orangatang, Chuck Norris eating a
        wallet, Xavier (from the X-men) singing to an umbrella. Heh heh I&#x27;m
        a fan of these stories already! Also, I have been practicing memorizing
        3 unique items per picture and solving them with cycles (so often my
        cycles do not encompass every item in the picture. This is a bit weird,
        but I&#x27;m hoping to get used to it. I can tell that it is slowing
        down my solving time considerably, but I have a feeling that the time
        gained by memorizing the cycles quicker will be worth it to lose some
        time during the solving. I will try to memorize this way and also just
        AO AO AO AO and have the same person do everything in the cycle. But I
        think since that will take more images that the time lost by taking
        longer to memorize will be a lot. That&#x27;s just my hunch, but so far
        I think memorizing more quickly (i.e. fewer images) will be worth it to
        have a slightly slower solving time. Chris

        Hey Chris.. Singing to an umbrella..?! I would immediately think that he
        would be singing the song &#x27;singing in the rain&#x27; - under an
        umbrella :). I really try to use my imagination to make the images, to
        make sure I won&#x27;t forget them... I also try to have different
        characters respond differently in different situations.. It takes time
        to get used to it, but my memorisation times for this method are slowly
        getting faster.. And the memorised information feels more
        &#x27;secure&#x27; than when I just repeat a lot of information of the
        cycles every time. For example when I have &#x27;Jolanda Investigates
        the Microwave&#x27;, she&#x27;s hitting the mircrowave, getting mad on
        it, saying &#x27;WHY ARENT YOU WORKING?!&#x27; (Jolanda always
        overreacts on emotions) But when LarsV investigates microwave, he&#x27;s
        more doing scientific tests on it :). (LarsV is more like a serious and
        focussed person) This way, I won&#x27;t forget the persons who are doing
        it. Hope that helps, Joël. --- In

        I know my solution and its steps are going to be far from optimal, but I
        want to keep it as friendly to what I do for the 3x3x3 as I can at
        first. I want to first orient each edge, then pair the edges one by one,
        then lastly permuting the edges. Since I&#x27;ve never gotten used to
        using three cycles on the 3x3x3, I want to keep the 4x4x4 in two cycles
        as much as possible. Two things are holding me up right now, but I think
        one of them I&#x27;ll have to suck up and just practice. What I hope
        someone could help me with is an algorithm that will flip two individual
        opposite edges, something like fixing an edge orientation parity on a
        regular solve, but instead of two edges side by side, they&#x27;d be
        opposite each other. I&#x27;ve sat down and memorized and solved these
        by just using the parity fix with more setup moves, but even though
        I&#x27;m willing to give up a lot of time for an easier yet slower
        solution, this takes up a bit more than I would like. I&#x27;m sure
        there&#x27;s a more simple way, I just don&#x27;t know how to create it.

        Chris, Joel and Stefan, If you just have learned to ride a cycle or
        drive a car, how fast you can ride or drive subconsciously. After a
        month you are better off. Now everything has become second nature even
        when you are super fast. Similarly, just imagine how superfast you will
        be after a month long, year long practice in PAO method. For card
        memorisation most follows only 1 image per location(52 locations), few
        follows PA method and very few follows PAO method. Their requirement is
        speed and not number of locations in spirnt events. I use 1 image per
        location. After a long long long time, I just tried memorising a pack of
        card using one image in 1 location(I just took the objects) and did well
        in 58 sec. I blindsolved 3*3*3 by stefan method(1 image in1 location,
        againI just took the object). Memorisation 2 min 18 sec and total time 8
        min 27.91 sec. I am very very slow in reading cube and I do not finger
        the cube.Still I am very happy with my result. Only if I practice and
        learn to finger cubes, I can improve. I just can not expect overnight
        miracle. Practice patiently like Stefan always does, you will be sub 1
        min in 3*3*3 and sub 10 min in 4*4*4. Practice, practice, practice. Only
        practice makes perfect, but only effective practice makes improvement.
        You all know these pretty well. I am just trying to motivate you, when
        you start feeling the learning curve starts declining now having
        increased initially. That is the natural rhythm of learning. If you
        learn phonetic sound and its value, it is possible to memorise all 8
        cornors in 1 PAO and all 12 edges in 2 PAO in 3*3*3. Plz give me some
        time and I shall explainit in a couple of days. Happy blindfold cubing.

        Joel, It is not just thinking of a P doing some A on an O at a
        particular location. The knack of memorisation is very important. This
        is where you need practice. Let me give it in a very simple way. When
        you want to learn anything new, associate it with something already you
        know very well. How to associate ? Associate it ridiculously. How to
        make it ridiculous? By either exaggerating the size, exaggerating the
        numbers or substitute. Finally, vizualise the ridiculous imagination in
        your MINDS EYE atleast for a fraction of second. This is the part
        initially takes more time. You start with say 5 sec per PAO. Slowly it
        can be cut down to 0.5 sec with practice. Happy blindfold cubing! John

        (LarsV is more like a serious and focussed person) This way, I

        Hi Matt, I saw your post and felt I had to respond. The very first time
        I did a 4x4x4 blindfolded I did the 4x4x4 supercube, and I used a method
        very similar to what you&#x27;re talking about here - and it took me
        about 5 hours to successfully blindfold solve my cube. The method you
        are talking about, slowly pair up the edge pieces into edge piece groups
        and then move them around the cube just like the 3x3x3 is what I did,
        and that method is such a horrible, terrible idea. Please don&#x27;t try
        it..... ever... please.... Something that would be much better, is to
        learn Stefan&#x27;s method and cycle the edge pieces to their correct
        locations directly (edges on the 4x4x4 only have a position, it is
        impossible to &quot;flip&quot; a 4x4x4 edge, that has no meaning for
        this type of edge). Then you can use a similar method to move the
        centers using two cycles one by one. Please don&#x27;t try to pair up
        the edges like a 3x3x3 and then move them in groups. I&#x27;ve tried it,
        it will take you about 5 hours to do. When I first switched to a
        different method using cycles to move pieces directly it took me 1 hour
        and 30 minutes roughly. If you like doing two swaps, then please look
        into Stefan&#x27;s method for solving the 4x4x4, it will be much better
        than trying to solve as a 3x3x3. I say that because I&#x27;ve tried
        solving the 4x4x4 similar to a 3x3x3, and that is about the worst way
        you can solve in that it takes so incredibly long to do, and if you make
        even one mistake in your almost 5 hours of solving you will get a DNF
        and open your eyes to a scrambled cube. Also as far as 2 swaps go I use
        this one to swap only two edges. It preserves absolutely everything on
        the cube, even centers, but it&#x27;s a long algorithm and I hate it. r2

        combining these steps some. Yeah, like Chris said, it&#x27;s much better
        to just solve pieces directly to where they belong. Using the above alg
        for 4x4 like using the T-perm for 3x3 (with my method) is probably the
        easiest way. Just for fun here are the setup lengths: Distance 0: 2
        edges (if you also use the neighbour-swap alg) Distance 1: 3 edges
        Distance 2: 13 edges Distance 3: 5 edges Average number of setup moves:

        :-) In addition to that alg, use the alg after x&#x27;-rotation (and
        rotate back at the end). Results in: Distance 0: 3 edges (if you also
        use the neighbour-swap alg) Distance 1: 5 edges Distance 2: 12 edges
        Distance 3: 3 edges Average now: 1.65 setup moves (all only outer-slice
        turns, btw!) Cheers! Stefan

        Joel, well done! keep it up. Is it including memorisation ? You can try
        phonetic sound and its value system for cornors. If you have very good
        vocabulary, then you can memorise 8 cornors in just 1 or 2 or 3 words on
        the fly.My mother tongue is not English and I can not coin a word on the
        fly. So I had a prepared set for every 2 digits.But, I think you can do
        it on the fly even for 4 or 5 sounds together. If you have not yet
        learned it, you can find it at
        http://www.freewebs.com/bernett/memorytechniques.htm Example :- If your
        order of cycle is (85321)(647), then the phonetic sounds are F, L, M, N,
        T and SH, R, K. Using the no value letter in between the sounds, you can
        create your own words. 85321 = FiLaMeNT 647= SHaRK Hope you like it.

        Hello John, Yes, all my times include memorisation. For the corners, I
        don&#x27;t first orientate them and cycle them afterwards. I use Stefan
        Pochmann&#x27;s system for the corners... For memorisation this means I
        need 24 &#x27;letters&#x27; or other &#x27;objects&#x27;, and memorise
        about 7 of them. I don&#x27;t think I want to use PAO for this too.. Do

        *blegh* I just tried a 5x5x5 solve with all my usual stuff after having
        practiced the 4x4x4 edges with PAO a lot lately. I can see how flawed my
        old approach is for memorizing. I have a lot of opportunities to miss a
        piece because there is no structure, and if I don&#x27;t make an effort
        to memorize my stories very very visually I may miss a more abstract
        element. I like the structure of PAO a lot, and will definitely try to
        make it my main method. Unfortunately I&#x27;m not ready enough to use
        it at the Georgia tournament yet, maybe for the 4x4 edges if I just feel
        that I am starting to get it really well, but I doubt it. Anyway after
        this tournament I want to make a bunch more journeys and really refine
        my images and take care of my fuzziness with visualizing people (or just
        pick more memorable people). Anyway, just trying to update with how
        I&#x27;m doing. After trying PAO and then trying my old system, I can
        really see how powerful PAO is! Chris

        I just did three consecutive solves where all four edges on the E slice
        needed to be oriented and wonder if anyone uses any specific algorithms
        for these. I usually just set them up on the U face and flip all four
        there, or sometimes rotate along z and flip them in pairs on the new U

        Well done Chris. If you have more than 1 attempt for BLD events in
        Georgia, one solve you can do using PAO and the rest using your any
        comfortable method. It will be sort of experience to compare the systems
        in championship conditions and environment. >really refine my images and
        take care of my fuzziness with visualizing people Select the people whom
        you know very well. After some good practice, you will not see the
        person in full size. You will only be getting/visualising a particular
        mark or special feature of that person, say big ears, big lower lips,
        Doubled chin, No eye-brows, Scar in the face, pointed nose, Bow tie,
        Blonde hair, Chubby cheeks, Big fore head, Blue eyes etc. Hope this will
        give you some ideas to eliminate the fuzziness with visualising people.

        Joel, here is what Bernett does for Stefan&#x27;s method. Name the 8
        cornors in Alphabetical order A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H. Assign 3 words for each
        piece( a name for each face starting with same alphabet). Leave out the
        UBR piece. It gets solved automatically at the end. So you ned to have
        7*3 = 21 images. A= apple, aero plane, ant B= ball, bag, bicycle And
        ofcourde apply Journey method. John Louis JoÂ¤l van Noort

        cornors in just 1 or 2 or 3 words on the fly.My mother tongue is not
        English and I can not coin a word on the fly. So I had a prepared set
        for every 2 digits.But, I think you can do it on the fly even for 4 or 5

        Alright so apparently there&#x27;s a download limit if you don&#x27;t
        have an account. Usually once you hit the limit, you can wait an hour
        and download more again. As for the DDR videos, those huge swarms of red
        things are called Mines. If you accidentally hit one, it explodes on you
        and damages your overall score, so you must be extra careful not to
        press or hold an arrow key while a Mine passes over its respective
        stationary gray arrow -- you only want to tap the actual sliding ARROWS
        onbeat to the music (meaning extra-quick taps are needed for hitting the
        arrows, because if you lag too long on a key, the input will coincide
        with a Mine and cause it to explode). I made a few other blindfold
        videos (one of 1:53 [~23 seconds memorization] and another of 2:10 [~33
        seconds memorization]) if anyone cares to see (much better view of my
        head/blindfold and cube I think), but I decided to upload the fastest
        one here. The rest I recorded were either slower, not as cool, or
        DNF&#x27;s. That and my hands gave out after a while so I stopped
        filming. http://rapidshare.de/files/15059528/legendoftrance.MOV.html
        Score: AAAA (all Marvelous) Took me 16 tries to get. Ungh.
        http://rapidshare.de/files/15059657/loveiseternity.MOV.html Score:
        ...see for yourself... most irritating score ever! This was like attempt
        20 or something and I just decided to screw it after this video for
        obvious reasons regarding the score. So dumb and yet so funny :P
        http://rapidshare.de/files/15045239/blindfold.MOV.html Time: 1:32:56
        (~20 seconds memorization) I love this song. I find that when I start a
        cubing session I tend to do really well, but then my hands seem to get
        exponentially worse over time (after this solve my times just kept
        getting worse and worse). Song: Pandemonium - Zigzag

        feel anything hurting in your hands, anything at all, you should just
        quit for a few days. Doctors advice ;). Can you tell me the exact method

        Rofl, I might just do that! It&#x27;s actually my roommate&#x27;s
        bandana thing... usually I just close my eyes, but for the sake of
        video, I wore a blindfold. And yeah my hands hurt a lot when I cube,
        even for a little bit, but I think it&#x27;s the cube&#x27;s fault. I
        can play DDR a lot longer than I can cube. The layers jam so often and
        don&#x27;t allow for smooth triggers most of the time so I have to
        strain and force them, etc. I think I will need a different cubed that
        is well-lubed if I am to get rid of the aching. I appreciate your
        concern though, thank you! I&#x27;ll try to keep it light. As for my
        method, I am about to make a few videos outlining an example solve, so
        stay tuned. --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com, Joël

        Hi Marcus, Yeah actually I remember Dan Harris told me he went to a
        doctor once, and he/she said that if you feel anyting, a very tiny
        little small ache, you should just quit for a while.. (and usually, when
        I feel something, it was also quite healthy to do something else for a
        while :)) Also, it&#x27;s important to relax while cubing, and take
        enough breakes. About the cubes: Yes.. You must be really lucky to find
        nice good and loose cubes :)... I think my DIY&#x27;s are perfectly
        loose.. very good for speedcubing.. Maybe you should try Ryan
        patricio&#x27;s onehanded cube :). That thing can be scrambled by
        shaking it. I am looking forward to hear more about your method.. :)..
        Well, happy cubing!! - Joël. --- In

        Hi :-) By the way, PAO means Person/Action/Object or Permute and Orient
        ? Hehehe .. i would guess the first. Noone would be so crazy as to swap
        the orientation and permutation step? Right? And also, is it true that
        Leyan Lo memorises simply by visualising the colors? If so has he tried
        that for the larger cubes also. Or will it only work for 2x2x2 and 3x3x3
        cubes ? Cheers! -Per > --- In

        the solve video. Besides using a different host, you could try
        compressing the videos. For the resolution you&#x27;re using, 1.5 MB per

        Hey Joel, Stefan, Thanks for the kind words. I&#x27;m very excited about
        having a shot at solving the bigger cubes in a competition environment
        and see how I stack up compared to the pros who have already done it
        officially (I&#x27;m still a noob). I just hope it goes well ;-) Haha
        Stefan, well I mean there is the chance I will DNF both solves of
        course, but I will try to get a good solve for the 5x5 since it&#x27;s
        the harder cube to forget if I DNF the first one and have to take a
        second solve. I think the times for both bigger cubes will change a lot
        anyway once more people learn the PAO method, or PO, or other variants
        of the journey methods or major methods. I will still be using my old
        stuff for Chattahoochee since I&#x27;m not used to the new methods yet
        :-( Still I&#x27;m excited, and thanks everyone! I hope to come back
        with more than 4 DNF&#x27;s lol Chris --- In

        Hey everyone, Just wanted to post my thoughts on doing the big cubes BLD
        in a tournament. First off my hat is off to Dror Vomberg and Stefan
        Pochmann for doing the 5x5x5 blindfolded in a tournament mostly having
        figured things out on their own. I had help from both you guys and I
        still found it hard to do in front of people, and with the pressure. As
        far as the actual solving goes I have completely scrapped my
        memorization method and am devoting myself fully to PAO and the journey
        method. Coming up with the stories the way I do, stringing everything
        together and supplying the links between nouns as a cause and effect
        style grouping does not allow me to memorize well (meaning quickly) when
        under a lot of pressure. Also interference was a big problem for me
        since I used the same nouns and places and verbs for every cube, and if
        a situation on one cube is similar to an early one it sucks to try to
        remember how the situation on the current cube is, and block out the one
        from the previous cube. I very much like the idea of just being able to
        use a number of different prepared journeys to avoid interference and
        allow you to memorize multiple cubes and not worry about running into
        similar situations as much. It seems that the different journey itself
        would help to combat this very well. I had a great time and the
        tournament was very fun! I learned that I still have a lot to learn, but
        I had a blast making this attempt in public and getting a successful
        solve under pressure. Now I just need to scrap my old method and really
        learn how to use the PAO method :-( . I really think it will be a much
        better memorization method for tournament solving than my current method
        is. Also, memorizing the edges by rote for each cube is a bad idea for
        me, because I had a hard time trying to overwrite the stuff I remembered
        from my previous solve(s). In the future I plan on using PAO for the
        edges of the bigger cubes too to help avoid that problem. I&#x27;ll
        probably end up refining this approach after trying it in April if
        something doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hope, but my plan for the April
        tournament in Tennesse is to use PAO for the centers and edges on my 4x4
        attempts instead of the stories as I use them now and the edges just by
        rote. Just my thoughts on tournament big cubes BLD, in case anyone is
        interested. Chris P.S. that comment about wanting to come back with
        &quot;more than 4 DNF&#x27;s&quot; I meant that I wanted any situation
        better than coming home with 4 DNF&#x27;s, not that I wanted multiple
        DNF&#x27;s (more than 4 of them).

        Hi Chris, congrats for your 5x5 blindsolve, it&#x27;s a great
        achievement, particularly in competition conditions. I think I know what
        you mean about having a blast, I still remember very well how extremely

        Hi guys ! Im not into blindfold cubing myself. But nevertheless i have a
        challenge ;-) ======== The challenge is like this: 1) Scramble and
        memorise a 3x3x3 cube 2) Go to sleep (at least 4 hrs, a normal overnite
        sleep) 3) When u are ready next day solve the cube with blindfold (do
        not inspect the cube again !! Apart from making sure orientation is
        correct.) 4) Take off blindfold and see if cube is solved ;-) ========
        This will challenge the memorisation using long term memory. Normally
        memorisation/solving is done using short term memory only. How many of
        out guys can recall the scramble say 10 mins after a bld- solve? Not so
        many i guess. There is no reward for doing this. Apart from a good good
        feeling of being able to say : I DID IT!! :D Best of luck anyone :D -Per

        extremely excited > I felt after my solve back then :-) Hey Stefan,
        Thanks, but seriously you are one of my biggest inspirations to try to
        do this. When I read about your 5x5x5 BLD solve at the European
        championship (first successful solve in competition!) I couldn&#x27;t
        get over how amazing that was! Plus your UWR for megaminx and your
        multiple 3x3 cubes world record are awesome as well! > > Can you tell
        how much off you were for your other attempts, how much > time you spent
        on each, and how much time you spent for memorization > and execution of
        your successful one? Certainly, my first 5x5x5 BLD solve would have been
        45 minutes if it were successful but it was off by a lot. Each face had
        anywhere from 30%-50% of the right stickers on it, but all in all it was
        a very unsuccessful DNF. The corners were unsolved, which makes me think
        I messed up while solving corners, leaving most everything else to get
        messed up quite a lot. The second 5x5 was 40-41 minutes to memorize (I
        could make out the minutes on the stopwatch but not the seconds) and I
        guess about 14- 15 minutes to solve. I was so incredibly freaked out
        about this being my last possible attempt for the 5x5 until the US
        championship that I went over every cycle for everything (corners,
        edges, centers) a couple times just to make sure I would remember them
        all. I don&#x27;t know the breakdowns of my 4x4 solves, but the first
        one I put the cube down at 12:24 but had flipped 3 corners the wrong way
        leaving them twisted at the end, and I forgot to swap two blocks that I
        had created during my centers. So 4 centers off, and 3 corners twisted.
        The second 4x4 solve was a miserable failure, after solving the corners
        (Leyan was my judge and said at one point I had them correctly) I made
        two very big mistakes in my edges and realized near the end of the edges
        cycles that there was no chance for a success, so I stopped and that was
        at 15 minutes something. The cube (even corners) was completely
        scrambled when I stopped. My biggest problem overall was interference
        from previous solves after the first cube. The second 4x4 solve was the
        worst since I had parts of all 3 other cube scrambles in my had, and I
        use the same nouns and verbs and such every time, so I was getting mixed
        up. I&#x27;m trying to plan out multiple journeys and some good triplets
        for the letters to try to get around this and see how it goes. Stefan
        how do you feel about interference for your memorization method? I mean
        would you feel comfortable doing 2 cubes in a row in competition using
        it? I certainly don&#x27;t anymore with my technique, not after having a
        chance to try it and see how hard it is. That is why I&#x27;m so
        motivated to change it now. I&#x27;m still very curious what your
        thoughts are for memorizing the bigger cubes in competition. > Cheers! >
        Stefan > Happy cubing! Chris

      <strong>486. Earmuffs in competition?</strong><br />

        Hey everyone, I think being able to use earmuffs/earplugs or both in a
        competition would be a really good idea from a competitor&#x27;s
        standpoint. I think it would be nice to be able to just be in your own
        little world so to speak without being able to hear the audience or
        people around you during a solve. Is this something that we can start to
        allow in competition? I assume this would help for any aspect of BLD
        cubing. The reason I ask, the memory championships allow the use of
        earmuffs to block out sound. BLD cubing is a memory sport, so why not
        follow the guidelines and rules as they pertain to other memory sports
        in the aspect of sound distractions? Just wanted to ask, I would really
        love the ability to bring earmuffs to use in competition in the future.

        Hi Per, I can truly and easily say: &quot;No Problem&quot; Memorization
        and retention has never been a limiting factor on any of my attempts.
        When I was first learning to blindsolve the 5x5x5 supercube I was very
        busy at my job and did not have a lot of time to devote to memorizing
        and solving. So what I would do was to &#x27;treat&#x27; myself to
        memorizing one of the cycles each night during the week and then do a
        solve attempt on the weekend when I had a nice window of uninterrupted
        time. For example I might memorize the edge cycle on a Tuesday night,
        one of the center cycles on the Wednesday night, the other center cycle
        on a Thursday night, and the rest of the cube on the Friday night. On
        Saturday afternoon I would then first recall all of the information
        before looking at the cube, then recall it a second time while
        double-checking it against the scrambelled cube, and when I was
        confident that I had it I would attempt the solve. I did have several
        DNFs but they were ALL due to mistakes in undoing my set-up moves. Never
        was the fact that some of my memorization was 3-4 days old ever a
        problem in the actual solve. Of course as I got better I could then do
        it all in one sitting but this is how I got started. Thus I can
        confidently say that I can easily and effortlessly retain all of the
        memorized information while it is still relevant. That last bit is
        significant because 2 days after the solve I can only certainly recall
        patches of the solve not every single detail. But the main point is that
        the info stays clear and strong until I use it. I am also sure that if I
        had 2 identical scrambles I could solve them on consecutive weekends
        because the info would still be relevant to me for the week in between
        the solves. Only when I feel that I am finished with the info does it
        start to fade on me. For the consecutive weekend attempt it would remain
        relevant and therefore remain clear. It is an interesting question and I
        would also like to know if other big cube blindfolders have similar
        experiences to me in this. I would also like to thank John Louis because
        I too am in the process of re-thinking my memorization process and
        shifting to the PAO method. It is time consuming and there is definately
        a bit of a learning curve but I am also quickly becoming more and more
        comfortable with the system and I have no doubts that it will lead to
        significant payoffs in the near future. Rob --- Per Kristen Fredlund

        Hi Chris, thanks for the details of your several attempts! The twisting
        time for your successful 5x5 solve seems to be quite well, mostly the
        memorization taking much longer than in practice, right? About
        interference: I&#x27;ve never done several large cubes in a row (mainly
        because I&#x27;m so fucking slow that I&#x27;m exhausted after just one
        cube :-). But I&#x27;ve been alright using the same mental images for
        let&#x27;s say 5x5 edges, +centers and Xcenters all along a longer
        journey without problems. Similar for the multiple 3x3 solve. Then
        again, keep in mind I&#x27;m fucking slow and that&#x27;s partly because
        I take my time for memorizing safely. No idea about interference
        problems when you go fast. But I think it definitely helps attaching
        things to different locations in journeys. Ask me again in a few months,
        until then I want to have more practice with this, as I need to get the
        5x5 record back. Cheers! Stefan

        I was going to say...I saw you wearing them at WC during your 5x5
        attempt. (I&#x27;m going to answer all the posts in one, just to save
        space) You Rock Chris!!! Thats all I can say. Any chance in teaching me
        4x4 and 5x5, to some degree??? I have made some great achievements in
        BLD cubing since I started a week ago, and feel that I could do well
        with the Big Cubes as well. Truly, I think the idea for earmuffs/plugs
        in competition is a great idea, to go along with your hat idea. It gives
        you that feeling that you are at home, to some degree. As for my BLD
        achievements:(I started learning Stefan&#x27;s method last Sunday,
        around 2 PM my time) My First successful solve was around 11-11:30 on
        Tuesday, with a time of 6:29. Since then my times rapidly dropped to an
        average of about 3:30 but now they are going back up a bit because I am
        not doing it every spare moment. My PB is 2:19, and I&#x27;ve had a few
        other sub-3s. I started doing 2x2 BLD on Thursday or so...A lot of
        people find my method for Memo on 2x2 very weird. the most you need to
        memorise is 6 pieces, and I visually remember where the pieces are going
        to go, and say one colour in my head. I&#x27;ve done a solve that
        literally takes 4 seconds to memorise: Yellow White White Green Red. The
        other day, not sure when, I did 5 2x2s BLD, I knew I could beat 4, so I
        tried it and was successful. Ever since I got into BLD I&#x27;ve loved
        it and it is very interesting. My next step is to take on the bigger
        cubes, and make my regular times better. I&#x27;ll stop rambling... If
        any of you who don&#x27;t know me already want to talk to me, and
        I&#x27;m always open to talking to other cubers, especially BLD cubers,
        then add me to MSN at logitewty [at] hotmail [dot] com or Yahoo

        There are plenty of ear plug models. Some are skin colored, some are

        I understand the use of earplugs as a personal use of cutting out
        distraction. There was also debate sometime ago as to the use of
        headphones in competition for speedsolving. For me this would have been

        Actually, I think the reason behing banning the headphones was because
        god only knows what you have on there. I could be algorithms repeating
        over and over. Or someone could have watched the previous scrambles and
        recorded the solution on there. Like really, earplugs are a good idea.

        I was only half-serious. I&#x27;m not sure what the other half was :)
        The volume level from the headphones is highly subjective anyway, but I
        still maintain I could listen to my music without distracting others.
        Portable CD players, MP3 players, etc. have been allowed at every major
        chess tournament I&#x27;ve participated in. I would consider both chess
        and cubing to be in the &quot;mind sport&quot; category. On a different
        idea, if earplugs are allowed to enhance performance; are lighting
        sources allowed? For example, bringing a lamp up to the timer to help my
        lighting situation. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with lighting at a
        tournament though... -Richard --- Stefan Pochmann &lt;pochmann@...>

        Hey Craig, Absolutely I can show you some stuff for the bigger cubes
        blindfolded. I use freestyle commutators for literally everything except
        some CO cases that I have memorized as algs, so basically I can just
        show you the main ones I use for cycling edges and corners and the way I
        setup some of the borderline cases that could go either way. Also, if
        you like using Stefan&#x27;s method and are comfortable with it you know
        you can use it for the bigger cubes too for the cycling, so it really is
        up to you. Using Stefan&#x27;s method will be more moves but hardly any
        delays between algs, freestyle cycling will be fewer moves but lots of
        delays between algs. Also your 3x3 and 2x2 times are really good! How
        long is it taking you to memorize on average? For the bigger cubes I
        highly recommend learning the journey method, or the Roman Room, or
        Major method, or something more sophisticated than the rote memory
        techniques for the 3x3. I talked with Leyan and Tyson at Chattahoochee
        and I&#x27;m starting to be convinced that memorizing the 3x3 directly
        instead of with the Journey method can be really fast (1:28 in
        competition, plus Tyson&#x27;s 1:27 DNF that was only off by the H
        perm). Anyway yeah so I recommend a different memorization method, but
        you don&#x27;t have to learn one if you don&#x27;t want. Cool man,
        awesome times and your progress on the 3x3 and 2x2 so far is ridiculous!

        You probably saw into the future, worried about my concern, and asked it

        Honestly, if I was allowed to wear headphones during a competition I
        would very strongly consider recording a metronome at 180 on tape and
        listening to that in a walkman for my 3x3 solves. I&#x27;d have another
        tape at 120 for my 4x4 solves to pace me on edges, etc.. Maybe this is
        the reason/a reason we&#x27;re not allowed headphones? Then again if
        you&#x27;re even a beginner musician it&#x27;s real easy to tap your
        toes inside your shoes at 180 or 120 during a solve, so maybe that
        wouldn&#x27;t even help that much? It would just make the ability to
        pace yourself easier in that you passively listen to the beat rather

        I too would love to learn more about these freestyle commutators you
        speak of -- is it similar in nature to &quot;intuitive&quot; solving on
        the centers when cubing it for speed while looking (just the impression
        I get from the word &quot;freestyle&quot;)? I think I&#x27;ve come to
        the conclusion that methods like PAO are best used on the 4x4 and bigger
        -- it isn&#x27;t needed for the 3x3, which I think is the limit of
        &quot;comfortable-direct-memorization&quot;, since it becomes a lot

        I think it would be cool to allow music during a solve, because I truly
        think it helps aid your thinking somehow. For some reason, without
        music, there tends to be way too much inner monologue and that can lead
        to lack of focus, etc. Music is a nice way to keep you on track, anyhow,
        and it artificially sets a certain pace. Regardless, if you look around
        at many other &quot;memory sport&quot; competitions, they all tend to
        allow music, headphones, earplugs, earmuffs, etc, whatever helps you
        focus best. The cube shouldn&#x27;t be an exception. --- In

        Personally, I&#x27;m all for allowing music/headphones/whatever during
        any sort of cubing competition. As long as it&#x27;s not overtly
        distracting to anyone else (like being loud), I don&#x27;t see the

        Hi guys, Thanks for your feedback. I will look into this subject for the
        next version of the WCA regulations. I think the main issues with
        allowing electronic equipment are: 1) could disturb other people 2)
        could be used for unallowed help (not really for speedcubing of course,
        but for blindfolded cubing it could help in some way) 3) it is hard to
        decide/distinguish which equipment would be OK and which not. Therefore
        we thought it was better to not allow equipment at all. (examples of
        clear cases and cases on the edge of fairness: music might be OK but
        what about algorithms, personal light under bad light conditions, a
        dictaphone for blindfolded solving, a flashing light to annoy other
        competitors, a metronome for keeping a specific pace, a laptop for
        algorithms like the 4x4x4 parity algorithms). 4) I can&#x27;t remember
        seeing someone wearing such equipment in other sports (but I may be
        wrong) Anyway, I will get back to this subject, but feel free to already
        send me feedback or use the WCA forum for feedback. It would be possible
        to allow more than is allowed now. As long as it is a 100 percent clear
        and fair rule. Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message ----- From: Mike

        1) You could just set a general volume rule, cap it in a fashion similar
        to stereo and radio laws for automobiles in the US (ie. shouldn&#x27;t
        be able to hear outside a 15 ft radius or something, etc) 2) Perhaps
        have someone review all music for blindfold solvers before allowing them
        to use it? 3) I think as long as the common-sense rule holds it should
        be ok, and by this I mean, if it doesn&#x27;t annoy others or unfairly
        aid the solver, go for it (ie. obviously don&#x27;t allow flashing

        Hi Marcus, We&#x27;ve gone over regulations like these before. The main
        issue is the practicality. Competition organizers are already doing a
        lot. 1) Sure, we could set a decibel rule too, but then that would be
        really hard to measure. We&#x27;d need a machine, there&#x27;d be
        background noise, and everything else. As for the &quot;shouldn&#x27;t
        be able to hear outside a 15 ft radius,&quot; people have different
        levels of hearing. Who is to decide what is audible or not? A musician
        with sensitive ears might be able to hear things that a teenager who
        listens to rock music with loud headphones all the time might not be
        able to hear. 2) Again, this is a huge hassle and really isn&#x27;t
        practical. I shouldn&#x27;t have to go through everyone&#x27;s music to
        see whether or not they&#x27;re cheating. 3) Common-sense is good, but
        unfortunately, people don&#x27;t follow common sense all the time, and
        when there&#x27;s a disagreement, we have to refer to hard text. In
        general, and this is a really old argument, when you go to a
        competition, you&#x27;re expected to deal with the atmosphere of the
        competition. That&#x27;s why when you succeed in competition, it&#x27;s
        different from when you succeed in the comfort of your own home. You
        don&#x27;t get your special chair, your special lights, your music, your
        ear muffs, your girlfriend, or fuzzy teddy bear. You get whatever gets
        thrown at you in the competition. Everyone is already dealing with the
        same stuff. In other words, let&#x27;s not please have a repeat of the
        headphones music argument. Unlike headphones, ear plugs do not
        &quot;add&quot; anything to the atmosphere. We&#x27;ll look into it, and
        I&#x27;ll concede that organizers are unable to control the level of
        background noise in all given competition environments (i.e. a museum).
        Personally, I&#x27;ve been affected by this stuff myself, so I feel your
        pain, but it&#x27;s something you have to learn to deal with. World
        Championships &#x27;05... the audience started clapping during my last
        BLD solve and I definitely lost my train of thought and paused for a few
        seconds. Maybe that 1:54.33 could have been faster? But if I had gone
        before Leyan, it would have been the other way around, and maybe he
        would have been distracted with the clapping. These are just situations
        we can&#x27;t control. Tyson Mao Astrophysics &#x27;06 California

        I understand your point especially considering the ambiguities that may
        arise and actually be difficult to define in hard text -- usually when
        something is hard to define it can be fixed by having a rule of
        lowest/weakest link, meaning, for instance, *nobody* should be able to
        hear the music outside of say 15 feet, but of course, this would still
        be a hassle. Just depends on how flexible you want the hard text to
        accomodate &quot;common sense&quot; frameworks. BTW how can music help
        blindfold solvers do something unfairly? It&#x27;s not like you can
        listen to solutions, I mean at most it could provide aural algorithms,
        but that would still be impractical on both ends. Finally, I&#x27;d love
        to know how a teddy bear can help! :D The teddy must must be the key to

        Hey Tyson, In what way can you cheat by using music? Making a CD with
        yourself repeating algorithms? Listening to &quot;R U B2...&quot;
        won&#x27;t help me much... You don&#x27;t have to go through 10 hours of
        music for every competitor.. I most cases it will be clear right away
        that it&#x27;s just harmless music. About the volume: I don&#x27;t think
        anyone will ever be able to hear my headphones. I don&#x27;t want to
        damage my ears! - Joël. --- In

        Hmm I suppose... perhaps there are more cons than pros, but it just
        seems like it&#x27;d be nice to allow music, but too hard to account for
        all cases. I know this has all probably be said before since it&#x27;s
        apparently an old argument. I still say we should allow the aid of
        girlfriends and/or teddy bears &lt;_&lt; >_> Joel: This is what I was
        trying to say -- recording algorithms wouldn&#x27;t be all that
        practical. I don&#x27;t know what else you could possibly record. Thing
        is, even though you may not play it loudly, some people&#x27;s
        headphones DO blast music pretty loudly for others to hear. --- In

        cases, it&#x27;s hard define things in hard text... It doesn&#x27;t
        prevent gouvernments from making laws... It&#x27;s the task of the
        gourvernment to serve the people. The gourvernment is my slave in that
        way. Just like that, I think WCA should do everything possible to create
        nice competition environments for competitors.. Of course, I won&#x27;t
        bring my own chair and teddy bear etc. etc., but wearing headphones that

        > I too would love to learn more about these freestyle commutators you >
        speak of -- is it similar in nature to &quot;intuitive&quot; solving on
        the > centers when cubing it for speed while looking (just the
        impression > I get from the word &quot;freestyle&quot;)? Hey Marcus and
        everyone, I&#x27;ve been meaning to write a tutorial about what I use
        for freestyle commutators but I&#x27;ve been too lazy/busy lately to
        really get to it. Here is a short explanation of what I do. Obviously a
        commutator is made up of two permutations A and B strung together as
        ABA&#x27;B&#x27; Now let me define a &quot;freestlye commutator&quot; as
        a commutator where either A or B (but not both) is a single slice turn.
        So let S stand for slice turn. A freestlye commutator looks like
        ASA&#x27;S&#x27; or SAS&#x27;A&#x27; Ok, so that is how the exact form a
        freestyle commutator will take. Now here is how to setup the pieces. A
        freestlye commutator always cycles two pieces in the same slice and one
        piece off that slice. I say slice because two pieces in the r slice is
        just as good as two pieces in the R slice, no difference. If you&#x27;re
        on the 5x5x5 the m,e,s slices are just as good as any other slice as
        well, so feel free to use them also. Now there is one further
        definition. When two pieces are in the same outer slice they also need
        to have the same &quot;direction&quot;. &quot;Direction&quot; is an
        arbitrary distinction that I gave to the edges of a 4x4 and 5x5. An edge
        piece on the 4x4 or 5x5 either has the attribute of &quot;leftness&quot;
        or &quot;rightness&quot; The left edges are {lUB, fUL, rUF, bUR, uBR,
        dBL, rDB, fDR, lDF, bDL, uFL, dFR} and the right edges are the other 12
        edges. Ok so if you have two edges in the same outer layer either have
        to both be &quot;left&quot; edges or both be &quot;right&quot; edges.
        All it means for both edges to be either &quot;right&quot; or
        &quot;left&quot; is that by turning that outer layer one edge can occupy
        the position of the other. Ok, so here are the rules. 1) Always use
        &quot;freestyle commutators&quot; where A or B (*not* both) is a slice
        turn 2) always setup the edges in your 3 cycle such that two pieces are
        in the same slice, and one piece is off that slice 2a) If two pieces are
        setup in the same outer layer slice they *must* both be
        &quot;right&quot; edges or both be &quot;left&quot; edges Ok so here is
        an example. (lUB -> fUL -> dFR) Ok so first we need to see how the edges
        are setup. Do we have 2 edges in the same slice? Yes we do, lUB and fUL
        are both in the U slice. Now, those two pieces are in an outer slice so
        are they both left edges or both right edges? Yes, they&#x27;re both
        left edges. Now is the other edge off that slice? yes it is it&#x27;s in
        the d slice, the R slice, and F slice, so it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t touch
        the U slice. Ok so this is an easy setup, we don&#x27;t even need to do
        a setup move. To solve it we have to do this. Our freestyle commutator
        is made up of a permutation A and a slice turn S. The permutation moves
        the lone edge (the one not in the slice with the other two) into the
        location where it needs to go. So in our cycle (lUB -> fUL -> dFR) the
        lone edge is dFR and it needs to go to lUB. So what we need to do is to
        move dFR to lUB without distrubing anything else in the U slice. I would
        do this by doing B d2 B&#x27; which places dFR into the U slice at lUB
        and doesn&#x27;t affect anything else in the U slice. Now turn the U
        slice such that the other one of the two edges ends up at lUB. Do this
        by turning U which moves fUL to lUB. Now just complete the commutator.
        Don&#x27;t pay any attention to what edges move where, you did the setup
        correctly, so now just invert the first two permutations to make it a
        commutator. So we started with B d2 B&#x27; as our A and U as our S. So
        using ASA&#x27;S&#x27; we should end with B d2 B&#x27; then U&#x27; So
        the whole move is B d2 B&#x27; U B d2 B&#x27; U&#x27;. Notice how I
        selected the A such that it&#x27;s inverse is the same as A itself, or
        that A=A&#x27;? That&#x27;s a very useful trick to help avoid
        DNF&#x27;s. Now all I have to remember is which way to turn the U layer
        each time. So when I do the U turn I imagine the U slice off from solved
        by a U turn, then when I do the U&#x27; I imagine the cube solves. This
        helps me make sure I do those turns correctly. (Advanced tip: if I ran
        into this cycle on a real BLD solve I would do U&#x27; L d&#x27; L&#x27;
        U L d L&#x27; instead of the move I gave in this example. Both are
        commutators the perform this cycle, but see if you can see why I would
        use U&#x27; L d&#x27; L&#x27; U L d L&#x27; instead of B d2 B&#x27; U B
        d2 B&#x27; U&#x27;). -------------- Ok so now let&#x27;s do a harder
        example. (lUB -> rUF -> lDF) So first thing we look at is do we have two
        pieces in the same slice and one piece off that slice? Yes we do. We can
        group either lUB+rUF together in the U slice or rUF+lDF in the F slice.
        Let&#x27;s group lUB+rUF together in the U slice. So now we need to
        place the lone edge into the spot where it needs to go. So lDF is the
        lone edge and it needs to go to lUB. Now how do we do this without
        messing up anyting on the U slice? This is actually a hard cycle, and
        requires some setup moves. Here I would do D&#x27; L&#x27; as a setup
        move which places lDF into the spot dFL. Now we have the cycle
        (lUB->rUF->dFL) and now we need to move dFL to lUB without messing up
        the U slice. I would do this with B d&#x27; B&#x27; as the algorithm.
        Now we need to move the 2nd of the two pieces in the same layer to the
        spot where you just moved an edge to, or move rUF to lUB with the turn
        U2. So A = B d&#x27; B&#x27; and S=U2 So after doing A then S don&#x27;t
        even think about where the edges are and what you&#x27;re doing, just
        complete the commutator. So then complete it with A&#x27; then S&#x27;
        or B d B&#x27; U2. Then undo the setup turns you did with L D at the
        end. So the whole move is D&#x27; L&#x27; B d&#x27; B&#x27; U2 B d
        B&#x27; U2 L D The power of this technique is after doing either A then
        S or S then A you can turn your brain off and mindlessly undo the algs
        you just did in commutator order. So although you do 8 move algs as the
        commutators, the thought process stops after move 4. For the centers I
        do the same thing as edges. Place two centers on one face and the lone
        center on a different face. Only now you don&#x27;t need to worry about
        any &quot;leftness&quot; or &quot;rightness&quot;. Here are some more
        examples of commutators that I use. (lUB -> uBL -> uFR) slice = u lone
        edge = lUB S = u2 A = R U R&#x27; do as SAS&#x27;A&#x27; And now for one
        not in the U layer, since I do these anywhere, but it&#x27;s easy to see
        and explain with them in the U layer if you&#x27;re just starting. (rUB
        -> uFR -> fDR) slice = R lone edge = rUB A = F r2 F&#x27; S = R do as
        ASA&#x27;S&#x27; And that&#x27;s a good start to what I do. There are
        other tricks to make the commutators easy to perform, and some tricks to
        remembering them when trying to go really fast, but that is a start to
        what exactly I think when I do them. Hope this helps, Chris

        > You don&#x27;t get your ..... ear muffs ... So these are in fact

        since it seems people have already used earplugs. I don&#x27;t care how
        I look when wearing them, if I am allowed to use them then I plan on
        using heavy duty earmuffs *and* earplugs when solving a 5x5 blindfolded,
        or even a 4x4. Let&#x27;s just say I plan on getting serious for the
        bigger cubes, and I want to be just as hardcore as the Memory Champions
        with earmuffs and everything while memorizing. Chris

        Ok, I have the answer. Earmuffs/plugs are allowed because: There is no
        rule preventing people from rearing a baseball cap in comepetition, when
        I know of a few people that wear one to prevent themselves from seeing
        the audience. Why can&#x27;t people wear ear plugs to prevent them from
        hearing the audience??? And why not take it one step further, and give

        I posted on the Yahoo Group (speedsolving) a few days ago about this. I
        am looking into starting the Weekly (Sunday) Blindfold Contest again.
        Chris Hardwick used to run this, and I am looking to take it off his
        hands, and reopen it. I have 2 options, and I am just wondering which
        you would prefer. I am going to use an automated system to create the
        results tables. This is for the 3x3 &quot;competition.&quot; Option 1:
        Like in an Official Competition. Do 3 solves (or just one and say the
        others are DNS)and your Best of the 3 is what determines your rank, and
        therefore the winner, for the week. Option 2: Each scramble is its own
        &quot;competition.&quot; Whoever comes in first place in Scramble 1 will
        be awarded n points, second place, x points, third place y points, and
        so on... Scramble 2 will be awarded points the same way. Scramble 3 the
        same as well. The Winner for the week would be the one with the highest
        total number of points. I am just asking because I want to know which of
        the two people would prefer. Also, I am thinking of having an Open
        Division where you can do any puzzle that you want (cube size or other
        puzzle) and input the time. You would only do 1 scramble per week for
        the Open Division per puzzle. Does this sound reasonable for everyone???
        And which of the 2 options would you like more??? I was leaning towards
        Option 2, but I&#x27;ve heard from others to go for Option 1, and so I
        am asking you, the Blindfold community, which you would prefer. Thanks
        for reading my nonsense, Craig Bouchard May the cube be with you...

        for the 4x4 and 5x5 and best of for each category? I will do the 4x4 and
        5x5 every week, so if you provide scrambles for this to make it official
        it won&#x27;t go to waste, I&#x27;ll use them (hey free scrambles
        right?) ;-) Chris

        Hey, I don&#x27;t think people understand Option 2 too clearly, but
        ok... I may make a completely new division for the 4x4 and 5x5, like you
        say. I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be the biggest competition...lol...

        Hi JoÂ¤l, You are still young, and still have ideals. I like that. :-) I
        especially like this one: &quot; Yeah... In a lot of cases, it&#x27;s
        hard define things in hard text... It doesn&#x27;t prevent gouvernments
        from making laws... It&#x27;s the task of the gourvernment to serve the
        people. The gourvernment is my slave in that way. Just like that, I
        think WCA should do everything possible to create nice competition
        environments for competitors.. &quot; I see two differences: 1) your
        government is not only your &quot;slave&quot;, but also everyone
        else&#x27;s slave. There is no way to serve everyone. 2) you pay your
        government. And you and all the other masters should help them decide
        where they spend their money on. Actually WCA is also my slave. And I
        think they should not allow all that annoying equipment. In competitions
        people should just solve cubes and have fun, without equipment during
        the solving. And if you can find someone who is prepared to pay for
        hiring someone to check all equipment for anything other than music,
        then please let me know where I can send the bill to. Have fun, Ron

        Yeah... In a lot of cases, it&#x27;s hard define things in hard text...
        It doesn&#x27;t prevent gouvernments from making laws... It&#x27;s the

        course, I won&#x27;t bring my own chair and teddy bear etc. etc., but
        wearing headphones that nobody can hear should not be a problem. -

        when I was reading laws. One of the funny things about laws is that
        it&#x27;s very hard to make them, and they are often unpractical. But it
        doesn&#x27;t mean that the gourvernment should not make a law, even if
        it&#x27;s hard to describe certain situations in &#x27;hard text&#x27;.

        That&#x27;s an interesting point. I don&#x27;t really see why you (as a
        citizen of cubing-land) should decide for others how to behave. If
        someone else&#x27;s behavior is not in conflict with your interest, than
        why do you want to forbid that type of behavior? About the &#x27;having
        fun&#x27; argument, if you want to have fun, that&#x27;s fine with me.
        But some people just want to put their headphones on all day long, not
        making any contact with other people. Making a rule based on the idea
        that &#x27;competitors must have fun&#x27; is silly. If people
        don&#x27;t want to have fun, you can&#x27;t force them. > And if you can

        Hi Craig, I have one other idea. Maybe if people like this idea, you
        could also have one &#x27;speed blindfold&#x27;, where the memorisation
        time doesn&#x27;t count. That way, people can plan their solve very
        carefully, and only time their execution. I would certainly be
        interested in doing that :) For the normal catergory, I think &#x27;best
        of 3&#x27; is a good format. Good luck setting up the contest...! -

        HOW TO MEMORISE 555 CUBE FOR BLD ? There are 98 pieces (54 centers, 36
        edges, and 8 cornors). Out of 54 centers, 6 pieces are fixed ans solved
        already. So, there are 92 pieces we have to memorise. If you want to
        blindsolve piece by piece, then apply the peg system, decribed above in
        this page, to name the pieces and apply journey system to memorise. This
        is the system I used to blindsolve 555. If you want to blindsolve using
        3 cycle system, then apply PAO method. How to create the Persons for 92
        pieces is a difficult task. Here is the original method- DOMINIC SYSTEM,
        which my dad taught me IN 2004. As I am not familiar with those English
        names and the actions are confusing to me, I did not take it as it was..
        However, I understood the system fully well. Based on the idea of
        Dominic system I prepared my own persons and actions using my mother
        tongue TAMIL and tamil names with the help of my dad. This is the system
        I use to memorise cards, binary digits, random numbers in association
        with peg system(for objects) and journey system (to store the memorised
        information). Since, I have not learnt cycle system for blindsolving big
        cubes, I am not using this system for blindsolving big cubes. Now, I am
        interested in sharing with you all, the original Dominic system which I
        learnt in English, as almost all of you are english speaking people. The
        persons may be well known to you and the actions of them may be a
        culture, where you live. So, I think itmay be a great use to you to
        learn to memorise 555 cube. NUMBER ALPHABET 1 A 2 B 3 C 4 D 5 E 6 S 7 G

        same action such as eating, shooting, singing, playing etc are assigned
        for many persons with different object. Since, we are going to use PAO
        method for memorising 555 cube, the actiond should be unique to every
        person. That is why , I prepared my own 100 different unique actions for
        all 100 people. Hope, it is useful to many of you blindsolvers. In my
        opinion, I am able to vizualise the PAO prepared in my mother tongue
        more clearly than that of in my second languge. HAPPY MEMORISING

        Hello, I know that there are web sites where a randomly scrambled cube
        can be attempted. Do any of them allow you to blindfold solve via touch-
        typing? Has anyone ever tried this? Would it be a useful resource for a
        web site to allow you to memorise several cubes and then to solve them
        by touch-typing? I don´t own more than 1 cube and I think that I might
        benefit from a resource like that. Mike

        Ear plugs and earmuffs should not be allowed for the same reason
        headphones are not allowed. There is still opportunity for vindictive

        Just one. One that solves the cube. Computed with ACube or Cube Explorer
        after your buddy who solved first described the scrambled cube to you.
        On the other hand, if you can memorize a sequence of 20 turns then you
        don&#x27;t need the muffs. Muffs are from the &quot;cheating for

        It&#x27;s not as much of the &quot;cheating&quot; factor as people
        should really be unaided while solving the cube. Everyone has to deal
        with the same circumstances. I can also almost guarantee that if you
        play music on headphones, I can hear it if I&#x27;m standing next to
        you. You would have to play your music too softly for you to hear for it

        Uh yeah. It would, but what are you going to do if they actually solved
        it that way? That&#x27;s why I believe Fewest Move competition should
        utilize 40 move scrambling algorithms and should definitely not be
        allowed to use 25 move scrambling algorithms. &quot;I had some divine
        inspiration and figured out the 25 moves! Whoa, it just happens to be
        the inverse of the scramble.&quot; There&#x27;s nothing anyone can do to
        absolutely refute that. You might as well play it safe. Tyson Mao

        I am going deliberately slowly - and peeking as well. So, I have no
        personal best. And I think that I generally ask questions at this group
        and use it to Â¤brain-stormÂ¤. Recently, I posted about the technique
        which I have developed because I really really enjoy the challenge of
        the logistics of the problem. I like this group because it overlaps with
        my memory interest. I think that, without time being a factor, what
        interests me is making a solution that is robust and my own - even if it
        is awkward or disadvantaging compared with other methods. ItÂ¤s like my
        keepie-uppie. I could never beat the world record (I would need to stop
        and go to the toilet) but it makes me happy to do it. But I have
        recently recommended people in a memory group to take on the RubikÂ¤s
        Cube (doing many in one attempt) because the problem naturally lends
        itself to mnemonics. I would particularly like some software so that I
        can research the Â¤many cubesÂ¤ challenge and go back to a saved session
        and examine where the solution went wrong and where there are peeks and
        troughs of concentration. Mike --- Stefan Pochmann &lt;pochmann@...>

        Wait, does that mean you&#x27;ve never truly solved a Rubik&#x27;s cube

        How is it fair to me if someone listens to music and I have to deal with
        the residual noise from those earphones? &quot;Oh, I&#x27;ll keep it
        quiet enough so that other people can&#x27;t hear.&quot; What&#x27;s
        your definition of &quot;can&#x27;t hear&quot;? People have different
        levels of hearing. You might think something is ridiculously quiet, but
        if I can hear it, it would be a distraction to me. MP3 players and CD
        players can sometimes make a very high pitched noise that people who use
        headphones can&#x27;t hear because their hearing has been damaged. See
        if you can still hear up to 20 KHz. Most people can&#x27;t anymore, but
        people who protect their hearing probably can. Tyson Mao Astrophysics

        Slightly off-topic, but I have a question about this method. If I&#x27;m
        new to BLD, should I learn to use the POA method? Obviously it seems to
        be somewhat of a craze, and everyone is talking about how it&#x27;s such
        a powerful method. I don&#x27;t plan on ever attempting to solve my 4x4
        or a 5x5 blindfolded, so is this method unnecessary? Should I learn some
        other method first? David JohnLouis Louis &lt;pjlmem@...> wrote: HOW TO
        MEMORISE 555 CUBE FOR BLD ? There are 98 pieces (54 centers, 36 edges,
        and 8 cornors). Out of 54 centers, 6 pieces are fixed ans solved
        already. So, there are 92 pieces we have to memorise. If you want to
        blindsolve piece by piece, then apply the peg system, decribed above in
        this page, to name the pieces and apply journey system to memorise. This
        is the system I used to blindsolve 555. If you want to blindsolve using
        3 cycle system, then apply PAO method. How to create the Persons for 92
        pieces is a difficult task. Here is the original method- DOMINIC SYSTEM,
        which my dad taught me IN 2004. As I am not familiar with those English
        names and the actions are confusing to me, I did not take it as it was..
        However, I understood the system fully well. Based on the idea of
        Dominic system I prepared my own persons and actions using my mother
        tongue TAMIL and tamil names with the help of my dad. This is the system
        I use to memorise cards, binary digits, random numbers in association
        with peg system(for objects) and journey system (to store the memorised
        information). Since, I have not learnt cycle system for blindsolving big
        cubes, I am not using this system for blindsolving big cubes. Now, I am
        interested in sharing with you all, the original Dominic system which I
        learnt in English, as almost all of you are english speaking people. The
        persons may be well known to you and the actions of them may be a
        culture, where you live. So, I think itmay be a great use to you to
        learn to memorise 555 cube. NUMBER ALPHABET 1 A 2 B 3 C 4 D 5 E 6 S 7 G

        for speedsolving, it would be nice. And, during speedsovling, the

        6 pieces are fixed ans solved already. So, there are 92 pieces we have
        to memorise. If you want to blindsolve piece by piece, then apply the
        peg system, decribed above in this page, to name the pieces and apply
        journey system to memorise. This is the system I used to blindsolve 555.
        If you want to blindsolve using 3 cycle system, then apply PAO method.
        How to create the Persons for 92 pieces is a difficult task. Here is the
        original method- DOMINIC SYSTEM, which my dad taught me IN 2004. As I am
        not familiar with those English names and the actions are confusing to
        me, I did not take it as it was.. However, I understood the system fully
        well. Based on the idea of Dominic system I prepared my own persons and
        actions using my mother tongue TAMIL and tamil names with the help of my
        dad. This is the system I use to memorise cards, binary digits, random
        numbers in association with peg system(for objects) and journey system
        (to store the memorised information). Since, I have not learnt cycle
        system for blindsolving big cubes, I am not using this system for
        blindsolving big cubes. Now, I am interested in sharing with you all,
        the original Dominic system which I learnt in English, as almost all of
        you are english speaking people. The persons may be well known to you
        and the actions of them may be a culture, where you live. So, I think
        itmay be a great use to you to learn to memorise 555 cube. NUMBER

        we are going to use PAO method for memorising 555 cube, the actiond
        should be unique to every person. That is why , I prepared my own 100
        different unique actions for all 100 people. Hope, it is useful to many
        of you blindsolvers. In my opinion, I am able to vizualise the PAO

        Hey guys, Most of you know I have been working on solving in three
        cycles Pochmann style (cycling the stickers). This can solve 2 edges at
        a time. I have been making &#x27;procedures&#x27;/strategy&#x27;s in
        order to make this easy (strategy&#x27;s that describe how to handle
        every type of situation that can occor). While making these
        strategy&#x27;s at first, I ended up describing almost all 440 cases I
        can get with this method... (That is, every three cycle of stickers that
        start at UR). So now I am almost done making a simpler procedure, that
        will have a bit more, but easier setup moves (usually 2 or so). Now,
        since I started making these tables, I didn&#x27;t try a lot BLD
        solves... But today, Craig asked me to race him with the webcam... At
        first, I didn&#x27;t want to, because I didn&#x27;t feel like I was up
        for it... But he convinced me to do it anyway... And I got a PB of
        2:20.91!!! Which is extremely good for me.. The cool thing about this
        solve was, that during memorization, I didn&#x27;t only memorise the
        letters, but I was also thinking to myself: &#x27;Here I can use that
        alg, there I will use that commutator&#x27;. This was in fact also a way
        of memorization! And it made memorisation go a lot easier than usual. To
        give you guys an idea of how a nice solve with three cycles lookes like,
        here is the sramble, with my solution: Scramble: U F L2 D2 F U R B F2
        U&#x27; D2 F D L F2 U&#x27; L U R2 U2 B R&#x27; D2 R L2 Defenitions: C
        := (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;
        R&#x27; F R) (Corner alg) J := (L&#x27; U) (R U&#x27;) (L U2&#x27;)
        (R&#x27; U) (R U2 R&#x27;) T := RUR&#x27;U&#x27; R&#x27;F
        R2U&#x27;RU&#x27; RUR&#x27;F&#x27; Corners: 1. DF&#x27; C FD&#x27; 2.

        D2 L2 T L2 D2 The edges were solve in about 72 moves (counting slice
        moves as 1). 4 three cycles solved 8 edges :). Well.. That&#x27;s it for
        now! Have fun! - Joël.

        Hey everyone, So I know my first message was really long, but I&#x27;m
        curious what you all think? I&#x27;m still curious how others solve the
        cycles too, since this is the first thought that popped into my head
        when I first started thinking about BLD cubing for the larger cubes. In
        fact I had to learn about Stefan&#x27;s big cube extension for his
        method from hearing it from him personally to learn that others do
        things differently. I&#x27;m very partial to using freestyle cycles just
        because I&#x27;m used to them, but I&#x27;m always interested in
        learning about new methods. Somebody post some ideas, I&#x27;m curious
        what you all use and/or what you all think of freestyle cycling! Chris

        I think the freestyle commutators are great -- virtually no algs needed
        for memorization, but rather the process. It&#x27;s all really intuitive
        and I think it&#x27;s great, but the only downside I can see to it is
        the whole figuring out if two edges are left/right on the same layer,
        and figuring out how to get the third piece into where it needs to know
        without affecting the slice, but that seems to be the extent of the
        difficulty (unless setup moves are really hard for people). However I
        don&#x27;t know what they mean for BLD solving in terms of speed or if
        it&#x27;s easier to just use certain cycling algs similar to that of a
        3x3, but I guess it depends on how fast you can setup the commutators. I
        mean there are moves like F2 r B2 r&#x27; F2 r B2 r&#x27; that cycle
        wings and don&#x27;t require the use of an extensive commutator. I think
        it&#x27;s a personal preference. I am also curious, Chris, how you go
        about memorizes the central edges and wings of the cube? --- In

        people). Yeah I agree, the hardest part is making sure the pieces are
        setup in a way that you can use a commutator to cycle them. On example
        is this cycle (rUF->uFR->dFR) which I use (Uu) as my setup alg making
        the cycle (fUL->uFL->dFR) and I group uFL and dFR on the F slice and
        make fUL the lone edge. With practice you usually only need 1 setup
        turn, and somewhat often you can group two pieces on a face and have a
        lone edge just by the way you view the cube. > However I don&#x27;t know

        there are moves like F2 r B2 r&#x27; F2 r > B2 r&#x27; that cycle wings
        and don&#x27;t require the use of an extensive > commutator. I think
        it&#x27;s a personal preference. Actually I use that type of commutator
        in my solving (F2 r B2 r&#x27; F2 r B2 r&#x27;). It treats rUF and lDF
        as the two pieces in one face (both left edges) and the piece at lDB is
        the lone edge. The alg r B2 r&#x27; places the lone edge (lDB) into the
        spot rUF and the F2 turn moves lDF over to rUF. Let S=F2 and A=r B2
        r&#x27; and do the commutator as SAS&#x27;A&#x27; to get the alg you
        just gave. Pretty much any alg you use to cycle edges on a 4x4x4 will
        have to be a commutator, unless it is an RrUu type alg in which case
        maybe it doesn&#x27;t have to be a commutator and can just take
        advantage of the rules of RrUu solving. Other than that using a move to
        cycle edges will almost have to be a commutator to be a short useful alg
        to use. > I am also curious, > Chris, how you go about memorizes the
        central edges and wings of >the > cube? I used to do this by rote memory
        and just picture the shapes they made inside the cube, or think this
        piece jumps down to over here, then steps to the side and climbs a
        ladder up to the U face again. My experience in Georgia taught me that
        this is not a good idea because by your 4th solve you remember bits and
        pieces of your setups from other cubes, since the information is all in
        the same format. I&#x27;m currently creating PAO triplets of letters for
        my edges and the centralmost edges and corners for the 5x5. I may
        memorize the corners of the 4x4 visually still since it would go so
        quickly that way anyway, but I would prefer to memorize everything PAO
        style for the 5x5 to avoid any interference in a competition. Competing
        in Georgia really unnerved me and made me rethink my style of memorizing
        completely. I highly recommend you try a couple solves in competition
        Marcus, it can really show you whether or not your method is a good one
        for handling interference from previous solves or not since you
        don&#x27;t get much time between solves. My memorization method is great
        for memorizing at home in a quiet environment taking a long pause
        between solves, but it sucks horribly for doing this in competition.
        Hence the reason I scrapped in completely in favor of PAO and just
        having LOTS of journeys prepared to be able to do a number of solves in
        a row. Just my $0.02, Chris

        Hey Craig and anyone else interested, I do the centers the same way as I
        do the edges, only the rules are a bit different. I always use freestyle
        commutators, and the rules you have to follow for edges don&#x27;t
        really apply so much to the 4x4. Ok so here are some examples.
        lfU->rfD->rbD->lfU slice: r slice lone center: lfU S=f2 A=r F&#x27;
        r&#x27; do as SAS&#x27;A&#x27; -------------------------
        lbU->dfL->drF->lbU slice: d slice lone center: lbU S=d A=r U2 r&#x27; do
        as SAS&#x27;A&#x27; ------------------------- lbU->rfU->lfD->lbU setup
        moves P=l&#x27; F2 l leaving lbU->rfU->drF->lbU slice: U slice lone
        center: drF A=l&#x27; d2 l S=U2 do as PASA&#x27;S&#x27;P&#x27;
        ------------------------- And lots more where that came from. Again just
        get two pieces in one slice, one piece off that slice as the lone
        center. Move the lone center to the spot it needs to go without
        disturbing anything else on that slice, move the other one of the two
        pieces into the working location, then undo both in commutator order to
        finish a 3 cycle. Hope this helps, Chris --- In

        hi guys! as you probably know i tried to solve 5 3x3x3cubes blindfolded
        at SveKub Annual Meeting 2006 in norrkÂ¤ping. i memorized all of them in
        1 hour and 1 minute. the first one was not very difficult. 2 corners to
        orient. i started with this step and did the mistake: instead of
        twisting the first clockwise and the second counterclockwise i did the
        first counterclockwise..... the rest was ok. so 2 corners have been
        oriented bad. in the second i had an easy setup move: L2 D2, but when i
        had to undo it, i did D&#x27; L2. the rest was ok, so at the end 4 edges
        and 4 corners have been at the wrong position, but everything was
        oriented correctly. the next two have been solved correctly, and at the
        last, i just forgot 2 corner orientations. the funniest thing is: for
        the first cube i tried a new route, which i only used once. all of my
        other routes have 25 stations (8 for corners, 12 for edges, and 5 for
        orientations), but this one had only 24. i tried to forget the verry
        last edge. you dont have to memorize it. during the solve i forgot one
        station, so at the end i saw, that something does not fit togehter.
        there was no parity. so i had to undo the last 3 cycles and i did the
        rest correctly. i will now change to the PAO-methode and use it at the
        german cube day, where i will try to solve 5 cubes blindfolded again.
        and i m ust learn a new methode to memorize the corner orientations. by
        the way: stefan, what are your actual bld-times? do i have to practise a
        lot to defend the new german record or are you still using the pochmann
        methode? :) thomas -- Bis zu 70% Ihrer Onlinekosten sparen: GMX

        Hi all- I&#x27;ve been blindfold cubing since December, and I&#x27;ve
        just recently started attempting blindfold solves with my primary
        speedsolve method, CFOP. I&#x27;ve tried three times over the past month
        or so and have yet to actually solve it (but, each time, I&#x27;ve
        figured out my exact mistake the second I opened my eyes). The first two
        tries were well over 2 hrs each, with about 30 seconds of solving. About
        10 minutes ago, I ended my third attempt to find my closest to being
        solved yet as well as the most obvious mistake. I had done the OLL from
        the wrong side of the cube and opened my eyes to find the LL corners in
        the Pi/Bruno orientation. The &quot;solve&quot; was as follows:
        (formatted properly for http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/wrapplet.asp
        ) [Scramble]B&#x27; D F U L&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27; B2 D U&#x27; R&#x27;
        U&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; B2 D R&#x27; B2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R D&#x27; R
        D&#x27; B&#x27; [Cross]y R&#x27; F&#x27; D2 R&#x27; F2 D [F2L1]U&#x27; R
        U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; [F2L2]F U2 F&#x27; U2 F U&#x27; F&#x27;

        U&#x27; R [OLL]L F U F&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; l F U F&#x27; U&#x27;
        l&#x27; [PLL]U y2 R&#x27; U R&#x27; d&#x27; x2 R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27;
        x&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U x&#x27; It was scrambled with yellow on
        top, red in front, but solved (for some reason) with yellow on top,
        green in front. I guess I just rotated the cube without noticing. The y
        accounts for that rotation. I used JNetCube to time memorization +
        solving, then started my stackmat at the beginning of the solve. The odd
        thing was that memorization was about 50 minutes. That&#x27;s about half
        of what memorization was for my other solves. Solving was 39.16 seconds,
        way longer than usual, and longer than my previous attempts, but oh
        well. I didn&#x27;t want to mess up in the solving phase when I had such
        a better memorization time. Judging by my sharp decrease in time,
        I&#x27;m going to probably become more interested in speed blindfold
        cubing. I wonder: How will this affect my speedcubing? Maybe I&#x27;ll
        get better at looking ahead for F2L. Maybe I&#x27;ll get out of the
        habit of rotating a billion times during F2L. Maybe I&#x27;ll get better
        at finding a C/E pair during preinspection. Who knows. Is anyone else
        into this blindfolded category? I notice that, on speedcubing.com, Chris
        Hardwick is the only person to have submitted a time for this. Geir
        Ugelstad did it at RWC &#x27;05; is anyone else doing/trying it now? Tim

        rotation. I used JNetCube to time memorization + solving, then started
        my stackmat at the beginning of the solve. The odd thing was that

        Hey Tim, I&#x27;ve only ever attempted this twice, but yes I enjoy the
        speed blindsolving category. I&#x27;m sorry that you&#x27;ve had
        DNF&#x27;s so far, but just remember that for any type of blindsolving
        any practice is good practice. BLD cubing in any form is a brain
        workout, so even if you get a DNF at least you still got the brain
        workout and are getting used to the mental effort required. What method
        do you use to memorize? I focus on one sticker per piece, and I number
        the stickers 1-14. I always solve at least an Xcross by visual
        inspection, so I never have to number those 6 pieces. If I manage a
        double extended cross, then I number the pieces 1-12. With 10-12 minutes
        of inspection you can usually spot something really nice for the cross
        and first pair, and the goal is to do a double extended cross if
        possible. After that I track the location change of each sticker through
        the extended cross solve. This is not very efficient as far as
        memorizing goes, but it makes your solve really efficient which is what
        I go for. So after solving a good portion at the start visually, you now
        have a mental layout of the next stage of the cube. Then just look at
        all your options and choose the one that lets you continue the fastest.
        So maybe I would choose an RU style F2L alg, or if there is an empty
        slot case that&#x27;s only 5 moves I would choose that. Always choose
        the way that let&#x27;s you continue the fastest. Then track every piece
        left through those moves and you end up with an updated state of the
        cube. Again, updating every piece like this after every alg is
        ridiculously inefficient as far as memorizing goes, but it allows you to
        consider every possible option for your next step, and make the best
        decision of how to procede from there. I number the F2L pieces the
        highest numbers (9 and up) and I number the LL the lowest numbers (1-8).
        This is because you solve F2L pieces before the LL obviously, and once
        pieces are solved you forget them completely to save memory. So I choose
        to forget the higher numbers and just always be trying to remember where
        1-8 is during F2L (where my LL is during the F2L). Also, knowing the
        state of the LL at all times gives you the option of influencing the LL
        at any point if you want. So you can do partial edge control during the
        4th F2L pair, or even make sure that you end up with all oriented edges
        after the last pair, stuff like that. I view speed blindfold as going
        for the best solve possible, even if it takes a very, very long time to
        memorize. Also, one thing that helps me is that after I have memorized
        my entire solve I rehearse it with my hands on my &quot;air cube&quot;
        many times. This helps to make sure your hands are used to the solve
        enough to try to go fast. Don&#x27;t feel bad if it looks funny, it puts
        your solve into muscle memory with your hands as well as your short term
        memory in your head, which is a good thing! Again I don&#x27;t know if
        you already use or do this but I just wanted to post what I do in case
        you were looking for some pointers. It&#x27;s a fun category, but boy is
        it stressful! Especially when you first start doing moves on your cube!
        Good luck to you, and let us know how your progress goes! Chris P.S.
        Craig good luck too with speed blindfold solving!

        Hi Tim, I never tried this, and I don&#x27;t think I ever will (with a
        normal speedcubing method). I don&#x27;t exactly see the fun of it :).
        But I really admire people who have the patience to study the cube for 2
        hours or so to do this! One of the things I do want to try, is to do a
        speedblindsolve with a normal blindfold cubing method. I think with my
        method, it&#x27;s fairly easy to get under a minute. I think 40 seconds
        would also be doable. I&#x27;ll try it once.. - Joël. --- In

        Hi Chris- My method is vastly different. I don&#x27;t do xcrosses in
        speedsolving, and I don&#x27;t really try in this either. First I find a
        regular cross...the one that I used last time (R&#x27; F&#x27; D2
        R&#x27; F2 D) was good since it didn&#x27;t disturb the LUB 2x2x2 block,
        which is good since while tracking pieces down they stayed where they
        were for the cross. Then I pick a bottom layer corner and watch what
        happens (in my head) when I execute the cross. If it&#x27;s in the LL or
        in the right slot, I find the corresponding edge and do the same thing.
        If they&#x27;re both good, I figure out the F2L case (definately
        attempting to do 2-gen wherever possible). Then I go through each F2L
        pair and do the same thing (each one being harder than the last as I
        have to follow it through more turns). Once I&#x27;ve finished F2L in my
        head, I&#x27;ll redo it. I&#x27;ll pick the first CE pair (first the
        corner then the edge) and check that it is solved. Then the next and so
        on. After that, I&#x27;ll be done with F2L in my head (I usually
        don&#x27;t have any trouble remembering it since I will have executed
        each algorithm a few times in my head). LL time. I look at edges first.
        Again, back to the beginning and execute the entire solve. I then put
        that piece where it is on the LL. The last one is basically a way of
        checking what I&#x27;d done up till then. If two pieces are in one spot,
        or the orientation is bad, I&#x27;ll know something&#x27;s wrong. Once I
        finish edges, I convert the permutation into arrows indicating where
        each piece needs to move and store the orientation in my head. Then I do
        basically the exact same thing for corners. So I&#x27;ll have a
        permutation and an orientation. I don&#x27;t convert it to numbers; I
        just convert it to 1 or 2 PLL&#x27;s. For instance, using the keyboard
        numberpad idea that Macky uses on his PLL page, the permutation I had at
        the beginning of OLL on that last solve was (7 9) (1 3) (2 8 4). I
        remembered that as a combination of the E and U permutations (for
        distinguishing between U&#x27;s...I guess I just remembered that the
        piece going across was front to back and that it used the left edge) So
        then I&#x27;ll figure out the OLL; not hard since I&#x27;ll know what it
        looks like. Then I&#x27;ll take that OLL and figure out how the pieces
        are permuted. For the OLL I used, it was a Z permutation with front
        switching with left. I guess if I wanted to really get serious about
        this, I could do one of two things. One is learn what each OLL does, a
        feasible idea. Second is learn orientation that doesn&#x27;t disturb
        permutation, an idea i&#x27;m not so crazy about. So, anyway, I took the
        Z permutation and applied it to the permutation I had before. It was
        easy since Z leaves corners alone. Then I had a new permutation, the E
        permutation plus the U permutation going L -> B - > R. Then I figured
        out what PLL that turned into. I knew that the edges weren&#x27;t
        solved, so it would be a diagonal swap. So I tried doing a U turn in my
        mind and saw that two edges were solved, and the two that needed to swap
        were in F and L. The LF and BR corners were solved, so it was the V
        permutation. I figured out which way I held the cube for that (it comes
        naturally when you can see it, but not so much when you can&#x27;t).
        Then I was done. blindfold on, start the camera (in case I solve it or
        can&#x27;t figure out where I went wrong) and stackmat, and go. I&#x27;m
        not great at xcrosses in regular speedcubing, so I don&#x27;t think
        I&#x27;ll really try that here yet. Keeping closer track after each F2L
        might help me so I don&#x27;t have to search for each piece. Also I
        might try partial edge control or simply orienting all edges. I&#x27;m
        just afraid of getting things too complicated to figure out in my head.
        Thanks for all your advice. I&#x27;m going to start another attempt in
        about half an hour. Hopefully I&#x27;ll solve it this time! Tim

        Hehehe, Stefan, I&#x27;m interested, just so you know...And I think I am
        unofficially the fastest person with your method...got it today...30
        seconds memo, 2 seconds to put on the BLD, total time of 1:50.16 I had a
        witness sitting on the other side of the table. I was talking to Tyson,
        and I think we figured out a limit for using your basic method. Assuming
        there is no pauses between algs and setup moves: 30 seconds for memo is
        probably the limit. Say each alg (including setup and setdown moves)
        takes 4 seconds, the fastest non-lucky would be 4 algs for corners + 8
        for edges, so 12 algs. Saying each alg takes 4 seconds...thats 48
        seconds for execution, with no pauses... 30 + 48 = 78 seconds, and that
        is on the easiest case. The absolute WORST case would be: Considering
        the Parity fix...that brings in a whole new ball game. And Stefan: If I
        have 2 edges oriented wrong at the end I just set them up and do a 2
        flip, instead of executing the T perm 4 times, or J perm or w/e... (all
        corners in place, but oriented wrong) 14 for corners + 22 for edges
        (obviously this will never happen...but...) 36 * 4 = 144 seconds
        (considering perfect execution) Which is 2 minutes 24 seconds...add that
        to the memorization (which actually wouldn&#x27;t be long, except for
        the corners) you get about a 3 minute solve...so maybe this isn&#x27;t
        the worst case, because it is so easily recognized and memorized, but
        something along these lines...I&#x27;m just saying, with the cycles
        method that Leyan and Tyson and many others use, I think sub-1 would be
        possible (if you took Tyson&#x27;s memo with Leyan&#x27;s execution,
        with a little more practice) Sorry, I&#x27;m rambling again...hehe...

        Re: the parity fix in Stefan&#x27;s method... To tell you the truth, I
        don&#x27;t do a parity fix. Well, sometimes I do, but usually I just
        memorize the corners the way they would be after swapping the two UR
        corners. Then again, my times and consistency aren&#x27;t that amazing,
        so I&#x27;m not the expert in BLD. Another comment: For the DR edge,
        instead of the setup move D2 L2 to do the T permutation, one can always
        just do S&#x27; and the T permutation. If you&#x27;re doing a 3x3 super
        BLD, that might throw you off, but doing it in on a regular cube is

        between algs and setup moves: 30 seconds for memo is probably the limit.
        Say each alg (including setup and setdown moves) takes 4 seconds, the

        Saying each alg takes 4 seconds...thats 48 seconds for execution, with

        Keep an eye out on Google Video, I am uploading a new movie showing an
        attempt at solving three 3x3x3 cubes blindfolded. The total time is
        8:46:88 Looking at the video itself the total memorization was about
        three minutes (like about 56 seconds per cube plus like 5 seconds for
        re- examinining the CO cases for two cubes). Solving was like 5 minutes
        and ~40 seconds roughly or a little under two minutes per cube. For

        Hey everyone, I just wanted to say that I didn&#x27;t disappear,
        I&#x27;m still learning PAO. Last night, with the help of a bunch of
        cubers over IM, I finally finished my triplets for the 5x5x5. What I did
        to handle a 5x5x5 is this, I used the letters A-W and Y for each of the
        center orbits and the wing edges. So I have 72 pictures each with the
        three person action object parts. I just finished them last night
        literally, so I still have to apply them to my cube and make sure I have
        them memorized. I so far only have one journey with 24 locations, so I
        can handle the edges and centers of a 4x4x4 (doing the corners my
        regular way for now) only for one solve. So I&#x27;m very behind on my
        journeys and also on applying my new triplets to my cubes, but I&#x27;m
        getting there slowly but surely. I want very much to use something
        similar to PAO for the 3x3x3 which would also mean for the central edges
        and corners of a 5x5x5 and part of that system for the corners of a 2x2.
        What I am thinking of doing is using the Major system for the 3x3x3, and
        applying it to use like Joel does for the edges. So I will have 24
        pictures telling me where the piece goes and how to flip it when i move
        it there, that way I can use commutators. I guess I&#x27;ll still use
        orient first then permute for the corners, but I might consider using
        commutators for this part too. Anyway does anyone have any advice on
        applying the Major system to the 3x3x3? I&#x27;ve seen that the letters
        MNRSTP tend to come up more often than A-H or A-L for the corners and
        edges. I would rather be using what the memory experts use here if
        possible. Alright, well I&#x27;m very excited to be almost ready to use
        PAO for my solving. I&#x27;ve been taking a break from using my old
        method, but I think I still might not be ready to use PAO by the April
        tournament in Tennesse where I&#x27;ll attempt the 4x4x4, so I think
        I&#x27;ll just use my old stuff in April, then completely give it up for
        PAO afterward. Alright, well I just wanted to post to say I haven&#x27;t
        disappeared, I just found that coming up with 72 triplets is not easy
        and I still have the 20 pieces that make up a 3x3x3 cube as well *sigh*
        Can anyone offer any help on using Major for the 3x3? Marcus I know you
        do this, which letters do you like for the pieces? I would be very
        appreciative of any help from anyone on this. Thanks all, and I hope to
        be a PAO memorizer myself soon!! Chris

        system for corner permutation using the letters TNSHRDL, although
        sometimes I might substitute the D for a P if it makes more sense. I
        think I gave you such an example of how to use Major with the permutes
        last night on IM, lol &quot;NDHLR&quot; diirrtyy. The thing about PAO,
        is while it&#x27;s powerful, the learning curve is huge. Many memory
        experts from what I&#x27;ve seen use PAO constantly in everyday life and
        develop a strong sense of instant translation after years of practice.
        This is why I think PAO may discourage people initially because the
        system&#x27;s complex in terms of integrating it into your
        &quot;reflexive memory.&quot; While it may increase accuracy, I
        don&#x27;t know what it would mean for speed. The &quot;speed over
        time&quot; graph under PAO would probably stay very high for a while
        then take a sudden nosedive... but the question is, how long is one
        willing to practice for that nosedive? And, for a 3x3x3, is that
        nosedive even worth it if the information can be stored in an easy
        format that does not require extensive PAO foundational structures? >

        appreciative of any help from anyone on this. I don&#x27;t really use
        the Major system for CO or for EO, but it can be useful for permutations
        of course, and I use it for corners (I&#x27;ve actually used vector
        structures a little less now for accuracy reasons, although it does
        sacrifice a bit of speed at first). I am sure it would work well for
        edges too, I just haven&#x27;t done it. Just use consonants (not
        vowels!) for the pieces. I&#x27;ve just found that with so many edges it
        can be a hassle determining where cycles end as a long string of letters
        can be broken into many words, etc. The endpoints of the cycles can get
        confused with the endpoints of a given word, but for corners this rarely
        happens because it&#x27;s pretty easy to make one word per cycle, or two
        if you want to stretch it, but with edges... in my experience, Major
        system can be a little messy.

        Hey everyone, What do you guys think would be better? To use PAO for the
        permutation of every piece, and to just use visualization for the
        orientation of corners. OR would it be better to use PAO for the centers
        and wing edges, then to use the Major method for the corners and central
        edges? I have PAO triplets for 72 pieces and I&#x27;m not excited about
        the idea of coming up with 20 more but if it would be better than using
        72 PAO and 20 Major then I can do that. What do you guys think? Chris

        Hi all, I haven&#x27;t had a second successful blindfold solve yet. My
        DNF&#x27;s however have been closer to solved and the times much faster.
        This makes me happy :) The PAO method has inspired me in other ways
        besides bld cubing. I plan on learning many more memorization techniques
        and prepare for events that would occur in a memory tournament. Perhaps
        after some work I could compete :) I&#x27;ve applied PAO to memorizing
        binary. Within 1 hour of applying this technique I was able to memorize
        24 binary in under 10 seconds. I haven&#x27;t pushed the limit yet until
        I am comfortable with my system. I am also interested in memorizing
        playing cards. I think the PAO method would still be good for this.
        I&#x27;m also interested in memorizing random numbers and I&#x27;ll
        probably use the peg system for that. Also, a common memory event at
        competitions is memorizing text. excerpts from a book, poetry, etc. What
        technique is applied here? It just seems so wild. Sorry about the
        mostly-not-cube-related post everyone. Best Regards, -Richard

        keep the cube info from crossing over sometimes, but I found that using
        a different color scheme can help separate data subconsciously. What
        approaches do you guys use for relays?

        Hello all, I&#x27;m a new member here, this is my first post, coming
        about an hour after my first successful blindfolded 3x3x3 solve! I
        wasn&#x27;t running a timer, but I would estimate about 15~ minutes of
        memorization and about 5 minutes of solving time. I just picked up the
        rubik&#x27;s cube about 3 or so months ago and have been hooked since! I
        hope to improve my blindfold times and maybe when my 4x4x4 arrives in
        the mail, I will begin hammering out a way to blindfold solve that. :) I
        have been seeing a lot of stuff on here about the &#x27;PAO&#x27;
        method, but I cannot find a link that explains exactly what it is and I
        am very interested in learning about it, can somebody point me to the
        right place to read about it?

        I&#x27;m not sure if there is a page on this method, but here is a short
        description. You assign each piece a Person, Action, and Object. Then,
        as you are memorizing, the first piece is a Person, and the next piece
        is the Action that the Person is doing. The third piece is the Object
        that is being done in the Action. You then place this combination in a
        loacation on a journey, such as your trip to work or school. You can
        then recall this while you are solving. Hope that helps. Peter Greenwood

        I request a only one link exchange with Gilles Roux a long time ago for
        the french communauty, he refuse. Petrus use a personnel method and Roux
        use the information for his method. Petrus is not Roux, open your eye
        but he is a good creative method and funny video, I like that ! Roux use
        a average 19 sec. official and he is good in English not me. Anyway,
        I&#x27;m a winner of 25e of cube. Sebastien use a average official of 24
        with my method and my system is better without inspection. My method
        2x2x2 is good and Gustav is 2e best single. My system for the fewest
        move is beautiful, the lesson of cube. Sorry for u, u or u but after

        I&#x27;ve been trawling through the blindfold PDF of richards, but I
        find the description somewhat confusing of his 3x3x3 method. I
        understand everything apart from the edge permutation. I know that a
        string of numbers is memorised, and it tells where every piece wants to
        go on the cube. Not in a &#x27;conventional&#x27; way of memorising
        (like cycles) but like a list. The thing I don&#x27;t get is. When you
        cycle pieces around, what do you update in your memory when you do a
        3-cycle? I think editing specific values in a list would be good (each
        item in list corresponding to cubie) but i don&#x27;t get what to edit
        :) (obviously the cubes you&#x27;re working with but....) Could someone
        provide me with an example solve/explanation? I think i&#x27;m on teh

        Corner orientation in two steps; 16 algs. Recently, I&#x27;ve been
        playing around with new methods, (notably playing around with some of
        Joel&#x27;s things) and I&#x27;ve created the basics of a new method.
        This is the only part of the method that is currently finished. The 16
        algs are new ones I&#x27;ve created. I&#x27;m assuming you know the
        standard 7 that people usually use in BLD. If you don&#x27;t, the entire
        system requires 23 algorithms to be learnt. Technically, there are no
        setup moves. But you will need to understand the concept to be able to
        do this. The algs shouldn&#x27;t be longer than 16 moves. I just did an
        optimal solve run on them all in Cube Explorer, they arn&#x27;t
        optimised for speed. Two steps is the worst case senario. Basically, you
        solve the U layer in one of 23 algorithms, then you solve the D layer
        with one of 7. I suggest you at least try this out. I like it :)

        Thom, Mike Bennet and I have been playing with this idea for a few
        months, though we were keeping it secret until we knew it was going to
        work :) Thanks for bring it to the public :P We&#x27;ve already started
        a page for all the cases. Maybe we can team up on the effort? The only

        Haha, I thought something like this was going to happen to me! Not the
        other way around. Sorry I published it :P Feel free to use my algs or
        ask me for anymore. I&#x27;m trying to create a new set that are
        optimised with U and R turns. I thought my page/method/idea is finished
        but maybe we can pool ideas and improve it further? Maybe create a joint
        system? I think today I shall spend learning the algs. I&#x27;ll then do
        an average of KCO blindfolded. Stefan: do you mean removing mirrors and
        inverses? I don&#x27;t fully understand you. Hopefully no-one&#x27;s
        thought of the following as an edge permutation system? (already
        orientated) Pemutate edges to E slice, permutate edges within E slice +
        fix parity with corners. Bring edges to respective layers. Permutate all
        edges within U/D. I don&#x27;t know how feasable this would be but 4
        algs to complete edge permutation sounds nice :) Probibly have to learn
        too many though. If so, I&#x27;ll simplify things a bit. Or maybe
        it&#x27;s too much like Carr&#x27;s system. It uses his method of
        memorisation. Thanks, ~Thom --- In

        How about this: Pemutate E in two steps Pemutate U/D in two steps :) The
        steps for U/D would be putting them to their respective layers (eg.
        M&#x27; U2 M2 U2 M&#x27;) And then permutating them within their layers
        (eg. F2 r2 U M2 U D2 M&#x27; E2 M R2 b2) So it&#x27;s always done in
        four steps. (As you can see, I&#x27;m already getting this method

        Swapping one set from top to bottom is easy. One edge: M&#x27; U2 M U2
        Two edges: M&#x27; U2 M2 U2 M&#x27; F2 D L2 F2 L2 D R&#x27; L D2 R L
        Three edges: L&#x27; B2 L2 F2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R&#x27; Four Edges: L2
        F2 R2 B2 F2 R2 F2 R2 With those, you can do every case with next to no
        setup moves. If you learn a few more algs, you do it with no setup
        moves. Swapping a large number of edges shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.
        When you get to doing the last eight edges, you should have a string of
        numbers that is eight numbers long (1 2 3 4 9 10 11 12 == solved) that
        you match upto an alg in your head. Here&#x27;s an example solve of what
        I mean. Scramble: U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; F2 L&#x27; F2 D&#x27;
        B&#x27; R2 U&#x27; F D L&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; D F2 U&#x27; B L2 F2 R2
        U2 B&#x27; corner orientation: U2 F2 R2 U&#x27; L&#x27; U L B2 L D
        L&#x27; B2 R2 F2 U&#x27; z2 x2 z (R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; L&#x27;
        U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L) z&#x27; x2 Then go about permutating the
        corners, when you hit the parity, just swap UF and UB. Now orientate the
        edges. place two E edges: y2xB&#x27;F&#x27; (Zperm) B F x&#x27;y2 finish
        E: xF (3cycle clockwise on UF, UL, UB)F&#x27;x&#x27; Bring edges to
        correct layers; F2 D L2 F2 L2 D R&#x27; L D2 R L UF = 1 UL = 2 UB = 3 UR
        = 4 DF = 9 DL = 10 DB = 11 DR = 12 Edges = 2 3 4 1 10 12 9 11 Cycle
        notation (not used) = (1 2 3 4)(9 10 12 11) Pemutate edges within their
        layers: R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; B2 U D&#x27; R L U B2 R2
        There, nice and easy - 4 step edge permutation. With probibly around 30
        algs to learn? ~Thom --- In

        Thom, A few problems I&#x27;ve encountered over time. If one could get
        all E edges to E layer in one move, that would be cool; I tried that for
        a long time, but finally abandoned it, because it was too hard for me to
        work out where the pieces would end up. As to swapping U and D edges, I
        found a move like: F2 D L2 F2 L2 D R&#x27; L D2 R L too difficult, for
        like reasons, and finally just settled on swapping them when they are
        opposite one another. In theory such a move should be faster though, so
        I hope someone can use it. When permuting the U/D together, I decided to
        make each layer an even perm first, if needed, just to cut down on algs.
        Learning more might be faster though, so go for it if you wish. Keep
        coming up with good ideas! Thanks, -Dave O.

        F2 D B2 L2 F2 U B2 And if you replace B2 with f2 you get this alg: (R2

        Those are good moves, thanks. My problem is that I can&#x27;t work out

      <strong>657. New (to me) 576 image system for memorizing big cubes</strong

        Hi everyone, I recently started learning a new system, one that I helped
        piece together with lots of help from John Louis, J. Bernett, and over
        at the memory sports group Boris Konrad, Ben Pridmore, and Simon Orton.
        The system uses 576 images that must be prepared in advance, and
        memorizes by applying a letter to each piece in a 24 piece orbital and
        combining two letters into an image. These images are then placed along
        a prepared journey. I will then use this system as well as a few
        journeys to memorize each cube. I like that it combines the simplicity
        of using one image per location, as well as the complexity of a really
        good system with lots of prepared images. This method is a good mix of
        both worlds for me, and I am really excited to learn it! Right now I am
        preparing my images for all the ways to combine the letters A-X without
        using the same letter twice. That is 552 images, and the remaining 24
        come from if I end with an odd cycle and just have one letter left, so
        I&#x27;ll need 24 more images for the letters A-X stand alone. I doubt
        this method is entirely new, and I&#x27;m sure it already exists. But
        I&#x27;m happy to have &quot;discovered&quot; it with lots of help from
        others. I plan on using this method in the future, and I am currently
        writing out all my images for all the letter pairs. This website is a
        tremendously helpful resource to me,
        http://www.nakedscience.com/memory/Alphabet%20Letter%20Pairs.htm I am
        using those images as a base and changing them to be ones that relate to
        me more instead of just learning that list. I hope everyone is enjoying
        learning new memorization techniques, I am very excited about learning
        this one! I haven&#x27;t thought if this method combines well for the
        3x3, I imagine it would, but my primary interests right now are the 4x4
        and 5x5, so that is why I wanted a method structured this way. Hope this
        helps for anyone interested in hearing about cool/interesting/fun ways
        to memorize a bigger cube. Chris

        Hi everyone, I just wanted to update on my progress. So far I have all
        my images for if the first letter is an A,B, or C. I also just started
        working on the D&#x27;s today. So far I have about 70 images prepared,
        and this is going surprisingly quicker than I thought it would! It
        really isn&#x27;t that hard to learn the images in one letter group.
        Anyway, in case anyone is interested in learning this approach too, it
        really isn&#x27;t as much work as I was expecting! Plus some of the
        images are really obvious, and easily correlate to the letters used to
        define them. Hope we can take memorizing to a new level for cubing,
        because I don&#x27;t think rote memory is as powerful as people claim it
        to be. But again, that is of course just my personal opinion. Chris ---

        Hey everyone, I am looking for a good commutator type (i.e.
        &quot;alg&quot;) for this situation. (mUF mUB) (mDF mDB) Where
        &quot;m&quot; stands for the centralmost slice only in the L-R parallel
        layers. I ran into this during a solve, and in order to be careful and
        not mess up I did: U2 m&#x27; U2 m U2 m&#x27; U2 m B2 m B2 m&#x27; B2 m
        B2 m&#x27; I am not allowed to do anything else to the cube at this
        point other than switch those 4 pieces. There is literally nothing
        solved but orientation and corner permutation (except for parity if it
        exists). After the solve while looking back I thought about this:
        U&#x27; R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U m2 U&#x27; R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U m2 Both algorithms
        are the same length just by a straight count, but I like the 2nd one
        better since it involves only two inner layer turns. Also is 16 turns
        STM a good count for this? Is that optimal? Does anyone have a good fast
        alg for this? So far I am sticking to the second one above, but I am
        open to learning more ways to do this. I will also think about other
        ways to tackle this problem too. Chris

        Hi everyone, I&#x27;ve come to a big realization lately, I want the
        technique I use to memorize my centers to be a stronger method rather
        than a faster method. Meaning I want to be able to remember it despite
        not rehearsing the information or thinking about it for almost the
        entire solve (I memorize these first and solve last). I have been using
        the &quot;linked lists&quot; technique for these so far which is most
        definitely slower than using a journey, but is also very strong since
        the stories are very visual. I had been debating journeys, but they
        don&#x27;t seem to be as strong of a way to memorize to me when comapred
        to linked lists. Journeys feel faster but less well memorized for me.
        But maybe that is just because I am getting used to them still? What is
        a good technique for memorizing well, and not necessarily extremely
        fast? Though I do still want this technique to be fairly quick at
        memorizing the centers. Chris

        Hey Stefan, That&#x27;s a really cool way to do that, I hadn&#x27;t
        thought of that! Looking at your way led me to this, it&#x27;s not as
        easy to execute, but I would prefer the shorter move to be honest. F
        B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B m2 F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B m2 If you saw this from
        the other angle it could be just your alg minus the setup (U D&#x27; R2
        D U&#x27;) m2 (U D&#x27; R2 D U&#x27;) m2 which is how I thought of it.
        This is cool. I kind of wonder if this is possible in fewer moves though
        lol. This is fun. I&#x27;m also looking at this, but it doesn&#x27;t
        preserve the centers :-S m U2 m2 U2 m Maybe there is a way to use this
        as a base for a slightly longer alg, but keep those 3x1 blocks on F and
        B from flipping somehow? Just an idea, I don&#x27;t know of a way but
        I&#x27;ll keep looking. Chris --- In

        Dear Chris, I don&#x27;tknow what I am giving you is very elementary to
        you. But in my opinion this phase&quot;HOW TO MEMORISE&quot; is more
        important than the various systems. Substitute means not subtituting the
        whole picture. Instead, for example you have 2 fishes instead of 2 eyes.
        You have 2 moving wheels in the place of your ears etc. What I am trying
        to tell you is think of the first objest and substitute one of its parts
        with the second object and exagerate it. John Louis cmhardw

        If you want to memorise anything associate the first one with the second
        one ridiculously and visualize the picture as real in your minds eye
        atleast for few seconds. Slowly with practice the few seconds will
        become fraction of seconds, > > How to make the association ridiculous ?

        As some of you may know, I have been working an automated online
        competition system, which should make running online competitions a lot
        easier. So far, I have tested the system on a fewest moves style
        competition, and would now like to test it on a blindfold style
        competition. Here is the url: http://www.ryanheise.com/competitions/bcc/
        Please logging in and submitting your times, as this will also help me
        test if there are any bugs. This week can be considered an experimental
        run, and if it works, I can give the administrator role over to whoever
        is interested. Ryan

        Dear Chris, Instead of story method you can use Link system. Both may
        appear same to you. But they are different. Link method uses your
        natural/original memory . You may not realise you are using locations at
        different places unlike in a journey in sequence. This type of
        memorisation is much faster. For example, you have to memorise the
        pieces in the following order and you are using substitution to make it
        ridiculous. 1). Button 2). Crocdile 3). Knife 4). Table tennis bat 5).
        Barbecue Here, I am not creating story. Instead I am just linking using
        substitution. 1).Through the hole in the Button a Crocodile crawls.
        Visualize it in your minds eye. 2).Its every teeth is a big
        knife.Visualize it in your minds eye. 3).Its handle is like a tt bat.
        Visualize it in your minds eye. 4).Instead of hitting a ball, you are
        hitting a Barbecue. Visualize it in your minds eye. This way you can
        memorise much faster, I think. If you visualize properly, revision is
        not required. Have fun, John Louis JohnLouis Louis &lt;pjlmem@...>

        elementary to you. But in my opinion this phase&quot;HOW TO
        MEMORISE&quot; is more important than the various systems. Substitute
        means not subtituting the whole picture. Instead, for example you have 2
        fishes instead of 2 eyes. You have 2 moving wheels in the place of your
        ears etc. What I am trying to tell you is think of the first objest and
        substitute one of its parts with the second object and exagerate it.

        what you mean? I have noticed that I am getting more comfortable using
        journeys and applying images to a location. I have also noticed that
        using journeys have made me much better at visualizing my stories for my
        linked lists. They are getting less abstract and the stories are getting
        more detailed. It seems that these journeys are a real mental workout,
        and help for mental ability to visualize! Or at least for me they seem
        to make these things easier. Chris --- In

        [blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube] 5x5x5 commutator type for central edges
        Hey everyone, I am looking for a good commutator type (i.e.
        &quot;alg&quot;) for this situation. (mUF mUB) (mDF mDB) Where
        &quot;m&quot; stands for the centralmost slice only in the L-R parallel
        layers. I ran into this during a solve, and in order to be careful and
        not mess up I did: U2 m&#x27; U2 m U2 m&#x27; U2 m B2 m B2 m&#x27; B2 m
        B2 m&#x27; I am not allowed to do anything else to the cube at this
        point other than switch those 4 pieces. There is literally nothing
        solved but orientation and corner permutation (except for parity if it
        exists). After the solve while looking back I thought about this:
        U&#x27; R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U m2 U&#x27; R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U m2 Both algorithms
        are the same length just by a straight count, but I like the 2nd one
        better since it involves only two inner layer turns. Also is 16 turns
        STM a good count for this? Is that optimal? Does anyone have a good fast
        alg for this? So far I am sticking to the second one above, but I am
        open to learning more ways to do this. I will also think about other
        ways to tackle this problem too. Chris SPONSORED LINKS Jigsaw

        Hey Dennis, I couldn&#x27;t use m2 U2 m2 U2 because it doesn&#x27;t
        preserve the centers. m2 U2 m2 U2 does swap the edges I need, but it
        would also perform the following cycles to the centers: (mbU mfU) (mfD
        mbD) which would potentially mess up my center cycles unless I used a
        move to correct those 4 centers. So far I can&#x27;t think of anything
        shorter than Stefan&#x27;s alg to swap just those 4 pieces, and not
        affect centers at all. Chris --- In

        Hey everyone, I just wanted to give an update on my progress so far.
        I&#x27;m coming up with images for all the possible ways to pair two
        letters A through X without repeating letters (no AA, BB, CC, DD, EE,
        etc.). So far I have images for everything AB-EX which is 115 images. I
        also have certain pairs later on planned, like OT will be Oliver Twist,
        stuff like that. So I probably know maybe 125 or so right now. Right now
        I have pretty fast recall on my images for AB-DX and I am working on
        studying my E&#x27;s to make sure I&#x27;m solid on those before moving
        on to the F&#x27;s. I just tested using my old images (only 24, or one
        per piece) for memorizing the edges but I used two images at each
        journey location instead of just one. The memorization went a bit faster
        than normal, so I think using this new large bank of images will make
        things much easier for memorizing the edge orbitals. I&#x27;m also
        thinking of a way to use the &quot;Roman Room&quot; technique to use the
        same images for my centers. Also John Louis I really like your method of
        zooming in. Stuff like Having an &quot;Alligator&quot; but then all the
        teeth of the Alligators are &quot;Knives&quot; and the handles of those
        knives are wrapped in &quot;cotton&quot; and inside the cotton is a herd
        of microscopic &quot;Giraffes&quot; or something weird like that. I
        really want to try this idea out some too. Anyway I&#x27;m about 125
        images into my 576 or about 22% finished. Can&#x27;t wait until I&#x27;m
        done! I&#x27;ll try to keep udating about my progress. Chris

        blindfolded as well? Those are my focus, and I very much prefer to be
        able to do these instead of the 3x3. Thanks, Chris --- In

        Patrick (PJK) Hi Patrick. Thanks for the link, I was not aware of the
        competitions in your forum. Sure, I&#x27;d be happy to set up whatever
        competitions you need, and give you admin access for those competitions.
        Just send me an email describing the name and format of each
        competition. For example, for the blindfolded 4x4x4 competition:
        competition id: bcc competition name: Blindfolded Cubing Contest - 4x4x4
        format: best of 3, times can include DNF and DNS. (Although this one has
        already been set up) Thanks, Ryan

        Hey all, I think that would be a great idea to integrate this into the
        forums somehow. I just want to add though that Ryan designed and built
        this competition solely on his own, and then later asked me to help with
        running it. So I&#x27;m not in any way a creator of this, Ryan gets all
        that credit :-) As for scripts to integrate it into the forum I am
        totally helpless there, no idea how to do that. But I would love the
        idea of helping run this on the forum. Also we should give Craig the
        option too, I mean he did revive BLD competitions online after I stopped
        running mine, so he would probably be very interested in this too. Chris

        board systems usually provide an API for adding custom extensions,
        although rewriting my server to fit with another system would probably
        be too much effort. I would also want to avoid integrating them in such
        a way that they are co-located and are dependent on each other, because
        I would like to also run some non-rubik&#x27;s related competitions,
        such as music and memory-based ones. The easiest option would probably
        be to provide hyperlinks in both directions. i.e. a hyperlink from the
        discussion board to the competition page, and a hyperlink from the
        competition page back to the discussion forum(s). Ryan

        Bloody hell craig. I didn&#x27;t even have a go at you that time. I just
        said I liked it a lot since yours has stopped. What the fuck is wrong

        http://groups.yahoo.com/group/memorysports/message/591 I am currently
        using linked lists for the centers, but I am thinking about switching
        over to using my journey images for the edges, and just have certain
        journeys only ever used for centers and certain journeys only ever used
        for edges. Once I finish all the letter pair images though I plan on
        using the Roman Room technique for centers and the journey method for
        edges. Actually, now that I think about it I might as well start coming
        up with some rooms for the Roman room technique and get used to them.
        Stefan I know you are using journeys, do you use them for centers and
        edges for the 4x4 or 5x5? J. Bernett do you use journeys for all the
        pieces of a larger cube? Or do you use linked lists or the Roman room
        technique or anything else? Chris

        Dear chris hardwick, Bernett is away on vacation. He asked me to reply
        on his behalf when I informed him over phone. He uses journey method
        only. You may be surprised to know his method. He memorises 3 cycle in
        alternate locations of a journey for memorising centers. This alternate
        location method holds good for solving one center piece at a time. John

        Hey guys, While we&#x27;re in the mood to think about moves, how about
        the U layer Z permutation of + centers? I recently have started using
        this alg: m s d s&#x27; d2 m&#x27; U2 m d2 s d&#x27; s&#x27; m&#x27; U2
        Again the lower case m and s means just the single center layer, same as
        we&#x27;ve been doing already. I even used this alg successfully on a
        blindfolded solve once too. However I don&#x27;t like that it has so
        many single slice turns. Those are a possible point to accidently pull
        two faces instead of just one. Also if you are more careful to just turn
        the single layers, the d turns are a possible pop risk for ripping out
        that wing edge if you use too much force (my cube is somewhat loose and
        I&#x27;ve done this before). So far this is the shortest alg I can think
        of, but is there a way to do this same permutation without all the
        single slice turns? I&#x27;ll think about it too, but I thought it could
        be fun if we all put our minds to it. I enjoy the way we throw around
        ideas to each other. Chris

        Hey Chris/Stefan! If i get this right the following alg will do the same
        ... and yes it&#x27;s a commutator :-P &lt;r&#x27; l&#x27; e2 r l , U>
        The P part simply swaps 2 +-centers. &lt;r&#x27; l&#x27; u2 r l , U>
        does the Z-perm for x-centers. These 2 algs are easy as hell ;-) No
        wait, these are X-perms ... hahaha .. silly me ;-) Ok, a real Z-perm for
        +-centers will go like this : &lt;r&#x27; (Uu)&#x27; l&#x27; e2 l (Uu) r

        Hi everyone, I know the response to learning a memorization method has
        been different for different people. I also know that the people at the
        top for blindfolded solving don&#x27;t seem to want to learn a really
        advanced memorization method. Well I finally finished learning the 278
        images that make up half of what I will need to memorize a 4x4x4 or
        5x5x5 cube blindfolded. I can now use the alphabet letter pairs for
        AB-LK (132 images) for the 3x3x3 permutations, which is a subset of
        these 278. So I&#x27;m going to start using these images to memorize the
        3x3 rather than natural memory. My natural memory is not as fast as
        most, but I think with a trained technique that I can vastly improve my
        own memorization times. If I can improve my memorization noticably this
        way, will you top blindfolded solvers who just use rote/natural memory
        at least consider, that maybe learning a technique is better? I&#x27;ve
        been saying that for months now, but hopefully now that I have the
        necessary method learned for 3x3 I will be able to back up what I have
        been saying. My aim is to use this for the bigger cubes, that&#x27;s why
        I started in the first place. But I want to start using it for the 3x3x3
        too. Hopefully it works. I&#x27;m trying as hard as I can to convert you
        rote/natural memory people ;-) Chris

        Hey everyone, Ok so I&#x27;ve tried about 3-4 solves so far using my
        images instead of just rote memory. So far I&#x27;m still excited about
        practicing this way of memorizing, but man this is hard. My first
        successful solve was 10 minutes including memorization, and I got one
        down to 6 minutes. The problem I am getting is that it is hard to do
        process of elimination. Say I get to one journey location but I&#x27;m
        not sure what image I put there. If I&#x27;ve already solved 2 pieces
        then I know there are 3 letters that can&#x27;t be part of this image.
        Out of 12 letters then 9 remain, so I have to test 72 images to do
        process of elimination, which takes a long time, that happened on my 10
        minute solve. I think once I am so familiar with my images that I
        immediately recall the image when thinking of the letters and vice versa
        that that problem will go away, but for now I am almost 3 times slower
        than my normal way. Still, I&#x27;m going to keep solving this way and
        try to work back up to my old times. I hope this method works, I have a
        lot of faith in it. I&#x27;ll try to update on my progress the more I

        Hey Pedro, I don&#x27;t take any offense at all, most everyone I&#x27;ve
        talked to has given me almost the exact same response. I just know that
        the world class memorizers don&#x27;t memorize anything without a
        system. Give them a string of even just 10 binary digits and they
        don&#x27;t use rote memory, they have HUGE databases of images and they
        apply an image to a very large group of digits. If you take something as
        simple as 10 digit binary, and not a single memory master uses rote
        memory to do it (the only ones who just memorize it by rote, they would
        consider a beginner/intermediate for binary numbers). If 10 digit binary
        is easier than memorizing a 3x3x3 cube, why don&#x27;t they use rote
        memory? Because rote is slower than a system. You say that memorizing a
        3x3x3 is so easy. Well memorizing 10 binary digits is 10 times easier I
        would say. But they don&#x27;t use rote memory even for that. I&#x27;m a
        beginner memorizer by their standards, I mean really seriously a
        beginner. I say that because they practice memory stuff just as much as
        we practice cubing. I&#x27;m sure John Louis and J. Bernett can back me
        up on this. So much work goes into training your mind to be able to do
        this so quickly. And yet if I got down to 1:56.xx for the 3x3x3 BLD then
        what does that say about BLD times? Now I&#x27;m trying to be a bit
        provocative here. If I can get sub-2, and yet by memory master standards
        I am a beginner. What does that say about our memorization? I know that
        most of you think memorizing a cube in under 20 seconds is total
        fantasy. I mean the top people can&#x27;t do it, and they&#x27;ve been
        doing this for some time. Clearly sub-20 memorization is a lie then
        right? Well for rote memory I absolutely agree, wholeheartedly. But what
        if you used a system? Is it possible? I don&#x27;t know, but I sure
        think so. That&#x27;s what I am trying to find out. Let&#x27;s just say
        I find it interesting that for BLD cubing, everyone is already content
        to just leave things as they are. Yet for speedsolving, people are
        always looking for new methods, new ways to do things. Take Roux
        solving, COLL, multislotting as examples. Memorization is such a huge
        part of BLD solving. Yet for BLD we are content to not change anything
        about our memorization techniques. Everything is fine and perfect
        exactly the way it is. The 3x3x3 is &quot;so easy&quot; in your words.
        Have we already discovered the best method out there, and no matter how
        hard we look there is nothing better? Hmmmmmm... Chris --- In

        Can you define what you mean with &quot;rote memory&quot;? Cause
        I&#x27;m quite sure they&#x27;d use it (what *I* think it is) for this
        since it&#x27;s not even a third of short term memory. So no need to
        apply any journey or roman room method or something like that. Cheers!

        It seems to me that 500 images seems to be the average. Maybe 600-800
        for the more advanced people. They would use those same images under a
        different index. So both the Jack of Diamonds in the deck and say 110101

        True I think they would use some rote memory (they call it &quot;natural

        I think you&#x27;d better differentiate between reading and memorizing.
        What you call a memorization system I call at best a reading system.
        Imagine a child who can&#x27;t read yet sees this: bicycle elephant
        lollipop For the child that&#x27;s just 20+ symbols. Or even worse, an
        even much larger number of lines. But for you, it&#x27;s just three
        words which fit perfectly into your natural short term memory. Maybe the
        child has started to learn reading and can slowly, one by one, identify
        the letters and finally understand the words, too. But is this a memory
        technique? I dare to say no. Similarly, the memory masters just *read* a
        6-bit number while you&#x27;re the child who can&#x27;t read it yet
        cause you haven&#x27;t learned this yet (by rote/practice). Cheers!

        Yeah, that&#x27;s about what I thought. I think 100 images for digits
        and 64 for bits is somewhat the standard. That is, one image covers 2
        digits or 6 bits. So I was wondering whether you call 2 or 6 a
        &quot;very large group of digits&quot;. Even with 1000 images each of
        them covers only 3 digits or 9 bits. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Hi all blindfold solvers, Yes, indeed, I use a system even to memorise
        10 binary digits. I remember I mentioned here in this forum a year back
        that 3*3*3 can be memorised in just 20 secs, if you use a system and
        moreover the retention will also be longer. In my opinion David Orser is
        already using a memory system even much before we start discussing 3*3*3
        bld memorisation in this forum. That is why his memorisation time is
        faster than others. Hope he will answer us. As I am already 46 years
        old, rote memory is impossible for me. I have to follow some memory
        system. I can not run as fast as you guys in your 20&#x27;s. Similarly,
        I can not memorise as fast as you guys. I think for bigger cubes a
        memory system is must for higher success rate. John Louis cmhardw
        &lt;foozman17@...> wrote: Hey Pedro, I don&#x27;t take any offense at
        all, most everyone I&#x27;ve talked to has given me almost the exact
        same response. I just know that the world class memorizers don&#x27;t
        memorize anything without a system. Give them a string of even just 10
        binary digits and they don&#x27;t use rote memory, they have HUGE
        databases of images and they apply an image to a very large group of
        digits. If you take something as simple as 10 digit binary, and not a
        single memory master uses rote memory to do it (the only ones who just
        memorize it by rote, they would consider a beginner/intermediate for
        binary numbers). If 10 digit binary is easier than memorizing a 3x3x3
        cube, why don&#x27;t they use rote memory? Because rote is slower than a
        system. You say that memorizing a 3x3x3 is so easy. Well memorizing 10
        binary digits is 10 times easier I would say. But they don&#x27;t use
        rote memory even for that. I&#x27;m a beginner memorizer by their
        standards, I mean really seriously a beginner. I say that because they
        practice memory stuff just as much as we practice cubing. I&#x27;m sure
        John Louis and J. Bernett can back me up on this. So much work goes into
        training your mind to be able to do this so quickly. And yet if I got
        down to 1:56.xx for the 3x3x3 BLD then what does that say about BLD
        times? Now I&#x27;m trying to be a bit provocative here. If I can get
        sub-2, and yet by memory master standards I am a beginner. What does
        that say about our memorization? I know that most of you think
        memorizing a cube in under 20 seconds is total fantasy. I mean the top
        people can&#x27;t do it, and they&#x27;ve been doing this for some time.
        Clearly sub-20 memorization is a lie then right? Well for rote memory I
        absolutely agree, wholeheartedly. But what if you used a system? Is it
        possible? I don&#x27;t know, but I sure think so. That&#x27;s what I am
        trying to find out. Let&#x27;s just say I find it interesting that for
        BLD cubing, everyone is already content to just leave things as they
        are. Yet for speedsolving, people are always looking for new methods,
        new ways to do things. Take Roux solving, COLL, multislotting as
        examples. Memorization is such a huge part of BLD solving. Yet for BLD
        we are content to not change anything about our memorization techniques.
        Everything is fine and perfect exactly the way it is. The 3x3x3 is
        &quot;so easy&quot; in your words. Have we already discovered the best
        method out there, and no matter how hard we look there is nothing
        better? Hmmmmmm... Chris --- In

        Hi John, Chris, whoever is interested, I like using the journey and
        phonetic/major systems; they&#x27;re fun. In messages 952,1004, and 1014
        I tried to describe how I use them for the cube. My memorization times
        aren&#x27;t that good, but I think many others could average in the
        15-20 sec range using such a mnemonic system. I&#x27;m really curious
        how others memorize the orientations, ie details of what you look at
        first, do you plan the moves out, etc. It would be cool if the fast guys
        would share; we need more posts. Chris, I&#x27;m always looking for new
        ideas and help, your posts are great, keep going. Cool that you have
        generated all those images too. I have standard images that I use, but
        for the cube, I decided to be flexible. Ex. 85 12 is usually
        &#x27;foil-Dan&#x27;, but I usually end up using &quot;fall down&quot;
        and picture someone falling down. I found that some of my words
        didn&#x27;t make good combos, so I just gave in and started making them
        up on the fly, more or less. Still, I&#x27;m not sure if this is good,
        or faster, oh well. -Dave O. --- In

        Hi Dave, Great to hear from you! Hope things are going well, both with
        your cubing and everything else. I just read your post, and I too have
        done something similar about changing the images sometimes. With my old
        linked lists method one of my locations was Germany, but sometimes I
        would make that location a hospital (the implication being, you needed
        to be flown into Germany to see a specialist for some reason), and other
        weird things like that. I&#x27;m trying to take my new images a bit more
        concretely, I&#x27;m trying my best not to change them, so that I can
        remember which one is which. I don&#x27;t want a secondary image for
        some of them, when I already have a bunch to remember and decode
        already. I may end up changing this the more I work with it though, this
        whole system is totally new to me. As for the image you suggested, what
        do you picture for &quot;fall down&quot;? I used to use verbs as well,
        and found them harder to work with than nouns, which is one reason I
        stopped using my linked lists approach (I had a lot of verbs). I&#x27;m
        trying as hard as I can to not include any verbs as one of my images,
        and just have them be objects or people (such as comic book characters,
        or movie stars). For me 85 12 (I may use a different layout for my
        numbers than you do though) would be Kiln-Jeebs and I would probably
        picture a pottery kiln falling over on the guys Jeebs (the second hand
        pawn shop owner from the movie Men in Black) and his head doing that
        weird exploding thing it did in the movie. I would have the slime from
        his head explosion hit whatever the object formed by the next two pieces
        is. So if it was 85 12 34 that would be Kiln-Jeebs-Fiddle and the slime
        from Jeebs head would hit a guy playing the fiddle. Not the most PC
        image of course, but it would be memorable heh heh. I&#x27;m not sure if
        using 3 images per location will work well for the 3x3x3, I image it
        would with more practice, but again my focus is the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5,
        where using 3 images per location would be hugely helpful. I&#x27;ll
        probably use it for the 3x3x3 too, even if it isn&#x27;t the best
        approach for that cube, just for the experience of combining my images
        that way for practice for the bigger cubes. That&#x27;s good to hear
        that you use memory systems, your memorization times have always really
        impressed me, and I am hoping that now that I am also using a system
        that maybe I can speed up from my, relatively, very slow times. Chris >

        in certain cases with the cube. For fall down, I just picture myself,
        falling down in the location, whatever it is. If fall is the second
        pair, sometimes I picture the first pair falling from the sky. But
        mostly I use two nouns interacting. I use some people too, but now and
        then I get them confused because I don&#x27;t picture them well enough.
        But often they work really well. Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t gotten
        into the big cubes, the 3x is enough for me, but I always like to hear
        new ideas about memorizing or solving blind. I&#x27;m too slow
        memorizing the edge and corner orientations. I memorize the corner
        o&#x27;s last and solve them first, but they still give me trouble lots
        of times. And I&#x27;d still like to hear more about how others memorize
        the o&#x27;s. With the edge o&#x27;s, I sometimes backtrack, and take
        too much time. Keep posting, -Dave O.

        Chris: Memorizing 10 binary digits, while still easy, is still &quot;not
        easy to do in a rote manner&quot; in a small timeframe, which is why a
        system is still ultimately more efficient. But of course we would
        probably not memorize big image systems for the sole purpose of
        memorizing 10 binary digits. As you are well aware, the system takes
        time to integrate into your &quot;reflex memory&quot; but of course once
        it&#x27;s integrated, your memorization times will start dropping like
        crazy. Although I really do recommend using a different system for the
        3x3 than for the 5x5, since, for instance, if you were doing them in a
        relay, it may be difficult. You want to minimize potential memory
        overlap as much as you can, and the huge image system is a bit much for
        the 3x3 and is probably best suited for the larger cubes. It&#x27;s like
        using a battering ram to smash apart a small statue when really, all you
        need is a hammer. Rote memory is fast because it involves no memory
        transitions, but it&#x27;s weak, however not too far off from using
        basic memory systems devoid of that weakness. Have you tried a solve
        using the Major system for the corners? Or the binary-conversion method
        for EO? Or journey-method stories for EP? Such things are quick and
        don&#x27;t require hundreds of images and will allow you to memorize the
        cube anywhere from 15-30 seconds with enough practice (the practice
        needed for this system is much smaller and so faster results come more
        quickly as well). And so this leaves room for the image system for the
        5x5 cube. Using a smaller system for the 3x3 will put it on a different
        subconscious level than the 5x5 so you have little overlap. Just my two
        cents.

        Dave: http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/6343/corners8sh.png This is how
        I approach CO. There&#x27;s an obvious downside if you don&#x27;t see
        these cases on the cube, which is my only real gripe with it. I am still
        not sure how to optimize CO but this is what I use which seems to work
        the majority of the time and allows you to memorize it all quickly. Let
        me know if you have any questions. As for EO, you can use the binary
        conversion method although over time it should become second nature
        (converting four edges per layer into one letter of the alpabet by
        associating the edges with 1, 2, 4, and 8 and using their sum as
        conversion by adding the values of the edges you wish to flip). For
        instance, I might always associate seeing edges 1 and 3 flipped with the
        letter E (since edge 1 = 1, edge 3 = 4, 1 + 4 = 5, 5 = E), and so with
        practice you can quickly look at each layer and just extract three
        letters and make up a quick phrase using those letters. I have found
        this approach to be really fast and I have a hard time thinking of an
        easier way to do EO.

        memorize binary digits, then yes I agree you wouldn&#x27;t want to learn
        a huge system, but those who actually do use a huge system for binary
        digits tend to do very well. I got my numbers wrong from before, in Ben
        Pridmore&#x27;s video on these pages
        http://memoryconsulting.com/videos.htm (scroll to the bottom) he
        mentions that he uses over 2000 images for speed cards, and 1000 of
        those 2000 images for binary alone. I imagine a smaller subset of those
        1000 is used for 10 digit binary, as opposed to, say, his 4000 digit
        binary attempt, but still it seems he would be able to use quite a lot.
        I also agree with Stefan that a memory expert who has practiced binary a
        lot can just read a 6 digit number and it have meaning, whereas most of
        us who don&#x27;t practice see 6 separate digits in binary, and not one
        unit. So I think that also plays a huge role. > Although I really > do

        is a hammer. I use the same images for everything, but I use different
        journey locations to tell me which part of the cube is what. So on the
        5x5x5 I&#x27;m working on using images for the central edges and corners
        too, but just in a different journey location. I&#x27;ve already
        practiced this on the 3x3x3, and I&#x27;m REALLY slow at it, but again
        I&#x27;ve only done maybe 5 solves with the new system so far, I think
        in time this will improve a lot. I&#x27;m no 3x3x3 expert, so I just
        want it to improve well enough for me to comfortably use this approach
        on a 5x5x5 solve for the 3x3x3-like pieces. There is no real overlap,
        since if I do get that small chance that I see the same image, it&#x27;s
        in a different place so it doesn&#x27;t really mess me up very much.
        I&#x27;ve already had this happen to me twice in my solving so far, and
        the repeat image is not a hinderance really, since I&#x27;ve put it in
        some other journey. > > Rote memory is fast because it involves no

        results come more quickly as well). I&#x27;m a bit confused, the system
        I am using basically is the Major system. However, instead of coming up
        with the words on the fly, I already have every possible combination of
        letters with a prepared image. So if I see (QKECH)(FBGA)(IL) (the
        scramble on my 3x3 edges right now) I would put that in my journey as: 1
        st cycle) Queen-Ketchup-Chest of Drawers (A Queen poors ketchup all over
        a chest of drawers I used to own 2nd cycle) Chris Farley - Bag(of money)
        - Dan Aykroyd (Chris Farley pushes a bankrobber with a huge bag of money
        over and the money spills everywhere. Dan Aykroyd is swimming in the
        money.) 3rd cycle) Island (I picture a small island with a palm tree) So
        I mean I don&#x27;t make a sentence, I tell a story with images more,
        but the translation time is less I would imagine. I can see how
        gramatically 1 sentence could contain the information of your entire
        cube, so in that respect the images are weaker. I need a maximum of 10
        journey locations to be able to contain the entire cube, which is
        probably more work than one sentence. I&#x27;m hoping that having less
        translation time will help, but again I don&#x27;t know which is faster
        for the 3x3x3. The 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 are really my main reason for doing
        this though, so in a sense it doesn&#x27;t matter to me as much which is
        faster for 3x3x3. I want the best system for the bigger cubes, and
        I&#x27;ll use anything useful from that for the 3x3x3 so I don&#x27;t
        have to do any more work than I have to. > > And so this leaves room for

        little overlap. Just my two cents. > I may try that one day, but for now
        I haven&#x27;t had any problems with using the same images for 5x5 or
        3x3. Also, because there are a large number of images I have a somewhat
        small chance of seeing the same image twice on the same attempt (relay,
        or whatever). Also, even if I do get the same image, it&#x27;s not
        confusing it kind of helps, since you&#x27;ve already combined
        everything like that once somewhere else, so just recall the image again
        and put it in the new journey spot. --------- Marcus I know you already
        get fantastic times for the cubes blindfolded, but I would recommend
        trying out something like this. Just watch those videos of Ben Pridmore
        using a system very, very similar to the one I am trying to learn and
        see how fast he memorizes a deck of cards. It&#x27;s very awesome to
        watch, I certainly couldn&#x27;t memorize a 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 with that
        kind of speed with any of my old systems, so I figured I would just copy
        Ben straight up on his and give that a shot instead :-D Chris

        That was awesome! I want to go over it a few times again to really see
        how you came up with that, but I just have to say wow! I like how you
        switch those two 3x1 edge groups in the middle. Did this come from your
        M method for 3x3? The moves seem similar from replacing two edges in the
        M method you came up with. Holy crap that alg is cool! Chris

        That&#x27;s such an awesome way to do two 2 swaps like that. Stefan does
        this approach work for any other good cases for doing 2 swaps? I see how
        you do the slice turn b2. Then you need to swap either UR to DL or vice
        versa. Also you have to take another edge from either UB, BR, BL, DB,
        UF, FR, FL, FD and put it into the spot where you just moved a piece out
        of either DL or UR. Basically it looks to me that you did a slice move
        to change two edges (the other two are a side effect). Call those edges
        A and B. Then you cycle A to B&#x27;s spot, B to some place in holding
        somewhere, and some other edge not affected by the first slice turn to
        A&#x27;s old spot. Then you undo the slice move, then you undo the sort
        of pseudo three cycle of those edge groups? Holy crap that&#x27;s cool!
        Sorry, I just can&#x27;t get over that! I&#x27;m going to have to mess
        around with this some more! Chris P.S. Here are the three algs I tried
        to figure yours out. As a test I looked at [b2,UF2U&#x27;] which
        isn&#x27;t a 2 swap, but is a cool way to do that type of edge 3 cycle.
        Then I tried: [b2,UDF2U&#x27;D&#x27;] which is a nice identity but not
        useful :-) Then I did: [b2, D F D&#x27;] which is a 3 cycle commutator
        type I currently use. That&#x27;s when I saw what you did with switching
        DL to UR (or it could go the other way too if you want) with the move
        L&#x27; U F&#x27; U&#x27; L P.P.S. very cool alg!

        Chris, Wow that video is awesome. You can totally see how such a system
        would work... when he starts slapping down two cards at a time over and
        over again you just start constructing stories to go along with the
        associated images... pretty powerful indeed, lol. And yes I agree with
        you and Stefan: After practicing something over and over again the steps
        become natural, where you can just look at something and instantly
        figure out its association. Math might be one such example -- I&#x27;m
        sure you can spit out 6x8 without too much thought at all :D Ahh so your
        journey locations differ -- that is interesting and really effective.
        And yes, it will be slow at first, but as you&#x27;ve implied
        (correctly) it will speed up once you become most accustomed to the
        method itself through practice. I mean, Ben Pridmore&#x27;s system must
        have taken quite a long time. It&#x27;s amazing how quickly you&#x27;re
        able to do well with your own memory system! The only downside with the
        story method for edges you described -- please tell me if I am mistaken
        but I am going from a past post of yours -- is that I wonder how much
        time is taken actually recalling the story before actions are taken. I
        remember you trying &quot;visual memory&quot; as opposed to speaking in
        a sort of inner monologue and saving some time. Do you find that a lot
        of the time is spent thinking of the story&#x27;s layout or is it not
        really an issue? Well, by all this I mainly speak of the 3x3. I do use
        letters for the 5x5 because there are simply too many pieces to string
        together with images alone, but the 3x3 is just on the brink. By
        &quot;on the brink&quot; I mean probably feasible with a more short-term
        system, ie. it is easy for us to short-term-memorize &quot;101001&quot;
        but probably past that brink to memorize
        &quot;111000101010110101010010010110&quot; without a system. Good point
        on the bigger cubes though... your approach seems like it would be the
        strongest for memorizing such cubes. It would also work wonders for
        relays if you are into those. I am a little jealous, haha -- but
        memorizing a huge system like that is daunting! And yeah I know what you
        mean about Ben... memory systems in action :D I&#x27;m anxious to see
        how fast you can get with this system!

        location, and to use two pieces in the cycle per image. I mean I guess a

        one walking my journey, so I can use that person in a later image if I
        am having trouble with just the two objects alone. I don&#x27;t imagine
        any travel time between locations, just a sort of instant jump (some
        locations can, in physical space, be separated by several hundred feet).

        this I mainly speak of the 3x3. That&#x27;s a really good question, and
        one I hadn&#x27;t thought about much until just now. With these images
        and these journeys it takes me a good bit longer to memorize (about
        twice as long as with my old approach), but I recall on average probably
        twice as fast, if not quicker. Actually now that I think about it, every
        time I&#x27;ve done a 4x4x4 solve with these images I memorize in about
        10-12 minutes, and my overall solving lately ahs been 15-22. With my old
        stuff I memorized in about 6-8 minutes and had the same overall range
        about (around 15 minutes or so). So sometimes now I solve in 10 minutes
        (I don&#x27;t like a solve that slow), but I have definitely gotten a
        solve in 5-6 minutes a couple times too (using the new images). For the
        5x5x5 I lately have been memorizing in about 22-24 on average, and
        solving at 35-40 minutes total (so 11-18 min range I would guess). 11 is
        very, very good for me on 5x5x5, and 18 is ok but not great. I think
        once I am more comfortable with memorizing quickly, then I can take
        advantage of that and the quicker recall. For the 3x3x3 using these new
        images I definitely memorize very slowly and also recall very slowly
        this way. I could memorize and recall much quicker just by using rote
        memory for the 3x3x3, but I am hoping that is because I&#x27;m not yet
        comfortable with using my images quickly. Also, even when comparing my
        rote memory to you, Leyan, Tyson, etc. I seem to have a slower memory in
        general (or I don&#x27;t trust myself to go too fast or something).
        I&#x27;ve wondered that maybe I prefer quantity of information over
        speed, because maybe my memory is just not that fast compared to you
        really fast guys. Then again there is a limit there too, because the
        relay still scares me. > I do use letters for the 5x5 > because there

        The more I work with these images, the more I think that maybe a large
        system isn&#x27;t the best idea for the 3x3x3. But then again, I know
        that memory experts use a lot of images with 10 digit binary, but still
        fewer than, say, 100 digit binary. So maybe 132 images for the 3x3x3 is
        too many, but maybe images would still work well? Again I won&#x27;t
        even begin to call myself a 3x3x3 BLD expert, I seem to do better at the
        larger cubes, again probably because maybe I have a preference for more
        stuff to memorize, rather than trying to memorize very quickly? I
        don&#x27;t really know to be honest. > > Good point on the bigger cubes

        about how much this system is an improvement for memorizing the bigger
        cubes (compared to my old stuff at least). I still don&#x27;t know if
        this is the best approach for the 3x3x3, I&#x27;ll keep at it and see,
        but maybe you guys really are right. Maybe rote memory really can be
        super powerful for the 3x3x3. Or maybe, even better, there is a way to
        combine say 50 images with rote memory and do like the 10 digit binary.
        About 6 digits are images, and the other 4 are super short term memory,
        reading them as Stefan put it. Maybe the corners for the 3x3x3 could be
        done with images (56 needed to cover all cases of placing two pieces
        into one image). Then the edge permutation could be pure rote memory.
        Perhaps an approach like that would fit the 3x3x3 better? Just throwing
        out ideas, what do you think? Chris

        B2 R2 B&#x27; D2 U L2 R&#x27; F2 D U2 F2 U L2 R&#x27; B&#x27; F&#x27; L
        R2 I scrambled with the cube already in the same orientation that I
        solve it. I need 10 journey locations max (usually less, but just in
        case the maximum I need is 10) in order to memorize this cube. So here
        is my journey first off: 1) The entrance to my old neighborhood where I
        grew up. It&#x27;s at the top of a very long steep hill. 2) The bottom
        of that hill 3) The first stop sign in my neighborhood 4) The first
        speed bump (by a big tree) 5) The second speed bump (by a row of parking
        spaces) 6) The main office (where you pay your rent) 7) The pool (near
        the main office) 8) At my friend&#x27;s house past the pool 9) At a
        dumpster beside the road 10) At the speedbump to the entrance to my
        cul-de-sac So those are the places where my images will go. Now
        let&#x27;s look at the scramble. I start with edges, and I always start
        at UB. UB is the letter Q for me, so I imagine a Queen with a crown and
        a long robe is the person walking my journey. Here is the first cycle:
        UB->DL->FL->UB In letters that is Q->G->C->Q So at the entrance to my
        neighborhood I imagine a Queen getting into the Best Buy Geek Squad car
        and driving towards the next location (GC=Geek Car). Now I look at UL
        (where I usually look next if the UB cycle ends early). This cycle is
        UL->UF->UR->UL. In letters that&#x27;s E->I->F. So at the bottom of the
        hill I picture Carmen Electra standing to the left of the &quot;IF&quot;
        image. This one is hard to point into words. It&#x27;s the demon coming
        out of the jack in the box from the Sci-Fi channel bumper before the
        show (they always end with the IF tagline, sort of like &quot;what
        if?&quot;). So she&#x27;s standing to the left of the Demon coming out
        of the jack in the box and getting scared. Ok so that cycle ended early
        too. Next I&#x27;ll start at BL. This cycle is BL->DB->BL. So at the
        first stop sign in my neighborhood I imagine Dan Aykroyd standing to the
        left of Lindsay Lohan. Dan is flirting with Lindsay, and she&#x27;s
        ignoring him. Ok so that cycle ended early too. Next I look at FR. This
        cycle is FR->DF->FR. So at the first speedbump in my neighborhood I
        picture Johnny Depp standing to the left of Chris Katan. Chris is
        dressed up to go clubbing like from &quot;Night at the Roxbury&quot; and
        is bumping against Johnny Depp trying to get him to dance, and Johnny
        Depp is weirded out by this. And that&#x27;s it for the edges, the other
        two are solved. Now I imagine what I call a &quot;blast door&quot;. This
        is the separator that tells me the edge permutation is done. I imagine a
        big steel blast door falls from the sky behind Chris Katan and Johnny
        Depp. When I recall, I remember the blast door, which tells me the rest
        of the images are now corner information and not edges anymore. For the
        corners I start at UBL. This cycle is UBL->UFR->DFL->UBL So at the
        second speedbump I picture Dan Aykroyd petting a Dog. That ends that
        cycle so I start at DFR next. This cycle is DFR->DBR->DBL- >DFR. So at
        the office to my neighborhood I picture Hitler riding a Ferris Wheel.
        And that&#x27;s it for the permutations. I memorize the orientations by
        pure rote memory. So after the permutations I am done with my journeys.
        I had 10 prepared, but it only took 6 of the locations to memorize this
        cube, so I save the last 4 in this journey to be the first 4 locations
        in my next solve (I would start at the pool for the next solve and just
        continue on). This was a very atypical solve, because I place 3 images
        per location, but not a single cycle had more than 3 pieces. I just
        grabbed the first scramble from Jaap&#x27;s scrambler, but if you want
        an example of a solve with a longer cycle let me know. It&#x27;s the
        same idea but I imagine 3 images per location (from left to right)
        instead of just two. Hope this helps, Chris

        Chris, Thanks for that example. One thing I always had trouble with when
        trying to apply images to the cycles was to know when a cycle ends and
        where a new one starts. I guess it&#x27;s a bit easier with the story
        method; my attempts were all just using objects, and it became too
        annoying, so I always gave up. Also too annoying were the cases where
        you end up with two pairs that need swapping. But maybe it&#x27;s just
        because I was too used to Carr&#x27;s system. It seems like I am the
        only/lonely one using that system? I&#x27;m wondering: when we say some
        guys are using rote memory for the perms, is that really accurate. For
        ex. is remembering the shapes of cycles also a mnemonic system? I
        don&#x27;t know; I guess that&#x27;s what the fast guys are doing, from
        the little I know about their methods. Just rambling, -Dave O. --- In

        Hey everyone, For anyone following the stuff about using images, I am
        showing some improvement! I just did 2 solves on the 3x3x3. The first
        one was 3:35.01 success and the second one was a 3:23.xx DNF (had two
        edges flipped at the end). I am getting much faster at using images, and
        have noticed that without thinking I have started putting one whole
        cycle at each journey location. I had 4 images at one location, which
        represented one whole edge cycle . One image from the first solve I did
        was Michael Jordon pushing over the robot Sunny from the movie I Robot
        so that he landed on a miniature model of the white house, and the debri
        sprayed Chris Katan in the eyes. That image represents a 6 cycle of
        edges. I think this will be the way to go for using lots of images. Just
        place one whole cycle at each location. This will be easier than
        breaking up one cycle at different locations. Or at least those are my
        thoughts right now, I could change that again. Recall was very fast for
        both of those solves, but memorization was slower than when I just
        remember the shapes of cycles. It seems that already I am solving at the
        roughly the same speed as normally, but memorization is what is adding
        the time. Still, this is encouraging, the last solve I did before these
        two was about 6 minutes, so I&#x27;m getting better! Those two solves
        were done drawing from my pool of 132 images (the largest needed for the
        3x3x3 to have two objects per image). Chris

        Hey everyone, I just DNF&#x27;d a 5x5x5 solve, but the cool part is that
        I memorized it, comfortably, faster than I ever have a 5x5x5 before. I
        was using my images, and memorized the cube in 13 minutes! Now I did
        forget one journey location at the end of the solve (and I undid a setup
        move incorrectly at one point, so the solve wasn&#x27;t even a close
        DNF, just a DNF). Anyway, the fact is that I was comfortable enough with
        how I memorized it to start solving after 13 minutes! I can&#x27;t wait
        until I&#x27;ve used these images for a year or more! With my old stuff
        I would be somewhere in the middle of memorizing edges at 13 minutes,

        Ok there is no longer any doubt in my mind, for the larger cubes, this
        large image base system is one of the best methods (and probably for me,
        the best) there is. I just DNFd another 5x5x5 solve (only a 3 cycle of
        centers away this time!) using the new images. I went slow for the
        memorization in order to be careful, and memorized in 19 minutes. I
        finished the solve at 10 minutes (I believe that is the fastest I have
        ever solved the 5x5x5 blindfolded, ignoring the DNF and just considering
        the time taken to go through all of the memorized information). I&#x27;m
        not even using the full system, I only know a little over half. I
        can&#x27;t wait until I know the rest. The best part... This 5x5x5 solve
        was the 6th solve I&#x27;ve done in a row. The solves were 1) 4x4x4 2)
        4x4x4 3) 3x3x3 4) 3x3x3 5) 5x5x5 6) 5x5x5 Literally all in a row. The
        only breaks I took were to post the messages on this group. With my old
        system there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d ever be able to do this many solves
        in a row like that, and still memorize quickly. I still don&#x27;t know
        if this method will be best for the 3x3x3, but for me it just can&#x27;t
        get any better for the larger cubes. This method rocks so much!!! --- In

        Hey everyone, I just got a DNF on a 4x4x4 solve (ended with three
        corners flipped incorrectly, otherwise solved). However the cool part is
        that I memorized the centers in 1 minute 38 seconds, and solved them
        successfully. That&#x27;s my new record for fastest time to memorize the
        center permutation and still solve them successfully. I was using my
        images and journeys to do this. At the beginning of the solve I was able
        to rotate the cube so that 9 of the centers were already
        &quot;solved&quot;. So I had to memorize a 15 piece permutation. That
        works out to 6.5 seconds to memorize each piece on average. Seeing as
        how the card guys do 52 cards in, say, 40 seconds on a really really
        fast run, that&#x27;s 0.77 seconds per card, so I have a very, very long
        way to go to catch up to the pros. Still, this new method is already
        faster than my linked lists by about a minute. So I&#x27;m happy! If
        anyone is following this about images and journeys, I couldn&#x27;t
        recommend them more for the bigger cubes. I&#x27;ve already beaten all
        my memorization records using it, so give it a shot if you&#x27;re
        interested in the bigger cubes and are wondering how to memorize them!

        Hey J. Bernett, I think it&#x27;s interesting that you say I am an
        inspiration to you, because you and John Louis have been huge
        inspirations to me! Bernett, you already solve the bigger cubes
        blindfolded in very fast times, especially considering your age! I think
        in a few years I won&#x27;t be able to compete with you, because you
        will have had so much more training than me with memorization by then.
        In a sense I&#x27;m only trying to keep up by learning this new method!
        Keep up your good work! I am looking forward to US nationals, but I am

        and not (Rr)&#x27;. I start by memorizing the X centers, then the +
        centers, then the wing edges, then for the 3x3x3 pieces I do rote memory
        stuff right now, but one day I&#x27;ll use journeys and images. For this
        example I&#x27;ll use journeys for them too, since that is my eventual
        goal. I need two journeys to memorize this cube. My journeys are 24
        locations long, and I don&#x27;t know enough images to be able to cram
        the whole cube into one journey, so I&#x27;ll use two here since
        that&#x27;s what I really do. The journey locations don&#x27;t matter.
        I&#x27;ll just denote them with J1-2, J1-12, J2-4, etc. So J2-4 means
        the second journey and in that journey location number 4. J1-12 means
        journey number one, and location number 12. Keep in mind that all that I
        am writing here is sort of an intermediate way to use these images.
        Since I don&#x27;t know all of them yet, I can&#x27;t use them the way I
        am supposed to. I&#x27;m supposed to use three images per journey
        location, which equates to 6 pieces in the cycle. Since I don&#x27;t
        know some of the images I can only put one image per location if that
        image represents two pieces. Also I can put two images at a location if
        those images each represent one piece. I only do this when I don&#x27;t
        know that alphabet letter pair, and am forced to use one image per
        piece. Ok so I&#x27;ll write the cycle, then the letters, then the
        images, then the picture I see at the location. -------- Xcenters:

        Orientations I do by rote memory, so I&#x27;m done memorizing with
        images at this point. I now do CO and EO via rote, and start solving.
        ------ Again this method is only an intermediate version of what I will
        be using once I know all the images. Once I know all of them, I will put
        three images at every location (except when the cycle ends early of
        course) and each image will stand for 2 objects. So one journey location
        will be as many as 6 pieces of my cycle, instead of here maximum 3
        pieces. I&#x27;m hoping that doing it this way will make it twice as
        fast as this intermediate method is, which is already noticeably faster
        than my old method. So I&#x27;m hoping to be able to really improve my
        memorization for the bigger cubes (and the 3x3x3 too hopefully). Hope
        this helps, sorry this message is so terribly long, Chris

        Very awesome! Do you find the image system to be superior to PAO? PAO is
        what I use currently for the centers. I can explain what memory hooks

        Again well done Mr/Dr.Chris Hardwick! Very good explaination ! Since you
        are using free cycling, your solving time is very fast. Moreover your
        hard work to learn this new method of memorising and above all your high
        confidence level put you far ahead of any other cuber. You are a play
        maker of cubing sport!! This is the method of memorising I have also
        been doing. But of course, you know, I fix only one image at each
        location, because I solve one piece at a time. So, I have maximum 92
        locations for each cube. My naming of cubes also different. I named edge
        pieces in my mother tonge -Tamil. I learnt free cycling 2 months ago,
        but gave up practice as I went out for my vacation. Now, I have to
        restart. Ron uncle has invited me and my dad to Dutch open-2006. We are
        trying our best to make it. Are you also going ? Here is my humble
        opinion :- Your recording, retaining and recalling are perfect. If you
        improve your receiving technique, your memorisation time will come down
        from your 13 min to say 10 min or even below. Regarding missing out
        location, I too had the same promblem initially. But I overcame it with
        a technique and practice. You have 24 locations in every journey. Fix
        the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th and 24th locations of every journey in
        your permanent memory. When you memorise your true memory check if there
        are 3 informations between every fixed locations.Soon, It becomes a
        habit of your true memory. 3*3*3 memorisation :- For memorising binary
        digits convert them into numbers say 000 = 0 100 = 1 110 = 2 111 = 3 001
        = 4 010 = 5 011 = 6 101 = 7 In case your string of binary digits is 011,
        101, 000 , then the number you have to remember is 670. If you use
        phonetic sound and its value it is a single word = CHeQueS. This
        transformation is again a matter of practice. Again, in my opinion, if
        you blindsolve by stefan&#x27;smethod, memorisation is faster and easier
        than that of orientation, permutation method. Keep blindsolving and
        inspire everyone! J.Bernett Orlando cmhardw &lt;foozman17@...> wrote:

        already in the orientation in which you will solve it. Also, this alg is
        not a multislice alg, so any inner turn like r&#x27; do as (Rr)&#x27; R
        and not (Rr)&#x27;. I start by memorizing the X centers, then the +
        centers, then the wing edges, then for the 3x3x3 pieces I do rote memory
        stuff right now, but one day I&#x27;ll use journeys and images. For this
        example I&#x27;ll use journeys for them too, since that is my eventual
        goal. I need two journeys to memorize this cube. My journeys are 24
        locations long, and I don&#x27;t know enough images to be able to cram
        the whole cube into one journey, so I&#x27;ll use two here since
        that&#x27;s what I really do. The journey locations don&#x27;t matter.
        I&#x27;ll just denote them with J1-2, J1-12, J2-4, etc. So J2-4 means
        the second journey and in that journey location number 4. J1-12 means
        journey number one, and location number 12. Keep in mind that all that I
        am writing here is sort of an intermediate way to use these images.
        Since I don&#x27;t know all of them yet, I can&#x27;t use them the way I
        am supposed to. I&#x27;m supposed to use three images per journey
        location, which equates to 6 pieces in the cycle. Since I don&#x27;t
        know some of the images I can only put one image per location if that
        image represents two pieces. Also I can put two images at a location if
        those images each represent one piece. I only do this when I don&#x27;t
        know that alphabet letter pair, and am forced to use one image per
        piece. Ok so I&#x27;ll write the cycle, then the letters, then the
        images, then the picture I see at the location. -------- Xcenters:

        Orientations I do by rote memory, so I&#x27;m done memorizing with
        images at this point. I now do CO and EO via rote, and start solving.
        ------ Again this method is only an intermediate version of what I will
        be using once I know all the images. Once I know all of them, I will put
        three images at every location (except when the cycle ends early of
        course) and each image will stand for 2 objects. So one journey location
        will be as many as 6 pieces of my cycle, instead of here maximum 3
        pieces. I&#x27;m hoping that doing it this way will make it twice as
        fast as this intermediate method is, which is already noticeably faster
        than my old method. So I&#x27;m hoping to be able to really improve my
        memorization for the bigger cubes (and the 3x3x3 too hopefully). Hope

        Chris, This is all using the scramble you provided: F2 l d u b B&#x27;
        D&#x27; u2 F2 R&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27; u2 l2 f R r&#x27; U2 f d&#x27;

        D2 R2 B&#x27; l R2 f&#x27; l2 I am just doing this solve by text here so
        I apologize for any errors, but it should be pretty clean. I have a
        chronologically-based PAO system since the cycles work in threes and so
        in order to avoid having syncronization issues due to always using a
        &quot;position 1&quot; piece of a cycle, I change the person based on
        the position within that given cycle. I use the same image systems for
        both X centers and + centers (and wings) with the exception that the
        memory hooks made for the X centers are done so in the daylight, whereas
        the + center memory hooks are done in a darker setting. For the wings, I
        imagine everything happening underwater. This helps separate things in
        memory. It&#x27;s all similar to your image method I think, but of
        course a little different. I denote the centers as being on a face U F L
        R B or D in position 1 2 3 or 4, counted off on each face by going left
        to right, top to bottom. For example, luF is F1, ruF is F2, ldF is F3,
        and rdF is F4 for X centers. Same rule applies for any given face. The +
        centers are named in the same fashion. For the central edges, I denote
        them as follows: 1=UB 2=UL 3=UR 4=UF 5=FL 6=BL 7=BR 8=FR 9=DB 10=DL
        11=DR 12=DF For the wings, I traverse the cube in the same order as I do
        for the central edges, although this time I just associate two wings
        with letters of the alphabet. So I denote lUB as A, rUB as B, etc, until
        I go all the way to rDF as X. And corner order I start with UFL as the
        first corner, UBL as the second, UBR as third, UFR as fourth, DFL as
        fifth, DBL as sixth, DBR as seventh, and DFR as eighth. Corners 1-8 are
        associated with (in order) &quot;Begin,&quot; t, n, s, h, r, d, and l.
        Alrighty: Denoting the PAO letters for the X centers, we have: U1-U4 =
        A-D L1-L4 = E-H F1-F4 = I-L R1-R4 = M-P B1-B4 = Q-T D1-D4 = U-X Likewise
        applies for the + centers. Now for the PAO system itself. Since the
        longest possible cycle includes 4 pieces * 6 sides or 24 centers (either
        X or + centers), this means there would be a maximum of 12
        center-permutation algorithms needed (where 11 algs would actively
        permute three centers at a time, and the 12th algorithm would deal with
        only two centers that need switching but of course it can be done with
        any old center of a common color to finish the tri-cycle). Thus, 12
        &quot;People&quot; are needed for PAO: 1. Chuck Norris (because
        he&#x27;s badass) 2. Batman 3. Britney Spears (the pretty one) 4. Bill
        Clinton 5. Jim Carrey 6. My ex-girlfriend 7. Arnold Schwarzenegger 8.
        James Earl Jones 9. Jennifer Love Hewitt 10. Cyclops (cartoon version)
        11. Bart Simpson 12. God (a really hot, powerful one) I tried to space
        hot people roughly evenly throughout the P portion of PAO because
        it&#x27;s easier for me to remember sexually, ah, interesting things. I
        like using this P system because it allows me to not only know how far
        into the cycle I am, but it allows for easy recollection since I am
        using different people. In order to distinguish cycles and where things
        begin I simply take note of the start piece&#x27;s associated Object and
        keep it in mind. It is similar to your Blast Door thing. Now for the A
        and O of PAO: A:N/a,Apple B:Balances, Burrito C:Cries, Cactus D:Drags,

        usually resort to an item of chaos when there are no more pieces to
        cycle that can be called objects). ************** Solving the +-Centers:
        Start Piece: U1, since it&#x27;s not solved, so I picture a large apple
        in the night since U1 = A = Apple U1 -> L1 -> U2 or (P1) -> E -> B Chuck
        Norris electricutes a banana without any mercy at all whatsoever... the

        around, looking for intruders. U1 -> D3 -> R2 or (P6) -> W -> N My

        -> U My ex-girlfriend hits an urn and it floats away from her.
        That&#x27;s what you get for trying to damage expensive things. New
        Start Piece: D, since it&#x27;s the next unsolved piece, so I picture an
        underwater donkey, pissed off. D -> V -> O Arnold Schwarzenegger visits
        an ostrich, perhaps an underwater Chocobo of sorts from Final Fantasy?
        New Start Piece: E, since it&#x27;s the next unsolved piece, so I

        Edge Orientations: The bad central edges on the top layer: 1, 2, and 8,
        which makes 11, or K. The bad central edges on the middle layer: 1, or A
        The bad central edges on the bottom layer: 2, and 8, which makes 10, or
        J. Thus, the three letters here are K A J. I might make up a phrase like
        &quot;Kids Are Jovial&quot; to remember. ************** Solving the Edge
        Permutations: The cycles: (1 3 10 12 9) - I think of a Z shape that has
        been laid inside the cube such that the top and bottom horizontal parts
        of the Z bridge between the relevant edges on the top and bottom layers,
        respectively, with the diagonal part of the Z cutting through the cube.
        At the end of the Z, it has a straight tail that bends back to edge 9.
        (2 6 7 8) - I imagine a man looking out from a treehouse clear up on top
        of Edge 2 but he falls into a river that curls around the middle of the
        cube ending at Edge 8 after passing by Edges 6 and 7. **************
        Solving the Corner Orientations: (see
        http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/6343/corners8sh.png for reference) CO
        can be solved using the algs in the above link. CO is memorized rotely
        for now until I think of a better way. ************** Solving the Corner
        Permutation: The cycle: (Begin h n t l d s r) I can make a phrase out of
        this such as HuNT the LeaD, SiR!, as in someone telling another person
        to attack a guy at the front of a platoon or something. ***************
        Anyways sorry this is so long! This is just the new system I&#x27;ve
        been tinkering around with lately. Sorry for any typos or errors.

        [blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube] An example and description of memorizing
        the 5x5x5 with images and journeys Hey Marcus, absolutely I can give an
        example. Here is the scramble I used: F2 l d u b B&#x27; D&#x27; u2 F2
        R&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27; u2 l2 f R r&#x27; U2 f d&#x27; U&#x27; F d&#x27;
        r2 B2 d2 F2 r&#x27; l D2 b R f2 u&#x27; r2 F2 l2 b B&#x27; u&#x27; l
        r&#x27; F&#x27; B D&#x27; d2 l2 b D2 R2 U L&#x27; f2 D2 R2 B&#x27; l R2
        f&#x27; l2 Scramble with the cube already in the orientation in which
        you will solve it. Also, this alg is not a multislice alg, so any inner
        turn like r&#x27; do as (Rr)&#x27; R and not (Rr)&#x27;. I start by
        memorizing the X centers, then the + centers, then the wing edges, then
        for the 3x3x3 pieces I do rote memory stuff right now, but one day
        I&#x27;ll use journeys and images. For this example I&#x27;ll use
        journeys for them too, since that is my eventual goal. I need two
        journeys to memorize this cube. My journeys are 24 locations long, and I
        don&#x27;t know enough images to be able to cram the whole cube into one
        journey, so I&#x27;ll use two here since that&#x27;s what I really do.
        The journey locations don&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;ll just denote them with
        J1-2, J1-12, J2-4, etc. So J2-4 means the second journey and in that
        journey location number 4. J1-12 means journey number one, and location
        number 12. Keep in mind that all that I am writing here is sort of an
        intermediate way to use these images. Since I don&#x27;t know all of
        them yet, I can&#x27;t use them the way I am supposed to. I&#x27;m
        supposed to use three images per journey location, which equates to 6
        pieces in the cycle. Since I don&#x27;t know some of the images I can
        only put one image per location if that image represents two pieces.
        Also I can put two images at a location if those images each represent
        one piece. I only do this when I don&#x27;t know that alphabet letter
        pair, and am forced to use one image per piece. Ok so I&#x27;ll write
        the cycle, then the letters, then the images, then the picture I see at
        the location. -------- Xcenters:

        Orientations I do by rote memory, so I&#x27;m done memorizing with
        images at this point. I now do CO and EO via rote, and start solving.
        ------ Again this method is only an intermediate version of what I will
        be using once I know all the images. Once I know all of them, I will put
        three images at every location (except when the cycle ends early of
        course) and each image will stand for 2 objects. So one journey location
        will be as many as 6 pieces of my cycle, instead of here maximum 3
        pieces. I&#x27;m hoping that doing it this way will make it twice as
        fast as this intermediate method is, which is already noticeably faster
        than my old method. So I&#x27;m hoping to be able to really improve my
        memorization for the bigger cubes (and the 3x3x3 too hopefully). Hope
        this helps, sorry this message is so terribly long, Chris

        Hey Marcus, Thanks for the memorization description, I like the way you
        handled the difference piece types by having things happen at night, or
        under water, or just in the daytime! Also some of those images are
        hilarious, I can easily see how you can memorize them quickly! I also
        think it&#x27;s cool how you use your people to show that it&#x27;s a
        different 3-cycle, and memorize the start piece to the whole cycle
        beforehand. As for which method is faster, I really don&#x27;t know. I
        think they both can be very fast. I know that I have heard of a number
        of people putting one image per location, and that representing one
        object to be memorized. J. Bernett I remember you saying in your post
        about 2 messages ago that you do this, and I&#x27;ve heard of people
        from the memory sports group also saying that they use it. For me I am
        not very fast at getting the images into my head. I tried doing one
        image per location, but I guess my encoding step (Bernett, I&#x27;ll use
        your term here) is significantly slower than my recall. That&#x27;s why
        I wanted to use a method that put so much information into one journey
        location. I may be slow at encoding, so I might as well cram a whole
        crap load of information into one image to make up for that. The
        downside is that I have a lot of prep work to do, and a lot of practice
        work to maintain very quick recall on my images whenever I see any
        alphabet letter pair. Marcus, it seems to me that you have very quick
        encoding already, so maybe this PAO method would be much better for you.
        I tried a PAO system for a short time for the 4x4x4 and found that I
        could not come up with good ways to combine the verbs and the objects.
        Sometimes it fit very easily, but other times I struggled. You seem to
        be very familiar with how your verbs and people and objects combine, and
        also your way of changing the scenery into night, or underwater, to
        recognize piece type. I would say if it works, train it until it becomes
        reflex, and turn it into a science. I guess I don&#x27;t really think
        one of these methods is better than the other, because there is so much
        variety in how people memorize. For me, I need to cram a crapload of
        information into one image (as much as I can) because I can&#x27;t seem
        to speed up my encoding. It seems I am taking 6.5 seconds per piece on
        average to memorize a cube. That&#x27;s like memorizing a deck of cards
        in 5 minutes 38 seconds. Considering that a time under 2 minutes is
        considered very good and a time under 1 minute world class, I have a
        long way to go to improve my memory. That&#x27;s why I wanted a method
        that had so many images, to overcome my encoding step. My recall is much
        faster than my memorizing, and I&#x27;ve even had times on the 4x4x4
        where my memorizination was much slower than normal (14 minutes or so)
        but I was still about to solve in 5-6 minutes and get an overall time
        near 20 minutes. I say if your method works, train it until it becomes
        reflex. I don&#x27;t think a very large image base is required for a
        fast memorization, but I think it helps a lot. It takes the burden off
        your mind being fast, and makes it easy for you to still have slower
        steps, but just do things very efficiently and still go quickly. Just my
        thoughts, what do you think? The more I think about it the more I think
        there is no fastest method, but there is a &quot;fastest&quot; method
        for each person and how their brain works. Maybe I&#x27;m just babbling
        and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about, but that&#x27;s how I
        view it right now. I just have seen too much variety in how people
        memorize to think that there is a best method. Chris --- In

        Hey Bernett, > > Again well done Mr/Dr.Chris Hardwick! Very good
        explaination ! Since you are using free cycling, your solving time is
        very fast. Moreover your hard work to learn this new method of
        memorising and above all your high confidence level put you far ahead of
        any other cuber. You are a play maker of cubing sport!! > Thanks for the
        kind words. I am definitely hoping to help show people that using a
        technique can be fast, even if only for the bigger cubes. I know you and
        Stefan, and Marcus too I think, have been using journey methods much
        longer than I have. So I certainly am not a pioneer here. I just wanted
        to help take the image part of the journeys to a new level for BLD
        cubing, or what I hope is a new level at least. Maybe it has already
        been done, but I hope to at least be one of the people trying to do
        this. > This is the method of memorising I have also been doing. But of
        course, you know, I fix only one image at each location, because I solve
        one piece at a time. So, I have maximum 92 locations for each cube. My
        naming of cubes also different. I named edge pieces in my mother tonge
        -Tamil. > I learnt free cycling 2 months ago, but gave up practice as I
        went out for my vacation. Now, I have to restart. That&#x27;s cool, it
        seems that you also memorize just one image per locaton, and one image
        there. I think my receiving (or encoding, whichever word means the
        actual memorizing) is not as fast as yours. I have tried to memorize one
        piece per location before, but was not able to do it very quickly. Also
        I tended to forget the images near the beginning of my journey at the
        start of a 5x5x5 BLD solve when I memorized that way. I know that this
        technique is fairly popular though, I&#x27;ve heard of people from the
        memory sports group also using this and memorizing speed cards in very
        fast times. If it works, I say stick with it and turn it into reflex! >
        > Ron uncle has invited me and my dad to Dutch open-2006. We are trying
        our best to make it. Are you also going ? I wish I could go, but I am
        really broke right now. I&#x27;m having a bit of a time just saving up
        money for the US nationals this year. Once I get a stable career job and
        a good salary I hope to save some money and make a competition in Europe
        every now and then, that would be awesome! > > Here is my humble opinion
        :- Your recording, retaining and recalling are perfect. If you improve
        your receiving technique, your memorisation time will come down from
        your 13 min to say 10 min or even below. Regarding missing out location,
        I too had the same promblem initially. But I overcame it with a
        technique and practice. You have 24 locations in every journey. Fix the
        4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th and 24th locations of every journey in your
        permanent memory. When you memorise your true memory check if there are
        3 informations between every fixed locations.Soon, It becomes a habit of
        your true memory. Yeah I see what you mean about receiving. I notice
        that I tend to picture the image(s) at the journey location for several
        seconds before I have them memorized. Watching Ben Pridmore&#x27;s video
        of how quickly he goes through 6 cards (one journey location for him) I
        just can&#x27;t get over his speed! I don&#x27;t memorize locations
        nearly that quickly! Is there a way to speed up that part of memorizing?
        Or does it just come with practice? > > 3*3*3 memorisation :- For
        memorising binary digits convert them into numbers > say 000 = 0 > 100 =
        1 > 110 = 2 > 111 = 3 > 001 = 4 > 010 = 5 > 011 = 6 > 101 = 7 > In case
        your string of binary digits is 011, 101, 000 , then the number you have
        to remember is 670. If you use phonetic sound and its value it is a
        single word = CHeQueS. This transformation is again a matter of
        practice. I have been wanting to learn the phonetic sounds that go with
        the numbers, but I have been too lazy too lately to be honest. I&#x27;ve
        just been wanting to learn these images. I&#x27;d like to be using 3
        images per location by the time the US nationals gets here, and I have
        184 images left to learn, plus I need time to get used to using 3 images
        per location, which I haven&#x27;t done before. > Again, in my opinion,
        if you blindsolve by stefan&#x27;smethod, memorisation is faster and
        easier than that of orientation, permutation method. I think that&#x27;s
        true, especially for the 3x3x3. I am just so used to freestyle cycling,
        and I love the method so much, that I think I am stuck. I think both
        methods are fast, Stefan and I proved that by our 4x4x4 edges races, but
        I think I like freestyle cycling too much to switch. I hope to overcome
        the harder memory stuff though. For the 5x5x5 I would lose times on the
        EO and CO because I do them by rote, but I am hoping to make up for that
        with faster centers and edges. > > Keep blindsolving and inspire
        everyone! > J.Bernett Orlando Same to you! You&#x27;ve already helped
        inspire me to try blindsolving, and try to get better at it! Keep
        practicing! You have a natural talent for memory, and with just a little
        practice you could be getting amazingly fast times on the bigger cubes!
        Your times are already very fast, but I think with your memory that they
        could be much faster! Take care, and happy cubing! Chris

      <div class="email-content">
        Chris, The hardest part of any memorization method is the encoding-to-
        reality portion. That is, looking at a part of the cube and thinking
        &quot;This represents a can of beer&quot; or something. But the images
        you use should be close to you such that it&#x27;s easy to recall. For
        instance, after making my PAO list, I already had it memorized because
        the verbs/objects I used were simply the first things that came to mind
        that were easy to remember (I mean, for instance, come on what&#x27;s
        the dirtiest F verb you can think of? That sort of thing takes no
        practice to remember, lol). And yes having a lot of information can be a
        good thing in terms of ensuring minimal errors in decoding because
        there&#x27;s a lot of data there to help you. With practice this will
        become quicker for you so I would not worry so much about this approach
        at all! As for PAO, it is easier for me simply because there are already
        many associations of information bound to the things in these lists. For
        instance, if you&#x27;re in the nighttime cycle of things and
        you&#x27;re on Bill Clinton, you might automatically get an image of
        Clinton in the Oval Office at nighttime, coupled with whatever verbs and
        objects you want that are relevant. There is still a lot of information
        there to help you remember, and you can just recall the verbs and
        objects necessary. Changing the scenery is useful in my opinion because
        it adds a new level of interaction to the memory hooks. If you want a
        rough idea of time needed to memorize: At the fastest it takes maybe 4
        seconds to memorize a story for 3 centers, but sometimes longer if I
        have to think to remember what objects/letters are associated with a
        piece (this part is the hardest for me because there&#x27;s no easy way
        around it -- you just have to rotely memorize which centers/edges/etc
        are what letters and be able to train this into reflex). You are not
        babbling in your last paragraph! I think it is spot-on. We have variety
        in our methods because as humans we have different thought processes. I
        can already tell your method is going to be really good for you once you
        get the image system down -- if you&#x27;re comfortable with a given
        approach you should definitely stick to it. You&#x27;re already getting
        great times and they can only get better! It&#x27;s exciting :D -Marcus

        edges to be swapped diagonally opposite in one inner slice so that
        doubletwisting that slice swaps the two edges. That&#x27;s why I use FR
        as setup moves and then the b2 swaps them. Then I replace the two
        swapped edges with the other two. I just tried getting the old ones out
        of b2 with L&#x27; and U and saw that F&#x27; replaces them with the
        other two (this was pure luck). Then put those into b2 with U&#x27; and
        L. And finish the commutator like usual. Cheers! Stefan

        Hey everyone, I finally completed my long term goal of the 3x3x3
        memorization technique I&#x27;ve been learning. The final product uses
        188 images and consists of 132 for the edges and 56 for the corners. I
        letter the edges A-L and the corners M-T. This means that I never have
        to do any sort of memory hook or blast door, or situation change or
        anything. I will simply know that if I see any of the 56 images for
        corners, it can&#x27;t be an edge because only corners use images in the
        M-T range. I haven&#x27;t yet done any solves this way, because I
        literally finished learning those images today, and when I tested myself
        tonight I had fast recall on all the final ones for this 3x3 method.
        Again, I don&#x27;t know if this method will be faster than the standard
        way of memorizing, but I am sure excited to try it! If nothing else,
        using images like this would make it much easier to try for a record
        number of 3x3x3&#x27;s memorized than my current approach. Anyway I just
        wanted to post on my progress. I&#x27;m very happy to have finally
        finished the 3x3x3 method I want to use! I&#x27;ll try to keep you all
        updated on how it goes once I start practicing with it. Chris

        experience. J.Bernett Orlando cmhardw &lt;foozman17@...> wrote: Hey
        everyone, I finally completed my long term goal of the 3x3x3
        memorization technique I&#x27;ve been learning. The final product uses
        188 images and consists of 132 for the edges and 56 for the corners. I
        letter the edges A-L and the corners M-T. This means that I never have
        to do any sort of memory hook or blast door, or situation change or
        anything. I will simply know that if I see any of the 56 images for
        corners, it can&#x27;t be an edge because only corners use images in the
        M-T range. I haven&#x27;t yet done any solves this way, because I
        literally finished learning those images today, and when I tested myself
        tonight I had fast recall on all the final ones for this 3x3 method.
        Again, I don&#x27;t know if this method will be faster than the standard
        way of memorizing, but I am sure excited to try it! If nothing else,
        using images like this would make it much easier to try for a record
        number of 3x3x3&#x27;s memorized than my current approach. Anyway I just
        wanted to post on my progress. I&#x27;m very happy to have finally
        finished the 3x3x3 method I want to use! I&#x27;ll try to keep you all
        updated on how it goes once I start practicing with it. Chris Send

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve fallen in love. I&#x27;ve only done 3 solves
        with my system finally completed to the way I want to do it, and already
        I love it. I&#x27;m using 132 images for the edges (12*11 possible two
        letter combinations) and 56 completely different images for the corners
        (8*7 possible two letter combinations). For those 3 solves I memorized
        each cube using on average 4 journey locations. One of the solves I
        memorized a 7 cycle of edges in one journey location. I had Michael
        Jordon introducing Cameron Diaz to a Gentleman in a suit, and when the
        man turned around to leave he stepped on a bee hive and was attacked by
        a swarm of bees. That encoded the cycle (UB UF BL DL UL BR DR) in one
        picture. I also had a 6 cycle of corners in one picture on that same
        solve. I had Dan Marino exercising on a Nordic Track. When he was done
        he got off and got into an above ground pool filled with spaghetti
        noodles to relax. Donald Trump saw him, got mad at him for being lazy
        and fired him. That was (UBL UBR DBR DFL UFR DFR). My fastest of the
        three solves was around 3:46.xx with memorization done at 2:47.xx so I
        still have a ways to go to speed up on the memory part, but I think it
        can be done with lots of practice. Also to have done the solve part in
        about 1 minute (a little faster than average for me on the solving) is
        pretty cool! I&#x27;ve been finding that I tend to try to place one
        entire cycle into one journey location unless it&#x27;s really long, and
        then I break it up. I think I will regularly try to put at most 8 pieces
        into one location, and break up larger cycles into 2 locations. Or if
        the cycle ends earlier than 8 pieces obviously I move to another
        location for the next cycle. Just my thoughts on this new (to me) way to
        memorize. I certainly have absolutely no interest in ever using my old
        &quot;picture the shapes of the cycles inside the cube&quot; method ever
        again. This new method just has me too excited! My rambling two cents,
        Chris P.S. Ben Pridmore has an image for every pair of 2 cards
        (52*51=2652 images) and can manage them. I was thinking that having an
        image for every single, pair, and triplet of edges and corners might be
        a good idea for REALLY fast times, and it would still be less than the
        number of images Ben uses. So you would have
        (12*11*10)+(12*11)+(12)=1464 images for the edges and
        (8*7*6)+(8*7)+(8)=400 images for corners. 1864 images is definitely less
        than Ben&#x27;s 2652, and he manages pretty well with his images set.
        Maybe one day someone will learn the 1864 needed to really go crazy on
        the 3x3x3? I&#x27;d kind of like to propose to Ben that idea, since he
        could just use a subset of his images to do this, and see what he
        thinks. Maybe it&#x27;s not worth it, or it would be too much work for
        too little gain in time. But since he&#x27;s already done the work
        I&#x27;d be curious in what he thinks. Just more rambling thoughts here,
        if you read this far congrats lol. I tend to babble a lot ;-)

        really go crazy on the 3x3x3? Scratch that idea actually. I was thinking
        more about it, and that would involve placing three pieces into one
        image, which would mean having one image contain pieces from two
        different 3-cycles. I already tried doing a method like that and it is
        very easy to get confused doing that. Now using it for Stefan&#x27;s
        method would probably work better. Then each component letter would be
        one execution of an alg. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong but you would need
        24 ways to differentiate edges. So you could combine them into two
        pieces per image in 528 ways (24*22). There are 24 ways to differentiate
        corners, so you could have two corners in one image in 504 ways (24*21).
        Did I do the math right there? If so, that is a very exciting idea to be
        able to memorize like that! Wow, now that I think about it, I think
        using Stefan&#x27;s method would probably be much more conducive to a
        memory system than the traditional orient first. You could encode more
        information very quickly, and you don&#x27;t have to do the orientations
        by rote memory, it is also part of the images. Wow.. I just might have
        become a convert to Stefan&#x27;s method. The more I think about it, the
        more I think I agree with Stefan and J. Bernett. I think his method is
        better for memorizing than orient first. Hmmmmm... I want to mess around
        with this some more. Chris

        Hi everyone, I finally finished learning all 580 images for memorizing
        the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 with alphabet letter pairs. I am still rusty on the
        few I learned tonight, but given enough time I can recall all the letter
        pairs. I&#x27;m going to work on speed of recall for the most recent
        ones I&#x27;ve learned, but I plan on trying some solves using 3 images
        per location really soon. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else is interested
        in learning images like this, but it doesn&#x27;t take that long to
        learn them. I started learning near the end of April, and I just
        finished today so it took about a month and a half to learn them all.
        I&#x27;ll try to update on how the solving goes using the images,
        I&#x27;m not ready to try it yet, but I will soon. Chris

        Wow.... I was too excited about this to wait, I had to post right now..
        I just got a DNF on a 4x4x4 BLD solve. So that part wasn&#x27;t cool.
        Also the cube had two switched centers, which means I forgot a piece
        during the solving. So that part wasn&#x27;t cool. What was cool was
        that I stopped the timer at 9 minutes 11 seconds!!!!! I went slow during
        memorization, and even had a delay on recalling one alphabet letter pair
        (one of my newest ones). I still finished memorizing at 5 minutes 15
        seconds. I then did the recall and the entire solve (almost, it was a
        DNF by 2 pieces) in less than 4 minutes!!!! I placed three images at
        each location, and was able to memorize the entire 4x4x4 cube in 6
        journey locations! This method is just ridiculous! Boris Konrad told me
        once that he thought he could memorize the 4x4x4 in 3-4 minutes. I think
        he underestimated the time. I think it would be possible to memorize the
        whole cube in slightly under 3 minutes on a somewhat consistent basis.
        Oh wow....... I can&#x27;t believe how fast these images are!!! I&#x27;m
        so excited to continue practicing this method that my hands are shaking
        right now and it&#x27;s hard to type! I&#x27;m going to go do another
        solve right now!! Chris P.S. Oh my God this memorization techniques is

        Ok a legitimate solve this time. I memorized in 6 minutes 30 seconds
        roughly and the total time was 11 minutes 54.90 seconds. That&#x27;s my

        and she rowed the boat into a miniature light house and knocked it over.

        Hey Bob, What I am doing is to letter each piece on a 24 piece orbital
        of a larger cube (wing edges, Xcenters, +centers) with a letter from
        A-X. This gives me 24*23=552 possible ways to combine two letters into
        an alphabet letter pair. So AB, CF, JR, MN, XD are all alphabet letter
        pairs. When I have my cycle on the cube, I convert everything to
        letters, and convert the pairs to images. Which image goes with which
        letter pair is what I had to learn. Over the 552 there are 28 more
        images that I need. So if I had the letters above in a cycle, then my
        cycle would be (ABCFJRMNXD) That becomes (A) (BC) (FJ) (RM) (NX) (D)
        which becomes Dan Aykroyd rides a bicycle into a 6 foot tall fudge
        easter bunny. Then at my next location I imagine Dan jumping over a
        miniature model of the Roman Coloseum, bumping into a player from the
        Knicks. The player falls into Johnny Depp and knocks him down. So in two
        journey locations (basically two very short stories, or two very large
        images) I can memorize a 10 cycle of edge pieces on the 4x4x4 say. I
        could not recommend this method (or one similar to it) more! I&#x27;ve
        already broken my personal fastest 4x4x4 BLD solve I also had a very
        near miss sub-10 solve (only 2 centers switched). As far as where I
        learned about the method, I bugged the guys at the memory sports group
        with incessant question for a while, and a number of them put their
        heads together and recommended this method to me. I&#x27;m thinking
        about putting it on my web page and explaining what I am doing, because
        it really is amazingly fast! Also it only took about a month and a half
        to learn, which is really not that long. The work pays off basically.

        How much of that cube was solved at start already? With 6 locations each
        holding 3 images each representing 2 letters each representing one
        cubie, you represented 36 cubies. The 4x4 has 56 (visible) cubies, so
        were about 20 already solved right at the start? That sounds veeery
        lucky. Cheers! Stefan

        house and knocked it over. It&#x27;s late but I can&#x27;t sleep. Going
        to try a few more solves tonight before I go to bed. Chris

        Hey Stefan, I just used Netcube to come up with the scramble, I
        don&#x27;t think it was much luckier than average, but I do remember it
        having very nice centers. I still don&#x27;t use journey locations for
        the corners, I just do them by rote, or &quot;picture the shapes of the
        cycles&quot; if that&#x27;s the official name. I want to switch over to
        using images for them, but I&#x27;m still slower at using images than by
        &quot;shapes of cycles&quot; for them, so I don&#x27;t use them yet. I
        might have placed 8 pieces into one journey location. Sometimes I will
        put an 8 cycle into one location as 4 images if the whole cycle is 8
        pieces long. I partially remember the solve, let me see how much I can
        put together. 1) Dan Aykroyd sees a model on a beach chair (some other
        object), 5 pieces 2) Evanescence band members, a famous person, the
        stargate (5 pieces) 3) George W. Bush eating a bowl of Kix cereal, then
        Chuck Norris kicks the bowl out from under him (WKXN so 4 pieces).
        *BLAST DOOR* That&#x27;s 14 centers unsolved, so 10 solved already. That
        is a little uncommon to have that many, but it&#x27;s definitely
        happened to me a number of times before. I&#x27;d say I average around 8
        solved on most solves, so 2 more than normal on this one. 4) I
        don&#x27;t remember this location at all but it would have had to have
        had 5 pieces for me to not start the next cycle with a famous person and
        instead with a letter pair. 5) The big bad wolf huffs and blows an Ox,
        the smell drifts over to the Evanescence band members (HFOXEV so 6
        pieces) 6) I don&#x27;t remember this location at all. I might have put
        8 pieces here as 4 images, but I don&#x27;t know. Yeah that doesn&#x27;t
        sound right to me either. I think 6 locations would be either incredibly
        lucky, or would have to have 10 centers already solved as well as 5
        edges. I know my solve didn&#x27;t have 5 edges solved, so I imagine I
        would have used 7 locations and placed only 6 pieces in the 6th location
        and not 8. That would have given me up to a 23 cycle of edges using a
        7th location. I apologize, I thought I had used 6 locations, but I agree
        that would be a lucky solve most likely, so I imagine I had to have used
        7. Other than having a nice centers setup the solve didn&#x27;t feel
        particularly easy. Chris P.S. I&#x27;ve been working with the images
        more today. I got one solve in 13 minutes and one in 15 minutes. I still
        have slow recall of what image goes with some letter pairs, but I&#x27;m
        working on it. Also having lots of cycles on the edges messes me up. If
        I were to have a 23 cycle of edges I could memorize that much faster
        than a combination of three 8 cycles. I think with more practice that
        shouldn&#x27;t mess me up much, but a longer cycle is still much easier
        to memorize for me right now. --- In

        even 7 locations sounds great. A 3x3 takes me around 11-12 locations.
        Maybe I&#x27;ll should try the 4x4, too. Right now I&#x27;m focusing on
        multi-3x3s, I&#x27;m close to Dave&#x27;s five cube record time...

        Hey everyone, I&#x27;m almost to sub-10 for a legitimate solve. I just
        set my new pb time for doing the 4x4x4 BLD. I memorize in just over 6
        minutes and stopped the timer at 10:31.23 minutes with a solved cube! I
        was playing loud music during the solve and wearing my earmuffs too. I
        made a very large mistake during memorization and had to completely
        delete what I had at one journey location and start over at that
        location. So this was even with a huge error! I know I am very close to
        sub-10! Recall using these images is very fast, so I just need a good,
        smooth, clean memorization phase to get sub-10! Next stop, sub-10!!!
        Marcus, I know you&#x27;ve already done sub-8, I don&#x27;t remember if
        you said it was lucky or not, but I can easily see how these images can
        get sub-8 with a lot of practice. I already had one solve where I
        successfully (and correctly) memorized the cube in 4:45. I messed up
        during the solve was able to trace the mistake, so I have finally
        equalled Boris Konrad&#x27;s prediction of correctly memorizing the 4x4
        in 3-4 minutes (the higher end obviously). I imagine I am several months
        away from sub-8 time, but watch out. I plan on getting sub-8 myself, I
        no longer think it is impossible ;-) Chris

        I haven&#x27;t posted on here for quite some time. My latest update
        doesn&#x27;t warrant an &quot;oh my god!!..&quot;, but I am happy with

        Single Solve == 5:53.xx b) 2 Cubes in a Row == 35:xx.xx This was done
        using the PAO method, though I&#x27;m in the process of switching to the
        method Chris is currently employing. The 2 Cubes in a Row solve was done
        very meticulously and I&#x27;m sure I can get under 20 minutes very
        soon. Seriously considering focusing on multiple cubes in a row.
        What&#x27;s the official world record for this category? I&#x27;ve also

        For 3x3x3 cube relays I would strongly advise against PAO unless you
        know the system like the back of your hand -- otherwise you will be
        accurate but with a slower time. I think just using your normal system
        only slower would be more prudent -- the larger image systems are more
        appropriate for the larger cubes. I have a video of me on Google Video
        doing a three-cube relay blindfolded if you&#x27;d like to see what I
        mean (those solves were done using the normal blindfolding method
        CO/CP/EO/EP only memorized slower than normal to ensure higher degrees
        of accuracy). The times you posted though are excellent! The better
        systems you use + practice = lower times, which you have certainly seen
        for yourself! --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hey Richard, That&#x27;s awesome! Congrats on the new PB times! Did you
        do anything different for the multiple cube attempt, or just memorize
        slowly and carefully? Also, for the higher order cubes, I can post my
        PAO stuff here if you need information for the higher letters (M-X). I
        still have it written down, and you&#x27;re welcome to it if it would
        help. Also Marcus posted his PAO stuff in an earlier message too, so
        that would be two lists to look at. You&#x27;ve already done half the
        work with a PAO system for A-L, so don&#x27;t think of it as a lot of

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, Wow. Ok I&#x27;m a bit humbled to be honest. I&#x27;ve
        been using my letter pair images on the 3x3x3 for a while now, and
        I&#x27;m finding that it is incredibly difficult to go quickly. I letter
        the edges from A-L and the corners from M-T and place three images per
        location. Each image is a letter pair and represents two pieces in the
        cycle. I&#x27;m finding that very often I will see a 3 cycle, and
        &quot;read&quot; it. I think it&#x27;s like Stefan described how a
        binary expert could probably read 6 binary digits and have it be a
        meaningful piece of information, rather than 6 random binary digits. I
        find that I sort of already memorize the 3 pieces in the cycle by
        &quot;reading&quot; it. This confuses me and makes it hard to then still
        go ahead and convert those pieces to their letters and then to their
        images and then place them in the journey. It&#x27;s like my brain is
        saying &quot;what are you doing? I already have those three
        memorized!&quot; I&#x27;m really very seriously starting to think that
        these images might not be the best approach to the 3x3x3. Or maybe I
        need to use them in a different way. Or maybe they are not good for the
        orient first method. Either way, 3 images per location and each image
        representing a letter pair or two pieces seems to not be the optimal
        approach. I&#x27;ve thought about using images and journeys for the
        edges, and rote for the corners. Then switching the next solve. I
        haven&#x27;t tried that yet, but it&#x27;s on my list. Either way, I
        admit defeat on the 3x3x3. I just can&#x27;t figure out how to apply
        these images to the 3x3x3 in a fast way. I&#x27;ve thought about using
        these images for Stefan&#x27;s method too, since I could give each edge
        two letters depending on it&#x27;s flip, and each corner 3 letters
        depending on it&#x27;s flip. So if I see the UBL corner goes to UFR and
        also has to flip clockwise that could be the letter L. The same corner
        having to flip counter clockwise could be K, and with no flip could be
        J. I think this might be a good way to use the images, but I still need
        to try it. Then I could also use two letter per image the same way. This
        would be nice because I wouldn&#x27;t have to memorize the flips of
        edges or corners by rote anymore. Anyway, I have yet to try this because
        to be honest I&#x27;m really bad at Stefan&#x27;s method. I&#x27;m going
        to start practicing with it though. I&#x27;m completely lost as to how
        to adapt this method quickly to the orient first method. My only thought
        is that if I do this for 3 years I will be so quick at reading the
        letters off the pieces, and converting to images and I would know my
        journeys like the back of my hand. I think the only way to make the
        images fast for the 3x3x3 is to be so comfortable with the method that
        you can do it without thinking through any of the steps. I would guess
        maybe 6 months of practice to get to the times that Leyan and Tyson are
        putting up, maybe. As for the bigger cubes though, I think these images
        are close to an ideal method for memorizing with the free cycling
        method. I can&#x27;t really think of any improvements to it, other than
        little tricks like placing 4 images in a location if it completes the
        cycle, rather than having only one image at the next journey location.
        Anyway, like I said above I admit defeat for the 3x3x3 BLD. I think you
        just need a natural gift at memory to do it quickly. I&#x27;ll keep
        trying to use this system for it, and if things start improving
        I&#x27;ll post. As far as things go now, I&#x27;m really on the border
        and am leaning more towards not using the system for the 3x3x3. I still
        need to think about ways to fix it for the 3x3x3 though. One last thing
        I&#x27;ve thought about is to ditch the journeys entirely, and just
        memorize the images in a sort of void. I could imagine them all strong
        out from left to right, or in a story the way I used to use my linked
        lists for the centers of a larger cube. I think maybe getting rid of the
        journey, and just using a &quot;void&quot; might make things go more
        quickly. Just some ideas, anyone else have any thoughts on this? Dave I
        know you use a system for the 3x3x3. Marcus, same with you, and Richard
        I know you are using one. What do you guys think about a more detailed
        system vs. &quot;reading&quot;? The thing that is hardest for me is to
        try to memorize a short 2-cycle or 3-cycle via images, when I have
        already &quot;read&quot; it and remembered it. Chris

        Hehe again, using that big image system is just overkill for the smaller
        cubes. I tried it myself but to no avail -- I strongly recommend
        sticking to a simpler, more direct method for the 3x3x3 and 2x2x2 cubes.
        4x4x4 is where the higher-order systems kick in and begin to become
        useful. Think of it like a compression algorithm: They tend to work
        better for larger chunks of data. Using it for smaller pieces of data
        tends to be not very optimal for any regard. You don&#x27;t have to do
        rote for the corners though -- the Major system works just fine and is
        very quick and effective. CO... that is something that, for now, has to
        be done rote unless letters were associated with certain CO cases but I
        haven&#x27;t really looked into this yet. As I said before for the 3x3,
        using the big systems will slow you down even though they are accurate.
        You are better off using a system that allows for quicker decoding since
        there are so fewer pieces. (How does Stefan&#x27;s method truly work? I
        understand the point of the buffer but I don&#x27;t know how you go
        about memorizing the cube? The only reason I haven&#x27;t done this
        method is because I don&#x27;t fully understand it yet). As for getting
        low 3x3 times it&#x27;s really a matter of reflex. For instance, you can
        just glance around at the corner order and just pick up the letters as
        you go without really thinking, and then you spend a second or two
        making up a phrase with it, and then you move on to the next memory
        item. It&#x27;s quick, easy, and doesn&#x27;t require hundreds of images
        to decode. &quot;As for the bigger cubes though, I think these images
        are close to an ideal method for memorizing with the free cycling
        method. I can&#x27;t really think of any improvements to it, other than
        little tricks like placing 4 images in a location if it completes the
        cycle, rather than having only one image at the next journey
        location.&quot; Yep images are probably the best for the bigger cubes
        simply because they are beyond a degree of using rote-approaches
        comfortably. Have you tried using static markers for points in a journey
        to intermix with your images? This would eliminate the need for a void.
        For instance if, say, Will Smith is in an image you might know it&#x27;s
        the 6th iteration within a cycle. The system I use for the 5x5x5 I
        posted in that earlier message and it&#x27;s all I do, really -- not
        much more to it than that. For the 3x3x3 I&#x27;ve begun to memorize CO
        last because then it&#x27;s easy to take a quick &quot;mental
        snapshot&quot; of the cube. Look at a scrambled cube and just
        CLOSEYOUREYESANDTHINKREALFAST and you will be able to picture the
        corners briefly -- just solve them out before you start second- guessing
        your memory. CP, use Major. EO, use Binary system. EP, use a little
        story to link images together where the images are derived from the
        cycle shapes.

        Hey Marcus, Good points, yeah I think for a single solve that this
        method is definitely overkill. I was thinking over it some more though,
        I think for attempts at multiple 3x3x3&#x27;s that maybe a method like
        this could be pretty good. A lot of the images at each location are
        funny, or weird, and are definitely memorable. So I think it would be
        possible to hold onto a lot of information this way. I guess I should
        specify that I was trying to adapt the letter pairs to going very
        quickly on a single solve, but I wonder if maybe that isn&#x27;t the
        best idea. I think for multiple cubes, that using letter pairs would be
        more helpful than using them for a single solve. Just my thoughts, I
        want to try the major system a little for the pieces. The only problem
        is that if I see AHBGDECF I would have a hard time coming up with a
        sentence because I would immediately think (Air Hockey, Borg, Dentist,
        Coffee) because of the letter pairs. Maybe a funny image in a void of an
        Air hockey table, the puck flies off and hits a borg drone in the head,
        he turns around, hitting a nearby dentist in the head with his longer
        arm, and the dentist spills his coffee into his patient&#x27;s mouth. I
        mean it&#x27;s not really a sentence, but that&#x27;s my point. Given
        that cycle on the 3x3x3 I would have to fight through seeing the air
        hockey table, with the borg and the dentist and a cup of coffee. Maybe
        something like &quot;AH! BORG DENTISTS drink COFFEE.&quot; And I would
        use each word from my letter pairs as a word in the sentence? I mean
        I&#x27;m just guessing here, does that seem like it would work? I kind
        of like the Major/letter pair hybrid idea. I might give that a shot,
        that sounds really interesting. It&#x27;s sort of like using language
        memory rather than images. Though I could picture a borg drone in a
        white doctor&#x27;s coat with a cup of coffee in his hand. The
        &quot;AH!&quot; would just be remember verbally. Wow, ok I really want
        to try this now, I&#x27;ll write back on how it goes. Chris --- In

        Hey Marcus, and all, I just tried doing a solve with the major method
        and also letter pairs. Here is what I had: I got the solve in 3:55.46
        successfully. The cycles I had were: Edges: (UB UF DB UL) (UR DF FL DL
        BL BR FR) Corners: (UBR UFR DBL UFL DFR DBR) And the orientations I did
        by rote memory at the end, so that part is not really interesting. My
        letters given those cycles are: Edges: (JILE)(FKCGABD) Corners: (NPQOTR)
        The words are: Edges: (Jitters Leopard) (Fork Cog Abacus Johnny Depp)
        Corners: (North Pole GO (game) Bear Trap) and the sentences: Edges:
        JITTERS (nickname of a friend from high school) is riding a LEOPARD.
        Stick a FORK in a COG and you get an ABACUS, says JOHNNY DEPP. Corners:
        When in the NORTH POLE don&#x27;t play GO near BEAR TRAPS. The sentences
        are longer, which maybe is to my disadvantage, but the words are all one
        unit. North Pole is NP to me, I don&#x27;t have to remember which part
        of the phrase goes with which letters. So even though the sentences are
        longer, I can decode the phrases very quickly. I don&#x27;t like that
        the sentences are so long, but maybe it could be worth it. I&#x27;ll try
        this some more. Marcus, what would your Major sentence be here? I&#x27;m
        just curious of other ways to combine the letters. Chris

        I advise against using vowels in the Major system. The whole strength
        behind it is stripping vowels from sentences and using the remaining
        letters as your guide, kind of like words on license plates, if you
        will. I may change my system a bit because sometimes I still get funky
        combinations that don&#x27;t really work well, but in your case:
        Corners: (UBR UFR DBL UFL DFR DBR) Becomes Corners: (Begin l d n s r)
        When I see this I see &quot;Load Noser&quot; or &quot;Laden Sir&quot; or
        &quot;Lead No Sore&quot; etc. Any of these, when stripping away the
        vowels, leaves the relevant letters behind. You don&#x27;t really have
        to account for Corner 1 in the memory hook unless it is already solved,
        in which case you can just remember this rotely because it isn&#x27;t
        hard to do. --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hey Marcus, thanks about the solve, I&#x27;m glad to finally have met a
        long term goal! Also thanks for the inspiration with your crazy fast
        times! As far as the time I take to apply the cycles I did a stop start
        solve to find out, because I didn&#x27;t know off the top of my head. I
        memorized just the centers on a scrambled cube, then solved just them. I
        also did the same for the edges on a different scramble (so that I would
        be memorizing on a scrambled cube to mimic the regular way). Here were
        the scrambles and the times: Centers: b2 F2 D&#x27; d2 F&#x27; f l2 B D
        b F&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; u b2 D2 b2 F2 U B b r f l R U L F&#x27; R2 r U
        L u D L d2 L2 B2 b u Memorize: 1:30-1:35ish Overall time, including
        memorization: 3:06.28 I had 6 cycles to perform in that solve. I did
        just the solve part in roughly 1:30, so I take about 15 seconds to both
        recall and execute each cycle for the centers. And for the edges: r2
        L&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; B2 f d&#x27; D l&#x27; L u2 L&#x27; f&#x27; R
        d&#x27; D F2 r L F2 r b r&#x27; U&#x27; b2 L2 F2 B&#x27; r&#x27; D2
        B&#x27; R r F2 U D&#x27; b2 L2 U2 f&#x27; Memorize: 3:05ish overall
        time, including memorization: 4:50.56 I had 10 cycles to do in that
        solve, including using two 3-cycles to solve a two swap. So I took
        approximately 10.5-11.0 seconds on average to both recall and execute
        each cycle. I don&#x27;t know if that helps much, but that&#x27;s about
        as accurate as I can get in terms of how long I take to do each cycle.
        Of course not all are 15 seconds for centers or 11 for edges. Sometimes
        I might recall almost instantly (less than 1 second) and do the cycle in
        maybe 5-6 seconds. Sometimes it takes me several seconds just to recall
        my image, and other times the cycle is just a hard one to do. But
        average it out I guess and you get 10-15 seconds overall. This is the
        first time I&#x27;ve done this, but the solves felt fairly normal. I was
        solving more slowly and carefully rather than &quot;break neck&quot;
        speed. Hope this helps, Chris --- In

        Wow that is a fast solving time for centers -- for me it&#x27;s usually
        anywhere from 14-20 seconds for a given cycle, but it&#x27;s mainly
        because my cube locks up easily so it works better in the long run to
        solve slowly for the commutators. This is all just my own speculation
        though - - I haven&#x27;t really timed myself for individual cycles or
        anything yet. Recall is usually pretty fast, it&#x27;s just figuring out
        the commutators that take some effort. Edges are a bit easier... I
        don&#x27;t use freestyle commutators but rather arrange them in a
        certain position and perform a cycle alg on them.

        some effort. Yeah I know what you mean. That will speed up over time
        though. Basically I took Tyson and Leyan&#x27;s advice to just always
        setup each position the same way. You sacrifice the tiniest bit of
        efficiency to gain some speed on average. Here is an example. Say I have
        the cycle lbU->dfR->lbD As setup move I would do D2 r2 turning the cycle
        into lbU->dfR->rbU If I had the cycle lbU->dfR->lfD I would still do the
        setup D2 r2, which makes the cycle lbU->dfR->rfU Basically I try to
        always do double turns as setup turns, and only use single turns when I
        am forced to. This way I never have to think about where is the best
        place to put the center from the D layer that I am setting up into the U
        layer, I just always use the double turn setup moves if they are an
        option. So when I run into this type of situation and I see that I have
        to setup a piece from the D layer into the U layer, I look to see if I
        can already make the inner layer turn that places it. If not I try to
        use only double turn setup turns. It&#x27;s just all about doing the
        same situations the same way every time, so that each time you run into
        that situation you can solve it quickly. The setup turns might not be
        the most efficient, but your time taken to setup each situation is
        minimal, because you don&#x27;t have to think to figure out which cycle
        to use, you just act once you know where all three pieces are. I know
        that I used to take double the time I&#x27;m taking now, maybe more,
        especially on the edges. Over time though, you notice you&#x27;re always
        solving the same situations the same way, so each time you see that
        situation again, you can just confidently move at full speed to solve
        it, and know it will work because you always do it that way for that
        situation. Just my thoughts, but yeah that will speed up with practice.

        rather > arrange them in a certain position and perform a cycle alg on

        for the centers. This is because you&#x27;re most likely to use outer
        face turns, whereas for the centers you use inner turns a good bit more
        than for edges. Just food for thought, if you like your method then
        stick with it, but I would highly recommend trying freestyle cycling for
        the edges too, just because it&#x27;s the same idea (even the same types
        of commutators very often), but it goes more smoothly since you can
        usually use more face turns. Chris

        Chris, Congrats on your amazing 4x times, really great. I&#x27;m having
        a hard time keeping up with all your posts ;). I&#x27;m no help on the
        4x since I don&#x27;t do it, but it seems like your images are doing
        great. With the 3x, I found -for me- sticking objects in locations in a
        journey, using major, works pretty well. I started by doing linking in a
        story, but gave that up for my current way. The problem I had/have with
        using images/journeys with the cycles is that you get different amounts
        of images in locations; this makes it hard to recall where cycles end
        and start, at least for me. Corner o&#x27;s are still a pain, always
        looking for a better way. -Dave --- In

        hard to recall where cycles end and start, at least for me. Hey Dave,
        have you tried using special images only for the start and stop of a
        cycle? I have single letter images, which means that they are only ever
        used to show me that it is either the start or finish of a cycle. My
        images are: A: Dan Aykroyd B: Orlando Bloom C: Jim Carrey D: Johnny Depp
        E: Carmen Electra F: Chris Farley G: Tom Green H: Adolf Hitler I: Eddy
        Izzard J: Michael Jordon K: Chris Katan L: Lindsay Lohan M: Dan Marino
        N: Chuck Norris O: Ozzy Osbourne P: Richard Pryor Q: Queen (generic) R:
        Denise Richards S: Will Smith T: Donald Trump U: Uma Thurman V: Jean
        Claude van Damme W: George W. Bush X: Malcolm X Anytime I see one of
        those images I know for a fact that that it is a new cycle boundary. So
        I never have to do any extra work to denote cycle boundaries, I can just
        tell if I see one of my single letter images, I know that a cycle
        boundary has been reached. Here&#x27;s how. At the start of my solve I
        have a single letter image, since I am starting my first cycle. If at
        any point later in the journey I see two single letter images next to
        each other, the only possible way to have that is that my first cycle
        was an odd cycle, and the first single letter image is the end of the
        first cycle. The second single letter image is the beginning of the new
        cycle. If at some point in the journey I only see one single letter
        image, that means the first cycle was an even cycle, and the single
        letter image denotes the start of the next one. I combine all 2 cycles
        into one image, and I remember it&#x27;s a 2-cycle by having the image
        within curtains, sort of like it&#x27;s in a voting booth. So keeping
        that in mind the only possible numbers of conseuctive single letter
        images are just 1 lone one, and 2 consecutive ones. I don&#x27;t know if
        you&#x27;ve already tried this, but I found that it makes
        differentiating multiple cycles on the 4x4x4 edges very easy, especially
        during recall. Hope this helps, Chris

        Typically I don&#x27;t reply to my own posts, but I&#x27;ve had a chance
        to practice the alphabet pair images as applied to edge permutation.
        About 20% of the time I have to consult my image list, other than that
        I&#x27;m somewhat comfortable with its entirety. This system absolutely
        trumps the PAO method as far as I&#x27;m concerned. There is one thing
        I&#x27;m doing and I&#x27;m not sure how &quot;correct&quot; it is. With
        a surprising amount of fluidity I&#x27;m able to group all of a cycle
        into one location by stringing images together. I won&#x27;t be able to
        judge its help to my memorization time until I get completely
        comfortable with the images, but I can already see the faster pace in
        execution. On a seperate issue I&#x27;ve been entertaining different
        ideas for bld relay. After completing my CO method I will always orient
        corners in 2 steps w/ max 2 setup turns (U or D restricted) Somehow I
        want memorization for CO and setup turns to be memorized into images;
        I&#x27;m definitely against memorizing the setup turns as rote memory.
        As far as EO goes, for relay I think I&#x27;d prefer to memorize as
        binary for each cube. With the help of my alphabet pair images I should
        be able to memorize EO in 3 or less images per cube. If I expanded on
        the alphabet pair images a bit I could always memorize EO in 2 or less
        images, but I don&#x27;t want to bite off more than I can chew. I think
        that each step should be memorized for all cubes at once. So that you
        would memorize all of EP for x cubes, all of CP for x cubes, and so on.
        This is just my 2 cents but I think it should keep me in the proper
        mindset all throughout a distinct portion of solving. --- Richard

        As far as relays are concerned, I think it is easier to memorize all
        steps for one cube before moving onto the next. Ie. one thing you can do
        is memorize CP EO EP for cube1, then cube2, etc, then at the end
        memorize CO, and then don a blindfold and fix CO on all the cubes to get
        it out of the way since it&#x27;s the most rote. The problem with
        splitting memorization is that it&#x27;s real easy to forget which
        memory hooks went with which cube. --- In

      <strong>791. Memorizing 4x4 or 5x5 center pieces</strong><br />

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve found one problem with using images to memorize
        the centers, and that is that I often have no clue which pieces
        I&#x27;ve already cycled to on any given face. I remember Stefan saying
        that he had also had some trouble with this on the 5x5x5. With my linked
        lists method, this was not a problem at all, because each face was split
        up into categories, and I would just search my story for the most recent
        element of that category. For the images though this doesn&#x27;t seem
        to work. If I am searching to see if I&#x27;ve used &quot;F&quot;
        already, I have 46 possible ways I could have used it. Either F can
        start the pair F_ or it can end it _F. Anyway I have found a solution
        that I like, and Stefan forgive me if this is something you already do,
        but here was my idea. What I do is to hold the cube at all times with 5
        fingers only. I always just mentally remember which piece I have to
        cycle to next on the U face. I then use my right hand ring finger placed
        on the last place I&#x27;ve cycled to on the D face. I use my right hand
        thumb to hold the sticker of the last place I&#x27;ve cycled to on F. I
        use my right hand index or middle finger to hold the place I&#x27;ve
        last cycled to on R. For the L face I use my left thumb to hold the last
        place I&#x27;ve cycled to. For the B face I use my left hand index or
        middle finger. It is sometimes awkward to hold the cube this way, but it
        helps so incredibly much for remembering which piece comes up next on
        each face. I imagine it looks weird to do it also, but it is effective.
        I&#x27;ve had fewer DNFs since I started using this for the 4x4 and 5x5,
        and I plan on using it in the future. I don&#x27;t know if this is
        something that you 4x4ers and 5x5ers have already figured out. This
        problem was new to me because using linked lists completely eliminated
        it for me. Now that I don&#x27;t have that luxury though, I need a
        better way and I like this one so far. I don&#x27;t mean to be redundant
        if this has already been mentioned, I just couldn&#x27;t remember if it
        was. Happy BLD&#x27;ing, Chris

        If you use PAO for the centers it becomes pretty easy to memorize them.
        Near the beginning of memorization obviously your pieces are going to be
        near the &quot;top,&quot; and near the end, near the &quot;bottom.&quot;
        If you&#x27;re unclear what piece you&#x27;re now on (say, is the next
        white piece in this cycle L2 or L3?) look at each piece and its
        respective AO counterparts and quickly think, &quot;Have I used this
        already?&quot; ie. if L2 is associated with Peanut Butter or Pound, and
        you know you have a memory hook of James Dean Licking Peanut Butter,
        then it must be L3. Does this make sense? --- In

        Mr.Chris, first of all one should improve his/her memory to remember all
        the suggestions and ideas you are posting! Eventhough, i am not getting
        time to practice big cubes BLD nowadays, i am seriously noting all your
        points. J.bernett Orlando cmhardw &lt;foozman17@...> wrote: Hey
        everyone, I&#x27;ve found one problem with using images to memorize the
        centers, and that is that I often have no clue which pieces I&#x27;ve
        already cycled to on any given face. I remember Stefan saying that he
        had also had some trouble with this on the 5x5x5. With my linked lists
        method, this was not a problem at all, because each face was split up
        into categories, and I would just search my story for the most recent
        element of that category. For the images though this doesn&#x27;t seem
        to work. If I am searching to see if I&#x27;ve used &quot;F&quot;
        already, I have 46 possible ways I could have used it. Either F can
        start the pair F_ or it can end it _F. Anyway I have found a solution
        that I like, and Stefan forgive me if this is something you already do,
        but here was my idea. What I do is to hold the cube at all times with 5
        fingers only. I always just mentally remember which piece I have to
        cycle to next on the U face. I then use my right hand ring finger placed
        on the last place I&#x27;ve cycled to on the D face. I use my right hand
        thumb to hold the sticker of the last place I&#x27;ve cycled to on F. I
        use my right hand index or middle finger to hold the place I&#x27;ve
        last cycled to on R. For the L face I use my left thumb to hold the last
        place I&#x27;ve cycled to. For the B face I use my left hand index or
        middle finger. It is sometimes awkward to hold the cube this way, but it
        helps so incredibly much for remembering which piece comes up next on
        each face. I imagine it looks weird to do it also, but it is effective.
        I&#x27;ve had fewer DNFs since I started using this for the 4x4 and 5x5,
        and I plan on using it in the future. I don&#x27;t know if this is
        something that you 4x4ers and 5x5ers have already figured out. This
        problem was new to me because using linked lists completely eliminated
        it for me. Now that I don&#x27;t have that luxury though, I need a
        better way and I like this one so far. I don&#x27;t mean to be redundant
        if this has already been mentioned, I just couldn&#x27;t remember if it
        was. Happy BLD&#x27;ing, Chris --------------------------------- Yahoo!

        Hey everyone, For anyone interested here is my complete image list. I
        had originally used 580 images, which was made up of 24*23=552 letter
        pairs plus 24 single letter images, and then also plus 4 double letter
        pairs. I found a way to handle the situations where I had used the
        double pair images without using double letter pairs. So the final count
        is 576 total. http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/memorizing.html I&#x27;m
        going to add to this page to describe a little bit how I use those
        images, but for now there is the list at least. Chris

      <strong>795. memorizing center blocks using images</strong><br />

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I finally tried using center blocks on a 4x4x4 BLD solve
        using these images. What I do to remember that it is a center block
        cycle is that at the end of the center cycles I have at my next location
        a particular image to let me know what follows is a center block. The
        image I use is the cartoon character of &quot;Rubik, the amazing
        cube&quot;. Then what follows are the images that show which letter
        blocks I need to move. I letter the blocks in this pattern: lbU+rbU: A
        lbU+lfU: B rbU+rfU: C lfU+rfU: D and I follow the same pattern on the
        other 6 faces. Anyway, the reason center blocks are so nice, is that in
        terms of moves needed per center piece solved it is actually better to
        create center blocks than to cycle the pieces individually if the blocks
        are mostly built. The reason I am posting, is that I just did my first
        4x4x4 BLD solve using center blocks with images, and I got it
        successfully in 9:14.15, my new PB solve!! I think using center blocks
        will be what helps me get sub-9 minutes for a single solve. I can easily
        see how having a nice center block potential for them, and easy corners
        could get me there. So anyway, I&#x27;m excited to be moving closer to
        sub-8 (my new goal for a PB solve). For anyone considering using PAO or
        letter pair images for the edges, I think it would be worth it to find a
        way to memorize center blocks. This is because in terms of the solving
        phase, center blocks give a better ratio of number of moves per piece
        solved. Anyway, I&#x27;m really excited to be improving my memorizing,
        and adapting it to the freestyle cycling method. I&#x27;ll post my
        method on that page that lists my images soon, for anyone interested.
        I&#x27;ll try to show how I memorize, rather than the solving part,
        since I&#x27;ve already done a tutorial on the rubiks.has.it forum for
        solving. I may combine it all onto one page, sort of as a big cubes BLD
        how to for freestyle cycling and letter pair memorizing. Anyway, I just
        wanted to post, because I felt using center blocks are important enough
        to try to include in any method, just because it is such a powerful
        trick to use. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, and are interested in the
        bigger cubes BLD, I really recommend it! Happy BLD&#x27;ing all, Chris

        Hi :-) Please note that flip refers to edge orientation. When flipping a
        coin it has only 2 sides of course ;-) (not counting the edge of the
        coin as a side ...) Twisting refers to orientation of corners or middle
        centers of odd-sized (nxnxn) cubes. I put ACube on the job to find a
        short alg. It came up with heaps of them, where this was one of the

        R&#x27; B2 U D It seemed that all algs that were short involved turning

        I remember a lot of the multiple corner flip algs responded really well
        to ACube using RUF searches. I don&#x27;t have ACube on my computer, but
        I&#x27;ll run a search tonight and see if I can find a good one. To do

        Caught a nice 3x3x3 blindfold solve this morning -- it was slightly
        easier than most solves because the CO was really nice (only 3 corners

        Hey Marcus, Wow that was cool! Congrats on the awesome time on that
        solve! Your memorization was very fast, dude keep it up! You&#x27;re an
        inspiration, I&#x27;ve got an idea I want to try for memorizing the
        3x3x3, I&#x27;ll try to post if it works. Awesome stuff man! You&#x27;re
        a big inspiration to me, I wish I could memorize that well! I&#x27;m
        working on it, but that is very cool, I&#x27;m impressed! Happy cubing,

        Thanks for the kind words. Bad CO though vs. good CO seems to be a huge
        issue though. Bad CO not only means the memorization takes longer but so
        does the execution. I&#x27;m tinkering around with another approach - -
        I&#x27;ll let you know how it goes. I think the eventual goal of
        blindfoldcubing should be to get the cube down to a very specific
        memorized process that involves 0 on-the-fly creativity and risktaking
        in memory (I use on-the-fly memory hooks for CO and EP -- no set method
        of memorizing other than shapes). I&#x27;m wondering if PAO for EP is
        the best way to go. What do you think?

        Hey Marcus, I have been working on something that Richard Patterson
        recommended to me. I had been using 132 images for the pieces and also
        journeys, but I only put 3 images in each location. Richard is learning
        the images to also use 132 images for memorizing, and he recommended to
        me to put all the images for corners or edges in one journey location.
        I&#x27;ve recently been doing that with some improvement from what I was
        using before with 3 images per location. As for my initial thoughts, the
        execution time when I place all the images in one location is phenomenal
        (for me). I can recall so much more quickly than just &quot;shapes of
        cycles&quot;, or my old method, or at last it feels to me like it is
        faster. Since my entire edges cycle (or corners) is one panoramic vision
        in my mind at my journey location, I can effectively see every cycle I
        have to do at the same time, and there is almost no delay from one cycle
        to the next. However, memorization is still slow for me compared to my
        old way. I think with more practice that I will be able to speed it up.
        I just now got a solve successfully in 2:35.48 including the
        memorization using all my images in one location for corners and another
        for edges. Also using this method makes it so easy to do multiple solves
        in a row. This solve was actually my 6th solve in a row, and I feel like
        I could do 6-10 more no problem. I&#x27;m going to try some more solves
        right now and try to get sub-2 using images. I want to give full credit
        to Richard for me trying this, since I had previously only used 3 images
        per location, but I think for 3x3x3 that having this panorama of images
        would be much faster. I think these images could be fast. Once I speed
        up the memorization to equal my old way I think I can get faster with
        this method than I was with &quot;shapes of cycles&quot;. This is
        because I can see the entire edges or corners cycle in my panoramic view
        of all the cycles at once, rather than having to recall them much more
        sequentially as with &quot;shapes of cycles&quot;. I hope this will be
        faster for me, but I think it will take a long time to speed up my
        memorization this way. Still I&#x27;ll try to post on how it&#x27;s
        going if things get better. Chris --- In

        Hey everyone, I set a new personal best for solving the 5x5x5 BLD

        minutes. I was using my 576 image system, and I placed 3 images at each
        journey location. I know for a fact that a sub-20 minute solve will be
        possible. I still don&#x27;t know the limits of doing this in a

        Hey Chris, Congrats!!! That is an amazing time. Sure kicks the crap out
        of that 25, ne? You know all 576 images well enough already?!
        That&#x27;s pretty sick, man. Loud music can definitely help, though. Do
        you prefer fast or slower music? I find that the really crazy-fast loud
        stuff can really get things pumping. I&#x27;m glad to hear it was an
        inspiration, but keep in mind your webpage was one of the first things I
        saw that was related to the cube, haha. I think the credit goes to you,
        man. Freestyle commutators still give me some issues sometimes (not
        FULLY used to them yet... the hardest part is moving a piece to where it
        needs to go without disturbing the slice involved or messing up the
        other piece&#x27;s position without realizing it), but I think
        they&#x27;re the fastest way to go once you get used to them. And yes
        sub-20 is possible. I&#x27;m not so sure about sub-10 though unless the
        cube was exceptionally easy to turn and manipulate. Personally my
        weakness is the physical speed -- although I think I just need to add a
        lot more lube to the 5x5x5 (little pieces here and there want to pop out
        sometimes, and layers like to lock). Anyways it is great to see how
        quickly you&#x27;re improving your times! It&#x27;s very exciting...
        keep us posted on the progress! -Marcus

        heh no I do it so it won&#x27;t be silent when I&#x27;m solving. I used
        to practice in silence, and then at the Chattahoochee competition I was
        completely unprepared for all the noise when I was memorizing, and had a
        hard time concentrating. Now I make sure it&#x27;s never quiet so that
        the noise becomes my comfort zone, and I am always used to having to
        drown out something. Maybe music isn&#x27;t the best idea, but I try to
        always have at least something. Sometimes I leave the TV on really loud,
        and sometimes I let my alarm clock go off during the whole solve, just
        so long as there is noise somehow. Chris

        Sorry :-). But you can still be the first &quot;real&quot; square1
        blindsolver. I did take the first scramble Jaap&#x27;s scrambler

        not trying the ones before) but it just happened to be easy. And though
        I might be able to do it with harder scrambles, it would be *a lot*
        harder and I probably wouldn&#x27;t want to do it. Not the way I did it
        this time, at least. Which I described a bit here:
        http://s12.invisionfree.com/rubiks/index.php?showtopic=323 The square1
        is completely different from most other puzzles in this aspect.
        Different 3x3 states have slightly different difficulty, but different
        square1 states can have veeery different difficulties, at least with the
        &quot;method&quot; I used this time. I&#x27;d call a &quot;real&quot;
        square1 blindsolver someone who can do it easily from every possible

        Since I do not have an A drive on this computer, I will merely give some
        of the ideas about the method. I&#x27;ve just recently started
        blindfolded solves. I used Pochmann&#x27;s Method. I came to realize
        that his method takes way to many moves. If you can isolate a Buffer
        area and place an edge at a time, then find another buffer area to work
        around the corners with, why can&#x27;t you solve them simultaneously?
        Perks: 4 New Algs, kick ass setups, no parity, having to switch back the
        corners on an odd number edge solve 8 Less algs to perform on average No
        Corner Orienation Required After Corner Permutation, can solve the rest
        of the edges as you would in Pochmann&#x27;s method When I get the
        chance I will upload the file. Everything is explained, such as why is
        there no parity? Which alg to perform and where. This new concept of
        solving &quot;2x2x1&quot;s I&#x27;m going to try to get to a different
        computer to load the files!

        gimme the weekend. I&#x27;ll be back on Monday w/ the final details I
        just finished this method. I have been trying different things, it
        wasn&#x27;t until yesterday that I realized the simplification making
        the buffer area so compact. So I&#x27;m gonna learn the algs this
        weekend, apply them to a method. And make a few examples. By the way,
        when I post an example it will be added to the file, not posted here.
        And being new, I still need to perfect my own memorization method.

        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been working on 4x4x4 BLD again, and as I am
        getting more and more familiar with these images I am starting to find
        that I can memorize much more quickly and still be able to remember
        everything afterward. I just got my new pb solve for the 4x4x4 BLD
        again, with an overall time of 8:35.38 minutes. I memorized in 4:08.xx
        and I know that soon I&#x27;ll be able to memorize in sub-4 minutes.
        Marcus, I remember you saying that your record was sub-8? How far under
        8 minutes were you? I think I can get to 7:30 in a reasonable amount of
        time (maybe 2-3 weeks?) with more practice at memorizing quickly, and I
        think that one day a sub-7 solve will be possible. I have been
        practicing recalling my images every day as fast as I can. So far it
        takes me about 40 minutes to recall all 576 images, which works out to 4
        seconds per image on average, but I think I can half that the more I
        practice. Anyway, I am very excited about how awesome it is to memorize
        with these images, and I can easily see getting under 8 minutes on the
        4x4 once I can recall them more quickly. I don&#x27;t know if anyone
        else is interested in learning this method, but I have it detailed on my
        page here http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/memorizing.html if
        you&#x27;re interested. I hope to be sub-8 very soon, and Marcus watch
        out because I am gunning for your fastest time UWR for 4x4x4 ;-) I
        imagine these times might be hard to believe coming from me especially
        considering I only started getting them very recently. Now that my
        accuracy is back up I plan on catching a sub-10 solve on video, and
        I&#x27;ll send it in to strangepuzzle.com so anyone can see it. So if
        you don&#x27;t believe me, wait a few days and I&#x27;ll try to post the
        link here to the video. Happy BLD&#x27;ing everyone, and I&#x27;ll try
        to post back as soon as I have a successful sub-10 on tape. Chris

        Hehe I&#x27;m a little faster on the 4x4x4 than what I last said (my
        method for memorizing the centers is quicker) and I now use freestyle
        commutators (used to use this ugly algorithm for swapping). I might get
        a 4x4x4 video for you soon, but maybe not because I currently lack a
        4x4x4 cube. Would you like a 5x5x5 video perhaps? I have that cube, at

        I like that &quot;I am not bashing your method!&quot; assurance :-) I
        know you&#x27;re not and I&#x27;m happy to see someone come up with
        something new. I might&#x27;ve thought about the general idea before but
        not really deeply. I really like my method for being so braindead and am
        afraid of having to setup more than one piece. But good observation that
        edge setups in two inner slices are so easy! Cheers! Stefan

        I just generated some very nice algs during last nights storm. The
        drawback to these optimal E flip and M flip algs is that they target the
        L face of the DFL rather than D. While the E Block and M Block still
        target the D face. It may be your preference to learn the original 4
        algs. I&#x27;m using the last 4 algs. Stephan! I&#x27;ve talked to Craig
        Bouchard, he said you guys had been working on an advanced method.
        Thanks for looking at it too. I understand, I&#x27;m getting faster at
        your method because it&#x27;s so easy. It is rather brain dead. If I
        could get memorization down in like two looks I&#x27;d be pretty fast,
        right now using visual memorization w/ your method, I&#x27;m having to
        go through everything several times, just wasting a lot of valuable
        time.

        Haha, never considered that. I figured I&#x27;d use 4 algs, but
        that&#x27;s a great idea. Thanks Stephan. I&#x27;ll work on it then.
        This optimizes setups to 2 face turns, one for the edge, and one for the
        corner. I&#x27;m still tinkering with the method. Once I generate all 12
        algs, I&#x27;m going to reorganize the file.

      <div class="email-content">
        Hi everyone, I have a question about mental endurance: How do I force
        myself to focus over a long mental endurance trial? I just tried the
        most taxing ever endurance test for the big cubes BLD that I&#x27;ve
        ever done. I did 3 BLD solves for the 4x4x4 literally all in a row,
        taking no more than the time necessary to scramble the cube again as
        rest between solves. I then took a 2 hour break to watch a movie, and
        after that I did the exact same thing on the 5x5x5, trying 3 BLD solves
        in a row and only resting as long as it took me to scramble the cube
        again before I started the next solve. Well, I DNF&#x27;d 2 of the 4x4
        solves and all 3 of the 5x5 solves :.-( All of the DNF&#x27;s were off
        by relatively few pieces, 2-3 on average, with one 5x5 off by 6 centers,
        and one 5x5 with 12 pieces unsolved. On the first 4x4 solve I found it
        very easy to memorize, and it got progressively harder with each solve.
        This wasn&#x27;t because of interference or anything, I have more
        journey locations than I think I could even do BLD solves in a day. It
        was simply hard to keep memorizing, it&#x27;s like whatever part of my
        brain actually does the memorization gets tired and makes really stupid,
        and simple mistakes after a number of cubes in a row. On the 2nd and 3rd
        5x5 solves I was making incredibly stupid errors during memorization,
        such as assuming an orange piece cycled to the D or U face, when for me
        orange is *always* the R face, no matter what size cube I am solving.
        That&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve done since 2003 :-S I even had to delete
        and rememorize 2 journey locations on the 2nd 5x5 solve because of this.
        That&#x27;s like trying to tie my shoes onto my hands lol, it&#x27;s
        that basic of an error, but for some reason it just made perfect sense
        to me at the time that those orange centers belonged on D and U lol. I
        had a huge number of stupid errors during the solving portion of the 3rd
        5x5x5 solve, and only ended up with the centers solved, and at least 3
        pieces in each of the other orbits off. How can I keep my focus over a
        large number of solves? I&#x27;m not really interested in doing or
        trying a relay event right now, where I memorize and solve lots of cubes
        in one single attempt, though I think those events are amazing! I&#x27;m
        more interested in how I could retain my focus to try up to 5-6 5x5x5
        BLD solves in a row with no rest at all in between other than the time
        taken to scramble the cube again. How do you relay people keep your
        focus over such a long attempt? Also, Stefan and Dave and others how do
        you guys keep your focus for a multiple 3x3x3 cubes attempt? Tyson and
        Leyan and the 3x3x3 average guys, how do you do 12 solves in a row with
        such high accuracy and keep your focus? I think techniques for keeping
        your focus would be a pretty universal thing, and would be the same
        whether you are trying a relay event or lots of cubes in a row in a
        relay or 3x3 BLD or 4x4 or 5x5 BLD average. I&#x27;m just looking for
        some way to improve my focus. My thoughts right now are to keep forcing
        myself to do these endurance tests of 6 big cubes or more all done in a
        4 hour or so period until I finally just get used to doing it and my
        accuracy goes up. But are there deep breathing exercises or a slower or
        faster mental speed to try to move at, or anything else that would help
        make this easier? Thanks for any help/tips, this problem is really
        frustrating me. Chris

        my longest was 67 minutes (4 cubes in Leipzig) so no wonder I have no
        endurance problem there. My 5x5, Super 5x5 and Megaminx took much
        longer, but then again that was just because I was terribly slow, which
        doesn&#x27;t exactly show/need good endurance. Maybe you should ask the
        memorizers instead, their competitions require quite some endurance of
        this type. Cheers! Stefan

        well tried Chris! Here is my experience. 1).A strong desire to complete.
        2).A strong will to achieve. 3).Emphasise perfection. You have the first
        2. The third one is real endurance. A sound sleep before the long mental
        endurance trial will help you in focusing.If you want to make your tries
        error free, check your memorisation and verify the pieces physically if
        what you have memorised is correct. This will be a real endurance. But
        the joy of perfect solves will nullify the effect. This checking of your
        memorisation physically will take more time than the first time
        memorisation. In 2003, I memorised 3600 binary digits in 1 hr 12 min.
        But, I memorised all the 3600 binary digits in 25 odd min and it took 46
        odd min to verify what I memorised was correct or not. Had I not
        revised, the recall would not have been perfect and the penalty for the
        mistakes is very heavy as you know. Similarly, I memorised 20 packs of
        cards and recalled them all without a single mistake because I
        physically verified what I memorised is correct which took much longer
        than that of first time memorisation. It will be a chance for you to
        understand why few things are missing or not clear or not strong enough
        or very vague etc. But, after few trials like this, when you realise
        your memorisation is perfect, you can avoid checking them physically.
        So, in my opinion, memorising and solving several cubes one after the
        other is not long mental endurance. It is almost same as writting an
        examination for 3 hours trying to recall the answers for each and every
        question. Solving them perfectly is real endurance or as you said relay
        will be long mental endurance. Hope I am not discouraging you!! John

        about mental endurance: How do I force myself to focus over a long

        for the big cubes BLD that I&#x27;ve ever done. I did 3 BLD solves for
        the 4x4x4 literally all in a row, taking no more than the time necessary
        to scramble the cube again as rest between solves. I then took a 2 hour
        break to watch a movie, and after that I did the exact same thing on the
        5x5x5, trying 3 BLD solves in a row and only resting as long as it took
        me to scramble the cube again before I started the next solve. Well, I
        DNF&#x27;d 2 of the 4x4 solves and all 3 of the 5x5 solves :.-( All of
        the DNF&#x27;s were off by relatively few pieces, 2-3 on average, with
        one 5x5 off by 6 centers, and one 5x5 with 12 pieces unsolved. On the
        first 4x4 solve I found it very easy to memorize, and it got
        progressively harder with each solve. This wasn&#x27;t because of
        interference or anything, I have more journey locations than I think I
        could even do BLD solves in a day. It was simply hard to keep
        memorizing, it&#x27;s like whatever part of my brain actually does the
        memorization gets tired and makes really stupid, and simple mistakes
        after a number of cubes in a row. On the 2nd and 3rd 5x5 solves I was
        making incredibly stupid errors during memorization, such as assuming an
        orange piece cycled to the D or U face, when for me orange is *always*
        the R face, no matter what size cube I am solving. That&#x27;s something
        I&#x27;ve done since 2003 :-S I even had to delete and rememorize 2
        journey locations on the 2nd 5x5 solve because of this. That&#x27;s like
        trying to tie my shoes onto my hands lol, it&#x27;s that basic of an
        error, but for some reason it just made perfect sense to me at the time
        that those orange centers belonged on D and U lol. I had a huge number
        of stupid errors during the solving portion of the 3rd 5x5x5 solve, and
        only ended up with the centers solved, and at least 3 pieces in each of
        the other orbits off. How can I keep my focus over a large number of
        solves? I&#x27;m not really interested in doing or trying a relay event
        right now, where I memorize and solve lots of cubes in one single
        attempt, though I think those events are amazing! I&#x27;m more
        interested in how I could retain my focus to try up to 5-6 5x5x5 BLD
        solves in a row with no rest at all in between other than the time taken
        to scramble the cube again. How do you relay people keep your focus over
        such a long attempt? Also, Stefan and Dave and others how do you guys
        keep your focus for a multiple 3x3x3 cubes attempt? Tyson and Leyan and
        the 3x3x3 average guys, how do you do 12 solves in a row with such high
        accuracy and keep your focus? I think techniques for keeping your focus
        would be a pretty universal thing, and would be the same whether you are
        trying a relay event or lots of cubes in a row in a relay or 3x3 BLD or
        4x4 or 5x5 BLD average. I&#x27;m just looking for some way to improve my
        focus. My thoughts right now are to keep forcing myself to do these
        endurance tests of 6 big cubes or more all done in a 4 hour or so period
        until I finally just get used to doing it and my accuracy goes up. But
        are there deep breathing exercises or a slower or faster mental speed to
        try to move at, or anything else that would help make this easier?
        Thanks for any help/tips, this problem is really frustrating me. Chris

        1).A good deep breathing excercise before any mental event is helpful as
        oxygen is the fuel for the brain and it refreshes the brain. 2).Any
        mental excercise which co-ordinate the left and right brain, say balls
        juggling, is also very good just before any mental event. Many world
        class memorisers do that just before mental marathan events. 3).Eating

        Hey guys, Thanks for the advice of things to try to work on mental
        focus, I think I have already narrowed down the problem of my accuracy,
        and that is that I try to never revise when I am going quickly. This
        usually means that my first few solves are successful and done in fairly
        quick times, but after I keep going I seem to pretty much DNF every cube
        after that if I continue to not revise. As to the reason I am doing all
        these solves like this, I have two. Since I started using journeys to
        memorize cubes I found it was easier to do multiple cubes in a row, and
        that made me curious as to my limit. I just want to know how many I can
        do before I just completely lose the will to try another solve, or my
        brain just gets tired and I make too many mistakes. The other reason is
        to train for a competition. I know at US nationals I will be able to do
        the 5x5 and 4x4 BLD on separate days, but that is only because it is a
        three day event. Normally you have to do two solves on the 4x4 and two
        solves on the 5x5 in the same day. I&#x27;d like to get to the point
        where I can do many more than that in the same day, so that doing 4
        solves does not feel like a big endurance event to me, and it certainly
        did in Georgia when I tried it for the first time. I&#x27;d say right
        now I&#x27;m mostly just curious how long I can go before I have to
        stop. I have enough journey locations to theoretically do 17 5x5x5 BLD
        solves all in a row, but I seriously doubt that right now I can sustain
        the will to do that, or sustain my focus to even attempt it. Right now
        I&#x27;d be ecstatic just to say I could do 5-6 in a row, even if some
        of them are DNF. I think a better test though, the more I think about
        it, is to see how many consecutive cubes I can do successfully and
        ignore the time taken. I do want to work up to the real relay one day
        (2x2-5x5 1 attempt), but for now I just want to be able to do
        consecutive single solves and not make such weird mental errors. I still
        cannot believe it made perfect sense to me to cycle an orange sticker to
        the wrong face after 4-5 solves. It&#x27;s like whatever part of my
        brain handles memory just went delirious for a few seconds until I was
        able to realize exactly what I was doing. I can definitely see the
        reason for revising now, especially after seeing what happens if I
        don&#x27;t revise. I agree though, a few single solve cubes done in a
        row doesn&#x27;t constitute a memory endurance event if you take into
        account the insane things that people have done with cards or binary
        digits, or most simultaneous chess games played BLD, etc.. However, it
        is a very big endurance test for me :-( That does motivate me, though,
        to work harder to make it not feel so hard to do. Chris --- In

        Hey Stefan, No I definitely consider your 5x5 and super 5x5, and
        megaminx especially, to be endurance events. Remember my first super4x4
        took me longer than your megaminx solve took you, so you don&#x27;t have
        to keep saying you&#x27;re slow, because I definitely started out slower
        ;-) I did an easier puzzle in longer time than it took you to do a much
        harder puzzle! Even if you just rate them by number of combinations, the
        megaminx still wins by a factor of 10^15. I remember from that 4x4 solve
        though, that I had two distinct moments where I almost lost the will to
        keep going, but was able to force myself to continue. I think if you
        have to battle your will to keep going, then it counts as an endurance
        event. If you didn&#x27;t have a moment like that for megaminx or either
        5x5, then I think it shows you have a super strong will, and can handle
        a long event that most people would consider an endurance test. As to
        the multiple 3x3&#x27;s I personally consider that an endurance event, I
        tried to do 2 in a row and found that my total time was much longer than
        two consecutive single solves, since I had a hard time keeping the
        information from the two cubes straight. Doing 4, in public no less, I
        think is amazing! It seems like just battling your nerves would be
        enough to call that an endurance test. What do you think the limits are
        for an endurance test like this? I&#x27;m sure up to 20-30 cubes could
        be memorized with a good memory technique, but how many could one do and
        still solve all of them? That seems to be a much harder question to
        answer to me. Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        Just a suggestion... In sports psychology, sports people are encouraged
        to produce performances without thinking. eg. A very natural successful
        penalty kick might fail if the person is focusing on actively performing
        the mechanics of the kick but it will work fluidly very often if the
        person does it as a habitual action. For that reason, it may be that the
        best success would come from so much habitual practice that focusing is
        not going to distort the required process. Habitual action would require
        less concentration and would therefore lead to more accuracy in
        endurance events, surely?!! Having said that, the downside, I guess, is
        complacency and cock-suredness taking the place of correct habitual
        processes. Mike

        mental endurance: How do I force myself to focus over a long mental

        the big cubes BLD that I&#x27;ve ever done. I did 3 BLD solves for the
        4x4x4 literally all in a row, taking no more than the time necessary to
        scramble the cube again as rest between solves. I then took a 2 hour
        break to watch a movie, and after that I did the exact same thing on the
        5x5x5, trying 3 BLD solves in a row and only resting as long as it took
        me to scramble the cube again before I started the next solve. Well, I
        DNF&#x27;d 2 of the 4x4 solves and all 3 of the 5x5 solves :.-( All of
        the DNF&#x27;s were off by relatively few pieces, 2-3 on average, with
        one 5x5 off by 6 centers, and one 5x5 with 12 pieces unsolved. On the
        first 4x4 solve I found it very easy to memorize, and it got
        progressively harder with each solve. This wasn&#x27;t because of
        interference or anything, I have more journey locations than I think I
        could even do BLD solves in a day. It was simply hard to keep
        memorizing, it&#x27;s like whatever part of my brain actually does the
        memorization gets tired and makes really stupid, and simple mistakes
        after a number of cubes in a row. On the 2nd and 3rd 5x5 solves I was
        making incredibly stupid errors during memorization, such as assuming an
        orange piece cycled to the D or U face, when for me orange is *always*
        the R face, no matter what size cube I am solving. That&#x27;s something
        I&#x27;ve done since 2003 :-S I even had to delete and rememorize 2
        journey locations on the 2nd 5x5 solve because of this. That&#x27;s like
        trying to tie my shoes onto my hands lol, it&#x27;s that basic of an
        error, but for some reason it just made perfect sense to me at the time
        that those orange centers belonged on D and U lol. I had a huge number
        of stupid errors during the solving portion of the 3rd 5x5x5 solve, and
        only ended up with the centers solved, and at least 3 pieces in each of
        the other orbits off. How can I keep my focus over a large number of
        solves? I&#x27;m not really interested in doing or trying a relay event
        right now, where I memorize and solve lots of cubes in one single
        attempt, though I think those events are amazing! I&#x27;m more
        interested in how I could retain my focus to try up to 5-6 5x5x5 BLD
        solves in a row with no rest at all in between other than the time taken
        to scramble the cube again. How do you relay people keep your focus over
        such a long attempt? Also, Stefan and Dave and others how do you guys
        keep your focus for a multiple 3x3x3 cubes attempt? Tyson and Leyan and
        the 3x3x3 average guys, how do you do 12 solves in a row with such high
        accuracy and keep your focus? I think techniques for keeping your focus
        would be a pretty universal thing, and would be the same whether you are
        trying a relay event or lots of cubes in a row in a relay or 3x3 BLD or
        4x4 or 5x5 BLD average. I&#x27;m just looking for some way to improve my
        focus. My thoughts right now are to keep forcing myself to do these
        endurance tests of 6 big cubes or more all done in a 4 hour or so period
        until I finally just get used to doing it and my accuracy goes up. But
        are there deep breathing exercises or a slower or faster mental speed to
        try to move at, or anything else that would help make this easier?
        Thanks for any help/tips, this problem is really frustrating me. Chris

        Hey everyone, Does anyone have a good alg for swapping just two corners
        and two central most edges on a 5x5x5? The alg is allowed to rotate
        center groups, and it&#x27;s ok for the it to perform small cycles of
        centers around on their respective faces, as long as no center piece is
        moved to a new face. The alg I am using right now is: R U R&#x27;
        U&#x27; R&#x27; F R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; (Ff)&#x27;
        x&#x27; L&#x27; F U&#x27; L F&#x27; d u F L&#x27; U F&#x27; L u&#x27; x
        Is there a more speedsolve friendly way to do this? I&#x27;m keeping
        Stefan&#x27;s 4x4 PLL parity alg in mind when I say that, something like
        his (Uu)2 (Rr)2 U2 r2 U2 (Rr)2 (Uu)2, but for this situation on the
        5x5x5. It doesn&#x27;t have to use the T perm, the N perm or the J perm
        would be good too, even the F wouldn&#x27;t be bad. Even if the pieces
        are scattered around the cube, actually that wouldn&#x27;t be bad
        either, as long as it switches two corners and two central most edges.
        My only thoughts on how to do this are to use a PLL alg from the 3x3x3
        that does this, and then fix the wing edges that get messed up in the
        process. Is there a more direct approach? Also, is there an ACube 5x5? I
        didn&#x27;t think there was any program like that, but I thought I would
        ask to make sure. Thanks, Chris

        Chris, don&#x27;t you have Windows movie maker? if you have, just open
        it, import the video, and click &quot;save in computer&quot; (or
        something like that). then, you select the file size, and can see at the
        bottom how the quality is affected...after, just watch it and see if the
        quality is good...it should make the file a lot smaller... Pedro cmhardw

        Hey everyone, Let&#x27;s see if this works, this is the first time
        I&#x27;ve used rapidshare:
        http://rapidshare.de/files/26595543/4x4BLD.wmv.html I compressed the
        video a little bit, down to 19 MB in order to keep most of the original
        quality. I also have a version Doug Li compressed for me at about 18MB
        that loses a little bit of quality, not much, in case this file is too
        huge to deal with. Anyway, when Chris gets back I&#x27;ll try to see if
        I can add the video to strangepuzzle, but for now here it is if anyone
        is interested. I memorized in about 3:54.xx and solved in the rest, with
        a total time of 9:40.70. Chris

        haven&#x27;t used rapidshare before so I&#x27;m still learning how to
        get things to work correctly there. Heh heh I just wanted to really
        prove that I had my eyes closed while scrambling. Also before I
        scrambled on camera I had applied a 40 move scramble from Jaap&#x27;s
        page to make sure it wasn&#x27;t entirely a hand scramble, since those
        for me tend to leave really nice and easy center blocks. As for the long
        delay, I had forgotten a journey location. I had purposefully gone very,
        very fast during memorization, which is the only way I can get a sub-10.
        I had fairly good recall on everything except for one location, which
        was: A giant Locust(LC) is standing next to a guy in a tuxedo(UX) and
        the guy grabs a giant cigarette(NI-for nicotine) and stabs it into the
        locust so it won&#x27;t come after him. All I could remember at first
        was the locust or LC, so before the pause I do the cycle Q->L->C which
        is UBl->DBr->uFL and the alg I used for that was: r2 B&#x27; u2 B U2
        B&#x27; u2 B U2 r2 To remember the rest of that location I was going
        through the locations I had already solved, and the future locations to
        find which letters would not be used. I then found I had the letters
        I-N-U-X leftover, and from there I immediately remembered the guy in the
        tuxedo from the U and the X. You can see me actually tap the dBL(U) and
        dFR(X) pieces as I remember, and that left either IN(Intel blue guys) or
        NI(nicotine) and that&#x27;s when I remembered the cigarette and the
        rest of that location. In a competition, unless I already had a
        successful solve on the first try, there&#x27;s no way I would memorize
        that quickly since I tend to DNF much more often when I go that fast. I
        just wanted to prove, on video, that sub-10 was really possible. However
        I admit that at home and with a camera I have the luxury of being able
        to film again if I DNF, but in a competition I would solve much more
        carefully and slowly, unless I already had one good solve under my belt.

      <strong>855. How to skip a cycle and come back</strong><br />

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been thinking about the problem of forgetting a
        cycle in the middle of a longer solve. This could happen on any size
        cube, assuming you are using the orient first and 3-cycles method. For
        Stefan&#x27;s approach this could be forgetting one single piece, or
        maybe 2 pieces in succession. This idea is probably more relevant to the
        bigger cubes, but I wanted to post since it still does relate to the
        3x3, in case anyone is interested. I&#x27;ve had solves on the 4x4 and
        5x5 where I forgot only one single image, or as in my 4x4x4 BLD video
        for about 40 seconds I forgot two successive images. Each image for me
        is a 3 cycle, so I effectively forget only one or two single three
        cycles, but can still perfectly recall everything else. What I usually
        do is to stop and count up all my letters (pieces) and see which are
        unused, and try to rebuild the image I&#x27;ve forgotten. This takes
        time obviously, and I&#x27;ve thought that maybe continuing solving and
        doing this at the same time would be better. I&#x27;ve been working on
        this, and have decided to add this to my method. What it is, is to
        purposefully skip the forgotten cycle, and do everything else, then at
        the end you will have run through all your pieces or in my case letters,
        and can more easily recall which are unused. This is a simple idea, and
        makes sense with just a little thought, but I&#x27;ve started practicing
        it to make it reflex, which I think will be a powerful addition to a
        blindfolded solving method. It works like this, say I have the 24 cycle
        (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) for the edges on a 4x4 or 5x5 cube. Now
        let&#x27;s say I forgot the image DE, or dentist. What I used to do is
        1) freak out, followed by 2) try to go through the other images and add
        up all the letters until I find the ones I haven&#x27;t used, and
        eventually discover that D and E are free, allowing me to remember
        &quot;dentist&quot;. What I say now is to do this: The first three cycle
        is still available, so do the cycle (ABC) leaving
        (ADEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) Of course I don&#x27;t know the upcoming cycle,
        so I would view it as: (A??FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) Now I could take the
        time to go through each image and find that I am missing D and E, but
        this could take up to 40 seconds at least, probably around a minute on
        average. Why waste that time, when I can let the solving do the search
        for me? So I&#x27;ll skip my forgotten cycle and move on to the rest:
        Now I do (AFG) since I know the next image after my forgotten one (here
        the DE image). Looking at the original cycle (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX),
        I have now done (ABC) followed by (AFG) This leaves the original cycle
        in the form (FDE)(AHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) This is because after (ABC) I was
        supposed to send A to D, but I instead sent it to F for the (AFG) cycle.
        This means that the piece now in F goes to D. The piece that is in D
        needs to go to E. And because FG followed DE then the piece in E needed
        to go to F, which leaves me with a simple three cycle to pick up at the
        end. So basically I continue as normal for the rest of the cycle
        (AHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX), and just remember that I have to do the cycle
        (F??) at the end, and the two question marks are the forgotten pieces,
        once I remember them to be DE I fill that cycle in as (FDE). In general,
        if you forget a cycle, move on anyway. Then once you recall the two
        pieces of the forgotten cycle, use the first piece of the next cycle
        after your forgotten one as your first piece in the &quot;pick up&quot;
        cycle and do that 3 cycle to complete the cube. So for images, I forget
        DE. DE was followed by FG so I moved on with (AFG). Then once I remember
        that DE is the forgotten cycle I look to my next image (FG) and take the
        first spot (F) and use it as the first piece of a 3 cycle, followed by
        the forgotten stuff, giving (FDE). Again I don&#x27;t know how useful
        this will be to 3x3x3 BLD, but I can&#x27;t believe I never thought to
        do this for the bigger cubes, and it certainly is going to become my
        main technique for what to do if I forget an image, effectively if I
        forget a cycle. --------- As to my 4x4x4 BLD video mistake, where I
        forgot two successive images for about 40 seconds, that&#x27;s like
        having (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) and forgetting the images BC and DE,
        so bicycle then dentist. In my head I would have the cycle
        (A????FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVQWX) So I would move on to (AFG) leaving the
        following permutation on my cube: (FBCDE)(AHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) So I do
        the same. I forgot BC and DE, so I move on to the next one I remember,
        FG. I then continue as normal, remembering at the end to take the first
        letter of the image immediately after the ones I forgot, here F, and use
        it as the first piece followed by the forgotten stuff. So in my head I
        know I need to do (F????) at the end, and I fill in the unknowns as I
        discover unused pieces while solving the rest of the cycle. So I start
        with F and continue with BCDE once I remember that those are the missing
        letters. Once I&#x27;ve remembered BCDE I just add F to the start and do
        the cycle (FBCDE) and the cube will still solve. ----------- Ok, I just
        wanted to post about this since I think it is a really good tool to have
        in the belt so to speak, and I can&#x27;t believe I never thought to try
        this before now. Again I know it is a simple idea, and probably pretty
        obvious, but I think it should be required to be part of the method for
        the bigger cubes, since it lets you continue solving after a forgotten
        cycle while *still* searching your mind for the forgotten pieces, rather
        than just wasting time not twisting and only thinking about what the
        forgotten pieces are. Just my two cents, Chris

        Actually, thinking about it more you can even do a pickup cycle within a
        pickup cycle. Say I start with (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) and I forget
        BC and DE so in my head I have: (A????FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) I would then
        skip to (AFG) and continue as normal. On my cube this leaves me with the
        pickup cycle (FBCDE) at the end to complete the cube. Now say for some
        reason I recall that the second skipped image is DE, but I can&#x27;t
        remember the middle one. This let&#x27;s me know that my pickup cycle
        looks like (F??DE). I then skip over the forgotten image again and
        continue as normal, so I do (FDE), which leaves the pickup cycle (D??),
        which on the cube will be (DBC), I just need to keep thinking to
        remember that B and C are the last two unused letters. So I can skip the
        first time leaving me with the pickup cycle (FBCDE) to solve the cube.
        Then if I recall the DE before the BC I can do the cycle (FDE) leaving
        me with a different pickup cycle (DBC) to complete the cube. I am
        immediately solving recalled information this way, and it is also
        narrowing down my choices for what the last two pieces can be in my
        final pickup cycle. This is great, so you can continue solving and still
        be searching for unused pieces at the same time, there&#x27;s no reason
        to pause at all! Wow, ok this is cool, I definitely am getting more and
        more excited about this idea the more I think about it. Chris --- In

        Hey, In my experience, this is kinda why I like having fixed journey
        items -- they are easy to go back to. For instance, if Britney Spears
        represents, in general, the third set within a cycle (ie, out of the
        cycle abcdefg, Spears would be afg), and I forgot f or g, I would
        actually just think of the verb in itself starting with &#x27;b&#x27; as
        it is impossible for me to get a verb that starts with &#x27;b&#x27; and
        move through the list. I also keep in mind the setting (ie. my
        background for X centers differ from my + centers, and my Wing settings
        are underwater, etc). What I mean here is, think, &quot;Is Spears
        balancing anything? Is she crying? Dragging anything? Electrocuting
        something?&quot; Not only will the verb sound right when you hit it, but
        the associated noun will also pop into memory. Furthermore, if you
        don&#x27;t remember if Spears is, say, electrocuting something, but you
        know that Arnold is electrocuting a lollipop, then you know it
        isn&#x27;t &#x27;e&#x27; that is involved. The added concept of a
        setting will also lend more information for filling in the blanks and
        jogging your memory. In other words, it might help to run through images
        until one of them sounds right instead of thinking of the ones you have
        not used -- there&#x27;s always the chance you recall something that was
        not even memorized in the first place (ie. an image that was not
        initially involved). Do you think it saves time by saving such memory
        issues until the end of the cycle? Or is it better to deal with things
        then and there to save time dealing with cycle pickups? Even with your
        memory burp you still achieved a sub-10 time on your 4x4. I also found
        that sometimes making the memory items more vivid helps (in other words,
        the best way to avoiding this memory issue is simply not to forget).
        Instead of thinking of &quot;bicycle&quot; and &quot;dentist&quot;
        simply as interacting items, give your mind a moment to wander and maybe
        make a small scene, like from a movie, with very vivid details, even
        dialogue. Maybe add in extra items that would lend to easy recall such
        that those items are not part of the memory system in itself, but exist
        only to make it easier. For instance, maybe there&#x27;s a dentist on a
        bicycle running away from an Austin Powers robot with bad teeth, angry
        because the dentist did a poor job fixing him. The dentist swerves
        everywhere, dodging Austin&#x27;s laser vision or something. Now, Austin
        Powers, robots, and lasers may not be part of your memory system -- but
        I assure you it will be easier to recall Dentist on a Bicycle when
        you&#x27;re in the midst of solving. Anyways I doubt this is anything
        new but just figured it was worth throwing in a cent or two, lol.
        Amazing solve time, by the way! It was a fun video to watch :D Marcus

        filling in the blanks and jogging your memory. Yeah I think that is a
        downside to using images to represent two pieces, if I forget one image
        I have so many different choices of what it could be based on what
        letters are left over. Also, the hardest thing I have found is that the
        images don&#x27;t suggest anything about the letters to me anymore. I
        can&#x27;t just glance through and see an image and know it&#x27;s
        letters, I really have to take the time to decode what the letters are
        from that image. If I am frantically searching for an unused letter,
        nothing about a bagel, or Achilles, or Batman, or a magic lamp, or a mug
        of root beer suggests the letter &quot;A&quot; readily, even though they
        all contain an A. Bagel=BA, Achilles=AC, Batman=DA for Dark Knight,
        magic lamp=LA for lamp, mug of root beer=AW for A&amp;W root beer. Now I
        can very quickly go from LA to magic lamp, or AW to a mug of root beer,
        but I&#x27;m not as fast at seeing a mug of root beer and feeling
        &quot;that image has an A&quot;. I have to think, &quot;hmmm root beer,
        that&#x27;s AW which has an A&quot;, I can&#x27;t just do it
        immediately. I&#x27;ve found that sometimes even if I know A is an
        unaccounted for letter, that still leaves me with 46 possible images, 23
        for A_, and 23 for _A. However, the upside to me is that I can put 6
        pieces of a cycle into one journey location, Boba Fett kicking a giant
        Lobster so that it falls over onto Spiderman would be FTRLXS and
        represents 6 pieces of my cycle and would fit into one journey location.
        I guess I like the benefits and power of combining so much information
        into one location, that I&#x27;m willing to find ways like &quot;pickup
        cycles&quot; to overcome forgetting an image, which for me is nerve
        racking, since there are so many choices for what it could be if I truly
        can&#x27;t remember anything about it. I have tried to go through all 46
        possibles if I can remember that there is an &quot;A&quot; in my image
        say, but that usually takes a lot of time and I try to see if I can just
        find all the letters missing, and see what combinations of them seem
        familiar. > > I also found that sometimes making the memory items more

        you&#x27;re in the midst of solving. Yeah, I can see what you mean. I
        tend to try to minimize the motion involved in each journey location,
        and just picture the objects with the motions they would be doing as
        implied by how they are setup. However, sometimes this just does not
        work, like with 3 inanimate objects, so I have to make it more of a
        movie and add in the motion. What&#x27;s cool though, is that each
        object is starting to build a personality because I always see the same
        ones over and over again. For example RK=rake for me, and rake is
        becoming a magical possessed rake that can attack things at will, which
        makes the scene funny. This is because I often have a rake surrounded by
        inanimate objects, and no person to wield it. So I let the rake wield
        itself and go beserk. This was weird at first, but now the rake has a
        personality of it&#x27;s own, plus it&#x27;s sort of magic. So now I get
        a little excited when RK comes up in my cycle, because I know the rake
        will be doing something funny at that location, and I&#x27;m more likely
        to not forget anything from that location during the solve. > > Anyways

        a cent or two, lol. Amazing solve time, by the way! It > was a fun video
        to watch :D No I definitely appreciate the ideas, absolutely! I think
        that is the only way that cubing can grow, is if everone shares their
        ideas. I think personally though I am much more drawn to using letter
        pair images than PAO. The upside is that I really believe I can
        personally memorize faster with letter pair images than by PAO. Now I
        know different method are better for different people, and it probably
        depends on how your brain is wired or something. There is so much
        variation in the world of memorizing. I know that there are speed
        memorizers who just put one image per location, and just have lots of
        locations prepared, and they get amazing times on speed cards and the
        other categories! I&#x27;m willing to try to find ways to overcome the
        pitfalls, such as forgetting an image, since most of the time I
        don&#x27;t forget an image and I can memorize much faster this way. I
        say if PAO is very powerful for you, then use it. Forgetting a verb or
        an object, or a person is not as bad for you since you can try the
        choices much more quickly. I hate the pitfalls of forgetting an image
        using letter pairs, but I think pickup cycles will really help to make
        it not so nerve racking to forget something during a solve. For me
        though, I love how easy these images make it to memorize. All the work
        is done in having the letters already have an image associated to it, I
        just have to learn the personality of the harder images for things like
        RK=rake. Images like RB=Robocop are pretty easy, and already have a very
        strong personality in my mind, but some of them I have to see how they
        can interact over a few solves before I know what they&#x27;re like. In
        5 years though I&#x27;ll know the personality of every object perfectly,
        and will be able to combine them much more easily. Ben Pridmore talked
        about how he slowly developed rules and personalites for how all his
        images combine, and after using them for years things got easier and
        easier. I&#x27;m hoping the same will happen for my images once
        I&#x27;ve used them a long time. I know this message is long, I just
        wanted to post about this letter pair method. I know I probably seem to
        be always mentioning the problems with it, but in reality I think the
        benefits are worth so much that is outweighs the problems, at least for
        me and however my brain is wired to remember things. I do appreciate the
        advice, but I would prefer to learn how to use pickup cycles, and keep
        using letter pair memorizing, rather than switch back to PAO and avoid
        the harder problem of forgetting part of a location, but for me not
        being able to memorize as quickly as with letter pairs. I think we
        should probably compile a page of advice for the different methods,
        because as you say maybe for PAO pickup cycles are not necessary, since
        you can probably remember the forgoten part of the journey location much
        more quickly than I could. However for letter pairs, pickup cycles are
        sort of the natural way to handle a forgotten image, since you can keep
        solving and discover the missing letters at the same time, and you
        don&#x27;t lose time when that memorizing mistake happens, or at least
        not as much time. I still want to post a tutorial for how I am going
        about BLD solving on my page, and add in all these tricks like pickup
        cycles and center and edge blocks and the like. Anyway, would you be
        interested in writing a section about PAO? Why have the site just have
        one method, when it can cover all of them? Stefan, would you be
        interested in writing a section about your method and using a buffer and
        helper piece for the cycles? Also you could post all the most efficient
        setup moves for each piece, etc.. BLD cubing doesn&#x27;t seem as big as
        speed solving, but then again there are fewer resources for BLD cubing
        online, and I think that is a big reason why. Do you guys want to change
        that? I certainly do, or at least do my part to help change that. Just
        my two cents again, or three lol. These messages always get longer than
        intend when I first start. Chris > > Marcus Stuhr > Wharton &amp; CAS

        immediately. Yeah -- understandable; is there a way to convert the
        images into something more obvious? I mean if your system works, it
        works -- but of course there can always be ways to circumvent normal
        issues. To me, for instance, Root Beer would be RB or something, and is
        easy to decode. A&amp;W to Root Beer is an added layer of association.
        Easy for some images, harder for others, as you&#x27;ve eloquently
        stated. Is this issue something that doesn&#x27;t really hinder much
        during normal solving or is it only an issue when a cycle is forgotten??

        my cycle and would fit into one journey location. WHOA OK. That is just
        awesome, hahaha. I did not know your system included that much
        information in one spot... that is so cool (I was under the impression
        that it carried up to 2-3 or so). Those would be quite vivid images,
        indeed. Hmm that would be a pretty good advantage -- I mean so much
        information in one spot is harder to forget. I think we both attempt
        this but in different ways, but of course we see the advantages of doing
        so. I am beginning to think your approach is more &quot;efficient&quot;
        as the abundance of data involved pertains to the PIECES, whereas mine
        relies on fixed data. For instance, my X-center cycle memory hooks take
        place in bright, peaceful settings. My array of People denote position
        within the cycle. This is merely for memory purposes and has nothing to
        do with what needs to be &quot;solved&quot; until I throw in a verb and
        noun for a given location. This probably means I have to memorize more
        &quot;locations&quot; with less data per location whereas you are able
        to fix up to 6 pieces of data in a location, which is obviously more
        effective. My question is, it is consistent? How often are you able to
        get 6 per cycle? This is kind of an exciting idea -- I had no idea you
        were able to fit so much in one location. > I guess I like the benefits

        counterargument up is that I wonder if this added method deducts more
        time than it would take to simply recall the forgotten item. What about
        if there are multiple cycles involved? Just simply wondering if there
        are cases when it would be more difficult to pick up the cycle later. >

        :P But yes, as you stated, the more personality the better :) Maybe
        it&#x27;s just me but adding levels of perversion is also helpful.
        Sometimes levels of grotesque or taboo memory hooks are also hard to
        forget (ie. very naughty interactions between Shakira and ice cream :) )

        system, lol, which is not my intent -- I&#x27;m just throwing
        ideas/questions out so that we get a big pool of ideas going so we can
        learn to adapt new concepts, etc, for speed/efficiency purposes. It
        really does depend on the person however, since our minds can definitely
        work differently. Some people are more visual, or more aural, or
        tactile, etc. I think it also depends on your interests -- I&#x27;m very
        into math/science but I am also very into writing and literature, so it
        helps to sort of combine elements of mathematical efficiency and
        creative precision in order to appeal to all areas of interest that

        items become more second-nature, and they evolve into something more
        personal. The more personal something is, the more associations arise.
        The more associations that arise, well, obviously the easier/faster it
        is to memorize! > I know this message is long, I just wanted to post

        Hey Chris I really like the idea...can be very useful for my 3x3x3 BLD,
        since I (a lot) often forget one cycle...haha... if there are 2 cycles

        other and, after, search for the pieces that were not used...much like
        you... also, I memorise similar to you, like... usually starting from
        UF(1), then going 2 by 2, like 1 (3 5) (4 10) (6 8) or something

        I&#x27;ve been thinking about the problem of forgetting a cycle in the
        middle of a longer solve. This could happen on any size cube, assuming
        you are using the orient first and 3-cycles method. For Stefan&#x27;s
        approach this could be forgetting one single piece, or maybe 2 pieces in
        succession. This idea is probably more relevant to the bigger cubes, but
        I wanted to post since it still does relate to the 3x3, in case anyone
        is interested. I&#x27;ve had solves on the 4x4 and 5x5 where I forgot
        only one single image, or as in my 4x4x4 BLD video for about 40 seconds
        I forgot two successive images. Each image for me is a 3 cycle, so I
        effectively forget only one or two single three cycles, but can still
        perfectly recall everything else. What I usually do is to stop and count
        up all my letters (pieces) and see which are unused, and try to rebuild
        the image I&#x27;ve forgotten. This takes time obviously, and I&#x27;ve
        thought that maybe continuing solving and doing this at the same time
        would be better. I&#x27;ve been working on this, and have decided to add
        this to my method. What it is, is to purposefully skip the forgotten
        cycle, and do everything else, then at the end you will have run through
        all your pieces or in my case letters, and can more easily recall which
        are unused. This is a simple idea, and makes sense with just a little
        thought, but I&#x27;ve started practicing it to make it reflex, which I
        think will be a powerful addition to a blindfolded solving method. It
        works like this, say I have the 24 cycle (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) for
        the edges on a 4x4 or 5x5 cube. Now let&#x27;s say I forgot the image
        DE, or dentist. What I used to do is 1) freak out, followed by 2) try to
        go through the other images and add up all the letters until I find the
        ones I haven&#x27;t used, and eventually discover that D and E are free,
        allowing me to remember &quot;dentist&quot;. What I say now is to do
        this: The first three cycle is still available, so do the cycle (ABC)
        leaving (ADEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) Of course I don&#x27;t know the
        upcoming cycle, so I would view it as: (A??FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) Now I
        could take the time to go through each image and find that I am missing
        D and E, but this could take up to 40 seconds at least, probably around
        a minute on average. Why waste that time, when I can let the solving do
        the search for me? So I&#x27;ll skip my forgotten cycle and move on to
        the rest: Now I do (AFG) since I know the next image after my forgotten
        one (here the DE image). Looking at the original cycle
        (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX), I have now done (ABC) followed by (AFG) This
        leaves the original cycle in the form (FDE)(AHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) This is
        because after (ABC) I was supposed to send A to D, but I instead sent it
        to F for the (AFG) cycle. This means that the piece now in F goes to D.
        The piece that is in D needs to go to E. And because FG followed DE then
        the piece in E needed to go to F, which leaves me with a simple three
        cycle to pick up at the end. So basically I continue as normal for the
        rest of the cycle (AHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX), and just remember that I have to
        do the cycle (F??) at the end, and the two question marks are the
        forgotten pieces, once I remember them to be DE I fill that cycle in as
        (FDE). In general, if you forget a cycle, move on anyway. Then once you
        recall the two pieces of the forgotten cycle, use the first piece of the
        next cycle after your forgotten one as your first piece in the
        &quot;pick up&quot; cycle and do that 3 cycle to complete the cube. So
        for images, I forget DE. DE was followed by FG so I moved on with (AFG).
        Then once I remember that DE is the forgotten cycle I look to my next
        image (FG) and take the first spot (F) and use it as the first piece of
        a 3 cycle, followed by the forgotten stuff, giving (FDE). Again I
        don&#x27;t know how useful this will be to 3x3x3 BLD, but I can&#x27;t
        believe I never thought to do this for the bigger cubes, and it
        certainly is going to become my main technique for what to do if I
        forget an image, effectively if I forget a cycle. --------- As to my
        4x4x4 BLD video mistake, where I forgot two successive images for about
        40 seconds, that&#x27;s like having (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) and
        forgetting the images BC and DE, so bicycle then dentist. In my head I
        would have the cycle (A????FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVQWX) So I would move on to
        (AFG) leaving the following permutation on my cube:
        (FBCDE)(AHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) So I do the same. I forgot BC and DE, so I
        move on to the next one I remember, FG. I then continue as normal,
        remembering at the end to take the first letter of the image immediately
        after the ones I forgot, here F, and use it as the first piece followed
        by the forgotten stuff. So in my head I know I need to do (F????) at the
        end, and I fill in the unknowns as I discover unused pieces while
        solving the rest of the cycle. So I start with F and continue with BCDE
        once I remember that those are the missing letters. Once I&#x27;ve
        remembered BCDE I just add F to the start and do the cycle (FBCDE) and
        the cube will still solve. ----------- Ok, I just wanted to post about
        this since I think it is a really good tool to have in the belt so to
        speak, and I can&#x27;t believe I never thought to try this before now.
        Again I know it is a simple idea, and probably pretty obvious, but I
        think it should be required to be part of the method for the bigger
        cubes, since it lets you continue solving after a forgotten cycle while
        *still* searching your mind for the forgotten pieces, rather than just
        wasting time not twisting and only thinking about what the forgotten
        pieces are. Just my two cents, Chris ---------------------------------

        In Pochmann BLD, when you complete a cycle, that is the UR cubie comes
        to the UR position. Then you can throw it out where ever. for one you
        could orient permuted but misoriented edges, or you could do those at
        the end. When you get a buffer cubie in the buffer area, you can choose
        any other cubie. The easiest thing that try to do is swap a U edge, or
        the U/D face of a corner. It should be the same in other methods, as
        long as you complete the last cycle before starting a new one, it
        shouldn&#x27;t matter what cycle you start. You may have memorized
        (1,4,8) (2,12,11,5,3) (6,9,7,10) you could very well solve (6,9,7,10)
        (1,4,8) (2,12,11,5,3) right? Even then you could begin a new cycle such
        as (1,4,11,5,3,2, 12,7,10,6,9,8) I guess But I don&#x27;t do 3 cycles,

        I had work and I didn&#x27;t have the financial means/ability to make
        the trip but I will definitely compete next year sometime, most likely

        pubicly more often lately in order to develop some nerves, but it&#x27;s
        still quite difficult. I still need to learn to calm down a bit more.
        I&#x27;m not quite up to the level of Tyson/Leyan/Macky yet when it
        comes to BLD solving in high-pressure situations. Does anyone know what
        Knights did to overcome nerves? I know that a few years ago he focused
        primarily on calming nerves in order to cube more easily. Anyhow, does
        anyone know if there are any better Corner Permuting algs that
        don&#x27;t utilize so many face-turns? CP is quite slow for me and
        it&#x27;s mainly derived from the algorithms. Marcus Stuhr Wharton &amp;

        need to learn to calm down a bit more. I&#x27;m not quite up to the
        level of Tyson/Leyan/Macky yet when it comes to BLD solving in
        high-pressure situations. Does anyone know what Knights did to overcome
        nerves? I know that a few years ago he focused primarily on calming
        nerves in order to cube more easily. Anyhow, does anyone know if there
        are any better Corner Permuting algs that don&#x27;t utilize so many
        face-turns? CP is quite slow for me and it&#x27;s mainly derived from

        Hey Marcus, A few things helped me to feel more confident about BLD
        under pressure (in public/in competition). The most important thing for
        me was to do solves a LOT, and try to solve in public as much as
        possible when practicing. Also I would recommend doing lots of solves in
        a row, even if you are mentally tired and want to stop, do one more
        solve anyway. That way in a competition if you are not yet ready for
        your next solve, but are called up anyway, you&#x27;ll be used to
        solving and not yet wanting to solve. Ironically, the thing that helped
        me the most to feel more confident about BLD solving in competition was
        to DNF in competition. After DNF&#x27;ing enough times you sort of get
        this sense of redemption and you just can&#x27;t wait for your next shot
        at another solve to try to prove yourself, rather than thinking &quot;oh
        crap, I have to do a high pressure solve soon&quot; and getting nervous.
        Just my two cents. I would say don&#x27;t fear the DNF, just get let it
        be a source of motivation if it happens, rather than something that gets
        you down. Chris P.S. Congrats on the sub-70 3x3x3 BLD solve! That&#x27;s
        amazing, Keep it up! >I have been cubing in front of > people pubicly

        One issue for me though was that when I cube in public, I wonder how it
        must look? I mean most people obviously can&#x27;t solve a Rubik&#x27;s
        Cube, so when they see someone doing it, is it seen as showing off? I
        wonder if I look weird doing it in front of people in public? What kind
        of public settings do you cube at? As for the DNF&#x27;s, I totally
        agree. Although those aren&#x27;t what bother me so much (I&#x27;m fine
        with DNF&#x27;s -- we all mess up, so what?) -- it&#x27;s just the focus
        aspect. How do you keep a clear head at a competition? How many people
        are actually watching? Does it take time for you to shut out the
        external noises/thoughts and focus solely on the cube itself? Thanks for
        the advice and kind words! Marcus Stuhr Wharton &amp; CAS &#x27;09

        exactly the same way. I always feel extraordinarily awkward when I cube
        in public, which is one of the main reasons I try to do it a lot, since
        it is not my comfortable computer room in my house where I usually
        practice. I&#x27;ve always enjoyed hanging out at Starbucks when I hang
        out with friends, so I find that I am a little more comfortable there
        than other places when I do BLD in public. When I am memorizing I
        sometimes get questions from people like &quot;What are you doing?&quot;
        or more often &quot;Have you solved it yet?&quot;. Usually though no one
        bothers me because I appear pretty focused on whatever it is I appear to
        be doing, and they don&#x27;t want to interupt. When solving, and
        wearing the blindfold, you usually will hear people make comments the
        most. Things like &quot;How does he do that?&quot; or &quot;That&#x27;s
        crazy!&quot;. I always feel really awkward here because I don&#x27;t
        want to appear to be a showoff, I really am out for practice at
        controlling my nerves, so I just sort of keep solving and don&#x27;t say
        anything. If anyone is standing there right as I solve, or DNF, I try to
        answer any questions if they ask me, but usually people don&#x27;t wait
        that long and have already left (I usually do the bigger cubes in public
        only). Try to answer any questions you get from people while you are
        memorizing, because that interuption is a HUGE distraction, and if you
        can pick right back up memorizing after answering it then you&#x27;re
        already more than prepared for any type of interuption you&#x27;ll get
        in competition. > As for the DNF&#x27;s, I totally agree. > Although
        those aren&#x27;t what bother me so much (I&#x27;m fine with DNF&#x27;s

        the Chattahoochee competition when I was memorizing for the 5x5x5 and
        4x4x4. I think the reason was though that I wasn&#x27;t wearing any
        earplugs or earmuffs, so I could hear with perfect clarity anything
        anyone said around me, and that was very hard to tune out. I now wear
        eaplugs and earmuffs any time I do a solve in competition, and that sort
        of puts you in your own quiet &quot;personal space&quot;. You can still
        hear a low hum of activity, but nothing as distinctive as a single voice
        or conversation, so you can treat it like white noise and fairly
        successfully ignore it. At least it has helped for me. I use regular
        earplugs from Walmart, and the earmuffs are the ones I wear when I go to
        a firing range, so they are pretty heavy duty just by themselves. The
        two together make sort of like my own quiet space in competition, so it
        makes it easier to focus. Yeah no problem, I hope this helps. Sorry you
        couldn&#x27;t make it to Nationals :-( but I am very much looking
        forward to meeting you in person at a competition one day! We should
        trade BLD tips or something heh heh, I&#x27;d be all for that, none of
        my method is a secret I&#x27;m ready to share what I know any time.
        I&#x27;d also be really interested in seeing how you tackle a cube BLD
        in person, after seeing your times for it! > Marcus Stuhr > Wharton
        &amp; CAS &#x27;09 > University of Pennsylvania Take it easy, and keep
        trying that public practice! I really believe that it really does help!

        Yeah if I do BLD in front of people I get similar comments (I only do
        the 3x3 in public though -- I&#x27;d imagine people don&#x27;t stick
        around all the time for the larger cubes. Should I still give it a
        shot?). Recently I did a lot of practice solving in front of people at a
        summer job, but what always got to me is hearing people walk in and
        whisper comments to each other -- while complimentary -- still very much
        distracting. It was a real bummer because the first solve I did was done
        correctly in front of a smaller group of about 5 people, then I had a

      <div class="email-content">
        Hi again... At Nationals, I was re-inspired to try speed blindfold
        solving. So, on the plane ride home, I attempted again...and succeeded!
        This was on the 11th (Friday). Anyway, my total time was 1 hour 33.14
        seconds. Actually a bit less, but I forgot to stop my watch timer for a
        minute or two. The solving time was a mediocre 37.74 seconds, but I
        wanted to make sure I succeeded. Next time I&#x27;ll find a better cross
        and go faster. The scramble was D2 F2 L B&#x27; U B2 D L D R&#x27; L2 D2
        B U2 R F R&#x27; F U&#x27; L2 F D&#x27; R2 U&#x27; F2 with yellow on
        top, red on front. I did a y2 and noticed a corner-edge pair sitting at
        DR/DFR. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what to do with it, so I ignored it.
        I decided on a cross L D&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; L F2. I
        then went to figure out what had become of that pair at DR/DFR by
        tracking it while imagining the effect of each move of the cross...and
        it turned out it was still connected, and could be solved with F2
        R&#x27; F2 R! So I modified my cross to [...]F&#x27; L R&#x27; F2 R.
        Hmm, now it&#x27;s an extended cross, I guess. Completely by chance, I
        found it. I then used basically that procedure to find what I would do
        with the rest of my F2L pairs. For red/green I did U&#x27; L U L&#x27;,
        for red/blue I did L&#x27; U&#x27; L R&#x27; U&#x27; R, and for
        green/orange I did (my 2nd least favorite F2L case) U2 L2 U2 L U L&#x27;
        U L2. I figured this all out in about 20 minutes. Then I started
        tracking my yellow edges through the F2L solution. I pretty quickly
        found that the green and blue edges were swapped, and that the blue and
        orange edges were flipped. Then I started messing up. It took me just
        short of an hour to figure out the corners. I almost put my blindfold on
        before I checked and found out I had made a mistake. I checked all the
        corners, and figured out that, after the F2L, two were in the same spot.
        That...doesn&#x27;t make sense. So I looked at one of them and figured
        out it was actually in a different spot...which was already occupied. By
        the time I straightened those three out, I had forgotten what was going
        on with the first corner I had done. Then I checked the other three out
        again and got the same problem. Eventually, I got a logical arrangement,
        which was that UB and UR were oriented, as was URF, and that the other 3
        needed to be twisted clockwise. It&#x27;s one of the lightning bolt
        thingies. The back corners needed to be swapped, as did the right and
        left edges. Basically an F-perm. Just not everything was oriented yet.
        So I started figuring out the effect of the OLL, which was going to be
        y2 F&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L U F y F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; y. I
        recognized that that, if I did U2, the corner permutation should be the
        same as it is now. And I recognized that it did two edge 3-cycles,
        namely F->B->R and R- >L->F. Both of those are even permutations. And
        then I would do an H permutation to it (F&lt;->B, L&lt;->R) when I did
        U2. And there was an odd permutation of edges on the cube already
        (L&lt;->R). So, I reasoned, after doing three even permutations on a
        cube with an odd permutation of edges, there would be an even
        permutation of edges. Right? I was completely stumped when I kept
        finding odd permutations of edges. I nearly hit myself over the head
        when I realized how absolutely stupid I was to expect an even
        permutation. Anyways, I found that it was a J perm, so my permutation
        was y R U R&#x27; F&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R2 U&#x27;
        R&#x27; U&#x27;. Finally, I had a working solution! So I sat there for
        two minutes before asking my dad to take a video. If anyone wants to see
        it, I can put it online. I started the timer...and blanked on the cross.
        I remembered it, but it took me like 5-10 seconds. The back left corner
        edge pair was fast, the next one was pretty quick. The last one, I
        hesitated since I mess up on that case occasionally while looking. I
        hesitated on OLL, but not on PLL. Solving time: 37.74 seconds. Next time
        I&#x27;m going to use your suggestions a bit more, since I don&#x27;t
        want the torture of figuring out the OLL to happen again. And I want a
        faster solve next time. Were it not almost 1 AM right now, &quot;next
        time&quot; would be now. But i&#x27;m going to sleep...after a few magic
        solves. Tim --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi everyone, I got a number of requests for a website about my big cubes
        BLD method at US Nationals. I have already posted or written pretty much
        everything I would want to be on a site like that either on this forum
        or on the rubiks.has.it forum. So, what I&#x27;ll do is gather all the
        information I spread around on those sites onto one site on my page. I
        also want to add an example solve to my memorization page that shows how
        I apply my images together at a location, rather than just the list of
        images I use. For anyone who is interested, this is the next thing I am
        working on for my site, and I hope to have it compiled and up soon. If
        you&#x27;re interested in a method for the bigger cubes BLD, both
        memorization and solving, then keep checking back. I&#x27;ll try to have
        it up soon. I use the exact same method and same images for the 4x4x4
        and 5x5x5 BLD, and theoretically the 6x6x6 or larger too, so if
        you&#x27;re interested in big cube BLD at all you would only need to
        learn the one set of images and how to use them to be able to do it.

        The corners method of Pochman really isn&#x27;t bad at all. I was really

        Not at the edges. But at the corners. Which should be easiest cause not

        Hey Stefan, I absolutely totally and completely know the feeling. My
        worst ever DNF, or the one I consider the worst, was one on 5x5x5 where
        all I had to do to finish the cube was the parity alg on wing edges (I
        had done the solve correctly up to this point). The very final turn of
        the parity alg it felt like I pulled not only the r2 but also the m
        layer. I undid the m layer turn the way I thought I had done it, and
        when I opened my eyes the m layer was off by 1 quarter turn. I had
        apparently done m with the r2, and thought I did m2, so I undid with m2
        leaving me with the cube m&#x27; away from solved. o_O Needless to say I
        was the very slightest bit pissed off with myself the rest of that day
        lol. On a lighter note though my image for the letter pair
        &quot;DQ&quot; is DisQualified, and is a picture of that 5x5x5 cube I

        I&#x27;m really that slow sometimes, I was an m turn away from solved
        since I did m, then m2 leaving me with a necessary m turn to solve.
        Anyway Stefan, no worries man, just practice those algs a lot as drills.
        I seriously must have done the parity alg on 5x5x5 with my eyes closed
        about 50 times as punishment for having messed it up like that, but now
        I don&#x27;t mess it up blindfolded anymore. I think it takes a painful
        DNF to perfectly cement an alg for slow BLD solving that is one that
        messes up occasionaly. Just my two cents, Chris

        Ohhhh you&#x27;re really gonna love this then... my DNF&#x27;s were on
        the 3x3x3. Not even the bigger cubes. The measly 3x3x3! I&#x27;m pretty
        sure I kept messing up EP on like every single solve (EP is the hardest
        for me -- if my EP is slow, the whole solve is slow). I only know two
        edge cycling algorithms and so I have to be very careful about setup
        moves and how I rotate the cube, and so if I try to go too fast I mess
        up. Every single time I tried to complete a solve I&#x27;d open my eyes
        and just see a big mess (many times, though, the corners were solved,
        but other times they were botched too, probably meaning I messed up a
        setup move). Just so aggravating :/ Had some successful solves this
        morning though so I feel a bit better :) Slowed down on the EP and made
        sure the setups were correct. Knowing better algs might help a bit.
        Currently I&#x27;m trying to overhaul my approach to memorization
        (trying to approach it similar to Tyson and Leyan) but it&#x27;s taking
        some getting used to. However I do feel it would be faster in the long

        Hey Dave, Thanks for the kudos. My memorization techniques (as well as
        Leyan&#x27;s/Tyson&#x27;s) relies on groups of patterns, I think. Like
        looking for chunks of corners that can be flipped with a single alg, or
        other chunks of 4/5, etc. Tyson had mentioned to me that he plans out
        his execution for EP, so I&#x27;m trying to go this route currently but
        it&#x27;s giving me issues/hard to get used to. How fast is your current
        memorization/what is your technique/approach? For EO, for example, I
        approach it with a Binary method (converting to three letters for easy
        memory). CP and EP are a little trickier... I wish there were a really
        fast and easy way to memorize them and execute the algs needed in a
        braindead fashion. As for the 1:08 solve, the memorization and execution
        were both easy. For instance, the CP path was virtually a simple cube
        wrap-around spiral. There was no parity error and the EP was full of
        fast executions that were easy to set up. It was mainly just an easy but
        not lucky scramble. Marcus Stuhr Wharton &amp; CAS &#x27;09 University

        Marcus, >> How fast is your current memorization/what is your
        technique/approach? Not very fast. Usually around 35, give or take.
        I&#x27;d be happy with 25 sec consistently. But that&#x27;d be pushing
        it with my current Carr system. I assume most non-Pochmann solvers solve
        either CO or EO first. I do CO first, since it&#x27;s hardest for me too
        memorize. I try to plan the moves out, but often this gives me trouble-
        especially when there are say, 6 to orient- and takes too much time
        memorizing. I memorize EO second to last, and solve it second. I often
        take too much time memorizing it also. For those tracking cycles for the
        perms, I wonder how they recall them. Do they say to themselves,
        &quot;3-cycle curving left&quot;, or some such thing; do they just
        picture the cycles? How do they remember pairs that need swapping? Do
        they use a phonetic system? It seems very difficult to memorize quickly,
        tracking around the cube, with cycles starting and stopping. My numerous
        attempts have been failures. If I could figure out a good way to
        memorize, I could see how the solving might be fast, many times. Anyway,
        just rambling, wondering how to get faster. -Dave

        Hey Dave, A while back I posted a diagram showing my CO method --
        you&#x27;ll find that in many cases, you can limit the entire step to 7
        algorithms (it is easy to spot a Sune on the color you&#x27;re used to,
        for instance, but such cases can also show up on the sides in less
        obvious forms). You normally would check U/D for these 7 cases, and if
        nothing&#x27;s good there, then you would check F/B, then L/R, etc. If
        nothing good comes up, usually imagining a turn of D/D&#x27;/D2 will
        allow you to find something to work with. It sounds like a lot to take
        in but you&#x27;ll find that it becomes pretty quick with time. Instead
        of memorizing a bunch of corner numbers/positions you simply remember
        something like &quot;Sune up the left, Cowskull down the right&quot;
        which means holding the cube so L is now U and D is now F, and doing a
        Sune, then rerotating the cube so U is now F and R is now U, and doing a
        Cowskull algorithm. Makes for a quick and painless memorization. I
        personally do CO first although I solve it first... not very efficient
        but I&#x27;m used to it, so I tend to stick with it. I may change this
        approach so that I execute EO/EP first because it&#x27;s the hardest for
        me to memorize EP. EO is actually quite easy to memorize -- just go
        Binary Method. I truly don&#x27;t think it gets much easier than that.
        You just churn out three letters and then you&#x27;ve got the
        orientation layout for the edges. When solving, it&#x27;s fairly easy to
        execute, especially if there are only 4 or so edges needing flipping. It
        gets a little trickier if you&#x27;re flipping 6, but sometimes
        it&#x27;s faster to do a 4flip followed by a 2 flip. It&#x27;s really a
        case by case basis. How do you memorize EP? I used to use a sort of PAO
        system but it has its limits in terms of speed, although it makes the
        cycles stick with the memory longer (ie. less DNF&#x27;s). Sometimes
        just memorizing a rote path is sufficient (although fast, I hate how
        unreliable it is in terms of consistency when actually solving), but I
        really hate EP and would love a better way to do it. I&#x27;ve tried
        phonetic systems with little luck (either that or I choose poorly when
        it comes to what sounds/letters to use). EP sucks sucks sucks :( I think
        stuff like &quot;three cycle curving left&quot; is the sort of approach
        Tyson uses, but don&#x27;t quote me on that, because I am not 100% sure.
        Do you memorize CP in the same manner as EP? I&#x27;m trying to create a
        new permutation approach by using grouping (ie. algs that split things
        into fewer cases such that they are easier to solve with fewer algs),
        but this is not turning out so great yet. Anyways, hope to hear back
        soon! Marcus Stuhr Wharton &amp; CAS &#x27;09 University of Pennsylvania

        Third Try... 23.61 DNF - I tried my solution afterwards, exactly as I

        was planning the cross I noticed the Xcross quite quickly. Solve:

        L U L&#x27; OLL: R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; (:D this was nice, when I
        was inspecting and saw 2 corners I was like, yes, this is gunna be sune
        or Pi, most likely sune, then I did the 3rd corner, and it was oriented
        right, so I knew it was sune :D) PLL: R2 u R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; R
        u&#x27; R2 y&#x27; R&#x27; U R If anyone is interested in how I do this,
        please let me know. This solve I actually looked at each F2L pair as a
        possibility to execute at any given time. The memo took forever on PLL
        because I was looking at the edges all wrong. In the scramble (after I
        did the y&#x27; at the beginning) the colours were RED ORANGE on F AND B
        and Blue and Green on L and R the OLL had Red and Orange on F and B and
        Green and Blue on L and R. So I kept looking at it wrong and the corners
        for some reason I kept telling myself was a 2 cycle, duh I&#x27;m stupid
        :D Anyways, I will go again, hopefully get a sub-50 memo time, and a
        successful solve, because it bothers me that I&#x27;ve done it right
        each time, except not. This one I actually don&#x27;t know what I did
        wrong, it may have been that on Pair 2 I did an extra set of R U&#x27;
        R&#x27; U but I have no idea. Craig

        memorization. Do you still have the diagram up? I looked at it back
        then, but I may be too dense too use it; anyhow, it seems faster than
        what I am doing, so I should look at it again. I do the CO in one move-
        with setups of course- but often this takes too long to memorize the
        moves. So maybe doing it your way would be faster. >EO is actually quite

        using a phonetic system. It&#x27;s just that sometimes I take too long
        to notice the unoriented edges. The cases where 8 or 10 are flipped are

        sucks sucks :( I agree, EP sucks. I use Carr&#x27;s system, so I use a
        phonetic system, memorizing the edges in their starting positions. I
        posted a detailed description not too long ago if you&#x27;re
        interested. The main problem is it takes too long too solve. I agree
        with what you&#x27;ve written above about EP cycles; I just
        couldn&#x27;t memorize it well enough. I can&#x27;t seem to remember by
        rote methods, and couldn&#x27;t come up with a phonetic way that was
        fast. > I think stuff like &quot;three cycle curving left&quot; is the

        posted in detail about the CP a while ago too. Look for &#x27;corners in
        2&#x27; or some such title. Memorization goes pretty fast, but solving
        can be hard. I&#x27;m always looking for a faster solving system. Having
        watched a bunch of videos, it&#x27;s funny how much slower my hands are
        in solving; I wish I were as fast as some other guys. -Dave

        [blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube] Re: Speed Blindfold Third Try... 23.61
        DNF - I tried my solution afterwards, exactly as I executed it, and it
        solved the cube, so I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong this time.
        Memorisation time: 55 minutes (ish) Scramble: D B2 R&#x27; B&#x27; D2 U2
        L2 R2 D B2 R&#x27; U2 B2 D&#x27; L U2 L F2 D L&#x27; R&#x27; B2 R2
        F&#x27; L2 Yellow on U Green on F Haha, you gotta love not having to
        rescramble the cube to type up the solution :D When I was planning the
        cross I noticed the Xcross quite quickly. Solve: X-Cross: y&#x27;
        R&#x27; D F&#x27; L B&#x27; L2 D2 Pair 2: x&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R
        U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U x Pair 3: y U L&#x27; U L U&#x27;
        L&#x27; U L Pair 4: y U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U2 y&#x27; L U L&#x27; OLL: R
        U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; (:D this was nice, when I was inspecting and
        saw 2 corners I was like, yes, this is gunna be sune or Pi, most likely
        sune, then I did the 3rd corner, and it was oriented right, so I knew it
        was sune :D) PLL: R2 u R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; R u&#x27; R2 y&#x27;
        R&#x27; U R If anyone is interested in how I do this, please let me
        know. This solve I actually looked at each F2L pair as a possibility to
        execute at any given time. The memo took forever on PLL because I was
        looking at the edges all wrong. In the scramble (after I did the y&#x27;
        at the beginning) the colours were RED ORANGE on F AND B and Blue and
        Green on L and R the OLL had Red and Orange on F and B and Green and
        Blue on L and R. So I kept looking at it wrong and the corners for some
        reason I kept telling myself was a 2 cycle, duh I&#x27;m stupid :D
        Anyways, I will go again, hopefully get a sub-50 memo time, and a
        successful solve, because it bothers me that I&#x27;ve done it right
        each time, except not. This one I actually don&#x27;t know what I did
        wrong, it may have been that on Pair 2 I did an extra set of R U&#x27;
        R&#x27; U but I have no idea. Craig

        Dave, Here is a link to the diagram: http://tinyurl.com/r7vrc I
        apologize in advance -- let me know if anything doesn&#x27;t make sense
        at all. I admit it could be clearer, but just let me know if the concept
        isn&#x27;t explained well enough. As for figuring out which edges are
        flipped in EO, I think it&#x27;s just a matter of experience. Soon you
        can instantly spot a bad edge if the F/B color is on the U or D faces or
        along the horizontals of L or R, or if the U/D color is on the F/B faces
        or along the verticals of L or R (assuming you choose L and R for your
        fullturn faces during EP setup). Since you are going to be looking over
        all the edges anyway, it doesn&#x27;t make a difference how many edges
        are bad for memorization -- it should be roughly the same speed each
        time since the conversion process takes the same amount of time for each
        case. The only difference should obviously be that it can take longer to
        solve more edges in execution. Do you have a link to the EP/CP method?
        I&#x27;m not able to find it on this board. :( Do you have any videos
        online? I hear you on that handspeed thing... I don&#x27;t know how some
        guys do it. My cube locks up when I get to high speed but I think
        it&#x27;s just that I have poor technique. Anyways I&#x27;d appreciate
        it if you can find the explanations -- I&#x27;ll keep looking, however.
        Have you tried PAO for EP at all? I think it can be a good approach too
        (sometimes though you even forget the memory hooks! At least, at a speed
        to be competitive for 3x3 BLD solving. For bigger cubes I think
        it&#x27;s the way to go). Marcus Stuhr Wharton &amp; CAS &#x27;09

        Very very interesting approach... I&#x27;ll give this a try and get back
        later. As for my own permutation, if you are interested, I used the
        &quot;Tinshard L&quot; approach, associating corners 2-8 with t n s h r
        d and l (usually corner 1 isn&#x27;t solved so I don&#x27;t really give
        it a letter. If it is solved then it takes little extra effort to start
        at corner 2 or 3, etc). But then instead of memorizing a cycle like (1 4
        5 2 3) it might be (Starting-corner s h t n) and I&#x27;d think
        &quot;Shittin!&quot; or something, and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;d need.

        sune, then I did the 3rd corner, and it was oriented right, so I knew it
        was sune :D) PLL: R2 u R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; R u&#x27; R2 y&#x27;
        R&#x27; U R If anyone is interested in how I do this, please let me
        know. This solve I actually looked at each F2L pair as a possibility to
        execute at any given time. The memo took forever on PLL because I was
        looking at the edges all wrong. In the scramble (after I did the y&#x27;
        at the beginning) the colours were RED ORANGE on F AND B and Blue and
        Green on L and R the OLL had Red and Orange on F and B and Green and
        Blue on L and R. So I kept looking at it wrong and the corners for some
        reason I kept telling myself was a 2 cycle, duh I&#x27;m stupid :D
        Anyways, I will go again, hopefully get a sub-50 memo time, and a
        successful solve, because it bothers me that I&#x27;ve done it right
        each time, except not. This one I actually don&#x27;t know what I did
        wrong, it may have been that on Pair 2 I did an extra set of R U&#x27;

        memorizing and solving in different orders again. Yeah I agree -- the
        ending of cycles is always a real bummer, primarily if there are an even
        number of elements in a cycle. When I was trying PAO I used a null
        object to represent a premature ending of a cycle, so (a c) might be
        Angelina Jolie cursing at a zebra. The zebra begins with &quot;z&quot;
        so it obviously wouldn&#x27;t be confused with another corner/edge as
        there aren&#x27;t 26 of them, but it would show you that you&#x27;re
        dealing with (ac) and not something like (acz). But regardless it&#x27;s
        tricky to deal with in a short amount of time because you must also
        either find another even-elemented cycle to mess with or two corners to
        finish the cube. I&#x27;m inspired by your CP approach... I am beginning
        to think there&#x27;s a way to do CP without thinking about cycles or
        complex memory hooks. Do you get on Yahoo messenger at all? Anyways

        One of my goals for 2006 is to get a successful BLD solve on the 4x4. I
        just ended my 7th attempt or so...and I was soooo close to being my
        first successful solve. The time was 49:20.04 (30 min memorizing, 15 min
        solving is how most of my solves go--this one was about that), which is
        about average for me. I&#x27;m not looking for speed now--I&#x27;m just
        trying to get one done. Usually I make a mistake in execution and it
        looks like it was freshly scrambled, or like someone had just solved the
        centers. This time, I ended up a 3- cycle of edges from solved. The
        worst part is that it was the very last 3-cycle that i did wrong. The
        scramble was l B2 l&#x27; d&#x27; l2 F R&#x27; D&#x27; d l&#x27; b d2 L2
        l&#x27; D2 r&#x27; R2 d&#x27; U R&#x27; F&#x27; d&#x27; l&#x27; d&#x27;
        U2 B2 b&#x27; F&#x27; D2 F&#x27; r2 B r&#x27; d2 B2 d l&#x27; U2 f2
        d&#x27; (multi- slice with white on U, red on F which is how I always
        solve it). I did x&#x27; y2 so that I had 2 white centers and 2 green
        centers solved, plus some other stuff. I did the centers first without a
        problem. Then I did the corners, orienting and permuting with no
        problem. Then I started the edges. It was a 24-cycle, starting with UFr
        and ending with ULb. So I got to the end of the cycle (still no
        mistakes) and I had to do UFr &lt;--> ULb. Darn parity! So i decided,
        okay, i&#x27;ll do UFr --> ULb -->UFl and then do the pure OLL parity.
        So I did l2 r&#x27; D2 r U&#x27; r&#x27; D2 r U l2 and the OLL parity.
        and that&#x27;s where my mistake was. That cycle did UFr --> ULf --> UFl
        instead of the desired effect, so it switched UFr with ULf. Therefore,
        when I took off the blindfold, there was a 3-cycle of edges. I know
        exactly what I did wrong. I know how I should have done it (r2 l D2
        l&#x27; U&#x27; l D2 l&#x27; U r2). I knew all of that the second that I
        took my blindfold off. It&#x27;s just so frustrating to be that close to
        a successful solve but not get it. I&#x27;m going to try again today,
        and I really hope that I get it this time! Tim Reynolds

        Hi Tim, I feel your pain. The same thing happened to me when going for
        my first 5x5x5 supercube. It is indeed a very frustrating experence. On
        the other hand such an experience leaves NO DOUBT that you can do a
        successful solve - you are clearly already capable all you need is a
        nice clean execution. You might want to practice doing a few different
        parities blind on a solved cube just to get a strong feel for that
        potentially last but crucial move. Apart from that all I can say is
        don&#x27;t get discouraged and really keep your focus and concentration
        at all times for your next attempt. I am sure that you will have a
        successful run soon. Rob --- Tim Reynolds &lt;timothy.reynolds2@...>

      <strong>917. Why I love center blocks for big cubes BLD</strong><br />
      <em>From:</em> &quot;cmhardw&quot; &lt;foozman17@...&gt;<br />
      <em>To:</em> blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com<br />
      <em>Date:</em> Fri, 01 Sep 2006 02:51:38 -0000<br /><br />
      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I had a really fun solve on the 4x4x4 BLD just now, and
        wanted to share. I use center block cycles really often on the big cubes
        to speed up solving and memorizing, and this was a really cool solve as
        far as the center blocks go. The scramble was: b2 R&#x27; B&#x27;
        R&#x27; F r&#x27; B&#x27; L2 b2 D2 l D2 R2 L b f R&#x27; B2 F2 l2 f
        l&#x27; u d r&#x27; B2 d U2 b l2 D2 r d2 r&#x27; U b2 L r2 B&#x27; d2
        After the scramble I always rotate the cube to maximize solved centers
        as well as center blocks. The rotation I did was z, or if you don&#x27;t
        prefer xyz notation I rotated the entire cube as I would do the move F
        After the scramble and the z rotation I now have an amazing setup. I
        always solve viewing the cube to end with yellow on top and green on
        front. According to my solved scheme I have 10 centers already in the
        correct location without center blocks after that cube rotation. These
        pieces are lbU, lfU, ruF, ufL, buR, bdR, luB, lfD, rfD, rbD Including
        the way I am going to do center blocks there are 7 more pieces already
        considered in the correct spot (though I will need to cycle them later
        as blocks). These 7 extra pieces are: 1) Partial block pieces: dbL 2)
        Already formed blocks: (luF+ldF), (fuR+fdR), (ruB+rdB) I will cycle the
        center pieces individually like this first
        rbU->buL->rfU->ruF->dfL->ldB->lbD And that&#x27;s the extent of my
        individual center pieces cycling!! I already consider 17 centers to be
        solved including block pieces, so my cycle is only 7 pieces long! After
        cycling the centers in that fashion I will have created 2 block cycles.
        The block cycles are: 1) (luF+ldF)&lt;->(dbL+dfL) 2)
        (ruF+rdF)->(fuR+fdR)->(ruB+rdB) As far as memorizing this whole setup,
        it only took 2 journey locations! My single centers cycle that solves
        any single pieces, and sets up one block was:
        rbU->buL->rfU->ruF->dfL->ldB->lbD This converts to A->Q->D->F->T->P->U =
        Dan Aykroyd->Quidditch->Boba Fett->The Punisher And my image was Dan
        Aykroyd admiring a Quidditch players skills when suddenly Boba Fett
        shoots the gold scarab out of the air with his blaster. The punisher
        then puts his gun around Boba Fett&#x27;s neck to try to choke him (I
        imagine the Punisher is mad Boba Fett screwed with the Quidditch game,
        since he&#x27;s a fan). The center blocks were at my next journey
        location and I had 1) (luF+ldF)&lt;->(dbL+dfL) 2)
        (ruF+rdF)->(fuR+fdR)->(ruB+rdB) Which converts to: 1) F&lt;->T = Boba
        Fett 2) G->J->N = Tom Greene->Juggernaut (from X-men) And my image at
        that location was Boba Fett standing next to Tom Greene, who was messing
        around with Juggernaut from X-men trying to piss him off (bad idea) lol.
        Anyway I just thought that was a cool solve, having that many blocks in
        addition to lots of already correctly solved pieces was pretty cool and
        made for a fun solve. The time on that solve was 10 minutes 0.05
        seconds!! Aaaaah!!! If only I had done that stupid edge parity alg just
        a bit faster lol. Still the awesome center blocks are worth the
        allllllllmost sub-10 but not quite. Total time to memorize the cube was
        5:33.xx so the solving took 4:26.xx probably, which is a little faster
        than average for my solving phase (I love center blocks!!!) :-D Anyway
        that was just a fun solve, and in case anyone was still unsure of
        whether using block cycles is a good idea or not, I thought I would give
        an example to illustrate why I think blocks are so amazing ;-) Chris

        Hi everyone, Thanks for the words of encouragement; I&#x27;m pleased to
        say that after >10 DNF&#x27;s, I have finally succeeded! I spent about
        22 minutes memorizing, which is relatively fast for me. What usually
        happens is that centers take about 3-5 minutes, corners take about that
        long (to avoid mistakes), and edges take ~10 minutes. My total time was
        40:52.66, which is I think my second fastest time--I had one DNF less
        than 40 minutes. The scramble was l U b2 d&#x27; l D u2 r b2 U l R2
        u&#x27; B2 l2 d2 l d2 F2 d2 B&#x27; L&#x27; l&#x27; R&#x27; d2 L b&#x27;
        d U&#x27; F2 D R B2 u&#x27; f&#x27; D B D b2 l&#x27; (multi-slice, white
        on U, red on F which is how I always scramble + solve). I rotated
        y&#x27; z&#x27; to maximize solved centers. Thanks a lot, Stefan, for
        the parity alg: I used it in this solve. Thanks, Chris, for the
        motivation. Thanks, Rob and Craig, for the words of encouragement. Well,
        I gotta go. I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be trying the 5x5 pretty soon...

        Hey guys, I&#x27;ve been working on getting my BLD times down a lot.
        I&#x27;m learning new things daily, and working on concepts. The fastest
        Cycle I could come up with was this ... seriously too. M&#x27;U2MU2, and
        any isomorphic M Slice Case thereof. This would be a two step for
        solving the edges EO and EP. It is possible to do direct EP, but setups
        take a little more thought. Dir = Direct = No EO Indir = Indirect = An
        EO step 2x = Permuting 2 Edges per Cycle Slice Cycles can be used for,
        Dir, 2xDir, Indir, and 2xIndir on the edges. I&#x27;ve achieved sub-10
        BLD w/ 2xIndir, I&#x27;ll try the other three options. Ahhh I think I
        just realized how this can work. Well, we&#x27;re doing all these
        cycles, if we do Direct or Indirect Solving piece by piece, It is
        possible to solve the edges with this method: Set, M&#x27;U2MU2, Reset
        Set, U2M&#x27;U2M, Reset Set, M&#x27;U2MU2, Reset Set, U2M&#x27;U2M,
        Reset etc. Anybody interested, please look at it. Thanks Later, Daniel

        I&#x27;m really liking this. I think 1x direct has the potential to be
        much faster than Pochmann edges simply because of the shorter algorithm.
        I&#x27;ll try using it for a while. &quot;Shooting&quot; to BU when it
        needs to be flipped has annoying set ups though. I&#x27;m gonna look for
        a 3-cycle that does that without setup moves. -James Stuber

        2xIndir on the edges. I&#x27;ve achieved sub-10 BLD w/ 2xIndir,
        I&#x27;ll try the other three options. Ahhh I think I just realized how
        this can work. Well, we&#x27;re doing all these cycles, if we do Direct
        or Indirect Solving piece by piece, It is possible to solve the edges
        with this method: Set, M&#x27;U2MU2, Reset Set, U2M&#x27;U2M, Reset Set,
        M&#x27;U2MU2, Reset Set, U2M&#x27;U2M, Reset etc. Anybody interested,
        please look at it. Thanks Later, Daniel Beyer Yahoo! Groups Links

        You know setups aren&#x27;t all that annoying As I said before I was
        able to do a few successful 2x Indirect solves 1x Indirect could be very
        very fast 2 setup moves R?B&#x27; and L?B or Nothing for the edges if we
        were to target UB L?D or R?D&#x27; if targeting the DF *These two
        targets have different EO definitions* Using DF as the target and you
        have a &quot;misoriented edge&quot; Sets would be FL?F&#x27; F&#x27;R?F
        still not a bad comprimise! I don&#x27;t know what to tell you about if
        you target the UB directly. That&#x27;s sorta confusing. I also
        developed a &quot;simple 2 look EO&quot; This would entail Setting the
        UE layers to a known case, performing an alg, then rotating the D layer
        to the top and orienting the last D layer then resetoring the cube
        Setups for 2 Look EO would entail 3 moves to setup max, then reseting
        after performing both algorithms. Also I&#x27;m going to try and finish
        generating a Direct 3-cycle CP method that uses a lot of short
        algorithms. The system is 9 algs but that quadruples to 36 when you take
        into account inverses, reflections, and reflected inverses. If I learn
        all 36 algs, I can permute 2 corners per alg and only two move setups!

        Okay, so targeting DF gives less setup moves. I still hate doing the
        four setup moves for targeting DF when it&#x27;s flipped so: UB>FD: z F

        need those, I just hate setup moves :P I&#x27;m already getting around 4

        The great thing about learning your own work is ... its yours and it
        sticks to you. I hate learning OLL and PLL, it takes forever. But every
        algorithm I learned for BLD that I made, I still know and can use. If I
        can think of it all as PLL or F2L algs which I my reflections can flow
        very nicely for, this will be great. Inverses won&#x27;t be much harder.
        If I can find the time to learn them, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll know them
        very quickly, just as I did w/ my 12 Simul Block algs, sadly that method
        just didn&#x27;t work! James, lemme know how direct solving works for
        you. I&#x27;m going to be working on BLD most of the weekend. So
        I&#x27;ll probablly have all 12 SB algs at my finger tips, be solving w/
        Roux Cycles, and I&#x27;ll probablly have 9 CP algs memorized. And this
        system is meant as a Pochmann based method, you&#x27;re gonna keep the
        same buffer areas throughout the whole solve. So, if CP and Roux Cycles
        work as I hope I&#x27;ll use 54 algorithms .3 Roux Cycles - Applicable
        .3 2-Cycle CP - In Use .3 2-Cycle EP - In Use .9 Progressive Parity
        Fixing Algs - Applicable .36 3-Cycle CP - Not Ready .43 images -
        Applicable I&#x27;ve applied &quot;Applicables&quot; but not quickly
        Using 6 Algs, I can solve sub 6 BLD now. --- In

        I know it does have a different effect. However, by using the proper
        setup and M&#x27;U2MU2 (or is it U2M&#x27;U2M?) I can achieve the same
        result as the alg we just generated. I know what you did, and that it is
        the same algorithm. I&#x27;m just impressed that you looked for it at
        that angle, the difference in Turn metrics is what set the two apart.
        I&#x27;d rather do a different setup than use a longer alg. Just like if
        you want to target the F face of FL do: l&#x27; T-Perm l L Face of FL
        do: d&#x27;l T-Perm l&#x27;d same algorithm different setup. Now we
        could have done l&#x27; and the T perm that flips the edges too. So I
        think I&#x27;ll prefer to use M&#x27;U2MU2 and U2M&#x27;U2M alternating
        as an approach to EP why alternate? because you want to consider Keeping
        UF Solved once it&#x27;s been permuted, so just as the two corners keep
        being swapped back and forth in Pochmann while you are permuting the
        edges, well you keep swapping the UF between UB and UF using alternating
        slice cycles. I&#x27;m going to have to do some practice runs to make
        sure that I fully understand this correctly. And see what I can do w/ my
        old Progressive Parity Fixing algs. If any of you read on Simul Block,
        it&#x27;s those algs optimized. If there is a parity, I&#x27;ll directly
        solve the first corner and edge of the Cycles then do my EP and CP as
        normal. --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi, I just had my first successful 3x3x3 BLD solve! The time was
        23:52.98. Earlier I had another successful solve, but it was the 2nd
        attempt for a given scramble so I&#x27;m not counting that one. By the
        way, I recently posted on the speedsolving forum that I found the
        following commutator for twisting four corners (the four corners in the
        U layer): (R&#x27; D R&#x27; D R&#x27; D S) U2 (S&#x27; D&#x27; R
        D&#x27; R D&#x27; R) U2 but there were no responses to my post. I was
        wondering if this rather simple commutator has been mentioned anywhere
        else for twisting four corners without changing anything else. I
        haven&#x27;t seen it on any BLD sites I&#x27;ve looked at. For the other
        case of twisting four U-layer corners, I have come up with the following
        commutator, but some other (non-commutator) algs are probably better for
        this case. (L&#x27; R&#x27; D L R F B D F&#x27; B&#x27;) U (B F D&#x27;

        For more U &amp; R layer turns, you could do the the up-down mirror to
        twist the D-layer corners... R U&#x27; R U&#x27; R U&#x27; S&#x27; D2 S
        U R&#x27; U R&#x27; U R&#x27; D2 But that part in the middle with the
        S-slice turns still is a bit awkward. Even so, I think it is reasonably
        fast. It&#x27;s my impression that many BLD solvers don&#x27;t want to
        learn a lot of algs for BLD, and the commutator would at least be easier
        to learn than other algs I&#x27;ve seen (although people who know
        OLL/PLL algs may not find those others so hard.) So I think this may be
        useful for some people, but I wasn&#x27;t meaning to imply that
        it&#x27;s better for speed than other 4-corner twist algs. And I
        don&#x27;t recommend using the other commutator (L&#x27; R&#x27; D L R F
        B D F&#x27; B&#x27; U B F D&#x27; B&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; L&#x27;
        D&#x27; R L U&#x27;) with all the anti-slice moves that I came up.
        It&#x27;s a lot of moves unless you count anti-slice moves as a single
        move; and I don&#x27;t find it very easy to execute. It may be fairly
        simple to memorize, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it myself. --- In

        I know why images have been much slower for memorizing the 3x3x3 for me!
        Also, this means that I can speed up my memorization quite a bit for the
        bigger cubes too!! I was doing some 3x3x3 BLD solves using images rather
        than the normal stuff, and realized one difference between how I do it
        with images and with regular stuff. The difference was for images I
        often close my eyes to get a better mental picture at my journey
        location. I tried memorizing without closing my eyes, and found that it
        feels weird, but I think it is something I can get used to. This is
        pretty cool for the 3x3x3, but the really exciting part is that I could
        be so much faster at memorizing the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cube because I quite
        often close my eyes for long stretches to really cement in the picture
        at *each* journey location. If I could learn to do this with my eyes
        open the whole time, then I think I could really take a lot of time off,
        maybe a minute or so for the 4x4x4 and a couple minutes for the 5x5x5.
        Oh my God this is so crazy cool! I&#x27;m going to start trying to
        memorize solely with eyes open, or at least try to minimize how often I
        close my eyes to cement a journey location in my mind. It has been
        extremely frustrating for me to be improving my big cubes memorization
        times so much, and yet have that exact same images method slow me down
        considerably for the 3x3x3. Well now I think about it the other way, the
        way I am memorizing with images for the 3x3x3 is the exact same as for
        the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5, so I must need to improve my images method in
        general, which will also speed up my 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 times! My record
        for memorizing the 4x4x4 is around 3:10 I believe, so I think if I can
        get to the point where I can cement the images in my location without
        closing my eyes at all, then I might be able to get sub-3 for 4x4x4
        memo, which is even faster than the memory experts predicted! I&#x27;m
        going to work REALLY hard on this and try to post on how it goes. Wish
        me luck! I&#x27;d love to be able to memorize the 4x4 sub-3 and beat
        even the predicted times of the memory masters! I think memorizing the
        5x5x5 sub-10 would be possible too, my record for 5x5 is 10:30 for memo
        so I think this change could get me sub-10. Will try to update on how
        the open eyed practice goes with these images, I can&#x27;t believe I
        didn&#x27;t even realize the difference of how often I pause, with eyes
        closed, to cement a journey location in my mind. That would explain why
        my 3x3 is so much slower, and also the implications for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5
        are very exciting since I could probably be memorizing them so much
        faster without closing my eyes after each journey location! Holy crap
        BLD cubing rocks! Chris

        I just did 5 solves on the 3x3x3 using images and not closing my eyes
        during memorization. It still feels very weird to not close my eyes, but
        I can still picture the journey location as well as the cube and cement
        my images. I DNF&#x27;d all of the solves but one, as it still feels
        very weird, but I did notice that on one solve I memorized the EP and CP
        in 48 seconds (not including EO and CO). I also had one complete
        memorization in 1:10 and the whole solve including memo in 2:02.xx. That
        solve was a DNF with a few pieces out of place, but hey the DNF&#x27;s
        show where my solves are headed. The successful solve was 2:40.98.
        I&#x27;m going to keep practicing this, as I feel that I am memorizing
        much faster, I just need to get my accuracy up seeing as how this feels

        Hey everyone, I just tried doing images with eyes open for 4x4x4 BLD and
        the results are very awesome! My first solve was 8:10.57 but it was a
        DNF and was off by 3 edges. The second solve with eyes open was a
        8:22.58 successful solve with about 4:30.xx of memorization. It is
        fairly rare for me to be able to do two sub-9&#x27;s (even if one is
        DNF) in a row with closing my eyes to cement each and every journey
        location. I usually can get one, then all the other solves after it are
        much slower. I think this eyes open memorizing is the way to go,
        I&#x27;m going to work on it for the 4x4x4 and also for the 5x5x5 as I
        think the most benefit can come from memorizing eyes open for the bigger
        cubes. I also want to work on eyes open images for the 3x3x3 too, as I
        think I can at least get my images memorization to be faster and
        hopefully closer in time to the rote memory stuff I use when not using
        images. I&#x27;ll try to keep posting about my progress, but so far eyes
        open is now the only way I will try to memorize. I just still need to
        get used to it as it still feels a bit weird to memorize this way right

        Did some 3x3 solves using images with eyes open for memorization just
        now as well. 2:33.64 DNF 2:14.27 DNF 2:37.40 My times seem to be around
        what I get when I memorize with my old stuff. I need to work on my
        accuracy, and also it still feels weird to memorize with eyes open, but
        I think I am getting more used to it. I&#x27;ll try to keep updating if
        I get any cool times or anything. Well, at least this gives me renewed
        hope in using my images method for the 3x3x3 as a way to finally break
        out of this slump and finally be able to improve my times again. Chris

        Hey Chris, For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve always memorized with
        eyes open. I have a problem with distractions though. Visual, noise;
        both bother me. But I am most bothered by my wandering mind. Often I
        have a really hard time focusing on seeing my images for just a split
        second, as is usually recommended. Other things will just pop into my
        mind, like events of the day, etc., and right there I lose seconds from
        the memo phase. It&#x27;s quite annoying; I&#x27;m rarely &quot;in the
        zone&quot; that is critical for making images quickly. I wish I knew how
        to block out all the other clutter from coming in. I also wonder about
        the age factor, and the ability to concentrate. I&#x27;ve been at this
        for over 4 yrs now, and while certain things have improved, the ability
        to block out distractions while memorizing still lingers. But for speed,
        I think that eyes open would be the way to go. My ramblings, -Dave O.

        Hey Dave, That&#x27;s good to know that memorizing with eyes open has
        helped you. I posted on the memory sports group about eyes open vs. eyes
        closed to cement images and I also got the &quot;do with eyes open
        response&quot; from there too. Yeah I am also worried about visual
        distractions with this new eyes open technique. There has always been a
        lot of visual noise when I was memorizing in competition, so I imagine
        if I feel overwhelmed I&#x27;ll just close my eyes to cement a location
        and make sure I won&#x27;t DNF because of a memorization error. I&#x27;d
        rather memorize slower but not DNF under pressure than try to go super
        fast and DNF all my solves, which I&#x27;m sick of doing in competition
        lol, I&#x27;ve done it enough times already. I&#x27;ll probably start
        practicing in public more often now to see how I do with this eyes open
        technique in public. As for at home, I&#x27;ve already fallen in love
        with it. I did a 4x4x4 BLD solve just now, and almost beat my PB solve!
        The solve was slower than my pb by 0.02 second! The memorization took me
        3:53.xx and the total time was 7:52.99! I&#x27;m going to go try a
        couple 5x5x5 solves now and see how it goes. I&#x27;m not sure if
        I&#x27;m ready for eyes open for 5x5, but I figure I&#x27;ll try it
        anyway and either sink or swim lol. Thanks for the input though Dave, I
        respect your opinion on BLD related matters very much, especially with
        the times you put up as well as your crazy multiple cubes attempts. You
        really should try the bigger cubes too, they&#x27;re so much more
        addicting ;-) Thanks Dave, hope things are well with you, Chris --- In

        :&#x27;( I just got a DNF on 5x5x5 BLD, but it would have been a really
        good time :-( The memorization time was 10:59.xx and the solve was off
        by two +centers, everything else was perfect. The overall time was
        19:53.26 :&#x27;( That both motivates me so much more than any other
        solve I&#x27;ve ever done on the 5x5x5, and also makes me so angry I
        could scream lol. Alright, well at least my DNFs show the progress of
        where my solves are headed. I&#x27;m at least glad to know that
        it&#x27;s possible for me to get sub-20 on the 5x5x5 assuming I
        concentrate harder during the solve. But at the same time it sucks to
        get so close and yet be so far. I think it was an execution error, I can
        see where I switched one of my base pieces (the one that always starts
        the cycle) in one case, and left two pieces unsolved at the end. After I
        go scream into my pillow for a few seconds lol I&#x27;m going to go try
        again. Ok so I&#x27;m not really that upset, but I&#x27;m close lol.
        Alright, I hope to get a for real sub-20 soon. I memorized with eyes
        open while doing this, and it&#x27;s making it so much easier to
        memorize quickly for the bigger cubes. I&#x27;m glad I discovered this
        change. I only hope to be used to it enough to use it in competition at
        G-Wiz. Chris

        Alright after this post I promise I&#x27;ll shut up for a while. I did 3
        5x5x5 BLD solves in a row, I&#x27;m going to take a break tonight as
        I&#x27;m getting extremely frustrated, and would rather just start
        tomorrow when I&#x27;m fresh. The good news is that I correctly
        memorized a 5x5x5 cube in 9:57.xx so I finally got a sub-10 memo. I was
        able to recall the entire cube with the blindfold on. However, I&#x27;ve
        also been practicing going very fast and had an error during execution
        so some corners were unsolved, as well as some edges. The centers and
        central edges were all perfect. Anyway I have met at least one goal
        tonight, I memorized a 5x5x5 sub-10 and was able to still recall
        everything about it. I&#x27;ll continue to work on the eyes open
        memorization, it really does make it so much easier to get these
        superfast memorization times and yet still be able to recall later. For
        some reason I can actually picture my journey locations with the images
        in them much more clearly when I keep my eyes open, so I hope to get
        better at this. I&#x27;ll keep quiet for a while so I don&#x27;t clog up
        all the posts on this group. But I&#x27;m hoping for a sub-20 solve for
        real soon, and more sub-10 memorization times for the 5x5. Alright later

        I&#x27;ve been really really busy with work and college, but I&#x27;m
        still making the trip to Florida. Less than a month now! I plan to
        compete in every event that I have a puzzle for. This means I have to
        restring my magic just in case that event comes into play. I need to
        reassemble my revenge. Are eastsheens allowed?! I need to reassemble my
        222 if possible. I want to buy two DIYs, and resticker all my cubes.
        This I have to do on my own. However, I was wondering if somebody could
        help to explain 3-cycles for big BLD cubing. I&#x27;m a direct 2- cycle
        solver for 333 bld. I understand that I can use variations of
        R&#x27;FRB&#x27;R&#x27;F&#x27;RB and I can use
        l2dRd&#x27;l2dR&#x27;d&#x27; and variations thereof for cycles, but the
        only way I understand cubing is to permute 1 piece at time. So could
        somebody please explain 3-cylces to me. Only for big cubes. Like how
        would I easily set them up. And could somebody give me some well shaped
        3 or 5 cycles for big cubes. I really want to compete beside Chris ...
        even if it&#x27;s only for like 20-30 minutes. I wanna try big cube BLD
        at GWiz so bad! Later, Daniel Beyer

        Hey Daniel, I received your e-mail about the three cycles for the bigger
        cubes, I just hadn&#x27;t typed up a response yet. I&#x27;ll go ahead
        and respond here in case anyone else is interested too. I typed up a
        long post on the rubiks.has.it forum about how I mentally approach any
        three cycle for the bigger cubes. The link is http://tinyurl.com/pft5d
        That post is slightly outdated in that at the time I didn&#x27;t
        memorize with journeys but with my older style of images that I&#x27;ve
        since given up on. So don&#x27;t listen to anything in the part about
        &quot;why I solve in the order I do&quot; because all of that has
        changed. However, the section that describes what algs to use is still
        in date, only I&#x27;ve added a couple commutator types since then
        (Thank you Stefan!!) :-) The short version I&#x27;ll type here though.
        Given any three pieces to three cycle you must meet three conditions
        before you can start: 1) You must have two pieces on one layer, and one
        piece off that layer 2) The two pieces in one layer must be
        interchangeable - meaning you can put on in the place of the other just
        by turning the layer they are both on 3) You must easily be able to
        place the one piece off that layer into the spot of one of your two
        pieces. I give names for these to make it easier. The two pieces in one
        layer are simply called your &quot;two pieces&quot;. The third piece is
        called the &quot;lone piece&quot;. You will use this for either the
        &quot;lone edge&quot; or the &quot;lone center&quot;. To meet the last
        condition you have to look at both of your two pieces and see if you can
        place the lone piece into the layer, literally replacing one of your
        &quot;two pieces&quot; while affecting nothing else on that layer. Here
        is an example. I choose the three edge piece cycle lUB->uBL->bUL So
        let&#x27;s see what we have. We do have two edges in one layer and one
        edge off that layer. I&#x27;ll choose the two edges in one layer to be
        lUB and bUL which are both in the U layer. This means that the uBL edge
        is not in the U layer and so is called the &quot;lone edge&quot;. So I
        have met condition 1. However I have not met condition 2, the two edges
        in one layer are not interchangeable. I cannot turn the U layer and put
        one edge in the location of the other. So I need a setup move in order
        to make sure that I meet conditions 1,2, and 3. The setup move I will
        choose is b&#x27; After b&#x27; I now have the cycle lUB->uBL->bUR So
        let&#x27;s start over. Do I have two pieces in one layer and one piece
        off that layer? Yes I do, lUB and bUR are both in the U layer, and uBL
        is off that layer and is still my &quot;lone edge&quot;. Now do we meet
        condition 2? Yes we do, I can put the lUB piece into the spot of the bUR
        piece simply by doing the turn U. I could also put the bUR piece into
        the spot of lUB simply by doing the turn U&#x27;. So condition 2 is met.
        Do we meet condition 3? Condition 3 is that I must easily be able to
        insert the lone edge into the U layer to replace either lUB or bUR. The
        piece I choose to replace, it&#x27;s location, gets the name the
        &quot;action spot&quot;, meaning this is where all the action is going
        to happen. The action spot here is going to be bUR. This is because it
        is very easy to insert uBL into the action spot without messing up
        anything else in the U layer, you just do R&#x27; u2 R. This move places
        the uBL piece into the bUR spot. But notice that after our setup move
        that our cycle is now lUB->uBL->bUR That means that the uBL pieces was
        supposed to go to bUR, so we&#x27;re doing the cycle correctly. Now
        after placing the lone edge into the U layer, we have to interchange the
        two U layer edges. Do this with the move U, this will move the lUB edge
        to bUR which is the action spot. Now we have to place the action spot
        edge where the lone edge used to be. This is a commutator too, so make
        sure to do that in the exact reverse way that you first placed the lone
        edge into the action spot. So we&#x27;ll actually do this with R&#x27;
        u2 R. Now we need to undo our U layer turn to complete the commutator,
        which we&#x27;ll do with U&#x27;. Also remember that we started with the
        setup turn b&#x27; so we now have to undo that with the move b. Ok, so
        all in all we did the cycle lUB->uBL->bUL and we did this with the
        following commutator: b&#x27; R&#x27; u2 R U R&#x27; u2 R U&#x27; b Now
        I could have just given you the commutator for that particular case, but
        then I&#x27;d also have to give you the commutator for every other case,
        and to be honest there are too many to memorize. If you memorize this
        process for coming up with a commutator then you won&#x27;t view these
        as algs, but just as types of commutators. And one type of commutator
        can have quite a lot of variations and just one &quot;commutator
        type&quot; can really turn out to be around 50 or more algs. So for the
        bigger cubes, don&#x27;t memorize algs if you want to do three cycles.
        There are simply too many to memorize. Just learn the process for coming
        up with a commutator to fix your situation on the fly. Just my two
        cents, but I&#x27;ve found that knowing how to come up with commutators
        on the fly is very fast for me, and I don&#x27;t see any reason to just
        memorize a bunch of algs when you can have a 100% total understand of
        how you are using commutators to move pieces around, and your

        Thanks Chris. Well, less than a month now. I can&#x27;t wait to get down
        there and cube and see my aunt again! I think I&#x27;ll just focus on
        BLD for the competition. For my speedcubing events, I just want to get
        my records out there even though, and show a dramatic improvement.
        That&#x27;ll be hard because of all being so busy and being so lazy,
        I&#x27;ve been speedcubing for years and still don&#x27;t know OLL or

        [blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube] Re: GWiz Competition Preparation Hey
        Daniel, I received your e-mail about the three cycles for the bigger
        cubes, I just hadn&#x27;t typed up a response yet. I&#x27;ll go ahead
        and respond here in case anyone else is interested too. I typed up a
        long post on the rubiks.has.it forum about how I mentally approach any
        three cycle for the bigger cubes. The link is
        http://tinyurl.com/pft5d&lt;http://tinyurl.com/pft5d> That post is
        slightly outdated in that at the time I didn&#x27;t memorize with
        journeys but with my older style of images that I&#x27;ve since given up
        on. So don&#x27;t listen to anything in the part about &quot;why I solve
        in the order I do&quot; because all of that has changed. However, the
        section that describes what algs to use is still in date, only I&#x27;ve
        added a couple commutator types since then (Thank you Stefan!!) :-) The
        short version I&#x27;ll type here though. Given any three pieces to
        three cycle you must meet three conditions before you can start: 1) You
        must have two pieces on one layer, and one piece off that layer 2) The
        two pieces in one layer must be interchangeable - meaning you can put on
        in the place of the other just by turning the layer they are both on 3)
        You must easily be able to place the one piece off that layer into the
        spot of one of your two pieces. I give names for these to make it
        easier. The two pieces in one layer are simply called your &quot;two
        pieces&quot;. The third piece is called the &quot;lone piece&quot;. You
        will use this for either the &quot;lone edge&quot; or the &quot;lone
        center&quot;. To meet the last condition you have to look at both of
        your two pieces and see if you can place the lone piece into the layer,
        literally replacing one of your &quot;two pieces&quot; while affecting
        nothing else on that layer. Here is an example. I choose the three edge
        piece cycle lUB->uBL->bUL So let&#x27;s see what we have. We do have two
        edges in one layer and one edge off that layer. I&#x27;ll choose the two
        edges in one layer to be lUB and bUL which are both in the U layer. This
        means that the uBL edge is not in the U layer and so is called the
        &quot;lone edge&quot;. So I have met condition 1. However I have not met
        condition 2, the two edges in one layer are not interchangeable. I
        cannot turn the U layer and put one edge in the location of the other.
        So I need a setup move in order to make sure that I meet conditions 1,2,
        and 3. The setup move I will choose is b&#x27; After b&#x27; I now have
        the cycle lUB->uBL->bUR So let&#x27;s start over. Do I have two pieces
        in one layer and one piece off that layer? Yes I do, lUB and bUR are
        both in the U layer, and uBL is off that layer and is still my
        &quot;lone edge&quot;. Now do we meet condition 2? Yes we do, I can put
        the lUB piece into the spot of the bUR piece simply by doing the turn U.
        I could also put the bUR piece into the spot of lUB simply by doing the
        turn U&#x27;. So condition 2 is met. Do we meet condition 3? Condition 3
        is that I must easily be able to insert the lone edge into the U layer
        to replace either lUB or bUR. The piece I choose to replace, it&#x27;s
        location, gets the name the &quot;action spot&quot;, meaning this is
        where all the action is going to happen. The action spot here is going
        to be bUR. This is because it is very easy to insert uBL into the action
        spot without messing up anything else in the U layer, you just do
        R&#x27; u2 R. This move places the uBL piece into the bUR spot. But
        notice that after our setup move that our cycle is now lUB->uBL->bUR
        That means that the uBL pieces was supposed to go to bUR, so we&#x27;re
        doing the cycle correctly. Now after placing the lone edge into the U
        layer, we have to interchange the two U layer edges. Do this with the
        move U, this will move the lUB edge to bUR which is the action spot. Now
        we have to place the action spot edge where the lone edge used to be.
        This is a commutator too, so make sure to do that in the exact reverse
        way that you first placed the lone edge into the action spot. So
        we&#x27;ll actually do this with R&#x27; u2 R. Now we need to undo our U
        layer turn to complete the commutator, which we&#x27;ll do with U&#x27;.
        Also remember that we started with the setup turn b&#x27; so we now have
        to undo that with the move b. Ok, so all in all we did the cycle
        lUB->uBL->bUL and we did this with the following commutator: b&#x27;
        R&#x27; u2 R U R&#x27; u2 R U&#x27; b Now I could have just given you
        the commutator for that particular case, but then I&#x27;d also have to
        give you the commutator for every other case, and to be honest there are
        too many to memorize. If you memorize this process for coming up with a
        commutator then you won&#x27;t view these as algs, but just as types of
        commutators. And one type of commutator can have quite a lot of
        variations and just one &quot;commutator type&quot; can really turn out
        to be around 50 or more algs. So for the bigger cubes, don&#x27;t
        memorize algs if you want to do three cycles. There are simply too many
        to memorize. Just learn the process for coming up with a commutator to
        fix your situation on the fly. Just my two cents, but I&#x27;ve found
        that knowing how to come up with commutators on the fly is very fast for
        me, and I don&#x27;t see any reason to just memorize a bunch of algs
        when you can have a 100% total understand of how you are using
        commutators to move pieces around, and your blindfolded solve becomes an
        intuitive solve. That helps for noticing any errors, because you just
        get the feeling that &quot;I didn&#x27;t do something right&quot; or
        &quot;that didn&#x27;t feel right&quot; if you make a wrong move or use
        the wrong commutator. Hope that helps, and sorry for the slow response

        Chris, I&#x27;ve had this question on my mind for a while. When doing
        4x4x4 or 5x5x5 blindfolded, let&#x27;s say you have to switch two sets
        of two edges on the 4x4x4 or two wings on the 5x5x5. On the 3x3x3, this
        would be relatively simple, as there&#x27;s algs to do it, and the setup
        moves are minimal. On the larger cubes, however, while there is the PLL
        parity alg, I always use WAY too many setup moves. On the last 4x4x4
        blindfold I attempted, i had to do 11 setup moves to switch two sets of
        edges. Am I doing something horrendously wrong, or do I just need more
        practice? -Alexei Gousev

        Hey Alexei, I would not say you&#x27;re doing something wrong, I mean as
        long as a method works and solves your cube while you&#x27;re
        blindfolded then it&#x27;s a good method. I do think there is an easier
        way though. On the 4x4x4 or 5x5x5, assuming you keep the orientation of
        the cube fixed, there are (24 c 2) * (22 c 2) = 276 * 231 = 63756 ways
        to have 2 sets of two edges or wing edges to swap. Since there are so
        many I try not to memorize algs for those cases, because even if you
        memorize 100 algs you are still 63656 cases short of knowing all of them
        and you may still require a lot of setup moves. I do those 2 two swap
        cases as two three cycles, so I break it down to a problem needing 2
        steps to solve rather than solving all 4 at once. I&#x27;ll do this in
        permutation theory or notation or however you call it so that it will
        show how you solve any case. Say the 4 pieces I have unsolved are pieces
        A, B, C, and D. They are setup in two swaps like this: (A B) (C D) Which
        is to say that pieces A and B swap and pieces C and D swap. These could
        be any pieces on the cube. To solve this position I would first do the
        cycle: (A B C) = A -> B -> C -> A Let&#x27;s see how this affects our
        starting point of (A B) (C D) Piece A needs to go to the spot that piece
        B is in. Notice in our cycle that we send piece A to the spot where
        piece B is (A -> B -> C). Piece B needs to go to the spot where piece A
        is, but we instead sent it to the spot where piece C was. So now the
        location where piece C started needs to go to the location where piece A
        started. So we have C->A necessary to solve our cube. Piece C we sent to
        the location where piece A started, but piece C needs to go to the
        location where piece D started. So we now have A- >D necessay to solve
        our cube. Also we never touched the D piece, so it still needs to go to
        C. So we have D->C Let&#x27;s put all those pieces together to see what
        we have left: C->A; A->D; D->C And we see we have a three cycle:
        A->D->C->A or (A D C) So after the cycle (A B C) we then do the cycle (A
        D C) and we will have solved that two swap scenario. The way I remember
        how to do this during a solve is like this: Look at your 2 two swaps: (A
        B) (C D) and create a three cycle out of them in the order you memorized
        them. So for these I&#x27;ll say I memorized the cycle that now ends
        with (A B) before the cycle that now ends with (C D). I could have also
        just started with 2 two swaps, and let&#x27;s say if that happened that
        I still memorized (A B) before (C D). Now just read left to right
        creating a three cycle, so do (A B C) or A- >B->C By what we showed
        above we know that we will have solved location B, leaving only A, C,
        and D left to be solved. Now start with A again in your second cycle,
        but read the (C D) cycle backwards. So our second three cycle has to be
        (A D C). This is simply starting at A again, but solving the (C D) swap
        reading now right to left, so as D -> C. ------------ That was the long
        explanation of what we&#x27;re doing, but the short of it is that if you
        have the 2 swap (A B) (C D) then do two three cycles, and do them in
        this order: 1) (A B C) 2) (A D C) And you will solve that two swap case.
        This is also nice because you don&#x27;t have to memorize any algs, or
        often you don&#x27;t even have to do any setup moves. Just break down
        this harder problem into 2 cases, rather than trying to do it in 1 step
        like for the 3x3x3. That&#x27;s just my opinion, but personally
        I&#x27;ve found it to be faster than setup moves into a memorized case,
        and also faster than 2 applications of the parity alg to fix. Just my
        two cents, but I hope this helps. And good luck with your big cubes BLD!

        Wrong :-) Unless you care about the order of the two sets which seems
        unlikely since you don&#x27;t care about the order of the two pieces in
        each set. Stefan

        Hey Stefan, I think I see the error, but now I&#x27;m a bit confused.
        Would it be (24 c 4)*(4 c 2)/2 = 31878 Also if I count like I did the
        first way I could do (24 c 2)*(22 c 2)/2 = 31878 Also in response to
        your other post I do want to gather all my posts about big cubes BLD
        onto one page on my site, just for clarity of trying to read it, rather
        than half of it being on this group and half at the rubiks.has.it forum.
        That&#x27;s exactly why I said I hope I qualify for amateur
        mathematician, I love it but I&#x27;m no researcher and definitely

        2)/2 = 31878 Yeah that&#x27;s right. Your mistake was that you accepted
        (AB)(CD) as the same as (BA)(CD) but not as (CD)(AB). So you counted
        everything twice. Yet another way: 24C4 * 3 First you choose four, then
        you pair up the &quot;prettiest&quot; (your choice what that means) with
        one of the other three. Stefan

        Wow, that&#x27;s so much easier. I never thought about it that way.
        Thanks for your help! Also, on the 5x5x5 blindfold, let&#x27;s say you
        have to switch two corners. How, and at what point in the solve would
        you do this? To me, it would make most sense to wait until the end of
        the solve, and then do a T-perm, followed by the 4x4x4 PLL parity alg to
        fix the messed up wing edges. I&#x27;ve never actually had this
        situation come up yet, but I was wondering what would be the most

        Hey Alexei, Glad that helps, I actually had never thought to try that
        either until I posted on this group and someone said they did that case
        with two three cycles. I&#x27;m just glad to be able to help &quot;cube
        it forward&quot; a little bit ;-) As for when to swap the corners on a
        4x4 or 5x5 I have been saving them until the very end of the solve, but
        after reading your post I realized that&#x27;s not necessary. The most
        important thing to realize is that swapping two corners on a 5x5 (which
        also means 2 central edges need swapping) performs an odd permutation on
        the X centers of the cube. You can&#x27;t see this on a regular 5x5x5
        cube if it&#x27;s close to solved, but on the physical pieces you do in
        fact perform an odd permutation on the Xcenters when you swap two edges
        and 2 corners, even if you can&#x27;t see it. If you swap two corners on
        a 4x4 you have also performed an odd permutation on the Xcenters there
        too. I would say the easiest thing is to wait until after you have
        solved the centers, and then swap those two corners. This way the odd
        permutation on the Xcenters isn&#x27;t noticed, because your centers are
        all solved, and most algs for the corner parity only affect the centers
        on a given face, and don&#x27;t swap them between faces. I personally
        have been saving the corner swaps (and edges too for the 5x5) until the
        very end, but I just realized that this is unnecessary for the way I
        solve. When I first started big cubes BLD I solved the centers last, so
        I had to wait until the very, very end of the solve to swap the corners.
        Now I solve centers first, so if I have corner parity I&#x27;m going to
        start swapping the corners immediately after I finish centers rather
        than wait until the end of the solve. There&#x27;s no need to remember
        that information for the whole solve just to follow the tradition of the
        way I started solving when I think it would be much more efficient as
        far as the memory is concerned to just solve them immediately after the
        centers. And also I would say the same as advice for when would be best
        for you to swap corners too. Swap them immediately after you have
        finished solving the centers, that way you can forget about them for the
        rest of the solve. If you solve centers last, then I would say your
        safest bet is to swap the corners if you have corner parity as the very
        final thing you do in a solve. Just my two cents, Chris --- In

        Chris, In working w/ big cube BLD. I would have to say that I&#x27;m
        most interested freedom. Freestyle commutators are awsome. But I do
        2-cycle corners, so I&#x27;d seriously solve from the core outwards.
        Would it be possible to solve using a method like this. Ok, let&#x27;s
        start simple, the 4x4x4 Look at the Buffer Edge pair, UR. Look at the
        fUR edge, then use a commutator to shoot the other cubie of the edge
        pair to bUR. the cycle would be x --> bUR --> lUB Then use a 2 cycle to
        permute the solved edge pair, bring in two unsolved edges. Continue pair
        up the second edge using commutators and 2-cycles to permute the edge
        pair. This would be done w/ centers solved first. Is this method

        Hey Daniel, I think your method would be feasible, the only thing that I
        would wonder about would be how hard it would be to memorize. After you
        pair up one edge pair, and then use a 2 cycle to move it to it&#x27;s
        correct location, make sure you remember how the unsolved edge pair that
        you *do* move to UR is oriented when it gets to UR. Make sure you
        don&#x27;t swap which piece is in URf and which is in URb. I think this
        will be more moves than freestyle commutators, but if it turns out to be
        less thought, then you can execute your moves faster than someone doing
        freestyle commutators, since those require a lot of thought to setup
        each given cycle. I like your idea to solve the centers first, otherwise
        you have to keep track of how the center groups twist during your two
        cycles to swap edge groups, which will perform an odd permutation on the
        X centers (and +centers if on a 5x5x5). I think it has potetential to be
        a good method, just make sure to be careful about moving your unsolved
        edge group to UR and don&#x27;t swap which piece of the group ends up at
        fUR and which at bUR. Just my thoughts, but I think it sounds like a
        good method. Chris > Chris, > > In working w/ big cube BLD. I would have

        Hey Alexei, I just tried swapping the two corners on a 4x4x4 right after
        solving the centers (my first step after corners) rather than saving
        them until the very end of the solve. To be honest, I like doing it this
        way MUCH better than saving them until the end. I was able to forget
        about the corners halfway through the solve, since I had solved all of
        them, rather than remember them throughout the entire solve. I would
        definitely recommend, no matter how you solve the bigger cubes
        blindfolded, for the 4x4x4 fix corner parity *immediately* after
        finishing the centers. For the 5x5x5 fix the corner and central edge
        parity *immediately* after solving all the centers. Technically you
        could even do this before finishing the centers, say immediately after
        the U layer center group is completely solved (which often happens
        before all the centers are solved if you memorize your cycles right).
        However, I think it would be better to finish centers completely rather
        than break them up with the corner or corner+central edge parity fix.
        That&#x27;s just my personal opinion, but I think it would be better
        that way. My first solve trying to fix the corners immediately after
        centers was a successful solve with a total time of 8:12.46 minutes. The
        memorization took 4:05.xx and the solving took the rest, or about
        4:07.xx Just my opinion, but already I love solving this way, as you can
        devote the entire rest of your solve to everything else and not even
        have to worry about corners anymore, rather than remember them
        throughout the entire solve. Definitely solve them after centers is my
        recommendation. If you do solve centers last, then I would say save them
        until last, don&#x27;t break up your centers solve with the corner
        parity fix. Go ahead and finish everything, then fix the corner parity
        last would be my recommendation. Hope this helps, Chris --- In

        thread. I just tried fixing the corner+central edge parity for 5x5x5 BLD
        immediately after finish centers rather than saving it until the end.
        The solve was a success and the time is my new personal fastest solve
        for 5x5x5 BLD! The total time was 21 minutes 11.33 seconds, which broke
        down into about 11:15 memorization and 9:55 solving. The recall during
        edges, my very last step, felt so much faster. This was because I knew I
        could just go break neck speed having already finished the
        corner+central edge parity off right after the centers. I usually pause
        at the end of my edges step to make absolutely for certain that I am not
        forgetting the corner+central edge parity. This time I knew I had
        already completed the parity fix right after the centers and I just went
        break neck speed through the edges. A time of roughly 9:55 for the
        solving phase is actually quite good for me, and I attribute the fast
        time to the fact that I could more comfortably speed through the edges
        knowing I didn&#x27;t have to hold onto the corner+central edge parity
        information and not forget it to fix at the end. Knowing it was already
        fixed allowed me to comfortably speed through the edges to end the
        solve. So to answer your question, having tried the new way on the 4x4x4
        and 5x5x5 I say fix the corner parity for 4x4x4 and corner+central edge
        parity on 5x5x5 immediately after you have finished solving the centers.
        It speeds up the rest of your solve so much if the centers are not your
        last step to solve. If the centers are your last step to solve then I
        still believe that solving the corner parities are better after the
        centers are solved, so either way I think it is the best option. Again
        that is just my opinion, but after setting my new PB on the 5x5x5 BLD I
        think I am definitely hooked on this new solving order! Hope this helps!

        The edges are a greater problem for most in blindfold cubing, because
        there are more. So, perhaps, take the approach that I use. I look at my
        corner path first, I don&#x27;t spend much time on it at all. Less than
        15 seconds, maybe more if I have to make a bunch of decisions. Then I
        completely memorize the edges. Since I already have made decisions for
        the corners, I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing memorization of the
        edges. I use a Buffer Based method. I try to visually memorize via
        shapes. I look at the cube as like a spiderweb. Your cycle is like the
        spider stringing its web. Metaphorically of course. There are some
        pretty patterns to notice. There are some times when you&#x27;ll finish
        one layer of the webbing, then move onto the next string. Since I
        don&#x27;t use Orientation as a step to my solving method. In a 2-cycle
        method for blindfold cubing, such as Pochmann&#x27;s method, I feel that
        solving edges first is a lot faster, because the parity fix flows pretty
        nicely, because your are focusing on the edges still in a sense. Also,
        since I have very good recall on corners, I execute I feel I can do the
        corners last, even though I&#x27;ve spent a lot less time on them. If
        you are not using 2-cycles, I personally cannot give you any tips on
        nearly any part of your method. I&#x27;ve tried 3-cycles and do not
        understand the method. My memorization is an on the fly system. I count
        each piece of the cycle in the order that it comes, and I tap that
        piece. This recollection gives me fast recollection. At times during
        recall though, I do not even need to recall the finger taps, or the
        numbers, so I&#x27;m going to work on using the counting only, and use
        finger taps in case I need to reinforce a cycle. The benefit of counting
        is that I can keep track as to whether there is a parity or not, rather
        quickly, usually in less than 15s. Also, when scanning for cycles, I
        need to realize if there are permuted cubies, (orientation doesn&#x27;t
        matter). So if I count 10, permuting my 10th edge, and I get the buffer
        cubie again for the edges, this tells me that there is a permuted cubie,
        so I check to see if it was oriented or not. If there are permuted
        cubies that have a twist I memorize that piece as n&quot;O&quot; || n,
        [1,11] suchthat N is from 1 to 11. If I start a new cycle say
        &quot;skip&quot; tapping the new edge to start a cycle on. So skips do
        not count as a number! In summary, Scan what ever you find easiest to
        memorize Then memorize the harder path. Then quickly memorize the easy
        path. Execute the hard path. Execute the easy path. One thing we just
        discussed recently was keeping your eyes open while memorizing. Trust
        me, it&#x27;ll help a lot, so you&#x27;re not losing site of the at all!
        This was a problem for Chris Hardwick, who uses images for his memo.
        He&#x27;d close his eyes to cement the images into his journey path,
        causing him to lose time scanning for the next pieces. --- In

        Alright I&#x27;m reaching a frustrated point where I cannot improve my
        3x3 BLD times, and I have no idea what to do about it. I am literally
        completely clueless as to how to procede, I&#x27;ve tried everything I
        can think to do many times over so I wanted to ask and see if anyone had
        any ideas. I memorize the 3x3x3 in two very different ways, one of which
        is dominant and much faster than the other. My fastest and currently
        dominant way to memorize is completely visually. I will give names to
        certain types of cycles. For example the cycle UB->FL->DR I call
        &quot;layers&quot;. This is because no matter which of the 3 dimensions
        I slice the cube in I have one piece in each layer. I also have certain
        positions for corners too UBL->UFR->DFL is called &quot;clockwise&quot;
        things like that. I have names for the orientations as well, but nothing
        as sophisticated as what Marcus uses. UBR needing to rotate clockwise
        and UFR needing to rotate counterclockwise I call &quot;S&quot; or
        &quot;same&quot;. The opposites twists I call &quot;O&quot; or
        &quot;opposite&quot;. I have peaked at around 2:10 overall average
        memorizing this way, but I usually am more around 2:30 overall. I&#x27;d
        say I average 1:10-1:20 just to memorize, closer to 1:20 though. I then
        got into big cube BLD cubing almost exactly a year ago and learned my
        current images method about 6 months ago. So far with this method I have
        memorized the 4x4x4 in 3 minutes many times on successful solves, and
        the 5x5x5 in 10 minutes many times also on successful solves. This
        includes memorizing the corners for 4x4x4 and both corners and central
        edges on the 5x5 only with my usual visual memory system that I use for
        the 3x3x3 (since it is my dominant and by far fastest method). I figure
        if I can memorize the 3x3x3 in 1:20 and the 4x4x4 in 3:00-4:00 minutes
        that my 3x3x3 memorization must be way too slow but if you break it down
        into seconds per piece it&#x27;s the other way around, my 4x4x4 is way
        too slow also. The 4x4x4 has 56 pieces that I need to memorize the
        permutation of (or at least be aware when a piece is solved so I can
        know to ignore it). I also have to know the orientation of 8 pieces.
        That is essenitally 56+8=64 pieces of information. Memorizing in 3:30
        means that I had to memorize 64 pieces of information in 210 seconds, or
        3.28 seconds per piece of information. The 3x3x3 has 20 pieces where you
        need to know the permutation and 20 pieces where you need to know the
        orientation. So that&#x27;s 40 pieces of information. To memorize in
        1:20 means that I had to memorize 40 pieces of info in 80 seconds.
        That&#x27;s 2 seconds per piece of information. Looking at it this way
        it seems that I in fact am memorizing the 4x4x4 way too slowly. I should
        probably be doing around 130-140 seconds for the 4x4x4 or roughly
        2:10-2:20. 2:10-2:20 seems very fast for the 4x4x4, but why does 1:20
        not seem very good on the 3x3x3 compared to the top level world wide?
        Think about you sub-60 memorizers for the 3x3x3. Say you memorize in 40
        seconds for the 3x3x3, this means that you could memorize 40 pieces of
        information in 40 seconds. Using this logic you could memorize 64 pieces
        of information in 64 seconds, say 70 to be safe. So the 4x4x4 could be
        memorized in 70 seconds if you superstar 3x3x3&#x27;ers would just give
        it a try. I just don&#x27;t understand how after a year of focusing on
        basically just BLD solving, with enough practice to at least not be
        rusty on my other puzzle categories, that I have improved my 4x4x4 and
        5x5x5 BLD solving so incredibly much, and yet my 3x3x3 times have
        improved by maybe 10 seconds, if that. How do you 3x3x3 superstars
        average under 2 minutes for the whole solve? I&#x27;ve been 3x3x3
        BLD&#x27;ing for 3 solid years and hav broken 2 minutes on single solves
        maybe 5 times ever. Why do you superstars not do the 4x4x4 where you
        could memorize in 70 seconds, solve in 3:30 and get times around 4:45
        overall? I really am getting to the point that I am frustrated with my
        brain&#x27;s ability to memorize. I don&#x27;t understand what I am
        doing wrong, and it is really starting to make me angry. I at least feel
        like I can get to 2:10-2:20 for the 4x4x4 if I keep practicing and get
        to where I know the personality and behavior of every one of my images
        perfectly. But I think it is impossible, if not nearly so, for me to get
        to 40 seconds for the 3x3x3, even though they seem like equal feats of
        memory. Why is the 3x3x3 so hard and the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 so easy in
        comparison? What am I doing wrong?!?! Aaaaaah!! This really is driving
        me crazy and I really am getting very frustrated with myself at not
        being able to improve. Does anyone have any tips at all? I would very
        much appreciate it. Thanks for any help, Chris

        Hey everyone, I just tried a 3x3x3 BLD solve after posting this. I was
        extremely frustrated, even a little angry, at not being able to speed up
        my 3x3x3 BLD. I had on some loud angry music and just did a solve. I
        actually got my new pb solve on the 3x3x3 for 3x3x3 BLD! I got a 1:45.13
        with about 1:00 of memorization and 45 seconds of solving. So apparently
        the thing I hadn&#x27;t tried was to just get extremely angry at myself
        before doing a solve :-( Seriously though, what can I do to make getting
        solves this fast more common? I&#x27;d rather not go around being pissed
        off all the time, I&#x27;d prefer to just be able to concentrate that
        well when I try a BLD solve. Also, even on my pb solve I could only
        memorize right at 1:00 (I saw the clock change on netcube to 1:00 and
        shortly after I put on the blindfold). That is still memorizing 40
        pieces of information in 60 seconds, or 1.5 seconds per piece of
        information, which is still a far cry from 1.0 second per piece of
        information for 40 seconds of memorization. I am on the one hand
        extremely happy to break my PB (which has held since January 22 this
        year) but I&#x27;m also a little sad that to do it I had to get pissed
        off at myself for not being able to get faster. How can you just
        concentrate hard enough to get a solve that fast without having to get
        angry? I&#x27;m not an angry person, and I hate that I had to get angry
        to get a solve that fast. Thanks for any help, Chris --- In

        Hardwick, What&#x27;s up? umm ... how can you get faster without getting
        pissed? Well, when I was doing my best to BLD cube I would do a lot, I
        mean a lot of tedious or stressful things. Most were self inflicted.
        Such as pissing off my boss, or locking my keys in my car and then
        walking home. Now, like being angry all the time, why the hell would you
        want to do that?! Stressful events: 20 DNFs + 0 successes in one day
        Pissing off boss Car Breaking Down Locking Keys in car Eastsheen had
        it&#x27;s revenge ... the 4x4x4 popped =P The point that my speedcubes
        have popped 8 million times I believe what caused the personal best to
        occur, was not anger, it was mental stress. The blindfold element of the
        rubik&#x27;s cube is a mental thing. Memorization is mental. This can be
        very stressing, you become easily distracted, you don&#x27;t want to
        BLD. When you encounter this real world stress, you immerse yourself
        into the cube, because you love it. It&#x27;s like the cubezone as
        you&#x27;ve described before. Anger is a form of mental stress, I think
        part of the reason you were so successful, is because you were targeting
        your anger on the cube, because of the relationship you have with it.
        When angered your sense become dull, you are single minded. Minor
        distactions are insignificant. You will get the point across that you
        mean business. I feel living your daily life, is very stressful. Some
        read a book, so play games, some do drugs, we cube for that enjoyment,
        and removal from the world. Have you ever noticed this: Ok I feel great
        today, work was awsome, I just got my paychecks, my new cubes arrived,
        now let&#x27;s BLD ... any you don&#x27;t do so hot? It&#x27;s not that
        you&#x27;re having a bad day. It means you are not stressed, angered, or
        upset. And you do not know any other way to hone the focusing element of
        the BLD attempt. Another thing, do you listen to music while cubing?
        Music that you like?? Do you ever find yourself singing the words ...
        Seriously try several things. Start a solve. Turn on the music,
        television, a chat room (let the beep occur when somebody new enters)
        ... make sure you like everything that&#x27;s on. If you stop to watch a
        segment of whatever&#x27;s on tv, singing the words to the song, or in
        my case stopping to say hey when somebody pops into the chatroom. Stop
        the timer. See how long it took you to become distacted. Now something
        on the television that you&#x27;ve no interest in. Music that isn&#x27;t
        exactly your favorite ... better yet, try something such as classical or
        music w/o words. Linkin Park&#x27;s Session is a good example. The music
        can still help you relax. You are not as likely to start humming during
        your bld attempt. I think the point is, we&#x27;ve all tried avoid
        distractions. But why do we tempt ourselves with our favorite things?
        That&#x27;s like trying to quit smoking then going and getting drunk, so
        you wanna light up cuz you always smoke when you drink. You want to
        avoid distractions, so you&#x27;ll turn on your favorite music that you
        know every lyric to and you&#x27;ll start singing without thinking.
        However that is a distaction! I don&#x27;t know how they do it ... How
        I&#x27;ve made major improvements is practice. BLD is so amazing. How do
        you get so fast at blindfold cubing? I cut down my memo, execution,
        recall, and try to optimize algoritm execution. I&#x27;m going to go
        back to freeslice 2 Cycles. This is where instead of doing another
        2-cycle alg to start the next cycle, I&#x27;ll perform a move on the S
        slice. I&#x27;m also going to try Slice cycles for direct EP. I like my
        corner method, it&#x27;ll take me a long time to break my 2-cycle CP
        unless I learn my adv 3-cycle CP, which I just found the flaw in :( Well
        Chris, good luck in your competitions. I&#x27;ll see you in well 10 days
        from now!!!! Umm, I just read &quot;I had on some loud angry music and
        just did a solve.&quot; Well that&#x27;s fine, if that get&#x27;s you
        pumped. Just don&#x27;t be distracted by it! GL, HF, KA! Later, Daniel

        do you do it? Hey everyone, I just tried a 3x3x3 BLD solve after posting
        this. I was extremely frustrated, even a little angry, at not being able
        to speed up my 3x3x3 BLD. I had on some loud angry music and just did a
        solve. I actually got my new pb solve on the 3x3x3 for 3x3x3 BLD! I got
        a 1:45.13 with about 1:00 of memorization and 45 seconds of solving. So
        apparently the thing I hadn&#x27;t tried was to just get extremely angry
        at myself before doing a solve :-( Seriously though, what can I do to
        make getting solves this fast more common? I&#x27;d rather not go around
        being pissed off all the time, I&#x27;d prefer to just be able to
        concentrate that well when I try a BLD solve. Also, even on my pb solve
        I could only memorize right at 1:00 (I saw the clock change on netcube
        to 1:00 and shortly after I put on the blindfold). That is still
        memorizing 40 pieces of information in 60 seconds, or 1.5 seconds per
        piece of information, which is still a far cry from 1.0 second per piece
        of information for 40 seconds of memorization. I am on the one hand
        extremely happy to break my PB (which has held since January 22 this
        year) but I&#x27;m also a little sad that to do it I had to get pissed
        off at myself for not being able to get faster. How can you just
        concentrate hard enough to get a solve that fast without having to get
        angry? I&#x27;m not an angry person, and I hate that I had to get angry
        to get a solve that fast. Thanks for any help, Chris --- In

        I agree with Johannes the pieces of information you memorise in
        different cubes are different at difficulty and I don&#x27;t really
        memorise 40 pieces for the 3x3x3...I look for known patterns on CO, like
        a sune, anti-sune, a pi, the other one that flips 4 corners (forgot the
        name), 2 facing the same side or 2 facing oposite sides or 3 that will
        flip on the same way on L or R or F or B layer and for EO, I just
        memorise the wrong oriented ones, so it&#x27;s like 6 or 8 each time,
        not all the 12 the permutations are surely the hardest part (for me). I
        used to use numbers, but now I&#x27;m trying to use just visual memory,
        drawing the cycles. Sometimes the numbers pop into my
        head...haha...that&#x27;s funny, I must get rid of them....or maybe
        not...dunno I&#x27;m not regularly sub-2 min, I&#x27;m more like 2 min
        on avg...some times less, others more than 120 seconds. I guess that is
        more because of my solving time, that is usually over a minute...I think
        I need more consistant memorisation, so that I can execute the solve
        with almost no stops to think what&#x27;s coming next I hope this helps

        lately so I hope I&#x27;m at least catching up ;-) Also Marcus you need
        to make it to a competition man - my 12 minutes 4x4 record and 28

        Marcus&#x27; 20:03.44 on Ryan&#x27;s competition I would imagine the

        guess based on my own personal memorization times. My best ever
        memorization of the 5x5x5 was just under 10 minutes, and Marcus has
        always been consistently faster than me so I&#x27;d imagine he is at
        under 10 minutes fairly frequently? Marcus am I accurate here? Also I
        can memorize the 4x4x4 between 3:00-3:10 on a super awesome attempt, so
        I imagine Marcus has broken 3 minutes already? I&#x27;m guessing here
        and have no evidence to back this up, I just know Marcus you have always
        been faster than I am at the big cubes BLD. > > > Why do you superstars

        DNF on the 4x4x4 was about a 7:05.xx with only two centers swapped. So I
        think I can already get sub-7 soon, and I don&#x27;t think sub-6 is
        unreasonable with another year of practice. Who&#x27;s to say Ben
        Pridmore couldn&#x27;t get sub-5 with his amazing memory skills?
        Don&#x27;t knock it man, it&#x27;s totally possible. BLD cubing has so
        much farther it can go, we&#x27;re not even beginning to get close to
        the limits in my opinion especially for the bigger cubes BLD. Chris

        > > Hi Chris, do you use one image for 2 pieces by using your alphabet
        pairs? Or do you memorise one piece at a time? > > Mike Hey Mike, When I
        memorize visually I usually try to group the pieces together in groups
        of 2-4, but sometimes I have to just do one piece at a time for a
        stretch of 2-3 pieces. When I memorize with my images then yes I combine
        two pieces into a single image using the letter pair images I have. I am
        consistently much faster at memorization the first way only for the
        3x3x3 cube, or when I memorize visually. I am still trying to find ways
        to adapt my images method to be faster/better at encoding the
        information, but so far I haven&#x27;t found one yet. Another idea I
        have is to give each named group of pieces that I use for my visual
        memorization method on 3x3x3 an actual image. This will be a different
        image than any of my ones for letter pairs. This way instead of thinking
        the words &quot;clockwise&quot; for the cycle UBL->UFR->DFL I might
        picture a clock melting over a tree limb or something weird like that. I
        still don&#x27;t know which images I would use, but I am trying to think
        of using images in this way rather than letter pairs. I seriously doubt
        that I will switch from using letter pairs for the bigger cubes though,
        because it is just so easy to me now to encode a large number of pieces
        very quickly. I&#x27;m very, very comfortable with my images now and I
        see the image instantly when given the two pieces I need to encode,
        which I absolutely love. I still need to learn the behavior and
        personality of all my images to make them interact more quickly and in
        more regular patterns, but many of my images already have set
        personalities and behaviors so they interact with the surrounding images
        very easily in my mind and I can think of an interaction very quickly. I
        still haven&#x27;t been able to adapt the images to the 3x3x3 to be
        faster than my visual stuff, but I am working on it. I still believe
        that an images based method, if constructed correctly, would be faster
        on the 3x3x3 (same as how it is much faster on the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5) but
        I could be wrong. It&#x27;s just a belief I have. Chris

        :-) Like the others said, your way to measure the amount of information
        is flawed. Instead, take the logarithm of the number of possible states.
        The 4x4 has 7.4*10^45 states, the 3x3 has 4.3*10^19. So the 4x4 contains
        roughly 45/19 times as much information as the 3x3. Now do your memo
        time per piece calculations again. Suggested reading:

        pieces&amp;orientations per face; but that might hinder the ability to
        solve the cube quickly. If the challenge was: memorise a cube really
        fast then I would research, per face: 6x6x6 colours = 1 image of a
        person 6x6 colours = 1 of 36 actions 6x6x6 colours = 1 image of a person
        At 6 imaginary locations (1 per face), a person could act upon a person
        and represent the colours of the cube. On the other hand, instead of
        representing cube pieces with a pair of letters, how would you represent
        2 moves with a pair of letters? Is it feasible? How many unique terms
        are there like &#x27;UBL&#x27; within your current solution? 24 or less?

        you use one image for 2 pieces by using your alphabet pairs? Or do you

        visually I usually try to group the pieces together in groups of 2-4,
        but sometimes I have to just do one piece at a time for a stretch of 2-3
        pieces. When I memorize with my images then yes I combine two pieces
        into a single image using the letter pair images I have. I am
        consistently much faster at memorization the first way only for the
        3x3x3 cube, or when I memorize visually. I am still trying to find ways
        to adapt my images method to be faster/better at encoding the
        information, but so far I haven&#x27;t found one yet. Another idea I
        have is to give each named group of pieces that I use for my visual
        memorization method on 3x3x3 an actual image. This will be a different
        image than any of my ones for letter pairs. This way instead of thinking
        the words &quot;clockwise&quot; for the cycle UBL->UFR->DFL I might
        picture a clock melting over a tree limb or something weird like that. I
        still don&#x27;t know which images I would use, but I am trying to think
        of using images in this way rather than letter pairs. I seriously doubt
        that I will switch from using letter pairs for the bigger cubes though,
        because it is just so easy to me now to encode a large number of pieces
        very quickly. I&#x27;m very, very comfortable with my images now and I
        see the image instantly when given the two pieces I need to encode,
        which I absolutely love. I still need to learn the behavior and
        personality of all my images to make them interact more quickly and in
        more regular patterns, but many of my images already have set
        personalities and behaviors so they interact with the surrounding images
        very easily in my mind and I can think of an interaction very quickly. I
        still haven&#x27;t been able to adapt the images to the 3x3x3 to be
        faster than my visual stuff, but I am working on it. I still believe
        that an images based method, if constructed correctly, would be faster
        on the 3x3x3 (same as how it is much faster on the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5) but
        I could be wrong. It&#x27;s just a belief I have. Chris Yahoo! Groups

        Hey, Sorry I&#x27;ve been extraordinarily busy this year. Seven classes
        and three jobs @_@. I do check in once in a while. My times for BLD have
        actually gone down the crapper lately because I have not really done a
        whole lot of it -- I&#x27;d have to get back into the groove of
        relearning some algorithms and memory tricks. For the bigger cubes, at
        prime, 5x5 memorization was under 10 pretty consistently and sometimes
        under 7. I think the best way to speed up memorization, for any case, is
        to broaden your foundation for which you memorize. In other words, you
        need a system that you use over and over again such that you memorize
        the system. Then everything else simply fits into that system and
        becomes second nature. For example, if you have a consistent list of
        locations (ie. Location 1 = NYC, Location 2 = Pirate Ship, etc), then
        you have that much more information to use when you memorize order, for
        instance. Seeing a cycle A -> D -> H as your first cycle may translate
        to Arnold Dodging a Hamster while walking down a street in NYC.
        Something like that is not going to be easily forgotten. Not only is it
        quick to make up such a story by going from letters alone (heck the
        story&#x27;s made FOR you!), but it&#x27;s easy to not lose track. As
        you&#x27;re solving, you&#x27;d think, &quot;Alright, NYC. What happened
        here? Arnold was walking here... and he was dodging some hamsters.&quot;
        It may help to have different sets of PAO for different elements. I
        found this to be the most effective approach. For instance, a different
        set of people/actions/objects for wings vs. edges vs. XCenters vs.
        +Centers, etc. Takes a lot, but ultimately uses less than an extensive
        image system and is quicker once you pair it up with a premade location
        layout. When I have time I&#x27;ll try to get back into things -- I
        tried a BLD 3x3x3 a few minutes ago and got 2:45... forgot some algs and
        memory hooks. It comes back pretty quickly though assuming the system
        has been made. If you&#x27;d like I could get on YM and help you devise
        some systems that I&#x27;ve found useful for me, and you could modify as
        you see fit. Marcus Stuhr Wharton &#x27;09 University of Pennsylvania

        Stephan I&#x27;ve looked into the helper buffer method. I&#x27;ve been
        practicing my edges with two different Algorithms. 1. RU&#x27;R&#x27;[u]
        RUR&#x27;[u]&#x27; 1a. [u]RU&#x27;R&#x27; [u]&#x27;RUR&#x27; 2.
        RB&#x27;R&#x27;[b] RBR&#x27;[b]&#x27; 2a. [b]RB&#x27;R&#x27;
        [b]&#x27;RBR&#x27; The first is a very finger friendly algorithm. The
        second isn&#x27;t as fast for execution, however it much easier to
        visually comprehend the setups. This is because I use the UR, UB, and
        UBR cubies as my buffer 1x2x2 buffer area for 3x3 bld. Through my work
        with Simul block, I was able to quickly relate the edges coming into the
        buffer/helper area to flip and block cubies. I&#x27;m slowly correlating
        the the relationship of Block and Flip cubies with a x&#x27; rotation.
        As Stephan has said before, the setups are amazingly easy. With only
        permuting 1 cubie per algorithm, the setups aren&#x27;t on the fly
        anymore. I&#x27;ve a cubing theory with Chris. Where we pair up the
        edges and then use true 3x3 2 Cycles. This can be applied to the 4x4 and
        5x5. I&#x27;m trying to transform the 4x4 and 5x5 into a 3x3 then use
        3x3 2- cycles. The transformation is very possible, and can lead fast
        exeuction, however, perhaps a tedious first 12 edges memo. I just did a
        quick tranformation and I was quite happy with the speed. Also, when I
        get the helper cubie, I simple do the same setup alg. Alg 1 shoots the
        uFR to the U slice. This would shoot the helper cubie to the helper area
        (rUF). So then the next alg would be alg 1 again, this would permute the
        cubie that started in the helper area., then you&#x27;d start doing the
        inverse. Basically. By performing alg 1, you get get three results:
        Buffer Comes to the Helper - Start a new cycle by doing 1a Helper Comes
        to the Helper - Start the Helper Cycle by doing 1 Cubie Comes to the
        Helper - Continue the current cycle by doing 1a

        I&#x27;ll start by saying I am somewhat of a noobie at 3x3x3 BLD. (I
        practiced 2x2x2 BLD a little bit back in the &#x27;80s.) For EP, I
        currently use almost exclusively (U2) M&#x27; U2 M. I put the first U2
        in parentheses because it almost always cancels or partially cancels
        with the last move of the setup. I use DF as my &quot;buffer
        position.&quot; I set up the other edges to be used to positions UB and
        UF. I then do M&#x27; U2 M, and then move the edge at UF to the position
        where the edge set up to UB came from, while I also move the edge at UB
        to the position where the edge set up to UF came from. By doing the
        moves following certain rules, the net effect is: setup U2 M&#x27; U2 M
        inverse-setup. As for the number of edge 3-cycle cases, I wrote a GAP
        function to calculate that. The &quot;total&quot; number of cases is
        12*11*10*4/3 = 1760. (times 4 because the orientation of the 2nd and 3rd
        edge matters, divide by 3 since (A B C)=(B C A)=(C A B) ) Using the 24
        symmetries of the cube without reflections, I get that the 1760 cases
        are reduced to 76 cases. If mirrors are not counted as separate cases
        (that is, using all 48 symmetries of the cube), the number of cases
        drops to 40. If counting mirrors as separate cases, but not counting
        inverses as separate cases, then the number of cases I get is 43. If
        mirrors, inverses, and mirror inverses are all not counted as separate
        cases, then the number of cases I get is only 27. - Bruce --- In

        I have now used GAP to generate a list of all 76 edge 3-cycle cases. The
        table below lists all 440 3-cycles containing UF as an edge (with UF
        listed first). Generally, in a given 3-cycle, any of the 6 facelets of
        the three edges could be considered the U facelet of the UF edge
        position with an appropriate orientation of the cube. So there are
        generally six such 3-cycles for each case. Due to symmetry, there are
        four cases where there are only two distinct 3-cycles. The asterisks
        indicate one possible set of 27 cases that are distinct with respect to
        mirrors and inverses. 1. (UF,FR,FD) (UF,UL,RU) (UF,BU,UR) (UF,LU,BU)

        This is very amusing. Is it possible to make a memo system of 3 cycles??

        I am guessing you mean a way of memorizing these 76 edge 3-cycle cases.
        Well, if I were to try to do that, I would probably look at subdividing
        the 76 cases by counting how many edges are adjacent (UF would be
        considered adjacent to UR, for example) to the next edge in the 3-cycle.
        This would divide the 76 cases into four sets, with 0, 1, 2, or 3 such
        adjacencies. Then within each set, further subdivide the cases according
        to which ones are mirrors and/or inverses of one another. Then look for
        some methodical way of coming up with a &quot;canonical
        representive&quot; 3-cycle for each of these smaller sets. For instance,
        a canonical representative might be required to have adjacent edges
        before non-adjacent edges, in which case (UF,UR,UB) would be a possible
        canonical representative for the U-perm set, while (UF,UB,UL),
        (UF,UB,UR), or (UF,UR,UL) would not be. In any case, you would want to
        be able to take some arbitrary edge 3-cycle, such as (LF,LD,BL), and
        quickly figure out what its canonical representative would be. In any
        case, I am not claiming this is all that simple to do. I leave it as an
        exercise to the interested reader to explore this further. I was
        basically trying to answer one of Joël&#x27;s questions. Since it boils
        down to just 27 cases when considering mirrors and inverses equivalent,
        I think it is certainly possible to learn that set of cases. But it may
        take quite a bit of time to learn to be able to quickly recognize the
        cases for arbitrary 3-cycles, so this may not be all that practical of a
        system. - Bruce --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

      <strong>993. big cubes BLD center algs request</strong><br />

        Hi everyone, I have a question about algs for a few cases. I&#x27;m
        looking for cases that do the following: All algs are allowed to affect
        any other center. However, an alg has to leave each center group intact,
        but it can cycle pieces around within that center group, as long as no
        piece leaves its face. Algs cannot affect the wing edges, corners, or
        central edges at all though. 1) Switch only the four X-centers on the F
        face with only the four X-centers on the B face. They need not be done
        in any supercube order, just swap the 4 centers from one face to the
        other and vice versa. 2) Swap all the X centers from the U face to the F
        face and vice versa. 3 + 4) The same as #1 and #2 but for the + centers
        only. 5) Swap all the movable centers from F to B and vice versa 6) Swap
        all the movable centers from U to F and vice versa. I&#x27;m thinking
        about starting to use these cases to sort of do a type of weird pseudo
        block solving. I&#x27;ve a couple of these cases come up several times
        where it&#x27;d be really easy to setup based on how I&#x27;d have to
        memorize the cycles, but I didn&#x27;t know any algs for it so I never
        attempted it. If anyone has any cool algs for those cases I&#x27;d
        appreciate it. Also I&#x27;ve had some requests for my centers approach
        to the bigger cubes BLD, and no I&#x27;m not ignoring the e-mails,
        I&#x27;ve just been really busy at work lately. I plan on typing up a
        guide to how I handle them, similar to my guide for the edges. I&#x27;ll
        post about it once I&#x27;m done. Sorry for the wait, but I am not
        ignoring people I just don&#x27;t have a lot of free time lately. The
        guide is in the works basically and I plan on adding it to either the
        rubiks.has.it forum or to my site soon. Chris

        Hi Chris, You mean like: case 1: r2 (uEd&#x27;)2 r2 (uEd&#x27;)2 r2 E2

        To steal a video ? Where is my $, youtube.com is $0. Donné un sens plus
        probable me semble simple. Nous étions plusieurs qui cherchaient la
        source, MERCI beaucoup. Je n&#x27;ai jamais rien réduit et maintenant
        j&#x27;ai indiqué la source d&#x27;une vidéo qui mérite d&#x27;être vu
        et connu. Vous semblez fort dans la recherche du world web,
        j&#x27;imagine que vous n&#x27;avez pas vu un tv cube trick comme le
        mien AVANT moi. On WC 2003 « The odd magician guy at the RWC pretty much
        unscrambled the cube rather than solving it in a step by step manner. I
        would guess that he has a rehearsed unscrambling alg of a fixed number
        of moves, and a few holding pattern algs that he can insert so that his
        total number of moves equaled my given number. How do I know that he
        unscrambled the cube rather than solve it? First of all, his cube was in
        horrendous condition, and felt like it was lubed with pine tar. No self
        respecting cuber would stand for using a crap cube like that. Secondly,
        There was no solving method apparent. The cube was mixed then it was
        solved. No F2L, No layer by layer, no Petrus, no corners first. I should
        have had him attempt a regular solve on a real cube to confirm that the
        guy probably doesn&#x27;t know how to even solve the cube . Gaetan is
        actually solving the cube behind his back, and doing so rather
        skillfuly. &quot;

        a few holding pattern algs that he can insert so that his total number

        cube rather than solve it? First of all, his cube was in horrendous
        condition, and felt like it was lubed with pine tar. No self respecting
        cuber would stand for using a crap cube like that. Secondly, There was

        Fine, don&#x27;t call it stealing. The question remains, though. Why do
        you copy a video, reducing runtime and quality, instead of simply
        pointing people to the original? Stefan

        Hey Stefan, Bruce, Thanks so much for the help in finding some of these
        algs! I&#x27;ve very excited to start using them, basically I plan on
        solving the centers directly to one of the states that one of these algs
        fixes. I think this won&#x27;t come up often, but when it does come up,
        or is easy to setup, then it will make memorizing the centers a good bit
        faster. That&#x27;s awesome because it would make the whole time a bit
        faster since these algs are fast to execute when compared to 2-3 three
        cycles. I mainly want to use these algs for the 5x5x5, but I plan on
        using the Xcenter only versions on the 4x4x4 for swapping the entire
        center groups. I&#x27;m trying to get my average sub-8 for the 4x4x4,
        and I think these algs will at least help a little bit. I&#x27;m still
        not sure what my personal limits for the 5x5x5 will be, as I tend to
        practice the 4x4x4 more since it takes less than half as much time to do
        a solve on it. However, I plan on using these algs for the 5x5x5 as
        well. I&#x27;m still messing around with the algs you guys listed and
        trying to figure out how they work. Stefan I really like your (u2 l2
        r2)x2 alg a lot. And yes I feel dumb because it wasn&#x27;t obvious to
        me before :-( but now I see how it works. Bruce thanks for all your algs
        for the opposite centers cases, and the one for the two adjacent center
        groups! Thanks for the help guys, I really think these algs will help
        for the bigger cubes BLD! Chris --- In

        Hey everyone, I just had an idea to fix the edge parity and a center
        block at the same time. This alg is sort of the guts of one of the OLL
        parity algs. U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; (taken from the alg
        r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2) Consider a long
        cycle of edges (a 24 cycle) given as (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) What you
        can do, if you have center blocks on opposite faces, is to setup the
        case that the alg U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; solves. You
        would setup the lUB edge and the lUF edge to be the A and X pieces in
        the cycle. So you fix your center blocks, but you also swap the pieces A
        and X. In terms of the edge cycle that affects the cycle to create this
        new cycle: (BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) This is because the piece in spot X
        was supposed to go to A, and you sent it there. The piece in spot A was
        supposed to go to B, but you sent it to X. Therefore X now goes to B.
        This deletes only the A spot. But this is cool because you can reorder
        the cycle to be (XBCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW) And since I memorize by letter
        pairs anyway I haven&#x27;t affected any of my images, I have just
        switched my original first piece with what was originally the last
        piece, a really easy change to keep track of. Here is an example: I
        don&#x27;t want to type out the entire solve but I did an example solve
        on my 4x4x4. Basically on my cube right now I have solved the corners
        and almsot all the centers. There are 4 unsolved centers setup into this
        block cycle swap on the U and D faces (flU+frU)&lt;->(brD+blD) My edge
        cycles have edge parity, and there&#x27;s no need to write the entire
        edge cycle correctly, just the pieces that matter. So to give you an
        idea of the cycle structure for now I&#x27;ll just put my letters. The
        egde cycle is (QCHOER)(JBKFVPMXGW)(NDSILUAT) During the solve I would
        know this is parity on the edges because each of my three cycles ends
        with a single letter image, and since I have an odd number of single
        letter images I know I have parity. I think in general this might be too
        hard to notice, but I&#x27;ll talk more about that at the end of this
        post. Ok now here&#x27;s the idea. I would usually just swap the two
        center blocks with (rl&#x27;) d2 (rl&#x27;)&#x27; U2 (rl&#x27;) d2
        (rl&#x27;)&#x27; U2 and then later fix the edge parity when I come
        across it as (NT) at the very end of my solve. What I could do here is
        to consider if I can use that one alg above with my edge cycles. My edge
        cycles in terms of how I memorized them have starting and end points of
        (QR)(JW)(NT). These in actual piece names are (lUB lUF) (rUB dFL) (bUL
        lDF) Personally I think (lUB lUF) is easy to setup into this alg. I can
        use the setup alg: (f&#x27;b) L R&#x27; (fb&#x27;) Now I can apply the
        alg with U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; This leaves the cycles:
        (Q)(RCHOE)(JBKFVPMXGW)(NDSILUAT) I then undo my setup moves with:
        (f&#x27;b) L&#x27; R (fb&#x27;) Which accomplishes my goal. I have
        solved the center blocks I created on opposite faces. Also I have fixed
        edge parity. ------------------- I think in general this would be very
        hard to do, but I think the times when I would actually be able to use
        it during a solve are when I have either a 22, or a 24 cycle of edges.
        In this case it is very, very easy to determine parity, since you
        don&#x27;t have to look at but one cycle. During a 22 cycle solve, if I
        happen to have center blocks on opposite faces, I could likely use this
        alg. I think this won&#x27;t come up very often, but hey neither do some
        speedcubing algs either. I&#x27;m going to keep practicing this and see
        if I can actually use it during a solve one time. It seems like it could
        speed things up when it comes up since you fix center blocks and parity
        all in one short alg, with setup moves of course. Just a thought, it
        seems like a cool idea, but I&#x27;m not sure yet if it will actually be
        practical. Chris

        Chris, I&#x27;ve been reading with interest your posts on the memory
        group, and I can relate to what you&#x27;ve been posting. I&#x27;m too
        lazy to join that group, but I read the messages. As to rehearsing or
        going over your locations and images, I would say to just memorize them
        once with no going back. Since I don&#x27;t do the 4x, I may not be much
        help, but I know there is obviously more to memorize there. So I would
        think you&#x27;d want to take a bit more time at each location, but
        don&#x27;t go back over them. Try to make sure you really see the first
        image, because often just seeing the first image will trigger the rest.
        Gradually you can push yourself to go faster; if you start going too
        fast, just slow down again to find the right pace. As to verbalizing the
        images, I can really relate to that. I think it&#x27;s ok to do that, in
        fact using letters I find you almost have to. When I&#x27;m not
        concentrating well, I sometimes just verbalize the images. I often
        forget them this way, since I don&#x27;t have a picture in my head.
        However, I find I can sometimes get away with just using words without
        seeing a picture if the words themselves are memorable. For example,
        maybe it&#x27;s a person doing something and the combo is unforgetable,
        even if I don&#x27;t see the image. But if the words are too normal,
        like &#x27;cap&#x27; and &#x27;foot&#x27;, I usually have to make an
        image out of that, and even then it is sometimes difficult; sometimes I
        mix up the order too. So with the 3x, I usually use a combo of
        verbalizing and making images. The images are more reliable, but you
        have to make them quickly, and that&#x27;s the challenge for me. The key
        for me is not to spend too much time making an image. The memory experts
        do this in a sec or two, but I can&#x27;t do that too often, unless the
        image is a nice memorable one and I&#x27;m concentrating well. The
        problem is sometimes the image is no good, and I don&#x27;t recall it
        when solving. You have to find the right pace to make images and still
        be able to solve without taking too much time to recall the images;
        it&#x27;s a challenge for me. One thing I notice is I use a lot of
        people as images, and sometimes I mix them up. And I find I have some
        combos that don&#x27;t really work well together. Anyway, I can relate
        to your problems cuz I&#x27;ve encountered the same and am still working
        on them. -Dave O.

        It was great, I walked into walmart 2am Thursday morning, to get some
        groceries. I was wondering why there was a crowd in the lobby. I bought
        some cereal and milk, then I came back into the store. I started to cube
        in the lobby. The crowd looked towards me. They were shocked. I did
        about a dozen speedsolves, they were asking questions. They were quite
        amazed. I said, well lemme do this one last video, (some of them were
        recording me with their camera phones) Then I went to my car and grabbed
        my blindfold. I put my earphones in, and asked one of them to mix it up.
        They handed it to me, and I started to memorize it. It was insane, I
        wasn&#x27;t nervous, because the music was drowning out the
        environmental noise, and I was visually focusing on the cube. I did 5
        bld attempts. 3 were successful. The 4th I totally botched, I lost the
        recall shortly after doning the blindfold. The 5th, something odd
        happened. I permuted all of the corners, however, 5 of the cubies were
        misoriented. I use two cycles, so there was no misorientation error, as
        in that step. It was odd that 5 of the cubies were misoriented, when the
        recall felt so perfect. I mean if you forget one cubies orientation, and
        you guess wrong, that cubie and the cubie afterwards will be
        misoriented. However, I don&#x27;t know how I botched 5 orientations
        during a when I only had 6 permuations They all agreeded, that even if
        none of them got the PS3, they&#x27;d always remember that day, they got
        something great that day. Two of them were brothers, they actually
        bought a cube, and I told them how to solve it. I helped them understand
        the the cross permutation and f2l with working corner. Other than that
        highlight, I&#x27;ve had a really bad week. Maybe the stress levels of
        my normal life will kick me into the zone, so that the mental stess
        dimminishes even more, as it did for me a month ago with my last series
        of unfortunate events ... I can&#x27;t wait for Rutgers tommorrow!!

        do this one last video, (some of them were recording me with their
        camera phones) Then I went to my car and grabbed my blindfold. I put my

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been working really hard on the 4x4x4 for BLD
        lately, trying to really push myself to the limit. I&#x27;m trying to
        find out what works to really speed up this cube, then I plan to try to
        apply the same idea to the 5x5x5. Lately my times have been improving,
        and I really think a sub-8 average average will be possible with a few
        months more practice. I&#x27;m starting to get to the point where I know
        all of my images and journey locations really really well. I hardly ever
        have a delay in recalling what an image is given the two letters, and
        most of the time I not only recall the image but I&#x27;m comfortable
        with the personality of that image based on my previous solves, so I
        instantly know how to have it interact with the other images. I&#x27;ve
        found that what is helping me to get better times is to go REALLY,
        REALLY fast during both memorization and solving. By really fast, I mean
        to really push yourself way beyond your abilities. This leads to quite a
        lot of DNFs, and I mean a LOT. However you get to a point where your
        brain sort of gets used to going at this crazy break neck speed, and you
        just get this sort of click where you go &quot;I&#x27;m tired of getting
        DNFs when I go this fast, I know I can do this!&quot; Then really
        suddenly your accuracy comes back and you are not only accurate again,
        but a lot faster. I&#x27;m starting to average about 8:30 for the 4x4x4
        BLD with maybe a 66%-75% accuracy rate, and lately have been getting a
        decent number of sub-8 solves as well as sub-8:30 solves. I&#x27;m not
        posting this to try to brag, but to say that I really think for BLD that
        one of the best ways to improve is to push yourself to go MUCH MUCH
        faster than your brain can handle for both memorization and solving. I
        mean really push yourself, so fast that you actually are unable to
        complete the cube and DNF a lot. Over time though you will begin to
        adjust to thinking that hard that quickly and your times will come back.
        I know I haven&#x27;t posted in a while about BLD cubing in general,
        other than about algs or whatever. I really want to start posting some
        ideas on my site about what I&#x27;ve learned from BLD practice, but I
        wanted to post about this, since this strategy has really been helping
        me to speed up my 4x4 BLD. I don&#x27;t know if this applies as well to
        the 3x3x3, I really don&#x27;t consider that my strong point, but for
        the bigger cubes I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results of
        really pushing myself to the limit. Eventually your brain just gets used
        to doing this and all of a sudden you get this &quot;click&quot; moment
        where you can handle thinking like that. Just wanted to post, as lately
        I&#x27;ve had a big jump in progress and I really think I can get sub-8
        with more practice. I think the eventual limits for the 4x4x4 are sub-6,
        but just baaaarely. Like maybe 5:58 or 5:59, but I think it is possible.
        So sub-8 is a far cry from the total limit, but hey it&#x27;s step
        closer. I hope this helps anyone currently working on big cubes BLD, and
        also if this applies to the 3x3x3 I hope it helps there too. Happy
        BLD&#x27;ing everyone, and keep shooting for those DNFs. And yes I did
        just say that, try for the DNFs so that eventually your brain gets used
        to thinking at a faster speed and your accuracy comes back. Chris

        Hello, Rutgers went bad. Craig and I DNFd both solves. He and I were
        rather disappointed, that we were rushed, and unable to compete in a
        third solve, due to lack of time. It was really bad, because with
        success, Craig and I could have blown the others away. However, Congrats
        to everybody who successfully solved a cube at Rutgers! I didn&#x27;t
        compete in 4x4 bld as I had planned, I was way too tired. And I
        wasn&#x27;t successfully solving the 3x3 at all during practice today,
        so I tried to prepare myself, and left the 4x4 bld for another day. What
        I wanted to know from you Chris is what is this Journey system. I know
        the images, but I don&#x27;t understand a journey image. You&#x27;re
        walking a trail, and to significant landmarks, these would be the
        journey images? How could I go about making journey images? And what are
        they exactly, what role do they play in memorizing the cube? Is it to
        preserve sequence? cmhardw &lt;foozman17@...> wrote: Hey everyone,

        I also must agree! Pushing your limits on a long term scale increases
        your speed amazingly. You&#x27;ll first see a time reduction in your
        DNFs, you&#x27;ll start of with 3:00xx dnfs, then 2:4x.xx dnfs, then
        eventually sub 2:30 and sub 2! I&#x27;ve set my personal best of 2:35,
        and I wasn&#x27;t even close to these times at the competition. cmhardw

        I was wondering, what kind of moves do you use for 4x4x4 bld centers?
        3-cycles? I know a few center moving algs, but they mess with other
        centers. Just a few examples would be nice please. Thanks

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey James, I&#x27;ve had a few other people ask me this too, and I am
        trying to get a section about this on my website, but I&#x27;ll respond
        here for now so at least I can put something out for everyone to read. I
        use a three cycle approach, and I don&#x27;t use algs at all for the 4x4
        or 5x5 centers, I use the following intuitive process to come up with
        commutators: Setup: ------ 1) You must have two pieces on the same
        slice, and one piece off that slice. These are the &quot;slice
        pieces&quot;, and they are on the &quot;main slice.&quot; 1a) The two
        pieces on the main slice must be &quot;interchangeable&quot; (as per
        Doug Li), meaning that one piece can be placed into the position of the
        other with just a turn of that slice. 2) The piece not on the main slice
        is called the &quot;lone&quot; piece. This piece must easily be able to
        replace one of the slice pieces without affecting any other pieces on
        the main slice. The Commutator: --------------- Step 1) Place the lone
        piece into the main slice such that it replaces one of the slice pieces.
        The location in the main slice where you just replaced that piece is now
        called the &quot;action&quot; spot. It is literally where you will do
        all the work for this commutator. Step 2) Interchange the other slice
        piece &quot;the one you have not affected yet&quot; into the action spot
        by turning the main slice. Step 3) Undo the move you did in step 1 Step
        4) Undo the main slice turn you did in step 2 And that&#x27;s it. Ok
        here&#x27;s an example. The cycle is dfL->frU->blU->dfL and is just a
        three cycle. I literally think through all of the steps I listed above
        each time I encounter a three cycle. Setup: ------ 1) My &quot;main
        slice&quot; is the U layer. My &quot;slice pieces&quot; are frU and blU.
        1a) I can interchange blU to the frU spot by doing the slice turn U2. I
        can interchange frU to the blU spot by doing U2. 2) The dfL piece is the
        &quot;lone&quot; center. This is because it is not on the U slice. I can
        place the dfL piece, the lone center, into the blU spot by doing l&#x27;
        d&#x27; l. I can place the dfL piece into the frU spot by doing r&#x27;
        d r. Either move does not affect any other piece in the U layer, so it
        is my choice as to which to use during the solve. The Commutator:
        --------------- Step 1) I have to place the lone center into the main
        slice, such that I replace one of the slice centers without affecting
        any other piece in the U layer. I can do this in one of two ways. I can
        replace blU with the move l&#x27; d&#x27; l or I can replace frU with
        the move r&#x27; d r. I choose r&#x27; d r. The reason is because the
        dfL center is supposed to go to the frU center in this cycle. At this
        step I perform the moves r&#x27; d r. Step 2) I have now replaced the
        frU center with the lone center. Now the frU location on the cube
        becomes the &quot;action&quot; spot. I now have to place the other main
        slice center into the action spot. I can do this with the move U2. This
        moves the blU center to frU, and into the action spot. Step 3) I now
        undo the move I did in step 1. This moves the piece that was originally
        in the frU location back into the action spot. (Step 1 sort of moves it
        into limbo, and Step 3 brings it back). So at this step do r&#x27;
        d&#x27; r. Step 4) I now undo the main slice turn I did, the U2, with
        its inverse of U2. -------------- Final result: I performed the
        algorithm r&#x27; d r U2 r&#x27; d&#x27; r U2 for the three cycle
        dfL->frU->blU->dfL. ------------------------------------------ I do not
        have any algs memorized for either of the centers or edges step for
        either of the 4x4x4 or 5x5x5. I actually go through this process every
        time. Some types of commutators come up more frequently though, so in a
        sense I do have them memorized, but not as algs. I still think of them
        in terms of the steps above, I just sort of group many steps together if
        it is a very common case. If your current three cycle on your centers is
        not setup correctly, then you will need to do a setup turn, or maybe
        even two. Here is an example. Harder three cycle: -------------------
        dfL->drF->dbR->dfL This is a three cycle, but let&#x27;s look at the
        setup. Setup: ------ 1) My main slice is the inner d layer. However all
        three pieces are now &quot;slice&quot; pieces, and I have no
        &quot;lone&quot; piece. 1a) Any of the three pieces can be interchanged
        with any other with a d turn, so this part is ok. 2) I have no lone
        piece, this is a problem. Setup Fix: ---------- I have to fix the
        current state before I can go on, because I haven&#x27;t even satisfied
        the setup part. There&#x27;s no way I can do a &quot;freestyle&quot;
        commutator from this point. By freestyle commutator I mean the steps I
        have been describing here. To fix this situation I need to look at my
        current setup. The only thing wrong is that I have no lone piece.
        Everything else is ready to start. In that case I just need to turn one
        of my three d layer centers off the d layer. I choose to do this with
        the move f. Move performed at this step: f I have now placed the dfL
        piece on the U layer, at lfU. So my cycle is now lfU->drF->dbR->lfU. In
        this new three cycle I have to look at my setup: New setup: ----------
        1) My main slice is the inner d layer. My slice centers are the drF and
        dbR centers. 1a) I can interchange the slice centers with either a d or
        d&#x27; move. 2) My lone center is at flU The Commutator:
        --------------- 1) I need to place the flU piece into the d layer such
        that I replace one of the slice centers, and also such that I don&#x27;t
        affect any other piece on the d slice. I can do this with either r
        U&#x27; r&#x27; or b U2 b&#x27;. I choose to do this via r U&#x27;
        r&#x27;. This is because the lfU piece is supposed to go to the drF spot
        in this cycle. Move performed at this step: r U&#x27; r&#x27; 2) I have
        replaced the drF spot, so it becomes my action spot. I now need to move
        the other slice center into the action spot. I do this with the turn
        d&#x27;. Move performed at this step: d&#x27; 3) I now undo the alg I
        did in step 1 with r U r&#x27;. This brings the original piece that was
        at drF and places it in the action spot. It brings it back from being in
        limbo so to speak. 4) I now undo the main slice turn with d. Don&#x27;t
        forgot to undo the setup turn you did once you finish the commutator. My
        setup turn was f, so I now undo with f&#x27; --------- Final result: I
        performed the alg f r U&#x27; r&#x27; d&#x27; r U r&#x27; d f&#x27; to
        solve the harder three cycle dfL->drF->dbR->dfL. This isn&#x27;t really
        an alg though, notice how it was all very intuitive. You can understand
        the reasoning and the purpose behind every move. In fact you are
        literally coming up with this entire commutator on the fly. This does
        not require memorizing anything more than the process I&#x27;ve listed
        with each step and what you need to do at each one.
        ----------------------------------------- I hope this helps. I know
        it&#x27;s a lot to read, but that is exactly what I do for both the
        centers and edges. The only &quot;algs&quot; you have to learn are how
        to insert the lone edge into the main slice without affecting any other
        piece on that slice. That&#x27;s the only &quot;alg&quot; part, and all
        those algs are 100% intuitive and all only 3 moves long. If you want to
        solve using a three cycle approach I give this one my highest
        recommendation. My record solving phase on a successful 4x4x4
        blindfolded solve is about 3 minutes 22 seconds. My average is probably
        3:55-4:05 right now, and I am still improving. I think I can get my
        average sub-4 all the time with more practice and more experience with
        these commutators. Let me know if this helps, but that&#x27;s exactly
        how I approach the centers and edges of both the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes.

        Hey everyone, I normally try to keep from clogging the group here with
        posts about big cubes BLD, but I had to post about this. I just broke my
        record for 4x4x4 BLD with a new best time of 7:23.28 minutes! The
        coolest part though was the breakdown of the solve. The memorization
        took me about 4:25-4:26 I can&#x27;t remember which exactly. Let&#x27;s
        just say 4:26 to be safe. This means that I solved in 2 minutes 57
        seconds, a sub-3 minute solve while blindfolded! I was trying something
        new on this solve, and that was to memorize at my normal pace, but to
        try to plan ahead what my next step would be while executing the current
        step. 4:26 memorization is fairly average for me right now, maybe 5-10
        seconds slower than my overall average average for memo. But 2:57
        solving is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever done on the solving phase, by
        about 23 seconds! What I did was while I was actually performing a three
        cycle to try to not only see which images come up for my next three
        cycle, but to picture which pieces those are and also which three cycle
        I will use. I found that this meant that a couple times I did 2 three
        cycles one right after the other with hardly any delay between them!
        I&#x27;d like to get to the point where I can do this continuously
        throughout the whole solve, I definitely think it will be possible. I
        was thinking that to speed up I needed to work solely on memo, but this
        showed me my solving has a ways to go too. With my record 3:20 fastest
        ever correct memorization and this new 2:57 fastest ever correct solve I
        predict a 6:17 solve overall will be possible for the 4x4x4, and most
        likely even faster. I&#x27;m starting to really think that a sub-6
        minute overall solve might actually be a possiblity with another year or
        two of practice (for a best single time, not an average I mean). Yay big
        cubes BLD! This is so much fun! I really can see improvement in this
        just like in regular speedcubing. You don&#x27;t improve for a while,
        and then you make a big jump. Then you hit a plateau for a while and
        later have another big jump - just like speedcubing. I think you
        don&#x27;t really need a phenomenal natural memory right from the start,
        you can just treat it like speedcubing and practice a lot to get faster
        memorization times. Just had to post, I&#x27;m focusing almost entirely
        on my 4x4x4 BLD right now, but will eventually start trying to apply
        what I learn to the 5x5x5 as well. I really want to start getting sub-20
        minutes on the 5x5x5 fairly often before RWC2007, and averaging sub-8 on
        4x4x4 as well. Happy BLD&#x27;ing all! Chris

        Chris, First and foremost: &quot;I normally try to keep from clogging
        the group here with posts about big cubes BLD, but I had to post about
        this.&quot; First off, this is a blindfolded cubing forum. We are
        getting spammed with random crap from people that probably don&#x27;
        even cube. You&#x27;re posts are at least on topic. You&#x27;re not
        bragging either, you&#x27;re just keeping us posted. You&#x27;re making
        progress that is amazing. With, if you didn&#x27;t pioneer the bigcube
        blindfolded field, nobody else really would have. Just as when Gilles
        Roux and Thom Barlow pioneer&#x27;d the Roux method. Many more now use
        the method just because of a few persons&#x27; success with the method.
        You can explore many things, and they&#x27;ll be shunned. This can be
        discouraging, causing you to no longer develop the method, just because
        you never gave it the time to become fast before revealing your works.
        We&#x27;d talked about this in Florida. This also applies to literary
        arts, such as Moby Dick by Herman Mellville, nothing became of his works
        &#x27;til he died, same with Picasso. Anyway, I must give major props,
        because my visual edge permutation was taking me about 2:30! Keep us
        posted, and help us understand your approach to memo and execution on
        the cube as a whole. I&#x27;ve just modified my corner permutation
        method. I now use the left and right handed Y Perms, and the J perm
        conjugated. I changed my edge alg
        U&#x27;R&#x27;UL&#x27;U2RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2RL to
        LU&#x27;R&#x27;UL&#x27;U2RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2R Moving the L from the end to
        the Front. I realized that this was Pochmann&#x27;s alg, it was just a
        slow progress from my original
        F2L&#x27;U&#x27;LF2R&#x27;DR&#x27;D&#x27;R2. I did this so I could
        differentiate between the two J perms. My other change: Random Alg to
        Left Handed Y Perm
        zU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;R2UDR&#x27;U&#x27;RD&#x27;R2U2z&#x27; to
        L&#x27;ULUL&#x27;U&#x27;LFL&#x27;U&#x27;LULF&#x27;L&#x27; I found a
        powerful Optimization of the Y perms:
        RU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FR can be
        conjugated by R* Let G =
        [U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;F] The sum
        of the R at the start and the R at the end must equal R2 So if you do G,
        you must end with R2. If you do R&#x27;G, you must end with R&#x27; If
        you do RG, you must end with R and If you do R2G, you end with R*0 This
        just makes the execution flow so much better. I use a 6 alg system for
        blindfolded cubing. And I am very happy with the system. I&#x27;m also
        looking into 3-cycles for blindfolded. they are so powerful, I need to
        learn to use them efficiently! The MUD subset is very powerful. Good
        Luck Chris, and all blindfold cubist! Later, Daniel Beyer

        Hey everyone, So yeah the work on the webpage is not proceding very well
        due to my jobs :-( I really don&#x27;t want to be the guy that says
        I&#x27;ll write up some info but then never does. So, here is an example
        solve of 4x4x4 BLD - literally every single thing that goes through my
        head when I do a solve. Below is the scramble and the description of
        everything about the solve. Before you scramble please hold the cube in
        the same orienation you consider to be the &quot;solved&quot;
        orientation. This will make it much easier to follow along with what I
        am doing. Scramble: F B R2 b r D&#x27; B&#x27; d2 l&#x27; D2 b L&#x27;
        U2 L2 f d&#x27; F&#x27; b l2 U&#x27; d2 L&#x27; F&#x27; D2 B2 L f2 F2
        d&#x27; f&#x27; b d B2 b r2 D2 f U2 d l I actually memorized and solved
        this scramble before typing up this example to make sure I would write
        up exactly what I do, even during a real solve. The overall time was
        8:41.85 minutes, which is pretty much right at my average lately, which
        has been in the 8:40&#x27;s. The memorization step took 4:33 minutes and
        the solving then took 3:58 minutes. After the scramble I always rotate
        the cube around to find the position with the most centers already
        solved. After scrambling the cube I did the rotation z&#x27; x&#x27;. If
        you don&#x27;t like xyz notation I first rotated the whole cube
        counterclockwise as if I was doing the move F&#x27; and I then rotated
        the whole cube as if I was doing the move R&#x27; After the cube
        rotation I now have the following cycles on the cube: centers: lbU ->
        ufR -> ulF -> brD -> drB -> lfD -> rbU -> buL -> flU -> dbL -> urF ->
        dfR -> rfU -> drF -> dbR -> rfD -> dlF -> lbU edges: 1) (lBU -> fUR ->
        fUL -> lDB -> uFR -> fDR -> rDB -> bUR -> lUF -> dBL -> uFL -> uBR ->
        bDL -> dFR -> rBU -> lDF -> uBL -> bDR -> lBU) 2) (rUF &lt;-> dFL) 3)
        (bUL -> fDL -> dBR -> rDF -> bUL) I always memorize and solve in this
        order for the 4x4x4: 1) memorize center permutation 2) memorize edge

        solve center permutation 8) solve edge permutation During the
        memorization of this solve I debated memorizing and solving with center
        blocks on the F and R faces, but decided against it because I had
        already memorized one of the pieces I would have made a block out of
        into an image, and didn&#x27;t want to rewrite the first journey
        location any. ***************** MEMORIZATION STEP *****************
        center cycle: lbU -> ufR -> ulF -> brD -> drB -> lfD -> rbU -> buL ->
        flU -> dbL -> urF -> dfR -> rfU -> drF -> dbR -> rfD -> dlF -> lbU
        center cycle in letters: A -> I -> E -> V -> O -> W -> B -> Q -> C -> S
        -> F -> K -> D -> H -> L -> X -> G -> A The journey I was using was
        halfway through one of my 28 location journeys. This particular journey
        is a walk from my dormitory my junior year of college through to my
        class on the other side of campus. At each location I need to put at
        least three images, sometimes more which does happen on this solve
        during the edge memorization. Let me walk through each location one at a
        time: Location 1: ----------- This location is outside the dining hall
        with a bunch of tables and chairs. At this location I have the letters
        AIEVO. I take the very first letter and give it a single letter image
        (famous person). This is so I know which piece is the first piece of
        every one of my three cycles. The letter is &quot;A&quot; so the image
        is &quot;Dan Aykroyd&quot;. Ok, so now I have to take the letters in
        pairs after the first image is made. The next two are IE which is the
        Internet Explorer logo, only about 6 feet tall. The next two letters are
        VO which is a 2 foot tall Volcano that is spewing and erupting a huge
        column of ash. I put these images in a left-to-right order. So on the
        left Dan Aykroyd is rolling a giant 6 foot tall model of the Internet
        Explorer logo onto the top of the two foot tall volcano to clog it up
        and make it stop erupting ash everywhere. That&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t
        really view the motion, it is just implied. I see the tables and chairs
        and the dining hall very clearly in the background, and in the
        foreground I see Dan Aykroyd (motionless) in the act of rolling the
        Internet Explorer logo onto the volcano. I picture the logo about 3/4
        the way up the volcano, so that the volcano is still to the right of the
        Internet Explorer logo, which is to the right of Dan Aykroyd. Location
        2: ----------- This location is beside a wall about 20 feet away from
        the dining hall on the way to a set of stairs. At this location I have
        the letters WBQCSF. I now take letters in pairs always to make double
        images. The letters WB form the image of a giant 6 foot tall spider web
        between two large tree limbs. The letters QC form the image of a two
        foot tall Quaich. The letters SF form an image of a 4 foot tall model of
        the San Francisco Golden Gate bridge. At this location I can very
        clearly see the wall, as well as the hand railing leading to the
        stairwell that is the next location (all in the background). In the
        foreground I very clearly see (in left to right order) a giant web where
        a Quaich is falling into it having rolled off the end of the miniature
        San Francisco Golden Gate bridge. Location 3: ----------- This location
        is at the bottom of the stair case pictured at the last location. I view
        it from the top of the staircase, looking at the space just after the
        last step at the bottom. There are maybe 6 steps to this staircase. The
        letters at this location are KDHLXG. KD forms the image of Billy the Kid
        the famous gunslinger. HL form the image of Satan as described by Dante
        in Dante&#x27;s Inferno. The only difference is my image of him is about
        5 feet tall instead of the massive proportions Dante gives him. The
        letters XG form the image of Gambit from the X-men (the guy who charges
        stuff with energy and the object then explodes after a few seconds).
        This image is graphic, but this is exactly how I memorize. I picture, in
        left to right order, Billy the kid drawing his pistol and quickly
        unloading all 6 rounds into Satan, who is trapped in the ice as in
        Dante&#x27;s Inferno. This doesn&#x27;t kill Satan, but only wounds him.
        To the right of Satan Gambit charges a playing card (his usual weapon)
        and places it in the mouth of Satan. When the card explodes it explodes
        Satan&#x27;s head and blood and guts are thrown absolutely everywhere.
        Yes this image is graphic, but because of that it was very easy to
        memorize. Anything funny or violent tends to be easier to hold onto.
        ********** BLAST DOOR ********** Yes that literally is a blast door,
        like for a bomb shelter. I imagine a 200 foot tall steel blast door
        dropping down onto my journey in the space between the 3rd location and
        the 4th. I image that in order to get past the door I have to fly over
        it as if I were in a helicopter, and I literally picture this flight
        over the blast door. This is my marker that the centers are now done -
        i.e. when I get to the blast door during the solving phase, I know that
        what follows is now information for the edges. edge cycles: 1) (lBU ->
        fUR -> fUL -> lDB -> uFR -> fDR -> rDB -> bUR -> lUF -> dBL -> uFL ->
        uBR -> bDL -> dFR -> rBU -> lDF -> uBL -> bDR -> lBU) 2) (rUF &lt;->
        dFL) 3) (bUL -> fDL -> dBR -> rDF -> bUL) edge cycles as letters: 1) (Q
        -> F -> E -> S -> D -> H -> L -> M -> R -> U -> C -> B -> P -> X -> J ->
        T -> A -> O -> Q) 2) (I &lt;-> W) 3) (N -> G -> V -> K) Location 4:
        ----------- I am now memorzing the edge permutation. This location is at
        a &quot;+&quot; shaped intersection of two very large walkways leading
        into one of the quads on my school that is a very large enclosed
        rectangular space formed by about 8 buildings. I can clearly see the
        open space of the quad, as well as the two walkways at this location.
        The letters at this location are QFESD. I need to know which piece will
        be my main piece, or the one that will be the first piece in all of my
        cycles, so I take the first letter &quot;Q&quot; and make it into an
        image. The letter Q goes with the image &quot;Queen&quot;. I now take
        the letters in pairs after the first piece. The next two letters FE form
        the image of a 10 foot tall Ferris Wheel. The next two letters SD form
        the image of a 10 foot long Star Destroyer (like from Star Wars) that is
        floating in the air about 6 feet above the ground. In left to right
        order I see the Queen hiding behind a miniature Ferris Wheel while a
        miniature Star Destroyer bombards it with lasers and explosives of all
        kinds. The ferris wheel is on fire and so decrepit it is about to
        collapse. Location 5: ----------- This location is part-way down a
        pedestrian walkway that goes into the center of the large quad we are
        now in. I can picture a big tree and a small wall to the right. At this
        location I have the letters HLMRUC. HL stands for the Satan as portrayed
        by Dante again. MR stands for Marvin the paranoid android from
        Hitchiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy (as portrayed in the movie). UC
        stands for a Unicorn. In left to right order I see Satan frozen in the
        ice trying to frighten Marvin the android, who could not be more
        unimpressed. Satan gets pissed off about this, so he posesses a unicorn
        just to the right of (behind) Marvin and has the Unicorn ram it&#x27;s
        horn through Marvin&#x27;s head, effectively killing him. Location 6:
        ----------- This location is the center of the quad, where the two
        largest walkways meet at a sort of tall skinny &quot;X&quot; shape. I
        can see the buildings on the other side of the quad as well as a very
        big tree to the left at this location. Here I have the letters BPXJTA.
        BP stands for a backpack which is oversized (about 6 feet tall) and
        filled with 100&#x27;s of regular sized books. XJ is the image of
        Jubilee from the X-men. TA is the image of a tank with it&#x27;s gun
        turret pointed menacingly at the object next to it. In left to right
        order I see a backpack lying on the ground, filled to the brim with
        books. Jubilee is using her sparks to completely destroy the backpack
        which is now on fire and billowing smoke everywhere. Behind her a tank
        aims and takes a shot from it&#x27;s huge gun turret but Jubilee ducks
        out of the way just in time. I normally stop after three images, but
        this time I see that the next piece, the &quot;O&quot; piece, goes to
        the &quot;Q&quot; spot and completes this cycle. Instead of starting at
        a new location I tack on my single letter &quot;O&quot; image (Ozzy
        Osbourne) behind the tank, as if he were orchestrating the whole
        incident of the tank firing on Jubilee. This cycle is now finished. I
        know I am not done memorizing edges though, because I have only used
        three journey locations, and the average is 4 for edges. During the
        actual solve I looked around for an edge I had not used yet when I
        spotted the two cycle (rUF &lt;-> dFL) or in my letters that is (I
        &lt;-> W). Rather than start this image at the next journey location,
        since a two cycle is always just one image, I tack it on to the current
        location just behind Ozzy Osbourne, only surrounded by curtains on both
        the left and right. This is my miniature, within a journey location,
        form for the &quot;BLAST DOOR&quot;. It lets me know that the image
        within the curtains is a two cycle. I got this idea from John Louis, so
        thank you very much! The image for IW is a &quot;Y-Wing&quot; space
        fighter from Star Wars. Within curtains I imagine the Y-Wing taking aim
        at Ozzy Osbourney (through the curtains) to take him out and make him
        stop firing on Jubilee with the Tank. REHEARSAL: ---------- OK so I know
        I have used a 3 locations, and a little more since there are 5 images at
        my 3rd location instead of the usual 3. I know that I am not done, but I
        have no idea how many edges are left to look for. So I go over my images
        (just for edges). I sort of half use this as rehearsal for my edges and
        half to just count them and find out how many edges I have memorized
        right now. I counted 20 edges when I went back through my edge images. I
        now glance quickly at the cube to see that no edges are already in their
        solved locations - I saw none. So I know that there are 4 edges
        somewhere to look for. I find them and they are in one cycle, which I
        put at my last location. Location 7: ----------- This location is on the
        other side of the quad. I am very close to the buildings that before
        were only in the background. At this location I have the 4 cycle
        (N->G->V->K->N). I take the N and make it into a single letter image,
        that of Chuck Norris. The GV I put together as a giant Gavel, about 6
        feet tall. Since I only have one piece left, the K, I make it into a
        single letter image of Chris Katan from Saturday Night Live. In left to
        right order I see Chuck Norris roundhouse kicking a giant Gavel so hard
        that it slams into Chris Katan and knocks him over. ****END OF
        JOURNEY**** I now know that I am done memorizing the centers and edges,
        since I have accounted for all 24 edges. I now memorize the Corner
        permutation visually and the Corner orientation visually. Then I put on
        the blindfolded. ************* SOLVING PHASE ************* Solving the
        corners is pretty uninteresting I think, since you can just use the same
        stuff as from the 2x2x2 or 3x3x3. The only change is that you *HAVE* to
        use supercube safe algs (algs that don&#x27;t rotate center caps if done
        on a supercube). Here is how I solved the corners: Corner orientation:
        y&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U R L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27;
        L&#x27; followed by U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; L&#x27;
        U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;
        U&#x27; R U R&#x27; L2 y or if you don&#x27;t prefer xyz notation the
        above is equivalent to F&#x27; U2 F U F&#x27; U F B U2 B&#x27; U&#x27; B
        U&#x27; B&#x27; followed by U&#x27; F U F&#x27; U&#x27; F U F&#x27;
        B&#x27; U&#x27; F U F&#x27; U&#x27; F U F&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27; F U
        F&#x27; U&#x27; F U F&#x27; B2 Corner permutation: 1) UBL->DFL->UFL : D
        F2 L&#x27; B&#x27; L F2 L&#x27; B L D&#x27; 2) UBL->UFR->DBL : (L
        B&#x27; L&#x27; B)x3 D2 (R F&#x27; R&#x27; F)x3 D2 3) (UBL &lt;-> DBR)
        and (UBR &lt;-> DFR) : F2 D (L&#x27; B L B&#x27;)x3 D&#x27; F2 Centers:
        -------- Ok time to actually solve the centers now. First location: Dan
        Aykroyd->Internet Explorer->Volcano A->IE->VO I start with Dan Aykroyd
        then I take the first image, Internet Explorer. Those are the letters
        AIE which is the cycle lbU->ufR->ulF : 1) To solve I use the commutator:
        [f&#x27; U&#x27; f, u&#x27;] I am here using the same notation I learned
        from Stefan and Per. [f&#x27; u&#x27; f, u&#x27;] means to perform the
        first part, then the second part, then the inverse of the first part,
        then the inverse of the second part. So [f&#x27; u&#x27; f, u&#x27;] =
        (f&#x27; u&#x27; f) (u&#x27;) (f&#x27; u f) (u) = f&#x27; u&#x27; f
        u&#x27; f&#x27; u f u 2) After Internet Explorer comes VO. So the cycle
        is now A->VO or lbU->rbD->drB. lbU->rbD->drB : D&#x27; r&#x27; [U&#x27;,
        b d b&#x27;] r D 3) Aykroyd->Web or A->WB or lbU->lfD->rbU : [b&#x27;
        R&#x27; b, l2] 4) Aykroyd->Quaich or A->QC or lbU->ubL : [U, l u&#x27;
        l&#x27;] 5) Aykroyd->San Francisco or A->SF or lbU->dbL->urF : L2 [f U2
        f&#x27;, u] L2 6) Aykroyd->Billy the Kid or A->KD or lbU->dfR->rfU :
        [U2, b d2 b&#x27;] 7) Aykroyd->Satan or A->HL or lbU->drF->bdR : [r U2
        r&#x27;, d&#x27;] 8) Aykroyd->Gambit or A->XG or lbU->rfD->dlF : r2 [b
        d&#x27; b&#x27;, U&#x27;] r2 Centers are now solved. Notice that only
        three of the three cycles required setup moves. One of the three cycles
        required two. Average number of setup moves needed before being able to
        perform a commutator was 4/7 or 0.57 moves. Ok now I realize that I have
        run into the blast door. So I know that the next stuff I recall deals
        with edges. Edges: ------ The first location has me recalling Queen,
        then the very next image is a Ferris Wheel. 1) Queen->Ferris Wheel or
        Q->FE or lBU->fUR->fUL : [R B&#x27; R&#x27;, f] 2) Queen->Star Destroyer
        or Q->SD or lBU->lDB->uFR : R [U&#x27;, B d B&#x27;] R&#x27; 3)
        Queen->Satan or Q->HL or lBU->fDR->rDB : [B2, U&#x27; f2 U] 4)
        Queen->Marvin the Paranoid Android or Q->MR or lBU->bUR->lUF : F&#x27;
        [B d&#x27; B&#x27;, U&#x27;] F 5) Queen->Unicorn or Q->UC or
        lBU->dBL->uFL : [L2, F&#x27; l2 F] 6) Queen->BackPack or Q->BP or
        lBU->uBR->bDL : [U b2 U&#x27;, B] 7) Queen->Jubilee or Q->XJ or
        lBU->dFR->rUB : l [B&#x27; d B, U2] l&#x27; 8) Queen->Tank or Q->TA or
        lBU->lDF->uBL : F2 [U2, F&#x27; u&#x27; F] F2 performed as F2 U2 F&#x27;
        u&#x27; F U2 F&#x27; u F&#x27; 9) Queen&lt;->Osbourne and Y-Wing OR (Q
        &lt;-> O) and (I &lt;-> W) or (lBU &lt;-> bDR) and (rUF &lt;-> dFL) Done
        as two three cycles 9a) [r&#x27; D&#x27; r, U2] 9b) [U2, B d&#x27;
        B&#x27;] 10) Chuck Norris -> Gavel or N->GV or bUL->fDL->dBR : [b&#x27;
        R&#x27; b, L2] 11) Chuck Norris -> Chris Katan or (N &lt;-> K) This is
        edge parity. To solve I did: f&#x27; D&#x27; f y&#x27; r2 B2 U2 l U2
        r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2 y f&#x27; D f The cube is now
        solved. The three cycles averaged at 4 setup moves in 11 cycles or 0.36
        setup moves per three cycle. Parity used 3 setup moves, which is
        probably average. A lot of cases require 4 setup moves if you want to
        preserve centers. If you don&#x27;t mind not preserving centers you
        might average 2.5 setup moves for parity.
        ----------------------------------------------- Hope this helps. I tried
        to include absolutely everything, and looking back over it that is how a
        BLD solve feels to me. I double checked this message about three times,
        and the solve and scramble work. If you work through the solve and it
        doesn&#x27;t work try again, because I double checked and there are no
        typos in the scramble alg or in the stuff about solving. Chris

        Excellent example. I didn&#x27;t do the scramble, but I read it all the
        way through. I must go and practice now. It&#x27;s been a while since
        I&#x27;ve tried memorizing the 4x4 or 5x5. I&#x27;m finally
        &quot;trying&quot; to learn OLL and the G Perms. Once again, though,
        Blindfolded cubing is taking precedence. I agree, why solve the corners
        first? However, I&#x27;m not confident in my big cube blindfolded
        abilities yet. So I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;ve chosen this way.
        Perhaps it just feels better. Just as different memorization methods
        feel better. I did just realize that he&#x27;s posted before about
        blindfold solving a cube and he messed up the Corner Permutation, when
        the rest of the cube was perfect. So perhaps he&#x27;d rather use short
        term memo for his corners in BLD. --- In

        Hello everyone, After some 3x3, I&#x27;ve started the 4x4 bld a few
        months ago, to see if I will be able to solve it without a particular
        training (for memory especially). Then after a few DNFs, I solved my
        first one with a time of 36min, then my second one in 24min. I was of
        course very happy, but also surprised that i was able to memorise the
        whole cube quite easily in less than 10 min with the same kind of
        memorisation as for the 3x3, that is to say a stupid visual memorisation
        of the cycles and of the orientation of the corners. I am certain that
        the memorisation techniques that chris and the others are using is very
        efficient, but I&#x27;m wondering if I can keep my own way of memorising
        the cube and still solving it very fast. What do you think ? So I will
        start practicing seriously for now, and we will see if I&#x27;m right to
        continue in that way :) . Clément

        I took the time yesterday to make several blindfolded attempts on the
        4x4 cage. I believe I made three. I sat down to memorize one and I was
        distracted by a mediocre chore, so I stopped. My Second attempt, I spent
        about 13 minutes memorizing the cage and I go for the solve. I had the
        scramble perfectly memorized. I start corner permutation first, and I
        messed up the exectution of my first corner alg. I was doing the left
        handed Y perm. And everything just felt wrong! I stopped then and there
        ); ... My third attempt I did at my grandmother&#x27;s just before work.
        Memo 16 minutes; Execution 13 minutes. I recalled everything perfectly.
        There was no 3x3 or 4x4 parity. However, I messed up a setup. Once again
        it felt wrong. I tried to fix it. The error occurred in the last 6
        edges. It was so close! I have a long way to go. There was one cubie I
        was lost on during the final execution. I recalled the chess game. I
        recalled the accelerated math class lesson. After permuting 15 cubies I
        start a new cycle. I started at lUB. So I recalled: &quot;Skip to Mu;
        Dragoon&quot; ... very long pause ... another pause ... ohh,
        &quot;Dragoon becomes King.&quot; &quot;Lamba, Ace, Galanoth, Mu&quot;
        Solved The rUF was permuted by default, that&#x27;s my 4x4 reference
        point. The lUF was solved too. Resulting in 21 permutations + 1 new
        cycle = no parity. I was glad that I was able to recall the King image.
        That cycle equals: Skip to lUB; fUL->rDB->lDB->rUB->bUL->lUB; Haha, I
        just realized another life adventure. I can cause my images to have
        accidents that my families experienced. Such as my 3yr old sister
        cutting all of her hair off, or my getting ran off the road last week. A
        brother getting injured on 4th of july. Later, Daniel Beyer --- In

        I was wondering the same thing. Each cubie has an image I associate it
        with. Rather than journey&#x27;s through life as Hardwick uses, I take
        life lessons or experiences. Such as progressing through math, from
        addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, trig, and derivatives.
        I&#x27;d imagine a Huge A, B disappearing, thousands of C, a small D, E
        doing something repetitive, and F accelerating extremely fast. If I
        progressed to a 2-Letter system. That math class would cover half of my
        edges. The chess game lesson would cover the other half of my edges. I
        need more life lessons. And I just figured out my image for my last
        edge, I can imagine the image in a cage. Letting me know the edges are
        done. I pair off into groups of 6, so that I don&#x27;t really have to
        count. I just can do multiples of six, and recall how many cycles
        I&#x27;ve started. Later, Daniel Beyer --- In

        Hey Daniel, Clément, When I keep posting about big cubes BLD I&#x27;m
        not trying to imply that my memorization method is the best, just that
        of all the things I&#x27;ve tried, for me, I like this method the most.
        I think it would be better for everyone to discover which method they
        like the most, but I would recommend trying different things to get a
        broad perspective. Clément as for memorizing without a technique, I
        think the limits of this for 4x4x4 BLD are sub-10 minutes. My record
        solve using a story method chain-link image method for centers and
        completely visual memorization for the edges and corners was very low 12
        minutes. I knew then with more practice I could have gotten low 10
        minutes, and looking back on it now I know I could have gotten sub-10
        with enough practice. So Clément to answer your question the limits of
        4x4x4 BLD without a trained memory technique I know will be sub-10, but
        I don&#x27;t know how much more beyond that (sub-9, sub-8) etc. But I
        can say with confidence that with enough practice sub-10 would be
        possible with completely visual memory techniques. I would try to use
        this method in a competition though and see what you think. Personally I
        did use this method at the Chattahoochee Spring competition and found it
        very difficult to forget the information from previous solves while
        memorizing the current cube. However I have this problem on the 3x3x3 as
        well. So if you don&#x27;t really have a problem with this on the 3x3x3,
        then I think it would be easier for you to overcome on the 4x4x4 than it
        was for me. Daniel, It definitely looks like you have good ideas for how
        to improve your memory technique, I&#x27;d say to just keep doing
        whatever you&#x27;re doing, since it is working! Seriously though keep
        up the practice, that&#x27;s about all it takes to bring your accuracy
        up. You just need to get your brain used to memorizing more and holding
        onto more info, but eventually a 4x4x4 BLD solve will feel like a 3x3x3
        BLD solve, it will just take longer to do is all. As for the little
        tricks you&#x27;re doing to remember the ends of cycles, and grouping by
        6 so you don&#x27;t have to count, definitely keep looking for stuff
        like that, and personalize it so it has more meaning for you. The only
        thing I do want to say is don&#x27;t let DNF&#x27;s bother you. For the
        3x3x3 you can view a DNF as a failure and it be ok and just move on and
        try another solve. But since so much work goes into a big cube BLD solve
        to view a DNF as a failure is extremely frustrating. I would suggest to
        have a more graduated scale. 1) Solved. Yay! 2) DNF but veeeeeeeeeeeeery
        close, off by two pieces or so (usually means you forgot one piece
        during recall) 3) DNF but fairly close, maybe 8 pieces off (usually
        means you missed one setup turn in the middle or near the very end of
        the solve) 4) DNF but messed up pieces are all of one type. Messed up
        pieces are all edges, or centers say. This usually means you made a
        memorization error or maybe even cycled the wrong pieces a few times for
        that type of piece. However you still solved the rest correctly, so be
        happy for that, this wasn&#x27;t a big mistake. 5) DNF but one type of
        piece is completely solved. A lot went wrong here, but most likely it
        was due to memorization or recall errors, since one type of piece is
        completely solved. 6) Complete and total utter chaos DNF. When you first
        start on the big cubes this usually means a lot went wrong. Once you are
        more comfortable though this almost always means you messed up a setup
        turn or something on your very first step of the solve, which would
        throw all of your cycles completely out of whack and make the end result
        look completely scrambled, even if you did still recall and solve the
        memorized cube correctly. So either way DNFs can be boiled down to a
        certain number of mistakes. Try to think of how many mistakes went into
        your DNF, and at which steps they are. This will help you keep your
        sanity, because DNFs really do come up much more frequently on the
        bigger cubes, even if you&#x27;re certain you did the solve correctly
        (everything felt perfect), you can still get DNFs from not even
        realizing you forgot one piece in your cycle, stuff like that. So
        don&#x27;t worry about DNFs, just expect them to happen more often and
        you&#x27;ll keep your sanity lol. Happy big cube BLD&#x27;ing! Just
        remember, DNFs suck that much more on the bigger cubes, but successful
        solves feel that same amount better than a successful on 3x3x3 :-) Chris

        question is why you do not do the corners last? Hey Marcus, I&#x27;ve
        just found that I really like solving them first so during memorization
        I can just barely memorize them, just long enough to put on the
        blindfolded and solve them. There is one major downside though, if I get
        corner parity, I have to wait until after I solve the centers before I
        can fix it since an odd permutation on the corners must also perform an
        odd permutation on the centers (supercube-wise). I&#x27;ve found though
        that if I use auditory memory to help me remember I have parity in the
        corners it helps a lot. Once I know I have corner parity I literally say
        out loud &quot;corner parity&quot; and I have found that it usually
        sticks in my mind long enough for me to finish centers, and still
        remember that on this solve (not the one before) I have corner parity,
        since it&#x27;s still ringing in my head so to speak. It&#x27;s just a
        personal preference, I know solving them last would be fast too, since I
        wouldn&#x27;t even have this corner parity problem, but I prefer to do
        it this way after trying both. Chris

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I mentioned in this thread http://tinyurl.com/sgru3 about
        how to skip a forgotten cycle and come back for the cycle method, and I
        finally had my first successful solve on 4x4x4 BLD doing this! The
        overall solve time was 8:55.68 which is awesome considering I forgot an
        image for over a minute and still finished sub-9! To be clear I
        wasn&#x27;t sitting there doing nothing for over a minute trying to
        remember that image, I skipped it and kept solving with the intent to
        fix it later. Here was my edge cycle: (QJHFBAWTMDURXCKNOSPEI)(VG)(L) The
        image I forgot was DU or the Duke mascott. So in my head during the
        solving phase I had this memorized: (QJHFBAWTM??RXCKNOSPEI)(VG) Now it
        seems like I could just figure out that I was missing pieces
        &quot;D&quot; and &quot;U&quot; since I had remembered that
        &quot;L&quot; was the solved piece and every other piece was unsolved.
        However this is much harder to do than it would seem, I have to go
        letter by letter and search my journey to see if each image contains the
        current letter I am looking for. What I did was to use the pickup cycle
        method I talked about in that earlier thread. After doing the cycle
        (QTM) I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to remember that forgotten image any
        time soon so I immediately skipped to the cycle (QRX). This changed my
        edge cycles to: (R??)(QCKNOSPEI)(VG) and the (R??) cycle would become
        (RDU) assuming I could remember the forgotten image. This way I could
        continue solving the cube while trying to remember the image I forgot.
        When I was actually performing each three cycle I would think about
        which letters I had used, and also I tried picturing the scene at that
        journey location to see if I could recall what was there. Right as I
        finished performing the cycle (VG) which was the parity alg, I sort of
        saw in my mind&#x27;s eye the D piece and remembered I hadn&#x27;t used
        it, then I remembered the U piece and put them together to get my DU
        image, and I finished the cube with the cycle (RDU) and the cube was
        solved when I took off the blindfold! I just wanted to post because
        until today this idea was only theory for me, and I had never actually
        successfully used it on a solve where I forgot an image. I&#x27;m happy
        that I was able to actually pull it off on a solve! Pickup cycles are
        the way to go, because instead of sitting there doing nothing until I
        remember the image, like I used to do, I now continue the solve and try
        to remember the image while doing something mindless like actually
        performing the cycle algs where I don&#x27;t need to picture the cube or
        anything for a couple seconds. This rocks! I&#x27;m totally a fan of
        these pick-up cycles! And the best part is that they actually work
        during a solve! Chris

        Congratulations, Chris, I will have to think about this concept a little
        more and perhaps write on it. Write on what if your forget a cubie in
        the cycle, or what if you mix up cubies in a cycle. Such as you skip D
        in the cycle ABCDEF Or you shoot B-D and continue correctly such that
        the new cycle would be ADCBEF. There are a lot of tricks that need to be
        thought of and perhaps published somewhere as to how to recover from an
        error in recall. Later, Daniel Beyer --- In

        Hello Chris, In computing, if data is wrong, it is spotted by a
        procedure named &#x27;parity check&#x27; - one style contains enough
        data to allow an attempt at correcting the bad sequence of 1s and 0s.
        Maybe with every 4 letters of the alphabet, you could sum them (A = 1, B
        = 2 sort of thing) and memorise their total or memorise the units digit
        of their sum. It would be another time-consuming memory step but it
        might have value for quickly deducing the missing letter. Anyway, just
        an idea. Mike Send instant messages to your online friends

        Hey Marcus, I will try a solve today and post about solving the corners
        last to see what happens, but I have to ask what do you mean about
        shorter algorithms? The algorithms I use for corners are just
        commutators. The most common ones are ones like these: [B2, R F R&#x27;]
        [B2, R&#x27; F&#x27; R] (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;)x3 D2 (R&#x27; F R
        F&#x27;)x3 D2 (not strictly a commutator, but then again (R&#x27; F R
        F&#x27;)x3 is it&#x27;s own inverse anyway) To orient I always use
        either two sunes or a double sune, or an alg that flips three corners.
        To orient 2 corners I use either of: 1) L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27;
        L&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U R 2) L U L&#x27; U L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27;
        U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R To orient 4 corners I use either of: 1) L
        U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U
        R&#x27; U R L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; 2) L U L&#x27; U L U2
        L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R L U
        L&#x27; U L U2 L&#x27; Flip three corners: algs like U&#x27; R U R&#x27;
        U&#x27; R U R&#x27; L U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; L U&#x27;
        R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; L2 I&#x27;ll try a corners last solve,
        but I personally like solving them first because I don&#x27;t have to
        memorize them well (I only use visual memory for them, I don&#x27;t have
        any sort of system at all). Though I suppose if I memorize them first,
        this would let me memorize the centers and edges much more quickly since
        I will solve them sooner than I currently do. I guess it&#x27;s a matter
        of preference really, but I will try it again and see what I think.
        I&#x27;ll try to post the results on the group here. Chris --- In

        Hey Marcus, I just did a 4x4 solve memorized and solved in this order
        Memorization: 1) corner permutation 2) corner orientation 3) center
        permutation 4) edges permutation Solving: 1) center permutation 2) edge
        permutation 3) corner orientation 4) corner permutation The memorization
        time was around 5:15 and the total overall time was 9:33.04, the solve
        was successful. To be honest I didn&#x27;t really like doing it this
        way. I mean I know it&#x27;s just a personal preference, but I
        don&#x27;t like having to hold onto the corner information for so long.
        I also noticed during the memorization step that I rehearsed the corner
        information. I don&#x27;t like that because any rehearsal during
        memorization is wasted time, since you&#x27;re going over old stuff and
        not memorizing new stuff. I know with practice I could probably do away
        with this by just memorizing corners better the first time around. Still
        I don&#x27;t like the potential to even be able to rehearse corner
        information. I also didn&#x27;t really solve the corners at the end any
        differently from the way I normally do when I solve them first, so I
        didn&#x27;t really gain any time by saving them for the end. I can see
        how doing this way can be fast, but personally I don&#x27;t like it. I
        very much prefer to memorize the corners last and solve them first since
        it is such an easy step. That&#x27;s just my preference though, I think
        solving the corners last can also be fast because you don&#x27;t have to
        remember corner parity during the center permutation like I do. Still, I
        think personally I can memorize faster if I memorize the corners last
        and solve them first, but that&#x27;s just based on the way I memorize.
        I did honestly give it a try, but I really don&#x27;t like solving
        corners last, and I will definitely stick with memorizing them last and
        solving them first. That&#x27;s just my opinion though, I know both ways
        can be fast with practice, I just really prefer to solve the corners
        first. Chris > --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        Yeah, I was just wondering if there would be any major difference, but
        of course it would be difficult to get an accurate picture if one is
        already accustomed to a certain method. I am trying to figure out a
        better way to memorize bigger cubes (I did a few trial runs lately and
        the times really slip when the memory hooks weaken). Ideally, the best
        memory system would be one where it shouldn&#x27;t matter what order
        things are memorized in -- all information is just as strong regardless
        of how long ago you took it in. Like if I told you to remember
        &quot;Death Orange,&quot; it probably wouldn&#x27;t be any harder for
        you to memorize &quot;Orange Death.&quot; One way I&#x27;m trying to
        strengthen memory is to force myself to make the order
        &quot;inconvenient.&quot; If I memorize corners first, for instance, and
        solve them last, it forces me to keep the corners in memory longer than
        I would if I memorized them last and solved them first, and so
        eventually when you actually memorize corners last and solve them first
        for efficiency, it&#x27;s actually easier to recall the other
        information. However, this is assuming one&#x27;s able to break away
        from their routine solving method, which is why I am wondering if I am
        wasting time with this approach. Maybe it is foolish but I found that it
        forced me to use a system that was profound enough to stick... but
        unfortunately reality has shown that even taking a break from using a
        &quot;sticking memory system&quot; can weaken its strengths. --- In

      <strong>1041. 4x4 BLD average</strong><br />

        I would like to propose a new type of average for BLD that will apply to
        the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes. Accuracy is a much bigger issue for 4x4x4 and
        5x5x5 BLD, and so is the time needed for even one solve. Here is my idea
        to propose an average that will let you measure your skill level for the
        bigger cubes. Big Cube BLD average Rules: --------------------------- 1)
        12 consecutive successful solves must be taken in order to take an
        average. There may be any number of DNFs between successful solves, as
        long as 12 consecutive successful solves are taken. Solves must not all
        be done on the same day. 2) The fastest and slowest times are dropped
        and the middle ten are averaged. DNF&#x27;s do not affect the average
        except as described below. 3) The accuracy rate is also calculated by
        dividing the number of successful solves (always 12) by the total number
        of attempts taken. This value is just used for a comparison and does not
        affect the average. This is sort of like comparing Standard Deviation

        8:55.68 11) 7:34.19 -) DNF 12) 7:38.48 I throw out times #5 and #8 and
        average the rest to get an average of 8:32.64 minutes. My accuracy rate
        is 12/15 = 80% This average is a bit sketchy though, since I didn&#x27;t
        count my 9:33.04 solve where I tried solving corners last, I only wanted
        to count times with my usual method, even though the rules say to only
        take consecutive successful solves. I still want to stick to the rules
        of this new type of average, so in the future I&#x27;ll not do things
        like that, but I just wanted to get an example out there of an average
        using my usual method. I really want to get my average sub-8 before
        RWC2007, but in the process of doing that I realized that there
        isn&#x27;t really a standard for an average for 4x4x4 BLD, or 5x5x5 BLD
        for that matter, so I propose this one. Chris

        Hey Everybody, I&#x27;ve been analyzing solving the centers with
        commutators. There are many ways to solve the same cycle. There are a
        dozen ways to setup a commutator. Six for each direction of the Cycle.
        I&#x27;ve written a guide on it. Upon Chris&#x27; approval it&#x27;ll be
        available to the public. Possibly posted on his website. The goal of the
        the guide is to help you optimize setups for the commutators, and to use
        the proper commuator. Because the first part is rather intuitive, and
        basically explained by Chris&#x27;s Commutator guide --
        http://tinyurl.com/pft5d I didn&#x27;t give actual examples, moreso
        theory. However, as I said there are 12 possiblilities for the
        commutator that involves the three required pieces, and only half of
        them will cycle in the correct direction. My guide helps you identify
        which commutator you use with the setup you&#x27;ve chosen. Later,

        I agree I was rather disappointed to have only two attempts at Rutgers
        after having 5 at G.wiz ... I believe the plan was to have three
        attempts, as there was in the final round for 3x3 blindfolded at G.wiz.
        There was no qualifying round. However, that third attempt could have
        made the difference in the results. Being pressed for time is truly an
        inconvience. However, if events were promptly began, there would be less
        chance that you&#x27;ll be pressed for time. You can&#x27;t hope to
        schedule an average of 5 for blindfolded cubing, when you can&#x27;t
        schedule an average of three! Later, Daniel Beyer

        Hey Stefan, Daniel, Yeah I agree this average idea for the bigger cubes
        would not be a good fit for official competitions, there is barely
        enough time for even a best of 2 format. I think the average of 5 for
        3x3x3 BLD would be a good idea in terms of how well it would measure the
        skill level of each competitor, but I think it might be impractical. I
        remember Clancy posting about how 3x3x3 BLD lately has been taking
        precedence over 5x5x5 speedcubing as one particular example. I think if
        we stop having rennaisance cubers, those who do all events, then things
        like an average of 5 for 3x3x3 BLD would be possible. I know I always
        try to compete in as many events as possible, but to be honest I would
        also love on occasion to be able to give up other events for a chance at
        3 solves per cube in big cube BLD. I think this would be unfair though,
        because what if someone wanted to do big cube BLD and other events,
        would they get 2 solves or 3? Already this idea isn&#x27;t sounding like
        a good one haha. I also think, logistically, doing this would be a
        nightmare so it might be better if that idea never happens. Nevertheless
        I do agree that average of 5 for 3x3x3 BLD would be better if it were
        possible. Also an average of 10 (12 solves, minus fastest and slowest)
        would be awesome for the final round 3x3x3 events, but I also doubt that
        will happen due to it probably also being a logistical nightmare to
        actually have at a competition and still run other events as well. All
        in all I am happy with two solves for big cube BLD, and I do think
        having a prelim and final for 3x3x3 BLD is nice whenever possible. What
        about averaging the two solves in the prelim and the 3 solves, assuming
        you qualify, in the final as an average of 5? That way you get an
        accuracte measure of each person&#x27;s skill level. The only downside
        is that if you DNF once in the prelim and once in the final you have no
        average time to record, so that&#x27;s bad. haha so many ideas that
        won&#x27;t work, alright I&#x27;ll stop here before I keep going on ;-)

        Two attempts is enough for big cube bld. Even at world record breaking
        pace, the events are very long. I would really like to see a consistency
        in events with the proposed schedule. I&#x27;d just compete in 3x3 and
        blindfolded cubing, just because I know that I am out of practice in the
        other events. There is no point in wasting your time, or the other
        competitors time. Like at Rutgers, people were solving sub 3m solves,
        and I was in the 5m range. Of course, you should compete for the fun of
        it, not to win. I wouldn&#x27;t mind coming in last, as long as I had
        fun and saw personal improvement. I&#x27;ve always been told that in a
        competition like this, it&#x27;s not a race against the person beside
        you. It&#x27;s against the clock and yourself. Beat yourself, make your
        old self look bad, set yourself above what you once were and always try
        to improve. When you&#x27;re the best in there world there&#x27;s still
        competition, look in the mirror. Now I just overembellished, but you get
        the point. Off Topic: I can&#x27;t wait to fix my Rubik&#x27;s
        Professor. It&#x27;s superior to the crap eastsheens I&#x27;ve guzzled
        money into, and it&#x27;ll be awsome for both speed and blindfolded
        cubing. I&#x27;ve played with Hardwick&#x27;s and Frank Morris&#x27;
        cubes, actually the cube Hardwick set his WR blindfold solve on.
        Frank&#x27;s was insanely awsome. Hardwick&#x27;s off colors and slight
        stiffness left a little to be desired, I&#x27;m quite happy to see just
        how my cube feels in comparison with top notch cubers. I feel that the
        5x5x5 will be awsome for both events if once I start to practice again.
        Hardwick: Check the guide. Let me know what you think, I&#x27;ve hosted
        it on the web now. Just let me know if you approve. By the way, it does
        work, it&#x27;s helped me visualize commutators so much better.
        Especially once I gave the bracket notation, almost like with sets.

        Hey everyone, After about 6 DNFs that were sub-7 (one off by only two
        centers - arrrrrrgh!) I finally legitimately got sub-7 on a successful
        solve. The overall time was 6:54.97 with about 3:35 of memorization. My
        best DNF so far was a 6:19 DNF which was the one with only two centers
        swapped, so now my goal is to get sub-6. I know this will be possible,
        the breakdown will be something like 3:05 memorization and 2:50 solving.
        I&#x27;ve been working a lot lately on memorizing, and also on just
        twisting very, very quickly during the solve. I soon want to try to
        apply what I&#x27;ve learned to the 5x5x5, but for now I&#x27;m still
        focusing on 4x4x4 BLD. Just had to say something, getting sub-7 has been
        a goal for me for a while, so I&#x27;m glad to finally have made it!
        Happy BLD cubing everyone, Chris

        Wow! Just wow! Tonight has been a good night. Successful 5x5x5 BLD
        solve. Memorization in 10:29 and the overall time was 18:51.76 minutes!
        I was trying to memorize quickly, but also so that I could still be able
        to recall. I also was trying to solve with no delays, though not really
        as breakneck of a speed as I go on 4x4x4. I think the combination of
        pretty fast memorization and no delay solving is what finally got me
        sub-20, sub-19 even! Wow, I&#x27;m ready to try for sub-18 now, I think
        times in the 15 minutes might be near the limit for the 5x5x5, but

        Hey everyone, I just now got a successful sub-18 5x5x5 BLD solve :-D
        17:16.91 was the overall time. I memorized for 9:21 and the solving then
        took roughly 7:55, which is both my personal fastest memorization and
        solving phase, on the same solve no less! I know sub-17 will be
        possible, and it is my current short term goal. I&#x27;m finding that
        there is a big difference between 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 BLD. To get fast times
        on 4x4x4 BLD you have to go EXTREMELY fast on both memorization and
        solving. Probably I&#x27;d say 90-95% of maximum speed on memorizing and
        105% maximum speed during solving - seriously as fast as humanly
        possible during the solving phase. The 5x5x5 seems to be very different
        though. To get fast times I find it is much easier to memorize
        slow-fast, maybe 75% of maximum speed, and to solve at maybe 75% speed
        but to try for no delays. Solving the 5x5x5 much slower than full speed,
        but in doing so avoiding recall delays, seems to be much better than
        going full speed since there is so much more to do during the solving
        phase as compared to the 4x4x4. The 4x4x4 is really not that much to
        memorize once you get used to it, so it seems to be better to just go as
        FAST as possible during the solving phase, regardless of whether or not
        you get some recall delays. I have decided that this image and journey
        memorization method is the one for me. I know that agrupation methods,
        or Person-Action-Object methods, might be faster than this image system,
        but I really think that for me the image system is much better, it just
        makes sense to me. Also I know agrupation and PAO might be faster, but I
        think this image method might be just a little more accurate in general.
        That is just my personal opinion, since I have less experience using
        PAO, but so far I think it might tend to be true. Also if Ben Pridmore
        can memorize a deck of cards in close to 30 seconds with this 2 objects
        per image method, I think it is a good choice of method for the bigger
        cubes BLD as well, since both are just memorizing a permutation.
        I&#x27;m also finding the more I practice that knowing your images
        really really well isn&#x27;t the only important thing. When I use
        journeys that have more meaning for me I tend to get faster times as
        well. The two most meaningful journeys to me are also the ones where I
        tend to get the fastest times, so I&#x27;ve been working on really
        knowing all my journeys very well as well as my images. Another thing I
        do now is to cycle through my journeys for each solve. This way after I
        fill up all locations in my first journey, I will use all my other
        journeys before I again use the 1st journey. This means that each
        journey can get close to a week of rest time before I use it again,
        which means I won&#x27;t have any interference from the last time I used
        it. Awesome, big cube BLD is so much fun! I can&#x27;t wait to get a
        sub-17 5x5x5 solve, and I&#x27;m also trying for a sub-6 4x4x4 solve as
        well, but that one will take more practice than sub-17 for 5x5x5 for me
        I know. Happy BLD&#x27;ing everyone! Chris

        Hey Marcus, I just did some move counts for the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 to
        answer your question: 4x4x4 ----- CO: 43 moves CP: 17 moves (not
        including parity) CP: 77 moves fix corner parity: 21 moves EP: 92 moves
        fix edge parity: 21 moves Total: 271 moves On a good solve lately
        I&#x27;ll solve in around 3:30 so that&#x27;s 271 moves in 210 seconds
        or 1.29 moves per second sustained. 5x5x5 ----- EO: 54 moves CO: 39
        moves CP: 29 moves EP: 47 moves Xcenters: 72 moves +centers: 67 moves
        fix center blocks I setup during Xcenters: 21 moves fix corner and
        central edge parity: 21 moves wing-edges (including edge-parity): 102
        moves Total: 452 moves On a good solve I&#x27;ll solve in around 8:30
        minutes. So that&#x27;s 452 moves in 510 seconds, or 0.87 moves/second
        sustained. ------------------------------------------- Marcus what are
        the breakdowns of your solves? For a 20 minute solve I would usually
        have memorized in 11 minutes and solved in about 9 minutes. I&#x27;ve
        gotten about 4-5 sub-20 solves recently (including very, very close
        DNFs) and those are usually 9:30-10:30 minutes memorizing and 8:30-9:30
        solving. I remember you saying you memorized the 5x5x5 in under 10
        minutes very often and sometimes under 7 minutes. What is your record
        time for 5x5x5 BLD? I imagine memorizing in sub-7 minutes would lead to
        at worst a 17-18 minute overall time even if it took you 10 minutes or
        more to solve. It seems more likely that to memorize in sub-7 you could
        solve in sub-9 and get a sub-16 overall solve fairly easily. I&#x27;d
        say that right now my average breakdown is about 10:30 minutes
        memorizing and 9:30 solving. In the past 2-3 days though I&#x27;ve
        memorized in 9:30-10:00 a few times, and solved in about 8:30- 10:00.
        That one solve where I memorized in 9:21 and solved in 7:55 is by far my
        best ever peformance for both memorizing and solving. I also twist
        Xcenters out of place very frequently on the 5x5x5, and I lockup the
        layers very often as well. I think this is evident from the fact that my
        turning ratio is almost half again as fast on the 4x4x4 as on the 5x5x5.
        I can&#x27;t wait to try a BLD solve on the olympicube 5x5x5, I think it
        would be possible to actually solve much more quickly on that cube.

        I need to rebuild some memory systems for the larger cubes as I&#x27;ve
        slowed down without much practice at all, but I think my record time for
        blindfoldsolving the 5x5x5 cube was around 15 minutes including
        memorization and execution with a 5 minute memorization and 10 minute
        execution. That was by far the best solve and it wasn&#x27;t very
        typical -- normally it took a few more minutes to memorize (I&#x27;m
        getting sick of PAO to be honest... I am strongly considering your image
        approach the more I read about it), and like 15 minutes to solve. On
        average, total times were around the low-20&#x27;s. The memory was
        always really quick, but the execution sucks. The XCenters absolutely
        blow chunks -- they constantly pop out of place when you try to go
        quickly. I would really like to use a larger cube that doesn&#x27;t...
        well, suck. Otherwise I find myself making like less than a move per
        second (if not slower) and it just feels like it&#x27;d be so much
        better to go quickly, because sometimes when I&#x27;m taking a while to
        make executions, my mind wanders and I mess things up. It is easier to
        go with the flow of things so your execution keeps up with the mind and
        the moves coincide more with what your muscle memory&#x27;s used to. ---

        Hey Marcus, Well you&#x27;ve inspired me. I just tried a 5x5x5 solve and
        I tried to go literally as fast as possible for memo and I memorized in
        7:43, which is by far the fastest I ever have done memo. I messed up
        during execution of Xcenters because I twisted an Xcenter so that the
        cap came off. I continued the solve anyway, but I got lost trying to
        pick back up where I was in the middle of the commutator when the center
        twisted cap twisted off. I remembered everything about the solve, but I
        did have to use a pickup cycle during Xcenters. I forgot one journey
        location, so in the mean time I continued on to the next location and
        picked up the location once I remembered it. The solve is off by a
        number of Xcenters, and a couple wing edges, but otherwise solved. Still
        this has inspired me to not go at 75% pace for the memorization of the
        5x5x5, but rather to do like the 4x4x4 and just go full speed. I&#x27;m
        going to keep giving this a shot and see how it goes. To get right at a
        15 minute solve I imagine I&#x27;d solve in 7:50 and memo in 7:10.
        Solving in 7:50 doesn&#x27;t seem bad, but memo in 7:10 seems crazy.
        I&#x27;ll keep at it though and see what happens. There&#x27;s no way
        I&#x27;d try to go this fast in a competition, but it is fun to test my
        limits at home without having to worry about going home with 2 DNFs. I
        think it would be cool to one day be able to memorize this fast in
        competition though. Chris > I need to rebuild some memory systems for

        Hey again Marcus, Ok I tried one more time, since I was mad at myself
        for breaking that X-center last time after having memorized so quickly.
        I broke my record for 5x5x5 single solve on this next try :-D The
        overall time was 15:49.63 minutes. Memorization took 7:36 and the
        solving then took 8:13 minutes. I memorized literally full speed, and I
        didn&#x27;t rehearse a single image or journey location at any point. I
        just memorized once and moved on for everything. And no I am not joking,
        the solve was successful. I&#x27;ll be perfectly honest I find it
        incredibly frustrating that you say you don&#x27;t practice much and yet
        you get such incredibly fast times. I practice literally every day and
        don&#x27;t get those times. It definitely sounds like your speed comes
        from your natural memory though, and in addition to that you&#x27;ve
        applied a system to it to make it even better. I mean this in a friendly
        competitive way, but seriously being frustrated at your times is what
        made me able to focus so well during memorization and solving on that
        solve. I&#x27;m gunning for your 15:00.00 ;-) Seriously though you are a
        motivating factor for me since your times are so crazy fast. Watch out
        though - you say your memory system is slipping, but right now I&#x27;m
        at the top of my game ;-) I guess we&#x27;re racing to sub-15min now.
        Happy BLD&#x27;ing Chris

        Ok I just tried a few solves at fullspeed without any regard for the
        shifts in the XCenters/any pops that occurred (I&#x27;m also using a new
        approach to EP and CO). Luckily I didn&#x27;t have any pops save one
        solve where an XCenter and a +Center dislodged. Memorization for the
        fastest solve was about 6:01 with an execution of 10:03, or a total time
        of 16:04 or so. That execution felt very rough but I was still trying to
        go at full speed (sometimes lockups though are just so stubborn and
        don&#x27;t allow for turns)... if I can get the memory around 5 minutes
        consistently and improve the execution, that&#x27;d be pretty sweet. I
        will spent the rest of tonight practicing, lol. --- In

        Been doing nothing but solves for a few hours now, haha. Achieved a new
        personal best on the 5x5x5 of 14:32. A few edges (maybe 3 or so) and
        XCenters (maybe 6) were already permuted right after the scramble,
        though (what is considered lucky for 5x5x5 BLD?). Execution becomes
        nicer after a while because the hands get used to turning the layers.
        Would love to get my hands on a 5x5x5 that doesn&#x27;t lock or spit
        pieces out, though. Execution times would plummet if one could apply the
        same type of speed as they would to a 3x3x3 cube (obviously not to the
        same extent, but at least a lot more than is currently possible given
        the mechanics of what is available). I am torn between systems. I
        don&#x27;t know whether or not to switch to an image system. Even now
        I&#x27;m still using PAO for the centers and wings, but I&#x27;m
        seriously reconsidering just switching to your system. Chris, I have an
        interesting video idea I&#x27;d be willing to do if you&#x27;d also be
        game: We could tape ourselves doing a sample 5x5x5 solve, perhaps
        speaking aloud what we are thinking during memorization and execution.
        The idea wouldn&#x27;t be so much to get a fast time but rather to sort
        of compare the inner monologues that go on. I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;d
        be interesting to see how we differ in approaches. I&#x27;d also love to
        talk with you on Yahoo sometime about all this. This big cube stuff is
        pretty awesome... you&#x27;re a great inspiration, Chris! Let me know

        Marcus, You and I also have to talk on memo techniques. What is this
        memo map you are talking about? I must study for my two final exams
        which are tomorrow. I&#x27;ve done a little practice on speedcubing, I
        learned full PLL yestserday, after well years ... lol! I wonder if a
        visual memo + long term memo combination would be fast. I would love to
        do my finger taps across the centers to memorize them. I&#x27;ve been so
        busy, the best I&#x27;ve done is a cage on the 4x4. But I&#x27;ll finish
        the Image system over Christmas Break. Maybe go at breakneck speed
        memorizing it. I&#x27;ve learned 25% of the letter pair system in like 3
        days of memorizing. I need to seriously fix my 5x5x5! I&#x27;m missing 4
        X-centers, long story. Tried to fix one just before G.wiz, wound up
        breaking another and losing one completely. And another one of the bad
        X-centers just broke this weekend. I bought a new Rubik&#x27;s Revenge
        after seeing Craig&#x27;s, I hope that I&#x27;ll get fast times on it.
        I&#x27;m not as fast in any of the events as you guys are but I&#x27;ve
        been practicing, and Marcus, you remembe where I was in BLD this summer,

        nothing but solves for a few hours now, haha. Achieved a new personal
        best on the 5x5x5 of 14:32. A few edges (maybe 3 or so) and XCenters
        (maybe 6) were already permuted right after the scramble, though (what
        is considered lucky for 5x5x5 BLD?). Execution becomes nicer after a
        while because the hands get used to turning the layers. Would love to
        get my hands on a 5x5x5 that doesn&#x27;t lock or spit pieces out,
        though. Execution times would plummet if one could apply the same type
        of speed as they would to a 3x3x3 cube (obviously not to the same
        extent, but at least a lot more than is currently possible given the
        mechanics of what is available). I am torn between systems. I don&#x27;t
        know whether or not to switch to an image system. Even now I&#x27;m
        still using PAO for the centers and wings, but I&#x27;m seriously
        reconsidering just switching to your system. Chris, I have an
        interesting video idea I&#x27;d be willing to do if you&#x27;d also be
        game: We could tape ourselves doing a sample 5x5x5 solve, perhaps
        speaking aloud what we are thinking during memorization and execution.
        The idea wouldn&#x27;t be so much to get a fast time but rather to sort
        of compare the inner monologues that go on. I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;d
        be interesting to see how we differ in approaches. I&#x27;d also love to
        talk with you on Yahoo sometime about all this. This big cube stuff is
        pretty awesome... you&#x27;re a great inspiration, Chris! Let me know

        Chris, What are you averaging when running through your images? I just
        started practicing again. I know 25% of the images. I know A-D very
        well. I did like 5 runs through the images. (285.05), 145.41, 128.41,
        95.53, 94.09 The first run I was very sketchy on the images, it was my
        first run in almost a week. Then the others just went by faster and
        faster. This was for 92 images. I almost hit 1s/image in th end. The
        perks of my image adaptation is that as few of my letter pairs I
        normally refer to as the letter pair. such as DT = Dark Templar. So that
        helped increase the speed, but others like DQ I said Disqualified and
        envisioned Rutgers Fall and Today. So I dunno I think 1s/image is
        possible most definitely! Chris, lemme know what you think. And I think
        that 1.25s/image is possible for the whole system.

        I knew I had read this somewhere Quote: Hardick &quot;Sub-9&quot;
        &quot;I have been practicing recalling my images every day as fast as I

        Hey Daniel, I ran through my stack of cards a couple of nights ago and
        it took me about 20 minutes to do, which works out to 2.08 seconds per
        card. I tried it again just now a few days later and ran through my
        whole stack, randomly shuffled, in 13:00.49 or 1.36 seconds per image.
        Before a couple nights ago I hadn&#x27;t run through my stack in a month
        or more, since I felt that all my images were solidified well enough
        from solving, and just going over letter groups in my head at work and
        stuff. As to your idea to modify the words you don&#x27;t like, I did
        the same with Michael Curtis&#x27; list. Many of my words are straight
        off his list, but also a number I have changed to ones I like better.
        Yeah man you&#x27;re learning the images really quickly! If ever you are
        memorizing and one of your new letter pair images pops into your head,
        use the new image before you use old stuff. That will help solidy them.
        I remember my GK or Green Knight image really well because it was one of
        the first where the GK image of the Green Knight popped into my head on
        one solve when I had G followed by K, whereas at the time I was using a
        single image to single piece method and should have used two images
        there. Anyway man I know recall can be very fast. I believe Ben Pridmore
        said he could recall all of his images mentally (without a card stack)
        in 15 minutes? Please someone correct me if I misquoted that time, I
        searched the memory sports group but couldn&#x27;t find that post again.
        Anyway the time I remember was close to if not very well sub-20 minutes.
        Assuming a barely sub-20 time he still recalled 2.33 images per second
        roughly. No that&#x27;s not seconds per image, but images per second. I
        find that I prefer to think of two random pieces on the cube and convert
        those to letters then to my image, rather than to use my card stack all
        of the time. I like to apply the image to those two pieces on the cube.
        Some image groups come up so often that I can see those two pieces and I
        instantly know the image, I don&#x27;t even have to think of which
        letter each piece is. Daniel I think you probably have a much stronger
        natural memory than I do. When I first started it took me well over 40
        minutes to recall all of my images, and you&#x27;re already 1/5 the way
        through and recalling at a faster pace than I do. I&#x27;ll just have to
        keep working on my execution to overcome the crazy memorization times
        you&#x27;ll get lol ;-) Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@...m,

        someone e-mailed me about it to give it a try. From what I understand
        you have a set group of objects in a set order, 1) Chair, 2) Desk, 3)
        Computer, etc.. Then with each object you associate some small group of
        things/objects/letters/numbers/etc.. So to apply to the cube I would
        give each piece a letter. Then with the chair I associate the letters
        AFKJ. I don&#x27;t convert them to images or picture them or anything.
        Just when I think of the chair I think in quick succession AFKJ. That
        way when I recall and I think of the chair again those 4 letters come
        back. The message I received was from someone from the memory sports
        group. I really don&#x27;t want to give out their e-mail address if they
        don&#x27;t want me to, but here was the body of the message:
        ------------------------------------------------- hi Chris &quot;the
        location&quot;+association is used only when you have large amounts of
        information to memorize. the memorization in 30 min =~ 1k digits they
        use &quot;the location&quot; to 1 hour the record is =~2k digits if you
        have 15 min you can use agrupation +association and probably sound when
        you need. than you can memorize worse but faster. the record is near to
        750 digits if you have 5 minutes you will probably use 2 or 3
        agrupations at a time with very fast associations. the record is about
        350 digits If you have 1 second or less, you will use pure speed reading
        of less than . 4 seconds you can use speed reading with an agrupation
        you can create. good luck :)
        ------------------------------------------------------- Agrupation is
        currently what I am trying for the 3x3x3. I think I will stick to my
        images method for the bigger cubes though. This is because I use 6-7
        journey locations for the 4x4x4 and 12-13 for the 5x5x5. Ben uses 9
        locations to memorize a stack of cards and his times are world class for
        speed cards. So I think for memorizing around 9 locations with this
        method is a good idea.

        You&#x27;ll most definitely have me in that category for a very long
        time. Your executions are crazy! I remember you said that planning the
        solve then executing is a lot faster than sighted with no planning at
        all. The one thing that I have to work on is creating longer cycles. I
        intentionally seem to break the cycles while doing sighted solves. Which
        is very stupid. Because you can&#x27;t get any flow, it&#x27;s so
        choppy, and it&#x27;s what slows me down during 3x3 bld. You are using
        memo cards. Are your cards scrambled? What I have is a page with the
        alphabet your first page basically. I&#x27;ll run down the alphabet as
        fast as possible. Scrambled cards is a little more difficult because it
        takes reaction and randomness into effect that occurs during an actual
        memorization. It&#x27;s wierd because I recall the images a lot faster
        than the words so that I am just scanning and almost falling behind if I
        try to saw all of the words. Like my words are catching up to my images
        when I get a lag in recall. So when I actually go slowly w/o cards going
        from AB-EX I&#x27;ll actually say all of the words that I don&#x27;t
        normally say. I was telling Marcus just how good my memo used to be.
        It&#x27;s rather ironic, I was always told I had a gift ... now I&#x27;m
        using it for something I truely enjoy! However I have a poor memory
        considering how good my memory really is. That betrays my amazing memory
        skills. It&#x27;s more so a selective memory. Well ... Later, Daniel

        For Wing Commuators, I do piece by piece. I use

        Answering to Tyson, I memorise the EP (and CP) by &quot;drawing&quot;
        the cycles in my mind and also using numbers, starting from UF and going
        to UL, UB, UR, FL, BL, BR, FR, DF, DL, DB and DR about the commutators,
        I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re talking about the 5x5x5 or
        4x4x4...haha...what exactly are &quot;wing edges&quot;? I got my 4x4x4
        recently, and didn&#x27;t really started to think of ways to solve it

        l&#x27;L U&#x27; or so...but I won&#x27;t try it soon...my times on
        4x4x4 are still awful...haha Pedro Daniel Beyer &lt;dbeyer816@...>

        Yes, I mean moves that ruin orientation. I seem to remember that using
        setup moves such as F, R, B, and L; destroyed orientation. I also seem

        Well, if you are using the T-perm for cycling, then all you need to do
        is setup so you don&#x27;t move any corner/edge involved in the
        &quot;T&quot; swap other than the piece in the buffer position. To be
        honest, with using only the T-perm for cycling, I think sub-4 minute or
        even 3-minute average is possible, with practice. Here is Bill&#x27;s
        guide using the T-Perm:

        Thanks, Bill&#x27;s site is the page that got me interested in learning
        BLD. Today was my second day at it, and I am getting closer to feeling
        comfortable with it. I am still hitting a few rough patches with my
        setup moves, but after I get the setups down, I should be rolling. This
        is definatly lots of fun, and quite addicting. ~Andy --- In

        To get past the 80 barrier, I think it&#x27;s a matter of speeding up
        EP. The rest of the cube can basically be done very quickly without any

        start at UF and see that the cycle goes UF- >DF->DR->DL, then ends, and

        to my next spot, UR. I see that the cycle goes UR->FL->FR->DB, ends, and
        once again I have two to swap. So I have now UF needs to swap with DL,
        UL with BL, and UR with DB. I have not yet come up with a good way to
        memorize this situation, nor do I have a good way to solve it. Assuming
        that for a 1:20 solve I&#x27;d need to memorize this in at least 30 sec,

        Usually when I have a bunch of random edges to flip, I usually flip all
        12 then flip the two I messed up. As for the cycles, when I have a bunch
        of doubles, I cycle them as normal, knowing that the FIRST edge of the
        next cycle will simply go to the back. So in your case you have (UF DF
        DR DL) (UL BR UB BL) (UR FL FR DB). Cycle (UF DF DR) as normal and you
        now get (UF DL) (UL BR UB BL) (UR FL FR DB). Instead of &quot;keeping UF
        DL in mind for later,&quot; go ahead and cycle (UF DL UL), knowing
        it&#x27;ll drop DL and kick UL (the end of the first cycle) to the end
        of its own cycle. (UF DL) (UL BR UB BL) (UR FL FR DB) becomes (UF BR UB
        BL UL) (UR FL FR DB). The cool thing about this approach is that it
        doesn&#x27;t disturb your memory much -- all it does is finish off the
        second element of cycle 1 and kick the start of cycle 2 to the end. All
        you need to remember is what the start of the second cycle was
        specifically -- and be able to kick it to the end. So in this case
        you&#x27;d do (UF BR UB) then (UF BL UL) to finish off that mutated
        second cycle. Then you got (UR FL FR DB) to reduce after doing (UR FL
        FR), in which case you then have (UR DB) and thus a parity error. I
        still haven&#x27;t devised an easy way to deal with parities. I am
        thinking maybe Pochmann approach would be best here? Simple two cycle of
        corners and edges using T Perms... very mindless and easy to do. --- In

        In case I made any typos: In the case of (a b)(c d) where a, b, and c
        denote arbitrary singular pieces within a cycle and d denotes any number
        of edges within that cycle (could be as low as 0 or as high as 9): (a

        So...you memorise EP first...what about the rest? which order? I do CO
        EO CP EP, and solve the same way...I guess it&#x27;s because that was
        the way I learned from Macky&#x27;s site : ) and by 6 flip you mean (R B
        R&#x27; U)*5? or what? Pedro Tyson Mao &lt;tyson.mao@...> escreveu:
        Uh... for a 1:20 solve, you don&#x27;t have 30 seconds to memorize EP.
        You mean 30 seconds for the entire Rubik&#x27;s Cube right? Typically, I
        have my EP memorized in under 20 seconds. I generally glance up at the
        timer after EP and use it as a benchmark to see how my memorization is
        going. A good EP I can memorize in about 12 seconds. The slow ones get
        closer to 20 and sometimes if I&#x27;m tired, maybe 22 seconds. For
        10-edge flip, I generally do 6 + 4. The super-12-edge flip algorithm
        consists of two 6-flips for me, which takes time. I find it faster to do
        a 6 flip + a 4 flip because the 4 flip is so fast. Though, I rarely run
        across the case, so I haven&#x27;t had much chance to practice. -Tyson

        I was wondering about your 3-cycle methods. Do you always use the Edge
        PLLs? Do you use 2-gen, or optimal face-turn-metric algs?? Does anybody
        use other 2-gen algs such as
        R&#x27;URU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR2 or
        RU&#x27;R&#x27;URURUR&#x27;U&#x27;R2? I think the EP system can be fast
        w/ a system like such, where you set the first cubie to the U layer, and
        the next cubie is setup by d move. Does anybody use this approach? -- In

        Tyson, When I remember my corner orientation, I don&#x27;t need to
        remember the orientation of corner one (UFL), since the method I use is
        a bit remedial and slow. I move an improperly orientated corner into UFR
        and do ... L D R&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; D R D&#x27; Z R&#x27; D&#x27; L D
        R D&#x27; L&#x27; D Z&#x27; So by the time I fix corners 2-8, corner one
        has to take on the proper orientation by default, its a &#x27;slow but
        sure&#x27; method. hope I explained it clearly. ~Andy

        My question is how you go about the CO memorization. I mean sometimes
        you don&#x27;t have perfect groups of 2/3/4 on a given layer. Do you
        just pick out what you see at first glance and then use the residual
        with the other layer? --- In

        Yes that does make sense, it will take some time for me to become more
        comfortable with these different methods. It took me about 1 week to
        feel good with my setup moves, this has been extremely fun to learn

        Yes, Bill teaches it so that you skip the first corner because you know
        that after all the others are done, it will be done. So in his case,
        every single corner was oriented wrong. ----- Original Message -----

        What I do currently for CO is I remember it very last. This way I
        don&#x27;t really remember anything, I just look at it, plan out the
        algs/setups I need for them, and then do that, then go back to what I
        remembered before. I have found it very quick to do it that way. I use
        the alg from Mackys site for CO: A = (R&#x27;D&#x27;RD)x2 Then, to flip
        UFL and UFR, I use U&#x27;AUA&#x27;. To flip 3 corners clockwise, just
        do A as I move each piece I want flipped into the position where I am
        doing the flipping, which is typically 2. If you do a z&#x27; move
        before you perform the alg, it goes very quick. I can usually have
        CO/memo of that done in about 15-30 seconds, which is by far the
        quickest piece for me. ----- Original Message ----- From: Tyson

        [blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube] Re: Success!!! The idea for corner
        orientation is you look at things in groups and not as individual
        pieces. Types of groups are pairs, groups of 3, groups of 4, and if
        you&#x27;re more advanced, groups of 5. (5 can be considered as 2 + 3).
        If you see a pair, it&#x27;s generally pretty clear on how to orient
        those two. If they&#x27;re next to each other, it&#x27;s quite simple.
        If they&#x27;re not next to each other, it only takes one setup move to
        put them next to each other. The setup move isn&#x27;t necessary unless
        they&#x27;re both in different layers. Groups of 3 are also pretty
        quick. Usually, they&#x27;re all next to each other. If not, you need a
        setup move. In a couple cases, you need two setup moves. For a group of
        four, there&#x27;s only two different patterns. One is 1 2 1 2 and the
        other is 1 1 2 2. You simply learn to recognize these and execute the
        correct algorithms. Does this help? -Tyson On 12/27/06, reusto

        Ouch Tyson... that last general comment was harsh haha! Dude, I
        understand what you mean about analyzing then memorizing. I do the same.
        If I see multiple disoriented edges that are permuted, I&#x27;ll think
        how can I set them up to do a 2-edge flip? Mind you I use Pochmann too.
        I try and make things as braindead as possible. This piece, ok
        that&#x27;s how I solve it, and that&#x27;s always how. One step in
        analysis I used to take was to take the chance to avoid the LU as a
        piece in the cycle. I found scanning for pieces is a lot slower than
        scanning over the locations. I am solving the 3x3 in about 160-170 at
        the moment, even when I think memo is attrocious! As for memorizing. I
        memorize visually. I count as I go along. I don&#x27;t have UL, RF, and
        etc set as numbers, but I count as I go along. I&#x27;d have to say
        about 90 and 90 for each portion of the solve. This can be improved
        surely. Good luck man!! I am looking into a 3-cycle method where you
        orient all edges then set the first cubie to the U layer(2 move max),
        and then adjust the D and E slice w/ d turns so that you can solve the
        cycle with 2-gen. Setups are limited to {D,d,L,l} and a very fast alg
        system. I really hope to practice with it, however, big cube bld and
        work are taking prescedence. You can learn a lot from self exploration,
        don&#x27;t always ask questions, find your own answers to your own
        problems. Not saying you shouldn&#x27;t be asking right now, but you can
        learn a lot from independent study as well. Tyson Mao &lt;tyson.mao@...>

        Rubik&#x27;s Cube blindfolded. I was wondering how you distinguish
        between analyze and memorize? I ask this because when I started
        blindfold cubing, I approached it differently. I would memorize all the
        information first, and then analyze it later after I had put the
        blindfold on. The idea when I started was to have all the information
        committed to memory, and then go along and figure out what each cycle
        was. This method works all right if you have a fast memory, but it
        depends on your ability to &quot;look ahead&quot; while solving
        blindfolded. If you can analyze the next cycle while you perform the
        current cycle, then you&#x27;re in good shape. For me now, since
        I&#x27;ve probably done every possible cycle on the cube, the analysis
        is pretty quick, so there isn&#x27;t much delay as long as my memory is
        smooth. However, there are cases where I do &quot;analyze&quot; before I
        &quot;memorize.&quot; Well, the idea is to analyze and memorize at the
        same time, or use your analyze as the memory. In certain cases,
        it&#x27;s easier to memorize something during the analysis. An
        example... perhaps you notice that B2 + (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;)x3 + B2
        solves a certain corner parity. Instead of memorizing the positions of
        the cycles (or transpositions), I would analyze them while I was looking
        at the cube, and memorize the analysis, and not the cycle paths. I guess
        my input here is not to limit yourself to one method or another.
        Whichever way is easier for you to memorize the cube, you might as well
        go with it. In this manner, you will gain comfort with more ways to
        memorize and attack the cube, and you&#x27;ll have more tools in your
        arsenal and have a greater ability to handle more complex mental tasks.
        So... don&#x27;t always analyze, then memorize. Sometimes, it works, but
        in some situations, it might be faster to do it the other way around.
        Play around with it... Sorry if I sounded condescending. I don&#x27;t
        mean to be. I just don&#x27;t want to hear you (a general you, not you
        in particular) say that you average BLD solving in 30 seconds, but then
        have no idea of the OLL + U-perm for corner orientation. -Tyson On

        Yeah, not everyone knows the same algorithms, especially by name --
        sometimes people like figuring out different algorithms that work
        better. I&#x27;d assume a fair number aren&#x27;t entirely certain what
        an &quot;OLL + UPerm&quot; is (some may even say it&#x27;s practical but
        not optimal in length), but can accomplish the same effect through other
        means. There are many ways to skin a cat (or blindfold-solve a cube).
        Daniel, what is your opinion on using Pochmann method for parity errors?
        Those things have always killed me... they add a sickening amount of
        wasted energy and time to my... well, times. Figuring out how to set up
        two corners and two edges into a reasonable position (preserving
        orientation) to execute a PLL algorithm is sometimes difficult (I still
        have not relearned all of PLL because I no longer have an interest in
        purely speedcubing, although one of these days I should just buck it up
        and relearn it all), and it requires a lot of disgusting manipulations
        for me. However, do you think it is possible, or even ultimately
        pragmatic to use Pochmann for this exception instead? How fast could a
        parity error be solved on average given two oriented corners and two
        oriented edges (which could be anywhere on the cube)? --- In

        First, allow me to differentiate between two terms that I will use
        often. Setup: To use moves bring the target piece into a target area.
        [d&#x27;l&#x27;] would be the setup to move the RF to the UL
        Conjugation: By true definition setups are conjugations. However, I will
        refer to a conjugation as a setup move that cancels moves on the
        algorithm.
        FRU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FRF&#x27;
        is the standard Y permutation, Conjugated by F&#x27; and a cube
        rotation, we get:
        [y&#x27;F&#x27;]FRU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FRF&#x27;[Fy]
        ==
        y&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FRy
        Notice how the moves canceled out. And see that this setup alg:
        [d&#x27;l&#x27;]RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FR2U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;[ld]
        has no canceling effect as the y perm did. [My approach to solving the
        cube blindfolded] Solve edges one at a time -3 PLL are used -All three
        involve the UR and another U layer edge -All three swap the UFR and URB
        -No orientation phase is necassary, permutation and orientation are
        solved by the proper setup What is the parity? -A parity occurs when I
        use an odd number of 2-cycles to solve the edges -At this point, the UFR
        and URB are swapped -To continue use a two cycle that swaps the UFR and
        URB, restoring corner permuation -I use
        LU&#x27;R&#x27;UL&#x27;U2RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2R, this swaps the two corners
        and the UR and UB Is the parity really fixed? (The UR and UB are swapped
        afterall!) -Yes, it is. The corners require an odd number of 2-cycles to
        be solved as well -Using Conjgated PLLs that swap the UR and UB, once
        the corners are solved the edges will be restored Solve the corners one
        at a time -3 basic conjugations of the PLL are used to solve the corners
        -All three swap the URB and a face on the DFL (that is the DFL, FLD, and
        LDF) -As said before the UR and UB are the corners being swapped
        Pochmann uses 1 alg for corners, why use 3? -I use 3 algs to reduce
        setup moves -I actually use even more than 3, I have deeper conjugations
        of the PLL -However 3 is the bare minimum to always use one face move
        per setup -Through the use of PLL and Conjugations thereof, 12 corner
        cases can be solved w/o setup -Of the 9 left, only 3 require a face move
        that is 2 quarter turns Examples of a deeper conjugation:
        [y&#x27;R&#x27;F&#x27;]FRU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FRF&#x27;[FRy]
        ==
        y&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FR2y
        [y&#x27;R2F&#x27;]FRU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FRF&#x27;[FR2y]
        ==
        y&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FR&#x27;y
        A standard 2-cycle method, such as pochmanns or mine cannot be used
        haphazardly with 3-cycles. A 2-cycle method has controlled areas in
        which the cube is affected. You want to use it so you can swap any two
        corners and any two edges. However, Pochmann&#x27;s method specifically
        swaps the same two edges and two corners every solve. I have a solution
        to your problem, you may not like it though, but you definitely
        don&#x27;t like your approach to parity fixing, so I&#x27;ll discuss my
        thoughts w/ you later. And yes, this will preserve EO and CO, however,
        these two steps must be done before my concept is applied. Later, Daniel

        Truly, this is all basically bashing marcus for his rediculously fast
        acclaimed times. Who cares anymore. As long as everybody learns from
        others and from theirselves, does it really matter how fast anybody is.

        immensity of memorizing and solving a rubik&#x27;s revenge, or
        professor. Times can be sparatic, even if you are fast. You have good
        days and hellish ones too. I was averaging about 3:15 the night before
        rutgers, then I didn&#x27;t do a single successful solve at rutgers in
        practice or competition. However, at G.wiz I was totally out of
        practice, and wasn&#x27;t successfully solving the whole time in
        Florida, until about an hour before the Competition began. And I did
        fine while competing. People have off days, I know I&#x27;ve had mine
        and will continue to do so. Also, you can have sparatic leaps time cuts
        as well as increased increments. Both dramatic time cuts or increases in

        No I&#x27;m not trying to get into some attack-war here -- I am just
        saying that it is very possible to solve a cube blindfolded quickly and
        not be entirely familiar with all the Fridrich algorithms, because you
        simply don&#x27;t have to use explicit-Fridrich when you blindsolve.
        Just because you use an algorithm that permutes things while preserving
        orientation doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s automatically considered
        Fridrich-style, and on the same note, it doesn&#x27;t mean that
        knowledge of the whole Fridrich method is a prerequisite for
        blindfold-solving credibility. --- In

        With speed comes credibility. And people will listen to people who post
        fast time. I, unfortunately, know a cuber who&#x27;ll probably never get
        beyond 19 seconds because he kept waiting for this magical
        &quot;Waterman&quot; corners-first method. The method was never
        published. These algorithm sets were never &quot;released.&quot; The
        fast cuber who claimed this method existed kept saying that it
        wasn&#x27;t ready for release, that the public wasn&#x27;t ready for it
        yet. And now what&#x27;s he supposed to do? He dedicated over a year of
        his life focusing on this method because someone said they could average
        16.xx... and then he finds out later that it&#x27;s all just a big scam.
        That&#x27;s the only reason why I care. Otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t.
        People can say whatever they want, and until they beat me in
        competition, I don&#x27;t even have to throw them a glance. But seeing
        someone waste a year of their life on a magical method that never
        existed because someone claimed ridiculous times... that&#x27;s why I
        care. -Tyson On Dec 29, 2006, at 2:27 PM, Daniel Beyer wrote: > As long

        That does raise some points though for consideration. If the method was
        never published, how did he waste a year? Did he just sit there and wait
        for a delivery? In the meantime it&#x27;d be better to become familiar
        with the workings of the cube or try out another fast method that will
        at least get you somewhat near the time you desire -- no one is ever
        doomed to be stuck at the 19 barrier. It&#x27;s one&#x27;s own decision
        as to what they choose to listen to and what they do not, and if an
        entire method is being withheld, odds are you&#x27;re better off not
        listening. However, if a method&#x27;s workings are revealed and it
        shows to facilitate, then, logically, there is no harm in listening if
        one chooses to. --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,
