          <div class="email-content">If you&#x27;re having a huge issue, you must be cubing through some pain 
right now.  Are all of your solves extremely painful and you&#x27;re

did you manage this week&#x27;s BLD contest with your left ring finger by 
the way?  Is it a non-painful issue that could get worse with time and 
isn&#x27;t affecting you now?

Are you still having that massive wrist pain?  I still think that video 
you produced playing Quasar at 1.5 speed while you had massive wrist 
pain was a really bad idea.  That could only contribute to your injury. 
  I guess that&#x27;s what initially caused you to go from 15.15 seconds 
average to 24 right?  It would be a shame for the injury to really 
flare up and destroy your BLD times as well.

You might want to take it easy as not to exacerbate your multiple hand 
injuries.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve had this issue in my left hand for years, and it&#x27;s getting worse.
 As for the wrists, it&#x27;s mainly the right one (the left wrist has no
pain, but I imagine this is because my right hand is always included
in everything I do -- writing, typing, cubing, etc).  When I cube,
there is pain in the left ring finger but the right wrist just starts
burning up, especially during faster algorithms.  I&#x27;m trying not to
let the left ring finger touch the cube at all but it&#x27;s really
difficult and starting to irritate me to no end.

***NOTE*** Not for the squeamish:

Here are a few pics if you wanna see what I mean.  Compare my right
hand (no outward injuries) to my left (note the injury at the joint of
the ring finger base):

Right: http://img381.imageshack.us/img381/2571/rightvu7.jpg
Left: http://img381.imageshack.us/img381/2772/lefteo7.jpg

As for contests, yes I have to try to immobilize the left ring finger
and try to go a bit more calmly with the right wrist to avoid burn --
but it&#x27;s starting to become a big problem.  I&#x27;ve had the left-finger
injury since 5th grade, but only recently has it begun to hurt
strongly, and now it&#x27;s starting to screw with the rest of the finger.

And Stepmania -- hell no, there&#x27;s no way my wrists can take that right
now.  Luckily I don&#x27;t use my ring finger for keyboard play, but it
takes its toll on the wrists.  I haven&#x27;t touched SM too much lately at
all (mainly because I have DDR/ITG/SM mastered already and there isn&#x27;t
too much room for improvement, and it&#x27;s starting to become boring).  

And, well yes, wrist pain helped contribute to a speedcubing decline,
but really it&#x27;s because I find BLD to be more interesting than
speedcubing (stopped doing speedcubing, didn&#x27;t care for the pain,
didn&#x27;t care to keep algs in memory).  Anyone can pick up a cube and
learn to solve one looking -- but BLD takes it all a bit further and
really trains you to push the bounds of your memory and spatial
reasoning that speedcubing just doesn&#x27;t tend to tap into.

Anyways what do you think? Should I take a break from it all? I need
to get this damn finger operated on. Gahh.  I think SM really
contributed the most to the wrist issue.  I don&#x27;t know.  My hands just
*hurt* and it&#x27;s starting to get to me now -- I can just sit there and
not move, and just feel this sort of &quot;pain energy&quot; emanating from my
hands.  All I can say is, wo bu xihuan.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone.  Somewhat of a newb here...been working seriously on BLD
for about 2 weeks now.  I learned the 4 big algs from Stefan&#x27;s method,
and can solve the cube (looking) by just using those algs in probably
3 mins.  

I&#x27;ve started memorizing edges, and can come pretty close to solving
for position without looking again.  One major block I keep running
into is when the buffer edge position becomes accidentally solved. 
It&#x27;s not a big deal to shoot it to an unsolved edge and finish the
other 11, but what happens if that piece keeps coming back?  A couple
of times during memorization, I have to shoot that edge out 3 or more
times.  Is there a way to detect quickly a good place to send it so
you don&#x27;t have to deal with it frequently and essentially waste a
memorization slot?  Best case would be to figure out the *last* edge
in the cycle and put it there so you can forget about it until the
end.  It&#x27;s not really about speed, so much as it would help not to
have to use so many memory spaces for essentially useless information.

I&#x27;m using a Method of Loci approach to memorization.  Each piece has a
name (and a picture) associated with it.  I &quot;walk&quot; a familiar path,
and each location gets a picture stored in it.  It works well, but
like I say, I don&#x27;t want to waste spaces with information that can be
avoided.

Any other tips while learning?

Oh, I should also add that I solve using Petrus (intermediate method)
in about 60s.  BLD is not my first foray into solving. ;)

          <strong>6. commutators for 3x3x3 BLD edges</strong><br>
          <em>From:</em> &quot;cmhardw&quot; &lt;foozman17@...&gt;<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

I have been working on my 3x3x3 BLD a lot lately, and finally found 
a way to speed up my times slightly.

Because I solve the bigger cubes BLD much more often than the 3x3x3 
I am starting to think in terms of commutators when in a BLD solve 
on any cube.  For the bigger cubes this is great, I see a case, I 
immediately recall the commutator, and I just mindlessly execute.

However for the 3x3x3 I found that often I would see the case then 
immediately recall the commutator to solve it, as if it were a case 
that came up on either corners or central edges on 5x5x5 BLD.   Then 
I would push the move out of my head and try to recall the setup turn
(s) I need to use so that I can do a 2gen 3 cycle, or a 9 move edge 
cycle or something.  I solve corners on all cubes the exact same 
way, using solely commutators to both flip and move them, so really 
this only applies to solving edges.

Well lately I&#x27;ve been trying to solve edges during regular 3x3x3 BLD 
almost exactly the same way I solve the central edges for 5x5x5 BLD, 
since this is how I solve a 3x3x3 the most often (since I often 
solve the 5x5x5 more than the 3x3x3).

I&#x27;ve found that my memorization times haven&#x27;t changed, since I 
haven&#x27;t really done anything different, but my executions are 
getting a little bit faster and so are my times.  I now get sub-2 
fairly often, and I average sub-2:20 fairly often I&#x27;d say.

Here is an example of what I mean.

I restrict the L and R faces when solving the 3x3x3.  Say I already 
had my edges oriented, and I had the case UR->FR->BL

It used to be that I would do this to solve that cycle: F&#x27; B&#x27; R2 U F 
B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U R2 B F

However on the 5x5x5 I always always always solve that case like 
this: F&#x27; U F e2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F e2

So now on the 3x3x3 I solve that case with the same way as the 
5x5x5: F&#x27; U F E2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F E2

Well when that case comes up on the 3x3x3 the very first thing that 
pops into my head is &quot;middle slice base, lone edge at UR&quot; or 
basically the alg F&#x27; U F e2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F e2.  Well instead of pushing 
that out of my head and then doing the more typical two setup turn 
then a 3 cycle I now just solve using the commutator.

Another example is UF->DF->DR

I used to solve that case like this: U r2 R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U 
R2 r2 U&#x27; which I usually performed half like U r2 and half like U L2 
x2 at the beginning.

On the 5x5x5 if the central edges are in that case I always solve 
with: m&#x27; U2 m D&#x27; m&#x27; U2 m D

Well now on the 3x3x3 I would solve that case with M&#x27; U2 M D&#x27; M&#x27; U2 
M D

I know it&#x27;s probably faster to solve with the setup turns and the 2 
gen 3 cycle but I always recall the commutator before the setup 
turns now, so now I just solve with commutators when on the 3x3x3 
too.

One last example, though really there are a number of cases I now do 
very differently.

Say I have the cycle UR->FR->BR

I used to solve with F&#x27; B R2 U F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U R2 B&#x27; F

But now I would always use F&#x27; U F&#x27; E2 F U&#x27; F&#x27; E2 F2 instead since 
that&#x27;s how I would solve that case for central edges on 5x5x5 BLD.

I just wanted to post about this because I&#x27;ve tried to get my times 
faster using the more standard algs in these cases, but I always 
lose time trying to push the commutator out of my head that I think 
of when I see a case in order to remember the &quot;standard&quot; move I 
should do there.  Well I&#x27;d rather slow down execution very slightly 
in order to speed up the transition between recall and execution, as 
well as flow, and so far it seems to be helping.  Plus, maybe it 
doesn&#x27;t even slow execution down that much.  Look at the case UF->DF-
>DR.  I used to perform 15 moves to solve that case, and now I solve 
it in 8.  Sure I don&#x27;t really use finger tricks now, but I do almost 
half the moves though.  Also, though it may not seem like it, you 
can finger trick the move F&#x27; U F&#x27; E2 F U&#x27; F&#x27; E2 F2 somewhat well 
with practice.

Not sure if this has already been used as a strategy for the 3x3x3, 
but I&#x27;m finding that it is helping me out to solve like this now.

Happy BLD&#x27;ing everyone,
Chris</div>

I need to really focus on practicing with the alg set.
  I also need to practice using my system for parity fixes.  I suggested to Marcus how I see that it could be effectively used.  However, it is only hypothetical.  I want to use it myself and prove that it&#x27;s possible.
  Chris, your ways of thinking in commutators are definitely going to help you out in the long run for blindfolded cubing, so keep it up!

          <div class="email-content">I remember when I was a kid.  I would look at rubiks cube in the 
bookstores and I would see that I could not understand any of it. 
Even the Simple Solution. The only book that I could really pick up 
from was Ideal Toy Solutions book. That book had pictures and arrows 
and the cube was colored and it showed a position.  I think I lost 
that book. I was wondering if there any books as simple as that or 
anywhere online that is as good as that.  I remember it went into 
detail on solving one side.

It seems like from reading this site and others. It helps if you are 
advanced in math because you come across a term like Algorithms. Now 
I did good in math when I was in school.    But my solution, does 
not seem to have anything to do with math concepts. Here is the way 
I solve the cube. Solve 1 side and solve it in such a way that the 
first layers are filled with the colors next to it.  And I try to 
get the side on the bottom cornered up.  Than I solve that side and 
try to solve the layer in between.  

Right now I want to get faster and learn new methods. so, I have to 
accept the fact I have to work hard at learning from the solutions 
that are out there?

&quot;Algorithm&quot; is probably a confusing word. It&#x27;s really just a sequence of
moves that you can learn, that has a particularly useful effect on the
cube.

Though, if your interest is to get fast, you can try the speedcubing

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

A normal solve with Pochmann&#x27;s method usually takes me between 3:00 
and 3:30. That is 1:30 - 1:45 for memorisation and the rest for 
solving. 

Can you explain to me what you mean by analysing and memorising? 
When a friend of mine saw this, he thought you might be memorising 
it &#x27;the hard way&#x27; (because he used to memorise in a very difficult 
way). If you can explain to me what it is exactly that you are 
doing, I might be able to give you some clues...

          <div class="email-content">thanks Joel

In fact , when I begin to blindsolve a cube I search the path to 
solve , I start with edges so, first for example the white/red then 
yellow/blue and when I have finished with the edges .... I see if I 
must d thr parity , and then I try to memorize... Idem for the 
corners... that&#x27;s why I analyze and then I memorise... I should 
memorise in the time I search the path in fact , but I don&#x27;t manage 
to...

          <div class="email-content">Nope, no photographic memory.  How can you claim a world record, simply because you picked up on a method quickly.    Naturals learners spend months practicing everything they do.  Even if they don&#x27;t realize it.  It&#x27;s the on-going practice that&#x27;ll make you better, no photgraphic memory allows you to claim the world record.  I can understand this gift of his inspiring him to shoot for a world record.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s everybody&#x27;s goal.  
  I had very high expectations for G.wiz and Rutgers.  I knew, I was going for top 3, no matter who was there.  I knew I wasn&#x27;t world record, but I knew what I could do.  *Note:  I didn&#x27;t exactly perform at Rutgers ...*
  Well, I don&#x27;t know why he guarentee&#x27;s a world record ... has he even competed?  *checks* ... hehe nope

          <div class="email-content">I never found those instances particularly irritating,
though I have to admit it usually isn&#x27;t very tasteful.
 It is better to let people realize these barriers on
their own.  The approach of bashing their goals (even
if they are unrealistic) is less tasteful than the
original statement.

What actual harm could come from someone&#x27;s
overconfidence?  The only answer I can think of for
this is their own personal disappointment, which you
have very little, or no right, to share.  

What harm could come from immediate doubt and
accusations?  There are many answers to this, and as a
whole I believe it harms both the individual in
question as well as the community.  It is possible
that you quash this person&#x27;s motivation when he/she
may have actually provided quality ideas for the
community.

Sift through the bullshit and take what you will from
other&#x27;s public comments -- There is no reason to
express a public dislike for someone&#x27;s comments. 
Especially you Tyson.  You are a public figure and as
such you represent the community.  The message we are
trying to portray shouldn&#x27;t be that of attacking
unsupported claims by someone we don&#x27;t know, on a
medium (unofficial records list) that isn&#x27;t reliable
or marginally serious to begin with.   

Leave people to humble themselves -- it is better this
way.

Richard

          <div class="email-content">There are plenty of corner o&#x27;s that still give me problems when 
memorizing.  Mostly the ones with 6 or more, but sometimes the ones 
with 5 too.  

Like this one, for example:  UFR=2, UFL=1, UBL=0, UBR=1, DFR=1, 
DFL=2, DBL=0, DBR=2.  That&#x27;s just one example of a case that is hard 
for me to memorize quickly- say in order to have any chance to solve 
the cube in 80 sec.  

There are also some unpleasant edge o&#x27;s.  Like this one for example:

UL, UB, FR, BR, DL, DB flipped.  Again, it&#x27;s a matter of being able 
to memorize quickly.  

When I get a harder corner orientation combined with a harder edge 
orientation, it&#x27;s really hard to memorize fast enough to get an 80 
sec solve, let alone sub-90.  

So I am thinking Mr. Chen must have some interesting insights into 
this problem and could help.

If the CO cases are not balanced, you can then memorize the balancing case.  With 3 looks, you could memorize all the needed information with pictures.  I recently generated the 9 2-gen cases to solve the U/D layer, and to balance the two.  I&#x27;ll post them later.  A few of the cases are psuedo 2-gen, that is, you&#x27;ll do a 2-gen alg in the RU subset, then a 2-gen alg in the MU or LU subset.  
  The seven Balanced Cases:
  Sune, Anti-Sune, Double Sune, Triple Sune, Bruno, U CO, T CO
  Balancers:

  Farewell, I&#x27;ve no cube on me at the moment, but I&#x27;ll post what I&#x27;ve found, and I must test some more things.

When I get a harder corner orientation combined with a harder edge

So I am thinking Mr. Chen must have some interesting insights into

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

Marcus Stuhr posted about his method a while back.. He doesn&#x27;t only 
memorise 1/7 CO cases on U face and D face, he can also recognise 
them on the other 4 faces. In this case, after x&#x27;, you can do

R&#x27; U&#x27; (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) U R

to solve the CO on the F face. Then, x2, and some alg for the B 
face.. I&#x27;d do 2 sunes:

R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27;UR - L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27;

The problem with this approach is, that you have to be able to 
recognise these cases on different faces and different angles...

          <div class="email-content">Right, but after some practice you see cases much more quickly.  I
tend to look on U and D first to see if there are any of the 7 cases,
then I check F and B, then L and R.  If you don&#x27;t see anything juicy,
then you basically have a bad CO case.  Usually memorizing a small
adjustment of an arbitrary layer turn will yield better results, but
you must, of course, remember which layer you turned and in what
direction in order to undo it after executing your orientation algorithms.

I am thinking about switching to CO + CP for the corners.. I tried 
to do only CO today (memo + solve), and for cases that I recognise, 
I can get sub 20 :D.. I even got an 11.. But for the cases that are 
bad, it takes me so long.. 

How long does CO take you? (memo + solve) And could you post the 
algs and patterns that you use sometime..? Or e-mail them to me?

          <div class="email-content">I am wondering, how do you propose recognizing cases on different faces?  Yes I understand applying them on the L/R, or F/B faces if there is a nice case.  But are you saying you can look at an arbitrary face and recognize the orientation of those four corners on that face w/ respect to the U/D layer?
   
  I am really having trouble using 3-cycles in blindfolded cubing.  My thought process doesn&#x27;t involve three cycles.  At all, it&#x27;s by far not a new concept to me, however, I just haven&#x27;t come to an decent understanding, one that is sufficient enough to allow me to blindfold solve with 3-cycles.  It would be rather nice to work w/ other cubist person to person, and see what they&#x27;ve to SHOW about their methods.

          <div class="email-content">CO takes me just a few seconds to memorize and requires anywhere from
1-3 algorithms to execute.  On a good case, memo+exec can take as
little as 10 seconds (for example, seeing a Sune on U and an Antisune
on D).  The crappiest cases may take up to 20 (seeing a Cowskull on B
and a Spider on F after doing a setup move).  I&#x27;ve posted a link on
this forum to my CO method a few times, I&#x27;ll dig it up later when I
get the chance (my hard drive crashed and so I&#x27;m directing efforts to
salvaging as much as I can.  I&#x27;m on Ubuntu right now).  It really
depends on person to person though -- my strength lies in
memorization, but my execution is probably nowhere near what most of
you guys can do.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

          <div class="email-content">So there&#x27;s not a required benefit to completing a solve with a very 
ugly parity?  Not even if you DNF your first two solves in competition 
and on your 3rd solve, and last chance, you run into an ugly parity?

Or what if you ran into an ugly parity on the central edges and 
corners of a 5x5x5 BLD solve in competition?  There&#x27;s no required 
benefit there either?

I personally have experienced the second situation, and it sure felt 
required to me to finish that ugly parity case.

I can&#x27;t think of a way to say this without sounding mean, but I really 
feel like you would approach your solving much differently if you went 
to a competition once and tried it out.

Yeah, I practiced CO + CP a lot the past 2 days.. It&#x27;s really cool 
how on easy cases, CO can be memorised in just a few seconds, when 
you get some nice patterns! I also did a whole corners solve in a 
little over 40 seconds (incl. memo) which is a new record for me... 
So I am probably switching to this method for the corners :).

Maybe I should search in the older posts..

Oh, and I see how your strength is memo... I saw a video :). 
Execution was a bit awkward to watch, but I which I could memorise 
that fast.

Hey Daniel,

Well... If you have to do a sune on the U face to orient the pieces 
(+ U2 + corrective 3 edge cycle), you can easily see the pattern 
there. If you have to do a sune on the R face to correctly orient 
the pieces in the R layer (with respect to the U/D layers), you 
would see a differnt pattern. 

For example, say the FRU, FBU and FBD corners need to be rotated 
clockwise. In that case, you would have a sune there.. You just have 
to recognise that that is the pattern of a Sune on the R face (from 
that angle). Now, to solve that, you could do:

z&#x27; (R&#x27; U2 RUR&#x27;UR) U&#x27; (R2 U&#x27; R&#x27;U&#x27; RURU RU&#x27;R) U&#x27; z

The same idea applies for different cases.. When recognise these 
cases by looking at the patterns, rather than memorising 1&#x27;s and 
2&#x27;s, it speeds up the memo proces :).

          <div class="email-content">There is no required benefit to cubing in general -- if I run into an
ugly parity, I don&#x27;t usually care to solve it because I see no reason
to.  It just ruins an otherwise potentially fast solve.  Call it lazy,
but I just don&#x27;t feel the need to finish out a solve at that point. 
If I DNF the first two solves out of three then of course I&#x27;d have to
run the third solve through regardless of the cases that arise.  But
this isn&#x27;t an official competition and so I don&#x27;t see why solving
parities through is such a vital issue.  

On the bigger cubes, at least, parity errors are still pretty bad, but
those cubes take so much longer to solve so parity fixes tend to be
negligable in duration compared to total solve time.  With 3x3&#x27;s,
though, parities just dominate me.  They add a significant amount of
time percentage-wise.

          <div class="email-content">Haha it&#x27;s nice to see someone else giving the method a shot.  It
really does make memorization a lot faster.  It becomes even easier
once you apply memory mnemonics to the individual cases, because then
inspection of the corners becomes reflexive to the memory -- you can
just look at the cases and your mind will already begin to form the
memory hooks required for recall later on during execution.  Trying to
inspect corners individually or by using numbers will just slow things
down -- it&#x27;s much easier for the human mind to latch onto familiar
patterns, and so it makes sense to memorize the cube in this way.

          <div class="email-content">I see a strength in my corner method.  I can solve + memo corners in about 45s.  I memorize a piece at a time.  I don&#x27;t memorize orientations.  They&#x27;ve no bearing to my method.  Even disoriented pieces I solve by two Y Perms.  2 sunes is a lot faster than two Y perms though.  So I should really learn to recongnize corner orientatation.  Just thinkning about how I can use the 2-gen balancers that I think I can solve disoriented corners at the very end.  I&#x27;ve a lot to learn before I can become faster. I&#x27;ve worked on my own blindfolded method which has become fast.  Now, I must take it a step up, and have multiple methods.  It&#x27;ll make bld a lot easier.  
   
  I&#x27;m going to post the CO algs that I came up w/ on my website soon, and Marcus, you&#x27;ll have to take a look at them.
   
  2-cycles really are great for the pleasure of setups.  If I had a 7 cycle, the memo + execution would be sweet.  It just sucks when you have a 3 cycle, a 2 cycle, and 2 disoriented corners!

once you apply memory mnemonics to the individual cases, because then
inspection of the corners becomes reflexive to the memory -- you can
just look at the cases and your mind will already begin to form the
memory hooks required for recall later on during execution. Trying to
inspect corners individually or by using numbers will just slow things
down -- it&#x27;s much easier for the human mind to latch onto familiar
patterns, and so it makes sense to memorize the cube in this way.

          <div class="email-content">No point turning this into a flame war. You know that&#x27;s not going to go anywhere. But 
there are some worthwhile issues brought up here. 

First, Marcus in the past you&#x27;ve posted some incredible BLD times, even on scrambles with 
parity. What&#x27;s caused this current trouble with parity? Have you made some change to your 
system that makes parity that much worse? Is there something you&#x27;re doing that a 
newcomer might want to avoid? You also once said EP caused you a lot of trouble, but now 
it doesn&#x27;t seem to be hurting your times. How did you deal with your EP problems?

Tyson, yes, parity can be helpful by solving twice as many pieces as a regular cycle, but for 
some people it can be troublesome. Personally, I (nearly) always leave the parity fix to the 
final step, though I know there could be faster fixes done in the middle of EP. I just have 
trouble trying to see potential parity fixes while still doing EP at reasonable speed. How do 
you look at parity fix during a solve? 

Also, parity could be made easier by dropping specific pieces during permutation, rather 
than just leaving the final cubie of the cycle, to leave a simpler (all pieces in U or 
something) parity case. Has anyone looked into this?

          <div class="email-content">EP still gives some trouble, but parity does as well.  Improving EP
would bring down the times quite a bit.  I&#x27;m comfortable with corners
and don&#x27;t see those improving any time soon.  Some parities are quick
and easy to solve, but other times I have to really strain and think
about setup moves and it&#x27;s a depressing notion with respect to
minimizing times.

          <div class="email-content">I have the most horrible memory ever (Tyson is my witness), so I try
getting rid of parity in between solving CP and EP.  Usually I will
try to find a setup into the U/F/D/B face PLL like Tyson mentioned,
but if I realize I need to think for more than two seconds to figure
it out, I will instead cycle the pieces involved into the same face.
At most, this would be one extra cycle to move four pieces, which
means like 5 seconds of solve time?  That&#x27;s definitely smaller than
the standard deviation already present in the solve times.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tyson,

As a side note, I did post one solution to this problem as it applies 
to the big cubes.

http://tinyurl.com/sgru3

Basically, one unit for me is two pieces combined into one image.  So 
if I forget one unit, I&#x27;m in effect forgetting two consecutive pieces 
out of my cycle.

It turns out though, that this idea works if the unit is one 
individual piece.

So if you have the cycle (ABCDEFGH) where each letter cooresponds to 
one piece of the cube (say the corners) then if you forget piece E 
say, you can do this:

You see the cycle as (ABCD?FGH)

Perform: (ABC)

Perform (ADF)
Perform (AGH)

Then once you remember that the piece you skipped was in fact the &quot;E&quot; 
piece, you have to take the spot after that location in your cycle, 
here the &quot;F&quot; location, and use it to &quot;pick-up&quot; the E spot.

Basically always use the location after the one you forgot as the 
beginning of your &quot;pick-up&quot; cycle to complete the cycle, and also to 
keep going past a piece you forget.

So for this example you can finish the cube by doing the cycle (EF) 
which is a parity fix.

Again this is just one solution to the problem, but it works very well 
on the bigger cubes, and I&#x27;ve often still managed to get a very fast 
time even though I forgot one image for even as long as a minute 
before recalling it, since I can still continue solving other pieces 
and &quot;pick-up&quot; my forgotten piece at the very end of the solve.

Not sure if this applies as well to the 3x3x3 method, I don&#x27;t claim to 
be any sort of expert there, but this method has done wonders for my 
big cubes BLD times.

Hey Marcus,

Did you ever think about learning alg for other patterns than the ones 
that just solve 4 corners in 1 layer? For example... Suppose you have 
a bad CO. Maybe you can have alg memorised for any pattern that can 
occur in the U layer, but the algs would also twist the DRF corner, 
for example. Example: setup: (RF&#x27;R&#x27;F RU&#x27;R&#x27;U )*2. Suppose you only look 
at the U layer. You can just solve that pattern with 
(RU&#x27;R&#x27;U RF&#x27;R&#x27;F)*2. Then you can just memorise the D layer ignoring the 
DRF corner (or imagine which solvable pattern the D layer would become 
after solving the U layer). Are you already using such algorithms?

Ok even though I don&#x27;t understand why you would want to do that, I 
can at least see things from your point of view and can understand 
that yes when your times are as fast as they are, then yes parity 
would affect your time proportionally much more than it would affect 
mine.

By the way, what would you say is your overall accuracy rate?  I 
mean with you abandoning solves due to hard parity, in cases where 
pretty much everyone else would continue the solve and often still 
succeed, it can&#x27;t be all that high?  I mean I can understand 
sacrificing accuracy in order to achieve much faster times, I do the 
same on the bigger cubes when I plateau at a certain time and want 
to improve.

How much would you say your accuracy is affected in order to get 
that extra boost in your times?

&quot;Algorithm&quot; is probably a confusing word. It&#x27;s really just a sequence of
moves that you can learn, that has a particularly useful effect on the
cube.

Though, if your interest is to get fast, you can try the speedcubing

You could have not known what to do for the parity fix.  You may have forgotten to do solve the last edge w/ Pochmann&#x27;s method.  You could have really screwed up.  I&#x27;ve popped in competition, the physical reinsertion can cause the cube to be unsolvable.  The mental distraction can cause you to lose your place during an algorithm or during cycle.  
  A dnf means nothing really, the term DNF is used in all cubing events.  This is just a high risk cubing event.  You can&#x27;t see what the hell you&#x27;re doing.  There is a risk you&#x27;ll not solve the puzzle.  Cubes pop, tiles fold back over on magics, overturns are made (however this only results in a 2s penalty).

  A dnf means nothing really, the term DNF is used in all  cubing events.  This is just a high risk cubing event.  You can&#x27;t see what the hell you&#x27;re doing.  There is a risk you&#x27;ll not solve the puzzle.  Cubes pop, tiles fold back over on magics, overturns are made (however this only results in a 2s penalty).

          <div class="email-content">Accuracy is being defined as how many times will you solve the cube in your attempts.
  Well, how close are you when you are unsuccessful, consider this, can somebody else look at the cube and say wow that was really close.  Or do you not even know what happened yourself.  As Marcus said, he just takes a DNS when he sees there is a parity.  Perhaps this is a wise decision on his part.  I think he could do a lot better, I&#x27;ve tried to help him w/ it all, but he doesn&#x27;t grasp the concepts I&#x27;m trying to show him.
   
  I&#x27;ll sometimes take a DNS if I have a bunch of small cycles, because, it is hard on memorization and execution using my current method.  We all have our preferences, well rounded stengths, and our weaknesses.  So stop complaining about all of the problems you have, and try to fix them.  If you can&#x27;t ... then try again!
   
  This forum is being crowded by people arguing and it&#x27;s so damned stupid!  You all discredit somebody, who has acclaimed fast times.  Yet, he discredits himself by complaining all the time as well.  It&#x27;s no wonder that you second guess his credibility.  Because he constantly says he has difficulty with almost everything cubing related.  First parities, edge permutation, then a finger injury.  He sees something that he can improve upon.  EP is what he wants to improve upon at the expense of cubes w/ parities.  I really hate reading all of this crap.  There&#x27;s always room for improvement in cubing.  And there surely is a lot of improvement that needs to happen on this blindfolded cubing forum.  
   
  Nobody discredits Chris when he makes a hypothesis about the limits of big cube bld.  Yet, you discredit somebody that is reaching the limits of 3x3 bld?

          <div class="email-content">Hello everybody,

I&#x27;ve been practicing BLD yesterday, and I am improving... Practicing 
CO+CP is slowly paying off now.. I had 6 succesfull solves in a row, 
and 2 of them were done with CO+CP, and they were faster times than 
the other ones :). But then again, I decided to do CO + CP because I 
saw that the cases were easy.

Anyway, I am practicing CP now (sighted), and when I get a lot of 
three cycles it&#x27;s OK, but when I end up with 2 or 3 2-cycles, things 
can get a little nasty. Are there any nices algo&#x27;s for that, or do I 
just setup and do an E perm? (Or H-perm + U2, I know that one too ;)). 

Trying to look for nice algs for these situtations, I found this one:

x&#x27;  RU&#x27;L&#x27; U2 L U R&#x27;  D2  R U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L U R&#x27; D2  x

Commutator :). Anyone got a better alg for that? Or else.. Maybe this 
alg is usefull for ohters.

Well, Cyou!

  LoL take out the frickin pawn before the king can flank it, protecting it from capture.  You know once your opponent&#x27;s king is in the 3x3 square centered about the pawn.  Well then unless they totally blunder, you&#x27;re gonna soon face a K + Q vs K and surely lose.  That is, if the opponent knows what he&#x27;s doing.  

  Sadly ... I used to play an opponent, who I was a little better than.  I felt that if I blundered, giving him my queen.  I would resign.  He would take the win happily, and I&#x27;d end off w/ a 4-1 record for the day.  He insisted one day that I play no matter what because I had a few bad weeks, and I wasn&#x27;t in the mental mindset to continue playing, I would cut my losses, and ask for a rematch. ... I happily walked away undefeated for several weeks, even when I left my queen wide open.  I began to play my strategy to sac my queen for positional gain, just because he thought it would bother me, however it did not detrimentally affect gameplay.  He began to realize life was better when I resigned after making major blunders
  He thought he knew my weaknesses, and my strategies, then I changed opening repitoire :)

  So I can understand Marcus&#x27;s problem.  And actually I&#x27;ve told him it&#x27;s not his endgame on the rubik&#x27;s cube!  It&#x27;s his opening repitoire.  He&#x27;s not being creative in the beginning, so it&#x27;s difficult in the end.  I think he&#x27;d be better off dealing w/ parities much sooner than he normally would.

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s not like there isn&#x27;t anything I don&#x27;t understand about
blindfold/speedcubing.  There isn&#x27;t anything I can&#x27;t do -- I just
don&#x27;t care about cubing as much as most of the people here.  I don&#x27;t
care about learning all the crazy lingo and experimental theories... I
just know how to see a case and execute it.  It&#x27;s similar to
higher-level math, really.  It scares many people off because the
notation and theories are seemingly complex, but at the basic level,
the execution is quite elegant and simple in nature if you look past
the unnecessarily cluttered outer layer.  I simply prefer to skip the
BS.  If I see an ugly parity, I just don&#x27;t care to solve it -- I know
I could solve it, but it isn&#x27;t going to really help me significantly.
 It&#x27;s like shooting for a AAA score (perfect) on a DDR song -- the
moment you get a Great (near-perfect) judgment, is it really worth
finishing the song even though the AAA is now impossible? For the sake
of the AAA, it isn&#x27;t, especially if you know that you can execute the
rest of the song without error.  The practice isn&#x27;t really needed.  I
don&#x27;t see what the big ruckus is all about with respect to giving up
on certain parities.  Also, just because I feel like my EP is slow
doesn&#x27;t mean I suck at it -- I&#x27;m still fast, it&#x27;s just that other
parts of the execution are faster. 

I have many other hobbies and obligations so I don&#x27;t spend that much
time solving cubes much anymore, but I do know how to blindfold solve
a cube quickly, and I&#x27;ve posted my approaches and methods multiple
times.  There&#x27;s really nothing surprising about any of it -- practice
the method and you&#x27;ll get fast.  I&#x27;ve noticed that people don&#x27;t really
entertain the methods much.  Until you do, it&#x27;s illogical to discredit
the methods because they may be faster than what you do.  Most people
here have very good hand-speed (much better than my own), and so by no
means has the 3x3 BLD limit been hit (although I think my memorization
is as good as it can get... I&#x27;ve never been able to break 15 seconds I
think).  I think it&#x27;s possible to hit as low as 50 seconds with an
ideal method.

Out of all the communities I&#x27;m a part of, I feel that this one is
actually one of the coldest.  It isn&#x27;t like I&#x27;m not knowledgeable
about the necessary components of blind/speedsolving, but saying
someone&#x27;s a newbie because they didn&#x27;t waste time learning random
standard names for algorithms (or even standard internet algs
themselves) is a little ridiculous.  Some people like figuring things
out and having fun.  Too many people here take the competition a bit
too seriously, especially over a toy like the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  Call me a
newb for not finishing my parities or for not knowing what a Z-Perm or
A-Perm corresponds to, but I think I&#x27;d rather be spending my time on
more productive investments.

I&#x27;m gonna take a break from these groups and probably from cubing, at
least until it seems like the community is a bit more inviting. 
People are just skeptical to a sickening extent where it isn&#x27;t fun
anymore.  I get emails asking if I even have a hand injury! I posted
pics of that stuff, ffs.  People ask for videos and I post them, and
even then they suddenly don&#x27;t count even though I clearly show
randomized scrambles using your own approaches.  I even have a video
of a 1:02 solve but I didn&#x27;t record the scramble process so it&#x27;d
probably get called out as BS.  It seems like I can talk all day but
nobody really listens or takes my points or approaches into
consideration.  

Anyways, there isn&#x27;t much more to say, but I figured this all deserved
a longer post.  If you guys don&#x27;t believe my times, that&#x27;s fine, but
the veiled attacks are immature.  Happy cubing, I suppose -- I hope
people see that there is always room for improvement.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,

I think there is a huge miscommunication, and obviously we are all
taking pot shots at each other lately.  You stepped up and came out
and said exactly what was on your mind, and for the sake of
communication and the community I&#x27;ll do the same.  This message is a
bit long so please bear with me.

What&#x27;s on my mind is exactly this, I can&#x27;t figure out if you&#x27;re a fake
or not.  There is quite a bit of evidence in favor of you either being
a fake, or for you exaggerating your times or your abilities.  There
is also a good amount of evidence for you not being a fake, so I
really can&#x27;t say for certain which it is, because I don&#x27;t know.

Here are all the points I take into consideration when I think about this:

You used to be the #2 speedcuber in the world on speedcubing.com with
your 15.15 average.  Back at that time, 15.15 was an incredible time
and this brought you into the public light so to speak.

Then, a couple years later you said that you forgot your algorithms. 
This, to me, sounds like a lie.  I don&#x27;t see how it is possible to
forget your speedcubing algorithms unless you literally set your 15.15
and then immediately after that gave up on cubing for a year or more
and picked it back up.  I can see that being possible, and I could
accept that.

Also, your blindfolded accomplishments on speedcubing.com range from
the relay, to the fastest 3x3x3, fastest 4x4x4, and fastest 5x5x5
solver currently worldwide.

So you have in your career been the #2 speedcuber, and you are
currently the ranking fastest BLD cuber for everything basically,
except maybe multiple 3x3x3 cubes.

Yet you don&#x27;t ever practice, or you say that you don&#x27;t.  You don&#x27;t
take cubing as seriously as the rest of us do, your own words I&#x27;m
saying.  So for not really caring about it all that much, and for not
ever practicing you are the best in the world.  This, to me, also
seems like a lie.

To be fair though I see two things that could be going on here.  The
first way is that you are a fake and you&#x27;re lying about your
abilities.  The second way is that you really are capable of all of
this, and you really can achieve all of this yet you don&#x27;t care to set
the world records in official competition.  In that case you&#x27;re sort
of like Bobby Fischer, but even he still went into the public
spotlight officially and played in tournaments.  So even then I&#x27;m
confused as to what is going on, and the simplest explanation seems to
me to be that you&#x27;re faking your times.

Also, your new record times on the bigger cubes blindfolded have
always either come shortly after I have either broken your record
(like when I beat your 25 minute 5x5x5 record) or after a prediction I
would give on the limits of big cube BLD cubing.  Also after I got
sub-10 4x4 or sub-20 5x5 (and those two are pretty huge milestones or
at least they were for me) you would always come out and basically say
&quot;Oh yeah I&#x27;ve already gotten times that fast&quot;.  If you had already
beaten these huge barriers, why had you not come out and said anything
about it before?  So that is another reason I thought you were lying.

May I also mention that I am sick and tired of you setting amazing
times on the larger cubes, particularly the 5x5x5 BLD and yet you
always say you are either A) out of practice or B) forgetting your
memory hooks, etc..  You always, and you do this for the 3x3x3 too,
set amazing times and follow them with some sort of complaint about
how you are out of practice, or not at the top of your game.

Well let me tell you my side of it.  My record for the 5x5x5 BLD is
15:49.63 and that solve was absolutely beautiful.  I was absolutely at
the top of my game and have not ever had a better solve in my life on
that cube.  Encoding the pieces into images and later recalling them
was basically flawless compared to how I had faired before achieving
that time.  So to see you come out with a 14:32 after not having
practiced for a long time and also after you had said you needed to
relearn your memory hooks makes me think you&#x27;re a fake.  How can you
possibly be that fast and nowhere near the top of your game?

Your times undermine the work of people who actually do work hard and
put a lot of effort into getting faster, just to have you come out
with an incredibly fast time and then also complain about how you are
forgetting your memory hooks and you never are able to practice.  This
goes for the 3x3x3 too, since you undermine the work of Leyan and
Tyson and Chris and Shelley and many others who really do take BLD
cubing very seriously and practice often to try to get better.

I also find it interesting that to this day I still have absolutely no
idea how you even solve the bigger cubes blindfolded.  You have said
that you are working on applying 3 cycles to the bigger cubes, so I
imagine that now you are either using a 2-cycle method, or that you
have a number of algorithms memorized and you setup each three cycle
into one of those cases.

I also find it interesting that your advice is always extremely
general as it applies to the larger cubes.  You&#x27;ve never really put
forth new ideas in that area other than about memorization and even
then all you really mention is to try to use many different systems
(taken from your quote on your 25 minute solve).  Usually your advice
is a rewording of something someone else has already said.

Also, for the larger cubes the fact that you claim that you forgot
your memory system is definitely the largest piece of evidence I can
see against you.  This is the one thing that is so convincing to me
that it alone is what is making me believe so strongly that you are a
fake.  You knew your memory system well enough to memorize a 5x5x5
cube in under 10 minutes (I believe you had already by this point even
claimed your sub-7 memorization attempt), yet after maybe 2-3 months
of non-use you forgot your memory hooks and in your own words you said
you had to relearn them.  I haven&#x27;t even been using my images for as
long as you, and I can go for a week or more without doing a solve and
pretty much just jump right back in and do more solves.

Also, Ben Pridmore has over 2000 images memorized for his system, and
after roughly a year of not using his system he said he was able to
come back and remember pretty much his entire system.  The memory
community seems to insist that the system itself is ingrained in long
term memory and is not something that is short term and easily
forgettable.  Yet you say that you forgot yours.  They take memory
much more seriously than we do, and they disagree with your situation,
so I too think you must not be telling the truth.

That one reason is by far the biggest reason why I think you are a fake.

----------------------------------

Now here are the reasons why I think you&#x27;re for real.

You do occasionaly come out with really cool and new ideas, like your
CO memory system, your idea about solving cycles and various cycle
theory arguments to handle certain cases.  Also your 7 move 3 cycles
on the 3x3x3 are really damn cool, and I am trying to incorporate them
into my solving now too.

Also, I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how you could fake a 3x3x3
video and still have the timer being reset on camera.  You have made a
number of videos too which is more evidence that you are for real.

So those are the arguments in your favor, but the arguments against
you, and this is only my list, are more convincing to me.

So that&#x27;s it.  I came right out and said it.  I&#x27;m not putting it
behind a veil anymore, I&#x27;m not trying to get you to slip up by asking
you leading questions anymore.  I&#x27;m just coming right out and saying
it, I think you&#x27;re a fake.

Now, having said that, I would be perfectly willing to retract that
statement, and I will even give a formal apology on the speedcubing
group for having doubted you if you go to a competition and prove your
abilities.  I&#x27;m not talking smash all the world records, because we
all know from experience that bad days happen in competition.  I
personally was scared out of my mind while on stage at my very first
competition.

But basically my viewpoint is this.  I am for the most part convinced
that you are a fake, but I&#x27;m not so convinced that I am willing to say
I believe it 100%.  So, the way I am approaching it is this - I don&#x27;t
believe you are capable of doing what you say you are.  But if you go
to a competition and prove your abilities I will be one of the first
to shake your hand and apologize for having doubted your reputation
and your abilities, and having said so in public.

That&#x27;s exactly where I stand.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">&quot;Then, a couple years later you said that you forgot your algorithms.
This, to me, sounds like a lie. I don&#x27;t see how it is possible to
forget your speedcubing algorithms unless you literally set your 15.15
and then immediately after that gave up on cubing for a year or more
and picked it back up. I can see that being possible, and I could
accept that.&quot;

I did have a roughly 15-second average.  I also spent lots of time
using my hands for various hobbies.  At one point the pain was just
too much and my hands started burning constantly.  I didn&#x27;t speedcube
much anymore, and I still don&#x27;t even today.  Yeah, I forgot many
algorithms. My F2L was pretty cool, too -- I also made note of how
other pieces changed and was able to better look ahead.  

&quot;Yet you don&#x27;t ever practice, or you say that you don&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t
take cubing as seriously as the rest of us do, your own words I&#x27;m
saying. So for not really caring about it all that much, and for not
ever practicing you are the best in the world. This, to me, also
seems like a lie.&quot;

I don&#x27;t know what else to say to that... I&#x27;ve always been good at
things I do with little practice.  Sometimes much repetition is needed
to learn things, and sometimes you only need to see something once or
twice.  I&#x27;ve accomplished a lot over the years and could go into
detail if you wanted, but it&#x27;d be a bit pointless.  But again I make
the point that many people cube without really focusing on improvement
in an active manner.  How else do you think people are now clocking 13
second averages? When they practice, they focus on improvement.  Most
people try to improve passively, and this just isn&#x27;t as effective.

&quot;Also, your new record times on the bigger cubes blindfolded have
always either come shortly after I have either broken your record
(like when I beat your 25 minute 5x5x5 record) or after a prediction I
would give on the limits of big cube BLD cubing. Also after I got

&quot;Oh yeah I&#x27;ve already gotten times that fast&quot;. If you had already
beaten these huge barriers, why had you not come out and said anything
about it before? So that is another reason I thought you were lying.&quot;

Well to be fair, every time I came out with a new barrier-break, I&#x27;d
get attacked.  So eventually I just didn&#x27;t care to post anymore when I
broke personal bests.

&quot;May I also mention that I am sick and tired of you setting amazing
times on the larger cubes, particularly the 5x5x5 BLD and yet you
always say you are either A) out of practice or B) forgetting your
memory hooks, etc.. You always, and you do this for the 3x3x3 too,
set amazing times and follow them with some sort of complaint about
how you are out of practice, or not at the top of your game.&quot;

Sorry I don&#x27;t take the cube as seriously? You can still do well even
if you don&#x27;t feel up to snuff.

&quot;Your times undermine the work of people who actually do work hard and
put a lot of effort into getting faster, just to have you come out
with an incredibly fast time and then also complain about how you are
forgetting your memory hooks and you never are able to practice. This
goes for the 3x3x3 too, since you undermine the work of Leyan and
Tyson and Chris and Shelley and many others who really do take BLD
cubing very seriously and practice often to try to get better.&quot;

I don&#x27;t know how to reply to this -- am I supposed to apologize for my
times? Ask people in my Wharton classes why they sometimes get pissed
at me -- I never go to certain classes and still get A&#x27;s while others
spend hours studying and cramming but only get C&#x27;s or B&#x27;s.  I spent a
small amount of time studying for the SAT&#x27;s and still aced the thing.
 What I do doesn&#x27;t undermine anyone, really.  It&#x27;s not like anyone
else can&#x27;t allocate in similar manners.  Sometimes you don&#x27;t need a
whole lot of practice to improve something.  Sometimes you do.  It&#x27;s
really case-by-case.

&quot;I also find it interesting that to this day I still have absolutely no
idea how you even solve the bigger cubes blindfolded. You have said
that you are working on applying 3 cycles to the bigger cubes, so I
imagine that now you are either using a 2-cycle method, or that you
have a number of algorithms memorized and you setup each three cycle
into one of those cases.&quot;

You can ask Beyer -- I&#x27;ve sent him quite a few of my algs.  I don&#x27;t
have them on me due to my Harddrive wipe, but it&#x27;s all basically
3-cycle.  I set up pieces into predefined cases and execute
mindlessly.  They are commutators, but most cases can be simplified
into easier cases.  Think of it like F2L - nobody wants to come out
and say they use algorithms here, but there is a certain degree of
automation involved.  It isn&#x27;t 100% intuitive with every move you make
on every solve.

&quot;Usually your advice is a rewording of something someone else has
already said.&quot;

I&#x27;ve posted many things that aren&#x27;t mere rewordings.  I mean most of
the approaches with speed/blindsolving is really intuitive in terms of
execution after you understand how a 3x3x3 works -- it&#x27;s the memory
that sets things apart.  

&quot;... yet after maybe 2-3 months of non-use you forgot your memory
hooks and in your own words you said
you had to relearn them.&quot;

Relearning doesn&#x27;t take long for me.  It&#x27;s a matter of just moving
anything slightly out of memory back into reflex.  I still have the
images memorized, but it&#x27;s the difference between &quot;JT.... hmm this was
Jet&quot; and &quot;JET!&quot; Our standards may be different for what is considered
insufficient with respect to memory.  Just because I say &quot;Eh I&#x27;m
rusty,&quot; it only means I&#x27;m just not at the top of my game -- doesn&#x27;t
mean I still can&#x27;t do things quickly.  I mean even on DDR, my limbs
can feel cold and I&#x27;ll feel totally out of it but still do better than
85% of the other people that play the game.  It&#x27;s not like I totally
forget my memory hooks to the point of going &quot;Wow I totally can&#x27;t
recall what that was.&quot;  The only things I forgot were old speedcubing
algs that I didn&#x27;t care to use anymore or keep in muscle memory.

--------------------

&quot;You do occasionaly come out with really cool and new ideas, like your
CO memory system, your idea about solving cycles and various cycle
theory arguments to handle certain cases. Also your 7 move 3 cycles
on the 3x3x3 are really damn cool, and I am trying to incorporate them
into my solving now too.&quot;

Again, a lot of what I say isn&#x27;t mere rehash.  In the past I have
spent a fair amount of time figuring out different ways to do things.
 I truly think my CO method is the best out there.  I can reduce my CO
memory to three letters -- one telling the turn of the U and D layers,
one telling you Alg 1, and one telling you Alg 2.  Easy.  Good luck
finding that little tidbit said by anyone else - I guarantee you
nobody else uses my newer CO approach right now.  Craig Bouchard and
Beyer have seen my algs for it (I don&#x27;t have them on this harddrive),
but basically you can break CO down into two cases and solve each
separately.  As a result, you only need three letters for CO.  When
you look at the whole cube, you&#x27;re essentially remembering: Three
letters for CO, one word for CP, one word or phrase for EO, and
roughly 5 words for EP.  That&#x27;s a total of roughly 10 memory hooks,
and they aren&#x27;t even numbers! They&#x27;re easy-to-remember hooks, and they
make recall so easy.  Why people don&#x27;t understand this is beyond me. 
Try the damn method, people! Don&#x27;t just sit there and whine about how
my times are impossible when you aren&#x27;t even giving the approach a
fair shake.  Use my CO method.  Use Major for CP.  Use Binary for EO.
 Use Image for EP.  Know how to break down CO and EO cases into
brainless execution.  Recognize even and odd EO cases per layer.  Know
how to manipulate cycles that seem unwieldy by using manipulations of
dual cycles.  Memorizing things rotely or using numbers will usually
hold you back.

&quot;Also, I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how you could fake a 3x3x3
video and still have the timer being reset on camera. You have made a
number of videos too which is more evidence that you are for real.&quot;

I&#x27;m surprised that nobody really pays attention to this.  They seem
real because *THEY ARE*.  I mean ffs, guys. 

&quot;Now, having said that, I would be perfectly willing to retract that
statement, and I will even give a formal apology on the speedcubing
group for having doubted you if you go to a competition and prove your
abilities.&quot;

Thing is, I have other priorities and a busy schedule.  I don&#x27;t want
to pay costs and I don&#x27;t want to waste time.  Furthermore, the day I
go to a competition is the day I get certain people in question to, on
camera, apologize to me and my family for the things said about my
deceased father.  What was said in earlier emails was absolutely out
of line.  The only fake thing I&#x27;ve seen so far was Tyson&#x27;s video where
he tried to &quot;lead me out.&quot; But you guys took a sensitive issue that
was causing problems for me at the time and tried to hammer me with it
for no reason, and to me that was completely unprofessional and
uncalled for.  There is no way I am going to take myself away from my
school and my studies and my friends and family to cube for these
people who say such awful things.  Plenty of people have seen me in
action in person and I don&#x27;t have any real desire to compete,
especially just because some people feel that they can dishonor my
father and expect me to inconvenience myself to prove my times to
skeptics.

I do hobbies for fun -- but I&#x27;m still not over what you guys said
about my father.  You don&#x27;t even know him or myself, and I felt it was
an incredibly rude and unforgivable act of disrespect.  So if you want
me to come to a competition and show that something like 1:15 is
possible given calm and focused conditions, some things are going to
need to happen first.  Until then, I don&#x27;t feel the need to put up
with this.</div>

          <div class="email-content">Well then, it would seem we&#x27;re at an impasse. I feel like there&#x27;s really only one thing we can 
do now. Marcus... we have to break up. We&#x27;ve had our troubles in the past and I&#x27;d hoped we 
could get over it, but I just feel like there&#x27;s no more trust in this relationship. You&#x27;re a 
memory master, but not only did you forget my birthday, you forgot your memory hooks. 
You never take me out to dinner or cube competitions. At times I feel like I hardly know you 
at all. Now I just feel like maybe it&#x27;s all just been a lie. I think we need to just take some time 
to ourselves.

But seriously, the only way anything here is going to be resolved is by Marcus competing. In 
my opinion, until that day comes he&#x27;s a non-issue for the community. If he refuses to do so, 
then there&#x27;s no point discussing the matter further. As long as avoiding scrutiny is as easy as 
&#x27;taking a break from cubing&#x27;, there&#x27;s no point in trying to find out if he&#x27;s for real or not.</div>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ll be the first to admit here -- I have been a complete ass in this 
situation.  This entire time, I haven&#x27;t given you any respect 
whatsoever.  Marcus, you will get my apology and more the day you show 
up to a competition and solve the cube in under 90 seconds blindfolded. 
  Otherwise, you have said too many things that simply don&#x27;t add up.

At first, I was willing to believe some of the circumstances and 
situations that were happening.  However, the coincidences kept 
occurring, and mathematically I didn&#x27;t believe that all these little 
things could happen so conveniently for someone.

No one achieves 90 second BLD times without serious practice.  I don&#x27;t 
care who you are, or what you claim you can do.  We&#x27;re all cubers, and 
we all know the same thing.  We have arrived where we are through hard 
work and dedication.  Talent is only a very minor part of the equation. 
  If I want to be sub-15 in speed solve, I have to have the will and 
desire to practice and solve.  This is something I have to want.  
Something I have to need.  Sub-15 isn&#x27;t something that comes to a 
person simply because they sat around and solved a few cubes.  Sub-90 
solves are the same way.

I have personally only met two other people other than myself who have 
solved a Rubik&#x27;s Cube blindfolded under 90 seconds.  I believe the 
three of us to be talented memory wise, and very knowledgeable.  
However, we poured our hearts and souls into this.

Genius aren&#x27;t born.  They&#x27;re made.  We&#x27;re all made.  We are made by 
desire, a fire, a passion deep and beautiful.  Something incredible, 
and from it, we channel our strength and our energy.  We create beauty 
through something plain - even physical.  We create art from nothing.  
Our minds are canvases, our personalities are the artists.  I have a 
burning desire to become something greater.  I want to prove to myself 
that I am better than this.  We all feel the same way... we are cubers. 
  And our hearts lie with our passions.  This is why we are good.  This 
is why people have achieved such incredible success in the recent 
years.  Talent will only take you so far.  Talent will get you a 
successful solve, perhaps.  Maybe one under three minutes.  Maybe even 
2:30... but no more.  The Rubik&#x27;s Cube is beautiful, because passion is 
the main driving force.  Not talent.

The Rubik&#x27;s Cube is a toy.  There are many speed solvers who are faster 
than me.  Are they more talented?  I don&#x27;t know.  But they certainly 
wanted it more than me.  And they reached out, dug in, and they worked 
for it.

This is perhaps the third time you&#x27;ve said you&#x27;re just going to step 
away from this community.  You say you don&#x27;t need this.  You don&#x27;t 
deserve to put up with all of this.  That&#x27;s fine.  I&#x27;ve been waiting.

I apologize to everyone else out there for my conduct and my behavior.  
These issues have been chewing away at me for quite some time now.  
Marcus, whatever you want to say or do, go ahead.  Be my guest.  
Whatever times you want to post, you go ahead and post them.  I will 
continue to provide feedback and advice to those who ask.  You can feel 
free to do the same.  I do not acknowledge your skills and abilities as 
legitimate.  I will no longer acknowledge your existence in this 
community.  I assure you, the top credible blindfold solvers... *every* 
top credible blindfold solver in this world feels the same way.  
They&#x27;re simply a step ahead of me, not acknowledging your existence.

I don&#x27;t know why you bother.  It&#x27;s just a game to you.  It&#x27;s just a 
toy.  But for me, the Rubik&#x27;s Cube has changed my life.  I cannot 
escape this.  I cannot deny this.  The Rubik&#x27;s Cube has become a part 
of me, and I will defend the integrity of what I do.  This is my 
passion, and my fire.

Take care, Marcus.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll actually meet you some day in another 
context.  And in whatever you do, I will give you the respect you 
deserve.  I hope you understand that my intention has never been 
malicious.  But everyone has the right to justify their existence in 
this world.  I retract every mean thing I&#x27;ve ever said about you, your 
situation, or your family.  You are right.  I do not understand you 
well enough, and you do not deserve ridicule in this fashion.

But you need to learn to respect who I am, and what I do, and the sweat 
and blood that has gone into a small plastic toy.  And until then, good 
bye.

-Tyson

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus, Tyson, everyone,

I would also like to say one more thing.  Marcus I read your post in
response to mine, and first off I&#x27;d like to say thank you for
providing a reply.  However, to be perfectly honest your post was for
the most part exactly what I expected to see.  You gave reasons to try
to show why you are legitimate, which I would expect anyone to do and
I perfectly agree with what you did.  But then you went out of your
way to show us that you are probably not going to be going to a
competition any time soon.

I&#x27;ve tried to be as open as I could with this, but like Tyson this
chews away at me as well.

That post, for me, seriously is the straw that broke the Camel&#x27;s back.

Marcus I also refuse to acknowledge your abilities as legitimate.  I
do not consider you a part of our community but more like a troll on
an internet forum.  I do not say this to be malicious or mean, but you
have tested my patience to it&#x27;s absolute breaking point and I cannot
and will not take this anymore.

I will not deride you or question you when you post times in the
future.  I simply will not acknowledge that they are even legitimate
or real.

If we do end up meeting at a cubing competition or in some other
context I will absolutely show you respect and dignity and will not be
mean or derisive.  In fact I would greatly *prefer* to meet you in
competition, find out you are for real, apologize, and hopefully we
can work together to bring down the limits of big cube BLD.  However I
am now totally convinced this is a fantasy and will never happen.

Until you do show up in competition and attempt a big cube BLD solve,
or attempt a 3x3x3 BLD solve, I refuse to believe you are an actual
member of the cubing community.  Right now I am completely convinced
you are nothing more than an internet troll in our community.

I imagine I&#x27;ll take some heat for this post, but again since we are in
the spirit of being honest, this is exactly where I stand.  Like Tyson
I also am very passionate about cubing.  I fairly regularly got bad
grades in high school and even on through in college on tests and
homeworks because I spent way too much time practicing for an upcoming
competition and less time on my homework.  I find even now I don&#x27;t
really care about my career or advancing into a high paying job, all I
care about is training myself to the absolute limit to prepare for the
Rubik&#x27;s World competition in Budapest this year.  Improving myself for
cubing is something I think about every day now.  I try to find better
ways to memorize or a better finger trick for an alg, etc..  I do
agree that the Rubik&#x27;s cube is only a toy, but it is a toy that has
changed my life and I am absolutely passionate about what I do in the
cubing community.

Marcus you&#x27;ve pushed me too far, and I refuse to take it anymore. 
Please do not consider me an ally or even a believer in your
abilities, because I no longer will take your posts seriously until
you stand up for them and make yourself accountable to your reputation
in an official competition.

Good bye,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Perhaps you will only understand where I am coming from when you
finally lose your parents.  And then after you lose them, I could
disrespect them, and yourself, and berate you for tarnishing their
image over something I know nothing about and is completely unrelated.
 And I&#x27;ll do this right during the point where you are grieving the
hardest, after you spent loads of time and effort post-loss trying to
maintain a stable family, home finances, and for me at least,
valedictorian status at high school, mental sanity and interpersonal
relationships.  Perhaps as someone who did not put such things as
priority in high school, you would not understand this if the cube is
the only thing you have the strongest passion for in life.  

If all of this sounds harsh or cruel, then perhaps you should have
thought of this before doing it to me over something as simple as a
multicolored toy.  The lack of empathy in this community is quite
astounding.  Put yourselves in my shoes for a moment, honestly.  Give
it a minute or two and think things through.  Do you understand why I
am not to willing to just come compete for you guys? Simply retracting
your statements is not enough -- you can&#x27;t say vicious things about my
dead father and just say &quot;Just kidding!&quot; and expect that to somehow
reset everything to a level playing field.  If you can show me that
you&#x27;re willing to retract and compensate for those statements, I will
gladly show up in competition and break the world records for the 3x3,
4x4, and 5x5 blindfolded, although I admit I&#x27;d be nervous and it would
take me a while to calm the nerves down to the point where I could do
this.  A simple apology on an obscure Yahoo group is not enough.  My
father was a great man and deserves more than that.  

Many here at Penn and back in my home state have seen me achieve my
times, and so by no means am I scared that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to back
up my claims.  It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m avoiding competition because I
wouldn&#x27;t be able to back my claims up -- it&#x27;s that you have all gone
about trying to get me to break away from a very busy life in a
completely rude fashion that I simply won&#x27;t tolerate.  You all speak
with this notion that you can simply ignore what you all said about my
family for the sake of justifying anger for me not wanting to compete.
 Use some common sense, here.

This is why you were booted off the show early, Tyson -- it isn&#x27;t
simply because you didn&#x27;t know who Gwen Stefani was or because your
partner &quot;somehow didn&#x27;t study enough.&quot;  It&#x27;s because you two didn&#x27;t
communicate properly.  The people who win on those shows, and in life,
are the ones who are able to communicate effectively.  Perhaps you
came from a family where you were brought up learning music and
developing certain skills, but I grew up acquiring my skills and
passions on my own.  I&#x27;ve been very independent growing up, and as a
result I&#x27;ve been blessed with the ability to do anything I put my mind
to, and anyone who knows me personally can tell you this.  There is
much about emotion, communication, and interpersonal understanding and
empathy you have yet to learn.  

Certainly, if I were to go into your shoes, and I put my blood and
tears into something in order to improve, I&#x27;d be upset if someone came
out of nowhere and somehow beat all my times while claiming that he
didn&#x27;t practice as much.  I&#x27;d be skeptical, and I&#x27;d demand proof, and
I&#x27;d be upset if he somehow avoided posting his method, or posting
videos, or competing.  But I wouldn&#x27;t bring your deceased relatives
into the mix right after tragedy struck your family and turned
everything upside down.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect you to come prove some
silly skill to me while you were trying to reorient years and years of
a life now altered.  But in spite of all this, I have posted my
methods for you.  I&#x27;ve answered questions. I have posted videos.  I
even did so after being accused of lying because I didn&#x27;t have
batteries for my camera.  I got the damn batteries, and I made the
damn videos for you.  But nobody thanked me for any of this, even
after I went out of my way to get a functional camera.  Nobody has
once shown empathy for my situation.  All you guys seem to care about
is your cube, at all costs.

So that&#x27;s where I stand.  If you want me to compete, you&#x27;re going to
have to prove that you can truly make this up to me.  And if you do, I
will gladly come.  You can&#x27;t expect to say malicious things about
something dear to me and expect me to continue to prove myself to you
on your terms.  You don&#x27;t have to believe me or my times, but at the
very least, you all owe me huge apologies.  I hope I&#x27;ve made myself
clear.  If there is something you still cannot understand, please
bring it to attention.

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

Could we please go back to blindfolded solving here again?
This is not a club for public fighting. And definitely not for personal attacks.

Anyone is innocent until proven guilty.
I would love to see Marcus solve blindfolded in real life.
Till then you can believe him or not, you can even talk about him in private, but please do not abuse this club for a war.

We should all be friends.

Have fun,

Ron

  Perhaps you will only understand where I am coming from when you
  finally lose your parents. And then after you lose them, I could
  disrespect them, and yourself, and berate you for tarnishing their
  image over something I know nothing about and is completely unrelated.
  And I&#x27;ll do this right during the point where you are grieving the
  hardest, after you spent loads of time and effort post-loss trying to
  maintain a stable family, home finances, and for me at least,
  valedictorian status at high school, mental sanity and interpersonal
  relationships. Perhaps as someone who did not put such things as
  priority in high school, you would not understand this if the cube is
  the only thing you have the strongest passion for in life. 

  If all of this sounds harsh or cruel, then perhaps you should have
  thought of this before doing it to me over something as simple as a
  multicolored toy. The lack of empathy in this community is quite
  astounding. Put yourselves in my shoes for a moment, honestly. Give
  it a minute or two and think things through. Do you understand why I
  am not to willing to just come compete for you guys? Simply retracting
  your statements is not enough -- you can&#x27;t say vicious things about my
  dead father and just say &quot;Just kidding!&quot; and expect that to somehow
  reset everything to a level playing field. If you can show me that
  you&#x27;re willing to retract and compensate for those statements, I will
  gladly show up in competition and break the world records for the 3x3,
  4x4, and 5x5 blindfolded, although I admit I&#x27;d be nervous and it would
  take me a while to calm the nerves down to the point where I could do
  this. A simple apology on an obscure Yahoo group is not enough. My
  father was a great man and deserves more than that. 

  Many here at Penn and back in my home state have seen me achieve my
  times, and so by no means am I scared that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to back
  up my claims. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m avoiding competition because I
  wouldn&#x27;t be able to back my claims up -- it&#x27;s that you have all gone
  about trying to get me to break away from a very busy life in a
  completely rude fashion that I simply won&#x27;t tolerate. You all speak
  with this notion that you can simply ignore what you all said about my
  family for the sake of justifying anger for me not wanting to compete.
  Use some common sense, here.

  This is why you were booted off the show early, Tyson -- it isn&#x27;t
  simply because you didn&#x27;t know who Gwen Stefani was or because your
  partner &quot;somehow didn&#x27;t study enough.&quot; It&#x27;s because you two didn&#x27;t
  communicate properly. The people who win on those shows, and in life,
  are the ones who are able to communicate effectively. Perhaps you
  came from a family where you were brought up learning music and
  developing certain skills, but I grew up acquiring my skills and
  passions on my own. I&#x27;ve been very independent growing up, and as a
  result I&#x27;ve been blessed with the ability to do anything I put my mind
  to, and anyone who knows me personally can tell you this. There is
  much about emotion, communication, and interpersonal understanding and
  empathy you have yet to learn. 

  Certainly, if I were to go into your shoes, and I put my blood and
  tears into something in order to improve, I&#x27;d be upset if someone came
  out of nowhere and somehow beat all my times while claiming that he
  didn&#x27;t practice as much. I&#x27;d be skeptical, and I&#x27;d demand proof, and
  I&#x27;d be upset if he somehow avoided posting his method, or posting
  videos, or competing. But I wouldn&#x27;t bring your deceased relatives
  into the mix right after tragedy struck your family and turned
  everything upside down. I wouldn&#x27;t expect you to come prove some
  silly skill to me while you were trying to reorient years and years of
  a life now altered. But in spite of all this, I have posted my
  methods for you. I&#x27;ve answered questions. I have posted videos. I
  even did so after being accused of lying because I didn&#x27;t have
  batteries for my camera. I got the damn batteries, and I made the
  damn videos for you. But nobody thanked me for any of this, even
  after I went out of my way to get a functional camera. Nobody has
  once shown empathy for my situation. All you guys seem to care about
  is your cube, at all costs.

  So that&#x27;s where I stand. If you want me to compete, you&#x27;re going to
  have to prove that you can truly make this up to me. And if you do, I
  will gladly come. You can&#x27;t expect to say malicious things about
  something dear to me and expect me to continue to prove myself to you
  on your terms. You don&#x27;t have to believe me or my times, but at the
  very least, you all owe me huge apologies. I hope I&#x27;ve made myself
  clear. If there is something you still cannot understand, please
  bring it to attention.

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

What do you think will be the limits for the memorization time for 
speed blindfolded?

Patrick Bellenbaum uses the speed blindfolded system for normal 
blindfolded solving. For Dutch Open 2005 he had 20 minutes for his 
attempt and he almost had it. I think he was only missing the PLL.

You could learn how all F2L algorithms effect the other pieces.
Geir Ugelstad knows the effect of all his OLL algorithms.

One strategy would be to do as few steps as possible, so that you 
have fewer recalculations to do.
Or you could do many small steps for which you know how pieces are 
moving. You could do each F2L pair in two steps (pair up, insert), 
same for OLL.

Or is speed blindfolded uninteresting?

Have fun,

Ron</div>

  Perhaps you will only understand where I am coming from when you
  finally lose your parents. And then after you lose them, I could
  disrespect them, and yourself, and berate you for tarnishing their
  image over something I know nothing about and is completely unrelated.
  And I&#x27;ll do this right during the point where you are grieving the
  hardest, after you spent loads of time and effort post-loss trying to
  maintain a stable family, home finances, and for me at least,
  valedictorian status at high school, mental sanity and interpersonal
  relationships. Perhaps as someone who did not put such things as
  priority in high school, you would not understand this if the cube is
  the only thing you have the strongest passion for in life. 

  If all of this sounds harsh or cruel, then perhaps you should have
  thought of this before doing it to me over something as simple as a
  multicolored toy. The lack of empathy in this community is quite
  astounding. Put yourselves in my shoes for a moment, honestly. Give
  it a minute or two and think things through. Do you understand why I
  am not to willing to just come compete for you guys? Simply retracting
  your statements is not enough -- you can&#x27;t say vicious things about my
  dead father and just say &quot;Just kidding!&quot; and expect that to somehow
  reset everything to a level playing field. If you can show me that
  you&#x27;re willing to retract and compensate for those statements, I will
  gladly show up in competition and break the world records for the 3x3,
  4x4, and 5x5 blindfolded, although I admit I&#x27;d be nervous and it would
  take me a while to calm the nerves down to the point where I could do
  this. A simple apology on an obscure Yahoo group is not enough. My
  father was a great man and deserves more than that. 

  Many here at Penn and back in my home state have seen me achieve my
  times, and so by no means am I scared that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to back
  up my claims. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m avoiding competition because I
  wouldn&#x27;t be able to back my claims up -- it&#x27;s that you have all gone
  about trying to get me to break away from a very busy life in a
  completely rude fashion that I simply won&#x27;t tolerate. You all speak
  with this notion that you can simply ignore what you all said about my
  family for the sake of justifying anger for me not wanting to compete.
  Use some common sense, here.

  This is why you were booted off the show early, Tyson -- it isn&#x27;t
  simply because you didn&#x27;t know who Gwen Stefani was or because your
  partner &quot;somehow didn&#x27;t study enough.&quot; It&#x27;s because you two didn&#x27;t
  communicate properly. The people who win on those shows, and in life,
  are the ones who are able to communicate effectively. Perhaps you
  came from a family where you were brought up learning music and
  developing certain skills, but I grew up acquiring my skills and
  passions on my own. I&#x27;ve been very independent growing up, and as a
  result I&#x27;ve been blessed with the ability to do anything I put my mind
  to, and anyone who knows me personally can tell you this. There is
  much about emotion, communication, and interpersonal understanding and
  empathy you have yet to learn. 

  Certainly, if I were to go into your shoes, and I put my blood and
  tears into something in order to improve, I&#x27;d be upset if someone came
  out of nowhere and somehow beat all my times while claiming that he
  didn&#x27;t practice as much. I&#x27;d be skeptical, and I&#x27;d demand proof, and
  I&#x27;d be upset if he somehow avoided posting his method, or posting
  videos, or competing. But I wouldn&#x27;t bring your deceased relatives
  into the mix right after tragedy struck your family and turned
  everything upside down. I wouldn&#x27;t expect you to come prove some
  silly skill to me while you were trying to reorient years and years of
  a life now altered. But in spite of all this, I have posted my
  methods for you. I&#x27;ve answered questions. I have posted videos. I
  even did so after being accused of lying because I didn&#x27;t have
  batteries for my camera. I got the damn batteries, and I made the
  damn videos for you. But nobody thanked me for any of this, even
  after I went out of my way to get a functional camera. Nobody has
  once shown empathy for my situation. All you guys seem to care about
  is your cube, at all costs.

  So that&#x27;s where I stand. If you want me to compete, you&#x27;re going to
  have to prove that you can truly make this up to me. And if you do, I
  will gladly come. You can&#x27;t expect to say malicious things about
  something dear to me and expect me to continue to prove myself to you
  on your terms. You don&#x27;t have to believe me or my times, but at the
  very least, you all owe me huge apologies. I hope I&#x27;ve made myself
  clear. If there is something you still cannot understand, please
  bring it to attention.

  But personally, speed blindfolded cubing is a rather interesting concept to me.  I&#x27;d much rather continue to work on 5x5 blindfolded though.  Big cube blindfolded is so much cooler :)
   
  Multiple Cubes, and speed blindfolded cubing are both unofficial.  So I will not compete until they are official, or enough of an interest arises in a local competition.

          Hi guys,

What do you think will be the limits for the memorization time for 
speed blindfolded?

Patrick Bellenbaum uses the speed blindfolded system for normal 
blindfolded solving. For Dutch Open 2005 he had 20 minutes for his 
attempt and he almost had it. I think he was only missing the PLL.

You could learn how all F2L algorithms effect the other pieces.
Geir Ugelstad knows the effect of all his OLL algorithms.

One strategy would be to do as few steps as possible, so that you 
have fewer recalculations to do.
Or you could do many small steps for which you know how pieces are 
moving. You could do each F2L pair in two steps (pair up, insert), 
same for OLL.

Or is speed blindfolded uninteresting?

Have fun,

Ron

I also really enjoy speed blindfolded, even though I&#x27;ve only ever done
it twice.  I don&#x27;t have an efficient method for memorization, but I do
think it is better to take way too long on memorization in order to
try for a faster solve (since the format of the category is to not
time memorization anyway).  I would say an expert at this event would
not worry about memorizing with any sort of speed at all, since that
part is unimportant.  Maybe an alternative event to make this official
would be a 1 hour maximum time limit on memorization, and at the end
of that time you are forced to solve or take a DNF.  I think such an
event would be more accessible to being an official event in
competition.  Everyone could start at the same time and the event
would only take 1 hour plus the time taken for everyone to attempt
their solve.

 So I will not compete until they are official, or enough of an
interest arises in a local competition.

I agree with Daniel here.  I find speed blindfolded and multiple
blindfolded very interesting, but since big cubes blindfolded is
official and the other two are not I prefer to focus my time on the
big cubes as well, same as Daniel.

Maybe an alternative format for the multiple blindfolded would be to
give a 10 minute time limit on memorization per cube, or something to
that effect.  I don&#x27;t know what a fair time would be, and I agree that
choosing a time at all is completely arbitrary, but it might make this
event possible as an official event rather than unofficial.

Maybe an alternative format for the multiple blindfolded would be to

You should check out the draft version of the WCA regulations 2007...

I also really enjoy speed blindfolded, even though I&#x27;ve only ever done
it twice. I don&#x27;t have an efficient method for memorization, but I do
think it is better to take way too long on memorization in order to
try for a faster solve (since the format of the category is to not
time memorization anyway). I would say an expert at this event would
not worry about memorizing with any sort of speed at all, since that
part is unimportant. Maybe an alternative event to make this official
would be a 1 hour maximum time limit on memorization, and at the end
of that time you are forced to solve or take a DNF. I think such an
event would be more accessible to being an official event in
competition. Everyone could start at the same time and the event
would only take 1 hour plus the time taken for everyone to attempt
their solve.

So I will not compete until they are official, or enough of an
interest arises in a local competition.

I agree with Daniel here. I find speed blindfolded and multiple
blindfolded very interesting, but since big cubes blindfolded is
official and the other two are not I prefer to focus my time on the
big cubes as well, same as Daniel.

Maybe an alternative format for the multiple blindfolded would be to
give a 10 minute time limit on memorization per cube, or something to
that effect. I don&#x27;t know what a fair time would be, and I agree that

          <strong>88. Treating the 3x3x3 as part of a 5x5x5</strong><br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

I just wanted to post, because I think I finally have found a way to
make some progress on the 3x3x3, and this is turning out to be a
method I like very much.

I now, for the most part, solve the 3x3x3 blindfolded exactly the same
way I would solve the central most edges and corners of a 5x5x5
blindfolded.

The differences are that I orient the edges on a 3x3x3 with typical
3x3x3 algs, rather than the cumbersome 5x5x5 algs [R&#x27; e&#x27; R2 e2 R&#x27;, U2]
is an example of one I use on the 5x5x5.  But I would still use
standard 3x3x3 algs here.

For orienting the corners I use the exact same algs on 3x3x3 now that
I always use on the 5x5x5.

So one example is that on the 3x3x3 I used to use a double sune
followed by a three cycle to orient 4 corners in one layer.

Here is an example: L&#x27; U2 L U L&#x27; U&#x27; L U L&#x27; U L2 U&#x27; L U L U L U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L2

But now I prefer to use the alg I would use on the 5x5x5 for this
case, which is: L U L&#x27; U L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R L U L&#x27; U
L U2 L&#x27;

I realize this move is 4 moves longer than the 3x3x3 cube way, but
again the 5x5x5 version is always the one that pops into my head
first, and if I see this case I first think of the 5x5x5 alg anyway.

Also I solve the corner permutation on the 3x3x3 now exactly the same
way I would on the 5x5x5, making liberal use of the commutator [B2, R
F R&#x27;] from any angle and on any side, which is mostly how I solve for
the 5x5x5 anyway.  I still use commutators like [(R&#x27; F R F&#x27;)x3, D2]
fairly often too.  Those are pretty much the only two algs I use on
5x5x5, and now also on 3x3x3.

The edge permutation is the biggest change.  I do occasionally still
use a standard 3x3x3 alg (something like R2 U F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U R2) but I
more often use algs like the ones I posted before, stuff like [M&#x27; U2
M, D], my freestyle commutator algs basically.

Also, I handle two swaps within the edges differently now.  Instead of
setting up all the pieces into the U layer to do either an H perm or a
Z perm, I now do them as 2 three cycles, exactly the same way I would
for the 5x5x5.

Here is an example.  I just had a 1:52.34 successful solve where I
ended up with the edge double swap (UB DB) (DL UF).  I used to do
something like L2 D&#x27; R2 then a left handed Z perm here.  But on this
solve I treated it just like on the 5x5x5 and I did

M U2 M&#x27; D&#x27; M U2 M&#x27; D U F&#x27; B L2 F B&#x27; U

This alg is sort of a half mix of my 5x5x5 approach by using two three
cycles with my use of the L2 U F&#x27; B L2 F B&#x27; U L2 alg which is standard
on 3x3x3.  Anyway so it&#x27;s not a perfect copy of what I do on the
5x5x5, but it&#x27;s for the most part the same thing.

I just find that from solving the 5x5x5 a lot it is weird to me to
change back to my 3x3x3 way when I do a 3x3x3.  So now I just prefer
to solve the 3x3x3 the same way with the exceptions mentioned above.

I don&#x27;t claim any crazy fast times, but I have been getting sub-2
regularly lately, which for me is quite good.

Anyway, I just wanted to post because clearly using freestyle
commutators on the 3x3x3 also works as a sub-2 method.  I know
sometimes people advocate having a certain set of algs you always use
and that you setup each case into one of those algs.  However I really
like using freestyle commutators instead, since I feel like I am more
comfortable with them.  It&#x27;s a different approach, but even still I
have a certain base of &quot;commutator types&quot; that I always use and I just
try to apply them to the cycle I have each time.

I just wanted to post, since I think this is a viable method.  My
record with it so far is a 1:31.26 and I have gotten sub-2 more often
with this method than with standard algs.

Just food for thought, in case anyone else also likes freestyle
commutators.  I think this makes an excellent solving method for the
3x3x3 as well.

          <div class="email-content">Alright this has definitely become my main solving method.

Here is a full example solve.  The overall time was 1:50.19 and again
for me that time is really quite good.

The cube state was:
edge orientation: UL, BR, DR, DB were flipped
corner orientation: DFR, DFL rotate counterclockwise.  UFR, UBL rotate
clockwise
corner permutation: (UBL->UBR->DFR->DFL->UFL) and (UFR->DBL->DBR)
edge permutation:
1) (UB->BL->FR->DR->DB)
2) (UL&lt;->UF)
3) (BR&lt;->UR)
4) (FL->DF->DL)

To solve edge orientation I did: D&#x27; B R2 F2 M&#x27; U M&#x27; U M&#x27; U M2 U&#x27; M&#x27; U&#x27;
M&#x27; U&#x27; M&#x27; F2 R2 B&#x27; D

To solve corner orientation I did: x D L&#x27; (L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R
U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U R L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27;) L D&#x27; x&#x27;

To solve corner permutation I did:
1) (UBL->UBR->DFR): B L B&#x27; R2 B L&#x27; B&#x27; R2
2) (UBL->DFL->UFL): D F2 L&#x27; B&#x27; L F2 L&#x27; B L D&#x27;
3) (UFR->DBL->DBR): B&#x27; L&#x27; B R2 B&#x27; L B R2

To solve edge permutation I did:
1) (UB->BL->FR): E2 F&#x27; U2 F E2 F&#x27; U2 F
2) (UB->DR->DB): D M U2 M&#x27; D&#x27; M U2 M&#x27;
3) (UL&lt;->UF) and (UR&lt;->BR): B L&#x27; B L B&#x27; F&#x27; L F&#x27; B L B&#x27; L&#x27; F2 U&#x27; B&#x27;
So this part was a standard 3x3x3 move, since the setup was so easy.
4) (FL->DF->DL): D R E R&#x27; D R E&#x27; R&#x27; D2

Counting in STM and also not counting the cancellation moves, since I
didn&#x27;t take them into account during the solve, I did 116 moves on
this solve.

I guess that seems about average when compared to the standard orient
first way, but I just wanted to post an example of what I am doing
differently.  The biggest changes are during EP it seems, and also
there are usually changes during CO and CP.  EO is pretty much exactly
the same as how I used to do it.

Just in case anyone is interested.  What do you guys average using
standard orient-first?  I really don&#x27;t know what I average with
standard orient-first, but I&#x27;d be curious to know from people who are
much faster than I am on average, because I must not be making the
best choices at each step during the solving phase using standard stuff.

I think I missed Marcus claiming it&#x27;s possible to memorise CP in one

I am currently learning a method for memorising CP, which has to do 
with the phonetic system. I used to use numbers for CP, but converting 
them to letters/sounds with the phonetic system often leads to nice 
short words. I often memorise the CP in 3 words that way (words like 
CoNe, LoVe, MuLe etc. 

Basically, this was inspired by Bernett:

Buried inside message #1870:  

&quot;When
you look at the whole cube, you&#x27;re essentially remembering: Three
letters for CO, one word for CP, one word or phrase for EO, and
roughly 5 words for EP&quot;

 If there&#x27;s a good way to do this, i&#x27;d be interested...

          <div class="email-content">I think it&#x27;s what JÂ¤el said...using letters(consonants) for each corner and joining them to form word(s)

Marcus said something about Major system...I believe that&#x27;s the system I described above...I&#x27;m thinking about using it, but not for the CP...it could help my EP memorising (I forget it a lot)

 Buried inside message #1870:  
 
 &quot;When
 you look at the whole cube, you&#x27;re essentially remembering: Three
 letters for CO, one word for CP, one word or phrase for EO, and
 roughly 5 words for EP&quot;
 
 If there&#x27;s a good way to do this, i&#x27;d be interested...

recognizing Orientation on different faces.

I want to know if you recognize the corner orientation on the L/R face 
w/ respect to the U/D face or w/ respect to the L/R face?  Like when 
you orient.  Will the U/D stickers always be on the U/D face after 
orienting.  Or if you look at the L/R for a nice patter, do you orient 
and permute from that reference point?</div>

Hmm.. I don&#x27;t quite understand whatthat last alg is all about :s. 
Maybe you mean something else.. Maybe more like:

[RU&#x27;R&#x27;U]x3  R&#x27;U2 RUR&#x27;UR  U2 R U2R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27; U2

I don&#x27;t get the last algorithm. Maybe you mean something like:

[RU&#x27;R&#x27;U]x3 R&#x27;U2 RUR&#x27;UR  U2   RU2R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27; U2

I tried this on the timer and got sub4 :p. Without picking up the 
cube, though, so I cheated.

It&#x27;s realy funny.. I was actually experimenting with this move just 
an hour before reading you post (honstely ;)). Only, I did:

[RUR&#x27;U&#x27;]x3 (U2 [R2&#x27;DR&#x27;U2RD&#x27;R&#x27;U2R&#x27;] U2)

An alternative for this case could be:

B2 D&#x27; x  M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2 U2 x&#x27; D B2


> [RU&#x27;R&#x27;U]x3 (U2 [R2&#x27;DR&#x27;U2RD&#x27;R&#x27;U2R&#x27;] U&#x27;)

Hmm.. I don&#x27;t quite understand whatthat last alg is all about :s. 
Maybe you mean something else.. Maybe more like:

[RU&#x27;R&#x27;U]x3  R&#x27;U2 RUR&#x27;UR  U2 R U2R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27; U2

Just 2 sunes to correct the CO there. It&#x27;s long, but it doesn&#x27;t 
require ugly setup moves. Besides, I can execute it in &lt;4 seconds :p.</div>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tyson + all other BLD cubers,

First, sorry for posting that many times... The problem with my 
browser seems to be solved right now, so I don&#x27;t expect this to 
happen again.

Second, yes Tyson, I can come up with something like this in BLD 
cubing now. I am really aware of what [RU&#x27;R&#x27;U]x3 does with the 
permutation and the orientation of the corners, and how to correct 
the orientation afterwards. It&#x27;s quite easy for me to visualise 
what&#x27;s happening to the pieces, and therefore easier (for me) than 
finding the setup moves. So I am sure that I could use this for 
swapping (URF URB) (ULF D??) in the future. I am also aware that 
execution time is not the most important, but I do usually prefer 2-
gen algs.

          <div class="email-content">Dear John Louis,

Maybe it&#x27;s weird to reply to an old post with a very short question, 
but this group seems to be deadish for a few day, so I thought 
posting doesn&#x27;t harm anyone.

When you posted this, I tried this, but then lost interest.
Recently, I found a good reason for learning this method though. I 
want to use Stefan&#x27;s M2 method, but I don&#x27;t want to keep track of 
where the centers are... So, if I use a PA method (not PAO), I could 
easily know where the centers are. If I have to do a step that 
involves a Person, the centers are solved. If I have to do a step 
with an action, the centers are swapped (U, D) (F, B). 

So, I am creating a list with 24 persons now... But actualy, it&#x27;s a 
lot more persons. For every sticker, I am associating it with 
a &#x27;category&#x27; of people. Like &#x27;actors&#x27;, &#x27;singers&#x27;. Then I can choose 
a differnt person every time I have to solve UL, I just think of a 
random actor. This way I won&#x27;t have to use the same persons every 
time, but I can use my imagination to come up with different ones 
every time. 

Would this be a usefull strategy, or is this only confusing?

Best wishes,

Joël.

          <div class="email-content">Joel, I think that&#x27;s a great Idea, having categories.
  I once tried categories, but stuck w/ visual memorization.  I use the letter pair image system for big cube bld (which is very painful to see the DNFs when they feel so right)
   
  My categories for for corners pieces, not stickers themselves, so I only had 8-10 categories and shaved it down to the 7 that worked best.  The U layer Corners were Dungeon and Dragon Classes (3 categories, a total of 9 images)  Warriors, Rogues, and Spell casters were the three categories.
   
  The DLx corners were classical games such as chess and cards.  
  The DRy corners were video game categories.
   
  Those were my seven categories.  However, you could actually take this concept of my general categories and expand them to 24 categories and their images.
   
  You could use a lot more video games, six wouldn&#x27;t seem out of line.  three classical games chess, cards, and risk/monopoly perhaps.  Perhaps a corner can have the topic of books, and then each sticker could be characters from a series.

That&#x27;s very clever!! I am still working on getting a list

I sure am. My execution of both is good, but I still suck at 
memorization and recall. I rarely practice real blindcubing but I do 
practice speedcubing using the blindcubing method maybe once or twice 
a day on average.

          <div class="email-content">Dear Joel, 
           Yeah, it is very old and I had lost track of it. As I am busy with my work, I could not go through it once again immediately and hence this belated reply. Kindly excuse me.
           If you use journey system(point no 7) to store what you memorise, then to have the same person is much easier to remember. And also, it will avoid any stopping between every cycle to think about the next person/step.
           Memorising a cube is not a junk of information. Memorising a 333 cube and 444 cubs is equal to just memorising 20 cards in a pack of cards and 56 cards(a pack + 4 cards) respectively.When a memoriser using the same person and action to memorise 20+ packs of cards without confusion and that too very fast, why not that be good enough to memorise just a cube.
           Different imagination every time is good, but it slows down your speed of thinking and solving. Predetermined same image makes your memorisation faster.With lots of practice you will realise, the mere picture of the person with a specific action make you to execute the correct algm without any delay!!!! Use journey system and test yourself first.
           I will never say any new method/strategy is confusing. Anything may be initially confusing, but if finetuned then it may be a wonderful method. Example, In 1980&#x27;s when Sarfraz Nawaz reverse swing the cricket ball when he bowled, the cricket experts called him a cheater. But, they concluded, it is a wonderful execution of principles of aerodynamics in 1990&#x27;s. Nowadays, it is used as a great weapon in cricket bowling.
   
          You know my limitation about cubing and hope what I have given here makes some sense. Kindly excuse me if it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to you.
   
  Best wishes,
  John Louis

Maybe it&#x27;s weird to reply to an old post with a very short question, 
but this group seems to be deadish for a few day, so I thought 
posting doesn&#x27;t harm anyone.

When you posted this, I tried this, but then lost interest.
Recently, I found a good reason for learning this method though. I 
want to use Stefan&#x27;s M2 method, but I don&#x27;t want to keep track of 
where the centers are... So, if I use a PA method (not PAO), I could 
easily know where the centers are. If I have to do a step that 
involves a Person, the centers are solved. If I have to do a step 
with an action, the centers are swapped (U, D) (F, B). 

So, I am creating a list with 24 persons now... But actualy, it&#x27;s a 
lot more persons. For every sticker, I am associating it with 
a &#x27;category&#x27; of people. Like &#x27;actors&#x27;, &#x27;singers&#x27;. Then I can choose 
a differnt person every time I have to solve UL, I just think of a 
random actor. This way I won&#x27;t have to use the same persons every 
time, but I can use my imagination to come up with different ones 
every time. 

Would this be a usefull strategy, or is this only confusing?

Best wishes,

JoÂ¤l.

> 6). In your memorisation, you are memorising continuously 
and after every cycle (ABC) you have to adjust your thinking for the 
next cycle(ADE), (AFG)etc. Every time you have to break your chain 
in the story you framed already. It restricts your flow of 
solving.You must have experienced it, haven&#x27;t you ? Here is my 
suggestion. Instead of memorising all the centers contnuously in 2 
cycles, you can memorise them in 12 cycles(considering all the 24 
pieces are to be solved).
> Example :- cycle-1:- 2,8,9,13,4,6,17,24,12,23,11,10,21

> Memorise cycle-2 as:-
> (3,7,5),(3,5,1),(3,19,16),(3,13,18),(3,14,15),(3,20,22).
> 7).Storing(fixing) the picture in your brain:- This is the 
part I think all the blind solvers are not using except bernett and 
Stefan(hahaha....and of course me?!?). This helps you to avoid 
checking(revising) your memorisation after memorising it once. This 
is called journey method. For memorising 12 cycles, maximum you need 
is 12 locations. 
> Example:- you select your house. Think of the order in which 
things are placed in your house. Say, 1).entrance door 2).Sofa 3).TV 
4).Computer 5). Study table 6).dining table etc. Mentally rerun the 
locations in your mind again and again until it is very familiar to 
you.

the second location of your house-SOFA.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

I&#x27;ve been working on the probability of certain cases for 4x4x4 and
5x5x5 BLD wing edges and ended up with some general formulas that help
for the 3x3x3 too.

3x3x3 formulas:
---------------
The probability of getting exactly n 2-cycles in the edge permutation
during your 3x3x3 BLD attempt.

1/(2^n*n!)*sumation(i=0 to i=6-n, (-1)^i/(2^i*i!))

The probability of getting k 2-cycles in the corner permutation during
your 3x3x3 BLD attempt.

1/(2^k*k!)*sumation(i=0 to i=4-k, (-1)^i/(2^i*i!))

Some interesting probabilities from these formulas:

1) The probability of no 2-cycles in either the corner or edge
permutation is 36.8%
1a) The probability of at least one 2-cycle in either the edge or
corner permutation combined is 63.2% (That&#x27;s a very good chance!)

2) The probability of at least one two cycle in both of the corner and
edge permutations is 15.5%

Those are some interesting stats you have there! Thanks for sharing

          <div class="email-content">Chris, have you ever thought about using PLL to solve 2-cycles on the edges?
   
  I&#x27;m use 2-cycles to solve my algs.  But let&#x27;s just say, we need to swap the DF and FL
  M2L&#x27;y&#x27;(L U2&#x27;) (L&#x27; U2&#x27;) (L F&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L U) (L F L2&#x27; U)yLM2.  I think it&#x27;d be a lot easier for a cubist that orientates edges.  I find myself coming upon cycles that the edge in the UF goes to the DF but the DF goes to the FU.  This is a disoriented cycle and ... I came upon a case recently where I had four 2-cycles and two of them were disoriented 2-cycles.  Disoriented cycles aren&#x27;t a big deal, the worst case is starting w/ the UL, then ending on LU, but now that I found out how much I like the Flipped T perm, it matters not.

  5x5x5 blindfolded&#x27;s going well enough ... haha

          Hey everyone,

I&#x27;ve been working on the probability of certain cases for 4x4x4 and
5x5x5 BLD wing edges and ended up with some general formulas that help
for the 3x3x3 too.

3x3x3 formulas:
---------------
The probability of getting exactly n 2-cycles in the edge permutation
during your 3x3x3 BLD attempt.

1/(2^n*n!)*sumation(i=0 to i=6-n, (-1)^i/(2^i*i!))

The probability of getting k 2-cycles in the corner permutation during
your 3x3x3 BLD attempt.

1/(2^k*k!)*sumation(i=0 to i=4-k, (-1)^i/(2^i*i!))

Some interesting probabilities from these formulas:

1) The probability of no 2-cycles in either the corner or edge
permutation is 36.8%
1a) The probability of at least one 2-cycle in either the edge or
corner permutation combined is 63.2% (That&#x27;s a very good chance!)

2) The probability of at least one two cycle in both of the corner and
edge permutations is 15.5%

          <div class="email-content">Hey Daniel,

Yeah I&#x27;m working on a freestyle commutator approach to solving the
permutation and orientation at the same time for the edges of a 3x3x3.
 I&#x27;ll obviously use this on the 5x5x5 for the central edges too if I
ever switch over to this method.

I&#x27;m not ready to use it yet, but I wanted to start looking at the odds
of two cycles to see how often they come up so I can get a good idea
of how best to memorize them.  I haven&#x27;t yet looked into the odds of
two cycles with one flipped edge, like what you described, but that is
where I am going next.

For two 2-cycles where each has one incorrectly oriented piece I&#x27;ve
been using two commutator three cycles to solve that.

An example:
1) UF->DF->FU
2) UL->DL->LU

First do the cycle (UF->DF->UL) with U&#x27; M D2 M&#x27; U M D2 M&#x27; then finish
with (UF->DL->LU) with D F2 D&#x27; S&#x27; D F2 D&#x27; S

So the whole alg to solve that case is U&#x27; M D2 M&#x27; U M D2 M&#x27; D F2 D&#x27; S&#x27;
D F2 D&#x27; S

Seeing which cycle to do for each case is not that hard for me, but I
don&#x27;t know how best to memorize like this.  I&#x27;ve been working on
giving each sticker for the edges and corners a letter, and using my
same old journeys and images.  It&#x27;s taking some getting used to
though, and I&#x27;m not sure if it will be faster than my current way to
memorize because of the abstractness of encoding the images.  Still
it&#x27;s a new idea to try to see what happens.

As for the 5x5x5 keep it up man!  That cube is crazy fun, and let me
know how it&#x27;s going!

          <div class="email-content">I can directly solve central edges freestyle-ish on the 5x5.  I&#x27;m definitely going to try and freestyle the central edges on blindfolded solves.  
  Hardwick, learn to directly solve edges!  Consider this, memorization will be odd, but no matter what if you stick w/ an indirect solving method (that is orienting pieces), you will use more commutators, and take more time.  Memorization deficiencies can become neglible in comparison to the time consumed using commutators to orientate the edges and corners.  I truly have no problem memorizing directly, there&#x27;s no reason you can&#x27;t learn them either!  
  A bunch of small-cycles are very hard mind you.  &lt;-- this is I all have to say on the subject haha
   
  I&#x27;m going all out on memo/execution for the 3x3 now.  It&#x27;s working well ... I DNFd a sub 2m solve, I forgot to permute one edge :(
  In the online competition I&#x27;m DNFing a lot ... but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m wreckless, but we know that it&#x27;ll pay off in the end.
   
  Hardwick, how did you memorize before images??  Perhaps memo like such for central edges.  If sub 2 is possible w/ 2-cycles, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible w/ commutators.  Truly you are memorizing a lot less IMHO.
  I&#x27;m going to try Roman Rooms.  I think it&#x27;ll become very intricately related to my current method.  I associate pieces w/ numbers.  Why not transcend to images w/ rooms?!
   
  My visual memo system is great, I use it for corners and central edges on the 5x5 even.  I&#x27;m surprised ... I&#x27;m thinking back to when I was first trying to memorize the cube blindfolded.  I decided to finally just count my way around the cube.  a location doesn&#x27;t have a number, 
  I don&#x27;t memorize (15279), I count sequentially, and just tap the pieces needed.  And I recall these tap around the cube.  If I start a new cycle, I say skip, if I a piece is disoriented, I tape the Oriented sticker and say xo  where x is a number 1-11.  I look for patterns, they are very easy to see on the corners.
   
  My fastest of successful 3x3 blindfolded solves are now sub 2:20, been busy practicing, but busy w/ life too.  Good luck, directly solving will pay off soooo much!  This is all w/ nothing special or lucky either.  I&#x27;ve a method I really want to learn for the 3x3, it&#x27;ll be so fast, I really think so.  I think this method could easily shave 10+ seconds off my fast times.
   
  Later,
  Daniel Beyer
   
  5x5 solves are taking me about 50 minutes and DNFs are about stupid mistakes.  Can&#x27;t wait to talk bld w/ you, my cousin and his girlfriend will accompany me to Georgia XD sweet.

          <div class="email-content">Hello,
  Here is how I memorize, slightly different from your methods.
   
  I look at my buffer, and tap the location that will permute the piece.  I say as I tap that piece.  Then I tap the next location that will permute the next piece.  Yes, this is a 2-cycle method, just as Pochmann uses.
   
  When I start a new cycle, I tap the location I want to start from and say skip.  Then when I permute the piece that was in the location I started the new cycle from I&#x27;ll simply continue consecutively with respect to the last number used in the previous cycle.
   
  1,2,3,skip,4,5,6,7
   
  If there is a piece that is permuted however disoriented, I&#x27;ll tap that piece  and say xO, where X is the number.  
   
  My locations aren&#x27;t static.  I don&#x27;t have the UF as 2, and UB as 3.  And create a seqence of numbers like (2,4,8,7,9,11)
   
  I always count 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11
   
  if less pieces need to be permuted so be it.  If I break by adding a skip, so be it.  If I have to orient a piece, I continue to count I just add the long O sound to the end of the number.
   
  The formula that I use to derive if there is a parity.
  Last number used
  + Number of Skips 
  - Disoriented Pieces
   
  All I&#x27;m worried about:  odd or even?  odd = parity, even = no parity.
   
  The memo is very versatile, and good enough to sub 3 with, using a decent execution method.

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

You could have just used my contact form to ask me. ;)

The way you memorize, it looks like you memorise about twice as much 
information than needed. You are making it more complex. It&#x27;s a bit 
like memorizing both orientation and permutation and solving them at 
once, while really, you only need to memorize the permutation of the 
stickers.

There are 24 stickers, and 26 letters in the alfabet. This means you 
have enough letters to label all the pieces A-W. (Or skip Q and use 
Y too or whatever you like).

For me UL is labelled A, en LU is labelled U.

So when sticker A is in buffer position, I know I have to shoot to 
UL (and sticker U and A are BOTH solved after that). When sticker U 
is in buffer position, I know I have to shoot to LU (and sticker U 
and A are BOTH solved after that). 

This way, for a 12 cycle of stickers, you will have to memorize 11 
letters. With your method, you would have to memorise 11 positions 
and 11 colors, which seems to be a lot harder to me.

Great to hear you are using my page, btw. Let me know what you think 
about it, so I can make the right adjustments to make it more 
beginner friendly..

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

After 2-3 weeks of intermitted learning/practice, I finally managed  
to solve the 3x3 blindfolded. And it really feels great.
I learnt using the .doc from Tyson. I still mess up quite a lot  
during execution (the main problem is that usually don&#x27;t know where I  
mess up... maybe I should get a camcorder to try to identify my  
mistakes), but I sometimes have a successful solve, which is great.

Anyway, my main issue right now is that I&#x27;m freaking slow. around  
10-15min. This is very frustrating and I would like to get any tips  
about how I could improve this time.

Both my memorization time and my execution time are slow. So any tips  
would do it.
For the memorization I tried with numbers, but didn&#x27;t work very well  
with me. So I&#x27;m currently just memorizing the path, which has a major  
disadvantage, IMHO, because I need to visualize the path, and it&#x27;s  
hard to do it while looking at the cubies (because I have to move/ 
rotate the cube to find the colors of the next one, which is messing  
up my brain which tries to visualize the path..). So I&#x27;m losing a lot  
of time looking at the next cubie and then recalling the path from  
the beginning with the cube in the standard position. Maybe I should  
try not to use the cube to visualize the path and do it only in my  
head. I don&#x27;t know, you tell me :)

For the execution, I sometimes have difficulties with setup moves,  
especially for edges. And I&#x27;m always afraid of not remembering it if  
I just do it intuitively. So I have a tendency to double check,  
triple check every move I&#x27;m doing, which is of course quite slow.  
Also I seem to have a hard time recognizing if the rotation is  
clockwise or counter clockwise. this is really strange because if I  
just do the solve mentally, without really executing it, it is fine,  
I perfectly see what I have to do. But for some reason, when I&#x27;m  
actually doing it, my brain seems to freeze ;) Anyone had the same  
experience?

I really would like to at least get sub-5min, and possibly sub-3min.
So if anyone recognizes some of the same early difficulties than  
mine, please let me know how you solved them.
Or any general tips to improve time would do it too.

Thanks,
Quôc</div>

          <div class="email-content">Hello everybody,

I have been working on changing my memorization method to a different 
one, with Persons and Actions, and store &#x27;mini-stories&#x27; in locations 
of a journey.

This morning, I did 2 cubes blindfolded, and I must say, memorising 
this way makes it easy to recall, and I think it&#x27;s very useful for 
doing maybe more cubes or larger cubes.

Anyway... The only problem I still have is that it takes me a loong 
time to convert the pieces into mini-stories and store them in a 
location. 

Chris, did you have the same thing when you started using all your 
images and a journey method? Can you help me out?

          <div class="email-content">The key is knowing the images that you use.
  Through practice (and coming up w/ a  decent schematic for your images) you can quickly recognize what locations you have to memorize.
   
  For letters pairs, this is sort of crucial.  You need to recognize two locations as letters (this is what will come fast over time) ... then you need to encode it (practice your letter pairs, learn them really well!)  Encoding can only come fast by practice.  You need to study your PA system.  I don&#x27;t know if having individual images takes the same precedence.  But I&#x27;m sure that since you alternate between persons and actions, you need to be able to flow freely, cycling back and forth between the two.  For you I&#x27;d assume that you progess over time to recognize a location as one of two possibilities, the action or the person.  The key is being able to flow quickly, and not think if you are making a person or an action.
   
  For memorizing (solving&#x27;s been attrocious ...)  I&#x27;ve come to know my lettering scheme.  However, memo could be a lot faster if I looked over the unfamiliar letter pairs.  Not knowing the image can become very distracting, and cause you to almost forget the images that you memorized because you&#x27;re focusing on this image that you&#x27;re not sure of.  The T-centers that I knew a moment before, is sort of lost in the chaos of not being able to recall a letter pair for the wings.
   
  Find a balance of making vague images and vivid images.  Vague images need to be reviewed frequently, vivid images stick longer ... repetition on vague images is time consuming, as is making images really vivid.  This is where you need to find a balance.

          <div class="email-content">Joel,
   
   The tutorial was great, I got everything fast, but I was just 
wondering, is this method fast, or how fast can this get (time wise, 
is it possible to get in the 2-3 min range)? I am asking because it 
seems that all of the fast blind cubers are usiing the 3 cycle 
method. Also is the method explained in the tutorial the same method 
you use?
   Also to help you wth your tut. I would explain in the begining, 
how set-ups work. Cause at first I didn&#x27;t understand what you ment 
when you were comparing the d2 L&#x27; and d L, I understood that they 
have diferent orientations when done but didn&#x27;t get how, I sorta had 
to figure it out, but that is it. I personaly would not compare them, 
but tell in deatail how you would solve a peice. But mabey it was 
just me that didn&#x27;t get it at first.

Btw - i converted to the Person,Action,Object method and it really 
helps, but i havn&#x27;t yet solved a cube blind  :(  I just can&#x27;t keep it 
all in my head, it&#x27;s either the edges or the corners, or somtihng 
goes wrong during the exicution, usually the set-up if any thing, but 
somthing alwasys goes wrong. And I am thinking of trying out the 3 
cycle.</div>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,  

Thanks for your reply.

I think this method definately allows sub3 times. I did 2:20 with a 
modified version of this.

I also think the basic idea of not orienting first is very 
promissing, and this method is a good &#x27;non-orient-first&#x27; method to 
start with. If you fully understand how solving the pieces without 
orienting works, you can move on to a method where you solve mostly 
in three cycles (like the explanations on the bottom of the page).</div>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

I&#x27;m using the cycle method for a long time, splitting the resolution
in 4 (OC, OE, PC, PE). My best time is 2:17 (done twice), but I can
still be faster for the memorisation.

Anyway, it&#x27;s not the point here, because I&#x27;m trying to speed up my
resolution. For now, it takes between 1 min and 1:30 for me to solve it.

One way to improve the resolution is to merge 2 parts, that is to say
I could :

- Solve OC and PC at the same time, by doing appropriates 3-cycles,
- Solve OE and PE at the same time (same as corners),
- Solve OC and OE at the same time by learning new algs;

All this seems to be a little painful for my mind, what is your advice ?

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,

I apologize if these algorithms are already well-known, but I 
discovered them recently.

(r U r&#x27; U&#x27;)*3 does a 6-flip as well as the normal (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)*3 thing.  
So, if you add an (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)*3 to that, you get a 6-flip (UL UB UR UF 
FR FD).  Similarly, if you do (R u R&#x27; u&#x27;)*3 then (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)*3, you get 
a 6-flip (RD RF RU RB UB LB).

Finally, if you do (r U r&#x27; U&#x27;)*3 (R u R&#x27; u&#x27;)*3, you get another 6-flip 
(UF UL BL BR DR DF).  If you then do the rotation z and repeat that, 
you get a superflip.

I don&#x27;t know if everyone knows this or if it will be at all useful or 
fast (I find r U r&#x27; U&#x27; and such slightly clunky), but other people may 
like them.

Hi Joel,

I have the same problem and I try to fight it by beta-blindcubing. I 
say:

alpha: Just speedsolving using a blindsolving method.

beta: Convert pieces to mini-stories, but don&#x27;t store them yet, i.e., 
after you have the story, just execute it and go on. Still not 
blindfolded.

full: The regular blindcubing.

Full blindcubing is still exhausting for me, but I can do many beta-
solves in a row without problems, I recently did about 150 in about 
four days. I think it helps me for regular solving. It&#x27;s like 
practicing to recognize letters before trying to read books. My 
averages for alpha/beta/full are now about 0:50/1:15/3:30 I think, 
and I hope to eventually get them all very close together.

Cheers!

          I am happy that at last you are giving it a try. Instead of PA method , if you use PAO method, It will be good for 3 cycle and also memorisation will be faster with practice. Though not now, you might realise it later.
   
  All the very best and plz share your experience. bernett is fine and doing well.

  Pure 2-cycles are really fast.  Commutator 3-cycles (direct solving) can be really fast!  A lot of blindfold cubist orient and do 3-cycles and are insanely fast!  Take your pick at the assortment of methods, create your own even (as I did for corners) ... remember to step your game up on memo if execution isn&#x27;t your strong point!

          Hi, 

Thanks for your reply.

I think this method definately allows sub3 times. I did 2:20 with a 
modified version of this.

I also think the basic idea of not orienting first is very 
promissing, and this method is a good &#x27;non-orient-first&#x27; method to 
start with. If you fully understand how solving the pieces without 
orienting works, you can move on to a method where you solve mostly 
in three cycles (like the explanations on the bottom of the page).</div>

Stefan&#x27;s, very much like the T-permutation method, but more

very fast with it yet, but I&#x27;ll try to practice it more..

          <div class="email-content">Wow, my thought is &quot;Look into merging EO and CO!  That would be killer!&quot;
   
  That&#x27;s an insane ammount to take on though I think, because of the huge number of cases.
  You could do a 3 look break down ... perhaps  L layer, R layer, and finish the M slice and unbalanced edges/corners in the third look.  
   
  I can solve corners in about 25s w/ 2-cycles, that is 8-10 algs to solve them.  Edges I think can be solved w/ 2-gen very nicely
   
  http://dbeyer.110mb.com/printables.html :)
  Take a look at my alg list and see the list at the bottom for the 2-gen cases, do a Pochmann setup on the first edge in the cycle, then do an aribtrary d turn to get the third piece of the cycle into one of the 4 targets.

          Hi everyone,

I&#x27;m using the cycle method for a long time, splitting the resolution
in 4 (OC, OE, PC, PE). My best time is 2:17 (done twice), but I can
still be faster for the memorisation.

Anyway, it&#x27;s not the point here, because I&#x27;m trying to speed up my
resolution. For now, it takes between 1 min and 1:30 for me to solve it.

One way to improve the resolution is to merge 2 parts, that is to say
I could :

- Solve OC and PC at the same time, by doing appropriates 3-cycles,
- Solve OE and PE at the same time (same as corners),
- Solve OC and OE at the same time by learning new algs;

All this seems to be a little painful for my mind, what is your advice ?

I think memorising 3 pieces at the time would not be very usefull 
for 3 cycles. For 3 cycles, I would prefer memorising in pairs. 

Especially for the method I am using now (M2 method), I really think 
memorising in pairs is better.

          <div class="email-content">Hello people!!

I am really really excited right now! I have been practicing a few 
BLD solves today, and broke my record 2 times! (2:18 and 2:15). I 
switched a bit between my old system and my new system (for both 
memorizing and solving). Here are my experiences:

With my old system, I am still quite fast. I did both of my records 
with my old system. However, if I start doing more cubes, I get 
tired, and dont remember everything really well.

With the new PA system (person action, in combination with a 
jourhey), I am able to do more and more solves, still keeping the 
accuracy pretty high. I also tried making the images in my head 
more &#x27;vague&#x27; than I did before, so the memorisation process is 
faster. I tried three of those solves, and the times were getting 
better with every attempt... I now got down to about 2:30 for 
memorizing with the Person Action system :D. I am really going to 
practice this more, so I can translate the pieces into images 
faster! :D.

Would someone, or more than one, please demonstrate how you&#x27;d memorize 
the edges using person-action, or person-action-object for solving 3-

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

Ok.. I&#x27;ll demonstrate this using my new PA method. I will not start 
at UF. It doesn&#x27;t matter where I start. The method can be used 
whether you start at UF, UR or FD, it doesn&#x27;t matter, so I don&#x27;t see 
why I should start at UF. I do orientation and permutation in one 
go, btw, using Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s M2 Method. The UF/FU and DB/BD 
targets are always solve relative to the M centers.

I use a journey method, and I think we will use the first 5 or 6 
locations. The complete journey is from my place to the train 
station. I know these places very well, this is important.

1: Parking lot behind my appartment
2: 1st crossing
3: 2nd crossing
4: Train crossing
5: 3rd crossing
6: Flower shop

I start at FD. This piece has to go to FU, so that&#x27;s my ex-GF. Then, 
the first cycle is solved, so I have to break into another cycle. I 
have reasons to choose BR, it&#x27;s convenient with the M2 method I use. 
So BR corresponds to vomitting.

Then, the nex target is BU: current GF :D. I see her vomitting (BR) 
as well (that happens when I get 2 cycles like this.

Then I have to break into another cycle. Let&#x27;s try RF: The Dutch 
Queen. Has to go to UL: Kissing. Who is she kissing with... Hmm, the 
only thing I can think of is her late husband.

The next target would be LD; one of my housemates (I pick one). 
Let&#x27;s pick Jolanda. She&#x27;s at the train crossing. She&#x27;s driving a car 
(LF). She&#x27;s in the car waiting for a passing train, I guess.

The next target is FR: Soccer player. Let&#x27;s go for Edwin van der 
Sar. Break into another cycle: He&#x27;s destroying (RU) some windows at 
the other crossing.

Then I see Matt Walter at the flower shop (BL). He&#x27;s experimenting 
(DR) with the flowers. He might be smelling them, investigating them 
etc.

Then I see a collegue of mine (RU) (end of cycle). I still have to 
flip the BD edge. So this colegue of mine is flying (BD) a 
helicopter at the next crossing.

I see Dave Campbell (DB) at the liquer store, making a very 
important gesture...: Dont forget to fix partiy, is what he is 
telling me. He doesn&#x27;t have an action really, which means that I 
have parity. 

To sumarize:

1: I see my ex GF (FU) vomitting (BR) on the parking lot.
2: I see my GF (BU) vomitting (BR) on the 1st crossing.
3: I see the Dutch Queen (RF) kissing (UL) with her late husband 
(ieuw!) on the 2nd crossing.
4: Jolanda (LD) is waiting in her car (LF) for a train to cross at 
the train crossing.
5: Edwin van der Sar (FR) is destroying (RU) windows at the 3rd 
crossing.
6: Matt Walter (BL) inverstigating (DR) flowers at the flower shop. 
7: Collegue (RU) flying (BD) at the next crossing.
8: Dave Campbell (DB) telling me not to forget parity at the liquer 
store.

Solution:

(Solve corners and leave ULB and URB swapped)

[shoot to FU] U2 M&#x27; U2 M&#x27;
[shoot to BR] x&#x27; RU&#x27;R&#x27;U M2 U&#x27;RUR&#x27;
[shoot to BU] M2
[shoot to BR] x&#x27; RU&#x27;R&#x27;U M2 U&#x27;RUR&#x27;
[shoot to RF] URU&#x27; M2 UR&#x27;U&#x27; 
[shoot to UL] x&#x27; UL&#x27;U&#x27; M2 UL&#x27;U&#x27; x 
[shoot to LD] U&#x27;L2U M2 U&#x27;L2U 
[shoot to LF] U&#x27;L&#x27;U M2 U&#x27;LU 
[shoot to FR] x&#x27; U&#x27;R2U M2 U&#x27;R2U x 
[shoot to RU] R&#x27;URU&#x27; M2 UR&#x27;U&#x27;R 
[shoot to BL] x&#x27; L&#x27;U&#x27;LU M2 U&#x27;L&#x27;UL x 
[shoot to DR] x&#x27; U&#x27;R&#x27;U M2 U&#x27;R&#x27;U x 
[shoot to RU] R&#x27;URU&#x27; M2 UR&#x27;U&#x27;R 
[shoot to BD] U2 M&#x27; U2 M&#x27;
[shoot to DB] r2 R2&#x27; D R&#x27;U R&#x27;U&#x27; r R&#x27;URU&#x27; r&#x27; R2 D&#x27; 
[Fix parity] M2 z2 y R&#x27;UR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FR2U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; RUR&#x27; F&#x27; R2

Hope this helps!

  I just went with it ... all the work on 5x5x5 bld allowed me to see the commutators almost in the way I see them on the centers ... which is cool that I was able to do that!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Daniel Beyer,

I expected to get questions about this. How the M slice edges are 
handled is a bit strange. Basically, I have an algorithm to &#x27;shoot 
to FU&#x27;. Every time I have to shoot to FU, I can use that algorithm. 
However, when the centers are not solved, I have to shoot the same 
FU piece to the BD position, because that is where the centers are, 
and the M slice edges are solved relative to the centers. So.. For 
the L and R edges, it&#x27;s pretty easy. Don&#x27;t pay attention to the 
letters. I use those for memo.

Edge  	Name  	Algorithm  	
LU 	U 	LU&#x27;L&#x27;U M2 U&#x27;LUL&#x27; 	 
LF 	J 	U&#x27;L&#x27;U M2 U&#x27;LU 	 
LD 	H 	U&#x27;L2U M2 U&#x27;L2U 	 
LB 	R 	U&#x27;LU M2 U&#x27;L&#x27;U 	 
UL 	A 	x&#x27; UL&#x27;U&#x27; M2 UL&#x27;U&#x27; x 	 
FL 	L 	x&#x27; UL2U&#x27; M2 UL2U&#x27; x 	 
DL 	S 	x&#x27; ULU&#x27; M2 UL&#x27;U&#x27; x 	 
BL 	W 	x&#x27; L&#x27;U&#x27;LU M2 U&#x27;L&#x27;UL x 	 
RU 	T 	R&#x27;URU&#x27; M2 UR&#x27;U&#x27;R 	 
RF 	K 	URU&#x27; M2 UR&#x27;U&#x27; 	 
RD 	B 	UR2U&#x27; M2 UR2U&#x27; 	 
RB 	P 	UR&#x27;U&#x27; M2 URU&#x27; 	 
UR 	N 	x&#x27; U&#x27;RU M2 U&#x27;R&#x27;U x 	 
FR 	E 	x&#x27; U&#x27;R2U M2 U&#x27;R2U x 	 
DR 	D 	x&#x27; U&#x27;R&#x27;U M2 U&#x27;R&#x27;U x 	 
BR 	V 	x&#x27; RU&#x27;R&#x27;U M2 U&#x27;RUR&#x27;

The special cases are:
UB 	G 	UR&#x27;U&#x27; r&#x27; U&#x27; R2 U M2 U&#x27; R2 U r U R U&#x27; 	 
BU 	M 	M2


And when the centers are correct:
BD  	F  	M U2 M U2  	
FU 	Z 	U2 M&#x27; U2 M&#x27; 	
DB 	X 	r2 R2&#x27; D R&#x27;U R&#x27;U&#x27; r R&#x27;URU&#x27; r&#x27; R2 D&#x27; 	
UF 	C 	F E RUR&#x27; E&#x27; RU&#x27;R&#x27; F&#x27; M2

When the centers are NOT correct:
BD  	F  	U2 M&#x27; U2 M&#x27;
FU 	Z 	M U2 M U2
DB 	X 	F E RUR&#x27; E&#x27; RU&#x27;R&#x27; F&#x27; M2
UF 	C 	r2 R2&#x27; D R&#x27;U R&#x27;U&#x27; r R&#x27;URU&#x27; r&#x27; R2 D&#x27;


When the centers are solved, and I shoot to the FU edge, you&#x27;ll see 
that the edge will end up betwee the correct centers, but the 
centers will end up at the bottom and back (D and B). This is 
because every step has to move around those centers. Also, notice 
how with every step (exept shootin to BU or UB), the UB edge will 
stay in place. Just study these moves youself, until you get the 
idea ;).

I would like to learn all the F2L algos. Looking in internet I&#x27;ve seen

Wich are the easiest and speedest algos for F2L?

          <div class="email-content">Ok, Chris, I&#x27;m trying to work on Centrals commutators.  I think it&#x27;ll 
help my times a lot on the 5x5x5.  The algs and setups are so much 
shorter, and you&#x27;re solving twice the pieces!  You said if anybody was 
interested, you could talk to them, well as a fellow big cube blindfold 
cubist.  

I&#x27;d really like to see what you&#x27;ve got to say.  I&#x27;ve pioneered a bunch 
of things, and taken little blurbs, and put them in terms that I could 
explain.  Your every comment has shaped my blindfolded experience.  I 
can do commutators, but I want to directly solve like such, and 
quickly, and have a larger number of tricks I can pull out of my hat.  
The number of tricks a mathematician has is what makes him great.  
Likewise for cubing.  I want to be great, sure, solving these cubes 
blindfolded is amazing enough, but I want to solve them fast, so that 
I&#x27;m at my prime when we compete :)

Others feel free to input too!

solving these edges with 3-cycles?  I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what the

Oops, sorry, I see now.  I got wrapped up in the memo description and 
missed that you showed the edges solution.  

But you say you don&#x27;t memo or solve the edges that way; why not?  You 
seem at ease with finding those edge moves and that was a nice short 
solution you gave for them.

Oops, sorry, I see now. I got wrapped up in the memo description and 
missed that you showed the edges solution. 

But you say you don&#x27;t memo or solve the edges that way; why not? You 
seem at ease with finding those edge moves and that was a nice short 
solution you gave for them.

solving.  

In German:  singen: to sing, so Singen would be the action for S.
In Spanish:  cantar: to sing, so Cantar would be the action for C.

Does anybody think that a non-English system based on a letter scheme 
would work effectively, because, I see potential in it!

          <div class="email-content">Hey !

I didnt think of it that way because Im not using a PAO system, but I was
some time ago memorizing corners in German numbers and edges in French
numbers so I didnt confuse it all. But I eventually changed my method so it
doesnt really matter anymore.

Now, Im slowly switching to a sound method, where I have French, English
and German words kinda independently used. For example: UF edge is something
with the sound J (ja or jo depending on the orientation) where J stands
for Je (me, or I), same goes for T as in Tu (you), thats UB. But then, I
have R (UR) and L (UL) as in Right and Left (again, ra or ro for good/bad
orientation) and variants on the same idea. Im still in the very beginning
on using this system so Im most likely going to rearrange it with some
time/experience.

So to sum it up, language doesnt really matter, I just have to master the
basics of that very language. It wouldnt make much sense to use images in
languages I dont know. And preferably, the whole system must be coherent,
thats why for example my sound for FR is N (as in nine, the original
number), and the BR edge would then be something with M because Im used to
working in the R layer instead of for example in the E slice.

But then again, Im experimenting this system, not yet used to it at full
speed. Time will tell.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Daniel,

I personally think English is a very good language for memorising 
stuff. I actually combine Dutch and English for my memorization of 
the corners. Sometimes, I can&#x27;t think of a Dutch word imediately, 
but I can think of an English word.

I also have plans to make images of objects for all letter pairs, 
because you and Chris seem to like that, and I&#x27;d like to try 
myself... I also think Dutch won&#x27;t be any good for that... English 
is a pretty versatile language, I think, and much better for 
converting 2 random letters into words.

          Hi Daniel,

I personally think English is a very good language for memorising 
stuff. I actually combine Dutch and English for my memorization of 
the corners. Sometimes, I can&#x27;t think of a Dutch word imediately, 
but I can think of an English word.

I also have plans to make images of objects for all letter pairs, 
because you and Chris seem to like that, and I&#x27;d like to try 
myself... I also think Dutch won&#x27;t be any good for that... English 
is a pretty versatile language, I think, and much better for 
converting 2 random letters into words.

Not kanji but hiragana works.
One hiragana corresponds to exact one syllable, one vowel preceded by an
optional consonant.
We have a long tradition to map a series of digits to a sentence.
For example, junior high students learn sqrt(5) = 2.2360679 as
&quot;fu ji san roku ou mu na ku&quot; (a parrot crows at the foot of Fuji).
This memorization method is called &quot;Goro-awase&quot;. We Japanese are quite
familiar with
various kinds of goro-awase sentences. (9x9 mul table, pi digits,
periodic table in chemics, etc.)
http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%AA%9E%E5%91%82%E5%90%88%E3%82%8F%E3%81%9B

In Japan, 3-cycle method dominate to solve 3x3x3 BLD.
Most BLD cubers memorize cycles with goro (but don&#x27;t invent meanings
everytime).
That is, write down the cycle in digits, then read in goro (digit-sound
mapping),
repeat, that&#x27;s all.

I personally don&#x27;t have an experience with big cubes BLD. But I imagine
Japanese language might have advantages for place-and-object method also.
Almost every combination of two hiragana composes a meaningful word.
We have about 60 hiragana (50 basic + 25 variants - some phonetically
indistinguishable ones).
That would be easy to find a good subset of 24 suitable for big cubes.

          <div class="email-content">Sorry, I was a bit off-topic.
Please read my previous post as an explanation how
usual Japanese would memorize.

As for person-verb method, Kanji is not a very good way to represent
actions for Japanese speakers.
I have to further map Kanji to sounds, that mean hiragana.

We have a lot of single-letter nouns in Japanese.
E.g. &quot;i&quot; for stomach, &quot;u&quot; for cormorant, &quot;e&quot; for picture.
In this sense, person-object system might work.
But almost no single-letter verbs are found in Japanese.

Chinese speakers might find verb systems convenient.

Yes, sorry about that. What happened was that my site went down around
two weeks ago, and I was unable to access anything for a while... So
unfortunately I was unable to start the competition when I planned.

It took a few days to find a new host and relocate to it, and then a few
more days to get the cube simulator and the competitions server fully
operational again. But hopefully it is all ok now. Please let me know if
it&#x27;s not :-)

I would like to begin the art of blinfolded rubik solving, but I would

I know that many people use Pochmann&#x27;s method.

What do you suggest me to learn?

          <div class="email-content">He&#x27;s right, that&#x27;s the only way you can have one piece flipped on the 3x3x3.   The cube is unsolveable if you only have to flip one edge.
   
  To answer the question you are looking for, an algorithm like M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;U2MUMUMU2 will flip the UF and UB, that alg will usually suffice w/ some setups.

It would probably transition well into the 3-cycle method or Pochmann. If you&#x27;re comfortable 
enough with the cube and are willing to try a more complicated method, take a look at both 
2-cycles (Pochmann) and 3-cycles and choose the method you like more. They&#x27;re both good, 
so it&#x27;s just a matter of preference.</div>

  When I conclude in the summary, there are 12 ways, I mean there 
   
  You can have, since then I&#x27;ve learned a better commuator to my examples.  I will have to update this later.  Nobody has gotten to use this yet, save for a few people.  Oh yes, the comments up top were to Chris Hardwick, who read and approved this guide =)

          I am happy that at last you are giving it a try. Instead of PA method , if you use PAO method, It will be good for 3 cycle and also memorisation will be faster with practice. Though not now, you might realise it later.
   
  All the very best and plz share your experience. bernett is fine and doing well.

      Hi, 

Thanks for your reply.

I think this method definately allows sub3 times. I did 2:20 with a 
modified version of this.

I also think the basic idea of not orienting first is very 
promissing, and this method is a good &#x27;non-orient-first&#x27; method to 
start with. If you fully understand how solving the pieces without 
orienting works, you can move on to a method where you solve mostly 
in three cycles (like the explanations on the bottom of the page).</div>

I currently don&#x27;t really know what kind of BLD method is the best 
one... I recently switched to a new method for the edges (also 
Stefan&#x27;s, very much like the T-permutation method, but more 
efficient), and I nowadays do CO + CP for the corners. Not getting 
very fast with it yet, but I&#x27;ll try to practice it more..

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

I have a question about the Pochmann 2-cycle method.  When solving
either corners or edges and you find that you have a piece in the
correct location but with the incorrect orientation do you prefer to
use the buffer to solve it by &quot;shooting into&quot; that cycle?  Or do you
prefer to just use an orientation alg to flip that piece with another
or other pieces that are either also in the incorrect place but
misoriented, or with another piece or pieces that are not flipped
correctly for the cycle they are in?

I hope that question makes sense, let me know if I worded it oddly.

Chris</div>

          <div class="email-content">Chris,

I&#x27;m glad that you are considering 2-cycles :) 
Remember my corner method is on the rubiks.has.it forum

The only pieces that orientation alg are used on are pieces that are 
permuted w/ a twist.

If multiple edges are disoriented orient them together with an 
algorithm.  If it is only one, I will orient this disoriented piece 
with the buffer.  Normally, inbetween cycles.

Lets say I see the cycle  ADELNS, then I get the buffer, and I notice 
as I&#x27;m scanning the cube that the DL is disoriented.  After solving 
the first cycle, I would then do L2y&#x27; M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;U2MUMUMU2 yL2.  And I 
would continue with the next cycle.  I would just memo that visually, 
actually since you&#x27;ll have a buffer, remember the chain solving, 
don&#x27;t think of starting a new cycle as a single letter, just pick the 
next piece that you want to solve, let it be one that is easy to 
target/remember.  If the UFR is unsolved in the first cycle, I always 
start my next cycle there.  You can take advantage of the letter Q.  
Let Q be your buffer, the only reason you&#x27;ll get a Q is reminding you 
to orient a piece.  For instance:  The DL are the letters V and T for 
me, with respect to D and L of course, so I&#x27;d memorize either VQ-
Ventriloquist of TQ-Ticket to signal that I&#x27;m orienting.  And that 
would work perfect for me, as I know xQ images, but not Qy images, if 
that makes sense (images who&#x27;s secondary letter is Q, I do know those)

Corners:  You would memorize the location of the U/D sticker, pair 
this with Q.

EQ-Earthquake would signify that the UFR is disoriented, the U 
sticker is on the F face.  I would save this for last, and do 
y2R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2RLUL&#x27;ULU2L&#x27;y2.  

If I got HQ-Headquarters, the UFR is disoriented with the U sticker 
on the R face.  I&#x27;d then do z&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2RLUL&#x27;ULU2L&#x27;z.  I have two 
nice algs to orient D corners, I&#x27;ll have to share them with you 
soon.  Email me and I&#x27;ll be sure to do that :)

Orienting a single corner with the buffer is rather easy.  I&#x27;ll be 
sure to give the information ;)

          <div class="email-content">Using PLL to orient edges is by no means effective!  Even two Y-perms 
for orienting corners is ineffective!

So take the advice I gave you in the personal email, and go with it, 
as I wouldn&#x27;t want to steer my competition in the wrong direction ;)

          <div class="email-content">Josh,
I&#x27;m sorry, Chris and I are very open about a lot of things.  I sent 
him an email, I asked him how his life was going, he said he&#x27;s been 
having a hard time practicing, because he&#x27;s been so busy.  You know 
things that are personal real life events don&#x27;t go public.  I told 
him the same exact stuff in the email I sent him.  I&#x27;m sorry that I 
sent a private email asking how his job hunt was going, or wishing 
him best of luck at Chattahoochee.

I totally understand where you are coming from.  I&#x27;m glad that you 
actually are &quot;holding off&quot; on questions.  Take that from the 
perspective that you are doing personal exploration.

Just because I sent an individual email to Chris Hardwick (and I say 
it in a public place) don&#x27;t get all upset because I didn&#x27;t send you 
an email when I don&#x27;t know you.  If you want I can send you a private 
email with all of my methods tricks, ideas, so on and so forth.  
Actually that would sort of contradict what you were just complaining 
about.  

So everybody 

Here are some links for reading that you should look into, 

http://dbeyer.110mb.com/images.html
http://dbeyer.110mb.com/centers_commutators.txt
http://dbeyer.110mb.com/printables.html

go to the Rubiks.has.it forums for more information, in the 
blindfolded forum.  Those forums are much better moderated and useful 
than these, this forum is dead and unorganized.  Lol ... no offense.

Later,
Daniel Beyer

I did? Wow, didn&#x27;t even know that. Oh wait, I&#x27;m not a mo..ng person

Ironically you discredit yourself in your response
though.  Take it easy Dan.

The whole Marcus bashing session we had a while back
was extremely immature by the way.  Thumbs up to
everyone who took the time to chase him off the forum.
 God forbid we listen to someone&#x27;s ideas if we don&#x27;t
believe their times.

This is the same mentality that made the speedcubing
&#x27;forum&#x27; nearly unbearable for me.

Successful solves in competition will not make you an
online force.

People care about his methods.  I do, for one.  He had
a lot of great ideas -- I found them worthy of
consideration.  Chris may step forward and admit he&#x27;s
pulled something from Marcus&#x27;s ideas as well.

That&#x27;s kind of wierd -- We can&#x27;t disclose his methods
because there&#x27;s no way to prove the solving is real? 
I&#x27;m fairly certain I could disclose his methods -
they&#x27;re still in the archive most likely.  

>   Didn&#x27;t you get that from Richard&#x27;s post?

Apparently I wasn&#x27;t obvious enough with the sarcastic
tone.  So to spell it out, the way you guys ran Marcus
out of the group was the highest form of stupidity
executed in the most severe degree.  Who the hell made
you, or Chris, or anyone else for that matter, an
authority on blindfold cubing?  Where do I sign up for
the &quot;banishing badge&quot; so I can chase off anyone I dont
agree with or believe.

Similarly, a few guys on the speedcubing forum recently bashed 
Danyang Chen, most prominently Toby Mao accusing him of &quot;obvious&quot; 
cheating, both on the forum and on youtube.

33167

http://youtube.com/watch?v=p-s3VIBRl_U

Others (at least Ron and me) pointed out that bad quality videos can 
easily make things look unreal, and then Danyang even repeated his 
feat on TV. The accusers&#x27; reaction? None. Apparently it&#x27;s still 
obvious cheating. I guess they believe it&#x27;s Chinese propaganda TV and 
all fake.

          <div class="email-content">Hi:

One difference i know from buying a cube today and buying a cube 
from when the fad first started is that you could buy a solutions 
book from the company.  At that time Solutions book for the cube 
were selling in bookstores. Not all of them seem to be as easy as 
Ideal Toy Solutions book.   I have to admit I did have experience 
before learning from from the Ideal Toy Solutions book. I do 
remember solving it several times before learning from that book.  
So, that book is not necessarily perfect.  I doubt you could learn 
from scratch from that book or any other book I saw.   

At that time you could find a variety of solutions book.  Now if buy 
a cube or any other puzzle you cant get a solutions book if you are 
frustrated.    You could look on the internet.   

I was wondering if within the last ten years or 5 years or after the 
fad has gone, if anyone wrote a solutions book and tried to sell it 
in the marketplace?

Nowadays with the Dummies title and Idiots guide, I am figuring that 
would fit to write a rubiks cube solution.  It may not hurt to have 
Will Smith&#x27;s endorsement either.:-)

After I got out of college, I was thinking people stopped selling 
rubiks cube.  Than I went to stores and I was suprised. I am 
astounded that the cube is still a big seller. So, I am thinking 
right now.  People will buy a solutions book.  There still seems to 
be a market.  I realize one argument is you can go on the internet 
and find out the solution.  Well, you could learn computer stuff 
such as web design all from the internet but that does not stop 
people from writing computer books.  They still sell.  

I imagine if you can write a rubiks cube in such a way first grader 
or 2nd grader could figure it out than you will have a best seller.</div>

          <div class="email-content">I know this is a touchy subject so I&#x27;ll try to make this post brief. 
As Richard Patterson said yes I do use some ideas in my blindfolded
solving that I got from Marcus, specifically some of his ideas for
memorizing corner orientation and a few of his middle slice edge three
cycles.  I also still credit him on my webpage for motivating me to
learn big cubes BLD http://tinyurl.com/2jljda

As to the infamous flame war, in retrospect I was extremely frustrated
at the time with what I saw was a huge disconnect between the public
image Marcus gave of how incredibly little he was able to practice
because of his busy schedule and his phenomenal, and still yet to be
equaled by anyone, improvement in BLD cubing - particularly big cube BLD.

In my defense I don&#x27;t just go around claiming everyone who&#x27;s fast is a
fake, I had been gathering my opinions about Marcus for over a year
before making that statement.  In my own prosecution I would
definitely be a complete jackass if Marcus is for real and I said the
things I did.  However I still stand by my original statement in that
I am more convinced in the direction of my original statement than
not.  Having said that I will still admit publicly that I am a jackass
if future evidence shows that Marcus is for real and that I am in fact
a jackass.  I don&#x27;t mind saying it if it is true.

To answer the question: Bernett Orlando is writing a book intended

not sure.

You&#x27;re right, though, a book about cubing might actually sell, and 
the &quot;... for dummies&quot; argument is a good one. On the other hand, 
there are tons of solution websites. And let&#x27;s admit it, a solution 
for the cube doesn&#x27;t need a book, just a few pages at most.

          <div class="email-content">Stefan:

I would agree with you that a solution may not take many pages and 
just a few pages.  I think I see that if you are talking about one 
solution.  

I only really know one solution.  Which is solve one side and 
complete a layer around it. Than get corners and solve the side on 
the bottom which completes 3rd layer. Than go for middle layer. I 
did learn quite a bit of solution were you solve one side than 
complete 1st layer than 2nd layer and than solve the 3rd layer.  

Now there are various solutions.  I am also interested in speed 
cubing. I would love to know how to solve it in a manner of seconds 
like people in this group.  Like less than 30 or 40 seconds.  I 
realize part of this wrist and fingers speed or turning speed. I 
just have not discovered the quick solution.  

I am sure if you talk about acquainting people with speed cubing and 
blind fold cubing and various solutions.  You could incorporate a 
lot of information and create a concise book.  I know the Ideal Toy 
Solutions book was 14 pages.  What I liked about it was that you had 
pictures and no terminology.  So for me it was easier.   

You are right there are web sites with solutions.  But how many of 
them are really easy.  I have seen something with 
www.Nerdparadise.com but it will not show a person how to solve one 
side. The Ideal Toy Solution book did not either.  

I am sure if you put out a book with a catchy title like the 
Solution Undiscovered or solution you never would have thought of.  
People will buy.  Especially if u include a title like frustrated 
with the cube discover the solution that you can use immediately.

I will try and ask this in a more general website.

          <div class="email-content">I think a book would be a great idea. All recent methods and a lot of good algs for each case should be in it.

But most people just seem to write this in how-to&#x27;s on the internet and on the internet you have the advantage of using applets or even video. I think a book should also include a dvd with some speedcubing videos and a links-on-the-internet section.

  Subject: [blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube] Anyone wrote a solutions book recently?


  Hi:

  One difference i know from buying a cube today and buying a cube 
  from when the fad first started is that you could buy a solutions 
  book from the company. At that time Solutions book for the cube 
  were selling in bookstores. Not all of them seem to be as easy as 
  Ideal Toy Solutions book. I have to admit I did have experience 
  before learning from from the Ideal Toy Solutions book. I do 
  remember solving it several times before learning from that book. 
  So, that book is not necessarily perfect. I doubt you could learn 
  from scratch from that book or any other book I saw. 

  At that time you could find a variety of solutions book. Now if buy 
  a cube or any other puzzle you cant get a solutions book if you are 
  frustrated. You could look on the internet. 

  I was wondering if within the last ten years or 5 years or after the 
  fad has gone, if anyone wrote a solutions book and tried to sell it 
  in the marketplace?

  Nowadays with the Dummies title and Idiots guide, I am figuring that 
  would fit to write a rubiks cube solution. It may not hurt to have 
  Will Smith&#x27;s endorsement either.:-)

  After I got out of college, I was thinking people stopped selling 
  rubiks cube. Than I went to stores and I was suprised. I am 
  astounded that the cube is still a big seller. So, I am thinking 
  right now. People will buy a solutions book. There still seems to 
  be a market. I realize one argument is you can go on the internet 
  and find out the solution. Well, you could learn computer stuff 
  such as web design all from the internet but that does not stop 
  people from writing computer books. They still sell. 

  I imagine if you can write a rubiks cube in such a way first grader 
  or 2nd grader could figure it out than you will have a best seller. 
  From looking at other books, I doubt there was such a book. 

  I wonder if anyone is planning on probably writing a solutions book?

          <div class="email-content">And i am sorry for, even after holding my questions off, i still 
ended up asking questions a little early. I am understanding more 
and more about not only this group but also the cube and solving. I 
didnt mean to start anything at all. I just know i dont know anyone 
and dont have a personal relationship like you guys do. I think it 
is awesome and maybe one day i can be on the same level as the 
people that have been doing this for a long time.

          <div class="email-content">Josh, does that mean that you figured out more things?  That&#x27;s awsome!  Pochmann&#x27;s method becomes a little brain dead, because you&#x27;re only targeting stickers.  One piece at a time, you always do the same exact thing for a certain piece, it may just happen at the end rather than at the begining ... sometimes you&#x27;ll target the UF, and others you&#x27;ll target the FU, still braindead.  Work on memo you&#x27;re speed will come.  Is there anything you have to ask about memo/exe of a blindfolded solve still?  I&#x27;m seriously up to answer questions.

I talked to him recently and he still blindfolds and
he continues to raise new/good ideas.  Has a fairly
decent EO method that&#x27;s worthy of recognition...

I&#x27;m sorry to those who burned that bridge -_-

          <strong>227. Quantitative ranking of BLD systems</strong><br>
          <em>From:</em> &quot;cmhardw&quot; &lt;foozman17@...&gt;<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m looking for a way to quantitatively rank the potential of a BLD 
system based on two things, speed and quantity of memorization as well 
as speed of and number of moves used in execution.

I&#x27;ve been exploring a number of different methods for the 3x3x3, and 
thus also the 3x3x3 within the 5x5x5, and I have found parts of 
methods are better than others.

For example solving both position and orientation at the same time is 
relatively easy using 2 cycles or commutators, except for when the 
orientation in a cycle is unbalanced, meaning the last piece returns 
to the intial place but flipped.  If you don&#x27;t use techniques from 
Pochmann to handle this it is somewhat difficult to memorize and solve.

Standard orient first is amazingly easy to memorize and solve, except 
for the number of moves is huge in comparison to commutators only.

I have some ideas on how to quantitatively rank BLD systems, but 
nowhere near enough for me to actually rank one system as better than 
another.  Does anyone have any ideas?  I&#x27;ll try to solidify my own, 
but I wanted to put the question out there.  For speedcubing we have 
ideas of which systems are better, or faster than others, but nothing 
like this exists for BLD.  I know people will still be able to be fast 
using different systems, and systems that are not very similar to 
eachother either, but surely it must be the case that for the 
combination of both memorizing and solving it is possible that one 
system can be proven &quot;better&quot; than another by some given set of 
quantitative criteria.

Any ideas?

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m almost certain this method has been brought up before, so this is
not new.  However I have been dedicating myself to learning an
existing BLD system with a new take on it.

I&#x27;m now solving the cube entirely with commutators, and I solve
position and orientation at the same time.  So I both position and
orient pieces 2 at a time if possible.

Each sticker of each piece is given a letter and I memorize using my
usual images from big cube BLD.  I have the problem of what I call
&quot;unbalanced&quot; cycles which I handle by orienting those pieces before I
start solving.  For the 5x5x5 I use commutators for this, for the
3x3x3 I just use regular orientation algs.

Here is an example solve, with the memorization as well.

Scramble the cube starting with it in your initial &quot;solved&quot; configuration:
B D2 F&#x27; L R2 F2 R&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; R2 B D&#x27; R&#x27; L&#x27; U D2 R F D&#x27; B&#x27; D B&#x27; F&#x27; L2 U

I will use Daniel Beyer&#x27;s naming scheme for stickers, or at least I
learned it from him so don&#x27;t bash him if someone else invented it. 
When I say three letters for a corner, or two for an edge, the first
letter I mention is the sticker I am describing.  So if I say &quot;UB&quot; I
mean the U sticker of the UB piece.  If I say &quot;UFL&quot; I mean the U
sticker of the UFL corner.

Ok so I start at UB and here are my cycles:
Edges: (UB->DL->BU)(UL->FD->RD->RB->DB->FU->LU)(BL&lt;->RF)

I consider the DL and the FU pieces to be &quot;flipped&quot;.  This is because
notice that the DL piece goes to the BU spot and not the UB where I
started.  Same for the FU piece which goes to the LU and not the UL
where I started.  So I also memorize that DL and FU are &quot;flipped&quot;.

Corners:
(UBL->FDL->FDR->BUR->BUL)(UFL->UFR->FUL)(DBL&lt;->DBR)

Again by the same reasoning as for the edges I consider the BUR and
UFR pieces to be &quot;unbalanced&quot;.  BUR must rotate coutnerclockwise for
me to call it balanced and UFR must rotate clockwise.  So I memorize
those two also.

Now I have memorized the cube, so I start solving.

1) Balance all unbalanced pieces.
edges: D x M&#x27; U M&#x27; U M&#x27; U2 M U M U M U2 x&#x27; D&#x27;
corners: L U L&#x27; U L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R

2) solve corners
(UBL->FDL->FDR->BUR)(UFL->UFR)(DBL&lt;->DBR)
a) UBL->FDL->FDR : F&#x27; R&#x27; B2 R F R&#x27; B2 R
b) (UFL&lt;->UFR)&amp;(DBL&lt;->DBR) : B2 F R&#x27; F&#x27; L F R F&#x27; L2 B&#x27; R B L B&#x27; R&#x27; B B2
I realize this isn&#x27;t a commutator really.  On the 5x5x5 I would do
this with the same alg, so it&#x27;s one of the few cases where I don&#x27;t use
a commutator.
c) I am left with (UBL&lt;->BUR) and I remember this as parity in the
corners.

3) solve edges
(UB->DL)(UL->FD->RD->RB->DB->FU)(BL&lt;->RF)

a) (UB&lt;->DL)&amp;(BL&lt;->RF) : Done with 2 commutators
first: L  U&#x27; F&#x27; E F U&#x27; F&#x27; E&#x27; F U2 L&#x27;
second: F&#x27; U2 F&#x27; E F U2 F&#x27; E&#x27; F2

b) UL->FD->RD : M&#x27; U&#x27; M D&#x27; M&#x27; U M D

c) UL->RB->DB : B L&#x27; E L U&#x27; L&#x27; E&#x27; L U B&#x27;

this leaves me with UL&lt;->FU which is parity in the edges.

On the 3x3x3 I&#x27;d do this to fix parity: M&#x27; R&#x27; leaving an arrow PLL. 
So the whole alg is : M&#x27; R&#x27; F2 U F2 U F2 U&#x27;R&#x27; U&#x27; R F2 R&#x27; U R M R

----------------

Again this method is not new, but I&#x27;m starting to try to explore how
fast it can go both on 3x3x3 and 5x5x5.  It&#x27;s a much better 5x5x5
method than a 3x3x3 method I&#x27;ve found so far, because you can execute
commutators so much faster than orientation algs when on the 5x5x5 and
going a bit more slowly because it&#x27;s BLD.

Just wanted to provide an example in case anyone else is doing this,
or something like it too.  I know Daniel Beyer is, but I figured I&#x27;d
put a post up here too in case anyone else was interested or already
did this.

My biggest problem right now is with those &quot;unbalanced&quot; pieces which
have &quot;off&quot; orientation for the smaller cycle group they are in. 
Memorization is weird because I&#x27;m used to orient first and thus pieces
and not stickers.  I can sometimes memorize just as fast as with my
old method using my images as from big cube BLD.

Solving is a lot slower, and memorization is almost always slower, but
I do occasionally memorize just as fast as with my current regular
method.  My fastest times are sub-2:30 using this method, but I
occasionally get times over 4 minutes too.  Once I get faster at
seeing the commutators with orientation and not just position I think
this method will be fast.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks. I have figured out a lot of new things. I have branched out 
and started working on memorization in other areas and it has been 
helping with BLD solves. I still havent gotten a complete solve 
though. I cant seem to work on it for a terribly long time. Before i 
was getting so frustrated that after 1 or 2 DNF i just had to hang 
it up. I have developed some improvment on my memorization which has 
really helped my memo times. As far as execution i think i am 
messing up at some point during the execution phase.  

I dont use the pochmann method i just posted that first message 
because i was trying to read all the different methods and learn to 
decide which one would be best.  3 cycles started out really hard 
for me to visualize. The setup moves are a little complex and i kept 
messing up orientation. Now i am using a different method and i am 
sure to get my first successful solve. I just dont have the time to 
devote to it every day. If i did i would have gotten it by now i am 
sure.

awsome!  Pochmann&#x27;s method becomes a little brain dead, because 
you&#x27;re only targeting stickers.  One piece at a time, you always do 
the same exact thing for a certain piece, it may just happen at the 
end rather than at the begining ... sometimes you&#x27;ll target the UF, 
and others you&#x27;ll target the FU, still braindead.  Work on memo 
you&#x27;re speed will come.  Is there anything you have to ask about 
memo/exe of a blindfolded solve still?  I&#x27;m seriously up to answer

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris,

Thanks for posting, very interesting.  A little slow around here of 
late.  I give/have given the various methods a lot of thought, but I 
don&#x27;t really have any conclusions at all as to which is best, just 
opinions, hunches, random thoughts and more questions. There&#x27;s so 
much I don&#x27;t understand too well and am not good at.  So maybe my 
comments will help some new guys.

For now, I&#x27;d like to focus on the edges if that&#x27;s ok.

Maybe a short definition of commutators as it relates to the 3X3X3 
would help, because I&#x27;m not sure about it.

I have been messing around for a while now with solving via 3-cycles 
orienting-permuting at the same time, mostly just with eyes open.  My 
hunch is it&#x27;s a great way to go, but I&#x27;m having problems.  I feel I&#x27;m 
missing something in the memorizing or solving that would make it 
easier.

So, for example, one edge could be A or B, the next C or D, etc., 
depending on which sticker is facing which way- is that right?  

Letter pairs seems like a reasonable approach, my only problem is 
that I&#x27;m so used to the major system, it would take a lot of 
adjustment, but not insurmountable.  Another thought is to give each 
sticker it&#x27;s own image, but then you&#x27;re using more images so I&#x27;ve 
always been looking to combine two edges.

I plead ignorance and cluelessness here.  

1. How do you find/derive/know these moves?  Do you think of them as 
you are solving?  

2. When you memorize, how do you recall that these pairs need 
swapping?  
 
> b) UL->FD->RD : M&#x27; U&#x27; M D&#x27; M&#x27; U M D
> 
> c) UL->RB->DB : B L&#x27; E L U&#x27; L&#x27; E&#x27; L U B&#x27;

Again, I don&#x27;t know how to find these moves.  They&#x27;re nice and 
short.  I have to put the edges on U and do a 3-cycle on U.

**For memorization, whatever scheme you use (letter pairs, whatever) 
is it correct that:  You need to know that the edge at UL *needs to 
flip* in order to go into the DF slot, and that the FD edge *does 
not* need to flip to go into the DR slot, and that the RD edge *will 
flip* as it goes into the UL slot-- that you need to know that in 
order to select the proper move to make, and that your memorization 
scheme tells you this info- is that correct?

Perhaps this is what you meant by &quot;unbalanced.&quot;  I&#x27;m just trying to 
understand in my own clumsy way.

This memo problem is *for me* still a challenge.  I think to 
myself, &quot;now this piece does this, this piece does that, so this 
piece must do that&quot;; it&#x27;s not smooth yet at all.  Of course, I could 
be doing it all wrong, no surprise.

A few other things I keep running through in my head.  

What about the cases where two or three edges are in place, but not 
oriented?  *It seems* that to use orient algs to fix those defeats 
the advantage of orienting and permuting together.  I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m 
just wondering.

Similarly, I keep wondering:  the fastest 3-cycle guys presumably 
orient edges very quickly right at the start of their solves, and I 
assume have honed their 3-cycles to great heights, so I wonder:  is 
orienting and perming edges together *that* much faster than doing 
them separately?  Again, I don&#x27;t know, I just wonder.

Which leads me to keep wondering:  where does the advantage lie for 
the top two guys?  Is it a system, their own brilliance, hand speed, 
recall ability, tons of practice?  One day I think it&#x27;s the first; 
the next day I think it&#x27;s the latter three.  
   
Again I ramble.  I see that there are some 280 members in this group, 
maybe 5 or so active posters, so maybe someone had some of my same 
questions.  Hope so.

          <div class="email-content">Chris and I are working on getting faster and faster at blindfolded cubing, he is insanely fast, I hope that one day I can catch up to him!
   
  http://z12.invisionfree.com/rubiks/index.php?showtopic=175
   
  I think that this is a great intro to commutators, done by Doug Reed.
   
  http://z12.invisionfree.com/rubiks/index.php?showtopic=207
   
  Chris&#x27;s input above

  http://dbeyer.110mb.com/centers_commutators.txt&#x27;
   
  I think this is a good theory to explaining freestyling commutators.
   
  http://z12.invisionfree.com/rubiks/index.php?showtopic=704
   
  Some examples of commutators, and dumbing them down even for the wings on the 4x4 and 5x5
   
  What we do to find a commutator.  We look for the cycle.
  UL->UR->FD
  the UL and UR are interchangeable on the U face by a turn of U2
  Rewriting this cycle it is UR->FD->UL
   
  If UL and UR are interchangeable, that means the FD is the lone edge.  The FD must interact with the UL first to cycle in the correct direction.
   
  The question is then:  How can the FD be solved to the UR or UL.  Now mind you the FD must still interact with the UL, it&#x27;s just that there are two parts, this is where freestyling comes into play.
   
  If you read, you&#x27;ll see that a commutator is composed of ABA&#x27;B&#x27;.  Let B be the be the interchanging of the UL and UR, that is
  B: U2
   
  We can do this in several different ways:
  the FD can go to the UL with S&#x27;D&#x27;S, that is our &quot;A&quot;
  Now swap the UL and UR with U2 (our &quot;B&quot;)
  Undo the S&#x27;D&#x27;S; this is S&#x27;DS  (our A&#x27;)
  Undo the U2;  this is U2 (our B&#x27;)
   
  Now we could do another take on this cycle.  Remember to cycle in the correct direction, the FD (the lone edge) must interact with the location it goes to.
   
  if we did BAB&#x27;A&#x27; where A is a different action move, we could achieve the same result.
   
  It&#x27;s possible to to U2, SDS&#x27;, U2, SD&#x27;S&#x27;
   
  This is what Chris and I would call a drop and slide alg.
   
  Another similar Cycle:
   
  UL->UR->FD
   
  I see again that the UR and UL are interchangeable by U2
  Now the LD is the lone edge.  Can you see how it can be solved to the UR or UL with three moves?
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
  I say this is a direct insert case.  LEL&#x27; U2 LE&#x27;L U2, for this case, 
  why not L&#x27;E&#x27;L U2 L&#x27;EL U2
   
  Now we can break down this case into something different (not simpler, but it&#x27;s the concept of breaking a freestyle case down into something simpler)  Actually I&#x27;ll get back to you on this.
   
   
  Farewell,

Maybe a short definition of commutators as it relates to the 3X3X3 
would help, because I&#x27;m not sure about it.

I have been messing around for a while now with solving via 3-cycles 
orienting-permuting at the same time, mostly just with eyes open. My 
hunch is it&#x27;s a great way to go, but I&#x27;m having problems. I feel I&#x27;m 
missing something in the memorizing or solving that would make it 
easier.

So, for example, one edge could be A or B, the next C or D, etc., 
depending on which sticker is facing which way- is that right? 

Letter pairs seems like a reasonable approach, my only problem is 
that I&#x27;m so used to the major system, it would take a lot of 
adjustment, but not insurmountable. Another thought is to give each 
sticker it&#x27;s own image, but then you&#x27;re using more images so I&#x27;ve 
always been looking to combine two edges.

I plead ignorance and cluelessness here. 

1. How do you find/derive/know these moves? Do you think of them as 
you are solving? 

2. When you memorize, how do you recall that these pairs need 
swapping? 

> b) UL->FD->RD : M&#x27; U&#x27; M D&#x27; M&#x27; U M D
> 
> c) UL->RB->DB : B L&#x27; E L U&#x27; L&#x27; E&#x27; L U B&#x27;

Again, I don&#x27;t know how to find these moves. They&#x27;re nice and 
short. I have to put the edges on U and do a 3-cycle on U.

**For memorization, whatever scheme you use (letter pairs, whatever) 
is it correct that: You need to know that the edge at UL *needs to 
flip* in order to go into the DF slot, and that the FD edge *does 
not* need to flip to go into the DR slot, and that the RD edge *will 
flip* as it goes into the UL slot-- that you need to know that in 
order to select the proper move to make, and that your memorization 
scheme tells you this info- is that correct?

Perhaps this is what you meant by &quot;unbalanced.&quot; I&#x27;m just trying to 
understand in my own clumsy way.

This memo problem is *for me* still a challenge. I think to 
myself, &quot;now this piece does this, this piece does that, so this 
piece must do that&quot;; it&#x27;s not smooth yet at all. Of course, I could 
be doing it all wrong, no surprise.

A few other things I keep running through in my head. 

What about the cases where two or three edges are in place, but not 
oriented? *It seems* that to use orient algs to fix those defeats 
the advantage of orienting and permuting together. I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m 
just wondering.

Similarly, I keep wondering: the fastest 3-cycle guys presumably 
orient edges very quickly right at the start of their solves, and I 
assume have honed their 3-cycles to great heights, so I wonder: is 
orienting and perming edges together *that* much faster than doing 
them separately? Again, I don&#x27;t know, I just wonder.

Which leads me to keep wondering: where does the advantage lie for 
the top two guys? Is it a system, their own brilliance, hand speed, 
recall ability, tons of practice? One day I think it&#x27;s the first; 
the next day I think it&#x27;s the latter three. 

Again I ramble. I see that there are some 280 members in this group, 
maybe 5 or so active posters, so maybe someone had some of my same 
questions. Hope so.

Now mind you the FD must still interact with the UL, it&#x27;s just that

          <strong>234. (Sorry if double-posted) Confusion with Bill McGaugh&#x27;s method</strong><br>

          <div class="email-content">[If this double-posts, it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t see the message nearly
20-30 minutes after posting it, and I recall it usually takes under 5
minutes -- SORRY!]

I&#x27;m on a 1-week break from school and I decided that I *am going to*
learn how to BLDS in this free time.

I have tried Pochmann&#x27;s method before, but never really dedicated much
time to it, and it never entirely clicked with me (always had trouble
with messing up corner orientation)

I read in a recent message that Bill McGaugh&#x27;s system is real easy, so I
checked it out ( http://home.earthlink.net/~bmcgaugh/ ). However, I&#x27;m
having trouble understanding what he&#x27;s saying regarding corner
orientation, too!

He numbers the corners as follows:

1 UFL (up front left)                                              2 UFR
3 UBR                                              4 UBL
5 DFL                                              6 DFR
7 DBR                                              8 DBL
Self-explanatory. But then he explains the corner orientation as follows
(particularly note the bold):

Orienting Corners                                              Each
corner that needs orienting will be brought with setup moves to UFR. If
its orientation is 1,                                               we
will do the &quot;out&quot; orientation
Out= L D R&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; D R D&#x27; (turn cube 90 degrees clockwise or Z)
R&#x27; D&#x27; L D R D&#x27; L&#x27; D (turn 90 CCW or Z&#x27;)
If the orientation is 2, do Out twice.
or do: In= L U&#x27; F2 U F2 U L U&#x27; L2 D F2 D&#x27; F2 once
The setup moves for orienting corners are:
Position 1- no setup move required
2-                                              no seutp move required
3- L&#x27;
4- B&#x27;                                              L&#x27;
5- D&#x27;                                              R
6- R                                                                  7-
R2                                                                  8-
D&#x27;                                              R2
Note: we do not orient position 1.  When we finish the others, it will
be oriented correctly.

I can&#x27;t make sense of this though. . . I understand the setup moves for
1, 2, 6, 7, and 8, but 3, 4, and 5 seem like mistakes to me. For
example, position 3 (which is upper back right) is not even affected by
the setup move L&#x27;.

Shouldn&#x27;t the setup moves for those 3 be as follows?3 -- R&#x27;4 -- B&#x27; R&#x27;5
-- D R

Either I am not understanding what he&#x27;s doing, or there is a mistake .

Which is it?

Thanks!

To reiterate what someone else posted recently, perhaps one of the 
easiest methods is Bill McGaugh&#x27;s method. Although I have tinkered with 
Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s method before ( www.stefan-pochmann.de ), I am new to 
blindfolded cubing, and have just TODAY seriously began to learn. I 
think the McGaugh method is a lot easier.

However, I don&#x27;t think that he does the clearestr job explaining his 
own method on the site, so depending on your experience cubing, you 
might have to work though it slowly. 

http://home.earthlink.net/~bmcgaugh/

Commutators are sort of intuitive ways of creating your own algorithms, 
though I don&#x27;t think you need to know anything about them to 
blindfolded solve. The site solvethecube.co.uk (I think) has a tutorial 
on them.

Setup moves: You have an algorithm that swaps two pieces, between 
location1 and location2. To solve the cube blindfolded, you obviously 
want to move pieces more than 2 places. So, you can move ANY piece to 
location2 (using a few moves, which are the setup moves), THEN use your 
algorithm, and then undo your setup moves. In this manner, you can use 
one algorithm (along with simple setup moves) to move a piece (from 
location1) to wherever you want. Clear? 

Check out both Bill and Stefan&#x27;s methods.

good luck! (I will need it too)

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,

I&#x27;ve recently had a long run of DNFs.  I haven&#x27;t kept
an exact count, but I&#x27;m sure it is nothing less than
50 consecutive!

About 1 in 4 solves its fairly obvious how I messed
up.  The other 3 of the 4 it isn&#x27;t so obvious.  All I
can conclude is that I am messing up permutation
horribly.  

I&#x27;m not completely sure either but I suspect it is in
the execution and not in the memorization.  (I&#x27;ve done
quite a bit of practicing in memorizing the images of
a cube, and returning to it later to double check my
accuracy).

When I thought of this I did a lot of walk through
without the blindfold to make sure I was doing set up
moves correctly and such.  At least without the
blindfold I seem to do well.

I have tried doing solves that were deliberately slow
to different degrees (5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15
minutes, and so on devoted to memorization).  The end
results remain DNF.

I don&#x27;t have a functional webcam or video camera -
because of this I am unable to follow where the errors
occur while blindfolded.

Any suggestions? 

Has anyone else had this problem to such a degree?

-Richard

Ok, I admit it. I instructed your little brother to quickly peel off 
stickers and put them back on wrong while you&#x27;re blindfolded and not 
twisting.

  Richard, I don&#x27;t know what I can tell you about honing accuracy, but ... I can tell you this, when you&#x27;re in a slum, go faster.  Eventually you will get a solve, not only that but it&#x27;ll be fast!  Kill two birds with one stone.  
   
  In competition, going to slow will put you in last, and DNFing will put you in last, I&#x27;d rather take the risk and DNF than get successful solves and lose anyway.
   
  Certainly, some of the fastest are accurate too, such as Leyan Lo, or Matyas Kuti, what does it matter?  They had their DNF streaks, as we all have.  Push yourself to new limits, and you will break the old ones, you&#x27;re style for solving in practice will affect your outcome in competitions.  
   
  If you are concerned about DNFing at a competition, then trust me, I still say, go as fast as you can, memo and execution at home, then slow down, and your careful, slow pace will actually be quite fast itself :)  
   
  That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m concerned about is speed for 3x3 and 4x4 bld now, accuracy really matters not.  The time spent is trivial, go all out.  
   
  I don&#x27;t know how else to reiterate what I&#x27;ve just told you, but again, just push yourself, your accuracy will catch up to you.  And it&#x27;s ok to DNF, not a single soul solved the 3x3 at Chattahoochee :), not even Chris or I who solved big cubes blindfolded, hehe.

          <div class="email-content">Richard I can definitely sympathize.  When I first started with the
big cubes BLD I had incredibly long streaks of DNFs too, so I know the
frustration.

I have to agree with Daniel on this one though, just try to go faster
on your future solves.  Don&#x27;t worry about DNFs, I think we tend to
think of them as a bigger deal than they are.  Even if you completely
DNF, and not only that but you pop on the last solve in such a way as
to crack the axle and the center piece on that face falls onto the
floor you at least exercised your brain for the solve.

Just trying to use some humor here, but seriously no matter how bad
your DNF you still exercised your brain for that whole time.  I think
at least as far as BLD and memory goes your brain is very similar to a
muscle.  The more you exercise it the better it gets and the more it
is able to handle without feeling fatigued.

In order to get better though you have to force your brain to feel
fatigued.  Try one simple experiment, this is something that helps me
a lot for BLD training.  Try memorizing on one solve as *FAST* as
possible.  I mean seriously go faster than you have ever gone on a BLD
solve.  Most likely what will happen is that you will put on the
blindfold and not be able to recall much of the cube at all.  This is
normal.  Just try to recall as much as you can.  Take 10, 15, even 20
minutes with the blindfold still on and dig deep and try to recall
everything you possibly can despite the fact that you went way to fast
during memorization.

This sort of fatigues your brain so to speak, and when you try to
memorize again at your regular pace I guarantee it will feel a bit
easier than normal.

Just a thought, hope it helps.

Hang in there though man, DNFs happen, even crazy long streaks of
them.  We&#x27;ve all been there.

  Yea, Chris I think I withheld that from you.  Seriously, a lot of breakneck cubing made that solve oh too easy :)

  I&#x27;ve got a hybrid bld method I want to try now, as I was thinking of it.  It&#x27;s based on memorization slipping.  Visualize half the cube, then use a quick system that thought up to express a sequence of edges, then use images for the last few pairs.  
   
  I think it can get me fast :)
   
  I&#x27;m going to try it, and then explain it later.

David Calvo (of Spain) also blindfolds and he had a
neat idea:

Scramble two cubes identically.

Obviously you only have to memorize for one to solve
both.

Memorize, blindfold solve both.  Check results.

I did this once and and made a different unique error
on each one.  There may be some merit to this.

Or you could just scramble and solve one cube again and again with the 
same scramble, until you get it right. I&#x27;ve done that, though mostly to 
find out how fast I could be had I perfect recall so I could twist without 
breaks.

          <div class="email-content">I am new to blindfold cubing and I am working using the mcgaugh method 
to solve the cube while looking just to get used to the method. I 
perform my solving phase like so:CO,EO,CP,EP. But when I reach the EP 
stage of my solving stage and perform the T-perm and finish the EP my 
CP is ruined. I was thinking about switching my solving phase 
to:CO,EO,EP,CP and for my CP using mackys guide for that step. Would it 
be Ok combine methods like that? Does anyone know why Mcgaugh isnt 
working for me?

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s happening, or whether I&#x27;m just incompetent. 

I&#x27;m aware that edge orientation is supposed to be even, but I keep having trouble with edge orientation using Bll McGaugh&#x27;s method. 

Am I simply not understanding what an appropriately oriented edge is? Take the scramble: 
R2 U2 B2 D R D R&#x27; L D R F2 B2 D2 R2 L2 F R F&#x27; D L D&#x27; L D&#x27; L UÂ¤
Does this not leave only 3 disoriented edges (UL, FL, BL) ?

Anyhow, my problem is that whenever there is an odd number of disoriented edges, my UF piece (which Bill&#x27;s page says I am supposed to be able to ignore, as it will solve itself) ends up disoriented.

In addition to any responses, if anyone can talk to me on AIM, that would be superb (valikor).

Thanks!

          <div class="email-content">K figured out my problem. It was a stupid misunderstanding, and I feel like an idiot. 

Feel free to AIM me anyways though (valikor), as I am totally new to the blindfolding community. Don&#x27;t worry though -- I&#x27;m not a total noob who is going to give up in 2 hours. . . I can generally speedsolve in the 40s, and that&#x27;s after not practicing for the past 10 months or so ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Well...the first time you do the T-perm, your UFR and UBR corners
will swap...thus your CP is messed up...but that is temporary. 
After you do that an even number of times, the two corners will end up
where they belong. It will take an  even number of times, if you fix
the parity (when necessary) before the EP. If parity is ok after CP,
just keep going... things will be ok...or maybe I misunderstand you.

I&#x27;ve been using the McGaugh method as well.  Here&#x27;s a set of moves you
can go through that show the need for a parity T-perm:

{The scramble}
LU&#x27; L2 RD&#x27;UF&#x27;LR D2 B2 D&#x27;L R2 DF&#x27;D L2 R2 B2 R&#x27;U&#x27;B&#x27;UB L2 U2 B&#x27;FR

{The solution}
RB Alg_RM B&#x27;R&#x27;
Alg_RM
L&#x27;B&#x27; Alg_RM BL
dB Alg_RM B&#x27;d&#x27;
B Alg_RM B&#x27;
B&#x27; Alg_RM B

Alg_Out
R&#x27; Alg_Out R
B&#x27;R&#x27; Alg_Out RB

Alg_T
F2D&#x27;F2 Alg_T F2DF2
L2F2L2 Alg_T L2F2L2
DF2 Alg_T F2D&#x27;
F2 Alg_T F2
D&#x27;F2 Alg_T F2D
F2 Alg_T F2

Alg_T {parity}

D2L2 Alg_T L2D2
D&#x27;L2 Alg_T L2D
Alg_T
dL&#x27; Alg_T Ld&#x27;
L2 Alg_T L2
dL Alg_T L&#x27;d&#x27;
R2UR2 Alg_T R2U&#x27;R2
d&#x27;L&#x27; Alg_T Ld
DL2 Alg_T L2D&#x27;
d&#x27;L Alg_T L&#x27;d
R2UR2 Alg_T R2U&#x27;R2

These moves were confirmed using the CubeTwister from
http://www.randelshofer.ch/cubetwister2/download.html.  &quot;Alg_T&quot;
indicates the T-permutation, Alg_RM is the MUMUM U2 M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27; U2 move,
and Alg_Out is the &quot;Out&quot; sequence.</div>

function of allowing us to gather for any ideas we have for BLD
cubing.  Yes it may be quieter than other groups, but I don&#x27;t think

Jim Mittan got back to me about co-moderating so I have been in

clean up spam messages.  The only moderator abilites I need are to ban

Danyang has inspired me to work on my 3x3x3 more, though again big
cubes are my passion and I will continue to use my new ideas for the
inner 3x3x3 within the 5x5x5 when solving the 5x5x5.  Still when I
have time I&#x27;ll try to work on my 3x3 too.

  Is Orientation really worth it?  In my humble opinion, I say no.
   
  How powerful is a buffer?  What do you do for pieces that are permuted with a twist if you don&#x27;t orient first?!  Orient with Respect to the L/R stickers or the F/B stickers on the E slice?
   
  Must we orient U/D stickers?  Why not Orient L/R stickers, or F/B stickers?
   
  I&#x27;d like to call this the Focus and the Respect.
  Focus in on Opposite Colors.  U/D, L/R, or F/B.  After orienting with a U/D focus, the U/D stickers will be on the U/D face.  But the respect that you take it with.  Such as, orient the 4 L corners, so that the U/D stickers are Oriented, then the R corners so those 4 corners have their U/D stickers oriented.  So on and so forth.
   
  Also, when memorizing corners visually, solving directly ... I just was thinking of something that I&#x27;ve been doing sub consciously for a very long time.
   
  When solving adjacent corners.  Such as the DFL and the DLB,  or the UFR and ULF
   
  The first corner is what you remember vividly, then you memorize  the interchangeability of that and the next piece.  They are either interchangeable on the slice, on the face, or not at all.
   
  It&#x27;s been a brain dead thought occurrence throughout blindfolded solving, and as I was drifting off to slumber land last night I realized there could be some method to my subconscious madness!

That would go away if the moderators would just ban those members.

Not to sound pushy and impatient, but it&#x27;s very easy to ban a member
and it would get rid of all this spam on the group.

          <div class="email-content">Hey, 
I am trying to learn blindfold solving slowly but efficiently. I have 
attempted the 2x2 blindfolded numerous times but I have been 
unsuccessful. I have attempted just the corners of the 3x3 numerous 
times but I have also been unsuccessful with that. I found out that it 
is my CO that is causing the problem. Any tips or links with good CO 
sections?

That would go away if the moderators would just ban those members.

Not to sound pushy and impatient, but it&#x27;s very easy to ban a member 
and it would get rid of all this spam on the group.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I guess that the more we talk about it the more we&#x27;ll have spam.
Anyway, I don&#x27;t post anything because I&#x27;ve nothing to say about BLD, 
but I find posts of you blindfold solvers ALWAYS interesting and 
useful!
According to me, some messages of spam are not worth the closing of 
this group.
Plus, I think that this group is easier to maintain than other ones 
with more sections.
You know, spam hits the entire web community, so I guess it&#x27;s rather 
normal.
Moderators here should only clean this group up regularly.
About emails you know better than me that it&#x27;s very easy, there are 
many useful little programs that remove undesired messages.

PS: may I suggest to promote a member who posts regularly as a 
moderator?

To do this click on &quot;Members&quot; on the side bar and search for my ID,

says &quot;edit membership&quot;.  On the page that comes up click on the option
at the bottom of the page that says &quot;Change to Moderator&quot;.

This brings up a page with a list of additional priveleges to give to
the member.  The only ones I need are the following two:

Option 4: &quot;Remove members and reset bouncing members&quot;
Option 5: &quot;Ban members&quot;

Then click the button at the bottom that says &quot;Make Moderator&quot;

Simply being a moderator allows you to delete messages, and the
additional 2 priveleges would allow me to remove spammers as members
and also to ban them from signing up for the group again under the
same name.

Please let me help you clean up spam on this group.  I check this

          <div class="email-content">If the moderators never respond or take action, perhaps we could 
start a new BLD group under a slightly different name.  We could 
notify everyone and those who are interested would follow.  (I&#x27;m

rid of the annoying spam)

          <strong>267. Caffeine and BLD</strong><br>
          <em>From:</em> &quot;cmhardw&quot; &lt;foozman17@...&gt;<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been running a sort of informal experiment for some time to find
the effects of caffeine on BLD solving.  This also in a way includes
amount of sleep the night before, and the days before as well.

I&#x27;ve found that most of the time drinking a cup of coffee about an
hour before I do some BLD solves helps me to recall my images better.
 I feel as if I can memorize and the images &quot;stick&quot; with little effort.

This is not always the case though.  I&#x27;ve found sometimes after
drinking a cup of coffee that it is very difficult to get my images to
&quot;stick&quot; when memorizing them, and recall is usually very difficult on
solves like these.  When this happens I usually end up skipping lots
of forgotten images and using pickup cycles to fix them later.

Also, and not surprisingly, the more sleep I have had the night before
the better I do in general.  If I have had a string of days with a lot
of sleep I tend to get my best times, and on these days I attempt my
best records by trying to go insanely break neck fast when I memorize
and solve.

In conclusion, my best days are when I have had a string of days with
a lot of sleep.  If I have a cup of coffee this can sometimes help me
go even faster, but not always.

On days when I have had little sleep, drinking a cup of coffee often
helps, but can occasionally make things even worse.

Just in case anyone was interested.  Obviously with me working at a
coffee shop it&#x27;s easy to drink a cup of coffee most days I am working,
and I try to see how this effects my BLD times when I do.  I have no
empirical evidence to back this up, this is only my observation over a
couple months seeing what happens.

As for official competition solving and caffeine my 8:04.90 4x4 solve
at G-WIZ was done having drank a cup of coffee about 2 hours before
and with a medium to little amount of sleep the night before.  I found
it exceptionally easy to memorize and recall on that solve.  I also
felt like I was almost &quot;overly&quot; caffeinated, my hands were a bit shaky
during that solve and my heart was racing because of the coffee.  My
19:54.63 5x5x5 solve was done with quite a lot of sleep the night
before, and no caffeine at all.  If at a competition I am tired the
morning of I tend to drink a cup of coffee, but if I have slept a lot
I seem to try to avoid the caffeine.  Just another observation I have
made from my competition solves.

By the way, I got the idea to try to use caffeine to enhance memory
after asking around on the memory sports group and this was
recommended to me for the morning of the competition by one or two
people.  This is perfectly allowed in memory sports competitions, and
obviously in Rubik&#x27;s competitions too.

Happy BLD&#x27;ing and if anyone else has had experience with BLD cubing
and caffeine please post.  This could be in practice at home or in
competition.  I&#x27;d be interested to hear your experiences.

          <div class="email-content">Part of the reason that I am not competing for a very long time is due to the fact that I just do horrible.  I sleep a little, work, drive, compete.  After maybe one attempt ... I&#x27;m just burnt out.  I experienced the burnt out feeling in Georgia, oh man that was crazy!  I was going on for over 24 hours before I even started my 5x5 bld, I mean I rested, but no real sleep.  
   
  I experienced it at both Rutgers Competitions.  At Cornell, I jumped in there, this was my best competition as far as &quot;rest&quot; is concerned.  I was in my prime, I had decent sleep and had been up maybe less than 12 hours before attempting my 5x5 bld.  I wasn&#x27;t using caffeine or anything, I just knew that as soon as I got to Cornell, I had to put on the blindfold for that 5x5 attempt, because that is what was important!
   
  I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ve never really seen the effects of caffeine.  I mean I think that it is a mental head game.  I feel that you drink an &quot;energy drink&quot; and I just don&#x27;t feel tired because that is what the prescribed effect is.  If I took sleep seditives, well then I&#x27;d be tired.  Drugs cause chemical reactions in the brain to fool reality.  Caffeine is a legal drug in the Unites States, so nothing is really thought of it ... but seriously is the coffee helping you or is it the fact that you know that coffee has these effects so you&#x27;re knowlege creates the chemical reactions that are favorable.  If you thought that some drug had an unfavorable effect, you wouldn&#x27;t take it, and you wouldn&#x27;t recieve the effects of the drug.  If you want the effects of the drugs, you think you&#x27;ve gotta take it, and you do then you think &quot;oh boy, oh boy, I took the drugs!&quot; and then you help to create the chemical effects.
   
  I may be wrong, so what.  You can agree that you wouldn&#x27;t take something if you didn&#x27;t want the effects, and you wouldn&#x27;t experience the effects of something unless you took it.  
   
  What causes the effects after that is for you to decide.

As for the sleep issue, Leyan did his 1:28.82 after not sleeping for about 30 hours?  I did a 1:27 (with a slight fail) on the same lack of sleep, since we had flown a red-eye to Georgia after working on physics throughout the night.

&quot;stick&quot; when memorizing them, and recall is usually very difficult on 
solves like these. When this happens I usually end up skipping lots
of forgotten images and using pickup cycles to fix them later.

Also, and not surprisingly, the more sleep I have had the night before
the better I do in general. If I have had a string of days with a lot 
of sleep I tend to get my best times, and on these days I attempt my
best records by trying to go insanely break neck fast when I memorize
and solve.

In conclusion, my best days are when I have had a string of days with 
a lot of sleep. If I have a cup of coffee this can sometimes help me
go even faster, but not always.

On days when I have had little sleep, drinking a cup of coffee often
helps, but can occasionally make things even worse. 

Just in case anyone was interested. Obviously with me working at a
coffee shop it&#x27;s easy to drink a cup of coffee most days I am working,
and I try to see how this effects my BLD times when I do. I have no 
empirical evidence to back this up, this is only my observation over a
couple months seeing what happens.

As for official competition solving and caffeine my 8:04.90 4x4 solve
at G-WIZ was done having drank a cup of coffee about 2 hours before 
and with a medium to little amount of sleep the night before. I found
it exceptionally easy to memorize and recall on that solve. I also
felt like I was almost &quot;overly&quot; caffeinated, my hands were a bit shaky 
during that solve and my heart was racing because of the coffee. My
19:54.63 5x5x5 solve was done with quite a lot of sleep the night
before, and no caffeine at all. If at a competition I am tired the
morning of I tend to drink a cup of coffee, but if I have slept a lot 
I seem to try to avoid the caffeine. Just another observation I have
made from my competition solves.

By the way, I got the idea to try to use caffeine to enhance memory
after asking around on the memory sports group and this was 
recommended to me for the morning of the competition by one or two
people. This is perfectly allowed in memory sports competitions, and
obviously in Rubik&#x27;s competitions too.

Happy BLD&#x27;ing and if anyone else has had experience with BLD cubing 
and caffeine please post. This could be in practice at home or in
competition. I&#x27;d be interested to hear your experiences.

How did you observe that without empirical evidence?

What I meant is that I never structured my observations as an actual
experiment.  I suppose my control was my BLD performance when not
caffeinated and my variable was my BLD performance when caffeinated. 
Also I was experimenting on myself and recording my own results, which
means I have skewed results since it&#x27;s frowned upon to do this
scientifically when it can be avoided.

I just know what it feels like to have the effects of caffeine
intoxication, and yes there is such a thing.  Caffeine effects me very
strongly compared to most people.  I&#x27;ve found this just from working
in a coffee shop for a year.  I was nervous because of the solve yes,
but also I could feel some of the effects of caffeine intoxication. 
It&#x27;s hard to describe, and again without any evidence of the level of
caffeine in my blood the only evidence is my perception of how I felt
at the time, which again is flawed because I myself recorded it and
also because of the time that has passed since then, effecting my
recall of the event.

I don&#x27;t drink coffee as often, or in as much quantity, as my post may
suggest.  I just found that when I do drink coffee I find it
interesting to compare my results in BLD cubing to when I have not had
any coffee.

This wasn&#x27;t meant as a super serious post, just as a fun/somewhat
interesting observation.  I got the idea when a few memory sports
competitors said they drink coffee the morning of a competition for
the purpose of using it to enhance memory.

As to Daniel&#x27;s post I agree there is probably quite a bit of &quot;placebo&quot;
effect going on when you BLD with a cup of coffee.  However it has
been proven that caffeine does increase concentration and short term
memory over subjects who have not had caffeine.  So there is placebo
effect yes, but also it really has been proven to help improve
concentration.

I&#x27;m not saying that I &quot;have to have&quot; coffee before I compete, and I
don&#x27;t drink 64 ounces of coffee a day.  I just find it interesting to
see if this drug really does help improve memory, since it is allowed
in competitions (or not banned is a better way to say it).

Yes maybe this is a bit controversial, but I find it an interesting
topic.  I&#x27;m not implying that I would take aderol or something
ridiculous before I BLD solve, but I guess this does raise the issue
of what if someone does take a prescription, or even illegal, drug to
enhance their performance in a competition, for BLD or otherwise?

Since we&#x27;re just dealing with email, the technique is similar to that
of the mail archive (http://www.mail-archive.com/) and GMANE
(http://gmane.org/).

There are three programs involved.

The first program receives emails, parses them, extracts the author,
date, subject, and body, and then files the message into a database
indexed by subject.

The second program is a CGI script that accesses the database created
by the first program, and provides the contents of a thread, or
provides the top level listing of all threads, over an HTTP connection
to some client.

The third program is a javascript client. It communicates with the
second program to retrieve message data from the server, and then
renders it inside the webpage by directly manipulating the DOM.

          <div class="email-content">After Stefan released a M2-Tutorial yesterday, I&#x27;ve decided to swich
to M2 since it is a very powerful way to deal with the Edges.
But after all I don&#x27;t want to throw away everything, I&#x27;ve learned so
far. So I consider using my normal Orient, then 3-Cycle style for corners.

I would solve in this order:

Orient Corners
M2 for Edges
3-Cycles for Corners

In case of odd parity I would use this Alg: F2 U F2 M2 F2 U&#x27; F2
It arranges the M slice and swaps the UL and UR Edges. I haven&#x27;t found
a nicer one yet.

Then you can do the corner cycles and solve a 2 swap of corners easily
along with the swapped edges via T-Permutation (N-Perm is also handy
but not needed)
I didn&#x27;t have the time to really try this yet, nor I&#x27;m used to M2. But
I still 

think this is a quite nice way for me.

What do you think?

Here&#x27;s a direct parity fix from Cube Explorer:

F U R2 D B&#x27; D B D2 R2 U F U2 F&#x27; (13f*)

I&#x27;d also consider U2 M&#x27; U2 M followed by the F-perm.

This is another option (kind of awkward):

D2 l (F-perm) l&#x27; D2</div>

end up at DBR because then it&#x27;s where it belongs relative to the 
cross.

In general this works, yes, and my FLU alg is somewhat like that. But 
can you suggest an actual replacement alg that&#x27;s better than mine?

          <div class="email-content">Here are my times too:

Sighted on 4x4x4:
For these solves I solved the centers and corners before hand as a
point of visual reference for the edges.

1:29.28, 1:36.61, 1:10.96, 1:19.25, 1:19.30, (1:37.77), 1:15.82,
1:07.36, 1:19.35, 1:14.27, (59.04), 1:14.85 = 1:18.70

Blindfolded on 4x4x4:
I didn&#x27;t time memorization.  I just memorized, put on the blindfold,
hit the timer and started solving.  I did not solve anything before
hand as a point of referrence during memorization since memorization
normally has everything scrambled.

1:22.93 (1:10.62) 1:55.24 1:44.21 (2:05.11) = 1:40.79

I hope you&#x27;re ok with an average of 5 for the BLD ones, because my
brain was getting tired after that 5th solve and I didn&#x27;t want to
continue :-S

Darn, you beat me every time. Here&#x27;s my 1:29.32 average:

1:26.75 (1:17.83) 1:37.34 1:23.83 1:24.47 1:24.28 1:28.52 1:30.00 
(1:45.18) 1:23.69 1:36.52 1:37.77

That&#x27;s still with the bad cube, though, so I hope to beat you with a 
better one.

That&#x27;s also very interesting, maybe even more, because it&#x27;s the real 
thing and not an exercise that can only provide an indication of how 
good the method is. I&#x27;ll try this, too, but probably only after the 
US Open. Questions:

- Are the first two times so much faster because your brain was still 
fresh, or were those solves easier?

- Do you spend much time thinking and not twisting? How much for 
recall and how much for planning (i.e., what setup moves and cycle 
alg to use)?

I wrote a tutorial about Pochmann&#x27;s method where I elaborate a bit 
more. Reading it should make you understand a little more about it. 
Try it and let me know if it works...

You can find it on www.solvethecube.co.uk -> Tutorials -> go to bottom 
of page and click the blindfold tutorial.

Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Chris,
   
  Others feel the same way as you.  Lesser people may have given up, and just slipped away in the middle of the night.  
   
  You breaking the WR isn&#x27;t enough of a reason to keep you going.
  Being outclassed at home shouldn&#x27;t scare you off.

  It is the love of blindfolded cubing that should keep you cubing.  It is the enjoyment that you get out of taking off a blindfold and seeing the cube solved.  It is the lessons learned from taking off the blindfold and feeling like somebody swapped cubes with you while you were pulling down the blindfold.
   
  I am not sure if Chris Hardwick is back from his vacation, but he&#x27;s feeling overwhelmed by a certain cubist&#x27;s prowess ... yet he&#x27;s come to the realization that he has struck gold ... the lifetime of enjoyment that he and I will have from blindfolded cubing is just enough to keep us going forever even though we&#x27;ll become outclassed by the younger generations, and we are not even that old!
   
  I laugh because in my humble opinion the current Standards of the WR class solvers rely on a lot of chance, and luck.  I don&#x27;t feel that anybody going as fast as some are will be perfect (even if signs show that they have been thus far)
   
  Would it be fair to bluff and proclaim amazing times and win the bld pots for the WCs ... and everybody fall for it when another cubist, who just cubed for the fun of it, and wasn&#x27;t even that competitive ... was always called on his bluff ...

That&#x27;s the thing, I&#x27;m not enjoying it anymore. Perhaps I should move to another event. If I can 
locate another 4x4 (gave to a friend) or 5x5 (broken) I might pick up big cube bld again, and 
I hit sub60 for OH just recently, but for now I think I&#x27;m all BLDed out.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I&#x27;m not a blind-cuber myself. But conceptually those are uquivalent 
to orienting with U/D stickers on D/U faces, yes. You would only be a 
cube-turn off in either case. I guess it depends what algs suit you 
best, or how your brain works;-) Traditionally, orientation has been 
associated with solving into &lt;U,D,F2,R2,B2,L2> subgroup. Solving into 
either of the subgroups &lt;U2,D2,F,R2,B,L2> or &lt;U2,D2,F2,R,B2,L> would 
work the same :-)

For solving into &lt;U,D,F2,R2,B2,L2> either M2/R2(L2) or S2/F2(B2) 
would work. And so on. Go figure ...

the archives here, but there are still a couple of bits I&#x27;m not
totally sure on.

How do I go about swapping 2 corner pieces if there is an odd
permutation? One possible solution would be to do a T-perm followed by
a PLL parity fix, yet not only is this extremely long (and could
easily result in a mistake), but it changes centre orientation so I
would have to leave it till last which wouldn&#x27;t be the best thing to
do seeing as I would like to get the corners out of the way to begin
with. So I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s a better way?

And secondly, how do I go about centre permutation? Do I work out
cycles during memorisation and remember them, or do I memorise the
colour of each centre piece and then decide what to do when solving?
Either way, is there any good way of making sure you cover everything?

I think a good way would be using a N perm to swap (1 3) and (2 4) edges...then F2 B2 and a T perm, then F2 B2 back

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris,

I don&#x27;t know if this works for your memorization method, but one thing
that helped me is to recall the next cycle(s) while executing the
current one.

I memorize using journey locations, and in each location I place 3
images where each image encodes 1 cycle to do using a commutator. 
When I recall a location I try to recall all 3 images at that location
and as I am executing the cycle for the first image I try to recall
which two pieces and also which commutator I would use for the next
cycle.  This leaves, hopefully, no or next to no delay as I move into
the next cycle.

If I cannot recall the next image then I skip it and use a pick-up
cycle to solve it later.  This way I can still continue solving, again
hopefully, without delays even if I am unable to recall everything the
first time through.  In this case while I am executing other cycles I
try to recall that one forgotten image in order to make sure I won&#x27;t
have a very long delay of several minutes before recalling that
forgotten image after the end of the rest of the solve.

Daniel Beyer and I have been throwing ideas around to each other for
big cube BLD for a while now and this is the process we have both
decided on as a way to help speed up execution.  Of course there are
many different methods and many different things to try, but this
works very well for the both of us and I would certainly recommend to
try this approach and see what you think.

I know this depends on your memory method, but try to always recall
the next cycle while executing the current one.  If you don&#x27;t already
use pick-up cycles or blackhole cycling (yes these are 2 different
things) to aid when you forget a cycle then I would highly recommend
learning about them.  I don&#x27;t know if there is a resource on the
internet that describes blackhole cycling, but if you can&#x27;t find one
just ask and either Daniel and I will describe it.  It is another
useful tool to aid in what to do when you forget a cycle.

Hope this helps, and glad to see you back on the BLD scene!  I for one
was really hoping you wouldn&#x27;t put it down completely!

          <div class="email-content">Chris,
   
  You forget an image.  So you can no longer cycle out of the location that you were cycling from.  An efficient way to continue solving (counting the number of executions made) is to do begin cycling from a different location.
   
  If I get this string of letters
   
  AKDMLXJFWANO
   
  Akuma (Street Fighters)
  Dungeon Master (Dungeons and Dragons)
  Lex Luthor
  Jafar (Aladdin)
  War Machine (Ironman)
  Gnomes
   
  If I forget Lex Luthor and I could recall the rest.
   
  I would then cycle out of the F location of Jafar.  Which will suck everything up the the point of the memory blank, like a blackhole.  Once you recall LX, you&#x27;d solve LX and then the image after, Jafar.  And it&#x27;ll all be solved.
   
  Pick up cycles (Cycling the pieces  (Q->J->F) when forgetting LX)
   
  It costs you an alg, but you can continue cycling out of the same location over and over, which allows your cycles to become very fast because they are familiar.

  Daniel Beyer

          <div class="email-content">This post/question is for anyone who solves by solving orientation and
position at the same time.

I have to ask how you would handle solving an odd permutation that has
&quot;unbalanced&quot; orientation.  I define unbalanced orientation within a
cycle/permutation to be the state when switching the piece in your
buffer to its correct location will return the correct buffer
location&#x27;s piece to the buffer, but with the incorrect orientation.

Here is an example sticker cycle for the corners of the solve I just
had on my 3x3x3:

The first letter of each three letter combination indicates the
sticker I am targeting for that piece:

UBL->RUF->URB->RFD->FLD->DLB->DBR->LBD->ULF->LFU

I solve using three cycles so I did the cycles:
1) UBL->RUF->URB
2) UBL->RFD->FLD
3) UBL->DLB->DBR
4) UBL->LBD->ULF
5) (UBL&lt;->LFU)

I could have chosen to memorize like this though:
UBL->RUF->URB->RFD->FLD->DLB->DBR->LBD and also the additional fact
that the ULF corner needs to rotate counterclockwise.

How do you sticker cycle folks handle the memorization of a case like
this?  I guess the problem doesn&#x27;t really occur when you solve with 2
cycles using stickers?  If it does forgive my ignorance, but
regardless for this case it is hard for me to decide how to memorize
when solving using three cycles.

          <div class="email-content">Chris, when I started blindsolving, it used to take me about 9-15 minutes also to do the whole thing. But one month later, without too much practise (like doing it 4 or 5 times a day), I could reach less than 7. I imagine that it will keep decreasing because I´m getting more and more used to memorize the cube.

My execution was very slow also, but then I have been learning how to do some set up moves that happen always and then you will improving day by day. What helps a lot is to learn some more algorithmics when you feel some movements are too slow.

So: BE PATIENT! And keep practising!!

          <div class="email-content">my method for memorizing is real easy in 1 week i switched my time
from 5 minutes from a constant time now of 3 minutes... what i do is
each piece has a football player assigned for example... edge 1 is
ronladinho edge 2 is robinho and so on and so forth by that way i will
only make a story of a football game.. for example if edge1 goes to
edge 2  i will make a story like ronaldinho passes it to robinho then
passed to figo then shot a goal and cassilas makes a save.. that&#x27;s how
i do it makes me real fast at BLD... thanks for reading...and one more
thing... u can assign by ur own style.. but remember make a piece
assignment with the ones u r really addicted for me its football... thanks</div>

I kicked off another round, but with a slight difference this time:
The 3x3x3 format is the same as before, but the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5
challenges will now be every two weeks rather than every week. The
reason is that big cubes seem to be too exhausting to do every week,
and the competitors may need a longer rest between challenges to keep
going.

I&#x27;m not sure about R2, because I haven&#x27;t learned it yet.  The whole concept of M2 is to use the 
&quot;algorithm&quot; M2 to switch 2 pieces, FD and BU.  You use FD as your buffer (I use FD like Erik, 
but Pochmann uses DF) and use set-ups to move the edges into the BU slot.  Taking the first 
algorithm from erik&#x27;s site, If you were to have The colors LU in the FD spot, you would apply 
LU&#x27;L&#x27;U to put it into the BU slot.  Then you would do the &quot;algorithm&quot; M2 and then undo the 
set-up moves.  The only time this gets tricky is when you have to deal with M slice edges.  
The other edges I pretty much figured out intuitively and learned the  M slice algorithms.  
The key thing to remember is that the centers get displaced with each M2 you do.  If you 
have an odd number of edges to move out, you end up having to apply a parity fix that 
switches UB and UL along with the centers, restoring you&#x27;re cube to normal orientation.  This 
works great if you&#x27;re using pochmann&#x27;s old method for the corners (I do...).  R2 is pretty 
much the same, thing, except there are more bad cases to worry about.  I never bothered 
learning it, and now I&#x27;m going to start working on TuRBo corners.</div>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

At the World Championships I had several people ask me about my corner
method when they saw me BLD cubing.  I use commutator freestyle
cycling to solve the position and orientation of 2 pieces at a time. 
Unlike Turbo though I try to ban setup turns as much as I possibly
can.  Of course this is not completely possible, but my worst cases
require 2 setup turns only, and almost all cases that require a setup
turn can be done in 1 setup turn.  Often I don&#x27;t need any setup turns.

Ok here are the algorithms I use, and what I call them.  If you notice
these are pretty much the exact same algorithms as I use in big cube
BLD.  Also you&#x27;ll notice that the names *are* the exact same names
that Daniel Beyer and I use for the similar cycle on the bigger cubes
BLD for centers.

I try to treat the corners of the 3x3x3 like the X-centers on the
5x5x5 cube.  This doesn&#x27;t work exactly the same way, but it&#x27;s close
enough for most of the cases.

My buffer is UBL (the U sticker of the UBL corner) and do cycles all
over the cube, from all angles.  Just like Pochmann and Turbo you need
to sometimes break into other cycles, etc..

Here are some of the algs I use, and their names.  In the notation I
am using, a turn done in brackets means that you can replace it with
any other turn of the same layer.  The second turn in brackets *must*
be the inverse turn of the first turn in brackets.  You&#x27;ll see what I
mean after the first example.

-----------------------
Easy no-setup-moves cases

&quot;Toss-up&quot; : R U2 R&#x27; [D] R U2 R&#x27; [D&#x27;]
again the brackets mean that I can also do: R U2 R&#x27; D&#x27; R U2 R&#x27; D; or R
U2 R&#x27; D2 R U2 R&#x27; D2.  These algs are all 3 &quot;toss-up&quot; cases.

&quot;Drop-and-catch&quot; : R&#x27; D R U R&#x27; D&#x27; R U&#x27;
You can also use R&#x27; D2 R U R&#x27; D2 R U&#x27;; R&#x27; D R U2 R&#x27; D&#x27; R U2; R&#x27; D2 R
U2 R&#x27; D2 R U2; etc.

&quot;Direct-Insert&quot; : R&#x27; D&#x27; R [U] R&#x27; D R [U&#x27;]

&quot;Caltech-move&quot; (I don&#x27;t know who deserves full credit for this move,
so I call it Caltech-move because I learned it from the Caltech crew)
: (R F&#x27; R&#x27; F)*3 U2 (R F&#x27; R&#x27; F)*3 U2

&quot;Pure 3-cycle&quot; (this is the pure form of the standard Fridrich
3-corner cycle) :
B2 R F R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R&#x27;
This move should be able to be done from all angles and on all sides.
 As an example I would do F2 L&#x27; B&#x27; L F2 L&#x27; B L; L2 F&#x27; R&#x27; F L2 F&#x27; R F; etc.

&quot;Ferris-Wheel&quot; : D&#x27; R&#x27; U R D&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R D2

-----------------------
medium 1-setup-move-cases

The case name is the name of the case from the above group that you
can setup into.

&quot;Toss-up&quot; cases:
1) F&#x27; R U2 R&#x27; D2 R U2 R&#x27; D2 F

&quot;Drop-and-catch&quot; cases:
1) R R D&#x27; R&#x27; U R D R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; combines to R2 D&#x27; R&#x27; U R D R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27;
This can also be considered a &quot;toss-up&quot; case if you view the first
setup move as R2.  So again you have some freedom here to setup into
different cases if you prefer one over the other.
2) F&#x27; L&#x27; D L U L&#x27; D&#x27; L U&#x27; F
3) R&#x27; U2 F D&#x27; F&#x27; U2 F D F&#x27; R
4) etc..

Ferris wheel cases:
1) F&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; U R D&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R D2 F

Pure 3-cycle cases:
1) U&#x27; B2 R F R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R&#x27; U

Direct-Insert Cases:
1) F2 L&#x27; D&#x27; L U L&#x27; D L U&#x27; F2

hard 1 move setup cases:
-------------------------

Change of viewpoint case 1:
UBL->BUR->RDB

At first this cycle looks very difficult to use setup moves.  But if
you change your view point to be BLU->URB->DBR suddenly this is an
easy Caltech move case.

1) L U2 (R&#x27; B R B&#x27;)*3 U2 (R&#x27; B R B&#x27;)*3 L&#x27;

Change of viewpoint case 2:
UBL->BUR->RUF

Again this looks like a hard case where you need 2 setup moves.  But
actually you just need to change your viewpoint to be BLU->URB->UFR in
which case it&#x27;s just 1 setup turn and a 3 cycle.

1) L&#x27; B2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R B2 R&#x27; F R L

2 setup move cases:
--------------------
UBL->RBU->BRD

1) R&#x27; F R2 B L B&#x27; R2 B L&#x27; B&#x27; F&#x27; R

----------------
EXAMPLE SOLVE
----------------

I&#x27;ve already provided a couple example solves of this approach, I
think one on this forum and one on the blindfold solving forum.  But
for clarity here is one more.  Scramble the cube in the orientation
where you would normally blindfold solve.

F B&#x27; L2 U F2 R2 F2 L&#x27; F2 D2 L2 F2 U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R2 B2 R U2 B2 L&#x27; D2 U2 B L

Again my buffer is UBL

1) UBL->FUL->DFL
1 setup move into a &quot;Drop-and-catch&quot;
F2 U2 L&#x27; D2 L U2 L&#x27; D2 L F2

2) UBL->LBD->DBR
1 setup move into a &quot;Drop-and-catch&quot;
R2 F D2 F&#x27; U2 F D2 F&#x27; U2 R2

3) Here we have to break into another cycle.  I would do
UBL->URB->RFD &quot;Drop-and-Catch&quot;
B D2 B&#x27; U&#x27; B D2 B&#x27; U

4) UBL->UFR->RBU
1 setup move into a &quot;drop-and-catch&quot;
F F L2 F&#x27; R2 F L2 F&#x27; R2 F&#x27; which combines to F2 L2 F&#x27; R2 F L2 F&#x27; R2 F&#x27;
This is a drop and catch on the R face.  Again you need to be able to
do these on other faces as well as the U face.

Corners are solved.

--------------------
Advantages to this method:

Solving is incredibly quick.  Racing Stefan Pochmann and Joey Gouly
with sighted BLD method solves at RWC2007 I got a 15 second solve, and
lots of ones around 20-25 seconds.  I think a super-fast solve might
be about 10-15 seconds and a super slow solve might take 30-40 seconds
to give an idea of a range for this method for solving corners.

Move count is very low, so you&#x27;re less likely to mess up assuming you
can correctly &quot;see&quot; which cycle you have, which like big cube BLD just
takes practice.  For the solve above it took 37 moves to solve corners
counting move cancelations (which I actually do perform).

Because all algs are commutators you can use this method on big cubes
for BLD, which because of the low turn count is extraordinarily fast.
 This is actually why I started with this method, but eventually it
got to be fast enough that I was overtaking my 3x3x3 BLD times using
it rather than orient first and permute.

---------------------
Disadvantages to this method:

Sometimes I find it hard to memorize very quickly, especially if you
have a lot of corners that are correctly permuted, but twisted.  Also
having a lot of 2 cycles can slow me down too.  I memorize with images
so perhaps this is just a fault of memorizing with images rather than
visually.  I can memorize the entire cube with images using about
40-45 seconds at my very fastest and 1:10-1:20 at my very slowest to
give an idea of the range.

When just getting started it is sometimes hard to tell which corner
cycle you have, but the more you practice the easier this gets.  Also
if you practice big cube BLD you get pretty much the exact same cycles
on 5x5 BLD for X-centers, at least for the most part.  It is not a
perfect match, but X-centers on 5x5 is excellent practice for 3x3 corners.

-------------

Ok that&#x27;s about it.  I&#x27;m not saying this method is better than other
methods that are out there, I just think it is a different way to
approach it.  And because I know people don&#x27;t like methods unless they
are proven in competition I used this method for corners, and a
similar one for edges, at RWC2007 and came in 5th place for 3x3 BLD. 
My fastest competition solve using this method, and the similar one
for edges, was 1:49.84.  If I could only improve my memorization of
this method I think I could get faster.  My personal record with this
method at home is 1:19.xx

If you have any questions about particular cycles or setup moves, just
post here and I&#x27;ll tell you what I do.

Also I noticed that Stefan using M2 was always faster than my method
with commutator 3 cycles for edges.  I&#x27;m going to try to practice my
commutators and see if I can improve my speed.  If not I will most
likely switch to M2 for edges, or maybe Turbo.  But for corners I like
my method ;-)

I tried it sometimes, but got some hard cases :P

One thing I didn&#x27;t understand is where you say:

&quot;Drop-and-catch&quot; : R&#x27; D R U R&#x27; D&#x27; R U&#x27;
 You can also use R&#x27; D2 R U R&#x27; D2 R U&#x27;; R&#x27; D R U2 R&#x27; D&#x27; R U2; R&#x27; D2 R
 U2 R&#x27; D2 R U2; etc.
 
 &quot;Direct-Insert&quot; : R&#x27; D&#x27; R [U] R&#x27; D R [U&#x27;]&quot;

I don&#x27;t see why these 2 are different...looks the same &quot;type&quot;...for me, at least : )

 Corners are solved.
 
 --------------------
 Advantages to this method:
 
 Solving is incredibly quick.  Racing Stefan Pochmann and Joey Gouly
 with sighted BLD method solves at RWC2007 I got a 15 second solve, and
 lots of ones around 20-25 seconds.  I think a super-fast solve might
 be about 10-15 seconds and a super slow solve might take 30-40 seconds
 to give an idea of a range for this method for solving corners.
 
 Move count is very low, so you&#x27;re less likely to mess up assuming you
 can correctly &quot;see&quot; which cycle you have, which like big cube BLD just
 takes practice.  For the solve above it took 37 moves to solve corners
 counting move cancelations (which I actually do perform).
 
 Because all algs are commutators you can use this method on big cubes
 for BLD, which because of the low turn count is extraordinarily fast.
  This is actually why I started with this method, but eventually it
 got to be fast enough that I was overtaking my 3x3x3 BLD times using
 it rather than orient first and permute.
 
 ---------------------
 Disadvantages to this method:
 
 Sometimes I find it hard to memorize very quickly, especially if you
 have a lot of corners that are correctly permuted, but twisted.  Also
 having a lot of 2 cycles can slow me down too.  I memorize with images
 so perhaps this is just a fault of memorizing with images rather than
 visually.  I can memorize the entire cube with images using about
 40-45 seconds at my very fastest and 1:10-1:20 at my very slowest to
 give an idea of the range.
 
 When just getting started it is sometimes hard to tell which corner
 cycle you have, but the more you practice the easier this gets.  Also
 if you practice big cube BLD you get pretty much the exact same cycles
 on 5x5 BLD for X-centers, at least for the most part.  It is not a
 perfect match, but X-centers on 5x5 is excellent practice for 3x3 corners.
 
 -------------
 
 Ok that&#x27;s about it.  I&#x27;m not saying this method is better than other
 methods that are out there, I just think it is a different way to
 approach it.  And because I know people don&#x27;t like methods unless they
 are proven in competition I used this method for corners, and a
 similar one for edges, at RWC2007 and came in 5th place for 3x3 BLD. 
 My fastest competition solve using this method, and the similar one
 for edges, was 1:49.84.  If I could only improve my memorization of
 this method I think I could get faster.  My personal record with this
 method at home is 1:19.xx
 
 If you have any questions about particular cycles or setup moves, just
 post here and I&#x27;ll tell you what I do.
 
 Also I noticed that Stefan using M2 was always faster than my method
 with commutator 3 cycles for edges.  I&#x27;m going to try to practice my
 commutators and see if I can improve my speed.  If not I will most
 likely switch to M2 for edges, or maybe Turbo.  But for corners I like
 my method ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

I was just playing around with some moves today, and I found this alg 
for flipping the 4 edges in the E layer:

The pure commutator is:

[(RUR&#x27;F&#x27;)*3 , E2]

But since RUR&#x27;F&#x27; has order 6, you can also do (RUR&#x27;F&#x27;)*3 E2 (RUR&#x27;F&#x27;)*3 
E2. Both are quite easy to execute.

          <div class="email-content">At the world competition I was racing Stefan and Joey Gouly using our
sighted blindfolded systems.  Also I know that a lot of people are
switching to M2 for edges and R2 for corners.  I have been trying to
work on my commutator method to get it faster, but I have a feeling
that M2 might be faster for edges.  I still believe in my corner
commutators, though I am keeping an open mind about switching to R2 if
my method seems to be slower.

In the interest of friendly competition I did some sighted solves with
my blindfolded method, as well as some timed solves while blindfolded.
 For the sighted solves I inspected the cube for 5 seconds or so
before I started.  For the blindfolded solves I memorized without the
timer, so I probably went a little slower than in a real solve, but I
still tried to go relatively quickly to make it fairly realistic.

I timed each phase of the solution as well.  For solves where I had
parity the time for edges and for corners represents how long it took
me down to leaving the last 2 pieces that have to swap.  I timed how
long it took me to execute the parity fix too.

Sighted solves:
---------------
edges / corners / parity (if applicable)
1) 25.29 / 24.24 / 8.64
2) 29.03 / 17.62 / 7.83
3) 26.30 / 23.19 / 10.70
4) 24.92 / 26.86 / 7.55
5) 25.89 / 25.14 / 8.47
6) 32.27 / 18.71 / ---
7) 29.99 / 14.06 / 4.98
8) 24.89 / 18.42 / ---
9) 31.12 / 16.10 / 12.03
10) 25.32 / 25.63 / 5.83
11) 33.69 / 16.51 / ---
12) 29.16 / 16.36 / ---

Edges average: 27.93
Corners average: 20.19
parity setup and execution (when applicable): 8.25

Blindfolded solves:
-------------------
edges / corners / parity (if applicable)
1) 26.28 / 17.87 / 13.70
2) 22.95 / 17.40 / ---
3) 23.62 / 22.59 / 10.75
4) 24.79 / 30.94 (corners and parity together) / see previous entry

For the 4th solve I forgot to hit the spacebar after solving corners
down to the last 2, and I just went straight into the parity execution.

I can do more blindfolded solves, but right now it&#x27;s late and I am
getting tired.  I just wanted to have a comparison to sighted and
actually blindfolded for at least a few tries.

Please if any of you M2 or R2 users are interested post your times as
well.  I&#x27;m curious which method is faster for each piece type, or if
one method is better overall.

I think it would be much easier to just memorize and solve as if it 
were a full blown 3x3x3 BLD solve, only every step will be 
significantly reduced.

Also, what is this for?  Why would solving it with a standard blindfold 
method defeat the purpose?

          <div class="email-content">Hi,
I dont think there is a point in solving one layer BLD.Because if at
all you want to show how a BLD works you need to make people
understand that  edges and corners are fixed separately.More over
doing one layer gives the wrong impression that even BLD is done LBL.
So I would suggest orienting and permuting all the corners or
edges.That would be a &quot;fairly solved cube&quot;.That might probably be a
quick way.

Hi!

Well.. Reading a few different sections on some websites might be 
useful. You&#x27;ll learn more about it, for sure.

Here my bld tutorial, also includes links to other bld sections on 
other websites:

          <strong>382. Caffeine and BLD cubing</strong><br>
          <em>From:</em> &quot;cmhardw&quot; &lt;foozman17@...&gt;<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

I&#x27;ve posted on my &quot;armchair&quot; caffeine and BLD cubing experiment
before.  I recently have tried to drastically reduce my caffeine
intake, as I feel I am drinking too much.  On a typical day for me I
would drink a red bull in the morning and 2-3 soft drinks throughout
the day.  Often I would replace the red bull with a 20 oz. cup of
coffee, but I never drank red bull and coffee on the same day.  I&#x27;m
very sensitive to caffeine, so for me that is quite a bit and I often
felt very caffeinated throughout the day.

I&#x27;ve now been caffeine free for 2 full weeks, ignoring the small
amount of caffeine that can be found in chocolate.  I went through a
period of withdrawal symptoms for the first 2-3 days with headaches
during the day and some nausea from time to time, usually in the
evenings.   Now I feel back to normal, and I like it much better
without caffeine.

I just wanted to report that I like the feeling of memorizing without
caffeine to be honest.  I don&#x27;t feel as easily distracted when
memorizing without having had caffeine.  Also, even when I am actually
memorizing at a fairly quick rate, for me, I don&#x27;t feel as hurried as
I did when I was on caffeine.

Anyway this experiment was not done in any sort of scientific manner,
and is strictly an armchair, for fun experiment.

Personally I feel it is a bit easier to memorize without any caffeine
in your system rather than with quite a bit of caffeine and feeling
very hyper and very caffeinated.

This assumes a relatively good night&#x27;s sleep on days when I had a lot
of caffeine and on days when I didn&#x27;t have a lot of caffeine.  On days
when I haven&#x27;t slept much I almost always find it difficult to keep my
focus when memorizing, whether I&#x27;ve had caffeine or not.

In case anyone is interested,

Can anyone tell me the best way to get familiar with the algorithms

I&#x27;m learning the M2 R2 system and I&#x27;ve a question about memorization:

when you enter in a new cycle how do you remember the place where 
you can still shoot pieces?

I mean: when I have to enter in a new cycle (because the buffer 
piece come back in the buffer position) I have to store the piece 
wich would be in the buffer place in a provvisory wrong place so 
that I can begin a new cycle. But How do you remember wich place are 
still free? (how can you remember wich place has the right piece and 
wich place has to be still memorized) I can&#x27;t undestand that.

Hope you get the Idea of what I mean. 

Sorry for by bad english.

          <div class="email-content">Hi folks,

I just wanted to introduce myself to the group, as I expect I may be utilizing it in the near future. Today I completed my first successful blindsolve using Bill McGaugh&#x27;s method. . . I messed up the first 3-4 times, but then completed it successfully with 4 minutes 50s (execution only). 

Anyways, I&#x27;ve been speedcubing for almost exactly 2 years (average around 30 seconds w/ 3LLL fridrich) and am now excited to try something new. Some of you may have heard me occasionally on the speedcubing yahoo group.

After I practice up a little bit and get more comfortable, I will probably modify it a little bit or try to use a more advanced method. . . my current goal, of course, is to have a higher success rate, but ultimately I hope I can get my averages down to about 5 minutes.

I&#x27;m excited to be blindsolving and can&#x27;t wait to start learning new things and communicating with you folks.

Take care,

--David

Yeah if you ever have any questions always feel free to post.  As to 
improving your accuracy and speed, especially in the beginning, all 
you have to do is practice somewhat regularly.  Once you get your 
brain used to thinking extra hard like you need to for a blindsolve 
your times will come down without doing anything different.  Bill 
McGaugh&#x27;s method should be plenty good enough to get an average of 5 
minutes, so don&#x27;t worry about learning advanced stuff right now 
unless you are just interested to do so.

Congrats again!

Chris just wrote in a previous post:
&quot;Once you get your brain used to thinking extra hard like you need to 
for a blindsolve your times will come down without doing anything 
different.&quot;

I have to say that now, after 1 year since I started BLD cubing (though 
I did not exactly practice everyday), I can feel the difference in 
terms of effort and headaches with the beginning. (now it&#x27;s 
just &quot;natural&quot;, nothing special)

But since the brain can get used to &quot;think extra hard&quot; thanks to BLD 
cubing, has it proven useful for other purposes ?
As for me, I cannot think of any example.

Any thoughts about this ?

I still can&#x27;t solve my cube blindfolded, but I guess it&#x27;s just a
matter of time and practice.
One question for Chris: Do you think the &quot;cubefreak&quot; method is good as
a beginner method for BLD ?

Thanks in advance,

 I&#x27;m trying to learn the method described on cubefreak website, it&#x27;s
 quite interesting.

so, if I have, for example, UF -> BR -> LB, I&#x27;d do something like

another one
UF -> DR -> FD
U R2 M&#x27; (cycle) M R2 U&#x27;

hope that helps

I updated my page to include my letter pair words list as well. I have
included all words including my extension to edges. I would be very
interested in hearing if anyone finds this method useful.

I still think memorizing this way has enormous potential, but so far
after more practice solves I am leaning very strongly towards using
this method for 3x3 corners and using letter pair images and journeys
for 3x3 edges. The hybrid method seems to take less mental effort in
terms of avoiding memorization interference, and I have still achieved
some fast sub-1:30 solves using the hybrid method already.

Let me know what you think,

Hey Gilles,

I don&#x27;t think this directly relates to your question, but I think BLD 
cubing has bled over into my real life in one aspect at least.  I use 
my journeys sometimes to help me remember things I have to do during 
the day, tasks I have to complete at work for the day as one 
example.  I will place one task in each journey location, and try to 
give it some sort of visual representation.  Like if I have to send 
an e-mail to somebody I picture that person and a computer next to 
them, or something silly like that.

I find this helps me remember, especially if I am being given tasks 
verbally from my boss and I don&#x27;t have anything to write them down on.

There are probably better methods for doing this if you ask a memory 
master, but I find my journeys useful in this sense outside of BLD 
cubing.  I don&#x27;t think this is me getting used to &quot;thinking extra 
hard&quot; but rather thinking &quot;differently&quot; about how to remember my 
tasks for the day.

Just a thought, as it seemed to relate at least a little to your 
question.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been out of the loop for a while.  And I&#x27;m
certainly an amateur with blindfold (though I did try
very hard to do well with it at one point)

Before blindfold cubing I was very much into blindfold
chess.  After blindfold cubing for a couple of months,
I noticed my visualization was substantially easier
for bld chess!

It has a lot to do with the thinking extra hard
mindset perhaps.  Prior to bld cubing I had to break
the board into quadrants (I was not well enough to see
the entire board).  Now I see the board perfectly in
whole.

Thank you bld cubing!
