        Hi all! Anybody still living in this group? ;-) I just heard of it and
        was pointed to this post of Richard&#x27;s method. Question: Is he
        really using this many algorithms? I remember him writing somewhere that
        he doesn&#x27;t do it for speed. But then why so many algs? Btw, stage 3
        seems to be missing... I was surprised to read &quot;Finishing the
        middle layer&quot; after just orientation algs :-) Also, how do the
        other top guys memorize/solve? Cheers! Stefan (who recently began

        Hi Stefan, Yup, I&#x27;m alive. lol answer to your q: Dr. C does not use
        all those algs, just suggested that more algorithms could be used for
        blindfold cubing, and came up with that list. I&#x27;ve memorized some
        of the useful ones (especially edge orientation alg.), but I feel that
        BCFSSS (Blindfold cubing for seriously sad savants - a work in progress
        by Dr. C) is a little too much for me, at least for now. Maybe I&#x27;ll
        try it in the summer... My method is basically the same as the method on
        stiff_hands&#x27; page, i.e. I memorize permutation in cycles. For
        orientation, I don&#x27;t use any numbers, but take a mental picture of
        the blue/white stickers (my U and D...japanese color scheme) For
        solving, I start with corner orientation (since this is the hardest part
        for me), then edge orientation. Then I move on to permutation, but this
        is done in a totally random manner. (for example, I stop in the middle
        of permuting the edges and use some PLL algs to move around corners and
        edges at the same time, then go back to solving corners and edges
        separately) i sure hope that makes sense. :D Macky --- In

      <strong>4. Corner orientation the skewed way...</strong><br />

        I thought about orienting the ULF, URB, DLB and DRF corners with one
        algorithm and then the other four corners with another algorithm. That
        is, assuming those two groups can be oriented independently (each sums
        up to a multiple of 3). If not, one more preparation alg can make it so.
        The nice thing is that you need only very few algorithms and before and
        after applying one of them you only need to turn the cube as a whole, no
        &quot;real&quot; moves are necessary. There are only four sets of
        orientations: - { 0, 0, 0, 0 } - { 0, 0, 1, 2 } - { 0, 1, 1, 1 } - { 0,
        2, 2, 2 } - { 1, 1, 2, 2 } You can always turn the whole cube so that
        the smallest of those numbers is at ULF, the second smallest at URB, the
        third smallest at DLB and the largest at DRF. Then apply one of only
        four (three without inversion) algorithms. Did someone try this before?

        I do this a lot on 2x2x2... well, kind of. What I do is first I use an
        alg to get corners in their correct layer (U/D) and the corners of each
        layer solvable (sums up to 3k), and then use CLL to solve each layer. If
        you can read the first part really fast, there&#x27;s almost nothing to
        remember and only 3 algs to do, which means lots of time saved for you.
        :D I use this method only when I can do what I wrote in the last
        sentence, and if not, just stick to the usual stiff_hands&#x27; style.

        It would be sort of like the Sunday contest only for blindfolded solves.
        Does something like this already exist and I just don&#x27;t know about
        it? If one doesn&#x27;t exist, and there is interest, then I would like
        to start one on my site to take place every Sunday. Feedback would be

        Hi Chris, I would definately participate - though I may miss out an
        occasional week if I get too busy. I rarely time myself so it would make
        for a great incentive for me to actually become more efficient on the
        memorization aspect. I don&#x27;t find the memorization hard at all -
        but perhaps that&#x27;s because I am quite meticulous about it. How well
        woud it sink in if I were just to give it a quick glance??? As for
        thoughts on the contest structure: - I think it would be nice if we
        could have a couple of scramble algs. This would allow people to go slow
        and steady in order to be able to enter a time, but also to open the
        floodgates and try to maximize speed with the remaining scrambles. -
        what would the &#x27;turn around&#x27; time be? i.e. how many days after
        the scrambles are posted would we have before we would have to submit
        our times? CONGRATS on blindfolding the Super4!! Very cool! Rob --- In

        solve first the corner or edges or a layer, solve position or

        I can blindfold solve the cube consistently anywhere from 5 to 20
        minutes depending on the status of the cube, including memorization.
        However, when you have the parity error, it screws me up quite horribly.
        Any way to get rid of that error from the start, and how much more

        Hi all, I wondered what you think about this: Imagine you&#x27;re trying
        to solve a harder puzzle blindfolded, which will take you let&#x27;s say
        much more than an hour. Would you consider it cheating to ask someone to
        check a certain subgoal? I wouldn&#x27;t let him/her touch the puzzle,
        only look and tell me &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. If the answer
        is &quot;no&quot; then I&#x27;d immediately count that attempt as DNF,
        though sometimes I might finish it just for learning/training purposes.
        But if I feel I don&#x27;t want to waste time on an already flawed
        solve, then this could save me some time. So, what do you think? Cheers!

        Hey everyone, the Sunday BD contest algs are posted for this sunday. I
        also made a few rules changes (thanks to everyone for all the feedback).
        I hope everyone who participated in the last contest was satisfied with
        how the contest is set up. If not, please let me know what you
        didn&#x27;t like so we can try to make this competition as fair, and as
        fun, as possible. Basically the rule changes cleared up that in the open
        division, you have to declare a solve as official before you scramble
        the puzzle (assuming you are BD solving a sequential movement puzzle).
        Also I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m going to make the Division I and
        Division II categories as close to official competitions as possible, so
        the first rule for each is now that no note taking or help of any kind
        (other than just brainpower) is allowed to help memorize the cube. You
        of course have total free rein in the open division. You can create the
        &quot;3x3x3 with the aid of notes to help memorize category&quot; So
        feel free to be as creative as possible with the open division. Just
        remember you still are required to wear a blindfold of some type :)
        Thanks to everyone for the feedback, and I hope you guys liked the
        competition. If you didn&#x27;t participate last time feel free to give
        it a shot! It&#x27;s a lot of fun! If you did participate last week I
        hope to see you on the lists again :) Good luck to everyone this week!

        be abused, but as long as you are truly verifying that you are where you
        think you are, and not attempting to figure out where you actually are
        (therefore actually cheating, not checking), then I think that should be
        acceptable. Unnofficial attempts are all on your honor, anyways, so
        there&#x27;s not much point in checking with someone else, if your just
        going to cheat ;-) An idea like this could even be useful in official
        competition situations to shorten failed attempts. I don&#x27;t know,
        though - it may be too hard to make sure the competitor isn&#x27;t
        actually cheating. I suppose that limiting it to &quot;yes&quot; or
        pre-determined answers might do the trick - the competitor must ask
        questions that are answered yes, or provide ahead of time the answer
        they expect. Anyways, You just have to make sure that the person doing
        the checking answers your questions directly without giving anything
        else away about the state of the puzzle. I mean, who wants to keep going
        for another couple hours if you know you already messed up after just 15
        minutes to an hour, aside from learning/practice, of course. Even worse,
        who wants to be a couple hours into a solve, be where they think they
        are, and then have a checker reveal too much about the puzzle&#x27;s
        state? - Grant

        also be acceptable to hold the cube behind/under a non-transparent
        object, such as a desk or table, thereby obstructing the object, rather
        than the eyes. It seems reasonable, to me, to assume that someone may
        have some free time to blow and not be carrying something with them that
        they can use as a blindfold. For example, I think back to when someone
        solved a cube under the sheet while getting their hair cut - was that
        Richard? If I ever get to the point of being able to do this more
        quickly (see the other post I&#x27;ll send shortly), I&#x27;d like to be
        able to try this during lunch at work, one day, without having to plan
        ahead and make sure I have something there with which to blindfold
        myself. What think ye? - Grant

      <div class="email-content">
        I don&#x27;t think the way I had in mind makes cheating possible. I
        meant questions like: - Are all edges oriented correctly now? - Are all
        corners permuted correctly now? - Is yellow center on top? (e.g. for odd
        cubes or Megaminx) This of course needs proper instructions given to the
        checking person in advance. The person needs to know 100% what he/she
        has to do and is only allowed to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.
        If yes, you&#x27;re allowed to go on and if no, your attempt is
        immediately invalid. If the checker needs to ask for a clarification
        then things have gone wrong already. I just thought about exploiting it
        at the end or near the end or at/near the end of subgoals, but I
        can&#x27;t think of a working example. Can you give a specific example?
        I think instead of asking you could always just assume the answer would
        be &quot;yes&quot; and act accordingly. Hmm, maybe you can gain
        information by the time it takes the checker to answer the question. For
        example, if you want to know whether you already did that damn final U
        turn or not, you could ask &quot;can the cube be solved only turning U?
        If it&#x27;s already solved then the checker might say &quot;yes&quot;
        faster than if it&#x27;s not. This problem could be solved by fixing the
        questions in advance together with a time you&#x27;ll have to wait for
        the answer. Or you could gain information by where he&#x27;s walking
        around you to look at other sides. Or which sides he asks you to show
        him (which should be forbidden. Only &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;
        are the only things he&#x27;s allowed to say). This could be solved by
        fixing a route around the solver for each question as well ;-) However,
        I really only intended this for honest checks. I hope this won&#x27;t be
        exploited in private attempts and like you, I think it could be useful
        (also for official contests). And in case you&#x27;re wondering: I
        didn&#x27;t use this for the Megaminx. That was standard blindsolving,
        also without taking notes and with wearing a real blindfold. Oh, btw.
        The checker should be someone you would not like to kill if he makes a
        mistake ;-) Cheers! Stefan

      <div class="email-content">
        Okay - I&#x27;ve got a problem. I have solved a cube blindfolded, but it
        was only once, and that was ages ago. I&#x27;d like to be able to do it
        some more, but it just took way too long to do it again. That said,
        I&#x27;ll probably never be doing anything larger than a 3x3x3, since I
        think 30-45 minutes is too long to spend on a single solve. I started
        out practicing on doing the 2x2x2, and then I moved to the 3x3x3. I was
        able to do it on my first try, but it seems to me that permutations are
        unneccessarily difficult. Even if all I do is memorize corner
        permutations and correct it, it&#x27;s very difficult for me to
        accomplish... I feel like I&#x27;m missing something. Anyways... I find
        that I can memorize the numbers without a whole lot of difficulty, and
        I&#x27;m sure I could do it pretty quickly given more practice (a lot
        more). What messes me up is actually executing permutations. I memorize
        using Richard Carr&#x27;s method - remember which piece is in each
        position. I find that as soon as I try to apply the first permutation
        sequence (even just for corners), I take a long time to process the
        cube, create the new permutation layout mentally, and finally apply the
        sequence. Several questions come out of this: 1) Are there any tips or
        tricks anyone can give on how to adjust/remember new permutations as you
        go? 2) Do people find it&#x27;s easier to remember cycles, or to
        remember pieces/positions? 3) If you remember pieces/positions, do you
        cycle pieces to place 2 at a time, or do you place one piece at a time,
        in a specific order? For example, I was thinking it might make my life a
        little easier if I first place DBL, then DBR, then DFL, etc. for the
        corners, and similarly for the edges. I found it difficult to figure out
        how to rotate any three edges or corners on a whim - I&#x27;d always go
        to great pains to apply setup sequences and remember how to reverse
        them. How do you guys do it? 4) If you remember cycles, how do you
        remember them? For example, if there are two 3 cycles of corners,
        1->2->3-> and 4->5->6, how do you distinguish that in your mind from
        1&lt;->2 3&lt;->4 5&lt;->6? Do you remember 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 4? It
        seems it would be easier to work through the cycle memory - just chip
        away a couple numbers each time you dig into a cycle - but I don&#x27;t
        get how to effectively memorize it in the first place. Essentially,
        parts of both approaches make sense to me, but neither makes sense to me
        completely on its own. I think that&#x27;s it for now... I&#x27;d love
        to have this skill as something that I can demonstrate, rather than just
        being able to say - &quot;oh, yeah... I did that once, and it took me
        about an hour&quot;. - Grant

        Here comes something I intended to suggest anyway. It helps me a lot for
        the setup sequences and reversing them, at least to get them right.
        I&#x27;m not yet fast though, but in general I think it can help: Talk
        to yourself. Loud. I mean, don&#x27;t scream, but actually talk
        physically. Not just inside your head. Whispering can be enough. This
        has two big benefits for me: 1) One of my biggest problems has always
        been that I wasn&#x27;t sure whether I had already done the move I
        wanted to. So should I move on or do the move now??? Believe me, this
        *will* happen for complex puzzles unless you&#x27;re the god of
        concentration (which I&#x27;m obviously not ;-). Talking to yourself
        makes use of the so-called echoic memory in addition to your normal
        working memory. You know, like you still &quot;hear&quot; a sound in
        your ear that you heard moments ago but that&#x27;s already over. I
        comment *every single turn* unless I&#x27;m executing a long algorithm
        that my hands can perfectly execute. Well, I usuall only say things like
        &quot;down, right, up, left&quot; (corresponding to L D L&#x27;
        D&#x27;). For the Megaminx, I even do double turns in two steps and
        comment each one. I also speak to myself between some moves (mostly
        between algs), explaining to me what I&#x27;ve just done and what
        I&#x27;ll do next. I think speaking to myself builds an extra link
        between my hands and my brain so they don&#x27;t go separate ways ;-) 2)
        It calms me down. Considerably ;-) Btw, here&#x27;s something nice
        Google found about echoic memory:

        I&#x27;ve been thinking more about blindfold cubing lately... I&#x27;d
        like to finally do another cube blindfolded (without spending an hour on
        it), and it&#x27;s made me wonder - for those of you who can solve a
        cube blindfolded in 10-15 minutes or better (I&#x27;d ask just under 5,
        but that may only be 1-2 people), how long does it take you to
        memorize/perform the different stages of your solution? For example, if
        you take Richard Carr&#x27;s approach, where you orient corners, orient
        edges, permute corners, and finally permute edges, how long would it
        take for you to do each stage, independently. I just timed myself a
        couple times on the orientation stages, and found that, depending on the
        difficulty of the case, it took anywhere from 0:17 - 1:12 to memorize
        and fix corner orientation and from 0:34 - 1:40 to memorize and fix edge
        orientation. How do you compare? More importantly (for my interest,
        anyways), is how long do the permutation stages take for
        memorization/execution? How does the sum of the parts compare to the
        whole time to memorize the whole cube and solve it? I&#x27;m just
        curious to know if you can do it 2-3 times as fast when doing the parts,
        or if it&#x27;s pretty much just the combination of the parts. Okay,
        I&#x27;ve babbled enough - I think you get what I&#x27;m asking :-P -

        First of all, I use my own method for memory blindfold cubing. In my
        method, I combine orientation and permuting of corners into one phase
        and orientation and permuting of edges into the second phase. (As far as
        possible that is. Often times when removing a corner (or edge) cycle,
        when the last piece in the cycle returns to its home position, it does
        so with a twist (or flip). When this occurs, invariably there are other
        corner (or edge) cycles that also contain a twist (or flip). I usually
        take care of any left over twists/flips at the end of my two phases. And
        then, if the parity of the original scrambled cube was odd, then I take
        care of the swap of the last pair of corners and last pair of edges at
        the very end.) At present, my memorization takes entirely too long.
        It&#x27;s about 70-80% of my total time. The rest is split fairly evenly
        between corners and edges. (For me edges are easier, and go quicker, but
        there are more of them.) Having written the above, I suggest that for
        beginning blindfold, accuracy is way more important than speed. Speed
        comes only from &quot;having been there before&quot;. In other words,
        every time you encounter a new situation that you haven&#x27;t done for
        yourself before, then you have to spend time analyzing (which is slow)
        rather than remember what you did in that situation the last time (which
        is quicker). So I guess I&#x27;m trying to say that there is no
        substitute for putting in the time. Jim M. --- In

        Hey I have a lot of questions, so sorry but this is going to be a long
        post (I seem to always do that apparently). I started doing blindfold
        solving by giving each piece a specific label (I always solve the cube
        from the same orientation). So when solving I know where each piece is
        and I start by placing all the middle layer pieces in their correct
        spots, then all the top and bottom layer pieces into their correct
        layers, then all the pieces in each layer to their correct spots (4-8
        algs total for the edges and 3-4 for the corners). Recently I started
        trying Macky&#x27;s way of using cycles and dropping off two of the
        numbers in the memorized string of numbers after doing each 3 cycle. My
        question is which is faster/better/etc.? My old way allowed you to know
        where every piece was at any given time, and you could use 4 cycles, 3
        cycles, algs that 2 cycled corners and edges (odd permutations) at any
        time to fix edges and corners simultaneously. The problem is that it
        requires more algs and lots of &quot;re-memorizing&quot; after you
        perform an alg. Macky&#x27;s way, which I&#x27;ve only practiced for a
        week, is MUCH faster the times I am successful and lets you forget stuff
        rather than re-memorize after doing each 3 cycle (which is faster in my
        opinion as well). However I ALWAYS seem to mess up something when I
        solve via cycles. My accuracy memorizing piece by piece is easily 2 or 3
        times my &quot;solving by cycles&quot; accuracy. For you people who
        solve via cycles, how do you get _SO_ fast and how do you stay accurate?
        My fastest solving via cycles (for both corners and edges) is 4 minutes
        39 seconds. My fastest solving both corners and edges &quot;piece by
        piece&quot; is 6 minutes 30 seconds, so I think cycles is faster. Also
        when I&#x27;m solving via cycles and run into an odd permutation in the
        corners and edges at the end, I&#x27;ve found that often I have to do a
        long series of setup moves to get all the pieces into the top or bottom
        layer so that I can do an alg to fix them, but it is easy for me to
        forget the setup moves I did since it can take up to 6 or 7. Solving via
        &quot;piece by piece memorizing&quot; I always grouped the pieces
        together into useful ways early on, so in the end if it came down to an
        odd permutation all the pieces would be in one layer anyway and I could
        just do an alg to fix them with no setup moves. Also (and I know I am
        rambling on a lot) I&#x27;ve tried solving the edges via cycles and
        solving the corners via piece-by-piece and have gotten some solves in
        the 5 minute range, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is as fast. Personally I
        like solving the corners piece by piece because even though it may be
        more algs (1 or 2 more on average per solve) I can think through them
        quicker since I can group the pieces on each face in useful ways rather
        than having to do weird cycles like (UBL to UFR to DFL) which take 4
        setup moves to do and undo at the ends. What does everyone else do? How
        do you guys who solve via cycles get ___SO___ incredibly fast without
        messing up? Does anyone else solve via &quot;piece-by-piece&quot;
        memorizing? Feeling totally and completely lost, Chris

        Hi Jim, would you be willing to tell us more about how you solve it? I
        think I use a similar system (at least I&#x27;m doing orientation and

        first, though that doesn&#x27;t matter much)), but your execution times

        Hi Brent, can you describe more precisely what your problem is? Is it
        memorizing? Is it the setup-moves before and after an algorithm
        application? Is it 2-cycles? You could have a look at a simple method I
        made up and am exploring now:
        http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/blindsolving/3x3_single_alg/ Not
        blindfolded I can solve the edges with this in a little more than a
        minute now. And it requires almost no thinking and very short and
        intuitive setup-moves (some of those I used there aren&#x27;t even
        optimal). It solves the edges one by one (in 2-cycles, not in 3-cycles).
        I intend to get used to this basic method until I can perfectly do it
        and then I&#x27;ll try introducing &quot;looking ahead&quot; in order to
        use 3-cycles whenever appropriate. Stefan > i can solve the corners

        Stefan, First of all congratulations on solving the Megaminx while
        blindfolded! I am only now getting around to learning to solve that one
        (by sight). I had to get rid of the stickers and repaint mine before I
        could get anywhere, because two of the colors looked almost identical to
        me. (But then again, I am very slightly color blind.) It&#x27;s good to
        hear that there is someone else out there who tries to combine
        orientation and permutation. For some reason, I tend to do the corners
        first, but that is just a preference. In order to do the moves
        blindfolded in 1:15, I increased the amount of time spent in
        memorization, and planned everything out to a greater level of detail
        than normal. Making certain that I could very quickly remember the order
        that I was going to place all of the pieces also helped. Other than
        that, it was the same method that I always use. Like you, I do as much
        as possible by decomposing longer cycles into 3-cycles. Without knowing
        more about your methods, it&#x27;s hard to tell what would help you to
        improve. I am guessing for example that when you permute 3 edge pieces,
        you make whatever setup moves that will put them into some standard set
        of positions, such as all in the top layer. Once the repositioning is
        complete, you undo your setup moves. The net effect of this
        &quot;setup&quot;, &quot;reposition&quot;, then &quot;undo the
        setup&quot; routine is that everything is unchanged, except for the
        three edges that were moved by the repositioning. I work this way as
        well. What follows is a guess as to how our methods differ. Most people
        use four or five algorithms when they do blindfold cubing. I use a few
        more, and there is definitely a lot of redundancy. Maybe I should just
        list them by function: (1) a 3- cycle for edges that repositions UB, UF
        and DF, (2) another edge 3- cycle that repositions the same three edges
        but flips UB and DF, (3) another edge 3-cycle for the same three edges
        that flips UB and UF, (4) another edge 3-cyle that repositions UL, UF
        and UR, (5) another edge 3-cycle that repositions these same three top
        edges but flips UL and UF (and also the mirror image of the algorithm
        that flips UR and UF), (6) still another that repositions UL, DF and UR,
        and (7) still another that affects these same three edges but also does
        flips. Because I know a large variety of edge routines, it takes fewer
        setup moves in order to prepare to reposition three edges, and this also
        reduces the number of setup moves that need to be undone after the
        repositioning. Almost invariably one of my edge algorithms ends up being
        &quot;close by&quot; to whatever set of edges I need to reposition. I
        also use at least four different routines for exchanging two pairs of
        edges. For some reason, I tend to use only one algorithm for
        repositioning three corners, but three different routines for
        repositioning two pairs of corners. This isn&#x27;t necessarily as
        inefficient as it sounds. This is because sometimes you can greatly
        reduce your setup moves by changing your frame of reference. For
        example, let&#x27;s say that corners UFL, URF and DLF need to be
        recycled. One way to do this would place DLF in the top layer with the
        other two before repositioning. Another way would be to notice that they
        all are already in the front layer. So just be rotating the entire cube,
        so that the front layer is temporarily on top, you can repostion them
        that way instead. Which way you choose should be decided largely by how
        the corners are twisted. Learning additional algorithms for permutting
        two pairs of corners can also help. I regularly use: (1) repositions UFL
        and URF as a pair and also ULB and UBR as a pair, (2) repositions pair
        UFL and and UBR and pair URF and ULB, and (3) repostions pair UFL and
        UBR and pair URF and DFR. And even though you are permutting and
        orienting at the same time, there are often edge cycles that contain
        only one flipped edge (which means that there is another edge cycle that
        contains a flipped edge). And there are also corner cycles that contain
        twists. (I bet you already knew this.) You can forget about setup moves
        for putting the corners into standard positions before removing twists.
        Just rotate the entire cube, remove your twists then rotate back to your
        normal position. When you get down to it, two corners can only be (1)
        right next to each other, (2) opposite corners on the same face, or (3)
        totally opposite each other, such as UFL and DRB. Once you can easily
        handle each of these, you can forget about setup moves for pairs of
        twists. Because we both try to orient and permute at the same time, the
        number of corner twists to deal with is rarely more than three, and the
        number of edge flips is rarely more than four. So learn routines to fix
        pairs of corner twists, and routines to fix triples of both clockwise
        and counter- clockwise twisted corners. Also learn a routine that flips
        four edges if you haven&#x27;t already. For dealing with odd cube
        parity, I use one routine that swaps one pair of edges and one pair of
        corners, such as the URF and UBR corners along with the UF and UR edges.
        But this one routine can be reflected right-to-left so that it works on
        UFL and ULB corners and UF and UL edges. And both of these routines can
        also be reflected front-to-back, making two more parity fixing
        algorithms. That just about covers my memory blindfold method except for
        discussing the actual moves. We can get into this in the future if you
        wish. And someday soon we should start talking about seeing-eye (team)
        blindfold cubing. I hope that this is understandable and that it helps.

        Chris, I&#x27;m guessing that you have spent a lot more time learning
        how to blindfold solve using your piece-by-piece method than you have
        spent using the cycle method. Try and remember back to when you were
        learning how to do piece-by-piece. I bet your results for piece-by-
        piece back then are pretty similar to your cycle method results now.
        I&#x27;m sure that switching over is tough, but I&#x27;m sure you can do
        it if you just hang in there for a while longer. One way to decide
        whether cycle method is faster than piece-by-piece is to compare the
        number of moves needed to solve the same scramble by the two methods. I
        bet you will find that cycle methods use fewer moves. If this is
        correct, then assuming that you know both methods equally well, and can
        do the same number of moves per minute with both methods, then the
        method with the shorter number of moves will probably be faster. I have
        to say &quot;probably&quot;, because this line of reasoning doesn&#x27;t
        take into account how much mental calculation is needed for either of
        these methods. I suspect that there is less mental calculation for the
        cycle method as well. On the other hand, cycle method&#x27;s
        calculations are relatively new to you, so don&#x27;t be surprised if
        you can&#x27;t do them as fast or as accurately right now. By the way,
        it is possible to keep track of where each piece is located when solving
        by a cycle method. But you don&#x27;t have to in order for cycle method
        to work. On the other hand, if I am understanding your piece-by-piece
        method, you do have to keep track of where all of the pieces are in
        order for that method to work. I&#x27;m guessing that you are seeing the
        benefits of the cycle method more for edges because there are more of
        them, which makes them harder to keep track of (as compared to the
        corners) when using the piece-by-piece method. Keep working at the cycle
        method on both edges and corners, and eventually you will probably drop
        your old method for both edges and corners. On the other hand, if doing
        the edges by the new method and the corners by the old method helps you
        keep from getting too frustrated, that&#x27;s OK for a while longer. I
        wish I had more advice concerning how to get faster and more accurate
        other than _practice_. It all depends on what kind of mistakes you might
        be making, and I have no specific ideas concerning where you could be
        going wrong. Come to think of it, whenever you &quot;miss&quot;, are you
        able to analyze how the cube is wrong, and determine from that what you
        did wrong? If you can&#x27;t tell, then is there any way that you can
        film yourself making an attempt at a blindfold solve? If you can, focus
        the camera so that it shows your hands, preferably from about the same
        angle that you would be watching if you weren&#x27;t blindfolded. If you
        can watch the recording right after making an attempt, while you can
        still remember how you were planning to solve the cube, then you should
        be able to see when and how you went wrong. Finally, fixing the parity
        problem is one of the hardest things to learn. If you are having trouble
        finding the right setup moves to fix that last pair of corners and last
        pair of edges, why not trade those harder pairs for easier ones? For
        example, let&#x27;s say that you realize that the last pair of corners
        are too tough to get into the top layer. Why not swap two pairs of
        corners? One pair would be the two corners that you are having trouble
        with. The second pair would be your two favorite corners in the top
        layer. So the net effect of this manuever is to fix the two bad corners
        while messing up two easy corners. Did that make the problem easier? If
        it did, great! If it didn&#x27;t, then use the similar trick for edges
        to trade that hard pair of edges for your favorite pair of edges in the
        top layer. This trick won&#x27;t result in you setting a new personal
        fastest time, but it does come in handy in times when you are
        &quot;stuck&quot; and can&#x27;t find the ideal setup moves. Jim --- In

      <div class="email-content">
        Here&#x27;s how I solve the cube blindfolded quickly: First off I see if
        there will be a parity error. I quickly count off the corner cycles.
        Corner cycles can be learned on stiff_hands&#x27; page if you don&#x27;t
        understand them. Anyways after counting the cycles real fast you
        subtract 1 from each cycle and add the number together and just pray
        that it&#x27;s an even number. Otherwise you have a parity error. For me
        it&#x27;s easier to get rid of it from the start by just turning U at
        the beginning, but the only bad thing here is that you have to memorize
        the cube as if you had already turned U so it takes some mental strain
        to get it right. Anyways, then I do corner orientation which most people
        seem to be able to do. Takes maybe 5 seconds to memorize because
        it&#x27;s so quick... do this phase by either taking a mental picture of
        what the corners look like (try associating a shape with it if it helps
        you. Like, for example, if corner UBL has orientation 2 and UBR has
        orientation 1, I imagine a pull-up bar stretching between the two
        corners where the pole stabs through the U-face color. Eh, use whatever
        method you&#x27;d like). Memorization is really about your own
        preference. I use my own methods of memorization so they may not work
        for you... anyways. For corner permutation I used to memorize number
        cycles but they grew cumbersome and slow. It&#x27;s easier for me to
        just memorize where everything goes. I often memorize a rollercoaster
        going from one corner to the next. If the situation is difficult you can
        still see what the cycle would look like. I *only* use 3-cycles.
        Here&#x27;s how it works: If your cycle is (xyz) then a three-cycle will
        solve it. To understand what three-cycle permute move you must use, you
        must think about which piece is where upon setup. X moves to Y which
        moves to Z which moves to X, so you must know which corner permute will
        do so. One moves corners clockwise and the other moves them
        counterclockwise. If your cycle is (vwxyz)or longer, then a three-cycle
        will reduce it to (vyz). If your cycle has (wx)(yz) in it, then the
        easiest way for me to do this is to treat the first three corners as one
        cycle. This means I will cycle (wxy). By doing so, (wx)(yz) reduces to
        (wzy). The second corner of the first cycle drops out, while the two
        corners in the second cycle switch places, and both of these initial
        cycles become one. Or, you can use a four-corner swap move. I&#x27;ve
        just found this way to be easy and consistent and you don&#x27;t need to
        memorize more algorithms if you have not already. To each their own. As
        for edge orientation, this is really easy and can be memorized with a
        mental picture more often than not because often there is not much to
        orient, in my experiences. At most, you have to memorize 6 edges.
        Anything more and you&#x27;re working too hard. If there are say, 8
        edges to orient, just memorize the 4 edges that are already oriented and
        screw those up, then do a Superflip move which can be found on many
        sites. You memorize far less on this step than anything else so it
        should be fast. To tell if a piece is oriented or not: First, mind you
        that at this point you can do *any* move you want, but if you are
        turning L or R, it MUST be L2 and R2. No L, no L&#x27;, no R&#x27;, no
        R. The only exception to this rule is the actual permuting moves
        themselves. But in terms of setup, never do single turns of L or R.
        Anyhow, you must think *if I were to move this edge around the cube any
        which way, would I be able to line its colors up with the centers?* For
        instance, let&#x27;s say an edge was blue and red. If you brute-forced
        it into that position by using any moves (between the red and blue
        centers) would it line up nicely (blue center, blue edge, red edge, red
        center) or not (blue center, red edge, blue edge, red center). Edge
        permutation takes the longest to memorize and is the hardest to do
        correctly. Taking a mental picture here is a bit hard but still works
        but memorizing number cycles here may be a bit easier. I do whatever
        moves will get the three edges I need to the U layer, then cycle them,
        then undo my setup move. Again, make sure your setup moves do not
        involve single turns of L or R. Also, three-cycling on any other face
        (except D) will mess up your orientation. If you can help it, keep it to
        the U face. The cycles work the same way as corners in terms of how they
        are affected (xyz), (vwxyz), or (wx)(yz). Eh hope this helps :P

        Pedro, When I do corners, almost all of the time I get three corners
        oriented properly on the same side using whatever setup moves are
        necessary, then I use that one 3 corner permutation. If I am lucky, I
        won&#x27;t even use any of the algs for 2 pairs of corners. In my
        previous post, I was merely telling everyone what I &quot;keep in my
        toolbox&quot;, without meaning to imply that I use all tools equally.
        Sorry for any confusion. I find that when you are open minded concerning
        which side you will use for cycling 3 corners, you rarely need more than
        two setup moves. (This is my subjective experience. I haven&#x27;t fully
        analyzed this to determine whether it is always true, yet.) By the way,
        I&#x27;m sure that you were able to get algorithms that are equivalent
        to mine from an optimizer, but you probably do not have my algs. I am a
        throwback to an earlier time, and none of my algs were computer
        generated by me. A couple come from booklets that were published at the
        height of the original cubing craze, and the rest were discovered by
        hand. If anything, some of your algs may be quicker than mine. Jim ---

        Hi Stefan, Although I didn&#x27;t time my memorization and planning for
        my 1:15 solve, I&#x27;m guessing that it was no more than 10-15 minutes.
        My normal solve times are typically from 4 to 6 minutes, memorization
        included. Perhaps I should explain my reference to seeing-eye or team
        blindfold cubing. At WC2003 in Toronto, I did a little demo of a
        blindfold trick during which I never see the cube at all and solve it
        blindfolded. The trick started with the solver being blindfolded before
        the cube is scrambled. Once the audience agreed that the cube was
        sufficiently scrambled, I had the emcee, acting as my assistant, pick
        one of the six cube colors. Then as I pointed at various stickers, he
        responded &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; depending on whether it was
        his chosen color. After a number of these questions, one side (but not
        one layer) was solved. Next, he picked a second color, and we repeated
        the process. The second phase ended when the second side was solved
        without disturbing the first side. Then a third side was chosen and
        added to the completed sides and so on, until there weren&#x27;t any
        sides left to solve. This describes the basic trick. There are also
        serveral variations, including one where the assistant and the solver
        reverse roles. The assistant is blindfolded, and the solver, (who
        isn&#x27;t allowed to touch the cube) tells the assistant which moves to
        make. I am trying to understand your comment that &quot;the top guys
        seem to do it speed style, not blindfold style.&quot; Of course, the top
        blindfold guys save a lot of time by doing their moves quickly. But then
        again, the best speed cubists sometimes look away as they are finishing
        their last algorithm. When I am at my best at speedcubing, (I&#x27;m not
        super fast, so I can&#x27;t claim to be an expert,) I am looking ahead,
        trying to determine my next moves while my hands are performing whatever
        algorithm was previously assigned to them, almost as if they have a mind
        of their own. So I personally don&#x27;t see that big of a difference
        between blindfold and speed style cubing. Perhaps, if you still see a
        significant difference between the two styles, you will post further on
        the subject. Jim --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        blindfold cubing. Very good you explained this. I&#x27;ve read about it
        and seen a picture, but I thought you could ask questions like &quot;is
        this sticker yellow?&quot;. The real thing sounds much better! > I am

        seem to use Fridrich &amp; Co, i.e. not caring about the remaining
        unsolved pieces. With blindfold style I mean when you use algorithms
        that only affect a few pieces, namely the ones you want to affect.

        i&#x27;m a beginner, sorry :( > brent On my cube the three groups I
        mentioned in my ordering are opposite colors, i.e. white and yellow are
        opposite from each other. Let&#x27;s say I look at the green/orange
        place (i.e. the edge place between the green and orange centers). Note
        that order matters, i.e. green/orange is not the same as orange/green.
        Now if I see the yellow/red edge in that spot (again, order matters, not
        the same as red/yellow) then I know the edge needs to be oriented
        because green/orange is *against* my ordering (since green > orange) and
        yellow/red is *ok* for my ordering (since yellow &lt; red). You could
        also look at it from the opposite direction, in that case you&#x27;d
        notice that in the orange/green place there&#x27;s the red/yellow edge.
        In reality, I know which sticker of an edge should have the brighter
        color and if the edge that&#x27;s actually in that position has the
        darker color then that edge needs to be oriented. Does that help better?

        I&#x27;ve been working on developing my own simple approach to blindfold
        cubing, based on ideas from different places. Basically, I don&#x27;t
        want to learn new algs and I have the worst time reversing setup moves
        successfully... Originally, I learned from Richard Carr&#x27;s .pdf file
        for beginners, applying algs I already knew to solve using his approach.
        Now, I&#x27;m kind of adapting what I&#x27;ve learned from him and
        elsewhere (I know I read stiff hands&#x27; stuff at some point), and
        things I&#x27;ve figured out on my own, and putting an easier (in my
        opinion) spin on things. Granted, this approach is not as fast as
        possible, but for those of us who are still just trying to get a second
        cube solved blindfolded, I think it&#x27;s a good approach. That lengthy
        intro aside, this is the first step to my &quot;simplification&quot; -
        how I go about corner orientation (CO). I memorize orientations (for
        both corners and edges) as outlined in the aforementioned .pdf document
        (available at
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Richard/BlindfoldRevenge.pdf ),
        though I find it easier to remember as a sequence of 4 numbers (e.g. 12,
        11, 1, 21), instead of a string of 8. To do CO, first, orient as much of
        the F face as you can - in the example sequence I gave, UFR and DFL
        would need a clockwise (C) twist, and UFL would require a
        counterclockwise (CC) twist. Therefore, I can twist UFL CC, and either
        UFR or DFL C, leaving the other still needing a C twist. To twist a
        given corner: - Move it to UFR with a twist of F - Perform (R&#x27; U R
        U&#x27;)*2 to twist it CC or (U R&#x27; U&#x27; R)*2 to twist it C -
        Move it back to its original position with a twist of F Notice that you
        handle each piece individually, so there&#x27;s only one setup move to
        remember - though for speed you can compress successive turns of F, just
        putting the corners into UFR one after another, until all (except maybe
        1) are complete. As long as you twist 1 or 2 pairs of corners in
        opposite directions or exactly 3 in the same direction, it doesn&#x27;t
        matter what order you do them in. Next, do the same thing with the B
        face. Again, in my example sequence, all B corners require a C twist,
        except DBR, which requires a CC twist. To twist a given back corner: -
        Move it to UBR with a twist of B - Perform (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U)*2 to
        twist it C or (U&#x27; R U R&#x27;)*2 to twist it CC - Move it back to
        its original position with a twist of B Again, you just need to keep
        track of which corner you are orienting, and you know what setup move
        you need to reverse. Once this is complete, there will be at most 2
        corners that still need to be oriented - one on F and one on B. For ease
        of remembering the setup moves, always do the same thing to bring the
        two corners into the same face: - Move B until the corners are
        diagonally opposite on the puzzle (such that they share no faces) - Do
        L2 or R2 to bring the B corner to F - Orient the corners as you would
        normally do on the F face - Reverse the L or R turn - Reverse the B turn
        I like this approach because it uses as most 2 setup moves for any
        situation and doesn&#x27;t require any cube rotations. Also, the algs
        are short and easy (nicely triggered). What do yo think? - Grant

        That&#x27;s indeed an easy way to do it and you probably win the prize
        for easy-and-fast. If you ignore the algorithm execution, there&#x27;s
        an even easier approach, though. One that truly only needs a single
        setup- move at most and that can handle *all* corners the exact same
        way, not splitting it up into F, B and a combination step. I used it in
        one of my approaches for Tom&#x27;s cube solver contest:
        http://tomas.rokicki.com/cubecontest/pochmann2.zip (look at the readme
        file) The approach uses this algorithm: (F&#x27; D2 F R&#x27; U2 R) * 2
        Btw, only now did I notice that the first and second half are identical,
        maybe I could&#x27;ve saved a few more bytes ;-). Also, I just noticed
        that at least (R&#x27; U2 R) is nice to execute as well and (F&#x27; D2
        F) doesn&#x27;t seem so bad either. It rotates UFL and DBR and leaves
        the rest of the cube intact. So in order to orient all corners, bring
        one corner after the other to UFL, use the algorithm (or its inverse) to
        orient the corner and bring it back to where it came from. Do it for all
        seven corners (all but DBR). That&#x27;s it. Orienting edges is done
        similar, I also optimized for short setup- algs (because I hardcoded
        those) in order to save bytes ;-) And permutation of edges and corners
        is done similarly easy (although of course a bit differently), again
        optimized for short setup-sequences. Stefan

        The move I do for corner orientaion: Put a corner of orientation 1 at
        UFR and a corner of orientation 2 at DFR and do: (F2 L F2 L&#x27;) (U2 R
        U&#x27; R&#x27; F2 R&#x27; F2) (R U&#x27;). It&#x27;s pretty nice, very
        easy to execute and remember (just try it on the hands, it&#x27;s
        smooth). For edge orientation, when I say M I mean middle goes down, and
        M&#x27; means middle goes up: M&#x27; U M&#x27; U M&#x27; U2 M U M U M
        U2. *VERY EASY* It flips UB and UF. I use this move and only this move.
        If I have to flip, say, UF and UL, then I would do L&#x27; B&#x27; to
        put UL in the UB position, do the move, then do B L to put the edge back
        into place, correctly oriented. Aside from that I only use a 3-corner
        permute and 3-edge permute which can be obtained from any cube site with
        PLL algorithms. In all I use a total of four algorithms to solve the
        cube blindfolded. However, I do use the move R D R&#x27; F D2 F&#x27; to
        bring a corner on the D layer *straight up* to the U layer without
        messing up orientation. It&#x27;s an effective move for when you have
        two corners on the U layer and one on the D layer (or vice-versa), and
        all three of these need permuting. After permuting you just undo this
        move. You&#x27;ll find that with such moves, &quot;setting up&quot; the
        pieces is very easy and requires little memory usage.

        To avoid this problem you need to designate two sides as *2 only. For
        me, I do this for L and R. That means, any &quot;setup moves&quot; I do
        to put edges in position cannot use L, L&#x27;, R, or R&#x27;. However,
        L2 and R2 are permitted. Also take this into account when you are
        checking for edge orientation (keep in mind that L and R must be done in
        full- turns). If you can do this you will never have orientation
        problems when permuting as long as you do it in the U or D layers.

        If he is bringing something up from the middle layer you have to realize

        permute. You can either get it to the U layer by doing F&#x27; or R,

        Okay, I&#x27;ll try to explain again. I made this method up, and I
        figured that someone had already used it before. But it sounds like not
        many people do. Basically, I bring edges number 1-4 to the top, because
        that is where they need to go. Then edges 5-12 are all already in the
        bottom two layers. So now, I bring the edges number 9-12 to the bottom,
        because that&#x27;s where they need to go. So edges 1-4 are all in the
        top layer, but incorrectly permuted. Edges 5-8 are all in the middle
        layer, but incorrectly permuted. And that means that the last layer has
        all of it&#x27;s edges, but incorrectly permuted. Then, I just use the
        3-edge cycle to solve each layer in turn. I hope that made sense.. But
        Kyuubree, that advice helped me quite a bit. Now I know how to do it,
        but I just need to work on remembering it. Thanks! --- In

        Yes it has to be two opposite faces. In the example I used, let&#x27;s
        say your doubleturn faces were B and L. You could still mess up the FR
        edge in the middle layer. So yes they have to be opposite faces. I use L
        and R.

        This is an old post, but it applies to the position I&#x27;m in. Sorta.
        Chris, which method did you decide on using? I started by doing it
        piece-by-piece, but that was too hard. I could figure it out eventually,
        but I can&#x27;t keep updating the permutation in my mind without losing
        something. I&#x27;ve finally figured out how cycles work, but there must
        be something wrong with how I&#x27;m doing it. The cycles are always
        really long. For example, my cube sits in front of me right now with
        edge permutation like this: (1,7,5,11,2,12,10,9)(3)(4)(6,7) Obviously
        the last couple are easy to sort out, but only because all the other
        pieces are in the first cycle. I have trouble believing that people
        memorize and do that whole big long thing. --- In

        lol. actually, that sequence is pretty good because there are 2 in

        I did end up sticking with cycles. Switching the edge permutations step
        over to cycles actually cut that step in half for me in terms of number
        of moves so I took to it pretty fast. I did mess around with still doing
        the corners piece-by-piece but I gave that up because cycles is faster
        (for me at least). I&#x27;m still practicing 2x2x2 blindfolded a LOT to
        get used to the corners step for 3x3x3 as I still mess up on it
        sometimes. Also here are my tips for the sequence,
        (1,7,5,11,2,12,10,9)(3)(4)(6,7) &lt;--- do you mean (6,8) here? You have
        7 used twice. I still remember the cycles as cycles, but I use the cube
        as a tool to help me spacially remember them. To memorize that longer
        cycle I would associate the number &quot;1&quot; to edge at UB and
        &quot;7&quot; to the edge at UL etc.. So for each number in the cycle I
        give it a spacial location on the cube when memorizing. That isn&#x27;t
        actually the piece that is in that spot, I just memorize better
        spacially then with numbers so I give my cycles a spacial
        representation. Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;d do that cycle. My numbering
        might be different from you guys (I didn&#x27;t learn either of the
        internet methods). My numbering of the cube, 1,2,3,4,5,...,12 goes (in
        the same order) UB,UL,UR,UF,DB,DL,DR,DF,FL,FR,BL,BR so if I saw
        (1,7,5,11,2,12,10,9) I would first do (12,10,9) since those are all in
        the middle layer. After that none of the other numbers are all in the
        same layer, so I&#x27;d just read left to right doing the cycles until I
        got down to the last two. I try to always find a cycle within larger
        cycles that are all in the same layer, or have very few setup moves to
        get that way. Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hey does anyone have any useful multiple corner flip algs? I&#x27;m
        looking specifically for the 3 algs that flip 1) 3 corners; both
        possible cases of flipping 4 corners in one layer (assuming the other
        corners are all correctly flipped). I&#x27;m currently using
        R&#x27;U2RUR&#x27;UR and then correcting the edges for the first case
        and a similar move then correcting the edges for the other two cases. I
        was wondering what others did for these cases. Also does anyone have any
        useful algs that flip 4 edges? I currently make FREQUENT use of
        (M&#x27;U)*4 which Dror Vomberg showed me at the WC. Does anyone know of
        any other useful 4 edge flip algs? Thanks for the help, Chris

        between iterations. Keep in mind what (M&#x27;U)*4 does - it flips UL,
        UB, DF, and DB. Therefore, if you repeat the alg twice, with a turn of U
        and/or D in between repetitions, you can get some interesting/useful
        outcomes. Let&#x27;s call the original alg A, where A = (M&#x27;U)*4.
        Then: - A U A U&#x27; = flip UB and UF - A U&#x27; A U = flip UL and UR
        - A U2 A U2 = flip all U edges - A D A D&#x27; = flip all D edges - A
        D&#x27; A D = flip all D edges Using the U and D turns in different
        combinations, you have a lot of options to choose from - you can flip: -
        two opposite U edges - four D edges - two opposite U edges and four D
        edges - four U edges - four U and four D edges If you need to flip 7 or
        8 of the U/D edges, flip all 8 edges easily with A U2 D A U2 D&#x27; -
        that is (M&#x27;U)*3 M&#x27;U&#x27;D (M&#x27;U)*3 M&#x27;U&#x27;D&#x27;
        - and then you have at most 2 pieces remaining that need to be flipped.
        With 5 or 6 that need to flip (max 3 on either side), align U and D, so
        that A will leave at most one to flip on either side. - Grant

        Grant already explained most of it so I&#x27;ll just leave my most
        important EO algs. 2 edges (UF UB) - (M&#x27;U)(M&#x27;U)(M&#x27;U2) (M
        U)(M U)(M U2) 4 edges (U)- (M&#x27;U)x4 (MU)x4 8 edges (F+B) - (d D r

        R2 F2)(D&#x27; U)(F&#x27; U2)(L&#x27; R&#x27;) For the corners
        orientation you can find those algs in an optimal solver program, but I
        just prefer using this simple algs to orient corners on the U layer: to
        rotate the UFR corner clockwise: (R F&#x27;R&#x27;F)x2 conter-clockwise:
        (F&#x27;R F R&#x27;)x2 you place a corner in the position, rotate it,
        place another doing a Ux tur, rotate it, and so on. works for all the
        2/3/4 orientation groups of corners. Q:What method does Dave Orser use?

        I DID IT!! Finally!! It felt sooo good! I think the reason I was able to
        do it this time is because the edge permutation was reeaally easy. So it
        only took me 7 minutes 44 seconds, including memorization. I expect next

        Hey everyone. So yeah, I just felt like posting some of the algs I use
        to see if anyone has any better ones, and also to see if anyone likes
        any of these. I think it would be cool to continue this trading of algs
        that we seem to have started. Here are some useful corner flip algs I
        use a lot. flip three corners in U layer clockwise. The corner that
        doesn&#x27;t flip is at UFR: (R&#x27;U2RUR&#x27;UR) U2
        (L2U&#x27;F&#x27;BL2FB&#x27;U&#x27;L2) The first flips the corners, the
        U2 moves them back to the correct spot, the last fixes the edges. It is
        helpful to know all 8 reflections and/or inverses of this alg so that
        you don&#x27;t ever have to rotate the cube. Flip UFR clockwise, UFL
        counterclockwise, UBR counterclockwise, UBL clockwise:
        (R&#x27;U2RUR&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;UR)
        (F2U&#x27;LR&#x27;F2RL&#x27;U&#x27;F2) The first flips the corners, the
        second fixes the edges. Flip UFL clockwise, flip UBL counterclockwise:
        (LU2L&#x27;U&#x27;LU&#x27;L&#x27;) (R&#x27;U2RUR&#x27;UR) Also inverses
        and reflections are very useful for each. The only thing I don&#x27;t
        like about my algs is that they are very long, but they do trigger
        extremely well. Does anyone have any shorter algs, particularly for
        flipping three corners the same direction (whether or not it flips
        corners in the same layer doesn&#x27;t matter really). Also what algs do
        you guys use for flipping 4 corners at once? I have 2 (the above and
        it&#x27;s inverse) but the other 4 corner flip case I have to flip two
        pairs of 2 corners. The only other edge algs I can add that I use a lot
        are flip 4 edges in U layer R2 D&#x27; (R2M2) (M&#x27;U)*4 (R2M2) D R2
        and flip all edges in middle layer F D F D&#x27; (EF&#x27;)*4 D F&#x27;
        D&#x27; F&#x27; or also F&#x27; M&#x27; L R&#x27; to get them all in the
        U layer flip them there, then undo the setup at the end. I think
        it&#x27;s cool that we&#x27;re sort of sharing als here. I too think it
        would be cool to see what algs Dave uses. Chris

        Hi Chris, I don&#x27;t have much to offer for corner orientation algs. I
        really only use one alg plus a multitude of inverses/reflections for all
        my CO needs. It is terribly long (20 moves - really just a combo of 2
        Sunes) but very simple to adapt to any pair of corners on either U or D
        (or even L or R if convenient). Edge Orientation: Many people (myself
        included) seem to use: (M&#x27;U)*4 to flip UL, UB, DF, and DB and of
        course (M&#x27;U&#x27;)*4 will flip UR, UB, DF, and DB what MIGHT be new
        (at least I haven&#x27;t seen it posted as of yet) to flip all four
        edges on the UP face try: (M&#x27;U)*4 (MU)*4 and, naturally, all four
        edges on DOWN becomes: (MD&#x27;)*4 (M&#x27;D&#x27;)*4 everything else I
        use has already been posted so I wont repeat. BTW, to follow up on an
        older thread - I used to do both Edge and Corner permutation piece by
        piece. Thanks to the discussion on this site I have totally switched my
        EP to the cycle method - MUCH EASIER AND MUCH MUCH FASTER. I am still
        debating whether or not to switch my CP to cycle method. The fastest
        blindfolders all seem to use it which certainly argues in its favour.
        But I can generally Permute all corners with just three algs doing it
        piece by piece (generally DOWN corners in 2 algs and a third for the UP
        corners). I find that cycling the Corners also requires three steps for
        the most part so there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any savings in number of
        moves. The CON about cycling is that I still sometimes mess-up my set-up
        moves while the PRO about cycling is that it pretty much removes
        thinking leading straight to execution. The CON about piece by piece is
        that I have to figure out each move in advance but the PRO is that there
        are no set-up moves and the approach is very versatile and easy to
        execute once I have figured it out. But thinking is very costly when the
        clock is ticking. So I have totally switched to cycling for edges (and
        have even cycled the edges on my revenge - what a trip that was) but I
        am still debating whether to continue corners piece by piece or switch
        to cycles. I will definately practice the cycles a bit more to give them
        a fair chance. Now that I have more free time I can rejoin the Sunday
        contest! Rob --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

      <strong>89. Lucky cases</strong><br />

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been wondering lately about lucky cases in
        blindfold solving. What should we consider &quot;too lucky&quot; for
        purposes of posting on the unofficial records page? I think it
        needn&#x27;t be too serious since it&#x27;s all for fun, but maybe we
        could come up with some definition to follow. My first definition was:
        lucky case= any time I solved it ;). It evolved from there(though that
        definition is still applicable!), but after nearly two years, I&#x27;m
        still not sure what&#x27;s &quot;too lucky,&quot; and what&#x27;s just
        &quot;fortunate,&quot; and how to account for different solving methods.
        I took a few attempts at a definition over the last two years and sent
        those to speedcubing way back(when there weren&#x27;t many blindfold
        guys); what&#x27;s currently up there was an earlier contribution of
        mine, but now I&#x27;m not satisfied with it all. Now that there are so
        many more blindfold solvers, we should have input from whomever wishes.
        Let&#x27;s assume 4 basic stages(guys with other systems, sorry,
        you&#x27;ll have to weigh in; this still may apply, I&#x27;m not sure):
        1. Orienting corners 2. Orienting edges 3. Perming corners 4. Perming
        edges Too keep it simple, I think it might be fair to say, for 1 &amp;
        2, that those steps must not be skipped. In other words, there must be
        at least 2 corners not oriented, and at least 2 edges not oriented. If
        you&#x27;d also want to consider those two steps in combo, and for
        example exclude a case where there were two corners to orient, and two
        edges also, then we could do that too, but it may get complicated
        considering steps in combination- simple may be good. Step 3 is more
        confusing. Should we just go by the total number of corners already
        correctly placed, or also account for their locations? For example, if
        there were, say, 6 correctly placed, my experiences tells me that&#x27;s
        too rare. But I think also a case where, say, all 4 U corners were
        correctly placed, but all 4 D corners were not, would also be too lucky.
        So maybe, no more than 5 total corners correctly placed AND no more than
        3 corners correctly placed on either U or D layers. Or something like
        that ;). Step 4 is also confusing. Should we go by total number of edges
        already correctly placed, or also take into account their locations? I
        suppose we can rule out a case where, say, all edges are already in
        their correct layers. And also ones where 8 or more total edges are
        already correctly placed. Beyond that, I&#x27;m not totally sure. My
        idea is too keep it simple and lenient so we can have fun making fast
        times, at the same time not too lenient as to have ridiculous cases. All
        input would be appreciated; maybe it&#x27;s too hard to come up with a
        definition for all systems, but it&#x27;s worth a shot. Oh well,
        it&#x27;s all for fun anyhow. -Dave

        - really just a combo of 2 Sunes) but very simple to adapt to any pair
        of corners on either U or D (or even L or R if convenient). Edge
        Orientation: Many people (myself included) seem to use: (M&#x27;U)*4 to
        flip UL, UB, DF, and DB and of course (M&#x27;U&#x27;)*4 will flip UR,
        UB, DF, and DB what MIGHT be new (at least I haven&#x27;t seen it posted
        as of yet) to flip all four edges on the UP face try: (M&#x27;U)*4
        (MU)*4 and, naturally, all four edges on DOWN becomes: (MD&#x27;)*4
        (M&#x27;D&#x27;)*4 everything else I use has already been posted so I
        wont repeat. BTW, to follow up on an older thread - I used to do both
        Edge and Corner permutation piece by piece. Thanks to the discussion on
        this site I have totally switched my EP to the cycle method - MUCH
        EASIER AND MUCH MUCH FASTER. I am still debating whether or not to
        switch my CP to cycle method. The fastest blindfolders all seem to use
        it which certainly argues in its favour. But I can generally Permute all
        corners with just three algs doing it piece by piece (generally DOWN
        corners in 2 algs and a third for the UP corners). I find that cycling
        the Corners also requires three steps for the most part so there
        doesn&#x27;t seem to be any savings in number of moves. The CON about
        cycling is that I still sometimes mess-up my set-up moves while the PRO
        about cycling is that it pretty much removes thinking leading straight
        to execution. The CON about piece by piece is that I have to figure out
        each move in advance but the PRO is that there are no set-up moves and
        the approach is very versatile and easy to execute once I have figured
        it out. But thinking is very costly when the clock is ticking. So I have
        totally switched to cycling for edges (and have even cycled the edges on
        my revenge - what a trip that was) but I am still debating whether to
        continue corners piece by piece or switch to cycles. I will definately
        practice the cycles a bit more to give them a fair chance. Now that I
        have more free time I can rejoin the Sunday contest! Rob --- In

        Hi friends, So which do we have? Corner permutations:

        F/B, inverted mirrored F/B. These algorithms are really great!!)
        MD2M&#x27;D2 (in any direction) M&#x27;UMU2M&#x27;UM (in any direction,
        useful if you can do an easy F/B setup move that flips edges!!) Edge

        R&#x27; U2 R) * 2 Basically you can do any two generator corner
        orientation (like RU2R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27; or
        RU2R2U&#x27;R2U&#x27;R2U2R), then check which edges are cycled, then
        undo the edge cycle (see Edge permutations). For the corner orientations
        there are many neat tricks in case the total orientation of LL is not 0.
        What could we add to this list? One idea I got from blindfold solving to
        transfer to speedcubing is this: suppose you could do the orientations
        (edges/corners) both in one step, and the permutations (edges/corners)
        both in two steps. Then in 15 seconds preinspection you could memorize
        the orientations. After that you do the permutations. Total of 6 steps.
        That is better than the cross/F2L/OLL/PLL system with 7 steps. Another
        thing is this: without looking at the cross, just orient all edges. This
        is much easier than for blindfold because you can do F to flip 4 edges.
        I think the maximum depth for edge orientation is 7 moves. OK, now
        preinspect the cube to solve the cross using moves in the group
        (U,D,R,L,F2,B2). This would leave you a very easy F2L using only U, R
        and L moves. And it would leave you a LL with oriented edges. Try this a
        few times and then take an average not including the first step of
        orienting the edges. Mine was better than my normal average. Now if you
        could orient the edges very fast, and still be able to afterwards solve
        the cross fluently, then you could maybe even improve your times. This
        system can also be useful for one-handed cubing (many easy moves!!!) and
        for beginners who have trouble with OLL or F2L (only 8 corners case for
        OLL, no rotations or really hard cases for F2L). Have fun, Ron

        Hi, I am not really an expert with BLD cubing, but maybe this helps a
        little bit. I recently began with memorizing the positions of the pieces
        in a diffenrent way. Not very long ago, I would memorize a string of
        digits, where each digit represents the position where that piece needs
        to go. I recently discovered that memorizing the cycles is much easier
        (I don&#x27;t know if everyone agrees on this by the way). If you
        already do this, this tip will be useless :). I think memorizing and
        solving the cycles has these advantages: 1. You can memorize the shapes
        of the cycles. This will support the digits in your mind. Once you
        memorize the cycles (and their shapes), the problems are also easier to
        visualise. 2. Finding the solution is easier, and keeping track of the
        positions of the pieces is less time consuming. You don&#x27;t have to
        swap digits in your mind. Instead, you swap pieces on the cube, and
        forget some digits in your mind. If you want to know more about this:
        http://homepage.ntlworld.com/angela.hayden/cube/cube_frontpage.html.
        There are also some topics about cycles vs. piece by piece in this Yahoo
        group. Good luck, Joël. (PS: Forgive me my pour English. Just ask if you

        Dr Carr&#x27;s method is the &#x27;piece by piece.&#x27; Basically
        it&#x27;s what it sounds like: you go piece by piece. I used to do the
        corners like that. I would get all the top layer corners on the top, and
        all the bottom layer corners on the bottom, then permute them in their
        own layers. And for the edges, Dr Carr says to put all the middle slice
        edges first and then get the top and bottom edges on the right faces.
        For the corners it wasn&#x27;t a problem, but the edges was really
        difficult. Cycles are much easier to memorize, though I don&#x27;t know
        if they&#x27;re much faster. --- In

        moves :&amp;#92; I would do: 1) Permute UFL -> UFR -> UBR with (R
        B&#x27;) (R F2) (R&#x27; B R) F2 R2 2) Permute UBR -> UFL -> DBR with
        [(R&#x27;B R B&#x27;)*3 U2]*2 An explanation of this makes for a good
        transition into the next phase of the &quot;simple&quot; approach to
        blindfold cubing that I&#x27;ve been working on. It&#x27;s not actually
        the second step (after orient corners, I orient edges), but it&#x27;s
        the next step that I&#x27;ve got down solidly. For this corner
        permutation approach, you need to know algs to permute corners on U -
        these are mine: UFL -> UFR -> UBR = (R B&#x27;) (R F2) (R&#x27; B R) F2
        R2 UFL -> UBR -> UFR = (R2 F2) (R&#x27; B&#x27;) (R F2) (R&#x27; B
        R&#x27;) UFL &lt;-> UBL UFR &lt;-> UBR = F (R B) (R&#x27; F&#x27; R) (L
        F) (L&#x27; B&#x27; L) F&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; UFL &lt;-> UBR UFR &lt;->
        UBL = (R L) U2 (R&#x27; L&#x27;) (F&#x27; B&#x27;) U2 (F B) U2
        Technically it&#x27;s not necessary to know algs for these, but
        it&#x27;s much quicker if you know them, and most cubists do, so
        it&#x27;s not a tough requirement. Just remember that the last one is
        the same as swapping opposite edges (UF &lt;-> UB UL &lt;->UR) with an
        extra U2 twist at the beginning or end. In addition to knowing those
        algs, there are two others (very simple and quick): Alg1 - UBR &lt;->
        DBR UFR &lt;-> UBL = (R B&#x27; R&#x27; B) * 3 Alg2 - UBR &lt;-> DBR DFR
        &lt;-> DBL = (R&#x27; B R B&#x27;) * 3 Again... This approach is based
        on the idea of minimizing setup moves and necessary algorithms - by no
        means is this efficient in number of moves, but it is very comfortable
        to perform (at least in my opinion) and setup moves are logical and
        minimal. Here&#x27;s how it works... First, comes the memorization and
        manipulation of the state during solving. Memorize the corners&#x27;
        using a cycle method - I apply the numbers 1-8 to UFR, UFL, UBR, UBL,
        DFR, DFL, DBR and DBL respectively. Therefore, the cycle UFR -> UFL ->
        UBR would be 1->2->3 in my system, but the numbers you use are up to
        you. Once you have the corner permutation cycles all memorized, go
        through the cycles in order, sequentially solving and removing them from
        the list. If you have a cycle that is 3 or longer, cycle the first 3,
        and remove the second and third from the cycle (e.g. 1->2->3->4->5
        becomes 1->4->5). If it was exactly a cycle of three, it becomes a cycle
        of 1 (solved) and can be dropped. If the cycle is only 2, cycle them in
        order with the first from the next cycle. Then, drop the second number
        from the 2 cycle and insert the first one after the first number in the
        second cycle. For example, if you need to swap (UFL &lt;-> UFR)(UBR
        &lt;-> DBR) as suggested in the original post, cycle UFL->UFR->UBR, and
        you&#x27;ll be left with a 3 cycle of UBR->UFL->DBR (UFR becomes solved,
        and UFL gets inserted in the second cycle after UBR). That&#x27;s the
        mental game involved - now on to the actual application. If you need to
        cycle 3 corners or swap 2 pairs of corners on U, use a known alg. Do the
        same for D, with a cube rotation before and after as setup and reversal.
        When you want to cycle three corners where two are on U and the other on
        D, or vice versa, do this: 1) Move the lone piece to UBR or DBR with a
        turn of the U or D face 2) Move the &quot;first&quot; of the other two
        corners (the corner that stays on U or stays on D) directly above/below
        the lone piece with a turn of U or D 3) Perform Alg1 (2 corners on D) or
        Alg2 (2 corners on U) 4) Turn U or D to move the last corner directly
        above/below the lone piece 5) Perform the same alg as in #4 6) Put U and
        D back to original rotation Here&#x27;s an example... Let&#x27;s say you
        want to rotate UFR -> UBL -> DFL. Here are the steps as outlined above:
        1) Turn DFL to DBR with D2 2) Turn UFR to UBR with U&#x27; 3) Perform
        Alg2, which is (R&#x27; B R B&#x27;) * 3 4) Turn UBL to UBR with U2
        (reverse U&#x27; with U, then add U to put UBL at UBR - total turn is
        1/2) 5) Perform Alg2 - still (R&#x27; B R B&#x27;) * 3 6) Turn U&#x27;
        and D2 to return U and D faces to original states. If you don&#x27;t
        know algs to permute corners on U, and don&#x27;t want to learn them,
        you can just turn a face to put 2 on U and 1 on D and then follow the
        same procedure... If you get to the point that you have just one 2 cycle
        left, use your favorite PLL alg that swaps one corner pair and one edge
        pair. If you don&#x27;t know one, learning one is better than the
        alternative, which would be to do U or U&#x27;, adjust your mental
        picture of edge and corner permutations, and finish it off from there...

        Hi, I am not really an experienced blindfold cuber, but I&#x27;ve done
        it a couple of times now. I have seen video&#x27;s of people doing it
        really fast... It takes me probably more than 5 minutes for solving (I
        did not time myself yet, my goal for now is to do it consistently, with
        high accuracy), but I have seen someone doing it in 30 seconds or
        something (Geatan Guimond for example, if I recall correctly). So I
        wondered, what system do these people use? Does anyone know more about
        this? - Joël.

        How fast can you execute this? Some time ago I found that you can get
        the same using a &quot;double Sune&quot;, i.e. (L&#x27; U&#x27; L
        U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L) (R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;) This will twist the
        UFR and URB, so rotate the cube to achieve exactly what your alg does.
        Due to the nature of the above alg you can easily mirror it just by
        doing the second part first, i.e. try 1. (L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27;

        would have to agree that this defines a lucky case - several of those
        items on their own would actually define a very lucky case. For example,
        having all corners oriented is a 1 in 2187 occurance, and having all
        edges oriented is almost as rare. I realize you were trying to keep the
        definition simple and lenient, but I&#x27;m thinking these may be a bit
        too lenient. I almost never have more than 2 corners already oriented
        when I start, with somewhere in the range of 4-8 edges flipped. I
        don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had more than 1 corner or 2 edges
        pre-placed. I&#x27;d suggest this version - slightly revised - still
        considering a case lucky if one or more are satisfied: 1. More than 4
        corners are correctly oriented 2. More than 8 edges are correctly
        oriented 3. More than 2 corners are correctly positioned 4. More than 3
        edges are correctly positioned This also eliminates the need for special
        wording of having all edges in a particular slice pre-positioned,
        because of the total number that can be pre-positioned. Does this seem
        reasonable? It could just be that I haven&#x27;t solved enough cubes
        blindfolded to realize the frequency with which these things can
        happen... Just my thoughts. - Grant

        Yesterday I tried something new for memorizing the cube. In the
        permutation step, instead of memorizing the numbers, I just memorized
        where the pieces needed to go. It made the memorization considerably
        easier, because I&#x27;m not great at memorizing long lists anyway. I
        almost matched my current record on the first try, 7:44. Brent already
        told me that a couple of you memorize it this way. Did it cut off a lot

        (for example, to know the changes when you perform a cycle to reduce a
        larger cycle) it does cut your time off. I only use numbers in EP
        because it&#x27;s harder to memorize visually. for CO I follow along a
        cycle with my finger (it helps) once and memorize the image. For CO I
        decompose both faces in a 2/3/4 &quot;orientation cycle&quot; say the
        name of it (I have names for them). For EO I also use my fingers and I
        just imagine a cube with darker badly oriented edges. I always memorize
        the cube in less than a minute By the way, I would like to know the
        partial times for the other blindfolders of the forum, to know wich
        phase I need to improve the most. I&#x27;ve taken an averadge of 5
        solves: -memorization ~ 50secs -CO ~ 30 secs -EO ~ 45 secs -CP ~ 55 secs
        -EP ~ 60 secs I include parity in EP. This aproximatly adds up to my

        Hey everyone. I&#x27;ve read from several people on this group that they
        memorize the CP and EP steps without numbers, and just memorizing where
        the pieces go. I&#x27;ve recently started trying this and I have to say
        it has worked wonders for me. I&#x27;m still getting used to it, so my
        accuracy is only about 50% still, but my times when I am successful are
        very good, for me at least. I just wanted to say that I&#x27;ve tried it
        and like it better than using numbers and/or letters. It definitely uses
        much less mental strain when solving. One thing I really like about it
        is that some &quot;shapes&quot; the lines inside the cube where the
        pieces go come up fairly frequently, so I just memorize the overall
        shape and bam I&#x27;ve memorized the cycle for 4 corners in just a few
        seconds. For those who haven&#x27;t tried it yet, I recommend it. It
        helps to ease the mental strain during the solving stage. Chris

        I just had an interesting thought about this. If we don&#x27;t count
        &quot;too lucky&quot; solves, can we discard &quot;too unlucky&quot;
        solves as well? For speedsolving the 3x3 this doesn&#x27;t make much
        sense since the worst case (e.g. 7 steps for Fridrich) is what we expect
        anyway. But for blindfold it does. If we say &quot;10 or more
        correct&quot; (talking about orientation only!) is too lucky then we
        could say &quot;10 or more wrong&quot; is too unlucky. Of course this
        has the flaw that &quot;12 wrong&quot; seems to be bad as hell but you
        only need one algorithm for it and more generally people are using the
        superflip already if many edges are wrong so for them &quot;10 or more
        wrong&quot; is actually a lucky case. Also, if you orient and permute at
        the same time (maybe I should just talk about permuting the stickers)
        then you can&#x27;t count correct/wrong orientations of cubies at all,
        only of cycles. And since there usually aren&#x27;t many cycles all
        situations appear quite often. For example, if I have three edge-cycles,
        then the situations and their probabilities are: - 0 wrong: 1/4 cases -
        2 wrong: 3/4 cases - 1 or 3 wrong: impossible Even with four cycles this
        doesn&#x27;t get much better: - 0 wrong: 1/8 cases - 2 wrong: 6/8 cases
        - 4 wrong: 1/8 - 1 or 3 wrong: impossible Everything is still above 10%.

        It still works pretty well for all permutation in general, whether that
        be corner permutations or edge permutations. You don&#x27;t have to
        &quot;memorize shapes&quot; per se, but pay attention to the
        &quot;shape&quot; that is made (for instance, if the corners UBL, UFR,
        and DFL need to be cycled, I might think of a rocketship starting at UBL
        and then trying to curve around in a tight circle so he knocks into UFR
        and finally crashes and burns at DFL), haha

        when permuting and orienting at the same time, you&#x27;ll have to do
        the alg anyway, except if there is no perm (perm limits aplly). the
        &quot;too unlucky&quot; solves will only influence an avg not a single
        solve record, and acording to speedcubing.com new avg rules lucky (and
        unlucky) cases shouldn&#x27;t be discarded. 10/12 edges flipped is
        indeed lucky. Besides, a &quot;lucky&quot; thing is something that
        rarely happens, not just easier, so if permuting and orienting makes you
        have more &quot;luck&quot;, perhaps the method is better :) I think

        but do you memorize each 3-cycle separatly? because I just use visual
        memorizing for the corners, and is there&#x27;s a big cycle I memorize
        it all and just decide in which order I&#x27;ll solve it during the

        Well if you have the pathway of the permutation memorized then it
        isn&#x27;t difficult to figure out which ones you have permuted and
        which ones you have not. You just cycle the first then, then cycle the

        I don&#x27;t know if someone has already calculated this, I&#x27;m sure
        someone has, but here are the odds again for numbers of edges flipped.
        All you have to do is count the number of positions of each type and
        divide by the number of total positions. Odds: no edges flipped: 1
        position in 2048 ~ 0.049% 2 edges flipped: 66 positions in 2048 ~ 3.22%

        Yeah I do memorize both the corner and edge perms without numbers, and
        just by where they go. Here&#x27;s what I mean by shapes. One shape I
        see a lot sort of looks like a bowtie. (UL -> DR -> DL -> UR) is a
        &quot;bow-tie&quot;. Also you can have a similar type of shape using the
        middle layers. So (UB -> FL - > FR -> UL) is also a &quot;bow-tie&quot;.
        When I see a shape that comes up a lot I don&#x27;t say, hey
        there&#x27;s a bowtie, I just recognize the cycle, then I also think
        that it looks like that bowtie shape. That allows me to reinforce those
        pieces. So if I forget the cycle, I can remember that those 4 pieces are
        in a &quot;bowtie&quot; so I can figure out the cycle again if I forgot
        it. Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com, Brent

        Hi everybody, I am just back from business trip. Since a few months ago,
        I have been working on this. I do shadow-solving for all EP and CP.
        Starting from D cross. I also put middle edges in middle layer
        simultaneously as possible. In case of parity, I leave it on U. For CP,
        I use the following algorithms. Those are all derived from famous
        2-corners-swapping. L2-(L&#x27;BLB&#x27;)x3-(FR&#x27;F&#x27;R)x3-L2
        L2-(RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)x3-(R&#x27;BRB&#x27;)x3-L2
        L2-(RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)x3-L2 (+variations) You can swap 2-corner-pairs
        between U and D. Plus 3-cycles, you can replace all U-corners on U or
        (D). (You need to check parities which you should choose. ) That means
        three permutions is sufficient to remember for corners. In case you had
        three D-corners on U, you can put all D-corners on U. Then, replace all
        corners on the other side of corners where the cubbies to be. (Do you
        understand?) And then swap all 8 corners between U and D.
        (RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)x3-(LF&#x27;L&#x27;F)x3-(L&#x27;BLB&#x27;)x3-(FR&#x27;F&#x27;R)x3
        My success rate and time is getting better and better. During the
        flights, I practiced a lot. I hit 4 consecutive completions and I also
        hit 8 completions out of 10 attempts on another day. Time was
        approximately 5-8 min. Masayuki Akimoto P.S. If I keep cube in my hands,
        that helps a lot for memorizing EOs. So it is better to define leaving
        cube on table before starting as we do for speed.

        Thanks, I was just glad to have done it successfully. I was very much
        inspired by the nearly sub-minute times for division II attempts that
        we&#x27;ve seen on the Sunday blindfold contest, and mainly by Gaetan
        Guimond&#x27;s TV appearances where he solves the cube behind his back
        in very short times. I posted some of my process for how I did this at
        the speedsolvingrubikscube group if anyone is interested in my method
        for doing this. I think it would be possible to get times at around an
        hour with a lot of practice. I have a video of it on my computer but it
        is a huge file. Once I can shrink it down I will put it on my website.
        Hope to see some others try this, the anticipation when you pick up the
        cube and get ready to actually do the solve is intense! It is definitely
        a fun thing to try :) Chris --- In

        Chris, 18.65 on a blindfold solve!!! That really is a FANTASTIC
        achievement. My deepest respect for your concentration and meticulous
        working out of EVERY detail. Thanks for the detailed how-to info on the
        regular speed group but I really can&#x27;t imagine myself being able to
        figure- out an entire Friedrich solution in my head. That is AWESOME.

        Hey everyone, There was a lot of participation for the Sunday blindfold
        contest this week, which is awesome! Feel free to check out the results,
        and remember to compete in next week&#x27;s contest! Remember, Division
        I and Division II solves are due by the Wednesday after scrambles are
        posted. Any open division solves you choose to do aren&#x27;t due until
        the Friday after the contest starts. Thanks for those who competed in
        this week&#x27;s contest, and everyone remember to compete next week!
        It&#x27;s fun! Chris

        I just realized that the alg (M&#x27; y M&#x27; D M (D2 y&#x27;) M) that
        I&#x27;ve used earlier for speedsolving is useful for blindsolving. Add
        a D at the end and all it does is swap (UF,UR) and (DB,DL). Executed
        upside down should be faster but I&#x27;m used to do it this way ;-)

        Hi there My cube that i have been using for blindfold cubing is about 20
        years old, never been lubricated, and is starting to pop way too often.
        Has anyone got any suggestions on what kind of cube i should get? I
        would preferably be looking for one with the same colour scheme as i
        currently have: (U,D,R,L,F,B) = (White, Blue, Red, Orange, Green,

        Hi Chris, Yesterday, I found an algorithm that flips six edges by
        coincidence :). I don&#x27;t know if this is new. It&#x27;s a bit long,
        but I think it can be done very fast: (R B R&#x27; U) * 5. I do it like
        this: (l U l&#x27; U) * 5, moving the L and M layers/slices with my left
        hand, and doing the U move with my (right hand) index finger. The alg
        will flip all edges in U layer + the BL and BD edges. I hope it&#x27;s

        I&#x27;m sure someone could do it. All you&#x27;d have to do is find
        simple steps after forming the cube. The only really difficult part
        would be forming the cube, but with enough work, solving it by feel
        could become easy. I can form the cube blindfolded, without ever looking
        at it, so remembering and transforming the permutations of the pieces
        could be done. Stefan Pochman solved the Megaminx blindfolded, and
        people solve the 5x5x5,4x4x4,3x3x3, and 2x2x2 in one go, so
        theoretically, someone out there could be able to solve the Square-1.

        I have never seen this idea before, but it was quite useful for me who
        is still trying to master blindfold cubing. I scrambeled my cube as I
        allways do and then I solved just one layer looking at the cube. After
        that I memorized, blindfolded and solved the other two layers. This is
        quite different from doing only corners or only edges because now I have
        to use all steps in my solution, and its not possible to cheat with
        parity as you can do when doing only corners or edges. Also I got to see
        a solved cube once I took of my blindfold, a much nicer sight then just

        Hey everyone, So yeah I got pretty slack about practicing blindfolded
        solving after the US championship, but now I&#x27;m really starting to
        focus a lot of my practice time on BLD solving again. Anyway I&#x27;ve
        done a lot of thinking about memorizing and solving order, and just
        since this board has been quiet for a while I figured I would post what
        I found. I used to memorize in the order EO -> CO -> EP -> CP
        (E=edge,C=corner,P=permutation,O=orientation) Then I would solve in the
        order EO -> CO -> EP -> CP I used to average about 6-10 minutes using
        that technique. Recently I&#x27;ve been messing around with this order:
        Memorize: CP -> CO -> EP -> EO Solve: EO -> EP -> CO -> CP Some
        advantages and disadvantages of this I&#x27;ve seen are: Pros: You can
        just take a quick mental snapshot of the edge orientation during the
        memorizing, since it is the last step to memorize and the first step to
        solve. You do not have to have a very clear picture of this, so just
        glance at it then put on the blindfold. You solve in the reverse order
        that you memorized, so when solving the edge permutation, you have just
        recently memorized it and it is therefore still fresh in your mind. It
        being the biggest permutation step I feel it is best to get it over with
        at the beginning of the solve so that you don&#x27;t have to hold on to
        that much information while solving the corners. Cons: You have to make
        sure to memorize the corner permutation and orientations very well,
        since the edges act to interfere with the corner information so much.
        You can skim through the edge cycles, since you will solve them first
        anyway, but you have to really make sure to cement the corner cycles in
        your mind before moving on to memorizing the edges. ----------- Anyway
        having said that I now average about 4-5 minutes (2-5 minutes faster on
        average) and I&#x27;ve only just recently started practicing this order.
        Also my success rate has gone up significantly. Anyway I don&#x27;t know
        if order of memorizing and solving has been discussed before, but I
        figured I would bring it up. I&#x27;ve never read Olly&#x27;s or
        Richard&#x27;s tutorials, so those of you who learned that way I
        don&#x27;t know what orders you use. Also those of you who figured out
        your own systems I don&#x27;t know either. Anyway just figured I would
        try to start a discussion about order for the steps. There are 24^2=576
        possible orders to memorize and to solve the cube using the 4 step
        method. I figure one or a few of them have to be better than most of the
        others. This is my stab at trying to find a better order. Chris

        Personally I always start memorizing with the corner permutation -- this
        will quickly tell me if I am dealing with parity or not. If not then my
        corner perm is memorized. If so I look to see what quarter turn is most
        expeditious: U, U&#x27;, D, or D&#x27; and then memorize the new corner
        perm as if that move had already been executed. After corner perm I then
        move on to edge perm because that is the longest but at least I never
        need to worry about parity in this step. I then memorize both
        orientations by just looking at the white/yellow stickers (and
        green/blue for midges). For solving I tend to execute CO, EO, CP, EP. No
        real reason for it I just do it that way. Rob --- cmhardw

        Hi Rob and Chris, I don&#x27;t blidfolded solve much recently. But I
        realy want to do after I read Rob&#x27;s post. I normally memorize EP >
        CP > EO > CO Solve EO > CO > EP >CP + parity if present. I think I hear
        this from Macky, probably but he may solve in different way. Although I
        can recoginze parity when I memorize EP, I often spend a lot of time to
        fix parity if it is present. It is because I don&#x27;t know PLL. When I
        had parity, if I could set edges to be solved just by U or U&#x27;, I
        always felt lucky because I can forget the exact position of edges. I
        don&#x27;t intend to do so. It happens by chance. Anyway, I am not
        comfortable with parities. So I like Rob&#x27;s idea, that staring CP
        and canceling parity by simple turn if it is present. And I really would
        like to try this for the next time. Since the number of edegs are more
        than corners, to memorize EP is more difficult to memorize CP. So I used
        to start from memorizing EP. But parity is more important. I personally,
        don&#x27;t want to keep memory of orientations for long. I quickly
        memorize EO and CO (for EO I normally put my fingers on to the edges to
        be fixed), and solve them first quickly, and then forcus on EP and CP
        slowly. I don&#x27;t care too much for the order of solving EO and CO.
        Masayuki Akimoto P.S. I have been trying to set average for blindfolded
        solving 3x3x3 in the same rule as for speed, but I haven&#x27;t
        succeeded yet. To achieve this, really high success rate is required. I
        see Macky and Chris on the list for 2x2x2. Did anybody try this?

        Hi Chris, since the Dutch Cube Day is not far away, I decided to
        blindsolve the 3x3 each day and have done so three days in a row now
        (yaeh ;-). I do both memo and solve as EP EO CP CO. Cubies in correct
        position but with wrong orientation still give me trouble, but I hope
        this will get better with more practice. Since I&#x27;m lazy I memorize
        them as orientation, but I want to switch to pure permutation, at least

        My 18 second blindfolded video was inspired by Gaétan&#x27;s videos of
        his behind the back solves, so I know for a fact that it is possible
        given plenty of inspection time (2-2.5 hours). I have yet to try to do
        that same type of solve actually behind my back, but I am trying to lead
        up to that. I hope to also get a behind the back solve video one day. As
        far as Gaetan&#x27;s strategy I don&#x27;t know how he does it. I
        remember one video where he was on TV and handed the cube to the
        announcer who then did 2 moves on his cube! He still completed the solve
        successfully too, which was the amazing part. So even if he memorized
        the entire speed solve solution, he still would have only a few seconds
        to correctly identify which two faces were turned, then undo those two
        faces, then solve the cube.

        Hi Masayuki, Cancelling parity at the beginning really does make things
        a lot easier for solving by cycles. When I started blindfolding I always
        solved piece by piece. Parity didn&#x27;t really bother me for that
        techique but it maks a huge difference when you solve by cycles. The
        memorization becomes a little more difficult because you have to
        memorize the cycles not of the cube as you hold it but of the cube as
        you hold it with one quarter turn. Because any quarter turn of U or D
        will cancel the parity I try to turn the necessity into a virtue and use
        the quarter turn to put at least one corner in the correct position as
        well. Thus instead of always just (mentally) doing U and then memorizing
        whenever I get parity I see if doing U&#x27; or D or D&#x27; will solve
        parity AND give me a correct corner. It is a simple technique which
        works quite well, but don&#x27;t give me the credit for it. I first read
        about it in a posting that Stephan made several months ago. I would like
        to try an average 10 of 12 blindsolves - it sounds like fun and a real
        test of sustained focus but right now time is too short and I have
        little time for blindsolves or much cubing of any kind. Hopefully things
        will ease up because I have lots of unfinished cube business to take
        care of. Rob --- makimoto2000us &lt;makimoto@...-u.ac.jp> wrote: > Hi

        For piece by piece I used to &#x27;label&#x27; the corners 1 - 8
        starting from UFR and ending with DBL. Then I would memorize the whole
        cube. To solve I would first place #8, then #7 then #6 etc... i.e. I
        would only solve one piece at a time - it is very inefficient.
        Furthermore you need to update your mental image of the unsolved cube
        very frequently which can become a little tricky especially when dealing
        with 3-cycles of edges. Hope this makes sense. I find that solving
        permutation by cycles is much easier to memorize, much more efficient in
        the solve and requires much less updating of the mental image f the cube
        than piece by piece style. Rob --- Stefan Pochmann &lt;pochmann@...>

        Hi Rob, thanks for the explanation, that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been
        wondering about for quite some time. My conclusion is that the name
        &quot;piece by piece&quot; for that method is just terribly misleading.
        The emphasis should be on the fixed order in which you solve the pieces.
        I mean, you&#x27;re probably solving piece by piece as well (ok,
        you&#x27;re probably doing two at a time), the real difference is only
        that you walk along the cycles instead of a fixed order. Cheers! Stefan

        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of thinking about this lately,
        and wanted to bring up and old topic. I&#x27;ve been looking a lot into
        memorizing and solving orders for 3x3 blindfolded solving, and I think
        I&#x27;ve come up with a pretty good order. I used to memorize EO CO EP
        CP then solve EO CO EP CP Then I switched to memorizing as CP CO EP EO
        then solving as EO EP CO CP and my average dropped by a couple minutes
        on average. I posted about this order a while ago, and how I thought it
        was an improvement over my first order. Just recently I switched to
        memorizing as EP EO CP CO then solving as CO CP EO EP and my average has
        again dropped by a couple minutes on average. Here&#x27;s my thinking
        for why this new order works well. The edges are clearly the hardest
        part of a blindfolded solve (orientation and permutation) since there
        are 12 pieces instead of 8. So my strategy now is to memorize them
        first, so that I have more time to try to plan what I will do for the
        edges while doing other steps. While memorizing the edge cycles,
        I&#x27;m trying to decode the first one or two permutations that I will
        do. For the orientation I try to do the same for any setup moves
        necessary to get the pieces into an arrangement I know how to flip. Then
        I memorize the corners last, since they are the easiest. This lets you
        spend very little time on the actual memorization. It is the first step
        you will solve too, so you don&#x27;t have to memorize them well. You
        can just get it barely into your short term memory, put on the blindfold
        quickly, and start solving. Finally, while finishing the last algorithm
        of the corner permutation step, I recall my planning from the edges
        memorizing to remember what my setup moves are for the edge orientation,
        and what my first one or two permutations will be to start the cycles.
        Anyway there are 24 ways to memorize, and 24 ways to solve, and I truely
        believe that a select few of the total 576 memorizing and solving
        combinations are significantly better than the others based on the way
        the human brain memorizes a large amount of information quickly, as well
        as the idea of memorizing interference. Anyway, after playing around
        with a few different orders I personally like memorizing EP EO CP CO
        then solving in reverse. If anyone is interested in trying new

        I think we can reject 75% of the 576 different orders. I think that
        solving permutation before orientation would be really bad because then
        you would have to think about permutations when solving or memorizing
        orientations. Personally I do EP, CP, EO, CO and then OC, OE followed by
        permutation in some way. I think I usually do CP first and then EP.
        Usually without thinking about setting up for I nice parityfix. -----

        Assuming you always orient the pieces in an orbit before permuting them,
        then you only have 6 allowable solving orders. Say you orient both right
        at the start, there are two ways to do that: either EO CO or CO EO, then
        from there you can solve in either order. If you orient an orbit then
        solve it, then orient the other and solve it you can only do that 2 ways
        EO EP CO CP or CO CP EO EP Thus, the only allowable solving orders are
        EO CO EP CP EO CO CP EP CO EO EP CP CO EO CP EP CO CP EO EP EO EP CO CP
        There are still 24 ways to memorize though, so we&#x27;ve narrowed the
        576 cases down to 144, which you&#x27;re right is exactly 1/4. I would
        personally throw out cases where you memorize the EP and CP right next
        to eachother, since the permutations can cause interference with
        eachother if memorized all at the same time with nothing in between to
        separate them. I don&#x27;t memorize using numbers though, so maybe that
        is only a problem with my method. Assuming you throw out cases where EP
        and CP are next to eachother in memorization there are only 12 ways to
        memorize, so the number of orders overall would be only 72. I wish I
        knew more about the psychology and/or mechanics of memorization, but I
        really do think that maybe only 2,3 or 4 of those orders overall would
        be &quot;optimal&quot; so to speak. I&#x27;m sure one of the optimal
        orders would be better for a person than others, but I think that maybe
        only a few would be fast for everyone. To avoid interference when
        memorizing I like to make sure that I never memorize two orientation
        steps or two permutations steps in a row. That way it is easier to
        separate them in your head and recall later, IMHO of course. This would
        give only 8 memorizing orders, and with our 6 solving orders this would
        mean that we would have to look at 48 potential good orders. Still
        that&#x27;s 1/12 of what we started with. I don&#x27;t know maybe this
        doesn&#x27;t seem that interesting to everyone, but personally I think
        if we could isolate the orders that helped the most people be able to
        most easily memorize their cube then it would be easier to teach people
        to learn blindfolded solving. Plus those interested in speed blindfolded
        solving (I assume most of us) would be able to use our brains to the
        best of our abilities, making sure things don&#x27;t overlap in ways to
        decrease solving percentage or speed of recollection. Chris --- In

        average. Hi Chris, If your average dropped a couple of minutes again and
        again, I wonder how fast you can blindsolve on average now. I partly
        agree with your comment. I (at least) solve orientation and permution
        separately, but you may orient and permute simultaneously by your order.
        If you use three-cycles with either corner or edge flip, which are
        rarely used for blindfold solving to my knowledge, your solving order
        should have great advantage. It may be too complicated to remember
        without mistakes. But it may be the way to go. I still don&#x27;t want
        to keep in memory of both EO and CO. I am going to stick CP EP (EO CO)
        for memorization, (EO CO) CP EP for solution for a while. (Acutually, I
        just tried this order only a few times. I am still comfortable with the
        order EP CP (EO CO) for memorization.) Masayuki Akimoto P.S. This is not
        the topic for this forum. I have started to learn center first for big
        cubes since last July. I am getting comfortable with center-first now
        and getting almost same average I used to have with column first. I have
        to say center-first is great method for from beginners to experts.

        That&#x27;s about even and odd permutations, but what it comes down to
        just this: In general, you can not solve corners and edges
        independently. Most people are trying to do exactly that (i.e. first
        solving corners without changing edges, then solving edges without
        changing corners, or vice versa), but in 50% of all cases it&#x27;s just
        not possible. For example, solve the cube and then do a single U turn.
        Now try to solve all corners without changing the edges. It&#x27;s not
        possible. Best you can do is solve all but 2 corners. You can then solve
        all but 2 edges, not changing the corners further. So at the end, you
        still need to swap two corners and two edges. There are also other ways
        of dealing with this issue, of course... Cheers! Stefan --- In
