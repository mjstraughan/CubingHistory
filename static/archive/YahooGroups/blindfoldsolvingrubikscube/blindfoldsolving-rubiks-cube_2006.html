Yeah, I thought about that, too, but I decided it should be easy 
enough to handle on the fly. And you wouldn&#x27;t have the freedom to 
rotate the cube to solve many centers.

Cheers!

Have you tried solving it along the cycles?

          <div class="email-content">haha.

But to the original question&#x27;s answer, this is the wrong group to
post. This one discusses about solving the cube &quot;blindfolded&quot; . So i
dont think ur ready for that right now :)

As for solving the cube...just do a google search and you&#x27;ll get tons
of site that explain how to solve the cube..

Sachin.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m back from vacation, and seriously did use the whole time just to <br>
practice BLD solving.  I&#x27;m becoming an addict, it&#x27;s so much fun!<br>
<br>
I did break my 3x3 BLD record, but only by 2 seconds, and I <br>
successfully did the 5x5 BLD.  I came up with a new set of 24 nouns <br>
that are very similar to my orginal set, but still with absolutely <br>
no overlap.  This way I can use both sets for the 4x4 so I can do <br>
lots of consecutive solves without getting as much interference from <br>
stories from previous solves, and I use the original 24set for my X <br>
centers on the 5x5 and the new set for the +centers making my <br>
centers memorization both with the story method (which I like).<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m still focusing on the 4x4 mainly, but I want to get better at <br>
the 5x5 too.  My best memorization time for the 4x4 (not on a <br>
successful solve, but I traced the mistake and had only undone two <br>
setup moves in the wrong order) was 6:15.  I think I can improve <br>
this to sub-6 and my best sighted solve with my BLD method so far is <br>
about 5:10 so I&#x27;m inching towards sub-10, which I still think is <br>
possible.<br>
<br>
Also I found the reason why I couldn&#x27;t improve my 3x3 memorization.  <br>
When working out the cycles of both the corners and edges I count <br>
the number of pieces in each cycle, but I was doing this such as to <br>
give each piece in the cycle a number, which is useless since I <br>
don&#x27;t remember the number sequence.  Now I&#x27;m working on just quickly <br>
memorizing the shapes of the pieces and giving each group of 4-5 <br>
pieces a name to help me remember the shape.  I refuse to believe <br>
that my memory is not good enough, I&#x27;m trying to convince myself <br>
that I was using a dumb method and need to work on a better way of <br>
doing it.<br>
<br>
Anyway this message is getting long, but I just wanted to say that <br>
I&#x27;m back and have definitely found that I love BLD solving.<br>

Alright, good to be back and happy cubing all!<br>

I was so freaked out on the last solve because of the DNF that I<br>

didn&#x27;t care at all about the time, I just wanted to finally get an<br>
average.<br>
<br>
I had such a hard time towards the end since I still remembered bits<br>
and pieces of cycles and orientations from previous solves.  Often I<br>
had to sift through a cycle and think... no I&#x27;ve done that one<br>
already... no that was 2 solves ago...<br>
<br>
Man I don&#x27;t know how you guys do this and still keep getting fast<br>
times.  After the first 3 solves I couldn&#x27;t forget my earlier ones and<br>
just switched to a slow gear and went more carefully.  There was a lot<br>

          <div class="email-content">Unless someone&#x27;s holding a gun to your head demanding a blindfolded <br>
average of 10, you shouldn&#x27;t get too freaked out by the DNF.  No one <br>
expects you to get 12 solves in a row!  When I practice, I just solve a <br>
few times, or if time permitting, until I DNF which is usually by the <br>
sixth or seventh try.  Rarely, I make it past 12 because of fails or <br>
because it takes too much time.<br>
<br>
The problem with getting stressed out after the DNF is that when you <br>
finally do make it to 12 solves, the average you get is not <br>
representative of your actual average at all.  It defeats the whole <br>
purpose of &quot;getting an average&quot;!!  Chris, the first 7 solves before the <br>
DNF average to 3:06, which is almost a minute under what your final <br>
average turned out to be.<br>
<br>
And don&#x27;t worry, I always slow down after the first solve of a set. <br>
Something you could try is take a break in between BLD&#x27;s and do a quick <br>
speedsolve.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>

purpose of &quot;getting an average&quot;!!  Chris, the first 7 solves before the 
DNF average to 3:06, which is almost a minute under what your final 
average turned out to be.

And don&#x27;t worry, I always slow down after the first solve of a set. 
Something you could try is take a break in between BLD&#x27;s and do a quick 
speedsolve.

Have fun!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Leyan,

I definitely see what you&#x27;re saying, and in the future if I DNF an
average I won&#x27;t worry about it too much and will just try again
another time.

For me though if I try to go what I would consider my regular speed I
might be able to get an actual average of 12 once in 100 solves, but I
tend to get 2 or 3 DNFs for every 12 solves at least (yeah my accuracy
sucks).

I think for you superhumans it&#x27;s possible to take an average of 12 and
find out how fast you actually solve on average ;-)  For me just
getting an average of 12 is a feat in itself, though I hope to change
that with more practice.

But I do appreciate the tips though, I will definitely try to not
freak out if I get a DNF and maybe solve just a bit slower to hope for
a more representative average soon.

conclusion that I really hate the period between solves where I try to<br>

<br>
Anyone have any tips to speed this up?  I&#x27;d like to maximize my time<br>
as best I can, and currently I&#x27;d rather spend 5 minutes not solving<br>
and doing nothing than doing two solves right in a row and spending<br>
that extra 5 minutes during recall to sort through my current solve<br>
and the one just before it.  I&#x27;d prefer to limit this down to less<br>
than 5 minutes though.<br>
<br>
How much time are we given in a competition between solves for the<br>
bigger cubes?  None basically?  Do you go straight from one solve into<br>
the next since the big cube categories take up so much time?  Or is<br>
the best idea to solve for 100% accuracy and not take your second<br>
solve to save yourself for the other big cube?  You would then only<br>
use the 2nd solve for one cube just in case you don&#x27;t solve it the<br>
first time?<br>
<br>
Just wondering, I&#x27;d rather train for competitions now and be used to<br>
it when I get there than to be surprised.<br>
<br>
Stupid short term memory being better than I expected.  I wish I could<br>
just repress the memory of my previous cube or forget it outright or<br>
something so I can do lots of solves in a row.  Sigh...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow this really is interesting to think about.

Take memory experiments in general, they have you memorize a string of
say 10 words, and then they have you count backwards by 3&#x27;s or
something for a while, something to really occupy your mind.  Then
afterward they tell you to repeat the words.  The longer period of
time you have to count backwards, the less likely you are to recall
the information.

Also, rehearsal of a piece of information is what lodges it into your
memory.  Each part of the cycle on your cube was rehearsed really hard
during memorization, but also once again when you went through that
part of the cycle.

So you have to overcome a piece of information that is doubly
rehearsed, plus you will have adrenaline during a competition which
will help to rehearse it even further.

So clearly the way to forget the information is to do something that
is a lot of interference.  Maybe you could multiply two 4 digit
numbers in your head?  Whether or not you get the answer right doesn&#x27;t
matter, what matters is that you do something very mentally taxing
that is not cube related at all.  Afterward you will have a lot of
interference working against your doubly rehearsed last cube state.

I think I&#x27;m going to try this after my next solve.  I&#x27;ll try
multiplying two large numbers in my head, and try as best as I can to
get the answer correct.  After I&#x27;m done, if I feel I&#x27;ve forgotten my
last cube I&#x27;ll try another solve.  If I haven&#x27;t, I multiply two more
numbers.

Wow I think this might work for competitions too.  Or you could try to
factor a 4-5 digit number into it&#x27;s prime factorization or something,
just something to really occupy your mind while the judges are
scrambling your next cube.

Hmmm...  This sounds interesting to me, any ideas from anybody?

          <div class="email-content">I just thought of another way to try to create a lot of interference,
you could rehearse a lot of fake cycles in your head for some pretend
scramble.  Don&#x27;t actually try to memorize them, but track the motion
of locations across the cube the same way you would memorize, only in
an endless loop.

Research shows that memorizing a LOT of items that are all very
similar makes it very hard to remember them.  So why not absolutely
and completely overload your brain with edge cycles to the point that
it has to much similar information that you won&#x27;t remember any of what
you just did, and hopefully you&#x27;ll have created some major
interference helping you to forget your last solve.

Whoa gotta try this too....

The more members that are on the forum, the more appealing it will
become for unregistered people to register.

There isnt much point waiting for others to register first, you have
to make the step first, then others will follow. ;)

And yes i agree, forums are a lot more organised. Hence the reason i
decided to make one. :)

Hope to see you all on the forum.

Mmh..

For &quot;best times&quot; speedcubing.com does a great job.
For discussion if you want a forum twistypuzzles.com is great.

So why that new forum? Btw, why advertise it in the blindsolving group 
if there&#x27;s not even a blindsolving section in it?

Cheers!
Stefan

i always hold white on top and green in front. i thought this is the best<br>
but now i was thinking if it is better first to look if there is a better<br>
position to start from. <br>
first i orient the corners. therefor i use 4 moves, which are basically the<br>
same. it depends on the position of the corner, which one i use:<br>
UFR-position (clockwise): RF&#x27;R&#x27;F RF&#x27;R&#x27;F , then i put the next one at UFR<br>
position and do the same twice again (if also clockwise) or the invers for<br>
counterclockwise. <br>
if the corner is in the bottom layer i use: RU&#x27;R&#x27;U RU&#x27;R&#x27;U, which is easyer<br>
to execute and twists DFR counterclockwise. if i have to twist clocksie, i<br>
put the corner to DBR-position and do: R&#x27;URU&#x27; R&#x27;URU&#x27; (three times). <br>
i think there is a faster move to turn 3 corners clockwise (or<br>
counterclockwise) in the upper layer, but the move i use is easy and i dont<br>
have to think. <br>
edge-orieintation:  (RE)4 is the basic move. with set-up-moves i put two<br>
edges in the upper layer and do the move twice. i i have to switch 4 edges,<br>
i put them in UR, FR, FL and BL position and do the move once. <br>
cornerpermutation: when i memorize i look which peace in in UFR position, i<br>
jump to the target position and look which peace is there and so on until i<br>
end at position 1. this is called a cycle? with a set-up-move i put 3<br>
corners in the upper layer and do a 3-cycle and undo the setupmove. so 2<br>
corners get placed correctly and the third one ends up in UFR position. i go<br>
on until everything is correct (if no parity). <br>
edgeorientation: here the setupmoves seem to be easyer (i only use UDRL and<br>
F2B2 moves). my 3-cycle does UB-&gt;UR-&gt;UL-&gt;UB or counterclockwise, but UF<br>
stays where it is. thats why i start with UB position. if there is a parity<br>
i use the T-permutation. <br>
<br>
my best time with this method is 3:39 average about 5 minutes, but i only<br>
solve 70%. <br>
how can i get faster. i need 1:20 to memorize.  (1:10 is my record). <br>
are you only executing the moves faster or do you use another method? i know<br>
the pochmann-system, but i&#x27;m sure that cycles are faster.  <br>
<br>
questions:<br>
1) how many different moves do you use to orient/permute corners and edges<br>
2) how long are your set-up-moves?<br>
3) how many single moves are you doing during a solve?<br>
4) are you alway holding the same color on top and in front?<br>
5) how long do you memorize?<br>
6) are you nervous before competitions? i only solved at chalmer&#x27;s open in<br>
19 minutes. since that i try to go faster but alway DNS<br>
7) what is the difference between DNS and DNF?<br>
<br>
i hope i didn&#x27;t annoy you and you understand my bad english. <br>
<br>
thanks, thomas<br>

This is IMPOSSIBLE since my method IS a cycle-method.
(will this never end?)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Thomas,<br>
<br>
Answers to your questions are below,<br>
<br>
&gt; first i orient the corners. therefor i use 4 moves, which are<br>
basically the<br>
&gt; same. it depends on the position of the corner, which one i use:<br>
&gt; UFR-position (clockwise): RF&#x27;R&#x27;F RF&#x27;R&#x27;F , then i put the next one at UFR<br>
&gt; position and do the same twice again (if also clockwise) or the<br>
invers for<br>
&gt; counterclockwise. <br>
&gt; if the corner is in the bottom layer i use: RU&#x27;R&#x27;U RU&#x27;R&#x27;U, which is<br>
easyer<br>
&gt; to execute and twists DFR counterclockwise. if i have to twist<br>
clocksie, i<br>
&gt; put the corner to DBR-position and do: R&#x27;URU&#x27; R&#x27;URU&#x27; (three times). <br>
&gt; i think there is a faster move to turn 3 corners clockwise (or<br>
&gt; counterclockwise) in the upper layer, but the move i use is easy and<br>
i dont<br>
&gt; have to think. <br>
<br>
Wow I like your moves for flipping corners, I think I might start<br>
using your moves to flip corners in the D layer.  I&#x27;ve been using<br>
Macky&#x27;s way (or at least I learned it from Macky back at the US2004<br>
competition).  It twists three corners in either the L or R layer.<br>
<br>
Clockwise would be U&#x27; (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;) L U&#x27; (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;) L U&#x27;<br>
(R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;) L2<br>
<br>
Counterclockwise is U&#x27; (R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R) L U&#x27; (R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R) L U&#x27;<br>
(R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R) L2<br>
<br>
I also flip corners in groups too:<br>
<br>
2 corners:<br>
L&#x27; U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U R<br>
<br>
and the inverse is nice too<br>
R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R L U L&#x27; U L U2 L<br>
<br>
4 corners:<br>
L&#x27; U2 L U L&#x27; U&#x27; L U L&#x27; U L2 U&#x27; L U L U L U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L2<br>
<br>
and the inverse to flip the corners the other way (I prefer LU moves<br>
so reflect for RU if you like RU better).<br>
<br>
&gt; edge-orieintation:  (RE)4 is the basic move. with set-up-moves i put two<br>
&gt; edges in the upper layer and do the move twice. i i have to switch 4<br>
edges,<br>
&gt; i put them in UR, FR, FL and BL position and do the move once. <br>
<br>
For edges I also use the move you are using, and I would use it as<br>
(RE)x4 if the edges were setup like that, but I prefer to do it as<br>
(M&#x27;U)x4 since it can be executed so much faster.<br>
<br>
Also I recommend using more algs too<br>
<br>
6 flipper: (R B R&#x27; U)x5<br>
8 flipper: (r R d D)x3<br>
superflip: [(M&#x27;U)x4 z y]x3<br>
<br>
&gt; cornerpermutation: when i memorize i look which peace in in UFR<br>
position, i<br>
&gt; jump to the target position and look which peace is there and so on<br>
until i<br>
&gt; end at position 1. this is called a cycle? with a set-up-move i put 3<br>
&gt; corners in the upper layer and do a 3-cycle and undo the setupmove. so 2<br>
&gt; corners get placed correctly and the third one ends up in UFR<br>
position. i go<br>
&gt; on until everything is correct (if no parity). <br>
<br>
I do the same thing, I memorize via cycles (yes you are right, the<br>
term is cycles) and I solve them like you do.<br>
<br>
However, consider using cycles on the F or B or D face too.  Also<br>
don&#x27;t neglect moves like U2 M&#x27; U2 M as well.  Use commutators whenver<br>
you see them, since they tend to be shorter (you do a move to cycle<br>
them right there with no setup moves) . Do cycles on other faces than<br>
just U to minimize your setup moves.<br>
<br>
&gt; questions:<br>
&gt; 1) how many different moves do you use to orient/permute corners and<br>
edges<br>
<br>
I just use the same 3 cycles on other faces, and maybe a few more<br>
orientation algs than you do, but otherwise you are already on the<br>
right track.  Not sure what Macky and Leyan and Tyson and those guys<br>
use though.<br>
<br>
&gt; 2) how long are your set-up-moves?<br>
<br>
cycling: Max 2, Min 0 and I probably average about a little over 1<br>
setup move per alg execution.<br>
<br>
parity fix: I can get upwards of 7 moves or more, this is not my<br>
strongest point and is usually where I lose the most time.<br>
<br>
&gt; 3) how many single moves are you doing during a solve?<br>
<br>
I just did a sighted BLD solve and got 158 moves for all steps<br>
<br>
&gt; 4) are you alway holding the same color on top and in front?<br>
<br>
yes, I tried starting with the best corner orientation and switching<br>
centers, but probably not as much as I should have.  I should look<br>
into that again...<br>
<br>
&gt; 5) how long do you memorize?<br>
<br>
About as long as you do 1:20, close to 1:10 on a really good solve.  I<br>
think once ever I got 58 or 59.<br>
<br>
6) are you nervous before competitions? i only solved at chalmer&#x27;s<br>
open in 19 minutes. since that i try to go faster but alway DNS<br>
<br>
No, competitive BLD solving doesn&#x27;t make me nervous.  If you are given<br>
3 solves in the round you must solve with a roughly 78.5% accuracy<br>
rate in order to have a 99% chance of getting at least 1 successful<br>
solve in the round.  If you have 2 solves, then you must solve with<br>
exactly 90% accuracy rate to guarantee a 99% chance of getting at<br>
least one successful solve.  In competition I don&#x27;t take many risks<br>
and just try for 100% accuracy for my first solve, so I&#x27;m not very<br>
fast but I never have DNF&#x27;d all the solves in a round.  It depends on<br>
what you want out of your competitive solving.  I&#x27;ll probably never<br>
set a record this way, so maybe I should take more risks.<br>
<br>
&gt; 7) what is the difference between DNS and DNF?<br>
<br>
DNS = did not solve<br>
DNF = did not finish<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; i hope i didn&#x27;t annoy you and you understand my bad english. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m very excited right now, I just set a new personal best for the<br>
4x4x4 BLD, 12 minutes 4.64 seconds.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been trying lately to go very very very fast for both<br>
memorization and solving.  At first my solves were horrible, horrible<br>
DNFs with stuff out of place all over the cube.  Then as I got more<br>
used to the speed my solves turned into close DNFs with one or two<br>
traceable mistakes (one inner slice cleary one turn away from solved<br>
and 8 centers out of place).  Then I started getting solves with just<br>
two corners left at the end (forgetting corner parity) or just two<br>
edges swapped (forgetting to solve edge parity).  Well I&#x27;m glad that<br>
it finally paid off and I got a successful solve going full speed.<br>
<br>
For this solve I memorized in 6:15.xx and solved in rougly 5:49.  My<br>
best ever correct memorization (I DNFd the solve but it was a<br>
traceable mistake) was 4:50 and the 5:49 is my new best successful<br>
solve time.  Together they would have been a 10:39 so sub-10 does not<br>
seem so far away anymore.  I think I can memorize yet faster on<br>
average and I know I can solve faster with more practice.<br>
<br>
Many, many, many thanks to Dror for all the inspiration you give me,<br>
and also for teaching me how to BLD the 3x3x3 back in 2003 and getting<br>
me started in the first place ;-)  I seriously doubt we&#x27;ve heard the<br>
last of Dror on the 4x4x4 (and many others of you) but I&#x27;m glad to be<br>
back on top for a short while :-D<br>

<br>
thanks chris, you helped me al lot.<br>
here is an example how i solve a 3x3x3 BLD:<br>
<br>
Scrambling (white on top, orange in front): D&#x27; B2 L B&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; D2 F2 R B L&#x27;<br>

<br>
now hold white on top an green in front!<br>
<br>
corner orientation:<br>
upper layer: F&amp;#8217;RFR&amp;#8217; F&amp;#8217;RFR&amp;#8217; U2 RF&amp;#8217;R&amp;#8217;F<br>

(accidently i only have to cycle them clockwise)<br>
<br>
edge positions:<br>
D&amp;#8217;L2 U2 R2U&amp;#8217;R&amp;#8217;U&amp;#8217;RURURU&amp;#8217;R U2L2D<br>

<br>
the set-up-moves could be easier but usually i start the edge-cycles with<br>
UB-position and put the other two in UR and UL position, but here UB already<br>
was solved so i started with UF and i always had to do U2. i can execute the<br>
3-edge-cycle very fast when UF remains and the other 3 cycle.  <br>
<br>
if there is a parity i use the T-permutation. with R2 and L2-moves i first<br>
put the two corners in the upper layer and then do T. so usually UF and UB<br>
edges change places. then i do H (UF &lt;-&gt;UB and UR&lt;-&gt; UL, so with the set-up<br>
move i put the last two edges in UR and UL position). if both corners and<br>
edges are already in the upper layer i use a standard PLL. <br>
<br>
<br>
questions:<br>
1) how would you solve this example?<br>
2) what is a commutator?<br>
3) do you first memorize the positions and then the orientation or both at<br>
the same time?<br>
4) how long are your delays between algorithms?<br>
5) the night before the dutch cube day i invented the &quot;hybrid system&quot;: i<br>
start with cycles and if there is a problem i switch to pochmann-system.<br>
each system has advantages and disadvantages and i want to use the best.<br>
what do you think about that?<br>
<br>

  2) I don&#x27;t really know how to explain what&#x27;s a comutator, but basically is something like:<br>
  A B A&#x27; B&#x27;. You some move sequence, then another move, then the inverse of the first sequence, then the inverse of the move. Your and my ways to do CO are both commutators. You flip one corner, bring another to UFR, flip that other, and move U back. That&#x27;s a commutator.<br>
   <br>
  3) I first memorise orientations, and then permutations, in this order: CO, EO, CP, EP.<br>
   <br>
  4) Well, I&#x27;m not a BLD master, my best solve is 2:30.xx, so you shouldn&#x27;t take me as a parameter. I really don&#x27;t know my delays between algs. If I memorise well, I can solve very fast, almost without delays. But if I don&#x27;t memorise properly, it takes some time to remember the cycles : )<br>
   <br>
  5) I never gave Stefan&#x27;s method a real chance, but I think it can be fast. If you can deal with both method, you&#x27;re lucky. Just make use of that.<br>
   <br>
  Just my 1 cent<br>

<br>
&gt; 1) how would you solve this example?<br>
<br>
Hey Thomas,<br>
<br>
I actually did this solve as a BLD solve, and got 2:25.26 so my<br>
explanation below is just a reconstruction of how I actually solve.<br>
<br>
Memorization took 1:14.xx<br>
<br>
Solving:<br>
I solve edge orientation first and for that I did<br>
y E&#x27; R E&#x27; R E&#x27; R2 E R E R E R2 y&#x27;<br>
<br>
S&#x27; U S&#x27; U S&#x27; U S&#x27; U<br>
<br>
corner orientation:<br>
B L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U R B&#x27;<br>
<br>
z U&#x27; (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;) (L&#x27; U&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;) (L&#x27; U&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;<br>
R U R&#x27;) L2 z&#x27;<br>
<br>
corner permutation:<br>
U2 x (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) B2 (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) (R<br>
U&#x27; R&#x27; U) x&#x27;<br>
<br>
x&#x27; M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2 U2 x<br>
<br>
edge permutation:<br>
U S&#x27; U2 S D&#x27; S&#x27; U2 S D U&#x27;  (this is a commutator way to do an edge 3<br>
cycle, more on that below)<br>
<br>
B2 x2 L2 U&#x27; F&#x27; B L2 F B&#x27; U&#x27; L2 x2 B2<br>
<br>
F2 L2 x&#x27; L&#x27; U L&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U L U x F2<br>
<br>
U B&#x27; L U&#x27; L U L U L U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L2 B U&#x27;<br>
<br>
F R2 U&#x27; F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U&#x27; R2 F&#x27;<br>
<br>
&gt; 2) what is a commutator?<br>
<br>
A commutator is a permutation of the form X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27;  My first<br>
algorithm in the edge cycle was a commutator.<br>
<br>
U S&#x27; U2 S D&#x27; S&#x27; U2 S D U&#x27;<br>
<br>
Take away the U turns at the beginning and end, which are just a setup<br>
moves, and you get:<br>
<br>
S&#x27; U2 S D&#x27; S&#x27; U2 S D<br>
<br>
X = S&#x27; U2 S<br>
Y = D&#x27;<br>
<br>
and put them together as X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27; to get (S&#x27; U2 S) (D&#x27;) (S&#x27; U2 S) (D)<br>
<br>
Also, looking back it would have been more efficient to have X=D Y=(M<br>
U2 M&#x27;) and in 2 less moves I would have had (D) (M U2 M&#x27;) (D&#x27;) (M U2<br>
M&#x27;) for the same cycle.  Oh well, that&#x27;s why I need to practice more I<br>
guess.<br>
<br>
&gt; 3) do you first memorize the positions and then the orientation or<br>
both at<br>
&gt; the same time?<br>
<br>
No, Stefan&#x27;s method does this which is why it&#x27;s so fast, but I still<br>
memorize the permutation and orientation separately.  I memorize in<br>
the order EP CP CO EO and solve in reverse.<br>
<br>
&gt; 4) how long are your delays between algorithms?<br>
<br>
Not too long, for the solve above I must have delayed at most 3-4<br>
seconds between my slowest algs.  I tend to flow fairly nicely through<br>
the execution at maybe 1.5-2 seconds between algs most times.<br>
<br>
&gt; 5) the night before the dutch cube day i invented the &quot;hybrid system&quot;: i<br>
&gt; start with cycles and if there is a problem i switch to pochmann-system.<br>
&gt; each system has advantages and disadvantages and i want to use the best.<br>
&gt; what do you think about that?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve thought about using Stefan&#x27;s method for the corners, since I tend<br>
to take a long time to execute the CO step.  I think it sounds good,<br>
but sadly I also have not tried Stefan&#x27;s method as much as I should<br>
have by now.  I think I&#x27;ll still give it a shot though, I really like<br>
the idea of solving orientations and permutation together.<br>
<br>
&gt; thanks, thomas<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
Sure, hope this helps.<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S.  I tried your solve and it solved everything but left 4 of the<br>
edges flipped in their correct places?  Either way though I mean it<br>
looks like a good strategy to me.  Your solve felt like about the same<br>
number of alg executions I use, but I mean I&#x27;m no expert compared to<br>
the sub-2:00 guys.  I think the solve looks ok personally.<br>
<br>

How about...

52 moves for edges:
(S D2 S&#x27;) U (S D2 S&#x27;) U&#x27;
(M U&#x27; M&#x27;) D2 (M U M&#x27;) D2
R&#x27; (L&#x27; E&#x27; L) D2 (L&#x27; E L) D2 R
E (L U2 L&#x27;) E&#x27; (L U2 L&#x27;)
(R E2 R&#x27;) U&#x27; (R E2 R&#x27;) U

30 moves for corners:
U2 (F L D2 L&#x27; F&#x27;) U2 (F L D2 L&#x27; F&#x27;)
(B R B&#x27;) L&#x27; (B R&#x27; B&#x27;) L
(D&#x27; R B2 R&#x27; D) (R D&#x27; B2 D R&#x27;)

Ok ok, 5 cubies are left with bad orientation but that&#x27;s the fault of 
the scramble since I just don&#x27;t like correctly placed but badly 
oriented pieces and there were three of them...

Not like above :-)

Like above :-)

I disagree :-)

Yes, I do think my method is somewhat fast but not because of 
memorization (in fact, I don&#x27;t really consider memorization as part of 
&quot;my method&quot;). And only partly because I solve permutation and 
orientation at the same time.

The real essential element is that I solve one piece at a time, making 
setup moves very easy, eliminating the need for thinking (which is the 
main reason my brain made me come up with the method, I think).

Cheers!
Stefan

Mmh, that was wrong, actually it was 42 moves for edges, not 52. 
Here&#x27;s now a complete solve with those damn five pieces oriented as 
well:

42 for edges:
(S D2 S&#x27;) U (S D2 S&#x27;) U&#x27;
(M U&#x27; M&#x27;) D2 (M U M&#x27;) D2
R&#x27; (L&#x27; E&#x27; L) D2 (L&#x27; E L) D2 R
E (L U2 L&#x27;) E&#x27; (L U2 L&#x27;)
(R E2 R&#x27;) U&#x27; (R E2 R&#x27;) U

12 for orienting edges:
(R&#x27; U F&#x27; R U&#x27;) S (U R&#x27; F U&#x27; R) S&#x27;

30 for corners:
U2 (F L D2 L&#x27; F&#x27;) U2 (F L D2 L&#x27; F&#x27;)
(B R B&#x27;) L&#x27; (B R&#x27; B&#x27;) L
(D&#x27; R B2 R&#x27; D) (R D&#x27; B2 D R&#x27;)

15 for orienting corners:
(L2 U&#x27; L2 U L U&#x27; L U) (S2 L S L2 S&#x27; L S2)

Total 99 moves... yaeh, sub100!

Cheers!
Stefan

As far as video editing goes, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve been trying to work

but you&#x27;ll probibly fare better.

I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s something like Windows Movie Maker that&#x27;ll let you do it.

Thanks heh heh, you&#x27;re a big inspiration actually, now that I have
tried the 5x5x5 I have a better idea of how crazy fast your solve is
:-P  Still trying to improve there, but the 4x4 is my calling right now.

Also everyone, I recorded a video of me doing the 4x4x4 in 15:41.82
and am sending it to Frank Morris and Chris Hunt (whoever gets it
first I guess) to try to make it into less of a ridiculously huge file
format.

Hope to get this up soon, I included the memorization in the video
(all spellbounding 8:30 minutes of it lol) and also I said when I had
finished solving corners/edges/centers too during the solving phase.

Hope everyone likes it, I&#x27;ll try to get it into a viewable format as
soon as I can.

Hey Marcus,

I do the same as the 4x4 pretty much, I really just try to treat it as
a 4x4x4 with +centers and central edges.

I memorize as
Xcenters +centers wing-edges central-edge-permutation CP CO EO

and I solve in reverse.

I handle parities as, 3x3x3 corner and central edge parity I save for
the very, very end, after solving Xcenters.  During the 3x3x3 solve I
set them up for the T permutation and at the very end use the alg L&#x27;
U&#x27; L U L F&#x27; L2 U L U L&#x27; U&#x27; L F f R U&#x27; B R&#x27; U f&#x27; b&#x27; U&#x27; R B&#x27; U R&#x27; b
to solve the cube.

I handle wing-edge parity by saving it until I have solved the plus
centers.  I then setup the wingedges to use this move to solve them:
r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r&#x27; l d2 l&#x27; r&#x27; U r l d2 l&#x27; r&#x27; U&#x27;

This also swaps slU&lt;->srU but I don&#x27;t care since I&#x27;ve already solved
them, and I&#x27;m swapping indistinct pieces of the same color.

For centers I use a set of 24 nouns to memorize the Xcenters and make
a story.  For the +centers I use another set of 24 nouns to memorize
them as a story that mimics my first set, but is completely
non-overlapping.

I really like the story method, and I like my nouns from the 4x4, so I
just tried my best to come up with similar nouns that were still
different enough to not let me switch stories during a solve.

I use freestyle commutators to solve everything for the 5x5x5, except
corners where I do my regular stuff from 3x3x3 supercube BLD.

Not sure if that is helpful, but that&#x27;s how I do it.  I need to
practice more, since I have only attempted the 5x5 4 times and got it
successfully twice.  It&#x27;s very fun, but man oh man does 25 minutes
seem like a long ways away for me right now.

Hope that helps.  Again not sure if my method even compares to
whatever you&#x27;re using, but I put a lot of thought into it before
attempting a solve and I like doing it this way.  I think I just need
to practice more and get over my fear of trying to go fast during
memorization.

Hey Marcus,

My first solve was 53:57.96 I believe, and my current fastest (and
only other solve) is 47:01.00.

Also I just did a sighted 5x5x5 solve and got 12:43.92 is that good? 
How long does it take you to solve usually?  Also how long does it
take you to memorize?

I know that I usually memorize in 20-25 minutes from the few solves
I&#x27;ve done so far, so I *really* need to work on that area seeing as
how you&#x27;ve done the whole solve that fast and I only did half.  I
remember my first solve the memorization took 29:30 ish.

I mean I guess I can see memorizing in 12 minutes, but man you must be
brave to make sure you will remember the cycles :-)  I&#x27;m still too
chicken to go fast heh heh, but I guess the more you do it the more
used to the memorizing you get, so that makes sense.

Anyway just curious if my solve time is any good, I don&#x27;t even really
know the goals of what I should be shooting for.  I know my real solve
times must be double what my sighted solve just now was, since my real
solves are full of delays.  So I guess I should shoot for actually
getting a solve in around that time.

          <div class="email-content">Hey chris...if ur on windows then use VirtualDub to encode
movies...its free and supports a lot of formats to export into. U can
change the resolution, acpect ratio, bit rate...and many more things.

And on linux u can always use mencoder ...  it comes with the mplayer
media player. Its just great! You have to learn how to use it at the
start though.

          <div class="email-content">To those who orient corners first so that U/D stickers are all on U/D <br>
faces: Why on earth do you do that?<br>
<br>
Each corner *piece* and each corner *place* has a reference <br>
sticker/side/direction/whateverYouWannaCallIt. A *piece* is called <br>
&quot;correctly oriented&quot; iff its reference sticker is in the same <br>
direction as that of the *place*. Now what you&#x27;re doing is you define <br>
the reference directions to be all on U and D.<br>
<br>
What I suggest instead is to rotate all reference directions in the D <br>
layer clockwise. That results in these rules for &quot;correct <br>
orientation&quot;:<br>
<br>
- U corner in U layer must have U sticker on U face.<br>
- D corner in D layer must have D sticker on D face.<br>
- U corner in D layer must have U sticker clockwise from D face.<br>
- D corner in U layer must have D sticker anticlockwise from U face.<br>
<br>
The advantage of this is that any 3-cycle of corners that includes <br>
both U and D layers (which is 75% of the time) is a simple 8-move <br>
commutator.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

Wow, I really like this idea.  I also am starting to like using
commutators much more often, and am starting to switch edges from U to
D or vice versa via a commutator involving a S&#x27; U2 S or M U2 M&#x27; type
move in it.

Having said that I want to give your idea a try since it really won&#x27;t
take that much getting used to for memorizing corner orientation.

The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that now I can&#x27;t use the (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;)x3
move really anymore.  Even though this move is long I&#x27;ve found that it
lets me flow through the corner cycles very quickly (or at least it
feels quickly to me, I&#x27;m still slower than the big names, so maybe
that is my problem, using long moves).

However, the plus side is that your way allows all the corner cycles
to be easy commutators (which are all short!!).

So I think I&#x27;ll have an open mind and try a few blindfold solves your
way, I think it definitely has potential, plus I just plain like
commutators in general ;-)

Each corner *piece* and each corner *place* has a reference 
sticker/side/direction/whateverYouWannaCallIt. A *piece* is called 
&quot;correctly oriented&quot; iff its reference sticker is in the same 
direction as that of the *place*. Now what you&#x27;re doing is you define 
the reference directions to be all on U and D.

What I suggest instead is to rotate all reference directions in the D 
layer clockwise. That results in these rules for &quot;correct 
orientation&quot;:

- U corner in U layer must have U sticker on U face.
- D corner in D layer must have D sticker on D face.
- U corner in D layer must have U sticker clockwise from D face.
- D corner in U layer must have D sticker anticlockwise from U face.

The advantage of this is that any 3-cycle of corners that includes 
both U and D layers (which is 75% of the time) is a simple 8-move 
commutator.

Using the example Thomas posted...

Scramble:
D&#x27; B2 L B&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; D2 F2 R B L&#x27; B&#x27; U F R U2 F R U2 L2 D&#x27; U F&#x27; L R&#x27; B2 
F2 R U&#x27;

Orient L-corners:
(U&#x27; R U R&#x27;)2 L&#x27; (U&#x27; R U R&#x27;)2 L&#x27; (U&#x27; R U R&#x27;)2 L2

Orient R-corners:
(U L&#x27; U&#x27; L)2 R (L&#x27; U L U&#x27;)2 R (U L&#x27; U&#x27; L)2 R (L&#x27; U L U&#x27;)2 R

Permute corners:
(F&#x27; U&#x27; F) D&#x27; (F&#x27; U F) D
(R&#x27; D2 R) U2 (R&#x27; D2 R) U2
(R&#x27; D2 R) U (R&#x27; D2 R) U&#x27;

What do you think?

Stefan

  Well, I think I do that because that was the way I learned from Macky&#x27;s site...LOL...but, seriously, I think that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s easier to see the orientation pattern. I just search for the brightest stickers on the corners, and memorise the positions. Having U/D as reference is good for this, since you don&#x27;t have to check if the corner is from U or D. How do you think Tyson memorises everything in 50 seconds or less?...hehe
But your idea sounds good, with some practice I think it will be  worth...not sure...I need to practice more BLD...

After practicing a bit, I think I like the first one better since 
there&#x27;s not a single regrip. And it&#x27;s very repetitive, the right hand 
always goes back and forth every second move, and the left hand pulls 
U&#x27; every other move, except those few occasions where the right hand 
instead pulls U.

Modifying them a bit you also get more nice algs:
(R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2)2
((L U&#x27; L2 U) (L U&#x27; L U))2

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I started thinking today, and since I do my 5x5x5 central edges using<br>
freestlye commutators, then why the heck do I still use regular<br>
speedsolve 3 cycles for the 3x3x3 BLD for edges on a hard cycle?<br>
<br>
I can definitely see some cases where a speedsolve move would be<br>
faster, but some of my cases use 2 setups moves and a x2 cube<br>
rotation, when I could just easily use an 8 move commutator.<br>
<br>
Stefan actually your post about the new way to orient the corners got<br>
me thinking about this.  I&#x27;ve hit a plateau for the 3x3 with<br>
speedsolve 3 cycles, I want to try to start using my usual commutators<br>
in there for my harder cases and see if it helps.<br>
<br>
heh heh I like the flow of ideas on this forum, it&#x27;s really cool to<br>
get a new idea from someone and try to see how it would help.<br>
<br>
Not sure if this will work, but what&#x27;s the harm in trying right?<br>

Ok I changed my mind again. The second alg is faster for me, it flows 
very well. I just got too confused initially because of the repetion. 
Hey Chris, are these good enough to be comparable to 3*(R B&#x27; R&#x27; B)?

Cheers!

WOW! You solved corners without having memorized them! Gotta watch the 
video now, but have to get the popcorn first...

Ok, watched it now. I guess from 7:17 to 8:33 it&#x27;s not putting on the 
blindfold :-)

Hey, from 12:18 to 12:30 that&#x27;s a parity fix I guess? Cause all of a 
sudden you&#x27;re twisting like a madman there...

Great achievement and great video, thanks!! Maybe you&#x27;ve motivated me 
enough now to try 4x4, too...

Cheers!
Stefan

  Hey everyone,

Chris Hunt just posted the 4x4x4 BLD video I made to strangepuzzle.com 
so feel free to check it out.  It&#x27;s in the BLD section on the site.

Here are the steps going back and looking at the video again:

Memorize centers: 4:08
Memorize edges: 7:17
Start solving: 8:33
Corners solved: 9:09
Edges solved: 12:58
cube solved: 15:39

Thanks, but it really isn&#x27;t as hard as it might seem compared to 3x3 
BLD, it just takes longer really.  You should definitely try it, 
it&#x27;s a lot of fun!

For centers I use freestyle commutators, stuff like
[r U2 r&#x27;, d]
[r U2 r&#x27;, d2]
[r&#x27; u r, U]
[r&#x27; u r, U2]
[U2, f&#x27; u2 f]

Of course I also use setup moves to setup something like that if I 
have something weird.

I do have one question for the group here, I always get slowed down 
by ending my centers solve with something like lbD&lt;->rfU

How do you guys do something like that?

I would do
lbD&lt;->rfU
l&#x27; [r d2 r&#x27;, U&#x27;] l

Is there a faster way?  Maybe it&#x27;s not as hard as I&#x27;ve been thinking 
and I just need to get over it confusing me for some reason.

Chris

P.S.  Stefan what is your notation again to show a commutator with a 
setup move?  Would l&#x27; [r d2 r&#x27;, U&#x27;] l be [l : r d2 r&#x27;, U&#x27;] ?

  Well, in order to try to do the 4x4x4 BLD, I need somethings first:
  - wait for my 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 gets here, which should take a week
  - become a little better at the 4x4x4 (my best time so far is 3:30 or something like that, on gabbasoft&#x27;s program)
  - learn a little more about commutators....: )
   
  But someday I&#x27;ll try it...

If you did centers before edges you could use:
F2 (r U2 r U2) x (U2 r U2 l&#x27;) x&#x27; (U2 l U2 r2) F2

I would be interested in hearing what happened to your posts and what 
sort of errors you got?

Although I prefer the yahoo groups for their e-mail capabilities, if 
there is a big problem with them perhaps we should consider switching 
them to a real forum.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t exactly remember what it was. Not a 404 or connection problem. 
It was a yahoo group special error message, something like &quot;we don&#x27;t 
know where you&#x27;re coming from&quot;. Maybe it had to do with me opening two 
posts in different windows, then click &quot;reply&quot; on both, then had to 
log into both, then wrote and submitted both replies. So maybe it got 
confused between the separate windows and the logging in. No idea. If 
it ever happens again, I&#x27;ll let you know.

Now something slightly more interesting again: I&#x27;ve tried your 
edge-3-cycle-freeystyle again (sighted), I&#x27;m nowhere near your times 
but I&#x27;m getting better, now around 6 minutes and fewer errors. But I&#x27;m 
also trying to improve my own method, solving one edge at a time with 
the buffer/helper idea. The old way is setup the goal to FUr, apply 
the 3-cycle &quot;swap&quot; with 10 moves, then undo the setup moves. I&#x27;m 
trying without setup moves and 8-move 3-cycle &quot;swaps&quot; now. I&#x27;ll let 
you know once I have some results (right now I&#x27;m still defining the 
algs).

Cheers!
Stefan

Hey Stefan,<br>
<br>
I did another sighted average with my 4x4x4 BLD edges method.  I did <br>
it the way we did before, I solved the centers and corners as <br>
referrence points, but I still solved parity as if the centers were <br>
unsolved, same as I regularly do.<br>
<br>
1:54.45 1:57.50 1:44.42 1:47.78 1:58.41 2:02.82 1:39.90 (2:13.49) <br>
2:07.03 1:38.44 1:54.39 (1:28.94) = 1:52.51<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;ve gotten faster, but I&#x27;m still inconsistent with a <br>
44.55 second spread.  Ending with lots of odd cycles is faster for me <br>
but still slow.  I still use the (ABC) followed by (ADC) method to <br>
solve all but the last if there is parity and I only ever use that <br>
terrible parity alg once a solve, and then only if there is parity <br>
obviously.<br>
<br>
Again I would like to stress that this was a sighted average and that <br>
I don&#x27;t go quite that fast on real solves, since part of my time is <br>
spent on recall and I can&#x27;t transition from one cycle to the next as <br>
fast as with my eyes open.<br>
<br>
I think I still average pretty close to 1.0 for the setup moves.  <br>
Again often I do just one, sometimes I do 2 and just about as often as <br>
2 I do none.<br>
<br>
I use all the types of commutators before that I was like &quot;Oh man I <br>
need to learn that!&quot; so I have a pretty varied toolbelt to draw from <br>
now that I am also very used to using.<br>
<br>
I personally really like this method, since it uses so many fewer <br>
moves, and if practiced can be done quickly.  However your method uses <br>
less thought than mine by design and if it were equally as practiced <br>
and with your dexterity for alg execution, I think it could probably <br>
be equally as fast.  I&#x27;m going to say that BLD for edges is probably <br>
fast with either method if practiced well enough, so I don&#x27;t find one <br>
better than the other.<br>
<br>
I hope your method works out as well as freestyle cycles, it feels <br>
awesome to use your own idea.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m the first to try <br>
freestyle cycles, but I think even if it has been invented that I have <br>
added my own personal touch to it.  Just for that reason I like using <br>
my own personal version of it and will most likely just try to improve <br>
it.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Cheers!<br>
&gt; Stefan<br>
<br>
Happy cubing, and god luck with your method!  I hope it turns out to <br>
be fast!<br>

Hey Anssi,

please tell me you don&#x27;t use my earliest version, i.e. the one with 
just a single alg (the T-perm)... For edges that&#x27;s alright but for 
corners it sucks... I&#x27;m using this alg for corners now:
(R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R)

You also get these helpful variants &quot;for free&quot;:
(R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F)
(U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R2)

And some more with nice flowing setup moves, e.g.
F (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R) F&#x27;
R&#x27; F (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R) F&#x27; R
R2&#x27; F (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R) F&#x27; R2

But you&#x27;re faster with my method than I am, so maybe I should
shut up :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Yes, you don&#x27;t &quot;need&quot; to, but you *can*, because there are so few 
possibilities. Also, for edges every setup alg appears about every 
second solve, and for corners every third solve. So it&#x27;s not *that* 
different every time.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I have some questions for the 5x5x5 BLD if you all don&#x27;t mind.  I got<br>
another 5x5x5 BLD solve successfully today (which I am very happy<br>
about!) and did it in 47:45.55.  But my question is, it still takes me<br>
forever to memorize and to solve compared to what I feel I should be<br>
doing.  I tend to memorize the 4x4 in anywhere from low 5 minutes to<br>
high 7 minutes, so theoretically if I memorize the 4x4x4 within the<br>
5x5x5 in 7 minutes say, then I should theoretically memorize the<br>
+centers in 3 minutes and the central edges in 1:00 more I should be<br>
done memorizing by 11:00-12:00 minutes, somewhere around there.<br>
<br>
Well my solve today took me 23:22 to memorize.  Marcus did his entire<br>
solve in only about a minute and a half more so clearly I am wasting a<br>
whole lot of time somewhere.<br>
<br>
I still feel scared to go too fast for the 5x5x5 for both memorizing<br>
and solving.  Getting 45-50 minutes of quiet time to sit down and<br>
memorize and solve without being disturbed is sort of rare for me. <br>
Should I just try to get over this by going fast and just work through<br>
the initial DNFs?<br>
<br>
That was my strategy with the 4x4 pretty much, go slow at first to get<br>
used to the method, then when I felt I had an ok grasp of it I started<br>
to purposefully go really fast.  I had to work through long strings of<br>
DNFs but eventually I got to where that faster pace turned into my<br>
normal pace and my accuracy came back.<br>
<br>
Should I do this with the 5x5x5 too?  Marcus how did you get so<br>
incredibly fast at this?  I mean I can see how the theory (11-12 min<br>
for memorization and 11-12 min for the solve) can get to your time,<br>
now I just need to get rid of my tremendous number of delays.<br>
<br>
Dror, how do you memorize and solve so fast?  I&#x27;m still a good 10<br>
minutes at least from your solving times and don&#x27;t know how to whittle<br>
that time away.<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve recently started working on this, and have gotten a successful<br>
BLD centers solve with it so far.<br>
<br>
I just got a 13:09 DNF (grrrrr), but my mistake was in the edges and I<br>
was only off by 3 edges in a cycle.  For the centers I used a new<br>
approach and it worked and they were solved.<br>
<br>
Normally I always cycle a center to my next highest priority spot on<br>
the given face (each of the four spots has a rank, and I can tell<br>
which spots I am at when I cycle back to that face based on the last<br>
noun I&#x27;ve used in that category).<br>
<br>
Well this time I had a nice *almost* block transposition, so rather<br>
than have to cycle all of those pieces around and waste the<br>
opportunity, I used my center cycles to create the block transposition<br>
and then solved it at the end.  This shortened my main centers cycles<br>
by 3 pieces, which sped up my memorization considerably.<br>
<br>
Basically what I did was this, if I had had a green center at dfL I<br>
would have been able to do the block cycle (dbL + dfL) &lt;-&gt; (dlF +<br>
drF).  So instead of cycling all those wrong pieces once the priority<br>
got there on that face I cycled my first green piece to dfL and<br>
created that block cycle.  I then pretended the two blocks were solved<br>
for the rest of my centers cycle.  During the solve, I did the whole<br>
main centers cycle first, then at the very end finished with:<br>
[u (lr)2 u&#x27;, L2]<br>
<br>
I have used this strategy before if the blocks were already built, but<br>
I have never changed my centers cycles in order to setup a block cycle<br>
until now.<br>
<br>
I think this is a great trick to speed up memorization for the 4x4x4,<br>
I didn&#x27;t check the time but it felt much faster than usual since I had<br>
to create 3 less additions to my story with the nouns.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I post this since I think it is an awesome trick to use for<br>
the 4x4x4 centers, and I will definitely be using this in the future.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps for you other 4x4x4 BLD&#x27;ers,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been thinking about block centers cycling all day, and tonight I<br>
purposefully did it on a solve where I normally wouldn&#x27;t do anything<br>
special.  Man it works well!<br>
<br>
I just got a successful 12:04.48 4x4x4 BLD solve using it too!<br>
<br>
Again I created two clocks to be cycled at the very end for the<br>
centers.   If I had had a blue center piece at frU I would have had<br>
the group cycle (frU + brU)&lt;-&gt;(urB+drB).<br>
<br>
So instead of cycling through the pieces like I usually do I cycled my<br>
first blue piece in the cycle to frU and at the very end of my centers<br>
solve I ended with<br>
[l&#x27; (fb)2 l, B2] to solve the cube.<br>
<br>
What makes this technique so nice is that it really speeds up the<br>
centers memorization, and the solving goes a lot faster, since I cycle<br>
4 pieces to their correct spot in 1 commutator.<br>
<br>
The memorization for this solve took 5:25 (a very good time for me<br>
usually, so this shows how block memorizing helps) and the solve was<br>
about 6:40 which is also a very good solve for me too.<br>
<br>
This is definitely my new method and I will try to actively search for<br>
ways to form these blocks on every solve.  If you have a row of two<br>
same colored centers on the wrong face, then all you have to do is to<br>
create a block on the face where it belongs and you have a block cycle.<br>
<br>
Wow this technique rocks!  I want to turn it into a common approach<br>
rather than a trick to be used every now and then if possible.<br>
<br>
Has anyone else tried it yet?  It really does work nicely!<br>

Hey, let me try to help out some.

For corner permutation you can use the numbers 1-8.  You could have a
scheme such that say UBL=1 UBR=2 UFR=3 UFL=4 DBL=5 DBR=6 DFR=7 DFL=8
or of course any scheme you want.  That works quite well for helping
memorize.

The scheme I use when I use numbers is this
UBL=1 UBR=2 UFL=3 UFR=4 DBL=5 DBR=6 DFL=7 DFR=8

You want to use an algorithm that swaps two corners and two edges. 
The common one is the &quot;T-perm&quot; which is
R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;

Say them outloud as you do them, or even before too.  This way you use
your auditory memory to help you remember them.  So if my moves are F2
U then a three cycle, I&#x27;ll say &quot;F2 U&quot; as I do the moves, and while
doing the 3 cycle I think F2 U F2 U F2 U.....

> don&#x27;t get those.

There are different algs, so here is my version to do this (but there
are many).  If all three corners flip the same way use this below.

1) move the UFL corner to UFR using U&#x27;
2) flip the corner using either (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;) or (R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U
R) depending on which direction it goes
3) move the next corner on the L face to UFL with L
4) move the new UFL corner to UFR with U&#x27; and then do either (R U R&#x27;
U&#x27; R U R&#x27;) or (R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R) but do the same one as from #2
5) move the next L face corner to UFL with L
6) move UFL to UFR with U&#x27; and then do (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;) or (R&#x27; U R
U&#x27; R&#x27; U R) but again do the same as from #2 and #4
7) undo all your L turns with L2

To flip two corners opposite ways I use R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U R L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L
U&#x27; L&#x27; and its inverse.

I can work on writing out a solve, search in the archives maybe 50
messages back, there are 3-4 of us who did the same solve and wrote
out how we did it.

Hope that helps,
Chris

Ok so I&#x27;m really, really strongly considering doing the relay (5x5 +<br>
4x4 + 3x3 + 2x2).  I think I could do it if I went sufficiently slowly<br>

Based on my experience with memorizing stuff, I&#x27;d say to memorize the <br>
largest cube first (if you do it last it can mess up the smaller ones&#x27; <br>
memories) and to associate each cube with a separate idea. If you&#x27;re into <br>
stories, you should make the 5x5x5 story about a specific topic, the 4x4x4 <br>
about a different topic, etc. so you won&#x27;t confuse which story goes with <br>
which cube. After you&#x27;ve gone through all of the cubes once to memorize <br>
them, you should probably go over everything again to make sure you know it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris,<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s cool that you&#x27;re going for a relay -- they&#x27;re a lot of fun.  <br>
The trick is not to care about time, but memory.  Even if you&#x27;re <br>
fast at normal BLD, I learned that the same methods tend to break <br>
down in the long-term framework.  You need separate memorization <br>
methods.  Instead of relying on visual clues and brute-force memory <br>
(things which are effective for quick solves but inherently <br>
ineffective for a solve that may not be done for an hour or two <br>
after memorization), you should use methods that allow for <br>
information to be extracted.  The easiest example I can tell you is, <br>
again, the Binary method for memorizing edge orientations (you can <br>
also get away with using it for corner orientations!).  A simple <br>
three-word phrase is very easy to remember and will not be difficult <br>
to recall, even if you do the cube a day later after memorizing it, <br>
haha.  Slow and steady!<br>
<br>
Basically, you need to memorize your cubes using such methods, and <br>
then memorize them again to *ensure* you won&#x27;t have any memory <br>
mixups.  If you can honestly say to yourself, &quot;I could walk away <br>
from these cubes, come back in a few hours, and still be able to <br>
solve them blindfolded,&quot; then you are good to go.  Otherwise you may <br>
run into some trouble.<br>
<br>
The most cubes I&#x27;ve ever done was around 7 I think (different cubes <br>
though).  Here is my general experience: Don&#x27;t fret the 2x2x2 so <br>
much, as it&#x27;s just a 3x3x3 without the edges anyway (ie. 3x3x3 <br>
corner permutation and corner orientation methods are still <br>
sufficient.  The 2x2x2, using memory hooks, can be simplified to six <br>
words).  Your experience with 3x3x3 solving shouldn&#x27;t give you much <br>
trouble.  The real challenge comes in memorizing the 4x4x4 and <br>
5x5x5.  I REALLY recommend doing the cubes from largest from <br>
smallest. The larger cubes are much harder to memorize using &quot;data-<br>
derivation&quot; methods like the 3x3x3 Binary approach, and therefore <br>
they rely more on memory in the short-term.  I tried solving a big <br>
cube last one time and found that I had forgotten virtually half of <br>
the layout when I got to it! Solving the 5x5x5 and 4x4x4 first will <br>
take care of the short-term memory issues, and you&#x27;ll still have <br>
your memory hooks ready for the smaller cubes like the 3x3x3 and <br>
2x2x2.<br>
<br>
This may seem really obvious, but make sure you know what cube <br>
you&#x27;re picking up if you&#x27;re doing multiple cubes of the same type <br>
(eg. two 3x3x3&#x27;s).  You don&#x27;t want to pick up the second cube <br>
thinking it&#x27;s the first.  <br>
<br>
The first time you try a relay, you might, like me, find that ALL of <br>
them end up as DNF&#x27;s... don&#x27;t be upset if this happens :P Solving <br>
relays is a little different than solving cubes individually.  Just <br>
make sure your memory tricks are strong and you can start doing more <br>
and more without too much extra strain.<br>

Hi Chris,

I&#x27;ve only tried this once so my level of experience
isn&#x27;t all that high but ...

I found that memorizing all the &#x27;big cube specific&#x27;
information was surprisingly easy.  i.e. I had no
trouble at all with either memorizing or recalling the
long center and edge cycles for the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. 
Admittedly I invested a lot of time on them but they
presented no significant obstacle.

When it came to solving my biggest concern was with
what is arguably the easiest stage - OC and PC.  Not
that it was alll that difficult but that there were so
many of them so they were potentially easier to
intermingle and since they are so short and so simple
I found I invested a lot less time on them in the
actual memorization process.  I would agree with
Marcus that it would be advisable to go an extra step
and invent a word / story trigger for them just to be
sure that you have them.

And finally - RELAX !   Given everything else you can
do on a cube this is well within your abilities.  Go
slow, be patient.  Be extra careful when undoing set
up moves.  This one is not a race so GO SLOW and enjoy
a patient, methodical solve.  This one is yours for
the taking.

Best of luck,

Rob

<br>
I would also like to emphasize that your times speed up when you do <br>
not worry about time.  Any mental energy spent towards worrying about <br>
speed will only detract from the task at hand and cause potential <br>
memory mixups.  To start out just go for completion, no matter how <br>
long it takes.  After you approach relays this way for a while, your <br>
times will speed up whether or not you are actually trying to go <br>

Generally everybody, but the faster you are, the more interesting the 
data :-)

I&#x27;m preparing some scrambles now, will post them here then.

Ok... I have finished preparing the scrambles. I generated random cube 
states with a Java program and fed them into Cube Explorer&#x27;s Web 
Server interface.

The task now is only permuting the edges. Corners are solved. And 
edges are oriented according to &lt;U,D,L,R,F2,B2>. If you&#x27;re used to &lt;U,
D,L2,R2,F,B> then just do y before scrambling.

I&#x27;d be very interested especially in Tyson, Leyan, Macky &amp; Co, i.e. 
the very fast guys who have EP as one of their four steps. But 
everybody else is of course invited, too :-)

Oh, almost forgot: no inspection, i.e. you start right after 
scrambling.

Now here are plenty of scrambles:

The next dozen resulted in 36.50:

30.82 30.00 55.45 42.15 31.04 50.85 (57.31) 31.39 (25.32) 25.67 33.18

I still waste a lot of time, I hope to get down to 20-25 seconds 
average soon.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

Here is my average.  Although I solve like Tyson and Leyan and crew 
I would venture to guess that this is still a bad average for 
cycles+orient first if you are shooting for sub-2 solving.  All the 
30+ times were solves where I had to end with two odd cycles and use 
either the Z or H perm and LOTS of setup moves.  The 25.84 also 
ended in a Z but had easy setup moves.  I need to work on ending 
with parity, since corner+edge parity trips me up just as much.

(22.55) 26.64 24.77 28.58 29.18 38.87 45.03 32.47 37.49 (46.94) 
25.84 23.56 = 31.24

Great, thanks :-). My best rolling average of the remaining 26 
scrambles is 27.82:

26.77 21.48 (21.43) 23.74 29.20 33.40 25.95 29.93 (DNF) 28.27 27.92 
31.55

I had 4 DNFs but the average of the other 22 was 27.89. Best single 
was 20.32.

This is a lot of fun, especially now that I&#x27;m getting better at it. 
Going to generate more scrambles, can post them if someone is 
interested...

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

Two more averages here:

Scrambles 25-36
35.41 28.87 32.29 32.26 30.09 20.87 (38.99) 29.45 (20.51) 28.52 
24.45 32.80 = 29.50

Scrambles 37-48
25.24 (41.02) 36.39 33.34 30.58 15.63 24.43 22.73 39.89 (13.99) 
31.34 26.35 = 28.59

Still can&#x27;t get as fast as you on average heh heh, my slow times are 
really quite slow, but my fastest was 13.99 with a 15.63 second 
fastest.

This showed me that ending with two odd edge cycles is a *very* bad 
ending for me, I need to learn new ways to do this.  I may just go 
with my 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 BLD strategy of (ABC) then (ADC) to solve 
(AB)(CD) rather than try to solve all at once with a Z or H 
permutation.

If you generate more scrambles I will definitely do more averages, I 
need to work on this as well.

Chris

Wow, those are really awesome fast. Can you tell me which scrambles

No my time is below average -- for some reason I had edge orientations <br>
to take care of.  Perhaps I executed the scramble incorrectly or we <br>
use different systems for which two sides to treat as dual-spins only.<br>

Ok, I see... a 5-cycle and two 3-cycles... pretty much optimal for 
you. Not so nice for me, though. Tried it again now that I have more 
practice, got 27.04.

Two 5-cycles... again only 4 steps for you. Tried it again, got 24.40

I just finished the second set of 50 scrambles.

- 3 DNF, average of valid 47 was 25.78
- best/worst single 16.43/37.62
- best/worst rolling average 23.34/27/33:

16.89 20.81 27.41 (16.43) 25.30 27.88 26.43 23.13 19.24 22.14 (DNF) 
24.14

27.36 36.42 24.11 33.60 29.38 24.96 22.41 26.84 (37.62) (16.89) 20.81

<br>
After doing this exercise of timing 3x3x3 edges I think I know how a <br>
sub-2 is possible for me.  Me memorization is always 1:10-1:30 so in <br>
order to get a sub-2 I need to memorize in 1:00-1:10 (so go a little <br>
fast for me, but not so much so as to forget the info) and to solve <br>
at absolutely *break-neck* speed (for me).  That way if I do get a <br>
sub-20 or low 2x.xx EP and a fast CP, and CO and EO do not require <br>
setup moves, then I can get a sub-2 solve overall.<br>
<br>
In fact I got a 1:58.xx DNF where I messed up the CP near the end, <br>
but still the time was fast enough to be sub-2 had I done it <br>
correctly.<br>
<br>
I can&#x27;t get my memory as fast as Tyson and crew (and Marcus you also <br>
have an impressive memory to me) so I have to overcome it with <br>
solving extra, extra quickly in order to try for sub-2.<br>
<br>
I already did 4-5 solves in a row and am having a hard time <br>
forgetting my previous solves, so I&#x27;ll give it a break and try again <br>

          <div class="email-content">Very nice, thanks a lot! I like the short 3-cycles everywhere, 
especially the first one with no setup moves. Do you work with S-slice

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,

How fast do you memorize and solve usually?  I&#x27;ve been working on 
memorizing a lot lately and have improved, but I still have plateaud 
off at 1:10-1:20.  It seems reasonable to me that I could solve in 
less than 50 seconds sometimes so I am working on my solving to try 
for sub-2 (even once in a while would be more than awesome to me).

You have to give us regular guys a goal lol, what should I shoot for 
when it comes to my solving phase?

I just broke my 3x3x3 BLD record by half a second, so apparently 
trying to solve *incredibly* fast (for me) still lets me get 
successful solves, and now my new best time even.  I got a 2:11.06 
which has me very excited (not all that great compared to you 
though).

My breakdown was probably 1:10 to memorize since it felt fast for me 
and 1:01.06 to solve.  Again still not great, but if I can get the 
solving down by 10 more seconds I can hope for a sub-2 solve once in 
a while.  Still it&#x27;s disheartening to know that at my very best I&#x27;m 
still 20-30 seconds slower for each step probably than what the best 
do (you, Tyson, Leyan, Macky, etc..)

*sigh* one day, one day.  I refuse to believe I&#x27;m not capable, I&#x27;m 
just a slow learner lol.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,<br>
<br>
That move would be great too :P Certainly shorter.  I just tend to <br>
stick with things that rely on my right hand because I am not very <br>
good with using both, doing intricate moves all over.  I tend to stick <br>
with R, S, and U moves if I can because they take very little time for <br>
me (like, I could do a 10-move algorithm with those moves more quickly <br>
than a 7-move algorithm that might have an L, B, or D thrown in <br>
there).  Like there was a 3-cycle move that went like:<br>
<br>
R&#x27; U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R2 U R U R2 (11 moves), something like this takes <br>
maybe 2-3 seconds for me, but sometimes I can use a shorter algorithm:<br>
<br>
R2 U S&#x27; U2 S U R2 (7 moves), takes only like 1.5-2 seconds, assuming <br>
my crappy cube cooperates (it locks up a LOT)<br>
<br>
Now something like R2 U R2 F&#x27; B U2 F B&#x27; U&#x27; R2 is 10 moves long, one <br>
move shorter than the first alg posted, but it takes me a lot longer.  <br>
Usually short algs that use R S U are the best for me.<br>

Hey,

Sure -- I tend to break up the permuting algorithms into &quot;groups&quot; 
like, an alg for two adjacent edges  with an edge on the D layer, 
etc.  For 4 and 5 cycles I tend to use them only when the edges are 
on U and D (otherwise it gets too messy for me and it takes too long 
to figure out when I could just take care of it with two shorter 
cycles instead of longer algorithms).  

Say my cycle was (UF DL DF UR).  Looks a little ugly, but with some 
easy setup moves, I can just execute a &quot;4-cycle two-adjacent-U-layer 
2-adjacent D layer&quot; algorithm:

Such an algorithm in this case, I tend to keep things on the F and R 
faces.  I would do a D to get everything lined up.  From here, you 
have to think about what needs to go where, because in four-cycles, 
there are different ways to cycle such things).  In this case, I 
call this algorithm a &quot;QuadCounterClock&quot; because the pieces cycle in 
a visually-counterclockwise format.  My different algs for 2-
adjacent U and D consist of QuadCounterClock, QuadClock, 
QuadVerticalBow1 and 2, QuadHorizontalBow1 and 2, etc.  It may seem 
like a lot but it&#x27;s around the same difficulty as memorizing OLL.  
There are only so many cases you can get with 4-cycles on the U and 
D layer.   

Anyway in this case, I would use a QuadCounterClock

(setup D) R2 F&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; D R2 F2 R2 F&#x27; D&#x27; F D F&#x27; (unsetup D&#x27;)

Such an alg, you can see, is VERY easy to do with the right hand 
alone (something I have to have).  Now, most of my algs in the 4-
cycle range I set up such that the UFL and UFR corners switch.  If I 
can somehow get the already-incorrect corners in those spots, 
great.  Otherwise I just remember that those two are switched and 
deal with the rest of the cube accordingly.  Depending on where the 
bad corners are, there are methods you can apply to figure out how 
the numbers change when you switch these two corners.  I tend to not 
use 4/5 edge cyclers unless it&#x27;s painfully obvious, though.  
Sometimes it is just quicker to do a three-cycle and then fix the 
parity issue.

Wow! Congratulations! It shows you are DEFINITELY capable -- as with <br>
3x3x3 speedsolving, the more algorithms you know, and the more you <br>
practice, the easier it will all become.  I&#x27;m sure you can do the Sune <br>
without giving it a second thought -- you just need to treat <br>
blindfolding the same way, doing things until they become reflexive <br>
and you don&#x27;t need much extra time to think about it.  I think your <br>
execution times are wonderful and that you can cut a lot of time off <br>
with memory.<br>
<br>
For example, memorizing corner orientation: 2-5 seconds<br>
Memorizing corner permutations: 3-8 seconds<br>
Memorizing edge orientations: 2-3 seconds<br>
Memorizing edge permutations: I think 8-10 seconds is safe here<br>
<br>
<br>
So at the very best I could do maybe a 15 second memorization of the <br>
cube, with an upper threshold of around 26-30 seconds.  Sometimes it <br>
takes even more time if you have ugly parity issues or particularly <br>
long cycles (which in many cases can be cut down with 4/5 cycles to <br>
compensate for memorization time in order to equalize the averages).<br>
<br>
Solving takes me about a minute or so, give or take depending on the <br>
easiness of the cases.  <br>

          <div class="email-content">All right, so I wasn&#x27;t able to do 12 solves in a row.  Because the <br>
orientation isn&#x27;t correct, I stopped the timer a few times before <br>
actually finishing it, but it seems to me that sub-25 isn&#x27;t too hard.  <br>
With practice, sub-20 is doable.  The problem for me right now is that <br>
I&#x27;m not very good with looking ahead.  In other words, the cycle ABC, <br>
check the spot C wants to go to D, look in spot D to get ready for the <br>
next cycle while you do ABC.<br>
<br>
This is certainly a good exercise for reviewing how to do every cycle <br>
though.  I&#x27;ll work on it a bit more later.<br>

&gt; again<br>
&gt;  &gt;  in a little while.  I think I could realistically get sub-2 very<br>
&gt;  &gt;  soon if everything goes well on one solve.  Before I didn&#x27;t even <br>
&gt; see<br>
&gt;  &gt;  how it would be possible but now I know.<br>
&gt;  &gt;<br>
&gt;  &gt;  Aaaaaah so excited, I want sub-2 so badly!! :-D<br>

You might have to orient the cube as a whole by y before scrambling, 
then I&#x27;m fairly sure it&#x27;ll work for you.

Alright, thanks. Is there some understandable idea behind this, too? 
The 3-cycles tend to be easy understandable commutators, but I don&#x27;t 
see yet how to explain this one. It&#x27;s not a must, but if possible I 
prefer to use algs I understand, cause then they&#x27;re often flexible and 
I can modify them for different situations without having to use extra 
setup moves.

Also, how about this instead:
R L F L2 E&#x27; L2 F&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27;

Yeah I know, different side effect (centers instead of corners)... but 
still nice and short :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Yeah, that happens when people don&#x27;t read the thread subject :-)

Of course it&#x27;s also not perfectly correct anymore. When I started it, 
I was doing edge permutation and orientation at the same time. Then I 
discovered a beautiful improvement of my method if I orient first, and 
practiced that. I&#x27;ll go back to perm+orient now, cause I&#x27;d like to 
give it the same chances as permutation-only. Now that I have a good 
method to generate certain scrambles it&#x27;ll be much more fun than 
before. I often got the edges in 40 seconds, peaks were around 25 
seconds. Maybe 30 on average is possible for me.

Btw, how many &quot;steps&quot; (e.g. a 3-cycle with setup moves) do you usually 
need? I estimate about 12 for me, will do a computer simulation to 
find out, maybe I&#x27;ll also do it for 3-cycles...

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

For permutation of the edges?  Well, keep in mind these are easier 
because the corners are correct so no corner/edge parity.  Anyway, 
uh... maybe 5 cycles?  If the cycle length is 11, then you have 5 
cycles right?  Parity plays into it as well, but I think a 
mathematician out there should be able to calculate the average number 
of &quot;cycles&quot; necessary.

          <div class="email-content">&gt;...I think a <br>
&gt; mathematician out there should be able to calculate the average <br>
&gt;number <br>
&gt; of &quot;cycles&quot; necessary.<br>
&gt; <br>

<br>
While this has come up, I have a math question.  How many ways are <br>
there to group N objects into groups?<br>
<br>
For example if I have 10 objects, I can have all objects in one group, <br>
5 objects in two separate groups, 1 object each in 10 separate groups, <br>
5 groups with 2 objects each, etc..<br>
<br>
This problem leads into how many unique cycles can be made of either <br>
the corners or edges?<br>

Uh... What is the point of all this?  What are you trying to measure? 
In BLD, you won&#x27;t attempt the same solution you would for a sighted BLD 
solve.  For example, in dealing with even cycles during sighted BLD, I 
would be looking for another even cycle to pair up with it, but in BLD, 
I would have already found it in my memorization.  If you wanted to 
measure just the EP step of the BLD solution, you would want to allow 
some inspection time to memorize the edges first.

Are you sure? And how did you find out?

I would&#x27;ve expected to find this under &quot;number of partitions of a 
set&quot;. I computed the first few values:

1 -> 1
2 -> 2
3 -> 5
4 -> 15

Then entered &quot;1,2,5,15&quot; here:
http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/

Notice the Catalan numbers start 1,2,5,14 and then the difference 
between the two sequences grows larger and larger.

Cheers!
Stefan

Damn... too good, too good :-)

Hey, is it possible to import scrambles into JNetCube or how did you 
do that?

Ok, ok, maybe allowing some inspection would be better. I was trying 
to find out how long execution of EP takes people. But you&#x27;re right, 
in real blindsolves you&#x27;d have less decisions/planning during 
executions. On the other hand, it does count to your overall time 
anyway. On the other other hand, I guess it overlaps with memorizing, 
i.e. while you&#x27;re planning your brain is already working with it and 
you&#x27;re memorizing at the same time. That&#x27;s maybe a crucial difference 
between us. I don&#x27;t plan as much, I mainly react.

I made 50 more scrambles, but they&#x27;re all a special case. They&#x27;re all 
one long 11-cycle with the UB edge solved. For me that&#x27;s the nicest 
case except being more lucky with more solved edges. It&#x27;s always 10 
steps for me, and my brain can go auto-pilot. I started slowly but got 
faster at the end, best average was 19.51 seconds:
19.86 19.70 20.33 20.31 18.79 18.97 19.88 (18.24) 18.78 (20.44) 19.36 
19.09
Overall I had one DNF and average of the other 49 was 21.00 seconds.

Here are the scrambles for that, in case someone is interested. If 
you&#x27;d like to try it, feel free to do inspection and not count it into 
your time. I didn&#x27;t, but then again it wouldn&#x27;t help me at all anyway.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

Ok after reading your question I definitely started to doubt my 
answer.  I got my old textbook out from my combinatorics class and 
read up on Catalan numbers and Bell numbers (the sequence you 
mentioned).

I think here is what I was thinking when I said I thought the 
Catalan numbers counted the number of cycles.

I was thinking the interpretation of the Catalan numbers that they 
count the number of ways to multiply n elements assuming the 
commutative property doesn&#x27;t hold.

But the problem with that is that it doesn&#x27;t allow the permutations 
as if all the elements were in 1 set.

However, the Bell numbers count the number of ways to put the edge 
pieces into groups of varying sizes (so cycles), and then we would 
still need to permute the cycles for each grouping scheme.

So yeah I agree that the Catalan numbers don&#x27;t do the trick.

Let me see if I understand this correct.  B(4) = 15 so does that 
count the sets as below?

(1234)
(1)(2)(3)(4)
(12)(3)(4)
(13)(2)(4)
(14)(2)(3)
(23)(1)(4)
(24)(1)(3)
(34)(1)(2)
(123)(4)
(124)(3)
(134)(2)
(234)(1)
(12)(34)
(13)(24)
(14)(23)

If I did that correctly then I agree that this sequence would better 
apply to the cube.

Wow, that brings up another question, but I think I already have an 
answer.  B(12)=4213597 and B(8)=4140 but you don&#x27;t have to go 
through and permute the cycles in each of these types?  You would 
just count the number of possible permutations for each group?

So for example you could assume that the parity is odd and say that 
the edges have 12!/2 permutations, which would mean that there are 
12!/2 different cycles of edges with odd parity?  Also there would 
be 12!/2 with even parity so 12! total.  The same process gives 8! 
for corners.  So would we say that there are B(8) and B(12) unique 
ways to form cycles of the corners and edges respectively, but 8! 
and 12! unique cycles after permuting the pieces in each group 
counted by the Bell sequence?

If that is the case I don&#x27;t know why I was thinking this problem was 
so hard.  I do find it interesting that there are 4 213 597 ways to 
group the edges into cycles, I had no idea it would be that many.

Sorry for the rambling, I&#x27;m thinking out loud about this number 
sequence, since it&#x27;s new to me ;-)

  but congratz on your sub-2 time! I made one of them once, was 1:49. I really don&#x27;t know how, but was really fast...I still can&#x27;t see how the BLD &quot;masters&quot; are soooooooo fast with it...well, maybe they&#x27;re doing it longer than me...

Memorization took 5x.xx seconds, not sure which second in the 50&#x27;s, 
but the tenth digit was a 5 and it was definitely sub-min.

I ended with two odd cycles during the EP but it was alright becuase 
it only required 1 setup move (one of my rare ok times that I can 
handle that quickly).

Also I ended the corners with (UBL DBR) (UFR DFL) and just did it as 
(ABC) then (ADC) rather than something with weird setup moves to 
finish in one algorithm.

Yay!  I&#x27;m so happy to finally have done it!  I still don&#x27;t see how you 
guys do 30 seconds faster than that.  I have so much left to learn heh

One may use a small number of techniques but use them

a small number of them. I am currently interested in
using a small number of techniques and relying on
memory skills to guide me through.

So there is no definitive answer to the question.

          <div class="email-content">Ok so I know it hasn&#x27;t been released to the general public yet, but<br>
does anyone else have plans to tackle this beast?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been thinking about how I want to go about it, and here are my ideas.<br>
<br>
Memorization: I have two groups of 24 nouns that are non-overlapping,<br>
and I was thinking of using them to handle both Xcenter orbits (I&#x27;m<br>
thickheaded, is that the correct word?).  For the other two center<br>
orbits I will use numbers 1-24 and the letters A-X to form short words<br>
or sentences.  For the edges I am thinking that I will just memorize<br>
the shapes of cycles, but try to view the innermost orbit as always<br>
being in a narrow/small context and the outer ones as being in a<br>
wide/full context.<br>
<br>
Solving: I think actually executing [l[2] u[2]&#x27; l[2]&#x27; , U] might<br>
present some issues, anyone have any ideas?  I was thinking it might<br>
be better to not do any multi-layer turns and just turn inner faces,<br>
to ease any problems of overturning or forgetting whether or not you<br>
did a multi-layer turn?  Or maybe the cube won&#x27;t be that stable?  I<br>
guess we can&#x27;t answer this until someone tries out a 6x6x6 cube.<br>
<br>
Also, can we do this?  I issue this challenge to anyone wanting to do<br>
a 6x6x6.  Solve a 4x4x4 BLD, and a 5x5x5 BLD (except the corners, and<br>
central edges) and the centers of one more 4x4x4 BLD and time it. <br>
This will give you 4 center orbits, 2 edge oribts, and the corners of<br>
an even cube.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s not an exact match obviously since two center orbits on the 6x6x6<br>
are neither Xcenters or +centers in nature, but I guess it&#x27;s close<br>
enough.  Can we try to come up with a formal way for doing this so as<br>
to standardize our attempts?<br>
<br>
I would love to see what the times for a 6x6x6 will be like, and if<br>
anyone is willing to try with me, I say we start practicing so that<br>
when the real one gets here we will have an idea of how to handle this<br>
beast.<br>
<br>
Just some ideas, hope there are some takers.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I know this won&#x27;t be doing a real 6x6x6, and whoever does this weird 
hybrid relay I would not agree is the first to do a 6x6x6, but still I 
would like to try a simulated 6x6x6 solve using 2 4x4&#x27;s and a 5x5.

I just wanted to ask for a standardization of this hybrid relay so if 
anyone else tries it we all have some basis of comparison.

What I suggest is this, the 4 center orbits will be the center orbits 
of the two 4x4&#x27;s and the center orbits of the 5x5.  The corners will 
be the corners of one of the 4x4&#x27;s, and the edges will come from the 
edges of one of the 4x4&#x27;s and the edges of the 5x5.

I suggest this over having both edge orbits taken up from the 4x4&#x27;s 
since the edge orbits are of different widths from the center of a 
face on the 6x6, and doing edges on the 4x4 and 5x5 would make it feel 
like that.

It&#x27;s not a perfect match obviously, but if we can set a standard for 
the &quot;fake 6x6&quot; then I would like to try it.

I don&#x27;t think that anyone doing the fake 6x6 can claim the real 6x6, 
since the center orbits behave different on a 6x6, plus it&#x27;s just not 
the same as a real 6x6 period.  But it&#x27;s close, and I&#x27;d like to go 
ahead and get my brain used to thinking that hard before the real one 
comes out.

P.S.  Marcus yeah check out http://www.olympicube.com, they have a 
prototype and are just working on manufacturing it.

I think that someone should see if they can find the old Oinkleburger applet <br>
(or the one the 20x20x20 was solved on), and at least try memorizing (and <br>
maybe commutatoring [with eyes open, of course - just rely completely on <br>
memorization rather than on checking where pieces are]) on that. Then, when <br>
you actually get a 6x6x6 (as I know at least one of you will) you&#x27;ll be <br>
prepared for the memorization, and then you can just work on moving it <br>

This is the oinkleburger-applet. No keyboardcontrol as

practice.

I&#x27;d say around 20 &quot;steps&quot; with around 15 moves each, i.e. around 300 
moves.

Though, I&#x27;ve developed a new method for edges that has all the 
benefits of my &quot;old&quot; one and uses around 8 moves for each edge.

Edges maybe 1.5-2 minutes, corners maybe 1-1.5 minutes. But that 
doesn&#x27;t mean anything. I don&#x27;t practice much. And (for example) Jean 
Pons uses my method and memorizes (and also solves) much faster than 
me. He memorizes differently. I don&#x27;t consider the way I memorize to 
be a part of &quot;my method&quot;. I will point this out more clearly in the 
next version of my documentation.

> And how long does execution take you for each step?

Sighted I take around 40-45 seconds for edges and around 30 seconds 
for corners, I think. Though that&#x27;s more estimated, less measured, and 
also with my &quot;old&quot; method.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I have a math question.  I know this came up on the yahoo group a<br>
while back, but after lots of searching I couldn&#x27;t really find it.<br>
<br>
What was ever decided on the general definition of whether an edge is<br>
flipped or not?  And I mean the general definition, not restricting<br>
two opposite faces to only double turns and defining flips from there.<br>
<br>
The reason I ask, it seems odd to me that if I restrict R and L to<br>
only double turns as my definition of which edges are flipped, then<br>
doing the turn R from a solved cube results in four flipped edges. <br>
But if I restrict F and B in my mind, doing the turn R from solved<br>
leaves all 12 edges correctly oriented.  The only thing that has<br>
changed is my perception of the cube, so clearly our definition isn&#x27;t<br>
a general one.<br>
<br>
Again I know this has been discussed before, but I didn&#x27;t remember the<br>
result, and couldn&#x27;t find the old posts about it.<br>
<br>
The other part of this question is, when two people with different<br>
edge flip schemes get a scramble, do they have the same number of<br>
edges flipped in EO?  My guess is not always, and I site the above as<br>
my counter-example.<br>

I don&#x27;t know what you think I&#x27;m doing :-). What I&#x27;m doing is maybe 
what you think I&#x27;m doing, but I developed it further. And I reduced it 
a bit for fun to see how that would be. That&#x27;s how I permute those 
11-edge-cycles one edge at a time in 10 steps under 20 seconds, i.e. 
less than 2 seconds for recognition+setup+alg+setdown on sustained 
average. Oh, that sounded cool :-)

What *are* you thinking I&#x27;m doing? Maybe your thoughts differ from 
mine and lead to yet another method?

Cheers!
Stefan

It depends on what you want. Remember my recent idea to choose 
different reference directions for the D-corner orientations? It&#x27;s 
your own choice. I think it&#x27;s really a good idea to think in terms of 
reference directions. You can see another example for edges in that 
physics paper Edgardo posted two days or so. With that reference 
scheme, *every* quarter turn &quot;flips&quot; four edges.

Cheers!
Stefan

Really, at the core, edges are either oriented or not oriented <br>
relative to each other.  There is no &quot;absolutely oriented or <br>
nonoriented&quot; edge.  Therefore, you simply must use algs that take care <br>
of &quot;relative cases&quot;, and this is the quickest way to get things to <br>
where they belong (if your intent is to do multiple things at once or <br>
understand how to permute without caring about orientation).  In <br>
short, I don&#x27;t think there is a much quicker way than simply <br>
restricting sides, but you&#x27;ll find with time that this is hardly an <br>
obstacle with the right algorithms.  I hope I&#x27;ve understood your <br>

Hmm, what about an edge that&#x27;s at its goal position? Would you not say 
we can talk about it being oriented or not oriented independently of 
the other edges?

> permute without caring about orientation

Hmm, not caring about orientation would be a bad idea, wouldn&#x27;t it? 
Then it&#x27;s pure luck if you get it right...

Ah, you are right about that first point. Hmm.  My point though was, 
is that there are many perspectives -- what is oriented to one 
person&#x27;s method may not be for another.  Therefore, perhaps there is 
a lot less work we need to do in terms of orienting.


As for the second, I did not mean &quot;not caring&quot; about orientation, 
but rather moves that &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; about avoiding double-turning 
certain opposite sides.  For example, instead of figuring out how to 
permute three oriented edges, maybe it would help to have a permute 
move such that the &quot;middle edge&quot; in the permute cycle is not 
oriented.  Just an example of what I meant.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I don&#x27;t know what you think I&#x27;m doing :-). What I&#x27;m doing is maybe <br>
&gt; what you think I&#x27;m doing, but I developed it further. And I reduced it <br>
&gt; a bit for fun to see how that would be. That&#x27;s how I permute those <br>
&gt; 11-edge-cycles one edge at a time in 10 steps under 20 seconds, i.e. <br>
&gt; less than 2 seconds for recognition+setup+alg+setdown on sustained <br>
&gt; average. Oh, that sounded cool :-)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; What *are* you thinking I&#x27;m doing? Maybe your thoughts differ from <br>
&gt; mine and lead to yet another method?<br>
<br>
Heh heh I was thinking along the same lines as your 4x4x4 BLD method<br>
for edges.  You could have three pieces in the U layer, one as buffer,<br>
then the other piece that moves back and forth in the U layer, and the<br>
place where you always setup edges.  This way you could choose your<br>
setup moves to take care of orientation as well, giving only 20 ways<br>
to setup edges (10 edges to choose from and 2 ways to place each edge<br>
to take care of orientation too), which is pretty much the same as the<br>
number of setup moves your 4x4 method requires.<br>
<br>
You would have to handle the orientation and placement of the one edge<br>
that moves back and forth, but I suppose solving it first could take<br>
care of that.<br>
<br>
Again I&#x27;m just guessing here, not sure if this would work for that<br>
second buffer edge.<br>
<br>
I mean it sounds sort of like you might be doing this?  That is what<br>
first came into my head when you said that.<br>
<br>
What *are* you doing in fact? (if it&#x27;s not secret of course) :-)<br>

Yeah, you&#x27;re right, that&#x27;s kinda what I&#x27;m doing. Only better. Please 
pick one of the 50 scrambles I recently posted with 11-cycles, then 
I&#x27;ll show you how I solve that.

          <div class="email-content">I thought about that edge orientation scheme from the physics paper <br>
again. The one where every quarter turn flips the four edges involved. <br>
It&#x27;s cool, since it treats all faces equally! Now take this 3-cycle:<br>
M&#x27; U M U2 M&#x27; U M<br>
You can apply this 3-cycle *everywhere*, on every face from every <br>

Yea they sound like a lot of fun :D Life is just too crazy though.  
If there&#x27;s something this summer on the west coast, I could try.  
But here in college I have 5 classes plus 20 hours of work a week so 
free time is hard to come by.  Do you know if anything&#x27;s up this 
summer?

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Ok, so I&#x27;m learning about Stirling numbers of the second kind for <br>
the first time.<br>
<br>
These numbers are really cool for determining the types of cycles <br>
you can have on the cubes.<br>
<br>
So for example, say we have 12 pieces (edges on the 3x3) and I want <br>
to know how many ways we can group those into 2 cycles (forgetting <br>
the number of ways to permute the pieces in each grouping).<br>
<br>
This is equal to S(12,2) where S(n,k) = 1/k! * [sumation(i=0 to (k-<br>
1) : (-1)^i * (k choose i) * (k - i)^n )]<br>
<br>
This comes out to 2^11-1 = 2047<br>
<br>
This includes cycles like (1)(2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12) or (1 2 3 4 <br>
5 6)(7 8 9 10 11 12)<br>
<br>
For a simpler example S(4,2) = 7 which is the number of ways to <br>
group 4 objects into 2 groups.<br>
<br>
These 7 are<br>
(12)(34)<br>
(13)(24)<br>
(14)(23)<br>
(1)(234)<br>
(2)(134)<br>
(3)(124)<br>
(4)(123)<br>
<br>
The Bell numbers, which I mentioned earlier, are just summations of <br>
these Stirling numbers.  So the nth Bell number is the same as the <br>
sum of all S(n,k) as k goes from 1 to n.  So given 12 objects the <br>
12th Bell number counts how many possible ways there are to group <br>
them, from 1 group up to 12 groups, which is just a sum of the <br>
Stirling numbers S(12,k) k from 1 to 12.<br>
<br>
Ok, anyway I think this is really cool stuff since it&#x27;s all new to <br>
me.  I have been wondering how to find out how many ways there are <br>
to form types of cycles so I think it&#x27;s totally awesome to read up <br>
on how.  We never covered these numbers in my combinatorics class, <br>
but I&#x27;m reading about them from my textbook.<br>
<br>
Ok, I&#x27;m not sure if you other math people knew this already, but man <br>
is this cool stuff!  Is there anything else I should be looking into <br>
that relates to this type of math?  I&#x27;m still not entirely certain <br>
how the Stirling numbers of the second kind are formed, but I know <br>
it is done via difference sequences, which I&#x27;m also reading up on.<br>
<br>
Ok anyway just wanted to post, I love math!  Can&#x27;t wait until I <br>
understand this stuff better!<br>

Yep, that does help and I&#x27;ve been doing it for a while now :-). 
Though, I&#x27;m still too lazy to search for and learn an alg that flips 
DL which would be better than UL.

I keep flips until the very end. Then I flip what needs to be flipped, 
usually it&#x27;s only two edges. And if that doesn&#x27;t include my buffer 
than I guess I just flip the two instead of flipping them separately 
(using the buffer).

What do you mean &quot;which buffer edge&quot;? I only have one buffer edge :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi
   
  I&#x27;d solve it this way:

  (B2 U) R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L U L&#x27; U L (U&#x27; B2)

  x2 U L (4-FLIP) L&#x27; U&#x27; x2
   
  CP
  D2 R2 U2 (x&#x27; R U&#x27; R D2 R&#x27; U R D2 R2 x) U2 R2 D2 (long setup here..>_&lt;)
  D2 B2 D&#x27; B2 (L U&#x27; R D2 R&#x27; U L&#x27; R U&#x27; L D2 L&#x27; U R&#x27;) B2 D B2 D2 (yeah, bad setup...) 
   
  EO

  B2 L2 U (R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R U R U&#x27; R) U&#x27; L2 B2 
  hmm...this last one is bad...but I think I&#x27;d do:
  U&#x27; F&#x27; U R2 (x&#x27; F R U&#x27; R&#x27; U D R&#x27; D U&#x27; R&#x27; U R D2 x) R2 U&#x27; F U

  Hey I made a blindfold solving video.  Where can I upload it?



It uses the scramble:

D2 U R U L&#x27; U D2 R U L&#x27; D B2 U&#x27; D L&#x27; B&#x27; R2 D2 B2 U2 F2 D&#x27; F2 L F

How do you guys do on this scramble? I personally felt that it had 
ugly edges in virtually all aspects, but the corner orientation was 
nice.


I also made one where I slow down and explain my steps, but that video 
uses a different algorithm.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Well... I finally did the super4x4 BLD again.  The last time I tried<br>
it was a little over two years ago and my method was terrible.<br>
<br>
Here was my method from that first time (no joke).<br>
Solving:<br>
1) solve corner orientation<br>
2) do two swaps on edges with r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2<br>
r2 R L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; to pair up each edge with its<br>
adjacent pair.  Make sure to do this in such a way as to create the<br>
same parity in the 3x3x3 edge groups as the corners<br>
3) Solve the now created 3x3 edge cycles and corner cycles.<br>
4) Use [f&#x27; : r&#x27; u&#x27; r, U] and setup moves to solve centers.<br>
<br>
And yes that beautifully terrible method took me 5 hours and 30<br>
minutes to solve it lol.<br>
<br>
Well this time I just did my usual and got it in 35:09 minutes.<br>
<br>
It feels very cool to come full circle like this lol, and makes me<br>
wonder how I ever came up with that first method at all.  I think I<br>
didn&#x27;t even understand how exactly [f&#x27; : r&#x27; u&#x27; r, U] moved centers<br>
around, and just applied it as a memorized alg.<br>
<br>
Anyway I want to do the 5x5x5 supercube now.  I think it should be<br>
pretty similar to the regular 5x5x5.  I think part of the reason my<br>
super4x4 time was much slower was that I wasn&#x27;t able to do any tricks<br>
for the centers.  I started with 0 solved and wasn&#x27;t able to form any<br>
blocks and use block cycles at the end.<br>
<br>
Having tried both for the 4x4 I think the super4x4 is much harder.  It<br>
sucks to potentially have to solve 24 centers AND 24 edges (I maximize<br>
oriented corners, or try to place 2 corners correctly after the scramble).<br>
<br>
Ok, so my two cents are that the regular 4x4 is waaaaaaaay easier than<br>
the super4x4.  But again, that&#x27;s just my opinion.<br>

I managed to do two cubes the same way I do one. No memory techniques
for permutation cycles. Usually I memorize orientations last and solve
it first 
so I really dont memorize it to well. I memorized edge-flips with the help 
of three numbers (0-15) for each cube, that was the only trick I invented 
just for multiple cubes. Corner orientation was just crammed in to my mind 
as usual.

Solve order was:
CO 1, CO 2, EO 1, EO 2, CP/EP 1, CP/EP 2

I might be able to do more cubes this way. But really, you want some sort 
of memory system for this much data.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I really want to add a new section to my site relating to the big<br>
cubes BLD and am wondering what to add.<br>
<br>
My main goal with this is to get people to try the bigger cubes BLD. <br>
I mean I was perfectly content to do just the 3x3x3 for 2.5 years, but<br>
having tried the larger cubes now I think they are waaaaaaaaaay cooler<br>
than the 3x3, no question.<br>
<br>
So my target audience is people who have an interest in BLD, and maybe<br>
even already do the 3x3, but want to try something else.  I suppose I<br>
should maybe require the 3x3 BLD for this tutorial, since I don&#x27;t<br>
condone trying say the 5x5 right off the bat with no other BLD<br>
experience.  I&#x27;m sure it could be done, but why have that hard of a<br>
time learning it at first when you can learn the basics on a smaller cube?<br>
<br>
Also, since my method for solving the big cubes (other than sometimes<br>
CO and also CP) involves basically nothing but freestlye commutators,<br>
if I write a tutorial it would most likely turn into a tutorial about<br>
how to use freestyle commutators.<br>
<br>
Is there are any interest/use in something like this?  I have the<br>
interest and desire to write it, do you guys think anyone would want<br>
to read it?  Does anyone on this group want to read a &quot;so you can do<br>
the 3x3, here&#x27;s how to do the nxn&quot; tutorial?<br>
<br>
I just wanted to get some feedback, I very much so want to write this<br>
and make a new section on my page, but want to know what would be most<br>
appreciated way to write it?<br>
<br>
Also, should I post stuff about my memory techniques?  I guess for the<br>
larger cubes the memory aspect turns into a little bit more of an issue.<br>
<br>
Just curious, I know there are a lot of big cube BLD&#x27;ers already (and<br>
Richard Carr already has a tutorial) but I&#x27;d just like to make my<br>
contribution to this area of cubing as well.<br>
<br>
Any feedback would be very much appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I finally did the 5x5x5 supercube BLD :-D  This was my third try, and<br>
my very first try was a gut-wrenchingly close DNF (three +centers<br>
miscycled).  Anyway I&#x27;ve been saying forever that getting this cube<br>
was my biggest BLD aspiration, so I&#x27;m so crazy happy that I finally<br>
got there!! :-D<br>
<br>
The time was 53 minutes 25.35 seconds.  I think memorization took<br>
about 26 minutes something.<br>
<br>
Well...  I guess my next BLD goal is to do the relay of course, it<br>
seems ridiculously hard thinking about it right now, but I want to do<br>
it one day.  My ultimate goal now is the supercube relay.  I consider<br>
the supercubes much harder than the regular version now, because you<br>
have zero options for block cycling tricks for the centers, making<br>
everything just a plain track the cycle type solve.  So I think the<br>
supercube relay is the hardest thing that I think I still might be<br>
able to do *crosses fingers*<br>
<br>
Gotta work on the relay first. :-S<br>
<br>
Hope everyone else is doing well in their BLD&#x27;ing.  This category is<br>
so much fun, I really think I am addicted.  I love the feeling of<br>
seeing a solved cube after opening my eyes - it&#x27;s like a drug to me. :-)<br>

  Hey everyone,

I really want to add a new section to my site relating to the big
cubes BLD and am wondering what to add.

My main goal with this is to get people to try the bigger cubes BLD. 
I mean I was perfectly content to do just the 3x3x3 for 2.5 years, but
having tried the larger cubes now I think they are waaaaaaaaaay cooler
than the 3x3, no question.

So my target audience is people who have an interest in BLD, and maybe
even already do the 3x3, but want to try something else.  I suppose I
should maybe require the 3x3 BLD for this tutorial, since I don&#x27;t
condone trying say the 5x5 right off the bat with no other BLD
experience.  I&#x27;m sure it could be done, but why have that hard of a
time learning it at first when you can learn the basics on a smaller cube?

Also, since my method for solving the big cubes (other than sometimes
CO and also CP) involves basically nothing but freestlye commutators,
if I write a tutorial it would most likely turn into a tutorial about
how to use freestyle commutators.

Is there are any interest/use in something like this?  I have the
interest and desire to write it, do you guys think anyone would want
to read it?  Does anyone on this group want to read a &quot;so you can do
the 3x3, here&#x27;s how to do the nxn&quot; tutorial?

I just wanted to get some feedback, I very much so want to write this
and make a new section on my page, but want to know what would be most
appreciated way to write it?

Also, should I post stuff about my memory techniques?  I guess for the
larger cubes the memory aspect turns into a little bit more of an issue.

Just curious, I know there are a lot of big cube BLD&#x27;ers already (and
Richard Carr already has a tutorial) but I&#x27;d just like to make my
contribution to this area of cubing as well.

Any feedback would be very much appreciated.

Thanks,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I guess this is mainly directed at Marcus and Dror, but please anyone<br>
feel free to answer.<br>
<br>
Does anyone use block cycling for centers on the bigger cubes,<br>
particularly on the 5x5x5?<br>
<br>
For the 4x4x4 I try to only use one instance of block cycling per<br>
solve, and sometimes I won&#x27;t do anything special with blocks.  But I<br>
just had a 5x5x5 solve where I had a number of partial blocks and used<br>
my cycles to create 4 blocks setup in 2 transpositions.  Then at the<br>
very end I cycled the blocks back.  This considerably sped up my<br>
memorization, but sadly the solve was a DNF (corners were 2 moves away<br>
from solved, and 1 inner layer was off) so I assume I undid setup<br>
moves incorrectly at 2 different points.<br>
<br>
Anyway the reason I am posting is that block cycling seems to be much<br>
more likely on a 5x5x5, and this solve taught me that even creating<br>
multiple blocks (4 worked just fine for memorization for me) is not a<br>
big deal.<br>
<br>
I want to practice this more, I wish the solve wasn&#x27;t a DNF, but it<br>
seems like I messed up during the centers somewhere (after fixing<br>
those two setup move undo errors the corners, and all edge types were<br>
solved).<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;m curious what you guys think of block cycling?  I&#x27;m really<br>
starting to like it.  I&#x27;m still getting used to keeping track of which<br>
places in the pseudo-blocks I actually see I&#x27;ve already filled in by<br>
altering my cycle, but I think that won&#x27;t take long.<br>
<br>
This is cool, but I need more work on it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Aaaaaah!!!!  I just had a frustrating DNF for 4x4, but also very<br>
exciting.  Again it was a DNF, but I memorized in 5:00 exactly and the<br>
solve would have been 10:33 had I not screwed up (various pieces out<br>
of place).<br>
<br>
What I tried was to create 4 blocks on this solve (setup as 2<br>
transpositions).  This made the memorization for centers surprisingly<br>
quick, and also the solving was faster since I do less individual<br>
cycles and cycle most of the stuff to its correct spot with blocks at<br>
the end.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m convinced now that getting sub-10 on the 4x4x4 will absolutely<br>
require block cycling.  I think I will try to always use block cycling<br>
when I have a 2x1 row already built after the scramble, and if I have<br>
an opportunity to use multiple blocks (like on this solve) then I will<br>
go for it, rather than limit myself to only 1 instance of block cycling.<br>
<br>
Wow, this is exciting.  I treat BLD DNF&#x27;s like DNF&#x27;s on the magic,<br>
they show the direction you&#x27;re heading.  If you DNF a lot around a<br>
certain time, then you can expect to hope for a time in that area<br>
soon.  I hope to be in the 10 minute range soon, and reach my goal of<br>
sub-10 before the US2006 competition (July?).<br>
<br>
I know block cycling is the way to do it, and I&#x27;m going to seriously<br>
start working on training this and getting used to it.  I think this<br>
technique is invaluable for BLD on the bigger cubes.<br>

Here is an example solve.  Today is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried
creating multiple blocks on either the 4x4 or 5x5, so this is a more
regular example of what I&#x27;ve been doing.  However, I&#x27;m working on
getting used to do multiple blocks now, instead of just one instance
(or 2 blocks in a transposition) like in this example.

Hold your cube in the usual orientation you solve it into.

Do the scramble: b r b l2 u&#x27; U l d2 F2 U2 b2 B&#x27; D F f L2 F L d l&#x27; r&#x27; u
R2 U&#x27; f2 l&#x27; D l2 b R2 B2 R2 B2 D&#x27; u2 f&#x27; U D l2 u&#x27;

And after the scramble rotate the cube z2 (like F2) to maximize solved
centers.

There are now 9 solved centers, but using blocks you can consider 12
of them to be solved already.

There is a block on [Rub + Rdb] that belongs on F.  And the piece Fru
belongs on R.  This is perfect.  So during the center cycles I&#x27;m going
to cycle another R face color piece next to the piece at Fru and
create 2 blocks setup in a transposition.

Here is the cycle I will do on the centers:
(Ubl Dbl Ful Fdl Ubr Bdr Lub Dfr Ruf Dfl Bdl Rdf Luf)

Basically I cycle through the centers normally until I get to a piece
that belongs on R.  At this point I cycle that R face center next to
Fru and then continue the rest of the cycle as normal.

(Ubl Dbl ...

This part is just normal cycling, but the piece in Dbl is an R face
color piece, so I cycle it to Ful to place it next to Fru and create a
block.

...Ful... (see above, creates a block)

... Fdl Ubr Bdr Lub Dfr Ruf Dfl Bdl Rdf Luf)
This is just finishing off the center cycle as per normal.

Here are the actual moves I would do to solve centers.

(Ubl Dbl Ful Fdl Ubr Bdr Lub Dfr Ruf Dfl Bdl Rdf Luf)

(Ubl Dbl Ful): D2 r2 U b u b&#x27; U&#x27; b u&#x27; b&#x27; r2 D2
(Ubl Fdl Ubr): r d2 r&#x27; U r d2 r&#x27; U&#x27;
(Ubl Bdr Lub): L&#x27; r&#x27; U r d&#x27; r&#x27; U&#x27; r d L
(Ubl Dfr Ruf): r2 l u l&#x27; U&#x27; l u&#x27; l&#x27; U r2
(Ubl Dfl Bdl): U2 l U2 r&#x27; d2 r U2 r&#x27; d2 r l&#x27; U2
(Ubl Rdf Luf): L2 f&#x27; U2 f d2 f&#x27; U2 f d2 L2

And now this leaves only the [Rbu + Rbd] and [Luf + Lur] blocks to
cycle.  And you finish them with R&#x27; d&#x27; (fb)2 d F2 d&#x27; (fb)2 d F2 R

That&#x27;s the basic idea, but again it gets much cooler when you get 3
blocks and 3 cycle them, or create 4 blocks.  Again I&#x27;m new to doing
multiple blocks, but I have a feeling this is a worthwhile thing to
spend my time on, since it speeds up memorization so much, and makes
the solving faster too (you solve 3 pieces from your original scramble
at once).

Was just wondering if you guys used this?  I was still wondering
whether I was going to fully commit to this and pursue it, but that
10:33 DNF on 4x4 convinced me that it is worth it :-D

Let me know what you think still, I think this is a great way to
improve BLD solving and memorization times for the bigger cubes.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">I must have done the scramble wrong, or I still don&#x27;t get it.  Why 
did I have to rotate the cube around so my U is D and so forth? Do I 
use my old scheme or this one now? For instance, my front face is 
red, and I can see two red centers on Rub and Rdb, but I don&#x27;t see 
where you see a next switch?

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

Thanks for the responses.  The tutorial is in the works now, and I&#x27;ll
try to include everything I do, including the new stuff about multiple
block solving for the centers.

Not sure how long it will take, but my aim is quality rather than
expediency, but I&#x27;ll post here once I&#x27;m done.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Here is my most complicated block cycle solve to date.  The centers<br>
were successful on this solve, and the whole cube almost, but I did<br>
one of the edge 3 cycles the wrong direction, leaving 3 edges out of<br>
place at the end.<br>
<br>
Here was the scramble:<br>
 l&#x27; B&#x27; b U2 r&#x27; U&#x27; f&#x27; L F l2 d&#x27; U&#x27; r2 R2 u2 D&#x27; B D&#x27; f2 u2 R f&#x27; b L&#x27; B&#x27;<br>
R&#x27; L F2 D r2 B2 d2 r&#x27; f L2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R d&#x27; F&#x27;<br>
<br>
After the scramble I rotated as y z2 (do them in that order, do y<br>
first followed by z2) to maximize solved centers and setup a block<br>
cycle type solve.<br>
<br>
I did the edge cycles like this<br>
(lfU -&gt; lbD -&gt; urB -&gt; rbD -&gt; lfD -&gt; dbR) and the other cycle was<br>
(rfU -&gt; drB -&gt; dbL -&gt; ulB)<br>
<br>
This purposefully cycles two center pieces to an incorrect location in<br>
order to setup a block cycle.<br>
<br>
The moves I did to follow those cycles were<br>
(lfU -&gt; lbD -&gt; urB) : D&#x27; r&#x27; U f u f&#x27; U&#x27; f u&#x27; f&#x27; r D<br>
(lfU -&gt; rbD -&gt; lfD) : l F2 l&#x27; b u&#x27; b&#x27; D2 b u b&#x27; D2 l F2 l&#x27;<br>
(lfU -&gt; dbR) : l&#x27; d l U l&#x27; d&#x27; l U&#x27;<br>
<br>
then for the second cycle<br>
(rfU -&gt; drB -&gt; dbL) : d b&#x27; U2 b d&#x27; b&#x27; U2 b<br>
(rfU -&gt; ulB) : b&#x27; u b U2 b&#x27; u&#x27; b U2<br>
<br>
If you look at the centers now they don&#x27;t appear to be even close to<br>
solved, but I did this to setup two easy block cycles.  The cycles are<br>
<br>
[fuL + fdL] -&gt; [ulF + dlF] -&gt; [buR + bdR]<br>
<br>
and also [urF + drF] &lt;-&gt; [frD + brD]<br>
<br>
To finish the centers I then did <br>
<br>
[fuL + fdL] -&gt; [ulF + dlF] -&gt; [buR + bdR] : b2 L&#x27; (fb&#x27;) l&#x27; (f&#x27;b) L2<br>
(fb&#x27;) l (f&#x27;b) L&#x27; b2<br>
<br>
And to solve centers all that is left is<br>
[urF + drF] &lt;-&gt; [frD + brD] : l&#x27; (fb&#x27;)2 l F2 l&#x27; (fb&#x27;)2 l F2<br>
<br>
Memorization took 4:00 exactly for edges, which is a bit slow for me,<br>
but I&#x27;m still getting used to seeing these block cycles.  In terms of<br>
amount of stuff memorized I only had 10 things to place into a story<br>
and 2 other pieces of information to remember (how each of the two<br>
block cycles worked).  To me this felt like having 12 centers already<br>
solved (since I effectively had to handle 10 centers and 2 extra<br>
pieces of information).<br>
<br>
Adding a new item into a story and remembering a block cycle take<br>
about the same amount of time for me, so memorizing this solve felt to<br>
me like a solve with half the centers already solved.  I need to get<br>
used to how exactly to cycle the centers to create the blocks (that&#x27;s<br>
what took me a while for this solve) but still, this technique is<br>
very, very cool!  All I need is more practice to really be able to<br>
take advantage of this.<br>
<br>
I get the feeling that I&#x27;m the only one excited about block cycling, I<br>
hope I&#x27;m not reinventing the wheel or anything, but based on basically<br>
no response to my last post I decided to try and post one more<br>
example.  And yes I double checked all the moves (and the scramble)<br>
and everything works.<br>
<br>
If no one cares about block cycling I&#x27;ll just keep to myself and try<br>
to develop it, but I would much rather share and throw ideas back and<br>
forth with others.<br>
<br>
Hope to get a response this time,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

I just wanted to write a follow up, I think I was a bit too harsh 
below about asking for a response from this post.  I guess I was 
just a bit too excited about this technique, and was frustrated at 
only one response, and I guess I didn&#x27;t explain my first post about 
it as well as I should have.

I&#x27;m still working on new techniques and ways to handle different 
situations.  Mike Bennett also led me to a really innovative way to 
handle the corner parity using the same idea from block centers on 
the edges.  This would of course, only happen when you had 1 edge 
group already solved, and also had corner parity, but when that 
happens this technique would really speed things up a bit.

There&#x27;s a lot to be done in 4x4 BLD land heh heh, trying to learn as 
many of these tricks as I can.  If anyone wants to talk 4x4 BLD 
strategies either post here or send me an e-mail, I&#x27;ve got a lot of 
ideas that I want to share with someone in order to try for my goal 
of a sub-10 minute solve (including the memorization).

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been working on this cube a lot lately, so far I&#x27;m down to <br>
4:27.xx as my best time.  I&#x27;ve found that the memorization is of <br>
course the same as for the 3x3x3, except memorizing for EO and also <br>
that you have to remember the center twists too.<br>
<br>
I solve exactly like I solve the centralmost edges and centers and <br>
corners on the 5x5x5 supercube, which is to rotate the centers <br>
correctly first (leaving the U center 1 counterclockwise twist from <br>
solved during parity solves) and then to use all center safe algs <br>
after that point.<br>
<br>
For EP I like algs like these:<br>
R2 U F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U2 F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U R2<br>
<br>
(M U2 M&#x27; U2)x2<br>
<br>
and for EO I use<br>
R&#x27; E&#x27; R2 E2 R&#x27; U2 R E2 R2 E R U2<br>
<br>
Has anyone tried this cube out yet?  Is there a better way to <br>
solve?  Handling the edges takes a lot of time on this cube because <br>
of the longer moves for EP and also for EO.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve started resorting to using commutators more like what I&#x27;d use <br>
on the 4x4x4 rather than doing regular stuff for the edges, since <br>
everything has to be center safe.<br>
<br>
Just trying to start a conversation in case anyone has also tried <br>
this cube and has cool ideas for it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Ok so I am fully committed to using blocks in the centers and edges<br>
when solving a larger cube BLD, and many thanks to Mike Bennett for<br>
getting me to think beyond centers only :-)<br>
<br>
Also, today I had another idea (stemmed from talking with Mike about<br>
blocks), why not combine centers AND edges into a block?<br>
<br>
U (Rr) U&#x27; l&#x27; U (Rr)&#x27; U&#x27; l<br>
<br>
which is just<br>
[U (Rr) U&#x27;, l&#x27;]<br>
<br>
is a cycle that moves blocks consisting of 1 edge and 1 center.<br>
<br>
I think these will be a bit harder to see/setup for, but then again I<br>
thought that about center blocks when I first started too.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m going to try to see if combining centers and edges into blocks<br>
will help things at all, that would be a great way to speed up 2 parts<br>
of the solve with one short trick.<br>
<br>
Anyone else have any cool experiences with/ideas about blocks?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think 2x2x1 blocks would be easier to make and also spot when
solving.  These would consist of two edges and two centers.

Examples:
[(l&#x27;r) (U)2 (lr&#x27;), (Dd)2]
[(Rr)&#x27; D2 (Rr), (du&#x27;)]
[(Rr) U2 (Rr)&#x27;, (d2u2)]

also why forget about including corners into a 2x2x1 block just for fun?
[(Rr) U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27;, (Dd)&#x27;]
[(Bb)2, (Rr) F (Rr)&#x27;]

Wow there is so much here to look into and learn about!  Heh heh I&#x27;m
like a kid in a candy store, solving this way is so cool!

<br>
Ok so I know the spirit of a BLD solve is that you are to have no<br>

realized that a flaw in the design makes tactile information possible<br>
on the 5x5x5.<br>
<br>
I just got done from a 5x5x5 BLD solve where I lost track of the<br>
orientation in the middle of executing a PLL alg that I don&#x27;t usually<br>
use in a BLD solve.  However, because the centers are uneven on a<br>
rubiks.com 5x5x5 (some stick out more than others) I was able to find<br>
my original orientation based on whether the center caps sticking out<br>
felt &quot;right&quot; or not.<br>
<br>
So again this is cheating by the true spirit of things, but it&#x27;s a<br>
flaw that can&#x27;t exactly be fixed without fixing the problem of uneven<br>
center caps on a 5x5x5 cube from rubiks.com<br>
<br>
Should this be accounted for in the WCA rules somehow?  Or is this<br>
just a flaw that is inherent to doing a BLD solve on a physical<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

Marcus:
The centralmost pieces are not perfectly even with the rest of the
center pieces surrounding it unless you are just damn lucky and have
an awesome 5x5x5 cube.  I have 5 rubiks.com 5x5x5 cubes and I just
checked them all and even on my best quality one, meaning as few
centers as possible are uneven, I can still feel minute differences in
the &quot;height&quot; of each centralmost center above the others surrounding
it - enough to tell which face is which even with a blindfold on.

Tyson:
I don&#x27;t mean to sound like I am cheating or whatever when I do BLD
solves, again I just discovered this last night when I lost the
orientation on my solve and panicked.  Honestly, if I were in a
competition and lost my orientation and panicked - and I had memorized
for 20 minutes or more and was most of the way through my solve and
was feeling good about what the time might be, I could get away with
it without a judge noticing.  I could easily act like I was thinking
about a hard next freestlye commutator cycle and tap the edge pieces I
would be &quot;cycling&quot; a lot as if I were thinking about setup moves, but
in fact be feeling the heights of the center caps to see if my
orientation was correct.

And even if you were looking for someone trying to figure out a hard
cycle then rotating the cube afterward instead of doing moves, I could
just do a 3 cycle on edges after finding the orientation, then undo it
with a different commutator (wow that 3 cycle was hard!  see how many
moves it took to solve it?) then after getting back to where I started
rotate the cube correctly.

Maybe I have bad luck with buying 5x5&#x27;s, but I swear I don&#x27;t modify
them to have the centers be noticeable.  I just buy them, break them
in with some twisting for a week or so, lube them after that once
every few days until they&#x27;re nice.  Again though, even on my best
quality 5x5x5 there are enough differences in the heights of the
centralmost centers for me to be able to discern my correct
orientation should I get lost during a solve.

Again I&#x27;m not trying to make it sound like every 5x5x5 solver ever
cheats, but I noticed this and was able to use tactile information to
help me fix an error in my solve when, by the spirit of things, that
shouldn&#x27;t be possible.

that&#x27;s awesome that you&#x27;re getting interested in 4x4x4 BLD, it&#x27;s 
very addicting so be aware of that :-)  If you&#x27;re not hooked 
already, you will be soon I expect :-)

>> Anyone up for teaching me centres?

If you like Stefan&#x27;s method for edges, then there&#x27;s no reason not to 
use it for centers too.

I personally would use this setup, let lbU and rbU be your two 
buffer spots (or the buffer and the other center I guess) and then 
let ufL be the center spot to where you setup your locations.

For instance if rbU is the buffer center and you want to move it to 
dbR, then setup dbR to ufL by doing R&#x27; u2 then do U r&#x27; u&#x27; r U&#x27; r&#x27; u 
r then undo your setup with u2 R

Also you can have the position to where you move all your edges be 
Ufl instead of Luf and keep all three locations in the same layer.

So if you want to move rbU to dbR this way you can do R2 f&#x27; as setup 
then do the move f l u l&#x27; U&#x27; l u&#x27; l&#x27; U f&#x27; then undo the setup with f 
R2.

One thing to think about, if you are going to try for very fast 
times eventually, you have to think about moving blocks of centers 
also rather then just one or two at a time all the time.  If the 
cube sets up a block for you (or a situation where a small amount of 
cycling on your part can make a number of blocks), then it is easier 
to save those blocks to the end, them move them.  This will save 
time over moving all the pieces to their spots using regular cycles 
and move them individually.

In terms of solving centers though, I see no reason not to use 
Stefan&#x27;s method for those too, it would be just as good and just as 
fast as using his method for the edges is.  Just be open minded 
about taking advanage of blocks.  Also the same can go for edges 
too, even with Stefan&#x27;s method.  If the cube gives you a block, take 
advantage of that!  It will make your solve easier and speed up your 
memorization too (more stuff is memorized with the &quot;chunking&quot; idea 
rather than the linear cycle idea so it goes much faster).

Let us know how your 4x4 BLD exploits go :-)

Actually the 8 L/R centers are all easy to solve without setup moves, 
in this case with:
l&#x27; d l U&#x27; l&#x27; d&#x27; l U

I have to try that, too... I think the 3-cycle &quot;fake swap&quot; itself is 
of course slower to execute, but setup moves should generally be 
shorter. And of course there are fewer centers to solve...

          <div class="email-content">A-ha! Thanks guys.

I&#x27;m using U r&#x27; u&#x27; r U&#x27; r&#x27; u r and r&#x27; u&#x27; r U r&#x27; u r U&#x27; to solve the
centres. And I&#x27;m gonan practise doing them today and maybe do a solve
with them BLD tonight. Only the centres though. Sighted full oslves
and just centres BLD for now, then further in teh week I&#x27;ll go for the
whole thing.

Chris: I basically just wanna solve the damn thing right now, then we
can move onto crazy stuff like moving blocks of things. :)

What I&#x27;ve noticed is that you can skip out a big chunk of moves. You
can repeat the same alg as the last one when you know both buffer
pieces are the same, when they&#x27;re the same and you wanna put another
piece in that&#x27;s the same you skip that alg and do nothing, etc, etc.
There are so many shortcuts here :) I go thte idea from skipping a
move when you get he helper stuck in the buffer in the edges method.

I can see how supercube would be easyer for memorising but harder for
execution... no shortcuts with the super.

Another great thing.. you always have at least one buffer piece solved
at the start :), then when the other pop&#x27;s in, you can start cutting
out moves. It&#x27;s not just a generic set of moves you do, you actually
have to think :)

This is a lot of fun, I can see what you&#x27;re talking about, chris.

Stefan: You forgot to add that it&#x27;s easyer to understand :)

Just solved a 4x4x4 cube&#x27;s centres blindfolded. 

One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that I&#x27;m not taking advantage of all the
helpful little shortcuts. I managed a couple. found a great one at the
start. had an unsolved and solved buffer, so I solved the unsolved one
with a solved from the correct face, opening up more things to play
with. That was cool :)

So I&#x27;ve finally got a full method, expect me to try the solve this
week sometime, probibly wednesday.

Thanks for all the help, and wish me luck :)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Thom,

congrats on your centers solve!  You definitely have all the parts
now, it just takes putting it all together, which you definitely can
do.  My only suggestion is to try to memorize the centers and edges a
different way from eachother.  For example, don&#x27;t use numbers say for
both, because what if you mix up the numbers between centers and edges?

Also I had an idea for you and Stefan.  What happens if both the
helper and buffer solve while doing the cycles?  My thinking is that
you would generally &quot;break into&quot; another cycle and continue.  But
since you have so many centers so choose from, why not choose a
completely different buffer and helper that would let you continue
without any sort of &quot;break into&quot; move?

And it could be that what you just suggested Thom is exactly that, I&#x27;m
still new to the idea of using a helper and a buffer pieces, but I
think I&#x27;m starting to catch on to how it works.  So forgive me if I am
repeating exactly what you just said but with different words.

Anyway if that is a new idea maybe that could work sometimes if things
are setup correctly?

Good luck with your solve and let us know how things go!

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Recently I&#x27;ve started doing my BLD solves with loud music playing, and<br>
also in rooms where people are talking, the TV is playing loudly, etc.<br>
 My accuracy has gone down considerably in these situations.  Does<br>
anyone have any tricks for concentrating with lots of distractions? <br>
I&#x27;m getting better at focusing, but it is still hard to get a<br>
successful solve for me under these conditions.<br>
<br>
The hardest distractions for me right now are to listen to comedy<br>
while doing a solve.  I tried doing a 5x5x5 solve last night while<br>
listening to one of my favorite comedians.  It&#x27;s very hard to<br>
concentrate this way, but I noticed toward the end of the solve that I<br>
was better able to tune out the jokes.  The solve was still a DNF<br>
though, but close!<br>
<br>
Anyone have any tips for tuning out distractions?  I&#x27;m trying to<br>
listen to my favorite songs, favorite comedians, or just have a lot of<br>
distractions going at once to make it as hard as I can, but I&#x27;m having<br>

          <div class="email-content">I just had an idea!

I just got a successful 4x4 BLD solve with loud music playing, and I
think I have an idea for not letting distractions get to you.  I was
listening to loud music while doing my solve, and instead of trying to
block out the music I was trying to listen to it and enjoy it.

It&#x27;s a weird feeling, but actually letting go and just listening to
the music and enjoying it seems to take less brain power than trying
to block it out completely.  It sort of that I let my brain listen to
it, but I don&#x27;t really pay much attention to it.

I don&#x27;t know if this will work for listening to talking also, but I&#x27;ll
try that too.  It&#x27;s sort of like you listen to it to some extent, but
only as background.  This seems to work better than a &quot;oh my god tune
out that distraction!&quot; mentality.

Still messing around with this, but I think it will work in general. 
If this does work, I may try doing a solve with my alarm clock going
to see how to handle a solve with a really annoying noise that you
can&#x27;t really enjoy listening too.  I&#x27;m not sure how to handle
something like that.

I feel like training with distractions though will make a solve in
front of an audience seem rather easy.  Actually I think I&#x27;m going to
try the alarm clock idea next, I really have no idea how I would
handle that, and I think if you can solve with something like that
going you can handle most anything.  I&#x27;ll post how it goes after I try
it, gotta go run some errands right now though.

I had the same problems before with BLD chess.  If
your thought process is to tune out the distractions,
that is probably a distraction in itself :)  

Instead I worked on a stronger focus of the task at
hand, then the &quot;tuning out&quot; occurs naturally.  

Just an idea,

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I successfully solved the 4x4 blindfolded while my alarm clock was<br>
going off!<br>
<br>
I set it to go off and left it on during the entire solve,<br>
memorization and solving.<br>
<br>
The memorization took 8:30 roughly and the solving took about 7:46. <br>
The total time was 15:16.21!<br>
<br>
It was much harder to focus during the memorization than usual, and<br>
also when performing a commutator I had to speak out loud whether I<br>
had done the single slice move first or the stuff to place and<br>
edge/center first.<br>
<br>
Also, instead of trying to block out the alarm clock I found it useful<br>
to sort of follow the pattern of it and try to think of it as a beat<br>
to solve to, rather than a sound I need to drown out.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m so happy to know that I can still do this even with distraction! <br>
Arrgh I can&#x27;t wait to do this in front of an audience and prove that<br>
I&#x27;m not just making this stuff up!  I can&#x27;t wait until the April<br>
tournament in Tennesse!!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,

Congrats on the new UWR for 3x3x3 BLD!

Also your 5x5x5 time is quite awesome!  I have a question though, why
aren&#x27;t you on the list for 4x4 BLD?  I think given the disparity
between you and I on the 5x5 list, that assuming the same disparity
for 4x4 would put you under 10 minutes easy.  I think you could get
there much sooner than anyone else can, why not also try for this
barrier and show it is possible?

Btw I had a 9:09 DNF for the 4x4x4 today.  I had memorized too quickly
and didn&#x27;t take into account a small edge cycle (thought I had 24
accounted for but I didn&#x27;t).  But I am nearing this barrier. 
Memorization, without all the edges of course so not completely real
or comparable, was just under 4:20.

Seriously, please try the 4x4 alone the same as you do the 5x5.  I
know you would do very well at it.  I&#x27;ll even offer a race for first
to sub-10 lol, but I doubt I will make it first :-P

          <div class="email-content">You will be definetly distracted by noise, if you have rote memorised  the cube. Instead, if you have memorised the cube by visualising the position of the cube as a picture, then you may not be distracted by noise. 
  Concentration is nothing but visualising the picture in your minds eye. When you do this, you can not hear anything even if someone speaks to you.
  The music without words is far better. A music with words might trigger your thoughts based on those words.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t remember my best time precisely but it was around 7 minutes 
I think but it was a slightly lucky case in terms of center 
permutations.  I can do one again here soon when this big midterm I 
have passes, but in general I don&#x27;t submit records unless I am 
really proud of them; I&#x27;d consider myself a very &quot;under the radar&quot; 
cuber regardless.  That particular 4x4 solve was maybe a little too 
lucky to add to the list.

How come I never hear of anyone else having wrist issues by the way? 
Normally my hands don&#x27;t hurt but after a cubing session they tend to 
be on fire and that can&#x27;t be good.

BTW, as for your 9:09, it shows you can definitely break the 10 
barrier in, I&#x27;m guessing, no time at all.  Your &quot;memorizing too 
quickly&quot; is actually a good way to go about it.  What I do is put on 
some loud, fast music.  It tends to get you energized so you never 
make any lethargic moves or decisions.  Music with a high tempo also 
seems to have influence over your turns-per-second rate, strangely 
enough -- it&#x27;s like keeping in tune.  Sometimes if you just memorize 
as fast as you can, you can execute the moves while the patterns 
linger in your short-term memory.  You can manipulate the cube 
physically faster than I can; try it out sometime and see what 
happens? :P

This idea was actually influenced by Katsu (Planet Puzzle), I 
believe his name is.  He did a few solves on video to a metronome 
and it seemed like a really nice way to stick the process to 
a &quot;schedule&quot; to at least guarantee a certain degree of speed.  Like 
I can memorize things quickly but it only compensates for my 
decreasing handspeed -- all those fast finger tricks kick the crap 
out of my wrists nowadays.

I don&#x27;t have my 4x4x4 with me at the moment, but I can treat my 
5x5x5 as a 4x4x4 and just ignore the central chambers I presume? 
Anyways let me know how your progress goes.

Also how would you define your block cycling method? You seem 
excited about it but I can&#x27;t bring myself to actually try out the 
examples you&#x27;ve listed (I tend to mess up the cube executing the 
algorithms -- not used to the notation).

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I have a question for you memory experts.  I&#x27;ve been working on my <br>
3x3 memorization in a way I&#x27;ve never tried before.<br>
<br>
I scramble a cube and solve corners visually.  Then I memorize the <br>
edge permutation for 10 seconds (or whatever I can memorize in 10 <br>
seconds) and then put on the blindfold and see how much I can recall.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve found that the way I usually memorize is not very good for <br>
memorizing quickly in that I actually say words in my head.  Instead <br>
of doing everything entirely visually I actually think phrases <br>
like &quot;that piece goes here which goes here and those three together <br>
look sort of like a staircase.&quot;  Then I remember &quot;staircase&quot; as my <br>
cue to recall the whole shape during the solve.<br>
<br>
When I tried doing this in 10 seconds I was only able to memorize <br>
about 5 edges into the cycle.  I then tried doing it entirely <br>
visually (which feels weird for me since I&#x27;m used to using this <br>
internal dialogue).  My best so far was to memorize 8 edges and <br>
solve them correctly in about 12 seconds (it&#x27;s hard to stop at 10 <br>
seconds flat).<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;ve noticed a pattern here, the way I memorize edges with <br>
that internal dialogue is also the way I read.  When reading I <br>
actually say the words inside my head and I comprehend the story <br>
exactly as if I were hearing it told by someone, only that someone <br>
is me.  As you can guess I&#x27;m a slow reader.<br>
<br>
So anyway, do you super fast guys use entirely visual techniques for <br>
memorizing a cube?  Or do you use a mix of methods?  Does anyone use <br>
an internal dialogue like this?  I&#x27;m trying to really analyze <br>
exactly what I do when I memorize since I want to try to speed <br>
things up.  I have a feeling that for 3x3 speed BLD this sort of <br>
internal dialogue is not a good idea, but then again maybe there is <br>
a more efficient way for me to use it than what I do now?<br>
<br>
Hoping someone here has any advice.  I really want to learn how to <br>
train my memory, as I am really starting to get into this BLD stuff.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris
   
  I use numbers for the edge orientation and both permutations. Usually I memorise the numbers more than visually...but I use some visual memory also. Leyan told me that he just uses number for CO (exactly opposite of me...haha...maybe that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s faster...), and &quot;draw&quot; the cycles mentaly. I think this is the better way...and that I should try it. But the numbers are so deep into my head that I think they will &quot;invade&quot; my memorisation...haha

          <div class="email-content">Chris,

I would assume you use language as a way to further verify where 
things are.  By saying things out loud you &quot;ensure&quot; that pieces are 
where they are and thusly you&#x27;re able to execute algorithms with 
more certainty.  However, of course this is a potential obstacle.  
Consider your speedcubing -- do you also use internal language when 
solving it? I would presume no -- you go based on reflexes and 
pattern recognition and the muscle memory inherent in your hands 
after practicing certain executions.  The same goes for blindfold 
solving in the sense that you want to move to a point where you can 
do things on reflex, but since this case involves memorizing new 
data, it&#x27;s a little different: When you use language to verify your 
positionings, usually it will be correct.  Now, assuming this, you 
are probably going to make a correct move without the language and 
thus lowering your memorization time.  Instead you can 
think &quot;Staircase&quot; which is a visual cue, a visual cue similar in 
nature to the visual cues of speedcubing.  If you can get 
blindfolding cubing into this same sphere of action that you can 
with speedcubing in terms of how you view patterns, you can execute 
the moves much more quickly without the worry of making a wrong move 
or cycling an incorrect piece.  Hope this makes sense.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Also how would you define your block cycling method? You seem <br>
&gt; excited about it but I can&#x27;t bring myself to actually try out the <br>
&gt; examples you&#x27;ve listed (I tend to mess up the cube executing the <br>
&gt; algorithms -- not used to the notation).  <br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
I am definitely very excited about the block method.  I mean it&#x27;s kind<br>
of hard to describe without an example solve, so without using an<br>
example solve I&#x27;ll try my best.<br>
<br>
Basically I purposefully cycle centers/edges/pieces in general to an<br>
incorrect face (if the center is red I&#x27;ll cycle it on purpose to the<br>
yellow face say) to create a 2x1 block with a red piece that was<br>
already there.  If you do this in a clever/useful way though, the<br>
blocks you create will be in a 3 cycle with eachother.  Or maybe even<br>
a 4 cycle, or just a 2-swap.  There are all kinds of ways you can<br>
create blocks.<br>
<br>
Also, I&#x27;m trying to mess around with forming two 2x2x1 blocks each<br>
made up of a corner, the two adjecent edges and the center piece that<br>
touches them.<br>
<br>
Then I can set them up to do<br>
(Rr)2 D&#x27; U (Rr)2 U&#x27; (Rr)2 D (Rr)2 D&#x27; (Rr)2 D (Rr)2 U&#x27; to swap them.<br>
<br>
And if they&#x27;re in a 3 cycle I can do that same move without the final<br>
U turn or also something like (Rr) U2 (Rr)&#x27; (Dd) (Rr) U2 (Rr)&#x27; (Dd)&#x27;<br>
<br>
The reason I like using blocks it is that it allows me to really take<br>
advantage of chunking.  When memorizing my cycles where I move centers<br>
individually I can consider every piece in a block to be &quot;solved&quot;.  So<br>
my individual pieces cycle could only be 8 pieces long or so.  Then I<br>
remember the cycle of the blocks in place of the potentially 8-9 other<br>
pieces that would have been in that first cycle.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The method I use is hard to describe, but I&#x27;ll try.

Basically, I carried this over from speedreading. 

When you were a kid, you used to start reading by reading each letter
in turn, then recognising the word, then moving onto the next word.
Now you just recognise the words as a whole. In speedreading, you
start to read phrases and sentences as a whole, this is what I carried
over.

It&#x27;s like how 3247237284 is harder to memorise than (324) (723) (728) (4)

You need to start looking at the cycles in patterns, not &quot;This cubie,
then that one, then that one.&quot; More like &quot;These three&quot;.

I memorise visually (no numbers/text/images, I feel it slows me down),
so this is easyer for me. I try and do things like how you did with
the staircase. But don&#x27;t assign anything to it, just remember that
pattern. I try not to think &quot;the pattern that is in-out-in and the one
that goes around the middle slice&quot; but instead &quot;this pattern and that
pattern&quot;. I do a lot of feeling of the cube when I memorise. :)

Like when I was doing the 4x4x4 centres, I had a pattern that went dlB
, dlR and dlF. What went through my mind wasn&#x27;t &quot;They go around hte
cube&quot; it was just &quot;that pattern&quot;. (Well, actually, it wasn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s
nearly impossable to describe yourself feeling a pattern in your head
on the cube ;) ). Even things that don&#x27;t make patterns can make
patterns. you just have to visualise it.


I think my technique is faulty, though. I&#x27;ll memorise the first 4, and
lock the first three in my memory. I&#x27;ll still know the fourth, but I
always go ovver the cycles multiple times to make sure I won&#x27;t forget
them. I could probibly do a one-pass memorisation, but I always go
over them again, fearing I will messup. Then I&#x27;ll go over the first 7,
memorise them, go over the first 10, etc...


I need a better technique, but &#x27;spiderman-banana-abacus&#x27; doesn&#x27;t
appeal to me.

Basically, I carried this over from speedreading. 

When you were a kid, you used to start reading by reading each letter
in turn, then recognising the word, then moving onto the next word.
Now you just recognise the words as a whole. In speedreading, you
start to read phrases and sentences as a whole, this is what I carried
over.

It&#x27;s like how 3247237284 is harder to memorise than (324) (723) (728) (4)

You need to start looking at the cycles in patterns, not &quot;This cubie,
then that one, then that one.&quot; More like &quot;These three&quot;.

I memorise visually (no numbers/text/images, I feel it slows me down),
so this is easyer for me. I try and do things like how you did with
the staircase. But don&#x27;t assign anything to it, just remember that
pattern. I try not to think &quot;the pattern that is in-out-in and the one
that goes around the middle slice&quot; but instead &quot;this pattern and that
pattern&quot;. I do a lot of feeling of the cube when I memorise. :)

Like when I was doing the 4x4x4 centres, I had a pattern that went dlB
, dlR and dlF. What went through my mind wasn&#x27;t &quot;They go around hte
cube&quot; it was just &quot;that pattern&quot;. (Well, actually, it wasn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s
nearly impossable to describe yourself feeling a pattern in your head
on the cube ;) ). Even things that don&#x27;t make patterns can make
patterns. you just have to visualise it.


I think my technique is faulty, though. I&#x27;ll memorise the first 4, and
lock the first three in my memory. I&#x27;ll still know the fourth, but I
always go ovver the cycles multiple times to make sure I won&#x27;t forget
them. I could probibly do a one-pass memorisation, but I always go
over them again, fearing I will messup. Then I&#x27;ll go over the first 7,
memorise them, go over the first 10, etc...


I need a better technique, but &#x27;spiderman-banana-abacus&#x27; doesn&#x27;t
appeal to me.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Thom,

Congratulations on your solve!  Welcome to the addiction ;-)

Looking at your scramble, yes that is definitely not the nicest of
solves to attempt, so again congrats on your success!

Also I know what you mean about being afraid to do the last
permutation.  I hardly ever do finger tricks for the T if I have to
end with it, and I usually go super slow just because I&#x27;m afraid of
misaligning a face during a trigger and not knowing which way it went.

Also, just to get you thinking about blocks too.  From the start of
your scramble, imgaine instead of cycling the centers normally, cycle
a D face center piece very early on (your first opportunity even) to
lfD.  Notice then that the newly created block at [lfD + lbD] switches
with the block already at [urB + drB].  This is a perfect example of
using blocks.  It&#x27;s a faster way to memorize three of the center
pieces, and also you move those three to the correct location in 1
move (but you did waste a move moving the first D face center to lfD.
 So the net effect is to move 2 centers to their correct location for
free).

Awesome job, and again congrats on your 4x4x4 BLD solve!  Lots of luck
with all your future BLD exploits, and keep us updated on how it goes!

Chris

<br>
Sorry I don&#x27;t want to confuse you, and I mistyped there.  Cycle a *B*<br>
face center very early on to lfD (the incorrect face for it).  But<br>
this creates a B face block at [lfD + lbD] which switches with the D<br>
face block already at [urB + drB].<br>
<br>
Sorry for the mistype, but check out that block setup and see if it is<br>
something that interests you.  Other than cycling that one B face<br>
center to lfD the cycles work the same way as you normally handle<br>
them.  The only difference is that at the very end of your centers<br>
cycles you need to also fix the blocks, which you could do with B2 r&#x27;<br>
f2 b2 r B2 r&#x27; f2 b2 r and that would finish off the centers completely.<br>
<br>
Just food for thought,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I have a question about a corner scenario for CP.  I want to hear<br>
every possible viewpoint, so even those who don&#x27;t orient first please<br>
let me know if you have any cool ideas.<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s say I have the cycle (UBL -&gt; DBL -&gt; DBR)<br>
<br>
I used to use this move, D&#x27; B2 R F R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R&#x27; D<br>
<br>
Recently I switched to this move after watching videos of Tyson:<br>
x&#x27; (L&#x27;ULU&#x27;)x3 F (RU&#x27;R&#x27;U)x3 F&#x27; x<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve found that Tyson&#x27;s way helps me to memorize very quickly, since<br>
the cycles are done with an easy process.  However, it really irks me<br>
to do 26 moves for a cycle when I could just as easily do 10.  Sure<br>
those 26 moves are super fast, but I mean so are those 10.  But<br>
solving with those 10 makes it a bit slower for me during memorization<br>
than if I solved with the 26 moves.<br>
<br>
Long story short, I&#x27;m undecided.  What would others do for that case?<br>

  Hey everyone,

I have a question about a corner scenario for CP.  I want to hear
every possible viewpoint, so even those who don&#x27;t orient first please
let me know if you have any cool ideas.

Let&#x27;s say I have the cycle (UBL -> DBL -> DBR)

I used to use this move, D&#x27; B2 R F R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R&#x27; D

Recently I switched to this move after watching videos of Tyson:
x&#x27; (L&#x27;ULU&#x27;)x3 F (RU&#x27;R&#x27;U)x3 F&#x27; x

I&#x27;ve found that Tyson&#x27;s way helps me to memorize very quickly, since
the cycles are done with an easy process.  However, it really irks me
to do 26 moves for a cycle when I could just as easily do 10.  Sure
those 26 moves are super fast, but I mean so are those 10.  But
solving with those 10 makes it a bit slower for me during memorization
than if I solved with the 26 moves.

Long story short, I&#x27;m undecided.  What would others do for that case?

Chris

(UBL -> DBL -> DBR)?

Is that the right cycle?  It seems like it&#x27;s just D2 F2 + A-perm?

&quot;Hey I made a blindfold solving video.  Where can I upload it?

It uses the scramble:

D2 U R U L&#x27; U D2 R U L&#x27; D B2 U&#x27; D L&#x27; B&#x27; R2 D2 B2 U2 F2 D&#x27; F2 L F

How do you guys do on this scramble? I personally felt that it had
ugly edges in virtually all aspects, but the corner orientation was
nice.

I also made one where I slow down and explain my steps, but that video
uses a different algorithm.&quot;

Same but only 1/12 the file size:

Learn to compress, Tyson :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

Thank you very much.  My apologies for being too lazy to compress... 
but I uploaded the file onto strangepuzzle.com.

Marcus, if you need a place to host your video, just use 
strangepuzzle.com.  You can send your video to Chris Hunt by using 
yousendit.com or some other web service like that.  Otherwise, if you 
want to transfer it to me, I&#x27;d be happy to upload it onto my web space.

Just in case you forgot, the scramble is here:

D2 U R U L&#x27; U D2 R U L&#x27; D B2 U&#x27; D L&#x27; B&#x27; R2 D2 B2 U2 F2 D&#x27; F2 L F

How did you correct the edge parity?  I did it in an inefficient 
manner, which explains my pause right before I corrected it.  I was 
trying to think of something good, but then decided to give up on it 
for the sake of total time.  I have a better way now but I&#x27;d be curious 
as to how you solved it.

If you don&#x27;t remember, I&#x27;m sure we can figure it out from the video you 
took.

          <div class="email-content">hi guys!

yesterday i did a successful BLD-solve while my brain waves were measured
(EEG). i kept my eyes closed and didn&#x27;t have to use a blindfold, because
they see every single eye-movement and if you twinkle or not. in the first
20 seconds i calmed down and tried to think of nothing. during the
memorization phase my eyes moved rapidly and the brain activity raised (i
memorized for 2 minutes because i wantet to play it safe). during the solve
(also 2 minutes) you can see that i needed one second of thinking, then i
execute a move deep im my subconsciousness, while the activity goes down. a
few seconds of thinking and then the next algorithm and so on. i don&#x27;t know
what we can learn out if it and if i could get faster by cubing during the
EEG, but it was funny. i would lilke to check the differences between
memorizing with numbers and with pictures.

          <div class="email-content">The 3x3 speed corner cycle is awesome.  I was inspired by it to find a<br>
way to fix one of my worst edge cycles.<br>
<br>
I use to hate seeing lUB -&gt; lUF -&gt; lDF but now I just use the same<br>
idea as the corners cycle,<br>
<br>
F&#x27; d F&#x27; U2 F d&#x27; F&#x27; U2 F2<br>
<br>
:-D<br>
<br>
I like that style of conjugate, having the conjugate move combine with<br>
the first move of the commutator itself, so it condenses to 9 moves. <br>
Not sure if anyone has tried that cycle, but I like it a lot.  Works<br>
for 5x5 too.<br>

If you used the orientation scheme I suggested a while ago, then you 
could use one of these:

B&#x27; U&#x27; B D B&#x27; U B D&#x27;
L&#x27; B R B&#x27; L B R&#x27; B&#x27;

The latter can be nicely executed as:

r&#x27; U R U&#x27; L U l&#x27; B&#x27;

Cheers!
Stefan

What was the break down between memorization and solve (if you remember) and also, do 
you have the scramble?  It&#x27;s very interesting for me to see these times because I recall you 
saying that your memorization time was between 15 and 25 seconds.  Personally, my 
fastest memorization time is about 35 seconds and I had a 1:29 with that... but for an 
average solve, my break down is 50 and 70 (whereas Leyan is 60 and 60).  In other words, 
out memorization and execution are much more closely matched whereas your 
memorization is far faster than your execution.  Are you having a lot of delays during your 
solve as a result of very quick memorization?

I think I could memorize the cube in 25 seconds, but it would take me time to reconstruct 
stuff in my head.  If you have the scramble, it would be interesting for me to see what I 
could do on this solve.

I finally managed a sub-30 solve for the 5x5x5 BLD :-D  The time was<br>

          <div class="email-content">Wait a second....<br>
<br>
So what type of method are you using?  If your execution is slow <br>
because of hand pain, but your memorization is about 25-30 seconds, <br>
that would still mean 60 seconds for execution.  Leyan&#x27;s execution is <br>
about 60 seconds, and my execution is about the same speed, maybe <br>
slightly slower.  If you look at the video of my solve, I have a few <br>
pauses here and there, but generally the moves I&#x27;m doing take a good <br>
amount of dexterity.  Leyan, on the other hand, will do 60 seconds or <br>
less on execution, but he&#x27;s making the same number of moves as me, and <br>
he&#x27;s just not pausing.<br>
<br>
In other words, if your speed solve goes from 15 seconds and increases <br>
to 30 seconds, it seems like you&#x27;re making moves twice as slowly as <br>
before.  I would think that your maximum hand speed is about the same <br>
as Leyan who has recorded 15.1x averages in competition, so if you&#x27;re <br>
executing the moves on the cube in 60 seconds for the blindfold method, <br>
your method must take half as many moves.<br>
<br>
What method are you using?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Oh yeah, that&#x27;s definitely true.  So how do you still solve the cube?  
I&#x27;m guessing if you come across an OLL you don&#x27;t know, you just do 
something twice, like (R U F U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27;) until you get an algorithm that 
you do know, and for PLL, you just use A-perms to fix the corners and 
things like that?  Are you using BLD moves that you haven&#x27;t forgot as 
well?

The reason I ask is that if your hand speed is still the same and you 
still have all of your F2L, then your times shouldn&#x27;t really drop from 
15 to 30... F2L is the main component of any speed solve, and using a 
four-look LL, I can still average under 20.  Are you using BLD 
algorithms to put everything in place gradually which accounts for the 
15 seconds extra it&#x27;s taking you to solve the cube?

It has been a while since I did anything with blindfold cubing... But <br>

I personally believe that it will be faster that the OE/PE strategy, <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Joel,

I&#x27;m currently working on a similar approach, inspired by Stefan&#x27;s
method, for 5x5x5 central edges (and thus also 3x3x3 edges).

My plan is to use commutators and setup moves to solve orientation and
permutation at the same time for two pieces per cycle.  So I would
correctly permute and orient 2 pieces for each three cycle, then let
the 3rd edge just make it a possible cycle.  Then at the end I might
have to flip a few edges, but there would not be much work left to do
either way.

Not sure if that qualifies exactly as Stefan&#x27;s method, but it is
heavily inspired by his method.

I&#x27;m not sure how fast it would be for 3x3x3, but it would save me a
lot of moves for the 5x5x5, since my edge flip algs are very slow to
execute.

Not sure if this is what you&#x27;re asking for, but it is something
inspired very strongly by ideas form Stefan.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">You pretty much have it down -- I use algs I know until I see a case 
I remember.  I generally only use blindfold algs for the LL if they 
only deal with sets of pieces that are identical (eg all edges, all 
corners). I just tried speedsolving and got 24 seconds so I am not 
actually so far down the line, but the last layer eats up a lot of 
my time.  I really can&#x27;t say where the time is going -- it&#x27;s not 
just one factor but the sum of many, and the times are a lot 
different if I happen to remember or not remember a certain OLL or 
PLL case.

          <div class="email-content">Oh... sorry Joel,

I didn&#x27;t read your message that carefully.  I personally haven&#x27;t tried 
Stefan&#x27;s method.  One reason is that I don&#x27;t understand it completely, 
but part of that is because I haven&#x27;t spent the time to study it.  I&#x27;ve 
been so lazy lately in terms of practicing because, well, when you cube 
for a public audience, (i.e., in front of hot girls) your times don&#x27;t 
matter.  These last few days I&#x27;ve been getting back into the groove of 
things and I think my times are strong again.  No more of these DNF, 
DNF, 2:40 competitions :-P.  Georgia 3/11 should be better.

Anyway, it seems that Stefan&#x27;s method can be very powerful.  Perhaps 
the utilization of 2-cycles as opposed to 3-cycles gives less delays 
during the execution.  One question which I&#x27;m not sure about is the 
ease in memory.  I can generally memorize the edge permutation by my 
method in under 20 seconds... I wonder what it would increase to?

One thing to keep in mind is that edge orientation memorization takes 
maybe 2 to 3 seconds, and edge orientation execution takes another 3 to 
5 seconds... so I&#x27;m not sure how much you save.

Time to run.  Yay!  Cube mile anyone?

Well... hmm... I should look into it.  I might e-mail some of you guys 
for help, but my idea is that if I can memorize the edges using 
Stefan&#x27;s method in under 25 seconds, then the payoff is worth it.  
Otherwise, I&#x27;m not sure, because edge orientation in our method is so 
trivial to deal with.  It literally is &quot;glance, put on blindfold, 
execute&quot;... many times just one setup move plus one algorithm...

Haha...<br>
<br>
This thread is really making me think about where I can improve my <br>
memorisation. I basically use 24 letters for the edges (letters that <br>
are connected to words like &#x27;Donald duck&#x27; yes). And a while ago, I <br>
got to the point where I could instantly convert cubies into letters <br>
and vice versa. However, memorising a sequence of letters was <br>
actually quite timeconsuming (allthough I was getting better a <br>
little while ago), so I was thinking about a system to make a story <br>
with them... Of course, this can slow me down too, but if I <br>
can &#x27;standardise&#x27; the story, I don&#x27;t have to make the whole thing up <br>
on the fly... So maybe that would work... <br>
<br>
Or maybe I should just memorise the first 5 letters, and think &#x27;this <br>
pattern, that pattern&#x27; for the rest ;). I know Jean Pons memorised 7 <br>
objects, and does the rest with numbers, because he says 7 objects <br>
are not hard to memorise...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tyson

Well, breaking up the 3 cycles into 2-cycles is not the power of the 
method... I actually suspect you will have to use three cycles to 
make it more powerfull than what you do now. I definately think 
memorisation of the whole permutation can be done in the same time 
as you memorise your permutation.

I remember Dror Vomberg told me there is too much information to 
memorise if you do orientation and permutation in one go, but I 
actually think you memorise less information... You memorise the 
same amount of info as you memorise for the permutation only, not 
more than that.

So I predict you save at least 7 (that is 5+2) seconds on the edges 
orientation. It will however take time to develop a nice system of 
memorisation (you&#x27;ll need 24 numbers, or &#x27;objects&#x27;) and it will take 
time to get used to doing it in three cycles...

The reason for this post is just that I would love to see a top BLD 
cuber try it, so one person can compare both methods. 

- Joël.

Can you tell how long ago you had that 15 seconds average?

It&#x27;s real easy, the core idea is just:
&quot;Solve one piece at a time.&quot;

That&#x27;s the simplest most natural idea that comes to my mind after 
thinking that for blindsolving, you want to go in very small steps.

Doing orientation and permutation together is inherent and natural in 
this idea, or in other words: even thinking about these two issues as 
separate issures is unnatural (for my idea).

So yeah, solving two pieces at a time could be called an extension of 
my method, but on the other hand it breaks with the core idea. It does 
share the aspect of doing orientation and permutation together, but 
actually that&#x27;s only noticed by people who think of them separately. 
So for me this shared aspect isn&#x27;t even really noticable, but the 
difference of solving two pieces instead of one is.

In addition to not doing orientation separately, it might also save 
time for setup moves. With the orient-first strategy, you need to 
setup pieces with a certain orientation. Actually of course it depends 
on how you execute both methods, particularly whether you setup pieces 
to certain standard positions or do completely free-style cycles like 
Chris does for 4x4 edges.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

Actually Stefan, this is really a funny post to me...

> It&#x27;s real easy, the core idea is just:
> &quot;Solve one piece at a time.&quot;

Haha... I was almost going to say: &#x27;You are sooo wrong about that!&#x27;. 
But of course, it&#x27;s your method, so you must be right.. Right?

Well, actually, with the traditional cycle method, I solved one 
piece at a time when I did the corners. 

In my view, the essential new thing of your method is NOT solving 1 
piece at the time, but losing the orientation, because it is an 
unnesecary burden. As you say, there&#x27;s no need to think about 
orientations. Even when the piece is in place. It&#x27;s just that most 
of us (including me) think of it that way!

Hmm.. I haven&#x27;t been following this group, so I am not sure what you 
mean by free-style cycles... But it sounds funny :).

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Let me just state from the start that my purpose in using this<br>
approach if for the 5x5x5 central edges.  I&#x27;m not interested in making<br>
the new fastest approach for 3x3 edges ever, I don&#x27;t even know if it<br>
could be done.  I like it because it uses fewer moves than my current<br>
approach for the 5x5x5 central edges.<br>
<br>
Ok with that disclaimer, I am going to show this on a 3x3x3 cube, even<br>
though it&#x27;s purpose is to be used on the 5x5x5.<br>
<br>
Do the scramble: L&#x27; B&#x27; F2 U&#x27; D2 R B R B2 D2 U L2 U L R D F D&#x27; B R D2<br>
R2 L&#x27; D&#x27; B<br>
<br>
After doing this scramble the edge permutation is even, so I will<br>
solve the edges ignoring the corners.<br>
<br>
To solve the edges with this new approach I am going to use freestlye<br>
commutators to perform 3 cycles, and each 3 cycle will completely<br>
solve two pieces.<br>
<br>
Step 1:<br>
UB -&gt; UR -&gt; DR and UR needs to flip before cycling to DR.<br>
<br>
To do this I would do D&#x27; F U R E2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R E2 R&#x27; F&#x27; D<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t care how this moves the DR edge to UB, all I care is to<br>
memorize how the DR edges ends up at UB.<br>
<br>
Ok so now I have solved UR and DR.  Now I have UB -&gt; DF -&gt; DB and DF<br>
needs to flip before going to DB.<br>
<br>
To do this I would do U2 B&#x27; L&#x27; M&#x27; U2 M D M&#x27; U2 M D&#x27; L B U2<br>
<br>
Ok now I have DF and DB solved.  Next I start with UB and continue.<br>
<br>
I have UB &lt;-&gt; FR and UB needs to flip before going to FR.  I&#x27;ll save<br>
this till the end instead of doing it now.<br>
<br>
Next I&#x27;ll start looking at UL and see how the cycles from there go.<br>
<br>
So I have UL -&gt; DL -&gt; FL and I need to flip UL before placing it in DL.<br>
<br>
To do this I would do: F&#x27; L&#x27; E L D&#x27; L&#x27; E&#x27; L D F<br>
<br>
Now I start over at UL and move on<br>
UL -&gt; BR -&gt; UF and I need to flip UL before placing in BR.<br>
<br>
To do this I do: F R S D2 S&#x27; U2 S D2 S&#x27; U2 R&#x27; F&#x27;<br>
<br>
Now I have that UL &lt;-&gt; BL and I need to flip UL before placing in BL.<br>
<br>
So now I have two transpositions left, which I&#x27;ll do as two 3 cycles.<br>
<br>
So to do the first three cycle, I only need to solve 1 piece<br>
correclty.  I&#x27;ll place UL -&gt; BL -&gt; FR and placing BL to FR will be my<br>
side effect.<br>
<br>
To do UL -&gt; BL -&gt; FR I do: E2 R U2 R&#x27; E2 R U2 R&#x27;<br>
<br>
Now all I have is UB -&gt; FR -&gt; UL and FL needs to flip before going to<br>
UB and UB needs to flip before going to FR.<br>
<br>
To do this I do: B U L B E2 B&#x27; U B E2 B&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27;<br>
<br>
--------<br>
<br>
So step by step I did this:<br>
1) D&#x27; F U R E2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R E2 R&#x27; F&#x27; D<br>
2) U2 B&#x27; L&#x27; M&#x27; U2 M D M&#x27; U2 M D&#x27; L B U2<br>
3) F&#x27; L&#x27; E L D&#x27; L&#x27; E&#x27; L D F<br>
4) F R S D2 S&#x27; U2 S D2 S&#x27; U2 R&#x27; F&#x27;<br>
5) E2 R U2 R&#x27; E2 R U2 R&#x27;<br>
6) B U L B E2 B&#x27; U B E2 B&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27;<br>
<br>
If you made it this far, first off congratulations, I don&#x27;t expect<br>
many people will have read this far.  If you did read this far, my<br>
thoughts on this method are are that for the 5x5x5 central edges it is<br>
awesome.  It is far fewer moves then first flipping and then moving<br>
edges.  Also it will speed up my memorization in that I memorize the<br>
edge cycles by sticker to also include orientation as well as permutation.<br>
<br>
I guess my question is, should I memorize the cycles the same way as<br>
Stefan does, by stickers as well as by where the pieces go?  Meaning I<br>
think that the U sticker of UB goes to the D sticker of DF rather than<br>
UB goes to DF?<br>
<br>
Also, I&#x27;ve been thinking about the setup moves, and because I can do<br>
the commutators any way I want, setup moves might only be to flip one<br>
edge, then do a usual commutator, then at the end unflip that edge. <br>
So setup moves might average about 3 per cycle, which is not bad. <br>
With a rigid system I think it will be very fast.<br>
<br>
So anyway, this is what I&#x27;m in the process of learning.  Does any<br>
other 5x5 BLD&#x27;er have any comments?  Also do any of you 3x3 guys have<br>
any interest in a system like this?  My guess is not really, probably<br>
absolutely not for you top cubers, but I thought I would ask in case<br>
anyone is interested.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Yeah.. Thats my idea of solving.. There are a lot of nice special 
cases where you can easily solve 2 edges in one alg, often with few 
setup moves.

For the last one, I would do another &#x27;commutator&#x27; aproach. The firs 
target is DL, the second target is LF. I setup the second target on 
the bottom:

F&#x27;U  (D M&#x27;U2M D&#x27; M&#x27;U2M) U&#x27;F

There are a lot of funny commutators that you can use for this... 
Not only the standard U permutations ;).

Hmm... like I said, my main concern is to make it easy and thus the 
idea &quot;solve one piece at a time&quot;. This then *includes* the aspect of 
orienting and permuting together. The only methods I had seen before 
inventing mine were Richard Carr&#x27;s and Oliver Hayden&#x27;s, both orient 
and permute separately and work on more than one piece at a time. Were 
there any others? If not, then indeed both the single-piece and the 
complete-solve ideas were &quot;new&quot;, though I really tend to think of the 
latter being included in the former.

> Hmm.. I haven&#x27;t been following this group, so I am not sure what you

I myself have a very strict way, I do 2-cycles and one piece is always 
the UR edge (for edges) or the ULB corner (for corners). And I use 
setup moves to bring pieces to standard positions. Now imagine just 
the opposite, i.e. no fixed included pieces (cycling *any* three 
pieces) and no setup moves except necessary for a core cycle (in 
Chris&#x27;s case, an 8-move edges-cycle). So pretty much the shortest way 
to solve with 3-cycles.

Cheers!
Stefan

It&#x27;s a shame that you lost the battery to the camera after you took the 
PSMO video, because that DDR video was definitely amazing.

          <div class="email-content">Hi again Stefan.

1. Go to sleep.

2. I guess I just interpreted your method differently that you did 
yourself. And I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a bad thing!

Solving 1 pieces at a time is efficient, but I am pretty sure 
solving 2 pieces at a time with your method will be just as easy as 
solving 2 pieces at a time with the traditional EO/EP methods, after 
enough practice, and it will be faster than solving 1 piece at a 
time.

The way you describe solving the edges sounds exactly like what I am 
working on... Allthough I haven&#x27;t been doing it for 2 months now... 
I think it has great potential. I am just looking for a top-cuber to 
proove it :).

See? Perfect example why you shouldn&#x27;t ignore Q=innerSlice:

(U F U&#x27;) S2 (U F&#x27; U&#x27;) S2

If you really want a setup move, use y&#x27;:

y&#x27; (U R U&#x27;) M2&#x27; (U R&#x27; U&#x27;) M2&#x27; y

How&#x27;s that for speed?

          <div class="email-content">Yes.. Stefan, I know I am not very good with inner slice moves for 
Q. :). But I don&#x27;t ignore them.. I just don&#x27;t spot them very easily..

And yes, I could have also saved 2 moves by making a cube rotation, 
but I would not prefer to do that in a blindfold solve, because I 
find it confusing.

And the first one is exactly the reason why I like the idea of free-
style, but I also realise that too much freedom will slow me down 
(because I would have to think too much). That&#x27;s why I am more 
thinking of a method where UR is the &#x27;buffer&#x27;, the first target can 
be anything, and the setup moves depend on the second target... So 
the setup moves are always the same in similar situations...

Go to sleep! ;)

The speed will come from a different source, though. The speed of my 
single-piece method comes from its simplicity. Setting up a single 
piece should be a no-brainer after some practice. Also, I&#x27;m looking 
for direct algorithms so not using any setup moves anymore. Then for 
each piece, you just apply one algorithm and that&#x27;s it. No setup, 
shoot, setdown, setup, shoot, setdown, ... anymore. Just shoot, shoot, 
shoot, ...

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

You say the speed comes from simplicity. How ever.. I think you can 
devellop a procedure where you solve 2 edges at a time, and it&#x27;s 
still simple. You know, I remember something Ron told us at the 
yahoo group: When he say the idea of solving CE pairs for 
speedcubing, he wrote down &#x27;too hard to apply&#x27; next to it... Now, 
for most of the speedcubing population, solving a CE pair is a no-
brainer. 

I really think that it&#x27;s possible to use your method to solve 2 
edges at a time, without getting too difficult.

Yes indeed !! Simple commutators will do it! And only 1 move setup is 
required. U might do cube rotation as setup too ;-)

How about this instead:

How about this instead:

Btw, would be nice if you could write parentheses around your P-parts 
as well, makes it easier to read.

How about this instead:

This would be faster, though:
(z y&#x27;) - (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) M&#x27; (U R U&#x27; r&#x27;) - (y z&#x27;)

Yes, me, me :-)

Also, let me again offer you to show my newest method. I&#x27;ll make it 
even easier this time and not ask you to pick a scramble but just pick 
a number from 1-50.

          <div class="email-content">Oooh Stefan, this was in fact what I was looking for as a response to
this post.

Also, I managed to do a successful blindfolded solve of my 3x3 edges
with this approach, and I can see how with practice this could be a
very nice way to solve, even for the 3x3x3.

I like the idea of using it for 5x5x5 for now since it uses many fewer
moves than what I do now.

I will definitely take a detailed look at your commutators and get an
idea of how you are approaching this, thanks for the super detailed
response!

Chris

P.S.  I choose 28 as my number form 1-50 :-D  Sorry about not replying
sooner, I got caught up in either the speedsolving group or something
else and forgot about that thread, but yes I am definitely interested
in yuor new method!  I choose 28 I choose 28!!

          <div class="email-content">&gt; So anyway, this is what I&#x27;m in the process of learning.  Does any<br>
&gt; other 5x5 BLD&#x27;er have any comments?  Also do any of you 3x3 guys have<br>
&gt; any interest in a system like this?  My guess is not really, probably<br>
&gt; absolutely not for you top cubers, but I thought I would ask in case<br>
&gt; anyone is interested.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Chris<br>
<br>
Yes!! I am interested... I was experimenting with Stefan&#x27;s method a <br>
while ago, and I did a few slow solves blindfolded, exactly like you <br>
described here: solving 2 edges at a time.<br>
<br>
I am working on a way to &#x27;standardise&#x27; this &#x27;method&#x27; so I don&#x27;t have <br>
to think about it, but can solve 2 pieces at a time using 3 cycles... <br>
Maybe not optimal, but with easy setup-moves and fast algorithms. <br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll let you know when I have any succes :).<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I really think that it&#x27;s possible to use your method to solve 2 <br>
&gt; edges at a time, without getting too difficult.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - Joël.<br>
<br>
Hey Joel,<br>
<br>
You can do this actually, and is really isn&#x27;t that hard.  I just got<br>
my first successful BLD solve of edges using an approach like you<br>
describe just a few minutes ago.  See the thread &quot;Looking for advice<br>
for freestlying EO+EP&quot; and also Stefan&#x27;s response.  This thread deals<br>
with exactly that, Stefan&#x27;s method only you solve two edges at a time<br>
instead of just one.<br>
<br>
Freestlye cycling is quickly becoming a favorite strategy of mine,<br>
though of course it&#x27;s downside is the thinking time.  I spend probably<br>
3 times as long as Stefan does thinking about my cycles, if not more.<br>
  However, I try to make up for that by doing many fewer moves than he<br>
does.  It&#x27;s all about what approach you like, both approaches are<br>
proven to be equally fast (Stefan and I raced eachother for 4x4x4<br>
edges many many times, and got very similar averages as far as solving<br>
time goes).<br>

<br>
Hey Chris,<br>
<br>
Yes... This is the main problem... But I was thinking about <br>
standardising the moves a bit like this:<br>
<br>
The first sticker of the cycle is always UR.<br>
<br>
- If the second sticker is on the D face, setup the third sticker in <br>
the D face, and use the same standard commutator every time. (Like y <br>
M&#x27;U2 M D M&#x27;U2M D&#x27; y&#x27;)<br>
<br>
- If the second sticker in in the D layer (NOT D face), setup the <br>
third sticker in the D layer (not D face) and use a standerd <br>
commutator for this case every time. (Like M&#x27;UM D M&#x27;U&#x27;M D&#x27;)<br>
<br>
- ...<br>
<br>
Maybe I&#x27;ll even make large tables to describe all the cases and their <br>
solutions... But maybe you can also do it on the fly once you get used <br>
to it.. <br>
<br>
Anyways, I should go to sleep...<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

I just successfully tried a BLD solve on edges using this approach
again and was able to use nicer moves more like what you are doing.  I
think I was thinking a bit too restrictive with my solves on that
first attempt.  I probably averaged about my usual 1.0-1.25 on setup
turns by just trying to think of two edges already setup nicely, then
maneuever the third edge into a good position as compared to the other
two.

Thanks for the heads up and making me think a bit more about these
types of cycles.

Also Joel, yes I think having a set strategy would be a very good
idea.  I found also that I do care how I cycle the third edge to UB,
in that I have to keep all the edges oriented in the commutator such
that my sticker of the third edge ends up as the U sticker of UB (I
always start with UB, but it can be UR too).

I think allowing more freedom, and being able to switch between the B
and the U sticker of UB and make my cycles a little less rigid would
be a good way to speed up this method.  I would just have to know when
the third edge is flipped when it is sent to UB (or UR for you) and
when it is not.

I think allowing that freedom for the third edge would make this metod
even more powerful.

Just some ideas to throw out, I&#x27;m starting to like this approach
already.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it out on an actual 5x5x5 BLD solve, but I
need to be more comfortable with it on my 3x3x3 first.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Well I think I am finally starting to get the hang of visual<br>
memorization.  I&#x27;ve been using it lately for the 3x3 and also for the<br>
4x4x4 and 5x5x5 edges.<br>
<br>
What I used to do was have an internal dialogue with myself &quot;this<br>
piece goes here, then the piece that is there goes over to here&quot;. <br>
When I first started I had even done that in addition to numbering<br>
each piece, but I didn&#x27;t even remember the numbers, I just numbered<br>
them so as to count all 12 edges which is not necessary.<br>
<br>
Well, tonight I just improved my 3x3x3 BLD record using this new<br>
technique, I got 1:48.12 which makes me very happy!  I purposely did<br>
not allow myself to speak internally (my usual dialogue) during the<br>
memorization, except that I did use my usual names for shapes in the<br>
CO and EO steps.<br>
<br>
Also, I&#x27;ve found that I am getting a bit more accurate with big cube<br>
edges by simply trying to picture 3-4 pieces at a time for any given<br>
part of the cycle, rather than to say &quot;ok so if I am at lUB I go<br>
&#x27;short hop&#x27; to uFL then I move &#x27;far away&#x27; to bDR...&quot; etc. which is how<br>
I used to do things.  I still have my names for different ways to move<br>
around the cube, in case the visual part is a bit weird, but I don&#x27;t<br>
use them as often.<br>
<br>
Again this is like changing the way that I read, it&#x27;s so fundamental<br>
to the way I think.  So anyway, it feels weird to memorize this way,<br>
but it is definitely faster.  Can&#x27;t wait until I get used to this.<br>
<br>
Thanks for showing me that my brain was broken!  I&#x27;m glad to finally<br>
be on the right track to fixing it.<br>
<br>
What worries me though is actually trying to read in a visual sense<br>
rather than with an internal dialogue.  I&#x27;ve been cubing for only 7<br>
years, but I&#x27;ve been reading for about 17 so that&#x27;s quite a lot of bad<br>
habit to break.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help guys!  It is very much appreciated!<br>

          <div class="email-content">BLD method<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve slept on it, and came up with a few ideas.<br>
<br>
Memorise a cycle of stickers, not cubies.<br>
<br>
Just need to get all the lead stickers on the same face and do a<br>
three-cycle, they can be on any face in any order, moves are also not<br>
restricted. Cycle with (F2UM&#x27;U2MUF2) and (F2U&#x27;M&#x27;U2MU&#x27;F2) or similar.<br>
<br>
Look at the patterns, if the cycle that returns to the piece returns<br>
to a sticker that is not the sticker of that at the start, the last<br>
edge in the cycle will need to be flipped with another flipped edge.<br>
<br>
Improvements; they don&#x27;t even have to be on the same face, a la the<br>
following:<br>
<br>
R U R&#x27; U&#x27; r R&#x27; U R U&#x27; r&#x27;<br>
r U R&#x27; U&#x27; r&#x27; R U R U&#x27; R&#x27;<br>
<br>
This lets you cycle around the LU, UF and UR stickers. &quot;this pattern ;)&quot;<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not any good with making up algs on the fly, but if I learnt a lot<br>
of algs with multiple ways to cycle the pieces, I&#x27;m sure this could be<br>
very powerful.<br>
<br>
Note: the following is a baad way to go about it.<br>
<br>
On swapping two sets of two pieces;<br>
<br>
Just solve them pochmann style, the corners will be fine at the end,<br>
and if pieces from the two sets need to be flipped, they cancel, if<br>
not, the flipped piece will be the buffer. Then you can use the buffer<br>
as one of the flipped pieces from the end of another cycle.<br>
<br>
On swapping one set of pieces;<br>
<br>
Swap them with the set of buffer corners, if the cycle that returns to<br>
the piece returns to a sticker that is not the sticker of that at the<br>
start, on the one at the start of the cycle,, pick the sticker that is<br>
the one at the end of the cycle to be the one at the start, then at<br>
the end, the buffer piece will be flipped, leaving you to flip it with<br>
another piece, or just fix the flipped buffer.<br>
<br>
And remember, memorise the patterns :)<br>
<br>
So, in what ways can this be improved? I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t the best<br>
way to go about this, I doubt it&#x27;s even a good way, in fact ;) The<br>
bits where you ahve two pieces to swap are really bad. But this is all<br>
I could think of for now. Maybe it shouldbn&#x27;t be for a full method,<br>
maybe just for little bits here and there.<br>
<br>
Hey, at least I&#x27;m thinking.<br>

&gt;  On swapping one set of pieces;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  Swap them with the set of buffer corners, if the cycle that returns to<br>
&gt;  the piece returns to a sticker that is not the sticker of that at the<br>
&gt;  start, on the one at the start of the cycle,, pick the sticker that is<br>
&gt;  the one at the end of the cycle to be the one at the start, then at<br>
&gt;  the end, the buffer piece will be flipped, leaving you to flip it with<br>
&gt;  another piece, or just fix the flipped buffer.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  And remember, memorise the patterns :)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  So, in what ways can this be improved? I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t the best<br>
&gt;  way to go about this, I doubt it&#x27;s even a good way, in fact ;) The<br>
&gt;  bits where you ahve two pieces to swap are really bad. But this is all<br>
&gt;  I could think of for now. Maybe it shouldbn&#x27;t be for a full method,<br>
&gt;  maybe just for little bits here and there.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  Hey, at least I&#x27;m thinking.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ok, so here&#x27;s my new method for permuting 3x3 edges, I call it &quot;M2 <br>
method&quot;. It&#x27;s very simple, fast, and 100% intuitive so you don&#x27;t need <br>
to learn a single alg for it.<br>
<br>
Of course it&#x27;s a 2-cycle method, one piece getting solved each time. <br>
The piece to be solved is at FD. Since I can&#x27;t just swap two pieces, I <br>
need to have some side effect. Here it is swapping (FU,BD)+(U,D)+(F,B)<br>
. Note FU and BD are solved relative to the M centers.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s an example solve, using scramble #28 from post #754 (http:<br>
//tinyurl.com/lytqj). It&#x27;s ready to be pasted into this page:<br>

-------------------- start --------------------<br>
[Scramble] U2 D2 L&#x27; U D2 R2 L2 D R D&#x27; B2 U D&#x27; F2 R2 U&#x27; F2 R2 B2<br>
<br>
[solve LU] (L U&#x27; L&#x27; U) M2 (U&#x27; L U L&#x27;)<br>
[solve LD] (U&#x27; L2 U) M2 (U&#x27; L2 U)<br>
[solve RF] (U R U&#x27;) M2 (U R&#x27; U&#x27;)<br>
[solve RU] (R&#x27; U R U&#x27;) M2 (U R&#x27; U&#x27; R)<br>
[solve BD] M U2 M U2<br>
[solve LF] (U&#x27; L&#x27; U) M2 (U&#x27; L U)<br>

[solve LB] (U&#x27; L U) M2 (U&#x27; L&#x27; U)<br>
--------------------- end ---------------------<br>
<br>
For M2 I use Joel&#x27;s finger trick, i.e. L (l&#x27; M&#x27;), using my left ring <br>
finger to pull the M&#x27;. My left middle finger holds the B stickers of <br>
LB+LBD, so my ring finger is free for the M&#x27; and my index finger is <br>
free for U&#x27;.<br>
<br>
Oh, and actually it was a bad choice to have BU already solved. It&#x27;s <br>
the easiest to solve, it looks like:<br>
[solve BU] M2<br>
<br>
So, how do you like it?<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; BLD method<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#x27;ve slept on it, and came up with a few ideas.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Memorise a cycle of stickers, not cubies.<br>
<br>
Yes, very good<br>
<br>
&gt; Just need to get all the lead stickers on the same face and do a<br>
&gt; three-cycle, they can be on any face in any order, moves are also <br>
not<br>
&gt; restricted. Cycle with (F2UM&#x27;U2MUF2) and (F2U&#x27;M&#x27;U2MU&#x27;F2) or <br>
similar.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Look at the patterns, if the cycle that returns to the piece <br>
returns<br>
&gt; to a sticker that is not the sticker of that at the start, the last<br>
&gt; edge in the cycle will need to be flipped with another flipped <br>
edge.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Improvements; they don&#x27;t even have to be on the same face, a la the<br>
&gt; following:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; r R&#x27; U R U&#x27; r&#x27;<br>
&gt; r U R&#x27; U&#x27; r&#x27; R U R U&#x27; R&#x27;<br>
<br>
The stickers don&#x27;t have to be in the same layer: S R2 S&#x27; R2. <br>
<br>
In fact, not having all the stickers in the same layer is more <br>
efficient, I think.<br>
<br>
&gt; This lets you cycle around the LU, UF and UR stickers. &quot;this <br>
pattern ;)&quot;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#x27;m not any good with making up algs on the fly, but if I learnt a <br>
lot<br>
&gt; of algs with multiple ways to cycle the pieces, I&#x27;m sure this <br>
could be<br>
&gt; very powerful.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Note: the following is a baad way to go about it.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; On swapping two sets of two pieces;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Just solve them pochmann style, the corners will be fine at the <br>
end,<br>
&gt; and if pieces from the two sets need to be flipped, they cancel, if<br>
&gt; not, the flipped piece will be the buffer. Then you can use the <br>
buffer<br>
&gt; as one of the flipped pieces from the end of another cycle.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; On swapping one set of pieces;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Swap them with the set of buffer corners, if the cycle that <br>
returns to<br>
&gt; the piece returns to a sticker that is not the sticker of that at <br>
the<br>
&gt; start, on the one at the start of the cycle,, pick the sticker <br>
that is<br>
&gt; the one at the end of the cycle to be the one at the start, then at<br>
&gt; the end, the buffer piece will be flipped, leaving you to flip it <br>
with<br>
&gt; another piece, or just fix the flipped buffer.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; And remember, memorise the patterns :)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; So, in what ways can this be improved? I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t the best<br>
&gt; way to go about this, I doubt it&#x27;s even a good way, in fact ;) The<br>

&gt; Hey, at least I&#x27;m thinking.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; ~Thom<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
Yeah... For some special cases, like 2 sets of 2 pieces... I am also <br>
not 100% what to do with those. <br>
<br>
Funny, with my old cycle method, I hated 12 cycles for the edges... <br>
Now I actually prefer them :).<br>

It sure looks interesting and intuitive!! Have you been trying this 
blindfolded too?!

I am not really sure if I understand how the M slice edges are 
handled... But it sure looks cool!

Not yet. But it&#x27;s already a lot of fun to do sighted :-)

For blindsolving I&#x27;d probably use the full-cubie version (that&#x27;ll be 
my name for both permuting and orienting a cubie). It&#x27;s very similar, 
but instead of using U you use B, which should be done as U after cube 
rotation, e.g.

[solve UR] x&#x27; (U&#x27; R U) M2 (U&#x27; R&#x27; U) x
[solve BR] (l U&#x27; R&#x27; U) M2 (U&#x27; R U l&#x27;)

> I am not really sure if I understand how the M slice edges are

- FD is the buffer and thus ignored
- BU is solved with M2
- FU and BD are solved relative to the M centers
  either with (M U2 M U2) or (U2 M&#x27; U2 M&#x27;)

Cheers!

Oh crap... clarification: Of course you don&#x27;t just use B *instead* of 
U but you use it *additionally*.

And actually I&#x27;d like to call the full-cubie version &quot;M2&quot; and the 
permute-only version &quot;M2p&quot;. I just wanted to demonstrate M2p first 
cause it&#x27;s so extremely sweet to execute and might even get the 
orient-first guys more interested :-)

Cheers!

Does this mean you have to keep track of where the centers are? 
Because I don&#x27;t really like to count during the solve...

FU can be solved, but how about UF? Or did I miss something?

You only need to count modulo 2. For me, I get that for free because I 
memorize in pairs anyway.

> FU can be solved, but how about UF? Or did I miss something?

Right, I forgot those. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;d do:

For UF and DB one of these:
B&#x27; M&#x27; (U&#x27; R&#x27; U) M (U&#x27; R U) B M2
U x&#x27; M (U R U&#x27;) M&#x27; (U R&#x27; U&#x27;) x U&#x27; M2

For UB one of these (they all do the same, I don&#x27;t understand the 
latter two but the first two are cool intuitive, you&#x27;ll like them):
(U B&#x27; R U&#x27; B) M2 (B&#x27; U R&#x27; B U&#x27;)
(U R&#x27; U&#x27; r&#x27; U&#x27; R2 U) M2 (U&#x27; R2 U r U R U&#x27;)
(M U&#x27;) (M&#x27; U) F2 (U&#x27; M) (U&#x27; M) U2 F2
(M&#x27; U&#x27;) (M&#x27; U) (M&#x27; U2) (M U) (M U) (M U2) (M&#x27; U2) M&#x27;

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">After a dramatic 3x3 BLD solve failure, I tried to do a solve of the 
corners by only visualising... And I succeeded :). I didn&#x27;t time 
myself, but memo wasn&#x27;t very fast, but execution was much faster 
than usual... Maybe I can get used to visualising like this. I will 
try it more often :).

          <div class="email-content">After a while it&#x27;ll be easy to memorise. I find it so easy to recall,
because you&#x27;re recalling something from the cube, not some numbers
that convert to something on the cube. When i switched from numbers to
&#x27;feeling&#x27; the patterns on the cube, I sped up my execution by a lot.
Memorisation caught up later, but it&#x27;s all pretty nifty. I don&#x27;t have
delays in my solving anymore at all.

Also, it&#x27;s good for when you&#x27;re doing a new puzzle (like 4x4x4 or
5x5x5) so that you don&#x27;t have to create new nouns or a new technique,
I memorised the entire 4x4x4 with visualisation of patterns.

Oh, now I switched to doing 3-cycles of solving permutation and
orientation at once, when something comes up I can&#x27;t do, I don&#x27;t
follow what I did in the earyer post and just fall back onto
pochmann&#x27;s method. Also, if there&#x27;s a 3-cycle I can&#x27;t setup instantly,
i can solve the next cubie and think of how I&#x27;ll setup the next
3-cycle while I solve the current 2-cycle.

It&#x27;s a good little addition to the method I&#x27;m using. Which is now a
mix of O then P for corners and 3-cycles and 2-cycles of O+P together
for edges.

I tried a few more times...

It&#x27;s fast when it works, but my accuracy is not too high with 
visualisation... But I like it, and I will practice it some more.

Thanks!

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

I&#x27;ve been working on memorizing visually again today, and here is what
I have been trying.

Rather than memorizing a sequence of instructions on how to follow a
cycle, I try to picture the entire cycle all at one time.  I picture
vectors instead of lines for each cycle and I try to picture all of
them at once, rather than think about each line individually.

Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that memorizing this way speeds up recall, since
you are picturing the entire cycle all at one time, it&#x27;s easy to see
what the next two pieces in your cycle will be since you&#x27;re thinking
about all the pieces left at once.

I really like memorizing this way!  It still feels weird, since I am
used to memorizing verbally, but I like it so far!

Joel how&#x27;s it going for you?

Chris

Hey Chris..<br>
<br>
I have tried doing the corners with visualisation a few times, and it <br>
seems to work fine.. Still have to get used to it, to get better <br>
accuracy. I so far only tried the corners (not the whole solve), and I <br>
got a lot of times in the 1:00 - 1:20 range. Well, for me that&#x27;s <br>
satisfying :). I&#x27;ll try to do some solves combining this with letters <br>
for the edges, and visualisation for the corners to see how that works.<br>
<br>
What I also noticed is that, allthough accuracy is not too good, I can <br>
do more succesfull solves in a short period of time, because I am not <br>
mixing up any symbols, and my brain doesn&#x27;t really get tired.<br>

            I have written my own strategy for 3*3*3 permutation memorisation. I feel memorising just 4 nouns will take much less time than the time you take to memorise the cornors permutation by anyother method. I agree that it takes time to master the phonetic sound and its value system.

That&#x27;s an interesting site.

Mnemonics are a less painful way to memorise
information. The down-side is that information has to
become encoded in a visual way and then decoded later
whereas rote memory is instant access to information.

Someone was writing about seeing patterns the other
day. And mnemonics are a way to memorise a range of
moves for handling a particular pattern; but it sounds
like a lot of people in this group are recognising
patterns and doing fine without using mnemonics or at
least, not using them for tackling patterns. And rote
memorisation should always be faster than mnemonics.

Having said that, your approach to using mnemonics is
commendable. You are taking hard-to-learn material and
making it easier to learn. Well done!!

I am developing a mnemonics-based solution myself. 
Before putting on the blindfold, I want to have
memorised edges and corners not where they are but
where they soon will be. I don&#x27;t know if that is
cheating. I want all green edge pieces to be in the
middle tier early on. So I am thinking about the moves
that will do that, then memorising those moves before
allowing the blindfold to be put on.
I have not listed the mnemonics but just the
principles.
http://www40.brinkster.com/mickcurtis/memory/Rubiks%20Cube/Rubiks%20Cube.htm

I would like to recommend something to anybody who
writes a blindfold solution and using notation
familiar to cube enthusiasts: why not include a link
early on to a site that gives a tutorial on that
notation and language. And it is good to re-read your
tutorial as if you are a reader who knows nothing
about the cube. That is, unless your target audience
is the cube enthusiast who now wants to go a step
further.

Mike PS. I liked the birthday maths tutorial.

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
<br>
Plenty of interesting posts lately, nice to see.  I thought I might <br>
as well post my way of doing the edge perms(already oriented) to see <br>
if anyone is doing something similar, and maybe someone will help me <br>
find improvements.  It&#x27;s based on Carr&#x27;s beginner and intermediate <br>
methods, links to which are in speedsolving group message #17059.  <br>
Sorry, this might get long and sound horrible, but that&#x27;s just <br>
because it&#x27;s harder to explain than do. <br>
<br>
The overall way is this:<br>
<br>
1. Get middle edges to the middle layer. (E layer)<br>
2. Finish solving middle layer. <br>
3. Get U and D edges to their layers.<br>
4. Solve U and D edges together in one. <br>
<br>
First, the edges are numbered, although I have converted those to a <br>
phonetic system, so I use sounds/letters now.  So, UF=t,d; UB=n; <br>
UR=m; UL=r; DF=L; DB=sh,ch; DR=k; DL=f,v; FR=p,b; FL=s; BR=x; BL=y.  <br>
It takes a while to learn those, but after a while you will see an <br>
edge and think of its sound/letter and not a number.  <br>
<br>
Take a recent scramble:  U2 D2 L&#x27; U D2 R2 L2 D R D&#x27; B2 U D&#x27; F2 R2 U&#x27; <br>
F2 R2 B2.     <br>
<br>
To memorize, I take two edges, make a word, then the next two edges, <br>
make another word, then combine those two words to get one image, and <br>
stick that image into a location.<br>
<br>
First, choose three locations; let&#x27;s say your front doorway, kitchen, <br>
and bedroom. <br>
<br>
So, starting in this case in the middle layer at FR, we have the UR <br>
edge=m; next to FL, we have DR edge=k.  So, first word= mac(guy I <br>
know, or the comp., or big mac).  Next, I go to BR, BL edge=y; BL, DF <br>
edge=l.  Second word= yell.  Combining the two words, I have mac yell<br>
(ing) in my front doorway.<br>
<br>
Continuing with the U layer in that way, we have at UF, BR edge=x; <br>
UB, UB edge=n; UR, DB edge=ch; UL, DL edge=f.  So, again making two <br>
words and one image, I have Exxon(gas pump) with a chef next to it, <br>
in my kitchen.<br>
<br>
Doing the D layer in the same way, going from DF-&gt;DB-&gt;DR-&gt;DL, we get <br>
r+ s; t+ b, or a &quot;rose in a tub&quot; in my bedroom.<br>
<br>
When I go to recall, I start at my front doorway, and recall mac <br>
yelling, or m,k,y,l.  So I know I have one middle edge already in the <br>
middle layer.  I now try to get the other three middle edges to the <br>
middle layer.  I do this one, two, three, or four edges at a time, <br>
depending on the setup.  <br>
<br>
In this case, I would try to get the two middle edges from the D <br>
layer to the middle layer.  I do this:  First I 3-cycle the D edges <br>
to get the two mid edges opposite one another, so: x2 R2 UR UR&#x27; <br>
U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27; R&#x27;U R&#x27;.  Now, this is what some may consider the hard part, <br>
but it really isn&#x27;t too bad(trust me). That is, the words change as <br>
you move edges around.  So, we had rose-tub; after the 3-cycle, it <br>
became red-bus.  Now, I move the mid edges from D to E layer:  x F M <br>
U&#x27; M&#x27; U2 M2 U2 M&#x27; U M&#x27; F&#x27; x&#x27;.  Once again, the words change; but now <br>
we can forget about FR and FL(solved); D layer is now: red-mac.  Note <br>
that &quot;mac&quot; doesn&#x27;t change when it moves to the D layer.<br>
<br>
Next, the UF edge must go in BR, but first I move BR to BL with: y <br>
(U2 R2)*3 y&#x27;.  That move changes a word on the U layer, exxon-chef <br>
becomes exxon-fish.  Now, I put UF in BR with:  U (M2 R&#x27;U&#x27; M2U2M2 U&#x27;R <br>
M2) U&#x27;.  This move swaps UL position with BR and UF with UB, so the U <br>
words are now:  lion-chef.  Middle layer is done.<br>
<br>
Now I get U and D edges to their correct layers; in this case, in two <br>
moves.  First:  U2 M2 U&#x27;D M2 U&#x27;D&#x27;.  That swaps all four; note the <br>
words stay the same, just switching from U and D; so U is now red-<br>
mac, and D is lion-chef.  Next:  D&#x27;y (D2 M&#x27; D2 M) y&#x27; D.  Now we have <br>
all edges on their correct layers; the U words are now: rod-man<br>
(Dennis), the D words are now: kill-chef.  Note:  no need to make <br>
images as the words-edges change position, verbal will be enough to <br>
recall.<br>
<br>
Finally, we solve U and D in one move from here; using U and/or D <br>
setup moves, there are 25 cases, 9 of which one layer will already be <br>
solved, so really only 16 to learn.  In this case:  y&#x27; U2 (U M S U&#x27; <br>
S2 U&#x27; S M&#x27; U) U2.<br>
<br>
Once you get used to the letters/sounds, moving them around is not <br>
too bad since not too many move at one time, and they mostly move <br>
together, or swap back and forth. <br>
<br>
You only need images and the locations for the initial setup, and <br>
even then, you might be able to just verbalize and then recall.  I <br>
find making images and using locations is effective when doing <br>
multiple cubes though.  <br>
<br>
I would welcome any suggestions for improvements, better moves, etc. <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

          <div class="email-content">1. First of all: I am very surprised to see my name in the list... 
Times in the 1:00-1:20 range were times where I only did the 
corners!! Whaha.. So I am not a top-BLD cuber at all... I hope to 
get better, but I am not making any plans for world records :).

2. It&#x27;s funny this comes up now... I have thought about designing a 
method like this for every three cycle that I can get, but using 
Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s method. So in my case, there will be 440 cases... 
And many of them are very similar... Anyway, memorising mulitple 
pieces with one noun is interesting and efficient :).

Bye!

Stefan Pochmann &lt;pochmann@...> escreveu:
  Ok, so here&#x27;s my new method for permuting 3x3 edges, I call it &quot;M2 
method&quot;. It&#x27;s very simple, fast, and 100% intuitive so you don&#x27;t need 
to learn a single alg for it.

Of course it&#x27;s a 2-cycle method, one piece getting solved each time. 
The piece to be solved is at FD. Since I can&#x27;t just swap two pieces, I 
need to have some side effect. Here it is swapping (FU,BD)+(U,D)+(F,B)
. Note FU and BD are solved relative to the M centers.

Here&#x27;s an example solve, using scramble #28 from post #754 (http:
//tinyurl.com/lytqj). It&#x27;s ready to be pasted into this page:
http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/wrapplet.asp

-------------------- start --------------------
[Scramble] U2 D2 L&#x27; U D2 R2 L2 D R D&#x27; B2 U D&#x27; F2 R2 U&#x27; F2 R2 B2

[solve LU] (L U&#x27; L&#x27; U) M2 (U&#x27; L U L&#x27;)
[solve LD] (U&#x27; L2 U) M2 (U&#x27; L2 U)
[solve RF] (U R U&#x27;) M2 (U R&#x27; U&#x27;)
[solve RU] (R&#x27; U R U&#x27;) M2 (U R&#x27; U&#x27; R)
[solve BD] M U2 M U2
[solve LF] (U&#x27; L&#x27; U) M2 (U&#x27; L U)
[solve RD] (U R2 U&#x27;) M2 (U R2 U&#x27;)
[solve FU] M U2 M U2
[solve RB] (U R&#x27; U&#x27;) M2 (U R U&#x27;)
[solve LB] (U&#x27; L U) M2 (U&#x27; L&#x27; U)
--------------------- end ---------------------

For M2 I use Joel&#x27;s finger trick, i.e. L (l&#x27; M&#x27;), using my left ring 
finger to pull the M&#x27;. My left middle finger holds the B stickers of 
LB+LBD, so my ring finger is free for the M&#x27; and my index finger is 
free for U&#x27;.

Oh, and actually it was a bad choice to have BU already solved. It&#x27;s 
the easiest to solve, it looks like:
[solve BU] M2

So, how do you like it?

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">But...wait...this scramble had oriented edges, right? well, for me not, &#x27;cause an edge is oriented for me if it can reach solved position within R2, L2, U, D, F, B; and for you I think is F2, B2, L, R, U, D...or no?
   
  well, this makes things a bit harder...for example...how would you solve FD -> LF? I&#x27;d do (D U2 F U2 D&#x27;) M2 (D U2 F&#x27; U2 D&#x27;)...but I think this is not a good idea...
   
  so, I think it need some improvement...at least for me, &#x27;cause if you don&#x27;t orient the edges before permuting, it will be hard...or no?

method&quot;. It&#x27;s very simple, fast, and 100% intuitive so you don&#x27;t need 
to learn a single alg for it.

Of course it&#x27;s a 2-cycle method, one piece getting solved each time. 
The piece to be solved is at FD. Since I can&#x27;t just swap two pieces, I 
need to have some side effect. Here it is swapping (FU,BD)+(U,D)+(F,B)
. Note FU and BD are solved relative to the M centers.

Here&#x27;s an example solve, using scramble #28 from post #754 (http:
//tinyurl.com/lytqj). It&#x27;s ready to be pasted into this page:
http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/wrapplet.asp

-------------------- start --------------------
[Scramble] U2 D2 L&#x27; U D2 R2 L2 D R D&#x27; B2 U D&#x27; F2 R2 U&#x27; F2 R2 B2

[solve LU] (L U&#x27; L&#x27; U) M2 (U&#x27; L U L&#x27;)
[solve LD] (U&#x27; L2 U) M2 (U&#x27; L2 U)
[solve RF] (U R U&#x27;) M2 (U R&#x27; U&#x27;)
[solve RU] (R&#x27; U R U&#x27;) M2 (U R&#x27; U&#x27; R)
[solve BD] M U2 M U2
[solve LF] (U&#x27; L&#x27; U) M2 (U&#x27; L U)
[solve RD] (U R2 U&#x27;) M2 (U R2 U&#x27;)
[solve FU] M U2 M U2
[solve RB] (U R&#x27; U&#x27;) M2 (U R U&#x27;)
[solve LB] (U&#x27; L U) M2 (U&#x27; L&#x27; U)
--------------------- end ---------------------

For M2 I use Joel&#x27;s finger trick, i.e. L (l&#x27; M&#x27;), using my left ring 
finger to pull the M&#x27;. My left middle finger holds the B stickers of 
LB+LBD, so my ring finger is free for the M&#x27; and my index finger is 
free for U&#x27;.

Oh, and actually it was a bad choice to have BU already solved. It&#x27;s 
the easiest to solve, it looks like:
[solve BU] M2

So, how do you like it?

Cheers!
Stefan

Yes, you can use this method after orientating the edges. However,

Yes, that&#x27;s correct. One thing you could do is do a y-rotation after 
orientation and before permutation, but that could result in different 
headaches :-)


>   well, this makes things a bit harder...for example...how would you

You mean FL, not LF :-). And nah, you really just use B instead of U. 
And an x-rotation helps make it easy to twist. So for LF/FL I&#x27;d do:

[solve LF] (U&#x27; L&#x27; U) M2 (U&#x27; L U)
[solve FL] x&#x27; (U L2 U&#x27;) M2 (U L2 U&#x27;) x

The idea is always:
- one move (out of U/U&#x27;/B/B&#x27;) to get BU out of M
- one move (out of L/L2/L&#x27;/R/R2/R&#x27;) to replace it with the target we 
really want
- undo that first of the three moves to get the real target into M

There are of course a few exceptions but this is the general idea.

Cheers!
Stefan

Another idea: Since only our E-edges orientation differs, you could 
solve as if you used mine and then finish the solve by flipping the 
E-edges.

Almost right. Notice that the two special treatments (cube rotation 
and extra move to get the piece out of the way) combine nicely. So 
it&#x27;s:

[solve BL] (r&#x27; U L U&#x27;) M2 (U L&#x27; U&#x27; r)

Btw, here&#x27;s the reason I chose to talk about FD instead of DF: With 
M2p, i.e. if edges are already oriented according to my scheme, this 
results in targets LF, LU, LB, LD, etc instead of FL, UL, BL, DL, etc. 
So the first letter stays the same and I liked that. Also, just by 
looking at the F sticker of FD (which is more natural than to look at 
the D sticker, unless you hold the cube weirdly :-) I&#x27;m able to 
determine the slice, i.e. whether the piece goes to L (if I see green)
, to R (if I see blue) or to M (otherwise).

Cheers!
Stefan

Btw, here&#x27;s the reason I chose to talk about FD instead of DF: With 
M2p, i.e. if edges are already oriented according to my scheme, this 
results in targets LF, LU, LB, LD, etc instead of FL, UL, BL, DL, etc. 
So the first letter stays the same and I liked that. Also, just by 
looking at the F sticker of FD (which is more natural than to look at 
the D sticker, unless you hold the cube weirdly :-) I&#x27;m able to 
determine the slice, i.e. whether the piece goes to L (if I see green)
, to R (if I see blue) or to M (otherwise).

Cheers!

Almost right. Notice that the two special treatments (cube rotation 
and extra move to get the piece out of the way) combine nicely. So 
it&#x27;s:

[solve BL] (r&#x27; U L U&#x27;) M2 (U L&#x27; U&#x27; r)

Cheers!

In case of odd parity, simply finish edges with this:
(D&#x27; L2 D) M2 (D&#x27; L2 D)

This will fix the M-slice and leave (UB,UL) swapped, which is what I 
need for my regular method for solving corners.

The only way to find out is to try it on yourself. Only then can you know <br>
exactly how long the high lasts and how much faster (slower?) you get. Do <br>
four or five 3x3x3 solves, keep track of your times, then drink a coke (or <br>

Actually, Chris, you should do at least a third run, one with a 
placebo, e.g. caffeine-free drink. Though make sure that you don&#x27;t 
know which is which, and that the taste doesn&#x27;t give you a hint. So 
maybe try drinks you don&#x27;t know yet. Or use something different, e.g. 
some caffeine powder mixed into the drink and some similar powder 
mixed into the other. Oh well, you get the idea.

Is it &quot;doping&quot;? Well, what exactly is doping? And why are some things 
forbidden in other sports? Practice makes better. Wearing a 
sharkskin-like swimsuit may help swimming faster. Eating a banana 
might help. I think everyhing should be allowed, including things like 
caffeine, unless they&#x27;re harmful. Cause really, why should something 
be allowed if it helped make you better? Practice isn&#x27;t forbidden, 
either, is it? The only reason I see for forbidding things is if 
they&#x27;re harmful. Both to protect the single person but also to protect 
the community as a whole, to prevent others from feeling a need to do 
harm to themselves in order to keep up with others.

And c&#x27;mon... worried about a coke???

Cheers!
Stefan

Include consonant clusters too as well as the regular stuff for 0-9 <br>
numbers.<br>

So 0-9 could be the normal stuff, and maybe 10=ch 11=sh 11=st 12=str <br>

Ok so that is a pretty nonsensical phrase, but I break it down like <br>
this.  &quot;TaCK THe BLue TRue Goo FLaSH&quot; is not hard to remember <br>

memorizing visually.<br>

<br>
With my rubik&#x27;s cube memory project,<br>
I want 1 image for any combination of 1234, 1243, 1324, etc.<br>
I often have situations where I have 4 edge pieces of the final <br>
layer and they need a memorised routine; or there are 4 corners in <br>
the wrong position and they need a memorised routine.<br>
<br>
What I have tried is to take the word &#x27;ROTA&#x27; and to make<br>
R = red = 1<br>
O = orange = 3<br>
T = white = 2<br>
A = yellow 4<br>
<br>
<br>
My final layer of the cube is the blue layer. Each of the 4 <br>
remaining edges is blue and one of the 4 colours listed.<br>
<br>
By that point, I think I need less than the 24 combinations of 1234.<br>
<br>
I made RTOA represent 1234 and I tried to make a word or phrase that <br>
sounds a bit like the first 3 letters. In this way, I made 24 images <br>
for the 24 combinations.<br>
<br>
I can associate each image with useful information now concerning <br>
the final edge moves of the cube or how to treat the cube in order <br>
to position some corners.<br>

Will you also learn corresponding 440 algorithms? That would be 
ultimately cool/fast :-)

<br>
I just read the link Marcus posted about the US memory championship.<br>
<br>
It sounds like I am using a similar method to how those guys <br>
memorize a deck of cards, just for centers with stories.  However, I <br>
can&#x27;t memorize the centers in 45 seconds, and they could probably do <br>
it in 10-20.<br>
<br>
I think I know why, I memorize my stories audibly.  I actually speak <br>
out the stories sometimes even, why is my brain broken and why do I <br>
not do things visually?????<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m going to try to memorize my stories silently (no internal <br>
dialogue) and just picture the elements of the story visually.  My <br>
method could not even speak through 52 cards in 45 seconds, because <br>
I would literally speak the words in my head.  Now I&#x27;m just going to <br>
do it visually and see how it works.<br>
<br>
Why is my brain broken???  This auditory memorizing does not seem to <br>
cut it for superfast times, and my brain just seems to work that <br>
way, it&#x27;s like that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m wired to think and I&#x27;m trying to <br>

          <div class="email-content">10:06 DNF off by 2 centers and 3 edges.

Done with loud music playing.

Visualizing the pictures for the center cycles rather than speaking
the story works well.

Also I&#x27;m still using rote memorization for the edges, but I tried to
picture groups of 3-4 edges together.  Also when solving I went REALLY
fast to try to get through everything I memorized before I would
forget it.

I can see sub-10 possible now.  I even used blocks here too, so it&#x27;
not that hard to include a block too.

It took me 5:18 to memorize this way, which is still a far cry from
2:30, but I can see how 2:30 is possible now.

I memorized the centers in 3:08 about (visually feels weird to me) and
the edges I got in about 1:40 and the corners in about 30 seconds.

Going to keep practicing this, I&#x27;ll post the next time I get a good
solve, and hopefully it will be with this new way of memorizing visually.

Yeah, that&#x27;s the same thing for me, I&#x27;m just a reader for now 
because I just started to learn a method for the 3x3x3 blindfolded, 
after 5 years of cubing. 
I think the 3x3x3 won&#x27;t be so difficult with practice but the 
5x5x5... maybe in the future ;-)
That&#x27;s interesting also to read about memory challenges in this 
group...

Like Gilles, I wish you all the best for the future ;-)

Thomas.

PS : Gilles, will you come to the french championship ?

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been doing some practicing tonight and I have noticed that I can<br>
memorize the centers of a 4x4x4 in about 1:30 on a really good attempt<br>
using the story method.  Now there are fewer incorrect centers than<br>
incorrect edges, so I assume if I were well practiced for a story<br>
method for edges I could do maybe 2:00 and about 30 seconds for the<br>
2x2x2.  That&#x27;s 4:00 right there.  And the better I can&#x27;t at using this<br>
story idea that faster the centers and edges will become.<br>
<br>
I use my same set of nouns as from the 5x5x5 +centers so I don&#x27;t have<br>
to create a new one.<br>
<br>
To do this I need 6 &quot;faces&quot; for the 24 edges, which as you can see is<br>
a bit weird to setup so I just use the 4 edges in each layer as my 4<br>
pieces, and that gives me 6 faces of 4.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not used to thinking of the edges in these 6 &quot;faces&quot; yet so my<br>
memorization is a good deal slower this way, but I think with more<br>
practice it could speed up my edges to the level of my centers, it&#x27;s<br>
just that the cycles would be longer for the edge stories.<br>
<br>
One problem is that I can&#x27;t cycle systematically for the edges, I just<br>
have to follow the cycles.  So to know which edges I haven&#x27;t used yet<br>
I have to count the number of edges in each cycle to make sure I don&#x27;t<br>
miss something.<br>
<br>
I do this by counting in base 5 with my feet.  &quot;14&quot; In base 5 is &quot;24&quot;<br>
in decimal which is really convenient.<br>
<br>
So I have 5 positions per foot (even though feet are relections of<br>
eachother I still do left side and right side of each foot as if I<br>
were looking at them, don&#x27;t reflect the directions for each foot.)<br>
<br>
0 = do nothing<br>
1 = pressure on the left side<br>
2 = pressure on the right side<br>
3 = press toes down hard<br>
4 = lift toes up hard<br>
<br>
Doing this I can encode my cycles while also counting them without a<br>
&quot;mental dialogue&quot; which is the old way I used to memorize and is<br>
slower than I would like.  I consider my right foot the ones digit and<br>
the left foot the 5&#x27;s digit.<br>
<br>
So say if I count a long cycle and count along and at the end my left<br>
foot is pressing toes down hard and my right foot is pressing hard<br>
right that&#x27;s a 17 cycle, so I need to account for 7 more pieces to<br>
memorize all 24.<br>
<br>
It sounds hard, but if I can memorize my edges as fast as my centers,<br>
or even close to it, I think getting used to base 5 counting with my<br>
feet is a small price to pay.<br>
<br>
What do you all think?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Sorry for the typos, I tend to get excited and hit post before really
reading through.

I meant that I use the 4 edges in each inner layer as a face.

Also &quot;44&quot; in base 5 is &quot;24&quot; in decimal lol, no idea what I was
thinking with &quot;14&quot;

The more I think about this, the more I wonder whether it is better to
count cycles by foot counting, or to go through and rehearse a cycle
once while also counting it.  I usually do the latter, but I would
prefer to be able to do one time through memorization like for
centers, so I think I may end up using the foot counting.  It&#x27;s
harder, but it allows me to do one time through memorization.

I&#x27;m very open to ideas about this, this is all new territory and seems
like it will take a lot of work.

To answer one question in advance that I think might get asked, I
think counting cycles is required for fast memorization for the edges.
 You can&#x27;t memorize a long cycle in a hurry and know whether you had
22 or 23 or 24 elements in it.  You have to have a precise way to know
whether you have a 23 cycle and you are done memorizing, or whether
you have a 22 cycle and you better hunt for that 2 cycle realy quickly.

          <div class="email-content">Oh wow I just thought of a huge problem with doing this idea, doing it<br>
means that when solving the 5x5 I can&#x27;t use my +centers set to go with<br>

of the cube which I could easily confuse parts from one with the other.<br>

Yeah maybe a sound-number system would be better.<br>

Aaaaaaah sorry for all the posts but I really am racking my brain for<br>

          <div class="email-content">  Dear Blindsolvers,<br>
               Being a grand master of memory and seeing all your interest, esp.Chris Hardwick, I am spending sometime on this group nowadays. The first method what came to my mind is explained here. It can be used for both CENTERS and  EDGES.<br>
               Hope you will appreciate my effort, though the method is not ok to you.<br>
   <br>
  PERSON, ACTION &amp; OBJECT METHOD :- <br>
          1). Name all the 24 center pieces in alphabetical order(A to X). Assign a person&#x27;s name (nouns) whom you know very well.<br>
        2). Think of an action (verbs) for every person, say kicking, killing, milking, washing, blowing, sucking etc<br>
        3). Select an object for all the 24 pieces again in the alphabetical order(A to X).<br>
        4). That is person/action/object for each piece. A person doing an action on an object is easy to vizualise and the action and object are already well known to you, the time taken here is much less than that of in story method.<br>
        5). How to associate is the beauty here. The person of the first piece should be associated with the action of the second piece followed by the object of the third piece.<br>
example :- 283. For number 2, the person name starting with B is BUSH, for number 8, the action of the 8th person(Hitler) is KILLING and for the number 3, the object is CAT.<br>
BUSH KILLING CAT. This can be vizualised as a picture much faster than story method using nouns.<br>
        6). In your memorisation, you are memorising continuously and after every cycle (ABC) you have to adjust your thinking for the next cycle(ADE), (AFG)etc. Every time you have to break your chain in the story you framed already. It restricts your flow of solving.You must have experienced it, haven&#x27;t you ? Here is my suggestion. Instead of memorising all the centers contnuously in 2 cycles, you can memorise them in 12 cycles(considering all the 24 pieces are to be solved).<br>
Example :- cycle-1:- 2,8,9,13,4,6,17,24,12,23,11,10,21<br>
           cycle-2:- 3,7,5,1,19,16,13,18,14,15,20,22<br>
Memorise cycle-1 as:- <br>
(2,8,9),(2,13,4),(2,6,17),(2,24,12),(2,23,11),(2,10,21)<br>
Memorise cycle-2 as:-<br>
(3,7,5),(3,5,1),(3,19,16),(3,13,18),(3,14,15),(3,20,22).<br>
        7).Storing(fixing) the picture in your brain:- This is the part I think all the blind solvers are not using except bernett and Stefan(hahaha....and of course me?!?). This helps you to avoid checking(revising) your memorisation after memorising it once. This is called journey method. For memorising 12 cycles, maximum you need is 12 locations. <br>
Example:- you select your house. Think of the order in which things are placed in your house. Say, 1).entrance door 2).Sofa 3).TV 4).Computer 5). Study table 6).dining table etc. Mentally rerun the locations in your mind again and again until it is very familiar to you. <br>
Now when you memorise the first cycle BUSH KILLING CAT, fix this picture or imagine this event happening in the first location of your house-ENTRANCE DOOR.<br>
Fix or imagine the second cycle event BUSH MILKING DOG (2,13,4)in the second location of your house-SOFA.<br>
       8)So, what should you do now:- <br>
(a).It might take few hours for you to prepare the 24 persons, 24 actions and 24 objects for all the 24 center pieces. <br>
(b).Then you must get used to them to get the exact place of the piece for all of them. <br>
(c).Prepare a journey with 12 locations and master them in the same order <br>
        9). Try yourself and experience it<br>
       10).Share your thoughts, ideas, ADVANTAGES, DISADVANTAGES and difficulties.<br>
Have fun,<br>
John Louis<br>
<br>
  P.S:- My next memorisation method for 4*4*4 is based on phonetic sound and its value. I am thinking on this line. Plz wait for some more time.        <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi John,

It&#x27;s funny.. I already have a system with 24 letters for memorising 
the edges (with Pochmann&#x27;s method), and a while ago, I was thinking 
of doing exactly this (person action and object)!! And then 
yesterday, I saw some people who memorise card decks also do 
this :). So it makes me more motivated to actually try this soon, 
allthough I am also working on an other memorisation method.

BTW, what kind of words are you using? Bush? Hitler? :p.. Okok, as 
long as you can memorise it well, it&#x27;s ok :).

Thanks for all your help and you tips. I will try this person, 
action and object method soon now!

By the way, the names of the persons, would they all have to have a 
unique first letter (A to X)?

- Joël.

Most of you know me, so I&#x27;m not gunna ramble, but I just joined this
group...I&#x27;ve been interested in starting BLD, but have been too lazy,
and I&#x27;ve been telling people I wanna learn...Any quick tips on where
to start???

And to Joel: I don&#x27;t think the names would have to start with
different letters, just as long as you relate that Name to that
Letter...How many people know people with the name Xavier???

That&#x27;s the reason X is one of the letters I don&#x27;t use... Actually, I 
only use 22 words of every category.

I am now trying to find 22 persons that can be associated with 
actions... Like &quot;Chuck Norris&quot; and &quot;Breaking/Destruct&quot;. :)... I 
already labelled the edges A-Z, so that wasn&#x27;t a problem.

Well, cyou!


Oh, Craig... About where to start. You can look at Macky&#x27;s page, 
that describes the cycle method a lot of ppl use. Or you can look at 
Stefan&#x27;s page... I think that method is quite simple... If you don&#x27;t 
understand something, meet me on MSN :).

If you memorize your story not &quot;free-style&quot; but associate each item 
with a location in a predefined journey, and know the numbers for your 
journey locations, then you immediately know how many items you&#x27;ve had 
so far.

Btw, the record has bee 34 seconds last time I looked (about two years 
ago) and has been slightly improved since then:
http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/memory.html#cards-speed

Back then I had a short conversation with Andi Bell and I also read 
his website where he explains (among other things) how he memorizes 
decks of cards, he uses that person/action/object method. His website 
was www.andibell.net but it&#x27;s currently not available, looks like it&#x27;s 
undergoing some reconstruction.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

That is a really good idea, I hadn&#x27;t thought of that.  I think using a
journey method would be much better than a freestyle method for the
4x4 and 5x5 edges, since you can&#x27;t apply any sort of system to how you
cycle them.  The centers is a bit different I think, with a picture
system, it&#x27;s really easy to know whether you&#x27;ve already used a piece
from a face and which one.  When I cycle back to orange say (places),
I don&#x27;t think of the pieces as orange pieces anymore, I just think
&quot;have I been to the south pole yet? ... yeah..  I&#x27;ve already crashed a
plane into the classroom, so that one is in there.  The Giant Hamster
already rampaged in my old neighborhood so that one&#x27;s there, ok yeah I
need to go to Germany now.&quot;

I can see how using a subject action verb system would allow you to
know whether you&#x27;ve hit a face already and how many times, just keep a
hierarchy still for each face.

          <div class="email-content">Hey John Louis,

Thanks so much for helping us with memory techniques!  I know it is
very much appreciated by a number of us, so thank you again!

I have one question though about the journey method.  I can definitely
see how using the journey method for 4x4 and 5x5 edges is a really
good idea because of what Stefan said, that it allows you the ability
to count the number of cycles by knowing the number of your places in
the journey method.

Also what happens if you have an odd cycle?  Say you have (1 5 6 7 9
4) that could be Aaron Escapes Feather - then Aaron Glues Image -
Aaron Destroys ...

How would you handle the missing object?  I can imagine Aaron trying
to Destroy the air and being frustrated that there is no object, that
would make the story funny and also the absence of an object would
tell me the last cycle is a 2 cycle.  Would that work?

Also I have a question about how I am using my stories.  If the Person
verb object method, combined with the journey method, is faster I
would very much like to switch to it.  However if there is any way I
can salvage the current system I have in any form I would like to do
that too.  For the centers I do everything via cause and effect.  I
make sure that the next item in the story is directly caused by the
one before it.  I also use a sentence structure sometimes which allows
me to combine a number of words into one sentence like idea.  So if I
have (Larry -> rubber duckie -> airplane) and I wanted to use cause
and effect I would have Larry push a rubber duckie with his finger,
and this would turn on a homing device showing the airplane where they
are and it flies over head.

If I wanted to use a sentence structure I would think &quot;Larry pets a
rubber duckie while on an airplane&quot;.  (Think Golom with the one ring..
&quot;my precioussssssssssss&quot;)  I wouldn&#x27;t think those words, I would just
picture Batman in an airplane seat petting the rubber duckie and just
know that Batman is perferming an action on the rubberduckie in the
place airplane.  I do that a lot too, subject object place and I add
my own verb between the subject and object.

Again, if this is slower please let me know and I&#x27;ll scrap it, or save
it for the 6x6x6 only or something and learn the journey method and
the subject-verb-object method for the 4x4 and 5x5.

Sorry to bombard you with so many question, but thanks so much for all
the help you&#x27;re giving us!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,
       It is further improved and the current record for card memorisation is 30.xy sec by Ben Pridmore (using stackmat, I think). The rules for card memorisation and recalling is completely different from memorising and solving cube blindfolded.
       For cards memorisation the maximum time given is 5 min. Even if you finished memorising in 30+ sec, you have to wait for the entire 5 min, of course without looking back the card physically. So, you have 4 min 30 sec left to revise or recall mentally what you memorised in that 30 sec.
       Then while recalling you need not recall mentally. Instead you are given a new pack of card and you have to rearrange the pack in the same order you have memorised in 5 min. Recalling time is not counted at any cost and only memorisation time is taken.
       Here while rearranging, if you forget anything you need not panic. Instead you can go ahead leaving that position vaccant until you arrange the rest of the cards. Sometime you may be left with 4 or 5cards also. Now looking at the  cards left, we can easily find out where they fit in from the vague picture of the card in our mind. 
       Such chances are not possible in blindfold solving!!
  My official personal best is 77.xy sec for cards(limca bookof records) and unofficial best is 48.xy sec.
  My unofficial 3*3*3 Bld solving is 6 min xy sec.
        www.andibell.net is not available for more than a year now.

What&#x27;s a 4 level system?

Would this be something like SVOP for subject verb object place?  Or
are there two objects, or two subjects?  Or subject verb adverb
object?  Or subject verb adjective object?  Or a mix?

If there is a way to encode 4 pieces at a time for memorizing a cube,
that has me very interested.  That would require only 6 pictures max
(and of course a great deal of work before hand to be able to do
that).  I think it would be a great deal of work, but would allow for
some fast times for memorizing a cube.

How exactly do the systems Simon described work?

     It is my pleasure sharing with you all.  

>I have one question though about the journey method.  I can definitely
see how using the journey method for 4x4 and 5x5 edges is a really
good idea because of what Stefan said, that it allows you the ability
to count the number of cycles by knowing the number of your places in
the journey method.
   
      yes, he is perfectly correct.

>Also what happens if you have an odd cycle?  Say you have (1 5 6 7 9
4) that could be Aaron Escapes Feather - then Aaron Glues Image -
Aaron Destroys ...

How would you handle the missing object?  I can imagine Aaron trying
to Destroy the air and being frustrated that there is no object, that
would make the story funny and also the absence of an object would
tell me the last cycle is a 2 cycle.  Would that work?
   
       That is correct. It works perfectly ok. I always use curtain to end it all instead of air in your example. A visual picture is always better.

>Also I have a question about how I am using my stories.  If the Person
verb object method, combined with the journey method, is faster I
would very much like to switch to it.  However if there is any way I
can salvage the current system I have in any form I would like to do
that too.  For the centers I do everything via cause and effect.  I
make sure that the next item in the story is directly caused by the
one before it.  I also use a sentence structure sometimes which allows
me to combine a number of words into one sentence like idea.  So if I
have (Larry -> rubber duckie -> airplane) and I wanted to use cause
and effect I would have Larry push a rubber duckie with his finger,
and this would turn on a homing device showing the airplane where they
are and it flies over head.

If I wanted to use a sentence structure I would think &quot;Larry pets a
rubber duckie while on an airplane&quot;.  (Think Golom with the one ring..
&quot;my precioussssssssssss&quot;)  I wouldn&#x27;t think those words, I would just
picture Batman in an airplane seat petting the rubber duckie and just
know that Batman is perferming an action on the rubberduckie in the
place airplane.  I do that a lot too, subject object place and I add
my own verb between the subject and object.
   
        Even in your cause and effect association you use some action verb like PUSH( you are really pushing everyone in this group)TURN, PET etc. Is itn&#x27;t? My question is why not you use the same to memorise one more piece? Thats why I feel this method PERSON/ACTION/OBJECT method is slightly advantageous. 

>Again, if this is slower please let me know and I&#x27;ll scrap it, or save
it for the 6x6x6 only or something and learn the journey method and
the subject-verb-object method for the 4x4 and 5x5.
       Initially it may appear bit slower than your usual method. But once you master the P/A/O and the location of pieces and journeys become habitual, you can really see the advantages of this method. Now, you have to put it into use and let us know the result - faster or slower.
   

>Sorry to bombard you with so many question, but thanks so much for all
the help you&#x27;re giving us!
       
        Not at all bombarding. It is my pleasure reciprocating what Stefan did and doing for Bernett and me. Plz share your experience.

Hey Chris,

it sounds to me like you&#x27;re thinking you can use either SVO or journey 
but not both. Why? I&#x27;ve been using SO+journey for quite a while now 
and I like it. Also, Andi Bell (and I guess many others) make a mental 
SVO scene and picture it on one location of the journey. So 17 
locations for a deck of 52 cards (if you memorize the last card just 
in short term memory).

Cheers!
Stefan

Would this be something like SVOP for subject verb object place?  Or
are there two objects, or two subjects?  Or subject verb adverb
object?  Or subject verb adjective object?  Or a mix?

If there is a way to encode 4 pieces at a time for memorizing a cube,
that has me very interested.  That would require only 6 pictures max
(and of course a great deal of work before hand to be able to do
that).  I think it would be a great deal of work, but would allow for
some fast times for memorizing a cube.

How exactly do the systems Simon described work?

Chris

Gosh, Chris, do you have any idea how hard I tried to find where that 
quote came from? I searched both this and the speedcubing group... 
next time please give us a hint, ok? :-)

Your question was to John and he probably has better knowledge and 
vocabulary, but here are my thoughts anyway.

There are two different levels of levels. I&#x27;d like to call one static 
and the other dynamic. Imagine you want to memorize a sequence of 60 
digits. You could translate each single digit into an image, this 
requires learning 10 static translations and you&#x27;d have a sequence of 
60 images. But that&#x27;s a waste, it&#x27;s much better to learn 100 static 
translations and encode each digit pair as one image, resulting in 30 
images. You could go further and learn 1000 images to encode digit 
triples to get 20 images, but that&#x27;s quite some work before you can 
start playing.

Besides these static levels you can also dynamically combine several 
images into one scene, for example three images using the SVO pattern. 
I call it dynamic because you don&#x27;t &quot;learn&quot; an encoding for the 
combinations, but instead make them up on the fly when you encounter 
them.

Using static level-2 and dynamic level-3 let&#x27;s you memorize 60 digits 
in 10 scenes. It requires preparing and learning 100 images and a 
journey of 10 locations.

Cheers!
Stefan

Haha, stackmats on their way to world domination :-)

Is that 30.xy official or unofficial? Are there unofficial record

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s pretty fun to do corner perms in two moves(ok, with U and D <br>
setup moves too).  Sometimes it can be quite fast; of course other <br>
times it&#x27;s  more difficult.  Anyhow, here it is:<br>
<br>
Move 1:  Get all U corners to the U layer so that the U layer <br>
permutation is even.<br>
<br>
Move 2:  Solve U and D corners in one move (using U and D setup <br>
moves, and possibly needing to exchange two edge pieces(if the D perm <br>
is odd))<br>
<br>
Take first a simple example:  Do on a solved cube:  R&#x27;BR&#x27; F2 RB&#x27;R2B&#x27;R <br>
F2 R&#x27;BR&#x27; to setup.<br>
<br>
Obviously, this could be solved with two quick corner 3-cycles.  But <br>
it could also be solved in one move:  x&#x27; RU&#x27;R D2 R&#x27;UR2UR&#x27; D2 RU&#x27;R x.<br>
<br>
To do the first move, there are these possible situations: <br>
<br>
1.)  4 or 3 D corners are on the U layer<br>
2.)  2 D corners are on the U layer, and they are diagonal one another<br>
(UFR-UBL or UFL-UBR) AND the 2 U corners on the D layer are adjacent <br>
one another (DFR-DFL,etc.).<br>
3.)  2 D corners are on the U layer, diagonal one another AND the 2 U <br>
corners on the D layer are diagonal one another (DFR-DBL or DFL-DBR).<br>
4.)  2 D corners are on the U layer, adjacent one another (ex. UFR-<br>
UFL) AND the 2 U corners on the D layer are adjacent one another.<br>
5.)  2 D corners are on the U layer, adjacent one another AND the 2 U <br>
corners on the D layer are diagonal one another.<br>
6.)  1 D corner is on the U layer.<br>
7.)  All corners are already on their correct layers.<br>
<br>
For #1, I do z2 giving me 1 or no D corners on the U layer (Stefan&#x27;s <br>
idea a while back), and use M2 S M2 S&#x27; to correct the centers later. <br>
(ok, this could be counted as a third move).    <br>
<br>
For #2, I use:  y&#x27;x RURU&#x27; (R&#x27;URU&#x27;)*2 R2 x&#x27;y<br>
<br>
For #3, I use:  FR&#x27; (U&#x27;RUR&#x27;)*2 U&#x27;RU F&#x27;<br>
<br>
For #4, I use:  (FU2M2U2)*2 or r&#x27;U&#x27;z&#x27;(U&#x27;RUR&#x27;)*3 ryL<br>
<br>
For #5, I use:  y&#x27;x R&#x27;U&#x27; (R&#x27;URU&#x27;)*2 R&#x27;UR2 x&#x27;y<br>
<br>
For #6, I use:  x (R&#x27;URU&#x27;)*3 x&#x27; or x&#x27;z&#x27; (R&#x27;URU&#x27;)*3 zx<br>
<br>
Of course, you might need to turn U and/or D to setup for those moves.<br>
<br>
Also, you need to setup so that the U layer becomes an even perm. <br>
<br>
So, after you have done the first move, and all corners are on their <br>
correct layers, it&#x27;s easy enough to solve each layer by itself.  But <br>
they can also be solved in one, using U and D setup moves.<br>
<br>
To solve U and D together, I&#x27;ve worked out 50 cases, 14 of which one <br>
or both layers will already be solved. <br>
<br>
You need to have a starting position for each layer, so you might <br>
need to move U and/or D to setup for the move.  Example:  If I have a <br>
3-cycle on U and a 3-cycle on D, I always line up the solved corners <br>
at UBL and DBL.<br>
<br>
There are 10 possible setups: solved, 3-cycle clockwise, 3-cycle <br>
counterclockwise, 4 corner adjacent swap, 4 corner diagonal swap, 2 <br>
corner adjacent swap, 2 corner diagonal swap, 4-cycle clockwise, 4 <br>
cycle counterclockwise, and what I call the z formation.<br>
<br>
If the D layer corners are odd, then the move I use swaps 2 edges <br>
also.<br>
<br>
Sample moves:  3-cycle + &quot;z&quot;: R2D2R2 F2D&#x27;R2 y&#x27; R2DR2D2 y R2D&#x27;<br>
4 corner adjacent swap + Adjacent swap: y&#x27;R2(U&#x27;R2)*3 U2B2R2 y U&#x27;R2U <br>
F2R2    <br>
<br>
Example corner solve:  Do: F&#x27;L&#x27;U&#x27;R F&#x27;B&#x27;L&#x27;UL&#x27;DF&#x27;L&#x27;F&#x27;UR&#x27;L&#x27;D2U&#x27;<br>
<br>
Move 1:  y&#x27;x RURU&#x27; (R&#x27;URU&#x27;)*2 R2 x&#x27;y<br>
Move 2:  U&#x27;D (U2F2 R2U R2U R2 y&#x27; U&#x27;R2 U&#x27;R2 y U&#x27;R2) D&#x27;U<br>
<br>
Note that move 2 also swaps edges FR-FL.<br>
<br>
Suggestions for improvements are most welcome; sorry for any typos or <br>
errors.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Haha, stackmats on their way to world domination :-)

Is that 30.xy official or unofficial? Are there unofficial record 
lists at all? Have people broken 30 seconds during practice?

That&#x27;s a very nice time! Well done.. I also didn&#x27;t look at the clock 
during memorisation, but I did do the solve at full speed afterwards

          <div class="email-content">Dear Chris,
             Here is my opinion about 4 level or 5 level system. 
  1).First of all, as you think it may reduce number of locations in a journey. But the time taken to memorise a 4 level may be twice or more as that of 3 level system.
  2).Then it becomes too much of prepared set of words and you have to search to find the words. Again it takes more time to memorise.More information in one location will be conjested and affects quick recall.
  3).You have to realise why memory athletes are going for 4 level and 5 level system. They are increasing it for want of journey, because they want to memorise 2400 random numbers, 3600 binary digits etc. In blindfold cubing, you don&#x27;thave to memorise so much numbers. 
  4).In memory sports, 3 hours time is there(1 hr to memorise + 2 hrs to recall).It is a marathan, where as blindfold cubing is a sprint. You can not afford to loose a second.
  5).In number sprint, many memory arhletes are using only P/A. Dominic , 8 times world champion has confirmed me this last time when I met him. 
  6).He has developed a system to prepare person for all the numbers from 00 to 99. Since my mother tongue is not English and the persons are alien to me, I have developed my own system using my mother tongue Tamil. If you are interested I shall mail you his system. But it is better to prepare your own.
  7).I am working on 3*3*3 as well. Bernett is just explaining me how he memorises and blindsolves 3*3*3 by orientation and permutation method.(I know only Stefan&#x27;s method).

Would this be something like SVOP for subject verb object place?  Or
are there two objects, or two subjects?  Or subject verb adverb
object?  Or subject verb adjective object?  Or a mix?

If there is a way to encode 4 pieces at a time for memorizing a cube,
that has me very interested.  That would require only 6 pictures max
(and of course a great deal of work before hand to be able to do
that).  I think it would be a great deal of work, but would allow for
some fast times for memorizing a cube.

How exactly do the systems Simon described work?

Chris

interest, esp.Chris Hardwick, I am spending sometime on this group
nowadays. The first method what came to my mind is explained here. It
can be used for both CENTERS and  EDGES.
>                Hope you will appreciate my effort, though the method
is not ok to you.
>    
>   PERSON, ACTION &amp; OBJECT METHOD :- 
>           1). Name all the 24 center pieces in alphabetical order(A
to X). Assign a person&#x27;s name (nouns) whom you know very well.
>         2). Think of an action (verbs) for every person, say
kicking, killing, milking, washing, blowing, sucking etc
>         3). Select an object for all the 24 pieces again in the
alphabetical order(A to X).
>         4). That is person/action/object for each piece. A person
doing an action on an object is easy to vizualise and the action and
object are already well known to you, the time taken here is much less
than that of in story method.
>         5). How to associate is the beauty here. The person of the
first piece should be associated with the action of the second piece
followed by the object of the third piece.
> example :- 283. For number 2, the person name starting with B is
BUSH, for number 8, the action of the 8th person(Hitler) is KILLING
and for the number 3, the object is CAT.
> BUSH KILLING CAT. This can be vizualised as a picture much faster
than story method using nouns.
>         6). In your memorisation, you are memorising continuously
and after every cycle (ABC) you have to adjust your thinking for the
next cycle(ADE), (AFG)etc. Every time you have to break your chain in
the story you framed already. It restricts your flow of solving.You
must have experienced it, haven&#x27;t you ? Here is my suggestion. Instead
of memorising all the centers contnuously in 2 cycles, you can
memorise them in 12 cycles(considering all the 24 pieces are to be
solved).
> Example :- cycle-1:- 2,8,9,13,4,6,17,24,12,23,11,10,21
>            cycle-2:- 3,7,5,1,19,16,13,18,14,15,20,22
> Memorise cycle-1 as:- 
> (2,8,9),(2,13,4),(2,6,17),(2,24,12),(2,23,11),(2,10,21)
> Memorise cycle-2 as:-
> (3,7,5),(3,5,1),(3,19,16),(3,13,18),(3,14,15),(3,20,22).
>         7).Storing(fixing) the picture in your brain:- This is the
part I think all the blind solvers are not using except bernett and
Stefan(hahaha....and of course me?!?). This helps you to avoid
checking(revising) your memorisation after memorising it once. This is
called journey method. For memorising 12 cycles, maximum you need is
12 locations. 
> Example:- you select your house. Think of the order in which things
are placed in your house. Say, 1).entrance door 2).Sofa 3).TV
4).Computer 5). Study table 6).dining table etc. Mentally rerun the
locations in your mind again and again until it is very familiar to you. 
> Now when you memorise the first cycle BUSH KILLING CAT, fix this
picture or imagine this event happening in the first location of your
house-ENTRANCE DOOR.
> Fix or imagine the second cycle event BUSH MILKING DOG (2,13,4)in
the second location of your house-SOFA.
>        8)So, what should you do now:- 
> (a).It might take few hours for you to prepare the 24 persons, 24
actions and 24 objects for all the 24 center pieces. 
> (b).Then you must get used to them to get the exact place of the
piece for all of them. 
> (c).Prepare a journey with 12 locations and master them in the same
order 
>         9). Try yourself and experience it
>        10).Share your thoughts, ideas, ADVANTAGES, DISADVANTAGES and
difficulties.
> Have fun,
> John Louis

>   P.S:- My next memorisation method for 4*4*4 is based on phonetic
sound and its value. I am thinking on this line. Plz wait for some
more time.

          <div class="email-content">Hi John Louis,

Thanks again so much for your help.  I really do appreciate it, and I
know a number of us here do as well.

I do have one more question for you, I seem to never end with them do
I? :-)

For memorizing with P/A/O I feel that it would be best to memorize 3
pieces at a time to speed up the memorization.  This presents an issue
with solving.

Say I have Bellboy Arrests Cat at my first location, then Dan Throws
Umbrella at my next location.

As cycles this is (Bellboy Arrests Cat) followed by (Bellboy Dan
Throws) followed by (Bellboy Umbrella ....) etc.

My stories as I use them now are often interrupted in weird places by
my cycles, but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me, the speed at which I can
memorize is well worth having to break up my encoding in weird locations.

I think this will be the case for P/A/O as well.

I do not like idea of memorizing as:
Bellboy Arrests Cat at my first location, then Bellboy Destroys Tree
then Bellboy uproots .....  I think this will be too slow to add 2
pieces into a picture each time, and always use the first spot (here
Bellboy) in each picture.

What do you think?  I prefer to encode three unique items per picture,
and just have the encoding by interupted in weird locations by the
cycles, I already do this with my stories and am comfortable with it.

I am very curious what you think though.

          <div class="email-content">Dear Chris,
  1). If you have 3 different P/A/O in every location and very comfortable with decoding at weird places, that is fine. In my opinion it slows down your solving speed. (Something like solving cross slowly in order to look ahead 1st F2L piece is better than solving cross faster and stops to find first F2L).
  2).Since you got used to that, you feel comfortable. But, I think it slowsdown solving speed.
  3). If you have same person in each location doing differnt action on different object is much easier to remember and your thoughts will be fluent. You will not and need not stop solving to think.
  4). In worst case, if you are not able to retrive the person in a particular location quickly, you will be in trouble in the system you are following already. If you have the same person in each location, the retrivel will be much easier.
  5). It is all just my opinion. You have to try both to come to a decision. Warning! first master the P/A/O before taking decision.
  Good luck

i think the person/avtion/object-method takes too long to memorize but is<br>

It&#x27;s interesting to read all the memory experts&#x27; advice, and it&#x27;s <br>
great to have one among us here in John Louis.  I am a total amateur <br>

cube for almost 4 years, so I can relate what I as an amateur have <br>
experienced.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve known of many of these techniques for 15 years or so, since <br>
first reading Lorayne&#x27;s book. I started blindfold cubing in July <br>
2002, after learning from Richard Carr.  Since I already knew the <br>
phonetic and journey systems, I could see how they might apply to <br>
memorizing a cube blindfold.  Since then, I have tried many ways to <br>
memorize the cube; as yet none has felt as comfortable as the way I <br>

<br>
I&#x27;m a terrible visualizer (rote?) cube memorizer, but I guess I use <br>
some of that when memorizing the orientations when solving one cube - <br>
but never with the perms.  I&#x27;m very impressed with those who can <br>
visualize shapes, etc; for me it is just too hard. <br>
<br>
At first I linked images together; later seeing that that was too <br>
slow, I changed to the journey system.  <br>
<br>
I also tried once making a list of persons-actions-objects, but was <br>
not comfortable with persons, since they seemed too much the same to <br>

Indeed, multiple cubes done this way are not &quot;hard&quot; (if an average <br>

  Chris,Joel - a warning for you both. If you memorise a cube in a journey applying all the above priciples, then you can not use the same journey for memorising your next cube atleast for a day. It is because you will be having the picture you have stored in the location remains atleast for a day. When you memorise the next cube, the previous one interferes. Thats why mentally tune yourself to prepare more journeys. <br>
  Same journeys you can you to memorise your college subjects as well!!!<br>

Yeah, I noticed that as well. Two days after I solved the 5x5 at 
Euro2004 I could still remember the whole cube, even though I hadn&#x27;t 
recalled it again in the meantime. A full month after the solve and 
still without further recall (except that one time two days after the 
solve) I tried again and I still knew maybe 70-80%.

Oh well, in that case I didn&#x27;t even try to &quot;overwrite&quot; the old data 
with a new solve, so I can&#x27;t tell how well that would&#x27;ve worked. Also, 
it was the very first time I used that journey and I had built it 
mostly in the hour before the attempt, so that cube had a very strong 
binding with that journey...

Cheers!
Stefan

Hmm, on the other hand... I&#x27;m quite sure I&#x27;ve used the same journey 
for 3x3 blindsolving several times on one day. For my average-of-10 I 
used a journey of around 60 locations and when I got to the end I 
continued at the start again. I think I used the first few locations 
for three cubes in those two hours.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi John!

I was already wondering how it would work with this method, and if I 
would be able to do multiple cubes in a row without problems...

Is it really impossible to use the same journey the same day, even 
with an hour, or 30 minutes in between? Well.. I guess I will have 
to prepare more journey&#x27;s then :).

I am already trying to let my imagination make the images, and it 
leads to some very funny ones if I take 3 words and let my 
imagination add some random elements to the situation. Like you 
said: memorising this way can make it more fun!

because you will be having the picture you have stored in the

the previous one interferes. Thats why mentally tune yourself to 
prepare more journeys.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Thomas,

Do you think the PAO method takes too long to design the system and 
memorise/learn all the words and their corresponding positions, or 
do you think memorisation of the cube takes longer? If so, can you 
explain to me why you are so sure that PAO method will slow me down? 
I actually started using it, and I am convinced it will make me 
faster drastically... I am still getting used to the system now, 
though I am sure, once I can read the cube (convert the pieces into 
images faster) instantaneously, this is a very fast method...

I have been trying the PAO method a couple of times now (for speed), <br>

I like the memorisation method, but it&#x27;s harder to get used to this <br>

John Louis, I read that people who use this PAO method for 
memorising cards really convert 3 cards into an image automatically. 
Now, I assume not everybody can get to this level, but how fast will 
the average individual be able to do this after practicing? And how 
long will the average person have to practice to get good results?

I guess I just want to hear that it&#x27;s normal that I have to get used 
to this method, and that practice will improve my times now.. :).

Anyway, thanks for all your help, John.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Joel,

I ran into a similar problem with my stories for the centers on the
4x4 and 5x5.  But with a lot of practice now I don&#x27;t even do the
conversion, if I see the piece reF that&#x27;s a space ship, or lbD that&#x27;s
a knife.

I think (or hope rather) that using PAO will be the same with enough
practice.

I&#x27;ve only tried memorizing one 4x4x4 edges permutation with my journey
and words so far, but I had my sheet there in front of me to make sure
I got my images right.  I still need to work on memorizing my pieces
for the PAO part, but I will try a solve this way soon and see how it
goes.

Hope things are going well for you Joel, and let&#x27;s keep eachother
motivated to learn this!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris!

Yes! We should keep each other motivated on this... In fact, I also 
tried motivating some Dutch cubers for this, because I would like 
some competition on the national level in this... But of course, 
trying to get at the same level as guys like you is also good 
motivation :).

I know that converting the information faster must be possible... It 
must be possible to see three pieces of the cycle, and almost 
instantly (in 1 second) know the image in your mind... Because 
that&#x27;s what must be going on with people that are memorising decks 
of cards... I really hope I can do something similar with memorising 
cubes.. Well.. I guess it takes a lot of practice :). 

I do notice that with practice, it becomes easier to make the 
stories every time, and I feel I am approaching my old memorisation 
speed. So... More practice I guess!!

Good luck Chris!

Yeah, and I&#x27;m joining you guys now. I&#x27;ve used PO for a while but never 
practiced blindsolving much. Now I finally want to be able to solve 
4x4 and 5x5 faster, especially centers, and I&#x27;m going to try it 
somewhat like Chris has already but with PAO. I have about 15-20 PAO 
triples now, gonna complete them soon and solve 4x4 centers with them. 
In Orlando, just analyzing and memorizing the X-centers of the 5x5 
took me disgusting 45 minutes...

Cheers!
Stefan

You told me about memorising the 5x5 in Orlando..! I think systems 
like this could be very feasable for the larger cubes, because there 
is so much information.. But I don&#x27;t have any experience with larger 
cubes, so I don&#x27;t know if I am right.. :).

Well.. Good luck.. and cyou in April... It&#x27;s getting closer :).

Yeah, it does work (at least PO worked well for me). Actually my huge 
problem was not memorization but analysis. Cause I can&#x27;t just read 
where the center pieces go, I must decide myself and keep track for 
which pieces I&#x27;ve decided already. My previous method (keep a finger 
pointing into each face) sucks badly. Using a better developed memory 
method (like Chris&#x27;s) will hopefully help me to turn this ugly part 
into an ok part (I doubt I&#x27;ll ever really like it).

Cheers!
Stefan

P.S. now 23 triples :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,<br>
<br>
Glad to know you&#x27;re trying this too!  You&#x27;re definitely one of the<br>
memory masters among us cubers, so it would be good to see what type<br>
of things you can do with a really good technique.<br>
<br>
As for the analyzation the hierarchy on each face works really well<br>
for me, and makes it really easy to know which spots on a face you&#x27;ve<br>
filled already.<br>
<br>
So for people I have<br>
Larry &gt; Batman &gt; Terminator &gt; Spiderman<br>
<br>
and if I were using my letters for the centers (I&#x27;m thinking about<br>
this too, since my journey could easily contain the 4x4 centers and<br>
edges even if both were setup as 12 transpositions as a worst case)<br>
then I would just have A-D on the first face and A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D<br>
<br>
Also, you get to the point where you don&#x27;t even have to think about<br>
the hierarchy much, I just think &quot;Ok I&#x27;m back to people so far and two<br>
pictures ago Batman threw a Rubber duckie at the Giant Hamster so I<br>
need the Terminator now&quot;<br>
<br>
Also, I am considering keeping my picture for the centers the way I<br>
have them now and trying to add more characteristics to them.  I wnat<br>
every place to have a related verb and object and noun.  So my verbs<br>
face needs a suject and an object per piece, and my people face needs<br>
verbs.<br>
<br>
I already do this to some extent with the verbs face.  An Ironman<br>
bicyclcist is the people version of the competing in the ironman<br>
competition verb.  I want to really systematize this and maybe even<br>
add it into my journey and hopefully be able to memorize the cetners<br>
even more quickly.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not looking forward to coming up with multiple journeys but I do<br>
like the idea of not having to fight through interference and just<br>
using a different journey.<br>
<br>
So much work to do, but I think it will definitely be worth it.<br>
<br>
I also can&#x27;t wait until I am very familiar with these nouns from the<br>
4x4 and can try a subset of them on the 3x3x3.  I think I could<br>
definitely memorize much more quickly on the 3x3 if I took 3 pieces at<br>
a time into a picture, rather than trying to visualize lines inside<br>
the cube.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m very excited to be learning such a powerful technique!  I tried a<br>
4x4 edges solve with my new PAO triplets and my journey and sadly had<br>
an execution error and forget to undo a setup turn.  But I will work<br>
on it and let you guys know when I get my first edges solve this way.<br>
<br>
I may try to use these pictures in March for my world record attempt,<br>
but I&#x27;m not sure if I will be ready for using them yet.  I hope I will<br>
be, I can already tell that this will make my edge memorization much<br>
faster.<br>
<br>
Keep us updated Joel and Stefan, and I will do the same!  This is all<br>
very exciting!<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris..

Singing to an umbrella..?! I would immediately think that he would 
be singing the song &#x27;singing in the rain&#x27; - under an umbrella :).

I really try to use my imagination to make the images, to make sure 
I won&#x27;t forget them... I also try to have different characters 
respond differently in different situations.. It takes time to get 
used to it, but my memorisation times for this method are slowly 
getting faster.. And the memorised information feels more &#x27;secure&#x27; 
than when I just repeat a lot of information of the cycles every 
time.

For example when I have &#x27;Jolanda Investigates the Microwave&#x27;, she&#x27;s 
hitting the mircrowave, getting mad on it, saying &#x27;WHY ARENT YOU 
WORKING?!&#x27;   (Jolanda always overreacts on emotions)

But when LarsV investigates microwave, he&#x27;s more doing scientific 
tests on it :). (LarsV is more like a serious and focussed person)

This way, I won&#x27;t forget the persons who are doing it.

Hope that helps,

Joël.

but I want to keep it as friendly to what I do for the 3x3x3 as I can <br>

What I hope someone could help me with is an algorithm that will flip <br>
two individual opposite edges,  something like fixing an edge <br>
orientation parity on a regular solve,  but instead of two edges side <br>

          <div class="email-content">Chris, Joel and Stefan,
             If you just have learned to ride a cycle or drive a car, how fast you can ride or drive subconsciously. After a month you are better off. Now everything has become second nature even when you are super fast. 
             Similarly, just imagine how superfast you will be after a month long, year long practice in PAO method.
             For card memorisation most follows only 1 image per location(52 locations), few follows PA method and very few follows PAO method. Their requirement is speed and not number of locations in spirnt events. I use 1 image per location. 
             After a long long long time, I just tried memorising a pack of card using one image in 1 location(I just took the objects) and did well in 58 sec. I blindsolved 3*3*3 by stefan method(1 image in1 location, againI just took the object). Memorisation 2 min 18 sec and total time 8 min 27.91 sec. I am very very slow in reading cube and I do not finger the cube.Still I am very happy with my result. Only if I practice and learn to finger cubes, I can improve. I just can not expect overnight miracle. 
            Practice patiently like Stefan always does, you will be sub 1 min in 3*3*3 and sub 10 min in 4*4*4. Practice, practice, practice. Only practice makes perfect, but only effective practice makes improvement. You all know these pretty well. I am just trying to motivate you, when you start feeling the learning curve starts declining now having increased initially. That is the natural rhythm of learning.
            If you learn phonetic sound and its value, it is possible to memorise all 8 cornors in 1 PAO and all 12 edges in 2 PAO in 3*3*3. Plz give me some time and I shall explainit in a couple of days.
            Happy blindfold cubing.

          <div class="email-content">Joel,
      It is not just thinking of a P doing some A on an O at a particular location. The knack of memorisation is very important. This is where you need practice. 
  Let me give it in a very simple way.
      When you want to learn anything new, associate it with something already you know very well.
  How to associate ? Associate it ridiculously.
  How to make it ridiculous? By either exaggerating the size, exaggerating the numbers or substitute.
  Finally, vizualise the ridiculous imagination in your MINDS EYE atleast for a fraction of second. This is the part initially takes more time. You start with say 5 sec per PAO. Slowly it can be cut down to 0.5 sec with practice. 
   
  Happy blindfold cubing!

  Hey Chris..

Singing to an umbrella..?! I would immediately think that he would 
be singing the song &#x27;singing in the rain&#x27; - under an umbrella :).

I really try to use my imagination to make the images, to make sure 
I won&#x27;t forget them... I also try to have different characters 
respond differently in different situations.. It takes time to get 
used to it, but my memorisation times for this method are slowly 
getting faster.. And the memorised information feels more &#x27;secure&#x27; 
than when I just repeat a lot of information of the cycles every 
time.

For example when I have &#x27;Jolanda Investigates the Microwave&#x27;, she&#x27;s 
hitting the mircrowave, getting mad on it, saying &#x27;WHY ARENT YOU 
WORKING?!&#x27;   (Jolanda always overreacts on emotions)

But when LarsV investigates microwave, he&#x27;s more doing scientific 
tests on it :). (LarsV is more like a serious and focussed person)

This way, I won&#x27;t forget the persons who are doing it.

Hope that helps,

JoÂ¤l.

Uh, orient 4x4 edges without permuting them? That&#x27;s not even possible

Something like this?
(r U2) (r U2) x (U2 r) (U2 l&#x27;) x&#x27; (U2 l) (U2 r2)

yesterday i created my PAO-list for corners. it is attached to this mail. i<br>
dont know if it was a good choice, i have not only persons but also animals.<br>
when you (john, joel) say, that this list is ok, i will learn it. my problem<br>
is that i&#x27;m a bad and slow cuber. memorizing is not the problem. 2 years ago<br>
i also memorized card decks (32) and at school i played blindchess against 3<br>
players at the same time. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Matt,<br>
<br>
I saw your post and felt I had to respond.  The very first time I <br>
did a 4x4x4 blindfolded I did the 4x4x4 supercube, and I used a <br>
method very similar to what you&#x27;re talking about here - and it took <br>
me about 5 hours to successfully blindfold solve my cube.<br>
<br>
The method you are talking about, slowly pair up the edge pieces <br>
into edge piece groups and then move them around the cube just like <br>
the 3x3x3 is what I did, and that method is such a horrible, <br>
terrible idea.  Please don&#x27;t try it..... ever...  please....<br>
<br>
Something that would be much better, is to learn Stefan&#x27;s method and <br>
cycle the edge pieces to their correct locations directly (edges on <br>
the 4x4x4 only have a position, it is impossible to &quot;flip&quot; a 4x4x4 <br>
edge, that has no meaning for this type of edge).  Then you can use <br>
a similar method to move the centers using two cycles one by one.<br>
<br>
Please don&#x27;t try to pair up the edges like a 3x3x3 and then move <br>
them in groups.  I&#x27;ve tried it, it will take you about 5 hours to <br>
do.  When I first switched to a different method using cycles to <br>
move pieces directly it took me 1 hour and 30 minutes roughly.<br>
<br>
If you like doing two swaps, then please look into Stefan&#x27;s method <br>
for solving the 4x4x4, it will be much better than trying to solve <br>
as a 3x3x3.  I say that because I&#x27;ve tried solving the 4x4x4 similar <br>
to a 3x3x3, and that is about the worst way you can solve in that it <br>
takes so incredibly long to do, and if you make even one mistake in <br>
your almost 5 hours of solving you will get a DNF and open your eyes <br>
to a scrambled cube.<br>
<br>
Also as far as 2 swaps go I use this one to swap only two edges.  It <br>
preserves absolutely everything on the cube, even centers, but it&#x27;s <br>
a long algorithm and I hate it.<br>
<br>
r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2 R L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R L U2 L&#x27; <br>

I believe this preserves everything except r=

center twice (sorry if I&#x27;m wrong, I&#x27;m trying to imagine=
 it&#x27;s affect 
without a cube handy) so just tack on R L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R L U2 =
L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27;
to the end making it (r U2) (r U2) x (U2 r) (U2 l&#x27;) x&#x27; (U2 l) (U2 =

r2) R L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; to make it centers safe to be

Hope this helps, and please loo=

(using 2 cycles) to be comfortable!

Yeah,  that was a horrible explanation.  Edges will be permuted in <br>
this step,  but not into their correct positions.  That will come <br>
next,  but part of my memorization will account for that.   <br>
<br>

<br>
Ok,  I know you&#x27;re right because it has taken me forever for this <br>
step and I think I&#x27;ve just been stubborn to try something too new.  <br>
Which doesn&#x27;t make much sense even to me because this is a new <br>
challenge anyway.<br>
 <br>
&gt; Something that would be much better, is to learn Stefan&#x27;s method <br>

&gt; edge, that has no meaning for this type of edge).  <br>
<br>
Is there an explanation on this group for this?  Is this the <br>
algorithm he uses to pair the edges R U R&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr) R&#x27; U R U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27;?  <br>
I&#x27;ve looked on his site before at the 3x3x3 solution and it is <br>
similar to what I do.  I&#x27;ll look back through the archives,  I may <br>
have missed something.<br>
<br>
&gt; Then you can use <br>
&gt; a similar method to move the centers using two cycles one by one.<br>
<br>
How do you do this?  The only way I know two cycled centers is <br>
switching them in blocks of two and then I would use a three cycle <br>
to fix the edge permution. Is there a better way?<br>
<br>
&gt; Please don&#x27;t try to pair up the edges like a 3x3x3 and then move <br>

I&#x27;m convinced.  Thanks for steering me away.  I knew it couldn&#x27;t be <br>
good,  but like I said,  I can be stubborn.  I&#x27;m ready to start <br>
fresh.<br>
<br>

Yeah, like Chris said, it&#x27;s much better to just solve pieces directly 
to where they belong.

Using the above alg for 4x4 like using the T-perm for 3x3 (with my 
method) is probably the easiest way. Just for fun here are the setup 
lengths:

Distance 0:  2 edges (if you also use the neighbour-swap alg)
Distance 1:  3 edges
Distance 2: 13 edges
Distance 3:  5 edges

Average number of setup moves: 1.91

Cheers!
Stefan

Oh oh oh... better idea, better idea :-)

In addition to that alg, use the alg after x&#x27;-rotation (and rotate 
back at the end). Results in:

Distance 0:  3 edges (if you also use the neighbour-swap alg)
Distance 1:  5 edges
Distance 2: 12 edges
Distance 3:  3 edges

Average now: 1.65 setup moves (all only outer-slice turns, btw!)

Cheers!
Stefan

Hmm, have you seen my message right before yours where I arrive at 1.
65 setup move average? That&#x27;s a method for 4x4 edges in 2-cycles.

Cheers!

Hmm.. I don&#x27;t really see how that can be convenient for the edges.. :
(. And I think I prefer three cycle for the edges anyway.. I was 
talking also talking about centers :p.

          <div class="email-content">Joel, well done! keep it up. Is it including memorisation ? You can try phonetic sound and its value system for cornors.

          <div class="email-content">Hello John,

Yes, all my times include memorisation.

For the corners, I don&#x27;t first orientate them and cycle them 
afterwards. I use Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s system for the corners... For 
memorisation this means I need 24 &#x27;letters&#x27; or other &#x27;objects&#x27;, and 
memorise about 7 of them. I don&#x27;t think I want to use PAO for this 
too.. Do you have another idea?

having practiced the 4x4x4 edges with PAO a lot lately.<br>
<br>
I can see how flawed my old approach is for memorizing.  I have a <br>
lot of opportunities to miss a piece because there is no structure, <br>
and if I don&#x27;t make an effort to memorize my stories very very <br>
visually I may miss a more abstract element.<br>
<br>
I like the structure of PAO a lot, and will definitely try to make <br>
it my main method.  Unfortunately I&#x27;m not ready enough to use it at <br>
the Georgia tournament yet, maybe for the 4x4 edges if I just feel <br>
that I am starting to get it really well, but I doubt it.<br>
<br>
Anyway after this tournament I want to make a bunch more journeys <br>
and really refine my images and take care of my fuzziness with <br>
visualizing people (or just pick more memorable people).<br>

Anyway, just trying to update with how I&#x27;m doing.  After trying PAO <br>

          <div class="email-content">Well done Chris. If you have more than 1 attempt for BLD events in Georgia, one solve you can do using PAO and the rest using your any comfortable method. It will be sort of experience to compare the systems in championship conditions and environment.
  >really refine my images and take care of my fuzziness with visualizing people
          Select the people whom you know very well. After some good practice, you will not see the person in full size. You will only be getting/visualising a particular mark or special feature of that person, say big ears, big lower lips, Doubled chin, No eye-brows, Scar in the face, pointed nose, Bow tie, Blonde hair, Chubby cheeks, Big fore head, Blue eyes etc. Hope this will give you some ideas to eliminate the fuzziness with visualising people. 
   
  Good Luck Chris

          <div class="email-content">Joel, here is what Bernett does for Stefan&#x27;s method. Name the 8 cornors in Alphabetical order A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H.
  Assign 3 words for each piece( a name for each face starting with same alphabet). Leave out the UBR piece. It gets solved automatically at the end. So you ned to have 7*3 = 21 images.
  A= apple, aero plane, ant
  B= ball, bag, bicycle
  And ofcourde apply Journey method.

  Hello John,

Yes, all my times include memorisation.

For the corners, I don&#x27;t first orientate them and cycle them 
afterwards. I use Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s system for the corners... For 
memorisation this means I need 24 &#x27;letters&#x27; or other &#x27;objects&#x27;, and 
memorise about 7 of them. I don&#x27;t think I want to use PAO for this 
too.. Do you have another idea?

can try phonetic sound and its value system for cornors. If you have 
very good vocabulary, then you can memorise 8 cornors in just 1 or 2 
or 3 words on the fly.My mother tongue is not English and I can not 
coin a word on the fly. So I had a prepared set for every 2 
digits.But, I think you can do it on the fly even for 4 or 5 sounds 
together. If you have not yet learned it, you can find it at

I watched the BLD video... That&#x27;s a fast memorisation! 

Too bad I couldn&#x27;t see anything at all. Maybe you should put on some 
more lights, and choose a different camera angle...

And no my cube is not well lubed anymore.  It locks up on me a lot
(I think it also adds a lot to my hand pain actually.  My old friend
from NU had a really nice cube and it didn&#x27;t hurt my wrists so
much).  The sides of my cube are loose, but like to jam often.

Sorry about the angles and such, but the angle in the above video
should be better.  Dang blindfold got stuck in my mouth, haha.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Marcus,

Yes, I like the second video much better..!

Man, if I could memorise that fast, I could also have sub2-times!! 
You memorised in less than 30 seconds :). It&#x27;s quite impressive.

I only feel the ache in my hands by looking at seeing your fingers 
work... :(. Really, if you feel anything hurting in your hands, 
anything at all, you should just quit for a few days. Doctors 
advice ;).

Can you tell me the exact method you use? I wasnt really able to 
follow everything... 

Well, tnx for the video.

- Joël.

          <div class="email-content">Rofl, I might just do that! It&#x27;s actually my roommate&#x27;s bandana 
thing... usually I just close my eyes, but for the sake of video, I 
wore a blindfold.

And yeah my hands hurt a lot when I cube, even for a little bit, but
I think it&#x27;s the cube&#x27;s fault.  I can play DDR a lot longer than I
can cube.  The layers jam so often and don&#x27;t allow for smooth
triggers most of the time so I have to strain and force them, etc.
I think I will need a different cubed that is well-lubed if I am to
get rid of the aching.  I appreciate your concern though, thank you! 
I&#x27;ll try to keep it light.

As for my method, I am about to make a few videos outlining an
example solve, so stay tuned.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Marcus,

Yeah actually I remember Dan Harris told me he went to a doctor 
once, and he/she said that if you feel anyting, a very tiny little 
small ache, you should just quit for a while.. (and usually, when I 
feel something, it was also quite healthy to do something else for a 
while :)) Also, it&#x27;s important to relax while cubing, and take 
enough breakes. 

About the cubes: Yes.. You must be really lucky to find nice good 
and loose cubes :)... I think my DIY&#x27;s are perfectly loose.. very 
good for speedcubing.. Maybe you should try Ryan patricio&#x27;s 
onehanded cube :). That thing can be scrambled by shaking it.

I am looking forward to hear more about your method.. :)..

Well, happy cubing!!

- Joël.

  My method is not very different from what most people do in terms of 
execution, but I like the memory methods, anyhow.  I made the 
videos, but I don&#x27;t wanna use rapidshare again.  Is there a better 
way to host all these videos?? I have a total of 5 (CO, CP, EO, EP, 
actual solving) and in total it&#x27;s about 136 MB, the largest being 
the solve video.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

By the way, PAO means Person/Action/Object or Permute and Orient ?

Hehehe .. i would guess the first. Noone would be so crazy as to 
swap the orientation and permutation step? Right?

And also, is it true that Leyan Lo memorises simply by visualising 
the colors? If so has he tried that for the larger cubes also. Or 
will it only work for 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 cubes ?

Cheers!

I downloaded the first file.. Now I have to wait 81 minutes to

Ralf Laue (you know him?) told me he used to permute first, orient 
afterwards.

Besides using a different host, you could try compressing the videos. 
For the resolution you&#x27;re using, 1.5 MB per Minute is enough even for 
fast videos, and based on your first two solving videos I&#x27;d estimate 
you&#x27;d get from 136 MB down to around 30 MB.

Cheers!

My QuickTime is the Pro Version (unlocked) so i can uncompress to

          <div class="email-content">Hey Joel, Stefan,

Thanks for the kind words.  I&#x27;m very excited about having a shot at
solving the bigger cubes in a competition environment and see how I
stack up compared to the pros who have already done it officially (I&#x27;m
still a noob).  I just hope it goes well ;-)

Haha Stefan, well I mean there is the chance I will DNF both solves of
course, but I will try to get a good solve for the 5x5 since it&#x27;s the
harder cube to forget if I DNF the first one and have to take a second
solve.

I think the times for both bigger cubes will change a lot anyway once
more people learn the PAO method, or PO, or other variants of the
journey methods or major methods.  I will still be using my old stuff
for Chattahoochee since I&#x27;m not used to the new methods yet :-(

Still I&#x27;m excited, and thanks everyone!  I hope to come back with more
than 4 DNF&#x27;s lol

Chris

Rapidshare will have to do for now until I find better hosting.
Yousenditwas taking way too long in terms of uploading.

  You can&#x27;t have three facing left since there are only two corners 
per side of a face.  The chart is meant to be interpreted by seeing

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Just wanted to post my thoughts on doing the big cubes BLD in a <br>
tournament.<br>
<br>
First off my hat is off to Dror Vomberg and Stefan Pochmann for <br>
doing the 5x5x5 blindfolded in a tournament mostly having figured <br>
things out on their own.  I had help from both you guys and I still <br>
found it hard to do in front of people, and with the pressure.<br>
<br>
As far as the actual solving goes I have completely scrapped my <br>
memorization method and am devoting myself fully to PAO and the <br>
journey method.  Coming up with the stories the way I do, stringing <br>
everything together and supplying the links between nouns as a cause <br>
and effect style grouping does not allow me to memorize well <br>
(meaning quickly) when under a lot of pressure.<br>
<br>
Also interference was a big problem for me since I used the same <br>
nouns and places and verbs for every cube, and if a situation on one <br>
cube is similar to an early one it sucks to try to remember how the <br>
situation on the current cube is, and block out the one from the <br>
previous cube.<br>
<br>
I very much like the idea of just being able to use a number of <br>
different prepared journeys to avoid interference and allow you to <br>
memorize multiple cubes and not worry about running into similar <br>
situations as much.  It seems that the different journey itself <br>
would help to combat this very well.<br>
<br>
I had a great time and the tournament was very fun!  I learned that <br>
I still have a lot to learn, but I had a blast making this attempt <br>
in public and getting a successful solve under pressure.<br>
<br>
Now I just need to scrap my old method and really learn how to use <br>
the PAO method :-( .  I really think it will be a much better <br>
memorization method for tournament solving than my current method is.<br>
<br>
Also, memorizing the edges by rote for each cube is a bad idea for <br>
me, because I had a hard time trying to overwrite the stuff I <br>
remembered from my previous solve(s).  In the future I plan on using <br>
PAO for the edges of the bigger cubes too to help avoid that problem.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll probably end up refining this approach after trying it in April <br>
if something doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hope, but my plan for the <br>
April tournament in Tennesse is to use PAO for the centers and edges <br>
on my 4x4 attempts instead of the stories as I use them now and the <br>
edges just by rote.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts on tournament big cubes BLD, in case anyone is <br>
interested.<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S.  that comment about wanting to come back with &quot;more than 4 <br>
DNF&#x27;s&quot; I meant that I wanted any situation better than coming home <br>
with 4 DNF&#x27;s, not that I wanted multiple DNF&#x27;s (more than 4 of them).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

congrats for your 5x5 blindsolve, it&#x27;s a great achievement, 
particularly in competition conditions. I think I know what you mean 
about having a blast, I still remember very well how extremely excited 
I felt after my solve back then :-)

Can you tell how much off you were for your other attempts, how much 
time you spent on each, and how much time you spent for memorization 
and execution of your successful one?

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys !<br>
<br>
Im not into blindfold cubing myself. But nevertheless i have a <br>
challenge ;-)  <br>
<br>
========<br>
<br>
The challenge is like this:<br>
<br>
1) Scramble and memorise a 3x3x3 cube<br>
2) Go to sleep (at least 4 hrs, a normal overnite sleep)<br>
3) When u are ready next day solve the cube with blindfold (do not <br>
inspect the cube again !! Apart from making sure orientation is <br>
correct.)<br>
4) Take off blindfold and see if cube is solved ;-)<br>
<br>
========<br>
<br>
This will challenge the memorisation using long term memory. <br>
Normally memorisation/solving is done using short term memory only. <br>
How many of out guys can recall the scramble say 10 mins after a bld-<br>
solve? Not so many i guess.<br>
<br>
There is no reward for doing this. Apart from a good good feeling of <br>
being able to say : I DID IT!! :D<br>
<br>
Best of luck anyone :D<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; congrats for your 5x5 blindsolve, it&#x27;s a great achievement, <br>
&gt; particularly in competition conditions. I think I know what you <br>

&gt; about having a blast, I still remember very well how extremely <br>

&gt; I felt after my solve back then :-)<br>
<br>
Hey Stefan,<br>
<br>
Thanks, but seriously you are one of my biggest inspirations to try <br>
to do this.  When I read about your 5x5x5 BLD solve at the European <br>
championship (first successful solve in competition!) I couldn&#x27;t get <br>
over how amazing that was!  Plus your UWR for megaminx and your <br>
multiple 3x3 cubes world record are awesome as well!<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Can you tell how much off you were for your other attempts, how <br>
much <br>
&gt; time you spent on each, and how much time you spent for <br>
memorization <br>
&gt; and execution of your successful one?<br>
<br>
Certainly,  my first 5x5x5 BLD solve would have been 45 minutes if <br>
it were successful but it was off by a lot.  Each face had anywhere <br>
from 30%-50% of the right stickers on it, but all in all it was a <br>
very unsuccessful DNF.  The corners were unsolved, which makes me <br>
think I messed up while solving corners, leaving most everything <br>
else to get messed up quite a lot.<br>
<br>
The second 5x5 was 40-41 minutes to memorize (I could make out the <br>
minutes on the stopwatch but not the seconds) and I guess about 14-<br>
15 minutes to solve.  I was so incredibly freaked out about this <br>
being my last possible attempt for the 5x5 until the US championship <br>
that I went over every cycle for everything (corners, edges, <br>
centers) a couple times just to make sure I would remember them all.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know the breakdowns of my 4x4 solves, but the first one I <br>
put the cube down at 12:24 but had flipped 3 corners the wrong way <br>
leaving them twisted at the end, and I forgot to swap two blocks <br>
that I had created during my centers.  So 4 centers off, and 3 <br>
corners twisted.<br>
<br>
The second 4x4 solve was a miserable failure, after solving the <br>
corners (Leyan was my judge and said at one point I had them <br>
correctly) I made two very big mistakes in my edges and realized <br>
near the end of the edges cycles that there was no chance for a <br>
success, so I stopped and that was at 15 minutes something.  The <br>
cube (even corners) was completely scrambled when I stopped.<br>
<br>
My biggest problem overall was interference from previous solves <br>
after the first cube.  The second 4x4 solve was the worst since I <br>
had parts of all 3 other cube scrambles in my had, and I use the <br>
same nouns and verbs and such every time, so I was getting mixed <br>
up.  I&#x27;m trying to plan out multiple journeys and some good triplets <br>
for the letters to try to get around this and see how it goes.<br>
<br>
Stefan how do you feel about interference for your memorization <br>
method?  I mean would you feel comfortable doing 2 cubes in a row  <br>
in competition using it?  I certainly don&#x27;t anymore with my <br>
technique, not after having a chance to try it and see how hard it <br>
is.  That is why I&#x27;m so motivated to change it now.  I&#x27;m still very <br>
curious what your thoughts are for memorizing the bigger cubes in <br>
competition.<br>
 <br>
&gt; Cheers!<br>

Happy cubing!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I think being able to use earmuffs/earplugs or both in a competition <br>
would be a really good idea from a competitor&#x27;s standpoint.  I think <br>
it would be nice to be able to just be in your own little world so to <br>
speak without being able to hear the audience or people around you <br>
during a solve.<br>
<br>
Is this something that we can start to allow in competition?  I assume <br>
this would help for any aspect of BLD cubing.  The reason I ask, the <br>
memory championships allow the use of earmuffs to block out sound.  <br>
BLD cubing is a memory sport, so why not follow the guidelines and <br>
rules as they pertain to other memory sports in the aspect of sound <br>
distractions?<br>
<br>
Just wanted to ask, I would really love the ability to bring earmuffs <br>
to use in competition in the future.<br>

Hi Per,

I can truly and easily say: &quot;No Problem&quot;

Memorization and retention has never been a limiting
factor on any of my attempts.  When I was first
learning to blindsolve the 5x5x5 supercube I was very
busy at my job and did not have a lot of time to
devote to memorizing and solving.  So what I would do
was to &#x27;treat&#x27; myself to memorizing one of the cycles
each night during the week and then do a solve attempt
on the weekend when I had a nice window of
uninterrupted time.  For example I might memorize the
edge cycle on a Tuesday night, one of the center
cycles on the Wednesday night, the other center cycle
on a Thursday night, and the rest of the cube on the
Friday night.  On Saturday afternoon I would then
first recall all of the information before looking at
the cube, then recall it a second time while
double-checking it against the scrambelled cube, and
when I was confident that I had it I would attempt the
solve.  I did have several DNFs but they were ALL due
to mistakes in undoing my set-up moves.  Never was the
fact that some of my memorization was 3-4 days old
ever a problem in the actual solve.   Of course as I
got better I could then do it all in one sitting but
this is how I got started.  Thus I can confidently say
that I can easily and effortlessly retain all of the
memorized information while it is still relevant. 
That last bit is significant because 2 days after the
solve I can only certainly recall patches of the solve
not every single detail.  But the main point is that
the info stays clear and strong until I use it.  I am
also sure that if I had 2 identical scrambles I could
solve them on consecutive weekends because the info
would still be relevant to me for the week in between
the solves.  Only when I feel that I am finished with
the info does it start to fade on me.  For the
consecutive weekend attempt it would remain relevant
and therefore remain clear.

It is an interesting question and I would also like to
know if other big cube blindfolders have similar
experiences to me in this.

I would also like to thank John Louis because I too am
in the process of re-thinking my memorization process
and shifting to the PAO method.  It is time consuming
and there is definately a bit of a learning curve but
I am also quickly becoming more and more comfortable
with the system and I have no doubts that it will lead
to significant payoffs in the near future.

<br>
thanks for the details of your several attempts! The twisting time for <br>
your successful 5x5 solve seems to be quite well, mostly the <br>
memorization taking much longer than in practice, right?<br>
<br>
About interference: I&#x27;ve never done several large cubes in a row <br>
(mainly because I&#x27;m so fucking slow that I&#x27;m exhausted after just one <br>
cube :-). But I&#x27;ve been alright using the same mental images for let&#x27;s <br>
say 5x5 edges, +centers and Xcenters all along a longer journey <br>
without problems. Similar for the multiple 3x3 solve. Then again, keep <br>
in mind I&#x27;m fucking slow and that&#x27;s partly because I take my time for <br>
memorizing safely. No idea about interference problems when you go <br>
fast. But I think it definitely helps attaching things to different <br>
locations in journeys.<br>
<br>
Ask me again in a few months, until then I want to have more practice <br>
with this, as I need to get the 5x5 record back.<br>

(I&#x27;m going to answer all the posts in one, just to save space)

You Rock Chris!!! Thats all I can say.  Any chance in teaching me 4x4
and 5x5, to some degree???  I have made some great achievements in BLD
cubing since I started a week ago, and feel that I could do well with
the Big Cubes as well.  Truly, I think the idea for earmuffs/plugs in
competition is a great idea, to go along with your hat idea.  It gives
you that feeling that you are at home, to some degree.

As for my BLD achievements:(I started learning Stefan&#x27;s method last
Sunday, around 2 PM my time)
My First successful solve was around 11-11:30 on Tuesday, with a time
of 6:29.  Since then my times rapidly dropped to an average of about
3:30 but now they are going back up a bit because I am not doing it
every spare moment.  My PB is 2:19, and I&#x27;ve had a few other sub-3s.
I started doing 2x2 BLD on Thursday or so...A lot of people find my
method for Memo on 2x2 very weird.  the most you need to memorise is 6
pieces, and I visually remember where the pieces are going to go, and
say one colour in my head.  I&#x27;ve done a solve that literally takes 4
seconds to memorise: Yellow White White Green Red.
The other day, not sure when, I did 5 2x2s BLD, I knew I could beat 4,
so I tried it and was successful.  Ever since I got into BLD I&#x27;ve
loved it and it is very interesting.  My next step is to take on the
bigger cubes, and make my regular times better.  I&#x27;ll stop rambling...

If any of you who don&#x27;t know me already want to talk to me, and I&#x27;m
always open to talking to other cubers, especially BLD cubers, then
add me to MSN at logitewty [at] hotmail [dot] com or Yahoo Messenger
at chbouchard777

Thanks for reading my nonsense,

they should be allowed, it allows all the crying babies to be ignored.  

A true story from WC:

I was on stage at a timer doing my 5x5 solve, and I was a few minutes
in.  I was slow at the time averaging >8 minutes...And behind me there
were people talking.  At first I didn&#x27;t pay attention but slowly I
started listening to what they said and had to fight myself not to
turn around and join in on the conversation.  If I had ear plugs I
never woulda heard them and everything woulda been all good...hehe...

If it aint forbidden it&#x27;s allowed. Well, that is as long as u can

it&#x27;s not allowed either ;-)

The reason against headphones though was possible sound distraction to 
others around you. I assure you my earplugs are silent, they might 
only make a sound when I burn them, which I won&#x27;t while wearing them.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Actually, I think the reason behing banning the headphones was because
god only knows what you have on there.  I could be algorithms
repeating over and over.  Or someone could have watched the previous
scrambles and recorded the solution on there.  Like really, earplugs
are a good idea.

Thanks for reading my nonsense,

          <div class="email-content">I was only half-serious.  I&#x27;m not sure what the other
half was :)  The volume level from the headphones is
highly subjective anyway, but I still maintain I could
listen to my music without distracting others. 
Portable CD players, MP3 players, etc. have been
allowed at every major chess tournament I&#x27;ve
participated in.  I would consider both chess and
cubing to be in the &quot;mind sport&quot; category.

On a different idea, if earplugs are allowed to
enhance performance; are lighting sources allowed? 
For example, bringing a lamp up to the timer to help
my lighting situation.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with
lighting at a tournament though...

No, that is now explicitly forbidden, thanks to me asking about it a 
few months ago :-)

2i)	While competing competitors may not use sound or other 
electronic equipment (like walkmans, dictaphones or additional 
lighting).

          <div class="email-content">Hey Craig,<br>
<br>
Absolutely I can show you some stuff for the bigger cubes <br>
blindfolded.  I use freestyle commutators for literally everything <br>
except some CO cases that I have memorized as algs, so basically I <br>
can just show you the main ones I use for cycling edges and corners <br>
and the way I setup some of the borderline cases that could go <br>
either way.<br>
<br>
Also, if you like using Stefan&#x27;s method and are comfortable with it <br>
you know you can use it for the bigger cubes too for the cycling, so <br>
it really is up to you.  Using Stefan&#x27;s method will be more moves <br>
but hardly any delays between algs, freestyle cycling will be fewer <br>
moves but lots of delays between algs.<br>
<br>
Also your 3x3 and 2x2 times are really good!  How long is it taking <br>
you to memorize on average?<br>
<br>
For the bigger cubes I highly recommend learning the journey method, <br>
or the Roman Room, or Major method, or something more sophisticated <br>
than the rote memory techniques for the 3x3.  I talked with Leyan <br>
and Tyson at Chattahoochee and I&#x27;m starting to be convinced that <br>
memorizing the 3x3 directly instead of with the Journey method can <br>
be really fast (1:28 in competition, plus Tyson&#x27;s 1:27 DNF that was <br>
only off by the H perm).<br>
<br>
Anyway yeah so I recommend a different memorization method, but you <br>
don&#x27;t have to learn one if you don&#x27;t want.<br>
<br>
Cool man, awesome times and your progress on the 3x3 and 2x2 so far <br>
is ridiculous!  Keep it up!<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
&gt; You Rock Chris!!! Thats all I can say.  Any chance in teaching me <br>
4x4<br>
&gt; and 5x5, to some degree???  I have made some great achievements in <br>
BLD<br>
&gt; cubing since I started a week ago, and feel that I could do well <br>
with<br>
&gt; the Big Cubes as well.  Truly, I think the idea for earmuffs/plugs <br>
in<br>
&gt; competition is a great idea, to go along with your hat idea.  It <br>
gives<br>
&gt; you that feeling that you are at home, to some degree.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; As for my BLD achievements:(I started learning Stefan&#x27;s method last<br>
&gt; Sunday, around 2 PM my time)<br>
&gt; My First successful solve was around 11-11:30 on Tuesday, with a <br>
time<br>
&gt; of 6:29.  Since then my times rapidly dropped to an average of <br>
about<br>
&gt; 3:30 but now they are going back up a bit because I am not doing it<br>
&gt; every spare moment.  My PB is 2:19, and I&#x27;ve had a few other sub-<br>
3s.<br>
&gt; I started doing 2x2 BLD on Thursday or so...A lot of people find my<br>
&gt; method for Memo on 2x2 very weird.  the most you need to memorise <br>
is 6<br>
&gt; pieces, and I visually remember where the pieces are going to go, <br>
and<br>
&gt; say one colour in my head.  I&#x27;ve done a solve that literally takes <br>
4<br>
&gt; seconds to memorise: Yellow White White Green Red.<br>
&gt; The other day, not sure when, I did 5 2x2s BLD, I knew I could <br>
beat 4,<br>
&gt; so I tried it and was successful.  Ever since I got into BLD I&#x27;ve<br>
&gt; loved it and it is very interesting.  My next step is to take on <br>
the<br>
&gt; bigger cubes, and make my regular times better.  I&#x27;ll stop <br>
rambling...<br>

Personally I find watches, left shoes, and blue eyes

to remove the item(s) before competing with me.

Nah, I wanted to use it myself, particularly for Megaminx.

I only know the result, not the reason, but I guess it has to do with 
the reverse of noitcartsid.

I&#x27;m actually not too too sure...for 2x2 my average is almost always
sub-10.  For 3x3 I have gotten a 1:10 on a really easy solve, I
usually don&#x27;t check the timer...

You might need to show me some of these methods, I think I know them,
but I don&#x27;t know.  I like my story/other.  My memorisation can only
get better, and the corners is where.

          <div class="email-content">Honestly, if I was allowed to wear headphones during a competition I <br>
would very strongly consider recording a metronome at 180 on tape <br>
and listening to that in a walkman for my 3x3 solves.  I&#x27;d have <br>
another tape at 120 for my 4x4 solves to pace me on edges, etc..<br>

Maybe this is the reason/a reason we&#x27;re not allowed headphones?<br>
<br>
Then again if you&#x27;re even a beginner musician it&#x27;s real easy to tap <br>
your toes inside your shoes at 180 or 120 during a solve, so maybe <br>
that wouldn&#x27;t even help that much?  It would just make the ability <br>

          <div class="email-content">I too would love to learn more about these freestyle commutators you 
speak of -- is it similar in nature to &quot;intuitive&quot; solving on the 
centers when cubing it for speed while looking (just the impression 
I get from the word &quot;freestyle&quot;)?

I think I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that methods like PAO are best 
used on the 4x4 and bigger -- it isn&#x27;t needed for the 3x3, which I 
think is the limit of &quot;comfortable-direct-memorization&quot;, since it 
becomes a lot harder when you move up in size.

Then again if you&#x27;re even a beginner musician it&#x27;s real easy to tap 
your toes inside your shoes at 180 or 120 during a solve, so maybe 
that wouldn&#x27;t even help that much?  It would just make the ability

rather than actively create the beat with your foot.

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

Thanks for your feedback.

I will look into this subject for the next version of the WCA regulations.
I think the main issues with allowing electronic equipment are:
1) could disturb other people

2) could be used for unallowed help
(not really for speedcubing of course, but for blindfolded cubing it could help in some way)

3) it is hard to decide/distinguish which equipment would be OK and which not. Therefore we thought it was better to not allow equipment at all.
(examples of clear cases and cases on the edge of fairness: music might be OK but what about algorithms, personal light under bad light conditions, a dictaphone for blindfolded solving, a flashing light to annoy other competitors, a metronome for keeping a specific pace, a laptop for algorithms like the 4x4x4 parity algorithms).

4) I can&#x27;t remember seeing someone wearing such equipment in other sports
(but I may be wrong)

Anyway, I will get back to this subject, but feel free to already send me feedback or use the WCA forum for feedback.
It would be possible to allow more than is allowed now. As long as it is a 100 percent clear and fair rule.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">1) You could just set a general volume rule, cap it in a fashion 
similar to stereo and radio laws for automobiles in the US (ie. 
shouldn&#x27;t be able to hear outside a 15 ft radius or something, etc)

2) Perhaps have someone review all music for blindfold solvers 
before allowing them to use it?

3) I think as long as the common-sense rule holds it should be ok, 
and by this I mean, if it doesn&#x27;t annoy others or unfairly aid the 
solver, go for it (ie. obviously don&#x27;t allow flashing lights).

          <div class="email-content">Hi Marcus,

We&#x27;ve gone over regulations like these before.  The main issue is the 
practicality.  Competition organizers are already doing a lot.

1)  Sure, we could set a decibel rule too, but then that would be 
really hard to measure.  We&#x27;d need a machine, there&#x27;d be background 
noise, and everything else.  As for the &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be able to hear 
outside a 15 ft radius,&quot; people have different levels of hearing.  Who 
is to decide what is audible or not?  A musician with sensitive ears 
might be able to hear things that a teenager who listens to rock music 
with loud headphones all the time might not be able to hear.

2)  Again, this is a huge hassle and really isn&#x27;t practical.  I 
shouldn&#x27;t have to go through everyone&#x27;s music to see whether or not 
they&#x27;re cheating.

3)  Common-sense is good, but unfortunately, people don&#x27;t follow common 
sense all the time, and when there&#x27;s a disagreement, we have to refer 
to hard text.

In general, and this is a really old argument, when you go to a 
competition, you&#x27;re expected to deal with the atmosphere of the 
competition.  That&#x27;s why when you succeed in competition, it&#x27;s 
different from when you succeed in the comfort of your own home.  You 
don&#x27;t get your special chair, your special lights, your music, your ear 
muffs, your girlfriend, or fuzzy teddy bear.  You get whatever gets 
thrown at you in the competition.  Everyone is already dealing with the 
same stuff.

In other words, let&#x27;s not please have a repeat of the headphones music 
argument.

Unlike headphones, ear plugs do not &quot;add&quot; anything to the atmosphere.  
We&#x27;ll look into it, and I&#x27;ll concede that organizers are unable to 
control the level of background noise in all given competition 
environments (i.e. a museum).

Personally, I&#x27;ve been affected by this stuff myself, so I feel your 
pain, but it&#x27;s something you have to learn to deal with.  World 
Championships &#x27;05... the audience started clapping during my last BLD 
solve and I definitely lost my train of thought and paused for a few 
seconds.  Maybe that 1:54.33 could have been faster?

But if I had gone before Leyan, it would have been the other way 
around, and maybe he would have been distracted with the clapping.  
These are just situations we can&#x27;t control.

          <div class="email-content">I understand your point especially considering the ambiguities that 
may arise and actually be difficult to define in hard text -- 
usually when something is hard to define it can be fixed by having a 
rule of lowest/weakest link, meaning, for instance, *nobody* should 
be able to hear the music outside of say 15 feet, but of course, 
this would still be a hassle.  Just depends on how flexible you want 
the hard text to accomodate &quot;common sense&quot; frameworks.

BTW how can music help blindfold solvers do something unfairly? It&#x27;s 
not like you can listen to solutions, I mean at most it could 
provide aural algorithms, but that would still be impractical on 
both ends.

Finally, I&#x27;d love to know how a teddy bear can help! :D The teddy 
must must be the key to everything...

Marcus:  My MP3 player allows me to record my voice, and play it back.
 I could record my voice, pretending to just say my story to myself
and then memorise in like, 15 seconds.  Then play it back and be
solved sub-1.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tyson,

In what way can you cheat by using music? Making a CD with yourself 
repeating algorithms? Listening to &quot;R U B2...&quot; won&#x27;t help me much...

You don&#x27;t have to go through 10 hours of music for every 
competitor.. I most cases it will be clear right away that it&#x27;s just 
harmless music.

About the volume: I don&#x27;t think anyone will ever be able to hear my 
headphones. I don&#x27;t want to damage my ears!

- Joël.

          <div class="email-content">Hmm I suppose... perhaps there are more cons than pros, but it just
seems like it&#x27;d be nice to allow music, but too hard to account for
all cases.  I know this has all probably be said before since it&#x27;s
apparently an old argument.

I still say we should allow the aid of girlfriends and/or teddy
bears &lt;_&lt;  >_>

Joel: This is what I was trying to say -- recording algorithms 
wouldn&#x27;t be all that practical.  I don&#x27;t know what else you could 
possibly record.  Thing is, even though you may not play it loudly, 
some people&#x27;s headphones DO blast music pretty loudly for others to 
hear.

Yeah... In a lot of cases, it&#x27;s hard define things in hard text... 
It doesn&#x27;t prevent gouvernments from making laws... It&#x27;s the task of 
the gourvernment to serve the people. The gourvernment is my slave 
in that way. Just like that, I think WCA should do everything 
possible to create nice competition environments for competitors..

Of course, I won&#x27;t bring my own chair and teddy bear etc. etc., but 
wearing headphones that nobody can hear should not be a problem.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I too would love to learn more about these freestyle commutators you <br>
&gt; speak of -- is it similar in nature to &quot;intuitive&quot; solving on the <br>
&gt; centers when cubing it for speed while looking (just the impression <br>
&gt; I get from the word &quot;freestyle&quot;)?<br>
<br>
Hey Marcus and everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been meaning to write a tutorial about what I use for freestyle <br>
commutators but I&#x27;ve been too lazy/busy lately to really get to it.<br>
<br>
Here is a short explanation of what I do.<br>
<br>
Obviously a commutator is made up of two permutations A and B strung <br>
together as ABA&#x27;B&#x27;<br>
<br>
Now let me define a &quot;freestlye commutator&quot; as a commutator where <br>
either A or B (but not both) is a single slice turn.<br>
<br>
So let S stand for slice turn.  A freestlye commutator looks like <br>
ASA&#x27;S&#x27; or SAS&#x27;A&#x27;<br>
<br>
Ok, so that is how the exact form a freestyle commutator will take.  <br>
Now here is how to setup the pieces.<br>
<br>
A freestlye commutator always cycles two pieces in the same slice and <br>
one piece off that slice.  I say slice because two pieces in the r <br>
slice is just as good as two pieces in the R slice, no difference.  If <br>
you&#x27;re on the 5x5x5 the m,e,s slices are just as good as any other <br>
slice as well, so feel free to use them also.<br>
<br>
Now there is one further definition.  When two pieces are in the same <br>
outer slice they also need to have the same &quot;direction&quot;.  &quot;Direction&quot; <br>
is an arbitrary distinction that I gave to the edges of a 4x4 and <br>
5x5.  An edge piece on the 4x4 or 5x5 either has the attribute <br>
of &quot;leftness&quot; or &quot;rightness&quot;<br>
<br>
The left edges are {lUB, fUL, rUF, bUR, uBR, dBL, rDB, fDR, lDF, bDL, <br>
uFL, dFR}<br>
and the right edges are the other 12 edges.<br>
<br>
Ok so if you have two edges in the same outer layer either have to <br>
both be &quot;left&quot; edges or both be &quot;right&quot; edges.<br>
<br>
All it means for both edges to be either &quot;right&quot; or &quot;left&quot; is that by <br>
turning that outer layer one edge can occupy the position of the other.<br>
<br>
Ok, so here are the rules.<br>
<br>
1) Always use &quot;freestyle commutators&quot; where A or B (*not* both) is a <br>
slice turn<br>
2) always setup the edges in your 3 cycle such that two pieces are in <br>
the same slice, and one piece is off that slice<br>
 2a) If two pieces are setup in the same outer layer slice they *must* <br>
both be &quot;right&quot; edges or both be &quot;left&quot; edges<br>
<br>
Ok so here is an example.<br>
<br>
(lUB -&gt; fUL -&gt; dFR)<br>
<br>
Ok so first we need to see how the edges are setup.  Do we have 2 <br>
edges in the same slice?  Yes we do, lUB and fUL are both in the U <br>
slice.  Now, those two pieces are in an outer slice so are they both <br>
left edges or both right edges?  Yes, they&#x27;re both left edges.  Now is <br>
the other edge off that slice?  yes it is it&#x27;s in the d slice, the R <br>
slice, and F slice, so it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t touch the U slice.<br>
<br>
Ok so this is an easy setup, we don&#x27;t even need to do a setup move.<br>
<br>
To solve it we have to do this.  Our freestyle commutator is made up <br>
of a permutation A and a slice turn S.<br>
<br>
The permutation moves the lone edge (the one not in the slice with the <br>
other two) into the location where it needs to go.<br>
<br>
So in our cycle (lUB -&gt; fUL -&gt; dFR) the lone edge is dFR and it needs <br>
to go to lUB.<br>
<br>
So what we need to do is to move dFR to lUB without distrubing <br>
anything else in the U slice.<br>
<br>
I would do this by doing B d2 B&#x27; which places dFR into the U slice at <br>
lUB and doesn&#x27;t affect anything else in the U slice.<br>
<br>
Now turn the U slice such that the other one of the two edges ends up <br>
at lUB.  Do this by turning U which moves fUL to lUB.  Now just <br>
complete the commutator.  Don&#x27;t pay any attention to what edges move <br>
where, you did the setup correctly, so now just invert the first two <br>
permutations to make it a commutator.<br>
<br>
So we started with B d2 B&#x27; as our A and U as our S.<br>
<br>
So using ASA&#x27;S&#x27; we should end with B d2 B&#x27; then U&#x27;<br>
<br>
So the whole move is B d2 B&#x27; U B d2 B&#x27; U&#x27;.  Notice how I selected the <br>
A such that it&#x27;s inverse is the same as A itself, or that A=A&#x27;?  <br>
That&#x27;s a very useful trick to help avoid DNF&#x27;s.  Now all I have to <br>
remember is which way to turn the U layer each time.  So when I do the <br>
U turn I imagine the U slice off from solved by a U turn, then when I <br>
do the U&#x27; I imagine the cube solves.  This helps me make sure I do <br>
those turns correctly.<br>
<br>
(Advanced tip: if I ran into this cycle on a real BLD solve I would do <br>
U&#x27; L d&#x27; L&#x27; U L d L&#x27; instead of the move I gave in this example.  Both <br>
are commutators the perform this cycle, but see if you can see why I <br>
would use U&#x27; L d&#x27; L&#x27; U L d L&#x27; instead of B d2 B&#x27; U B d2 B&#x27; U&#x27;).<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
Ok so now let&#x27;s do a harder example.<br>
(lUB -&gt; rUF -&gt; lDF)<br>
<br>
So first thing we look at is do we have two pieces in the same slice <br>
and one piece off that slice?  Yes we do.  We can group either lUB+rUF <br>
together in the U slice or rUF+lDF in the F slice.  Let&#x27;s group <br>
lUB+rUF together in the U slice.  So now we need to place the lone <br>
edge into the spot where it needs to go.<br>
<br>
So lDF is the lone edge and it needs to go to lUB.  Now how do we do <br>
this without messing up anyting on the U slice?<br>
<br>
This is actually a hard cycle, and requires some setup moves.<br>
<br>
Here I would do D&#x27; L&#x27; as a setup move which places lDF into the spot <br>
dFL.  Now we have the cycle (lUB-&gt;rUF-&gt;dFL) and now we need to move <br>
dFL to lUB without messing up the U slice.  I would do this with B d&#x27; <br>
B&#x27; as the algorithm.  Now we need to move the 2nd of the two pieces in <br>
the same layer to the spot where you just moved an edge to, or move <br>
rUF to lUB with the turn U2.<br>
<br>
So A = B d&#x27; B&#x27; and S=U2<br>
<br>
So after doing A then S don&#x27;t even think about where the edges are and <br>
what you&#x27;re doing, just complete the commutator.  So then complete it <br>
with A&#x27; then S&#x27; or B d B&#x27; U2.  Then undo the setup turns you did with <br>
L D at the end.<br>
<br>
So the whole move is D&#x27; L&#x27; B d&#x27; B&#x27; U2 B d B&#x27; U2 L D<br>
<br>
The power of this technique is after doing either A then S or S then A <br>
you can turn your brain off and mindlessly undo the algs you just did <br>
in commutator order.  So although you do 8 move algs as the <br>
commutators, the thought process stops after move 4.<br>
<br>
For the centers I do the same thing as edges.  Place two centers on <br>
one face and the lone center on a different face.  Only now you don&#x27;t <br>
need to worry about any &quot;leftness&quot; or &quot;rightness&quot;.<br>
<br>
Here are some more examples of commutators that I use.<br>
(lUB -&gt; uBL -&gt; uFR)<br>
slice = u<br>
lone edge = lUB<br>
S = u2<br>
A = R U R&#x27;<br>
do as SAS&#x27;A&#x27;<br>
<br>
And now for one not in the U layer, since I do these anywhere, but <br>
it&#x27;s easy to see and explain with them in the U layer if you&#x27;re just <br>
starting.<br>
<br>
(rUB -&gt; uFR -&gt; fDR)<br>
slice = R<br>
lone edge = rUB<br>
A = F r2 F&#x27;<br>
S = R<br>
do as ASA&#x27;S&#x27;<br>
<br>
And that&#x27;s a good start to what I do.  There are other tricks to make <br>
the commutators easy to perform, and some tricks to remembering them <br>
when trying to go really fast, but that is a start to what exactly I <br>
think when I do them.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,<br>

<br>
So these are in fact forbidden in competition for a BLD solve?  This <br>
is why I wanted to ask, since it seems people have already used <br>
earplugs.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t care how I look when wearing them, if I am allowed to use them <br>
then I plan on using heavy duty earmuffs *and* earplugs when solving a <br>
5x5 blindfolded, or even a 4x4.<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s just say I plan on getting serious for the bigger cubes, and I <br>
want to be just as hardcore as the Memory Champions with earmuffs and <br>
everything while memorizing.<br>

 Like obviously there will be people trying to cheat, but honestly who

Yeah maybe you don&#x27;t *want* to damage your ears but hit the wrong 
button and BOOM, not only the sound of your headphones will disturb 
everybody but also the sound of a screaming Joel :-)

It&#x27;s kinda late here.. So I don&#x27;t feel like reading the whole thing 
now..

But it looks a lot like what I am thinking about when I do three 
cycles on the 3x3 BLD. :)

          <div class="email-content">Ok, I have the answer.  Earmuffs/plugs are allowed because:

There is no rule preventing people from rearing a baseball cap in
comepetition, when I know of a few people that wear one to prevent
themselves from seeing the audience.  Why can&#x27;t people wear ear plugs
to prevent them from hearing the audience??? And why not take it one
step further, and give them a nose plug so they don&#x27;t have to SMELL
the audience (hehehehe)...

          <div class="email-content">I posted on the Yahoo Group (speedsolving) a few days ago about this.<br>
<br>
I am looking into starting the Weekly (Sunday) Blindfold Contest<br>
again.  Chris Hardwick used to run this, and I am looking to take it<br>
off his hands, and reopen it.<br>
<br>
I have 2 options, and I am just wondering which you would prefer.  I<br>
am going to use an automated system to create the results tables. <br>
This is for the 3x3 &quot;competition.&quot;<br>
<br>
Option 1:<br>
Like in an Official Competition.<br>
<br>
Do 3 solves (or just one and say the others are DNS)and your Best of<br>
the 3 is what determines your rank, and therefore the winner, for the<br>
week.<br>
<br>
Option 2:<br>
Each scramble is its own &quot;competition.&quot;  Whoever comes in first place<br>
in Scramble 1 will be awarded n points, second place, x points, third<br>
place y points, and so on...<br>
Scramble 2 will be awarded points the same way.<br>
Scramble 3 the same as well.<br>
<br>
The Winner for the week would be the one with the highest total number<br>
of points.<br>
<br>
I am just asking because I want to know which of the two people would<br>
prefer.<br>
<br>
Also, I am thinking of having an Open Division where you can do any<br>
puzzle that you want (cube size or other puzzle) and input the time. <br>
You would only do 1 scramble per week for the Open Division per<br>
puzzle.  Does this sound reasonable for everyone???  And which of the<br>
2 options would you like more??? I was leaning towards Option 2, but<br>
I&#x27;ve heard from others to go for Option 1, and so I am asking you, the<br>
Blindfold community, which you would prefer.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi JoÂ¤l,

You are still young, and still have ideals. I like that. :-)

I especially like this one:
&quot;
Yeah... In a lot of cases, it&#x27;s hard define things in hard text...
It doesn&#x27;t prevent gouvernments from making laws... It&#x27;s the task of
the gourvernment to serve the people. The gourvernment is my slave
in that way. Just like that, I think WCA should do everything
possible to create nice competition environments for competitors..
&quot;

I see two differences:
1) your government is not only your &quot;slave&quot;, but also everyone else&#x27;s slave. 
There is no way to serve everyone.
2) you pay your government. And you and all the other masters should help 
them decide where they spend their money on.

Actually WCA is also my slave. And I think they should not allow all that 
annoying equipment. In competitions people should just solve cubes and have 
fun, without equipment during the solving.
And if you can find someone who is prepared to pay for hiring someone to 
check all equipment for anything other than music, then please let me know 
where I can send the bill to.

Have fun,

Ron

Yeah... In a lot of cases, it&#x27;s hard define things in hard text...

Of course, I won&#x27;t bring my own chair and teddy bear etc. etc., but
wearing headphones that nobody can hear should not be a problem.

Haha... Yes Ron... I had to think back to when I was reading laws. 
One of the funny things about laws is that it&#x27;s very hard to make 
them, and they are often unpractical. But it doesn&#x27;t mean that the 
gourvernment should not make a law, even if it&#x27;s hard to describe 
certain situations in &#x27;hard text&#x27;.

Well... That&#x27;s an interesting point. I don&#x27;t really see why you (as 
a citizen of cubing-land) should decide for others how to behave. If 
someone else&#x27;s behavior is not in conflict with your interest, than 
why do you want to forbid that type of behavior? 

About the &#x27;having fun&#x27; argument, if you want to have fun, that&#x27;s 
fine with me. But some people just want to put their headphones on 
all day long, not making any contact with other people. Making a 
rule based on the idea that &#x27;competitors must have fun&#x27; is silly. If 
people don&#x27;t want to have fun, you can&#x27;t force them.

I&#x27;ll do it.. Hire me!! 

But really... What can people use in order to aid them in their 
solves?

Ga ik zeker doen :). Dank je!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Craig,

I have one other idea. Maybe if people like this idea, you could 
also have one &#x27;speed blindfold&#x27;, where the memorisation time doesn&#x27;t 
count. That way, people can plan their solve very carefully, and 
only time their execution.

I would certainly be interested in doing that :)

For the normal catergory, I think &#x27;best of 3&#x27; is a good format.

Good luck setting up the contest...!

- Joël.

          <div class="email-content">HOW TO MEMORISE 555 CUBE FOR BLD ?
                  There are 98 pieces (54 centers, 36 edges, and 8 cornors). Out of 54 centers, 6 pieces are fixed ans solved already. So, there are 92 pieces we have to memorise. If you want to blindsolve  piece by piece, then apply the peg system, decribed above in this page, to name the pieces and apply journey system to memorise. This is the system I used to blindsolve 555.
                If you want to blindsolve using 3 cycle system, then apply PAO method. How to create the Persons for 92 pieces is a difficult task. Here is the original method- DOMINIC SYSTEM, which my dad taught me IN 2004. As I am not  familiar with those English names and the actions are confusing to me, I did not take it as it was.. However, I understood the system fully well. Based on the idea of Dominic system I prepared my own persons and actions using my mother tongue TAMIL and tamil names with the help of my dad. This is the system I use to memorise cards, binary digits, random numbers in association with peg system(for objects) and journey system (to store the memorised information). Since, I have not learnt cycle system for blindsolving big cubes, I am not using this system for blindsolving big cubes.
              Now, I am interested in sharing with you all, the original Dominic system which I learnt in English, as almost all of you are english speaking people. The persons may be well known to you and the actions of them may be a culture, where you live. So, I think itmay be a great use to you to learn to memorise 555 cube.

                  But, there are some mistakes in actions. Mistakes in the sense, same action such as eating, shooting, singing, playing etc are assigned for many persons with different object. Since, we are going to use PAO method for memorising 555 cube, the actiond should be unique to every person. That is why , I prepared my own 100 different unique actions for all 100 people.
                  Hope, it is useful to many of you blindsolvers. In my opinion, I am able to vizualise the PAO prepared in my mother tongue more clearly than that of in my second languge. 
                  HAPPY MEMORISING CUBES!!!

              Here is a PAO system for memorising 555 cube. How to create Persons for 92 pieces (98 pieces) using Alphabets and their relative actions are given along with Peg system (Phonetic sound and value system) in the following page.

When Chris ran this contest that was a whole other division, but until
this becomes popular enough I was thinking of just letting it go in
the Open Division.  I&#x27;ll talk to you on MSN today sometime...

Hi Mike,

what&#x27;s your record now for solving the cube blindfolded?

Whats to stop someone from wiring up a set of earmuffs

would difficult, but it could be done.

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s not as much of the &quot;cheating&quot; factor as people should really be 
unaided while solving the cube.  Everyone has to deal with the same 
circumstances.

I can also almost guarantee that if you play music on headphones, I can 
hear it if I&#x27;m standing next to you.  You would have to play your music 
too softly for you to hear for it to be unheard by others.

          <div class="email-content">Uh yeah.  It would, but what are you going to do if they actually 
solved it that way?  That&#x27;s why I believe Fewest Move competition 
should utilize 40 move scrambling algorithms and should definitely not 
be allowed to use 25 move scrambling algorithms.

&quot;I had some divine inspiration and figured out the 25 moves!  Whoa, it 
just happens to be the inverse of the scramble.&quot;

There&#x27;s nothing anyone can do to absolutely refute that.  You might as 
well play it safe.

I am going deliberately slowly - and peeking as well.

So, I have no personal best. And I think that I
generally ask questions at this group and use it to
Â¤brain-stormÂ¤. Recently, I posted about the technique
which I have developed because I really really enjoy
the challenge of the logistics of the problem. 

I like this group because it overlaps with my memory
interest.

I think that, without time being a factor, what
interests me is making a solution that is robust and
my own - even if it is awkward or disadvantaging
compared with other methods.

ItÂ¤s like my keepie-uppie. I could never beat the
world record (I would need to stop and go to the
toilet) but it makes me happy to do it.

But I have recently recommended people in a memory
group to take on the RubikÂ¤s Cube (doing many in one
attempt) because the problem naturally lends itself to
mnemonics. 

I would particularly like some software so that I can
research the Â¤many cubesÂ¤ challenge and go back to a
saved session and examine where the solution went
wrong and where there are peeks and troughs of
concentration.

Yeah, that book is a general one. In the &quot;warnings&quot; section they do 
mention you should be careful about doing things impossible in your 
specific domain.

New idea: wear a camera that looks like an unsuspicious button. The 
video is transmitted to your buddy at a safe place. He tells you what 
to do using morse code transmitted to the needle attached to your 
butt.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Wait, does that mean you&#x27;ve never truly solved a Rubik&#x27;s cube 
blindfolded? Aren&#x27;t you the Michael Curtis who published a tutorial a 
while ago in which he strongly implies that he can solve the cube 
blindfolded that way? Personally I&#x27;d find that a bit strange if not 
irresponsible.

Hmm, I don&#x27;t understand. Where&#x27;s the problem? We all get the same

          <div class="email-content">How is it fair to me if someone listens to music and I have to deal 
with the residual noise from those earphones?  &quot;Oh, I&#x27;ll keep it quiet 
enough so that other people can&#x27;t hear.&quot;  What&#x27;s your definition of 
&quot;can&#x27;t hear&quot;?  People have different levels of hearing.  You might 
think something is ridiculously quiet, but if I can hear it, it would 
be a distraction to me.

MP3 players and CD players can sometimes make a very high pitched noise 
that people who use headphones can&#x27;t hear because their hearing has 
been damaged.  See if you can still hear up to 20 KHz.  Most people 
can&#x27;t anymore, but people who protect their hearing probably can.

          <div class="email-content">Slightly off-topic, but I have a question about this method. If I&#x27;m new to BLD, should I learn to use the POA method? Obviously it seems to be somewhat of a craze, and everyone is talking about how it&#x27;s such a powerful method. I don&#x27;t plan on ever attempting to solve my 4x4 or a 5x5 blindfolded, so is this method unnecessary?
   
  Should I learn some other method first?

    HOW TO MEMORISE 555 CUBE FOR BLD ?
                  There are 98 pieces (54 centers, 36 edges, and 8 cornors). Out of 54 centers, 6 pieces are fixed ans solved already. So, there are 92 pieces we have to memorise. If you want to blindsolve  piece by piece, then apply the peg system, decribed above in this page, to name the pieces and apply journey system to memorise. This is the system I used to blindsolve 555.
                If you want to blindsolve using 3 cycle system, then apply PAO method. How to create the Persons for 92 pieces is a difficult task. Here is the original method- DOMINIC SYSTEM, which my dad taught me IN 2004. As I am not  familiar with those English names and the actions are confusing to me, I did not take it as it was.. However, I understood the system fully well. Based on the idea of Dominic system I prepared my own persons and actions using my mother tongue TAMIL and tamil names with the help of my dad. This is the system I use to memorise cards, binary digits, random numbers in association with peg system(for objects) and journey system (to store the memorised information). Since, I have not learnt cycle system for blindsolving big cubes, I am not using this system for blindsolving big cubes.
              Now, I am interested in sharing with you all, the original Dominic system which I learnt in English, as almost all of you are english speaking people. The persons may be well known to you and the actions of them may be a culture, where you live. So, I think itmay be a great use to you to learn to memorise 555 cube.

Since, we are going to use PAO method for memorising 555 cube, the actiond should be unique to every person. That is why , I prepared my own 100 different unique actions for all 100 people.
                  Hope, it is useful to many of you blindsolvers. In my opinion, I am able to vizualise the PAO prepared in my mother tongue more clearly than that of in my second languge. 
                  HAPPY MEMORISING CUBES!!!

Tyson,

In fact, I am one of the persons who protect their hearing. That&#x27;s 
why you won&#x27;t be able to hear my headphones. I am not going to put 
all that sound into a few cm^3!

And, I don&#x27;t really want to wear headphones for BLD, but for 
speedsolving, it would be nice. And, during speedsovling, the 
audience is much louder than my headphones. No other competitors 
would have a problem with it, I can guarantee that.

- Joël.

          <div class="email-content">This PAO method is only to memorise the cube and not to bld solve the cube. If you know any method to bld solve a cube, then this PAO may be useful to you in memorising the cube.

    Slightly off-topic, but I have a question about this method. If I&#x27;m new to BLD, should I learn to use the POA method? Obviously it seems to be somewhat of a craze, and everyone is talking about how it&#x27;s such a powerful method. I don&#x27;t plan on ever attempting to solve my 4x4 or a 5x5 blindfolded, so is this method unnecessary?
   
  Should I learn some other method first?

    HOW TO MEMORISE 555 CUBE FOR BLD ?
                  There are 98 pieces (54 centers, 36 edges, and 8 cornors). Out of 54 centers, 6 pieces are fixed ans solved already. So, there are 92 pieces we have to memorise. If you want to blindsolve  piece by piece, then apply the peg system, decribed above in this page, to name the pieces and apply journey system to memorise. This is the system I used to blindsolve 555.
                If you want to blindsolve using 3 cycle system, then apply PAO method. How to create the Persons for 92 pieces is a difficult task. Here is the original method- DOMINIC SYSTEM, which my dad taught me IN 2004. As I am not  familiar with those English names and the actions are confusing to me, I did not take it as it was.. However, I understood the system fully well. Based on the idea of Dominic system I prepared my own persons and actions using my mother tongue TAMIL and tamil names with the help of my dad. This is the system I use to memorise cards, binary digits, random numbers in association with peg system(for objects) and journey system (to store the memorised information). Since, I have not learnt cycle system for blindsolving big cubes, I am not using this system for blindsolving big cubes.
              Now, I am interested in sharing with you all, the original Dominic system which I learnt in English, as almost all of you are english speaking people. The persons may be well known to you and the actions of them may be a culture, where you live. So, I think itmay be a great use to you to learn to memorise 555 cube.

                  But, there are some mistakes in actions. Mistakes in the sense, same action such as eating, shooting, singing, playing etc are assigned for many persons with different object. Since, we are going to use PAO method for memorising 555 cube, the actiond should be unique to every person. That is why , I prepared my own 100 different unique actions for all 100 people.
                  Hope, it is useful to many of you blindsolvers. In my opinion, I am able to vizualise the PAO prepared in my mother tongue more clearly than that of in my second languge. 
                  HAPPY MEMORISING CUBES!!!

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,<br>
<br>
Most of you know I have been working on solving in three cycles <br>
Pochmann style (cycling the stickers). This can solve 2 edges at a <br>
time. I have been making &#x27;procedures&#x27;/strategy&#x27;s in order to make <br>
this easy (strategy&#x27;s that describe how to handle every type of <br>
situation that can occor).  While making these strategy&#x27;s at first, <br>
I ended up describing almost all 440 cases I can get with this <br>
method... (That is, every three cycle of stickers that start at UR). <br>
So now I am almost done making a simpler procedure, that will have a <br>
bit more, but easier setup moves (usually 2 or so).<br>
<br>
Now, since I started making these tables, I didn&#x27;t try a lot BLD <br>
solves... But today, Craig asked me to race him with the webcam... <br>
At first, I didn&#x27;t want to, because I didn&#x27;t feel like I was up for <br>
it... But he convinced me to do it anyway... And I got a PB of <br>
2:20.91!!! Which is extremely good for me..<br>
<br>
The cool thing about this solve was, that during memorization, I <br>
didn&#x27;t only memorise the letters, but I was also thinking to <br>
myself: &#x27;Here I can use that alg, there I will use that commutator&#x27;. <br>
This was in fact also a way of memorization! And it made <br>
memorisation go a lot easier than usual.<br>
<br>
To give you guys an idea of how a nice solve with three cycles <br>
lookes like, here is the sramble, with my solution:<br>
<br>
Scramble:<br>
U F L2 D2 F U R B F2 U&#x27; D2 F D L F2 U&#x27; L U R2 U2 B R&#x27; D2 R L2 <br>
<br>
Defenitions:<br>
C := (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R)   (Corner alg)<br>
J := (L&#x27; U) (R U&#x27;) (L U2&#x27;) (R&#x27; U) (R U2 R&#x27;)<br>
T := RUR&#x27;U&#x27; R&#x27;F R2U&#x27;RU&#x27; RUR&#x27;F&#x27;<br>
<br>
Corners:<br>
1. DF&#x27; C FD&#x27;<br>
2. F&#x27;R&#x27; C RF<br>
3. R2D&#x27; C DR2<br>
4. F&#x27;D C D&#x27;F<br>
5. D C D&#x27;<br>
6. D&#x27; C D<br>
<br>
Edges:<br>
1. D&#x27; MU&#x27;M&#x27; D MUM&#x27;<br>
2. J<br>
3. R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R U R U&#x27; R <br>
4. URU&#x27;R&#x27; (E2) RUR&#x27;U&#x27; (E2) <br>
5. B2 L&#x27;U2L (E) L&#x27;U2L (E&#x27;)<br>
6. D2 L2 T L2 D2<br>
<br>
The edges were solve in about 72 moves (counting slice moves as 1). <br>
4 three cycles solved 8 edges :).<br>
<br>
Well.. That&#x27;s it for now!<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey JoÂ¤l
   
  that&#x27;s a nice scramble! I tried it and got 1:58, which is very good for me.
   
  Your way of solving looks very cool...I just don&#x27;t know much about that cool commutators...hehe
   
  Maybe I should solve the corners like that, and the edges with Stefan&#x27;s M2 method...it&#x27;s short...well...not as short as yours, as I have to orient the edges, but looks good...
   
  Hmm...I&#x27;m having some ideas...haha, should work...let me see...

  Hey guys,

Most of you know I have been working on solving in three cycles 
Pochmann style (cycling the stickers). This can solve 2 edges at a 
time. I have been making &#x27;procedures&#x27;/strategy&#x27;s in order to make 
this easy (strategy&#x27;s that describe how to handle every type of 
situation that can occor).  While making these strategy&#x27;s at first, 
I ended up describing almost all 440 cases I can get with this 
method... (That is, every three cycle of stickers that start at UR). 
So now I am almost done making a simpler procedure, that will have a 
bit more, but easier setup moves (usually 2 or so).

Now, since I started making these tables, I didn&#x27;t try a lot BLD 
solves... But today, Craig asked me to race him with the webcam... 
At first, I didn&#x27;t want to, because I didn&#x27;t feel like I was up for 
it... But he convinced me to do it anyway... And I got a PB of 
2:20.91!!! Which is extremely good for me..

The cool thing about this solve was, that during memorization, I 
didn&#x27;t only memorise the letters, but I was also thinking to 
myself: &#x27;Here I can use that alg, there I will use that commutator&#x27;. 
This was in fact also a way of memorization! And it made 
memorisation go a lot easier than usual.

To give you guys an idea of how a nice solve with three cycles 
lookes like, here is the sramble, with my solution:

Scramble:
U F L2 D2 F U R B F2 U&#x27; D2 F D L F2 U&#x27; L U R2 U2 B R&#x27; D2 R L2 

Defenitions:
C := (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R)   (Corner alg)
J := (L&#x27; U) (R U&#x27;) (L U2&#x27;) (R&#x27; U) (R U2 R&#x27;)
T := RUR&#x27;U&#x27; R&#x27;F R2U&#x27;RU&#x27; RUR&#x27;F&#x27;

Corners:
1. DF&#x27; C FD&#x27;
2. F&#x27;R&#x27; C RF
3. R2D&#x27; C DR2
4. F&#x27;D C D&#x27;F
5. D C D&#x27;
6. D&#x27; C D

Edges:
1. D&#x27; MU&#x27;M&#x27; D MUM&#x27;
2. J
3. R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R U R U&#x27; R 
4. URU&#x27;R&#x27; (E2) RUR&#x27;U&#x27; (E2) 
5. B2 L&#x27;U2L (E) L&#x27;U2L (E&#x27;)
6. D2 L2 T L2 D2

The edges were solve in about 72 moves (counting slice moves as 1). 
4 three cycles solved 8 edges :).

Well.. That&#x27;s it for now!

Have fun!

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

So I know my first message was really long, but I&#x27;m curious what you 
all think?  I&#x27;m still curious how others solve the cycles too, since 
this is the first thought that popped into my head when I first 
started thinking about BLD cubing for the larger cubes.  In fact I had 
to learn about Stefan&#x27;s big cube extension for his method from hearing 
it from him personally to learn that others do things differently.

I&#x27;m very partial to using freestyle cycles just because I&#x27;m used to 
them, but I&#x27;m always interested in learning about new methods.

Somebody post some ideas, I&#x27;m curious what you all use and/or what you 
all think of freestyle cycling!

&gt; people).<br>
<br>
Yeah I agree, the hardest part is making sure the pieces are setup <br>
in a way that you can use a commutator to cycle them.<br>
<br>
On example is this cycle (rUF-&gt;uFR-&gt;dFR) which I use (Uu) as my <br>
setup alg making the cycle (fUL-&gt;uFL-&gt;dFR) and I group uFL and dFR <br>
on the F slice and make fUL the lone edge.<br>
<br>
With practice you usually only need 1 setup turn, and somewhat often <br>
you can group two pieces on a face and have a lone edge just by the <br>
way you view the cube.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;  However I don&#x27;t know what they mean for BLD solving in <br>
&gt; terms of speed or if it&#x27;s easier to just use certain cycling algs <br>
&gt; similar to that of a 3x3, but I guess it depends on how fast you <br>
can <br>
&gt; setup the commutators.  I mean there are moves like F2 r B2 r&#x27; F2 <br>
r <br>
&gt; B2 r&#x27; that cycle wings and don&#x27;t require the use of an extensive <br>
&gt; commutator.  I think it&#x27;s a personal preference.<br>
<br>
Actually I use that type of commutator in my solving (F2 r B2 r&#x27; F2 <br>
r B2 r&#x27;).  It treats rUF and lDF as the two pieces in one face (both <br>
left edges) and the piece at lDB is the lone edge.<br>
<br>
The alg r B2 r&#x27; places the lone edge (lDB) into the spot rUF and the <br>
F2 turn moves lDF over to rUF.<br>
<br>
Let S=F2 and A=r B2 r&#x27; and do the commutator as SAS&#x27;A&#x27; to get the <br>
alg you just gave.<br>
<br>
Pretty much any alg you use to cycle edges on a 4x4x4 will have to <br>
be a commutator, unless it is an RrUu type alg in which case maybe <br>
it doesn&#x27;t have to be a commutator and can just take advantage of <br>
the rules of RrUu solving.  Other than that using a move to cycle <br>
edges will almost have to be a commutator to be a short useful alg <br>
to use. <br>
<br>
&gt;  I am also curious, <br>
&gt; Chris, how you go about memorizes the central edges and wings of <br>
&gt;the <br>
&gt; cube?<br>
<br>
I used to do this by rote memory and just picture the shapes they <br>
made inside the cube, or think this piece jumps down to over here, <br>
then steps to the side and climbs a ladder up to the U face again.  <br>
My experience in Georgia taught me that this is not a good idea <br>
because by your 4th solve you remember bits and pieces of your <br>
setups from other cubes, since the information is all in the same <br>
format.  I&#x27;m currently creating PAO triplets of letters for my edges <br>
and the centralmost edges and corners for the 5x5.  I may memorize <br>
the corners of the 4x4 visually still since it would go so quickly <br>
that way anyway, but I would prefer to memorize everything PAO style <br>
for the 5x5 to avoid any interference in a competition.<br>
<br>
Competing in Georgia really unnerved me and made me rethink my style <br>
of memorizing completely.  I highly recommend you try a couple <br>
solves in competition Marcus, it can really show you whether or not <br>
your method is a good one for handling interference from previous <br>
solves or not since you don&#x27;t get much time between solves.  My <br>
memorization method is great for memorizing at home in a quiet <br>
environment taking a long pause between solves, but it sucks <br>
horribly for doing this in competition.  Hence the reason I scrapped <br>
in completely in favor of PAO and just having LOTS of journeys <br>
prepared to be able to do a number of solves in a row.<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Craig and anyone else interested,

I do the centers the same way as I do the edges, only the rules are a 
bit different.

I always use freestyle commutators, and the rules you have to follow 
for edges don&#x27;t really apply so much to the 4x4.

Ok so here are some examples.

lfU->rfD->rbD->lfU

slice: r slice
lone center: lfU
S=f2
A=r F&#x27; r&#x27;
do as SAS&#x27;A&#x27;

-------------------------

lbU->dfL->drF->lbU

slice: d slice
lone center: lbU
S=d
A=r U2 r&#x27;
do as SAS&#x27;A&#x27;

-------------------------

lbU->rfU->lfD->lbU

setup moves P=l&#x27; F2 l

leaving
lbU->rfU->drF->lbU

slice: U slice
lone center: drF
A=l&#x27; d2 l
S=U2
do as PASA&#x27;S&#x27;P&#x27;

-------------------------

And lots more where that came from.  Again just get two pieces in one 
slice, one piece off that slice as the lone center.  Move the lone 
center to the spot it needs to go without disturbing anything else on 
that slice, move the other one of the two pieces into the working 
location, then undo both in commutator order to finish a 3 cycle.

Hope this helps,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Congratulations Richard,

Thats a nice achievement!! I know it&#x27;s not a world record, but 
that&#x27;s ok ;). My first blindfold solve was exactly like that (about 
30 minutes). I never thought I could do it under 10 minutes :D. But 
I was very wrong.. All it takes is a nice method, and a good way of 
memorising.

A good method of memorising is actually just as important as the 
solving method.

Well, if you need my advice about anything, just ask ;).

as you probably know i tried to solve 5 3x3x3cubes blindfolded at SveKub<br>

and the second counterclockwise i did the first counterclockwise..... the<br>
rest was ok. so 2 corners have been oriented bad. in the second i had an<br>
easy setup move: L2 D2, but when i had to undo it, i did D&#x27; L2. the rest was<br>
ok, so at the end 4 edges and 4 corners have been at the wrong position, but<br>
everything was oriented correctly. the next two have been solved correctly,<br>
and at the last, i just forgot 2 corner orientations. the funniest thing is:<br>
for the first cube i tried a new route, which i only used once. all of my<br>
other routes have 25 stations (8 for corners, 12 for edges, and 5 for<br>
orientations), but this one had only 24. i tried to forget the verry last<br>
edge. you dont have to memorize it. during the solve i forgot one station,<br>
so at the end i saw, that something does not fit togehter. there was no<br>
parity. so i had to undo the last 3 cycles and i did the rest correctly. <br>
<br>
i will now change to the PAO-methode and use it at the german cube day,<br>
where i will try to solve 5 cubes blindfolded again. and i m ust learn a new<br>
methode to memorize the corner orientations. <br>
<br>
by the way: stefan, what are your actual bld-times? do i have to practise a<br>
lot to defend the new german record or are you still using the pochmann<br>
methode? :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi all-<br>
I&#x27;ve been blindfold cubing since December, and I&#x27;ve just recently <br>
started attempting blindfold solves with my primary speedsolve <br>
method, CFOP.  I&#x27;ve tried three times over the past month or so and <br>
have yet to actually solve it (but, each time, I&#x27;ve figured out my <br>
exact mistake the second I opened my eyes). The first two tries were <br>
well over 2 hrs each, with about 30 seconds of solving.  About 10 <br>
minutes ago, I ended my third attempt to find my closest to being <br>
solved yet as well as the most obvious mistake.  I had done the OLL <br>
from the wrong side of the cube and opened my eyes to find the LL <br>
corners in the Pi/Bruno orientation.  The &quot;solve&quot; was as follows: <br>

It was scrambled with yellow on top, red in front, but solved (for <br>
some reason) with yellow on top, green in front.  I guess I just <br>
rotated the cube without noticing.  The y accounts for that <br>
rotation.  I used JNetCube to time memorization + solving, then <br>
started my stackmat at the beginning of the solve.<br>
<br>
The odd thing was that memorization was about 50 minutes.  That&#x27;s <br>
about half of what memorization was for my other solves.  Solving <br>
was 39.16 seconds, way longer than usual, and longer than my <br>
previous attempts, but oh well.  I didn&#x27;t want to mess up in the <br>
solving phase when I had such a better memorization time.<br>
<br>
Judging by my sharp decrease in time, I&#x27;m going to probably become <br>
more interested in speed blindfold cubing.  I wonder: How will this <br>
affect my speedcubing?  Maybe I&#x27;ll get better at looking ahead for <br>
F2L.  Maybe I&#x27;ll get out of the habit of rotating a billion times <br>
during F2L.  Maybe I&#x27;ll get better at finding a C/E pair during <br>
preinspection.  Who knows.<br>
<br>
Is anyone else into this blindfolded category?  I notice that, on <br>
speedcubing.com, Chris Hardwick is the only person to have submitted <br>
a time for this.  Geir Ugelstad did it at RWC &#x27;05; is anyone else <br>
doing/trying it now?<br>

Right now I&#x27;m still between 5-8 minutes usually. But tomorrow
I have my psychology exam and then I&#x27;m gonna develop/practice
like crazy so watch out :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tim,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve only ever attempted this twice, but yes I enjoy the speed <br>
blindsolving category.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sorry that you&#x27;ve had DNF&#x27;s so far, but just remember that for <br>
any type of blindsolving any practice is good practice.  BLD cubing <br>
in any form is a brain workout, so even if you get a DNF at least <br>
you still got the brain workout and are getting used to the mental <br>
effort required.<br>
<br>
What method do you use to memorize?<br>
<br>
I focus on one sticker per piece, and I number the stickers 1-14.  I <br>
always solve at least an Xcross by visual inspection, so I never <br>
have to number those 6 pieces.  If I manage a double extended cross, <br>
then I number the pieces 1-12.<br>
<br>
With 10-12 minutes of inspection you can usually spot something <br>
really nice for the cross and first pair, and the goal is to do a <br>
double extended cross if possible.<br>
<br>
After that I track the location change of each sticker through the <br>
extended cross solve.  This is not very efficient as far as <br>
memorizing goes, but it makes your solve really efficient which is <br>
what I go for.<br>
<br>
So after solving a good portion at the start visually, you now have <br>
a mental layout of the next stage of the cube.  Then just look at <br>
all your options and choose the one that lets you continue the <br>
fastest.  So maybe I would choose an RU style F2L alg, or if there <br>
is an empty slot case that&#x27;s only 5 moves I would choose that.  <br>
Always choose the way that let&#x27;s you continue the fastest.<br>
<br>
Then track every piece left through those moves and you end up with <br>
an updated state of the cube.  Again, updating every piece like this <br>
after every alg is ridiculously inefficient as far as memorizing <br>
goes, but it allows you to consider every possible option for your <br>
next step, and make the best decision of how to procede from there.<br>
<br>
I number the F2L pieces the highest numbers (9 and up) and I number <br>
the LL the lowest numbers (1-8).  This is because you solve F2L <br>
pieces before the LL obviously, and once pieces are solved you <br>
forget them completely to save memory.  So I choose to forget the <br>
higher numbers and just always be trying to remember where 1-8 is <br>
during F2L (where my LL is during the F2L).<br>
<br>
Also, knowing the state of the LL at all times gives you the option <br>
of influencing the LL at any point if you want.  So you can do <br>
partial edge control during the 4th F2L pair, or even make sure that <br>
you end up with all oriented edges after the last pair, stuff like <br>
that.<br>
<br>
I view speed blindfold as going for the best solve possible, even if <br>
it takes a very, very long time to memorize.<br>
<br>
Also, one thing that helps me is that after I have memorized my <br>
entire solve I rehearse it with my hands on my &quot;air cube&quot; many <br>
times.  This helps to make sure your hands are used to the solve <br>
enough to try to go fast.  Don&#x27;t feel bad if it looks funny, it puts <br>
your solve into muscle memory with your hands as well as your short <br>
term memory in your head, which is a good thing!<br>
<br>
Again I don&#x27;t know if you already use or do this but I just wanted <br>
to post what I do in case you were looking for some pointers.  It&#x27;s <br>
a fun category, but boy is it stressful!  Especially when you first <br>
start doing moves on your cube!<br>
<br>
Good luck to you, and let us know how your progress goes!<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S.  Craig good luck too with speed blindfold solving!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tim,

I never tried this, and I don&#x27;t think I ever will (with a normal 
speedcubing method). I don&#x27;t exactly see the fun of it :). But I 
really admire people who have the patience to study the cube for 2 
hours or so to do this!

One of the things I do want to try, is to do a speedblindsolve with 
a normal blindfold cubing method. I think with my method, it&#x27;s 
fairly easy to get under a minute. I think 40 seconds would also be 
doable. I&#x27;ll try it once..

What are you develloping?

Did you see my post a while ago, about my solve with your method, 
but thee cycles for the edges? It works nicely :).

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris-<br>
My method is vastly different.  I don&#x27;t do xcrosses in speedsolving, <br>
and I don&#x27;t really try in this either.  First I find a regular <br>
cross...the one that I used last time (R&#x27; F&#x27; D2 R&#x27; F2 D) was good <br>
since it didn&#x27;t disturb the LUB 2x2x2 block, which is good since <br>
while tracking pieces down they stayed where they were for the <br>
cross.  Then I pick a bottom layer corner and watch what happens (in <br>
my head) when I execute the cross.  If it&#x27;s in the LL or in the <br>
right slot, I find the corresponding edge and do the same thing.  If <br>
they&#x27;re both good, I figure out the F2L case (definately attempting <br>
to do 2-gen wherever possible).  Then I go through each F2L pair and <br>
do the same thing (each one being harder than the last as I have to <br>
follow it through more turns).<br>
<br>
Once I&#x27;ve finished F2L in my head, I&#x27;ll redo it.  I&#x27;ll pick the <br>
first CE pair (first the corner then the edge) and check that it is <br>
solved.  Then the next and so on.  After that, I&#x27;ll be done with F2L <br>
in my head (I usually don&#x27;t have any trouble remembering it since I <br>
will have executed each algorithm a few times in my head).  LL time.<br>
<br>
I look at edges first.  Again, back to the beginning and execute the <br>
entire solve.  I then put that piece where it is on the LL.  The <br>
last one is basically a way of checking what I&#x27;d done up till then.  <br>
If two pieces are in one spot, or the orientation is bad, I&#x27;ll know <br>
something&#x27;s wrong.  Once I finish edges, I convert the permutation <br>
into arrows indicating where each piece needs to move and store the <br>
orientation in my head.  Then I do basically the exact same thing <br>
for corners.  So I&#x27;ll have a permutation and an orientation.  I <br>
don&#x27;t convert it to numbers; I just convert it to 1 or 2 PLL&#x27;s.  For <br>
instance, using the keyboard numberpad idea that Macky uses on his <br>
PLL page, the permutation I had at the beginning of OLL on that last <br>
solve was (7 9) (1 3) (2 8 4).  I remembered that as a combination <br>
of the E and U permutations (for distinguishing between U&#x27;s...I <br>
guess I just remembered that the piece going across was front to <br>
back and that it used the left edge)<br>
<br>
So then I&#x27;ll figure out the OLL; not hard since I&#x27;ll know what it <br>
looks like.  Then I&#x27;ll take that OLL and figure out how the pieces <br>
are permuted.  For the OLL I used, it was a Z permutation with front <br>
switching with left.  I guess if I wanted to really get serious <br>
about this, I could do one of two things.  One is learn what each <br>
OLL does, a feasible idea.  Second is learn orientation that doesn&#x27;t <br>
disturb permutation, an idea i&#x27;m not so crazy about.  So, anyway, I <br>
took the Z permutation and applied it to the permutation I had <br>
before.  It was easy since Z leaves corners alone.  Then I had a new <br>
permutation, the E permutation plus the U permutation going L -&gt; B -<br>
&gt; R.  Then I figured out what PLL that turned into.  I knew that the <br>
edges weren&#x27;t solved, so it would be a diagonal swap.  So I tried <br>
doing a U turn in my mind and saw that two edges were solved, and <br>
the two that needed to swap were in F and L.  The LF and BR corners <br>
were solved, so it was the V permutation.  I figured out which way I <br>
held the cube for that (it comes naturally when you can see it, but <br>
not so much when you can&#x27;t).  Then I was done.  blindfold on, start <br>
the camera (in case I solve it or can&#x27;t figure out where I went <br>
wrong) and stackmat, and go.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not great at xcrosses in regular speedcubing, so I don&#x27;t think <br>
I&#x27;ll really try that here yet.  Keeping closer track after each F2L <br>
might help me so I don&#x27;t have to search for each piece.  Also I <br>
might try partial edge control or simply orienting all edges.  I&#x27;m <br>
just afraid of getting things too complicated to figure out in my <br>
head.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all your advice.  I&#x27;m going to start another attempt in <br>
about half an hour.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll solve it this time!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hehehe, Stefan, I&#x27;m interested, just so you know...And I think I am<br>
unofficially the fastest person with your method...got it today...30<br>
seconds memo, 2 seconds to put on the BLD, total time of 1:50.16  I<br>
had a witness sitting on the other side of the table.  I was talking<br>
to Tyson, and I think we figured out a limit for using your basic<br>
method.  Assuming there is no pauses between algs and setup moves:<br>
<br>
30 seconds for memo is probably the limit.  Say each alg (including<br>
setup and setdown moves) takes 4 seconds, the fastest non-lucky would<br>
be 4 algs for corners + 8 for edges, so 12 algs.  Saying each alg<br>
takes 4 seconds...thats 48 seconds for execution, with no pauses...<br>
<br>
30 + 48 = 78 seconds, and that is on the easiest case.  The absolute<br>
WORST case would be:<br>
<br>
Considering the Parity fix...that brings in a whole new ball game. <br>
And Stefan: If I have 2 edges oriented wrong at the end I just set<br>
them up and do a 2 flip, instead of executing the T perm 4 times, or J<br>
perm or w/e...<br>
<br>
(all corners in place, but oriented wrong)<br>
14 for corners + 22 for edges (obviously this will never happen...but...)<br>
36 * 4 = 144 seconds (considering perfect execution) Which is 2<br>
minutes 24 seconds...add that to the memorization (which actually<br>
wouldn&#x27;t be long, except for the corners) you get about a 3 minute<br>
solve...so maybe this isn&#x27;t the worst case, because it is so easily<br>
recognized and memorized, but something along these lines...I&#x27;m just<br>
saying, with the cycles method that Leyan and Tyson and many others<br>
use, I think sub-1 would be possible (if you took Tyson&#x27;s memo with<br>
Leyan&#x27;s execution, with a little more practice)<br>

U&#x27;, only three edge pieces move...

Anyway, my 4th attempt was DNF.

I misplanned for one of the corner-edge pairs, so the corner was 
twisted in its spot.  Then I did F U2 F&#x27; U2 F U&#x27; F&#x27; instead of F U2 
F&#x27; U F U&#x27; F&#x27; for another, and I messed up figuring out how the OLL 
affected permutation.  I&#x27;ll try again thursday night, but one per 
night is my limit and I can&#x27;t tomorrow.

Total time was 65:55, 35.21 of actual solving.

Maybe next time...

          <div class="email-content">Re: the parity fix in Stefan&#x27;s method...

To tell you the truth, I don&#x27;t do a parity fix.  Well, sometimes I 
do, but usually I just memorize the corners the way they would be 
after swapping the two UR corners.  Then again, my times and 
consistency aren&#x27;t that amazing, so I&#x27;m not the expert in BLD.

Another comment:  For the DR edge, instead of the setup move D2 L2 
to do the T permutation, one can always just do S&#x27; and the T 
permutation.  If you&#x27;re doing a 3x3 super BLD, that might throw you 
off, but doing it in on a regular cube is fine.

Hope my ideas are of help.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I just wanted to say that I didn&#x27;t disappear, I&#x27;m still learning PAO.<br>
 Last night, with the help of a bunch of cubers over IM, I finally<br>
finished my triplets for the 5x5x5.<br>
<br>
What I did to handle a 5x5x5 is this, I used the letters A-W and Y for<br>
each of the center orbits and the wing edges.  So I have 72 pictures<br>
each with the three person action object parts.<br>
<br>
I just finished them last night literally, so I still have to apply<br>
them to my cube and make sure I have them memorized.<br>
<br>
I so far only have one journey with 24 locations, so I can handle the<br>
edges and centers of a 4x4x4 (doing the corners my regular way for<br>
now) only for one solve.<br>
<br>
So I&#x27;m very behind on my journeys and also on applying my new triplets<br>
to my cubes, but I&#x27;m getting there slowly but surely.<br>
<br>
I want very much to use something similar to PAO for the 3x3x3 which<br>
would also mean for the central edges and corners of a 5x5x5 and part<br>
of that system for the corners of a 2x2.<br>
<br>
What I am thinking of doing is using the Major system for the 3x3x3,<br>
and applying it to use like Joel does for the edges.  So I will have<br>
24 pictures telling me where the piece goes and how to flip it when i<br>
move it there, that way I can use commutators.<br>
<br>
I guess I&#x27;ll still use orient first then permute for the corners, but<br>
I might consider using commutators for this part too.<br>
<br>
Anyway does anyone have any advice on applying the Major system to the<br>
3x3x3?  I&#x27;ve seen that the letters MNRSTP tend to come up more often<br>
than A-H or A-L for the corners and edges.  I would rather be using<br>
what the memory experts use here if possible.<br>
<br>
Alright, well I&#x27;m very excited to be almost ready to use PAO for my<br>
solving.  I&#x27;ve been taking a break from using my old method, but I<br>
think I still might not be ready to use PAO by the April tournament in<br>
Tennesse where I&#x27;ll attempt the 4x4x4, so I think I&#x27;ll just use my old<br>
stuff in April, then completely give it up for PAO afterward.<br>
<br>
Alright, well I just wanted to post to say I haven&#x27;t disappeared, I<br>
just found that coming up with 72 triplets is not easy and I still<br>
have the 20 pieces that make up a 3x3x3 cube as well *sigh*<br>
<br>
Can anyone offer any help on using Major for the 3x3?  Marcus I know<br>
you do this, which letters do you like for the pieces?  I would be<br>
very appreciative of any help from anyone on this.<br>
<br>
Thanks all, and I hope to be a PAO memorizer myself soon!!<br>

<br>
I use the Major system for corner permutation using the letters <br>
TNSHRDL, although sometimes I might substitute the D for a P if it <br>
makes more sense.  I think I gave you such an example of how to use <br>
Major with the permutes last night on IM, lol &quot;NDHLR&quot; diirrtyy.<br>
<br>
The thing about PAO, is while it&#x27;s powerful, the learning curve is <br>
huge.  Many memory experts from what I&#x27;ve seen use PAO constantly in <br>
everyday life and develop a strong sense of instant translation <br>
after years of practice.  This is why I think PAO may discourage <br>
people initially because the system&#x27;s complex in terms of <br>
integrating it into your &quot;reflexive memory.&quot; While it may increase <br>
accuracy, I don&#x27;t know what it would mean for speed.  The &quot;speed <br>
over time&quot; graph under PAO would probably stay very high for a while <br>
then take a sudden nosedive... but the question is, how long is one <br>
willing to practice for that nosedive? And, for a 3x3x3, is that <br>
nosedive even worth it if the information can be stored in an easy <br>
format that does not require extensive PAO foundational structures?  <br>
<br>
&gt; Can anyone offer any help on using Major for the 3x3?  Marcus I <br>

<br>
I don&#x27;t really use the Major system for CO or for EO, but it can be <br>
useful for permutations of course, and I use it for corners (I&#x27;ve <br>
actually used vector structures a little less now for accuracy <br>
reasons, although it does sacrifice a bit of speed at first).  I am <br>
sure it would work well for edges too, I just haven&#x27;t done it.  Just <br>
use consonants (not vowels!) for the pieces.  I&#x27;ve just found that <br>
with so many edges it can be a hassle determining where cycles end <br>
as a long string of letters can be broken into many words, etc. The <br>
endpoints of the cycles can get confused with the endpoints of a <br>
given word, but for corners this rarely happens because it&#x27;s pretty <br>
easy to make one word per cycle, or two if you want to stretch it, <br>
but with edges... in my experience, Major system can be a little <br>
messy.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
What do you guys think would be better?  To use PAO for the <br>
permutation of every piece, and to just use visualization for the <br>
orientation of corners.  OR would it be better to use PAO for the <br>
centers and wing edges, then to use the Major method for the corners <br>
and central edges?<br>
<br>
I have PAO triplets for 72 pieces and I&#x27;m not excited about the idea <br>
of coming up with 20 more but if it would be better than using 72 PAO <br>
and 20 Major then I can do that.<br>
<br>
What do you guys think?<br>

Hi all,<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t had a second successful blindfold solve yet.  My DNF&#x27;s <br>
however have been closer to solved and the times much faster.  This <br>
makes me happy :)<br>
<br>
The PAO method has inspired me in other ways besides bld cubing.  I <br>
plan on learning many more memorization techniques and prepare for <br>
events that would occur in a memory tournament.<br>
<br>
Perhaps after some work I could compete :)  I&#x27;ve applied PAO to <br>
memorizing binary.  Within 1 hour of applying this technique I was <br>
able to memorize 24 binary in under 10 seconds.  I haven&#x27;t pushed <br>
the limit yet until I am comfortable with my system.<br>
<br>
I am also interested in memorizing playing cards.  I think the PAO <br>
method would still be good for this.  I&#x27;m also interested in <br>
memorizing random numbers and I&#x27;ll probably use the peg system for <br>
that.<br>
<br>
Also, a common memory event at competitions is memorizing text.  <br>
excerpts from a book, poetry, etc.  What technique is applied here?  <br>
It just seems so wild.<br>
<br>
Sorry about the mostly-not-cube-related post everyone.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not sure if there is a page on this method, but here is a short
description. You assign each piece a Person, Action, and Object. Then,
as you are memorizing, the first piece is a Person, and the next piece
is the Action that the Person is doing. The third piece is the Object
that is being done in the Action. You then place this combination in a
loacation on a journey, such as your trip to work or school. You can
then recall this while you are solving.

Hope that helps.

I request a only one link exchange with Gilles Roux a long time ago

Petrus use a personnel method and Roux use the information for his 
method. Petrus is not Roux, open your eye but he is a good creative 
method and funny video, I like that !

Roux  use a average 19 sec. official  and he is good in English not 
me.

Anyway, I&#x27;m a winner of 25e of cube.

Sebastien use a average official of 24 with my method and my system 
is better without inspection. My method 2x2x2 is good and Gustav is 
2e best single.  My system for the fewest move is beautiful, the

 No, Leone isn&#x27;t a western only, He is brillant, this life is

I tried several times to download it but it never worked. Can you put 
it on some other server? There&#x27;s also a problem with your email 
address, I tried to mail you because of the download problem and got

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been trawling through the blindfold PDF of richards, but I find<br>
the description somewhat confusing of his 3x3x3 method.<br>
<br>
I understand everything apart from the edge permutation.<br>
<br>
I know that a string of numbers is memorised, and it tells where every<br>
piece wants to go on the cube. Not in a &#x27;conventional&#x27; way of<br>
memorising (like cycles) but like a list.<br>
<br>
The thing I don&#x27;t get is. When you cycle pieces around, what do you<br>
update in your memory when you do a 3-cycle? I think editing specific<br>
values in a list would be good (each item in list corresponding to<br>
cubie) but i don&#x27;t get what to edit :) (obviously the cubes you&#x27;re<br>
working with but....)<br>
<br>
Could someone provide me with an example solve/explanation? I think<br>
i&#x27;m on teh verge of understanding, but I&#x27;ve lost something somewhere.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Nevermind, got it :)

I just have to assign each cubie&#x27;s place a number, instead of having a
list of numbers. That&#x27;s better to understand and I get it now. Clever :)

I think if you split the corners into a black group
and a white group like a checker board, you have only
14 cases instead of 23 :-)

          <div class="email-content">Haha, I thought something like this was going to happen to me! Not the
other way around. Sorry I published it :P

Feel free to use my algs or ask me for anymore. I&#x27;m trying to create a
new set that are optimised with U and R turns.

I thought my page/method/idea is finished but maybe we can pool ideas
and improve it further? Maybe create a joint system?

I think today I shall spend learning the algs. I&#x27;ll then do an average
of KCO blindfolded.

Stefan: do you mean removing mirrors and inverses? I don&#x27;t fully
understand you.

Hopefully no-one&#x27;s thought of the following as an edge permutation
system? (already orientated)

Pemutate edges to E slice, permutate edges within E slice + fix parity
with corners.
Bring edges to respective layers.
Permutate all edges within U/D.

I don&#x27;t know how feasable this would be but 4 algs to complete edge
permutation sounds nice :) Probibly have to learn too many though. If
so, I&#x27;ll simplify things a bit. Or maybe it&#x27;s too much like Carr&#x27;s
system. It uses his method of memorisation.

Thanks,

So it&#x27;s always done in four steps. (As you can see, I&#x27;m already
getting this method together)

I just currently don&#x27;t know about the numebr of algs to be used.

          <div class="email-content">Swapping one set from top to bottom is easy.

One edge:
M&#x27; U2 M U2
Two edges:
M&#x27; U2 M2 U2 M&#x27;
F2 D L2 F2 L2 D R&#x27; L D2 R L 
Three edges:
L&#x27; B2 L2 F2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R&#x27;
Four Edges:
L2 F2 R2 B2 F2 R2 F2 R2

With those, you can do every case with next to no setup moves. If you
learn a few more algs, you do it with no setup moves.

Swapping a large number of edges shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.

When you get to doing the last eight edges, you should have a string
of numbers that is eight numbers long (1 2 3 4 9 10 11 12 == solved)
that you match upto an alg in your head.

Here&#x27;s an example solve of what I mean.

Scramble: U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; F2 L&#x27; F2 D&#x27; B&#x27; R2 U&#x27; F D L&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; D F2 U&#x27; B L2
F2 R2 U2 B&#x27;

corner orientation: U2 F2 R2 U&#x27; L&#x27; U L B2 L D L&#x27; B2 R2 F2 U&#x27; z2 x2 z
(R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L) z&#x27; x2 

Then go about permutating the corners, when you hit the parity, just
swap UF and UB. Now orientate the edges.

place two E edges: y2xB&#x27;F&#x27; (Zperm) B F x&#x27;y2

finish E: xF (3cycle clockwise on UF, UL, UB)F&#x27;x&#x27;

Bring edges to correct layers; F2 D L2 F2 L2 D R&#x27; L D2 R L 

UF = 1
UL = 2
UB = 3
UR = 4
DF = 9
DL = 10
DB = 11
DR = 12
Edges = 2 3 4 1 10 12 9 11
Cycle notation (not used) = (1 2 3 4)(9 10 12 11)
Pemutate edges within their layers: R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; B2 U D&#x27; R L U B2 R2

There, nice and easy - 4 step edge permutation.

With probibly around 30 algs to learn?

Uh, I must admit I didn&#x27;t check your 23 cases when I compared my 14 to 
them. Do yours include mirrors/inverses? Mine do.

Notice I&#x27;m not talking about orienting 4 corners of one layer but of

Here&#x27;s my list of sets of orientations:

0001
0002
0011
0012
0022
0111
0112
0122
0222
1111
1112
1122
1222
2222

Which are missing?

Hi Thom,<br>
<br>
&gt; Hopefully no-one&#x27;s thought of the following as an edge permutation<br>
&gt; system? (already orientated)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Pemutate edges to E slice, permutate edges within E slice + fix parity<br>
&gt; with corners.<br>
&gt; Bring edges to respective layers.<br>
&gt; Permutate all edges within U/D.<br>
<br>
Nice to see some others trying Carr&#x27;s system.  In message #952, I tried <br>
to outline what I do.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 yrs, and am about at my <br>
limit.  I&#x27;ve been hoping others would take it to new levels, so I am <br>
glad to see some guys now.  I&#x27;ve tried many little tweaks to the <br>
system, with varying degrees of success.  <br>
  <br>
Good luck<br>

A few problems I&#x27;ve encountered over time.  If one could get all E <br>
edges to E layer in one move, that would be cool; I tried that for a <br>
long time, but finally abandoned it, because it was too hard for me <br>
to work out where the pieces would end up.<br>
<br>
As to swapping U and D edges, I found a move like: <br>
F2 D L2 F2 L2 D R&#x27; L D2 R L too difficult, for like reasons, and <br>
finally just settled on swapping them when they are opposite one <br>
another.  In theory such a move should be faster though, so I hope <br>
someone can use it.  <br>
<br>
When permuting the U/D together, I decided to make each layer an even <br>
perm first, if needed, just to cut down on algs.  Learning more might <br>
be faster though, so go for it if you wish.<br>
<br>
Keep coming up with good ideas!<br>
<br>

That&#x27;s for the same case as for example this alg?

And if you replace B2 with f2 you get this alg:
(R2 F2 D f2)*2
Easy to remember, huh?

And if you rotate the cube a bit around URF:
(x&#x27; z&#x27;) (U2 R2 B r2&#x27;)*2 (z x)
Easy to twist, huh?

Cheers!

Yeah, sadly I can&#x27;t manipulate that one fast enough in my head either.  <br>
I tried, and I wish I could, but I resorted to 3-cycling the two D&#x27;s on <br>
U opposite, then swapping.  <br>

You mean it&#x27;s easier for you to do it in two steps and involve a fifth 
piece than to directly do two clean swaps?

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I recently started learning a new system, one that I helped piece<br>
together with lots of help from John Louis, J. Bernett, and over at<br>
the memory sports group Boris Konrad, Ben Pridmore, and Simon Orton.<br>
<br>
The system uses 576 images that must be prepared in advance, and<br>
memorizes by applying a letter to each piece in a 24 piece orbital and<br>
combining two letters into an image.  These images are then placed<br>
along a prepared journey.<br>
<br>
I will then use this system as well as a few journeys to memorize each<br>
cube.<br>
<br>
I like that it combines the simplicity of using one image per<br>
location, as well as the complexity of a really good system with lots<br>
of prepared images.  This method is a good mix of both worlds for me,<br>
and I am really excited to learn it!<br>
<br>
Right now I am preparing my images for all the ways to combine the<br>
letters A-X without using the same letter twice.  That is 552 images,<br>
and the remaining 24 come from if I end with an odd cycle and just<br>
have one letter left, so I&#x27;ll need 24 more images for the letters A-X<br>
stand alone.<br>
<br>
I doubt this method is entirely new, and I&#x27;m sure it already exists. <br>
But I&#x27;m happy to have &quot;discovered&quot; it with lots of help from others. <br>
I plan on using this method in the future, and I am currently writing<br>
out all my images for all the letter pairs.<br>
<br>
This website is a tremendously helpful resource to me,<br>
http://www.nakedscience.com/memory/Alphabet%20Letter%20Pairs.htm<br>
<br>
I am using those images as a base and changing them to be ones that<br>
relate to me more instead of just learning that list.<br>
<br>
I hope everyone is enjoying learning new memorization techniques, I am<br>
very excited about learning this one!  I haven&#x27;t thought if this<br>
method combines well for the 3x3, I imagine it would, but my primary<br>
interests right now are the 4x4 and 5x5, so that is why I wanted a<br>
method structured this way.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps for anyone interested in hearing about<br>
cool/interesting/fun ways to memorize a bigger cube.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

I just wanted to update on my progress.  So far I have all my images
for if the first letter is an A,B, or C.  I also just started working
on the D&#x27;s today.

So far I have about 70 images prepared, and this is going surprisingly
quicker than I thought it would!  It really isn&#x27;t that hard to learn
the images in one letter group.

Anyway, in case anyone is interested in learning this approach too, it
really isn&#x27;t as much work as I was expecting!  Plus some of the images
are really obvious, and easily correlate to the letters used to define
them.

Hope we can take memorizing to a new level for cubing, because I don&#x27;t
think rote memory is as powerful as people claim it to be.  But again,
that is of course just my personal opinion.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I am looking for a good commutator type (i.e. &quot;alg&quot;) for this <br>
situation.<br>
<br>
(mUF mUB) (mDF mDB)<br>
<br>
Where &quot;m&quot; stands for the centralmost slice only in the L-R parallel <br>
layers.<br>
<br>
I ran into this during a solve, and in order to be careful and not <br>
mess up I did: <br>
<br>
U2 m&#x27; U2 m U2 m&#x27; U2 m B2 m B2 m&#x27; B2 m B2 m&#x27;<br>
<br>
I am not allowed to do anything else to the cube at this point other <br>
than switch those 4 pieces.  There is literally nothing solved but <br>
orientation and corner permutation (except for parity if it exists).<br>
<br>
After the solve while looking back I thought about this:<br>
U&#x27; R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U m2 U&#x27; R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U m2<br>
<br>
Both algorithms are the same length just by a straight count, but I <br>
like the 2nd one better since it involves only two inner layer <br>
turns.  Also is 16 turns STM a good count for this?  Is that optimal?<br>
<br>
Does anyone have a good fast alg for this?  So far I am sticking to <br>
the second one above, but I am open to learning more ways to do <br>
this.  I will also think about other ways to tackle this problem too.<br>

Why R2 all the time instead of alternating R&#x27; and R?

Alternative suggestion:
m&#x27; (U D&#x27; R2 D U&#x27;) m2 (U D&#x27; R2 D U&#x27;) m&#x27;

  If you want to memorise anything associate the first one with the second one ridiculously and visualize the picture as real in your minds eye atleast for few seconds. Slowly with practice the few seconds will become fraction of seconds,
   
  How to make the association ridiculous ?
  1).Exaggerate the size
  2).Exaggerate thenumbers
  3).Substitute
        
  Hope this helps you

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

That&#x27;s a really cool way to do that, I hadn&#x27;t thought of that!

Looking at your way led me to this, it&#x27;s not as easy to execute, but I
would prefer the shorter move to be honest.

F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B m2 F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B m2

If you saw this from the other angle it could be just your alg minus
the setup (U D&#x27; R2 D U&#x27;) m2 (U D&#x27; R2 D U&#x27;) m2 which is how I thought
of it.

This is cool.  I kind of wonder if this is possible in fewer moves
though lol.  This is fun.

I&#x27;m also looking at this, but it doesn&#x27;t preserve the centers :-S
m U2 m2 U2 m

Maybe there is a way to use this as a base for a slightly longer alg,
but keep those 3x1 blocks on F and B from flipping somehow?

Just an idea, I don&#x27;t know of a way but I&#x27;ll keep looking.

Thanks for the advice.  I have been trying to follow #1 and #2 a lot

But I don&#x27;t think I do #3 as much.  Sometimes I will change the image
a little bit to make things easier to remember, but I don&#x27;t think I do
this very often.  Like sometimes for &quot;North Pole&quot; I will picture
&quot;Santa Claus&quot; instead if this is what you mean?

I have noticed that I am getting more comfortable using journeys and
applying images to a location.  I have also noticed that using
journeys have made me much better at visualizing my stories for my
linked lists.  They are getting less abstract and the stories are
getting more detailed.  It seems that these journeys are a real mental
workout, and help for mental ability to visualize!  Or at least for me
they seem to make these things easier.

But I don&#x27;t think I do #3 as much.  Sometimes I will change the image
a little bit to make things easier to remember, but I don&#x27;t think I do
this very often.  Like sometimes for &quot;North Pole&quot; I will picture
&quot;Santa Claus&quot; instead if this is what you mean?

I have noticed that I am getting more comfortable using journeys and
applying images to a location.  I have also noticed that using
journeys have made me much better at visualizing my stories for my
linked lists.  They are getting less abstract and the stories are
getting more detailed.  It seems that these journeys are a real mental
workout, and help for mental ability to visualize!  Or at least for me
they seem to make these things easier.

          <div class="email-content">Dear Chris,
        Instead of story method you can use Link system. Both may appear same to you. But they are different. Link method uses your natural/original memory . You may not realise you are using locations at different places unlike in a journey in sequence. This type of memorisation is much faster.
   
       For example, you have to memorise the pieces in the following order and you are using substitution to make it ridiculous.
  1). Button
  2). Crocdile
  3). Knife
  4). Table tennis bat
  5). Barbecue
   
          Here, I am not creating story. Instead I am just linking using substitution.
  1).Through the hole in the Button a Crocodile crawls. Visualize it in your minds eye.
  2).Its every teeth is a big knife.Visualize it in your minds eye.
  3).Its handle is like a tt bat. Visualize it in your minds eye.
  4).Instead of hitting a ball, you are hitting a Barbecue. Visualize it in your minds eye.
            This way you can memorise much faster, I think. If you visualize properly, revision is not required.
  Have fun,

Yeah that&#x27;s what I came up with originally and then translated to what

Ämne: [blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube] 5x5x5 commutator type for central edges

 

Hey everyone,

I am looking for a good commutator type (i.e. &quot;alg&quot;) for this 
situation.

(mUF mUB) (mDF mDB)

Where &quot;m&quot; stands for the centralmost slice only in the L-R parallel 
layers.

I ran into this during a solve, and in order to be careful and not 
mess up I did: 

U2 m&#x27; U2 m U2 m&#x27; U2 m B2 m B2 m&#x27; B2 m B2 m&#x27;

I am not allowed to do anything else to the cube at this point other 
than switch those 4 pieces.  There is literally nothing solved but 
orientation and corner permutation (except for parity if it exists).

After the solve while looking back I thought about this:
U&#x27; R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U m2 U&#x27; R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U m2

Both algorithms are the same length just by a straight count, but I 
like the 2nd one better since it involves only two inner layer 
turns.  Also is 16 turns STM a good count for this?  Is that optimal?

Does anyone have a good fast alg for this?  So far I am sticking to 
the second one above, but I am open to learning more ways to do 
this.  I will also think about other ways to tackle this problem too.

Chris

I couldn&#x27;t use m2 U2 m2 U2 because it doesn&#x27;t preserve the centers.

m2 U2 m2 U2 does swap the edges I need, but it would also perform the
following cycles to the centers:

(mbU mfU) (mfD mbD) which would potentially mess up my center cycles
unless I used a move to correct those 4 centers.

So far I can&#x27;t think of anything shorter than Stefan&#x27;s alg to swap
just those 4 pieces, and not affect centers at all.

I logged into your site and am really excited about trying this, but I
have a request.  Can you run competitions for the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5
blindfolded as well?  Those are my focus, and I very much prefer to be
able to do these instead of the 3x3.

Thanks,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I just wanted to give an update on my progress so far.  I&#x27;m coming up<br>
with images for all the possible ways to pair two letters A through X<br>
without repeating letters (no AA, BB, CC, DD, EE, etc.).  So far I<br>
have images for everything AB-EX which is 115 images.  I also have<br>
certain pairs later on planned, like OT will be Oliver Twist, stuff<br>
like that.  So I probably know maybe 125 or so right now.<br>
<br>
Right now I have pretty fast recall on my images for AB-DX and I am<br>
working on studying my E&#x27;s to make sure I&#x27;m solid on those before<br>
moving on to the F&#x27;s.<br>
<br>
I just tested using my old images (only 24, or one per piece) for<br>
memorizing the edges but I used two images at each journey location<br>
instead of just one.  The memorization went a bit faster than normal,<br>
so I think using this new large bank of images will make things much<br>
easier for memorizing the edge orbitals.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m also thinking of a way to use the &quot;Roman Room&quot; technique to use<br>
the same images for my centers.<br>
<br>
Also John Louis I really like your method of zooming in.  Stuff like<br>
Having an &quot;Alligator&quot; but then all the teeth of the Alligators are<br>
&quot;Knives&quot; and the handles of those knives are wrapped in &quot;cotton&quot; and<br>
inside the cotton is a herd of microscopic &quot;Giraffes&quot; or something<br>
weird like that.  I really want to try this idea out some too.<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;m about 125 images into my 576 or about 22% finished.<br>
<br>
Can&#x27;t wait until I&#x27;m done!  I&#x27;ll try to keep udating about my progress.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,

I think that would be a great idea to integrate this into the forums
somehow.

I just want to add though that Ryan designed and built this
competition solely on his own, and then later asked me to help with
running it.  So I&#x27;m not in any way a creator of this, Ryan gets all
that credit :-)

As for scripts to integrate it into the forum I am totally helpless
there, no idea how to do that.  But I would love the idea of helping
run this on the forum.

Also we should give Craig the option too, I mean he did revive BLD
competitions online after I stopped running mine, so he would probably
be very interested in this too.

Journeys for everything. Or maybe Roman room? What&#x27;s the difference? 
I&#x27;m using a mental house with ten rooms with ten locations each. 
What&#x27;s the name of that method?

I think that&#x27;s the Roman room method, but to be honest I don&#x27;t really <br>

just a journey through a room instead of outside.<br>

           Bernett is away on vacation. He asked me to reply on his behalf when I informed him over phone. He uses journey method only. You may be surprised to  know his method. He memorises 3 cycle in alternate locations of a journey for memorising centers. This alternate location method holds good for solving one center piece at a time.

Why not use z F2 M e M&#x27; e2 M e M&#x27; e2 F2 z&#x27; ??

Where M moves 3 layers and e moves a single layer. This is 10 moves 
in Chris&#x27; &quot;adjacent-axial-metric&quot; :-) This can also be re-written 
without cube turns, but i like this way ;-)

You cheapo. Ok, let me simply rewrite mine/Chris&#x27;s to this:
(S U2 S&#x27; m2)*2

Maybe not fully correct, don&#x27;t have a 5x5 here right now.

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,<br>
<br>
While we&#x27;re in the mood to think about moves, how about the U layer <br>
Z permutation of + centers?<br>
<br>
I recently have started using this alg:<br>
m s d s&#x27; d2 m&#x27; U2 m d2 s d&#x27; s&#x27; m&#x27; U2<br>
<br>
Again the lower case m and s means just the single center layer, <br>
same as we&#x27;ve been doing already.<br>
<br>
I even used this alg successfully on a blindfolded solve once too.  <br>
However I don&#x27;t like that it has so many single slice turns.  Those <br>
are a possible point to accidently pull two faces instead of just <br>
one.  Also if you are more careful to just turn the single layers, <br>
the d turns are a possible pop risk for ripping out that wing edge <br>
if you use too much force (my cube is somewhat loose and I&#x27;ve done <br>
this before).<br>
<br>
So far this is the shortest alg I can think of, but is there a way <br>
to do this same permutation without all the single slice turns?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll think about it too, but I thought it could be fun if we all put <br>
our minds to it.  I enjoy the way we throw around ideas to each <br>
other.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I just thought of this, maybe this would be something more comfortable 
to use:

r&#x27; e r U r&#x27; e&#x27; r U r&#x27; e r U&#x27; r&#x27; e&#x27; r U&#x27;

It&#x27;s 2 moves longer, and isn&#x27;t exactly a U layer Z, one of the pieces 
is now at feL, but still that type of move is fast.

I don&#x27;t have a cube on me, but later I&#x27;ll try out this alg and see how 
it feels.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris/Stefan!

If i get this right the following alg will do the same ... and yes 
it&#x27;s a commutator :-P

&lt;r&#x27; l&#x27; e2 r l , U>

The P part simply swaps 2 +-centers.

&lt;r&#x27; l&#x27; u2 r l , U>

does the Z-perm for x-centers.

These 2 algs are easy as hell ;-)

No wait, these are X-perms ... hahaha .. silly me ;-)

Ok, a real Z-perm for +-centers will go like this :

&lt;r&#x27; (Uu)&#x27; l&#x27; e2 l (Uu) r , (Uu)2>

Quite speed-friendly i would say. U can work the equivalent x-center 
version ursel(f)(ves) :D

Those algs do much more than swapping the required centers on the U-

Just ignore me ;-) I was reading too hastily through ur algorithms. 
I misread the latter as : m2 U m&#x27; u2 m2 u2 m U&#x27; m2 (P Q P&#x27; with P=m2 
U m&#x27;). Those 2 algs are sweet :-) Based on one of my favorite 5x5x5 
center algs : (r2 s2)*2 or (r2 e2)*2. I do something in between ... 
lol ...

Ok, but ur algs are still not perfect, because 6 inner pieces are 
affected. So on a super-supercube it&#x27;s not the thing to do :D

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I know the response to learning a memorization method has been<br>
different for different people.  I also know that the people at the<br>
top for blindfolded solving don&#x27;t seem to want to learn a really<br>
advanced memorization method.<br>
<br>
Well I finally finished learning the 278 images that make up half of<br>
what I will need to memorize a 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 cube blindfolded.  I can<br>
now use the alphabet letter pairs for AB-LK (132 images) for the 3x3x3<br>
permutations, which is a subset of these 278.  So I&#x27;m going to start<br>
using these images to memorize the 3x3 rather than natural memory.  My<br>
natural memory is not as fast as most, but I think with a trained<br>
technique that I can vastly improve my own memorization times.<br>
<br>
If I can improve my memorization noticably this way, will you top<br>
blindfolded solvers who just use rote/natural memory at least<br>
consider, that maybe learning a technique is better?  I&#x27;ve been saying<br>
that for months now, but hopefully now that I have the necessary<br>
method learned for 3x3 I will be able to back up what I have been<br>
saying.  My aim is to use this for the bigger cubes, that&#x27;s why I<br>
started in the first place.  But I want to start using it for the<br>
3x3x3 too.<br>
<br>
Hopefully it works.  I&#x27;m trying as hard as I can to convert you<br>
rote/natural memory people ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Ok so I&#x27;ve tried about 3-4 solves so far using my images instead of<br>
just rote memory.  So far I&#x27;m still excited about practicing this way<br>
of memorizing, but man this is hard.<br>
<br>
My first successful solve was 10 minutes including memorization, and I<br>
got one down to 6 minutes.  The problem I am getting is that it is<br>
hard to do process of elimination.  Say I get to one journey location<br>
but I&#x27;m not sure what image I put there.  If I&#x27;ve already solved 2<br>
pieces then I know there are 3 letters that can&#x27;t be part of this<br>
image.  Out of 12 letters then 9 remain, so I have to test 72 images<br>
to do process of elimination, which takes a long time, that happened<br>
on my 10 minute solve.<br>
<br>
I think once I am so familiar with my images that I immediately recall<br>
the image when thinking of the letters and vice versa that that<br>
problem will go away, but for now I am almost 3 times slower than my<br>
normal way.<br>
<br>
Still, I&#x27;m going to keep solving this way and try to work back up to<br>
my old times.<br>

I hope this method works, I have a lot of faith in it.  I&#x27;ll try to<br>

  I must confess that I don&#x27;t fully understand this method...and I don&#x27;t understand why you want to use it on the 3x3x3. I think that is the right way to go for the bigger ones, but...the 3x3x3 is so easy...the top people can memorise in less than a minute...and...well...I don&#x27;t if your system allows this times, but...
   
  oh, well
  let us know how it is going....maybe if is really good I can use it and try to beat Leyan ; )

          <div class="email-content">Hey Pedro,

I don&#x27;t take any offense at all, most everyone I&#x27;ve talked to has
given me almost the exact same response.

I just know that the world class memorizers don&#x27;t memorize anything
without a system.  Give them a string of even just 10 binary digits
and they don&#x27;t use rote memory, they have HUGE databases of images and
they apply an image to a very large group of digits.

If you take something as simple as 10 digit binary, and not a single
memory master uses rote memory to do it (the only ones who just
memorize it by rote, they would consider a beginner/intermediate for
binary numbers).

If 10 digit binary is easier than memorizing a 3x3x3 cube, why don&#x27;t
they use rote memory?  Because rote is slower than a system.  You say
that memorizing a 3x3x3 is so easy.  Well memorizing 10 binary digits
is 10 times easier I would say.  But they don&#x27;t use rote memory even
for that.

I&#x27;m a beginner memorizer by their standards, I mean really seriously a
beginner.  I say that because they practice memory stuff just as much
as we practice cubing.  I&#x27;m sure John Louis and J. Bernett can back me
up on this.  So much work goes into training your mind to be able to
do this so quickly.

And yet if I got down to 1:56.xx for the 3x3x3 BLD then what does that
say about BLD times?  Now I&#x27;m trying to be a bit provocative here.  If
I can get sub-2, and yet by memory master standards I am a beginner. 
What does that say about our memorization?

I know that most of you think memorizing a cube in under 20 seconds is
total fantasy.  I mean the top people can&#x27;t do it, and they&#x27;ve been
doing this for some time.  Clearly sub-20 memorization is a lie then
right?  Well for rote memory I absolutely agree, wholeheartedly.  But
what if you used a system?  Is it possible?  I don&#x27;t know, but I sure
think so.  That&#x27;s what I am trying to find out.

Let&#x27;s just say I find it interesting that for BLD cubing, everyone is
already content to just leave things as they are.  Yet for
speedsolving, people are always looking for new methods, new ways to
do things.  Take Roux solving, COLL, multislotting as examples.

Memorization is such a huge part of BLD solving.  Yet for BLD we are
content to not change anything about our memorization techniques. 
Everything is fine and perfect exactly the way it is.  The 3x3x3 is
&quot;so easy&quot; in your words.  Have we already discovered the best method
out there, and no matter how hard we look there is nothing better?

Hmmmmmm...

Can you define what you mean with &quot;rote memory&quot;? Cause I&#x27;m quite sure 
they&#x27;d use it (what *I* think it is) for this since it&#x27;s not even a 
third of short term memory. So no need to apply any journey or roman 
room method or something like that.

          <div class="email-content">I think you&#x27;d better differentiate between reading and memorizing. 
What you call a memorization system I call at best a reading system.

Imagine a child who can&#x27;t read yet sees this:
bicycle elephant lollipop

For the child that&#x27;s just 20+ symbols. Or even worse, an even much 
larger number of lines. But for you, it&#x27;s just three words which fit 
perfectly into your natural short term memory. Maybe the child has 
started to learn reading and can slowly, one by one, identify the 
letters and finally understand the words, too. But is this a memory 
technique? I dare to say no.

Similarly, the memory masters just *read* a 6-bit number while you&#x27;re 
the child who can&#x27;t read it yet cause you haven&#x27;t learned this yet (by 
rote/practice).

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, that&#x27;s about what I thought. I think 100 images for digits and 
64 for bits is somewhat the standard. That is, one image covers 2

large group of digits&quot;. Even with 1000 images each of them covers only 
3 digits or 9 bits.

          <div class="email-content">Hi all blindfold solvers,
        Yes, indeed, I use a system even to memorise 10 binary digits. I remember I mentioned here in this forum a year back that 3*3*3 can be memorised in just 20 secs, if you use a system and moreover the retention will also be longer.
        In my opinion David Orser is already using a memory system even much before we start discussing 3*3*3 bld memorisation in this forum. That is why his memorisation time is faster than others. Hope he will answer us.
        As I am already 46 years old, rote memory is impossible for me. I have to follow some memory system. I can not run as fast as you guys in your 20&#x27;s. Similarly, I can not memorise as fast as you guys.
        I think for bigger cubes a memory system is must for higher success rate.

  Hey Pedro,

I don&#x27;t take any offense at all, most everyone I&#x27;ve talked to has
given me almost the exact same response.

I just know that the world class memorizers don&#x27;t memorize anything
without a system.  Give them a string of even just 10 binary digits
and they don&#x27;t use rote memory, they have HUGE databases of images and
they apply an image to a very large group of digits.

If you take something as simple as 10 digit binary, and not a single
memory master uses rote memory to do it (the only ones who just
memorize it by rote, they would consider a beginner/intermediate for
binary numbers).

If 10 digit binary is easier than memorizing a 3x3x3 cube, why don&#x27;t
they use rote memory?  Because rote is slower than a system.  You say
that memorizing a 3x3x3 is so easy.  Well memorizing 10 binary digits
is 10 times easier I would say.  But they don&#x27;t use rote memory even
for that.

I&#x27;m a beginner memorizer by their standards, I mean really seriously a
beginner.  I say that because they practice memory stuff just as much
as we practice cubing.  I&#x27;m sure John Louis and J. Bernett can back me
up on this.  So much work goes into training your mind to be able to
do this so quickly.

And yet if I got down to 1:56.xx for the 3x3x3 BLD then what does that
say about BLD times?  Now I&#x27;m trying to be a bit provocative here.  If
I can get sub-2, and yet by memory master standards I am a beginner. 
What does that say about our memorization?

I know that most of you think memorizing a cube in under 20 seconds is
total fantasy.  I mean the top people can&#x27;t do it, and they&#x27;ve been
doing this for some time.  Clearly sub-20 memorization is a lie then
right?  Well for rote memory I absolutely agree, wholeheartedly.  But
what if you used a system?  Is it possible?  I don&#x27;t know, but I sure
think so.  That&#x27;s what I am trying to find out.

Let&#x27;s just say I find it interesting that for BLD cubing, everyone is
already content to just leave things as they are.  Yet for
speedsolving, people are always looking for new methods, new ways to
do things.  Take Roux solving, COLL, multislotting as examples.

Memorization is such a huge part of BLD solving.  Yet for BLD we are
content to not change anything about our memorization techniques. 
Everything is fine and perfect exactly the way it is.  The 3x3x3 is
&quot;so easy&quot; in your words.  Have we already discovered the best method
out there, and no matter how hard we look there is nothing better?

Hmmmmmm...

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hi John, Chris, whoever is interested,

I like using the journey and phonetic/major systems; they&#x27;re fun.    
In messages 952,1004, and 1014 I tried to describe how I use them for 
the cube.  My memorization times aren&#x27;t that good, but I think many 
others could average in the 15-20 sec range using such a mnemonic 
system. 

I&#x27;m really curious how others memorize the orientations, ie details 
of what you look at first, do you plan the moves out, etc.  It would 
be cool if the fast guys would share; we need more posts.

Chris, I&#x27;m always looking for new ideas and help, your posts are 
great, keep going.  Cool that you have generated all those images 
too.  I have standard images that I use, but for the cube, I decided 
to be flexible.  Ex.  85 12 is usually &#x27;foil-Dan&#x27;, but I usually end 
up using &quot;fall down&quot; and picture someone falling down.  I found that 
some of my words didn&#x27;t make good combos, so I just gave in and 
started making them up on the fly, more or less.  Still, I&#x27;m not sure 
if this is good, or faster, oh well.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dave,<br>
<br>
Great to hear from you!  Hope things are going well, both with your<br>
cubing and everything else.<br>
<br>
I just read your post, and I too have done something similar about<br>
changing the images sometimes.  With my old linked lists method one of<br>
my locations was Germany, but sometimes I would make that location a<br>
hospital (the implication being, you needed to be flown into Germany<br>
to see a specialist for some reason), and other weird things like that.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m trying to take my new images a bit more concretely, I&#x27;m trying my<br>
best not to change them, so that I can remember which one is which.  I<br>
don&#x27;t want a secondary image for some of them, when I already have a<br>
bunch to remember and decode already.  I may end up changing this the<br>
more I work with it though, this whole system is totally new to me.<br>
<br>
As for the image you suggested, what do you picture for &quot;fall down&quot;? <br>
I used to use verbs as well, and found them harder to work with than<br>
nouns, which is one reason I stopped using my linked lists approach (I<br>
had a lot of verbs).  I&#x27;m trying as hard as I can to not include any<br>
verbs as one of my images, and just have them be objects or people<br>
(such as comic book characters, or movie stars).<br>
<br>
For me 85 12 (I may use a different layout for my numbers than you do<br>
though) would be Kiln-Jeebs and I would probably picture a pottery<br>
kiln falling over on the guys Jeebs (the second hand pawn shop owner<br>
from the movie Men in Black) and his head doing that weird exploding<br>
thing it did in the movie.  I would have the slime from his head<br>
explosion hit whatever the object formed by the next two pieces is.<br>
<br>
So if it was 85 12 34 that would be Kiln-Jeebs-Fiddle and the slime<br>
from Jeebs head would hit a guy playing the fiddle.<br>
<br>
Not the most PC image of course, but it would be memorable heh heh.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure if using 3 images per location will work well for the<br>
3x3x3, I image it would with more practice, but again my focus is the<br>
4x4x4 and 5x5x5, where using 3 images per location would be hugely<br>
helpful.  I&#x27;ll probably use it for the 3x3x3 too, even if it isn&#x27;t the<br>
best approach for that cube, just for the experience of combining my<br>
images that way for practice for the bigger cubes.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s good to hear that you use memory systems, your memorization<br>
times have always really impressed me, and I am hoping that now that I<br>
am also using a system that maybe I can speed up from my, relatively,<br>
very slow times.<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
&gt; Chris, I&#x27;m always looking for new ideas and help, your posts are <br>
&gt; great, keep going.  Cool that you have generated all those images <br>

<br>
Yeah, I agree it&#x27;s best to use objects.  I only use a verb in certain <br>
cases with the cube.  For fall down, I just picture myself, falling <br>
down in the location, whatever it is.  If fall is the second pair, <br>
sometimes I picture the first pair falling from the sky.  But mostly <br>
I use two nouns interacting.  I use some people too, but now and then <br>
I get them confused because I don&#x27;t picture them well enough.  But <br>
often they work really well.   <br>
<br>
Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t gotten into the big cubes, the 3x is enough <br>
for me, but I always like to hear new ideas about memorizing or <br>
solving blind.  <br>
<br>
I&#x27;m too slow memorizing the edge and corner orientations.  I memorize <br>
the corner o&#x27;s last and solve them first, but they still give me <br>
trouble lots of times.  And I&#x27;d still like to hear more about how <br>
others memorize the o&#x27;s.  With the edge o&#x27;s, I sometimes backtrack, <br>
and take too much time.<br>

<br>
Memorizing 10 binary digits, while still easy, is still &quot;not easy to do <br>
in a rote manner&quot; in a small timeframe, which is why a system is still <br>
ultimately more efficient.  But of course we would probably not <br>
memorize big image systems for the sole purpose of memorizing 10 binary <br>
digits.  As you are well aware, the system takes time to integrate into <br>
your &quot;reflex memory&quot; but of course once it&#x27;s integrated, your <br>
memorization times will start dropping like crazy.  Although I really <br>
do recommend using a different system for the 3x3 than for the 5x5, <br>
since, for instance, if you were doing them in a relay, it may be <br>
difficult.  You want to minimize potential memory overlap as much as <br>
you can, and the huge image system is a bit much for the 3x3 and is <br>
probably best suited for the larger cubes.  It&#x27;s like using a battering <br>
ram to smash apart a small statue when really, all you need is a hammer.<br>
<br>
Rote memory is fast because it involves no memory transitions, but it&#x27;s <br>
weak, however not too far off from using basic memory systems devoid of <br>
that weakness.  Have you tried a solve using the Major system for the <br>
corners? Or the binary-conversion method for EO? Or journey-method <br>
stories for EP? Such things are quick and don&#x27;t require hundreds of <br>
images and will allow you to memorize the cube anywhere from 15-30 <br>
seconds with enough practice (the practice needed for this system is <br>
much smaller and so faster results come more quickly as well).  <br>
<br>
And so this leaves room for the image system for the 5x5 cube.  Using a <br>
smaller system for the 3x3 will put it on a different subconscious <br>
level than the 5x5 so you have little overlap.  Just my two cents.<br>

This is how I approach CO.  There&#x27;s an obvious downside if you don&#x27;t <br>
see these cases on the cube, which is my only real gripe with it.  I <br>
am still not sure how to optimize CO but this is what I use which <br>
seems to work the majority of the time and allows you to memorize it <br>
all quickly.  Let me know if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for EO, you can use the binary conversion method although over <br>
time it should become second nature (converting four edges per layer <br>
into one letter of the alpabet by associating the edges with 1, 2, 4, <br>
and 8 and using their sum as conversion by adding the values of the <br>
edges you wish to flip).  For instance, I might always associate <br>
seeing edges 1 and 3 flipped with the letter E (since edge 1 = 1, <br>
edge 3 = 4, 1 + 4 = 5, 5 = E), and so with practice you can quickly <br>
look at each layer and just extract three letters and make up a quick <br>
phrase using those letters.  I have found this approach to be really <br>
fast and I have a hard time thinking of an easier way to do EO.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,<br>
<br>
&gt; Chris:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Memorizing 10 binary digits, while still easy, is still &quot;not easy to do <br>

&gt; memorization times will start dropping like crazy.<br>
<br>
This is probably true, if you only wanted to memorize binary digits,<br>
then yes I agree you wouldn&#x27;t want to learn a huge system, but those<br>
who actually do use a huge system for binary digits tend to do very<br>
well.  I got my numbers wrong from before, in Ben Pridmore&#x27;s video on<br>
these pages http://memoryconsulting.com/videos.htm (scroll to the<br>
bottom) he mentions that he uses over 2000 images for speed cards, and<br>
1000 of those 2000 images for binary alone.<br>
<br>
I imagine a smaller subset of those 1000 is used for 10 digit binary,<br>
as opposed to, say, his 4000 digit binary attempt, but still it seems<br>
he would be able to use quite a lot.<br>
<br>
I also agree with Stefan that a memory expert who has practiced binary<br>
a lot can just read a 6 digit number and it have meaning, whereas most<br>
of us who don&#x27;t practice see 6 separate digits in binary, and not one<br>
unit.  So I think that also plays a huge role.<br>
<br>
&gt;  Although I really <br>
&gt; do recommend using a different system for the 3x3 than for the 5x5, <br>
&gt; since, for instance, if you were doing them in a relay, it may be <br>
&gt; difficult.  You want to minimize potential memory overlap as much as <br>
&gt; you can, and the huge image system is a bit much for the 3x3 and is <br>
&gt; probably best suited for the larger cubes.  It&#x27;s like using a battering <br>
&gt; ram to smash apart a small statue when really, all you need is a hammer.<br>
<br>
I use the same images for everything, but I use different journey<br>
locations to tell me which part of the cube is what.  So on the 5x5x5<br>
I&#x27;m working on using images for the central edges and corners too, but<br>
just in a different journey location.  I&#x27;ve already practiced this on<br>
the 3x3x3, and I&#x27;m REALLY slow at it, but again I&#x27;ve only done maybe 5<br>
solves with the new system so far, I think in time this will improve a<br>
lot.  I&#x27;m no 3x3x3 expert, so I just want it to improve well enough<br>
for me to comfortably use this approach on a 5x5x5 solve for the<br>
3x3x3-like pieces.  There is no real overlap, since if I do get that<br>
small chance that I see the same image, it&#x27;s in a different place so<br>
it doesn&#x27;t really mess me up very much.  I&#x27;ve already had this happen<br>
to me twice in my solving so far, and the repeat image is not a<br>
hinderance really, since I&#x27;ve put it in some other journey.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Rote memory is fast because it involves no memory transitions, but it&#x27;s <br>
&gt; weak, however not too far off from using basic memory systems devoid of <br>
&gt; that weakness.  Have you tried a solve using the Major system for the <br>
&gt; corners? Or the binary-conversion method for EO? Or journey-method <br>
&gt; stories for EP? Such things are quick and don&#x27;t require hundreds of <br>
&gt; images and will allow you to memorize the cube anywhere from 15-30 <br>
&gt; seconds with enough practice (the practice needed for this system is <br>
&gt; much smaller and so faster results come more quickly as well).  <br>
<br>
I&#x27;m a bit confused, the system I am using basically is the Major<br>
system.  However, instead of coming up with the words on the fly, I<br>
already have every possible combination of letters with a prepared<br>
image.  So if I see (QKECH)(FBGA)(IL) (the scramble on my 3x3 edges<br>
right now) I would put that in my journey as:<br>
<br>
1 st cycle) Queen-Ketchup-Chest of Drawers (A Queen poors ketchup all<br>
over a chest of drawers I used to own<br>
2nd cycle) Chris Farley - Bag(of money) - Dan Aykroyd (Chris Farley<br>
pushes a bankrobber with a huge bag of money over and the money spills<br>
everywhere.  Dan Aykroyd is swimming in the money.)<br>
3rd cycle) Island (I picture a small island with a palm tree)<br>
<br>
So I mean I don&#x27;t make a sentence, I tell a story with images more,<br>
but the translation time is less I would imagine.<br>
<br>
I can see how gramatically 1 sentence could contain the information of<br>
your entire cube, so in that respect the images are weaker.  I need a<br>
maximum of 10 journey locations to be able to contain the entire cube,<br>
which is probably more work than one sentence.  I&#x27;m hoping that having<br>
less translation time will help, but again I don&#x27;t know which is<br>
faster for the 3x3x3.  The 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 are really my main reason<br>
for doing this though, so in a sense it doesn&#x27;t matter to me as much<br>
which is faster for 3x3x3.  I want the best system for the bigger<br>
cubes, and I&#x27;ll use anything useful from that for the 3x3x3 so I don&#x27;t<br>
have to do any more work than I have to.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; And so this leaves room for the image system for the 5x5 cube.  Using a <br>
&gt; smaller system for the 3x3 will put it on a different subconscious <br>
&gt; level than the 5x5 so you have little overlap.  Just my two cents.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
I may try that one day, but for now I haven&#x27;t had any problems with<br>
using the same images for 5x5 or 3x3.  Also, because there are a large<br>
number of images I have a somewhat small chance of seeing the same<br>
image twice on the same attempt (relay, or whatever).  Also, even if I<br>
do get the same image, it&#x27;s not confusing it kind of helps, since<br>
you&#x27;ve already combined everything like that once somewhere else, so<br>
just recall the image again and put it in the new journey spot.<br>
<br>
---------<br>
<br>
Marcus I know you already get fantastic times for the cubes<br>
blindfolded, but I would recommend trying out something like this. <br>
Just watch those videos of Ben Pridmore using a system very, very<br>
similar to the one I am trying to learn and see how fast he memorizes<br>
a deck of cards.  It&#x27;s very awesome to watch, I certainly couldn&#x27;t<br>
memorize a 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 with that kind of speed with any of my old<br>
systems, so I figured I would just copy Ben straight up on his and<br>
give that a shot instead :-D<br>

Oh my God, how did you see that!?!  That was awesome!<br>
<br>
I want to go over it a few times again to really see how you came up<br>
with that, but I just have to say wow!  I like how you switch those<br>
two 3x1 edge groups in the middle.  Did this come from your M method<br>
for 3x3?  The moves seem similar from replacing two edges in the M<br>
method you came up with.<br>

[b2,L&#x27;UF&#x27;U&#x27;L]<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s such an awesome way to do two 2 swaps like that.  Stefan does<br>
this approach work for any other good cases for doing 2 swaps?<br>
<br>
I see how you do the slice turn b2.  Then you need to swap either UR<br>
to DL or vice versa.  Also you have to take another edge from either<br>
UB, BR, BL, DB, UF, FR, FL, FD and put it into the spot where you just<br>
moved a piece out of either DL or UR.<br>
<br>
Basically it looks to me that you did a slice move to change two edges<br>
(the other two are a side effect).  Call those edges A and B.  Then<br>
you cycle A to B&#x27;s spot, B to some place in holding somewhere, and<br>
some other edge not affected by the first slice turn to A&#x27;s old spot.<br>
   Then you undo the slice move, then you undo the sort of pseudo<br>
three cycle of those edge groups?<br>
<br>
Holy crap that&#x27;s cool!  Sorry, I just can&#x27;t get over that!  I&#x27;m going<br>
to have to mess around with this some more!<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S.  Here are the three algs I tried to figure yours out.<br>
<br>
As a test I looked at<br>
[b2,UF2U&#x27;]<br>
<br>
which isn&#x27;t a 2 swap, but is a cool way to do that type of edge 3 cycle.<br>
<br>
Then I tried:<br>
[b2,UDF2U&#x27;D&#x27;]<br>
which is a nice identity  but not useful :-)<br>
<br>
Then I did:<br>
[b2, D F D&#x27;] which is a 3 cycle commutator type I currently use.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s when I saw what you did with switching DL to UR (or it could go<br>
the other way too if you want) with the move L&#x27; U F&#x27; U&#x27; L<br>
<br>
P.P.S.  very cool alg!<br>

Sorry for the delayed response.

I liek both of the algs that you gave, Per I see how yours bases off
the [r l e2 r&#x27; l&#x27;, U2] alg.

Stefan, I like that one, I see how it is just using the [m2,f2] alg
too, I feel dumb for never having thought to try that.

Thanks for the help guys, I found both algs very useful.

Wow that video is awesome.  You can totally see how such a system <br>
would work... when he starts slapping down two cards at a time over <br>
and over again you just start constructing stories to go along with <br>
the associated images... pretty powerful indeed, lol.  And yes I <br>
agree with you and Stefan: After practicing something over and over <br>
again the steps become natural, where you can just look at something <br>
and instantly figure out its association.  Math might be one such <br>
example -- I&#x27;m sure you can spit out 6x8 without too much thought at <br>
all :D<br>
<br>
Ahh so your journey locations differ -- that is interesting and <br>
really effective.  And yes, it will be slow at first, but as you&#x27;ve <br>
implied (correctly) it will speed up once you become most accustomed <br>
to the method itself through practice.  I mean, Ben Pridmore&#x27;s system <br>
must have taken quite a long time.  It&#x27;s amazing how quickly you&#x27;re <br>
able to do well with your own memory system!<br>
<br>
The only downside with the story method for edges you described -- <br>
please tell me if I am mistaken but I am going from a past post of <br>
yours -- is that I wonder how much time is taken actually recalling <br>
the story before actions are taken.  I remember you trying &quot;visual <br>
memory&quot; as opposed to speaking in a sort of inner monologue and <br>
saving some time.  Do you find that a lot of the time is spent <br>
thinking of the story&#x27;s layout or is it not really an issue? Well, by <br>
all this I mainly speak of the 3x3.  I do use letters for the 5x5 <br>
because there are simply too many pieces to string together with <br>
images alone, but the 3x3 is just on the brink. By &quot;on the brink&quot; I <br>
mean probably feasible with a more short-term system, ie. it is easy <br>
for us to short-term-memorize &quot;101001&quot; but probably past that brink <br>
to memorize &quot;111000101010110101010010010110&quot; without a system. <br>
<br>
Good point on the bigger cubes though... your approach seems like it <br>
would be the strongest for memorizing such cubes. It would also work <br>
wonders for relays if you are into those.  I am a little jealous, <br>
haha -- but memorizing a huge system like that is daunting! <br>

Chris, this sounds really interesting. I am a little confused on some
parts. Would it be possible to give an example scramble, and what you
would memorize for 3x3.

Thanks

at <br>
&gt; all :D<br>
<br>
Yeah those videos of Ben totally blew my socks off, enough so that I <br>
decided to also use three images per location, and to use two pieces <br>
in the cycle per image.  I mean I guess a speed solve would be just <br>
as impressive to him as his memorizing is to us, but still it&#x27;s <br>
really amazing to see what his effort has achieved!<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Ahh so your journey locations differ -- that is interesting and <br>
&gt; really effective.  And yes, it will be slow at first, but as <br>

&gt; must have taken quite a long time.  It&#x27;s amazing how quickly <br>
you&#x27;re <br>
&gt; able to do well with your own memory system!<br>
<br>
Yeah, I imagine that the first famous person is the one walking my <br>
journey, so I can use that person in a later image if I am having <br>
trouble with just the two objects alone.  I don&#x27;t imagine any travel <br>
time between locations, just a sort of instant jump (some locations <br>
can, in physical space, be separated by several hundred feet).<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The only downside with the story method for edges you described -- <br>
&gt; please tell me if I am mistaken but I am going from a past post of <br>
&gt; yours -- is that I wonder how much time is taken actually <br>
recalling <br>
&gt; the story before actions are taken.  I remember you trying &quot;visual <br>
&gt; memory&quot; as opposed to speaking in a sort of inner monologue and <br>
&gt; saving some time.  Do you find that a lot of the time is spent <br>
&gt; thinking of the story&#x27;s layout or is it not really an issue? Well, <br>
by <br>
&gt; all this I mainly speak of the 3x3.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s a really good question, and one I hadn&#x27;t thought about much <br>
until just now.  With these images and these journeys it takes me a <br>
good bit longer to memorize (about twice as long as with my old <br>
approach), but I recall on average probably twice as fast, if not <br>
quicker.<br>
<br>
Actually now that I think about it, every time I&#x27;ve done a 4x4x4 <br>
solve with these images I memorize in about 10-12 minutes, and my <br>
overall solving lately ahs been 15-22.  With my old stuff I <br>
memorized in about 6-8 minutes and had the same overall range about <br>
(around 15 minutes or so).  So sometimes now I solve in 10 minutes <br>
(I don&#x27;t like a solve that slow), but I have definitely gotten a <br>
solve in 5-6 minutes a couple times too (using the new images).  For <br>
the 5x5x5 I lately have been memorizing in about 22-24 on average, <br>
and solving at 35-40 minutes total (so 11-18 min range I would <br>
guess).  11 is very, very good for me on 5x5x5, and 18 is ok but not <br>
great.<br>
<br>
I think once I am more comfortable with memorizing quickly, then I <br>
can take advantage of that and the quicker recall.<br>
<br>
For the 3x3x3 using these new images I definitely memorize very <br>
slowly and also recall very slowly this way.  I could memorize and <br>
recall much quicker just by using rote memory for the 3x3x3, but I <br>
am hoping that is because I&#x27;m not yet comfortable with using my <br>
images quickly.  Also, even when comparing my rote memory to you, <br>
Leyan, Tyson, etc. I seem to have a slower memory in general (or I <br>
don&#x27;t trust myself to go too fast or something).  I&#x27;ve wondered that <br>
maybe I prefer quantity of information over speed, because maybe my <br>
memory is just not that fast compared to you really fast guys.  Then <br>
again there is a limit there too, because the relay still scares me.<br>
<br>
&gt;  I do use letters for the 5x5 <br>
&gt; because there are simply too many pieces to string together with <br>
&gt; images alone, but the 3x3 is just on the brink. By &quot;on the brink&quot; <br>
I <br>
&gt; mean probably feasible with a more short-term system, ie. it is <br>
easy <br>
&gt; for us to short-term-memorize &quot;101001&quot; but probably past that <br>
brink <br>
&gt; to memorize &quot;111000101010110101010010010110&quot; without a system. <br>
<br>
The more I work with these images, the more I think that maybe a <br>
large system isn&#x27;t the best idea for the 3x3x3.  But then again, I <br>
know that memory experts use a lot of images with 10 digit binary, <br>
but still fewer than, say, 100 digit binary.  So maybe 132 images <br>
for the 3x3x3 is too many, but maybe images would still work well?  <br>
Again I won&#x27;t even begin to call myself a 3x3x3 BLD expert, I seem <br>
to do better at the larger cubes, again probably because maybe I <br>
have a preference for more stuff to memorize, rather than trying to <br>
memorize very quickly?  I don&#x27;t really know to be honest.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Good point on the bigger cubes though... your approach seems like <br>
it <br>
&gt; would be the strongest for memorizing such cubes. It would also <br>
work <br>
&gt; wonders for relays if you are into those.  I am a little jealous, <br>
&gt; haha -- but memorizing a huge system like that is daunting! <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; And yeah I know what you mean about Ben... memory systems in <br>
&gt; action :D I&#x27;m anxious to see how fast you can get with this system!<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
Yeah I really could not be more excited about how much this system <br>
is an improvement for memorizing the bigger cubes (compared to my <br>
old stuff at least).  I still don&#x27;t know if this is the best <br>
approach for the 3x3x3, I&#x27;ll keep at it and see, but maybe you guys <br>
really are right.  Maybe rote memory really can be super powerful <br>
for the 3x3x3.  Or maybe, even better, there is a way to combine say <br>
50 images with rote memory and do like the 10 digit binary.  About 6 <br>
digits are images, and the other 4 are super short term memory, <br>
reading them as Stefan put it.  Maybe the corners for the 3x3x3 <br>
could be done with images (56 needed to cover all cases of placing <br>
two pieces into one image).  Then the edge permutation could be pure <br>
rote memory.<br>
<br>
Perhaps an approach like that would fit the 3x3x3 better?<br>
<br>
Just throwing out ideas, what do you think?<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Chris, this sounds really interesting. I am a little confused on some<br>
&gt; parts. Would it be possible to give an example scramble, and what you<br>
&gt; would memorize for 3x3.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Thanks<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
Absolutely I can provide an example.<br>
<br>
Here is the scramble I used:<br>
L&#x27; R&#x27; B2 D2 U L&#x27; U B2 R2 B&#x27; D2 U L2 R&#x27; F2 D U2 F2 U L2 R&#x27; B&#x27; F&#x27; L R2<br>
<br>
I scrambled with the cube already in the same orientation that I solve <br>
it.<br>
<br>
I need 10 journey locations max (usually less, but just in case the <br>
maximum I need is 10) in order to memorize this cube.  So here is my <br>
journey first off:<br>
<br>
1) The entrance to my old neighborhood where I grew up.  It&#x27;s at the <br>
top of a very long steep hill.<br>
2) The bottom of that hill<br>
3) The first stop sign in my neighborhood<br>
4) The first speed bump (by a big tree)<br>
5) The second speed bump (by a row of parking spaces)<br>
6) The main office (where you pay your rent)<br>
7) The pool (near the main office)<br>
8) At my friend&#x27;s house past the pool<br>
9) At a dumpster beside the road<br>
10) At the speedbump to the entrance to my cul-de-sac<br>
<br>
So those are the places where my images will go.<br>
<br>
Now let&#x27;s look at the scramble.<br>
<br>
I start with edges, and I always start at UB.  UB is the letter Q for <br>
me, so I imagine a Queen with a crown and a long robe is the person <br>
walking my journey.<br>
<br>
Here is the first cycle: UB-&gt;DL-&gt;FL-&gt;UB<br>
In letters that is Q-&gt;G-&gt;C-&gt;Q<br>
<br>
So at the entrance to my neighborhood I imagine a Queen getting into <br>
the Best Buy Geek Squad car and driving towards the next location <br>
(GC=Geek Car).<br>
<br>
Now I look at UL (where I usually look next if the UB cycle ends <br>
early).  This cycle is UL-&gt;UF-&gt;UR-&gt;UL.  In letters that&#x27;s E-&gt;I-&gt;F.  So <br>
at the bottom of the hill I picture Carmen Electra standing to the <br>
left of the &quot;IF&quot; image.  This one is hard to point into words.  It&#x27;s <br>
the demon coming out of the jack in the box from the Sci-Fi channel <br>
bumper before the show (they always end with the IF tagline, sort of <br>
like &quot;what if?&quot;).  So she&#x27;s standing to the left of the Demon coming <br>
out of the jack in the box and getting scared.<br>
<br>
Ok so that cycle ended early too.  Next I&#x27;ll start at BL.  This cycle <br>
is BL-&gt;DB-&gt;BL.  So at the first stop sign in my neighborhood I imagine <br>
Dan Aykroyd standing to the left of Lindsay Lohan.  Dan is flirting <br>
with Lindsay, and she&#x27;s ignoring him.<br>
<br>
Ok so that cycle ended early too.  Next I look at FR.  This cycle is <br>
FR-&gt;DF-&gt;FR.  So at the first speedbump in my neighborhood I picture <br>
Johnny Depp standing to the left of Chris Katan.  Chris is dressed up <br>
to go clubbing like from &quot;Night at the Roxbury&quot; and is bumping against <br>
Johnny Depp trying to get him to dance, and Johnny Depp is weirded out <br>
by this.<br>
<br>
And that&#x27;s it for the edges, the other two are solved.<br>
<br>
Now I imagine what I call a &quot;blast door&quot;.  This is the separator that <br>
tells me the edge permutation is done.  I imagine a big steel blast <br>
door falls from the sky behind Chris Katan and Johnny Depp.  When I <br>
recall, I remember the blast door, which tells me the rest of the <br>
images are now corner information and not edges anymore.<br>
<br>
For the corners I start at UBL.  This cycle is UBL-&gt;UFR-&gt;DFL-&gt;UBL<br>
<br>
So at the second speedbump I picture Dan Aykroyd petting a Dog.  That <br>
ends that cycle so I start at DFR next.  This cycle is DFR-&gt;DBR-&gt;DBL-<br>
&gt;DFR.  So at the office to my neighborhood I picture Hitler riding a <br>
Ferris Wheel.<br>
<br>
And that&#x27;s it for the permutations.  I memorize the orientations by <br>
pure rote memory.  So after the permutations I am done with my <br>
journeys.  I had 10 prepared, but it only took 6 of the locations to <br>
memorize this cube, so I save the last 4 in this journey to be the <br>
first 4 locations in my next solve (I would start at the pool for the <br>
next solve and just continue on).<br>
<br>
This was a very atypical solve, because I place 3 images per location, <br>
but not a single cycle had more than 3 pieces.  I just grabbed the <br>
first scramble from Jaap&#x27;s scrambler, but if you want an example of a <br>
solve with a longer cycle let me know.  It&#x27;s the same idea but I <br>
imagine 3 images per location (from left to right) instead of just two.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,<br>
Chris<br>

Thanks so much for clearing up a things i was unsure of. It seems like
it could be really fast. As for these videos of ben pridmore, where
can I find them?

Marcus,

Thanks a lot for the tips.  I&#x27;m going to practice some with them and 
see how they work; I&#x27;ll let you know if I have questions.

Thanks,

Chris, 

Thanks for that example.  One thing I always had trouble with when 
trying to apply images to the cycles was to know when a cycle ends 
and where a new one starts.  I guess it&#x27;s a bit easier with the story 
method; my attempts were all just using objects, and it became too 
annoying, so I always gave up.  

Also too annoying were the cases where you end up with two pairs that 
need swapping.  But maybe it&#x27;s just because I was too used to Carr&#x27;s 
system.  It seems like I am the only/lonely one using that system?

I&#x27;m wondering:  when we say some guys are using rote memory for the 
perms, is that really accurate.  For ex. is remembering the shapes of 
cycles also a mnemonic system?  I don&#x27;t know; I guess that&#x27;s what the 
fast guys are doing, from the little I know about their methods.  

Just rambling,
-Dave O.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
For anyone following the stuff about using images, I am showing some<br>
improvement!<br>
<br>
I just did 2 solves on the 3x3x3.  The first one was 3:35.01 success<br>
and the second one was a 3:23.xx DNF (had two edges flipped at the end).<br>
<br>
I am getting much faster at using images, and have noticed that<br>
without thinking I have started putting one whole cycle at each<br>
journey location.<br>
<br>
I had 4 images at one location, which represented one whole edge cycle<br>
.  One image from the first solve I did was Michael Jordon pushing<br>
over the robot Sunny from the movie I Robot so that he landed on a<br>
miniature model of the white house, and the debri sprayed Chris Katan<br>
in the eyes.  That image represents a 6 cycle of edges.  I think this<br>
will be the way to go for using lots of images.  Just place one whole<br>
cycle at each location.  This will be easier than breaking up one<br>
cycle at different locations.  Or at least those are my thoughts right<br>
now, I could change that again.<br>
<br>
Recall was very fast for both of those solves, but memorization was<br>
slower than when I just remember the shapes of cycles.<br>
<br>
It seems that already I am solving at the roughly the same speed as<br>
normally, but memorization is what is adding the time.  Still, this is<br>
encouraging, the last solve I did before these two was about 6<br>
minutes, so I&#x27;m getting better!<br>
<br>
Those two solves were done drawing from my pool of 132 images (the<br>
largest needed for the 3x3x3 to have two objects per image).<br>

I just DNF&#x27;d a 5x5x5 solve, but the cool part is that I memorized it,<br>
comfortably, faster than I ever have a 5x5x5 before.  I was using my<br>
images, and memorized the cube in 13 minutes!  Now I did forget one<br>
journey location at the end of the solve (and I undid a setup move<br>

DNF).<br>

it to start solving after 13 minutes!  I can&#x27;t wait until I&#x27;ve used<br>

somewhere in the middle of memorizing edges at 13 minutes, and with<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ok there is no longer any doubt in my mind, for the larger cubes, this
large image base system is one of the best methods (and probably for
me, the best) there is.

I just DNFd another 5x5x5 solve (only a 3 cycle of centers away this
time!) using the new images.  I went slow for the memorization in
order to be careful, and memorized in 19 minutes.  I finished the
solve at 10 minutes (I believe that is the fastest I have ever solved
the 5x5x5 blindfolded, ignoring the DNF and just considering the time
taken to go through all of the memorized information).

I&#x27;m not even using the full system, I only know a little over half.  I
can&#x27;t wait until I know the rest.

The best part...  This 5x5x5 solve was the 6th solve I&#x27;ve done in a row.

The solves were
1) 4x4x4
2) 4x4x4
3) 3x3x3
4) 3x3x3
5) 5x5x5
6) 5x5x5

Literally all in a row.  The only breaks I took were to post the
messages on this group.

With my old system there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d ever be able to do this many
solves in a row like that, and still memorize quickly.

I still don&#x27;t know if this method will be best for the 3x3x3, but for
me it just can&#x27;t get any better for the larger cubes.  This method
rocks so much!!!

That is actually quite spooky!! With more practice u can memorise 
AND solve it in less than 20 minutes. Highly impressive !!! :D

Keep ut the work :-)

How about this one :

L2 f2 R&#x27; B f2 - (Rr)2 (Ff)2 U2 r2 U2 (Ff)2 (Rr)2 - f2 B&#x27; R f2 L2

Yah, seems longish but really it&#x27;s only a conjugated r2 only 8-move 
conjugation part at both ends ;-)


Have fun!

Or maybe :

R2 (Bb)2 R B b2 - (Rr)2 (Ff)2 U2 r2 U2 (Ff)2 (Rr)2 - b2 B&#x27; R&#x27; (Bb)2 
R2 is better?

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I just got a DNF on a 4x4x4 solve (ended with three corners flipped<br>
incorrectly, otherwise solved).<br>
<br>
However the cool part is that I memorized the centers in 1 minute 38<br>
seconds, and solved them successfully.  That&#x27;s my new record for<br>
fastest time to memorize the center permutation and still solve them<br>
successfully.  I was using my images and journeys to do this.<br>
<br>
At the beginning of the solve I was able to rotate the cube so that 9<br>
of the centers were already &quot;solved&quot;.  So I had to memorize a 15 piece<br>
permutation.  That works out to 6.5 seconds to memorize each piece on<br>
average.<br>
<br>
Seeing as how the card guys do 52 cards in, say, 40 seconds on a<br>
really really fast run, that&#x27;s 0.77 seconds per card, so I have a<br>
very, very long way to go to catch up to the pros.<br>
<br>
Still, this new method is already faster than my linked lists by about<br>
a minute.  So I&#x27;m happy!<br>
<br>
If anyone is following this about images and journeys, I couldn&#x27;t<br>
recommend them more for the bigger cubes.  I&#x27;ve already beaten all my<br>
memorization records using it, so give it a shot if you&#x27;re interested<br>
in the bigger cubes and are wondering how to memorize them!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey J. Bernett,

I think it&#x27;s interesting that you say I am an inspiration to you,
because you and John Louis have been huge inspirations to me!

Bernett, you already solve the bigger cubes blindfolded in very fast
times, especially considering your age!  I think in a few years I
won&#x27;t be able to compete with you, because you will have had so much
more training than me with memorization by then.  In a sense I&#x27;m only
trying to keep up by learning this new method!

Keep up your good work!  I am looking forward to US nationals, but I
am also looking forward to meeting you and John Louis one day (perhaps
in Hungary for the 2007 World Championships?).

Take care, and keep blindsolving.  You&#x27;re a very big inspiration to
me, even if you don&#x27;t realize it!

Chris

You are making my heart pump and adrenaline race, holy crap.  Your <br>
progress is very refreshing to hear.  It seems like such a powerful <br>
method.  I&#x27;d really like to try your approach but I am not sure how to <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus, absolutely I can give an example.<br>
<br>
Here is the scramble I used: F2 l d u b B&#x27; D&#x27; u2 F2 R&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27; u2 l2 f R<br>
r&#x27; U2 f d&#x27; U&#x27; F d&#x27; r2 B2 d2 F2 r&#x27; l D2 b R f2 u&#x27; r2 F2 l2 b B&#x27; u&#x27; l r&#x27;<br>
F&#x27; B D&#x27; d2 l2 b D2 R2 U L&#x27; f2 D2 R2 B&#x27; l R2 f&#x27; l2<br>
<br>
Scramble with the cube already in the orientation in which you will<br>
solve it.  Also, this alg is not a multislice alg, so any inner turn<br>
like r&#x27; do as (Rr)&#x27; R and not (Rr)&#x27;.<br>
<br>
I start by memorizing the X centers, then the + centers, then the wing<br>
edges, then for the 3x3x3 pieces I do rote memory stuff right now, but<br>
one day I&#x27;ll use journeys and images.  For this example I&#x27;ll use<br>
journeys for them too, since that is my eventual goal.<br>
<br>
I need two journeys to memorize this cube.  My journeys are 24<br>
locations long, and I don&#x27;t know enough images to be able to cram the<br>
whole cube into one journey, so I&#x27;ll use two here since that&#x27;s what I<br>
really do.<br>
<br>
The journey locations don&#x27;t matter.  I&#x27;ll just denote them with J1-2,<br>
J1-12, J2-4, etc.  So J2-4 means the second journey and in that<br>
journey location number 4.  J1-12 means journey number one, and<br>
location number 12.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that all that I am writing here is sort of an<br>
intermediate way to use these images.  Since I don&#x27;t know all of them<br>
yet, I can&#x27;t use them the way I am supposed to.  I&#x27;m supposed to use<br>
three images per journey location, which equates to 6 pieces in the<br>
cycle.  Since I don&#x27;t know some of the images I can only put one image<br>
per location if that image represents two pieces.  Also I can put two<br>
images at a location if those images each represent one piece.  I only<br>
do this when I don&#x27;t know that alphabet letter pair, and am forced to<br>
use one image per piece.<br>
<br>
Ok so I&#x27;ll write the cycle, then the letters, then the images, then<br>
the picture I see at the location.<br>

Orientations I do by rote memory, so I&#x27;m done memorizing with images<br>
at this point.  I now do CO and EO via rote, and start solving.<br>

<br>
Again this method is only an intermediate version of what I will be<br>
using once I know all the images.  Once I know all of them, I will put<br>
three images at every location (except when the cycle ends early of<br>
course) and each image will stand for 2 objects.  So one journey<br>
location will be as many as 6 pieces of my cycle, instead of here<br>
maximum 3 pieces.  I&#x27;m hoping that doing it this way will make it<br>
twice as fast as this intermediate method is, which is already<br>
noticeably faster than my old method.  So I&#x27;m hoping to be able to<br>
really improve my memorization for the bigger cubes (and the 3x3x3 too<br>
hopefully).<br>

Hope this helps, sorry this message is so terribly long,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Very awesome! Do you find the image system to be superior to PAO? PAO 
is what I use currently for the centers.  I can explain what memory 
hooks I&#x27;d use for this solve if you&#x27;d like.  I really like your 
system though... it seems like it has some real potential for speed, 
not only in memorization but in recall

          <div class="email-content">Again well done Mr/Dr.Chris Hardwick! Very good explaination ! Since you are using free cycling, your solving time is very fast. Moreover your hard work to learn this new method of memorising and above all your high confidence level put you far ahead of any other cuber. You are a play maker of cubing sport!!
   
  This is the method of memorising I have also been doing. But of course, you know, I fix only one image at each location, because I solve one piece at a time. So, I have maximum 92 locations for each cube. My naming of cubes also different.  I named edge pieces in my mother tonge -Tamil. 
  I learnt free cycling 2 months ago, but gave up practice as I went out for my vacation. Now, I have to restart. 
   
  Ron uncle has invited me and my dad to Dutch open-2006. We are trying our best to make it. Are you also going ? 
   
  Here is my humble opinion :- Your recording, retaining and recalling are perfect. If you improve your receiving technique, your memorisation time will come down from your 13 min to say 10 min or even below. Regarding missing out location, I too had the same promblem initially. But I overcame it with a technique and practice. You have 24 locations in every journey. Fix the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th and 24th locations of every journey in your permanent memory. When you memorise your true memory check if there are 3 informations between every fixed locations.Soon, It becomes a habit of your true memory. 
   
  3*3*3 memorisation :- For memorising binary digits convert them into  numbers
  say 000 = 0
        100 = 1
        110 = 2
        111 = 3
        001 = 4
        010 = 5
        011 = 6
        101 = 7
  In case your string of binary digits is 011, 101, 000 , then the number you have to remember is 670. If you use phonetic sound and its value it is a single word = CHeQueS. This transformation is again a matter of practice.
  Again, in my opinion, if you blindsolve by stefan&#x27;smethod, memorisation is faster and easier than that of orientation, permutation method.
   
  Keep blindsolving and inspire everyone!

          Hey Marcus, absolutely I can give an example.

Here is the scramble I used: F2 l d u b B&#x27; D&#x27; u2 F2 R&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27; u2 l2 f R
r&#x27; U2 f d&#x27; U&#x27; F d&#x27; r2 B2 d2 F2 r&#x27; l D2 b R f2 u&#x27; r2 F2 l2 b B&#x27; u&#x27; l r&#x27;
F&#x27; B D&#x27; d2 l2 b D2 R2 U L&#x27; f2 D2 R2 B&#x27; l R2 f&#x27; l2

Scramble with the cube already in the orientation in which you will
solve it. Also, this alg is not a multislice alg, so any inner turn
like r&#x27; do as (Rr)&#x27; R and not (Rr)&#x27;.

I start by memorizing the X centers, then the + centers, then the wing
edges, then for the 3x3x3 pieces I do rote memory stuff right now, but
one day I&#x27;ll use journeys and images. For this example I&#x27;ll use
journeys for them too, since that is my eventual goal.

I need two journeys to memorize this cube. My journeys are 24
locations long, and I don&#x27;t know enough images to be able to cram the
whole cube into one journey, so I&#x27;ll use two here since that&#x27;s what I
really do.

The journey locations don&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;ll just denote them with J1-2,
J1-12, J2-4, etc. So J2-4 means the second journey and in that
journey location number 4. J1-12 means journey number one, and
location number 12.

Keep in mind that all that I am writing here is sort of an
intermediate way to use these images. Since I don&#x27;t know all of them
yet, I can&#x27;t use them the way I am supposed to. I&#x27;m supposed to use
three images per journey location, which equates to 6 pieces in the
cycle. Since I don&#x27;t know some of the images I can only put one image
per location if that image represents two pieces. Also I can put two
images at a location if those images each represent one piece. I only
do this when I don&#x27;t know that alphabet letter pair, and am forced to
use one image per piece.

Ok so I&#x27;ll write the cycle, then the letters, then the images, then
the picture I see at the location.

----

Orientations I do by rote memory, so I&#x27;m done memorizing with images
at this point. I now do CO and EO via rote, and start solving.

------

Again this method is only an intermediate version of what I will be
using once I know all the images. Once I know all of them, I will put
three images at every location (except when the cycle ends early of
course) and each image will stand for 2 objects. So one journey
location will be as many as 6 pieces of my cycle, instead of here
maximum 3 pieces. I&#x27;m hoping that doing it this way will make it
twice as fast as this intermediate method is, which is already
noticeably faster than my old method. So I&#x27;m hoping to be able to
really improve my memorization for the bigger cubes (and the 3x3x3 too
hopefully).

Hope this helps, sorry this message is so terribly long,
Chris

<br>
I am just doing this solve by text here so I apologize for any <br>
errors, but it should be pretty clean.<br>
<br>
I have a chronologically-based PAO system since the cycles work in <br>
threes and so in order to avoid having syncronization issues due to <br>
always using a &quot;position 1&quot; piece of a cycle, I change the person <br>
based on the position within that given cycle.  I use the same image <br>
systems for both X centers and + centers (and wings) with the <br>
exception that the memory hooks made for the X centers are done so in <br>
the daylight, whereas the + center memory hooks are done in a darker <br>
setting.  For the wings, I imagine everything happening underwater.  <br>
This helps separate things in memory.  It&#x27;s all similar to your image <br>
method I think, but of course a little different.<br>
<br>
I denote the centers as being on a face U F L R B or D in position 1 <br>
2 3 or 4, counted off on each face by going left to right, top to <br>
bottom.  For example, luF is F1, ruF is F2, ldF is F3, and rdF is F4 <br>
for X centers.  Same rule applies for any given face.  The + centers <br>
are named in the same fashion.  <br>
<br>
For the central edges, I denote them as follows: <br>
<br>
1=UB<br>
2=UL<br>
3=UR<br>
4=UF<br>
5=FL<br>
6=BL<br>
7=BR<br>
8=FR<br>
9=DB<br>
10=DL<br>
11=DR<br>
12=DF<br>
<br>
For the wings, I traverse the cube in the same order as I do for the <br>
central edges, although this time I just associate two wings with <br>
letters of the alphabet.  So I denote lUB as A, rUB as B, etc, until <br>
I go all the way to rDF as X.<br>
<br>
And corner order I start with UFL as the first corner, UBL as the <br>
second, UBR as third, UFR as fourth, DFL as fifth, DBL as sixth, DBR <br>
as seventh, and DFR as eighth.  Corners 1-8 are associated with (in <br>
order) &quot;Begin,&quot; t, n, s, h, r, d, and l.<br>
<br>
Alrighty:<br>
<br>
<br>
Denoting the PAO letters for the X centers, we have:<br>
<br>
U1-U4 = A-D <br>
L1-L4 = E-H<br>
F1-F4 = I-L<br>
R1-R4 = M-P<br>
B1-B4 = Q-T<br>
D1-D4 = U-X<br>
<br>
Likewise applies for the + centers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now for the PAO system itself.  Since the longest possible cycle <br>
includes 4 pieces * 6 sides or 24 centers (either X or + centers), <br>
this means there would be a maximum of 12 center-permutation <br>
algorithms needed (where 11 algs would actively permute three centers <br>
at a time, and the 12th algorithm would deal with only two centers <br>
that need switching but of course it can be done with any old center <br>
of a common color to finish the tri-cycle).  Thus, 12 &quot;People&quot; are <br>
needed for PAO:<br>
<br>
1. Chuck Norris (because he&#x27;s badass) <br>
2. Batman<br>
3. Britney Spears (the pretty one)<br>
4. Bill Clinton<br>
5. Jim Carrey<br>
6. My ex-girlfriend <br>
7. Arnold Schwarzenegger<br>
8. James Earl Jones<br>
9. Jennifer Love Hewitt<br>
10. Cyclops (cartoon version)<br>
11. Bart Simpson<br>
12. God (a really hot, powerful one)<br>
<br>
<br>
I tried to space hot people roughly evenly throughout the P portion <br>
of PAO because it&#x27;s easier for me to remember sexually, ah, <br>
interesting things.  I like using this P system because it allows me <br>
to not only know how far into the cycle I am, but it allows for easy <br>
recollection since I am using different people.  In order to <br>
distinguish cycles and where things begin I simply take note of the <br>
start piece&#x27;s associated Object and keep it in mind.  It is similar <br>
to your Blast Door thing.<br>
<br>
Now for the A and O of PAO:<br>
<br>
A:N/a,Apple<br>
B:Balances, Burrito<br>
C:Cries, Cactus<br>
D:Drags, Donkey<br>
E:Electricutes, Egg<br>

  Subject: [blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube] An example and description of memorizing the 5x5x5 with images and journeys


  Hey Marcus, absolutely I can give an example.

  Here is the scramble I used: F2 l d u b B&#x27; D&#x27; u2 F2 R&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27; u2 l2 f R
  r&#x27; U2 f d&#x27; U&#x27; F d&#x27; r2 B2 d2 F2 r&#x27; l D2 b R f2 u&#x27; r2 F2 l2 b B&#x27; u&#x27; l r&#x27;
  F&#x27; B D&#x27; d2 l2 b D2 R2 U L&#x27; f2 D2 R2 B&#x27; l R2 f&#x27; l2

  Scramble with the cube already in the orientation in which you will
  solve it. Also, this alg is not a multislice alg, so any inner turn
  like r&#x27; do as (Rr)&#x27; R and not (Rr)&#x27;.

  I start by memorizing the X centers, then the + centers, then the wing
  edges, then for the 3x3x3 pieces I do rote memory stuff right now, but
  one day I&#x27;ll use journeys and images. For this example I&#x27;ll use
  journeys for them too, since that is my eventual goal.

  I need two journeys to memorize this cube. My journeys are 24
  locations long, and I don&#x27;t know enough images to be able to cram the
  whole cube into one journey, so I&#x27;ll use two here since that&#x27;s what I
  really do.

  The journey locations don&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;ll just denote them with J1-2,
  J1-12, J2-4, etc. So J2-4 means the second journey and in that
  journey location number 4. J1-12 means journey number one, and
  location number 12.

  Keep in mind that all that I am writing here is sort of an
  intermediate way to use these images. Since I don&#x27;t know all of them
  yet, I can&#x27;t use them the way I am supposed to. I&#x27;m supposed to use
  three images per journey location, which equates to 6 pieces in the
  cycle. Since I don&#x27;t know some of the images I can only put one image
  per location if that image represents two pieces. Also I can put two
  images at a location if those images each represent one piece. I only
  do this when I don&#x27;t know that alphabet letter pair, and am forced to
  use one image per piece.

  Ok so I&#x27;ll write the cycle, then the letters, then the images, then
  the picture I see at the location.

  Orientations I do by rote memory, so I&#x27;m done memorizing with images
  at this point. I now do CO and EO via rote, and start solving.

  ------

  Again this method is only an intermediate version of what I will be
  using once I know all the images. Once I know all of them, I will put
  three images at every location (except when the cycle ends early of
  course) and each image will stand for 2 objects. So one journey
  location will be as many as 6 pieces of my cycle, instead of here
  maximum 3 pieces. I&#x27;m hoping that doing it this way will make it
  twice as fast as this intermediate method is, which is already
  noticeably faster than my old method. So I&#x27;m hoping to be able to
  really improve my memorization for the bigger cubes (and the 3x3x3 too
  hopefully).

  Hope this helps, sorry this message is so terribly long,
  Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,

Thanks for the memorization description, I like the way you handled 
the difference piece types by having things happen at night, or 
under water, or just in the daytime!  Also some of those images are 
hilarious, I can easily see how you can memorize them quickly!

I also think it&#x27;s cool how you use your people to show that it&#x27;s a 
different 3-cycle, and memorize the start piece to the whole cycle 
beforehand.

As for which method is faster, I really don&#x27;t know.  I think they 
both can be very fast.

I know that I have heard of a number of people putting one image per 
location, and that representing one object to be memorized.  J. 
Bernett I remember you saying in your post about 2 messages ago that 
you do this, and I&#x27;ve heard of people from the memory sports group 
also saying that they use it.

For me I am not very fast at getting the images into my head.  I 
tried doing one image per location, but I guess my encoding step 
(Bernett, I&#x27;ll use your term here) is significantly slower than my 
recall.  That&#x27;s why I wanted to use a method that put so much 
information into one journey location.  I may be slow at encoding, 
so I might as well cram a whole crap load of information into one 
image to make up for that.  The downside is that I have a lot of 
prep work to do, and a lot of practice work to maintain very quick 
recall on my images whenever I see any alphabet letter pair.

Marcus, it seems to me that you have very quick encoding already, so 
maybe this PAO method would be much better for you.  I tried a PAO 
system for a short time for the 4x4x4 and found that I could not 
come up with good ways to combine the verbs and the objects.  
Sometimes it fit very easily, but other times I struggled.  You seem 
to be very familiar with how your verbs and people and objects 
combine, and also your way of changing the scenery into night, or 
underwater, to recognize piece type.  I would say if it works, train 
it until it becomes reflex, and turn it into a science.

I guess I don&#x27;t really think one of these methods is better than the 
other, because there is so much variety in how people memorize.

For me, I need to cram a crapload of information into one image (as 
much as I can) because I can&#x27;t seem to speed up my encoding.  It 
seems I am taking 6.5 seconds per piece on average to memorize a 
cube.  That&#x27;s like memorizing a deck of cards in 5 minutes 38 
seconds.  Considering that a time under 2 minutes is considered very 
good and a time under 1 minute world class, I have a long way to go 
to improve my memory.

That&#x27;s why I wanted a method that had so many images, to overcome my 
encoding step.  My recall is much faster than my memorizing, and 
I&#x27;ve even had times on the 4x4x4 where my memorizination was much 
slower than normal (14 minutes or so) but I was still about to solve 
in 5-6 minutes and get an overall time near 20 minutes.

I say if your method works, train it until it becomes reflex.  I 
don&#x27;t think a very large image base is required for a fast 
memorization, but I think it helps a lot.  It takes the burden off 
your mind being fast, and makes it easy for you to still have slower 
steps, but just do things very efficiently and still go quickly.

Just my thoughts, what do you think?  The more I think about it the 
more I think there is no fastest method, but there is a &quot;fastest&quot; 
method for each person and how their brain works.  Maybe I&#x27;m just 
babbling and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about, but that&#x27;s how I 
view it right now.  I just have seen too much variety in how people 
memorize to think that there is a best method.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Bernett,<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Again well done Mr/Dr.Chris Hardwick! Very good explaination ! <br>
Since you are using free cycling, your solving time is very fast. <br>
Moreover your hard work to learn this new method of memorising and <br>
above all your high confidence level put you far ahead of any other <br>
cuber. You are a play maker of cubing sport!!<br>
&gt;    <br>
<br>
Thanks for the kind words.  I am definitely hoping to help show <br>
people that using a technique can be fast, even if only for the <br>
bigger cubes.  I know you and Stefan, and Marcus too I think, have <br>
been using journey methods much longer than I have.  So I certainly <br>
am not a pioneer here.  I just wanted to help take the image part of <br>
the journeys to a new level for BLD cubing, or what I hope is a new <br>
level at least.  Maybe it has already been done, but I hope to at <br>
least be one of the people trying to do this.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;   This is the method of memorising I have also been doing. But of <br>
course, you know, I fix only one image at each location, because I <br>
solve one piece at a time. So, I have maximum 92 locations for each <br>
cube. My naming of cubes also different.  I named edge pieces in my <br>
mother tonge -Tamil. <br>
&gt;   I learnt free cycling 2 months ago, but gave up practice as I <br>
went out for my vacation. Now, I have to restart. <br>
<br>
That&#x27;s cool, it seems that you also memorize just one image per <br>
locaton, and one image there.  I think my receiving (or encoding, <br>
whichever word means the actual memorizing) is not as fast as <br>
yours.  I have tried to memorize one piece per location before, but <br>
was not able to do it very quickly.  Also I tended to forget the <br>
images near the beginning of my journey at the start of a 5x5x5 BLD <br>
solve when I memorized that way.  I know that this technique is <br>
fairly popular though, I&#x27;ve heard of people from the memory sports <br>
group also using this and memorizing speed cards in very fast <br>
times.  If it works, I say stick with it and turn it into reflex!<br>
<br>
&gt;    <br>
&gt;   Ron uncle has invited me and my dad to Dutch open-2006. We are <br>
trying our best to make it. Are you also going ? <br>
<br>
I wish I could go, but I am really broke right now.  I&#x27;m having a <br>
bit of a time just saving up money for the US nationals this year.  <br>
Once I get a stable career job and a good salary I hope to save some <br>
money and make a competition in Europe every now and then, that <br>
would be awesome!<br>
<br>
&gt;    <br>
&gt;   Here is my humble opinion :- Your recording, retaining and <br>
recalling are perfect. If you improve your receiving technique, your <br>
memorisation time will come down from your 13 min to say 10 min or <br>
even below. Regarding missing out location, I too had the same <br>
promblem initially. But I overcame it with a technique and practice. <br>
You have 24 locations in every journey. Fix the 4th, 8th, 12th, <br>
16th, 20th and 24th locations of every journey in your permanent <br>
memory. When you memorise your true memory check if there are 3 <br>
informations between every fixed locations.Soon, It becomes a habit <br>
of your true memory. <br>
<br>
Yeah I see what you mean about receiving.  I notice that I tend to <br>
picture the image(s) at the journey location for several seconds <br>
before I have them memorized.  Watching Ben Pridmore&#x27;s video of how <br>
quickly he goes through 6 cards (one journey location for him) I <br>
just can&#x27;t get over his speed!  I don&#x27;t memorize locations nearly <br>
that quickly!  Is there a way to speed up that part of memorizing?  <br>
Or does it just come with practice?<br>
<br>
&gt;    <br>
&gt;   3*3*3 memorisation :- For memorising binary digits convert them <br>
into  numbers<br>
&gt;   say 000 = 0<br>
&gt;         100 = 1<br>
&gt;         110 = 2<br>
&gt;         111 = 3<br>
&gt;         001 = 4<br>
&gt;         010 = 5<br>
&gt;         011 = 6<br>
&gt;         101 = 7<br>
&gt;   In case your string of binary digits is 011, 101, 000 , then the <br>
number you have to remember is 670. If you use phonetic sound and <br>
its value it is a single word = CHeQueS. This transformation is <br>
again a matter of practice.<br>
<br>
I have been wanting to learn the phonetic sounds that go with the <br>
numbers, but I have been too lazy too lately to be honest.  I&#x27;ve <br>
just been wanting to learn these images.  I&#x27;d like to be using 3 <br>
images per location by the time the US nationals gets here, and I <br>
have 184 images left to learn, plus I need time to get used to using <br>
3 images per location, which I haven&#x27;t done before.<br>
<br>
&gt;   Again, in my opinion, if you blindsolve by stefan&#x27;smethod, <br>
memorisation is faster and easier than that of orientation, <br>
permutation method.<br>
<br>
I think that&#x27;s true, especially for the 3x3x3.  I am just so used to <br>
freestyle cycling, and I love the method so much, that I think I am <br>
stuck.  I think both methods are fast, Stefan and I proved that by <br>
our 4x4x4 edges races, but I think I like freestyle cycling too much <br>
to switch.  I hope to overcome the harder memory stuff though.  For <br>
the 5x5x5 I would lose times on the EO and CO because I do them by <br>
rote, but I am hoping to make up for that with faster centers and <br>
edges.<br>
<br>
&gt;    <br>
&gt;   Keep blindsolving and inspire everyone!<br>
&gt;   J.Bernett Orlando<br>
<br>
Same to you!  You&#x27;ve already helped inspire me to try blindsolving, <br>
and try to get better at it!  Keep practicing!  You have a natural <br>
talent for memory, and with just a little practice you could be <br>
getting amazingly fast times on the bigger cubes!  Your times are <br>
already very fast, but I think with your memory that they could be <br>
much faster!<br>
<br>
Take care, and happy cubing!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Chris,<br>
<br>
The hardest part of any memorization method is the encoding-to-<br>
reality portion.  That is, looking at a part of the cube and <br>
thinking &quot;This represents a can of beer&quot; or something.  But the <br>
images you use should be close to you such that it&#x27;s easy to recall.  <br>
For instance, after making my PAO list, I already had it memorized <br>
because the verbs/objects I used were simply the first things that <br>
came to mind that were easy to remember (I mean, for instance, come <br>
on what&#x27;s the dirtiest F verb you can think of? That sort of thing <br>
takes no practice to remember, lol).<br>
<br>
And yes having a lot of information can be a good thing in terms of <br>
ensuring minimal errors in decoding because there&#x27;s a lot of data <br>
there to help you.  With practice this will become quicker for you so <br>
I would not worry so much about this approach at all!<br>
<br>
As for PAO, it is easier for me simply because there are already many <br>
associations of information bound to the things in these lists.  For <br>
instance, if you&#x27;re in the nighttime cycle of things and you&#x27;re on <br>
Bill Clinton, you might automatically get an image of Clinton in the <br>
Oval Office at nighttime, coupled with whatever verbs and objects you <br>
want that are relevant.  There is still a lot of information there to <br>
help you remember, and you can just recall the verbs and objects <br>
necessary.  Changing the scenery is useful in my opinion because it <br>
adds a new level of interaction to the memory hooks.<br>
<br>
If you want a rough idea of time needed to memorize: At the fastest <br>
it takes maybe 4 seconds to memorize a story for 3 centers, but <br>
sometimes longer if I have to think to remember what objects/letters <br>
are associated with a piece (this part is the hardest for me because <br>
there&#x27;s no easy way around it -- you just have to rotely memorize <br>
which centers/edges/etc are what letters and be able to train this <br>
into reflex).<br>
<br>
You are not babbling in your last paragraph! I think it is spot-on.  <br>
We have variety in our methods because as humans we have different <br>
thought processes.  I can already tell your method is going to be <br>
really good for you once you get the image system down -- if you&#x27;re <br>
comfortable with a given approach you should definitely stick to it.  <br>
You&#x27;re already getting great times and they can only get better! It&#x27;s <br>
exciting :D<br>

No, nothing to do with my methods. The idea was just to put two edges 
to be swapped diagonally opposite in one inner slice so that 
doubletwisting that slice swaps the two edges. That&#x27;s why I use FR as 
setup moves and then the b2 swaps them.

Then I replace the two swapped edges with the other two. I just tried 
getting the old ones out of b2 with L&#x27; and U and saw that F&#x27; replaces 
them with the other two (this was pure luck). Then put those into b2 
with U&#x27; and L. And finish the commutator like usual.

Cheers!

Cheater. That affects 12 center pieces, doesn&#x27;t it?

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I finally completed my long term goal of the 3x3x3 memorization <br>
technique I&#x27;ve been learning.  The final product uses 188 images and <br>
consists of 132 for the edges and 56 for the corners.<br>
<br>
I letter the edges A-L and the corners M-T.  This means that I never <br>
have to do any sort of memory hook or blast door, or situation <br>
change or anything.  I will simply know that if I see any of the 56 <br>
images for corners, it can&#x27;t be an edge because only corners use <br>
images in the M-T range.<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t yet done any solves this way, because I literally finished <br>
learning those images today, and when I tested myself tonight I had <br>
fast recall on all the final ones for this 3x3 method.<br>
<br>
Again, I don&#x27;t know if this method will be faster than the standard <br>
way of memorizing, but I am sure excited to try it!  If nothing <br>
else, using images like this would make it much easier to try for a <br>
record number of 3x3x3&#x27;s memorized than my current approach.<br>
<br>
Anyway I just wanted to post on my progress.  I&#x27;m very happy to have <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve fallen in love.  I&#x27;ve only done 3 solves with my system finally<br>
completed to the way I want to do it, and already I love it.  I&#x27;m<br>
using 132 images for the edges (12*11 possible two letter<br>
combinations) and 56 completely different images for the corners (8*7<br>
possible two letter combinations).<br>
<br>
For those 3 solves I memorized each cube using on average 4 journey<br>
locations.  One of the solves I memorized a 7 cycle of edges in one<br>
journey location.  I had Michael Jordon introducing Cameron Diaz to a<br>
Gentleman in a suit, and when the man turned around to leave he<br>
stepped on a bee hive and was attacked by a swarm of bees.<br>
<br>
That encoded the cycle (UB UF BL DL UL BR DR) in one picture.<br>
<br>
I also had a 6 cycle of corners in one picture on that same solve.  I<br>
had Dan Marino exercising on a Nordic Track.  When he was done he got<br>
off and got into an above ground pool filled with spaghetti noodles to<br>
relax.  Donald Trump saw him, got mad at him for being lazy and fired<br>
him.  That was (UBL UBR DBR DFL UFR DFR).<br>
<br>
My fastest of the three solves was around 3:46.xx with memorization<br>
done at 2:47.xx so I still have a ways to go to speed up on the memory<br>
part, but I think it can be done with lots of practice.  Also to have<br>
done the solve part in about 1 minute (a little faster than average<br>
for me on the solving) is pretty cool!<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been finding that I tend to try to place one entire cycle into<br>
one journey location unless it&#x27;s really long, and then I break it up.<br>
 I think I will regularly try to put at most 8 pieces into one<br>
location, and break up larger cycles into 2 locations.  Or if the<br>
cycle ends earlier than 8 pieces obviously I move to another location<br>
for the next cycle.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts on this new (to me) way to memorize.  I certainly<br>
have absolutely no interest in ever using my old &quot;picture the shapes<br>
of the cycles inside the cube&quot; method ever again.  This new method<br>
just has me too excited!<br>
<br>
My rambling two cents,<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S.  Ben Pridmore has an image for every pair of 2 cards (52*51=2652<br>
images) and can manage them.  I was thinking that having an image for<br>
every single, pair, and triplet of edges and corners might be a good<br>
idea for REALLY fast times, and it would still be less than the number<br>
of images Ben uses.<br>
<br>
So you would have (12*11*10)+(12*11)+(12)=1464 images for the edges<br>
and (8*7*6)+(8*7)+(8)=400 images for corners.  1864 images is<br>
definitely less than Ben&#x27;s 2652, and he manages pretty well with his<br>
images set.  Maybe one day someone will learn the 1864 needed to<br>
really go crazy on the 3x3x3?  I&#x27;d kind of like to propose to Ben that<br>
idea, since he could just use a subset of his images to do this, and<br>
see what he thinks.  Maybe it&#x27;s not worth it, or it would be too much<br>
work for too little gain in time.  But since he&#x27;s already done the<br>
work I&#x27;d be curious in what he thinks.  Just more rambling thoughts<br>
here, if you read this far congrats lol.  I tend to babble a lot ;-)<br>

<br>
Scratch that idea actually.  I was thinking more about it, and that<br>
would involve placing three pieces into one image, which would mean<br>
having one image contain pieces from two different 3-cycles.  I<br>
already tried doing a method like that and it is very easy to get<br>
confused doing that.<br>
<br>
Now using it for Stefan&#x27;s method would probably work better.  Then<br>
each component letter would be one execution of an alg.  Correct me if<br>
I&#x27;m wrong but you would need 24 ways to differentiate edges.  So you<br>
could combine them into two pieces per image in 528 ways (24*22). <br>
There are 24 ways to differentiate corners, so you could have two<br>
corners in one image in 504 ways (24*21).  Did I do the math right<br>
there?  If so, that is a very exciting idea to be able to memorize<br>
like that!<br>
<br>
Wow, now that I think about it, I think using Stefan&#x27;s method would<br>
probably be much more conducive to a memory system than the<br>
traditional orient first.  You could encode more information very<br>
quickly, and you don&#x27;t have to do the orientations by rote memory, it<br>
is also part of the images.<br>
<br>
Wow..  I just might have become a convert to Stefan&#x27;s method.  The<br>
more I think about it, the more I think I agree with Stefan and J.<br>
Bernett.  I think his method is better for memorizing than orient first.<br>
<br>
Hmmmmm...  I want to mess around with this some more.<br>

I finally finished learning all 580 images for memorizing the 4x4x4<br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow....  I was too excited about this to wait, I had to post right now..<br>
<br>
I just got a DNF on a 4x4x4 BLD solve.  So that part wasn&#x27;t cool. <br>
Also the cube had two switched centers, which means I forgot a piece<br>
during the solving.  So that part wasn&#x27;t cool.<br>
<br>
What was cool was that I stopped the timer at 9 minutes 11 seconds!!!!!<br>
<br>
I went slow during memorization, and even had a delay on recalling one<br>
alphabet letter pair (one of my newest ones).  I still finished<br>
memorizing at 5 minutes 15 seconds.  I then did the recall and the<br>
entire solve (almost, it was a DNF by 2 pieces) in less than 4 minutes!!!!<br>
<br>
I placed three images at each location, and was able to memorize the<br>
entire 4x4x4 cube in 6 journey locations!<br>
<br>
This method is just ridiculous!  Boris Konrad told me once that he<br>
thought he could memorize the 4x4x4 in 3-4 minutes.  I think he<br>
underestimated the time.  I think it would be possible to memorize the<br>
whole cube in slightly under 3 minutes on a somewhat consistent basis.<br>
<br>
Oh wow....... I can&#x27;t believe how fast these images are!!!<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m so excited to continue practicing this method that my hands are<br>
shaking right now and it&#x27;s hard to type!<br>

I&#x27;m going to go do another solve right now!!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Bob,

What I am doing is to letter each piece on a 24 piece orbital of a
larger cube (wing edges, Xcenters, +centers) with a letter from A-X. 
This gives me 24*23=552 possible ways to combine two letters into an
alphabet letter pair.

So AB, CF, JR, MN, XD are all alphabet letter pairs.

When I have my cycle on the cube, I convert everything to letters, and
convert the pairs to images.

Which image goes with which letter pair is what I had to learn.  Over
the 552 there are 28 more images that I need.

So if I had the letters above in a cycle, then my cycle would be
(ABCFJRMNXD)

That becomes

(A) (BC) (FJ) (RM) (NX) (D)
which becomes

Dan Aykroyd rides a bicycle into a 6 foot tall fudge easter bunny. 
Then at my next location I imagine Dan jumping over a miniature model
of the Roman Coloseum, bumping into a player from the Knicks.  The
player falls into Johnny Depp and knocks him down.

So in two journey locations (basically two very short stories, or two
very large images) I can memorize a 10 cycle of edge pieces on the
4x4x4 say.

I could not recommend this method (or one similar to it) more!  I&#x27;ve
already broken my personal fastest 4x4x4 BLD solve  I also had a very
near miss sub-10 solve (only 2 centers switched).

As far as where I learned about the method, I bugged the guys at the
memory sports group with incessant question for a while, and a number
of them put their heads together and recommended this method to me. 
I&#x27;m thinking about putting it on my web page and explaining what I am
doing, because it really is amazingly fast!  Also it only took about a
month and a half to learn, which is really not that long.  The work
pays off basically.

How much of that cube was solved at start already? With 6 locations 
each holding 3 images each representing 2 letters each representing 
one cubie, you represented 36 cubies. The 4x4 has 56 (visible) cubies, 
so were about 20 already solved right at the start? That sounds veeery 
lucky.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

I just used Netcube to come up with the scramble, I don&#x27;t think it was
much luckier than average, but I do remember it having very nice centers.

I still don&#x27;t use journey locations for the corners, I just do them by
rote, or &quot;picture the shapes of the cycles&quot; if that&#x27;s the official
name.  I want to switch over to using images for them, but I&#x27;m still
slower at using images than by &quot;shapes of cycles&quot; for them, so I don&#x27;t
use them yet.

I might have placed 8 pieces into one journey location.  Sometimes I
will put an 8 cycle into one location as 4 images if the whole cycle
is 8 pieces long.

I partially remember the solve, let me see how much I can put together.

1) Dan Aykroyd sees a model on a beach chair (some other object), 5 pieces
2) Evanescence band members, a famous person, the stargate (5 pieces)
3) George W. Bush eating a bowl of Kix cereal, then Chuck Norris kicks
the bowl out from under him (WKXN so 4 pieces).
*BLAST DOOR*
That&#x27;s 14 centers unsolved, so 10 solved already.  That is a little
uncommon to have that many, but it&#x27;s definitely happened to me a
number of times before.  I&#x27;d say I average around 8 solved on most
solves, so 2 more than normal on this one.

4) I don&#x27;t remember this location at all but it would have had to have
had 5 pieces for me to not start the next cycle with a famous person
and instead with a letter pair.
5) The big bad wolf huffs and blows an Ox, the smell drifts over to
the Evanescence band members (HFOXEV so 6 pieces)
6) I don&#x27;t remember this location at all.  I might have put 8 pieces
here as 4 images, but I don&#x27;t know.

Yeah that doesn&#x27;t sound right to me either.  I think 6 locations would
be either incredibly lucky, or would have to have 10 centers already
solved as well as 5 edges.  I know my solve didn&#x27;t have 5 edges
solved, so I imagine I would have used 7 locations and placed only 6
pieces in the 6th location and not 8.  That would have given me up to
a 23 cycle of edges using a 7th location.

I apologize, I thought I had used 6 locations, but I agree that would
be a lucky solve most likely, so I imagine I had to have used 7. 
Other than having a nice centers setup the solve didn&#x27;t feel
particularly easy.

P.S.  I&#x27;ve been working with the images more today.  I got one solve
in 13 minutes and one in 15 minutes.  I still have slow recall of what
image goes with some letter pairs, but I&#x27;m working on it.  Also having
lots of cycles on the edges messes me up.  If I were to have a 23
cycle of edges I could memorize that much faster than a combination of
three 8 cycles.  I think with more practice that shouldn&#x27;t mess me up
much, but a longer cycle is still much easier to memorize for me right
now.

Yeah, ok... but anyway, even 7 locations sounds great. A 3x3 takes me 
around 11-12 locations.

Maybe I&#x27;ll should try the 4x4, too. Right now I&#x27;m focusing on 
multi-3x3s, I&#x27;m close to Dave&#x27;s five cube record time...

Cheers!

Marcus, I know you&#x27;ve already done sub-8, I don&#x27;t remember if you said<br>
it was lucky or not, but I can easily see how these images can get<br>
sub-8 with a lot of practice.  I already had one solve where I<br>

during the solve was able to trace the mistake, so I have finally<br>
equalled Boris Konrad&#x27;s prediction of correctly memorizing the 4x4 in<br>

          <div class="email-content">For 3x3x3 cube relays I would strongly advise against PAO unless you 
know the system like the back of your hand -- otherwise you will be 
accurate but with a slower time.  I think just using your normal 
system only slower would be more prudent -- the larger image systems 
are more appropriate for the larger cubes.  I have a video of me on 
Google Video doing a three-cube relay blindfolded if you&#x27;d like to 
see what I mean (those solves were done using the normal blindfolding 
method CO/CP/EO/EP only memorized slower than normal to ensure higher 
degrees of accuracy).  The times you posted though are excellent! The 
better systems you use + practice = lower times, which you have 
certainly seen for yourself!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Richard,

That&#x27;s awesome!  Congrats on the new PB times!

Did you do anything different for the multiple cube attempt, or just
memorize slowly and carefully?

Also, for the higher order cubes, I can post my PAO stuff here if you
need information for the higher letters (M-X).  I still have it
written down, and you&#x27;re welcome to it if it would help.  Also Marcus
posted his PAO stuff in an earlier message too, so that would be two
lists to look at.

You&#x27;ve already done half the work with a PAO system for A-L, so don&#x27;t
think of it as a lot of work.  Just think of it as you&#x27;re halfway
there already :-D

Keep it up on the BLD stuff man!

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Wow.  Ok I&#x27;m a bit humbled to be honest.  I&#x27;ve been using my letter<br>
pair images on the 3x3x3 for a while now, and I&#x27;m finding that it is<br>
incredibly difficult to go quickly.<br>
<br>
I letter the edges from A-L and the corners from M-T and place three<br>
images per location.  Each image is a letter pair and represents two<br>
pieces in the cycle.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m finding that very often I will see a 3 cycle, and &quot;read&quot; it.  I<br>
think it&#x27;s like Stefan described how a binary expert could probably<br>
read 6 binary digits and have it be a meaningful piece of information,<br>
rather than 6 random binary digits.<br>
<br>
I find that I sort of already memorize the 3 pieces in the cycle by<br>
&quot;reading&quot; it.  This confuses me and makes it hard to then still go<br>
ahead and convert those pieces to their letters and then to their<br>
images and then place them in the journey.  It&#x27;s like my brain is<br>
saying &quot;what are you doing?  I already have those three memorized!&quot;<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m really very seriously starting to think that these images might<br>
not be the best approach to the 3x3x3.  Or maybe I need to use them in<br>
a different way.  Or maybe they are not good for the orient first<br>
method.  Either way, 3 images per location and each image representing<br>
a letter pair or two pieces seems to not be the optimal approach.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve thought about using images and journeys for the edges, and rote<br>
for the corners.  Then switching the next solve.  I haven&#x27;t tried that<br>
yet, but it&#x27;s on my list.<br>
<br>
Either way, I admit defeat on the 3x3x3.  I just can&#x27;t figure out how<br>
to apply these images to the 3x3x3 in a fast way.  I&#x27;ve thought about<br>
using these images for Stefan&#x27;s method too, since I could give each<br>
edge two letters depending on it&#x27;s flip, and each corner 3 letters<br>
depending on it&#x27;s flip.<br>
<br>
So if I see the UBL corner goes to UFR and also has to flip clockwise<br>
that could be the letter L.  The same corner having to flip counter<br>
clockwise could be K, and with no flip could be J.  I think this might<br>
be a good way to use the images, but I still need to try it.<br>
<br>
Then I could also use two letter per image the same way.  This would<br>
be nice because I wouldn&#x27;t have to memorize the flips of edges or<br>
corners by rote anymore.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have yet to try this because to be honest I&#x27;m really bad at<br>
Stefan&#x27;s method.  I&#x27;m going to start practicing with it though.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m completely lost as to how to adapt this method quickly to the<br>
orient first method.  My only thought is that if I do this for 3 years<br>
I will be so quick at reading the letters off the pieces, and<br>
converting to images and I would know my journeys like the back of my<br>
hand.<br>
<br>
I think the only way to make the images fast for the 3x3x3 is to be so<br>
comfortable with the method that you can do it without thinking<br>
through any of the steps.  I would guess maybe 6 months of practice to<br>
get to the times that Leyan and Tyson are putting up, maybe.<br>
<br>
As for the bigger cubes though, I think these images are close to an<br>
ideal method for memorizing with the free cycling method.  I can&#x27;t<br>
really think of any improvements to it, other than little tricks like<br>
placing 4 images in a location if it completes the cycle, rather than<br>
having only one image at the next journey location.<br>
<br>
Anyway, like I said above I admit defeat for the 3x3x3 BLD.  I think<br>
you just need a natural gift at memory to do it quickly.  I&#x27;ll keep<br>
trying to use this system for it, and if things start improving I&#x27;ll<br>
post.  As far as things go now, I&#x27;m really on the border and am<br>
leaning more towards not using the system for the 3x3x3.  I still need<br>
to think about ways to fix it for the 3x3x3 though.<br>
<br>
One last thing I&#x27;ve thought about is to ditch the journeys entirely,<br>
and just memorize the images in a sort of void.  I could imagine them<br>
all strong out from left to right, or in a story the way I used to use<br>
my linked lists for the centers of a larger cube.  I think maybe<br>
getting rid of the journey, and just using a &quot;void&quot; might make things<br>
go more quickly.<br>
<br>
Just some ideas, anyone else have any thoughts on this?  Dave I know<br>
you use a system for the 3x3x3.  Marcus, same with you, and Richard I<br>
know you are using one.  What do you guys think about a more detailed<br>
system vs. &quot;reading&quot;?  The thing that is hardest for me is to try to<br>
memorize a short 2-cycle or 3-cycle via images, when I have already<br>
&quot;read&quot; it and remembered it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hehe again, using that big image system is just overkill for the <br>
smaller cubes.  I tried it myself but to no avail -- I strongly <br>
recommend sticking to a simpler, more direct method for the 3x3x3 and <br>
2x2x2 cubes.  4x4x4 is where the higher-order systems kick in and <br>
begin to become useful. Think of it like a compression algorithm: <br>
They tend to work better for larger chunks of data.  Using it for <br>
smaller pieces of data tends to be not very optimal for any regard.<br>
<br>
You don&#x27;t have to do rote for the corners though -- the Major system <br>
works just fine and is very quick and effective.  CO... that is <br>
something that, for now, has to be done rote unless letters were <br>
associated with certain CO cases but I haven&#x27;t really looked into <br>
this yet.  As I said before for the 3x3, using the big systems will <br>
slow you down even though they are accurate.  You are better off <br>
using a system that allows for quicker decoding since there are so <br>
fewer pieces.<br>
<br>
(How does Stefan&#x27;s method truly work? I understand the point of the <br>
buffer but I don&#x27;t know how you go about memorizing the cube? The <br>
only reason I haven&#x27;t done this method is because I don&#x27;t fully <br>
understand it yet).<br>

As for getting low 3x3 times it&#x27;s really a matter of reflex.  For <br>
instance, you can just glance around at the corner order and just <br>
pick up the letters as you go without really thinking, and then you <br>
spend a second or two making up a phrase with it, and then you move <br>
on to the next memory item.  It&#x27;s quick, easy, and doesn&#x27;t require <br>
hundreds of images to decode.<br>
<br>
&quot;As for the bigger cubes though, I think these images are close to an<br>
ideal method for memorizing with the free cycling method. I can&#x27;t<br>
really think of any improvements to it, other than little tricks like<br>
placing 4 images in a location if it completes the cycle, rather than<br>
having only one image at the next journey location.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yep images are probably the best for the bigger cubes simply because <br>
they are beyond a degree of using rote-approaches comfortably.<br>
<br>
Have you tried using static markers for points in a journey to <br>
intermix with your images? This would eliminate the need for a void.  <br>
For instance if, say, Will Smith is in an image you might know it&#x27;s <br>
the 6th iteration within a cycle.  <br>
<br>
The system I use for the 5x5x5 I posted in that earlier message and <br>
it&#x27;s all I do, really -- not much more to it than that.  For the <br>
3x3x3 I&#x27;ve begun to memorize CO last because then it&#x27;s easy to take a <br>
quick &quot;mental snapshot&quot; of the cube.  Look at a scrambled cube and <br>
just CLOSEYOUREYESANDTHINKREALFAST and you will be able to picture <br>
the corners briefly -- just solve them out before you start second-<br>
guessing your memory.  CP, use Major.  EO, use Binary system.  EP, <br>
use a little story to link images together where the images are <br>
derived from the cycle shapes.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,

Good points, yeah I think for a single solve that this method is
definitely overkill.

I was thinking over it some more though, I think for attempts at
multiple 3x3x3&#x27;s that maybe a method like this could be pretty good.

A lot of the images at each location are funny, or weird, and are
definitely memorable.  So I think it would be possible to hold onto a
lot of information this way.

I guess I should specify that I was trying to adapt the letter pairs
to going very quickly on a single solve, but I wonder if maybe that
isn&#x27;t the best idea.

I think for multiple cubes, that using letter pairs would be more
helpful than using them for a single solve.

Just my thoughts, I want to try the major system a little for the
pieces.  The only problem is that if I see AHBGDECF I would have a
hard time coming up with a sentence because I would immediately think
(Air Hockey, Borg, Dentist, Coffee) because of the letter pairs. 
Maybe a funny image in a void of an Air hockey table, the puck flies
off and hits a borg drone in the head, he turns around, hitting a
nearby dentist in the head with his longer arm, and the dentist spills
his coffee into his patient&#x27;s mouth.

I mean it&#x27;s not really a sentence, but that&#x27;s my point.  Given that
cycle on the 3x3x3 I would have to fight through seeing the air hockey
table, with the borg and the dentist and a cup of coffee.

Maybe something like &quot;AH!  BORG DENTISTS drink COFFEE.&quot;  And I would
use each word from my letter pairs as a word in the sentence?  I mean
I&#x27;m just guessing here, does that seem like it would work?

I kind of like the Major/letter pair hybrid idea.  I might give that a
shot, that sounds really interesting.  It&#x27;s sort of like using
language memory rather than images.  Though I could picture a borg
drone in a white doctor&#x27;s coat with a cup of coffee in his hand.  The
&quot;AH!&quot; would just be remember verbally.

Wow, ok I really want to try this now, I&#x27;ll write back on how it goes.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus, and all,<br>
<br>
I just tried doing a solve with the major method and also letter pairs.<br>
<br>
Here is what I had:<br>
<br>
I got the solve in 3:55.46 successfully.<br>
<br>
The cycles I had were:<br>
Edges: (UB UF DB UL) (UR DF FL DL BL BR FR)<br>
Corners: (UBR UFR DBL UFL DFR DBR)<br>
<br>
And the orientations I did by rote memory at the end, so that part is<br>
not really interesting.<br>
<br>
My letters given those cycles are:<br>
Edges: (JILE)(FKCGABD)<br>
Corners: (NPQOTR)<br>
<br>
The words are:<br>
Edges: (Jitters Leopard) (Fork Cog Abacus Johnny Depp)<br>
Corners: (North Pole GO (game) Bear Trap)<br>
<br>
and the sentences:<br>
Edges: JITTERS (nickname of a friend from high school) is riding a<br>
LEOPARD.  Stick a FORK in a COG and you get an ABACUS, says JOHNNY DEPP.<br>
Corners: When in the NORTH POLE don&#x27;t play GO near BEAR TRAPS.<br>
<br>
The sentences are longer, which maybe is to my disadvantage, but the<br>
words are all one unit.  North Pole is NP to me, I don&#x27;t have to<br>
remember which part of the phrase goes with which letters.  So even<br>
though the sentences are longer, I can decode the phrases very quickly.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t like that the sentences are so long, but maybe it could be<br>
worth it.  I&#x27;ll try this some more.<br>
<br>
Marcus, what would your Major sentence be here?  I&#x27;m just curious of<br>
other ways to combine the letters.<br>

Also on the &quot;to do&quot; list is to learn the remaining CO

          <div class="email-content">I advise against using vowels in the Major system.  The whole 
strength behind it is stripping vowels from sentences and using the 
remaining letters as your guide, kind of like words on license 
plates, if you will.

I may change my system a bit because sometimes I still get funky 
combinations that don&#x27;t really work well, but in your case:
Corners: (UBR UFR DBL UFL DFR DBR)

Becomes

Corners: (Begin l d n s r)

When I see this I see &quot;Load Noser&quot; or &quot;Laden Sir&quot; or &quot;Lead No Sore&quot; 
etc.  Any of these, when stripping away the vowels, leaves the 
relevant letters behind.  You don&#x27;t really have to account for Corner 
1 in the memory hook unless it is already solved, in which case you 
can just remember this rotely because it isn&#x27;t hard to do.

you&#x27;re really making some progress.  I think you&#x27;ve found your best

you to recall a memory hook and execute the right moves to solve a

commutator method and it works REALLY nicely (I used to use a 
swapping algorithm but ungh).  Sometimes it is hard to figure out the 
moves needed but with practice it&#x27;s become a lot easier.

Again congratulations!! That is quite the achievement indeed :D

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,

thanks about the solve, I&#x27;m glad to finally have met a long term goal!
 Also thanks for the inspiration with your crazy fast times!

As far as the time I take to apply the cycles I did a stop start solve
to find out, because I didn&#x27;t know off the top of my head.  I
memorized just the centers on a scrambled cube, then solved just them.
 I also did the same for the edges on a different scramble (so that I
would be memorizing on a scrambled cube to mimic the regular way).

Here were the scrambles and the times:
Centers:
b2 F2 D&#x27; d2 F&#x27; f l2 B D b F&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; u b2 D2 b2 F2 U B b r f l R U L F&#x27;
R2 r U L u D L d2 L2 B2 b u

Memorize: 1:30-1:35ish
Overall time, including memorization: 3:06.28

I had 6 cycles to perform in that solve.  I did just the solve part in
roughly 1:30, so I take about 15 seconds to both recall and execute
each cycle for the centers.

And for the edges:
r2 L&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; B2 f d&#x27; D l&#x27; L u2 L&#x27; f&#x27; R d&#x27; D F2 r L F2 r b r&#x27; U&#x27; b2 L2
F2 B&#x27; r&#x27; D2 B&#x27; R r F2 U D&#x27; b2 L2 U2 f&#x27;

Memorize: 3:05ish
overall time, including memorization: 4:50.56

I had 10 cycles to do in that solve, including using two 3-cycles to
solve a two swap.  So I took approximately 10.5-11.0 seconds on
average to both recall and execute each cycle.

I don&#x27;t know if that helps much, but that&#x27;s about as accurate as I can
get in terms of how long I take to do each cycle.  Of course not all
are 15 seconds for centers or 11 for edges.  Sometimes I might recall
almost instantly (less than 1 second) and do the cycle in maybe 5-6
seconds.  Sometimes it takes me several seconds just to recall my
image, and other times the cycle is just a hard one to do.  But
average it out I guess and you get 10-15 seconds overall.  This is the
first time I&#x27;ve done this, but the solves felt fairly normal.  I was
solving more slowly and carefully rather than &quot;break neck&quot; speed.

Hope this helps,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Wow that is a fast solving time for centers -- for me it&#x27;s usually <br>
anywhere from 14-20 seconds for a given cycle, but it&#x27;s mainly because <br>
my cube locks up easily so it works better in the long run to solve <br>
slowly for the commutators. This is all just my own speculation though -<br>

Recall is usually pretty fast, it&#x27;s just figuring out the commutators <br>

commutators <br>
&gt; that take some effort.<br>
<br>
Yeah I know what you mean.  That will speed up over time though.  <br>
Basically I took Tyson and Leyan&#x27;s advice to just always setup each <br>
position the same way.  You sacrifice the tiniest bit of efficiency <br>
to gain some speed on average.<br>
<br>
Here is an example.<br>
<br>
Say I have the cycle lbU-&gt;dfR-&gt;lbD<br>
<br>
As setup move I would do D2 r2 turning the cycle into lbU-&gt;dfR-&gt;rbU<br>
<br>
If I had the cycle lbU-&gt;dfR-&gt;lfD I would still do the setup D2 r2, <br>
which makes the cycle lbU-&gt;dfR-&gt;rfU<br>
<br>
Basically I try to always do double turns as setup turns, and only <br>
use single turns when I am forced to.  This way I never have to <br>
think about where is the best place to put the center from the D <br>
layer that I am setting up into the U layer, I just always use the <br>
double turn setup moves if they are an option.  So when I run into <br>
this type of situation and I see that I have to setup a piece from <br>
the D layer into the U layer, I look to see if I can already make <br>
the inner layer turn that places it.  If not I try to use only <br>
double turn setup turns.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s just all about doing the same situations the same way every <br>
time, so that each time you run into that situation you can solve it <br>
quickly.  The setup turns might not be the most efficient, but your <br>
time taken to setup each situation is minimal, because you don&#x27;t <br>
have to think to figure out which cycle to use, you just act once <br>
you know where all three pieces are.<br>
<br>
I know that I used to take double the time I&#x27;m taking now, maybe <br>
more, especially on the edges.  Over time though, you notice you&#x27;re <br>
always solving the same situations the same way, so each time you <br>
see that situation again, you can just confidently move at full <br>
speed to solve it, and know it will work because you always do it <br>
that way for that situation.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts, but yeah that will speed up with practice.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Edges are a bit easier... I don&#x27;t use freestyle commutators but <br>
rather <br>
&gt; arrange them in a certain position and perform a cycle alg on them.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
Also, freestyle commutators are much faster for the edges than for <br>
the centers.  This is because you&#x27;re most likely to use outer face <br>
turns, whereas for the centers you use inner turns a good bit more <br>
than for edges.<br>
<br>
Just food for thought, if you like your method then stick with it, <br>
but I would highly recommend trying freestyle cycling for the edges <br>
too, just because it&#x27;s the same idea (even the same types of <br>
commutators very often), but it goes more smoothly since you can <br>
usually use more face turns.<br>

I memorized in 4:40-4:50, I don&#x27;t remember the exact time. So the
solve took about the same amount of time, maybe 4:40ish.

I&#x27;m so happy!!! These new images are so amazingly awesome!

Before the 9:26 I had also gotten a 10:12 successfully, and decided to
just go all out and try for sub-10 since I was so close. I had very
loud music playing, and was wearing my earmuffs (that&#x27;s the only way I
practice now), so this wasn&#x27;t done in silence either.

I can still remember the images for memorizing the cube, in case
anyone is interested.

centers:
1) Jim Carrey sits on a unicycle, then sub-zero freezes him and pushes
him over and he shatters like glass.
2) Johnny Depp pushes a vending machine over onto one of those 3D
jigsaw puzzles, and it explodes sending pieces everywhere
3) Malcolm X holds a picket sign, and Boba Fett tries to shoot at him
with a blaster. An Ogre behind Boba Fett crushes him with a big club.
(over all 17 centers unsolved at the start)

edges:
1) A Queen ask Worm-Tongue (from lord of the rings) for a cube. He
steals Ryan Patricio&#x27;s cube mid-solve and hands it to her.
2) the MC from RWC2005 looks into the barrel of a tank, but a giant
combination lock falls onto the tank rocking the gun barrel up at the
last second to shoot harmlessly into the air.
3) Michael Jordon shakes Jeordy La Forge&#x27;s (from star trek) hand. 
Jeordy then sits down in a sail boat.
4) There is a bonfire, and a gradute from college throws his hat in. 
Then Neo from the Matrix round house kicks the graduate into the fire.
(he was about to turn into an agent) Behind Neo Richard Pryor sets
himself on fire, just because.
(23 edges unsolved at the start)

The corners were: (UBL UBR DBR DFR UFL UFR DFL)

and I don&#x27;t remember the flips, but I had 5 corners twisted is all I
remember.

Oh wow!!!!! I&#x27;m so excited! Now that I&#x27;ve gotten sub-10 I want to
work more on my accuracy. I&#x27;ve been going EXTREMELY fast on purpose
just to get a fast time. I&#x27;ve had quite a few DNFs doing this though.
Now I just want to go slow and easy, and get used to being very
accurate with these images to be ready for a competition.

Marcus, I know you&#x27;ve already gotten sub-10, but still I am very happy
to be in the club!

Yay!!!!

:-D

Chris,

Congrats on your amazing 4x times, really great.  I&#x27;m having a hard 
time keeping up with all your posts ;).  I&#x27;m no help on the 4x since 
I don&#x27;t do it, but it seems like your images are doing great.

With the 3x, I found -for me- sticking objects in locations in a 
journey, using major, works pretty well.  I started by doing linking 
in a story, but gave that up for my current way.  

The problem I had/have with using images/journeys with the cycles is 
that you get different amounts of images in locations; this makes it 
hard to recall where cycles end and start, at least for me.  

Corner o&#x27;s are still a pain, always looking for a better way.

-Dave

<br>
Hey Dave,<br>
<br>
have you tried using special images only for the start and stop of a<br>
cycle?  I have single letter images, which means that they are only<br>
ever used to show me that it is either the start or finish of a cycle.<br>
<br>
My images are:<br>
A: Dan Aykroyd<br>
B: Orlando Bloom<br>
C: Jim Carrey<br>
D: Johnny Depp<br>
E: Carmen Electra<br>
F: Chris Farley<br>
G: Tom Green<br>
H: Adolf Hitler<br>
I: Eddy Izzard<br>
J: Michael Jordon<br>
K: Chris Katan<br>
L: Lindsay Lohan<br>
M: Dan Marino<br>
N: Chuck Norris<br>
O: Ozzy Osbourne<br>
P: Richard Pryor<br>
Q: Queen (generic)<br>
R: Denise Richards<br>
S: Will Smith<br>
T: Donald Trump<br>
U: Uma Thurman<br>
V: Jean Claude van Damme<br>
W: George W. Bush<br>
X: Malcolm X<br>
<br>
Anytime I see one of those images I know for a fact that that it is a<br>
new cycle boundary.  So I never have to do any extra work to denote<br>
cycle boundaries, I can just tell if I see one of my single letter<br>
images, I know that a cycle boundary has been reached.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s how.  At the start of my solve I have a single letter image,<br>
since I am starting my first cycle.<br>
<br>
If at any point later in the journey I see two single letter images<br>
next to each other, the only possible way to have that is that my<br>
first cycle was an odd cycle, and the first single letter image is the<br>
end of the first cycle.  The second single letter image is the<br>
beginning of the new cycle.<br>
<br>
If at some point in the journey I only see one single letter image,<br>
that means the first cycle was an even cycle, and the single letter<br>
image denotes the start of the next one.<br>
<br>
I combine all 2 cycles into one image, and I remember it&#x27;s a 2-cycle<br>
by having the image within curtains, sort of like it&#x27;s in a voting<br>
booth.  So keeping that in mind the only possible numbers of<br>
conseuctive single letter images are just 1 lone one, and 2<br>
consecutive ones.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve already tried this, but I found that it makes<br>
differentiating multiple cycles on the 4x4x4 edges very easy,<br>
especially during recall.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,<br>
Chris<br>

          <div class="email-content">Typically I don&#x27;t reply to my own posts, but I&#x27;ve had
a chance to practice the alphabet pair images as
applied to edge permutation.

About 20% of the time I have to consult my image list,
other than that I&#x27;m somewhat comfortable with its
entirety.

This system absolutely trumps the PAO method as far as
I&#x27;m concerned.  There is one thing I&#x27;m doing and I&#x27;m
not sure how &quot;correct&quot; it is.

With a surprising amount of fluidity I&#x27;m able to group
all of a cycle into one location by stringing images
together.  

I won&#x27;t be able to judge its help to my memorization
time until I get completely comfortable with the
images, but I can already see the faster pace in
execution.

On a seperate issue I&#x27;ve been entertaining different
ideas for bld relay. 

After completing my CO method I will always orient
corners in 2 steps w/ max 2 setup turns (U or D
restricted)

Somehow I want memorization for CO and setup turns to
be memorized into images;  I&#x27;m definitely against
memorizing the setup turns as rote memory.

As far as EO goes, for relay I think I&#x27;d prefer to
memorize as binary for each cube.  With the help of my
alphabet pair images I should be able to memorize EO
in 3 or less images per cube.  If I expanded on the
alphabet pair images a bit I could always memorize EO
in 2 or less images, but I don&#x27;t want to bite off more
than I can chew.

I think that each step should be memorized for all
cubes at once.  So that you would memorize all of EP
for x cubes, all of CP for x cubes, and so on.  This
is just my 2 cents but I think it should keep me in
the proper mindset all throughout a distinct portion
of solving.

          <div class="email-content">As far as relays are concerned, I think it is easier to memorize all 
steps for one cube before moving onto the next.  Ie. one thing you 
can do is memorize CP EO EP for cube1, then cube2, etc, then at the 
end memorize CO, and then don a blindfold and fix CO on all the cubes 
to get it out of the way since it&#x27;s the most rote.  The problem with 
splitting memorization is that it&#x27;s real easy to forget which memory 
hooks went with which cube.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve found one problem with using images to memorize the centers, and<br>
that is that I often have no clue which pieces I&#x27;ve already cycled to<br>
on any given face.  I remember Stefan saying that he had also had some<br>
trouble with this on the 5x5x5.<br>
<br>
With my linked lists method, this was not a problem at all, because<br>
each face was split up into categories, and I would just search my<br>
story for the most recent element of that category.  For the images<br>
though this doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  If I am searching to see if I&#x27;ve<br>
used &quot;F&quot; already, I have 46 possible ways I could have used it. <br>
Either F can start the pair F_ or it can end it _F.<br>
<br>
Anyway I have found a solution that I like, and Stefan forgive me if<br>
this is something you already do, but here was my idea.<br>
<br>
What I do is to hold the cube at all times with 5 fingers only.  I<br>
always just mentally remember which piece I have to cycle to next on<br>
the U face.  I then use my right hand ring finger placed on the last<br>
place I&#x27;ve cycled to on the D face.  I use my right hand thumb to hold<br>
the sticker of the last place I&#x27;ve cycled to on F.  I use my right<br>
hand index or middle finger to hold the place I&#x27;ve last cycled to on R.<br>
<br>
For the L face I use my left thumb to hold the last place I&#x27;ve cycled<br>
to.  For the B face I use my left hand index or middle finger.<br>
<br>
It is sometimes awkward to hold the cube this way, but it helps so<br>
incredibly much for remembering which piece comes up next on each face.<br>
<br>
I imagine it looks weird to do it also, but it is effective.  I&#x27;ve had<br>
fewer DNFs since I started using this for the 4x4 and 5x5, and I plan<br>
on using it in the future.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know if this is something that you 4x4ers and 5x5ers have<br>
already figured out.  This problem was new to me because using linked<br>
lists completely eliminated it for me.  Now that I don&#x27;t have that<br>
luxury though, I need a better way and I like this one so far.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t mean to be redundant if this has already been mentioned, I<br>
just couldn&#x27;t remember if it was.<br>

          <div class="email-content">If you use PAO for the centers it becomes pretty easy to memorize 
them.  Near the beginning of memorization obviously your pieces are 
going to be near the &quot;top,&quot; and near the end, near the &quot;bottom.&quot; If 
you&#x27;re unclear what piece you&#x27;re now on (say, is the next white piece 
in this cycle L2 or L3?) look at each piece and its respective AO 
counterparts and quickly think, &quot;Have I used this already?&quot; ie. if L2 
is associated with Peanut Butter or Pound, and you know you have a 
memory hook of James Dean Licking Peanut Butter, then it must be L3.

Does this make sense?

<br>
For anyone interested here is my complete image list.  I had<br>
originally used 580 images, which was made up of 24*23=552 letter<br>
pairs plus 24 single letter images, and then also plus 4 double letter<br>
pairs.  I found a way to handle the situations where I had used the<br>
double pair images without using double letter pairs.  So the final<br>
count is 576 total.<br>
<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/memorizing.html<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m going to add to this page to describe a little bit how I use those<br>
images, but for now there is the list at least.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I finally tried using center blocks on a 4x4x4 BLD solve using these <br>
images.  What I do to remember that it is a center block cycle is <br>
that at the end of the center cycles I have at my next location a <br>
particular image to let me know what follows is a center block.  The <br>
image I use is the cartoon character of &quot;Rubik, the amazing cube&quot;.  <br>
Then what follows are the images that show which letter blocks I <br>
need to move.<br>
<br>
I letter the blocks in this pattern:<br>
lbU+rbU: A<br>
lbU+lfU: B<br>
rbU+rfU: C<br>
lfU+rfU: D<br>
<br>
and I follow the same pattern on the other 6 faces.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the reason center blocks are so nice, is that in terms of <br>
moves needed per center piece solved it is actually better to create <br>
center blocks than to cycle the pieces individually if the blocks <br>
are mostly built.<br>
<br>
The reason I am posting, is that I just did my first 4x4x4 BLD solve <br>
using center blocks with images, and I got it successfully in <br>
9:14.15, my new PB solve!!  I think using center blocks will be what <br>
helps me get sub-9 minutes for a single solve.  I can easily see how <br>
having a nice center block potential for them, and easy corners <br>
could get me there.<br>
<br>
So anyway, I&#x27;m excited to be moving closer to sub-8 (my new goal for <br>
a PB solve).  For anyone considering using PAO or letter pair images <br>
for the edges, I think it would be worth it to find a way to <br>
memorize center blocks.  This is because in terms of the solving <br>
phase, center blocks give a better ratio of number of moves per <br>
piece solved.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I&#x27;m really excited to be improving my memorizing, and <br>
adapting it to the freestyle cycling method.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll post my method on that page that lists my images soon, for <br>
anyone interested.  I&#x27;ll try to show how I memorize, rather than the <br>
solving part, since I&#x27;ve already done a tutorial on the <br>
rubiks.has.it forum for solving.  I may combine it all onto one <br>
page, sort of as a big cubes BLD how to for freestyle cycling and <br>
letter pair memorizing.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I just wanted to post, because I felt using center blocks <br>
are important enough to try to include in any method, just because <br>
it is such a powerful trick to use.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it, and <br>
are interested in the bigger cubes BLD, I really recommend it!<br>
<br>
Happy BLD&#x27;ing all,<br>

Did I say that? That I have some trouble with this? If I did, I&#x27;m 
sorry. It&#x27;s not true. I have *massive* trouble with this.

Yeah, now imagine doing that for 1-2 hours (for a 5x5). That&#x27;s what I 
did at Euro 2004 and RWC 2005.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Please note that flip refers to edge orientation. When flipping a coin 
it has only 2 sides of course ;-) (not counting the edge of the coin 
as a side ...) Twisting refers to orientation of corners or middle 
centers of odd-sized (nxnxn) cubes.

I put ACube on the job to find a short alg. It came up with heaps of 
them, where this was one of the nicest to perform :

F2 R&#x27; U2 R2 D&#x27; F2 L R B2 D&#x27; L2 D2 R&#x27; B2 U D

It seemed that all algs that were short involved turning all layers :-
( I&#x27;m not sure how &quot;trigger-friendly&quot; this alg is, but at least it is 
short :-)

Thanks for looking.  Yeah, I only have/use cube explorer, so I find 
short ugly algs.  I am hoping to find a longer finger friendly one.

You&#x27;re an inspiration, I&#x27;ve got an idea I want to try for memorizing
the 3x3x3, I&#x27;ll try to post if it works.

Awesome stuff man!  You&#x27;re a big inspiration to me, I wish I could

Happy cubing,

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,

I have been working on something that Richard Patterson recommended to
me.  I had been using 132 images for the pieces and also journeys, but
I only put 3 images in each location.  Richard is learning the images
to also use 132 images for memorizing, and he recommended to me to put
all the images for corners or edges in one journey location.  I&#x27;ve
recently been doing that with some improvement from what I was using
before with 3 images per location.

As for my initial thoughts, the execution time when I place all the
images in one location is phenomenal (for me).  I can recall so much
more quickly than just &quot;shapes of cycles&quot;, or my old method, or at
last it feels to me like it is faster.  Since my entire edges cycle
(or corners) is one panoramic vision in my mind at my journey
location, I can effectively see every cycle I have to do at the same
time, and there is almost no delay from one cycle to the next.

However, memorization is still slow for me compared to my old way.  I
think with more practice that I will be able to speed it up.  I just
now got a solve successfully in 2:35.48 including the memorization
using all my images in one location for corners and another for edges.

Also using this method makes it so easy to do multiple solves in a
row.  This solve was actually my 6th solve in a row, and I feel like I
could do 6-10 more no problem.  I&#x27;m going to try some more solves
right now and try to get sub-2 using images.

I want to give full credit to Richard for me trying this, since I had
previously only used 3 images per location, but I think for 3x3x3 that
having this panorama of images would be much faster.

I think these images could be fast.  Once I speed up the memorization
to equal my old way I think I can get faster with this method than I
was with &quot;shapes of cycles&quot;.  This is because I can see the entire
edges or corners cycle in my panoramic view of all the cycles at once,
rather than having to recall them much more sequentially as with
&quot;shapes of cycles&quot;.

I hope this will be faster for me, but I think it will take a long
time to speed up my memorization this way.  Still I&#x27;ll try to post on
how it&#x27;s going if things get better.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I set a new personal best for solving the 5x5x5 BLD tonight.  The<br>
overall time was 22 minutes 3.68 seconds.<br>
<br>
I memorized in 11 and a half minutes about, and must half then solved<br>
in about 10 and half minutes.<br>
<br>
I was using my 576 image system, and I placed 3 images at each journey<br>
location.<br>
<br>
I know for a fact that a sub-20 minute solve will be possible.<br>
<br>
I still don&#x27;t know the limits of doing this in a competition, but I<br>
did do this solve with very loud music playing, and I was wearing my<br>
earmuffs to block out some of the noise.<br>
<br>
Marcus, your 5x5x5 BLD UWR solve has been a huge inspiration to me for<br>
so long, and I am glad to finally have started up the old leap frog<br>
game with you again :-)  Thanks for the inspiration, and perhaps one<br>
of us can prove that a sub-20 minute solve is possible soon, if it<br>
hasn&#x27;t already been done yet.  Thanks so much for keeping me<br>
motivated, and inspiring me to improve!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris,<br>
<br>
Congrats!!! That is an amazing time.  Sure kicks the crap out of that <br>
25, ne? You know all 576 images well enough already?! That&#x27;s pretty <br>
sick, man.  Loud music can definitely help, though.  Do you prefer <br>
fast or slower music? I find that the really crazy-fast loud stuff <br>
can really get things pumping.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m glad to hear it was an inspiration, but keep in mind your webpage <br>
was one of the first things I saw that was related to the cube, <br>
haha.  I think the credit goes to you, man.  Freestyle commutators <br>
still give me some issues sometimes (not FULLY used to them yet... <br>
the hardest part is moving a piece to where it needs to go without <br>
disturbing the slice involved or messing up the other piece&#x27;s <br>
position without realizing it), but I think they&#x27;re the fastest way <br>
to go once you get used to them.<br>
<br>
And yes sub-20 is possible.  I&#x27;m not so sure about sub-10 though <br>
unless the cube was exceptionally easy to turn and manipulate.  <br>
Personally my weakness is the physical speed -- although I think I <br>
just need to add a lot more lube to the 5x5x5 (little pieces here and <br>
there want to pop out sometimes, and layers like to lock).  <br>
<br>
Anyways it is great to see how quickly you&#x27;re improving your times! <br>
It&#x27;s very exciting... keep us posted on the progress!<br>

Because there&#x27;ll be loud music at competitions ?

          Hey everyone,

I set a new personal best for solving the 5x5x5 BLD tonight. The
overall time was 22 minutes 3.68 seconds.

I memorized in 11 and a half minutes about, and must half then solved
in about 10 and half minutes.

I was using my 576 image system, and I placed 3 images at each journey
location.

I know for a fact that a sub-20 minute solve will be possible.

I still don&#x27;t know the limits of doing this in a competition, but I
did do this solve with very loud music playing, and I was wearing my
earmuffs to block out some of the noise.

Marcus, your 5x5x5 BLD UWR solve has been a huge inspiration to me for
so long, and I am glad to finally have started up the old leap frog
game with you again :-) Thanks for the inspiration, and perhaps one
of us can prove that a sub-20 minute solve is possible soon, if it
hasn&#x27;t already been done yet. Thanks so much for keeping me
motivated, and inspiring me to improve!

Chris

Heh heh no I do it so it won&#x27;t be silent when I&#x27;m solving.  I used to <br>
practice in silence, and then at the Chattahoochee competition I was <br>
completely unprepared for all the noise when I was memorizing, and had <br>
a hard time concentrating.  Now I make sure it&#x27;s never quiet so that <br>
the noise becomes my comfort zone, and I am always used to having to <br>
drown out something.  Maybe music isn&#x27;t the best idea, but I try to <br>
always have at least something.  Sometimes I leave the TV on really <br>
loud, and sometimes I let my alarm clock go off during the whole <br>
solve, just so long as there is noise somehow.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Sorry :-). But you can still be the first &quot;real&quot; square1 blindsolver. 
I did take the first scramble Jaap&#x27;s scrambler produced (i.e. I didn&#x27;t 
try many times until getting an easy one, not trying the ones before) 
but it just happened to be easy. And though I might be able to do it 
with harder scrambles, it would be *a lot* harder and I probably 
wouldn&#x27;t want to do it. Not the way I did it this time, at least. 
Which I described a bit here:
http://s12.invisionfree.com/rubiks/index.php?showtopic=323

The square1 is completely different from most other puzzles in this 
aspect. Different 3x3 states have slightly different difficulty, but 
different square1 states can have veeery different difficulties, at 
least with the &quot;method&quot; I used this time. I&#x27;d call a &quot;real&quot; square1 
blindsolver someone who can do it easily from every possible state.

          <div class="email-content">Since I do not have an A drive on this computer, I will merely give <br>
some of the ideas about the method.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve just recently started blindfolded solves.  I used Pochmann&#x27;s <br>
Method.<br>
<br>
I came to realize that his method takes way to many moves.<br>
<br>
If you can isolate a Buffer area and place an edge at a time, then <br>
find another buffer area to work around the corners with, why can&#x27;t <br>
you solve them simultaneously?<br>
<br>
Perks:  4 New Algs, kick ass setups, no parity, <br>
having to switch back the corners on an odd number edge solve<br>
8 Less algs to perform on average<br>
No Corner Orienation Required<br>
After Corner Permutation,  can solve the rest of the edges as you <br>
would in Pochmann&#x27;s method<br>
<br>
When I get the chance I will upload the file.<br>
<br>
Everything is explained, such as why is there no parity?<br>
Which alg to perform and where.  This new concept of <br>
solving  &quot;2x2x1&quot;s<br>

I&#x27;m going to try to get to a different computer to load the files!<br>

This looks really cool and since I already use pochmann&#x27;s method, im
interested in learning it. Can you post an example solve with
memorization here?

Yes, gimme the weekend.  I&#x27;ll be back on Monday w/ the final details

I just finished this method.  I have been trying different things, it
wasn&#x27;t until yesterday that I realized the simplification making the
buffer area so compact.

So I&#x27;m gonna learn the algs this weekend, apply them to a method.  And
make a few examples.

By the way, when I post an example it will be added to the file, not
posted here.

And being new, I still need to perfect my own memorization method.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been working on 4x4x4 BLD again, and as I am getting more and<br>
more familiar with these images I am starting to find that I can<br>
memorize much more quickly and still be able to remember everything<br>
afterward.<br>
<br>
I just got my new pb solve for the 4x4x4 BLD again, with an overall<br>
time of 8:35.38 minutes.  I memorized in 4:08.xx and I know that soon<br>
I&#x27;ll be able to memorize in sub-4 minutes.<br>
<br>
Marcus, I remember you saying that your record was sub-8?  How far<br>
under 8 minutes were you?  I think I can get to 7:30 in a reasonable<br>
amount of time (maybe 2-3 weeks?) with more practice at memorizing<br>
quickly, and I think that one day a sub-7 solve will be possible.<br>
<br>
I have been practicing recalling my images every day as fast as I can.<br>
 So far it takes me about 40 minutes to recall all 576 images, which<br>
works out to 4 seconds per image on average, but I think I can half<br>
that the more I practice.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am very excited about how awesome it is to memorize with<br>
these images, and I can easily see getting under 8 minutes on the 4x4<br>
once I can recall them more quickly.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know if anyone else is interested in learning this method, but<br>
I have it detailed on my page here<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/memorizing.html if you&#x27;re interested.<br>
<br>
I hope to be sub-8 very soon, and Marcus watch out because I am<br>
gunning for your fastest time UWR for 4x4x4 ;-)<br>
<br>
I imagine these times might be hard to believe coming from me<br>
especially considering I only started getting them very recently.  Now<br>
that my accuracy is back up I plan on catching a sub-10 solve on<br>
video, and I&#x27;ll send it in to strangepuzzle.com so anyone can see it.<br>
<br>
So if you don&#x27;t believe me, wait a few days and I&#x27;ll try to post the<br>
link here to the video.<br>
<br>
Happy BLD&#x27;ing everyone, and I&#x27;ll try to post back as soon as I have a<br>
successful sub-10 on tape.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hehe I&#x27;m a little faster on the 4x4x4 than what I last said (my 
method for memorizing the centers is quicker) and I now use freestyle 
commutators (used to use this ugly algorithm for swapping).  I might 
get a 4x4x4 video for you soon, but maybe not because I currently 
lack a 4x4x4 cube.  Would you like a 5x5x5 video perhaps? I have that 
cube, at least.

I like that &quot;I am not bashing your method!&quot; assurance :-)

I know you&#x27;re not and I&#x27;m happy to see someone come up with something 
new. I might&#x27;ve thought about the general idea before but not really 
deeply. I really like my method for being so braindead and am afraid 
of having to setup more than one piece. But good observation that edge 
setups in two inner slices are so easy!

Cheers!

It may be your preference to learn the original 4 algs.<br>

You don&#x27;t intend to learn 12 algs? I.e. those four E/M edge cases for 
each corner orientation?

Try:
L&#x27; U&#x27; L F2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U F&#x27;

And:
U L&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F L R U&#x27; R&#x27;
(do that U&#x27; in R&#x27; U&#x27; R with right thumb)

Oh, and your E Block alg doesn&#x27;t work.

Haha, never considered that.  I figured I&#x27;d use 4 algs, but that&#x27;s a
great idea.  Thanks Stephan.

I&#x27;ll work on it then.
This optimizes setups to 2 face turns, one for the edge, and one for
the corner.
I&#x27;m still tinkering with the method.  Once I generate all 12 algs, I&#x27;m
going to reorganize the file.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I have a question about mental endurance: How do I force myself to<br>
focus over a long mental endurance trial?<br>
<br>
I just tried the most taxing ever endurance test for the big cubes BLD<br>
that I&#x27;ve ever done.  I did 3 BLD solves for the 4x4x4 literally all<br>
in a row, taking no more than the time necessary to scramble the cube<br>
again as rest between solves.  I then took a 2 hour break to watch a<br>
movie, and after that I did the exact same thing on the 5x5x5, trying<br>
3 BLD solves in a row and only resting as long as it took me to<br>
scramble the cube again before I started the next solve.<br>
<br>
Well, I DNF&#x27;d 2 of the 4x4 solves and all 3 of the 5x5 solves :.-( <br>
All of the DNF&#x27;s were off by relatively few pieces, 2-3 on average,<br>
with one 5x5 off by 6 centers, and one 5x5 with 12 pieces unsolved.<br>
<br>
On the first 4x4 solve I found it very easy to memorize, and it got<br>
progressively harder with each solve.  This wasn&#x27;t because of<br>
interference or anything, I have more journey locations than I think I<br>
could even do BLD solves in a day.  It was simply hard to keep<br>
memorizing, it&#x27;s like whatever part of my brain actually does the<br>
memorization gets tired and makes really stupid, and simple mistakes<br>
after a number of cubes in a row.<br>
<br>
On the 2nd and 3rd 5x5 solves I was making incredibly stupid errors<br>
during memorization, such as assuming an orange piece cycled to the D<br>
or U face, when for me orange is *always* the R face, no matter what<br>
size cube I am solving.  That&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve done since 2003 :-S  I<br>
even had to delete and rememorize 2 journey locations on the 2nd 5x5<br>
solve because of this.  That&#x27;s like trying to tie my shoes onto my<br>
hands lol, it&#x27;s that basic of an error, but for some reason it just<br>
made perfect sense to me at the time that those orange centers<br>
belonged on D and U lol.<br>
<br>
I had a huge number of stupid errors during the solving portion of the<br>
3rd 5x5x5 solve, and only ended up with the centers solved, and at<br>
least 3 pieces in each of the other orbits off.<br>
<br>
How can I keep my focus over a large number of solves?  I&#x27;m not really<br>
interested in doing or trying a relay event right now, where I<br>
memorize and solve lots of cubes in one single attempt, though I think<br>
those events are amazing!  I&#x27;m more interested in how I could retain<br>
my focus to try up to 5-6 5x5x5 BLD solves in a row with no rest at<br>
all in between other than the time taken to scramble the cube again.<br>
<br>
How do you relay people keep your focus over such a long attempt? <br>
Also, Stefan and Dave and others how do you guys keep your focus for a<br>
multiple 3x3x3 cubes attempt?  Tyson and Leyan and the 3x3x3 average<br>
guys, how do you do 12 solves in a row with such high accuracy and<br>
keep your focus?  I think techniques for keeping your focus would be a<br>
pretty universal thing, and would be the same whether you are trying a<br>
relay event or lots of cubes in a row in a relay or 3x3 BLD or 4x4 or<br>
5x5 BLD average.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m just looking for some way to improve my focus.  My thoughts right<br>
now are to keep forcing myself to do these endurance tests of 6 big<br>
cubes or more all done in a 4 hour or so period until I finally just<br>
get used to doing it and my accuracy goes up.  But are there deep<br>
breathing exercises or a slower or faster mental speed to try to move<br>
at, or anything else that would help make this easier?<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help/tips, this problem is really frustrating me.<br>

I think my longest was 67 minutes (4 cubes in Leipzig) so no wonder I 
have no endurance problem there. My 5x5, Super 5x5 and Megaminx took 
much longer, but then again that was just because I was terribly slow, 
which doesn&#x27;t exactly show/need good endurance.

Maybe you should ask the memorizers instead, their competitions 
require quite some endurance of this type.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">well tried Chris! Here is my experience.
  1).A strong desire to complete. 
  2).A strong will to achieve.
  3).Emphasise perfection.
                You have the first 2. The third one is real endurance. A sound sleep before the long mental endurance trial will help you in focusing.If you want to make your tries error free, check your memorisation and verify the pieces physically if what you have memorised is correct. This will be a real endurance. But the joy of perfect solves will nullify the effect. This checking of your memorisation physically will take more time than the first time memorisation.
               In 2003, I memorised 3600 binary digits in 1 hr 12 min. But, I memorised all the 3600 binary digits in 25 odd min and it took 46  odd min to verify what I memorised was correct or not. Had I not revised, the recall would not have been perfect and the penalty for the mistakes is very heavy as you know. Similarly, I memorised 20 packs of cards and recalled them all without a single mistake because I physically verified what I memorised is correct which took much longer than that of first time memorisation. 
              It will be a chance for you to understand why few things are missing or not clear or not strong enough or very vague etc.
              But, after few trials like this, when you realise your memorisation is perfect, you can avoid checking them physically. 
              So, in my opinion, memorising and solving several cubes one after the other is not long mental endurance. It is almost same as writting an examination for 3 hours trying to recall the answers for each and every question. Solving them perfectly is real endurance or as you said relay will be long mental endurance.
              Hope I am not discouraging you!!

after a number of cubes in a row.

On the 2nd and 3rd 5x5 solves I was making incredibly stupid errors
during memorization, such as assuming an orange piece cycled to the D
or U face, when for me orange is *always* the R face, no matter what
size cube I am solving. That&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve done since 2003 :-S I
even had to delete and rememorize 2 journey locations on the 2nd 5x5
solve because of this. That&#x27;s like trying to tie my shoes onto my
hands lol, it&#x27;s that basic of an error, but for some reason it just
made perfect sense to me at the time that those orange centers
belonged on D and U lol.

I had a huge number of stupid errors during the solving portion of the
3rd 5x5x5 solve, and only ended up with the centers solved, and at
least 3 pieces in each of the other orbits off.

How can I keep my focus over a large number of solves? I&#x27;m not really
interested in doing or trying a relay event right now, where I
memorize and solve lots of cubes in one single attempt, though I think
those events are amazing! I&#x27;m more interested in how I could retain
my focus to try up to 5-6 5x5x5 BLD solves in a row with no rest at
all in between other than the time taken to scramble the cube again.

How do you relay people keep your focus over such a long attempt? 
Also, Stefan and Dave and others how do you guys keep your focus for a
multiple 3x3x3 cubes attempt? Tyson and Leyan and the 3x3x3 average
guys, how do you do 12 solves in a row with such high accuracy and
keep your focus? I think techniques for keeping your focus would be a
pretty universal thing, and would be the same whether you are trying a
relay event or lots of cubes in a row in a relay or 3x3 BLD or 4x4 or
5x5 BLD average.

I&#x27;m just looking for some way to improve my focus. My thoughts right
now are to keep forcing myself to do these endurance tests of 6 big
cubes or more all done in a 4 hour or so period until I finally just
get used to doing it and my accuracy goes up. But are there deep
breathing exercises or a slower or faster mental speed to try to move
at, or anything else that would help make this easier?

Thanks for any help/tips, this problem is really frustrating me.

      Hi everyone,

I have a question about mental endurance: How do I force myself to
focus over a long mental endurance trial?

I just tried the most taxing ever endurance test for the big cubes BLD
that I&#x27;ve ever done. I did 3 BLD solves for the 4x4x4 literally all
in a row, taking no more than the time necessary to scramble the cube
again as rest between solves. I then took a 2 hour break to watch a
movie, and after that I did the exact same thing on the 5x5x5, trying
3 BLD solves in a row and only resting as long as it took me to
scramble the cube again before I started the next solve.

Well, I DNF&#x27;d 2 of the 4x4 solves and all 3 of the 5x5 solves :.-( 
All of the DNF&#x27;s were off by relatively few pieces, 2-3 on average,
with one 5x5 off by 6 centers, and one 5x5 with 12 pieces unsolved.

On the first 4x4 solve I found it very easy to memorize, and it got
progressively harder with each solve. This wasn&#x27;t because of
interference or anything, I have more journey locations than I think I
could even do BLD solves in a day. It was simply hard to keep

          <div class="email-content">1).A good deep breathing excercise before any mental event is helpful as oxygen is the fuel for the brain and it refreshes the brain.
  2).Any mental excercise which co-ordinate the left and right brain, say balls juggling, is also very good just before any mental event. Many world class memorisers do that just before mental marathan events.
  3).Eating green plantain(banana) during the marathan mental events also boost the energy.

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,

Thanks for the advice of things to try to work on mental focus, I
think I have already narrowed down the problem of my accuracy, and
that is that I try to never revise when I am going quickly.  This
usually means that my first few solves are successful and done in
fairly quick times, but after I keep going I seem to pretty much DNF
every cube after that if I continue to not revise.

As to the reason I am doing all these solves like this, I have two. 
Since I started using journeys to memorize cubes I found it was easier
to do multiple cubes in a row, and that made me curious as to my
limit.  I just want to know how many I can do before I just completely
lose the will to try another solve, or my brain just gets tired and I
make too many mistakes.

The other reason is to train for a competition.  I know at US
nationals I will be able to do the 5x5 and 4x4 BLD on separate days,
but that is only because it is a three day event.  Normally you have
to do two solves on the 4x4 and two solves on the 5x5 in the same day.
   I&#x27;d like to get to the point where I can do many more than that in
the same day, so that doing 4 solves does not feel like a big
endurance event to me, and it certainly did in Georgia when I tried it
for the first time.

I&#x27;d say right now I&#x27;m mostly just curious how long I can go before I
have to stop.  I have enough journey locations to theoretically do 17
5x5x5 BLD solves all in a row, but I seriously doubt that right now I
can sustain the will to do that, or sustain my focus to even attempt
it.  Right now I&#x27;d be ecstatic just to say I could do 5-6 in a row,
even if some of them are DNF.

I think a better test though, the more I think about it, is to see how
many consecutive cubes I can do successfully and ignore the time
taken.  I do want to work up to the real relay one day (2x2-5x5 1
attempt), but for now I just want to be able to do consecutive single
solves and not make such weird mental errors.

I still cannot believe it made perfect sense to me to cycle an orange
sticker to the wrong face after 4-5 solves.  It&#x27;s like whatever part
of my brain handles memory just went delirious for a few seconds until
I was able to realize exactly what I was doing.  I can definitely see
the reason for revising now, especially after seeing what happens if I
don&#x27;t revise.

I agree though, a few single solve cubes done in a row doesn&#x27;t
constitute a memory endurance event if you take into account the
insane things that people have done with cards or binary digits, or
most simultaneous chess games played BLD, etc..  However, it is a very
big endurance test for me :-(  That does motivate me, though, to work
harder to make it not feel so hard to do.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

No I definitely consider your 5x5 and super 5x5, and megaminx
especially, to be endurance events.  Remember my first super4x4 took
me longer than your megaminx solve took you, so you don&#x27;t have to keep
saying you&#x27;re slow, because I definitely started out slower ;-)  I did
an easier puzzle in longer time than it took you to do a much harder
puzzle!  Even if you just rate them by number of combinations, the
megaminx still wins by a factor of 10^15.

I remember from that 4x4 solve though, that I had two distinct moments
where I almost lost the will to keep going, but was able to force
myself to continue.  I think if you have to battle your will to keep
going, then it counts as an endurance event.  If you didn&#x27;t have a
moment like that for megaminx or either 5x5, then I think it shows you
have a super strong will, and can handle a long event that most people
would consider an endurance test.

As to the multiple 3x3&#x27;s I personally consider that an endurance
event, I tried to do 2 in a row and found that my total time was much
longer than two consecutive single solves, since I had a hard time
keeping the information from the two cubes straight.  Doing 4, in
public no less, I think is amazing!  It seems like just battling your
nerves would be enough to call that an endurance test.

What do you think the limits are for an endurance test like this?  I&#x27;m
sure up to 20-30 cubes could be memorized with a good memory
technique, but how many could one do and still solve all of them? 
That seems to be a much harder question to answer to me.

 <br>
In sports psychology, sports people are encouraged to produce performances without thinking.<br>
eg. A very natural successful penalty kick might fail if the person is focusing on actively performing the mechanics of the kick but it will work fluidly very often if the person does it as a habitual action.<br>
 <br>
For that reason, it may be that the best success would come from so much habitual practice that focusing is not going to distort the required process. Habitual action would require less concentration and would therefore lead to more accuracy in endurance events, surely?!!<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Having said that, the downside, I guess, is complacency and cock-suredness taking the place of correct habitual processes.<br>

even had to delete and rememorize 2 journey locations on the 2nd 5x5

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Does anyone have a good alg for swapping just two corners and two <br>
central most edges on a 5x5x5?  The alg is allowed to rotate center <br>
groups, and it&#x27;s ok for the it to perform small cycles of centers <br>
around on their respective faces, as long as no center piece is moved <br>
to a new face.<br>
<br>
The alg I am using right now is:<br>
R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; (Ff)&#x27; x&#x27; L&#x27; F U&#x27; L F&#x27; d u F L&#x27; U F&#x27; <br>
L u&#x27; x<br>
<br>
Is there a more speedsolve friendly way to do this?  I&#x27;m keeping <br>
Stefan&#x27;s 4x4 PLL parity alg in mind when I say that, something like <br>
his (Uu)2 (Rr)2 U2 r2 U2 (Rr)2 (Uu)2, but for this situation on the <br>
5x5x5.  It doesn&#x27;t have to use the T perm, the N perm or the J perm <br>
would be good too, even the F wouldn&#x27;t be bad.  Even if the pieces are <br>
scattered around the cube, actually that wouldn&#x27;t be bad either, as <br>
long as it switches two corners and two central most edges.<br>
<br>
My only thoughts on how to do this are to use a PLL alg from the 3x3x3 <br>
that does this, and then fix the wing edges that get messed up in the <br>
process.  Is there a more direct approach?  Also, is there an ACube <br>
5x5?  I didn&#x27;t think there was any program like that, but I thought I <br>
would ask to make sure.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

How about following the Tperm with my &quot;DedgeSwap 5x5&quot;?

          <div class="email-content">Holy crap, Stefan that alg is amazing!  That is a much faster way to 
solve that case than the alg I use!  You&#x27;ve made me a convert, I&#x27;m

I just realized Chris Hunt is on vacation for a couple weeks.  Can

If anyone here can compress the file, I&#x27;ll give you the URL of where

Awesome, well anyway I have the video ready, and I hope to be able to

I compressed the video a little bit, down to 19 MB in order to keep<br>
most of the original quality.  I also have a version Doug Li<br>
compressed for me at about 18MB that loses a little bit of quality,<br>
not much, in case this file is too huge to deal with.<br>

For the UWR stuff, Richard and I only took off our records from

Thanks, that worked. You look funny when you scramble. And wow, from 
7:48 to 8:34 you didn&#x27;t even do any twisting...

Yeah thank god. Do you know how huge a decompressed video is?

  Thanks, that worked. You look funny when you scramble. And wow, from 
  7:48 to 8:34 you didn&#x27;t even do any twisting...

  Yeah thank god. Do you know how huge a decompressed video is?

  Cheers!

Cool, yeah I haven&#x27;t used rapidshare before so I&#x27;m still learning how <br>
to get things to work correctly there.  Heh heh I just wanted to <br>
really prove that I had my eyes closed while scrambling.  Also before <br>
I scrambled on camera I had applied a 40 move scramble from Jaap&#x27;s <br>
page to make sure it wasn&#x27;t entirely a hand scramble, since those for <br>
me tend to leave really nice and easy center blocks.<br>
<br>
As for the long delay, I had forgotten a journey location.  I had <br>
purposefully gone very, very fast during memorization, which is the <br>
only way I can get a sub-10.  I had fairly good recall on everything <br>
except for one location, which was:<br>
<br>
A giant Locust(LC) is standing next to a guy in a tuxedo(UX) and the <br>
guy grabs a giant cigarette(NI-for nicotine) and stabs it into the <br>
locust so it won&#x27;t come after him.<br>
<br>
All I could remember at first was the locust or LC, so before the <br>
pause I do the cycle Q-&gt;L-&gt;C which is UBl-&gt;DBr-&gt;uFL and the alg I used <br>
for that was:<br>
r2 B&#x27; u2 B U2 B&#x27; u2 B U2 r2<br>
<br>
To remember the rest of that location I was going through the <br>
locations I had already solved, and the future locations to find which <br>
letters would not be used.  I then found I had the letters I-N-U-X <br>
leftover, and from there I immediately remembered the guy in the <br>
tuxedo from the U and the X.   You can see me actually tap the dBL(U) <br>
and dFR(X) pieces as I remember, and that left either IN(Intel blue <br>
guys) or NI(nicotine) and that&#x27;s when I remembered the cigarette and <br>
the rest of that location.<br>
<br>
In a competition, unless I already had a successful solve on the first <br>
try, there&#x27;s no way I would memorize that quickly since I tend to DNF <br>
much more often when I go that fast.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to prove, on video, that sub-10 was really possible.  <br>
However I admit that at home and with a camera I have the luxury of <br>
being able to film again if I DNF, but in a competition I would solve <br>
much more carefully and slowly, unless I already had one good solve <br>
under my belt.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; That file is the original file I made, it&#x27;s right at about 38MB, <br>
and <br>
&gt; &gt; hasn&#x27;t been decompressed.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Yeah thank god. Do you know how huge a decompressed video is?<br>
<br>
Haha I just noticed that, yeah DEcompressing a file that started at <br>
38MB would be pretty scary!  I figure I&#x27;ll learn to speak correctly <br>
one day lol.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been thinking about the problem of forgetting a cycle in the <br>
middle of a longer solve.  This could happen on any size cube, <br>
assuming you are using the orient first and 3-cycles method.  For <br>
Stefan&#x27;s approach this could be forgetting one single piece, or <br>
maybe 2 pieces in succession.  This idea is probably more relevant <br>
to the bigger cubes, but I wanted to post since it still does relate <br>
to the 3x3, in case anyone is interested.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve had solves on the 4x4 and 5x5 where I forgot only one single <br>
image, or as in my 4x4x4 BLD video for about 40 seconds I forgot two <br>
successive images.  Each image for me is a 3 cycle, so I effectively <br>
forget only one or two single three cycles, but can still perfectly <br>
recall everything else.<br>
<br>
What I usually do is to stop and count up all my letters (pieces) <br>
and see which are unused, and try to rebuild the image I&#x27;ve <br>
forgotten.  This takes time obviously, and I&#x27;ve thought that maybe <br>
continuing solving and doing this at the same time would be better.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been working on this, and have decided to add this to my <br>
method.  What it is, is to purposefully skip the forgotten cycle, <br>
and do everything else, then at the end you will have run through <br>
all your pieces or in my case letters, and can more easily recall <br>
which are unused.<br>
<br>
This is a simple idea, and makes sense with just a little thought, <br>
but I&#x27;ve started practicing it to make it reflex, which I think will <br>
be a powerful addition to a blindfolded solving method.<br>
<br>
It works like this, say I have the 24 cycle<br>
(ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) for the edges on a 4x4 or 5x5 cube.<br>
<br>
Now let&#x27;s say I forgot the image DE, or dentist.  What I used to do <br>
is 1) freak out, followed by 2) try to go through the other images <br>
and add up all the letters until I find the ones I haven&#x27;t used, and <br>
eventually discover that D and E are free, allowing me to <br>
remember &quot;dentist&quot;.<br>
<br>
What I say now is to do this:<br>
<br>
The first three cycle is still available, so do the cycle (ABC) <br>
leaving<br>
<br>
(ADEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX)<br>
<br>
Of course I don&#x27;t know the upcoming cycle, so I would view it as:<br>
(A??FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX)<br>
<br>
Now I could take the time to go through each image and find that I <br>
am missing D and E, but this could take up to 40 seconds at least, <br>
probably around a minute on average.  Why waste that time, when I <br>
can let the solving do the search for me?  So I&#x27;ll skip my forgotten <br>
cycle and move on to the rest:<br>
<br>
Now I do (AFG) since I know the next image after my forgotten one <br>
(here the DE image).<br>
<br>
Looking at the original cycle (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX), I have now <br>
done (ABC) followed by (AFG)<br>
<br>
This leaves the original cycle in the form<br>
(FDE)(AHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX)<br>
<br>
This is because after (ABC) I was supposed to send A to D, but I <br>
instead sent it to F for the (AFG) cycle.  This means that the piece <br>
now in F goes to D.  The piece that is in D needs to go to E.  And <br>
because FG followed DE then the piece in E needed to go to F, which <br>
leaves me with a simple three cycle to pick up at the end.<br>
<br>
So basically I continue as normal for the rest of the cycle <br>
(AHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX), and just remember that I have to do the cycle <br>
(F??) at the end, and the two question marks are the forgotten <br>
pieces, once I remember them to be DE I fill that cycle in as (FDE).<br>
<br>
In general, if you forget a cycle, move on anyway.  Then once you <br>
recall the two pieces of the forgotten cycle, use the first piece of <br>
the next cycle after your forgotten one as your first piece in <br>
the &quot;pick up&quot; cycle and do that 3 cycle to complete the cube.<br>
<br>
So for images, I forget DE.  DE was followed by FG so I moved on <br>
with (AFG).  Then once I remember that DE is the forgotten cycle I <br>
look to my next image (FG) and take the first spot (F) and use it as <br>
the first piece of a 3 cycle, followed by the forgotten stuff, <br>
giving (FDE).<br>
<br>
Again I don&#x27;t know how useful this will be to 3x3x3 BLD, but I can&#x27;t <br>
believe I never thought to do this for the bigger cubes, and it <br>
certainly is going to become my main technique for what to do if I <br>
forget an image, effectively if I forget a cycle.<br>
<br>
---------<br>
<br>
As to my 4x4x4 BLD video mistake, where I forgot two successive <br>
images for about 40 seconds, that&#x27;s like having <br>
(ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) and forgetting the images BC and DE, so <br>
bicycle then dentist.<br>
<br>
In my head I would have the cycle (A????FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVQWX)<br>
<br>
So I would move on to (AFG) leaving the following permutation on my <br>
cube:<br>
(FBCDE)(AHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX)<br>
<br>
So I do the same.  I forgot BC and DE, so I move on to the next one <br>
I remember, FG.  I then continue as normal, remembering at the end <br>
to take the first letter of the image immediately after the ones I <br>
forgot, here F, and use it as the first piece followed by the <br>
forgotten stuff.  So in my head I know I need to do (F????) at the <br>
end, and I fill in the unknowns as I discover unused pieces while <br>
solving the rest of the cycle.  So I start with F and continue with <br>
BCDE once I remember that those are the missing letters.  Once I&#x27;ve <br>
remembered BCDE I just add F to the start and do the cycle (FBCDE) <br>
and the cube will still solve.<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
Ok, I just wanted to post about this since I think it is a really <br>
good tool to have in the belt so to speak, and I can&#x27;t believe I <br>
never thought to try this before now.  Again I know it is a simple <br>
idea, and probably pretty obvious, but I think it should be required <br>
to be part of the method for the bigger cubes, since it lets you <br>
continue solving after a forgotten cycle while *still* searching <br>
your mind for the forgotten pieces, rather than just wasting time <br>
not twisting and only thinking about what the forgotten pieces are.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Actually, thinking about it more you can even do a pickup cycle 
within a pickup cycle.

Say I start with (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) and I forget BC and DE 
so in my head I have: 
(A????FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX)

I would then skip to (AFG) and continue as normal.  On my cube this 
leaves me with the pickup cycle (FBCDE) at the end to complete the 
cube.

Now say for some reason I recall that the second skipped image is 
DE, but I can&#x27;t remember the middle one.  This let&#x27;s me know that my 
pickup cycle looks like (F??DE).  I then skip over the forgotten 
image again and continue as normal, so I do (FDE), which leaves the 
pickup cycle (D??), which on the cube will be (DBC), I just need to 
keep thinking to remember that B and C are the last two unused 
letters.

So I can skip the first time leaving me with the pickup cycle 
(FBCDE) to solve the cube.  Then if I recall the DE before the BC I 
can do the cycle (FDE) leaving me with a different pickup cycle 
(DBC) to complete the cube.  I am immediately solving recalled 
information this way, and it is also narrowing down my choices for 
what the last two pieces can be in my final pickup cycle.  This is 
great, so you can continue solving and still be searching for unused 
pieces at the same time, there&#x27;s no reason to pause at all!

Wow, ok this is cool, I definitely am getting more and more excited 
about this idea the more I think about it.

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

In my experience, this is kinda why I like having fixed journey items
-- they are easy to go back to.  For instance, if Britney Spears
represents, in general, the third set within a cycle (ie, out of the
cycle abcdefg, Spears would be afg), and I forgot f or g, I would
actually just think of the verb in itself starting with &#x27;b&#x27; as it is
impossible for me to get a verb that starts with &#x27;b&#x27; and move through
the list.  I also keep in mind the setting (ie. my background for X
centers differ from my + centers, and my Wing settings are underwater,
etc).  What I mean here is, think, &quot;Is Spears balancing anything? Is
she crying? Dragging anything? Electrocuting something?&quot; Not only will
the verb sound right when you hit it, but the associated noun will
also pop into memory.  Furthermore, if you don&#x27;t remember if Spears
is, say, electrocuting something, but you know that Arnold is
electrocuting a lollipop, then you know it isn&#x27;t &#x27;e&#x27; that is involved.
 The added concept of a setting will also lend more information for
filling in the blanks and jogging your memory.  

In other words, it might help to run through images until one of them
sounds right instead of thinking of the ones you have not used --
there&#x27;s always the chance you recall something that was not even
memorized in the first place (ie. an image that was not initially
involved).  Do you think it saves time by saving such memory issues
until the end of the cycle? Or is it better to deal with things then
and there to save time dealing with cycle pickups? Even with your
memory burp you still achieved a sub-10 time on your 4x4.  

I also found that sometimes making the memory items more vivid helps
(in other words, the best way to avoiding this memory issue is simply
not to forget).  Instead of thinking of &quot;bicycle&quot; and &quot;dentist&quot; simply
as interacting items, give your mind a moment to wander and maybe make
a small scene, like from a movie, with very vivid details, even
dialogue.  Maybe add in extra items that would lend to easy recall
such that those items are not part of the memory system in itself, but
exist only to make it easier.  For instance, maybe there&#x27;s a dentist
on a bicycle running away from an Austin Powers robot with bad teeth,
angry because the dentist did a poor job fixing him.  The dentist
swerves everywhere, dodging Austin&#x27;s laser vision or something.  Now,
 Austin Powers, robots, and lasers may not be part of your memory
system -- but I assure you it will be easier to recall Dentist on a
Bicycle when you&#x27;re in the midst of solving.

Anyways I doubt this is anything new but just figured it was worth
throwing in a cent or two, lol.  Amazing solve time, by the way! It
was a fun video to watch :D

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Hey,<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
Hey Marcus,<br>
<br>
&gt; In my experience, this is kinda why I like having fixed journey <br>
items<br>
&gt; -- they are easy to go back to.  For instance, if Britney Spears<br>
&gt; represents, in general, the third set within a cycle (ie, out of <br>
the<br>
&gt; cycle abcdefg, Spears would be afg), and I forgot f or g, I would<br>
&gt; actually just think of the verb in itself starting with &#x27;b&#x27; as it <br>
is<br>
&gt; impossible for me to get a verb that starts with &#x27;b&#x27; and move <br>
through<br>
&gt; the list.  I also keep in mind the setting (ie. my background for X<br>
&gt; centers differ from my + centers, and my Wing settings are <br>
underwater,<br>
&gt; etc).  What I mean here is, think, &quot;Is Spears balancing anything? <br>
Is<br>
&gt; she crying? Dragging anything? Electrocuting something?&quot; Not only <br>
will<br>
&gt; the verb sound right when you hit it, but the associated noun will<br>
&gt; also pop into memory.  Furthermore, if you don&#x27;t remember if Spears<br>
&gt; is, say, electrocuting something, but you know that Arnold is<br>
&gt; electrocuting a lollipop, then you know it isn&#x27;t &#x27;e&#x27; that is <br>
involved.<br>
&gt;  The added concept of a setting will also lend more information for<br>
&gt; filling in the blanks and jogging your memory.  <br>
<br>
Yeah I think that is a downside to using images to represent two <br>
pieces, if I forget one image I have so many different choices of <br>
what it could be based on what letters are left over.<br>
<br>
Also, the hardest thing I have found is that the images don&#x27;t <br>
suggest anything about the letters to me anymore.  I can&#x27;t just <br>
glance through and see an image and know it&#x27;s letters, I really have <br>
to take the time to decode what the letters are from that image.  If <br>
I am frantically searching for an unused letter, nothing about a <br>
bagel, or Achilles, or Batman, or a magic lamp, or a mug of root <br>
beer suggests the letter &quot;A&quot; readily, even though they all contain <br>
an A.  Bagel=BA, Achilles=AC, Batman=DA for Dark Knight, magic <br>
lamp=LA for lamp, mug of root beer=AW for A&amp;W root beer.  Now I can <br>
very quickly go from LA to magic lamp, or AW to a mug of root beer, <br>
but I&#x27;m not as fast at seeing a mug of root beer and feeling &quot;that <br>
image has an A&quot;.  I have to think, &quot;hmmm root beer, that&#x27;s AW which <br>
has an A&quot;, I can&#x27;t just do it immediately.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve found that sometimes even if I know A is an unaccounted for <br>
letter, that still leaves me with 46 possible images, 23 for A_, and <br>
23 for _A.<br>
<br>
However, the upside to me is that I can put 6 pieces of a cycle into <br>
one journey location, Boba Fett kicking a giant Lobster so that it <br>
falls over onto Spiderman would be FTRLXS and represents 6 pieces of <br>
my cycle and would fit into one journey location.<br>
<br>
I guess I like the benefits and power of combining so much <br>
information into one location, that I&#x27;m willing to find ways <br>
like &quot;pickup cycles&quot; to overcome forgetting an image, which for me <br>
is nerve racking, since there are so many choices for what it could <br>
be if I truly can&#x27;t remember anything about it.<br>
<br>
I have tried to go through all 46 possibles if I can remember that <br>
there is an &quot;A&quot; in my image say, but that usually takes a lot of <br>
time and I try to see if I can just find all the letters missing, <br>
and see what combinations of them seem familiar.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I also found that sometimes making the memory items more vivid <br>
helps<br>
&gt; (in other words, the best way to avoiding this memory issue is <br>
simply<br>
&gt; not to forget).  Instead of thinking of &quot;bicycle&quot; and &quot;dentist&quot; <br>
simply<br>
&gt; as interacting items, give your mind a moment to wander and maybe <br>
make<br>
&gt; a small scene, like from a movie, with very vivid details, even<br>
&gt; dialogue.  Maybe add in extra items that would lend to easy recall<br>
&gt; such that those items are not part of the memory system in itself, <br>
but<br>
&gt; exist only to make it easier.  For instance, maybe there&#x27;s a <br>
dentist<br>
&gt; on a bicycle running away from an Austin Powers robot with bad <br>
teeth,<br>
&gt; angry because the dentist did a poor job fixing him.  The dentist<br>
&gt; swerves everywhere, dodging Austin&#x27;s laser vision or something.  <br>
Now,<br>
&gt;  Austin Powers, robots, and lasers may not be part of your memory<br>
&gt; system -- but I assure you it will be easier to recall Dentist on a<br>
&gt; Bicycle when you&#x27;re in the midst of solving.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I can see what you mean.  I tend to try to minimize the motion <br>
involved in each journey location, and just picture the objects with <br>
the motions they would be doing as implied by how they are setup.  <br>
However, sometimes this just does not work, like with 3 inanimate <br>
objects, so I have to make it more of a movie and add in the motion.<br>
<br>
What&#x27;s cool though, is that each object is starting to build a <br>
personality because I always see the same ones over and over again.  <br>
For example RK=rake for me, and rake is becoming a magical possessed <br>
rake that can attack things at will, which makes the scene funny.  <br>
This is because I often have a rake surrounded by inanimate objects, <br>
and no person to wield it.  So I let the rake wield itself and go <br>
beserk.  This was weird at first, but now the rake has a personality <br>
of it&#x27;s own, plus it&#x27;s sort of magic.  So now I get a little excited <br>
when RK comes up in my cycle, because I know the rake will be doing <br>
something funny at that location, and I&#x27;m more likely to not forget <br>
anything from that location during the solve.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Anyways I doubt this is anything new but just figured it was worth<br>
&gt; throwing in a cent or two, lol.  Amazing solve time, by the way! It<br>
&gt; was a fun video to watch :D<br>
<br>
No I definitely appreciate the ideas, absolutely!  I think that is <br>
the only way that cubing can grow, is if everone shares their <br>
ideas.  I think personally though I am much more drawn to using <br>
letter pair images than PAO.  The upside is that I really believe I <br>
can personally memorize faster with letter pair images than by PAO.  <br>
Now I know different method are better for different people, and it <br>
probably depends on how your brain is wired or something.  There is <br>
so much variation in the world of memorizing.  I know that there are <br>
speed memorizers who just put one image per location, and just have <br>
lots of locations prepared, and they get amazing times on speed <br>
cards and the other categories!<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m willing to try to find ways to overcome the pitfalls, such as <br>
forgetting an image, since most of the time I don&#x27;t forget an image <br>
and I can memorize much faster this way.<br>
<br>
I say if PAO is very powerful for you, then use it.  Forgetting a <br>
verb or an object, or a person is not as bad for you since you can <br>
try the choices much more quickly.  I hate the pitfalls of <br>
forgetting an image using letter pairs, but I think pickup cycles <br>
will really help to make it not so nerve racking to forget something <br>
during a solve.<br>
<br>
For me though, I love how easy these images make it to memorize.  <br>
All the work is done in having the letters already have an image <br>
associated to it, I just have to learn the personality of the harder <br>
images for things like RK=rake.  Images like RB=Robocop are pretty <br>
easy, and already have a very strong personality in my mind, but <br>
some of them I have to see how they can interact over a few solves <br>
before I know what they&#x27;re like.  In 5 years though I&#x27;ll know the <br>
personality of every object perfectly, and will be able to combine <br>
them much more easily.  Ben Pridmore talked about how he slowly <br>
developed rules and personalites for how all his images combine, and <br>
after using them for years things got easier and easier.  I&#x27;m hoping <br>
the same will happen for my images once I&#x27;ve used them a long time.<br>
<br>
I know this message is long, I just wanted to post about this letter <br>
pair method.  I know I probably seem to be always mentioning the <br>
problems with it, but in reality I think the benefits are worth so <br>
much that is outweighs the problems, at least for me and however my <br>
brain is wired to remember things.<br>
<br>
I do appreciate the advice, but I would prefer to learn how to use <br>
pickup cycles, and keep using letter pair memorizing, rather than <br>
switch back to PAO and avoid the harder problem of forgetting part <br>
of a location, but for me not being able to memorize as quickly as <br>
with letter pairs.  I think we should probably compile a page of <br>
advice for the different methods, because as you say maybe for PAO <br>
pickup cycles are not necessary, since you can probably remember the <br>
forgoten part of the journey location much more quickly than I <br>
could.  However for letter pairs, pickup cycles are sort of the <br>
natural way to handle a forgotten image, since you can keep solving <br>
and discover the missing letters at the same time, and you don&#x27;t <br>
lose time when that memorizing mistake happens, or at least not as <br>
much time.<br>
<br>
I still want to post a tutorial for how I am going about BLD solving <br>
on my page, and add in all these tricks like pickup cycles and <br>
center and edge blocks and the like.<br>
<br>
Anyway, would you be interested in writing a section about PAO?  Why <br>
have the site just have one method, when it can cover all of them?  <br>
Stefan, would you be interested in writing a section about your <br>
method and using a buffer and helper piece for the cycles?  Also you <br>
could post all the most efficient setup moves for each piece, etc..<br>
<br>
BLD cubing doesn&#x27;t seem as big as speed solving, but then again <br>
there are fewer resources for BLD cubing online, and I think that is <br>
a big reason why.<br>
<br>
Do you guys want to change that?  I certainly do, or at least do my <br>
part to help change that.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents again, or three lol.  These messages always get <br>
longer than intend when I first start.<br>

&gt; has an A&quot;, I can&#x27;t just do it immediately.<br>
<br>
Yeah -- understandable; is there a way to convert the images into<br>
something more obvious? I mean if your system works, it works -- but<br>
of course there can always be ways to circumvent normal issues.  To<br>
me, for instance, Root Beer would be RB or something, and is easy to<br>
decode.  A&amp;W to Root Beer is an added layer of association.  Easy for<br>
some images, harder for others, as you&#x27;ve eloquently stated.  Is this<br>
issue something that doesn&#x27;t really hinder much during normal solving<br>
or is it only an issue when a cycle is forgotten??<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; However, the upside to me is that I can put 6 pieces of a cycle into <br>
&gt; one journey location, Boba Fett kicking a giant Lobster so that it <br>
&gt; falls over onto Spiderman would be FTRLXS and represents 6 pieces of <br>
&gt; my cycle and would fit into one journey location.<br>
<br>
WHOA OK.  That is just awesome, hahaha.  I did not know your system<br>
included that much information in one spot... that is so cool (I was<br>
under the impression that it carried up to 2-3 or so).  Those would be<br>
quite vivid images, indeed.  Hmm that would be a pretty good advantage<br>
-- I mean so much information in one spot is harder to forget.  I<br>
think we both attempt this but in different ways, but of course we see<br>
the advantages of doing so.  I am beginning to think your approach is<br>
more &quot;efficient&quot; as the abundance of data involved pertains to the<br>
PIECES, whereas mine relies on fixed data.  For instance, my X-center<br>
cycle memory hooks take place in bright, peaceful settings.  My array<br>
of People denote position within the cycle.  This is merely for memory<br>
purposes and has nothing to do with what needs to be &quot;solved&quot; until I<br>
throw in a verb and noun for a given location.  This probably means I<br>
have to memorize more &quot;locations&quot; with less data per location whereas<br>
you are able to fix up to 6 pieces of data in a location, which is<br>
obviously more effective.  My question is, it is consistent? How often<br>
are you able to get 6 per cycle? This is kind of an exciting idea -- I<br>
had no idea you were able to fit so much in one location.  <br>
<br>
&gt; I guess I like the benefits and power of combining so much <br>
&gt; information into one location, that I&#x27;m willing to find ways <br>

<br>
Yeah I agree -- the only reason I bring the counterargument up is that<br>
I wonder if this added method deducts more time than it would take to<br>
simply recall the forgotten item.  What about if there are multiple<br>
cycles involved? Just simply wondering if there are cases when it<br>
would be more difficult to pick up the cycle later.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; I also found that sometimes making the memory items more vivid <br>

&gt; &gt; (in other words, the best way to avoiding this memory issue is <br>

<br>
LOL that is hilarious, a possessed rake :P But yes, as you stated, the<br>
more personality the better :) Maybe it&#x27;s just me but adding levels of<br>
perversion is also helpful.  Sometimes levels of grotesque or taboo<br>
memory hooks are also hard to forget (ie. very naughty interactions<br>
between Shakira and ice cream :) )<br>
<br>

<br>
Yep tis the idea :D Just want to also apologize if I seem like I am<br>
attacking your system, lol, which is not my intent -- I&#x27;m just<br>
throwing ideas/questions out so that we get a big pool of ideas going<br>
so we can learn to adapt new concepts, etc, for speed/efficiency<br>
purposes.  It really does depend on the person however, since our<br>
minds can definitely work differently.  Some people are more visual,<br>
or more aural, or tactile, etc.  I think it also depends on your<br>
interests -- I&#x27;m very into math/science but I am also very into<br>
writing and literature, so it helps to sort of combine elements of<br>
mathematical efficiency and creative precision in order to appeal to<br>
all areas of interest that associate well in your head.<br>
 <br>
&gt; For me though, I love how easy these images make it to memorize.  <br>
&gt; All the work is done in having the letters already have an image <br>
&gt; associated to it, I just have to learn the personality of the harder <br>
&gt; images for things like RK=rake.  Images like RB=Robocop are pretty <br>
&gt; easy, and already have a very strong personality in my mind, but <br>
&gt; some of them I have to see how they can interact over a few solves <br>
&gt; before I know what they&#x27;re like.  In 5 years though I&#x27;ll know the <br>
&gt; personality of every object perfectly, and will be able to combine <br>
&gt; them much more easily.  Ben Pridmore talked about how he slowly <br>
&gt; developed rules and personalites for how all his images combine, and <br>
&gt; after using them for years things got easier and easier.  I&#x27;m hoping <br>
&gt; the same will happen for my images once I&#x27;ve used them a long time.<br>
<br>
Yeah he is correct I think -- over time your memory items become more<br>
second-nature, and they evolve into something more personal.  The more<br>
personal something is, the more associations arise.  The more<br>
associations that arise, well, obviously the easier/faster it is to<br>
memorize!<br>
<br>
&gt; I know this message is long, I just wanted to post about this letter <br>
&gt; pair method.  I know I probably seem to be always mentioning the <br>
&gt; problems with it, but in reality I think the benefits are worth so <br>
&gt; much that is outweighs the problems, at least for me and however my <br>
&gt; brain is wired to remember things.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I do appreciate the advice, but I would prefer to learn how to use <br>
&gt; pickup cycles, and keep using letter pair memorizing, rather than <br>
&gt; switch back to PAO and avoid the harder problem of forgetting part <br>
&gt; of a location, but for me not being able to memorize as quickly as <br>
&gt; with letter pairs.  I think we should probably compile a page of <br>
&gt; advice for the different methods, because as you say maybe for PAO <br>
&gt; pickup cycles are not necessary, since you can probably remember the <br>
&gt; forgoten part of the journey location much more quickly than I <br>
&gt; could.  However for letter pairs, pickup cycles are sort of the <br>
&gt; natural way to handle a forgotten image, since you can keep solving <br>
&gt; and discover the missing letters at the same time, and you don&#x27;t <br>
&gt; lose time when that memorizing mistake happens, or at least not as <br>
&gt; much time.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I still want to post a tutorial for how I am going about BLD solving <br>
&gt; on my page, and add in all these tricks like pickup cycles and <br>
&gt; center and edge blocks and the like.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Anyway, would you be interested in writing a section about PAO?  Why <br>
&gt; have the site just have one method, when it can cover all of them?  <br>
&gt; Stefan, would you be interested in writing a section about your <br>
&gt; method and using a buffer and helper piece for the cycles?  Also you <br>
&gt; could post all the most efficient setup moves for each piece, etc..<br>
<br>
I am currently making a website dedicated to Blindfold solving but I<br>
may add more to it later (I feel like adding a speedcubing section<br>
would not be prudent since I myself cannot solve speedsolve one sub-20<br>
at the moment because I can&#x27;t bring myself to optimize F2L and learn<br>
OLL/PLL again).  It involves the PAO strategy and right now the 2x2<br>
and 3x3 sections are completed, with 4x4 and 5x5 sections coming up. <br>
I can show you the page so far if you can get on YM but I&#x27;d rather<br>
keep it on the down-low until it is completed, but I&#x27;d appreciate some<br>
insider advice!<br>
<br>
&gt; BLD cubing doesn&#x27;t seem as big as speed solving, but then again <br>
&gt; there are fewer resources for BLD cubing online, and I think that is <br>
&gt; a big reason why.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Do you guys want to change that?  I certainly do, or at least do my <br>
&gt; part to help change that.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Just my two cents again, or three lol.  These messages always get <br>
&gt; longer than intend when I first start.<br>
<br>
Precisely the reason why I started making the site -- there are not<br>
nearly as many 3x3 BLD resources, and the ones that exist are very lax<br>
with the pictures and explanations for all given cases.  Nothing wrong<br>
with long messages, btw :D<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris
   
  I really like the idea...can be very useful for my 3x3x3 BLD, since I (a lot) often forget one cycle...haha...
   
  if there are 2 cycles starting from different points, and I forget part of one, I just do the other and, after, search for the pieces that were not used...much like you...
   
  also, I memorise similar to you, like...
   
  usually starting from UF(1), then going 2 by 2, like 1 (3 5) (4 10) (6 8) or something (I&#x27;m trying to not use the numbers but they keep popping into my mind!!...haha)
   
  so, if I forget (3 5), I can just continue and go back at the end to find what&#x27;s missing...
   
  nice idea, man! I&#x27;ll surely try it

          Hey everyone,

I&#x27;ve been thinking about the problem of forgetting a cycle in the 
middle of a longer solve. This could happen on any size cube, 
assuming you are using the orient first and 3-cycles method. For 
Stefan&#x27;s approach this could be forgetting one single piece, or 
maybe 2 pieces in succession. This idea is probably more relevant 
to the bigger cubes, but I wanted to post since it still does relate 
to the 3x3, in case anyone is interested.

I&#x27;ve had solves on the 4x4 and 5x5 where I forgot only one single 
image, or as in my 4x4x4 BLD video for about 40 seconds I forgot two 
successive images. Each image for me is a 3 cycle, so I effectively 
forget only one or two single three cycles, but can still perfectly 
recall everything else.

What I usually do is to stop and count up all my letters (pieces) 
and see which are unused, and try to rebuild the image I&#x27;ve 
forgotten. This takes time obviously, and I&#x27;ve thought that maybe 
continuing solving and doing this at the same time would be better.

I&#x27;ve been working on this, and have decided to add this to my 
method. What it is, is to purposefully skip the forgotten cycle, 
and do everything else, then at the end you will have run through 
all your pieces or in my case letters, and can more easily recall 
which are unused.

This is a simple idea, and makes sense with just a little thought, 
but I&#x27;ve started practicing it to make it reflex, which I think will 
be a powerful addition to a blindfolded solving method.

It works like this, say I have the 24 cycle
(ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) for the edges on a 4x4 or 5x5 cube.

Now let&#x27;s say I forgot the image DE, or dentist. What I used to do 
is 1) freak out, followed by 2) try to go through the other images 
and add up all the letters until I find the ones I haven&#x27;t used, and 
eventually discover that D and E are free, allowing me to 
remember &quot;dentist&quot;.

What I say now is to do this:

The first three cycle is still available, so do the cycle (ABC) 
leaving

(ADEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX)

Of course I don&#x27;t know the upcoming cycle, so I would view it as:
(A??FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX)

Now I could take the time to go through each image and find that I 
am missing D and E, but this could take up to 40 seconds at least, 
probably around a minute on average. Why waste that time, when I 
can let the solving do the search for me? So I&#x27;ll skip my forgotten 
cycle and move on to the rest:

Now I do (AFG) since I know the next image after my forgotten one 
(here the DE image).

Looking at the original cycle (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX), I have now 
done (ABC) followed by (AFG)

This leaves the original cycle in the form
(FDE)(AHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX)

This is because after (ABC) I was supposed to send A to D, but I 
instead sent it to F for the (AFG) cycle. This means that the piece 
now in F goes to D. The piece that is in D needs to go to E. And 
because FG followed DE then the piece in E needed to go to F, which 
leaves me with a simple three cycle to pick up at the end.

So basically I continue as normal for the rest of the cycle 
(AHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX), and just remember that I have to do the cycle 
(F??) at the end, and the two question marks are the forgotten 
pieces, once I remember them to be DE I fill that cycle in as (FDE).

In general, if you forget a cycle, move on anyway. Then once you 
recall the two pieces of the forgotten cycle, use the first piece of 
the next cycle after your forgotten one as your first piece in 
the &quot;pick up&quot; cycle and do that 3 cycle to complete the cube.

So for images, I forget DE. DE was followed by FG so I moved on 
with (AFG). Then once I remember that DE is the forgotten cycle I 
look to my next image (FG) and take the first spot (F) and use it as 
the first piece of a 3 cycle, followed by the forgotten stuff, 
giving (FDE).

Again I don&#x27;t know how useful this will be to 3x3x3 BLD, but I can&#x27;t 
believe I never thought to do this for the bigger cubes, and it 
certainly is going to become my main technique for what to do if I 
forget an image, effectively if I forget a cycle.

---------

As to my 4x4x4 BLD video mistake, where I forgot two successive 
images for about 40 seconds, that&#x27;s like having 
(ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX) and forgetting the images BC and DE, so 
bicycle then dentist.

In my head I would have the cycle (A????FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVQWX)

So I would move on to (AFG) leaving the following permutation on my 
cube:
(FBCDE)(AHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX)

So I do the same. I forgot BC and DE, so I move on to the next one 
I remember, FG. I then continue as normal, remembering at the end 
to take the first letter of the image immediately after the ones I 
forgot, here F, and use it as the first piece followed by the 
forgotten stuff. So in my head I know I need to do (F????) at the 
end, and I fill in the unknowns as I discover unused pieces while 
solving the rest of the cycle. So I start with F and continue with 
BCDE once I remember that those are the missing letters. Once I&#x27;ve 
remembered BCDE I just add F to the start and do the cycle (FBCDE) 
and the cube will still solve.

-----------

Ok, I just wanted to post about this since I think it is a really 
good tool to have in the belt so to speak, and I can&#x27;t believe I 
never thought to try this before now. Again I know it is a simple 
idea, and probably pretty obvious, but I think it should be required 
to be part of the method for the bigger cubes, since it lets you 
continue solving after a forgotten cycle while *still* searching 
your mind for the forgotten pieces, rather than just wasting time 
not twisting and only thinking about what the forgotten pieces are.

Just my two cents,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">In Pochmann BLD, when you complete a cycle, that is the UR cubie comes 
to the UR position.  Then you can throw it out where ever.    for one 
you could orient permuted but misoriented edges, or you could do those 
at the end.  When you get a buffer cubie in the buffer area, you can 
choose any other cubie.  The easiest thing that try to do is swap a U 
edge, or the U/D face of a corner.

It should be the same in other methods, as long as you complete the 
last cycle before starting a new one, it shouldn&#x27;t matter what cycle 
you start.

You may have memorized (1,4,8) (2,12,11,5,3) (6,9,7,10)

you could very well solve (6,9,7,10) (1,4,8) (2,12,11,5,3)

right?  Even then you could begin a new cycle such as (1,4,11,5,3,2,
12,7,10,6,9,8)  I guess

But I don&#x27;t do 3 cycles, I&#x27;m working on a new method with Kyuubree.

If memory serves, besides doing a lot of public cubing, he also 
employed hypnosis.  I remember Dan competing in 3x3x3 blindfold in 
Toronto, and like 8 out of 10 of the competitors, he had a DNF for his 
one and only attempt.  Only Macky and Dror were successful in the 
preliminary round, and they both had a DNF in the one and only round 
of the finals.  So maybe the only real way to do well in high pressure 
blindfold solves is to do a lot of high pressure blindfold solves.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,<br>
<br>
A few things helped me to feel more confident about BLD under pressure <br>
(in public/in competition).  The most important thing for me was to do <br>
solves a LOT, and try to solve in public as much as possible when <br>
practicing.<br>
<br>
Also I would recommend doing lots of solves in a row, even if you are <br>
mentally tired and want to stop, do one more solve anyway.  That way <br>
in a competition if you are not yet ready for your next solve, but are <br>
called up anyway, you&#x27;ll be used to solving and not yet wanting to <br>
solve.<br>
<br>
Ironically, the thing that helped me the most to feel more confident <br>
about BLD solving in competition was to DNF in competition.  After <br>
DNF&#x27;ing enough times you sort of get this sense of redemption and you <br>
just can&#x27;t wait for your next shot at another solve to try to prove <br>
yourself, rather than thinking &quot;oh crap, I have to do a high pressure <br>
solve soon&quot; and getting nervous.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents.  I would say don&#x27;t fear the DNF, just get let it be <br>
a source of motivation if it happens, rather than something that gets <br>
you down.<br>

P.S.  Congrats on the sub-70 3x3x3 BLD solve!  That&#x27;s amazing, Keep it <br>

          <div class="email-content">One issue for me though was that when I cube in public, I wonder how
it must look? I mean most people obviously can&#x27;t solve a Rubik&#x27;s Cube,

if I look weird doing it in front of people in public? What kind of

Although those aren&#x27;t what bother me so much (I&#x27;m fine with DNF&#x27;s --
we all mess up, so what?) -- it&#x27;s just the focus aspect.  How do you
keep a clear head at a competition? How many people are actually
watching? Does it take time for you to shut out the external
noises/thoughts and focus solely on the cube itself? Thanks for the
advice and kind words!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; One issue for me though was that when I cube in public, I wonder <br>
how<br>
&gt; it must look? I mean most people obviously can&#x27;t solve a Rubik&#x27;s <br>
Cube,<br>
&gt; so when they see someone doing it, is it seen as showing off? I <br>
wonder<br>
&gt; if I look weird doing it in front of people in public? What kind of<br>
&gt; public settings do you cube at?<br>
<br>
I feel exactly the same way.  I always feel extraordinarily awkward <br>
when I cube in public, which is one of the main reasons I try to do <br>
it a lot, since it is not my comfortable computer room in my house <br>
where I usually practice.  I&#x27;ve always enjoyed hanging out at <br>
Starbucks when I hang out with friends, so I find that I am a little <br>
more comfortable there than other places when I do BLD in public.  <br>
When I am memorizing I sometimes get questions from people <br>
like &quot;What are you doing?&quot; or more often &quot;Have you solved it yet?&quot;.  <br>
Usually though no one bothers me because I appear pretty focused on <br>
whatever it is I appear to be doing, and they don&#x27;t want to interupt.<br>
<br>
When solving, and wearing the blindfold, you usually will hear <br>
people make comments the most.  Things like &quot;How does he do that?&quot; <br>
or &quot;That&#x27;s crazy!&quot;.  I always feel really awkward here because I <br>
don&#x27;t want to appear to be a showoff, I really am out for practice <br>
at controlling my nerves, so I just sort of keep solving and don&#x27;t <br>
say anything.  If anyone is standing there right as I solve, or DNF, <br>
I try to answer any questions if they ask me, but usually people <br>
don&#x27;t wait that long and have already left (I usually do the bigger <br>
cubes in public only).<br>
<br>
Try to answer any questions you get from people while you are <br>
memorizing, because that interuption is a HUGE distraction, and if <br>
you can pick right back up memorizing after answering it then you&#x27;re <br>
already more than prepared for any type of interuption you&#x27;ll get in <br>
competition.<br>
<br>
&gt; As for the DNF&#x27;s, I totally agree. <br>
&gt; Although those aren&#x27;t what bother me so much (I&#x27;m fine with DNF&#x27;s -<br>
-<br>
&gt; we all mess up, so what?) -- it&#x27;s just the focus aspect.  How do <br>
you<br>
&gt; keep a clear head at a competition? How many people are actually<br>
&gt; watching? Does it take time for you to shut out the external<br>
&gt; noises/thoughts and focus solely on the cube itself? Thanks for the<br>
&gt; advice and kind words!<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
I had a really hard time focusing in Georgia at the Chattahoochee <br>
competition when I was memorizing for the 5x5x5 and 4x4x4.  I think <br>
the reason was though that I wasn&#x27;t wearing any earplugs or <br>
earmuffs, so I could hear with perfect clarity anything anyone said <br>
around me, and that was very hard to tune out.  I now wear eaplugs <br>
and earmuffs any time I do a solve in competition, and that sort of <br>
puts you in your own quiet &quot;personal space&quot;.  You can still hear a <br>
low hum of activity, but nothing as distinctive as a single voice or <br>
conversation, so you can treat it like white noise and fairly <br>
successfully ignore it.  At least it has helped for me.  I use <br>
regular earplugs from Walmart, and the earmuffs are the ones I wear <br>
when I go to a firing range, so they are pretty heavy duty just by <br>
themselves.  The two together make sort of like my own quiet space <br>
in competition, so it makes it easier to focus.<br>
<br>
Yeah no problem, I hope this helps.  Sorry you couldn&#x27;t make it to <br>
Nationals :-( but I am very much looking forward to meeting you in <br>
person at a competition one day!  We should trade BLD tips or <br>
something heh heh, I&#x27;d be all for that, none of my method is a <br>
secret I&#x27;m ready to share what I know any time.  I&#x27;d also be really <br>
interested in seeing how you tackle a cube BLD in person, after <br>
seeing your times for it!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah if I do BLD in front of people I get similar comments (I only do<br>
the 3x3 in public though -- I&#x27;d imagine people don&#x27;t stick around all<br>
the time for the larger cubes.  Should I still give it a shot?). <br>
Recently I did a lot of practice solving in front of people at a<br>
summer job, but what always got to me is hearing people walk in and<br>
whisper comments to each other -- while complimentary -- still very<br>
much distracting.  It was a real bummer because the first solve I did<br>
was done correctly in front of a smaller group of about 5 people, then<br>
I had a HUGE group the second time and I DNF&#x27;d.  Gah. <br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll try to answer questions as I memorize... that&#x27;s good advice. <br>
Perhaps it would help to carry on a conversation with someone as its<br>
done? Have you ever done this for speedcubing? Hahah it used to blow<br>
people away when I&#x27;d be having this totally nonchalant conversation<br>
with someone as I solved the cube simultaneously -- it&#x27;s like &quot;Dude<br>
you&#x27;re not even really concentrating on that thing.&quot; :P <br>

&gt; I feel exactly the same way.  I always feel extraordinarily awkward <br>
&gt; when I cube in public, which is one of the main reasons I try to do <br>
&gt; it a lot, since it is not my comfortable computer room in my house <br>
&gt; where I usually practice.  I&#x27;ve always enjoyed hanging out at <br>
&gt; Starbucks when I hang out with friends, so I find that I am a little <br>
&gt; more comfortable there than other places when I do BLD in public.  <br>
&gt; When I am memorizing I sometimes get questions from people <br>
&gt; like &quot;What are you doing?&quot; or more often &quot;Have you solved it yet?&quot;.  <br>
&gt; Usually though no one bothers me because I appear pretty focused on <br>
&gt; whatever it is I appear to be doing, and they don&#x27;t want to interupt.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; When solving, and wearing the blindfold, you usually will hear <br>
&gt; people make comments the most.  Things like &quot;How does he do that?&quot; <br>
&gt; or &quot;That&#x27;s crazy!&quot;.  I always feel really awkward here because I <br>
&gt; don&#x27;t want to appear to be a showoff, I really am out for practice <br>
&gt; at controlling my nerves, so I just sort of keep solving and don&#x27;t <br>
&gt; say anything.  If anyone is standing there right as I solve, or DNF, <br>
&gt; I try to answer any questions if they ask me, but usually people <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi again...

At Nationals, I was re-inspired to try speed blindfold solving.  So, 
on the plane ride home, I attempted again...and succeeded!  This was 
on the 11th (Friday).
Anyway, my total time was 1 hour 33.14 seconds.  Actually a bit 
less, but I forgot to stop my watch timer for a minute or two.  The 
solving time was a mediocre 37.74 seconds, but I wanted to make sure 
I succeeded.  Next time I&#x27;ll find a better cross and go faster.

The scramble was D2 F2 L B&#x27; U B2 D L D R&#x27; L2 D2 B U2 R F R&#x27; F U&#x27; L2 
F D&#x27; R2 U&#x27; F2 with yellow on top, red on front.  I did a y2 and 
noticed a corner-edge pair sitting at DR/DFR.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out 
what to do with it, so I ignored it.  I decided on a cross L D&#x27; R&#x27; 
U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; L F2.  I then went to figure out what had become of that 
pair at DR/DFR by tracking it while imagining the effect of each 
move of the cross...and it turned out it was still connected, and 
could be solved with F2 R&#x27; F2 R!  So I modified my cross to [...]F&#x27; 
L R&#x27; F2 R.  Hmm, now it&#x27;s an extended cross, I guess.  Completely by 
chance, I found it.

I then used basically that procedure to find what I would do with 
the rest of my F2L pairs.  For red/green I did U&#x27; L U L&#x27;, for 
red/blue I did L&#x27; U&#x27; L R&#x27; U&#x27; R, and for green/orange I did (my 2nd 
least favorite F2L case) U2 L2 U2 L U L&#x27; U L2.  I figured this all 
out in about 20 minutes.

Then I started tracking my yellow edges through the F2L solution.  I 
pretty quickly found that the green and blue edges were swapped, and 
that the blue and orange edges were flipped.  Then I started messing 
up.  It took me just short of an hour to figure out the corners.  I 
almost put my blindfold on before I checked and found out I had made 
a mistake.  I checked all the corners, and figured out that, after 
the F2L, two were in the same spot.  That...doesn&#x27;t make sense.  So 
I looked at one of them and figured out it was actually in a 
different spot...which was already occupied.  By the time I 
straightened those three out, I had forgotten what was going on with 
the first corner I had done.  Then I checked the other three out 
again and got the same problem.  Eventually, I got a logical 
arrangement, which was that UB and UR were oriented, as was URF, and 
that the other 3 needed to be twisted clockwise.  It&#x27;s one of the 
lightning bolt thingies.  The back corners needed to be swapped, as 
did the right and left edges.  Basically an F-perm.  Just not 
everything was oriented yet.

So I started figuring out the effect of the OLL, which was going to 
be y2 F&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L U F y F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; y.  I recognized that that, if 
I did U2, the corner permutation should be the same as it is now.  
And I recognized that it did two edge 3-cycles, namely F->B->R and R-
>L->F.  Both of those are even permutations.  And then I would do an 
H permutation to it (F&lt;->B, L&lt;->R) when I did U2.  And there was an 
odd permutation of edges on the cube already (L&lt;->R).  So, I 
reasoned, after doing three even permutations on a cube with an 
odd permutation of edges, there would be an even permutation of 
edges.  Right?  I was completely stumped when I kept finding odd 
permutations of edges.  I nearly hit myself over the head when I 
realized how absolutely stupid I was to expect an even permutation.  
Anyways, I found that it was a J perm, so my permutation was y R U 
R&#x27; F&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27;.  Finally, I had a working solution!

So I sat there for two minutes before asking my dad to take a 
video.  If anyone wants to see it, I can put it online.  I started 
the timer...and blanked on the cross.  I remembered it, but it took 
me like 5-10 seconds.  The back left corner edge pair was fast, the 
next one was pretty quick.  The last one, I hesitated since I mess 
up on that case occasionally while looking.  I hesitated on OLL, but 
not on PLL.  Solving time: 37.74 seconds.

Next time I&#x27;m going to use your suggestions a bit more, since I 
don&#x27;t want the torture of figuring out the OLL to happen again.  And 
I want a faster solve next time.

Were it not almost 1 AM right now, &quot;next time&quot; would be now.  But 
i&#x27;m going to sleep...after a few magic solves.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I got a number of requests for a website about my big cubes BLD method<br>
at US Nationals.  I have already posted or written pretty much<br>
everything I would want to be on a site like that either on this forum<br>
or on the rubiks.has.it forum.  So, what I&#x27;ll do is gather all the<br>
information I spread around on those sites onto one site on my page. <br>
I also want to add an example solve to my memorization page that shows<br>
how I apply my images together at a location, rather than just the<br>
list of images I use.<br>
<br>
For anyone who is interested, this is the next thing I am working on<br>
for my site, and I hope to have it compiled and up soon.  If you&#x27;re<br>
interested in a method for the bigger cubes BLD, both memorization and<br>
solving, then keep checking back.  I&#x27;ll try to have it up soon.  I use<br>
the exact same method and same images for the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 BLD, and<br>
theoretically the 6x6x6 or larger too, so if you&#x27;re interested in big<br>
cube BLD at all you would only need to learn the one set of images and<br>
how to use them to be able to do it.<br>

  But, man I&#x27;m sorry man, (d2 l) isn&#x27;t all that bad of a setup move really for Pochmann.
   
  so reconsider how awful the move really is.

You could do (U2 R) (lefthanded-T) (R&#x27; U2).

confused at first but then I learned the alg in less than 2 minutes. 
It was so familiar it came naturally.  And the setup moves are
great... again a little confusing at first but everything in cubing is.

Back when I first was getting used to the 4x4x4 BLD with my old
storyline method I had 17 DNFs in a row, then 2 successful solves,
then 25 DNFs in a row over the course of almost a week.

2 for 44.... yeah.... I felt awesome...

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

I absolutely totally and completely know the feeling.  My worst ever
DNF, or the one I consider the worst, was one on 5x5x5 where all I had
to do to finish the cube was the parity alg on wing edges (I had done
the solve correctly up to this point).  The very final turn of the
parity alg it felt like I pulled not only the r2 but also the m layer.
 I undid the m layer turn the way I thought I had done it, and when I
opened my eyes the m layer was off by 1 quarter turn.  I had
apparently done m with the r2, and thought I did m2, so I undid with
m2 leaving me with the cube m&#x27; away from solved. o_O

Needless to say I was the very slightest bit pissed off with myself
the rest of that day lol.

On a lighter note though my image for the letter pair &quot;DQ&quot; is
DisQualified, and is a picture of that 5x5x5 cube I DNF&#x27;d that day :-D

Yeah I&#x27;m really that slow sometimes, I was an m turn away from solved<br>

<br>
Anyway Stefan, no worries man, just practice those algs a lot as<br>
drills.  I seriously must have done the parity alg on 5x5x5 with my<br>
eyes closed about 50 times as punishment for having messed it up like<br>
that, but now I don&#x27;t mess it up blindfolded anymore.  I think it<br>
takes a painful DNF to perfectly cement an alg for slow BLD solving<br>
that is one that messes up occasionaly.<br>

I remember the 17 DNFs, then the 2 good solves, then the 25 DNFs after

          <div class="email-content">Ohhhh you&#x27;re really gonna love this then... my DNF&#x27;s were on the
3x3x3.  Not even the bigger cubes.  The measly 3x3x3! I&#x27;m pretty sure
I kept messing up EP on like every single solve (EP is the hardest for
me -- if my EP is slow, the whole solve is slow).  I only know two
edge cycling algorithms and so I have to be very careful about setup
moves and how I rotate the cube, and so if I try to go too fast I mess
up.  Every single time I tried to complete a solve I&#x27;d open my eyes
and just see a big mess (many times, though, the corners were solved,
but other times they were botched too, probably meaning I messed up a
setup move).  Just so aggravating :/

Had some successful solves this morning though so I feel a bit better
:) Slowed down on the EP and made sure the setups were correct. 
Knowing better algs might help a bit.  Currently I&#x27;m trying to
overhaul my approach to memorization (trying to approach it similar to
Tyson and Leyan) but it&#x27;s taking some getting used to.  However I do
feel it would be faster in the long run.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Dave,<br>
<br>
Thanks for the kudos.  My memorization techniques (as well as<br>
Leyan&#x27;s/Tyson&#x27;s) relies on groups of patterns, I think.  Like looking<br>
for chunks of corners that can be flipped with a single alg, or other<br>
chunks of 4/5, etc.  Tyson had mentioned to me that he plans out his<br>
execution for EP, so I&#x27;m trying to go this route currently but it&#x27;s<br>
giving me issues/hard to get used to.<br>
<br>
How fast is your current memorization/what is your technique/approach?<br>
For EO, for example, I approach it with a Binary method (converting to<br>
three letters for easy memory).  CP and EP are a little trickier... I<br>
wish there were a really fast and easy way to memorize them and<br>
execute the algs needed in a braindead fashion.<br>
<br>
As for the 1:08 solve, the memorization and execution were both easy.<br>
For instance, the CP path was virtually a simple cube wrap-around<br>
spiral.  There was no parity error and the EP was full of fast<br>
executions that were easy to set up.  It was mainly just an easy but<br>
not lucky scramble.<br>

&gt; memorize closer to 20 sec consistently, so always open for help.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; :) Slowed down on the EP and made sure the setups were correct. <br>
&gt; &gt; Knowing better algs might help a bit.  Currently I&#x27;m trying to<br>
&gt; &gt; overhaul my approach to memorization (trying to approach it similar to<br>
&gt; &gt; Tyson and Leyan) but it&#x27;s taking some getting used to.  However I do<br>
&gt; &gt; feel it would be faster in the long run.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; What do they do?  And how is it different from what you do?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Btw, looks like not many of the top guys post to the UWR; too bad, <br>
&gt; thought it was kinda fun.  Oh well.<br>

&gt;&gt; How fast is your current memorization/what is your <br>
technique/approach?<br>
<br>
Not very fast.  Usually around 35, give or take.  I&#x27;d be happy with 25 <br>
sec consistently.  But that&#x27;d be pushing it with my current Carr <br>
system.  I assume most non-Pochmann solvers solve either CO or EO <br>
first.  I do CO first, since it&#x27;s hardest for me too memorize.  I try <br>
to plan the moves out, but often this gives me trouble- especially when <br>
there are say, 6 to orient- and takes too much time memorizing.  I <br>
memorize EO second to last, and solve it second.  I often take too much <br>
time memorizing it also.<br>
<br>
For those tracking cycles for the perms, I wonder how they recall <br>
them.  Do they say to themselves, &quot;3-cycle curving left&quot;, or some such <br>
thing; do they just picture the cycles?  How do they remember pairs <br>
that need swapping?  Do they use a phonetic system?  It seems very <br>
difficult to memorize quickly, tracking around the cube, with cycles <br>
starting and stopping.  My numerous attempts have been failures.  If I <br>
could figure out a good way to memorize, I could see how the solving <br>
might be fast, many times.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just rambling, wondering how to get faster.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Dave,<br>
<br>
A while back I posted a diagram showing my CO method -- you&#x27;ll find <br>
that in many cases, you can limit the entire step to 7 algorithms <br>
(it is easy to spot a Sune on the color you&#x27;re used to, for <br>
instance, but such cases can also show up on the sides in less <br>
obvious forms).  You normally would check U/D for these 7 cases, and <br>
if nothing&#x27;s good there, then you would check F/B, then L/R, etc.  <br>
If nothing good comes up, usually imagining a turn of D/D&#x27;/D2 will <br>
allow you to find something to work with.  It sounds like a lot to <br>
take in but you&#x27;ll find that it becomes pretty quick with time.  <br>
Instead of memorizing a bunch of corner numbers/positions you simply <br>
remember something like &quot;Sune up the left, Cowskull down the right&quot; <br>
which means holding the cube so L is now U and D is now F, and doing <br>
a Sune, then rerotating the cube so U is now F and R is now U, and <br>
doing a Cowskull algorithm.  Makes for a quick and painless <br>
memorization.  <br>
<br>
I personally do CO first although I solve it first... not very <br>
efficient but I&#x27;m used to it, so I tend to stick with it.  I may <br>
change this approach so that I execute EO/EP first because it&#x27;s the <br>
hardest for me to memorize EP.  EO is actually quite easy to <br>
memorize -- just go Binary Method.  I truly don&#x27;t think it gets much <br>
easier than that.  You just churn out three letters and then you&#x27;ve <br>
got the orientation layout for the edges.  When solving, it&#x27;s fairly <br>
easy to execute, especially if there are only 4 or so edges needing <br>
flipping.  It gets a little trickier if you&#x27;re flipping 6, but <br>
sometimes it&#x27;s faster to do a 4flip followed by a 2 flip.  It&#x27;s <br>
really a case by case basis.<br>
<br>
How do you memorize EP? I used to use a sort of PAO system but it <br>
has its limits in terms of speed, although it makes the cycles stick <br>
with the memory longer (ie. less DNF&#x27;s).  Sometimes just memorizing <br>
a rote path is sufficient (although fast, I hate how unreliable it <br>
is in terms of consistency when actually solving), but I really hate <br>
EP and would love a better way to do it.  I&#x27;ve tried phonetic <br>
systems with little luck (either that or I choose poorly when it <br>
comes to what sounds/letters to use).  EP sucks sucks sucks :(<br>
<br>
I think stuff like &quot;three cycle curving left&quot; is the sort of <br>
approach Tyson uses, but don&#x27;t quote me on that, because I am not <br>
100% sure.  Do you memorize CP in the same manner as EP? I&#x27;m trying <br>
to create a new permutation approach by using grouping (ie. algs <br>
that split things into fewer cases such that they are easier to <br>
solve with fewer algs), but this is not turning out so great yet.  <br>
Anyways, hope to hear back soon!<br>

23.61 DNF - I tried my solution afterwards, exactly as I executed it,<br>
and it solved the cube, so I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong this time. <br>
Memorisation time: 55 minutes (ish)<br>

Haha, you gotta love not having to rescramble the cube to type up the<br>

quickly.<br>

OLL: R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; (:D this was nice, when I was inspecting and saw<br>
2 corners I was like, yes, this is gunna be sune or Pi, most likely<br>
sune, then I did the 3rd corner, and it was oriented right, so I knew<br>
it was sune :D)<br>
PLL: R2 u R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; R u&#x27; R2 y&#x27; R&#x27; U R<br>
<br>
If anyone is interested in how I do this, please let me know.  This<br>
solve I actually looked at each F2L pair as a possibility to execute<br>
at any given time.  The memo took forever on PLL because I was looking<br>
at the edges all wrong.  In the scramble (after I did the y&#x27; at the<br>
beginning) the colours were RED ORANGE on F AND B and Blue and Green<br>
on L and R the OLL had Red and Orange on F and B and Green and Blue on<br>
L and R.  So I kept looking at it wrong and the corners for some<br>
reason I kept telling myself was a 2 cycle, duh I&#x27;m stupid :D<br>
<br>
Anyways, I will go again, hopefully get a sub-50 memo time, and a<br>
successful solve, because it bothers me that I&#x27;ve done it right each<br>
time, except not.  This one I actually don&#x27;t know what I did wrong, it<br>
may have been that on Pair 2 I did an extra set of R U&#x27; R&#x27; U but I<br>
have no idea.<br>

<br>
&gt; A while back I posted a diagram showing my CO method -- you&#x27;ll find <br>
&gt; that in many cases, you can limit the entire step to 7 algorithms <br>
&gt; (it is easy to spot a Sune on the color you&#x27;re used to, for <br>
&gt; instance, but such cases can also show up on the sides in less <br>
&gt; obvious forms).  You normally would check U/D for these 7 cases, <br>
and <br>
&gt; if nothing&#x27;s good there, then you would check F/B, then L/R, etc.  <br>
&gt; If nothing good comes up, usually imagining a turn of D/D&#x27;/D2 will <br>
&gt; allow you to find something to work with.  It sounds like a lot to <br>
&gt; take in but you&#x27;ll find that it becomes pretty quick with time.  <br>
&gt; Instead of memorizing a bunch of corner numbers/positions you <br>
simply <br>
&gt; remember something like &quot;Sune up the left, Cowskull down the right&quot; <br>
&gt; which means holding the cube so L is now U and D is now F, and <br>
doing <br>
&gt; a Sune, then rerotating the cube so U is now F and R is now U, and <br>
&gt; doing a Cowskull algorithm.  Makes for a quick and painless <br>
&gt; memorization.  <br>
<br>
Do you still have the diagram up?  I looked at it back then, but I <br>
may be too dense too use it; anyhow, it seems faster than what I am <br>
doing, so I should look at it again.  <br>
<br>
I do the CO in one move- with setups of course- but often this takes <br>
too long to memorize the moves.  So maybe doing it your way would be <br>
faster.   <br>
<br>
&gt;EO is actually quite easy to <br>
&gt; memorize -- just go Binary Method.  I truly don&#x27;t think it gets <br>
much <br>
&gt; easier than that.  You just churn out three letters and then you&#x27;ve <br>
&gt; got the orientation layout for the edges.  When solving, it&#x27;s <br>
fairly <br>
&gt; easy to execute, especially if there are only 4 or so edges needing <br>
&gt; flipping.  It gets a little trickier if you&#x27;re flipping 6, but <br>
&gt; sometimes it&#x27;s faster to do a 4flip followed by a 2 flip.  It&#x27;s <br>
&gt; really a case by case basis.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I agree you have a good method for EO.  Mine is similar I <br>
guess, going layer by layer, using a phonetic system.  It&#x27;s just that <br>
sometimes I take too long to notice the unoriented edges.  The cases <br>
where 8 or 10 are flipped are also a pain for me. <br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; How do you memorize EP? I used to use a sort of PAO system but it <br>
&gt; has its limits in terms of speed, although it makes the cycles <br>
stick <br>
&gt; with the memory longer (ie. less DNF&#x27;s).  Sometimes just memorizing <br>
&gt; a rote path is sufficient (although fast, I hate how unreliable it <br>
&gt; is in terms of consistency when actually solving), but I really <br>
hate <br>
&gt; EP and would love a better way to do it.  I&#x27;ve tried phonetic <br>
&gt; systems with little luck (either that or I choose poorly when it <br>
&gt; comes to what sounds/letters to use).  EP sucks sucks sucks :(<br>
<br>
I agree, EP sucks.  I use Carr&#x27;s system, so I use a phonetic system, <br>
memorizing the edges in their starting positions.  I posted a <br>
detailed description not too long ago if you&#x27;re interested.  The main <br>
problem is it takes too long too solve.  I agree with what you&#x27;ve <br>
written above about EP cycles; I just couldn&#x27;t memorize it well <br>
enough.  I can&#x27;t seem to remember by rote methods, and couldn&#x27;t come <br>
up with a phonetic way that was fast.  <br>
 <br>
&gt; I think stuff like &quot;three cycle curving left&quot; is the sort of <br>
&gt; approach Tyson uses, but don&#x27;t quote me on that, because I am not <br>
&gt; 100% sure.  Do you memorize CP in the same manner as EP? <br>
<br>
I posted in detail about the CP a while ago too.  Look for &#x27;corners <br>
in 2&#x27; or some such title.  Memorization goes pretty fast, but solving <br>
can be hard.  I&#x27;m always looking for a faster solving system. <br>
<br>
Having watched a bunch of videos, it&#x27;s funny how much slower my hands <br>
are in solving; I wish I were as fast as some other guys.<br>

  Third Try...

  23.61 DNF - I tried my solution afterwards, exactly as I executed it,
  and it solved the cube, so I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong this time. 
  Memorisation time: 55 minutes (ish)

  Scramble: D B2 R&#x27; B&#x27; D2 U2 L2 R2 D B2 R&#x27; U2 B2 D&#x27; L U2 L F2 D L&#x27; R&#x27; B2
  R2 F&#x27; L2

  Yellow on U Green on F

  Haha, you gotta love not having to rescramble the cube to type up the
  solution :D When I was planning the cross I noticed the Xcross quite
  quickly.
  Solve:
  X-Cross: y&#x27; R&#x27; D F&#x27; L B&#x27; L2 D2
  Pair 2: x&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U x
  Pair 3: y U L&#x27; U L U&#x27; L&#x27; U L
  Pair 4: y U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U2 y&#x27; L U L&#x27;
  OLL: R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; (:D this was nice, when I was inspecting and saw
  2 corners I was like, yes, this is gunna be sune or Pi, most likely
  sune, then I did the 3rd corner, and it was oriented right, so I knew
  it was sune :D)
  PLL: R2 u R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; R u&#x27; R2 y&#x27; R&#x27; U R

  If anyone is interested in how I do this, please let me know. This
  solve I actually looked at each F2L pair as a possibility to execute
  at any given time. The memo took forever on PLL because I was looking
  at the edges all wrong. In the scramble (after I did the y&#x27; at the
  beginning) the colours were RED ORANGE on F AND B and Blue and Green
  on L and R the OLL had Red and Orange on F and B and Green and Blue on
  L and R. So I kept looking at it wrong and the corners for some
  reason I kept telling myself was a 2 cycle, duh I&#x27;m stupid :D

  Anyways, I will go again, hopefully get a sub-50 memo time, and a
  successful solve, because it bothers me that I&#x27;ve done it right each
  time, except not. This one I actually don&#x27;t know what I did wrong, it
  may have been that on Pair 2 I did an extra set of R U&#x27; R&#x27; U but I
  have no idea.

          <div class="email-content">Dave,

Here is a link to the diagram:

http://tinyurl.com/r7vrc

I apologize in advance -- let me know if anything doesn&#x27;t make sense
at all.  I admit it could be clearer, but just let me know if the
concept isn&#x27;t explained well enough.

As for figuring out which edges are flipped in EO, I think it&#x27;s just a
matter of experience.  Soon you can instantly spot a bad edge if the
F/B color is on the U or D faces or along the horizontals of L or R,
or if the U/D color is on the F/B faces or along the verticals of L or
R (assuming you choose L and R for your fullturn faces during EP
setup).  Since you are going to be looking over all the edges anyway,
it doesn&#x27;t make a difference how many edges are bad for memorization
-- it should be roughly the same speed each time since the conversion
process takes the same amount of time for each case.  The only
difference should obviously be that it can take longer to solve more
edges in execution.

Do you have a link to the EP/CP method? I&#x27;m not able to find it on
this board. :( Do you have any videos online? I hear you on that
handspeed thing... I don&#x27;t know how some guys do it.  My cube locks up
when I get to high speed but I think it&#x27;s just that I have poor
technique.  Anyways I&#x27;d appreciate it if you can find the explanations
-- I&#x27;ll keep looking, however.

Have you tried PAO for EP at all? I think it can be a good approach
too (sometimes though you even forget the memory hooks! At least, at a
speed to be competitive for 3x3 BLD solving.  For bigger cubes I think
it&#x27;s the way to go).

Very very interesting approach... I&#x27;ll give this a try and get back later.<br>
<br>
As for my own permutation, if you are interested, I used the &quot;Tinshard<br>
L&quot; approach, associating corners 2-8 with t n s h r d and l (usually<br>
corner 1 isn&#x27;t solved so I don&#x27;t really give it a letter.  If it is<br>
solved then it takes little extra effort to start at corner 2 or 3,<br>
etc).  But then instead of memorizing a cycle like (1 4 5 2 3) it<br>
might be (Starting-corner s h t n) and I&#x27;d think &quot;Shittin!&quot; or<br>
something, and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;d need.<br>

That is the link to the video of me doing it.  In the video you see me
reset the timer, that is because I wasn&#x27;t sure if the timer was on, so
I had to check.

23.61 DNF - I tried my solution afterwards, exactly as I executed it,
and it solved the cube, so I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong this time. 
Memorisation time: 55 minutes (ish)

Haha, you gotta love not having to rescramble the cube to type up the
solution :D When I was planning the cross I noticed the Xcross quite
quickly.
Solve:
X-Cross: y&#x27; R&#x27; D F&#x27; L B&#x27; L2 D2
Pair 2: x&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U x
Pair 3: y U L&#x27; U L U&#x27; L&#x27; U L
Pair 4: y U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U2 y&#x27; L U L&#x27;
OLL: R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; (:D this was nice, when I was inspecting and saw
2 corners I was like, yes, this is gunna be sune or Pi, most likely
sune, then I did the 3rd corner, and it was oriented right, so I knew
it was sune :D)
PLL: R2 u R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; R u&#x27; R2 y&#x27; R&#x27; U R

If anyone is interested in how I do this, please let me know. This
solve I actually looked at each F2L pair as a possibility to execute
at any given time. The memo took forever on PLL because I was looking
at the edges all wrong. In the scramble (after I did the y&#x27; at the
beginning) the colours were RED ORANGE on F AND B and Blue and Green
on L and R the OLL had Red and Orange on F and B and Green and Blue on
L and R. So I kept looking at it wrong and the corners for some
reason I kept telling myself was a 2 cycle, duh I&#x27;m stupid :D

Anyways, I will go again, hopefully get a sub-50 memo time, and a
successful solve, because it bothers me that I&#x27;ve done it right each
time, except not. This one I actually don&#x27;t know what I did wrong, it
may have been that on Pair 2 I did an extra set of R U&#x27; R&#x27; U but I
have no idea.

Thanks for the diagram link, and glad you found my old posts.  <br>
However, since you&#x27;re solving in 1:08, I don&#x27;t recommend switching <br>
methods :).    <br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; As for my own permutation, if you are interested, I used <br>
the &quot;Tinshard<br>
&gt; L&quot; approach, associating corners 2-8 with t n s h r d and l (usually<br>
&gt; corner 1 isn&#x27;t solved so I don&#x27;t really give it a letter.  If it is<br>
&gt; solved then it takes little extra effort to start at corner 2 or 3,<br>
&gt; etc).  But then instead of memorizing a cycle like (1 4 5 2 3) it<br>
&gt; might be (Starting-corner s h t n) and I&#x27;d think &quot;Shittin!&quot; or<br>
&gt; something, and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;d need.<br>
<br>
Sounds like a great approach, and fast no doubt.<br>
<br>
PAO for EP should work if you can deal with the leftover edges when a <br>
cycle ends; I tried using just objects, but it was the starting and <br>
stopping of cycles that I couldn&#x27;t seem to deal with.  I might <br>
experiment memorizing and solving in different orders again.<br>
<br>
Sorry, I don&#x27;t have any videos. <br>

It&#x27;s not like I solve in that time regularly! Haha, that was just a<br>
very good solve with smooth execution.<br>

Yeah I agree -- the ending of cycles is always a real bummer,<br>
primarily if there are an even number of elements in a cycle.  When I<br>
was trying PAO I used a null object to represent a premature ending of<br>
a cycle, so (a c) might be Angelina Jolie cursing at a zebra.  The<br>
zebra begins with &quot;z&quot; so it obviously wouldn&#x27;t be confused with<br>
another corner/edge as there aren&#x27;t 26 of them, but it would show you<br>
that you&#x27;re dealing with (ac) and not something like (acz).  But<br>
regardless it&#x27;s tricky to deal with in a short amount of time because<br>
you must also either find another even-elemented cycle to mess with or<br>
two corners to finish the cube.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m inspired by your CP approach... I am beginning to think there&#x27;s a<br>
way to do CP without thinking about cycles or complex memory hooks. <br>
Do you get on Yahoo messenger at all?<br>
<br>
Anyways thanks for the insight!<br>

          <div class="email-content">One of my goals for 2006 is to get a successful BLD solve on the <br>
4x4.  I just ended my 7th attempt or so...and I was soooo close to <br>
being my first successful solve.  The time was 49:20.04 (30 min <br>
memorizing, 15 min solving is how most of my solves go--this one was <br>
about that), which is about average for me.  I&#x27;m not looking for <br>
speed now--I&#x27;m just trying to get one done.  Usually I make a <br>
mistake in execution and it looks like it was freshly scrambled, or <br>
like someone had just solved the centers.  This time, I ended up a 3-<br>
cycle of edges from solved.  The worst part is that it was the very <br>
last 3-cycle that i did wrong.<br>
<br>
The scramble was l B2 l&#x27; d&#x27; l2 F R&#x27; D&#x27; d l&#x27; b d2 L2 l&#x27; D2 r&#x27; R2 d&#x27; U <br>
R&#x27; F&#x27; d&#x27; l&#x27; d&#x27; U2 B2 b&#x27; F&#x27; D2 F&#x27; r2 B r&#x27; d2 B2 d l&#x27; U2 f2 d&#x27; (multi-<br>
slice with white on U, red on F which is how I always solve it).  I <br>
did x&#x27; y2 so that I had 2 white centers and 2 green centers solved, <br>
plus some other stuff.  I did the centers first without a problem.  <br>
Then I did the corners, orienting and permuting with no problem.  <br>
Then I started the edges.  It was a 24-cycle, starting with UFr and <br>
ending with ULb.  So I got to the end of the cycle (still no <br>
mistakes) and I had to do UFr &lt;--&gt; ULb.  Darn parity!  So i decided, <br>
okay, i&#x27;ll do UFr --&gt; ULb --&gt;UFl and then do the pure OLL parity.  <br>
So I did l2 r&#x27; D2 r U&#x27; r&#x27; D2 r U l2 and the OLL parity.  and that&#x27;s <br>
where my mistake was.  That cycle did UFr --&gt; ULf --&gt; UFl instead of <br>
the desired effect, so it switched UFr with ULf.  Therefore, when I <br>
took off the blindfold, there was a 3-cycle of edges.<br>
<br>
I know exactly what I did wrong.  I know how I should have done it <br>
(r2 l D2 l&#x27; U&#x27; l D2 l&#x27; U r2).  I knew all of that the second that I <br>
took my blindfold off.  It&#x27;s just so frustrating to be that close to <br>
a successful solve but not get it.  I&#x27;m going to try again today, <br>
and I really hope that I get it this time!<br>

If you learn (l&#x27; U2) (l&#x27; U2) x (U2 l&#x27;) (U2 r) x&#x27; (U2 r&#x27;) (U2 l2) then 
you&#x27;re more flexible. Your case would&#x27;ve just needed setup moves FUF&#x27;.

Hi Tim,

I feel your pain.  The same thing happened to me when
going for my first 5x5x5 supercube.  It is indeed a
very frustrating experence.  On the other hand such an
experience leaves NO DOUBT that you can do a
successful solve - you are clearly already capable all
you need is a nice clean execution.

You might want to practice doing a few different
parities blind on a solved cube just to get a strong
feel for that potentially last but crucial move.

Apart from that all I can say is don&#x27;t get discouraged
and really keep your focus and concentration at all
times for your next attempt.  I am sure that you will
have a successful run soon.

Rob

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I had a really fun solve on the 4x4x4 BLD just now, and wanted to share.<br>
<br>
I use center block cycles really often on the big cubes to speed up<br>
solving and memorizing, and this was a really cool solve as far as the<br>
center blocks go.<br>
<br>
The scramble was:<br>
b2 R&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; F r&#x27; B&#x27; L2 b2 D2 l D2 R2 L b f R&#x27; B2 F2 l2 f l&#x27; u d r&#x27; B2<br>
d U2 b l2 D2 r d2 r&#x27; U b2 L r2 B&#x27; d2<br>
<br>
After the scramble I always rotate the cube to maximize solved centers<br>
as well as center blocks.  The rotation I did was z, or if you don&#x27;t<br>
prefer xyz notation I rotated the entire cube as I would do the move F<br>
<br>
After the scramble and the z rotation I now have an amazing setup.<br>
<br>
I always solve viewing the cube to end with yellow on top and green on<br>
front.<br>
<br>
According to my solved scheme I have 10 centers already in the correct<br>
location without center blocks after that cube rotation.<br>
<br>
These pieces are lbU, lfU, ruF, ufL, buR, bdR, luB, lfD, rfD, rbD<br>
<br>
Including the way I am going to do center blocks there are 7 more<br>
pieces already considered in the correct spot (though I will need to<br>
cycle them later as blocks).<br>
<br>
These 7 extra pieces are:<br>
1) Partial block pieces: dbL<br>
2) Already formed blocks: (luF+ldF), (fuR+fdR), (ruB+rdB)<br>
<br>
I will cycle the center pieces individually like this first<br>
<br>
rbU-&gt;buL-&gt;rfU-&gt;ruF-&gt;dfL-&gt;ldB-&gt;lbD<br>
<br>
And that&#x27;s the extent of my individual center pieces cycling!!  I<br>
already consider 17 centers to be solved including block pieces, so my<br>
cycle is only 7 pieces long!<br>
<br>
After cycling the centers in that fashion I will have created 2 block<br>
cycles.<br>
<br>
The block cycles are:<br>
1) (luF+ldF)&lt;-&gt;(dbL+dfL)<br>
2) (ruF+rdF)-&gt;(fuR+fdR)-&gt;(ruB+rdB)<br>
<br>
As far as memorizing this whole setup, it only took 2 journey locations!<br>
<br>
My single centers cycle that solves any single pieces, and sets up one<br>
block was:<br>
rbU-&gt;buL-&gt;rfU-&gt;ruF-&gt;dfL-&gt;ldB-&gt;lbD<br>
<br>
This converts to<br>
A-&gt;Q-&gt;D-&gt;F-&gt;T-&gt;P-&gt;U = Dan Aykroyd-&gt;Quidditch-&gt;Boba Fett-&gt;The Punisher<br>
<br>
And my image was Dan Aykroyd admiring a Quidditch players skills when<br>
suddenly Boba Fett shoots the gold scarab out of the air with his<br>
blaster.  The punisher then puts his gun around Boba Fett&#x27;s neck to<br>
try to choke him (I imagine the Punisher is mad Boba Fett screwed with<br>
the Quidditch game, since he&#x27;s a fan).<br>
<br>
The center blocks were at my next journey location and I had<br>
<br>
1) (luF+ldF)&lt;-&gt;(dbL+dfL)<br>
2) (ruF+rdF)-&gt;(fuR+fdR)-&gt;(ruB+rdB)<br>
<br>
Which converts to:<br>
1) F&lt;-&gt;T = Boba Fett<br>
2) G-&gt;J-&gt;N = Tom Greene-&gt;Juggernaut (from X-men)<br>
<br>
And my image at that location was Boba Fett standing next to Tom<br>
Greene, who was messing around with Juggernaut from X-men trying to<br>
piss him off (bad idea) lol.<br>
<br>
Anyway I just thought that was a cool solve, having that many blocks<br>
in addition to lots of already correctly solved pieces was pretty cool<br>
and made for a fun solve.<br>
<br>
The time on that solve was 10 minutes 0.05 seconds!!  Aaaaah!!!  If<br>
only I had done that stupid edge parity alg just a bit faster lol. <br>
Still the awesome center blocks are worth the allllllllmost sub-10 but<br>
not quite.  Total time to memorize the cube was 5:33.xx so the solving<br>
took 4:26.xx probably, which is a little faster than average for my<br>
solving phase (I love center blocks!!!) :-D<br>
<br>
Anyway that was just a fun solve, and in case anyone was still unsure<br>
of whether using block cycles is a good idea or not, I thought I would<br>
give an example to illustrate why I think blocks are so amazing ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

Thanks for the words of encouragement; I&#x27;m pleased to say that after 
>10 DNF&#x27;s, I have finally succeeded!

I spent about 22 minutes memorizing, which is relatively fast for 
me.  What usually happens is that centers take about 3-5 minutes, 
corners take about that long (to avoid mistakes), and edges take ~10 
minutes.  My total time was 40:52.66, which is I think my second 
fastest time--I had one DNF less than 40 minutes.

The scramble was l U b2 d&#x27; l D u2 r b2 U l R2 u&#x27; B2 l2 d2 l d2 F2 d2 
B&#x27; L&#x27; l&#x27; R&#x27; d2 L b&#x27; d U&#x27; F2 D R B2 u&#x27; f&#x27; D B D b2 l&#x27; (multi-slice, 
white on U, red on F which is how I always scramble + solve).  I 
rotated y&#x27; z&#x27; to maximize solved centers.

Thanks a lot, Stefan, for the parity alg: I used it in this solve.  
Thanks, Chris, for the motivation.  Thanks, Rob and Craig, for the 
words of encouragement.

Well, I gotta go.  I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be trying the 5x5 pretty 
soon...

          <div class="email-content">You know setups aren&#x27;t all that annoying

As I said before I was able to do a few successful 2x Indirect solves

1x Indirect could be very very fast
2 setup moves R?B&#x27; and L?B or Nothing for the edges if we were to 
target UB
L?D or R?D&#x27; if targeting the DF  
*These two targets have different EO definitions*

Using DF as the target and you have a &quot;misoriented edge&quot;
Sets would be
FL?F&#x27;
F&#x27;R?F

still not a bad comprimise!

I don&#x27;t know what to tell you about if you target the UB directly.  
That&#x27;s sorta confusing.

I also developed a &quot;simple 2 look EO&quot;
This would entail Setting the UE layers to a known case, performing 
an alg, then rotating the D layer to the top and orienting the last 
D layer then resetoring the cube

Setups for 2 Look EO would entail 3 moves to setup max, then 
reseting after performing both algorithms.

Also I&#x27;m going to try and finish generating a Direct 3-cycle CP 
method that uses a lot of short algorithms.

The system is 9 algs
but that quadruples to 36 when you take into account inverses, 
reflections, and reflected inverses.  If I learn all 36 algs, I can 
permute 2 corners per alg and only two move setups!

These two algs will flip the piece going to the UB and the piece 
coming out of the UB.  That is if UB is the target.

Umm 2 extra moves for for sets and resets -vs- 4 extra odd ball 
moves.  Indirect solving would be better than those ugly algs!

What are your thoughts on a large BLD system.

I&#x27;m talking about 36 algs for CP.  It&#x27;s all based on 9 algs that 
cycle three corners, but to optimize setups, you need the inverses, 
reflections, and inverted reflections.

I&#x27;m also working on images for the 3x3x3 atm.  I&#x27;ve got them, I just 
need to apply them to cubing.

          <div class="email-content">Okay, so targeting DF gives less setup moves. I still hate doing the
four setup moves for targeting DF when it&#x27;s flipped so:

UB>FD: z F L&#x27;R U&#x27; R&#x27;2 U LR&#x27; F&#x27; R2 z&#x27;
UF>FD: z R2 F L&#x27;R U&#x27; R2 U LR&#x27; F&#x27; z&#x27;

You don&#x27;t really need those, I just hate setup moves :P

I&#x27;m already getting around 4 minute times with CO,CP,Direct EP, and I
normally do around 3:30 for direct EP Pochmann style.

          <div class="email-content">The great thing about learning your own work is ... its yours and it 
sticks to you.  I hate learning OLL and PLL, it takes forever.  But 
every algorithm I learned for BLD that I made, I still know and can 
use.  If I can think of it all as PLL or F2L algs which I my 
reflections can flow very nicely for, this will be great.  Inverses 
won&#x27;t be much harder.

If I can find the time to learn them, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll know them very 
quickly, just as I did w/ my 12 Simul Block algs, sadly that method 
just didn&#x27;t work!   

James, lemme know how direct solving works for you.  I&#x27;m going to be 
working on BLD most of the weekend.  So I&#x27;ll probablly have all 12 
SB algs at my finger tips, be solving w/ Roux Cycles, and I&#x27;ll 
probablly have 9 CP algs memorized.  And this system is meant as a 
Pochmann based method, you&#x27;re gonna keep the same buffer areas 
throughout the whole solve.

So, if CP and Roux Cycles work as I hope
I&#x27;ll use 54 algorithms 
.3 Roux Cycles - Applicable
.3 2-Cycle CP - In Use
.3 2-Cycle EP - In Use
.9 Progressive Parity Fixing Algs - Applicable
.36 3-Cycle CP - Not Ready
.43 images - Applicable

I&#x27;ve applied &quot;Applicables&quot; but not quickly
Using 6 Algs, I can solve sub 6 BLD now.

          <div class="email-content">I know it does have a different effect.

However, by using the proper setup and M&#x27;U2MU2 (or is it U2M&#x27;U2M?) I 
can achieve the same result as the alg we just generated.  I know 
what you did, and that it is the same algorithm.  I&#x27;m just impressed 
that you looked for it at that angle, the difference in Turn metrics 
is what set the two apart.  I&#x27;d rather do a different setup than use 
a longer alg.

Just like if you want to target the F face of FL do:
l&#x27; T-Perm l
L Face of FL do:
d&#x27;l T-Perm l&#x27;d

same algorithm different setup.
Now we could have done l&#x27; and the T perm that flips the edges too.
So I think I&#x27;ll prefer to use M&#x27;U2MU2 and U2M&#x27;U2M alternating as an 
approach to EP
why alternate?
because you want to consider Keeping UF Solved once it&#x27;s been 
permuted, so just as the two corners keep being swapped back and 
forth in Pochmann while you are permuting the edges, well you keep 
swapping the UF between UB and UF using alternating slice cycles.

I&#x27;m going to have to do some practice runs to make sure that I fully 
understand this correctly.  And see what I can do w/ my old 
Progressive Parity Fixing algs.  If any of you read on Simul Block, 
it&#x27;s those algs optimized.  If there is a parity, I&#x27;ll directly 
solve the first corner and edge of the Cycles then do my EP and CP 
as normal.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I just had my first successful 3x3x3 BLD solve! The time was 23:52.98.<br>
<br>
Earlier I had another successful solve, but it was the 2nd attempt for<br>
a given scramble so I&#x27;m not counting that one.<br>
<br>
By the way, I recently posted on the speedsolving forum that I found<br>
the following commutator for twisting four corners (the four corners<br>
in the U layer):<br>
<br>
(R&#x27; D R&#x27; D R&#x27; D S) U2 (S&#x27; D&#x27; R D&#x27; R D&#x27; R) U2<br>
<br>
but there were no responses to my post. I was wondering if this rather<br>
simple commutator has been mentioned anywhere else for twisting four<br>
corners without changing anything else. I haven&#x27;t seen it on any BLD<br>
sites I&#x27;ve looked at.<br>
<br>
For the other case of twisting four U-layer corners, I have come up<br>
with the following commutator, but some other (non-commutator) algs<br>
are probably better for this case.<br>
<br>
(L&#x27; R&#x27; D L R F B D F&#x27; B&#x27;) U (B F D&#x27; B&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27; R L) U&#x27;<br>

Which is a shame. I love that alg. Not for actual use (&lt;R,U> is 
better), but for its ingenuity.

          <div class="email-content">For more U &amp; R layer turns, you could do the the up-down mirror to
twist the D-layer corners...

R U&#x27; R U&#x27; R U&#x27; S&#x27; D2 S U R&#x27; U R&#x27; U R&#x27; D2

But that part in the middle with the S-slice turns still is a bit
awkward. Even so, I think it is reasonably fast. It&#x27;s my impression
that many BLD solvers don&#x27;t want to learn a lot of algs for BLD, and
the commutator would at least be easier to learn than other algs I&#x27;ve
seen (although people who know OLL/PLL algs may not find those others
so hard.) So I think this may be useful for some people, but I wasn&#x27;t
meaning to imply that it&#x27;s better for speed than other 4-corner twist
algs.

And I don&#x27;t recommend using the other commutator (L&#x27; R&#x27; D L R F B D F&#x27;
B&#x27; U B F D&#x27; B&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; L&#x27; D&#x27; R L U&#x27;) with all the anti-slice moves that
I came up. It&#x27;s a lot of moves unless you count anti-slice moves as a
single move; and I don&#x27;t find it very easy to execute. It may be
fairly simple to memorize, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it myself.

          <div class="email-content">I know why images have been much slower for memorizing the 3x3x3 for<br>
me!  Also, this means that I can speed up my memorization quite a bit<br>
for the bigger cubes too!!<br>
<br>
I was doing some 3x3x3 BLD solves using images rather than the normal<br>
stuff, and realized one difference between how I do it with images and<br>
with regular stuff.  The difference was for images I often close my<br>
eyes to get a better mental picture at my journey location.  I tried<br>
memorizing without closing my eyes, and found that it feels weird, but<br>
I think it is something I can get used to.<br>
<br>
This is pretty cool for the 3x3x3, but the really exciting part is<br>
that I could be so much faster at memorizing the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cube<br>
because I quite often close my eyes for long stretches to really<br>
cement in the picture at *each* journey location.  If I could learn to<br>
do this with my eyes open the whole time, then I think I could really<br>
take a lot of time off, maybe a minute or so for the 4x4x4 and a<br>
couple minutes for the 5x5x5.<br>
<br>
Oh my God this is so crazy cool!  I&#x27;m going to start trying to<br>
memorize solely with eyes open, or at least try to minimize how often<br>
I close my eyes to cement a journey location in my mind.<br>
<br>
It has been extremely frustrating for me to be improving my big cubes<br>
memorization times so much, and yet have that exact same images method<br>
slow me down considerably for the 3x3x3.  Well now I think about it<br>
the other way, the way I am memorizing with images for the 3x3x3 is<br>
the exact same as for the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5, so I must need to improve<br>
my images method in general, which will also speed up my 4x4x4 and<br>
5x5x5 times!<br>
<br>
My record for memorizing the 4x4x4 is around 3:10 I believe, so I<br>
think if I can get to the point where I can cement the images in my<br>
location without closing my eyes at all, then I might be able to get<br>
sub-3 for 4x4x4 memo, which is even faster than the memory experts<br>
predicted!<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m going to work REALLY hard on this and try to post on how it goes.<br>
 Wish me luck!  I&#x27;d love to be able to memorize the 4x4 sub-3 and beat<br>
even the predicted times of the memory masters!  I think memorizing<br>
the 5x5x5 sub-10 would be possible too, my record for 5x5 is 10:30 for<br>
memo so I think this change could get me sub-10.<br>
<br>
Will try to update on how the open eyed practice goes with these<br>
images, I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t even realize the difference of how<br>
often I pause, with eyes closed, to cement a journey location in my<br>
mind.  That would explain why my 3x3 is so much slower, and also the<br>
implications for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 are very exciting since I could<br>
probably be memorizing them so much faster without closing my eyes<br>
after each journey location!<br>

the DNF&#x27;s show where my solves are headed.  The successful solve was<br>
2:40.98.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m going to keep practicing this, as I feel that I am memorizing much<br>
faster, I just need to get my accuracy up seeing as how this feels<br>
very weird to memorize this way right now.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll try to keep posting on how it goes.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I just tried doing images with eyes open for 4x4x4 BLD and the results<br>
are very awesome!  My first solve was 8:10.57 but it was a DNF and was<br>
off by 3 edges.  The second solve with eyes open was a 8:22.58<br>
successful solve with about 4:30.xx of memorization.<br>
<br>
It is fairly rare for me to be able to do two sub-9&#x27;s (even if one is<br>
DNF) in a row with closing my eyes to cement each and every journey<br>
location.  I usually can get one, then all the other solves after it<br>
are much slower.<br>
<br>
I think this eyes open memorizing is the way to go, I&#x27;m going to work<br>
on it for the 4x4x4 and also for the 5x5x5 as I think the most benefit<br>
can come from memorizing eyes open for the bigger cubes.<br>
<br>
I also want to work on eyes open images for the 3x3x3 too, as I think<br>
I can at least get my images memorization to be faster and hopefully<br>
closer in time to the rote memory stuff I use when not using images.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll try to keep posting about my progress, but so far eyes open is<br>
now the only way I will try to memorize.  I just still need to get<br>
used to it as it still feels a bit weird to memorize this way right now.<br>

Hey Chris,

For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve always memorized with eyes open.  I have a 
problem with distractions though.  Visual, noise; both bother me.  
But I am most bothered by my wandering mind.  Often I have a really 
hard time focusing on seeing my images for just a split second, as is 
usually recommended.  Other things will just pop into my mind, like 
events of the day, etc., and right there I lose seconds from the memo 
phase.  It&#x27;s quite annoying; I&#x27;m rarely &quot;in the zone&quot; that is 
critical for making images quickly.  I wish I knew how to block out 
all the other clutter from coming in.  I also wonder about the age 
factor, and the ability to concentrate.

I&#x27;ve been at this for over 4 yrs now, and while certain things have 
improved, the ability to block out distractions while memorizing 
still lingers.  

But for speed, I think that eyes open would be the way to go.

My ramblings,

-Dave O.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Dave,

That&#x27;s good to know that memorizing with eyes open has helped you.  I
posted on the memory sports group about eyes open vs. eyes closed to
cement images and I also got the &quot;do with eyes open response&quot; from
there too.

Yeah I am also worried about visual distractions with this new eyes
open technique.  There has always been a lot of visual noise when I
was memorizing in competition, so I imagine if I feel overwhelmed I&#x27;ll
just close my eyes to cement a location and make sure I won&#x27;t DNF
because of a memorization error.  I&#x27;d rather memorize slower but not
DNF under pressure than try to go super fast and DNF all my solves,
which I&#x27;m sick of doing in competition lol, I&#x27;ve done it enough times
already.

I&#x27;ll probably start practicing in public more often now to see how I
do with this eyes open technique in public.

As for at home, I&#x27;ve already fallen in love with it.  I did a 4x4x4
BLD solve just now, and almost beat my PB solve!  The solve was slower
than my pb by 0.02 second!  The memorization took me 3:53.xx and the
total time was 7:52.99!  I&#x27;m going to go try a couple 5x5x5 solves now
and see how it goes.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m ready for eyes open for 5x5,
but I figure I&#x27;ll try it anyway and either sink or swim lol.

Thanks for the input though Dave, I respect your opinion on BLD
related matters very much, especially with the times you put up as
well as your crazy multiple cubes attempts.  You really should try the
bigger cubes too, they&#x27;re so much more addicting ;-)

Thanks Dave, hope things are well with you,
Chris

I just got a DNF on 5x5x5 BLD, but it would have been a really good<br>
time :-(<br>
<br>
The memorization time was 10:59.xx and the solve was off by two<br>
+centers, everything else was perfect.  The overall time was 19:53.26 :&#x27;(<br>
<br>
That both motivates me so much more than any other solve I&#x27;ve ever<br>
done on the 5x5x5, and also makes me so angry I could scream lol.<br>
<br>
Alright, well at least my DNFs show the progress of where my solves<br>
are headed.  I&#x27;m at least glad to know that it&#x27;s possible for me to<br>
get sub-20 on the 5x5x5 assuming I concentrate harder during the<br>
solve.  But at the same time it sucks to get so close and yet be so<br>
far.  I think it was an execution error, I can see where I switched<br>
one of my base pieces (the one that always starts the cycle) in one<br>
case, and left two pieces unsolved at the end.<br>
<br>
After I go scream into my pillow for a few seconds lol I&#x27;m going to go<br>
try again.  Ok so I&#x27;m not really that upset, but I&#x27;m close lol.<br>
<br>
Alright, I hope to get a for real sub-20 soon.  I memorized with eyes<br>
open while doing this, and it&#x27;s making it so much easier to memorize<br>
quickly for the bigger cubes.  I&#x27;m glad I discovered this change.  I<br>
only hope to be used to it enough to use it in competition at G-Wiz.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Alright after this post I promise I&#x27;ll shut up for a while.  I did 3<br>
5x5x5 BLD solves in a row, I&#x27;m going to take a break tonight as I&#x27;m<br>
getting extremely frustrated, and would rather just start tomorrow<br>
when I&#x27;m fresh.<br>
<br>
The good news is that I correctly memorized a 5x5x5 cube in 9:57.xx so<br>
I finally got a sub-10 memo.  I was able to recall the entire cube<br>
with the blindfold on.  However, I&#x27;ve also been practicing going very<br>
fast and had an error during execution so some corners were unsolved,<br>
as well as some edges.  The centers and central edges were all perfect.<br>
<br>
Anyway I have met at least one goal tonight, I memorized a 5x5x5<br>
sub-10 and was able to still recall everything about it.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll continue to work on the eyes open memorization, it really does<br>
make it so much easier to get these superfast memorization times and<br>
yet still be able to recall later.  For some reason I can actually<br>
picture my journey locations with the images in them much more clearly<br>
when I keep my eyes open, so I hope to get better at this.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll keep quiet for a while so I don&#x27;t clog up all the posts on this<br>
group.  But I&#x27;m hoping for a sub-20 solve for real soon, and more<br>
sub-10 memorization times for the 5x5.<br>

  You will get it eventually.  Don&#x27;t always feel so bad at what you are doing.  Sit back and think of what you are really doing.  Solving a 5x5x5 puzzle blindfolded.  Only so many people in the world would be for 1, determined enough, and 2, even have the ability to memorize it, let alone at your speed.  Best of luck to you.

This I have to do on my own.  However, I was wondering if somebody <br>
could help to explain 3-cycles for big BLD cubing.  I&#x27;m a direct 2-<br>
cycle solver for 333 bld.  <br>
<br>
I understand that I can use variations of R&#x27;FRB&#x27;R&#x27;F&#x27;RB and I can use <br>
l2dRd&#x27;l2dR&#x27;d&#x27; and variations thereof for cycles, but the only way I <br>
understand cubing is to permute 1 piece at time.<br>
<br>
So could somebody please explain 3-cylces to me.  Only for big <br>
cubes.  Like how would I easily set them up. <br>
<br>
And could somebody give me some well shaped 3 or 5 cycles for big <br>
cubes.  I really want to compete beside Chris ... even if it&#x27;s only <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Daniel,

I received your e-mail about the three cycles for the bigger cubes, I
just hadn&#x27;t typed up a response yet.

I&#x27;ll go ahead and respond here in case anyone else is interested too.
 I typed up a long post on the rubiks.has.it forum about how I
mentally approach any three cycle for the bigger cubes.

The link is http://tinyurl.com/pft5d

That post is slightly outdated in that at the time I didn&#x27;t memorize
with journeys but with my older style of images that I&#x27;ve since given
up on.  So don&#x27;t listen to anything in the part about &quot;why I solve in
the order I do&quot; because all of that has changed.

However, the section that describes what algs to use is still in date,
only I&#x27;ve added a couple commutator types since then (Thank you
Stefan!!) :-)

The short version I&#x27;ll type here though.

Given any three pieces to three cycle you must meet three conditions
before you can start:

1) You must have two pieces on one layer, and one piece off that layer
2) The two pieces in one layer must be interchangeable - meaning you
can put on in the place of the other just by turning the layer they
are both on
3) You must easily be able to place the one piece off that layer into
the spot of one of your two pieces.

I give names for these to make it easier.  The two pieces in one layer
are simply called your &quot;two pieces&quot;.  The third piece is called the
&quot;lone piece&quot;.  You will use this for either the &quot;lone edge&quot; or the
&quot;lone center&quot;.

To meet the last condition you have to look at both of your two pieces
and see if you can place the lone piece into the layer, literally
replacing one of your &quot;two pieces&quot; while affecting nothing else on
that layer.

Here is an example.  I choose the three edge piece cycle lUB->uBL->bUL

So let&#x27;s see what we have.  We do have two edges in one layer and one
edge off that layer.  I&#x27;ll choose the two edges in one layer to be lUB
and bUL which are both in the U layer.  This means that the uBL edge
is not in the U layer and so is called the &quot;lone edge&quot;.

So I have met condition 1.  However I have not met condition 2, the
two edges in one layer are not interchangeable.  I cannot turn the U
layer and put one edge in the location of the other.  So I need a
setup move in order to make sure that I meet conditions 1,2, and 3.

The setup move I will choose is b&#x27;

After b&#x27; I now have the cycle lUB->uBL->bUR

So let&#x27;s start over.  Do I have two pieces in one layer and one piece
off that layer?  Yes I do, lUB and bUR are both in the U layer, and
uBL is off that layer and is still my &quot;lone edge&quot;.  Now do we meet
condition 2?  Yes we do, I can put the lUB piece into the spot of the
bUR piece simply by doing the turn U.  I could also put the bUR piece
into the spot of lUB simply by doing the turn U&#x27;.  So condition 2 is met.

Do we meet condition 3?  Condition 3 is that I must easily be able to
insert the lone edge into the U layer to replace either lUB or bUR. 
The piece I choose to replace, it&#x27;s location, gets the name the
&quot;action spot&quot;, meaning this is where all the action is going to happen.

The action spot here is going to be bUR.  This is because it is very
easy to insert uBL into the action spot without messing up anything
else in the U layer, you just do R&#x27; u2 R.

This move places the uBL piece into the bUR spot.  But notice that
after our setup move that our cycle is now lUB->uBL->bUR

That means that the uBL pieces was supposed to go to bUR, so we&#x27;re
doing the cycle correctly.  Now after placing the lone edge into the U
layer, we have to interchange the two U layer edges.  Do this with the
move U, this will move the lUB edge to bUR which is the action spot. 
Now we have to place the action spot edge where the lone edge used to
be.  This is a commutator too, so make sure to do that in the exact
reverse way that you first placed the lone edge into the action spot.
 So we&#x27;ll actually do this with R&#x27; u2 R.

Now we need to undo our U layer turn to complete the commutator, which
we&#x27;ll do with U&#x27;.

Also remember that we started with the setup turn b&#x27; so we now have to
undo that with the move b.

Ok, so all in all we did the cycle lUB->uBL->bUL and we did this with
the following commutator:

b&#x27; R&#x27; u2 R U R&#x27; u2 R U&#x27; b

Now I could have just given you the commutator for that particular
case, but then I&#x27;d also have to give you the commutator for every
other case, and to be honest there are too many to memorize.  If you
memorize this process for coming up with a commutator then you won&#x27;t
view these as algs, but just as types of commutators.  And one type of
commutator can have quite a lot of variations and just one &quot;commutator
type&quot; can really turn out to be around 50 or more algs.

So for the bigger cubes, don&#x27;t memorize algs if you want to do three
cycles.  There are simply too many to memorize.  Just learn the
process for coming up with a commutator to fix your situation on the fly.

Just my two cents, but I&#x27;ve found that knowing how to come up with
commutators on the fly is very fast for me, and I don&#x27;t see any reason
to just memorize a bunch of algs when you can have a 100% total
understand of how you are using commutators to move pieces around, and
your blindfolded solve becomes an intuitive solve.  That helps for
noticing any errors, because you just get the feeling that &quot;I didn&#x27;t
do something right&quot; or &quot;that didn&#x27;t feel right&quot; if you make a wrong
move or use the wrong commutator.

Hope that helps, and sorry for the slow response time,
Chris

I think you seriously need to look up the definition of &quot;short&quot; :-)

Did you consider making a page about it on your website? Applets to 
show the algs would be good, too...

I think I&#x27;ll just focus on BLD for the competition.  For my

  Hey Daniel,

  I received your e-mail about the three cycles for the bigger cubes, I
  just hadn&#x27;t typed up a response yet.

  I&#x27;ll go ahead and respond here in case anyone else is interested too.
  I typed up a long post on the rubiks.has.it forum about how I
  mentally approach any three cycle for the bigger cubes.

  The link is http://tinyurl.com/pft5d&lt;http://tinyurl.com/pft5d>

  That post is slightly outdated in that at the time I didn&#x27;t memorize
  with journeys but with my older style of images that I&#x27;ve since given
  up on. So don&#x27;t listen to anything in the part about &quot;why I solve in
  the order I do&quot; because all of that has changed.

  However, the section that describes what algs to use is still in date,
  only I&#x27;ve added a couple commutator types since then (Thank you
  Stefan!!) :-)

  The short version I&#x27;ll type here though.

  Given any three pieces to three cycle you must meet three conditions
  before you can start:

  1) You must have two pieces on one layer, and one piece off that layer
  2) The two pieces in one layer must be interchangeable - meaning you
  can put on in the place of the other just by turning the layer they
  are both on
  3) You must easily be able to place the one piece off that layer into
  the spot of one of your two pieces.

  I give names for these to make it easier. The two pieces in one layer
  are simply called your &quot;two pieces&quot;. The third piece is called the
  &quot;lone piece&quot;. You will use this for either the &quot;lone edge&quot; or the
  &quot;lone center&quot;.

  To meet the last condition you have to look at both of your two pieces
  and see if you can place the lone piece into the layer, literally
  replacing one of your &quot;two pieces&quot; while affecting nothing else on
  that layer.

  Here is an example. I choose the three edge piece cycle lUB->uBL->bUL

  So let&#x27;s see what we have. We do have two edges in one layer and one
  edge off that layer. I&#x27;ll choose the two edges in one layer to be lUB
  and bUL which are both in the U layer. This means that the uBL edge
  is not in the U layer and so is called the &quot;lone edge&quot;.

  So I have met condition 1. However I have not met condition 2, the
  two edges in one layer are not interchangeable. I cannot turn the U
  layer and put one edge in the location of the other. So I need a
  setup move in order to make sure that I meet conditions 1,2, and 3.

  The setup move I will choose is b&#x27;

  After b&#x27; I now have the cycle lUB->uBL->bUR

  So let&#x27;s start over. Do I have two pieces in one layer and one piece
  off that layer? Yes I do, lUB and bUR are both in the U layer, and
  uBL is off that layer and is still my &quot;lone edge&quot;. Now do we meet
  condition 2? Yes we do, I can put the lUB piece into the spot of the
  bUR piece simply by doing the turn U. I could also put the bUR piece
  into the spot of lUB simply by doing the turn U&#x27;. So condition 2 is met.

  Do we meet condition 3? Condition 3 is that I must easily be able to
  insert the lone edge into the U layer to replace either lUB or bUR. 
  The piece I choose to replace, it&#x27;s location, gets the name the
  &quot;action spot&quot;, meaning this is where all the action is going to happen.

  The action spot here is going to be bUR. This is because it is very
  easy to insert uBL into the action spot without messing up anything
  else in the U layer, you just do R&#x27; u2 R.

  This move places the uBL piece into the bUR spot. But notice that
  after our setup move that our cycle is now lUB->uBL->bUR

  That means that the uBL pieces was supposed to go to bUR, so we&#x27;re
  doing the cycle correctly. Now after placing the lone edge into the U
  layer, we have to interchange the two U layer edges. Do this with the
  move U, this will move the lUB edge to bUR which is the action spot. 
  Now we have to place the action spot edge where the lone edge used to
  be. This is a commutator too, so make sure to do that in the exact
  reverse way that you first placed the lone edge into the action spot.
  So we&#x27;ll actually do this with R&#x27; u2 R.

  Now we need to undo our U layer turn to complete the commutator, which
  we&#x27;ll do with U&#x27;.

  Also remember that we started with the setup turn b&#x27; so we now have to
  undo that with the move b.

  Ok, so all in all we did the cycle lUB->uBL->bUL and we did this with
  the following commutator:

  b&#x27; R&#x27; u2 R U R&#x27; u2 R U&#x27; b

  Now I could have just given you the commutator for that particular
  case, but then I&#x27;d also have to give you the commutator for every
  other case, and to be honest there are too many to memorize. If you
  memorize this process for coming up with a commutator then you won&#x27;t
  view these as algs, but just as types of commutators. And one type of
  commutator can have quite a lot of variations and just one &quot;commutator
  type&quot; can really turn out to be around 50 or more algs.

  So for the bigger cubes, don&#x27;t memorize algs if you want to do three

   I&#x27;ve had this question on my mind for a while.  When doing 4x4x4 or<br>
5x5x5 blindfolded, let&#x27;s say you have to switch two sets of two edges<br>
on the 4x4x4 or two wings on the 5x5x5.  On the 3x3x3, this would be<br>
relatively simple, as there&#x27;s algs to do it, and the setup moves are<br>
minimal.  On the larger cubes, however, while there is the PLL parity<br>
alg, I always use WAY too many setup moves.  On the last 4x4x4<br>
blindfold I attempted, i had to do 11 setup moves to switch two sets<br>
of edges.  Am I doing something horrendously wrong, or do I just need<br>
more practice?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Alexei,

I would not say you&#x27;re doing something wrong, I mean as long as a 
method works and solves your cube while you&#x27;re blindfolded then it&#x27;s a 
good method.  I do think there is an easier way though.

On the 4x4x4 or 5x5x5, assuming you keep the orientation of the cube 
fixed, there are (24 c 2) * (22 c 2) = 276 * 231 = 63756 ways to have 
2 sets of two edges or wing edges to swap.

Since there are so many I try not to memorize algs for those cases, 
because even if you memorize 100 algs you are still 63656 cases short 
of knowing all of them and you may still require a lot of setup moves.

I do those 2 two swap cases as two three cycles, so I break it down to 
a problem needing 2 steps to solve rather than solving all 4 at once.

I&#x27;ll do this in permutation theory or notation or however you call it 
so that it will show how you solve any case.

Say the 4 pieces I have unsolved are pieces A, B, C, and D.  They are 
setup in two swaps like this:

(A B) (C D)

Which is to say that pieces A and B swap and pieces C and D swap.  
These could be any pieces on the cube.

To solve this position I would first do the cycle:
(A B C) = A -> B -> C -> A

Let&#x27;s see how this affects our starting point of (A B) (C D)

Piece A needs to go to the spot that piece B is in.  Notice in our 
cycle that we send piece A to the spot where piece B is (A -> B -> C).

Piece B needs to go to the spot where piece A is, but we instead sent 
it to the spot where piece C was.  So now the location where piece C 
started needs to go to the location where piece A started.  So we have 
C->A necessary to solve our cube.

Piece C we sent to the location where piece A started, but piece C 
needs to go to the location where piece D started.  So we now have A-
>D necessay to solve our cube.

Also we never touched the D piece, so it still needs to go to C.  So 
we have D->C

Let&#x27;s put all those pieces together to see what we have left:

C->A; A->D; D->C

And we see we have a three cycle: A->D->C->A or (A D C)

So after the cycle (A B C) we then do the cycle (A D C) and we will 
have solved that two swap scenario.

The way I remember how to do this during a solve is like this:

Look at your 2 two swaps: (A B) (C D) and create a three cycle out of 
them in the order you memorized them.  So for these I&#x27;ll say I 
memorized the cycle that now ends with (A B) before the cycle that now 
ends with (C D).  I could have also just started with 2 two swaps, and 
let&#x27;s say if that happened that I still memorized (A B) before (C D).

Now just read left to right creating a three cycle, so do (A B C) or A-
>B->C

By what we showed above we know that we will have solved location B, 
leaving only A, C, and D left to be solved.  Now start with A again in 
your second cycle, but read the (C D) cycle backwards.  So our second 
three cycle has to be (A D C).  This is simply starting at A again, 
but solving the (C D) swap reading now right to left, so as D -> C.

------------

That was the long explanation of what we&#x27;re doing, but the short of it 
is that if you have the 2 swap (A B) (C D) then do two three cycles, 
and do them in this order:

1) (A B C)
2) (A D C)

And you will solve that two swap case.

This is also nice because you don&#x27;t have to memorize any algs, or 
often you don&#x27;t even have to do any setup moves.  Just break down this 
harder problem into 2 cases, rather than trying to do it in 1 step 
like for the 3x3x3.

That&#x27;s just my opinion, but personally I&#x27;ve found it to be faster than 
setup moves into a memorized case, and also faster than 2 applications 
of the parity alg to fix.

Just my two cents, but I hope this helps.  And good luck with your big 
cubes BLD!

Wrong :-)

Unless you care about the order of the two sets which seems unlikely 
since you don&#x27;t care about the order of the two pieces in each set.

about big cubes BLD onto one page on my site, just for clarity of 
trying to read it, rather than half of it being on this group and 
half at the rubiks.has.it forum.

That&#x27;s exactly why I said I hope I qualify for amateur 
mathematician, I love it but I&#x27;m no researcher and definitely don&#x27;t 
know it on a super high level.

Yeah that&#x27;s right. Your mistake was that you accepted (AB)(CD) as the 
same as (BA)(CD) but not as (CD)(AB). So you counted everything twice.

Yet another way:
24C4 * 3

First you choose four, then you pair up the &quot;prettiest&quot; (your choice 
what that means) with one of the other three.

Thanks for your help!

     Also, on the 5x5x5 blindfold, let&#x27;s say you have to switch two
corners.  How, and at what point in the solve would you do this?  To
me, it would make most sense to wait until the end of the solve, and
then do a T-perm, followed by the 4x4x4 PLL parity alg to fix the
messed up wing edges.  I&#x27;ve never actually had this situation come up
yet, but I was wondering what would be the most efficient way to do it
when it does happen.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Alexei,

Glad that helps, I actually had never thought to try that either 
until I posted on this group and someone said they did that case 
with two three cycles.  I&#x27;m just glad to be able to help &quot;cube it 
forward&quot; a little bit ;-)

As for when to swap the corners on a 4x4 or 5x5 I have been saving 
them until the very end of the solve, but after reading your post I 
realized that&#x27;s not necessary.

The most important thing to realize is that swapping two corners on 
a 5x5 (which also means 2 central edges need swapping) performs an 
odd permutation on the X centers of the cube.  You can&#x27;t see this on 
a regular 5x5x5 cube if it&#x27;s close to solved, but on the physical 
pieces you do in fact perform an odd permutation on the Xcenters 
when you swap two edges and 2 corners, even if you can&#x27;t see it.  If 
you swap two corners on a 4x4 you have also performed an odd 
permutation on the Xcenters there too.

I would say the easiest thing is to wait until after you have solved 
the centers, and then swap those two corners.  This way the odd 
permutation on the Xcenters isn&#x27;t noticed, because your centers are 
all solved, and most algs for the corner parity only affect the 
centers on a given face, and don&#x27;t swap them between faces.

I personally have been saving the corner swaps (and edges too for 
the 5x5) until the very end, but I just realized that this is 
unnecessary for the way I solve.  When I first started big cubes BLD 
I solved the centers last, so I had to wait until the very, very end 
of the solve to swap the corners.  Now I solve centers first, so if 
I have corner parity I&#x27;m going to start swapping the corners 
immediately after I finish centers rather than wait until the end of 
the solve.  There&#x27;s no need to remember that information for the 
whole solve just to follow the tradition of the way I started 
solving when I think it would be much more efficient as far as the 
memory is concerned to just solve them immediately after the centers.

And also I would say the same as advice for when would be best for 
you to swap corners too.  Swap them immediately after you have 
finished solving the centers, that way you can forget about them for 
the rest of the solve.

If you solve centers last, then I would say your safest bet is to 
swap the corners if you have corner parity as the very final thing 
you do in a solve.

Just my two cents,
Chris

  In working w/ big cube BLD.  I would have to say that I&#x27;m most interested freedom.  Freestyle commutators are awsome.  But I do 2-cycle corners, so I&#x27;d seriously solve from the core outwards.

  Look at the Buffer Edge pair, UR.  Look at the fUR edge, then use a commutator to shoot the other cubie of the edge pair to bUR.

<br>
I think your method would be feasible, the only thing that I would<br>
wonder about would be how hard it would be to memorize.  After you<br>
pair up one edge pair, and then use a 2 cycle to move it to it&#x27;s<br>
correct location, make sure you remember how the unsolved edge pair<br>
that you *do* move to UR is oriented when it gets to UR.  Make sure<br>
you don&#x27;t swap which piece is in URf and which is in URb.<br>
<br>
I think this will be more moves than freestyle commutators, but if it<br>
turns out to be less thought, then you can execute your moves faster<br>
than someone doing freestyle commutators, since those require a lot of<br>
thought to setup each given cycle.<br>
<br>
I like your idea to solve the centers first, otherwise you have to<br>
keep track of how the center groups twist during your two cycles to<br>
swap edge groups, which will perform an odd permutation on the X<br>
centers (and +centers if on a 5x5x5).<br>
<br>
I think it has potetential to be a good method, just make sure to be<br>
careful about moving your unsolved edge group to UR and don&#x27;t swap<br>
which piece of the group ends up at fUR and which at bUR.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts, but I think it sounds like a good method.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Alexei,

I just tried swapping the two corners on a 4x4x4 right after solving
the centers (my first step after corners) rather than saving them
until the very end of the solve.

To be honest, I like doing it this way MUCH better than saving them
until the end.  I was able to forget about the corners halfway through
the solve, since I had solved all of them, rather than remember them
throughout the entire solve.

I would definitely recommend, no matter how you solve the bigger cubes
blindfolded, for the 4x4x4 fix corner parity *immediately* after
finishing the centers.  For the 5x5x5 fix the corner and central edge
parity *immediately* after solving all the centers.

Technically you could even do this before finishing the centers, say
immediately after the U layer center group is completely solved (which
often happens before all the centers are solved if you memorize your
cycles right).  However, I think it would be better to finish centers
completely rather than break them up with the corner or corner+central
edge parity fix.

That&#x27;s just my personal opinion, but I think it would be better that way.

My first solve trying to fix the corners immediately after centers was
a successful solve with a total time of 8:12.46 minutes.  The
memorization took 4:05.xx and the solving took the rest, or about 4:07.xx

Just my opinion, but already I love solving this way, as you can
devote the entire rest of your solve to everything else and not even
have to worry about corners anymore, rather than remember them
throughout the entire solve.

Definitely solve them after centers is my recommendation.

If you do solve centers last, then I would say save them until last,
don&#x27;t break up your centers solve with the corner parity fix.  Go
ahead and finish everything, then fix the corner parity last would be
my recommendation.

Hope this helps,
Chris

Hey again Alexei, and also anyone else following this thread.<br>
<br>
I just tried fixing the corner+central edge parity for 5x5x5 BLD<br>
immediately after finish centers rather than saving it until the end.<br>
 The solve was a success and the time is my new personal fastest solve<br>
for 5x5x5 BLD!  The total time was 21 minutes 11.33 seconds, which<br>
broke down into about 11:15 memorization and 9:55 solving.<br>
<br>
The recall during edges, my very last step, felt so much faster.  This<br>
was because I knew I could just go break neck speed having already<br>
finished the corner+central edge parity off right after the centers. <br>
I usually pause at the end of my edges step to make absolutely for<br>
certain that I am not forgetting the corner+central edge parity.  This<br>
time I knew I had already completed the parity fix right after the<br>
centers and I just went break neck speed through the edges.  A time of<br>
roughly 9:55 for the solving phase is actually quite good for me, and<br>
I attribute the fast time to the fact that I could more comfortably<br>
speed through the edges knowing I didn&#x27;t have to hold onto the<br>
corner+central edge parity information and not forget it to fix at the<br>
end.  Knowing it was already fixed allowed me to comfortably speed<br>
through the edges to end the solve.<br>
<br>
So to answer your question, having tried the new way on the 4x4x4 and<br>
5x5x5 I say fix the corner parity for 4x4x4 and corner+central edge<br>
parity on 5x5x5 immediately after you have finished solving the<br>
centers.  It speeds up the rest of your solve so much if the centers<br>
are not your last step to solve.<br>
<br>
If the centers are your last step to solve then I still believe that<br>
solving the corner parities are better after the centers are solved,<br>
so either way I think it is the best option.  Again that is just my<br>
opinion, but after setting my new PB on the 5x5x5 BLD I think I am<br>
definitely hooked on this new solving order!<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Chris,

    Great, thanks for your help!  I don&#x27;t have time right now to try a
4x4x4 or 5x5x5 blindfold, as it will take me at least an hour, if not
more.  Next time I do it however, I&#x27;ll fix the parity immediately
after solving centers.  Thanks again!  Big cube BLDing seems so much
easier now...

          <div class="email-content">The edges are a greater problem for most in blindfold cubing, 
because there are more.

So, perhaps, take the approach that I use.  
I look at my corner path first, I don&#x27;t spend much time on it at 
all.  Less than 15 seconds, maybe more if I have to make a bunch of 
decisions.  Then I completely memorize the edges.  Since I already 
have made decisions for the corners, I don&#x27;t have to worry about 
losing memorization of the edges.
 
I use a Buffer Based method.
I try to visually memorize via shapes.  I look at the cube as like a 
spiderweb.  Your cycle is like the spider stringing its web.  
Metaphorically of course.  There are some pretty patterns to 
notice.  There are some times when you&#x27;ll finish one layer of the 
webbing, then  move onto the next string.  Since I don&#x27;t use 
Orientation as a step to my solving method.

In a 2-cycle method for blindfold cubing, such as Pochmann&#x27;s method, 
I feel that solving edges first is a lot faster, because the parity 
fix flows pretty nicely, because your are focusing on the edges 
still in a sense.  Also, since I have very good recall on corners, I 
execute I feel I can do the corners last, even though I&#x27;ve spent a 
lot less time on them.

If you are not using 2-cycles, I personally cannot give you any tips 
on nearly any part of your method.  I&#x27;ve tried 3-cycles and do not 
understand the method.

My memorization is an on the fly system.  I count each piece of the 
cycle in the order that it comes, and I tap that piece.  This 
recollection gives me fast recollection.  At times during recall 
though, I do not even need to recall the finger taps, or the 
numbers, so I&#x27;m going to work on using the counting only, and use 
finger taps in case I need to reinforce a cycle.  The benefit of 
counting is that I can keep track as to whether there is a parity or 
not, rather quickly, usually in less than 15s.  

Also, when scanning for cycles, I need to realize if there are 
permuted cubies, (orientation doesn&#x27;t matter).  So if I count 10, 
permuting my 10th edge, and I get the buffer cubie again for the 
edges, this tells me that there is a permuted cubie, so I check to 
see if it was oriented or not.  

If there are permuted cubies that have a twist I memorize that piece 
as 
n&quot;O&quot; || n, [1,11]
suchthat N is from 1 to 11.
If I start a new cycle say &quot;skip&quot; tapping the new edge to start a 
cycle on.  So skips do not count as a number!

In summary,
Scan what ever you find easiest to memorize
Then memorize the harder path.
Then quickly memorize the easy path.
Execute the hard path.
Execute the easy path.

One thing we just discussed recently was keeping your eyes open 
while memorizing.  Trust me, it&#x27;ll help a lot, so you&#x27;re not losing 
site of the at all!  This was a problem for Chris Hardwick, who uses 
images for his memo.  He&#x27;d close his eyes to cement the images into 
his journey path, causing him to lose time scanning for the next 
pieces.

          <div class="email-content">Alright I&#x27;m reaching a frustrated point where I cannot improve my 3x3<br>
BLD times, and I have no idea what to do about it.  I am literally<br>
completely clueless as to how to procede, I&#x27;ve tried everything I can<br>
think to do many times over so I wanted to ask and see if anyone had<br>
any ideas.<br>
<br>
I memorize the 3x3x3 in two very different ways, one of which is<br>
dominant and much faster than the other.  My fastest and currently<br>
dominant way to memorize is completely visually.  I will give names to<br>
certain types of cycles.  For example the cycle UB-&gt;FL-&gt;DR I call<br>
&quot;layers&quot;.  This is because no matter which of the 3 dimensions I slice<br>
the cube in I have one piece in each layer.<br>
<br>
I also have certain positions for corners too UBL-&gt;UFR-&gt;DFL is called<br>
&quot;clockwise&quot; things like that.<br>
<br>
I have names for the orientations as well, but nothing as<br>
sophisticated as what Marcus uses.  UBR needing to rotate clockwise<br>
and UFR needing to rotate counterclockwise I call &quot;S&quot; or &quot;same&quot;.  The<br>
opposites twists I call &quot;O&quot; or &quot;opposite&quot;.<br>
<br>
I have peaked at around 2:10 overall average memorizing this way, but<br>
I usually am more around 2:30 overall.  I&#x27;d say I average 1:10-1:20<br>
just to memorize, closer to 1:20 though.<br>
<br>
I then got into big cube BLD cubing almost exactly a year ago and<br>
learned my current images method about 6 months ago.  So far with this<br>
method I have memorized the 4x4x4 in 3 minutes many times on<br>
successful solves, and the 5x5x5 in 10 minutes many times also on<br>
successful solves.  This includes memorizing the corners for 4x4x4 and<br>
both corners and central edges on the 5x5 only with my usual visual<br>
memory system that I use for the 3x3x3 (since it is my dominant and by<br>
far fastest method).<br>
<br>
I figure if I can memorize the 3x3x3 in 1:20 and the 4x4x4 in<br>
3:00-4:00 minutes that my 3x3x3 memorization must be way too slow but<br>
if you break it down into seconds per piece it&#x27;s the other way around,<br>
my 4x4x4 is way too slow also.<br>
<br>
The 4x4x4 has 56 pieces that I need to memorize the permutation of (or<br>
at least be aware when a piece is solved so I can know to ignore it).<br>
 I also have to know the orientation of 8 pieces.<br>
<br>
That is essenitally 56+8=64 pieces of information.  Memorizing in 3:30<br>
means that I had to memorize 64 pieces of information in 210 seconds,<br>
or 3.28 seconds per piece of information.<br>
<br>
The 3x3x3 has 20 pieces where you need to know the permutation and 20<br>
pieces where you need to know the orientation.  So that&#x27;s 40 pieces of<br>
information.  To memorize in 1:20 means that I had to memorize 40<br>
pieces of info in 80 seconds.  That&#x27;s 2 seconds per piece of information.<br>
<br>
Looking at it this way it seems that I in fact am memorizing the 4x4x4<br>
way too slowly.  I should probably be doing around 130-140 seconds for<br>
the 4x4x4 or roughly 2:10-2:20.<br>
<br>
2:10-2:20 seems very fast for the 4x4x4, but why does 1:20 not seem<br>
very good on the 3x3x3 compared to the top level world wide?<br>
<br>
Think about you sub-60 memorizers for the 3x3x3.  Say you memorize in<br>
40 seconds for the 3x3x3, this means that you could memorize 40 pieces<br>
of information in 40 seconds.  Using this logic you could memorize 64<br>
pieces of information in 64 seconds, say 70 to be safe.<br>
<br>
So the 4x4x4 could be memorized in 70 seconds if you superstar<br>
3x3x3&#x27;ers would just give it a try.<br>
<br>
I just don&#x27;t understand how after a year of focusing on basically just<br>
BLD solving, with enough practice to at least not be rusty on my other<br>
puzzle categories, that I have improved my 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 BLD solving<br>
so incredibly much, and yet my 3x3x3 times have improved by maybe 10<br>
seconds, if that.<br>
<br>
How do you 3x3x3 superstars average under 2 minutes for the whole<br>
solve?  I&#x27;ve been 3x3x3 BLD&#x27;ing for 3 solid years and hav broken 2<br>
minutes on single solves maybe 5 times ever.  Why do you superstars<br>
not do the 4x4x4 where you could memorize in 70 seconds, solve in <br>
3:30 and get times around 4:45 overall?  I really am getting to the<br>
point that I am frustrated with my brain&#x27;s ability to memorize.  I<br>
don&#x27;t understand what I am doing wrong, and it is really starting to<br>
make me angry.<br>
<br>
I at least feel like I can get to 2:10-2:20 for the 4x4x4 if I keep<br>
practicing and get to where I know the personality and behavior of<br>
every one of my images perfectly.  But I think it is impossible, if<br>
not nearly so, for me to get to 40 seconds for the 3x3x3, even though<br>
they seem like equal feats of memory.<br>
<br>
Why is the 3x3x3 so hard and the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 so easy in<br>
comparison?  What am I doing wrong?!?!<br>
<br>
Aaaaaah!!  This really is driving me crazy and I really am getting<br>
very frustrated with myself at not being able to improve.  Does anyone<br>
have any tips at all?  I would very much appreciate it.<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

I just tried a 3x3x3 BLD solve after posting this.  I was extremely
frustrated, even a little angry, at not being able to speed up my
3x3x3 BLD.  I had on some loud angry music and just did a solve.

I actually got my new pb solve on the 3x3x3 for 3x3x3 BLD!  I got a
1:45.13 with about 1:00 of memorization and 45 seconds of solving.

So apparently the thing I hadn&#x27;t tried was to just get extremely angry
at myself before doing a solve :-(  Seriously though, what can I do to
make getting solves this fast more common?  I&#x27;d rather not go around
being pissed off all the time, I&#x27;d prefer to just be able to
concentrate that well when I try a BLD solve.

Also, even on my pb solve I could only memorize right at 1:00 (I saw
the clock change on netcube to 1:00 and shortly after I put on the
blindfold).

That is still memorizing 40 pieces of information in 60 seconds, or
1.5 seconds per piece of information, which is still a far cry from
1.0 second per piece of information for 40 seconds of memorization.

I am on the one hand extremely happy to break my PB (which has held
since January 22 this year) but I&#x27;m also a little sad that to do it I
had to get pissed off at myself for not being able to get faster.  How
can you just concentrate hard enough to get a solve that fast without
having to get angry?  I&#x27;m not an angry person, and I hate that I had
to get angry to get a solve that fast.

Thanks for any help,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hardwick,

What&#x27;s up?  umm ... how can you get faster without getting pissed?

Well, when I was doing my best to BLD cube I would do a lot, I mean 
a lot of tedious or stressful things.  Most were self inflicted.  
Such as pissing off my boss, or locking my keys in my car and then 
walking home.  Now, like being angry all the time, why the hell 
would you want to do that?!

Stressful events:
20 DNFs + 0 successes in one day
Pissing off boss
Car Breaking Down
Locking Keys in car
Eastsheen had it&#x27;s revenge ... the 4x4x4 popped =P
The point that my speedcubes have popped 8 million times 

I believe what caused the personal best to occur, was not anger, it 
was mental stress.  The blindfold element of the rubik&#x27;s cube is a 
mental thing.  Memorization is mental.  This can be very stressing, 
you become easily distracted, you don&#x27;t want to BLD.

When you encounter this real world stress, you immerse yourself into 
the cube, because you love it.  It&#x27;s like the cubezone as you&#x27;ve 
described before.  Anger is a form of mental stress, I think part of 
the reason you were so successful, is because you were targeting 
your anger on the cube, because of the relationship you have with 
it.  When angered your sense become dull, you are single minded.  
Minor distactions are insignificant.  You will get the point across 
that you mean business.

I feel living your daily life, is very stressful.  Some read a book, 
so play games, some do drugs, we cube for that enjoyment, and 
removal from the world.  

Have you ever noticed this:  Ok I feel great today, work was awsome, 
I just got my paychecks, my new cubes arrived, now let&#x27;s BLD ... any 
you don&#x27;t do so hot?  It&#x27;s not that you&#x27;re having a bad day.  It 
means you are not stressed, angered, or upset.  And you do not know 
any other way to hone the focusing element of the BLD attempt.

Another thing, do you listen to music while cubing?  Music that you 
like??  Do you ever find yourself singing the words ...

Seriously try several things.  Start a solve.  
Turn on the music, television, a chat room (let the beep occur when 
somebody new enters) ... make sure  you like everything that&#x27;s on.

If you stop to watch a segment of whatever&#x27;s on tv, singing the 
words to the song, or in my case stopping to say hey when somebody 
pops into the chatroom.  Stop the timer.  See how long it took you 
to become distacted.

Now something on the television that you&#x27;ve no interest in.  Music 
that isn&#x27;t exactly your favorite ... better yet, try something such 
as classical or music w/o words.  Linkin Park&#x27;s Session is a good 
example.  The music can still help you relax.  You are not as likely 
to start humming during your bld attempt.

I think the point is, we&#x27;ve all tried avoid distractions.  But why 
do we tempt ourselves with our favorite things?  That&#x27;s like trying 
to quit smoking then going and getting drunk, so you wanna light up 
cuz you always smoke when you drink.  You want to avoid 
distractions, so you&#x27;ll turn on your favorite music that you know 
every lyric to and you&#x27;ll start singing without thinking.  However 
that is a distaction!

I don&#x27;t know how they do it ... How I&#x27;ve made major improvements is 
practice.  BLD is so amazing.  How do you get so fast at blindfold 
cubing?  I cut down my memo, execution, recall, and try to optimize 
algoritm execution.

I&#x27;m going to go back to freeslice 2 Cycles.  This is where instead 
of doing another 2-cycle alg to start the next cycle, I&#x27;ll perform a 
move on the S slice.

I&#x27;m also going to try Slice cycles for direct EP.  I like my corner 
method, it&#x27;ll take me a long time to break my 2-cycle CP unless I 
learn my adv 3-cycle CP, which I just found the flaw in :(

Well Chris, good luck in your competitions.  I&#x27;ll see you in well 10 
days from now!!!!

Umm, I just read &quot;I had on some loud angry music and just did a 
solve.&quot;

Well that&#x27;s fine, if that get&#x27;s you pumped.  Just don&#x27;t be 
distracted by it!  GL, HF, KA!

Later,
Daniel Beyer

Hey everyone,

I just tried a 3x3x3 BLD solve after posting this.  I was extremely
frustrated, even a little angry, at not being able to speed up my
3x3x3 BLD.  I had on some loud angry music and just did a solve.

I actually got my new pb solve on the 3x3x3 for 3x3x3 BLD!  I got a
1:45.13 with about 1:00 of memorization and 45 seconds of solving.

So apparently the thing I hadn&#x27;t tried was to just get extremely angry
at myself before doing a solve :-(  Seriously though, what can I do to
make getting solves this fast more common?  I&#x27;d rather not go around
being pissed off all the time, I&#x27;d prefer to just be able to
concentrate that well when I try a BLD solve.

Also, even on my pb solve I could only memorize right at 1:00 (I saw
the clock change on netcube to 1:00 and shortly after I put on the
blindfold).

That is still memorizing 40 pieces of information in 60 seconds, or
1.5 seconds per piece of information, which is still a far cry from
1.0 second per piece of information for 40 seconds of memorization.

I am on the one hand extremely happy to break my PB (which has held
since January 22 this year) but I&#x27;m also a little sad that to do it I
had to get pissed off at myself for not being able to get faster.  How
can you just concentrate hard enough to get a solve that fast without
having to get angry?  I&#x27;m not an angry person, and I hate that I had
to get angry to get a solve that fast.

Thanks for any help,
Chris

There are several mistakes in that logic. Some pieces of information
are easy, some are hard. EO is much easier to memorize than EP, for
example. And using Stefan&#x27;s method you have to remember less pieces,
but this doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it easier. So don&#x27;t just count the
pieces you have to memorize, because some are harder than others.

And I can memorize 10 digits in 1 second, but there&#x27;s no way I could
do 20 in 2 seconds or 1000 in 100 seconds.

I think Marcus is one of those superstars, and he solves big cubes,

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Johannes
  the pieces of information you memorise in different cubes are different at difficulty
   
  and I don&#x27;t really memorise 40 pieces for the 3x3x3...I look for known patterns on CO, like a sune, anti-sune, a pi, the other one that flips 4 corners (forgot the name), 2 facing the same side or 2 facing oposite sides or 3 that will flip on the same way on L or R or F or B layer
   
  and for EO, I just memorise the wrong oriented ones, so it&#x27;s like 6 or 8 each time, not all the 12
   
  the permutations are surely the hardest part (for me). I used to use numbers, but now I&#x27;m trying to use just visual memory, drawing the cycles. Sometimes the numbers pop into my head...haha...that&#x27;s funny, I must get rid of them....or maybe not...dunno
   
  I&#x27;m not regularly sub-2 min, I&#x27;m more like 2 min on avg...some times less, others more than 120 seconds. I guess that is more because of my solving time, that is usually over a minute...I think I need more consistant memorisation, so that I can execute the solve with almost no stops to think what&#x27;s coming next
   
  I hope this helps some

Yeah I guess I can see that, Stefan&#x27;s method would have 20 pieces of<br>

<br>
I still think I can memorize the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 faster.  I cannot<br>
memorize as fast as Marcus, but all I do is BLD lately so I hope I&#x27;m<br>

laughable compared to your times.<br>

<br>
Based on Marcus&#x27; 20:03.44 on Ryan&#x27;s competition I would imagine the<br>
breakdown would be 9:30 solving and 10:30 memorizing.  That is just my<br>
guess based on my own personal memorization times.  My best ever<br>
memorization of the 5x5x5 was just under 10 minutes, and Marcus has<br>
always been consistently faster than me so I&#x27;d imagine he is at under<br>
10 minutes fairly frequently?  Marcus am I accurate here?<br>
<br>
Also I can memorize the 4x4x4 between 3:00-3:10 on a super awesome<br>
attempt, so I imagine Marcus has broken 3 minutes already?  I&#x27;m<br>
guessing here and have no evidence to back this up, I just know Marcus<br>
you have always been faster than I am at the big cubes BLD.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Why do you superstars not do the 4x4x4 where you could memorize in<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; lol<br>
<br>
My most gut wrenching DNF on the 4x4x4 was about a 7:05.xx with only<br>
two centers swapped.  So I think I can already get sub-7 soon, and I<br>
don&#x27;t think sub-6 is unreasonable with another year of practice.<br>
<br>
Who&#x27;s to say Ben Pridmore couldn&#x27;t get sub-5 with his amazing memory<br>

&gt; Hi Chris, do you use one image for 2 pieces by using your alphabet<br>
pairs? Or do you memorise one piece at a time?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Mike<br>
<br>
Hey Mike,<br>
<br>
When I memorize visually I usually try to group the pieces together in<br>
groups of 2-4, but sometimes I have to just do one piece at a time for<br>
a stretch of 2-3 pieces.<br>
<br>
When I memorize with my images then yes I combine two pieces into a<br>
single image using the letter pair images I have.<br>
<br>
I am consistently much faster at memorization the first way only for<br>
the 3x3x3 cube, or when I memorize visually.  I am still trying to<br>
find ways to adapt my images method to be faster/better at encoding<br>
the information, but so far I haven&#x27;t found one yet.<br>
<br>
Another idea I have is to give each named group of pieces that I use<br>
for my visual memorization method on 3x3x3 an actual image.  This will<br>
be a different image than any of my ones for letter pairs.  This way<br>
instead of thinking the words &quot;clockwise&quot; for the cycle UBL-&gt;UFR-&gt;DFL<br>
I might picture a clock melting over a tree limb or something weird<br>
like that.  I still don&#x27;t know which images I would use, but I am<br>
trying to think of using images in this way rather than letter pairs.<br>
<br>
I seriously doubt that I will switch from using letter pairs for the<br>
bigger cubes though, because it is just so easy to me now to encode a<br>
large number of pieces very quickly.  I&#x27;m very, very comfortable with<br>
my images now and I see the image instantly when given the two pieces<br>
I need to encode, which I absolutely love.  I still need to learn the<br>
behavior and personality of all my images to make them interact more<br>
quickly and in more regular patterns, but many of my images already<br>
have set personalities and behaviors so they interact with the<br>
surrounding images very easily in my mind and I can think of an<br>
interaction very quickly.<br>
<br>
I still haven&#x27;t been able to adapt the images to the 3x3x3 to be<br>
faster than my visual stuff, but I am working on it.  I still believe<br>
that an images based method, if constructed correctly, would be faster<br>
 on the 3x3x3 (same as how it is much faster on the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5)<br>

Finally you see that, too :-)

Like the others said, your way to measure the amount of information is
flawed. Instead, take the logarithm of the number of possible states.
The 4x4 has 7.4*10^45 states, the 3x3 has 4.3*10^19. So the 4x4
contains roughly 45/19 times as much information as the 3x3. Now do
your memo time per piece calculations again.

          <div class="email-content">I guess that you have to qualify the concept of memorisation time.
It might be fastest to memorise colours per face rather than pieces&amp;orientations per face;
but that might hinder the ability to solve the cube quickly.

If the challenge was: memorise a cube really fast then I would research, per face:
6x6x6 colours = 1 image of a person
6x6 colours = 1 of 36 actions
6x6x6 colours = 1 image of a person

At 6 imaginary locations (1 per face), a person could act upon a person and represent the colours of the cube.

On the other hand,
instead of representing cube pieces with a pair of letters, how would you represent 2 moves with a pair of letters?
Is it feasible? How many unique terms are there like &#x27;UBL&#x27; within your current solution? 24 or less?

Mike

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

Sorry I&#x27;ve been extraordinarily busy this year.  Seven classes and
three jobs @_@.  I do check in once in a while.  My times for BLD have
actually gone down the crapper lately because I have not really done a
whole lot of it -- I&#x27;d have to get back into the groove of relearning
some algorithms and memory tricks.  

For the bigger cubes, at prime, 5x5 memorization was under 10 pretty
consistently and sometimes under 7.  I think the best way to speed up
memorization, for any case, is to broaden your foundation for which
you memorize.  In other words, you need a system that you use over and
over again such that you memorize the system.  Then everything else
simply fits into that system and becomes second nature.  For example,
if you have a consistent list of locations (ie. Location 1 = NYC,
Location 2 = Pirate Ship, etc), then you have that much more
information to use when you memorize order, for instance.  

Seeing a cycle A -> D -> H as your first cycle may translate to Arnold
Dodging a Hamster while walking down a street in NYC.  Something like
that is not going to be easily forgotten.  Not only is it quick to
make up such a story by going from letters alone (heck the story&#x27;s
made FOR you!), but it&#x27;s easy to not lose track.  As you&#x27;re solving,
you&#x27;d think, &quot;Alright, NYC.  What happened here? Arnold was walking
here... and he was dodging some hamsters.&quot;

It may help to have different sets of PAO for different elements.  I
found this to be the most effective approach.  For instance, a
different set of people/actions/objects for wings vs. edges vs.
XCenters vs. +Centers, etc.  Takes a lot, but ultimately uses less
than an extensive image system and is quicker once you pair it up with
a premade location layout.

When I have time I&#x27;ll try to get back into things -- I tried a BLD
3x3x3 a few minutes ago and got 2:45... forgot some algs and memory
hooks.  It comes back pretty quickly though assuming the system has
been made.  If you&#x27;d like I could get on YM and help you devise some
systems that I&#x27;ve found useful for me, and you could modify as you see
fit.

          <div class="email-content">Stephan I&#x27;ve looked into the helper buffer method.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been practicing my edges with two different Algorithms.<br>
<br>
1. RU&#x27;R&#x27;[u] RUR&#x27;[u]&#x27;<br>
1a. [u]RU&#x27;R&#x27; [u]&#x27;RUR&#x27;<br>
2. RB&#x27;R&#x27;[b] RBR&#x27;[b]&#x27;<br>
2a. [b]RB&#x27;R&#x27; [b]&#x27;RBR&#x27;<br>
<br>
The first is a very finger friendly algorithm.<br>
The second isn&#x27;t as fast for execution, however it much easier to <br>
visually comprehend the setups.  This is because I use the UR, UB, <br>
and UBR cubies as my buffer 1x2x2 buffer area for 3x3 bld.<br>
<br>
Through my work with Simul block, I was able to quickly relate the <br>
edges coming into the buffer/helper area to flip and block cubies.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m slowly correlating the the relationship of Block and Flip cubies <br>
with a x&#x27; rotation.<br>
<br>
As Stephan has said before, the setups are amazingly easy.  With <br>
only permuting 1 cubie per algorithm, the setups aren&#x27;t on the fly <br>
anymore.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve a cubing theory with Chris.  Where we pair up the edges and <br>
then use true 3x3 2 Cycles.<br>
This can be applied to the 4x4 and 5x5.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m trying to transform the 4x4 and 5x5 into a 3x3 then use 3x3 2-<br>
cycles.<br>
<br>
The transformation is very possible, and can lead fast exeuction, <br>
however, perhaps a tedious first 12 edges memo.  I just did a quick <br>
tranformation and I was quite happy with the speed.<br>
<br>
Also, when I get the helper cubie, I simple do the same setup alg.<br>
Alg 1 shoots the uFR to the U slice.  This would shoot the helper <br>
cubie to the helper area (rUF).  <br>
<br>
So then the next alg would be alg 1 again, this would permute the <br>
cubie that started in the helper area., then you&#x27;d start doing the <br>
inverse.<br>
<br>
Basically.<br>
<br>
By performing alg 1, you get get three results:<br>
Buffer Comes to the Helper - Start a new cycle by doing 1a<br>
Helper Comes to the Helper - Start the Helper Cycle by doing 1<br>
Cubie Comes to the Helper - Continue the current cycle by doing 1a<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ll start by saying I am somewhat of a noobie at 3x3x3 BLD. (I
practiced 2x2x2 BLD a little bit back in the &#x27;80s.)

For EP, I currently use almost exclusively (U2) M&#x27; U2 M. I put the
first U2 in parentheses because it almost always cancels or partially
cancels with the last move of the setup. I use DF as my &quot;buffer
position.&quot; I set up the other edges to be used to positions UB and UF.
I then do M&#x27; U2 M, and then move the edge at UF to the position where
the edge set up to UB came from, while I also move the edge at UB to
the position where the edge set up to UF came from. By doing the moves
following certain rules, the net effect is: setup U2 M&#x27; U2 M
inverse-setup.

As for the number of edge 3-cycle cases, I wrote a GAP function to
calculate that.

The &quot;total&quot; number of cases is 12*11*10*4/3 = 1760. (times 4 because
the orientation of the 2nd and 3rd edge matters, divide by 3 since (A
B C)=(B C A)=(C A B) )

Using the 24 symmetries of the cube without reflections, I get that
the 1760 cases are reduced to 76 cases. If mirrors are not counted as
separate cases (that is, using all 48 symmetries of the cube), the
number of cases drops to 40.

If counting mirrors as separate cases, but not counting inverses as
separate cases, then the number of cases I get is 43. If mirrors,
inverses, and mirror inverses are all not counted as separate cases,
then the number of cases I get is only 27.

          <div class="email-content">I have now used GAP to generate a list of all 76 edge 3-cycle cases.
The table below lists all 440 3-cycles containing UF as an edge (with
UF listed first). Generally, in a given 3-cycle, any of the 6 facelets
of the three edges could be considered the U facelet of the UF edge
position with an appropriate orientation of the cube. So there are
generally six such 3-cycles for each case. Due to symmetry, there are
four cases where there are only two distinct 3-cycles. The asterisks
indicate one possible set of 27 cases that are distinct with respect
to mirrors and inverses.

          I have now used GAP to generate a list of all 76 edge 3-cycle cases.
The table below lists all 440 3-cycles containing UF as an edge (with

of the three edges could be considered the U facelet of the UF edge
position with an appropriate orientation of the cube. So there are
generally six such 3-cycles for each case. Due to symmetry, there are
four cases where there are only two distinct 3-cycles. The asterisks
indicate one possible set of 27 cases that are distinct with respect

I am guessing you mean a way of memorizing these 76 edge 3-cycle cases.

Well, if I were to try to do that, I would probably look at
subdividing the 76 cases by counting how many edges are adjacent (UF
would be considered adjacent to UR, for example) to the next edge in
the 3-cycle. This would divide the 76 cases into four sets, with 0, 1,
2, or 3 such adjacencies. Then within each set, further subdivide the
cases according to which ones are mirrors and/or inverses of one
another. Then look for some methodical way of coming up with a
&quot;canonical representive&quot; 3-cycle for each of these smaller sets. For
instance, a canonical representative might be required to have
adjacent edges before non-adjacent edges, in which case (UF,UR,UB)
would be a possible canonical representative for the U-perm set, while
(UF,UB,UL), (UF,UB,UR), or (UF,UR,UL) would not be. In any case, you
would want to be able to take some arbitrary edge 3-cycle, such as
(LF,LD,BL), and quickly figure out what its canonical representative
would be.

In any case, I am not claiming this is all that simple to do. I leave
it as an exercise to the interested reader to explore this further. I
was basically trying to answer one of Joël&#x27;s questions. Since it boils
down to just 27 cases when considering mirrors and inverses
equivalent, I think it is certainly possible to learn that set of
cases. But it may take quite a bit of time to learn to be able to
quickly recognize the cases for arbitrary 3-cycles, so this may not be
all that practical of a system.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I have a question about algs for a few cases.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m looking for cases that do the following:<br>
<br>
All algs are allowed to affect any other center.  However, an alg has<br>
to leave each center group intact, but it can cycle pieces around<br>
within that center group, as long as no piece leaves its face.  Algs<br>
cannot affect the wing edges, corners, or central edges at all though.<br>
<br>
1) Switch only the four X-centers on the F face with only the four<br>
X-centers on the B face.  They need not be done in any supercube<br>
order, just swap the 4 centers from one face to the other and vice versa.<br>
<br>
2) Swap all the X centers from the U face to the F face and vice versa.<br>
<br>
3 + 4) The same as #1 and #2 but for the + centers only.<br>
<br>
5) Swap all the movable centers from F to B and vice versa<br>
<br>
6) Swap all the movable centers from U to F and vice versa.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m thinking about starting to use these cases to sort of do a type of<br>
weird pseudo block solving.  I&#x27;ve a couple of these cases come up<br>
several times where it&#x27;d be really easy to setup based on how I&#x27;d have<br>
to memorize the cycles, but I didn&#x27;t know any algs for it so I never<br>
attempted it.<br>
<br>
If anyone has any cool algs for those cases I&#x27;d appreciate it.<br>
<br>
Also I&#x27;ve had some requests for my centers approach to the bigger<br>
cubes BLD, and no I&#x27;m not ignoring the e-mails, I&#x27;ve just been really<br>
busy at work lately.  I plan on typing up a guide to how I handle<br>
them, similar to my guide for the edges.  I&#x27;ll post about it once I&#x27;m<br>
done.  Sorry for the wait, but I am not ignoring people I just don&#x27;t<br>
have a lot of free time lately.  The guide is in the works basically<br>
and I plan on adding it to either the rubiks.has.it forum or to my<br>
site soon.<br>

Just found this alg and I really like it:<br>
r u2 d2 r&#x27; l&#x27; u2 d2 l<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m still trying to look for cool algs for the other cases as well.<br>

<br>
Nevermind that alg I posted for this case doesn&#x27;t follow my own rules<br>
about affecting the D and B center groups.<br>
<br>
However I think this alg might be of some use:<br>
r d2 u2 r&#x27; l&#x27; d2 u2 f2 b2 l r f2 b2 r&#x27;<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

You mean like:

case 1: r2 (uEd&#x27;)2 r2 (uEd&#x27;)2 r2 E2 r2 E2
             or
        r2 u2 r2 (uEd&#x27;)2 r2 d2 r2 E2
case 3: r2 E2 r2 (u&#x27;E)2 M2 u2 M2
case 5: r2 E2 r2 (Ed)2 (l&#x27;Mr)2 d2 (l&#x27;MR)2

?

Swapping around between opposite faces seems pretty easy. I am not
sure if these are optimal, but they&#x27;re certainly not very long.

Hey Gaetan,

what sense does it make to steal a video, cut it in half and reduce 
the quality if you could just as well point to the source?

Fine, don&#x27;t call it stealing. The question remains, though. Why do 
you copy a video, reducing runtime and quality, instead of simply 
pointing people to the original?

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan, Bruce,

Thanks so much for the help in finding some of these algs!

I&#x27;ve very excited to start using them, basically I plan on solving the
centers directly to one of the states that one of these algs fixes.  I
think this won&#x27;t come up often, but when it does come up, or is easy
to setup, then it will make memorizing the centers a good bit faster.
 That&#x27;s awesome because it would make the whole time a bit faster
since these algs are fast to execute when compared to 2-3 three cycles.

I mainly want to use these algs for the 5x5x5, but I plan on using the
Xcenter only versions on the 4x4x4 for swapping the entire center groups.

I&#x27;m trying to get my average sub-8 for the 4x4x4, and I think these
algs will at least help a little bit.  I&#x27;m still not sure what my
personal limits for the 5x5x5 will be, as I tend to practice the 4x4x4
more since it takes less than half as much time to do a solve on it. 
However, I plan on using these algs for the 5x5x5 as well.

I&#x27;m still messing around with the algs you guys listed and trying to
figure out how they work.  Stefan I really like your (u2 l2 r2)x2 alg
a lot.  And yes I feel dumb because it wasn&#x27;t obvious to me before :-(
but now I see how it works.

Bruce thanks for all your algs for the opposite centers cases, and the
one for the two adjacent center groups!

Thanks for the help guys, I really think these algs will help for the
bigger cubes BLD!

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I just had an idea to fix the edge parity and a center block at the<br>
same time.<br>
<br>
This alg is sort of the guts of one of the OLL parity algs.<br>
<br>
U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27;<br>
<br>
(taken from the alg r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2)<br>
<br>
Consider a long cycle of edges (a 24 cycle) given as<br>
(ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX)<br>
<br>
What you can do, if you have center blocks on opposite faces, is to<br>
setup the case that the alg U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; solves.<br>
<br>
You would setup the lUB edge and the lUF edge to be the A and X pieces<br>
in the cycle.  So you fix your center blocks, but you also swap the<br>
pieces A and X.<br>
<br>
In terms of the edge cycle that affects the cycle to create this new<br>
cycle:<br>
(BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX)<br>
<br>
This is because the piece in spot X was supposed to go to A, and you<br>
sent it there.  The piece in spot A was supposed to go to B, but you<br>
sent it to X.  Therefore X now goes to B.  This deletes only the A spot.<br>
<br>
But this is cool because you can reorder the cycle to be<br>
(XBCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW)<br>
<br>
And since I memorize by letter pairs anyway I haven&#x27;t affected any of<br>
my images, I have just switched my original first piece with what was<br>
originally the last piece, a really easy change to keep track of.<br>
<br>
Here is an example:<br>
I don&#x27;t want to type out the entire solve but I did an example solve<br>
on my 4x4x4.<br>
<br>
Basically on my cube right now I have solved the corners and almsot<br>
all the centers.  There are 4 unsolved centers setup into this block<br>
cycle swap on the U and D faces (flU+frU)&lt;-&gt;(brD+blD)<br>
<br>
My edge cycles have edge parity, and there&#x27;s no need to write the<br>
entire edge cycle correctly, just the pieces that matter.<br>
<br>
So to give you an idea of the cycle structure for now I&#x27;ll just put my<br>
letters.<br>
<br>
The egde cycle is (QCHOER)(JBKFVPMXGW)(NDSILUAT)<br>
<br>
During the solve I would know this is parity on the edges because each<br>
of my three cycles ends with a single letter image, and since I have<br>
an odd number of single letter images I know I have parity.  I think<br>
in general this might be too hard to notice, but I&#x27;ll talk more about<br>
that at the end of this post.<br>
<br>
Ok now here&#x27;s the idea.  I would usually just swap the two center<br>
blocks with (rl&#x27;) d2 (rl&#x27;)&#x27; U2 (rl&#x27;) d2 (rl&#x27;)&#x27; U2 and then later fix<br>
the edge parity when I come across it as (NT) at the very end of my solve.<br>
<br>
What I could do here is to consider if I can use that one alg above<br>
with my edge cycles.  My edge cycles in terms of how I memorized them<br>
have starting and end points of (QR)(JW)(NT).  These in actual piece<br>
names are (lUB lUF) (rUB dFL) (bUL lDF)<br>
<br>
Personally I think (lUB lUF) is easy to setup into this alg.<br>
<br>
I can use the setup alg: (f&#x27;b) L R&#x27; (fb&#x27;)<br>
<br>
Now I can apply the alg with U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27;<br>
<br>
This leaves the cycles: (Q)(RCHOE)(JBKFVPMXGW)(NDSILUAT)<br>
<br>
I then undo my setup moves with: (f&#x27;b) L&#x27; R (fb&#x27;)<br>
<br>
Which accomplishes my goal.  I have solved the center blocks I created<br>
on opposite faces.  Also I have fixed edge parity.<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
I think in general this would be very hard to do, but I think the<br>
times when I would actually be able to use it during a solve are when<br>
I have either a 22, or a 24 cycle of edges.  In this case it is very,<br>
very easy to determine parity, since you don&#x27;t have to look at but one<br>
cycle.  During a 22 cycle solve, if I happen to have center blocks on<br>
opposite faces, I could likely use this alg.<br>
<br>
I think this won&#x27;t come up very often, but hey neither do some<br>
speedcubing algs either.  I&#x27;m going to keep practicing this and see if<br>
I can actually use it during a solve one time.  It seems like it could<br>
speed things up when it comes up since you fix center blocks and<br>
parity all in one short alg, with setup moves of course.<br>
<br>
Just a thought, it seems like a cool idea, but I&#x27;m not sure yet if it<br>
will actually be practical.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Chris,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been reading with interest your posts on the memory group, and I <br>
can relate to what you&#x27;ve been posting.  I&#x27;m too lazy to join that <br>
group, but I read the messages.  <br>
<br>
As to rehearsing or going over your locations and images, I would say <br>
to just memorize them once with no going back.  Since I don&#x27;t do the <br>
4x, I may not be much help, but I know there is obviously more to <br>
memorize there.  So I would think you&#x27;d want to take a bit more time <br>
at each location, but don&#x27;t go back over them.  Try to make sure you <br>
really see the first image, because often just seeing the first image <br>
will trigger the rest.  Gradually you can push yourself to go faster; <br>
if you start going too fast, just slow down again to find the right <br>
pace.<br>
<br>
As to verbalizing the images, I can really relate to that.  I think <br>
it&#x27;s ok to do that, in fact using letters I find you almost have to.  <br>
When I&#x27;m not concentrating well, I sometimes just verbalize the <br>
images.  I often forget them this way, since I don&#x27;t have a picture <br>
in my head.  However, I find I can sometimes get away with just using <br>
words without seeing a picture if the words themselves are memorable.<br>
For example, maybe it&#x27;s a person doing something and the combo is <br>
unforgetable, even if I don&#x27;t see the image.  But if the words are <br>
too normal, like &#x27;cap&#x27; and &#x27;foot&#x27;, I usually have to make an image <br>
out of that, and even then it is sometimes difficult; sometimes I mix <br>
up the order too.  <br>
<br>
So with the 3x, I usually use a combo of verbalizing and making <br>
images.  The images are more reliable, but you have to make them <br>
quickly, and that&#x27;s the challenge for me.  The key for me is not to  <br>
spend too much time making an image.  The memory experts do this in a <br>
sec or two, but I can&#x27;t do that too often, unless the image is a nice <br>
memorable one and I&#x27;m concentrating well.  The problem is sometimes <br>
the image is no good, and I don&#x27;t recall it when solving.  You have <br>
to find the right pace to make images and still be able to solve <br>
without taking too much time to recall the images; it&#x27;s a challenge <br>
for me.<br>
<br>
One thing I notice is I use a lot of people as images, and sometimes <br>
I mix them up.  And I find I have some combos that don&#x27;t really work <br>
well together.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I can relate to your problems cuz I&#x27;ve encountered the same <br>
and am still working on them.<br>

          <div class="email-content">It was great, I walked into walmart 2am Thursday morning, to get some <br>
groceries.  I was wondering why there was a crowd in the lobby.  I <br>
bought some cereal and milk, then I came back into the store.  I <br>
started to cube in the lobby.  The crowd looked towards me.  They <br>
were shocked.  I did about a dozen speedsolves, they were asking <br>
questions.  They were quite amazed.  <br>
<br>
I said, well lemme do this one last video, (some of them were <br>
recording me with their camera phones)<br>
Then I went to my car and grabbed my blindfold.  I put my earphones <br>
in, and asked one of them to mix it up.  They handed it to me, and I <br>
started to memorize it.  It was insane, I wasn&#x27;t nervous, because the <br>
music was drowning out the environmental noise, and I was visually <br>
focusing on the cube.  I did 5 bld attempts.  3 were successful.  The <br>
4th I totally botched, I lost the recall shortly after doning the <br>
blindfold.  The 5th, something odd happened.  I permuted all of the <br>
corners, however, 5 of the cubies were misoriented.  I use two <br>
cycles, so there was no misorientation error, as in that step.  It <br>
was odd that 5 of the cubies were misoriented, when the recall felt <br>
so perfect.  I mean if you forget one cubies orientation, and you <br>
guess wrong, that cubie and the cubie afterwards will be <br>
misoriented.  However, I don&#x27;t know how I botched 5 orientations <br>
during a when I only had 6 permuations<br>
<br>
They all agreeded, that even if none of them got the PS3, they&#x27;d <br>
always remember that day, they got something great that day.  Two of <br>
them were brothers, they actually bought a cube, and I told them how <br>
to solve it.  I helped them understand the the cross permutation and <br>
f2l with working corner.<br>
<br>
Other than that highlight, I&#x27;ve had a really bad week.  Maybe the <br>
stress levels of my normal life will kick me into the zone, so that <br>
the mental stess dimminishes even more, as it did for me a month ago <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been working really hard on the 4x4x4 for BLD lately, trying to<br>
really push myself to the limit.  I&#x27;m trying to find out what works to<br>
really speed up this cube, then I plan to try to apply the same idea<br>
to the 5x5x5.  Lately my times have been improving, and I really think<br>
a sub-8 average average will be possible with a few months more practice.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m starting to get to the point where I know all of my images and<br>
journey locations really really well.  I hardly ever have a delay in<br>
recalling what an image is given the two letters, and most of the time<br>
I not only recall the image but I&#x27;m comfortable with the personality<br>
of that image based on my previous solves, so I instantly know how to<br>
have it interact with the other images.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve found that what is helping me to get better times is to go<br>
REALLY, REALLY fast during both memorization and solving.<br>
<br>
By really fast, I mean to really push yourself way beyond your<br>
abilities.  This leads to quite a lot of DNFs, and I mean a LOT. <br>
However you get to a point where your brain sort of gets used to going<br>
at this crazy break neck speed, and you just get this sort of click<br>
where you go &quot;I&#x27;m tired of getting DNFs when I go this fast, I know I<br>
can do this!&quot;  Then really suddenly your accuracy comes back and you<br>
are not only accurate again, but a lot faster.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m starting to average about 8:30 for the 4x4x4 BLD with maybe a<br>
66%-75% accuracy rate, and lately have been getting a decent number of<br>
sub-8 solves as well as sub-8:30 solves.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not posting this to try to brag, but to say that I really think<br>
for BLD that one of the best ways to improve is to push yourself to go<br>
MUCH MUCH faster than your brain can handle for both memorization and<br>
solving.  I mean really push yourself, so fast that you actually are<br>
unable to complete the cube and DNF a lot.  Over time though you will<br>
begin to adjust to thinking that hard that quickly and your times will<br>
come back.<br>
<br>
I know I haven&#x27;t posted in a while about BLD cubing in general, other<br>
than about algs or whatever.  I really want to start posting some<br>
ideas on my site about what I&#x27;ve learned from BLD practice, but I<br>
wanted to post about this, since this strategy has really been helping<br>
me to speed up my 4x4 BLD.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know if this applies as well to the 3x3x3, I really don&#x27;t<br>
consider that my strong point, but for the bigger cubes I really<br>
couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results of really pushing myself to the<br>
limit.  Eventually your brain just gets used to doing this and all of<br>
a sudden you get this &quot;click&quot; moment where you can handle thinking<br>
like that.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to post, as lately I&#x27;ve had a big jump in progress and I<br>
really think I can get sub-8 with more practice.  I think the eventual<br>
limits for the 4x4x4 are sub-6, but just baaaarely.  Like maybe 5:58<br>
or 5:59, but I think it is possible.<br>
<br>
So sub-8 is a far cry from the total limit, but hey it&#x27;s step closer.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps anyone currently working on big cubes BLD, and also<br>
if this applies to the 3x3x3 I hope it helps there too.<br>
<br>
Happy BLD&#x27;ing everyone, and keep shooting for those DNFs.  And yes I<br>
did just say that, try for the DNFs so that eventually your brain gets<br>
used to thinking at a faster speed and your accuracy comes back.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello, Rutgers went bad.  Craig and I DNFd both solves.  He and I were rather disappointed, that we were rushed, and unable to compete in a third solve, due to lack of time.  It was really bad, because with success, Craig and I could have blown the others away.
  However, Congrats to everybody who successfully solved a cube at Rutgers!
   
  I didn&#x27;t compete in 4x4 bld as I had planned, I was way too tired.  And I wasn&#x27;t successfully solving the 3x3 at all during practice today, so I tried to prepare myself, and left the 4x4 bld for another day.
   
  What I wanted to know from you Chris is what is this Journey system.  I know the images, but I don&#x27;t understand a journey image.  You&#x27;re walking a trail, and to significant landmarks, these would be the journey images?
   
  How could I go about making journey images?  And what are they exactly, what role do they play in memorizing the cube?  Is it to preserve sequence?

          <div class="email-content">I also must agree!  Pushing your limits on a long term scale increases your speed amazingly.  You&#x27;ll first see a time reduction in your DNFs, you&#x27;ll start of with 3:00xx dnfs, then 2:4x.xx dnfs, then eventually sub 2:30 and sub 2!  I&#x27;ve set my personal best of 2:35, and I wasn&#x27;t even close to these times at the competition.

I&#x27;m not posting this to try to brag, but to say that I really think
for BLD that one of the best ways to improve is to push yourself to go
MUCH MUCH faster than your brain can handle for both memorization and
solving. I mean really push yourself, so fast that you actually are
unable to complete the cube and DNF a lot. Over time though you will
begin to adjust to thinking that hard that quickly and your times will
come back.

I know I haven&#x27;t posted in a while about BLD cubing in general, other
than about algs or whatever. I really want to start posting some
ideas on my site about what I&#x27;ve learned from BLD practice, but I
wanted to post about this, since this strategy has really been helping
me to speed up my 4x4 BLD.

I don&#x27;t know if this applies as well to the 3x3x3, I really don&#x27;t
consider that my strong point, but for the bigger cubes I really
couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results of really pushing myself to the
limit. Eventually your brain just gets used to doing this and all of
a sudden you get this &quot;click&quot; moment where you can handle thinking
like that.

Just wanted to post, as lately I&#x27;ve had a big jump in progress and I
really think I can get sub-8 with more practice. I think the eventual
limits for the 4x4x4 are sub-6, but just baaaarely. Like maybe 5:58
or 5:59, but I think it is possible.

So sub-8 is a far cry from the total limit, but hey it&#x27;s step closer.

I hope this helps anyone currently working on big cubes BLD, and also
if this applies to the 3x3x3 I hope it helps there too.

Happy BLD&#x27;ing everyone, and keep shooting for those DNFs. And yes I
did just say that, try for the DNFs so that eventually your brain gets
used to thinking at a faster speed and your accuracy comes back.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey James,

I&#x27;ve had a few other people ask me this too, and I am trying to get a
section about this on my website, but I&#x27;ll respond here for now so at
least I can put something out for everyone to read.

I use a three cycle approach, and I don&#x27;t use algs at all for the 4x4
or 5x5 centers, I use the following intuitive process to come up with
commutators:

Setup:
------
1) You must have two pieces on the same slice, and one piece off that
slice.  These are the &quot;slice pieces&quot;, and they are on the &quot;main slice.&quot;

1a) The two pieces on the main slice must be &quot;interchangeable&quot; (as per
Doug Li), meaning that one piece can be placed into the position of
the other with just a turn of that slice.

2) The piece not on the main slice is called the &quot;lone&quot; piece.  This
piece must easily be able to replace one of the slice pieces without
affecting any other pieces on the main slice.

The Commutator:
---------------
Step 1) Place the lone piece into the main slice such that it replaces
one of the slice pieces.  The location in the main slice where you
just replaced that piece is now called the &quot;action&quot; spot.  It is
literally where you will do all the work for this commutator.

Step 2) Interchange the other slice piece &quot;the one you have not
affected yet&quot; into the action spot by turning the main slice.

Step 3) Undo the move you did in step 1

Step 4) Undo the main slice turn you did in step 2

And that&#x27;s it.

Ok here&#x27;s an example.

The cycle is dfL->frU->blU->dfL and is just a three cycle.

I literally think through all of the steps I listed above each time I
encounter a three cycle.

Setup:
------
1) My &quot;main slice&quot; is the U layer.  My &quot;slice pieces&quot; are frU and blU.

1a) I can interchange blU to the frU spot by doing the slice turn U2.
 I can interchange frU to the blU spot by doing U2.

2) The dfL piece is the &quot;lone&quot; center.  This is because it is not on
the U slice.  I can place the dfL piece, the lone center, into the blU
spot by doing l&#x27; d&#x27; l.  I can place the dfL piece into the frU spot by
doing r&#x27; d r.  Either move does not affect any other piece in the U
layer, so it is my choice as to which to use during the solve.

The Commutator:
---------------
Step 1)  I have to place the lone center into the main slice, such
that I replace one of the slice centers without affecting any other
piece in the U layer.  I can do this in one of two ways.  I can
replace blU with the move l&#x27; d&#x27; l or I can replace frU with the move
r&#x27; d r.  I choose r&#x27; d r.  The reason is because the dfL center is
supposed to go to the frU center in this cycle.

At this step I perform the moves r&#x27; d r.

Step 2) I have now replaced the frU center with the lone center.  Now
the frU location on the cube becomes the &quot;action&quot; spot.  I now have to
place the other main slice center into the action spot.  I can do this
with the move U2.  This moves the blU center to frU, and into the
action spot.

Step 3) I now undo the move I did in step 1.  This moves the piece
that was originally in the frU location back into the action spot. 
(Step 1 sort of moves it into limbo, and Step 3 brings it back).  So
at this step do r&#x27; d&#x27; r.

Step 4) I now undo the main slice turn I did, the U2, with its inverse
of U2.

--------------

Final result: I performed the algorithm r&#x27; d r U2 r&#x27; d&#x27; r U2 for the
three cycle dfL->frU->blU->dfL.

------------------------------------------

I do not have any algs memorized for either of the centers or edges
step for either of the 4x4x4 or 5x5x5.  I actually go through this
process every time.  Some types of commutators come up more frequently
though, so in a sense I do have them memorized, but not as algs.  I
still think of them in terms of the steps above, I just sort of group
many steps together if it is a very common case.

If your current three cycle on your centers is not setup correctly,
then you will need to do a setup turn, or maybe even two.

Here is an example.

Harder three cycle:
-------------------
dfL->drF->dbR->dfL

This is a three cycle, but let&#x27;s look at the setup.

Setup:
------
1) My main slice is the inner d layer.  However all three pieces are
now &quot;slice&quot; pieces, and I have no &quot;lone&quot; piece.

1a) Any of the three pieces can be interchanged with any other with a
d turn, so this part is ok.

2) I have no lone piece, this is a problem.

Setup Fix:
----------
I have to fix the current state before I can go on, because I haven&#x27;t
even satisfied the setup part.  There&#x27;s no way I can do a &quot;freestyle&quot;
commutator from this point.  By freestyle commutator I mean the steps
I have been describing here.

To fix this situation I need to look at my current setup.  The only
thing wrong is that I have no lone piece.  Everything else is ready to
start.  In that case I just need to turn one of my three d layer
centers off the d layer.  I choose to do this with the move f.

Move performed at this step: f

I have now placed the dfL piece on the U layer, at lfU.  So my cycle
is now lfU->drF->dbR->lfU.

In this new three cycle I have to look at my setup:

New setup:
----------
1) My main slice is the inner d layer.  My slice centers are the drF
and dbR centers.

1a) I can interchange the slice centers with either a d or d&#x27; move.

2) My lone center is at flU

The Commutator:
---------------
1) I need to place the flU piece into the d layer such that I replace
one of the slice centers, and also such that I don&#x27;t affect any other
piece on the d slice.  I can do this with either r U&#x27; r&#x27; or b U2 b&#x27;. 
I choose to do this via r U&#x27; r&#x27;.  This is because the lfU piece is
supposed to go to the drF spot in this cycle.

Move performed at this step: r U&#x27; r&#x27;

2) I have replaced the drF spot, so it becomes my action spot.  I now
need to move the other slice center into the action spot.  I do this
with the turn d&#x27;.

Move performed at this step: d&#x27;

3) I now undo the alg I did in step 1 with r U r&#x27;.  This brings the
original piece that was at drF and places it in the action spot.  It
brings it back from being in limbo so to speak.

4) I now undo the main slice turn with d.

Don&#x27;t forgot to undo the setup turn you did once you finish the
commutator.  My setup turn was f, so I now undo with f&#x27;

---------

Final result:

I performed the alg f r U&#x27; r&#x27; d&#x27; r U r&#x27; d f&#x27; to solve the harder three
cycle dfL->drF->dbR->dfL.

This isn&#x27;t really an alg though, notice how it was all very intuitive.
 You can understand the reasoning and the purpose behind every move. 
In fact you are literally coming up with this entire commutator on the
fly.  This does not require memorizing anything more than the process
I&#x27;ve listed with each step and what you need to do at each one.

-----------------------------------------

I hope this helps.  I know it&#x27;s a lot to read, but that is exactly
what I do for both the centers and edges.  The only &quot;algs&quot; you have to
learn are how to insert the lone edge into the main slice without
affecting any other piece on that slice.  That&#x27;s the only &quot;alg&quot; part,
and all those algs are 100% intuitive and all only 3 moves long.

If you want to solve using a three cycle approach I give this one my
highest recommendation.  My record solving phase on a successful 4x4x4
blindfolded solve is about 3 minutes 22 seconds.  My average is
probably 3:55-4:05 right now, and I am still improving.  I think I can
get my average sub-4 all the time with more practice and more
experience with these commutators.

Let me know if this helps, but that&#x27;s exactly how I approach the
centers and edges of both the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I normally try to keep from clogging the group here with posts about<br>
big cubes BLD, but I had to post about this.<br>
<br>
I just broke my record for 4x4x4 BLD with a new best time of 7:23.28<br>
minutes!  The coolest part though was the breakdown of the solve.<br>
<br>
The memorization took me about 4:25-4:26 I can&#x27;t remember which<br>
exactly.  Let&#x27;s just say 4:26 to be safe.  This means that I solved in<br>
2 minutes 57 seconds, a sub-3 minute solve while blindfolded!<br>
<br>
I was trying something new on this solve, and that was to memorize at<br>
my normal pace, but to try to plan ahead what my next step would be<br>
while executing the current step.  4:26 memorization is fairly average<br>
for me right now, maybe 5-10 seconds slower than my overall average<br>
average for memo.  But 2:57 solving is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever done<br>
on the solving phase, by about 23 seconds!<br>
<br>
What I did was while I was actually performing a three cycle to try to<br>
not only see which images come up for my next three cycle, but to<br>
picture which pieces those are and also which three cycle I will use.<br>
 I found that this meant that a couple times I did 2 three cycles one<br>
right after the other with hardly any delay between them!  I&#x27;d like to<br>
get to the point where I can do this continuously throughout the whole<br>
solve, I definitely think it will be possible.<br>
<br>
I was thinking that to speed up I needed to work solely on memo, but<br>
this showed me my solving has a ways to go too.<br>
<br>
With my record 3:20 fastest ever correct memorization and this new<br>
2:57 fastest ever correct solve I predict a 6:17 solve overall will be<br>
possible for the 4x4x4, and most likely even faster.  I&#x27;m starting to<br>
really think that a sub-6 minute overall solve might actually be a<br>
possiblity with another year or two of practice (for a best single<br>
time, not an average I mean).<br>
<br>
Yay big cubes BLD!  This is so much fun!  I really can see improvement<br>
in this just like in regular speedcubing.  You don&#x27;t improve for a<br>
while, and then you make a big jump.  Then you hit a plateau for a<br>
while and later have another big jump - just like speedcubing.<br>
<br>
I think you don&#x27;t really need a phenomenal natural memory right from<br>
the start, you can just treat it like speedcubing and practice a lot<br>
to get faster memorization times.<br>
<br>
Just had to post, I&#x27;m focusing almost entirely on my 4x4x4 BLD right<br>
now, but will eventually start trying to apply what I learn to the<br>
5x5x5 as well.  I really want to start getting sub-20 minutes on the<br>
5x5x5 fairly often before RWC2007, and averaging sub-8 on 4x4x4 as well.<br>
<br>
Happy BLD&#x27;ing all!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Chris, <br>
First and foremost:<br>
<br>
&quot;I normally try to keep from clogging the group here with posts about<br>
big cubes BLD, but I had to post about this.&quot;<br>
<br>
First off, this is a blindfolded cubing forum.  We are getting <br>
spammed with random crap from people that probably don&#x27; even cube.  <br>
You&#x27;re posts are at least on topic.  You&#x27;re not bragging either, <br>
you&#x27;re just keeping us posted.<br>
<br>
You&#x27;re making progress that is amazing.  With, if you didn&#x27;t pioneer <br>
the bigcube blindfolded field, nobody else really would have.  Just <br>
as when Gilles Roux and Thom Barlow pioneer&#x27;d the Roux method.  Many <br>
more now use the method just because of a few persons&#x27; success with <br>
the method.<br>
<br>
You can explore many things, and they&#x27;ll be shunned.  This can be <br>
discouraging, causing you to no longer develop the method, just <br>
because you never gave it the time to become fast before revealing <br>
your works.  We&#x27;d talked about this in Florida.  This also applies <br>
to literary arts, such as Moby Dick by Herman Mellville, nothing <br>
became of his works &#x27;til he died, same with Picasso.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I must give major props, because my visual edge permutation <br>
was taking me about 2:30!<br>
<br>
Keep us posted, and help us understand your approach to memo and <br>
execution on the cube as a whole.  I&#x27;ve just modified my corner <br>
permutation method.  I now use the left and right handed Y Perms, <br>
and the J perm conjugated.<br>
<br>
I changed my edge alg U&#x27;R&#x27;UL&#x27;U2RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2RL to LU&#x27;R&#x27;UL&#x27;U2RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2R<br>
Moving the L from the end to the Front.  I realized that this was <br>
Pochmann&#x27;s alg, it was just a slow progress from my original <br>
F2L&#x27;U&#x27;LF2R&#x27;DR&#x27;D&#x27;R2.  I did this so I could differentiate between the <br>
two J perms.  <br>
My other change:  Random Alg to Left Handed Y Perm<br>
zU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;R2UDR&#x27;U&#x27;RD&#x27;R2U2z&#x27; to L&#x27;ULUL&#x27;U&#x27;LFL&#x27;U&#x27;LULF&#x27;L&#x27;<br>
<br>
I found a powerful Optimization of the Y perms:<br>
RU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FR can be conjugated by R*<br>
Let G = [U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;F]<br>
The sum of the R at the start and the R at the end must equal R2<br>
So if you do G, you must end with R2.<br>
If you do R&#x27;G, you must end with R&#x27;<br>
If you do RG, you must end with R<br>
and If you do R2G, you end with R*0<br>
<br>
This just makes the execution flow so much better.<br>
I use a 6 alg system for blindfolded cubing.  And I am very happy <br>
with the system.  I&#x27;m also looking into 3-cycles for blindfolded.  <br>
they are so powerful, I need to learn to use them efficiently!  The <br>
MUD subset is very powerful.  <br>
<br>
Good Luck Chris, and all blindfold cubist!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
So yeah the work on the webpage is not proceding very well due to my<br>
jobs :-(<br>
<br>
I really don&#x27;t want to be the guy that says I&#x27;ll write up some info<br>
but then never does.  So, here is an example solve of 4x4x4 BLD -<br>
literally every single thing that goes through my head when I do a solve.<br>
<br>
Below is the scramble and the description of everything about the<br>
solve.  Before you scramble please hold the cube in the same<br>
orienation you consider to be the &quot;solved&quot; orientation.  This will<br>
make it much easier to follow along with what I am doing.<br>
<br>
Scramble:<br>
F B R2 b r D&#x27; B&#x27; d2 l&#x27; D2 b L&#x27; U2 L2 f d&#x27; F&#x27; b l2 U&#x27; d2 L&#x27; F&#x27; D2 B2 L<br>
f2 F2 d&#x27; f&#x27; b d B2 b r2 D2 f U2 d l<br>
<br>
I actually memorized and solved this scramble before typing up this<br>
example to make sure I would write up exactly what I do, even during a<br>
real solve.  The overall time was 8:41.85 minutes, which is pretty<br>
much right at my average lately, which has been in the 8:40&#x27;s.  The<br>
memorization step took 4:33 minutes and the solving then took 3:58<br>
minutes.<br>
<br>
After the scramble I always rotate the cube around to find the<br>
position with the most centers already solved.  After scrambling the<br>
cube I did the rotation z&#x27; x&#x27;.  If you don&#x27;t like xyz notation I first<br>
rotated the whole cube counterclockwise as if I was doing the move F&#x27;<br>
and I then rotated the whole cube as if I was doing the move R&#x27;<br>
<br>
After the cube rotation I now have the following cycles on the cube:<br>
<br>
centers:<br>
lbU -&gt; ufR -&gt; ulF -&gt; brD -&gt; drB -&gt; lfD -&gt; rbU -&gt; buL -&gt; flU -&gt; dbL -&gt;<br>
urF -&gt; dfR -&gt; rfU -&gt; drF -&gt; dbR -&gt; rfD -&gt; dlF -&gt; lbU<br>
<br>
edges: <br>
1) (lBU -&gt; fUR -&gt; fUL -&gt; lDB -&gt; uFR -&gt; fDR -&gt; rDB -&gt; bUR -&gt; lUF -&gt; dBL<br>
-&gt; uFL -&gt; uBR -&gt; bDL -&gt; dFR -&gt; rBU -&gt; lDF -&gt; uBL -&gt; bDR -&gt; lBU)<br>
2) (rUF &lt;-&gt; dFL)<br>
3) (bUL -&gt; fDL -&gt; dBR -&gt; rDF -&gt; bUL)<br>
<br>
I always memorize and solve in this order for the 4x4x4:<br>
<br>
1) memorize center permutation<br>
2) memorize edge permutation<br>
3) memorize corner permutaiton<br>
4) memorize corner orientation<br>
5) solve corner orientation<br>
6) solve corner permutation<br>
7) solve center permutation<br>
8) solve edge permutation<br>
<br>
During the memorization of this solve I debated memorizing and solving<br>
with center blocks on the F and R faces, but decided against it<br>
because I had already memorized one of the pieces I would have made a<br>
block out of into an image, and didn&#x27;t want to rewrite the first<br>
journey location any.<br>
<br>

S -&gt; F -&gt; K -&gt; D -&gt; H -&gt; L -&gt; X -&gt; G -&gt; A<br>
<br>
The journey I was using was halfway through one of my 28 location<br>
journeys.  This particular journey is a walk from my dormitory my<br>
junior year of college through to my class on the other side of campus.<br>
<br>
At each location I need to put at least three images, sometimes more<br>
which does happen on this solve during the edge memorization.<br>
<br>
Let me walk through each location one at a time:<br>
<br>
Location 1:<br>
-----------<br>
This location is outside the dining hall with a bunch of tables and<br>
chairs.<br>
<br>
At this location I have the letters AIEVO.  I take the very first<br>
letter and give it a single letter image (famous person).  This is so<br>
I know which piece is the first piece of every one of my three cycles.<br>
 The letter is &quot;A&quot; so the image is &quot;Dan Aykroyd&quot;.<br>
<br>
Ok, so now I have to take the letters in pairs after the first image<br>
is made.  The next two are IE which is the Internet Explorer logo,<br>
only about 6 feet tall.  The next two letters are VO which is a 2 foot<br>
tall Volcano that is spewing and erupting a huge column of ash.<br>
<br>
I put these images in a left-to-right order.  So on the left Dan<br>
Aykroyd is rolling a giant 6 foot tall model of the Internet Explorer<br>
logo onto the top of the two foot tall volcano to clog it up and make<br>
it stop erupting ash everywhere.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s it.  I don&#x27;t really view the motion, it is just implied.  I see<br>
the tables and chairs and the dining hall very clearly in the<br>
background, and in the foreground I see Dan Aykroyd (motionless) in<br>
the act of rolling the Internet Explorer logo onto the volcano.  I<br>
picture the logo about 3/4 the way up the volcano, so that the volcano<br>
is still to the right of the Internet Explorer logo, which is to the<br>
right of Dan Aykroyd.<br>
<br>
Location 2:<br>
-----------<br>
This location is beside a wall about 20 feet away from the dining hall<br>
on the way to a set of stairs.<br>
<br>
At this location I have the letters WBQCSF.  I now take letters in<br>
pairs always to make double images.  The letters WB form the image of<br>
a giant 6 foot tall spider web between two large tree limbs.  The<br>
letters QC form the image of a two foot tall Quaich.  The letters SF<br>
form an image of a 4 foot tall model of the San Francisco Golden Gate<br>
bridge.<br>
<br>
At this location I can very clearly see the wall, as well as the hand<br>
railing leading to the stairwell that is the next location (all in the<br>
background).  In the foreground I very clearly see (in left to right<br>
order) a giant web where a Quaich is falling into it having rolled off<br>
the end of the miniature San Francisco Golden Gate bridge.<br>
<br>
Location 3:<br>
-----------<br>
This location is at the bottom of the stair case pictured at the last<br>
location.  I view it from the top of the staircase, looking at the<br>
space just after the last step at the bottom.  There are maybe 6 steps<br>
to this staircase.<br>
<br>
The letters at this location are KDHLXG.  KD forms the image of Billy<br>
the Kid the famous gunslinger.  HL form the image of Satan as<br>
described by Dante in Dante&#x27;s Inferno.  The only difference is my<br>
image of him is about 5 feet tall instead of the massive proportions<br>
Dante gives him.  The letters XG form the image of Gambit from the<br>
X-men (the guy who charges stuff with energy and the object then<br>
explodes after a few seconds).<br>
<br>
This image is graphic, but this is exactly how I memorize.  I picture,<br>
in left to right order, Billy the kid drawing his pistol and quickly<br>
unloading all 6 rounds into Satan, who is trapped in the ice as in<br>
Dante&#x27;s Inferno.  This doesn&#x27;t kill Satan, but only wounds him.  To<br>
the right of Satan Gambit charges a playing card (his usual weapon)<br>
and places it in the mouth of Satan.  When the card explodes it<br>
explodes Satan&#x27;s head and blood and guts are thrown absolutely everywhere.<br>
<br>
Yes this image is graphic, but because of that it was very easy to<br>
memorize.  Anything funny or violent tends to be easier to hold onto.<br>
<br>
**********<br>
BLAST DOOR<br>
**********<br>
<br>
Yes that literally is a blast door, like for a bomb shelter.  I<br>
imagine a 200 foot tall steel blast door dropping down onto my journey<br>
in the space between the 3rd location and the 4th.  I image that in<br>
order to get past the door I have to fly over it as if I were in a<br>
helicopter, and I literally picture this flight over the blast door. <br>
This is my marker that the centers are now done - i.e. when I get to<br>
the blast door during the solving phase, I know that what follows is<br>
now information for the edges.<br>
<br>
edge cycles:<br>
1) (lBU -&gt; fUR -&gt; fUL -&gt; lDB -&gt; uFR -&gt; fDR -&gt; rDB -&gt; bUR -&gt; lUF -&gt; dBL<br>
-&gt; uFL -&gt; uBR -&gt; bDL -&gt; dFR -&gt; rBU -&gt; lDF -&gt; uBL -&gt; bDR -&gt; lBU)<br>
2) (rUF &lt;-&gt; dFL)<br>
3) (bUL -&gt; fDL -&gt; dBR -&gt; rDF -&gt; bUL)<br>
<br>
edge cycles as letters:<br>
1) (Q -&gt; F -&gt; E -&gt; S -&gt; D -&gt; H -&gt; L -&gt; M -&gt; R -&gt; U -&gt; C -&gt; B -&gt; P -&gt; X<br>
-&gt; J -&gt; T -&gt; A -&gt; O -&gt; Q)<br>
2) (I &lt;-&gt; W)<br>
3) (N -&gt; G -&gt; V -&gt; K)<br>
<br>
Location 4:<br>
-----------<br>
I am now memorzing the edge permutation.  This location is at a &quot;+&quot;<br>
shaped intersection of two very large walkways leading into one of the<br>
quads on my school that is a very large enclosed rectangular space<br>
formed by about 8 buildings.  I can clearly see the open space of the<br>
quad, as well as the two walkways at this location.<br>
<br>
The letters at this location are QFESD.  I need to know which piece<br>
will be my main piece, or the one that will be the first piece in all<br>
of my cycles, so I take the first letter &quot;Q&quot; and make it into an<br>
image.  The letter Q goes with the image &quot;Queen&quot;.  I now take the<br>
letters in pairs after the first piece.  The next two letters FE form<br>
the image of a 10 foot tall Ferris Wheel.  The next two letters SD<br>
form the image of a 10 foot long Star Destroyer (like from Star Wars)<br>
that is floating in the air about 6 feet above the ground.<br>
<br>
In left to right order I see the Queen hiding behind a miniature<br>
Ferris Wheel while a miniature Star Destroyer bombards it with lasers<br>
and explosives of all kinds.  The ferris wheel is on fire and so<br>
decrepit it is about to collapse.<br>
<br>
Location 5:<br>
-----------<br>
This location is part-way down a pedestrian walkway that goes into the<br>
center of the large quad we are now in.  I can picture a big tree and<br>
a small wall to the right.<br>
<br>
At this location I have the letters HLMRUC.  HL stands for the Satan<br>
as portrayed by Dante again.  MR stands for Marvin the paranoid<br>
android from Hitchiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy (as portrayed in the<br>
movie).  UC stands for a Unicorn.  In left to right order I see Satan<br>
frozen in the ice trying to frighten Marvin the android, who could not<br>
be more unimpressed.  Satan gets pissed off about this, so he posesses<br>
a unicorn just to the right of (behind) Marvin and has the Unicorn ram<br>
it&#x27;s horn through Marvin&#x27;s head, effectively killing him.<br>
<br>
Location 6:<br>
-----------<br>
This location is the center of the quad, where the two largest<br>
walkways meet at a sort of tall skinny &quot;X&quot; shape.  I can see the<br>
buildings on the other side of the quad as well as a very big tree to<br>
the left at this location.<br>
<br>
Here I have the letters BPXJTA.  BP stands for a backpack which is<br>
oversized (about 6 feet tall) and filled with 100&#x27;s of regular sized<br>
books.  XJ is the image of Jubilee from the X-men.  TA is the image of<br>
a tank with it&#x27;s gun turret pointed menacingly at the object next to it.<br>
<br>
In left to right order I see a backpack lying on the ground, filled to<br>
the brim with books.  Jubilee is using her sparks to completely<br>
destroy the backpack which is now on fire and billowing smoke<br>
everywhere.  Behind her a tank aims and takes a shot from it&#x27;s huge<br>
gun turret but Jubilee ducks out of the way just in time.<br>
<br>
I normally stop after three images, but this time I see that the next<br>
piece, the &quot;O&quot; piece, goes to the &quot;Q&quot; spot and completes this cycle. <br>
Instead of starting at a new location I tack on my single letter &quot;O&quot;<br>
image (Ozzy Osbourne) behind the tank, as if he were orchestrating the<br>
whole incident of the tank firing on Jubilee.<br>
<br>
This cycle is now finished.  I know I am not done memorizing edges<br>
though, because I have only used three journey locations, and the<br>
average is 4 for edges.  During the actual solve I looked around for<br>
an edge I had not used yet when I spotted the two cycle (rUF &lt;-&gt; dFL)<br>
or in my letters that is (I &lt;-&gt; W).  Rather than start this image at<br>
the next journey location, since a two cycle is always just one image,<br>
I tack it on to the current location just behind Ozzy Osbourne, only<br>
surrounded by curtains on both the left and right.  This is my<br>
miniature, within a journey location, form for the &quot;BLAST DOOR&quot;.  It<br>
lets me know that the image within the curtains is a two cycle.  I got<br>
this idea from John Louis, so thank you very much!  The image for IW<br>
is a &quot;Y-Wing&quot; space fighter from Star Wars.  Within curtains I imagine<br>
the Y-Wing taking aim at Ozzy Osbourney (through the curtains) to take<br>
him out and make him stop firing on Jubilee with the Tank.<br>
<br>
REHEARSAL:<br>
----------<br>
OK so I know I have used a 3 locations, and a little more since there<br>
are 5 images at my 3rd location instead of the usual 3.  I know that I<br>
am not done, but I have no idea how many edges are left to look for. <br>
So I go over my images (just for edges).  I sort of half use this as<br>
rehearsal for my edges and half to just count them and find out how<br>
many edges I have memorized right now.  I counted 20 edges when I went<br>
back through my edge images.  I now glance quickly at the cube to see<br>
that no edges are already in their solved locations - I saw none.  So<br>
I know that there are 4 edges somewhere to look for.  I find them and<br>
they are in one cycle, which I put at my last location.<br>
<br>
Location 7:<br>
-----------<br>
This location is on the other side of the quad.  I am very close to<br>
the buildings that before were only in the background.<br>
<br>
At this location I have the 4 cycle (N-&gt;G-&gt;V-&gt;K-&gt;N).  I take the N and<br>
make it into a single letter image, that of Chuck Norris.  The GV I<br>
put together as a giant Gavel, about 6 feet tall.  Since I only have<br>
one piece left, the K, I make it into a single letter image of Chris<br>
Katan from Saturday Night Live.<br>
<br>
In left to right order I see Chuck Norris roundhouse kicking a giant<br>
Gavel so hard that it slams into Chris Katan and knocks him over.<br>
<br>
****END OF JOURNEY****<br>
<br>
I now know that I am done memorizing the centers and edges, since I<br>
have accounted for all 24 edges.  I now memorize the Corner<br>
permutation visually and the Corner orientation visually.  Then I put<br>
on the blindfolded.<br>
<br>
*************<br>
SOLVING PHASE<br>
*************<br>
<br>
Solving the corners is pretty uninteresting I think, since you can<br>
just use the same stuff as from the 2x2x2 or 3x3x3.  The only change<br>
is that you *HAVE* to use supercube safe algs (algs that don&#x27;t rotate<br>
center caps if done on a supercube).<br>
<br>
Here is how I solved the corners:<br>
<br>
Corner orientation:<br>
y&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U R L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; followed by U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;<br>
L&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; L2 y<br>
<br>
or if you don&#x27;t prefer xyz notation the above is equivalent to F&#x27; U2 F<br>
U F&#x27; U F B U2 B&#x27; U&#x27; B U&#x27; B&#x27; followed by U&#x27; F U F&#x27; U&#x27; F U F&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27; F U<br>
F&#x27; U&#x27; F U F&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27; F U F&#x27; U&#x27; F U F&#x27; B2<br>
<br>
Corner permutation:<br>
1) UBL-&gt;DFL-&gt;UFL : D F2 L&#x27; B&#x27; L F2 L&#x27; B L D&#x27;<br>
2) UBL-&gt;UFR-&gt;DBL : (L B&#x27; L&#x27; B)x3 D2 (R F&#x27; R&#x27; F)x3 D2<br>
3) (UBL &lt;-&gt; DBR) and (UBR &lt;-&gt; DFR) : F2 D (L&#x27; B L B&#x27;)x3 D&#x27; F2<br>
<br>
Centers:<br>
--------<br>
Ok time to actually solve the centers now.<br>
<br>
First location: Dan Aykroyd-&gt;Internet Explorer-&gt;Volcano<br>
A-&gt;IE-&gt;VO<br>
<br>
I start with Dan Aykroyd then I take the first image, Internet Explorer.<br>
<br>
Those are the letters AIE which is the cycle lbU-&gt;ufR-&gt;ulF : <br>
1) To solve I use the commutator: [f&#x27; U&#x27; f, u&#x27;]<br>
<br>
I am here using the same notation I learned from Stefan and Per.  [f&#x27;<br>
u&#x27; f, u&#x27;] means to perform the first part, then the second part, then<br>
the inverse of the first part, then the inverse of the second part.<br>
<br>
So [f&#x27; u&#x27; f, u&#x27;] = (f&#x27; u&#x27; f) (u&#x27;) (f&#x27; u f) (u) = f&#x27; u&#x27; f u&#x27; f&#x27; u f u<br>
<br>
2) After Internet Explorer comes VO.  So the cycle is now A-&gt;VO or<br>
lbU-&gt;rbD-&gt;drB.<br>
lbU-&gt;rbD-&gt;drB : D&#x27; r&#x27; [U&#x27;, b d b&#x27;] r D<br>
<br>
3) Aykroyd-&gt;Web or A-&gt;WB or lbU-&gt;lfD-&gt;rbU : [b&#x27; R&#x27; b, l2]<br>
4) Aykroyd-&gt;Quaich or A-&gt;QC or lbU-&gt;ubL : [U, l u&#x27; l&#x27;]<br>
5) Aykroyd-&gt;San Francisco or A-&gt;SF or lbU-&gt;dbL-&gt;urF : L2 [f U2 f&#x27;, u] L2<br>
6) Aykroyd-&gt;Billy the Kid or A-&gt;KD or lbU-&gt;dfR-&gt;rfU : [U2, b d2 b&#x27;]<br>
7) Aykroyd-&gt;Satan or A-&gt;HL or lbU-&gt;drF-&gt;bdR : [r U2 r&#x27;, d&#x27;]<br>
8) Aykroyd-&gt;Gambit or A-&gt;XG or lbU-&gt;rfD-&gt;dlF : r2 [b d&#x27; b&#x27;, U&#x27;] r2<br>
<br>
Centers are now solved.  Notice that only three of the three cycles<br>
required setup moves.  One of the three cycles required two.  Average<br>
number of setup moves needed before being able to perform a commutator<br>
was 4/7 or 0.57 moves.<br>
<br>
Ok now I realize that I have run into the blast door.  So I know that<br>
the next stuff I recall deals with edges.<br>
<br>
Edges:<br>
------<br>
<br>
The first location has me recalling Queen, then the very next image is<br>
a Ferris Wheel.<br>
<br>
1) Queen-&gt;Ferris Wheel or Q-&gt;FE or lBU-&gt;fUR-&gt;fUL : [R B&#x27; R&#x27;, f]<br>
2) Queen-&gt;Star Destroyer or Q-&gt;SD or lBU-&gt;lDB-&gt;uFR : R [U&#x27;, B d B&#x27;] R&#x27;<br>
3) Queen-&gt;Satan or Q-&gt;HL or lBU-&gt;fDR-&gt;rDB : [B2, U&#x27; f2 U]<br>
4) Queen-&gt;Marvin the Paranoid Android or Q-&gt;MR or lBU-&gt;bUR-&gt;lUF : F&#x27;<br>
[B d&#x27; B&#x27;, U&#x27;] F<br>
5) Queen-&gt;Unicorn or Q-&gt;UC or lBU-&gt;dBL-&gt;uFL : [L2, F&#x27; l2 F]<br>
6) Queen-&gt;BackPack or Q-&gt;BP or lBU-&gt;uBR-&gt;bDL : [U b2 U&#x27;, B]<br>
7) Queen-&gt;Jubilee or Q-&gt;XJ or lBU-&gt;dFR-&gt;rUB : l [B&#x27; d B, U2] l&#x27;<br>
8) Queen-&gt;Tank or Q-&gt;TA or lBU-&gt;lDF-&gt;uBL : F2 [U2, F&#x27; u&#x27; F] F2<br>
performed as F2 U2 F&#x27; u&#x27; F U2 F&#x27; u F&#x27;<br>
9) Queen&lt;-&gt;Osbourne and Y-Wing OR (Q &lt;-&gt; O) and (I &lt;-&gt; W) or (lBU &lt;-&gt;<br>
bDR) and (rUF &lt;-&gt; dFL)<br>
 Done as two three cycles<br>
 9a) [r&#x27; D&#x27; r, U2]<br>
 9b) [U2, B d&#x27; B&#x27;]<br>
10) Chuck Norris -&gt; Gavel or N-&gt;GV or bUL-&gt;fDL-&gt;dBR : [b&#x27; R&#x27; b, L2]<br>
11) Chuck Norris -&gt; Chris Katan or (N &lt;-&gt; K) This is edge parity.  To<br>
solve I did:<br>
 f&#x27; D&#x27; f y&#x27; r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2 y f&#x27; D f<br>
<br>
The cube is now solved.<br>
<br>
The three cycles averaged at 4 setup moves in 11 cycles or 0.36 setup<br>
moves per three cycle.  Parity used 3 setup moves, which is probably<br>
average.  A lot of cases require 4 setup moves if you want to preserve<br>
centers.  If you don&#x27;t mind not preserving centers you might average<br>
2.5 setup moves for parity.<br>
<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.  I tried to include absolutely everything, and<br>
looking back over it that is how a BLD solve feels to me.<br>
<br>
I double checked this message about three times, and the solve and<br>
scramble work.  If you work through the solve and it doesn&#x27;t work try<br>
again, because I double checked and there are no typos in the scramble<br>
alg or in the stuff about solving.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Excellent example.  I didn&#x27;t do the scramble, but I read it all the 
way through.  I must go and practice now.  It&#x27;s been a while since 
I&#x27;ve tried memorizing the 4x4 or 5x5.  I&#x27;m finally &quot;trying&quot; to learn 
OLL and the G Perms.  Once again, though, Blindfolded cubing is 
taking precedence.

I agree, why solve the corners first?  However, I&#x27;m not confident in 
my big cube blindfolded abilities yet.  So I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;ve 
chosen this way.  Perhaps it just feels better.  Just as different 
memorization methods feel better.

I did just realize that he&#x27;s posted before about blindfold solving a 
cube and he messed up the Corner Permutation, when the rest of the 
cube was perfect.  So perhaps he&#x27;d rather use short term memo for 
his corners in BLD.

          <div class="email-content">Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
After some 3x3, I&#x27;ve started the 4x4 bld a few months ago, to see if I<br>
will be able to solve it without a particular training (for memory<br>
especially). Then after a few DNFs, I solved my first one with a time<br>
of 36min, then my second one in 24min. I was of course very happy, but<br>
also surprised that i was able to memorise the whole cube quite easily<br>
in less than 10 min with the same kind of memorisation as for the 3x3,<br>
that is to say a stupid visual memorisation of the cycles and of the<br>
orientation of the corners.<br>
<br>
I am certain that the memorisation techniques that chris and the<br>
others are using is very efficient, but I&#x27;m wondering if I can keep my<br>
own way of memorising the cube and still solving it very fast. What do<br>
you think ?<br>
<br>
So I will start practicing seriously for now, and we will see if I&#x27;m<br>
right to continue in that way :) .<br>

          <div class="email-content">I took the time yesterday to make several blindfolded attempts on 
the 4x4 cage.  I believe I made three.  I sat down to memorize one 
and I was distracted by a mediocre chore, so I stopped.  My Second 
attempt,  I spent about 13 minutes memorizing the cage and I go for 
the solve.  I had the scramble perfectly memorized.  I start corner 
permutation first, and I messed up the exectution of my first corner 
alg.  I was doing the left handed Y perm.  And everything just felt 
wrong!  I stopped then and there ); ...  My third attempt I did at 
my grandmother&#x27;s just before work.  Memo 16 minutes; Execution 13 
minutes.  I recalled everything perfectly.  There was no 3x3 or 4x4 
parity.  However, I messed up a setup.  Once again it felt wrong.  I 
tried to fix it.  The error occurred in the last 6 edges.  It was so 
close!  I have a long way to go.  There was one cubie I was lost on 
during the final execution.  I recalled the chess game.  I recalled 
the accelerated math class lesson.  After permuting 15 cubies I 
start a new cycle.  I started at lUB.  

So I recalled:

ohh, &quot;Dragoon becomes King.&quot;  &quot;Lamba, Ace, Galanoth, Mu&quot;  Solved  
The rUF was permuted by default, that&#x27;s my 4x4 reference point.  The 
lUF was solved too.  Resulting in 21 permutations + 1 new cycle = no 
parity.  I was glad that I was able to recall the King image.

That cycle equals:  
Skip to lUB; fUL->rDB->lDB->rUB->bUL->lUB;

Haha, I just realized another life adventure.  I can cause my images 
to have accidents that my families experienced.  Such as my 3yr old 
sister cutting all of her hair off, or my getting ran off the road 
last week.  A brother getting injured on 4th of july.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Daniel, Clément,

When I keep posting about big cubes BLD I&#x27;m not trying to imply that
my memorization method is the best, just that of all the things I&#x27;ve
tried, for me, I like this method the most.

I think it would be better for everyone to discover which method they
like the most, but I would recommend trying different things to get a
broad perspective.

Clément as for memorizing without a technique, I think the limits of
this for 4x4x4 BLD are sub-10 minutes.  My record solve using a story
method chain-link image method for centers and completely visual
memorization for the edges and corners was very low 12 minutes.  I
knew then with more practice I could have gotten low 10 minutes, and
looking back on it now I know I could have gotten sub-10 with enough
practice.  So Clément to answer your question the limits of 4x4x4 BLD
without a trained memory technique I know will be sub-10, but I don&#x27;t
know how much more beyond that (sub-9, sub-8) etc.  But I can say with
confidence that with enough practice sub-10 would be possible with
completely visual memory techniques.

I would try to use this method in a competition though and see what
you think.  Personally I did use this method at the Chattahoochee
Spring competition and found it very difficult to forget the
information from previous solves while memorizing the current cube. 
However I have this problem on the 3x3x3 as well.  So if you don&#x27;t
really have a problem with this on the 3x3x3, then I think it would be
easier for you to overcome on the 4x4x4 than it was for me.

Daniel, 

It definitely looks like you have good ideas for how to improve your
memory technique, I&#x27;d say to just keep doing whatever you&#x27;re doing,
since it is working!

Seriously though keep up the practice, that&#x27;s about all it takes to
bring your accuracy up.  You just need to get your brain used to
memorizing more and holding onto more info, but eventually a 4x4x4 BLD
solve will feel like a 3x3x3 BLD solve, it will just take longer to do
is all.

As for the little tricks you&#x27;re doing to remember the ends of cycles,
and grouping by 6 so you don&#x27;t have to count, definitely keep looking
for stuff like that, and personalize it so it has more meaning for you.

The only thing I do want to say is don&#x27;t let DNF&#x27;s bother you.  For
the 3x3x3 you can view a DNF as a failure and it be ok and just move
on and try another solve.  But since so much work goes into a big cube
BLD solve to view a DNF as a failure is extremely frustrating.  I
would suggest to have a more graduated scale.

1) Solved.  Yay!

2) DNF but veeeeeeeeeeeeery close, off by two pieces or so (usually
means you forgot one piece during recall)

3) DNF but fairly close, maybe 8 pieces off (usually means you missed
one setup turn in the middle or near the very end of the solve)

4) DNF but messed up pieces are all of one type.  Messed up pieces are
all edges, or centers say.  This usually means you made a memorization
error or maybe even cycled the wrong pieces a few times for that type
of piece.  However you still solved the rest correctly, so be happy
for that, this wasn&#x27;t a big mistake.

5) DNF but one type of piece is completely solved.  A lot went wrong
here, but most likely it was due to memorization or recall errors,
since one type of piece is completely solved.

6) Complete and total utter chaos DNF.  When you first start on the
big cubes this usually means a lot went wrong.  Once you are more
comfortable though this almost always means you messed up a setup turn
or something on your very first step of the solve, which would throw
all of your cycles completely out of whack and make the end result
look completely scrambled, even if you did still recall and solve the
memorized cube correctly.

So either way DNFs can be boiled down to a certain number of mistakes.
 Try to think of how many mistakes went into your DNF, and at which
steps they are.  This will help you keep your sanity, because DNFs
really do come up much more frequently on the bigger cubes, even if
you&#x27;re certain you did the solve correctly (everything felt perfect),
you can still get DNFs from not even realizing you forgot one piece in
your cycle, stuff like that.

So don&#x27;t worry about DNFs, just expect them to happen more often and
you&#x27;ll keep your sanity lol.

Happy big cube BLD&#x27;ing!  Just remember, DNFs suck that much more on
the bigger cubes, but successful solves feel that same amount better
than a successful on 3x3x3 :-)

Hey Marcus,

I&#x27;ve just found that I really like solving them first so during
memorization I can just barely memorize them, just long enough to put
on the blindfolded and solve them.

There is one major downside though, if I get corner parity, I have to
wait until after I solve the centers before I can fix it since an odd
permutation on the corners must also perform an odd permutation on the
centers (supercube-wise).

I&#x27;ve found though that if I use auditory memory to help me remember I
have parity in the corners it helps a lot.  Once I know I have corner
parity I literally say out loud &quot;corner parity&quot; and I have found that
it usually sticks in my mind long enough for me to finish centers, and
still remember that on this solve (not the one before) I have corner
parity, since it&#x27;s still ringing in my head so to speak.

It&#x27;s just a personal preference, I know solving them last would be
fast too, since I wouldn&#x27;t even have this corner parity problem, but I
prefer to do it this way after trying both.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I mentioned in this thread http://tinyurl.com/sgru3 about how to skip<br>
a forgotten cycle and come back for the cycle method, and I finally<br>
had my first successful solve on 4x4x4 BLD doing this!<br>
<br>
The overall solve time was 8:55.68 which is awesome considering I<br>
forgot an image for over a minute and still finished sub-9!  To be<br>
clear I wasn&#x27;t sitting there doing nothing for over a minute trying to<br>
remember that image, I skipped it and kept solving with the intent to<br>
fix it later.<br>
<br>
Here was my edge cycle:<br>
(QJHFBAWTMDURXCKNOSPEI)(VG)(L)<br>
<br>
The image I forgot was DU or the Duke mascott.  So in my head during<br>
the solving phase I had this memorized:<br>
<br>
(QJHFBAWTM??RXCKNOSPEI)(VG)<br>
<br>
Now it seems like I could just figure out that I was missing pieces<br>
&quot;D&quot; and &quot;U&quot; since I had remembered that &quot;L&quot; was the solved piece and<br>
every other piece was unsolved.  However this is much harder to do<br>
than it would seem, I have to go letter by letter and search my<br>
journey to see if each image contains the current letter I am looking for.<br>
<br>
What I did was to use the pickup cycle method I talked about in that<br>
earlier thread.  After doing the cycle (QTM) I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to<br>
remember that forgotten image any time soon so I immediately skipped<br>
to the cycle (QRX).<br>
<br>
This changed my edge cycles to:<br>
<br>
(R??)(QCKNOSPEI)(VG) and the (R??) cycle would become (RDU) assuming I<br>
could remember the forgotten image.<br>
<br>
This way I could continue solving the cube while trying to remember<br>
the image I forgot.  When I was actually performing each three cycle I<br>
would think about which letters I had used, and also I tried picturing<br>
the scene at that journey location to see if I could recall what was<br>
there.  Right as I finished performing the cycle (VG) which was the<br>
parity alg, I sort of saw in my mind&#x27;s eye the D piece and remembered<br>
I hadn&#x27;t used it, then I remembered the U piece and put them together<br>
to get my DU image, and I finished the cube with the cycle (RDU) and<br>
the cube was solved when I took off the blindfold!<br>
<br>
I just wanted to post because until today this idea was only theory<br>
for me, and I had never actually successfully used it on a solve where<br>
I forgot an image.  I&#x27;m happy that I was able to actually pull it off<br>
on a solve!<br>
<br>
Pickup cycles are the way to go, because instead of sitting there<br>
doing nothing until I remember the image, like I used to do, I now<br>
continue the solve and try to remember the image while doing something<br>
mindless like actually performing the cycle algs where I don&#x27;t need to<br>
picture the cube or anything for a couple seconds.<br>
<br>
This rocks!  I&#x27;m totally a fan of these pick-up cycles!  And the best<br>
part is that they actually work during a solve!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Congratulations,
Chris, I will have to think about this concept a little more and 
perhaps write on it.  

Write on what if your forget a cubie in the cycle, or what if you 
mix up cubies in a cycle.

Such as you skip D in the cycle ABCDEF
Or you shoot B-D and continue correctly such that the new cycle 
would be ADCBEF.

There are a lot of tricks that need to be thought of and perhaps 
published somewhere as to how to recover from an error in recall.

Later,
Daniel Beyer

In computing, if data is wrong, it is spotted by a procedure named &#x27;parity check&#x27; - one style contains enough data to allow an attempt at correcting the bad sequence of 1s and 0s.<br>
<br>
Maybe with every 4 letters of the alphabet, you could sum them (A = 1, B = 2 sort of thing) and memorise their total or memorise the units digit of their sum.<br>
It would be another time-consuming memory step but it might have value for quickly deducing the missing letter.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just an idea.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,

I will try a solve today and post about solving the corners last to 
see what happens, but I have to ask what do you mean about shorter 
algorithms?

The algorithms I use for corners are just commutators.  The most 
common ones are ones like these:

[B2, R F R&#x27;]

[B2, R&#x27; F&#x27; R]

(R&#x27; F R F&#x27;)x3 D2 (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;)x3 D2 (not strictly a commutator, but 
then again (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;)x3 is it&#x27;s own inverse anyway)

To orient I always use either two sunes or a double sune, or an alg 
that flips three corners.

To orient 2 corners I use either of:
1) L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U R
2) L U L&#x27; U L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R

To orient 4 corners I use either of:
1) L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U R L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27;
2) L U L&#x27; U L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R L U L&#x27; U L U2 L&#x27;

Flip three corners:

algs like U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; L U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; L U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R 
U R&#x27; L2

I&#x27;ll try a corners last solve, but I personally like solving them 
first because I don&#x27;t have to memorize them well (I only use visual 
memory for them, I don&#x27;t have any sort of system at all).

Though I suppose if I memorize them first, this would let me 
memorize the centers and edges much more quickly since I will solve 
them sooner than I currently do.

I guess it&#x27;s a matter of preference really, but I will try it again 
and see what I think.  I&#x27;ll try to post the results on the group 
here.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,

I just did a 4x4 solve memorized and solved in this order

Memorization:
1) corner permutation
2) corner orientation
3) center permutation
4) edges permutation

Solving:
1) center permutation
2) edge permutation
3) corner orientation
4) corner permutation

The memorization time was around 5:15 and the total overall time was
9:33.04, the solve was successful.

To be honest I didn&#x27;t really like doing it this way.  I mean I know
it&#x27;s just a personal preference, but I don&#x27;t like having to hold onto
the corner information for so long.  I also noticed during the
memorization step that I rehearsed the corner information.  I don&#x27;t
like that because any rehearsal during memorization is wasted time,
since you&#x27;re going over old stuff and not memorizing new stuff.  I
know with practice I could probably do away with this by just
memorizing corners better the first time around.  Still I don&#x27;t like
the potential to even be able to rehearse corner information.

I also didn&#x27;t really solve the corners at the end any differently from
the way I normally do when I solve them first, so I didn&#x27;t really gain
any time by saving them for the end.

I can see how doing this way can be fast, but personally I don&#x27;t like
it.  I very much prefer to memorize the corners last and solve them
first since it is such an easy step.

That&#x27;s just my preference though, I think solving the corners last can
also be fast because you don&#x27;t have to remember corner parity during
the center permutation like I do.  Still, I think personally I can
memorize faster if I memorize the corners last and solve them first,
but that&#x27;s just based on the way I memorize.

I did honestly give it a try, but I really don&#x27;t like solving corners
last, and I will definitely stick with memorizing them last and
solving them first.  That&#x27;s just my opinion though, I know both ways
can be fast with practice, I just really prefer to solve the corners
first.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I was just wondering if there would be any major difference, but
of course it would be difficult to get an accurate picture if one is
already accustomed to a certain method.  I am trying to figure out a
better way to memorize bigger cubes (I did a few trial runs lately and
the times really slip when the memory hooks weaken).  Ideally, the
best memory system would be one where it shouldn&#x27;t matter what order
things are memorized in -- all information is just as strong
regardless of how long ago you took it in.  Like if I told you to
remember &quot;Death Orange,&quot; it probably wouldn&#x27;t be any harder for you to
memorize &quot;Orange Death.&quot;  

One way I&#x27;m trying to strengthen memory is to force myself to make the
order &quot;inconvenient.&quot;  If I memorize corners first, for instance, and
solve them last, it forces me to keep the corners in memory longer
than I would if I memorized them last and solved them first, and so
eventually when you actually memorize corners last and solve them
first for efficiency, it&#x27;s actually easier to recall the other
information.  However, this is assuming one&#x27;s able to break away from
their routine solving method, which is why I am wondering if I am
wasting time with this approach.  Maybe it is foolish but I found that
it forced me to use a system that was profound enough to stick... but
unfortunately reality has shown that even taking a break from using a
&quot;sticking memory system&quot; can weaken its strengths.

          <div class="email-content">I would like to propose a new type of average for BLD that will apply<br>
to the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes.<br>
<br>
Accuracy is a much bigger issue for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 BLD, and so is the<br>
time needed for even one solve.  Here is my idea to propose an average<br>
that will let you measure your skill level for the bigger cubes.<br>
<br>
Big Cube BLD average Rules:<br>
---------------------------<br>
1) 12 consecutive successful solves must be taken in order to take an<br>
average.  There may be any number of DNFs between successful solves,<br>
as long as 12 consecutive successful solves are taken.  Solves must<br>
not all be done on the same day.<br>
<br>
2) The fastest and slowest times are dropped and the middle ten are<br>
averaged.  DNF&#x27;s do not affect the average except as described below.<br>
<br>
3) The accuracy rate is also calculated by dividing the number of<br>
successful solves (always 12) by the total number of attempts taken. <br>
This value is just used for a comparison and does not affect the<br>
average.  This is sort of like comparing Standard Deviation values for<br>
3x3x3 averages.<br>
<br>
4) Rolling averages are allowed.<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Here is my first ever 4x4x4 BLD average:<br>
<br>
1) 9:29.54<br>
2) 8:41.85<br>
3) 8:57.64<br>
4) 10:03.33<br>
-) DNF<br>
5) (7:16.30)<br>
-)DNF<br>
6) 7:47.35<br>
7) 7:26.10<br>
8) (10:45.33)<br>
9) 8:52.27<br>
10) 8:55.68<br>
11) 7:34.19<br>
-) DNF<br>
12) 7:38.48<br>
<br>
I throw out times #5 and #8 and average the rest to get an average of<br>
8:32.64 minutes.<br>
<br>
My accuracy rate is 12/15 = 80%<br>
<br>
This average is a bit sketchy though, since I didn&#x27;t count my 9:33.04<br>
solve where I tried solving corners last, I only wanted to count times<br>
with my usual method, even though the rules say to only take<br>
consecutive successful solves.<br>
<br>
I still want to stick to the rules of this new type of average, so in<br>
the future I&#x27;ll not do things like that, but I just wanted to get an<br>
example out there of an average using my usual method.<br>
<br>
I really want to get my average sub-8 before RWC2007, but in the<br>
process of doing that I realized that there isn&#x27;t really a standard<br>
for an average for 4x4x4 BLD, or 5x5x5 BLD for that matter, so I<br>
propose this one.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Everybody,<br>
I&#x27;ve been analyzing solving the centers with commutators.  There are <br>
many ways to solve the same cycle.  There are a dozen ways to setup <br>
a commutator.  Six for each direction of the Cycle.  I&#x27;ve written a <br>
guide on it.  Upon Chris&#x27; approval it&#x27;ll be available to the <br>
public.  Possibly posted on his website.<br>
<br>
The goal of the the guide is to help you optimize setups for the <br>
commutators, and to use the proper commuator.  Because the first <br>
part is rather intuitive, and basically explained by Chris&#x27;s <br>
Commutator guide --<br>
http://tinyurl.com/pft5d<br>
I didn&#x27;t give actual examples, moreso theory.  However, as I said <br>
there are 12 possiblilities for the commutator that involves the <br>
three required pieces, and only half of them will cycle in the <br>
correct direction.  My guide helps you identify which commutator you <br>
use with the setup you&#x27;ve chosen.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I agree I was rather disappointed to have only two attempts at Rutgers after having 5 at G.wiz ...  I believe the plan was to have three attempts, as there was in the final round for 3x3 blindfolded at G.wiz.  There was no qualifying round.

   <br>
  Being pressed for time is truly an inconvience.  However, if events were promptly began, there would be less chance that you&#x27;ll be pressed for time.  You can&#x27;t hope to schedule an average of 5 for blindfolded cubing, when you can&#x27;t schedule an average of three!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan, Daniel,

Yeah I agree this average idea for the bigger cubes would not be a
good fit for official competitions, there is barely enough time for
even a best of 2 format.

I think the average of 5 for 3x3x3 BLD would be a good idea in terms
of how well it would measure the skill level of each competitor, but I
think it might be impractical.  I remember Clancy posting about how
3x3x3 BLD lately has been taking precedence over 5x5x5 speedcubing as
one particular example.

I think if we stop having rennaisance cubers, those who do all events,
then things like an average of 5 for 3x3x3 BLD would be possible.  I
know I always try to compete in as many events as possible, but to be
honest I would also love on occasion to be able to give up other
events for a chance at 3 solves per cube in big cube BLD.  I think
this would be unfair though, because what if someone wanted to do big
cube BLD and other events, would they get 2 solves or 3?  Already this
idea isn&#x27;t sounding like a good one haha.

I also think, logistically, doing this would be a nightmare so it
might be better if that idea never happens.   Nevertheless I do agree
that average of 5 for 3x3x3 BLD would be better if it were possible. 
Also an average of 10 (12 solves, minus fastest and slowest) would be
awesome for the final round 3x3x3 events, but I also doubt that will
happen due to it probably also being a logistical nightmare to
actually have at a competition and still run other events as well.

All in all I am happy with two solves for big cube BLD, and I do think
having a prelim and final for 3x3x3 BLD is nice whenever possible. 
What about averaging the two solves in the prelim and the 3 solves,
assuming you qualify, in the final as an average of 5?  That way you
get an accuracte measure of each person&#x27;s skill level.  The only
downside is that if you DNF once in the prelim and once in the final
you have no average time to record, so that&#x27;s bad.

haha so many ideas that won&#x27;t work, alright I&#x27;ll stop here before I
keep going on ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Two attempts is enough for big cube bld.  Even at world record breaking pace, the events are very long.  I would really like to see a consistency in events with the proposed schedule.  I&#x27;d just compete in 3x3 and blindfolded cubing, just because I know that I am out of practice in the other events.  There is no point in wasting your time, or the other competitors time.  Like at Rutgers, people were solving sub 3m solves, and I was in the 5m range.
  Of course, you should compete for the fun of it, not to win.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind coming in last, as long as I had fun and saw personal improvement.  I&#x27;ve always been told that in a competition like this, it&#x27;s not a race against the person beside you.  It&#x27;s against the clock and yourself.  Beat yourself, make your old self look bad, set yourself above what you once were and always try to improve.  When you&#x27;re the best in there world there&#x27;s still competition, look in the mirror.  Now I just overembellished, but you get the point.
   
  Off Topic:
  I can&#x27;t wait to fix my Rubik&#x27;s Professor.  It&#x27;s superior to the crap eastsheens I&#x27;ve guzzled money into, and it&#x27;ll be awsome for both speed and blindfolded cubing.  I&#x27;ve played with Hardwick&#x27;s and Frank Morris&#x27; cubes, actually the cube Hardwick set his WR blindfold solve on.  Frank&#x27;s was insanely awsome.  Hardwick&#x27;s off colors and slight stiffness left a little to be desired, I&#x27;m quite happy to see just how my cube feels in comparison with top notch cubers.  I feel that the 5x5x5 will be awsome for both events if once I start to practice again.
   
  Hardwick:
  Check the guide.  Let me know what you think, I&#x27;ve hosted it on the web now.  Just let me know if you approve.  By the way, it does work, it&#x27;s helped me visualize commutators so much better.  Especially once I gave the bracket notation, almost like with sets.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
After about 6 DNFs that were sub-7 (one off by only two centers -<br>
arrrrrrgh!) I finally legitimately got sub-7 on a successful solve.<br>
<br>
The overall time was 6:54.97 with about 3:35 of memorization.<br>
<br>
My best DNF so far was a 6:19 DNF which was the one with only two<br>
centers swapped, so now my goal is to get sub-6.  I know this will be<br>
possible, the breakdown will be something like 3:05 memorization and<br>
2:50 solving.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been working a lot lately on memorizing, and also on just<br>
twisting very, very quickly during the solve.  I soon want to try to<br>
apply what I&#x27;ve learned to the 5x5x5, but for now I&#x27;m still focusing<br>
on 4x4x4 BLD.<br>
<br>
Just had to say something, getting sub-7 has been a goal for me for a<br>
while, so I&#x27;m glad to finally have made it!<br>

I was trying to memorize quickly, but also so that I could still be<br>

really as breakneck of a speed as I go on 4x4x4.<br>

I think the combination of pretty fast memorization and no delay<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I just now got a successful sub-18 5x5x5 BLD solve :-D<br>
<br>
17:16.91 was the overall time.  I memorized for 9:21 and the solving<br>
then took roughly 7:55, which is both my personal fastest memorization<br>
and solving phase, on the same solve no less!<br>
<br>
I know sub-17 will be possible, and it is my current short term goal.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m finding that there is a big difference between 4x4x4 and 5x5x5<br>
BLD.  To get fast times on 4x4x4 BLD you have to go EXTREMELY fast on<br>
both memorization and solving.  Probably I&#x27;d say 90-95% of maximum<br>
speed on memorizing and 105% maximum speed during solving - seriously<br>
as fast as humanly possible during the solving phase.<br>
<br>
The 5x5x5 seems to be very different though.  To get fast times I find<br>
it is much easier to memorize slow-fast, maybe 75% of maximum speed,<br>
and to solve at maybe 75% speed but to try for no delays.<br>
<br>
Solving the 5x5x5 much slower than full speed, but in doing so<br>
avoiding recall delays, seems to be much better than going full speed<br>
since there is so much more to do during the solving phase as compared<br>
to the 4x4x4.  The 4x4x4 is really not that much to memorize once you<br>
get used to it, so it seems to be better to just go as FAST as<br>
possible during the solving phase, regardless of whether or not you<br>
get some recall delays.<br>
<br>
I have decided that this image and journey memorization method is the<br>
one for me.  I know that agrupation methods, or Person-Action-Object<br>
methods, might be faster than this image system, but I really think<br>
that for me the image system is much better, it just makes sense to<br>
me.  Also I know agrupation and PAO might be faster, but I think this<br>
image method might be just a little more accurate in general.  That is<br>
just my personal opinion, since I have less experience using PAO, but<br>
so far I think it might tend to be true.<br>
<br>
Also if Ben Pridmore can memorize a deck of cards in close to 30<br>
seconds with this 2 objects per image method, I think it is a good<br>
choice of method for the bigger cubes BLD as well, since both are just<br>
memorizing a permutation.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m also finding the more I practice that knowing your images really<br>
really well isn&#x27;t the only important thing.  When I use journeys that<br>
have more meaning for me I tend to get faster times as well.  The two<br>
most meaningful journeys to me are also the ones where I tend to get<br>
the fastest times, so I&#x27;ve been working on really knowing all my<br>
journeys very well as well as my images.  Another thing I do now is to<br>
cycle through my journeys for each solve.  This way after I fill up<br>
all locations in my first journey, I will use all my other journeys<br>
before I again use the 1st journey.  This means that each journey can<br>
get close to a week of rest time before I use it again, which means I<br>
won&#x27;t have any interference from the last time I used it.<br>
<br>
Awesome, big cube BLD is so much fun!  I can&#x27;t wait to get a sub-17<br>
5x5x5 solve, and I&#x27;m also trying for a sub-6 4x4x4 solve as well, but<br>
that one will take more practice than sub-17 for 5x5x5 for me I know.<br>
<br>
Happy BLD&#x27;ing everyone!<br>

&gt; My main problem is the execution for the 5x5x5 and 4x4x4 cubes.  <br>

there<br>
&gt; are so many clicks and lockups and centers moving astray when I <br>

<br>
Hey Marcus,<br>
<br>
I just did some move counts for the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 to answer your <br>
question:<br>
<br>
4x4x4<br>
-----<br>
<br>
CO: 43 moves<br>
CP: 17 moves (not including parity)<br>
CP: 77 moves<br>
fix corner parity: 21 moves<br>
EP: 92 moves<br>
fix edge parity: 21 moves<br>
Total: 271 moves<br>
<br>
On a good solve lately I&#x27;ll solve in around 3:30 so that&#x27;s 271 moves <br>
in 210 seconds or 1.29 moves per second sustained.<br>
<br>
5x5x5<br>
-----<br>
<br>
EO: 54 moves<br>
CO: 39 moves<br>
CP: 29 moves<br>
EP: 47 moves<br>
Xcenters: 72 moves<br>
+centers: 67 moves<br>
fix center blocks I setup during Xcenters: 21 moves<br>
fix corner and central edge parity: 21 moves<br>
wing-edges (including edge-parity): 102 moves<br>
<br>
Total: 452 moves<br>
<br>
On a good solve I&#x27;ll solve in around 8:30 minutes.  So that&#x27;s 452 <br>
moves in 510 seconds, or 0.87 moves/second sustained.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Marcus what are the breakdowns of your solves?  For a 20 minute <br>
solve I would usually have memorized in 11 minutes and solved in <br>
about 9 minutes.  I&#x27;ve gotten about 4-5 sub-20 solves recently <br>
(including very, very close DNFs) and those are usually 9:30-10:30 <br>
minutes memorizing and 8:30-9:30 solving.<br>
<br>
I remember you saying you memorized the 5x5x5 in under 10 minutes <br>
very often and sometimes under 7 minutes.  What is your record time <br>
for 5x5x5 BLD?  I imagine memorizing in sub-7 minutes would lead to <br>
at worst a 17-18 minute overall time even if it took you 10 minutes <br>
or more to solve.  It seems more likely that to memorize in sub-7 <br>
you could solve in sub-9 and get a sub-16 overall solve fairly <br>
easily.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d say that right now my average breakdown is about 10:30 minutes <br>
memorizing and 9:30 solving.  In the past 2-3 days though I&#x27;ve <br>
memorized in 9:30-10:00 a few times, and solved in about 8:30-<br>
10:00.  That one solve where I memorized in 9:21 and solved in 7:55 <br>
is by far my best ever peformance for both memorizing and solving.<br>
<br>
I also twist Xcenters out of place very frequently on the 5x5x5, and <br>
I lockup the layers very often as well.  I think this is evident <br>
from the fact that my turning ratio is almost half again as fast on <br>
the 4x4x4 as on the 5x5x5.  I can&#x27;t wait to try a BLD solve on the <br>
olympicube 5x5x5, I think it would be possible to actually solve <br>
much more quickly on that cube.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I need to rebuild some memory systems for the larger cubes as I&#x27;ve
slowed down without much practice at all, but I think my record time
for blindfoldsolving the 5x5x5 cube was around 15 minutes including
memorization and execution with a 5 minute memorization and 10 minute
execution.  That was by far the best solve and it wasn&#x27;t very typical
-- normally it took a few more minutes to memorize (I&#x27;m getting sick
of PAO to be honest... I am strongly considering your image approach
the more I read about it), and like 15 minutes to solve.  On average,
total times were around the low-20&#x27;s.  The memory was always really
quick, but the execution sucks.

The XCenters absolutely blow chunks -- they constantly pop out of
place when you try to go quickly.  I would really like to use a larger
cube that doesn&#x27;t... well, suck.  Otherwise I find myself making like
less than a move per second (if not slower) and it just feels like
it&#x27;d be so much better to go quickly, because sometimes when I&#x27;m
taking a while to make executions, my mind wanders and I mess things
up.  It is easier to go with the flow of things so your execution
keeps up with the mind and the moves coincide more with what your
muscle memory&#x27;s used to.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Marcus,<br>
<br>
Well you&#x27;ve inspired me.  I just tried a 5x5x5 solve and I tried to go<br>
literally as fast as possible for memo and I memorized in 7:43, which<br>
is by far the fastest I ever have done memo.  I messed up during<br>
execution of Xcenters because I twisted an Xcenter so that the cap<br>
came off.  I continued the solve anyway, but I got lost trying to pick<br>
back up where I was in the middle of the commutator when the center<br>
twisted cap twisted off.<br>
<br>
I remembered everything about the solve, but I did have to use a<br>
pickup cycle during Xcenters.  I forgot one journey location, so in<br>
the mean time I continued on to the next location and picked up the<br>
location once I remembered it.<br>
<br>
The solve is off by a number of Xcenters, and a couple wing edges, but<br>
otherwise solved.<br>
<br>
Still this has inspired me to not go at 75% pace for the memorization<br>
of the 5x5x5, but rather to do like the 4x4x4 and just go full speed.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m going to keep giving this a shot and see how it goes.  To get<br>
right at a 15 minute solve I imagine I&#x27;d solve in 7:50 and memo in<br>
7:10.  Solving in 7:50 doesn&#x27;t seem bad, but memo in 7:10 seems crazy.<br>
 I&#x27;ll keep at it though and see what happens.<br>
<br>
There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d try to go this fast in a competition, but it is fun<br>
to test my limits at home without having to worry about going home<br>
with 2 DNFs.  I think it would be cool to one day be able to memorize<br>
this fast in competition though.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey again Marcus,<br>
<br>
Ok I tried one more time, since I was mad at myself for breaking that<br>
X-center last time after having memorized so quickly.<br>
<br>
I broke my record for 5x5x5 single solve on this next try :-D<br>
<br>
The overall time was 15:49.63 minutes.  Memorization took 7:36 and the<br>
solving then took 8:13 minutes.  I memorized literally full speed, and<br>
I didn&#x27;t rehearse a single image or journey location at any point.  I<br>
just memorized once and moved on for everything.<br>
<br>
And no I am not joking, the solve was successful.  I&#x27;ll be perfectly<br>
honest I find it incredibly frustrating that you say you don&#x27;t<br>
practice much and yet you get such incredibly fast times.  I practice<br>
literally every day and don&#x27;t get those times.  It definitely sounds<br>
like your speed comes from your natural memory though, and in addition<br>
to that you&#x27;ve applied a system to it to make it even better.<br>
<br>
I mean this in a friendly competitive way, but seriously being<br>
frustrated at your times is what made me able to focus so well during<br>
memorization and solving on that solve.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m gunning for your 15:00.00 ;-)<br>
<br>
Seriously though you are a motivating factor for me since your times<br>
are so crazy fast.  Watch out though - you say your memory system is<br>
slipping, but right now I&#x27;m at the top of my game ;-)  I guess we&#x27;re<br>
racing to sub-15min now.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow! Amazing... congrats man!

I&#x27;ve been rememorizing my memory maps for the past week or so... I
have em all down again but I don&#x27;t know how fast I would be right now.
 I can try a sample solve and see how it goes. You seem much faster
than me in execution -- I always fear those damn XCenters popping out.
 I&#x27;ll try a solve without regard for the XCenter slips and see what
happens.  Usually when I get a pop I spend some time trying to pop it
back in, then figure out what move I was doing. The big cubes suck :(
I&#x27;ll get back to you here.

Haha dude I can relate -- having your times be so comparable is enough
to be a motivating factor.  Having someone else to go against is fun
because any new level achieved shows what is indeed possible.  I think
the times would drop like mad if we had better cubes.

I&#x27;ll give the big ol&#x27; 5x5x5 a shot or two and let you know the
results, one sec.

          <div class="email-content">Ok I just tried a few solves at fullspeed without any regard for the
shifts in the XCenters/any pops that occurred (I&#x27;m also using a new
approach to EP and CO).  Luckily I didn&#x27;t have any pops save one solve
where an XCenter and a +Center dislodged.  Memorization for the
fastest solve was about 6:01 with an execution of 10:03, or a total
time of 16:04 or so.  That execution felt very rough but I was still
trying to go at full speed (sometimes lockups though are just so
stubborn and don&#x27;t allow for turns)... if I can get the memory around
5 minutes consistently and improve the execution, that&#x27;d be pretty
sweet.  I will spent the rest of tonight practicing, lol.

          <div class="email-content">Been doing nothing but solves for a few hours now, haha.  Achieved a
new personal best on the 5x5x5 of 14:32.  A few edges (maybe 3 or so)
and XCenters (maybe 6) were already permuted right after the scramble,
though (what is considered lucky for 5x5x5 BLD?).  Execution becomes
nicer after a while because the hands get used to turning the layers.
 Would love to get my hands on a 5x5x5 that doesn&#x27;t lock or spit
pieces out, though.  Execution times would plummet if one could apply
the same type of speed as they would to a 3x3x3 cube (obviously not to
the same extent, but at least a lot more than is currently possible
given the mechanics of what is available).  

I am torn between systems.  I don&#x27;t know whether or not to switch to
an image system.  Even now I&#x27;m still using PAO for the centers and
wings, but I&#x27;m seriously reconsidering just switching to your system.  

Chris, I have an interesting video idea I&#x27;d be willing to do if you&#x27;d
also be game: We could tape ourselves doing a sample 5x5x5 solve,
perhaps speaking aloud what we are thinking during memorization and
execution.  The idea wouldn&#x27;t be so much to get a fast time but rather
to sort of compare the inner monologues that go on.  I don&#x27;t know,
it&#x27;d be interesting to see how we differ in approaches.  I&#x27;d also love
to talk with you on Yahoo sometime about all this.

This big cube stuff is pretty awesome... you&#x27;re a great inspiration,
Chris! Let me know your thoughts -- lata

          <div class="email-content">Marcus, 
  You and I also have to talk on memo techniques.  What is this memo map you are talking about?  I must study for my two final exams which are tomorrow.  I&#x27;ve done a little practice on speedcubing, I learned full PLL yestserday,  after well years ... lol!  
  I wonder if a visual memo + long term memo combination would be fast.  I would love to do my finger taps across the centers to memorize them.  I&#x27;ve been so busy, the best I&#x27;ve done is a cage on the 4x4.  But I&#x27;ll finish the Image system over Christmas Break.  Maybe go at breakneck speed memorizing it.  I&#x27;ve learned 25% of the letter pair system in like 3 days of memorizing.
   
  I need to seriously fix my 5x5x5!  I&#x27;m missing 4 X-centers, long story.  Tried to fix one just before G.wiz, wound up breaking another and losing one completely.  And another one of the bad X-centers just broke this weekend.  I bought a new Rubik&#x27;s Revenge after seeing Craig&#x27;s, I hope that I&#x27;ll get fast times on it.  I&#x27;m not as fast in any of the events as you guys are but I&#x27;ve been practicing, and Marcus, you remembe where I was in BLD this summer, so I&#x27;ve much potential to improve.  I&#x27;ve a real desire to compete with you and Chris, which is just going to get me a lot better! 
   
  Marcus and Chris,
  Later!

What are you averaging when running through your images?  I just <br>

(285.05), 145.41, 128.41, 95.53, 94.09<br>
<br>
The first run I was very sketchy on the images, it was my first run in <br>
almost a week.  Then the others just went by faster and faster.  This <br>
was for 92 images.  I almost hit 1s/image in th end.  The perks of my <br>

Quote:  Hardick  &quot;Sub-9&quot;

&quot;I have been practicing recalling my images every day as fast as I 
can.
So far it takes me about 40 minutes to recall all 576 images, which
works out to 4 seconds per image on average, but I think I can half
that the more I practice.&quot;
End Quote

I propose that sub 2s/image is very possible.  Now this was months 
ago, 5-6 months ago now.  However, I am already getting sub 1.25 on 
20% even if I add .25s/image per 20% increment, I&#x27;ll be sub 
2.5s/image easily.  I wonder what your approach was.  What I&#x27;ve done 
is modify all words that I don&#x27;t like.  Over 50 and counting now.  
I&#x27;ll have to give you my list.  You may like some of them.  Marcus 
helped me w/ my newest one :)

As a matter of fact I&#x27;m almost sub 2 minutes on 115 images :)

Later,
Daniel Beyer

          <div class="email-content">Hey Daniel,

I ran through my stack of cards a couple of nights ago and it took me
about 20 minutes to do, which works out to 2.08 seconds per card.  I
tried it again just now a few days later and ran through my whole
stack, randomly shuffled, in 13:00.49 or 1.36 seconds per image.

Before a couple nights ago I hadn&#x27;t run through my stack in a month or
more, since I felt that all my images were solidified well enough from
solving, and just going over letter groups in my head at work and stuff.

As to your idea to modify the words you don&#x27;t like, I did the same
with Michael Curtis&#x27; list.  Many of my words are straight off his
list, but also a number I have changed to ones I like better.

Yeah man you&#x27;re learning the images really quickly!  If ever you are
memorizing and one of your new letter pair images pops into your head,
use the new image before you use old stuff.  That will help solidy
them.  I remember my GK or Green Knight image really well because it
was one of the first where the GK image of the Green Knight popped
into my head on one solve when I had G followed by K, whereas at the
time I was using a single image to single piece method and should have
used two images there.

Anyway man I know recall can be very fast.  I believe Ben Pridmore
said he could recall all of his images mentally (without a card stack)
in 15 minutes?  Please someone correct me if I misquoted that time, I
searched the memory sports group but couldn&#x27;t find that post again. 
Anyway the time I remember was close to if not very well sub-20
minutes.  Assuming a barely sub-20 time he still recalled 2.33 images
per second roughly.  No that&#x27;s not seconds per image, but images per
second.

I find that I prefer to think of two random pieces on the cube and
convert those to letters then to my image, rather than to use my card
stack all of the time.  I like to apply the image to those two pieces
on the cube.  Some image groups come up so often that I can see those
two pieces and I instantly know the image, I don&#x27;t even have to think
of which letter each piece is.

Daniel I think you probably have a much stronger natural memory than I
do.  When I first started it took me well over 40 minutes to recall
all of my images, and you&#x27;re already 1/5 the way through and recalling
at a faster pace than I do.

I&#x27;ll just have to keep working on my execution to overcome the crazy
memorization times you&#x27;ll get lol ;-)

          <div class="email-content">&gt; What is agrupation?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Stefan<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t fully understand it, but someone e-mailed me about it to give<br>
it a try.  From what I understand you have a set group of objects in a<br>
set order, 1) Chair, 2) Desk, 3) Computer, etc..<br>
<br>
Then with each object you associate some small group of<br>
things/objects/letters/numbers/etc..<br>
<br>
So to apply to the cube I would give each piece a letter.  Then with<br>
the chair I associate the letters AFKJ.  I don&#x27;t convert them to<br>
images or picture them or anything.  Just when I think of the chair I<br>
think in quick succession AFKJ.  That way when I recall and I think of<br>
the chair again those 4 letters come back.<br>
<br>
The message I received was from someone from the memory sports group.<br>
 I really don&#x27;t want to give out their e-mail address if they don&#x27;t<br>
want me to, but here was the body of the message:<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
hi Chris<br>
 <br>
&quot;the location&quot;+association is used only when you have large amounts of<br>
information to memorize.<br>
the memorization in 30 min =~ 1k digits they use &quot;the location&quot;<br>
to 1 hour the record is =~2k digits<br>
 <br>
if you have 15 min you can use agrupation +association and probably<br>
sound when you need.<br>
than you can memorize worse but faster. the record is near to 750 digits<br>
 <br>
if you have 5 minutes you will probably use 2 or 3 agrupations at a<br>
time with very fast associations. the record is about 350 digits<br>
 <br>
If you have  1 second or less, you will use pure speed reading of less<br>
than . 4 seconds you can use speed reading with an agrupation you can<br>
create.<br>
 <br>
good luck<br>
:)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Agrupation is currently what I am trying for the 3x3x3.  I think I<br>
will stick to my images method for the bigger cubes though.  This is<br>
because I use 6-7 journey locations for the 4x4x4 and 12-13 for the<br>
5x5x5.  Ben uses 9 locations to memorize a stack of cards and his<br>
times are world class for speed cards.  So I think for memorizing<br>
around 9 locations with this method is a good idea.<br>

You&#x27;ll most definitely have me in that category for a very long time.  Your executions are crazy!  I remember you said that planning the solve then executing is a lot faster than sighted with no planning at all.  The one thing that I have to work on is creating longer cycles.  I intentionally seem to break the cycles while doing sighted solves.  Which is very stupid.  Because you can&#x27;t get any flow, it&#x27;s so choppy, and it&#x27;s what slows me down during 3x3 bld.  You are using memo cards.  Are your cards scrambled?  What I have is a page with the alphabet your first page basically.  I&#x27;ll run down the alphabet as fast as possible.  Scrambled cards is a little more difficult because it takes reaction and randomness into effect that occurs during an actual memorization.  It&#x27;s wierd because I recall the images a lot faster than the words so that I am just scanning and almost falling behind if I try to saw all of the words.  Like my words are catching up to my images when I get a
 lag in recall.  So when I actually go slowly w/o cards going from AB-EX I&#x27;ll actually say all of the words that I don&#x27;t normally say.  
   
  I was telling Marcus just how good my memo used to be.  It&#x27;s rather ironic, I was always told I had a gift ... now I&#x27;m using it for something I truely enjoy!  However I have a poor memory considering how good my memory really is.  That betrays my amazing memory skills.  It&#x27;s more so a selective memory.  Well ...

          Hey Daniel,

I ran through my stack of cards a couple of nights ago and it took me
about 20 minutes to do, which works out to 2.08 seconds per card. I
tried it again just now a few days later and ran through my whole
stack, randomly shuffled, in 13:00.49 or 1.36 seconds per image.

Before a couple nights ago I hadn&#x27;t run through my stack in a month or
more, since I felt that all my images were solidified well enough from
solving, and just going over letter groups in my head at work and stuff.

As to your idea to modify the words you don&#x27;t like, I did the same
with Michael Curtis&#x27; list. Many of my words are straight off his
list, but also a number I have changed to ones I like better.

Yeah man you&#x27;re learning the images really quickly! If ever you are
memorizing and one of your new letter pair images pops into your head,
use the new image before you use old stuff. That will help solidy
them. I remember my GK or Green Knight image really well because it
was one of the first where the GK image of the Green Knight popped
into my head on one solve when I had G followed by K, whereas at the
time I was using a single image to single piece method and should have
used two images there.

Anyway man I know recall can be very fast. I believe Ben Pridmore
said he could recall all of his images mentally (without a card stack)
in 15 minutes? Please someone correct me if I misquoted that time, I
searched the memory sports group but couldn&#x27;t find that post again. 
Anyway the time I remember was close to if not very well sub-20
minutes. Assuming a barely sub-20 time he still recalled 2.33 images
per second roughly. No that&#x27;s not seconds per image, but images per
second.

I find that I prefer to think of two random pieces on the cube and
convert those to letters then to my image, rather than to use my card
stack all of the time. I like to apply the image to those two pieces
on the cube. Some image groups come up so often that I can see those
two pieces and I instantly know the image, I don&#x27;t even have to think
of which letter each piece is.

Daniel I think you probably have a much stronger natural memory than I
do. When I first started it took me well over 40 minutes to recall
all of my images, and you&#x27;re already 1/5 the way through and recalling
at a faster pace than I do.

I&#x27;ll just have to keep working on my execution to overcome the crazy
memorization times you&#x27;ll get lol ;-)

This was  a video on an cubist meet.
And it was not the fastest one.
Danyang Chen Got an average record of 1 minute 27.38 seconds, and 
lucky case sub 1 minutes.

am not wording this properly please let me know and I will come up

I appreciate your patience as I have spent about 2 years away from the

  Yes, I mean moves that ruin orientation.

  I seem to remember that using setup moves such as F, R, B, and L;
  destroyed orientation. I also seem to remember that using F2, R2, B2,
  L2, U, D; were okay for preserving orientation. Is this correct? If I

          <div class="email-content">Thanks, Bill&#x27;s site is the page that got me interested in learning
BLD.  Today was my second day at it, and I am getting closer to
feeling comfortable with it.

I am still hitting a few rough patches with my setup moves, but after
I get the setups down, I should be rolling.

This is definatly lots of fun, and quite addicting.

  Yeah, it would really be helpful.

7:19.61 is the average of the middle 10 solves.<br>
<br>
It took me 19 solves to get an average of 12 so my accuracy is 12/19<br>
or about 63%<br>
<br>
Lately I have been trying to go very quickly for memorization and<br>
absolutely break neck full speed for solving.  I&#x27;m trying to get used<br>
to going much faster than my comfortable pace so as to improve my<br>
overall speed when trying to go more carefully.  Once I get more used<br>
to this speed I&#x27;m curious if I can get a sub-8 average with a high<br>
accuracy like 80-90% - that&#x27;s my goal now.<br>
<br>
Still, right now I&#x27;m glad to just get a sub-8 average period :-D<br>

<br>
I&#x27;m not good at cycle style.  Here&#x27;s a sample EP:  Just do F2 D&#x27; B R <br>
B L U&#x27; L&#x27; U B to setup.  <br>
<br>
Now I go to memorize.  I start at UF and see that the cycle goes UF-<br>
&gt;DF-&gt;DR-&gt;DL, then ends, and I have to recall that I have two to swap <br>
now.<br>
<br>
Next my eyes go back up to my next spot, UL.  I see that the cycle <br>
goes UL-&gt;BR-&gt;UB-&gt;BL, then ends, and again I have to recall another <br>
two to swap.<br>
<br>
Next my eyes go up again to my next spot, UB, but I had UB in my last <br>
cycle, so I skip it, and go to my next spot, UR.  I see that the <br>
cycle goes UR-&gt;FL-&gt;FR-&gt;DB, ends, and once again I have two to swap.<br>
<br>
So I have now UF needs to swap with DL, UL with BL, and UR with DB.<br>
<br>
I have not yet come up with a good way to memorize this situation, <br>
nor do I have a good way to solve it.  <br>
<br>
Assuming that for a 1:20 solve I&#x27;d need to memorize this in at least <br>
30 sec, I haven&#x27;t been able to do it.  <br>

          <div class="email-content">Usually when I have a bunch of random edges to flip, I usually flip
all 12 then flip the two I messed up.

As for the cycles, when I have a bunch of doubles, I cycle them as
normal, knowing that the FIRST edge of the next cycle will simply go
to the back.

So in your case you have (UF DF DR DL) (UL BR UB BL) (UR FL FR DB). 
Cycle (UF DF DR) as normal and you now get (UF DL) (UL BR UB BL) (UR
FL FR DB).  Instead of &quot;keeping UF DL in mind for later,&quot; go ahead and
cycle (UF DL UL), knowing it&#x27;ll drop DL and kick UL (the end of the
first cycle) to the end of its own cycle.

(UF DL) (UL BR UB BL) (UR FL FR DB) becomes (UF BR UB BL UL) (UR FL FR
DB).  The cool thing about this approach is that it doesn&#x27;t disturb
your memory much -- all it does is finish off the second element of
cycle 1 and kick the start of cycle 2 to the end.  All you need to
remember is what the start of the second cycle was specifically -- and
be able to kick it to the end.  So in this case you&#x27;d do (UF BR UB)
then (UF BL UL) to finish off that mutated second cycle. Then you got
(UR FL FR DB) to reduce after doing (UR FL FR), in which case you then
have (UR DB) and thus a parity error.  

I still haven&#x27;t devised an easy way to deal with parities.  I am
thinking maybe Pochmann approach would be best here? Simple two cycle
of corners and edges using T Perms... very mindless and easy to do.

In the case of (a b)(c d) where a, b, and c denote arbitrary singular
pieces within a cycle and d denotes any number of edges within that

(a b)(c d) can be thought of as (a b c d c).

Thanks a lot Marcus.  I&quot;ve been messing around with this and it is 
indeed cool and a valuable tip.  I can see I have a lot to learn yet 
about cycling.  I hope I&#x27;m not the only one that you&#x27;ve helped.  
Thanks again.

  That is how Bill remembers his CO, and how he teaches it.  (xxxx) represent corners 1-4 on the top.  0 is solved, 1 is a cw turn away, 2 is a ccw turn away.

          <div class="email-content">So...you memorise EP first...what about the rest? which order?
I do CO EO CP EP, and solve the same way...I guess it&#x27;s because that was the way I learned from Macky&#x27;s site : )

and by 6 flip you mean (R B R&#x27; U)*5? or what?

Tyson Mao &lt;tyson.mao@...> escreveu:                                  Uh... for a 1:20 solve, you don&#x27;t have 30 seconds to memorize EP.  You mean 30 seconds for the entire Rubik&#x27;s Cube right?  Typically, I have my EP memorized in under 20 seconds.  I generally glance up at the timer after EP and use it as a benchmark to see how my memorization is going.  A good EP I can memorize in about 12 seconds.  The slow ones get closer to 20 and sometimes if I&#x27;m tired, maybe 22 seconds. 

For 10-edge flip, I generally do 6 + 4.  The super-12-edge flip algorithm consists of two 6-flips for me, which takes time.  I find it faster to do a 6 flip + a 4 flip because the 4 flip is so fast.  Though, I rarely run across the case, so I haven&#x27;t had much chance to practice.

          <div class="email-content">I was wondering about your 3-cycle methods.  Do you always use the 
Edge PLLs?
Do you use 2-gen, or optimal face-turn-metric algs??
Does anybody use other 2-gen algs such as 
R&#x27;URU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR2 or RU&#x27;R&#x27;URURUR&#x27;U&#x27;R2?  I think the EP system can 
be fast w/ a system like such, where you set the first cubie to the 
U layer, and the next cubie is setup by d move.

Does anybody use this approach?

<br>
When I remember my corner orientation, I don&#x27;t need to remember the<br>
orientation of corner one (UFL), since the method I use is a bit<br>
remedial and slow.<br>
<br>
I move an improperly orientated corner into UFR and do ...<br>
L D R&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; D R D&#x27; Z R&#x27; D&#x27; L D R D&#x27; L&#x27; D Z&#x27;<br>
<br>
So by the time I fix corners 2-8, corner one has to take on the proper<br>
orientation by default, its a &#x27;slow but sure&#x27; method.<br>
<br>
hope I explained it clearly.<br>

  I had it explained to me just now.  You go through and orient each corner, using the x-corner as a free one.  When 7 corners are oriented, the last one is done as well.

          <div class="email-content">What I do currently for CO is I remember it very last.  This way I don&#x27;t really remember anything, I just look at it, plan out the algs/setups I need for them, and then do that, then go back to what I remembered before.  I have found it very quick to do it that way.  I use the alg from Mackys site for CO:
A = (R&#x27;D&#x27;RD)x2

Then, to flip UFL and UFR, I use U&#x27;AUA&#x27;.  To flip 3 corners clockwise, just do A as I move each piece I want flipped into the position where I am doing the flipping, which is typically 2.  If you do a z&#x27; move before you perform the alg, it goes very quick.  I can usually have CO/memo of that done in about 15-30 seconds, which is by far the quickest piece for me.

  The idea for corner orientation is you look at things in groups and not as individual pieces.

  Types of groups are pairs, groups of 3, groups of 4, and if you&#x27;re more advanced, groups of 5.  (5 can be considered as 2 + 3). 

  If you see a pair, it&#x27;s generally pretty clear on how to orient those two.  If they&#x27;re next to each other, it&#x27;s quite simple.  If they&#x27;re not next to each other, it only takes one setup move to put them next to each other.  The setup move isn&#x27;t necessary unless they&#x27;re both in different layers. 

  Groups of 3 are also pretty quick.  Usually, they&#x27;re all next to each other.  If not, you need a setup move.  In a couple cases, you need two setup moves.

  For a group of four, there&#x27;s only two different patterns.  One is 1 2 1 2 and the other is 1 1 2 2.  You simply learn to recognize these and execute the correct algorithms. 

  Does this help?

  Dude, I understand what you mean about analyzing then memorizing.
  I do the same. If I see multiple disoriented edges that are permuted, I&#x27;ll think how can I set them up to do a 2-edge flip?  Mind you I use Pochmann too.  I try and make things as braindead as possible. This piece, ok that&#x27;s how I solve it, and that&#x27;s always how. One step in analysis I used to take was to take the chance to avoid the LU as a piece in the cycle. I found scanning for pieces is a lot slower than scanning over the locations.
  I am solving the 3x3 in about 160-170 at the moment, even when I think memo is attrocious!
  As for memorizing.  I memorize visually.  I count as I go along.  I don&#x27;t have UL, RF, and etc set as numbers, but I count as I go along.  I&#x27;d have to say about 90 and 90 for each portion of the solve.  This can be improved surely.  Good luck man!!
   
  I am looking into a 3-cycle method where you orient all edges then set the first cubie to the U layer(2 move max), and then adjust the D and E slice w/ d turns so that you can solve the cycle with 2-gen.
  Setups are limited to {D,d,L,l} and a very fast alg system.  I really hope to practice with it, however, big cube bld and work are taking prescedence.
   
  You can learn a lot from self exploration, don&#x27;t always ask questions, find your own answers to your own problems.  Not saying you shouldn&#x27;t be asking right now, but you can learn a lot from independent study as well.

          By no means am I belittling your abilities to solve the Rubik&#x27;s Cube blindfolded.  I was wondering how you distinguish between analyze and memorize?

I ask this because when I started blindfold cubing, I approached it differently.  I would memorize all the information first, and then analyze it later after I had put the blindfold on.  The idea when I started was to have all the information committed to memory, and then go along and figure out what each cycle was. 

This method works all right if you have a fast memory, but it depends on your ability to &quot;look ahead&quot; while solving blindfolded.  If you can analyze the next cycle while you perform the current cycle, then you&#x27;re in good shape. 

For me now, since I&#x27;ve probably done every possible cycle on the cube, the analysis is pretty quick, so there isn&#x27;t much delay as long as my memory is smooth.  However, there are cases where I do &quot;analyze&quot; before I &quot;memorize.&quot;  Well, the idea is to analyze and memorize at the same time, or use your analyze as the memory. 

In certain cases, it&#x27;s easier to memorize something during the analysis.  An example... perhaps you notice that B2 + (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;)x3 + B2 solves a certain corner parity.  Instead of memorizing the positions of the cycles (or transpositions), I would analyze them while I was looking at the cube, and memorize the analysis, and not the cycle paths. 

I guess my input here is not to limit yourself to one method or another.  Whichever way is easier for you to memorize the cube, you might as well go with it.  In this manner, you will gain comfort with more ways to memorize and attack the cube, and you&#x27;ll have more tools in your arsenal and have a greater ability to handle more complex mental tasks. 

So... don&#x27;t always analyze, then memorize.  Sometimes, it works, but in some situations, it might be faster to do it the other way around.  Play around with it...

Sorry if I sounded condescending.  I don&#x27;t mean to be.  I just don&#x27;t want to hear you (a general you, not you in particular) say that you average BLD solving in 30 seconds, but then have no idea of the OLL + U-perm for corner orientation.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, not everyone knows the same algorithms, especially by name --
sometimes people like figuring out different algorithms that work
better.  I&#x27;d assume a fair number aren&#x27;t entirely certain what an &quot;OLL

length), but can accomplish the same effect through other means. 
There are many ways to skin a cat (or blindfold-solve a cube).

Daniel, what is your opinion on using Pochmann method for parity
errors? Those things have always killed me... they add a sickening
amount of wasted energy and time to my... well, times.  Figuring out
how to set up two corners and two edges into a reasonable position
(preserving orientation) to execute a PLL algorithm is sometimes
difficult (I still have not relearned all of PLL because I no longer
have an interest in purely speedcubing, although one of these days I
should just buck it up and relearn it all), and it requires a lot of
disgusting manipulations for me.  

However, do you think it is possible, or even ultimately pragmatic to
use Pochmann for this exception instead? How fast could a parity error
be solved on average given two oriented corners and two oriented edges
(which could be anywhere on the cube)?

          <div class="email-content"><br>
First, allow me to differentiate between two terms that I will use<br>
often.<br>
Setup:  To use moves bring the target piece into a target area.  [d&#x27;l&#x27;]<br>
would be the setup to move the RF to the UL<br>
Conjugation:  By true definition setups are conjugations.  However, I<br>
will refer to a conjugation as a setup move that cancels moves on the<br>
algorithm.<br>
<br>
FRU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FRF&#x27; is the standard Y permutation, Conjugated by<br>
F&#x27; and a cube rotation, we get:  [y&#x27;F&#x27;]FRU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FRF&#x27;[Fy] ==<br>
y&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FRy<br>
Notice how the moves canceled out.  And see that this setup alg:<br>
[d&#x27;l&#x27;]RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FR2U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;[ld] has no canceling effect as the y perm<br>
did.<br>
[My approach to solving the cube blindfolded]<br>
Solve edges one at a time<br>
-3 PLL are used<br>
-All three involve the UR and another U layer edge<br>
-All three swap the UFR and URB<br>
-No orientation phase is necassary, permutation and orientation are<br>
solved by the proper setup<br>
What is the parity?<br>
-A parity occurs when I use an odd number of 2-cycles to solve the edges<br>
-At this point, the UFR and URB are swapped<br>
-To continue use a two cycle that swaps the UFR and URB, restoring<br>
corner permuation<br>
-I use LU&#x27;R&#x27;UL&#x27;U2RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2R, this swaps the two corners and the UR and UB<br>
Is the parity really fixed?  (The UR and UB are swapped afterall!)<br>
-Yes, it is.  The corners require an odd number of 2-cycles to be solved<br>
as well<br>
-Using Conjgated PLLs that swap the UR and UB, once the corners are<br>
solved the edges will be restored<br>
Solve the corners one at a time<br>
-3 basic conjugations of the PLL are used to solve the corners<br>
-All three swap the URB and a face on the DFL (that is the DFL, FLD, and<br>
LDF)<br>
-As said before the UR and UB are the corners being swapped<br>
Pochmann uses 1 alg for corners, why use 3?<br>
-I use 3 algs to reduce setup moves<br>
-I actually use even more than 3, I have deeper conjugations of the PLL<br>
-However 3 is the bare minimum to always use one face move per setup<br>
-Through the use of PLL and Conjugations thereof, 12 corner cases can be<br>
solved w/o setup<br>
-Of the 9 left, only 3 require a face move that is 2 quarter turns<br>
<br>
Examples of a deeper conjugation:<br>
[y&#x27;R&#x27;F&#x27;]FRU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FRF&#x27;[FRy] == y&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FR2y<br>
[y&#x27;R2F&#x27;]FRU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FRF&#x27;[FR2y] == y&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FR&#x27;y<br>
<br>
A standard 2-cycle method, such as pochmanns or mine cannot be used<br>
haphazardly with 3-cycles.  A 2-cycle method has controlled areas in<br>
which the cube is affected.<br>
You want to use it so you can swap any two corners and any two edges.<br>
However, Pochmann&#x27;s method specifically swaps the same two edges and two<br>
corners every solve.<br>
<br>
I have a solution to your problem, you may not like it though, but you<br>
definitely don&#x27;t like your approach to parity fixing, so I&#x27;ll discuss my<br>
thoughts w/ you later.  And yes, this will preserve EO and CO, however,<br>
these two steps must be done before my concept is applied.<br>

          <div class="email-content">No I&#x27;m not trying to get into some attack-war here -- I am just saying
that it is very possible to solve a cube blindfolded quickly and not
be entirely familiar with all the Fridrich algorithms, because you
simply don&#x27;t have to use explicit-Fridrich when you blindsolve.  Just
because you use an algorithm that permutes things while preserving
orientation doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s automatically considered Fridrich-style,
and on the same note, it doesn&#x27;t mean that knowledge of the whole
Fridrich method is a prerequisite for blindfold-solving credibility.

          <div class="email-content">With speed comes credibility.  And people will listen to people who <br>
post fast time.<br>
<br>
I, unfortunately, know a cuber who&#x27;ll probably never get beyond 19 <br>
seconds because he kept waiting for this magical &quot;Waterman&quot; <br>
corners-first method.  The method was never published.  These algorithm <br>
sets were never &quot;released.&quot;  The fast cuber who claimed this method <br>
existed kept saying that it wasn&#x27;t ready for release, that the public <br>
wasn&#x27;t ready for it yet.<br>
<br>
And now what&#x27;s he supposed to do?  He dedicated over a year of his life <br>
focusing on this method because someone said they could average <br>
16.xx... and then he finds out later that it&#x27;s all just a big scam.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s the only reason why I care.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t.  People can <br>
say whatever they want, and until they beat me in competition, I don&#x27;t <br>
even have to throw them a glance.  But seeing someone waste a year of <br>
their life on a magical method that never existed because someone <br>
claimed ridiculous times... that&#x27;s why I care.<br>

          <div class="email-content">That does raise some points though for consideration.  If the method
was never published, how did he waste a year? Did he just sit there
and wait for a delivery? In the meantime it&#x27;d be better to become
familiar with the workings of the cube or try out another fast method
that will at least get you somewhat near the time you desire -- no one
is ever doomed to be stuck at the 19 barrier.  It&#x27;s one&#x27;s own decision
as to what they choose to listen to and what they do not, and if an
entire method is being withheld, odds are you&#x27;re better off not
listening.  However, if a method&#x27;s workings are revealed and it shows
to facilitate, then, logically, there is no harm in listening if one
chooses to.
