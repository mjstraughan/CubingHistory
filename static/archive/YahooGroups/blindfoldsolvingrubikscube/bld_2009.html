      <strong>1. Pochmann- Corners First?</strong><br />

        I have been trying to lean the Pochmann method, and It is progressing
        pretty well. I can memorize the edge cycle in about 2 minutes, and
        remember it for hours. My only problem is the corner cycle. I have tried
        several different memory methods, and none of them stick wit me for more
        than about a minute. So, to accomodate how my memory works, I thought to
        reverse the order. Do corners first, and then edges. Since the two are
        virtually independent of each other, it should work. I am away from home
        right now, and don&#x27;t have a cube to work with, so it is just a
        theory right now. Does anyone know of any problems that can arise by
        doing it this way? The only one I can possibly think of is getting an
        odd number of corner transpos. I would then have to adjust the UB and UL
        pieces back to their original places. That can be easily fixed with his
        idea of a T permutation followed by a 3-edge cycle. However, that then
        switches the UBR and UFR corners. Do the edge and corner cycles always
        come in even/even or odd/odd pairs? Sorry for the rambling, just trying
        to figure this out. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

        Hi everyone, Daniel and I finally got the first installment up for our
        website. This is only the start to what will, hopefully, soon be an
        extensive resource about solving using the BH blindfold method.
