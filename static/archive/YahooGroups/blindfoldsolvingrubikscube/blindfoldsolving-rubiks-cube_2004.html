Anybody still living in this group? ;-) I just heard of it and was<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

Yup, I&#x27;m alive. lol
answer to your q: Dr. C does not use all those algs, just suggested 
that more algorithms could be used for blindfold cubing, and came up 
with that list. I&#x27;ve memorized some of the useful ones (especially 
edge orientation alg.), but I feel that BCFSSS (Blindfold cubing for 
seriously sad savants - a work in progress by Dr. C) is a little too 
much for me, at least for now. Maybe I&#x27;ll try it in the summer...

My method is basically the same as the method on stiff_hands&#x27; page, 
i.e. I memorize permutation in cycles. For orientation, I don&#x27;t use 
any numbers, but take a mental picture of the blue/white stickers (my 
U and D...japanese color scheme)
For solving, I start with corner orientation (since this is the 
hardest part for me), then edge orientation. Then I move on to 
permutation, but this is done in a totally random manner. (for 
example, I stop in the middle of permuting the edges and use some PLL 
algs to move around corners and edges at the same time, then go back 
to solving corners and edges separately)

i sure hope that makes sense. :D

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dr. C, <br>
<br>
I know what you want! <br>
<br>
&gt;Actually, for 5 (or even 4), if anyone has an algorithm for centre 3 <br>
&gt;cycles of the following form:<br>
&gt; F face      B face<br>
&gt;AAA          XXX  <br>
&gt;AAA          XXX<br>
&gt;AAC          AXX<br>
&gt;^ ^          ^<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;(i.e. something that effectively puts the C in the F face into the <br>
&gt;place occupied by the A on the B face using, e.g., the marked A (or <br>
&gt;another equivalent) on the F face)), it would make solving the 5 <br>
&gt;blindfolded a lot easier.<br>
I can&#x27;t determine whether marked &quot;A&quot; on B face is Bld or Brd. <br>
Anyway, put &quot;A&quot; on B face to Blu using B face turn. <br>
<br>
(Bx) l2 d R d&#x27; l2 d R&#x27; d&#x27; (B&#x27;x)<br>
I don&#x27;t use this for regular solving but this should work for your <br>
case. <br>
<br>
Hope this will help your amazing speedblindfold solving big cubes. <br>

          <div class="email-content">I thought about orienting the ULF, URB, DLB and DRF corners with one <br>
algorithm and then the other four corners with another algorithm. <br>
That is, assuming those two groups can be oriented independently <br>
(each sums up to a multiple of 3). If not, one more preparation alg <br>
can make it so.<br>
<br>
The nice thing is that you need only very few algorithms and before <br>
and after applying one of them you only need to turn the cube as a <br>
whole, no &quot;real&quot; moves are necessary.<br>
<br>
There are only four sets of orientations:<br>
- { 0, 0, 0, 0 }<br>
- { 0, 0, 1, 2 }<br>
- { 0, 1, 1, 1 }<br>
- { 0, 2, 2, 2 }<br>
- { 1, 1, 2, 2 }<br>
<br>
You can always turn the whole cube so that the smallest of those <br>
numbers is at ULF, the second smallest at URB, the third smallest at <br>
DLB and the largest at DRF. Then apply one of only four (three <br>
without inversion) algorithms.<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">I do this a lot on 2x2x2... well, kind of.
What I do is first I use an alg to get corners in their correct layer 
(U/D) and the corners of each layer solvable (sums up to 3k), and 
then use CLL to solve each layer. If you can read the first part 
really fast, there&#x27;s almost nothing to remember and only 3 algs to 
do, which means lots of time saved for you. :D I use this method only 
when I can do what I wrote in the last sentence, and if not, just 
stick to the usual stiff_hands&#x27; style.

Hi Chris,

I would definately participate - though I may miss out an occasional 
week if I get too busy.  I rarely time myself so it would make for a 
great incentive for me to actually become more efficient on the 
memorization aspect.  I don&#x27;t find the memorization hard at all - 
but perhaps that&#x27;s because I am quite meticulous about it.  How well 
woud it sink in if I were just to give it a quick glance???

As for thoughts on the contest structure:
- I think it would be nice if we could have a couple of scramble 
algs.  This would allow people to go slow and steady in order to be 
able to enter a time, but also to open the floodgates and try to 
maximize speed with the remaining scrambles. 
- what would the &#x27;turn around&#x27; time be?  i.e. how many days after 
the scrambles are posted would we have before we would have to 
submit our times?

CONGRATS on blindfolding the Super4!!  Very cool!

Rob

 <br>
Good job doing the 2x2 blindfold, how long did it take you. Btw, the 2x2 is the best way to start blindfold, and keep trying hard and get fast timees and post it online! I was all happy when I first did the 2x2 blindfold also!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I wondered what you think about this: Imagine you&#x27;re trying to solve a<br>
harder puzzle blindfolded, which will take you let&#x27;s say much more<br>
than an hour. Would you consider it cheating to ask someone to check a<br>
certain subgoal? I wouldn&#x27;t let him/her touch the puzzle, only look<br>
and tell me &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. If the answer is &quot;no&quot; then I&#x27;d immediately<br>
count that attempt as DNF, though sometimes I might finish it just for<br>
learning/training purposes. But if I feel I don&#x27;t want to waste time<br>
on an already flawed solve, then this could save me some time. So,<br>
what do you think?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone, the Sunday BD contest algs are posted for this <br>
sunday.  I also made a few rules changes (thanks to everyone for all <br>
the feedback).  I hope everyone who participated in the last contest <br>
was satisfied with how the contest is set up.  If not, please let me <br>
know what you didn&#x27;t like so we can try to make this competition as <br>
fair, and as fun, as possible.  Basically the rule changes cleared <br>
up that in the open division, you have to declare a solve as <br>
official before you scramble the puzzle (assuming you are BD solving <br>
a sequential movement puzzle).  Also I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m going to <br>
make the Division I and Division II categories as close to official <br>
competitions as possible, so the first rule for each is now that no <br>
note taking or help of any kind (other than just brainpower) is <br>
allowed to help memorize the cube.  You of course have total free <br>
rein in the open division.  You can create the &quot;3x3x3 with the aid <br>
of notes to help memorize category&quot;  So feel free to be as creative <br>
as possible with the open division.  Just remember you still are <br>
required to wear a blindfold of some type :)<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone for the feedback, and I hope you guys liked the <br>
competition.  If you didn&#x27;t participate last time feel free to give <br>
it a shot!  It&#x27;s a lot of fun!  If you did participate last week I <br>
hope to see you on the lists again :)<br>

<br>
This could easily be abused, but as long as you are truly verifying <br>
that you are where you think you are, and not attempting to figure <br>
out where you actually are (therefore actually cheating, not <br>
checking), then I think that should be acceptable.  Unnofficial <br>
attempts are all on your honor, anyways, so there&#x27;s not much point in <br>
checking with someone else, if your just going to cheat ;-)<br>
<br>
An idea like this could even be useful in official competition <br>
situations to shorten failed attempts.  I don&#x27;t know, though - it may <br>
be too hard to make sure the competitor isn&#x27;t actually cheating.  I <br>
suppose that limiting it to &quot;yes&quot; or pre-determined answers might do <br>
the trick - the competitor must ask questions that are answered yes, <br>
or provide ahead of time the answer they expect.<br>
<br>
Anyways, You just have to make sure that the person doing the <br>
checking answers your questions directly without giving anything else <br>
away about the state of the puzzle.  I mean, who wants to keep going <br>
for another couple hours if you know you already messed up after just <br>
15 minutes to an hour, aside from learning/practice, of course.  Even <br>
worse, who wants to be a couple hours into a solve, be where they <br>
think they are, and then have a checker reveal too much about the <br>
puzzle&#x27;s state?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I wanted to put this rule change suggestion up for discussion.  Rule <br>
#7 currently reads (in part):<br>
&gt; Competitors are required to obstruct their eyes with a blindfold of<br>
&gt; some sort for the solving portion of each trial. The material of<br>
&gt; the blindfold may not be transparent to any degree. Simply closing<br>
&gt; your eyes or &quot;not looking&quot; are not allowed in this competition in<br>
&gt; order to simulate the competitive conditions at an official<br>
&gt; competition.<br>
<br>
I would suggest that it should also be acceptable to hold the cube <br>
behind/under a non-transparent object, such as a desk or table, <br>
thereby obstructing the object, rather than the eyes.  It seems <br>
reasonable, to me, to assume that someone may have some free time to <br>
blow and not be carrying something with them that they can use as a <br>
blindfold.  For example, I think back to when someone solved a cube <br>
under the sheet while getting their hair cut - was that Richard?<br>
<br>
If I ever get to the point of being able to do this more quickly (see <br>
the other post I&#x27;ll send shortly), I&#x27;d like to be able to try this <br>
during lunch at work, one day, without having to plan ahead and make <br>
sure I have something there with which to blindfold myself.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think the way I had in mind makes cheating possible. I meant <br>
questions like:<br>
<br>
- Are all edges oriented correctly now?<br>
- Are all corners permuted correctly now?<br>
- Is yellow center on top? (e.g. for odd cubes or Megaminx)<br>
<br>
This of course needs proper instructions given to the checking <br>
person in advance. The person needs to know 100% what he/she has to <br>
do and is only allowed to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. If yes, you&#x27;re allowed <br>
to go on and if no, your attempt is immediately invalid. If the <br>
checker needs to ask for a clarification then things have gone wrong <br>
already.<br>
<br>
I just thought about exploiting it at the end or near the end or <br>
at/near the end of subgoals, but I can&#x27;t think of a working example. <br>
Can you give a specific example? I think instead of asking you could <br>
always just assume the answer would be &quot;yes&quot; and act accordingly.<br>
<br>
Hmm, maybe you can gain information by the time it takes the checker <br>
to answer the question. For example, if you want to know whether you <br>
already did that damn final U turn or not, you could ask &quot;can the <br>
cube be solved only turning U? If it&#x27;s already solved then the <br>
checker might say &quot;yes&quot; faster than if it&#x27;s not. This problem could <br>
be solved by fixing the questions in advance together with a time <br>
you&#x27;ll have to wait for the answer.<br>
<br>
Or you could gain information by where he&#x27;s walking around you to <br>
look at other sides. Or which sides he asks you to show him (which <br>
should be forbidden. Only &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; are the only things he&#x27;s <br>
allowed to say). This could be solved by fixing a route around the <br>
solver for each question as well ;-)<br>
<br>
However, I really only intended this for honest checks. I hope this <br>
won&#x27;t be exploited in private attempts and like you, I think it <br>
could be useful (also for official contests).<br>
<br>
And in case you&#x27;re wondering: I didn&#x27;t use this for the Megaminx. <br>
That was standard blindsolving, also without taking notes and with <br>
wearing a real blindfold.<br>
<br>
Oh, btw. The checker should be someone you would not like to kill if <br>
he makes a mistake ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Okay - I&#x27;ve got a problem. I have solved a cube blindfolded, but it <br>
was only once, and that was ages ago.  I&#x27;d like to be able to do it <br>
some more, but it just took way too long to do it again.  That said, <br>
I&#x27;ll probably never be doing anything larger than a 3x3x3, since I <br>
think 30-45 minutes is too long to spend on a single solve.<br>
<br>
I started out practicing on doing the 2x2x2, and then I moved to the <br>
3x3x3.  I was able to do it on my first try, but it seems to me that <br>
permutations are unneccessarily difficult.  Even if all I do is <br>
memorize corner permutations and correct it, it&#x27;s very difficult for <br>
me to accomplish... I feel like I&#x27;m missing something.  <br>
<br>
Anyways... I find that I can memorize the numbers without a whole lot <br>
of difficulty, and I&#x27;m sure I could do it pretty quickly given more <br>
practice (a lot more).  What messes me up is actually executing <br>
permutations.  I memorize using Richard Carr&#x27;s method - remember <br>
which piece is in each position.  I find that as soon as I try to <br>
apply the first permutation sequence (even just for corners), I take <br>
a long time to process the cube, create the new permutation layout <br>
mentally, and finally apply the sequence.<br>
<br>
Several questions come out of this:<br>
1) Are there any tips or tricks anyone can give on how to <br>
adjust/remember new permutations as you go?<br>
2) Do people find it&#x27;s easier to remember cycles, or to remember <br>
pieces/positions?<br>
3) If you remember pieces/positions, do you cycle pieces to place 2 <br>
at a time, or do you place one piece at a time, in a specific order?  <br>
For example, I was thinking it might make my life a little easier if <br>
I first place DBL, then DBR, then DFL, etc. for the corners, and <br>
similarly for the edges.  I found it difficult to figure out how to <br>
rotate any three edges or corners on a whim - I&#x27;d always go to great <br>
pains to apply setup sequences and remember how to reverse them.  How <br>
do you guys do it?<br>
4) If you remember cycles, how do you remember them?  For example, if <br>
there are two 3 cycles of corners, 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt; and 4-&gt;5-&gt;6, how do you <br>
distinguish that in your mind from 1&lt;-&gt;2 3&lt;-&gt;4 5&lt;-&gt;6?  Do you <br>
remember 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 4?  It seems it would be easier to work <br>
through the cycle memory - just chip away a couple numbers each time <br>
you dig into a cycle - but I don&#x27;t get how to effectively memorize it <br>
in the first place.  Essentially, parts of both approaches make sense <br>
to me, but neither makes sense to me completely on its own.<br>
<br>
I think that&#x27;s it for now... I&#x27;d love to have this skill as something <br>
that I can demonstrate, rather than just being able to say - &quot;oh, <br>
yeah... I did that once, and it took me about an hour&quot;.<br>

How <br>
&gt; do you guys do it?<br>
<br>
Here comes something I intended to suggest anyway. It helps me a lot <br>
for the setup sequences and reversing them, at least to get them <br>
right. <br>
I&#x27;m not yet fast though, but in general I think it can help:<br>
<br>
Talk to yourself. Loud. I mean, don&#x27;t scream, but actually talk <br>
physically. Not just inside your head. Whispering can be enough. <br>
This has two big benefits for <br>
me:<br>
<br>
1) One of my biggest problems has always been that I wasn&#x27;t sure <br>
whether I had already done the move I wanted to. So should I move on <br>
or do the move now??? Believe me, this *will* happen for complex <br>
puzzles unless you&#x27;re the god of concentration (which I&#x27;m obviously <br>
not ;-). Talking to yourself makes use of the so-called echoic <br>
memory in addition to your normal working memory. You know, like you <br>
still &quot;hear&quot; a sound in your ear that you heard moments ago but <br>
that&#x27;s already over. I comment *every single turn* unless I&#x27;m <br>
executing a long algorithm that my hands can perfectly execute. <br>
Well, I usuall only say things like &quot;down, right, up, left&quot; <br>
(corresponding to L D L&#x27; D&#x27;). For the Megaminx, I even do double <br>
turns in two steps and comment each one. I also speak to myself <br>
between some moves (mostly between algs), explaining to me what I&#x27;ve <br>
just done and what I&#x27;ll do next. I think speaking to myself builds <br>
an extra link between my hands and my brain so they don&#x27;t go <br>
separate ways ;-)<br>
<br>
2) It calms me down. Considerably ;-)<br>
<br>
Btw, here&#x27;s something nice Google found about echoic memory:<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been thinking more about blindfold cubing lately... I&#x27;d like to <br>
finally do another cube blindfolded (without spending an hour on it), <br>
and it&#x27;s made me wonder - for those of you who can solve a cube <br>
blindfolded in 10-15 minutes or better (I&#x27;d ask just under 5, but <br>
that may only be 1-2 people), how long does it take you to <br>
memorize/perform the different stages of your solution?<br>
<br>
For example, if you take Richard Carr&#x27;s approach, where you orient <br>
corners, orient edges, permute corners, and finally permute edges, <br>
how long would it take for you to do each stage, independently.  I <br>
just timed myself a couple times on the orientation stages, and found <br>
that, depending on the difficulty of the case, it took anywhere from <br>
0:17 - 1:12 to memorize and fix corner orientation and from 0:34 - <br>
1:40 to memorize and fix edge orientation.<br>
<br>
How do you compare?  More importantly (for my interest, anyways), is <br>
how long do the permutation stages take for memorization/execution?  <br>
How does the sum of the parts compare to the whole time to memorize <br>
the whole cube and solve it?  I&#x27;m just curious to know if you can do <br>
it 2-3 times as fast when doing the parts, or if it&#x27;s pretty much <br>
just the combination of the parts.  Okay, I&#x27;ve babbled enough - I <br>

          <div class="email-content">First of all, I use my own method for memory blindfold cubing.  In 
my method, I combine orientation and permuting of corners into one 
phase and orientation and permuting of edges into the second phase.  
(As far as possible that is.  Often times when removing a corner (or 
edge) cycle, when the last piece in the cycle returns to its home 
position, it does so with a twist (or flip).  When this occurs, 
invariably there are other corner (or edge) cycles that also contain 
a twist (or flip).  I usually take care of any left over 
twists/flips at the end of my two phases.  And then, if the parity 
of the original scrambled cube was odd, then I take care of the swap 
of the last pair of corners and last pair of edges at the very 
end.)  At present, my memorization takes entirely too long.  It&#x27;s 
about 70-80% of my total time.  The rest is split fairly evenly 
between corners and edges.  (For me edges are easier, and go 
quicker, but there are more of them.)  

Having written the above, I suggest that for beginning blindfold, 
accuracy is way more important than speed.  Speed comes only 
from &quot;having been there before&quot;.  In other words, every time you 
encounter a new situation that you haven&#x27;t done for yourself before, 
then you have to spend time analyzing (which is slow) rather than 
remember what you did in that situation the last time (which is 
quicker).  So I guess I&#x27;m trying to say that there is no substitute 
for putting in the time.

          <div class="email-content">Hey I have a lot of questions, so sorry but this is going to be a <br>
long post (I seem to always do that apparently).  I started doing <br>
blindfold solving by giving each piece a specific label (I always <br>
solve the cube from the same orientation).  So when solving I know <br>
where each piece is and I start by placing all the middle layer <br>
pieces in their correct spots, then all the top and bottom layer <br>
pieces into their correct layers, then all the pieces in each layer <br>
to their correct spots (4-8 algs total for the edges and 3-4 for the <br>
corners).  Recently I started trying Macky&#x27;s way of using cycles and <br>
dropping off two of the numbers in the memorized string of numbers <br>
after doing each 3 cycle.  My question is which is <br>
faster/better/etc.?  My old way allowed you to know where every <br>
piece was at any given time, and you could use 4 cycles, 3 cycles, <br>
algs that 2 cycled corners and edges (odd permutations) at any time <br>
to fix edges and corners simultaneously.  The problem is that it <br>
requires more algs and lots of &quot;re-memorizing&quot; after you perform an <br>
alg.  Macky&#x27;s way, which I&#x27;ve only practiced for a week, is MUCH <br>
faster the times I am successful and lets you forget stuff rather <br>
than re-memorize after doing each 3 cycle (which is faster in my <br>
opinion as well).  However I ALWAYS seem to mess up something when I <br>
solve via cycles.  My accuracy memorizing piece by piece is easily 2 <br>
or 3 times my &quot;solving by cycles&quot; accuracy.  For you people who <br>
solve via cycles, how do you get _SO_ fast and how do you stay <br>
accurate?  My fastest solving via cycles (for both corners and <br>
edges) is 4 minutes 39 seconds.  My fastest solving both corners and <br>
edges &quot;piece by piece&quot; is 6 minutes 30 seconds, so I think cycles is <br>
faster.<br>
<br>
Also when I&#x27;m solving via cycles and run into an odd permutation in <br>
the corners and edges at the end, I&#x27;ve found that often I have to do <br>
a long series of setup moves to get all the pieces into the top or <br>
bottom layer so that I can do an alg to fix them, but it is easy for <br>
me to forget the setup moves I did since it can take up to 6 or 7.  <br>
Solving via &quot;piece by piece memorizing&quot; I always grouped the pieces <br>
together into useful ways early on, so in the end if it came down to <br>
an odd permutation all the pieces would be in one layer anyway and I <br>
could just do an alg to fix them with no setup moves.<br>
<br>
Also (and I know I am rambling on a lot) I&#x27;ve tried solving the <br>
edges via cycles and solving the corners via piece-by-piece and have <br>
gotten some solves in the 5 minute range,  but I&#x27;m not sure if it is <br>
as fast.  Personally I like solving the corners piece by piece <br>
because even though it may be more algs (1 or 2 more on average per <br>
solve) I can think through them quicker since I can group the pieces <br>
on each face in useful ways rather than having to do weird cycles <br>
like (UBL to UFR to DFL) which take 4 setup moves to do and undo at <br>
the ends.<br>
<br>
What does everyone else do?  How do you guys who solve via cycles <br>
get ___SO___ incredibly fast without messing up?  Does anyone else <br>
solve via &quot;piece-by-piece&quot; memorizing?<br>

would you be willing to tell us more about how you solve it? I think <br>
I use a similar system (at least I&#x27;m doing orientation and <br>
permutation at the same time (and I&#x27;m mostly doing 3-cycles, edges <br>
first, though that doesn&#x27;t matter much)), but your execution times <br>

This is not the advanced method - this is not even the intermediate

Those algorithms were from much earlier, less developed, versions.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Brent,<br>
<br>
can you describe more precisely what your problem is? Is it<br>
memorizing? Is it the setup-moves before and after an algorithm<br>
application? Is it 2-cycles? You could have a look at a simple method<br>
I made up and am exploring now:<br>
http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/blindsolving/3x3_single_alg/<br>
<br>
Not blindfolded I can solve the edges with this in a little more than<br>
a minute now. And it requires almost no thinking and very short and<br>
intuitive setup-moves (some of those I used there aren&#x27;t even<br>
optimal).<br>
<br>
It solves the edges one by one (in 2-cycles, not in 3-cycles). I<br>
intend to get used to this basic method until I can perfectly do it<br>
and then I&#x27;ll try introducing &quot;looking ahead&quot; in order to use 3-cycles<br>
whenever appropriate.<br>

one (by sight).  I had to get rid of the stickers and repaint mine 
before I could get anywhere, because two of the colors looked almost 
identical to me.  (But then again, I am very slightly color blind.)

It&#x27;s good to hear that there is someone else out there who tries to 
combine orientation and permutation.  For some reason, I tend to do 
the corners first, but that is just a preference.  In order to do 
the moves blindfolded in 1:15, I increased the amount of time spent 
in memorization, and planned everything out to a greater level of 
detail than normal.  Making certain that I could very quickly 
remember the order that I was going to place all of the pieces also 
helped.  Other than that, it was the same method that I always use.  

Like you, I do as much as possible by decomposing longer cycles into 
3-cycles.  Without knowing more about your methods, it&#x27;s hard to 
tell what would help you to improve.  I am guessing for example that 
when you permute 3 edge pieces, you make whatever setup moves that 
will put them into some standard set of positions, such as all in 
the top layer.  Once the repositioning is complete, you undo your 
setup moves.  The net effect of this &quot;setup&quot;, &quot;reposition&quot;, 
then &quot;undo the setup&quot; routine is that everything is unchanged, 
except for the three edges that were moved by the repositioning.  I 
work this way as well.  What follows is a guess as to how our 
methods differ.  

Most people use four or five algorithms when they do blindfold 
cubing.  I use a few more, and there is definitely a lot of 
redundancy.  Maybe I should just list them by function: (1) a 3-
cycle for edges that repositions UB, UF and DF, (2) another edge 3-
cycle that repositions the same three edges but flips UB and DF, (3) 
another edge 3-cycle for the same three edges that flips UB and UF, 
(4) another edge 3-cyle that repositions UL, UF and UR,  (5) another 
edge 3-cycle that repositions these same three top edges but flips 
UL and UF (and also the mirror image of the algorithm that flips UR 
and UF), (6) still another that repositions UL, DF and UR, and (7) 
still another that affects these same three edges but also does 
flips.  Because I know a large variety of edge routines, it takes 
fewer setup moves in order to prepare to reposition three edges, and 
this also reduces the number of setup moves that need to be undone 
after the repositioning.  Almost invariably one of my edge 
algorithms ends up being &quot;close by&quot; to whatever set of edges I need 
to reposition.  I also use at least four different routines for 
exchanging two pairs of edges.  

For some reason, I tend to use only one algorithm for repositioning 
three corners, but three different routines for repositioning two 
pairs of corners.  This isn&#x27;t necessarily as inefficient as it 
sounds.  This is because sometimes you can greatly reduce your setup 
moves by changing your frame of reference.  For example, let&#x27;s say 
that corners UFL, URF and DLF need to be recycled.  One way to do 
this would place DLF in the top layer with the other two before 
repositioning.  Another way would be to notice that they all are 
already in the front layer.  So just be rotating the entire cube, so 
that the front layer is temporarily on top, you can repostion them 
that way instead.  Which way you choose should be decided largely by 
how the corners are twisted.

Learning additional algorithms for permutting two pairs of corners 
can also help.  I regularly use: (1) repositions UFL and URF as a 
pair and also ULB and UBR as a pair,  (2) repositions pair UFL and 
and UBR and pair URF and ULB, and (3) repostions pair UFL and UBR 
and pair URF and DFR.  

And even though you are permutting and orienting at the same time, 
there are often edge cycles that contain only one flipped edge 
(which means that there is another edge cycle that contains a 
flipped edge).  And there are also corner cycles that contain 
twists.  (I bet you already knew this.)  You can forget about setup 
moves for putting the corners into standard positions before 
removing twists.  Just rotate the entire cube, remove your twists 
then rotate back to your normal position.  When you get down to it, 
two corners can only be (1) right next to each other, (2) opposite 
corners on the same face, or (3) totally opposite each other, such 
as UFL and DRB.  Once you can easily handle each of these, you can 
forget about setup moves for pairs of twists.  Because we both try 
to orient and permute at the same time, the number of corner twists 
to deal with is rarely more than three, and the number of edge flips 
is rarely more than four.  So learn routines to fix pairs of corner 
twists, and routines to fix triples of both clockwise and counter-
clockwise twisted corners.  Also learn a routine that flips four 
edges if you haven&#x27;t already.

For dealing with odd cube parity, I use one routine that swaps one 
pair of edges and one pair of corners, such as the URF and UBR 
corners along with the UF and UR edges.  But this one routine can be 
reflected right-to-left so that it works on UFL and ULB corners and 
UF and UL edges.  And both of these routines can also be reflected 
front-to-back, making two more parity fixing algorithms.  

That just about covers my memory blindfold method except for 
discussing the actual moves.  We can get into this in the future if 
you wish.  And someday soon we should start talking about seeing-eye 
(team) blindfold cubing.

I hope that this is understandable and that it helps.  Please let me 
know.

          <div class="email-content">Chris,

I&#x27;m guessing that you have spent a lot more time learning how to 
blindfold solve using your piece-by-piece method than you have spent 
using the cycle method.  Try and remember back to when you were 
learning how to do piece-by-piece.  I bet your results for piece-by-
piece back then are pretty similar to your cycle method results 
now.  I&#x27;m sure that switching over is tough, but I&#x27;m sure you can do 
it if you just hang in there for a while longer.

One way to decide whether cycle method is faster than piece-by-piece 
is to compare the number of moves needed to solve the same scramble 
by the two methods.  I bet you will find that cycle methods use 
fewer moves.  If this is correct, then assuming that you know both 
methods equally well, and can do the same number of moves per minute 
with both methods, then the method with the shorter number of moves 
will probably be faster.  I have to say &quot;probably&quot;, because this 
line of reasoning doesn&#x27;t take into account how much mental 
calculation is needed for either of these methods.  I suspect that 
there is less mental calculation for the cycle method as well.  On 
the other hand, cycle method&#x27;s calculations are relatively new to 
you, so don&#x27;t be surprised if you can&#x27;t do them as fast or as 
accurately right now.

By the way, it is possible to keep track of where each piece is 
located when solving by a cycle method.  But you don&#x27;t have to in 
order for cycle method to work.  On the other hand, if I am 
understanding your piece-by-piece method, you do have to keep track 
of where all of the pieces are in order for that method to work.  

I&#x27;m guessing that you are seeing the benefits of the cycle method 
more for edges because there are more of them, which makes them 
harder to keep track of (as compared to the corners) when using the 
piece-by-piece method.  Keep working at the cycle method on both 
edges and corners, and eventually you will probably drop your old 
method for both edges and corners.  On the other hand, if doing the 
edges by the new method and the corners by the old method helps you 
keep from getting too frustrated, that&#x27;s OK for a while longer.

I wish I had more advice concerning how to get faster and more 
accurate other than _practice_.  It all depends on what kind of 
mistakes you might be making, and I have no specific ideas 
concerning where you could be going wrong.  Come to think of it, 
whenever you &quot;miss&quot;, are you able to analyze how the cube is wrong, 
and determine from that what you did wrong?  If you can&#x27;t tell, then 
is there any way that you can film yourself making an attempt at a 
blindfold solve?  If you can, focus the camera so that it shows your 
hands, preferably from about the same angle that you would be 
watching if you weren&#x27;t blindfolded.  If you can watch the recording 
right after making an attempt, while you can still remember how you 
were planning to solve the cube, then you should be able to see when 
and how you went wrong.

Finally, fixing the parity problem is one of the hardest things to 
learn.  If you are having trouble finding the right setup moves to 
fix that last pair of corners and last pair of edges, why not trade 
those harder pairs for easier ones?  For example, let&#x27;s say that you 
realize that the last pair of corners are too tough to get into the 
top layer.  Why not swap two pairs of corners?  One pair would be 
the two corners that you are having trouble with.  The second pair 
would be your two favorite corners in the top layer.  So the net 
effect of this manuever is to fix the two bad corners while messing 
up two easy corners.  Did that make the problem easier?  If it did, 
great!  If it didn&#x27;t, then use the similar trick for edges to trade 
that hard pair of edges for your favorite pair of edges in the top 
layer.  This trick won&#x27;t result in you setting a new personal 
fastest time, but it does come in handy in times when you 
are &quot;stuck&quot; and can&#x27;t find the ideal setup moves.

thanks a lot for your extensive description. Indeed we use the same <br>

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s how I solve the cube blindfolded quickly:<br>
<br>
First off I see if there will be a parity error.  I quickly count off <br>
the corner cycles.  Corner cycles can be learned on stiff_hands&#x27; page <br>
if you don&#x27;t understand them.  Anyways after counting the cycles real <br>
fast you subtract 1 from each cycle and add the number together and <br>
just pray that it&#x27;s an even number.  Otherwise you have a parity <br>
error.  For me it&#x27;s easier to get rid of it from the start by just <br>
turning U at the beginning, but the only bad thing here is that you <br>
have to memorize the cube as if you had already turned U so it takes <br>
some mental strain to get it right. <br>
<br>
Anyways, then I do corner orientation which most people seem to be <br>
able to do.  Takes maybe 5 seconds to memorize because it&#x27;s so <br>
quick... do this phase by either taking a mental picture of what the <br>
corners look like (try associating a shape with it if it helps you.  <br>
Like, for example, if corner UBL has orientation 2 and UBR has <br>
orientation 1, I imagine a pull-up bar stretching between the two <br>
corners where the pole stabs through the U-face color. Eh, use <br>
whatever method you&#x27;d like).<br>
<br>
Memorization is really about your own preference.  I use my own <br>
methods of memorization so they may not work for you... anyways.<br>
<br>
For corner permutation I used to memorize number cycles but they grew <br>
cumbersome and slow.  It&#x27;s easier for me to just memorize where <br>
everything goes.  I often memorize a rollercoaster going from one <br>
corner to the next.  If the situation is difficult you can still see <br>
what the cycle would look like.  I *only* use 3-cycles. Here&#x27;s how it <br>
works:<br>
<br>
If your cycle is (xyz) then a three-cycle will solve it. To <br>
understand what three-cycle permute move you must use, you must think <br>
about which piece is where upon setup.  X moves to Y which moves to Z <br>
which moves to X, so you must know which corner permute will do so.  <br>
One moves corners clockwise and the other moves them counterclockwise.<br>
<br>
If your cycle is (vwxyz)or longer, then a three-cycle will reduce it <br>
to (vyz).  <br>
<br>
If your cycle has (wx)(yz) in it, then the easiest way for me to do <br>
this is to treat the first three corners as one cycle.  This means I <br>
will cycle (wxy).  By doing so, (wx)(yz) reduces to (wzy).  The <br>
second corner of the first cycle drops out, while the two corners in <br>
the second cycle switch places, and both of these initial cycles <br>
become one.  Or, you can use a four-corner swap move.  I&#x27;ve just <br>
found this way to be easy and consistent and you don&#x27;t need to <br>
memorize more algorithms if you have not already.  To each their own.<br>
<br>
As for edge orientation, this is really easy and can be memorized <br>
with a mental picture more often than not because often there is not <br>
much to orient, in my experiences.  At most, you have to memorize 6 <br>
edges.  Anything more and you&#x27;re working too hard.  If there are say, <br>
8 edges to orient, just memorize the 4 edges that are already <br>
oriented and screw those up, then do a Superflip move which can be <br>
found on many sites.  You memorize far less on this step than <br>
anything else so it should be fast.  <br>
<br>
To tell if a piece is oriented or not: First, mind you that at this <br>
point you can do *any* move you want, but if you are turning L or R, <br>
it MUST be L2 and R2.  No L, no L&#x27;, no R&#x27;, no R. The only exception <br>
to this rule is the actual permuting moves themselves. But in terms <br>
of setup, never do single turns of L or R.  Anyhow, you must think <br>
*if I were to move this edge around the cube any which way, would I <br>
be able to line its colors up with the centers?* For instance, let&#x27;s <br>
say an edge was blue and red.  If you brute-forced it into that <br>
position by using any moves (between the red and blue centers) would <br>
it line up nicely (blue center, blue edge, red edge, red center) or <br>
not (blue center, red edge, blue edge, red center).<br>
<br>
Edge permutation takes the longest to memorize and is the hardest to <br>
do correctly.  Taking a mental picture here is a bit hard but still <br>
works but memorizing number cycles here may be a bit easier. I do <br>
whatever moves will get the three edges I need to the U layer, then <br>
cycle them, then undo my setup move.  Again, make sure your setup <br>
moves do not involve single turns of L or R.  Also, three-cycling on <br>
any other face (except D) will mess up your orientation.  If you can <br>
help it, keep it to the U face.<br>
<br>
The cycles work the same way as corners in terms of how they are <br>
affected (xyz), (vwxyz), or (wx)(yz).  <br>
<br>
Eh hope this helps :P <br>

          <div class="email-content">Pedro,
When I do corners, almost all of the time I get three corners 
oriented properly on the same side using whatever setup moves are 
necessary, then I use that one 3 corner permutation.  If I am lucky, 
I won&#x27;t even use any of the algs for 2 pairs of corners.  In my 
previous post, I was merely telling everyone what I &quot;keep in my 
toolbox&quot;, without meaning to imply that I use all tools equally.  
Sorry for any confusion.  

I find that when you are open minded concerning which side you will 
use for cycling 3 corners, you rarely need more than two setup 
moves.  (This is my subjective experience.  I haven&#x27;t fully analyzed 
this to determine whether it is always true, yet.)  

By the way, I&#x27;m sure that you were able to get algorithms that are 
equivalent to mine from an optimizer, but you probably do not have 
my algs.  I am a throwback to an earlier time, and none of my algs 
were computer generated by me.  A couple come from booklets that 
were published at the height of the original cubing craze, and the 
rest were discovered by hand.  If anything, some of your algs may be 
quicker than mine.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

Although I didn&#x27;t time my memorization and planning for my 1:15 
solve, I&#x27;m guessing that it was no more than 10-15 minutes.  My 
normal solve times are typically from 4 to 6 minutes, memorization 
included.

Perhaps I should explain my reference to seeing-eye or team 
blindfold cubing.  At WC2003 in Toronto, I did a little demo of a 
blindfold trick during which I never see the cube at all and solve 
it blindfolded.  The trick started with the solver being blindfolded 
before the cube is scrambled.  Once the audience agreed that the 
cube was sufficiently scrambled, I had the emcee, acting as my 
assistant, pick one of the six cube colors.  Then as I pointed at 
various stickers, he responded &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; depending on whether it 
was his chosen color.  After a number of these questions, one side 
(but not one layer) was solved.  Next, he picked a second color, and 
we repeated the process.  The second phase ended when the second 
side was solved without disturbing the first side.  Then a third 
side was chosen and added to the completed sides and so on, until 
there weren&#x27;t any sides left to solve.  This describes the basic 
trick.  There are also serveral variations, including one where the 
assistant and the solver reverse roles.  The assistant is 
blindfolded, and the solver, (who isn&#x27;t allowed to touch the cube) 
tells the assistant which moves to make.

I am trying to understand your comment that &quot;the top guys seem to do 
it speed style, not blindfold style.&quot;  Of course, the top blindfold 
guys save a lot of time by doing their moves quickly.  But then 
again, the best speed cubists sometimes look away as they are 
finishing their last algorithm.  When I am at my best at 
speedcubing, (I&#x27;m not super fast, so I can&#x27;t claim to be an expert,) 
I am looking ahead, trying to determine my next moves while my hands 
are performing whatever algorithm was previously assigned to them, 
almost as if they have a mind of their own.  So I personally don&#x27;t 
see that big of a difference between blindfold and speed style 
cubing.  Perhaps, if you still see a significant difference between 
the two styles, you will post further on the subject.

Instead of imagining a piece moving around, you could also just find 
out whether its orientation matches that of the place where it 
currently is. I ordered my faces like this:
white,yellow &lt; orange,red &lt; green,blue
(ordered by brightness)
Now when I see the yellow/red piece in the green/orange place I 
immediately know that it has wrong orientation.

I believe you should be able to use your algorithm on F and B as 
well. And if you want to 3-cycle on L or R you just need to use 
another algorithm (one that flips the edges that move diagonally). 
Right?

Btw, what are your current record times? (I can&#x27;t find a kyuubree in 
the record lists...)

On my cube the three groups I mentioned in my ordering are opposite 
colors, i.e. white and yellow are opposite from each other. Let&#x27;s 
say I look at the green/orange place (i.e. the edge place between 
the green and orange centers). Note that order matters, i.e. 
green/orange is not the same as orange/green. Now if I see the 
yellow/red edge in that spot (again, order matters, not the same as 
red/yellow) then I know the edge needs to be oriented because 
green/orange is *against* my ordering (since green > orange) and 
yellow/red is *ok* for my ordering (since yellow &lt; red).

You could also look at it from the opposite direction, in that case 
you&#x27;d notice that in the orange/green place there&#x27;s the red/yellow 
edge.

In reality, I know which sticker of an edge should have the brighter 
color and if the edge that&#x27;s actually in that position has the 
darker color then that edge needs to be oriented.

Does that help better?

Stefan

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been working on developing my own simple approach to blindfold <br>
cubing, based on ideas from different places.  Basically, I don&#x27;t <br>
want to learn new algs and I have the worst time reversing setup <br>
moves successfully... Originally, I learned from Richard Carr&#x27;s .pdf <br>
file for beginners, applying algs I already knew to solve using his <br>
approach.  Now, I&#x27;m kind of adapting what I&#x27;ve learned from him and <br>
elsewhere (I know I read stiff hands&#x27; stuff at some point), and <br>
things I&#x27;ve figured out on my own, and putting an easier (in my <br>
opinion) spin on things.  Granted, this approach is not as fast as <br>
possible, but for those of us who are still just trying to get a <br>
second cube solved blindfolded, I think it&#x27;s a good approach.<br>
<br>
That lengthy intro aside, this is the first step to <br>
my &quot;simplification&quot; - how I go about corner orientation (CO).  I <br>
memorize orientations (for both corners and edges) as outlined in the <br>
aforementioned .pdf document (available at <br>
http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Richard/BlindfoldRevenge.pdf ), <br>
though I find it easier to remember as a sequence of 4 numbers (e.g. <br>
12, 11, 1, 21), instead of a string of 8.<br>
<br>
To do CO, first, orient as much of the F face as you can - in the <br>
example sequence I gave, UFR and DFL would need a clockwise (C) <br>
twist, and UFL would require a counterclockwise (CC) twist.  <br>
Therefore, I can twist UFL CC, and either UFR or DFL C, leaving the <br>
other still needing a C twist.  To twist a given corner:<br>
- Move it to UFR with a twist of F<br>
- Perform (R&#x27; U R U&#x27;)*2 to twist it CC or (U R&#x27; U&#x27; R)*2 to twist it C<br>
- Move it back to its original position with a twist of F<br>
<br>
Notice that you handle each piece individually, so there&#x27;s only one <br>
setup move to remember - though for speed you can compress successive <br>
turns of F, just putting the corners into UFR one after another, <br>
until all (except maybe 1) are complete.  As long as you twist 1 or 2 <br>
pairs of corners in opposite directions or exactly 3 in the same <br>
direction, it doesn&#x27;t matter what order you do them in.<br>
<br>
Next, do the same thing with the B face.  Again, in my example <br>
sequence, all B corners require a C twist, except DBR, which requires <br>
a CC twist.  To twist a given back corner:<br>
- Move it to UBR with a twist of B<br>
- Perform (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U)*2 to twist it C or (U&#x27; R U R&#x27;)*2 to twist it CC<br>
- Move it back to its original position with a twist of B<br>
<br>
Again, you just need to keep track of which corner you are orienting, <br>
and you know what setup move you need to reverse.  Once this is <br>
complete, there will be at most 2 corners that still need to be <br>
oriented - one on F and one on B.  For ease of remembering the setup <br>
moves, always do the same thing to bring the two corners into the <br>
same face:<br>
- Move B until the corners are diagonally opposite on the puzzle <br>
(such that they share no faces)<br>
- Do L2 or R2 to bring the B corner to F<br>
- Orient the corners as you would normally do on the F face<br>
- Reverse the L or R turn<br>
- Reverse the B turn<br>
<br>
I like this approach because it uses as most 2 setup moves for any <br>
situation and doesn&#x27;t require any cube rotations.  Also, the algs are <br>
short and easy (nicely triggered).<br>
<br>
What do yo think?<br>

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s indeed an easy way to do it and you probably win the prize <br>
for easy-and-fast. If you ignore the algorithm execution, there&#x27;s an <br>
even easier approach, though. One that truly only needs a single <br>
setup-<br>
move at most and that can handle *all* corners the exact same way, <br>
not splitting it up into F, B and a combination step. I used it in <br>
one of my approaches for Tom&#x27;s cube solver contest:<br>
http://tomas.rokicki.com/cubecontest/pochmann2.zip<br>
(look at the readme file)<br>
<br>
The approach uses this algorithm: (F&#x27; D2 F R&#x27; U2 R) * 2<br>
Btw, only now did I notice that the first and second half are <br>
identical, maybe I could&#x27;ve saved a few more bytes ;-). Also, I just <br>
noticed that at least (R&#x27; U2 R) is nice to execute as well and (F&#x27; <br>
D2 F) doesn&#x27;t seem so bad either.<br>
<br>
It rotates UFL and DBR and leaves the rest of the cube intact. So in <br>
order to orient all corners, bring one corner after the other to <br>
UFL, use the algorithm (or its inverse) to orient the corner and <br>
bring it back to where it came from. Do it for all seven corners <br>
(all but DBR). That&#x27;s it.<br>
<br>
Orienting edges is done similar, I also optimized for short setup-<br>
algs (because I hardcoded those) in order to save bytes ;-)<br>
<br>
And permutation of edges and corners is done similarly easy <br>
(although of course a bit differently), again optimized for short <br>
setup-sequences.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The move I do for corner orientaion:<br>
<br>
Put a corner of orientation 1 at UFR and a corner of orientation 2 at <br>
DFR and do: (F2 L F2 L&#x27;) (U2 R U&#x27; R&#x27; F2 R&#x27; F2) (R U&#x27;).  It&#x27;s pretty <br>
nice, very easy to execute and remember (just try it on the hands, <br>
it&#x27;s smooth).<br>
<br>
For edge orientation, when I say M I mean middle goes down, and M&#x27; <br>
means middle goes up: M&#x27; U M&#x27; U M&#x27; U2 M U M U M U2. *VERY EASY* It <br>
flips UB and UF.  I use this move and only this move.  If I have to <br>
flip, say, UF and UL, then I would do L&#x27; B&#x27; to put UL in the UB <br>
position, do the move, then do B L to put the edge back into place, <br>
correctly oriented.   <br>
<br>
Aside from that I only use a 3-corner permute and 3-edge permute <br>
which can be obtained from any cube site with PLL algorithms.  In all <br>
I use a total of four algorithms to solve the cube blindfolded.  <br>
However, I do use the move R D R&#x27; F D2 F&#x27; to bring a corner on the D <br>
layer *straight up* to the U layer without messing up orientation.  <br>
It&#x27;s an effective move for when you have two corners on the U layer <br>
and one on the D layer (or vice-versa), and all three of these need <br>
permuting. After permuting you just undo this move.  You&#x27;ll find that <br>
with such moves, &quot;setting up&quot; the pieces is very easy and requires <br>
little memory usage.<br>

What do you mean with &quot;without messing up orientation&quot;? It does mess <br>

most people I think) use.<br>
<br>
Can you check your algorithm? Your description of what it does <br>
sounds more like this one: L B D2 B&#x27; L&#x27;. It brings up DFL to ULF <br>
without messing up anything else on U. It&#x27;s also its own inverse, <br>
making it even easier to undo.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Okay, I&#x27;ll try to explain again. I made this method up, and I 
figured that someone had already used it before. But it sounds like 
not many people do.

Basically, I bring edges number 1-4 to the top, because that is 
where they need to go. Then edges 5-12 are all already in the bottom 
two layers. So now, I bring the edges number 9-12 to the bottom, 
because that&#x27;s where they need to go. So edges 1-4 are all in the 
top layer, but incorrectly permuted. Edges 5-8 are all in the middle 
layer, but incorrectly permuted. And that means that the last layer 
has all of it&#x27;s edges, but incorrectly permuted. Then, I just use 
the 3-edge cycle to solve each layer in turn.

I hope that made sense..

But Kyuubree, that advice helped me quite a bit. Now I know how to 
do it, but I just need to work on remembering it.
Thanks!

Yeah, well... Any two opposite faces, right? Anyways, I&#x27;m just <br>
curious to know which faces people use.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes it has to be two opposite faces. In the example I used, let&#x27;s say <br>
your doubleturn faces were B and L.  You could still mess up the FR <br>
edge in the middle layer.  So yes they have to be opposite faces.  I <br>
use L and R.<br>

Chris, which method did you decide on using? I started by doing it 
piece-by-piece, but that was too hard. I could figure it out 
eventually, but I can&#x27;t keep updating the permutation in my mind 
without losing something.
I&#x27;ve finally figured out how cycles work, but there must be something 
wrong with how I&#x27;m doing it. The cycles are always really long. For 
example, my cube sits in front of me right now with edge permutation 
like this:
(1,7,5,11,2,12,10,9)(3)(4)(6,7)
Obviously the last couple are easy to sort out, but only because all 
the other pieces are in the first cycle. I have trouble believing 
that people memorize and do that whole big long thing.

tremendously easier now. I can permute the edges every time now. But

          <div class="email-content">I did end up sticking with cycles.  Switching the edge permutations 
step over to cycles actually cut that step in half for me in terms 
of number of moves so I took to it pretty fast.  I did mess around 
with still doing the corners piece-by-piece but I gave that up 
because cycles is faster (for me at least).  I&#x27;m still practicing 
2x2x2 blindfolded a LOT to get used to the corners step for 3x3x3 as 
I still mess up on it sometimes.

Also here are my tips for the sequence,
(1,7,5,11,2,12,10,9)(3)(4)(6,7)  &lt;--- do you mean (6,8) here? You 
have 7 used twice.

I still remember the cycles as cycles, but I use the cube as a tool 
to help me spacially remember them.  To memorize that longer cycle I 
would associate the number &quot;1&quot; to edge at UB and &quot;7&quot; to the edge at 
UL etc..  So for each number in the cycle I give it a spacial 
location on the cube when memorizing.  That isn&#x27;t actually the piece 
that is in that spot, I just memorize better spacially then with 
numbers so I give my cycles a spacial representation.

Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;d do that cycle.  My numbering might be different from 
you guys (I didn&#x27;t learn either of the internet methods).  My 
numbering of the cube, 1,2,3,4,5,...,12 goes (in the same order) 
UB,UL,UR,UF,DB,DL,DR,DF,FL,FR,BL,BR so if I saw (1,7,5,11,2,12,10,9) 
I would first do (12,10,9) since those are all in the middle layer.  
After that none of the other numbers are all in the same layer, so 
I&#x27;d just read left to right doing the cycles until I got down to the 
last two.

I try to always find a cycle within larger cycles that are all in 
the same layer, or have very few setup moves to get that way.

          <div class="email-content">Hey does anyone have any useful multiple corner flip algs?  I&#x27;m <br>
looking specifically for the 3 algs that flip 1) 3 corners; both <br>
possible cases of flipping 4 corners in one layer (assuming the <br>
other corners are all correctly flipped).<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m currently using R&#x27;U2RUR&#x27;UR and then correcting the edges for the <br>
first case and a similar move then correcting the edges for the <br>
other two cases.  I was wondering what others did for these cases.  <br>
<br>
Also does anyone have any useful algs that flip 4 edges?  I <br>
currently make FREQUENT use of (M&#x27;U)*4 which Dror Vomberg showed me <br>
at the WC.  Does anyone know of any other useful 4 edge flip algs?<br>

<br>
I use (M&#x27;U)*4 and some variations of it to flip edges... I actually <br>
figured this out from having previously learned (M&#x27;U)*3 M&#x27;U2 (M&#x27;U)*3 <br>
M&#x27; somewhere and realizing the usefulness of (M&#x27;U)*4 on its own.  <br>

<br>
Keep in mind what (M&#x27;U)*4 does - it flips UL, UB, DF, and DB.  <br>
Therefore, if you repeat the alg twice, with a turn of U and/or D in <br>
between repetitions, you can get some interesting/useful outcomes.  <br>
Let&#x27;s call the original alg A, where A = (M&#x27;U)*4.  Then:<br>
- A U A U&#x27;  = flip UB and UF<br>
- A U&#x27; A U  = flip UL and UR<br>
- A U2 A U2 = flip all U edges<br>
- A D A D&#x27;  = flip all D edges<br>
- A D&#x27; A D  = flip all D edges<br>
<br>
Using the U and D turns in different combinations, you have a lot of <br>
options to choose from - you can flip:<br>
- two opposite U edges<br>
- four D edges<br>
- two opposite U edges and four D edges<br>
- four U edges<br>
- four U and four D edges<br>
<br>
If you need to flip 7 or 8 of the U/D edges, flip all 8 edges easily <br>
with A U2 D A U2 D&#x27; - that is (M&#x27;U)*3 M&#x27;U&#x27;D (M&#x27;U)*3 M&#x27;U&#x27;D&#x27; - and then <br>
you have at most 2 pieces remaining that need to be flipped.  With 5 <br>
or 6 that need to flip (max 3 on either side), align U and D, so that <br>
A will leave at most one to flip on either side.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Grant already explained most of it so I&#x27;ll just leave my most <br>
important EO algs.<br>

2 edges (UF UB) - (M&#x27;U)(M&#x27;U)(M&#x27;U2)  (M U)(M U)(M U2)<br>
4 edges (U)- (M&#x27;U)x4 (MU)x4<br>

R&#x27;)<br>
<br>
<br>
For the corners orientation you can find those algs in an optimal <br>
solver program, but I just prefer using this simple algs to orient <br>
corners on the U layer:<br>
to rotate the UFR corner clockwise: (R F&#x27;R&#x27;F)x2<br>
conter-clockwise: (F&#x27;R F R&#x27;)x2<br>
you place a corner in the position, rotate it, place another doing a <br>
Ux tur, rotate it, and so on. works for all the 2/3/4 orientation <br>
groups of corners.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone.  So yeah, I just felt like posting some of the algs I <br>
use to see if anyone has any better ones, and also to see if anyone <br>
likes any of these.  I think it would be cool to continue this <br>
trading of algs that we seem to have started.<br>
<br>
Here are some useful corner flip algs I use a lot.<br>
<br>
flip three corners in U layer clockwise.  The corner that doesn&#x27;t <br>
flip is at UFR:<br>
(R&#x27;U2RUR&#x27;UR) U2 (L2U&#x27;F&#x27;BL2FB&#x27;U&#x27;L2)  The first flips the corners, the <br>
U2 moves them back to the correct spot, the last fixes the edges.  <br>
It is helpful to know all 8 reflections and/or inverses of this alg <br>
so that you don&#x27;t ever have to rotate the cube.<br>
<br>
Flip UFR clockwise, UFL counterclockwise, UBR counterclockwise, UBL <br>
clockwise:<br>
(R&#x27;U2RUR&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;UR) (F2U&#x27;LR&#x27;F2RL&#x27;U&#x27;F2)<br>
<br>
The first flips the corners, the second fixes the edges.<br>
<br>
Flip UFL clockwise, flip UBL counterclockwise:<br>
(LU2L&#x27;U&#x27;LU&#x27;L&#x27;) (R&#x27;U2RUR&#x27;UR)<br>
<br>
Also inverses and reflections are very useful for each.  The only <br>
thing I don&#x27;t like about my algs is that they are very long, but <br>
they do trigger extremely well.  Does anyone have any shorter algs, <br>
particularly for flipping three corners the same direction (whether <br>
or not it flips corners in the same layer doesn&#x27;t matter really).  <br>
Also what algs do you guys use for flipping 4 corners at once?  I <br>
have 2 (the above and it&#x27;s inverse) but the other 4 corner flip case <br>
I have to flip two pairs of 2 corners.<br>
<br>
The only other edge algs I can add that I use a lot are<br>
<br>
flip 4 edges in U layer<br>
R2 D&#x27; (R2M2) (M&#x27;U)*4 (R2M2) D R2<br>
<br>
and flip all edges in middle layer<br>
F D F D&#x27; (EF&#x27;)*4 D F&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27;<br>
or also F&#x27; M&#x27; L R&#x27; to get them all in the U layer flip them there, <br>
then undo the setup at the end.<br>
<br>
I think it&#x27;s cool that we&#x27;re sort of sharing als here.  I too think <br>
it would be cool to see what algs Dave uses.<br>

Hi Chris,

I don&#x27;t have much to offer for corner orientation algs.  I really 
only use one alg plus a multitude of inverses/reflections for all my 
CO needs.  It is terribly long (20 moves - really just a combo of 2 
Sunes) but very simple to adapt to any pair of corners on either U 
or D (or even L or R if convenient).


Edge Orientation:

Many people (myself included) seem to use:

 (M&#x27;U)*4 to flip UL, UB, DF, and DB

and of course (M&#x27;U&#x27;)*4 will flip UR, UB, DF, and DB


what MIGHT be new (at least I haven&#x27;t seen it posted as of yet)
to flip all four edges on the UP face try:

 (M&#x27;U)*4 (MU)*4

and, naturally, all four edges on DOWN becomes:
 (MD&#x27;)*4 (M&#x27;D&#x27;)*4

everything else I use has already been posted so I wont repeat.



BTW, to follow up on an older thread -

I used to do both Edge and Corner permutation piece by piece.
Thanks to the discussion on this site I have totally switched my EP 
to the cycle method - MUCH EASIER AND MUCH MUCH FASTER.  

I am still debating whether or not to switch my CP to cycle method.  
The fastest blindfolders all seem to use it which certainly argues 
in its favour.  But I can generally Permute all corners with just 
three algs doing it piece by piece (generally DOWN corners in 2 algs 
and a third for the UP corners).  I find that cycling the Corners 
also requires three steps for the most part so there doesn&#x27;t seem to 
be any savings in number of moves.  The CON about cycling is that I 
still sometimes mess-up my set-up moves while the PRO about cycling 
is that it pretty much removes thinking leading straight to 
execution.  The CON about piece by piece is that I have to figure 
out each move in advance but the PRO is that there are no set-up 
moves and the approach is very versatile and easy to execute once I 
have figured it out.  But thinking is very costly when the clock is 
ticking.  

So I have totally switched to cycling for edges (and have even 
cycled the edges on my revenge - what a trip that was) but I am 
still debating whether to continue corners piece by piece or switch 
to cycles.  I will definately practice the cycles a bit more to give 
them a fair chance.

Now that I have more free time I can rejoin the Sunday contest!

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been wondering lately about lucky cases in blindfold solving.  <br>
What should we consider &quot;too lucky&quot; for purposes of posting on the <br>
unofficial records page?  I think it needn&#x27;t be too serious since <br>
it&#x27;s all for fun, but maybe we could come up with some definition to <br>
follow. <br>
<br>
My first definition was: lucky case= any time I solved it ;).  It <br>
evolved from there(though that definition is still applicable!), but <br>
after nearly two years, I&#x27;m still not sure what&#x27;s &quot;too lucky,&quot; and <br>
what&#x27;s just &quot;fortunate,&quot; and how to account for different solving <br>
methods.  I took a few attempts at a definition over the last two <br>
years and sent those to speedcubing way back(when there weren&#x27;t many <br>
blindfold guys); what&#x27;s currently up there was an earlier <br>
contribution of mine, but now I&#x27;m not satisfied with it all.  Now <br>
that there are so many more blindfold solvers, we should have input <br>
from whomever wishes.  <br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s assume 4 basic stages(guys with other systems, sorry, you&#x27;ll <br>
have to weigh in; this still may apply, I&#x27;m not sure):<br>
<br>
1. Orienting corners<br>
2. Orienting edges<br>
3. Perming corners<br>
4. Perming edges<br>
<br>
Too keep it simple, I think it might be fair to say, for 1 &amp; 2, that <br>
those steps must not be skipped.  In other words, there must be at <br>
least 2 corners not oriented, and at least 2 edges not oriented.  If <br>
you&#x27;d also want to consider those two steps in combo, and for example <br>
exclude a case where there were two corners to orient, and two edges <br>
also, then we could do that too, but it may get complicated <br>
considering steps in combination- simple may be good.<br>
<br>
Step 3 is more confusing.  Should we just go by the total number of <br>
corners already correctly placed, or also account for their <br>
locations?  For example, if there were, say, 6 correctly placed, my <br>
experiences tells me that&#x27;s too rare.  But I think also a case where, <br>
say, all 4 U corners were correctly placed, but all 4 D corners were <br>
not, would also be too lucky.  So maybe, no more than 5 total corners <br>
correctly placed AND no more than 3 corners correctly placed on <br>
either U or D layers.  Or something like that ;).<br>
 <br>
Step 4 is also confusing.  Should we go by total number of edges <br>
already correctly placed, or also take into account their locations?  <br>
I suppose we can rule out a case where, say, all edges are already in <br>
their correct layers.  And also ones where 8 or more total edges are <br>
already correctly placed.  Beyond that, I&#x27;m not totally sure.   <br>
<br>
My idea is too keep it simple and lenient so we can have fun making <br>
fast times, at the same time not too lenient as to have ridiculous <br>
cases.   <br>
<br>
All input would be appreciated; maybe it&#x27;s too hard to come up with a <br>
definition for all systems, but it&#x27;s worth a shot.  Oh well, it&#x27;s all <br>
for fun anyhow.  <br>

Hi Chris,

I don&#x27;t have much to offer for corner orientation algs.  I really 
only use one alg plus a multitude of inverses/reflections for all my 
CO needs.  It is terribly long (20 moves - really just a combo of 2 
Sunes) but very simple to adapt to any pair of corners on either U 
or D (or even L or R if convenient).


Edge Orientation:

Many people (myself included) seem to use:

(M&#x27;U)*4 to flip UL, UB, DF, and DB

and of course (M&#x27;U&#x27;)*4 will flip UR, UB, DF, and DB


what MIGHT be new (at least I haven&#x27;t seen it posted as of yet)
to flip all four edges on the UP face try:

(M&#x27;U)*4 (MU)*4

and, naturally, all four edges on DOWN becomes:
(MD&#x27;)*4 (M&#x27;D&#x27;)*4

everything else I use has already been posted so I wont repeat.



BTW, to follow up on an older thread -

I used to do both Edge and Corner permutation piece by piece.
Thanks to the discussion on this site I have totally switched my EP 
to the cycle method - MUCH EASIER AND MUCH MUCH FASTER.  

I am still debating whether or not to switch my CP to cycle method.  
The fastest blindfolders all seem to use it which certainly argues 
in its favour.  But I can generally Permute all corners with just 
three algs doing it piece by piece (generally DOWN corners in 2 algs 
and a third for the UP corners).  I find that cycling the Corners 
also requires three steps for the most part so there doesn&#x27;t seem to 
be any savings in number of moves.  The CON about cycling is that I 
still sometimes mess-up my set-up moves while the PRO about cycling 
is that it pretty much removes thinking leading straight to 
execution.  The CON about piece by piece is that I have to figure 
out each move in advance but the PRO is that there are no set-up 
moves and the approach is very versatile and easy to execute once I 
have figured it out.  But thinking is very costly when the clock is 
ticking.  

So I have totally switched to cycling for edges (and have even 
cycled the edges on my revenge - what a trip that was) but I am 
still debating whether to continue corners piece by piece or switch 
to cycles.  I will definately practice the cycles a bit more to give 
them a fair chance.

Now that I have more free time I can rejoin the Sunday contest!

So which do we have?<br>
<br>
Corner permutations:<br>
R&#x27;FR&#x27;B2RF&#x27;R&#x27;B2R2 (basic + inverse)<br>
(L2 U) (B2 U&#x27;)*2 (L2 U) (B2 U B2 U&#x27;)<br>

<br>
Edge permutations:<br>
RU&#x27;RURURU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;R2 (+ inverse, mirrored F/B, inverted mirrored F/B. These<br>
algorithms are really great!!)<br>
MD2M&#x27;D2 (in any direction)<br>
M&#x27;UMU2M&#x27;UM (in any direction, useful if you can do an easy F/B setup move<br>
that flips edges!!)<br>
<br>
Edge orientations:<br>

(F&#x27; D2 F R&#x27; U2 R) * 2<br>
<br>
Basically you can do any two generator corner orientation (like RU2R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;<br>
or RU2R2U&#x27;R2U&#x27;R2U2R), then check which edges are cycled, then undo the edge<br>
cycle (see Edge permutations).<br>
For the corner orientations there are many neat tricks in case the total<br>
orientation of LL is not 0.<br>
<br>
What could we add to this list?<br>
<br>
One idea I got from blindfold solving to transfer to speedcubing is this:<br>
suppose you could do the orientations (edges/corners) both in one step, and<br>
the permutations (edges/corners) both in two steps. Then in 15 seconds<br>
preinspection you could memorize the orientations. After that you do the<br>
permutations. Total of 6 steps. That is better than the cross/F2L/OLL/PLL<br>
system with 7 steps.<br>
Another thing is this: without looking at the cross, just orient all edges.<br>
This is much easier than for blindfold because you can do F to flip 4 edges.<br>
I think the maximum depth for edge orientation is 7 moves. OK, now<br>
preinspect the cube to solve the cross using moves in the group<br>
(U,D,R,L,F2,B2). This would leave you a very easy F2L using only U, R and L<br>
moves. And it would leave you a LL with oriented edges. Try this a few times<br>
and then take an average not including the first step of orienting the<br>
edges. Mine was better than my normal average.<br>
Now if you could orient the edges very fast, and still be able to afterwards<br>
solve the cross fluently, then you could maybe even improve your times.<br>
This system can also be useful for one-handed cubing (many easy moves!!!)<br>
and for beginners who have trouble with OLL or F2L (only 8 corners case for<br>
OLL, no rotations or really hard cases for F2L).<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

I am not really an expert with BLD cubing, but maybe this helps a 
little bit. I recently began with memorizing the positions of the 
pieces in a diffenrent way. Not very long ago, I would memorize a 
string of digits, where each digit represents the position where 
that piece needs to go. I recently discovered that memorizing the 
cycles is much easier (I don&#x27;t know if everyone agrees on this by 
the way). If you already do this, this tip will be useless :). I 
think memorizing and solving the cycles has these advantages: 1. You 
can memorize the shapes of the cycles. This will support the digits 
in your mind. Once you memorize the cycles (and their shapes), the 
problems are also easier to visualise. 2. Finding the solution is 
easier, and keeping track of the positions of the pieces is less 
time consuming. You don&#x27;t have to swap digits in your mind. Instead, 
you swap pieces on the cube, and forget some digits in your mind. If 
you want to know more about this: 
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/angela.hayden/cube/cube_frontpage.html. 
There are also some topics about cycles vs. piece by piece in this 
Yahoo group.

Good luck,

Joël.

          <div class="email-content">Dr Carr&#x27;s method is the &#x27;piece by piece.&#x27; Basically it&#x27;s what it 
sounds like: you go piece by piece. I used to do the corners like 
that. I would get all the top layer corners on the top, and all the 
bottom layer corners on the bottom, then permute them in their own 
layers. And for the edges, Dr Carr says to put all the middle slice 
edges first and then get the top and bottom edges on the right faces.
For the corners it wasn&#x27;t a problem, but the edges was really 
difficult. Cycles are much easier to memorize, though I don&#x27;t know if 
they&#x27;re much faster.

You hold it so there&#x27;s a corner with orientation 2 in position UFR,

<br>
In case you cared to know for sure, you&#x27;re correct.  I had written <br>
this into a program a bit ago and this is from the output - # of edge <br>
orientation states at each depth:<br>
depth 0:    1    0.05%(solved)<br>
depth 1:    2    0.10%<br>
depth 2:   21    1.03%<br>

depth 6:  327   15.97%<br>
depth 7:   13    0.63%<br>
Total  : 2048<br>
<br>
After that, corners can be oriented in at most 7 more moves, though <br>
I&#x27;m sure us human solvers won&#x27;t always see the optimal solution when <br>
it&#x27;s 5-7 moves away.<br>

&gt; (UFL UFR)(UBR DBR)<br>
&gt; what do you do when you get this? I can do it in 2 different ways <br>
&gt; both requiring too many setup moves :&amp;#92;<br>
<br>
I would do:<br>
1) Permute UFL -&gt; UFR -&gt; UBR with (R B&#x27;) (R F2) (R&#x27; B R) F2 R2<br>
2) Permute UBR -&gt; UFL -&gt; DBR with [(R&#x27;B R B&#x27;)*3 U2]*2<br>
<br>
An explanation of this makes for a good transition into the next <br>
phase of the &quot;simple&quot; approach to blindfold cubing that I&#x27;ve been <br>
working on.  It&#x27;s not actually the second step (after orient corners, <br>
I orient edges), but it&#x27;s the next step that I&#x27;ve got down solidly.<br>
<br>
For this corner permutation approach, you need to know algs to <br>
permute corners on U - these are mine:<br>
UFL -&gt; UFR -&gt; UBR       = (R B&#x27;) (R F2) (R&#x27; B R) F2 R2<br>
UFL -&gt; UBR -&gt; UFR       = (R2 F2) (R&#x27; B&#x27;) (R F2) (R&#x27; B R&#x27;)<br>
UFL &lt;-&gt; UBL UFR &lt;-&gt; UBR = F (R B) (R&#x27; F&#x27; R) (L F) (L&#x27; B&#x27; L) F&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27;<br>
UFL &lt;-&gt; UBR UFR &lt;-&gt; UBL = (R L) U2 (R&#x27; L&#x27;) (F&#x27; B&#x27;) U2 (F B) U2<br>
<br>
Technically it&#x27;s not necessary to know algs for these, but it&#x27;s much <br>
quicker if you know them, and most cubists do, so it&#x27;s not a tough <br>
requirement.  Just remember that the last one is the same as swapping <br>
opposite edges (UF &lt;-&gt; UB UL &lt;-&gt;UR) with an extra U2 twist at the <br>
beginning or end.<br>
<br>
In addition to knowing those algs, there are two others (very simple <br>
and quick):<br>
Alg1 - UBR &lt;-&gt; DBR UFR &lt;-&gt; UBL = (R B&#x27; R&#x27; B) * 3<br>
Alg2 - UBR &lt;-&gt; DBR DFR &lt;-&gt; DBL = (R&#x27; B R B&#x27;) * 3<br>
<br>
Again... This approach is based on the idea of minimizing setup moves <br>
and necessary algorithms - by no means is this efficient in number of <br>
moves, but it is very comfortable to perform (at least in my opinion) <br>
and setup moves are logical and minimal.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s how it works... First, comes the memorization and manipulation <br>
of the state during solving.  Memorize the corners&#x27; using a cycle <br>
method - I apply the numbers 1-8 to UFR, UFL, UBR, UBL, DFR, DFL, DBR <br>
and DBL respectively.  Therefore, the cycle UFR -&gt; UFL -&gt; UBR would <br>
be 1-&gt;2-&gt;3 in my system, but the numbers you use are up to you.<br>
<br>
Once you have the corner permutation cycles all memorized, go through <br>
the cycles in order, sequentially solving and removing them from the <br>
list.  If you have a cycle that is 3 or longer, cycle the first 3, <br>
and remove the second and third from the cycle (e.g. 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5 <br>
becomes 1-&gt;4-&gt;5).  If it was exactly a cycle of three, it becomes a <br>
cycle of 1 (solved) and can be dropped.<br>
<br>
If the cycle is only 2, cycle them in order with the first from the <br>
next cycle.  Then, drop the second number from the 2 cycle and insert <br>
the first one after the first number in the second cycle.  For <br>
example, if you need to swap (UFL &lt;-&gt; UFR)(UBR &lt;-&gt; DBR) as suggested <br>
in the original post, cycle UFL-&gt;UFR-&gt;UBR, and you&#x27;ll be left with a <br>
3 cycle of UBR-&gt;UFL-&gt;DBR (UFR becomes solved, and UFL gets inserted <br>
in the second cycle after UBR).<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s the mental game involved - now on to the actual application.  <br>
If you need to cycle 3 corners or swap 2 pairs of corners on U, use a <br>
known alg.  Do the same for D, with a cube rotation before and after <br>
as setup and reversal.  When you want to cycle three corners where <br>
two are on U and the other on D, or vice versa, do this:<br>
1) Move the lone piece to UBR or DBR with a turn of the U or D face<br>
2) Move the &quot;first&quot; of the other two corners (the corner that stays <br>
on U or stays on D) directly above/below the lone piece with a turn <br>
of U or D<br>
3) Perform Alg1 (2 corners on D) or Alg2 (2 corners on U)<br>
4) Turn U or D to move the last corner directly above/below the lone <br>
piece<br>
5) Perform the same alg as in #4<br>
6) Put U and D back to original rotation<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s an example...  Let&#x27;s say you want to rotate UFR -&gt; UBL -&gt; DFL. <br>
Here are the steps as outlined above:<br>
1) Turn DFL to DBR with D2<br>
2) Turn UFR to UBR with U&#x27;<br>
3) Perform Alg2, which is (R&#x27; B R B&#x27;) * 3<br>
4) Turn UBL to UBR with U2 (reverse U&#x27; with U, then add U to put UBL <br>
at UBR - total turn is 1/2)<br>
5) Perform Alg2 - still (R&#x27; B R B&#x27;) * 3<br>
6) Turn U&#x27; and D2 to return U and D faces to original states.<br>
<br>
If you don&#x27;t know algs to permute corners on U, and don&#x27;t want to <br>
learn them, you can just turn a face to put 2 on U and 1 on D and <br>
then follow the same procedure...  If you get to the point that you <br>
have just one 2 cycle left, use your favorite PLL alg that swaps one <br>
corner pair and one edge pair.  If you don&#x27;t know one, learning one <br>
is better than the alternative, which would be to do U or U&#x27;, adjust <br>
your mental picture of edge and corner permutations, and finish it <br>
off from there...<br>

<br>
I am not really an experienced blindfold cuber, but I&#x27;ve done it a <br>
couple of times now. I have seen video&#x27;s of people doing it really <br>
fast... It takes me probably more than 5 minutes for solving (I did <br>
not time myself yet, my goal for now is to do it consistently, with <br>
high accuracy), but I have seen someone doing it in 30 seconds or <br>
something (Geatan Guimond for example, if I recall correctly). So I <br>

          <div class="email-content">Two more ideas:

1) Setup algorithm (D&#x27; L2 D L2), Permutation algorithm (R B&#x27; R&#x27; B)*3.

2) Swap (UFL,URF) and (UF,UB) using your PLL alg for this case. Then 
use setup algorithm (U2 R2) with your PLL alg again. I.e. let&#x27;s call 
your PLL alg &quot;A&quot;, then do (A U2 R2 A R2 U2)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">For Jim Mittan style (had a 1:15 recently 
(http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/overall.html) plus some time for 
memorization/planning) read his recent posts in this group 
(he&#x27;s &quot;blindfoldcubist&quot;). He&#x27;s doing permutation and orientation 
together and knows many algorithms and even applies them on 
different sides of the cube.

For Gaetan Guimond style (and also probably Bertrand Bertage 
(http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_dext.html#3x3mostmoves) if 
you ask me they&#x27;re the same person) I think you just have to 
practice solving from one known start state or memorize/plan ahead 
very long.

Can you tell us what these 13 states are?<br>
<br>
&gt; After that, corners can be oriented in at most 7 more moves, <br>
though <br>
&gt; I&#x27;m sure us human solvers won&#x27;t always see the optimal solution <br>
when <br>
&gt; it&#x27;s 5-7 moves away.<br>

I agree, all these algs are fast...  but I think, ...  the fastest way is just looking and planning ahead w/ nonstop, as ron says: &quot;just simply looking ahead makes a huge difference&quot;

&gt; four(4) horizontal middle slice(E, between U and D layers) are<br>
&gt; correctly positioned     <br>
<br>
I would have to agree that this defines a lucky case - several of <br>
those items on their own would actually define a very lucky case.  <br>
For example, having all corners oriented is a 1 in 2187 occurance, <br>
and having all edges oriented is almost as rare.  I realize you were <br>
trying to keep the definition simple and lenient, but I&#x27;m thinking <br>
these may be a bit too lenient.<br>
<br>
I almost never have more than 2 corners already oriented when I <br>
start, with somewhere in the range of 4-8 edges flipped.  I don&#x27;t <br>
think I&#x27;ve ever had more than 1 corner or 2 edges pre-placed.  I&#x27;d <br>
suggest this version - slightly revised - still considering a case <br>
lucky if one or more are satisfied:<br>
1. More than 4 corners are correctly oriented<br>
2. More than 8 edges are correctly oriented<br>
3. More than 2 corners are correctly positioned<br>
4. More than 3 edges are correctly positioned<br>
<br>
This also eliminates the need for special wording of having all edges <br>
in a particular slice pre-positioned, because of the total number <br>
that can be pre-positioned.  Does this seem reasonable?  It could <br>
just be that I haven&#x27;t solved enough cubes blindfolded to realize the <br>
frequency with which these things can happen... Just my thoughts.<br>

Hmm... I sent a response to this yesterday, and it doesn&#x27;t appear to <br>

<br>
Not surprisingly, the 13 states are superflip along with 12 states <br>

2-5) UF or DF and BL or BR<br>
6-9) UB or DB and FL or FR<br>
10-13) Two edges across F or B from each other (e.g. FR and FL or UB <br>

Here&#x27;s a list of the edges flipped (and not flipped) in each of the <br>
13 states:<br>
1) UF UB UR UL DF DB DR DL FR FL BR BL (All Flipped)<br>
2) UF UB UR UL DF DR DL FR FL BR (Not DB BL)<br>

If you can think like you think with numbers (for example, to know 
the changes when you perform a cycle to reduce a larger cycle) it 
does cut your time off. I only use numbers in EP because it&#x27;s harder 
to memorize visually. for CO I follow along a cycle with my finger 
(it helps) once and memorize the image. For CO I decompose both faces 
in a 2/3/4 &quot;orientation cycle&quot; say the name of it (I have names for 
them). For EO I also use my fingers and I just imagine a cube with 
darker badly oriented edges. I always memorize the cube in less than 
a minute

By the way, I would like to know the partial times for the other 
blindfolders of the forum, to know wich phase I need to improve the 
most. I&#x27;ve taken an averadge of 5 solves: 
-memorization ~ 50secs
-CO ~ 30 secs
-EO ~ 45 secs
-CP ~ 55 secs
-EP ~ 60 secs

I include parity in EP.
This aproximatly adds up to my latest avg (4min 8s)

          <div class="email-content">I can get times at around 3-4 minutes now on average, and I do not 
use numbers; I memorize a path with my finger, as stated by the 
previous poster, for everything.  It is a bit tough for edge 
permutation, which takes the longest, but alas:

Corner orientation: 10 seconds
Corner permutation: 25 seconds
Edge orientation: 10 seconds
Edge permutation: 45 seconds to a minute
Solving: Depends but generally 2-3 minutes
Parity Error: Add like 45 seconds, lol.  I still suck with these.

          <div class="email-content">I just had an interesting thought about this. If we don&#x27;t count &quot;too 
lucky&quot; solves, can we discard &quot;too unlucky&quot; solves as well? For 
speedsolving the 3x3 this doesn&#x27;t make much sense since the worst 
case (e.g. 7 steps for Fridrich) is what we expect anyway. But for 
blindfold it does. If we say &quot;10 or more correct&quot; (talking about 
orientation only!) is too lucky then we could say &quot;10 or more wrong&quot; 
is too unlucky. Of course this has the flaw that &quot;12 wrong&quot; seems to 
be bad as hell but you only need one algorithm for it and more 
generally people are using the superflip already if many edges are 
wrong so for them &quot;10 or more wrong&quot; is actually a lucky case.

Also, if you orient and permute at the same time (maybe I should 
just talk about permuting the stickers) then you can&#x27;t count 
correct/wrong orientations of cubies at all, only of cycles. And 
since there usually aren&#x27;t many cycles all situations appear quite 
often. For example, if I have three edge-cycles, then the situations 
and their probabilities are:

- 0 wrong: 1/4 cases
- 2 wrong: 3/4 cases
- 1 or 3 wrong: impossible

Even with four cycles this doesn&#x27;t get much better:

- 0 wrong: 1/8 cases
- 2 wrong: 6/8 cases
- 4 wrong: 1/8
- 1 or 3 wrong: impossible

Everything is still above 10%.

the &quot;too unlucky&quot; solves will only influence an avg not a single 
solve record, and acording to speedcubing.com new avg rules lucky 
(and unlucky) cases shouldn&#x27;t be discarded.
10/12 edges flipped is indeed lucky.
Besides, a &quot;lucky&quot; thing is something that rarely happens, not just 
easier, so if permuting and orienting makes you have more &quot;luck&quot;, 
perhaps the method is better :)
I think &lt;5% is a better limit. I don&#x27;t really know how to calculate 
the odds though

          <div class="email-content">Well if you have the pathway of the permutation memorized then it 
isn&#x27;t difficult to figure out which ones you have permuted and which 
ones you have not.  You just cycle the first then, then cycle the 
*next* two with the first edge in the sequence, etc.

someone has, but here are the odds again for numbers of edges 
flipped.  All you have to do is count the number of positions of 
each type and divide by the number of total positions.

Odds:

no edges flipped: 1 position in 2048 ~ 0.049%
2 edges flipped: 66 positions in 2048 ~ 3.22%
4 edges flipped: 495 positions in 2048 ~ 24.17%
6 edges flipped: 924 positions in 2048 ~ 45.12%
8 edges flipped: 495 positions in 2048 ~ 24.17%
10 edges flipped: 66 positions in 2048 ~ 3.22%
12 edges flipped (superflip): 1 position in 2048 ~ 0.049%

          <div class="email-content">Yeah I do memorize both the corner and edge perms without numbers, 
and just by where they go.

Here&#x27;s what I mean by shapes.  One shape I see a lot sort of looks 
like a bowtie.  (UL -> DR -> DL -> UR) is a &quot;bow-tie&quot;.  Also you can 
have a similar type of shape using the middle layers.  So (UB -> FL -
> FR -> UL) is also a &quot;bow-tie&quot;.  When I see a shape that comes up a 
lot I don&#x27;t say, hey there&#x27;s a bowtie, I just recognize the cycle, 
then I also think that it looks like that bowtie shape.  That allows 
me to reinforce those pieces.  So if I forget the cycle, I can 
remember that those 4 pieces are in a &quot;bowtie&quot; so I can figure out 
the cycle again if I forgot it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody, <br>
<br>
I am just back from business trip. <br>
Since a few months ago, I have been working on this. <br>
I do shadow-solving for all EP and CP. <br>
Starting from D cross. <br>
I also put middle edges in middle layer simultaneously as possible. <br>
In case of parity, I leave it on U. <br>
<br>
For CP, I use the following algorithms. <br>
Those are all derived from famous 2-corners-swapping. <br>
L2-(L&#x27;BLB&#x27;)x3-(FR&#x27;F&#x27;R)x3-L2<br>
L2-(RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)x3-(R&#x27;BRB&#x27;)x3-L2<br>
L2-(RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)x3-L2 (+variations)<br>
<br>
You can swap 2-corner-pairs between U and D. <br>
Plus 3-cycles, you can replace all U-corners on U or (D). <br>
(You need to check parities which you should choose. )<br>
That means three permutions is sufficient to remember for corners. <br>
<br>
In case you had three D-corners on U, you can put all D-corners on U. <br>
Then, replace all corners on the other side of corners where the <br>
cubbies to be. (Do you understand?) <br>
And then swap all 8 corners between U and D.<br>
(RB&#x27;R&#x27;B)x3-(LF&#x27;L&#x27;F)x3-(L&#x27;BLB&#x27;)x3-(FR&#x27;F&#x27;R)x3<br>
<br>
My success rate and time is getting better and better. <br>
During the flights, I practiced a lot. <br>
I hit 4 consecutive completions<br>
 and I also hit 8 completions out of 10 attempts on another day. <br>
Time was approximately 5-8 min. <br>
<br>
Masayuki Akimoto<br>
<br>
P.S. If I keep cube in my hands, that helps a lot for memorizing EOs. <br>
So it is better to define leaving cube on table before starting as we <br>
do for speed. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Thanks, I was just glad to have done it successfully.  I was very 
much inspired by the nearly sub-minute times for division II 
attempts that we&#x27;ve seen on the Sunday blindfold contest, and mainly 
by Gaetan Guimond&#x27;s TV appearances where he solves the cube behind 
his back in very short times.

I posted some of my process for how I did this at the 
speedsolvingrubikscube group if anyone is interested in my method 
for doing this.  I think it would be possible to get times at around 
an hour with a lot of practice.

I have a video of it on my computer but it is a huge file.  Once I 
can shrink it down I will put it on my website.

Hope to see some others try this, the anticipation when you pick up 
the cube and get ready to actually do the solve is intense!  It is 
definitely a fun thing to try :)

Chris,

18.65 on a blindfold solve!!!
That really is a FANTASTIC achievement.  

My deepest respect for your concentration and meticulous working out 
of EVERY detail.  Thanks for the detailed how-to info on the regular 
speed group but I really can&#x27;t imagine myself being able to figure-
out an entire Friedrich solution in my head.  That is AWESOME.  Well-
done!!!!

Rob

<br>
There was a lot of participation for the Sunday blindfold contest <br>
this week, which is awesome!<br>
<br>
Feel free to check out the results, and remember to compete in next <br>
week&#x27;s contest!<br>
<br>
Remember, Division I and Division II solves are due by the Wednesday <br>
after scrambles are posted.  Any open division solves you choose to <br>
do aren&#x27;t due until the Friday after the contest starts.<br>
<br>
Thanks for those who competed in this week&#x27;s contest, and everyone <br>
remember to compete next week!  It&#x27;s fun!<br>

<br>
My cube that i have been using for blindfold cubing is about 20 years <br>
old, never been lubricated, and is starting to pop way too often.  <br>
Has anyone got any suggestions on what kind of cube i should get?  I <br>
would preferably be looking for one with the same colour scheme as i <br>
currently have: (U,D,R,L,F,B) = (White, Blue, Red, Orange, Green, <br>

Hi Chris,


Yesterday, I found an algorithm that flips six edges by 
coincidence :). I don&#x27;t know if this is new. It&#x27;s a bit long, but I 
think it can be done very fast:

(R B R&#x27; U) * 5.

I do it like this: (l U l&#x27; U) * 5, moving the L and M layers/slices 
with my left hand, and doing the U move with my (right hand) index 
finger. The alg will flip all edges in U layer + the BL and BD 
edges. I hope it&#x27;s usefull.

Hi fellowz,<br>
Someone (Mike Atkinson for one) mentioned that they used to put all the last layer pieces on the bottom, and the middle layer pieces in the middle layer, and all the top layer pieces into the top layer, and _then_ permuted....  If someone knows the slightest info of this, let me know asap ;) thx<br>

I do this a new way now but it&#x27;s pretty much the same idea.<br>
<br>
I would do F&#x27; L&#x27; F (EL&#x27;)*4 F&#x27; L F<br>
<br>
In practice I do, y&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R y (E&#x27;L&#x27;)*4 (F&#x27;LF) with the parenthesis <br>
meaning normal finger tricks.<br>
<br>
I also am working on z&#x27; (B&#x27;UB) (M&#x27;U)*4 (B&#x27;U&#x27;B) z or something <br>
similar since the M moves go so much faster for me than E moves.<br>
<br>
It only saves one move, but I like it since it is slightly shorter.<br>

blindfolded? I&#x27;m sure someone could do it. All you&#x27;d have to do is <br>
find simple steps after forming the cube. The only really difficult <br>
part would be forming the cube, but with enough work, solving it by <br>

ever looking at it, so remembering and transforming the permutations <br>
of the pieces could be done. Stefan Pochman solved the Megaminx <br>
blindfolded, and people solve the 5x5x5,4x4x4,3x3x3, and 2x2x2 in <br>
one go, so theoretically, someone out there could be able to solve <br>

That sounds fairly ambitious. For the combo, maybe 12-15 hours 
memorizing and solving? :) Good luck at the European Championships,

Actually I hope it will be a lot shorter because that would be <br>
exhausting. The 2x2, 3x3, Pyraminx, Skewb and Clock won&#x27;t take much <br>
time and the others aren&#x27;t that bad either. I just tried to list the <br>

I have never seen this idea before, but it was quite useful for me who is still trying to master blindfold cubing.<br>
<br>
I scrambeled my cube as I allways do and then I solved just one layer looking at the cube. After that I memorized, blindfolded and solved the other two layers.  This is quite different from doing only corners or only edges because now I have to use all steps in my solution, and its not possible to cheat with parity as you can do when doing only corners or edges. Also I got to see a solved cube once I took of my blindfold, a much nicer sight then just solved edges.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
So yeah I got pretty slack about practicing blindfolded solving <br>
after the US championship, but now I&#x27;m really starting to focus a <br>
lot of my practice time on BLD solving again.<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;ve done a lot of thinking about memorizing and solving <br>
order, and just since this board has been quiet for a while I <br>
figured I would post what I found.<br>
<br>
I used to memorize in the order EO -&gt; CO -&gt; EP -&gt; CP  <br>
(E=edge,C=corner,P=permutation,O=orientation)<br>
<br>
Then I would solve in the order EO -&gt; CO -&gt; EP -&gt; CP<br>
<br>
I used to average about 6-10 minutes using that technique.  Recently <br>
I&#x27;ve been messing around with this order:<br>
Memorize: CP -&gt; CO -&gt; EP -&gt; EO<br>
Solve: EO -&gt; EP -&gt; CO -&gt; CP<br>
<br>
Some advantages and disadvantages of this I&#x27;ve seen are:<br>
<br>
Pros: You can just take a quick mental snapshot of the edge <br>
orientation during the memorizing, since it is the last step to <br>
memorize and the first step to solve.  You do not have to have a <br>
very clear picture of this, so just glance at it then put on the <br>
blindfold.<br>
<br>
You solve in the reverse order that you memorized, so when solving <br>
the edge permutation, you have just recently memorized it and it is <br>
therefore still fresh in your mind.  It being the biggest <br>
permutation step I feel it is best to get it over with at the <br>
beginning of the solve so that you don&#x27;t have to hold on to that <br>
much information while solving the corners.<br>
<br>
Cons: You have to make sure to memorize the corner permutation and <br>
orientations very well, since the edges act to interfere with the <br>
corner information so much.  You can skim through the edge cycles, <br>
since you will solve them first anyway, but you have to really make <br>
sure to cement the corner cycles in your mind before moving on to <br>
memorizing the edges.<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
Anyway having said that I now average about 4-5 minutes (2-5 minutes <br>
faster on average) and I&#x27;ve only just recently started practicing <br>
this order.  Also my success rate has gone up significantly.<br>
<br>
Anyway I don&#x27;t know if order of memorizing and solving has been <br>
discussed before, but I figured I would bring it up.  I&#x27;ve never <br>
read Olly&#x27;s or Richard&#x27;s tutorials, so those of you who learned that <br>
way I don&#x27;t know what orders you use.  Also those of you who figured <br>
out your own systems I don&#x27;t know either.<br>
<br>
Anyway just figured I would try to start a discussion about order <br>
for the steps.  There are 24^2=576 possible orders to memorize and <br>
to solve the cube using the 4 step method.  I figure one or a few of <br>
them have to be better than most of the others.  This is my stab at <br>
trying to find a better order.<br>

Personally I always start memorizing with the corner
permutation -- this will quickly tell me if I am
dealing with parity or not.  If not then my corner
perm is memorized.  If so I look to see what quarter
turn is most expeditious: U, U&#x27;, D, or D&#x27; and then
memorize the new corner perm as if that move had
already been executed.  

After corner perm I then move on to edge perm because
that is the longest but at least I never need to worry
about parity in this step. 

I then memorize both orientations by just looking at
the white/yellow stickers (and green/blue for midges).



For solving I tend to execute CO, EO, CP, EP.  No real
reason for it I just do it that way.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Rob and Chris, <br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t blidfolded solve much recently. <br>
But I realy want to do after I read Rob&#x27;s post. <br>
<br>
I normally memorize EP &gt; CP &gt; EO &gt; CO<br>
Solve EO &gt; CO &gt; EP &gt;CP + parity if present. <br>
<br>
I think I hear this from Macky, probably but he may solve in <br>
different way. <br>
Although I can recoginze parity when I memorize EP, I often spend a <br>
lot of time to fix parity if it is present. <br>
It is because I don&#x27;t know PLL. <br>
When I had parity, if I could set edges to be solved just by U or U&#x27;, <br>
I always felt lucky because I can forget the exact position of edges. <br>
I don&#x27;t intend to do so. It happens by chance. <br>
Anyway, I am not comfortable with parities. <br>
<br>
So I like Rob&#x27;s idea, that staring CP and canceling parity by simple <br>
turn if it is present. And I really would like to try this for the <br>
next time. <br>
<br>
Since the number of edegs are more than corners, to memorize EP is <br>
more difficult to memorize CP. So I used to start from memorizing EP. <br>
But parity is more important. <br>
<br>
I personally, don&#x27;t want to keep memory of orientations for long. <br>
I quickly memorize EO and CO (for EO I normally put my fingers on to <br>
the edges to be fixed), and solve them first quickly, and then forcus <br>
on EP and CP slowly. <br>
I don&#x27;t care too much for the order of solving EO and CO. <br>

<br>
<br>
P.S. I have been trying to set average for blindfolded solving 3x3x3 <br>
in the same rule as for speed, but I haven&#x27;t succeeded yet. To <br>
achieve this, really high success rate is required. I see Macky and <br>
Chris on the list for 2x2x2. Did anybody try this? <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

since the Dutch Cube Day is not far away, I decided to blindsolve the 
3x3 each day and have done so three days in a row now (yaeh ;-).

I do both memo and solve as EP EO CP CO. Cubies in correct position 
but with wrong orientation still give me trouble, but I hope this will 
get better with more practice. Since I&#x27;m lazy I memorize them as 
orientation, but I want to switch to pure permutation, at least for 
memorization. EO I usually do with permutation algs and CO with 
orientation algs.

Cheers!
Stefan

one video where he was on TV and handed the cube to the announcer <br>

successfully too, which was the amazing part.  So even if he <br>
memorized the entire speed solve solution, he still would have only <br>

Hi Masayuki,

Cancelling parity at the beginning really does make
things a lot easier for solving by cycles.  When I
started blindfolding I always solved piece by piece. 
Parity didn&#x27;t really bother me for that techique but
it maks a huge difference when you solve by cycles. 
The memorization becomes a little more difficult
because you have to memorize the cycles not of the
cube as you hold it but of the cube as you hold it
with one quarter turn.  Because any quarter turn of U
or D will cancel the parity I try to turn the
necessity into a virtue and use the quarter turn to
put at least one corner in the correct position as
well.  Thus instead of always just (mentally) doing U
and then memorizing whenever I get parity I see if
doing U&#x27; or D or D&#x27; will solve parity AND give me a
correct corner.

It is a simple technique which works quite well, but
don&#x27;t give me the credit for it.  I first read about
it in a posting that Stephan made several months ago.

I would like to try an average 10 of 12 blindsolves -
it sounds like fun and a real test of sustained focus
but right now time is too short and I have little time
for blindsolves or much cubing of any kind.  Hopefully
things will ease up because I have lots of unfinished
cube business to take care of.

For piece by piece I used to &#x27;label&#x27; the corners 1 - 8
starting from UFR and ending with DBL.  Then I would
memorize the whole cube.  To solve I would first place
#8, then #7 then #6 etc... i.e. I would only solve one
piece at a time - it is very inefficient.  Furthermore
you need to update your mental image of the unsolved
cube very frequently which can become a little tricky
especially when dealing with 3-cycles of edges.

Hope this makes sense.

I find that solving permutation by cycles is much
easier to memorize, much more efficient in the solve
and requires much less updating of the mental image f
the cube than piece by piece style.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Rob,

thanks for the explanation, that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been wondering about 
for quite some time. My conclusion is that the name &quot;piece by piece&quot; 
for that method is just terribly misleading. The emphasis should be on 
the fixed order in which you solve the pieces. I mean, you&#x27;re probably 
solving piece by piece as well (ok, you&#x27;re probably doing two at a 
time), the real difference is only that you walk along the cycles 
instead of a fixed order.

Cheers!

Hey everyone,

I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of thinking about this lately, and wanted to 
bring up and old topic.

I&#x27;ve been looking a lot into memorizing and solving orders for 3x3 
blindfolded solving, and I think I&#x27;ve come up with a pretty good 
order.

I used to memorize EO CO EP CP then solve EO CO EP CP

Then I switched to memorizing as CP CO EP EO then solving as EO EP 
CO CP and my average dropped by  a couple minutes on average.  I 
posted about this order a while ago, and how I thought it was an 
improvement over my first order.

Just recently I switched to memorizing as EP EO CP CO then solving 
as CO CP EO EP and my average has again dropped by a couple minutes 
on average.

Here&#x27;s my thinking for why this new order works well.

The edges are clearly the hardest part of a blindfolded solve 
(orientation and permutation) since there are 12 pieces instead of 
8.  So my strategy now is to memorize them first, so that I have 
more time to try to plan what I will do for the edges while doing 
other steps.  While memorizing the edge cycles, I&#x27;m trying to decode 
the first one or two permutations that I will do.  For the 
orientation I try to do the same for any setup moves necessary to 
get the pieces into an arrangement I know how to flip.

Then I memorize the corners last, since they are the easiest.  This 
lets you spend very little time on the actual memorization.  It is 
the first step you will solve too, so you don&#x27;t have to memorize 
them well.  You can just get it barely into your short term memory, 
put on the blindfold quickly, and start solving.

Finally, while finishing the last algorithm of the corner 
permutation step, I recall my planning from the edges memorizing to 
remember what my setup moves are for the edge orientation, and what 
my first one or two permutations will be to start the cycles.

Anyway there are 24 ways to memorize, and 24 ways to solve, and I 
truely believe that a select few of the total 576 memorizing and 
solving combinations are significantly better than the others based 
on the way the human brain memorizes a large amount of information 
quickly, as well as the idea of memorizing interference.

Anyway, after playing around with a few different orders I 
personally like memorizing EP EO CP CO then solving in reverse.

If anyone is interested in trying new memorizing and solving orders, 
I personally am very happy with the one above.  I think this order 
is a good candidate out of the total 576 for one of the better 
orders, based on my personal experience.

I think we can reject 75% of the 576 different orders. I think that solving permutation before orientation would be really bad because then you would have to think about permutations when solving or memorizing orientations.

Personally I do EP, CP, EO, CO and then OC, OE followed by permutation in some way. I think I usually do CP first and then EP. Usually without thinking about setting up for I nice parityfix.

Assuming you always orient the pieces in an orbit before permuting 
them, then you only have 6 allowable solving orders.

Say you orient both right at the start, there are two ways to do 
that: either EO CO or CO EO, then from there you can solve in either 
order.

If you orient an orbit then solve it, then orient the other and 
solve it you can only do that 2 ways EO EP CO CP or CO CP EO EP

Thus, the only allowable solving orders are
EO CO EP CP
EO CO CP EP
CO EO EP CP
CO EO CP EP
CO CP EO EP
EO EP CO CP

There are still 24 ways to memorize though, so we&#x27;ve narrowed the 
576 cases down to 144, which you&#x27;re right is exactly 1/4.

I would personally throw out cases where you memorize the EP and CP 
right next to eachother, since the permutations can cause 
interference with eachother if memorized all at the same time with 
nothing in between to separate them.  I don&#x27;t memorize using numbers 
though, so maybe that is only a problem with my method.

Assuming you throw out cases where EP and CP are next to eachother 
in memorization there are only 12 ways to memorize, so the number of 
orders overall would be only 72.

I wish I knew more about the psychology and/or mechanics of 
memorization, but I really do think that maybe only 2,3 or 4 of 
those orders overall would be &quot;optimal&quot; so to speak.  I&#x27;m sure one 
of the optimal orders would be better for a person than others, but 
I think that maybe only a few would be fast for everyone.

To avoid interference when memorizing I like to make sure that I 
never memorize two orientation steps or two permutations steps in a 
row.  That way it is easier to separate them in your head and recall 
later, IMHO of course.

This would give only 8 memorizing orders, and with our 6 solving 
orders this would mean that we would have to look at 48 potential 
good orders.

Still that&#x27;s 1/12 of what we started with.

I don&#x27;t know maybe this doesn&#x27;t seem that interesting to everyone, 
but personally I think if we could isolate the orders that helped 
the most people be able to most easily memorize their cube then it 
would be easier to teach people to learn blindfolded solving.

Plus those interested in speed blindfolded solving (I assume most of 
us) would be able to use our brains to the best of our abilities, 
making sure things don&#x27;t overlap in ways to decrease solving 
percentage or speed of recollection.

&gt;Just recently I switched to memorizing as EP EO CP CO then solving<br>
&gt;as CO CP EO EP and my average has again dropped by a couple minutes<br>
&gt;on average. <br>
Hi Chris, <br>
<br>
If your average dropped a couple of minutes again and again, <br>
I wonder how fast you can blindsolve on average now. <br>
<br>
I partly agree with your comment. <br>
<br>
I (at least) solve orientation and permution separately, <br>
but you may orient and permute simultaneously by your order. <br>
<br>
If you use three-cycles with either corner or edge flip, <br>
which are rarely used for blindfold solving to my knowledge, <br>
your solving order should have great advantage. <br>
<br>
It may be too complicated to remember without mistakes. <br>
But it may be the way to go. <br>
<br>
I still don&#x27;t want to keep in memory of both EO and CO. <br>
I am going to stick CP EP (EO CO) for memorization, <br>
(EO CO) CP EP for solution for a while. <br>
(Acutually, I just tried this order only a few times. <br>
I am still comfortable with the order EP CP (EO CO) for memorization.)<br>

P.S. This is not the topic for this forum. <br>
I have started to learn center first for big cubes since last July. <br>
I am getting comfortable with center-first now and getting almost <br>
same average I used to have with column first. <br>
I have to say center-first is great method for from beginners to <br>
experts. <br>

That&#x27;s about even and odd permutations, but what it comes down to just 
this:

In general, you can not solve corners and edges independently.

Most people are trying to do exactly that (i.e. first solving corners 
without changing edges, then solving edges without changing corners, 
or vice versa), but in 50% of all cases it&#x27;s just not possible.

For example, solve the cube and then do a single U turn. Now try to 
solve all corners without changing the edges. It&#x27;s not possible. Best 
you can do is solve all but 2 corners. You can then solve all but 2 
edges, not changing the corners further. So at the end, you still need 
to swap two corners and two edges. There are also other ways of 
dealing with this issue, of course...

Cheers!

Thanks Stefan

now i&#x27;m quite clear about the parity error.

but how do you guys know that the cube has parity error? is there any 
method to calculate or base on its location?

About the edge orientation, i would like to know how to recognize 
which edges have to be flipped?

firdaus.
