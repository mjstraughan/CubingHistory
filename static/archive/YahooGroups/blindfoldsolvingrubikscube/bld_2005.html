        Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been practicing BLD solving a lot lately and I
        had a question I wanted to bring up. I know most of blindfolded solving
        is about minimizing memory interference, so that during the solve you
        don&#x27;t forget any of what you memorized and mess up the solve.
        However, I wanted to ask what is the best way to forget something
        quickly? Whenever I practice BLD solving, I do several solves in a row.
        I do this until I either have to stop to leave and go do something else
        (since BLD solving takes a while), or until I have so many bits and
        pieces of cycles and piece orientations in my head that memorizing a new
        cycle takes a whole lot of effort. I&#x27;ve tried doing several normal
        sighted solves in between blindfold solves to try to allow myself to
        forget the cycles I had previously. It seems to work alright, but to be
        honest I haven&#x27;t tried it a lot yet. I guess my question is, are
        there any useful ways to quickly forget a lot of stuff you have just
        memorized? Is there a way to use interference (doing something else for
        a while) to make sure you forget the cycles and orientations of the cube
        you just did? It always seems that my best BLD times come from either
        the first or second solve I do, since my head is still clear. Would
        meditation help to do this? I&#x27;d like to have that clear mind ease
        of memorizing for every solve instead of just the first two. Chris

        I&#x27;d simply use a different memo route each time ;-) Now I always
        put two items at one position which saves space (I need only 10-15
        positions), adds more associations (which is good for remembering) and
        is faster. A suggestion that might help for your way: Between two 3x3
        BLD solves, do a pyraminx BLD solve or a skewb BLD solve or whatever.
        This might &quot;overwrite&quot; your memory a bit because it&#x27;s
        &quot;similar&quot; data, but there&#x27;s almost no way to get confused
        because the shapes of the puzzles are so different. Cheers! Stefan ---

        This is interesting, because I have the same problem... This is a reason
        why I don&#x27;t practice too much on blindfold. I still remember a
        scramble I had in a talent show I was at nearly a year ago... For me
        atleast, I figured 2 different ways for the memorization stage... one,
        is permanent memory... I really focus on &quot;learning&quot; the
        numbers, for better accuracy, and this may take more time... i&#x27;m
        still a rookie my using numbers, heh. i got a few sub 4 minutes doing
        numbers though :-/. second, is giong over it very quickly so it
        doesn&#x27;t stay in my head, but I kind of &quot;vomet&quot; the
        information out when solving like i would on a test or something.
        lol...but this isn&#x27;t very accurate. but yeah, i can&#x27;t solve 10
        in a row because too much stuff piles up. what do others do? ron, macky?

        I&#x27;ve only had this problem a few times. One time was when I tried
        to do a 3x3x3 after doing a 4x4x4. I&#x27;m guessing that, because I
        tend to rush the memorization on 3x3x3, anything I memorize usually
        doesn&#x27;t stick for very long. Regarding order...I memorize CP EP EO
        CO and solve CO EO CP/EP. If I can&#x27;t remember CP at first or if I
        feel that I&#x27;m forgetting EP, I solve EP and then CP. I don&#x27;t
        have any trouble memorizing EP right after CP, probably because I
        memorize CP with images while I use numbers for EP. Macky --- In

        Concerning the rules for: Rubik&#x27;s Cube 3x3x3: Blindfold (number of
        cubes solved) They say when I attempt six cubes and solve five of them,
        I can&#x27;t claim to have solved five cubes. I think this is bad.
        Actually I&#x27;ve probably solved 5.9 cubes, e.g. when the mistake is
        only two flipped edges or some 3-cycle. I think it should count as 5
        cubes. Both speedcubing and memorizing allow mistakes. In Speedcubing,
        best and worst times are eliminated before we take the average and
        moreover, we allow an extra solve for a pop. In memorizing, for example
        memorizing many digits in an hour, I think the lines of digits count
        separately. If you make one mistake in a row, you only get half of the
        points for it (e.g. 20 instead of 40). If you make two mistakes, you get
        zero. But only for that line. All other lines still count. I wonder
        where that rule for blindsolving the cube came from. In my view, neither
        does it make sense nor is it consistent with speedcubing/memorizing
        procedures. What do you think? Stefan

        Hey Stefan, Thanks about the blindfolded record. Congrats on your 3x3
        one as well, though I think you&#x27;ve had it for over a week or so by
        now. I&#x27;ve been working a lot lately on blindfolded cubing,
        especially on trying to come up with new algs for situations I see a
        lot. I&#x27;ve had a couple of requests for my blindfolded method, and I
        would at least like to create a list of all the algs I use. I know an
        algs list isn&#x27;t useful to everyone, especially since Stefan&#x27;s
        method is so popular ;-P I&#x27;d like to put it up anyway though in
        case people can get some use out of it. I definitely see sub-2 minutes
        possible for a record time for my method once I get used to all the new
        algs I am learning. Right now I&#x27;m averaging about 2:55-3:05 with
        60-70% accuracy. I still really need to work on my accuracy for going
        fast, but right now I&#x27;m more concerned with learning new algs.
        Dave, Marcus I am not far behind you guys, so watch out ;-) Chris P.S.
        Stefan, BLD 2-gen is actually pretty fun. I was never really sure how to
        count the number of possible positions for 2-gen until I started trying
        to memorize it for doing it BLD, then it became pretty clear :-)
        It&#x27;s definitely a different method for memorization than for the
        3x3x3, but it still goes fairly quickly since there aren&#x27;t many
        pieces (ok I&#x27;ve said too much already ;-) ) --- In

        unfortunately inserted it the wrong way. Had he prepared for this case,
        he could&#x27;ve inserted it the right way by exploiting that inside the
        cubie you can *feel* the orientation. This could of course be used in
        general, too. For orienting the pieces, you could take them out one
        after the other and put them back oriented correctly. If you resticker
        your cube so that it&#x27;s a simple structure (e.g. the hole inside the
        corners is always opposite the white/yellow sticker) then you don&#x27;t
        even have to learn much. Cheers! Stefan

        Hello, Stefan recommeneded this group to me. I am interested in
        memorising things; and the cube is a great challenge. I put a method on
        the web in December but I have radically changed it now:
        http://www.startfromhere.freeserve.co.uk/nudesci/Blindfolded%
        20Rubiks%20Cube%20Method.htm I do not come from a cube-solver
        background; so I am using a simple solution like the one at
        www.NerdParadise.com .. puzzletopia .. twisty puzzles One thing I would
        like help with: on the middle layer, if 2 neighbouring edges need to be
        swapped, how can I do it (using the notation from
        www.SpeedCubing.com/moves.html : I think it is a popular notation). That
        would really help me. I am going to try to do the cube blindfolded
        before the end of February as a bet for a pint of beer. So I am focusing
        on the task. Thank you, Mike

        Hi stefan, Today, I tried out 3 cubes successively. Yes, I did them

        Of course, all the 3 cubes are very rough. I had to fight with it to

        can improve my speed. I am planning to do 15 cubes very shortly to

        Hi stefan, I had never failed except in few occations (twice) when my
        wife was scolding me for doing this. yesterday, she was cooperative and
        infact she only timed it. she is very happy after seeing a big article
        about her son&#x27;s achievement in the front page of a leading news
        paper. Normally, I never time it. Whenever, I pick up a single cube and
        solve it blindfolded, it is 100% perfect. But, I can not, if I am
        disturbed. However, Bernett is an inspiration for me. He is doing
        perfectly even if he is disturbed. I am really amazed at his ability .
        You may feel very happy, if you see him how earnestly he follows your
        instructions and practising speed cubing, learning its algms and
        fingering. Thanks for guiding him. Regards, John Louis Stefan Pochmann

        Hey guys, I don&#x27;t know if a lot of people have gotten the Stackmat
        2 yet, but for those who haven&#x27;t yet I&#x27;ve found a slight
        annoyance about it for blindfolded solving. If you look at the pictures
        of the base timer part, you&#x27;ll see that the reset button is very
        close to the right hand pad. This makes it possible to both stop the
        timer and hit the reset button at the same time when solving
        blindfolded. I&#x27;ve done this a few times getting used to the timer
        already. It&#x27;s not so bad for speed solving since you can see where
        to put your hands, but if you&#x27;re not careful at the end of a BLD
        solve you&#x27;ll lose your time before you even get to see it. Just a
        heads up, Chris

        Hello, Here are most of the core important algs I use when blindsolving.
        I use all of these algs, with setup moves, for other longer algs as well
        to be able to handle lots of different situations effectively. Corner
        orientation: 2 corners at once: 1)
        LU2L&#x27;U&#x27;LU&#x27;L&#x27;R&#x27;U2RUR&#x27;UR 2) the inverse of
        the above is also useful
        R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2RLUL&#x27;ULU2L&#x27; 4 corners at once
        1)
        L&#x27;U2LUL&#x27;U&#x27;LUL&#x27;UL2U&#x27;LULULU&#x27;L&#x27;U&#x27;L2
        Edge orientation: 2 edges at once 1) MUMUMU2M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;U2 4
        edges at once 1) (M&#x27;U)X4 2) R2 D&#x27; r2 (M&#x27;U)x4 r2 D R2 6
        edges at once 1) (RBR&#x27;U)X5 8 edges at once 1) (r R d D)x3 2) M2 d
        (r R d D)x2 r R D M2 superflip 1) [ (M&#x27; U)x4 y x&#x27; ]x3
        Corner/edge permutation: See the algorithms page at www.speedcubing.com
        I would also strongly recommend learning all the algorithms that swap
        only a single pair of corners and a single pair of edges. You can also
        use setup moves to use one of the algorithms above to flip different
        groups of edges. For example to flip the middle layer edges I would do
        F&#x27; L F (E L)x4 F&#x27; L&#x27; F You can recognize the (M&#x27;
        U)x4 in the form of (E L)x4 (it is only done from a different view).
        Also you can see that I just do a 3 move setup algorithm at the
        beginning, and then undo it at the end. I would like to soon put up a
        more extensive list of the more common algorithms I use (with setup
        moves included) on my website. Those algs listed above are pretty much
        all of the core algorithms I use though for solving blindfolded. Chris

      <strong>20. 6 edge flip method</strong><br />

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey, I like using the move (UR&#x27;FR)*5; I use it to solve all the 6
        edge flip cases. Of course, this requires setup moves. I found the setup
        moves often difficult to quickly come up with, and I got bored with
        doing 6 edges as 4, then 2, so I made up a little system for myself.
        Here it is: Step 1: Get each layer&#x27;s (U,E(horizontal middle
        slice),D) unoriented edges into a &quot;start&quot; position by turning
        U,E, and D as needed. Step 2: Use a short setup move to get pieces into
        position to apply (UR&#x27;FR)*5. Step 3: Do (UR&#x27;FR)*5. Step 4:
        Undo the setup moves from 1 and 2. First, designate a &quot;start&quot;
        position for each layer&#x27;s unoriented edges. For example, if there
        are 2 unoriented, opposing edges on U, they could &quot;start&quot; at
        UR-UL, or UF-UB, you choose. 3 unoriented on U could start at UF-UB-UR,
        or UF-UB-UL, etc. 2 unoriented, adjacent D edges could start at DF-DR,
        or DF-DL, etc. So, choose a start position for each case, each layer.
        Second, step 2, learn the setup moves for each case. After you get the
        edges to the start position, you still need to get them into position to
        apply (UR&#x27;FR)*5, so use a short setup move. Here&#x27;s an example:
        Unoriented edges are at UR, UL, FL, FR, BR, and DL. Step 1: My start
        position for 2 opposing edges on U is UF-UB, so I would need to do the
        move U&#x27;(or U) to get the U layer to it&#x27;s start position. My
        start position for 3 edges on the E layer is FL-FR-BR, so no move is
        needed for the E layer here. And for 1 edge on D, I start at DF, so I
        need to do the move D here. So the full step 1 setup is U&#x27;D. Step
        2: For this case my setup move is R U2 R2. That gets the edges into
        position. Step 3: Do (UR&#x27;FR)*5. Step 4: Undo the setup moves from 1
        and 2: R2 U2 R&#x27; D&#x27; U. That&#x27;s it. I hope it makes sense.
        It&#x27;s harder to explain than to do. After a while, it gets pretty
        easy to see how to move U,E,D to the start positions, and the step 2
        setup moves are not bad to learn, many are 1 or 2 turns. So not as much
        to learn as it may seem reading this. The fun part is doing the 6 edge
        cases in &quot;one&quot; move. Anyhow, maybe this will be of use to
        someone, hope so. -Dave

        Hi members, Today is a national holiday for us in India. Myself and my
        son tried blindfold solving. I did 5 cubes successively in tandem and my
        son did 3 cubes in tandem. Yes, both of us were 100 % successful. Thanks
        to stefan for his simple, yet powerful method. My result is as follows
        :-(time rounded of to the next higher whole number) memorising time:-
        cube -1 :- 10 min cube -2 :- 13 min cube -3 :- 14 min cube -4 :- 16 min
        cube -5 :- 16 min TOTAL MEMORISING TIME :- 69 MIN solving time :-(time
        rounded of to the next higher whole number) cube -1 :- 18 min cube -2 :-
        17 min cube -3 :- 21 min cube -4 :- 16 min cube -5 :- 19 min TOTAL
        SOLVING TIME :- 91 MIN Total time taken for solving 5 cubes = 91 + 69 =
        160 min My son Bernett&#x27;s result is as follows memorising time:-
        cube -1 :- 8 min 35 sec cube -2 :- 9 min 15 sec cube -3 :- 9 min 45 sec
        TOTAL MEMORISING TIME :- 27 MIN 35 SEC solving time :- cube -1 :- 10 min
        40 sec cube -2 :- 8 min 15 sec cube -3 :- 7 min 20 sec TOTAL SOLVING
        TIME :- 26 MIN 15 SEC Total time taken for solving 3 cubes = 27 MIN 35
        SEC + 26 MIN 15 SEC = 53 MIN 50 SEC What a day for both of us !! My son
        is doubly happy because he has the record of the youngest to solve 3*3*3
        blindfolded. We will try out 2 more cubes next week end. CHEERS! John

        I tried to memorize the permutations by numbering the cubies. But for
        some reasin I just cant get them to stick in my memory. So now I just
        find the permutation cycles and visualise them without any numbers or
        such things. This works good for me. I had no problem solving two cubes
        at the same time, or solving the huge permutation of 24 edges on a
        4x4x4. But to get the centers on big cubes and to solve lots of cubes I
        think I will have to change my system. /Kåre ----- Original Message

        I just cut a lot of time from my record for blindfolded skewb. But I
        need some input about how to define lucky cases for this puzzle. My
        method works as folows: 1. One group of four corners are permuted by
        default. 2. For other four corners there are three permutation cases. I
        All four correct. Lucky I guess. II Two pairs need to be solved. I do
        this with an easy 10-move alg. But after corner orientations. III
        3-cycle of corners. This is done by a single twist, the orientations and
        center permutations are memorized as they will be after this twist. 3.
        Orientations, twist one corners clockwise and one counter clockwise, or
        three the same way. Usually have to do more than one alg here. 4. Center
        permutation. Currently I only know the 3-cycles, so other cases have to
        be done in many steps. My record solve was like this. 3-cycle of
        corners, this is the most likely case, so not lucky at all. One alg to
        twist two corners, and then another to twist three more. Not lucky bot
        not the worst possible. Finaly centers was just a 3-cycle, and this is
        the part I&#x27;m not sure about. The time for this solve was 1:35.72.
        My previous record was 2:18.58 with a 5-cycle of centers. /Kåre

        Hi Kare, first of all - congratulations! I certainly need to improve a
        lot to catch you :-) My method is almost the same as yours, though I
        stupidly think/memorize two twists ahead in case 2II where I should
        really use an alg like you do instead. A quick math shot now... I think
        there are 360 (=6!/2) possible permutations and 40 (=6C3*2!) of them are
        3-cycles. That&#x27;s a 1/9 chance which doesn&#x27;t sound too bad. For
        the 3x3 if three corners are solved and the rest are one 5-cycle
        that&#x27;s 1/30 and this is defined as non-lucky (it&#x27;s 8!=40320
        possible permutations and 8C5*4!=1344 are 5-cycles). Maybe that&#x27;s
        not the best comparison because for the skewb centers there&#x27;s
        nothing between 3 correct and 6 correct, whereas there are many more
        possibilities for the 3x3 corners. What&#x27;s the probability for
        exactly five corners out of place? So I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s of course
        a little lucky but not lucky enough to discard it as &quot;lucky
        case&quot;. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        I guess I can count this time after all. I was hesitating because it was
        40s faster than my second best time. But today I got lots of fast times
        so its not that extreme any more. My best average of 3(5) is 1:48.32

        Sorry for the delay, but I wanted to wait until it&#x27;s included in
        the speedcubingdotcom list. I didn&#x27;t want to influence the decision
        at all of how &quot;amazing&quot; to rate it. Note that
        &quot;amazing&quot; is not proportional to &quot;difficult&quot;. The
        super 5x5 is *easier* than the normal 5x5, though I agree for most
        people out there it&#x27;s more &quot;amazing&quot;. Same for (super)
        4x4, so you still have to prove you can solve a 4x4 blindfolded ;-) For
        me personally, nothing in that list is &quot;amazing&quot; anymore. I
        can still be impressed but not really amazed. If that sounds arrogant,
        I&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s not. Compare it to any non-cuber who watches
        you solve the cube (just normal, not blindfolded) and calls that
        &quot;amazing&quot;. For him/her it might be, but for us? That&#x27;s
        because we know some things about it, good systems and strategies. And
        once you know a bit about blindsolving and memorization techniques and
        what memorizers are capable of, you simply can&#x27;t be amazed much
        anymore. Ok, back to your question and why the super version is easier.
        I&#x27;d say blindsolving consists of three parts: - Analysis (find out
        what you have to do) - Memorization - Solving I memorize super 5x5 and
        normal 5x5 exactly the same way. I solve them the same way (well,
        parities and center orientations are slightly different, but that&#x27;s
        nothing). But analysis! Analyzing the super 5x5 is much easier, cause
        this sweetie is nice enough to exactly tell you where each piece
        belongs. So you can just &quot;read&quot; what you have to do. The
        normal 5x5 forces you to *decide* where the equivalent pieces shall go.
        That&#x27;s a complete extra task and a pretty ugly one. Cheers! Stefan

        Congratulations Stephan, I am also working on the blindfold 5x5x5

        Hi Stephan, I do think I know what went wrong with the three-cycle. On
        one solve I had a situation with the X centers that required two pair
        swaps. One of the pair swaps was 15 - 8. What I actually did by mistake
        was 16 - 8. I can&#x27;t explain why I made such a simple error but it
        did result in the entire cube being supersolved except for a three cycle
        of X centers 8 - 16 - 15. To make matters even more heartbreaking in the
        numbering system I use 8 is on the Back face and 15 16 are on the Left
        face. Thus when I took my blindfold off it looked like the cube was
        solved, my excitement started to rise, and then I looked to the left
        only to be crushed by a simple little error. Ironically it is exactly
        for this reason that I find blindsolving so appealing - there is NO ROOM
        FOR ERROR and it is so ruthlessly unforgiving - you either get it or you
        don&#x27;t - there is no in between. Let&#x27;s definately compare notes
        after I nail the solve which should be in the near future. My system is
        entirely in place, memorization is not a problem - I just need to find
        the free afternoon and the discipline for a FLAWLESS execution. bis

        - 15. Ouch, yeah, I&#x27;ve done something similar a few times. In the
        Euro2004 finals for 3x3 BLD my first attempt was wrong by two flipped
        edges because at one point I solved white/green instead of green/white
        (or the other way around, don&#x27;t remember). And this problem also
        made me fail my recent &quot;five 3x3s&quot; attempt... > To make

        with a less exciting puzzle. You have my sincere commiseration :-) Btw,
        one reason I take pictures afterwards is that I later (after playing
        with the puzzle again) want to be sure I really really did it and
        didn&#x27;t overlook a tiny fault, cause sometimes I don&#x27;t even
        trust myself ;-) > Ironically it is exactly for this reason that I find

        the most about blindsolving achievements. I think most people who

        I know this stuff is old-hat to a lot of you by now, but after solving a
        few cubes without looking at the cube - but with notes, I just attempted
        to do a real solve and succeeded. It took 31 minutes to memorize and 17
        minutes to solve. I know that&#x27;s slow, but it&#x27;ll be fun to try
        to get that time down to a quicker speed like a lot of you guys.
        I&#x27;d like to thank Stefan Pochmann for helping me figure out a
        blindfold method which works well for me. I still use the orient corners
        and orient edges steps separately, like on Grant&#x27;s site. But using
        the idea of placing one cubie at a time with &quot;buffer zones&quot;
        (with a few personal modifications)from Stephan&#x27;s site, is what
        enabled me to do it.

        I use bandanas, they are cheap to buy, and you just have to fold them to
        a band about 5cm thick and tie it over your eyes. It&#x27;s easy to wear
        while memorizing and just slip over your eyes when you&#x27;re ready to
        start solving. Also when you fold one that many times (to make such a

        Hey everyone, I recently looked at some of the probability related to
        blindfold solving in competitions. ------------------- Here is how I
        looked at blindfold solving. I started with three assumptions: 1) The
        faster you try to go, the worse your chances for getting a successful
        solve. 2) In a competition your goal is only to get the fastest solve
        you possibly can. 3) You absolutely under no circumstances want to DNF
        every solve you are given in a round. This forces your elimination which
        makes #2 impossible. Starting with these assumptions I looked at the
        odds of making sure you get at the very least one successful solve out
        of either the 2 or 3 solves given. --------------------------- Given 2
        solves in the round --------------------------- Call your personal
        success rate in practice the variable x. Now the odds of you failing a
        solve are (1-x), and the odds of you failing both solves given are
        (1-x)^2. So the odds of successfully completing at least one solve in a
        competition round given two solves is 1-(1-x)^2 To satisfy #3 above, the
        urge to not be eliminated in a tournament, I said that the odds of
        getting at least one successful solve in a competition should at the
        very worst be 99% So now we have to solve 0.99=1-(1-x)^2 0=0.01-(1-x)^2
        and by factoring the difference of squares we get, 0=0.01+1-x or
        0=0.01-1+x x=1.1 or x=0.9 And since these numbers are probabilities we
        must choose x=0.9 So in order to nearly guarantee that you are not
        eliminated in a tournament given 2 solves you have to solve with at
        worst 90% accuracy. I call the 90% solving &quot;break neck&quot; speed,
        since it is the fastest you can go and still be safe in knowing you will
        almost certainly not be eliminated. --------------------------- Given 3
        solves in the round --------------------------- By the same logic
        I&#x27;m trying to find an equation to show my odds of getting at least
        one successful solve in a competition round with 3 solves, given that I
        have success rate x in practice. My chances of failure are (1-x) and my
        chances of failing all three solves is (1-x)^3. So the chances of
        getting at least one successful solve is 1-(1-x)^3 Again, we want this
        chance at the very worst to be 99% so that you aren&#x27;t eliminated
        from the competition. 0.99=1-(1-x)^3 0=0.01-(1-x)^3 and by factoring the
        difference of cubes we get
        0=[100^(-1/3)-1+x]*[100^(-2/3)+(1-x)*100^(-1/3)+(1-x)^2] so
        0=[100^(-1/3)-1+x] or 0=[100^(-2/3)+(1-x)*100^(-1/3)+(1-x)^2] the longer
        equation gives non-real roots so all we have to look at is
        0=[100^(-1/3)-1+x] x=1-100^(-1/3) which is approximately 78.46% Similar
        to the 90% answer for a 2 solve round, 78.46% is the &quot;break
        neck&quot; speed. This is the fastest you can solve and still be almost
        certain that you won&#x27;t be eliminated.
        -------------------------------- If anyone is interested in looking at
        this further I suggest graphing the two functions f(x)=1-(1-x)^2 and
        g(x)=1-(1-x)^3 and looking at where your typical success rate falls. In
        practice I tend to shoot for a 2/3 success rate, which is ok for a 3
        solve competition (though I have a 1/20 chance of getting eliminated)
        but horrible for a 2 solve round (1/9 chance of getting eliminated).
        Anyway I was surprised by these results and wanted to post here in case
        anyone was interested. I think I&#x27;ll start solving a little slower
        and more deliberately now :-) Chris

        Hi Chris, Interesting post. Do you find that nerves play a role in
        competition blindfold solves which might reduce your success percentage
        - especially at breakneck speed?? If so, what about this for food for
        thought. Use the first solve to be more methodical. Don&#x27;t go top
        speed but about 75%. Hopefully this will get you over your nerves and
        into the flow of blindsolving. Assuming a successful solve at 3/4 speed
        you already have your successful solve in the bank and can freely go at
        full speed for the other (two) solve(s) to try to get the fastest
        possible time. Just an idea, Rob --- cmhardw &lt;foozman17@...> wrote: >

        I didn&#x27;t mention this in my first post, but I do something similar.
        The break neck speeds I list for each method are the speeds you should
        go until you get a successful solve. For a round with 2 solves you
        should solve with roughly 90% or better accuracy, so in words you are
        solving fairly slowly and carefully, but still taking some risks. This
        also, however, means you are going faster than perfect 100% accuracy
        where you take a long time. If you succeed on that solve, then for the
        final solve you should most definitely go whatever your most comfortable
        full speed is. Mine is roughly 66% accuracy which gives great times 2/3
        the time, but obviously 1/3 aren&#x27;t succesful. However, if you miss
        the first solve, you shouldn&#x27;t freak out and slow down to solve
        with 100% accuracy on your second solve. By these odds you are already
        greater than 99% certain that you won&#x27;t be eliminated if you solve
        the 2nd cube ALSO with 90% accuracy instead of getting nervous at having
        missed the 1st cube. ---- The same is true for 3 cubes, solve at 78-80%
        accuracy until you get a successful solve. If you miss the first 2
        cubes, don&#x27;t freak out and slow down to 100% accuracy. You can
        continue solving at 78-80% accuracy and you are still almost certain you
        won&#x27;t be eliminated. Of course it is still possible that you will
        be eliminated, but that is the trade off for attempting to go faster
        than the slow and careful 100% accuracy type solving. I didn&#x27;t
        mention that, but that was actually my intended observation with that
        math. Obviously if you get a good time on the first solve or within the
        first two for a 3 cube round, and you can happily accept that time as
        your fastest, then going full speed on the last few solves doesn&#x27;t
        hurt at all. Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        not be eliminated. Previous results don&#x27;t matter and expectations

        I agree, if you miss the first two solves and still solve at a faster
        rate (78-80% accuracy only) then for that last cube you only have a
        78-80% chance of solving it. The reason I did this was to think of a
        strategy that allowed me to go as fast as possible (which is the same as
        the smallest accuracy possible) yet still not go too fast and get
        eliminated. My idea was to solve always with the same accuracy (roughly
        of course since that isn&#x27;t possible exactly when doing a real group
        of BLD solves) and set that accuracy such that I have a very, very low
        chance of being eliminated. By your example I&#x27;m in a 3 solve round
        and have failed the first two solves. I agree that situation is
        possible, but there is a 24/25=96% chance that I would get at least one
        of the first two solves given an 80% solving accuracy. I also agree that
        having failed the first two solves, the chance of getting that last
        solve is still 80% and not 99%. I only mean that viewing all three
        solves as a group, and solving at 80%, the chance of missing all three
        is 0.8% I didn&#x27;t say my strategy was perfect and that you would
        never be eliminated, I only meant it as a good goal to go for speed
        solving, yet not so fast that you are very likely to be eliminated. I
        meant my post as a compromise between speed, and being eliminted as
        infrequently as possible. Chris --- In

        Congratulations. The difficulty in blindfolding seems to be mainly
        psychological. Once you solved a puzzle blindfolded it&#x27;s not nearly
        as much of a challenge to do it again. At least thats how 2x2x2 and
        3x3x3 worked for me. If I only could stop fearing the 4x4x4 I know I
        could solve it too. /Kåre ----- Original Message ----- From: Bob Burton

        Bob, I understand your frustration, as I went through it too. The best
        thing to remember though is don&#x27;t view your unsuccesful solves as
        &quot;wasted time.&quot; View them as the necessary practice to getting
        your first succesful solve. Without these screw-ups you couldn&#x27;t
        get your first good solve. As frustrating as it is, it is necessary.
        Unless you are a blindfold solving prodigy or something I think everyone
        screws up a lot at first. So don&#x27;t fret - everybody goes through it

        What has helped me a lot, and what may help you, is to practice solving
        it &quot;blindfolded&quot; while looking at it. That is, memorize the
        cube, and then solve it using your blindfold method with your eyes open.
        This could help you realize silly errors that you are making in your
        blindfold method. After doing this for a while, I drastically improved
        my accuracy, and the solving time (after memorization) has shortened a
        bit. It&#x27;s really cool when you can solve it blindfolded faster than
        you can solve it &quot;blindfolded&quot;. Leyan --- In

        Does anyone know any 2x2 algs that swap 2 corners, 1 from the U layer,

        than this, but this is what I use: (Certainly depending on which
        positions you would like to swap) This swaps ULB and DLF: F&#x27; (R
        U&#x27;) (R&#x27; U&#x27; R U) (R&#x27; F&#x27;) (R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)
        (R&#x27; F R) F Notice F&#x27; is just a set-up move. I like this alg
        because it is the easy Y-permutation (without the first F move and last
        F&#x27;) and it can be done very quickly. If you want to swap a
        different corner from the D-layer, use a different set-up move that
        doesn&#x27;t move the ULB corner. Be sure to put the D-face of the cubie
        you are swapping in the RDF position. I hope this is clear? ~ Bob

        I wrote my own speed solve program to time myself, do averages, and keep

        You use a normal 3x3x3 cube, but you are only allowed to turn two
        adjacent faces (usually U and R). So you would scramble with U and R,
        and also solve just by turning U and R. It makes for an interesting
        puzzle when doing it blindfolded. Chris P.S. Leyan congrats on your 11

        Hi, After a few solves, I found it was much less painful for me to
        memorize the initial state using only my &quot;visual memory&quot;. Do
        you always use numbers for memorization? I prefer drawing the cycles in

        Memorization order: EP CP CO EO Solve order: EO CO CP EP I memorize the
        edge and corner permutation with a combination of visual and muscle
        memory. I picture the cycles like Chun Hei says, by &quot;drawing
        imaginary lines for edges and corners&quot; and trace these cycles out
        with my hands to enforce my memory. There are tricks to this, like
        associating certain patterns with something else: fish shaped cycles,
        triangle patterns, cycles that jump all the way around, symmetrical
        cycles, cycles that bounce diagonally across the whole cube, or just
        across one face, etc. For corner orienation, I use numbers or words. I
        actually repeat what I memorized out loud, and keep on repeating them
        while looking at the edge orientation. That way, I can better remember
        what I memorized by remembering what I was hearing myself say. I
        don&#x27;t really memorize edge orientation, as that is the first step I
        solve after I put on the blindfold. I just memorize what setup moves I
        need to do and what algorithms I&#x27;m going to use. Leyan --- In

        I memorize permutations (cycles) by visualisation. I have improved my
        memorization twice since the first approach. I guess most people figure
        out the same tricks but here it goes EP = (13479a2b56)(8)(c), just
        remove 1-cycles 1. Pair up the pieces. (13 47 9a 2b 56) Pairs are almost
        as easy to remember as a single piece and just half as many. 2. When I
        permute using 3-cycles my I cycle the first three pieces, solving the
        second and third. Having to break up pairs all the time is just stupid
        and time consuming so have an odd number of pieces in the first group.
        (134 79 a2 b5 6) For CO I memorize the pairs (or tripplets) to be solved
        with one alg. For EO I remember setup moves and the algs to use. Visual
        memorization works, and is ok for the 3x3x3. But if you want to try
        bigger cubes you should try other ways. Pochmann has a nice way that
        I&#x27;m trying out for bigger cubes
        http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/blindsolving/3x3/ Pochmann also
        solve the 3x3 one piece at a time (permutation and orientation
        simultaneously). Anyone tried to solve two pieces at a time like this?
        This should save lots of turns, but mabey the setup moves make it to
        hard/slow? /Kåre ----- Original Message ----- From: yhgrps_m

        solving two edges at a time. My buffer edge (from where I solve) would
        be DF. Then I&#x27;d bring the other pieces to UF and UB (or maybe UL or
        UR). Depending on the orientations of these two pieces, I&#x27;d choose
        one out of four algs. If you learn 8 algs then you can also choose which
        one goes to UF and which to UB. All this should lead to quite short and
        easy setup moves (2+2 moves is a trivial upper bound but I think 3 might
        actually be the worst case). The easiest case/alg of course would be
        [U2, M&#x27;] but the others aren&#x27;t that bad, either. Cheers!

        Hi Everyone, I guess I joined this group a long time ago but I never
        paid attention because I couldn&#x27;t blindfold. I&#x27;ve been
        successfully blindfolding for about a week now, so I guess I should
        start paying attention here. Hmmm... let&#x27;s see... I am a student of
        Macky and Leyan. Seriously, you couldn&#x27;t ask for a more qualified
        set of teachers. First successful blindfold solve was in 6 minutes 14.97
        seconds, and personal best of 4 minutes 20.56 seconds. Yeah,

        will be translated into more than 100 different languages(!), so I need
        to keep the amount of text to an absolute minimum. This is where I need
        your help. Do you have a clever idea for pictures, picture Icons and
        symbols that could substitute for text? Something like the great FWD and
        PLAY symbols now used on all VCRs and DVD players? I will also need
        ideas for Menu items, such as Hints, Contact Us, Media, Make Home Page,
        Add to Favorites, Link to Us and Shop. I wantt to use as few words as
        possible: just pictures, symbols and a little bit of English. Also
        needed: [bullet] An icon for &quot;New Free Game of the Day&quot; -- any
        smart ideas for that? [bullet] A &quot;people&quot; icon showing how

        If you want to link objects to the cubies I think Pochmann&#x27;s way of
        going with colors makes the most sense. So for a white-yellow edge you
        think of some white-yellow object, like yellow snow :-) This is how

        I really have been trying to think how that&#x27;s possible. There are
        only two ways I can think to do this. 1) Memorize cycles, but also
        simultaneously which pieces are flipped. So when you come to a flipped
        piece in the cycle you just memorize that it is flipped. Giving thought
        to 20 pieces would mean doing 2.5 pieces per second. Seems possible with
        lots of practice. 2) The other way, and I think this is less likely to
        be the way he did it, is to memorize the pieces at DBL, DL, DB, BL and
        also their flip. Then you can just visually scan the UFR faces for their
        colors long enough to get an idea where the pieces are and their flips.
        After you put on the blindfold you would first spend lots of time
        decoding the UFR faces, then you could solve by cycles. I mean I guess
        it&#x27;s possible but it sees almost unreasonable. Chris --- In

        I think he still uses Stefan&#x27;s method. I&#x27;m wondering how much
        time he spends after memorization decoding the information before he
        solves because his solve times are pretty slow. Memorization is a tool;
        it is not a gift. It becomes strengthened with practice. The key thing
        to remember is the he focuses on memory, whereas we&#x27;re cubers.
        I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;ll always hold the advantage as long as we
        can regularly solve the cube in about 90 seconds. Even if our
        memorization takes one minute, 2:30 is still a ridiculously good time.
        As cubers, we never train our memories, because it hasn&#x27;t gotten
        there yet. Currently, people are still working on solving faster, and
        retaining the information they memorized. I don&#x27;t know if any of us
        can memorize the cube in 8 seconds, but memorizing the cube in 8 seconds
        is absolutely useless if it takes you 30 seconds before you start the
        solve. Furthermore, our fathers are not John Louis. I&#x27;m pretty sure
        that we can train ourselves to memorize the cube in about 30 seconds,
        reasonably. I mean, I&#x27;ve been blindfold cubing for about 2 weeks,
        and orientation only takes maybe 10 seconds to memorize right? And, with
        some practice, I know I could remember 20 numbers at one number per
        second... I was trying this before with 10 numbers on the computer on
        the memory olympiad page. The key is to build confidence in your memory,
        that you remember the pieces in each cycle, maybe say them once in your
        head, and then never go back, and you start, and you&#x27;re confident
        that you have it right. After these memory accomplishments, blindfold
        cubers will start to focus on memory now, because we know it&#x27;s
        possible. I would just practice some speed memory exercises. Other
        things I would do, and I do this myself, is delete all phone numbers in
        your stupid cell phone, and memorize them instead. If you&#x27;re
        stranded somewhere, and you don&#x27;t have your cell phone, it&#x27;ll
        save your butt. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On

        Yes, Bernett still uses my method. He just has different images to
        encode the cubies and different mental routes. And he practices a whole
        lot more than I&#x27;ve ever ;-) He doesn&#x27;t lose time decoding the
        information before he solves. He loses time because he twists slower (he
        actually only very recently lubed his cube) and doesn&#x27;t use many
        algorithms (until very recently he solely used the T-permutation, now he
        begins to use the others which save a lot of setup moves and thus time).

        The downside with Pochmanns method is that it&#x27;s not verry good for
        solving orientation and permutation separately like most of us do now.
        But if you learn a bunch of algs to solve two pieces (orient + permute)
        at a time it should be really fast. My experiments with images and
        routes shows that its the way to go for bigger cubes (mabye all bigger
        than 2x2) because time consumption scales almost linear to the amount of
        data to memorize. I think the top memorizers do a deck of cards in
        20-25s. That is about the same amount of data as a 4x4x4. So 8s for a
        3x3x3 is really fast but I still belive it can be done. /Kåre -----

        *record* is still 32.9 seconds:
        http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/memory.html#cards-speed > That is
        about the same amount of data as a 4x4x4. It feels a bit strange to
        compare these. For the cubes we usually analyze/memorize the structure
        of the scramble, i.e. the cycles. Andy memorizes a deck of cards by
        always just taking the next three cards and memorizing them as one
        mental image (with subject, action and object). There&#x27;s no analysis
        whatsoever, it&#x27;s pure raw memorization (after translating the cards
        to subject/action/object but that&#x27;s automatic with lots of
        practice). So he memorizes about 17 images in 30+ seconds, whereas as
        far as I know Bernett memorized around 20 in 8 seconds, though his are
        simpler (only one item at each place, not three). For the 4x4 compared
        to the 3x3 we also have another difficulty, namely pieces that look the
        same (the centers) and we have to decide where each should go.
        That&#x27;s actually my biggest trouble solving the larger cubes. A
        better comparison might be between 3x3 and the record for memorizing
        digits in 4 seconds, where the record is 22. Gert certainly translates
        at least 2 digits as one image and probably stores the last few images
        in short term memory rather than connecting them with a mental route. So
        that&#x27;s 11 minus a few images in four seconds. Oh, and wherever I
        said &quot;image&quot;, that&#x27;s not necessarily only visual. It can
        be more like a scene with smells, movement, sounds, feeling, tastes etc.
        Anything can help make the memory stronger, though it might take more
        time. Cheers! Stefan

        If you are a member of this group, you are certainly familiar with the
        competition form of blindfold cubing (solver examines the cube, puts on
        a blindfold then solves the cube). Every so often one hears of other
        forms of blindfold cubing. The other forms require the assistance at
        least one other person. In one form, the sighted person tells the
        blindfolded person which moves to make, one move at a time. Some have
        enhanced this variation to allow the sighted person to tell the
        blindfolded person which algorithm to perform. And in at least one case,
        a cube has been solved over the phone. The person making the moves
        described the cube to the other person, who indicated which moves to
        make. At WC2003, I demonstrated a version in which I was blindfolded,
        and was assisted by a helper. After the cube was scrambled, the helper
        picked a color. I pointed at squares, and was told &quot;yes&quot; or
        &quot;no&quot; depending on whether or not I was pointing at the
        selected color. This information was used to place all squares of the
        selected on one side. Next, the helper picked a second color, and
        &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; questions were again used to assemble
        the second side without destroying the first side. Then a third, fourth
        and fifth color were chosen, and in each case, a new side was completed
        without destroying the previously completed sides. (There is never a
        need to pick the sixth side, because completion of the fifth side forces
        the sixth side to be solved as well. The squares of the sixth color have
        no other place to be other than the one remaining side.) Over the course
        of many years I have developed many variations of the method that I
        demonstrated at WC2003. These are finally described in a Word document
        that I am placing in the files section. You will also find an Excel
        spreadsheet that contrasts the various methods. So please take a look,
        and let me know your questions and comments. If there is enough
        interest, I am willing to describe how some of these variations are
        accomplished, starting with &quot;basic seeing eye blindfold&quot;
        cubing. Above all, if you know of still other variations, by all means
        let me know. Thanks. Jim Mittan

        Hey Adam, Let&#x27;s say you have a parity with corners and edges. In
        other words, you want to switch two corners and two edges. If the two
        corners aren&#x27;t diagonally in the same layer, I first do a
        T-permutation to fix those two corners. If one corner is in the top
        layer and the other corner is in the bottom layer, in the process of
        putting the corner from the bottom to the top, you need to be careful
        not to touch the edges that will be switched in the T-permutation. So
        then, I put the cube back, and I remember which two corners are
        switched. I then just place to the two edges in the opposite slots, and
        do an H-permutation (four-edge swap across) and that solves it. There
        are other things you can do but the T-permutation + H-permutation is
        really fast for setting up and very fast for executing. Tyson Mao MSC

        Well, he&#x27;s solving the cube in about two minutes right? Also keep
        in mind with the Pochmann method, orientation is done with the
        permutation so he saves some time there. I don&#x27;t really see how you
        can solve the cube in two minutes using two-cycles unless you&#x27;re
        doing finger tricks on your t-permutation. If you turn the cube with
        your hands, then he must be doing something else because... well, how
        many times do you have to execute the T-permutation in that solve?
        Let&#x27;s say... 20 times? I don&#x27;t know... someone who knows
        better can give me a better estimate? If you don&#x27;t do any setup
        moves ever, that&#x27;s 6 seconds per T-permutation. The T-permutation
        is 14 moves long right? Two moves per second using hands is pretty

        He&#x27;s only doing 2-cycles. I&#x27;ve always known it&#x27;s fast but
        nobody believed it ;-) Besides being easy, it&#x27;s also fast because
        the algorithms are very fast and the setup moves are short (around 1-2
        moves) and there are so few of them that you can *know* them all,
        there&#x27;s *no thinking* required once you practiced enough and you
        can do it subconsciously. And Bernett does use finger tricks, sure.
        Shortly after he recently lubed his cube for the first time (and watched
        a T-perm video with finger tricks), he did the T-perm four times in
        12-16 seconds and we all know that&#x27;s slow, so he might be faster
        now that he has practiced with a lubed cube (haven&#x27;t asked him
        since). The other three algorithms are very fast, too. Cheers! Stefan

        Believe me, I am the only eye witness. His timing now for the
        T-permutation for 4 times is 8 sec. He uses fingers very nicely nowadays

        again using wd-80 !!. (he still feels that his cube is not so smooth as
        any of yours as he watches your videos. Moreover he started using

        I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT HE IS REALLY SOLVING IT BLINDFOLDED !!! But, I

        stroke. He has only one imported rubik&#x27;s cube. The local cubes are
        not at all upto the mark. You all have to lend your cubes to him for

        Instead of orienting, and then permuting pieces using setup moves within
        a group which preserves orientation, has anyone tried to use setup moves
        to orient pieces? It seems easy for edges, a little more complicated for

        I kind of feel that the setup moves, and keeping track of what edges
        need to be flipped would slow you down. I have no idea, of course,
        whether or not you would make up for it by not doing the edge
        orientation, but in my experience, edge orientation takes 5 seconds to
        memorize (if you&#x27;re human) and maybe 10 seconds to execute... and
        once those are all oriented &quot;correctly&quot; by whatever group you
        want, well, the setup moves for permutation are all so easy that pretty
        much there&#x27;s no thinking involved. I guess the only way to see how
        it works is to get a bunch of people trying it as well. Tyson Mao MSC

        15s is quite a lot of time when the solves are less than two minutes. I

        setup without orienting and choose alg depending on orientations. Today

        Hi Evan, Memorize edge orientation is fast enough for me that no, I
        actually don&#x27;t even memorize the 12 binary digits. Instead, what I
        do, and of course everyone is different, is I just remember the moves
        like... &quot;L&#x27; four edge flip on top&quot; and then &quot;front
        right (two)&quot; in the D when I flip the cube over. Had a 2:20 failure

        Just a thought. Back when I memorized with numbers (and did orientation
        separately from permutation) I put 3 bits into one digit (0-7), then
        paired them to two 2-digit numbers which I then translated to two images
        (I was interested in memorizing numbers and was building a dictionary of
        images for numbers 00-99 anyway). Stefan

        Hi Dave, isn&#x27;t your success (I solved the cube using your
        instructions) proof enough that you did it right? ;-) There are some
        improvements though that I can suggest: - Do your T-perm backwards, I
        think that&#x27;s much faster. - Do the MoveA-PLL backwards, I think
        that&#x27;s faster, too. - Use double-layer instead of slice moves for
        setup. - Instead of edges move11 and corners move1 you could do: y (r U
        R&#x27; U&#x27; M U R U&#x27; R&#x27;) y&#x27; That&#x27;s just 10
        instead of 27 moves. But I only recently thought about shortcutting the
        parity. - For corners try other PLLs than MoveE, e.g in move4 I&#x27;d
        now do U+MoveB+U&#x27;. Stefan --- In

        Hey. I just tried my first &quot;real&quot; bld solve today and had only
        one issue during my corner permutation. I was wondering if someone could
        help me with which set up move I can use. the algorithm
        (RB&#x27;R&#x27;B *3), which I&#x27;m sure all of you know about,
        switches UFR - UBL and UBR - DBR. So, i was left at the end of my corner
        permutation with UFL - DFB and UBL with DBR and for some reason
        can&#x27;t figure out a set up move for this. I&#x27;m using the cycle
        method. Also, I think I have problem&#x27;s figuring out the T permution
        set up moves if I have a parity. If anyone can give me any help that
        would be great. Thanks - Dave Bergman

        I probably would have done it using T-permutations. Okay, so first
        switch UFL and DFB: U2 F2 (T-permutation) F2 U2. We have to keep in mind
        that UL and UR corners are switched. Now, switch UBL and DBR: U2 D B2
        (T-permutation) B2 D&#x27; U2 and that should do it. Sometimes, if you
        do a U2 or no setup move and then a U&#x27; or U setup move in the other
        one, you just have to do a four edge opposite swap. These algorithms,
        are fortunately, all very very fast. What do you guys think? Tyson Mao

        you really mean DFB? With cases like this, I often use two 3-cycles. The
        first one puts a piece in its correct place, the second one solves the
        three others. I requires not much thinking, which is always a good thing
        for me, because I tend to forget what I memorized when I spend too much
        time finding a difficult setup move. To solve (UFL DFL)(UBL DBR): (UFL
        UBL DBR) then (DFL UFL UBL) Marc

        he should just do (R2 y2) to set up and then use the algorithm he
        mentioned himself. Actually this is so obvious that it makes me think
        you misinterpreted his typo and he really meant something different.

        be mean to anyone, but it sounds like you still haven&#x27;t dont it
        yourself, right? Blindsolving is so easy I can&#x27;t call it
        &quot;amazing&quot; anymore and I&#x27;m happy the &quot;amazing
        blindfold achievements&quot; list at SCC was removed ;-) Go try it!
        Tyson actually inspired me to complete my set of mental images and
        practice a lot, now I&#x27;m joining him in the average-of-10 list.
        I&#x27;ve done 15 attempts today, more than I&#x27;ve ever done in a
        month I think. Come join us :-) Cheers! Stefan

        Greetings, We want to thank everyone from the online cubing community
        who has been kind enough to send us their comments, ideas, and
        suggestions. Over the past week, we have accumulated some great ideas
        from you folks as to how we can make our product better! Please keep
        sending us feedback and continue to try out the new versions as we post
        them. The biggest change in the new version is related to the comments
        we&#x27;ve received about wanting an alternate method of orienting your
        view of the cube. So, without losing the existing freedom of rotation,
        we have added a secondary way to change your view of the cube. Holding
        down the left shift key while rotating a slice of the cube will turn the
        *entire* cube 90 degrees (or 180 if you also have the left CTRL key
        down) in the same axis/direction the single slice would have moved. This
        eases the ability to &#x27;flip&#x27; the cube around and see the
        backside without losing your current perspective on the cube. Thanks to
        Joël van Noort for this suggestion! An in-game help screen has been
        added that details all the available controls as well. The change log
        for the demo project is now posted on the downloads page of our website
        (http://www.gabbasoft.com) if anyone is interested in seeing everything
        that has been modified to date. Again, thanks so much for all of your
        input and we hope you will continue to send us your thoughts and ideas
        for making our product better. Regards, Jamey Pittman President

        Greetings, I can&#x27;t believe how many requests we&#x27;ve received
        about the desire for larger cubes! Of course, I should have known better
        after I saw that someone in Japan had solved the 9x9x9 in a little over
        2 hours and posted the screenshots on his site. So, as of this release,
        we now support cube sizes up to 20x20x20. I would certainly expect that
        performance will noticably degrade on slower/older systems when you get
        up to 15x15x15 and above but you are free to give `em a try. Ton from
        Speedcubing.com made the request for changing the timer behavior to wait
        until the first move is made after a scramble to start  seemed to be a
        good idea to me so that has been added as well. We&#x27;ve also received
        enough comments about the moving background making people dizzy to
        change it and make it static  we hope you like it better! You can get
        the latest version from our downloads page:

        Hey, people, I&#x27;m relatively new to BLD cubing, I think 2 weeks of
        practicing, and I&#x27;m having some troubles with memorisation of edges
        permutation. Sometimes, I do CO, EO, CP and when I get to EP, I think:
        Well, what was the cycle? And sometimes I can&#x27;t remember, and when
        I think I&#x27;m finished, the cube is not solved... There&#x27;s a good
        way to memorise EP? I usually do like this: for example, a cycle (1 4 7
        6 2 9 11 10 8 12 3) will be broken into (1 4 7, 6 2 9, 11 10 8, 12 3)
        but sometimes I forgot the numbers... do you think it&#x27;s a good idea
        to broke into something like this: (1 4 7, 6 2, 9 11, 10 8, 12 3)???
        that way, I cut 4 and 7, do 1 6 2, cut 6 and 2, do 1 9 11, cut 9 and
        11... Pedro

        OK, I&#x27;ve been doing this for a couple weeks now, too. I started
        learning it with three cycles, but kept messing up somewhere in the
        setup moves, so I&#x27;ve been keeping it all just two cycles with the T
        permutation, thanks to Bill McGaugh. It seems to also be easier for me
        in memorization because I just see the numbers as an individual pair. I
        do the same T permutation for the corners, but keep the numbers straight
        by remembering them as a whole number, so 1 3 on the edges I would think
        as &quot;one, three&quot;, but on the corners as &quot;thirteen&quot;.
        Also, I memorize the edge permutation first because it&#x27;s the
        longest string and I can make sure I have it down before I start to
        solve. I memorize the corner permutation last because it&#x27;s just a
        few numbers that I&#x27;ll get too real soon. The orientations I do in
        between. I&#x27;ll start again with a faster solving solution in a few
        weeks, once memorizing isn&#x27;t what slows me down most. Right now
        I&#x27;m keeping it real simple. I don&#x27;t know if any of that would
        help, I guess memorizing is just something that gets easier with
        practice. It was taking me about nine minutes at first to memorize a
        couple weeks ago, now it&#x27;s about four minutes. Good luck, Matt ---

        Im just 2-3 weeks into BLD now, but a trick i use has made my
        memorisation relatively solid for me. What i do isthat along with
        numbers i try to remember the perms visually. Like some diagonal corners
        or opposite edges something like that. And i make sure i know the first
        2-3 numbers perfectly. becoz when i recollect the first sequence, the
        whole cycle comes to me immediately. Hope this helps. Sachin. ---

        solve. > There&#x27;s a good way to memorise EP? I usually do like this:

        Shirwalkar, you should try to memorize EP visually, noticing patterns in
        the cycles. This has been discussed in this thread:
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube/message/301
        I sometimes imagine that I am on a roller coaster going from cubie to
        cubie :) Anyway, I think you should not memorize numbers as if they had
        no &quot;structure&quot;, like in a telephone number, but always see
        their position on the cube.

        theories for a while. I&#x27;m constantly trying to develop ideas for
        the puzzles on my bld wishlist. basically, My first idea was find an alg
        that swap two pieces whatever they are. I came up with this:
        -2,0/-1,-1/1,-2/-3,-3/-3,-4/3,0/-6,-5/3,-2/-1,0/-6,-4/5,-5 This will
        swap a corner and edge piece. If this worked all the time, you could
        easily solve the square-1 piece by piece using 2-cycles. Problem is, it
        won&#x27;t work all the time. ie; if the squ1 is in a weird shape, the
        alg won&#x27;t work. My first idea was to learn the algs for piece
        swapping for all shapes. After hasty reconsideration I decided that
        it&#x27;d be much easyer to find an alg that works on every shape
        somehow that moves just two or three pieces around. This cannot be done
        with standard notation. I&#x27;m thinking, &#x27;move top layer two
        cuts(/pieces?) along, bottom one cut along and twist&#x27; Or find one
        alg you can use all the time, only in the middle, it changed depending
        on the shape of the top layer, then you&#x27;d only need to learn one
        alg and a few numbers to change depending on the shapes. Or course,
        there is surly a much easyer way. I can&#x27;t be bothered arbitarily
        remembering where the pieces are every turn. Maybe Lars V. can help shed
        some light on this situation. ~Thom

        you can use all the time, Maybe there&#x27;s a middle way, where you
        would convert your given shape to one of a small number standard shapes
        (whichever is closest), apply the alg to that standard shape, and then
        convert back again. But it doesn&#x27;t seem very hopeful: after all,
        swapping an edge and a corner /changes/ the shape. The brute-force
        &quot;method&quot; of following the pieces through the shape
        transformations mightn&#x27;t be too bad if one always used the same
        sequence to restore a given shape, and had a clear picture of that
        sequence in one&#x27;s head... but unfortunately I don&#x27;t. :( Mike

        around ten setup moves for it. Then think that you need to do setup
        moves to put the pieces in the right places to be swapped, I assume this

        well and with few moves. When you&#x27;#re changing it to a cube, you

        Ok, I&#x27;m starting to think this isn&#x27;t such a bad idea. To swap
        two pieces in any shape; Apply moves to turn into cube. (Remember pieces
        you wanna swap are) Apply setup moves to put the pieces into places for
        the alg. Do Swappy-move. Apply inverse setup moves. Apply moves to
        change into original shape. Problem: because you&#x27;ve swapped the
        pieces, the inverse of the changing to cube shape will require different
        moves. If we can solve the above problem, the Squ1BLD looks in reach.
        Possable improvment: Find an alg to swap two pieces that only turns the
        top layer. Then you only have to turn one layer of the squ1 into a cube
        shape to execute. ~Thom --- In

        Look at scrambled cube for a while, memorise it. Put on blindfold. Do
        moves so the solved cube looks like the scrambled one. Take off
        blindfold. Scramble: R&#x27; B&#x27; R2 B2 R&#x27; U&#x27; D F2 U2 F2

        B&#x27; F&#x27; - Well, this is a hell of a lot of fun. Slightly harder
        though. Here is a short description of what to do (in addition to the
        3-cycles method); Do permutation then orientation, do orientation of
        corners as normal. For corner orientation, memorise it so that you
        don&#x27;t do the move to fix the orientation, you do the move to get it
        to that orientation. Permutation: Memorise the cycles backwards,
        excluding the first number. Eg: 18572 becomes 12758. When fixing
        parity/cycling two set of corners, you can leave it alone. Eg: 34 is
        still 34. ~Kirjava&quot; Explantion is up there. Try it, it&#x27;s fun.

        of a lot of fun. Slightly harder though. Here is a short description of
        what to do (in addition to the 3-cycles method); Do permutation then
        orientation, do orientation of corners as normal. For corner
        orientation, memorise it so that you don&#x27;t do the move to fix the
        orientation, you do the move to get it to that orientation. Permutation:
        Memorise the cycles backwards, excluding the first number. Eg: 18572
        becomes 12758. When fixing parity/cycling two set of corners, you can
        leave it alone. Eg: 34 is still 34. ~Kirjava&quot; Explantion is up

        Got a harder challenge. Copy a scrambled cube onto a cube that is
        already scrambled differently blindfolded! Heres the twist; do it
        without passing through the solved phase. You can set this up into one
        easy memorisation. But it requres a lot of thinking. ~Thom --- In

        Well, it is interesting, but if you can do blindfold you can do it, it
        is not more dificult than solve a blindfold cube (it is diferent, but
        not more dificult). I&#x27;ll try to do it today. Carlos -------Mensaje

        I would break it up into two steps: First, do U2 F2. This puts the 5
        corner next to the 1 corner on the right side. Do a T-permutation that
        switches those two corners. Then do F2 U2 to put it back. Then, bring
        the 10 edge up by doing D F2. Do the H-permutation which switches all
        four edges. You&#x27;ll correct 3 and 10, and then fix 2 and 4 which
        were messed up in the T-permutation. I do almost all of my parity fixes

        it seems pochmann&#x27;s system does me well, well, to an extent.
        I&#x27;m still using cycles for the corners, but using his method for
        edges is nice. I don&#x27;t like the memorisation technique, so I do it
        differently. I remember everything spatially, ie. no
        number/letters/colours/pictures. And I just memorise which stickers to
        put in the target position in order. This feels amazingly fast for me
        and I can remember it faster than a sequence of potentionally 12 numbers
        or colours. If edges are in the right place but flipped, I just remember
        to flip them with the buffer edge at the end, or with another flipped in
        place cubie. The other fun thing is the parity. If I can solve the
        corners fully, I know there is none, but if two corners will be left
        flipped, I know there will be parity, so I just flip the corners back
        and flip the two in the buffer position at the same time. Then i can
        ignore anything pertaining to parity really, I don&#x27;t even have to
        count the length of the cycles of edges :) You lot probibly already know
        all this but I thought I&#x27;d share. I got excited after I began to be
        able to memorise edges faster than corners :P. Fastest I&#x27;ve solved
        now is 7:14 and I got a 5:38 DNF where two corners were twisted. Thanks,

        Hey everyone, Lately I&#x27;ve been trying to work on using my memory in
        situtations where I usually wouldn&#x27;t. For example I&#x27;m reading
        a book right now, and rather than use a bookmark I just remember the
        page number I am at when I stop. I&#x27;ve found that it takes less
        mental effort to remember the number and I can still recall it later
        when I come back, even if I don&#x27;t get a chance to read for a few
        days. Also for a few months now I have been memorizing friends phone
        numbers rather than putting them into my phone (I saw that suggestion
        from Tyson a while back somewhere). Do little things like this improve
        memory/recall? Specifically do they help for BLD cubing? Or is it just
        wishful thinking on my part? Chris

        Hi Chris, I&#x27;ve been working on &quot;one-pass&quot; memorization
        for memorizing the permutation. Right now I&#x27;m a bit slower at it,
        but I see the potential the memorize the entire permutation of the cube
        in 20 seconds or less. I believe that the average memorization time of
        the cube can be done in average of 30 seconds or less. The idea of
        one-pass memorization is that you only go through the cycles once and
        after that, you&#x27;re done. I&#x27;ve been able to do it for maybe 60%
        of the cubes I try to solve if I go slowly. Of course, my times right
        now are a bit slower because I&#x27;m incorporating new things, but I
        think the memorization time of the permutations is starting to become
        equal... and I&#x27;m going through at a slow rate for the permutation
        memorization right now. Perhaps try breaking down the cube into smaller
        parts and seeing if you can remember those parts with less and less
        study time. Memorizing a page in a book is certainly different. You only
        need to hold the information of a cube for about 60 seconds... or until
        you solve that part of the cube. I think the memory olympiads have some
        java applets you can use to practice memorizing digits of numbers that
        flash by at a rate of 1 per second. I should give that another shot.
        Though, it does seem like I&#x27;m the only person left in the world who
        uses numbers. Though, I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t hurt to remember the
        license plate number of that idiot in the green Honda SUV who cut you
        off on the highway... or the Pasadena police car who was parked in a
        handicapped spot. I think it was 1007069... but that was like, maybe
        half a year ago. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology

        I think i too have a similar situation. I basically suck at

        address everyone as &quot;friend&quot;. Anyways, so it happened one day
        we had to memorise the different hardness of some substances, normally i
        would have skipped that part and left it to luck, but i thought i do BLD
        so i sould be able to do this too, and tried doing it. To my amazement
        memorising those numbers was quite a peace for me while others sweated
        over it. :) I dunno why its happened though i think its mostly
        pshychological. But still its nice to know that my memory is not that
        bad as i thought it was. Anyways i too use numbers for memorisation so
        Tyson ur not alone :D For me making a story is quite time consuming.
        Actually i use numbers + letters for the edges. For me the edge cycles
        were getting monotonous, so i thought lets add some letters and it would
        help memorisation, so i label the middle layer edges as A, B, C, D,
        starting from FR , FL , BL and BR. Keep blding! Sachin. --- Tyson Mao

        I&#x27;ve been working on &quot;one-pass&quot; memorization for
        memorizing the permutation. Right now I&#x27;m a bit slower at it, but I
        see the potential the memorize the entire permutation of the cube in 20
        seconds or less. I believe that the average memorization time of the
        cube can be done in average of 30 seconds or less. The idea of one-pass
        memorization is that you only go through the cycles once and after that,
        you&#x27;re done. I&#x27;ve been able to do it for maybe 60% of the
        cubes I try to solve if I go slowly. Of course, my times right now are a
        bit slower because I&#x27;m incorporating new things, but I think the
        memorization time of the permutations is starting to become equal... and
        I&#x27;m going through at a slow rate for the permutation memorization
        right now. Perhaps try breaking down the cube into smaller parts and
        seeing if you can remember those parts with less and less study time.
        Memorizing a page in a book is certainly different. You only need to
        hold the information of a cube for about 60 seconds... or until you
        solve that part of the cube. I think the memory olympiads have some java
        applets you can use to practice memorizing digits of numbers that flash
        by at a rate of 1 per second. I should give that another shot. Though,
        it does seem like I&#x27;m the only person left in the world who uses
        numbers. Though, I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t hurt to remember the
        license plate number of that idiot in the green Honda SUV who cut you
        off on the highway... or the Pasadena police car who was parked in a
        handicapped spot. I think it was 1007069... but that was like, maybe
        half a year ago. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology

        You have to see this way. For example, if you have to permute edges in
        the order, say , 851094, instead of remembering so many meaningless
        numbers, you can remember one meaningful word - feldspar- which will
        tell you the numbers in the same order. Numbers can not be visualized .
        So it is difficult to remember. But meaningful words can be remembered
        much better. Number the pieces. Check the order by which it has to be
        solved. To remember the order, convert them into meaningful words.
        Decode the words into numbers when you are actually solving the cube.

        Hi John, Unfortunately this is nowhere near fast enough for blindfold
        solving. If we want to memorize the cube in 40 seconds, we don&#x27;t
        have time to transpose the group of numbers into one solid word. At
        best, we could translate groups of 2 or 3 numbers into words, but even
        that takes time. I think the fastest memorization times will be achieved
        when we can remember 851094 in one look or pass and just hold onto that
        meaningless garbage in our minds long enough to complete the solve. 8-5
        goes diagonal on my cube, 10 is 2*5, walks to 9 on the bottom and then
        jumps diagonally to 4... (which is why I use both numbers and the
        shape.) Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On Nov 11,

        It is possible to memorise the cube in 30 sec. Bernett is doing it in 40
        to 60 sec. There is no need to convert at the time of memorising because
        all the words for different numbers are fixed already. For example 914
        is battery, 357 is milk 6,0 ,12 is chosen 11, 8, 2 is tiffin is etc.
        Once you have mastered the phonetic sound and value system and either
        learn to convert quickly on the spot or you have pre-determined word for
        every combination, you will be the fastest man again!!! As Stefan said
        try 4*4*4 and 5*5*5 blindfolded after meeting the cute girl PHYSICS GRE
        on saturday. You might understand the utility and validity of this
        system. John Louis Tyson Mao &lt;tmao@...> wrote: Hi John, Unfortunately
        this is nowhere near fast enough for blindfold solving. If we want to
        memorize the cube in 40 seconds, we don&#x27;t have time to transpose
        the group of numbers into one solid word. At best, we could translate
        groups of 2 or 3 numbers into words, but even that takes time. I think
        the fastest memorization times will be achieved when we can remember
        851094 in one look or pass and just hold onto that meaningless garbage
        in our minds long enough to complete the solve. 8-5 goes diagonal on my
        cube, 10 is 2*5, walks to 9 on the bottom and then jumps diagonally to
        4... (which is why I use both numbers and the shape.) Tyson Mao MSC #631

        Hey everyone, I had my second successful 4x4x4 BLD solve today. The
        first time I did the 4x4x4 supercube and used a completely stupid and
        horrible method. It took me 5 and a half hours the first time including
        memorization (I can&#x27;t even describe how stupid and dumb my approach
        was when I did this two years ago). This time I wanted to try a regular
        4x4x4 so that I had to choose how to cycle the centers (you have no
        choice for the supercube). I used the cycles method and my new and
        improved knowledge of commutators since the last time and successfully
        BLD solved a regular 4x4x4 in 1 hour 39 minutes! It took me 57 minutes
        to memorize and 42 to solve. Funny story actually. I meant to time the
        whole thing more exactly on my Stackmat (?!) but realized about 30
        minutes in that the Stackmat turns off after 10 minutes ;-) I noted the
        time I started on my alarm clock though, so I just timed with that. The
        2005 RWC really motivated me to improve my blindfolding skills
        (it&#x27;s one of events that I really do care about that I sadly
        neglect the most in order to work on generic speedcubing). My goal is to
        do the 4x4x4 blindfolded in competition sometime soon, so I will be
        doing this much more often. I also want to solve the 5x5x5 (and 5x5x5
        supercube eventually too) blindfolded as well. Maybe a long time from
        now I would want a competition 5x5 BLD solve too. One day.. Anyway many
        thanks to Dror, who gave me some tips for regular 4x4x4 BLD at RWC last
        weekend. Dror, at 2003WC you taught me how to BLD and got me addicted.
        Now at 2005WC you got me addicted to big cube BLD :-P Seriously though,
        Dror you are a huge inspiration to me, so thanks for all your help. Heh
        heh, well I am confident that I can BLD the 4x4x4 supercube and regular
        cube (regular is harder in my opinion), so now I am on to get sub-1 hour
        for both :-D Just wanted to share, as I was very excited to finally BLD
        solve the harder of the two 4x4x4 versions :-) Chris

        Hey Sachin, I say the 4x4x4 supercube is easier for BLD since the
        centers have one set cycle that you can&#x27;t change. Each piece can
        only end up in one spot, so you just read off the cycle(s) and memorize
        it without doing any thinking. For regular 4x4x4 solving each center has
        4 potential spots it could end up in. So you have to think about which
        centers to put where. Sure this can be mastered if you&#x27;re someone
        who does big cube BLD a lot to your advantage, but it&#x27;s still extra
        thought work and thus harder in my opinion. It&#x27;s fun though! I want
        to get better at cycling the regular centers around :-) This big cube
        BLD stuff is really fun actually! Chris --- In

        Having do decide and keeping track of which pieces you&#x27;ve decided
        for yet is a whole extra task and an ugly one. I did practice this (just
        the analysis, without memorization/solving) before my first 5x5
        blindfold attempt (at the European championship 2004) but I didn&#x27;t
        in the meantime until my second attempt (at the world championship last
        weekend). For this, I deserved to fail. Just trying to analyze and
        memorize the +-centers took me 45-50 minutes. Disgusting. I&#x27;m such

        I just did a 4x4x4 BLD solve that failed. I was close except I had about
        5 center pieces out of place, and 4 edge pieces. I had also undid my
        very last either setup move or inner layer move incorrectly, leaving an
        outer face almost completely solved, but off by 1 quarter turn.
        I&#x27;ve noticed that inner turns are hard to remember. Is it better to
        always do inner layer turns with your finger, turning just the inner
        layer, or the double layer followed by the outer layer? I noticed that
        sometimes I would do one and sometimes the other, leaving me confused as
        to whether I need to fix the outer layer or not (I think this is what
        happened with my last setup move). I think it would be best to always do
        it one way, what do you guys think? Also I had a question about
        memorizing. Since the centers require so much decision making I memorize
        them using numbers. However, for the edges and corners I just memorize
        where the pieces go. This seems to work well for me for the edges, since
        I can just form shapes inside the cube to follow the pieces. I did try
        to solve the centers just by remembering where the pieces go, but the
        shapes are all very skinny &quot;X&quot; shapes that are all the same,
        so it was hard and I switched to numbers. The solve would have been a 71
        minute solve had I not messed up. I memorized in 31 minutes this time
        which was faster than my 57 from earlier. Anyway I am very serious about
        getting good at 4x4x4 BLD solving, and I wanted to know if any of you
        pro big cube solvers had any tips for anything really. I&#x27;m curious
        to know how you guys memorize and how you execute inner layer turns the
        most. I definitely use this formula for my solving A X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27;
        A&#x27; I have names for each part too and I say them outloud so I can
        remember where I am at in the commutator when cycling pieces. Since the
        commutators are all intuitive I find it better to use ways to not get
        lost than to memorize algs for specific situations. Well I&#x27;m
        definitely getting into this big cube BLD stuff and as a newbie I&#x27;m
        looking for tips :-D Thank in advance, Chris

        you guys think? YES! Not remembering whether I have to undo (Rr) or (r)
        has been a major pain for me in the past. So I decided to always just
        turn the inner layer unless I specifically want the outer layer to turn
        with it (in order to move a second piece at the same time which I try to
        avoid, though). That&#x27;s the mental part. My fingers still do (r) as
        (Rr)R&#x27;. > I definitely use this formula for my solving > A X Y
        X&#x27; Y&#x27; A&#x27; Yep, that&#x27;s what I do, too. I&#x27;m too
        lazy to learn algorithms so I rather use a very small set of commutators
        that I understand and can adjust on the fly, surrounded by setup moves.

        remember where I am at in the commutator when cycling pieces. Hooray for
        talking to ourselves! I do it all the time, literally commenting every
        single turn! But I don&#x27;t think Dror does, or else he must be
        speaking extremely fast :-) Keep us updated about your thoughts and
        progress! Cheers! Stefan

        Hey Stefan, I just attempted another solve and got it successfully! It
        took 56 minutes 53.36 seconds, which is about 42 minutes off my previous
        record :-D Some more comments below. > YES! Not remembering whether I

        part. My fingers still do (r) as > (Rr)R&#x27;. I definitely have a set
        standard now, and also it is thanks to your comments above. I also now
        only ever turn the inner layers when doing setup moves, and I do them as
        (Rr)R&#x27; etc.. I also like to call out my setup moves outloud so I
        can have some sort of auditory memory of it as well as just mental
        inside my head. I call inner slice turn as &quot;little [face]&quot; so
        if I had to do f2 R as a setup I would say &quot;little f2 R&quot; which
        helps me remember whether a setup turn was an inner layer or outer
        layer. Also I&#x27;m going to change my memorizing order, but not
        solving order. lately I&#x27;ve been memorizing corners, edges, centers
        and solving as corners, edges, centers. I think now I will memorize as
        centers, edges, corners, then solve as corners, edges, centers. I
        memorize the centers as numbers which is better able to withstand
        interference from memorizing other things to me. I&#x27;m really getting
        addicted to 4x4 BLD now, it&#x27;s awesome! I can&#x27;t wait until
        I&#x27;ve gotten a little better and it doesn&#x27;t take an hour at
        least to do. I want to be able to do at least one solve a day. Stefan
        what are your times like, and how long did it take you to get there?
        Alright well thanks for the advice, it really helped me! Hope to be in
        the 30 minute or less range one day, that&#x27;s my goal :-) Chris

        Hey everyone, I just did two solves right now, both were DNF but
        they&#x27;re getting faster. The first one was 32 minutes but I had like
        8 centers out of place and 2 corners swapped. The second one was 24
        minutes, but I had two centers swapped (!!!). I did (3 5 23) during
        center permutation instead of (3 6 23) since I am still getting used to
        my coordinate system. I think the secret to 4x4 BLD is to go fast and
        not worry about failing. I had LOTS of delays during the 24 minute
        solve, and I really belive that sub-10 minutes is possible with super
        fast memorization and break neck solving speed (as a limit to 4x4 BLD
        that is). I mean I&#x27;m only up to my 5th solve and I&#x27;m at 24
        minutes (DNF but sitll close. If only I had done (3 6 23) aaaaaah!!!!).
        I really think my next successful solve will be sub-20 mins. I&#x27;m
        going to try to go full speed on both parts. I need to get some rest
        tonight, but tomorrow I will do some more solves. Maybe I am just being
        over ambitious, but I mean I consider myself a beginner at this, and
        having such a close call convincingly sub-30min solve makes me think I
        can go much faster. I really like memorizing as centers, edges, corners.
        One reason I really like this is that with careful rotation of the cube
        you can get up to 8 centers already solved. For both of these solves I
        was able to get 8 solved centers right from the start just by careful
        examination and rotation of the cube. So I will now memorize centers,
        edges, corners and solve in reverse. Also since corners are easiest you
        can memorize superfast and not worry about having to hold it in your
        head long. I can very easily see sub-20 minutes with a little more
        practice. Aaaah!!!! This is so addicting!!!! I&#x27;ll try again
        tomorrow and see how it goes, wish me luck! Chris

        Of course you have our best wishes :) I really laughed when u said that
        the dnf&#x27;s are getting faster :D Ofcourse i know what u meant but
        still, it feels funny. Anyway so do u use commutators for solving the
        4x4x4 bld like the 3x3x3? if yes then what is ur order of solving, i
        mean do u solve centers then edges then corners or something else? And
        whats the time you take for memorisation? i think it should be around
        10-12 minutes or so? that leaves another 10 muinutes for the solve. Hope
        u get a sub 20 non-dnf solve quickly :) Sachin. --- cmhardw

        I attempted 8 solves for 4x4x4 BLD today and all 8 were DNF&#x27;s. Only
        one ended up completely scrambled (I messed up on my first step, solving
        corners) most of them only had 2-3 edges and of place and sometimes also
        2-3 centers as well. My closest solve was 2 centers out of place, where
        I did the last center cycle incorrectly. It&#x27;s extremely frustrating
        to fail so many times in a row, but every time I go back over my solve
        and find where I went wrong the frustration helps me to remember not to
        make that mistake again. Well, I know that a DNF solve is just as much
        practice as a successful solve, since it locates problems, but I still
        want another successful one. I&#x27;ve been trying to go fast instead of
        careful, but towards the end I slowed down a bit to slow-fast. All of
        the times were sub-32min had I been successful, and my fastest was a 21
        min with 3 edges and 3 centers out of place (but I thought I was done).
        Did anyone else learning 4x4 BLD have such a hard time learning? I mean
        I&#x27;m not going to give up, as I really want to be able to do this,
        but man it is a downer to fail so many times in a row. Oh well, at least
        I can say that I have learned a LOT about 4x4 BLD from my practice
        today, and tomorrow is always another day. I hope to be posting a
        sub-30min time very soon, but I guess I still have much to learn. Chris

        I totally know that feeling. When i was first trying 3x3x3 bld, there
        was noone here to watch my solves and tell where i went wrong, so after
        learning the whole method i did around 50+ solves, all of them
        dnf&#x27;s ... that too in a span of just 1-2 days. But somehow the
        dnf&#x27;s made my resolution to get it right more stronger. anyway, you
        say that in one of the solves you messed up in the orientation itself.
        How do you know that...do you tell anyone to watch over you while
        solving or do you record yourself and then see it again? Or is there
        some better method? Best of luck to your solves, i bet in 1-2 days
        you&#x27;ll open your eyes to a fully solved 4x4x4 :) Sachin. ---

        have to memorize in two minutes, or solve in negative 1 minute, to even

        Hello Chris uncle, I think , like me, you also have become an addict to
        BLD solving. For the last six month before wc-2005, I was practicing BLD
        4*4*4 and 5*5*5. You may be learning from DNF solve. But for me it is
        frustrating especially when one pair of pieces are misplaced at the end.
        I enjoy whenever I finish correctly eventhough time taken is more. I am
        following stefan&#x27;s single algm method and my dad&#x27;s
        memorisation technique. My success rate is very good now. My best time
        so far is 26 min 19 sec.What method you are following? Could you plz
        share with me uncle ? Bernett Orlando cmhardw &lt;foozman17@...> wrote:
        I attempted 8 solves for 4x4x4 BLD today and all 8 were DNF&#x27;s. Only
        one ended up completely scrambled (I messed up on my first step, solving
        corners) most of them only had 2-3 edges and of place and sometimes also
        2-3 centers as well. My closest solve was 2 centers out of place, where
        I did the last center cycle incorrectly. It&#x27;s extremely frustrating
        to fail so many times in a row, but every time I go back over my solve
        and find where I went wrong the frustration helps me to remember not to
        make that mistake again. Well, I know that a DNF solve is just as much
        practice as a successful solve, since it locates problems, but I still
        want another successful one. I&#x27;ve been trying to go fast instead of
        careful, but towards the end I slowed down a bit to slow-fast. All of
        the times were sub-32min had I been successful, and my fastest was a 21
        min with 3 edges and 3 centers out of place (but I thought I was done).
        Did anyone else learning 4x4 BLD have such a hard time learning? I mean
        I&#x27;m not going to give up, as I really want to be able to do this,
        but man it is a downer to fail so many times in a row. Oh well, at least
        I can say that I have learned a LOT about 4x4 BLD from my practice
        today, and tomorrow is always another day. I hope to be posting a
        sub-30min time very soon, but I guess I still have much to learn. Chris

        Hey Bernett, First off let me say that your times for BLD are very
        impressive! Particularly that you are so young amazes me :-) You&#x27;re
        an inspiration to other BLD cubers like me :-) Sure I can tell you about
        my 4x4 BLD method, though I&#x27;ve just started so I don&#x27;t know if
        it the best way to do it. The very first thing I do when the time starts
        is to try to rotate the cube to get as many &quot;solved&quot; centers
        as I can. I always solve the 3x3x3 BLD in the same orientation, and I
        use that same one for 4x4x4. I can usually get 6-8 centers solved right
        from the start, sometimes even as many as 9. After that I memorize the
        centers cycles using numbers (I&#x27;m thinking about switching to
        letters so I can make a story and remember it more quickly. I&#x27;ll
        try this on my next solve). Then I memorize the edge permutation just by
        where the pieces go. I connect two adjacent spots in the cycle by lines
        in my head and follow the shapes of those lines as the cycle runs
        through. The corners I just use the same technique as for 3x3x3, I
        memorize the permutation as lines same as the edges, and orientation I
        just take a quick mental snapshot, since it is the first thing I solve.
        I use commutators and 3-cycles to solve the centers and edges, and the
        usual stuff from 3x3x3 supercube BLD for the corners (so I don&#x27;t
        affect the center rotations). I&#x27;m curious how you use Stefan&#x27;s
        method to solve the centers or edges, that is really interesting to me.
        How exactly do you use his idea for 4x4x4? As far as the commutators go,
        I mean here is an example. I just do them on the fly during a solve, I
        don&#x27;t have any memorized algs for this. Say the first three edges
        of my cycle are lUB -> bUL -> rDF I need to get two of of them on the
        same layer and one off that layer as the setup. So I would do (L r) as
        my setup move. Now the cycle is uFL -> rUF -> lUB My commutator for that
        is X = U2 Y = B&#x27;u2B So I do XYX&#x27;Y&#x27; = (U2) (B&#x27; u2 B)
        (U2) (B&#x27; u2 B) then undo my setup with L&#x27; r&#x27;. I do the
        same type of thing for centers. Get two on the same face (anywhere) then
        the third center on an adjacent face. Then I just come up with a
        commutator that moves them. Again I don&#x27;t know how efficient that
        is, especially the memorization. I don&#x27;t claim to be any kind of
        memory expert, so I could probably use a lot of work on that. I&#x27;m
        curious what you think of my memorization technique, since you&#x27;re
        using such a really nice system. I&#x27;d be curious what the best way
        to improve my memorization is. Good luck with all your future BLD
        efforts, and keep it up with getting those good times ;-) Chris --- In

        Wow, so I&#x27;ve totally jacked the group for 4x4x4 BLD posts. I hope
        everyone doesn&#x27;t mind :-S Anyway I&#x27;ve been thinking about
        memorization for the 4x4x4 centers, and though I probably should use
        letters and form words, I really like working with numbers. I can use
        operators like addition subtraction, things like prime numbers, divsors,
        etc. to form relations between consecutive numbers. I&#x27;ve found that
        I memorize quickest to learn 4 pieces in a cycle, then take time to
        remember them, then do 4 more pieces. If there aren&#x27;t 4 to end the
        cycle then I just do the last amount. I also really like just remember
        where edges go, so I don&#x27;t have two sets of numbers, of I prefer
        this to letters since it is easy for me to just remember where they
        move. I just got a new pb solve of 26 minutes 4.60 seconds successfully!
        I know I can still go much faster with my method, but I need to work on
        speeding up my solve and memorization. For the 26 minute solve I
        memorized in about 13:40 and solved in about 12:24 so my individual
        steps are getting faster. I&#x27;ve noticed that it really helps me to
        just not worry about whether or not the solve is a DNF or not. If I
        worry, I will usually get nervous and confuse whether or not I need to
        finish with a slice turn or an edge insert step for my commutators and
        just mess everything up. It&#x27;s better to just trust your memory and
        visualizing of where the pieces are and to just solve. Well, I guess
        I&#x27;ll quiet down for a while, now that I am getting a better success
        rate and better times I just need to practice more. I do hope for sub-20
        minutes soon though :-) Thanks everyone for the help, this group is
        awesome ;-D Chris

        ou des link (the no name). Il me semble que les jeunes se rangent peu à
        peu avec moi quand je vais sur les forums. Quand je verrai mon lien sur
        les engish webmaster comme Stefan, Macky, Andy, Bob or many other
        excellent cuber disons 1/5, j&#x27;irai au WC 2007. Sinon enlevez mon
        adresse. Le cube n&#x27;a pas la noblesse ni la richesse de la chess
        game mais il est merveilleux. Vous avez une méthode alors vous êtes déjà
        un magicien et personne ne sait que vos centres ont tournées sur eux-
        mêmes, vous devriez avoir honte de cacher mon nom. The old boss at the
        WCA and the young Tyson, imagine my trick at your city (priority on the
        others) in 1993 not 2005! For your friend, Akimoto I tooked this link a

        and him too !. Tu merites plus d&#x27;honneurs. Pour ton système et pour

        I tooked this link along time ago not him. I request a minimum not a
        favorite link !!! Do you see many good french website with the cube.
        J&#x27;ai cru entendre dire par Lars P. que sa méthode est inutilement
        complexe. Si vous aimez l&#x27;usage élégante de M par U alors imaginez
        combien une méthode 2x2x2 demande le M avec le cube. Finally, at the
        third point of the triangle there is the Instrument of Betrayal. This is
        the person who apparently enters an already existing relationship
        between two people and threatens to destroy or change it. This point of
        the triangle usually gets a rather bad press, being seen as
        &quot;predatory&quot; or a taker of someone else&#x27;s beloved
        possession. If we happen to occupy this point, we may receive only
        limited sympathy, and none at all from those in established
        relationships who feel the cold wind (boss wca) of their own possible
        future.. In fact, the Instrument of Betrayal may feel himself or herself
        to be a victim, and may perceive the Betrayed as the predator. We can
        begin to glimpse the secret identity between these two points of the
        triangle (Liz Greene). I respect the WCA but him disrespect my
        difference. N&#x27;attendez pas mon retour avec 3 master de la chess
        game + one grand master car il vous feront honte à mon avantage. Ils
        attendent votre réaction. Un pour tous et tous pour un et le cube sera
        encore plus populaire, vous n&#x27;avez rien vu. Oui je suis un
        speedcuber blindfold mais ma magie devrait suffire à vos esprits
        enfermer dans une intelligence uniquement logique avec un cube. Les
        animaux sont plus intelligent que nous L&#x27;humain recherche trop le
        pouvoir et il détruit la planète, il est le plus grand microbe car il
        veut copier se que le nature fait d&#x27;elle-même, il va payer le prix.
        Einstein avait raison l&#x27;imagination dépasse l&#x27;intelligence. Il
        était un scientifique mais il a une perception comme M.Rubik car je
        pense que vous ne voyez que la performance de vos records. Allons voyons
        il y a tellement de variété de record avec le cube et il ne sera jamais
        poupulaire autant que la chess game. Ce n&#x27;est pas la publicité et
        les championnats qui ont vendu le cube à ses débuts, sa vente a été
        magique. Ne croyez-vous pas qu&#x27;il serait bon de parler d&#x27;un
        cubiste magique ou d&#x27;une différence. Pourquoi faire voir toujours
        les mêmes noms et les mêmes choses ? Dror Vomberg was not even a twinkle
        in his mother&#x27;s eye during the Rubik&#x27;s ...He once saw a man
        doing the puzzle behind his back and was inspired to try. &quot;I

      <strong>249. just swapping 2 pieces</strong><br />

        If you know my blindfold method then you know I&#x27;m solving pieces
        one by one, swapping two pieces. But I also swap two certain pieces of
        the other type (edges or corners) as an annoying unwanted &quot;side
        effect&quot; because I have to. Well, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve thought
        until this weekend. Here&#x27;s how to swap the edges UR&lt;->LU without
        changing any other edges or corners: R E R D2 R&#x27; E&#x27; R D2 R2 S
        This is the first algorithm I came up with, I could imagine there are
        shorter/faster ones. Can someone find a better one? How about one for
        corners? No idea how practical this could be but I like it a lot from a
        theoretical point of view so I thought I&#x27;d mention it. Cheers!

        a good idea, but wouldn&#x27;t that make it so you&#x27;d have to
        remember the locations of the centers as well? By doing that, you might
        end up with a 6-spot configuration if you aren&#x27;t extremely careful.

        I&#x27;d only use algorithms that rotate the centers in one slice and in
        one direction, e.g. always only the S-slice in the direction of an
        S-turn. Then after solving all edges and corners, the cube is either
        solved or you need to add e.g. (M2 S M2 S&#x27;). To determine whether
        you have to do that, count the number of steps modulo 4. Alternatively,
        you could have two algorithms for each case, one that rotates the
        centers in one direction, one for the other direction. Then start with
        the centers solved and alternate the direction of the center rotations
        by choosing the appropriate algs. Hey, I just noticed another advantage
        of this. It pretty much gives you four cube orientations to choose from
        for free. For example, if you solve so that yellow ends up on top and
        orange on front, you can in the beginning orient the cube as a whole so
        that the yellow center is on top and the orange is on front. But you can
        just as well rotate the whole cube around the z-axis so that the yellow
        center is on R, D or L. Just pick the one that looks easiest to solve
        (e.g. most edges and corners already solved or fewest correctly placed
        but with bad orientation). Cheers! Stefan

        Hello stefan, Pardon my ignorance but i dont get it. The holy grail algo
        u gave, it does change the orientation of the ur and ul edges, but the
        centers get switched too. So souldnt that be another burden to remember?
        And unless u have another similar algo which flips corners and reverses
        the centers, how are you going th get the centers back where they are?
        P.S. currently use the cycle method, but im going to look into your
        method once my exam ends. Sachin. Michael Zener Riggs Gottlieb

        Hmm...I&#x27;m still confused... If I did the alg correctly, the UR and

        about. Yep, that&#x27;s the idea. You start with the centers correct and
        will automatically end up with them correct again. I played a bit with
        ACube and came up with this algorithm which is I think faster: U L&#x27;
        R D F U r&#x27; B&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; r&#x27; d&#x27; R It
        also swaps two &quot;diagonally opposite&quot; edges (UB&lt;->DF), which
        is better because it&#x27;ll make setup moves shorter. I just need one
        more that swaps (UB&lt;->FD) and then the average number of setup moves
        for edges will be (2*0+12*1+8*2)/22 = 1.27 moves. And then a similar
        algorithm for corners, i.e. that swaps the centers the same way and
        swaps two diagonally opposite corners, resulting in (1*0+9*1+11*2)/21 =
        1.41 setup moves on average for corners. Adding two more for the other
        orientations of the corners would even drop this average to
        (3*0+18*1)/21 = 0.86 moves. Btw, Sachin, my method is also a cycle
        method. Just probably in smaller steps than you&#x27;re currently used
        to. Cheers! Stefan

        They&#x27;re only swapped. The idea of &quot;flipped&quot; edges for me
        only exists for edges that are at the correct place. The algorithm I
        showed simply swaps UR and LU (or equivalently you can think of it as

        Overall, for solving all edges and all corners, you&#x27;ll always need
        an even number of swaps of two pieces. Now do the algorithm twice and
        look what happens. The cube will be solved again. So yes, after an odd
        number of swaps the centers will be out of place, but after an even
        number of swaps they&#x27;ll be in place again, particularly at the very

        U&#x27; B L2 F&#x27; R&#x27; D r2 u D And here&#x27;s a corresponding

        B&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; r&#x27; d&#x27; R I didn&#x27;t let
        ACube finish the computations and I had to integrate the center
        rotations by hand and didn&#x27;t spend much time on it so there are
        almost certainly better algs for the same effects. Also, I&#x27;d prefer
        to use the DB edge and the DBL corner as buffer pieces and as targets
        the UF edge and URF corner places with all their orientations. Then
        setup moves for the corners would only be an U, R or F turn, and setup
        moves for the edges would usually be an F or U turn, sometimes with an L
        or R turn beforehand. Quick summary for the method: - 5 algs to learn -
        on average 1.07 setup turns, worst case 2 quarter turns - setup turns
        only in &lt;U,R,F,L> - ignore parity Cheers! Stefan

        those algorithms look quite unfriendly! Yeah, that&#x27;s the main
        reason I said &quot;No idea how practical this could be but I like it a
        lot from a theoretical point of view&quot;. I wish ACube could search
        with double-layer twists and moving centers and I wish my computer were
        fast enough to complete a search in less than let&#x27;s say an hour.
        Then maybe we could find nice optimal algs in for example
        &lt;U,R,F,u,r,f>. But I&#x27;ve already let it search with all six sides
        allowed to turn and I stopped it at I think 17 QTM and 15 HTM, so those
        are lower bounds and they&#x27;re quite high, too high to win against my
        current method whose only disadvantage is that I can&#x27;t completely
        ignore the parity issue but have to do an easy check and fix. Cheers!

        Not to beat this into the ground, but I wanted to ask about something. I
        remember J. Bernett Orlando and Stefan using nouns and images together
        to make a story for memorization. I use this technique whenever I have
        to memorize a list, or a sequence of things in the real world. I find it
        odd that I never thought to do this for the 4x4x4. I just came up with
        24 nouns and have just finished memorizing the new scheme (I used to use
        numbers). I just did my first centers solve successfully with the new
        memorization technique, so now I&#x27;m ready to do a full solve.
        Anyway, I have a feeling this will be much faster than the numbers
        scheme I used to use, since I tailored my nouns to easily be able to
        make really funny/silly stories which makes it easier to memorize.
        Alright, well I was just curious what others thought about nouns vs.
        numbers. I definitely seem to prefer nouns now. Chris

        A while ago I found that (M&#x27; U)*4 is a pretty good tool for edge
        flips. It flips UL, UB, DF, and DB. If you do ((M&#x27; U)*4 +
        [clockwise 120-degree rotation through FLU/BRD axis])*3, you get the
        superflip. If you do (M&#x27; U)*3 M&#x27; U2 (M&#x27; U)*3 M&#x27;, you
        flip UF and UB. If you do (M&#x27; U)*3 M&#x27; U&#x27; (M&#x27; U)*3
        M&#x27; U&#x27;, as stated before by Pedro, you flip UF, UL, UR, and UB.
        If you do (M&#x27; U)*4 z2 (M&#x27; U)*4 z2, you again flip UF, UL, UR,
        and UB. Pretty versatile, if you ask me. :-) The only thing it
        doesn&#x27;t really like to do is flip two *adjacent* edges. For
        example: if you do z2 (M&#x27; U)*4 x2 (M&#x27; U)*3 M&#x27; U2 (M&#x27;
        U)*3 M&#x27; x2 z2, you can flip UF and UR. --qqwref

        Hey everyone, I just DNF&#x27;ed another 4x4 solve. I must have
        DNF&#x27;d about 15 consecutive solves by now. Several times I&#x27;ve
        forgotten to swap two corners in the end and nothing else. Most of the
        times I am off by 2-3 centers and/or 2-3 edges. I have only once ended
        with a half scrambled cube. I feel that I am learning new things every
        time, and that eventually I will be able to do this without DNF&#x27;ing
        so often. Has anyone else taken so incredibly long to get used to 4x4
        BLD? I&#x27;m not trying to be careful, but rather to go fast and get a
        good time. I want to get my brain used to this speed, rather than going
        slow and just getting a solve but taking almost half again as long to do
        it. So far my story method for the centers allows me to do one time
        through memorizing, since it&#x27;s easy for my brain to remember a
        story compared to a sequence of numbers. I very consistently memorize in
        11-14 minutes and the whole solve (if they weren&#x27;t DNFs) take me
        about 21-24 minutes. I&#x27;m not going to give up on this, but man oh
        man is it hard to learn how to do. I&#x27;ve started taking pictures of
        my solves, and on the last one I messed up the corners step and had two
        centers swapped in the end. I&#x27;m going to keep taking pictures to
        hopefully learn more. Can&#x27;t wait to get over the learning curve and
        start getting fast successful solves. Hey all you other 4x4 BLDers how
        is your progress going? I need some encouragement lol, is anyone else
        going through this too, or am I just a slow learner like usual? ;-)

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I finally got another 4x4 BLD solve successfully.
        It&#x27;s actually my new record at 24 minutes 10.61 seconds. I decided
        to go a bit slower than I had been going on memorization, but still go
        full speed on the solving. Anyway, I had gotten some requests for a
        sample 4x4x4 BLD solve, and I wanted to wait until I got a successful
        one so I could talk about it practically, rather than in theory.
        Here&#x27;s the scramble: F R&#x27; b2 L2 r&#x27; B2 R&#x27; L&#x27;
        F&#x27; U&#x27; b d f2 d&#x27; B&#x27; R&#x27; u R2 b u2 F&#x27; l L f
        B&#x27; D U&#x27; r2 F2 L u2 b r2 u2 B&#x27; R d&#x27; f&#x27; B&#x27; d
        The first thing I do is to get as many centers solved as I can. My color
        scheme that I solve to is yellow on top and green on front. Do the
        rotation z right now (rotate the whole cube as if you&#x27;re doing the
        move F). This gets 7 centers solved right off the bat. Ok now I have to
        memorize the centers. The cycle I used is (lbU -> ruF -> rbU -> buL ->
        lfU -> brD -> dbL -> ufR -> blD -> frU - > frD -> ubR -> fdL -> lfD ->
        ruB -> dlF -> luB) The notation means the only piece on the intersection
        of the three slices named. The piece lbU is the only piece on the
        intersection of &quot;l&quot; &quot;b&quot; and &quot;U&quot;. I have
        names for each spot, using the name my list is (Larry -> airplane ->
        Batman -> Giraffe -> the Terminator -> Book -> Alligator -> the South
        Pole -> sword -> Spiderman -> rubber duckie - > Classroom/Lecture Hall
        -> hamster -> chair -> skydiving -> the back to the future III train
        time machine -> mountaineering) And the story I made up is: LARRY is the
        pilot of an AIRPLANE and accidently flies it into BATMAN, who was in
        freefall in the air. Meanwhile, below the plane accident, a GIRAFFE is
        hunting the TERMINATOR, who is reading a BOOK with a picture of an
        ALLIGATOR on it. The Giraffe kicks the Terminator to the SOUTH POLE.
        Once he gets his bearings straight the Terminator draws a SWORD to do
        battle with SPIDERMAN, who unfortunately is only armed with a RUBBER
        DUCKIE. This pans out to a CLASSROOM where the students were watching
        this on a discovery channel episode. Suddenly a giant HAMSTER rips
        through the roof and starts ripping apart the classroom and CHAIRs are
        flying everywhere. Meanwhile, above, a SKYDIVER in midair falls into the
        wood storage car of the BACK TO THE FUTURE TRAIN TIME MACHINE. Just when
        he realizes where he is the time machine flies into a MOUNTAIN and
        explodes. I know the story is really dumb and silly, but that is exactly
        why it is easy to remember. I read a lot about memory, and one of the
        techniques is not only to make a story silly, but also to try to make it
        shocking. That&#x27;s why I have the train explode, and the hamster
        destroy the classroom with students in it. It&#x27;s sound weird, but
        the technique says that whatever makes you laugh, or shocks you, is
        easier to remember. Ok, so those are the centers. The edges cycle as:
        (lUB -> fUR -> uFL -> dFR -> uBL -> dBL -> fDL -> rFU -> uBR -> bDL - >
        rFD -> rBU -> dBR -> lBD -> dFL -> lFD -> fUL -> bDR -> bUR -> rBD ->
        fDR) For the edges I just memorize where they go. I try to picture it in
        my head as one piece that moves through each of these locations, and I
        picture the intermittent moves sometimes as well, whatever helps. The
        corners cycle as (UBL -> DFL -> UBR) and (UFL -> DBR -> UFR) and (DBL ->
        DFR) and they flip as UBL needs to flip clockwise and DFL needs to flip
        counterclockwise. Ok here&#x27;s the solve:
        ----------------------------------- First I solve corner orientation,
        since it&#x27;s the last thing I memorize and I can just take a quick
        snapshot of it if I solve it first. To solve I did U&#x27; x R&#x27;
        U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R L U L&#x27; U L U2 L&#x27; x&#x27; U (x
        is the rotation that means to turn your whole cube as if you were doing
        the move R, x&#x27; is like R&#x27;) Now I do corner permutation (UBL ->
        DFL -> UBR) F2 R2 B2 R F R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R F2 (UFL -> DBR -> UFR)
        B2 F2 L2 F&#x27; R&#x27; F L2 F&#x27; R F&#x27; B2 (DBL -> DFR) For this
        I can&#x27;t solve them yet, since any alg that moves just two corners
        must also perform an odd cycle somewhere on the centers (think 4x4x4
        supercube). Instead I just want to get them ready to solve later. F
        L&#x27; F&#x27; L F L&#x27; F&#x27; L F L&#x27; F&#x27; L - F&#x27; L F
        L&#x27; F&#x27; L F L&#x27; F&#x27; L F L&#x27; - R2 B2 R F R&#x27; B2 R
        F&#x27; R I&#x27;m sure there is a better way to do this, but with the
        clock ticking and me wanting to use center safe algs this is how I did
        it. I end up with the corner cycle (UBL &lt;-> UBR). EDGES:
        ------------------------------------ Here all I use are commutators, I
        have absolutely no memorized algs for any sort of cycles. (lUB -> fUR ->
        uFL -> dFR -> uBL -> dBL -> fDL -> rFU -> uBR -> bDL - > rFD -> rBU ->
        dBR -> lBD -> dFL -> lFD -> fUL -> bDR -> bUR -> rBD -> fDR) Here are
        the commutators I used. I will only write them as [X,Y] which means to
        do the permutation X Y X&#x27; Y&#x27; I&#x27;ll write setup moves
        around the commutator notation as well. (lUB -> fUR -> uFL) = f&#x27;
        [B&#x27; u2 B, U] f Ok, so to make sure things are clear X=(B&#x27; u2
        B) and Y=(U) so f&#x27; [B&#x27; u2 B, U] f = f&#x27; B&#x27; u2 B U
        B&#x27; u2 B U&#x27; f (lUB -> dFR -> uBL) = L [U, B d2 B&#x27;] L&#x27;
        again just to help clarify L [U, B d2 B&#x27;] L&#x27; = L U B d2
        B&#x27; U&#x27; B d2 B&#x27; L&#x27; (lUB -> dBL -> fDL) = [L&#x27;,
        D&#x27; l&#x27; D] (lUB -> rFU -> uBR) = [U2, F&#x27; u2 F] (lUB -> bDL
        -> rFD) = L2 D2 [B d B&#x27;, U] D2 L2 (lUB -> rBU -> dBR) = r&#x27;
        [U2, F d&#x27; F&#x27;] r (lUB -> lBD -> dFL) = L&#x27; [U, B d B&#x27;]
        L (lUB -> lFD -> fUL) = F&#x27; [L d&#x27; L&#x27;, U&#x27;] F (lUB ->
        bDR -> bUR) = [R d R&#x27;, U] (lUB -> rBD -> fDR) = U&#x27; L [D&#x27;,
        R&#x27; d2 R] L&#x27; U And now the edges are solved. CENTERS:
        ------------------------------------- Same as the edges I have no
        memorized algs for this. I solve this entirely using commutators.
        I&#x27;ll use the same [X,Y] notation here as above. (lbU -> ruF -> rbU
        -> buL -> lfU -> brD -> dbL -> ufR -> blD -> frU - > frD -> ubR -> fdL
        -> lfD -> ruB -> dlF -> luB) (lbU -> ruF -> rbU) = [U&#x27;, b&#x27;
        u&#x27; b] (lbU -> buL -> lfU) = [U, l u&#x27; l&#x27;] (lbU -> brD ->
        dbL) = r2 [U2, f d2 f&#x27;] r2 (lbU -> ufR -> blD) = D2 f&#x27; [l u
        l&#x27;, U] f D2 (lbU -> frU -> frD) = r F&#x27; r&#x27; [U2, r u2
        r&#x27;] r F r&#x27; (lbU -> ubR -> fdL) = f [l&#x27; u&#x27; l,
        U&#x27;] f&#x27; (lbU -> lfD -> ruB) = D2 r&#x27; [U2, l u2 l&#x27;] r
        D2 (lbU -> dlF -> luB) = F2 r [U, r&#x27; u2 r] r&#x27; F2
        ------------------------ FINISHING: Ok now we have to finish off our
        corners. To do this swap two edges, then end like a 3x3x3. (Uu)2 (Ll)2
        U2 l2 U2 (Ll)2 (Uu)2 y&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L U L F&#x27; L2 U L U
        L&#x27; U&#x27; L F And now the cube is solved. I realize that the
        centers can be done more efficiently, but I am taking Dror&#x27;s advice
        that he gave me at RWC2005 to try to put the centers into one long cycle
        to help with memorization. I may try to optimize them later, but for now
        I like making one long cycle to ease the memorization. Anyway there is
        an example solve, let me know if you have any questions. This solve is
        not theory, but is actually a reconstruction of my current record solve.
        Hope this helps, Chris

        Hey Brent, I got the idea from J. Bernett Orlando. Instead of using
        numbers or just remembering the cycles I name each piece with a noun.
        Then when I go through the memorization I use those nouns to make a
        story. See http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/blindfoldsolving-rubiks-
        cube/message/490 In that post I gave an example of how I use the center
        nouns to form a story to remember the cycles. Chris --- In

        this? As far as memorizaing the centers, in order to try to make the
        longest cycles possible I have an order of importance on each face that
        is based off my supercube 4x4 numbering. Each face has the centers
        labeled in decreasing priority. So there is a 1st priority spot, a 2nd
        priority spot, third, and fourth. When I run into say a red center in my
        cycle, I cycle it to the highest available priority spot on the red
        face. When I have placed a piece into the lowest priority spot I
        remember that the red face say is &quot;full&quot;, since I would have
        filled all the other spots before the 4th one. When a cycle ends sooner,
        and I have remaining pieces, I just think of the faces where I
        haven&#x27;t hit the 4th priority spot and start there. In terms of my
        story method I know that Spiderman, the Batmobile, Germany, a
        rubik&#x27;s cube competition, a giant hamster, and a chair are all my
        4th priority locations. If a cycle ends too soon, I review my story to
        see if I don&#x27;t have any of these 4th priority things in it. The one
        I don&#x27;t have is the face I check first when starting my other
        cycle. Hope that helps, Chris P.S. Now that I have more practice with
        blindfolded larger-than-the- 3x3x3-cube-stuff I think you&#x27;re
        absolutely insane to attempt the megaminx, and even more impressive to
        actually get it!! Now that I have more of an idea what that must
        involve, I think it is absolutely amazing! --- In

        to me... when I first started blindsolving and was very happy getting
        the 2x2 in a little over 20 minutes, I was still amazed by the large
        cube blindsolving others have done. Later when I learned more and was
        placed very high in the &quot;amazing blindfold achievements&quot;
        category (which doesn&#x27;t exist anymore) I felt that name was wrong.
        Nothing in there really amazed me anymore. Like, would you be amazed by
        a 15 seconds 3x3 speedsolve? No, you know how it&#x27;s done and it has
        become normal. Anybody can blindsolve, including larger cubes. But
        I&#x27;m still very much impressed by the speed some of you are showing.

        Ok, thanks. That&#x27;s similar to what I&#x27;ve done, only that
        I&#x27;m using my fingers to tell me where in a face I am. That is, I
        mainly hold the cube with three fingers of my left hand and three of my
        right hand (thumb, index and ring finger, cause I can spread those the
        most). The other fingers stabilize the cube and are not allowed to touch
        the pieces I&#x27;m analyzing so I don&#x27;t get confused because of
        them. Of course I can&#x27;t let go, put the cube down and pick it up
        again, without getting confused :-). How do you know at what spot you
        are in a certain face? Do you just have a feeling which nouns
        you&#x27;ve already used or do you replay the story to look for them? >

        amazing! Well, let me compare 4x4 and Megaminx: - Megaminx has 50 moving
        pieces, 4x4 has 56, make that 50 because you can get some centers for
        free. So about the same number of pieces to solve. - Megaminx has no
        parity problems because each fifth turn of a face is a 5-cycle of edges
        and corners, i.e. an even permutation. - Megaminx tells you exactly
        where everything goes, 4x4 you must decide and keep track where the
        centers go, very hard for me. - Megaminx has long setup moves because it
        just takes long to get a piece from here to there. On the other hand, it
        gives you a lot of freedom for setting up two pieces of a 3-cycle
        independently. The 4x4 has short setup moves, though setting up the
        edges can be annoying, especially if you want to for example bring UFr
        to UFl. - Megaminx has more colors (12 instead of 6) and more color
        pairs (60 instead of 24) so you need a larger pool of nouns or whatever.
        But you can make them up on the fly. For example, I encoded the
        white/purple edge as a mental image of a WhaLe, because W=white and
        L=Lila (German for purple). Overall I think Megaminx might be a bit
        harder than 4x4, but I think it&#x27;s easier than 5x5. And you&#x27;ll
        get that one soon, too. And then the Megaminx. And then we can race for
        Dogic :-). Or, well, just choose the route you like. I know I went
        straight from 3x3 to Megaminx because I wanted to be the first to do it
        and 4x4 and 5x5 had been done already. Cheers! Stefan

        a face again, I tried to think which of the numbers in that group I had
        already used. This can be slow sometimes, which is why I switched to
        nouns. I group the nouns by category on each face. Also, here are my
        priorities: U Face (People) 1) Larry (any random person) - lbU 2) Batman
        - rbU 3) the Terminator - lfU 4) Spiderman - rfU F face (modes of
        transportation) 1) Bus - luF 2) Airplane - ruF 3) back to the future III
        train time machine - dlF 4) the Batmobile - drF R face (places) 1) the
        south pole - ufR 2) a classroom/lecture hall - ubR 3) the neighborhood I
        grew up in - dfR 4) Germany - dbR B face (actions) 1) skydiving - urB 2)
        mountaineering - ulB 3) competiting in the Ironman triathlon - drB 4)
        competing in a rubik&#x27;s cube competition - dlB L face (animals) 1)
        Giraffe - ubL 2) Zebra - ufL 3) Alligator - dbL 4) giant hamster - dfL D
        face (things) 1) book - rbD 2) knife/sword - lbD 3) rubber duckie - rfD
        4) chair - lfD When I&#x27;m in the middle of a cycle and I have a piece
        cycle to say the L face, then I think of the most recent animal in my
        story. If I can remember a zebra and alligator is not solved then I know
        I have alligator next. If I can remember alligator, then I know giant
        hamster is next. So I don&#x27;t even have to use my fingers to mark the
        ones on each face that I have used last, I just figure it out based on
        the category of that face. Now when I see a red center I know it is an
        animal, an orange is a place, etc.. Also, I tried to craft my nouns to
        be able to be silly (giant hamster, comic book heroes, train time
        machine, etc.) and also shocking (terminator, mountaineering which can
        be dangerous, sword, etc.) > Overall I think Megaminx might be a bit

        I&#x27;l try the megaminx, but I am still very much intimidated by it. I

        probably after I graduate in December and have lots of free time to get
        addicted to 5x5x5 BLD I will try it. I guess my goals are not so much to
        do lots of things blindfolded, but to get fast at doing the puzzles I
        choose to do, which are mainly 4x4x4 and hopefully one day 5x5x5. I do
        also, though, want to be able to claim the 6x6x6 BLD. I doubt I will
        beat you to it, but one day I want that to be on my cubing resume so to
        speak ;-) Chris > > Cheers! > Stefan >

        nice idea to have the same &quot;theme&quot; for all centers of one
        color. I certainly gotta try without my fingers. It feels so stupid. And
        can you believe that in Orlando, analyzing and memorizing the +-centers

        who knows... you already got all it takes. And you seem very motivated,
        I still haven&#x27;t done any more attempts than my two 5x5s, two super
        5x5s, two Megaminx and zero 4x4... But rest assured I&#x27;ll be among
        the first who order the new 6x6 and blindsolving it will be the very
        first thing I&#x27;ll do with it (well, after making sure it turns
        nicely)... Cheers! Stefan

        That&#x27;s an interesting way to approach this... I know this came up
        for 3x3 blindfold memorization a long while back, but for the 4x4, it
        must be so complicated that a story is very necessary (lol at story). Is
        this correct? I mean, I think words/nouns for the 3x3 memorization does
        take too long, but this could be a different situation for 4x4. Or is it
        that words/nouns work for you? I plan on learning 4x4 BLD so I&#x27;m
        curious. I do prefer numbers over nouns/words... -Brent M [Team ZB]

        I always solve so that yellow ends up on top and orange on front. So
        first thing I do with the scrambled 3x3 is to rotate the cube as a whole
        such that the orange center is on front and the yellow center is on top.
        But why? There are 11 other cube orientations that I could easily choose
        from. For example, I could start with F=white and U=green. Then the
        first thing I&#x27;d do after blindfolding is apply E&#x27;M&#x27;EM.
        This will make F=orange and U=yellow without changing any edges or
        corners. Of course there are 24 cube orientations overall, but half of
        them can&#x27;t be fixed like that without changing edges and corners.
        And 1 is the &quot;correct&quot; orientation and the other 11 can all be
        fixed with algs in &lt;M,E> like these and their mirrors: E&#x27;
        M&#x27; E M M2 E M2 E&#x27; M&#x27; E M2 E&#x27; M&#x27; For my own
        method I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be a big advantage, though
        I&#x27;ll think about that again. But for the 4-step/3-cycle guys like
        Tyson&amp;Co I could imagine this to be helpful, for example like this:
        1) orient cube to maximize white/yellow stickers on U/D (i.e. maximize
        correctly oriented corners) 2) turn cube upside down if that brings more
        corners into their correct layer (if that&#x27;s helpful for you,
        don&#x27;t know) 3) do y if necessary to reach one of the 12
        &quot;good&quot; orientations 4) do y2 if that solves more corners What
        do you (especially Tyson&amp;Co) think about this? We shouldn&#x27;t let
        the cube dictate its orientation to us. We should exploit easier cases
        among the other 11 possibilities. Cheers! Stefan

        Grrr... Stefan you and your good ideas ;-) Now I have even more things
        to practice :-P Seriously though, that is an extremely good idea. I like
        that you can use it to make the CO less ugly, which can kill my solves
        personally. The time spent figuring out which of the 12 orientations you
        like is easily gained by a consistently better CO. I&#x27;m definitely

        Well, I&#x27;m no Tyson or Leyan, but I definitely try to be. Anyway
        here are my thoughts so far on this. L R2 F D L&#x27; U2 F&#x27; R F2
        U&#x27; B&#x27; R U2 B&#x27; U F&#x27; B2 L2 U2 D2 B2 F2 R2 D B I just
        did this scramble using your idea Stefan and got 3:33.39. My previous
        two solves were 2:37 and 2:46 by comparison. I don&#x27;t have the
        sequences memorized yet for how to cycle the centers, which is what
        caused me the most delay, I had to approach it like a commutator.
        Anyway, here is what I did: If you do that scramble from the orientation
        you will solve by then all 8 corners are flipped incorrectly. However if
        you do the rotation x&#x27; z now only two corners are flipped (DFR and
        DBR) and the centers can easily be fixed with E M E&#x27; M&#x27;
        Actually finding the E M E&#x27; M&#x27; is what took me the longest for
        fixing the centers, but memorizing how they need to flip, and finding a
        good y rotation after optimizing corner orientations is not hard either.
        So far I seriously want to switch to this 100% of the time. Now I&#x27;m
        off to put all 11 center rotation algs in my subconscious ;-) Chris ---

        Hey Stefan, I thought of a way to do this but use less center algs. I
        track the red, green, and yellow centers. Imagine the 3 of them like a
        2x2x2 inside the 3x3x3. This red-green-yellow 2x2x2 can only be in the
        top two layers or the bottom two layers. If it is in the top two layers
        I use a y rotation to get it to the FL edge. Same for if it is in the D
        layer. This 2x2x2 can only be in the u layer at FL or FR or the d layer
        at FR and BL. So why not always rotate it to the same spot? This saves
        you from having to know 4 more algs, plus it would speed up
        memorization, having less possible cases. Also a y rotation won&#x27;t
        affect corner orientation. Or you could even use the y2 rotation to
        optimize the corner permutation as well. Who knows, this can go lots of
        different ways. I am inclined to think that always rotating the 2x2x2 to
        the FL edge would make the memorization much easier, and thus really
        make the time spent optimizing corner orientation not time lost in vain.
        Open to new ideas, but I definitely want to try putting the 2x2x2 on FL
        always. This leaves only 8 cases including the solved case for the
        centers. What do you think? Chris --- In

        Hey Stefan and others, Actually all the cases for moving centers are
        really easy commutators. I don&#x27;t even think you would need to
        rotate U to put the 2x2x2 in the same spot, you can just use these. ok,
        so the 2x2x2 that belongs in uFL is the one I am talking about. It can
        be in either uFL, uBR, dFR, dBL for me. If you choose another one it can
        be in the other locations not mentioned also, it&#x27;s up to you. Ok,
        so my 2x2x2 belongs in uFL. the below locations are where it is and how
        it needs to rotate. uFL: clockwise: M E M&#x27; E&#x27;
        counter-clockwise: E M E&#x27; M&#x27; uBR: clockwise: M E&#x27; M&#x27;
        E counter-clockwise: S&#x27; E S E&#x27; dFR: clockwise: M&#x27; E M
        E&#x27; counter-clockwise: S E S&#x27; E&#x27; dBL: clockwise: M&#x27;
        E&#x27; M E counter-clockwise: S E&#x27; S&#x27; E Also the 3 algs for
        double transpositions M slice: E2 M&#x27; E2 M S slice: M2 S M2 S&#x27;
        E slice: M2 E M2 E&#x27; These algs are all super short, and the
        intuition isn&#x27;t that hard, they&#x27;re all 4 move commutators. Wow
        this is cool! Chris

        I ALWAYS solve with white on top and green in front, and i don&#x27;t
        want to change to the the &quot;new&quot; method. i was thinking the
        following way: when i have white on top, i can have 4 colors in front,
        but the corner orientation is alway the same. if i had yellow (opposit
        of white) on top i have the same as with white on top. so i have only
        three possible possibilities to hold the cube (white, green or red on
        top). the sum of the corners that are to be oriented must be 8. ie: with
        white on top 4, green 3, and red 1. is that correct? so with white on
        top and 0, 2,3 or 4 corners to flip i can&#x27;t get an advantage if i
        hold green or red on top. if 8 or 6 corners are wrong, it is better to
        take green or red on top and the new method is better. when 5 corners
        are wrong (3 correct) it could be that by holding green on top 5, 4, 3,
        2, 1 or 0 are correct. but then (with red on top) 0,1,2,3,4 or 5 are
        correct. so only the first an the last 2 cases are an advantage. all in
        all, in 50% of all cases it is the best thing, to stay with white on
        top. let&#x27;s say you need 3 seconds to see that green on top is
        better than white, then you need another 3 seconds to find the center
        permutation (ie EME&#x27;M&#x27;) and 3 seconds to permute the center.
        that makes 9 seconds. how long do you need to flip 3 or 4 corners? i
        think less than 9 seconds. but now we did not yet talk about the edges.
        i think it will take too long to have a look at the edge orientation and
        you will gain nothing. that&#x27;s why i still keep white on top and
        green in front. i memorise in 1:30 minutes (average) and try to be under
        1 minute until german cube day. i think under 3 minutes is possible.
        memorise quickly and you have not the time to forget, solve quickly and
        you have bot the time to make mistakes! thomas kohn -- 10 GB Mailbox,

        Hi Chris, Congrats on your progress on the 4x4x4. I too have the most
        problems with the edges on the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 but practice and
        experience does definately make a huge difference here. I like to cycle
        my edges: UFl --- > ULf --- > URf --- > UFl using the following alg:
        F&#x27; dR&#x27;d&#x27;L dRd&#x27;L&#x27; F it might not be the easiest
        or the fastest but it is what I am used to and that counts for a lot.
        UFl is the slot that I work around so the two holes that I use every
        cycle are the ones on the left and the right faces. What I personally
        find to be critical on the edges is consistency in the set up moves. I
        estimate that up to 90 percent of my errors come while trying to UNDO
        the set up moves. Thus consisency is paramount. I try as hard as
        possible to place the first target edge into the left face and then the
        second target edge into the right face. Thus when it comes to undoing
        the set up moves I KNOW that I must undo the right face first and the
        left face second. Occasionally the way the set up moves go makes it
        really awkward to do it in this order. If this is the case then I set up
        the right face first and thus undo them in the opposite order but I
        consider it to be so EXCEPTIONAL that it is easy for me to remember to
        do things differently. I think it is also important to be consistant
        with your approach to the set up moves. There are often several
        different ways to set up a piece. Find a path that works for you to get
        each different piece to each different set up hole and then always use
        the same path. At first the set ups seem really difficult and complex
        but the more you practice the more options you will notice and the
        easier it will become. I also find it much easier to set up and undo set
        up moves while actually blindfolded than while just practicing with my
        eyes open. Less distractions from the other surrounding pieces I think.
        In sum. Consistency. Always set up the pieces in the same order. Always
        use the same set up moves. Always use individual slices and never use
        double slice turns. Once you are used to this it is just a matter of
        practice. Always be especially careful when undoing the set up moves.

        Wow, two posts in one day for me :) Yesterday I solved a regular 5x5x5
        blindfolded. Yippie. What was really cool is that I actually made a
        mistake while cycling the + centers but was able to realize it and go
        back and correct it. Grace under pressure! I had previously solved a
        supercube 5x5x5 blindfolded because I had thought that it would be the
        hardest challenge out there and I wanted to go straight for it. Imagine
        my disappointment when the prevailing attitutdes started to shift
        towards the regular solves being more difficult. Well I have now
        blindsolved both the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 as both regular cubes and
        supercubes. Personally I think that the supercubes ARE more challenging
        than the regular solves. Granted that the supercube tells you exactly
        where to place each center which can help to make the analysis easier.
        But parity solutions are easier on the regular cubes than the
        supercubes. And there are other advantages too. On the 4x4x4 you can
        choose how to start the cube regularly giving you 6 centers solved at
        the outset and frequently up to 8 centers already solved. That is 1/3 of
        the center cycle for free!! On the 5x5x5 the middle edge orientation and
        permutation is much simpler if you have already solved the centeres
        before doing them. The algs I use flip centers within a face and so must
        be used very carefully on the supercube but quite simply on a regular
        cube if the centers have already been solved. On the negative side the
        analysis is a little more difficult but not all that bad with a little
        practise. Cetainly not so bad as to outweigh the many advantages. At
        least in my opinion. Difficulty is in the mind&#x27;s eye of the solver.
        For some maybe the supercube is easier. I just thought I would post that
        in my experience the regular solve is a little easier. It is a little
        bit splitting hairs however - to execute a 5x5x5 solution flawlessly
        requires focus and accuracy regardless of if it is a supercube or
        regular cube. Rob

        Hi Stefan, Thanks for the suggestions. I have used my 3-cycle hundreds
        of times and I am used to its rhythm and my hands are used to its feel
        so I think it would be dangerous for me to switch now. I have even
        invented a little song that I sing while executing it to make sure I
        donÂ¤t skip any of the moves : ) For blindfold purposes I would also
        modify your alg to start and end with UÂ¤ and U instead of yÂ¤ and y.
        Two extra moves granted but it would avoid having to regrip which is a
        real plus to me. I will probably get a LOT of use out of your alg while
        regular sighted solving LL on my 5x5x5. I sometimes like to experiment
        with a columnar approach which solves F4L intuitively, followed by OLL
        PLL for the corners and midges, followed by three-cycles for the wedges,
        [followed by three cycles for the X centers and three cycles for the +
        centers when supercubing]. Of course I already have enough algs to get
        the job done but since your alg is full of R and U it will certainly be
        quicker and easier once I am used to it. While sighted I wont need the
        extra UÂ¤ and U (or yÂ¤ and y) I will simply execute it on the right
        hand side and even use its mirror to cycle down the left hand side. Very
        useful. Thanks. Rob __________________________________ Start your day

        WARNING: LONG post and potentially a SPOILER. Do not read if you want to

        Stefan, Here is my approach to fixing the parities while blindsolving
        the 5x5x5 supercube, or as I like to call it the superprof. The
        centercap / corners / midges / X center parity is extremely easy to
        identify and in fact is the very first thing I do. Simply analyze the 6
        centercaps. If they are even there is no parity. If odd there is a
        parity. If odd the fix is very easy but it makes the analysis of all the
        data a little trickier. The fix is one you suggested for 3x3x3 about a
        year ago. I mentally perform either U or U&#x27; whichever is more
        advantageous. Parity solved but now I must be very careful to take this
        rotation into account while analyzing all of my cycles. The wedegs / +
        center parity is a little trickier. The only way I know for sure to
        discover it is to actually run through the cycle of the wedges.
        Theoretically it too could be corrected by a simple slice move (e.g.: u
        or u&#x27;) but that would mean figuring out the whole cycle again and I
        don&#x27;t want to do that after I have already gone through the trouble
        to memorize all of that data. So if I find a parity while analyzing the
        wedge cycle I will work with it. If parity is present than the cycle can
        of course be ultimately reduced to a single pair swap (considering only
        the wedges). After reducing the wedges to a pairswap I remember which
        edges need swapping and move on to the + center cycle. If there is a
        parity in the wedges there must also be a parity in the + centers which
        can also be ultimately reduced to a single pairswap. I have combined a
        pair of algs into a very long alg which will swap 2 wedges and 2 +
        centers while leaving the rest of the supercube unaffected. This long
        alg will: swap 2 wedges: UFl &lt; --- > UBl and swap 2 + centers: UfM
        &lt; --- > UbM It starts with an alg to swap the two wedges: [r U2] x4,
        r, [F2 l&#x27; B2 l] x2 But this messes up the centers so to put them
        back where they belong I use an alg which rotates the centercap 180 on a
        regular 3x3x3 supercube: [R L U R&#x27; L&#x27; U2] x2 The above alg
        fixes the centers in column l and column r but it rotates my 5x5x5
        centercap 180 so I must repeat the above alg but with double slices to
        rotate the centercap back to solved: [(Rr) (Ll) (Uu) (Rr)&#x27;
        (Ll)&#x27; (Uu)2] x2. So, when combined the full and extended alg is as
        follows: [r U2] x4, r, [F2 l&#x27; B2 l] x2, [R L U R&#x27; L&#x27; U2]
        x2 [(Rr) (Ll) (Uu) (Rr)&#x27; (Ll)&#x27; (Uu)2] x2. Try it on a solved
        supercube and you will see that only the 2 wedges and 2 + centers are
        affected. It is a long process but it is not very hard to remember or
        execute once you are used to it. In fact I didn&#x27;t even have to
        `learn&#x27; it at all since it is really just the regular parity alg I
        use combined with an alg that rotates a centercap 180. One long alg
        composed of two algs that I already knew well beforehand. One small
        detail to add. Since it is a real pain to keep track of 2 wedges AND 2 +
        centers while performing FOUR set up moves  I have a little trick to
        make life easier. While analysing the cube I have already established
        the presence of parity while memorizing the wedge cycle. Thus I know it
        will be present in the + centers before I start memorizing them. What I
        do then is to deliberately solve UfM into the UbM slot and UbM into the
        UfM slot. By introducing this additional pairswap into the cycle the
        rest of it can now be fully resolved leaving me with the two + centers
        swapped that will be fixed by my parity move. Essentially I alter the
        cycle to ensure that the 2 swapped + centers end up being the 2 centers
        that I want swapped. Thus I only need to worry about set up moves for my
        2 wedges which poses no difficulty at all. Well this was a long post but
        parity can be complex and difficult to explain. I tried to explain not
        only HOW I solve parity but also WHY I solve it that way and how I
        identify it. I hope that it makes sense. Let me know if you need me to
        clear up any details. Note that on a regular 5x5x5 blindsolve the wedge
        / + center parity can be easily fixed by solving all the centers first
        and just using: [r U2] x4, r, [F2 l&#x27; B2 l] x2 ---- > many thanks to
        Masayuki for this alg !! Sure it will swap lots of X centers and +
        centers but on a regular solve  who cares. One of the reasons why I
        personally think that the superprof is harder to blindsolve than the
        regular prof (at least with my solution technique  perhaps your parity
        solution is much easier!) Yours, Rob

        Hi Stefan, I realized that I didn&#x27;t answer these questions in my
        parity post. > Re: 5x5x5 blindsolve - Congrats! What time? It took about
        thirty minutes to memorize and another half hour to solve. I just looked
        at a clock before and after I didn&#x27;t use any timing device. >
        I&#x27;m also missing your super 5x5 time at speedcubing.com Yeah, I am
        pretty lazy about submitting times - I rarely time myself on blindsolves
        for big cubes. In fact I haven&#x27;t submitted anything as of yet :(
        For the record I have no idea how long it took to memorize (I did it too
        long ago) but I seem to remember that it took about 45 minutes to
        execute the solve. While I am on a roll with posting - what alg do you
        use to orient midges on the 5x5x5 and the superprof?? My technique works
        but it is a bit of a pain. My alg is just a standard 3x3x3 two edge
        flip: M&#x27; U M&#x27; U M&#x27; U2 M U M U M U2 flips UFM and UBM But
        this unfortunately swaps the + centers in the M column on the U and B
        faces!!! No big deal on a regular solve - just do the midges after
        solving the centers! But this little trick wont work on a supercube. So
        for the supercube I flip edges mod 4 using this move - the first
        pairflip will swap the centers and the second pairflip will swap them
        back. If the edge orientation is not divisible by 4 then I solve the
        last two edge flips with: [M&#x27; U M&#x27; U M&#x27; U2, M U M U M U2,
        B2] x2 this flips UBM and DBM but is admittedly a bit of a pain to use.
        Do you have an alg that will flip midges without affecting the centers?
        If so it could be very useful to me. Also welcome would be a 4 midge
        flip since my algs will only flip 2 at a time. Rob

        I&#x27;ll repeat Rob&#x27;s warning: WARNING: LONG post and potentially
        a SPOILER. Do not read if you want to figure out your own solution to
        parity on the 5x5x5 supercube! Thanks Rob, very nice explanation of how
        you solve those parities. I tried the &quot;start with U&quot; fix for
        outer layer parity once and I think it was one reason why I failed. It
        forced me to think a lot and that&#x27;s not good for me. I also thought
        about just memorizing two pieces swapped, but I never tried it. Before I
        show you my way, let me just show a possible replacement for your
        speedsolving parity fix. First part is the same but second part differs:
        [r U2] x4, r, U x&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U r&#x27; U&#x27; L U r For me
        this seems easier to execute because it&#x27;s only quarter turns and
        only &lt;U,r,l,L>. Oh, and I just found out we have a nice
        self-correcting alg: [R L U R&#x27; L&#x27; U2] x2 I keep forgetting
        whether I shall do the U inside the first five moves and the U2
        afterwards, or vice versa. Turns out it doesn&#x27;t matter, the effect
        is the same: [R L U2 R&#x27; L&#x27; U] x2 Ok, now for my parity fixing.
        Actually I won&#x27;t tell you exactly how I do it, but instead show you
        a cleaner version. Imagine you always &quot;shoot&quot; from certain U
        layer positions, e.g. UFl is always the first of the three positions of
        an outer edge 3-cycle (in reality I&#x27;ve used DLf). Do this for all
        piece types: outer edges: UFl middle edges: UFm corners: UFL X-centers:
        Ufl +-centers: Ufm Now when you end up with a single swap for a certain
        piece type, just leave it on U at certain places, e.g. leave UFl and ULb
        swapped for outer edges. If for example you end up having to swap UFl
        and RDf, simply do the 3-cycle (UFl->RDf->ULb->UFl), e.g. with the
        commutator [l D&#x27; l&#x27;, U&#x27;]. You only need to set up one
        piece and it&#x27;s a very easy commutator. The &quot;final swap
        partners&quot; for the places mentioned above are just a U turn away,
        i.e. they are: outer edges: ULb middle edges: ULs corners: ULB
        X-centers: Ulb +-centers: Uls Just do this for all piece types. If
        there&#x27;s a parity, append a 3-cycle at the end. This also means you
        don&#x27;t need to detect parity beforehand. In case of center parity,
        leave it one U turn away from solved. Now let me just define a notation
        for conjugated commutators: {A:B,C} = A [B,C] A&#x27; = A B C B&#x27;
        C&#x27; A&#x27; At the very end, fix all parities like this: Outer layer
        parity: We want to swap the partners for corners, medges, +-centers,
        X=centers, and rotate the center. Do it in four steps: 1) { (Ll)&#x27; :
        (Rr)&#x27; (Dde)2 (Rr) , U } 2) U 3) [ l&#x27; , L&#x27; U&#x27; L U ]
        4) [ L U L&#x27; U&#x27; , l ] Nice alg, easy to do in 12 seconds or so.
        I&#x27;ll write it out and maybe make a diagram later. Inner layer
        parity: We want to swap the partners for +-centers and outer edges.
        Alright, gotta stop now and do some work, but I&#x27;ll continue later.
        Or someone else could show an alg for this... Cheers! Stefan

        Stefan! I especially like the first one more than the second one because
        F and F&#x27; don&#x27;t get along with me very well ;P I will have to
        get used to it but I will definately use it (as well as adaptations) in
        the future. Thanks also for your parity explanation. I read it through
        but I am short for time today (Christmas socials etc...) so I look
        forward to experimenting with it more thoroughly tomorrow morning. Rob

        Hey everyone, I got a 16 minute 4x4x4 BLD solve today and almost got the
        UWR too! The time was 16 minutes 39.61 seconds. I don&#x27;t know how
        long memorization took me, since I didn&#x27;t look, but I would guess
        about 3:00 minutes to memorize centers, 4:00-4:30 minutes for edges, and
        0:45-1:00 to memorize corners. I try to be super careful on corners, so
        I think the total was about 7:00-8:00 on memorization and about 8:00 to
        solve. Man this is sooooo addicting! Now I really won&#x27;t stop till I
        get the UWR ;-) Or at least get it until someone else beats it, which
        probably won&#x27;t take long. I think my personal limits for this might
        be sub-10:00 minutes still. I can definitely learn to trust myself
        better for memorization and probably memorize centers and edges together
        in less than 6 minutes, then corners in 20 seconds if I practice more.
        Then I think I could learn to solve in less than 5 minutes if I
        practiced a lot. Well, I guess my goal is to get a sub-10:00 minute
        solve at home and on the couch, and just to get one successfully in
        competition. Man this is sooooo cool :-) I can&#x27;t wait till I get
        more consistent and can consider the 5x5x5 as well. Chris

        didn&#x27;t look, but I would guess about 3:00 minutes to memorize
        centers, 4:00-4:30 minutes for edges, and 0:45-1:00 to memorize corners.
        I try to be super careful on corners, so I think the total was about
        7:00-8:00 on memorization and about 8:00 to solve. Man this is sooooo
        addicting! Now I really won&#x27;t stop till I get the UWR ;-) Or at
        least get it until someone else beats it, which probably won&#x27;t take
        long. I think my personal limits for this might be sub-10:00 minutes
        still. I can definitely learn to trust myself better for memorization
        and probably memorize centers and edges together in less than 6 minutes,
        then corners in 20 seconds if I practice more. Then I think I could
        learn to solve in less than 5 minutes if I practiced a lot. Well, I
        guess my goal is to get a sub-10:00 minute solve at home and on the
        couch, and just to get one successfully in competition. Man this is
        sooooo cool :-) I can&#x27;t wait till I get more consistent and can
        consider the 5x5x5 as well. Chris SPONSORED LINKS Jigsaw puzzle game

        Hey Rob, Thanks for the reply, I have been trying to take some of these

        this type of commutator, I think I am going to start using them more
        often. I had never thought to do it this way before seeing you post this
        alg, thanks! My commutators are always of this form (or something based
        on this idea) [R&#x27; d R, U] > it might not be the easiest or the

        but do you always use that same alg to move the edges, and use setup
        moves every time? I am finding, that what is helping me to both get
        faster and more accurate for 4x4 (I have yet to try 5x5, so this might
        not apply there) is to use commutators on all faces, from any angle.
        There are cases where I used to use a setup move that now I can see that
        I can use a commutator from a different angle and have no setup moves at
        all. At first I lost a lot of accuracy since I wasn&#x27;t used to doing
        commutators like that, but now I am getting used to it and I think I
        want this to be my approach in the future. I also want to learn
        commutators of the type that you listed above, I think broadening my
        reperotoire so to speak might make this approach mean I would hardly
        ever have to use setup moves at all, which is my goal. > I think it is

        I also agree, lately I have been using the same style of setup moves (I
        do things on all faces, so it&#x27;s just sort of a general trend) and I
        have noticed that sometimes if I forget the setup move I did, I can
        think of the position the pieces started in and think how I would set
        them up. This makes me recall the setup moves I actually did and I can
        still undo and get a sucessful solve. I also definitely agree to never
        use double layer turns, unless the double layer turn is your setup.
        Sometimes I can set up a very easy commutator to replace a hard one just
        by doing a double layer quarter turn, in that case I would use it, but
        other than that never. I guess my goal is more speed for the 4x4x4 and
        then maybe one day when I have perfected my approach to that, I will try
        to learn to speed solve the 5x5x5. You guys are crazy impressive to me
        with your attempts at difficult blindfolded feats. I guess I am more
        banal about it and just want to get fast at the 4x4x4, and one day of
        course try to expand to the 5x5x5. I don&#x27;t really have any other
        plans other than just in my life getting one successful 6x6x6 BLD solve
        once they are sold online. Anyway thanks for the tips, and for opening
        my eyes to other commutators. I will definitely start using ones of that
        form more often now. Best of luck with your awesome BLD achievements,
        I&#x27;m still jealous about the 5x5x5 heh heh :-P Chris

        Hey Rob, you just gave me an idea for how to make my solving much more
        consistent and make my biggest problem about undoing setup moves
        literally not a problem at all. Say I have the three pieces UFl, URf,
        and DRf. If I have to cycle them counterclockwise I do: [R&#x27; d&#x27;
        R, U&#x27;] and if I had to cycle them clockwise I would do the inverse,
        or [U&#x27;, R&#x27; d&#x27; R] This made it hard to remember if I
        started with a slice move, or the actual edge placing maneuver. However,
        using your idea for commutators I can always start with the edge placing
        maneuver, and always end with a slice move (saving almost all my trouble
        for remembering undoing setup moves). So counterclockwise is the same
        with [R&#x27; d&#x27; R, U&#x27;] and clockwise becomes [l D&#x27;
        l&#x27;, U] which is of the same form of [place stuff , slice move,
        inverse of placing stuff, inverse slice move]. Wow, this is awesome! I
        think having all my commutators of the same form like this will greatly
        improve my accuracy, and hopefully also the speed. This is cool, thanks
        again! Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi Chris, As usual you have taken some simple ideas and really run a
        long way with them. Some awesome ideas! IÂ¤ll answer all three posts at
        once Â¤ howÂ¤s that for efficiency ;) >>I guess I want to ask to make
        sure, but do you always use that same alg to move the edges, and use
        setup moves every time? No not quite always, but at least 90 percent if
        not 95 percent. Of course I also use the inverse if it makes set ups
        much easier. Occasionally I will also cycle edges in the Â¤bÂ¤ slice
        instead of the Â¤fÂ¤ slice but only if it makes both set ups much
        easier. For this I use a very similar alg but with u moves instead of d
        moves: F u L uÂ¤ RÂ¤ u LÂ¤ uÂ¤ R FÂ¤ (and its inverse) Also, if UFl ends
        up solved because I am faced with 2 or 3 shorter cycles instead of one
        nice long 23 cycle (my favourite scenario) than I use an adaptation of
        my usual alg designed to cycle out of UFr (if it is still unsolved).
        >>why don&#x27;t you consider cycling as: d R&#x27; d&#x27; L d R
        d&#x27; L&#x27; and cycle ULf -> URf -> FLd Yeah, I did think about
        that. It would indeed save two moves every time I use it. But in the end
        I decided to stick with my original plan because I found that it made
        set up moves easier. I consider UFl to be my Â¤distribution centerÂ¤ if
        you will. I generally use L and R moves to place my two target pieces
        into UfL and UfR. If FLd were my Â¤distribution centerÂ¤ it would make
        the UfL set up move much more awkward. >>I have noticed that sometimes
        if I forget the setup move I did, I can think of the position the pieces
        started in and think how I would set them up. This makes me recall the
        setup moves I actually did and I can still undo and get a successful
        solve. Definitely! Using a consistent approach to set up moves can
        really help in this. If unsure how to undo a set up move I will often
        ask myself how I would normally do it in the first place. This will
        refresh my memory and make the inverse much more obvious. Some of my
        proudest bld moments come not from perfect solves but realizing that I
        have made an error and being able to backtrack to fix it. >>However,
        using your idea for commutators ... Not really my idea. I improvised the
        alg by adapting one that Masayuki had on his site for LL solving 4x4x4
        and 5x5x5 using his old technique. If I remember correctly his alg
        cycled 3 edges on the D face and I simply changed it to cycle three
        edges on the U face. He is an awesome cuber and a super nice guy so I
        think the credit for the idea should go to him :) >>I am finding, that
        what is helping me to both get faster and more accurate for 4x4 (I have
        yet to try 5x5, so this might not apply there) is to use commutators on
        all faces, from any angle. There are cases where I used to use a setup
        move that now I can see that I can use a commutator from a different
        angle and have no setup moves at all. At first I lost a lot of accuracy
        since I wasn&#x27;t used to doing commutators like that, but now I am
        getting used to it and I think I want this to be my approach in the
        future. Awesome idea! Right now I certainly donÂ¤t feel that I have the
        skill to improvise a commutator on the fly like that but if you can do
        it with some practice than major power to you!!! I think this is really
        interesting and I will probably try this direct multi-angle approach
        tonight with a couple of eyes open solves. If I can really get a good
        feel for your new approach I might well convert to it Â¤ I think that it
        really has a lot of potential to be powerful and fast. But for me for
        now though I will stick to old faithful and his huge catalogue of set up
        moves. The multi-angle would save a lot of time and set ups but it adds
        another level of complexity to the technique. Always using the same 3
        cycle with set ups is really simple, requires no additional thinking on
        the fly, and also adheres to the cardinal rule of consistency. I have
        also found that the more I do big bld solves the easier set up moves
        become. >> Best of luck with your awesome BLD achievements, I&#x27;m
        still jealous about the 5x5x5 heh heh :-P Now now now, havenÂ¤t you read
        anything that Stefan and Dr Carr post? They would both tell you (and I
        would agree) that it really isnÂ¤t as hard as people think it is. The
        5x5x5 is well within your range. It is just a 4x4x4 with an extra 24
        cycle for the + centers and the midges from a 3x3x3 thrown in for good
        measure :) I can see no reason why you multi-angle would not work on a
        5x5x5 too. >> Stefan suggested .. Hmm... how about [ L F&#x27; L&#x27; ,
        f&#x27; ] instead? Very elegant! I like it a lot! Happy cubing, Rob ---

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I got this idea from Per Fredlund, and have recently been
        using it for BLD 4x4x4. One example from my solve today was the
        following center cycle, dfL -> rdF -> blU Normally I would do the setup
        move r then [r&#x27; d r, U2] but since the setup move and the first
        move of my commutator are inverses of eachother, I&#x27;ve started doing
        the cyclic shift (perform the same algorithm, but start at a point
        beyond the first move, when you reach the end start over and do the
        beginning moves until you reach the move you started with). So in my
        solve I did (d r U2 r&#x27; d&#x27; r U2 r&#x27;) starting at move 2 and
        wrapping around again to move 1. I know this probably sounds very
        trivial, but the thing is this was my very first time actually trying
        the cyclic shift technique for a cycle in a solve, and unfortunately I
        forgot to apply the r&#x27; at the end. This was at the end of my center
        cycle, and thus the end of my solve so it was a very, very close DNF.
        Anyway, again I know it is causing me DNFs in the shortrun, but I am
        trying to train myself to see these cyclic shifts also. I think having a
        run of DNFs for a while will be more than balanced out by having so much
        more freedom for performing my center cycles, and having to use less
        setup moves (my main goal for all stages of 4x4x4 BLD). I guess I am
        trying to optimize my approach for having no setup moves whatsoever (if
        that&#x27;s even possible), but it is my goal. I don&#x27;t know if
        cyclic shifting is something people already do but I wanted to mention
        it. I know in theory it is such a simple idea, but for BLD solving it
        needs to be practiced to become second nature as my DNF today shows :-(
        Anyway, I think with all of these optimizations that I can come that
        much closer to my final goal of a sub-10 minute solve. I hope this is
        what I need to get there, but I imagine that I&#x27;ll discover other
        cool tricks along the way. So anyway, I am DNFing because of them now,
        but I will eventually be using these cyclic shifts in my solving. I just
        wanted to post in case anyone had not considered using these before.

        ha ha well I guess it is not possible ;-) I guess I would just try to
        minimize using setup turns as much as I can. To do URf->RFu->FUr->URf I
        would do : r [B u2 B&#x27;, U&#x27;] r&#x27; > Hmm... how do you think

        used to doing commutators of the form of moving one piece from a side
        layer and replacing two pieces in the same layer. I now view this setup
        as a different type of commutator, but it took me viewing it as starting
        on the 2nd move of my usual commutator style and completing the 1st turn
        after the last one to do a cyclic shift. I guess I still try to view it
        as a cyclic shift, though I do realize that it is just another type of
        commutator. Chris

        Ok, so I&#x27;ve been thinking about this a lot and wanted to ask what
        people thought. I&#x27;m trying to think of ways to finish off an odd
        edge cycle for 4x4x4. What I&#x27;ve been doing lately is using this
        4x4x4 supercube centers safe alg to swap just two edge pieces: r2 B2 U2
        l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2 R L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27;
        U&#x27; R L U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; And I would use setup moves to
        get the edges next to eachother somewhere. However, you could swap two
        edge groups, and end two edge cycles, with: d R F&#x27; U R&#x27; F
        d&#x27; u&#x27; F&#x27; R U&#x27; F R&#x27; u This alg is also centers
        safe, but I imagine the setup moves to get the edges where you need them
        would be horrendous. Anyway, I don&#x27;t really have any other ideas, I
        already save odd corner cycles for last, and that takes a good bit of
        thought effort to remember (especially with a fast centers solve!) so I
        think I don&#x27;t want to save odd edge cycles till the end. Does
        anyone else have any ideas? How would you guys do the edges if there was
        an 8 cycle, two 2-cycles, and a 12 cycle? (I really had this once during
        a solve) Chris

        Though I suspect you were looking for something more direct. The thing
        is that I can &#x27;see&#x27; these things very quickly and easily with
        my regular alg + inverse + mirrors and I can execute them with a high
        degree of accuracy. This one only took me about one second to figure out
        using my method. I tried last night but was admittedly no good at
        generating commutators on the fly - a success rate only somewhere around
        50 percent and that was with my eyes open. I will definately keep trying
        though because I believe it would be a really good skill to acquire
        through perseverence and practice. I might even give it a shot wih my
        eyes closed because I find visualization a lot easier without all the
        other colours and pieces acting as a distraction. As for cyclic shifts I
        guess it could also be viewed as move cancellation. Personally I
        generally avoid cancelling moves while blindfolding. Saving 2 moves in
        the r slice is a very small profit for the risk of a DNF. By never
        cancelling moves it means I always use the same alg without fail. No
        thinking, no questions. If the first move of the alg cancells the last
        move of my set up then I just have a quick laugh at my own expense and
        keep on solving. Rob __________________________________________ Yahoo!

        horrendous. First of all: very very nice algorithm! Have you considered
        doing two swaps just as two 3-cycles? For this particular case, also
        try: { (Uu)2 F2 : L R U2 L&#x27; R&#x27; , u } > Does anyone else have

        Well that was my most ambitious attempt to date and also my most

        in a row. Result - DNF The 3x3x3 was perfect The 5x5x5 was perfect but
        the 4x4x4 had 4 edges and 8 centers misplaced. This tells me that I must
        have done a r instead of an r&#x27; at some point in my solve (or vice
        versa). So close but literally missed by a single wrong turn! Since I
        set out to do all three I will NOT claim this as a 3x3x3 and a 5x5x5,
        just as a humble DNF. I started from smallest to largest so I am still
        kinda happy that I was able to keep my focus enough to do a 5x5x5
        perfectly even after the 3x3x3 and the 4x4x4. I wanted to push my
        boundaries in terms of amount of data in memorization and found it to be
        no problem at all. I will definately have to try this again just to even
        the score. Total solve time was 53 minutes. I have no idea how long I
        spent doing the memorization. Rob

        As I said before, and I still mean it, I think these huge relays and
        really hard puzzles *cough* megaminx *cough* ;-) that you guys all do
        are extremely impressive! True, I mean I guess after hearing you guys
        break down the problem into all of its substeps, it seems more
        manageable, but still it doesn&#x27;t fail to impress me, a LOT! Rob I
        know you will get the relay, it sounds like you have the mental ability
        by far, and just a small mistake is all the happened. Everyone makes
        small mistakes, so I wouldn&#x27;t sweat it. Wow, alright so you guys
        have me thinking hard about what my 5x5x5 strategy will be. I realized
        that, though I had a solution, I want to try to come up with a very
        efficient one before I ever start, since speed will one day be the goal
        for me. I am already starting to come up with noun names for the plus
        centers that are completely unrelated to the ones I use for the x
        centers (to avoid interference). I thought about using numbers, but for
        the way I think this is very slow, or it is slow compared to how quickly
        I can memorize a story from nouns. After I choose all my nouns and
        memorize the naming scheme I will try a few sighted solves with my
        method and then give it a shot. I am pretty busy at school so it will
        take about another week for me to be ready to try. Also my first 5x5x5
        BLD solve will be one of the first things I do after my first
        sub-16:23.55 4x4x4 BLD solve. Dror this is not me picking on you, you
        are in fact my biggest inspiration! I just want to get under what has
        been the UWR for a very long time, even if you beat it soon by a long
        shot, I will still try for sub-16:23 :-) Thanks for the support and
        inspiration all, and also Rob I know you will get the relay! It seems
        you are capable of far more as well, so I know we will see great things

        Did you do this on December 5 or what day was it done, and was it just a
        crowd of randomly gathered people? Do you know where on campus? A couple

        Actually, another question I have is the break down of the memorization
        vs. the execution time. For a 1:23 second solve, memorization must have
        been around 30 seconds... perhaps less? Execution in under 40 seconds is
        extremely rare and difficult. Are you getting amazing times because you
        can memorize the cube extremely fast or are you being really efficient
        during the solve with no delays, or is it a combination of both? I think
        the best memorization I&#x27;ve done so far is about 34 seconds and the
        best execution I&#x27;ve done is about 45 seconds. Not on the same
        solve... of course... because that would be awesome. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        This is Marcus. Amazing, Rob! My only suggestion to you is to maximize
        your memorization abilities. I recommend memorizing things in chunks. If
        you are good at binary, you could use something like that for the
        orientation of edges. Here is one such method I use sometimes if the
        orientations of a 3x3x3 are a little messy (I usually use this during a
        relay and not a speedsolve, as relays are more memory intensive and
        therefore it is better to get a sure-fire method for long-term
        &quot;data recovery,&quot; so to speak): Looking at the top layer of the
        cube, assign a value to edges 1, 2, 3, and 4 with values, 1, 2, 4, and
        8, respectively. You simply add the numbers from the edges that need
        flipping. For example, the &quot;flip number&quot; for Layer 1, assuming
        that, say, Edges 1 and 3 are oriented incorrectly, would be 1 + 4 (since
        Edge 1&#x27;s value is 1 and Edge 3&#x27;s value is 4). Therefore the
        flip number is 5. Do this procedure for all three layers and you have
        three numbers, which can be associated with words depending on the first
        letter. For example, 5 could be Eat, or Erase, or Egg, whatever (since
        the fifth letter of the alphabet is &#x27;e&#x27;). Example: You
        memorized the edges using the phrase &quot;Foolish Honey Muffin.&quot;
        Alright, that&#x27;s just gravy and all, but you know the letters are F,
        H, and M, which are 6, 8, and 13, respectively. 6 can only be broken
        down into 2 + 4 (this means Edges 2 and 3 on Layer 1 need flipping). 8
        can only be broken down into 8 (this means Edge 3 on the middle layer
        needs flipping), and 13 can only be broken down into 1 + 4 + 8 (this
        means Edges 1, 3, and 4 need flipping). All with merely memorizing
        &quot;Foolish Honey Muffin&quot; :) Using tricks like these will ensure
        that you never forget what the cube layout looks like.

        Hey Chris, Marcus here. I updated some relay records if you&#x27;d like
        to see what the approach is. For 5x5x5s, I think where you are taking it
        is great! Using stories are pretty good for remembering layouts,
        especially if the story is especially wacky (ie. &quot;The RABBIT kills
        the KNIGHT whose knife falls on the PICKLE which squirts juice on the
        OLD MAN,&quot; etc). Ok that was a pretty disgusting example, but you
        get the idea. Centers are hard to memorize but I don&#x27;t really know
        of a better way to do it than stories. I know you&#x27;ve been
        crazy-fast at just about everything you&#x27;ve attempted in the cube
        realm, so I am anxious to see where you&#x27;re able to take

        Thanks Marcus. That is a great tip! Actually what made me most nervous
        about the solve was the thought of doing the 4 and 5 perfect but missing
        the 3! Along the same lines I found memorizing the 5 long 24 cycles
        quite straightforward. Ironically what caused me worry was the
        relatively simple corner solves - the 3 corner orientations and 3 corner
        permutations. I was worried that I might forget such a simple but short
        sequence simply because it is so short and bland - they just don&#x27;t
        stand out as much! The long sequences are memorized by a funny story so
        they take longer to compose but never fail to come to mind during the
        solve. I agree with you in that I like to memorize things in chunks. I
        solve using a cycle method. For the 24 cycles I much prefer one long
        sequence to 2,3,4, or even 5 shorter sequences. Assuming I have a nice
        long sequence I like to memorize in pairs since that is the number of
        edges/centers I will solve with any one alg. The pairs are memorized by
        a single word/concept. Then I build my stories around pairs of words
        (i.e. units which represent 4 edges). Of course pairs of words can be
        combined along a theme for 8 edges - and so on, and so on, and so on. I
        was a system heavily based on the major system but with a couple of
        little personal tweeks to made it more directly applicble to cubing.
        Your technique for orientation will be really useful for these bigger
        attempts. I will definately try again after I take a week&#x27;s break
        (or more with the chaos of Christmas season - clearly I prefer more
        sedate times when I KNOW I will be left alone for such attempts) Maybe
        this tip will be of some use to you or someone else: For corner
        permutation on simple 3x3x3 solves I just memorize the numbers - so few
        and so easy for short term with little data. On bigger cubes and my
        3,4,5 attempt I also used number affiliation. Again I memorized in pairs
        but I tried affiliating the numbers with hockey players. Eg:
        2,4,6,8,1,3,7 Would be (Brian McCabe 24), (Jaromir Jagr 68), (Mats
        Sundin 13), (Gary Roberts 7). Choose numbers according to your favourite
        sports/teams/players. I live in Toronto so I usually choose Maple Leafs

        Excellent advice. The more unusual the memory method, the better it
        works (especially stories). As long as you always associate things in a
        different way each time (for example, if you associate CAR with a
        certain piece, don&#x27;t always make the story involving the car
        driving somewhere. Have new stuff happen to it each time to keep the
        memory hooks more profoud. Have it get stolen by something, or have it
        hit a cat, or whatever!). But yeah a 3x3x3 can be broken down into a few
        simple phrases, really. You could memorize the phrases, come back three
        years later, and still be able to solve it. The key is to make something
        too funny to forget (at least, that&#x27;s what works for me. I always
        make things as absurd as possible, like if I have E H G for example,
        I&#x27;ll think Electric Horse Grease or something. It&#x27;s weird
        enough to never leave the memory). Such methods work well for relays.
        After that you learn to memorize more quickly, and as you learn more
        algorithms, it all starts to come together. --- In

        Hey Marcus, Yes I also try to makes stories funny or absurd too. I also
        try to make stories shocking or disgusting as you put it. I&#x27;ve
        found if you can make a mental image that is really violent or nasty,
        that you also won&#x27;t forget it, same as if it is funny. I know that
        sounds depraved, but I actually heard it from a memory expert. &quot;The
        Terminator&quot; is one of my center pieces and whenever the piece
        enters the cycle he usually ends up assassinating one of the other
        characters in a gruesome fashion. The downside is it&#x27;s a bit
        depraved, but the upside is I don&#x27;t forget my cycles. I do have
        some questions for the 4x4x4, as it is the only >3 cube I&#x27;ve done
        BLD so far. What do you think is a good technique for memorizing the
        edges? I can consistentmy memorize my 4x4 centers in 3 minutes or a bit
        less sometimes, but my edges take me about 4-6 if it is a hard case.
        What is a good way to remember the edges quickly? I currently just
        remember where the pieces go and don&#x27;t use numbers or anything as a
        technique to help. Also, what is a good goal for 4x4x4 memorization in
        your opinion? On a good solve I will memorize in 7 minutes, but a slow
        one can take me as much as 10. Is that good/bad? What should I shoot for
        here? Thanks for the compliment in your other post about cubing stuff,
        but I find your BLD talents far more impressive than the stuff I do.
        Your relays and 5x5 speed are very impressive, and intimidating! I
        wonder how crazy fast you are secretly at 4x4 as well? Your name is not
        on the list ;-) Anyway thanks for any tips about the 4x4. I will move on
        to the 5x5 soon of course, but for now my goal is to thoroughly master
        the 4x4 BLD before moving on. Thanks again, Chris --- In

        Chris, With edge pieces for virtually any cube, including the 4x4x4, I
        use the story method, but in a visual fashion. For example, the upper-
        front-left wing might be an old man&#x27;s house, and let&#x27;s say the
        next cube in the cycle happened to be the lower-front-left wing. I would
        imagine a waterfall going literally down the cube from wing to wing. And
        then let&#x27;s say the next edgewing of the cycle was the one between
        the B and R faces, on the lower half of the cube. I would imagine there
        being a newly-built rollercoaster at the bottom of that waterfall,
        spiraling through the water and curving around to hit the opposite side,
        but since it&#x27;s a new rollercoaster, it doesn&#x27;t quite make it
        to the upper edge, but rather the lower one (which you want). I am sorry
        if that didn&#x27;t make any sense. The basic idea is to create a visual
        story on the cube itself for cubes with multiple edges and wings. For
        example, a permutation of edges might make the shape of a bow or cross
        if you were to draw a line from edge to edge within the same cycle. In
        short, visual on-cube physical patterns are effective ways to memorize
        edge cycles quickly. The trick is to be able to figure out
        perverted/weird/disgusting/cool stories on the spot so you will remember
        your memory hooks, as you have already eloquently stated. As for how
        long memorization takes, I really don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;d say a
        7-minute memorization time for the 4x4x4 is a very good time. The
        corners are the same as a 3x3x3 so those should take the same amount of
        time, obviously, as a 3x3x3. Then stories for the edges are good. For
        the 4x4x4 method I made up a binary method similar to the 3x3x3 edge
        orientation method but I haven&#x27;t actually used it in a while. As
        for solving the 4x4x4 straight-up blindfolded, I just never really got
        around to it, I guess? I was really thirsting after the 5x5x5, mainly
        because it&#x27;s an odd (as opposed to even) cube. Even cubes have a
        certain life of their own. Anyways I hope this helped. There are other
        methods to doing these things that I would be glad to share if you find
        that the methods stated above are inadequate or insufficient. --- In

        It is a bit of both, I think. If one is &quot;naturally gifted&quot;

        In physical sports such as running, you can train very hard but
        ultimately, nature takes over in the levels of the elite. It
        doesn&#x27;t matter how hard you train, someone else will do the same,
        and they&#x27;ll be better with you. For memory with blindfold cubing, I
        have a feeling that it works oppositely. Someone who&#x27;s very gifted
        at memory might have very fast improvement to begin with. Someone who
        isn&#x27;t gifted at memory will have a more difficult time, but
        ultimately with training, I think both minds can reach the same level.
        When I started out, I was taking maybe 3 minutes to memorize the cube. I
        had very rapid improvement and can do under 60 seconds almost every time
        with good times being between 40 and 50. Leyan, on the other hand,
        claims his memory is bad, but I&#x27;ve seen him do some pretty good
        stuff and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s been working on it quite a bit. I
        don&#x27;t really know. Most of this is all theory of course. I do know
        that 15-25 seconds memorization is quite insane, and I&#x27;d be more
        than happy with 30 :-P. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        similar to running 200 meters. Can you run those in 30-40 seconds? Sure.
        Pretty much everybody can, or can train enough to be able to. Can you
        run them in 20 seconds? Probably not. Whether you can run in 30-40
        seconds or not depends not on your abilities, but on your will to do it
        and maybe your will to work for it. For 20 seconds it&#x27;s different,
        most people will never be able to do that no matter how hard they work.
        What I&#x27;m trying to say is that the &quot;ability&quot; issue is a
        small and very low area. Same for memorizing the 3x3 in 30-40 seconds, I
        believe that&#x27;s something pretty much everybody can learn with
        enough work. Ability will distinguish further below, maybe also around
        20 seconds. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve reached already what&#x27;s
        really possible. After all, how many people have really put a lot of
        effort into this? Maybe in 2 years people will think you&#x27;re slow if
        you take more than 40 seconds. Cheers! Stefan

        Lets be hopeful that it dosent depend on nature alone or else i would be
        doomed! You see i have a very bad memory to start with so just
        memorising the cube was a big task for me at the start. But i had read
        in some memory improvement book that the power of self suggestion has
        amazing effects.So i tired that on myself, telling me that even though
        my long term memory is bad, my short term is good, I kept repeating that
        to myself and sure enough i dropped my memorisation times from about ~5
        mins to about ~ 2.5 mins now. This efect may just be because of practice
        or maybe psychological...i cannot tell. But i have seen improvememnts in
        areas unrelated to the cube also, so maybe this could be due to the self
        suggestion thing. I know that i still have a very long way to go, but
        seeing from where i have started, im quite satisfied with me. Sachin. On

        Hey Stefan, I just took two times, 3:27.60 and 3:21.00. I think sub-3
        would be possible on a good solve. Yeah I tend to agree, coming up with
        how to solve the edges is hard, I think 3-4 minutes is really good. I
        think sub-3 would be a really super good solve, but again this
        doesn&#x27;t count recall for the cycles either. Chris --- In

        kidding (not with the time, that one is real). Your approach seems to
        work very well, too, so that&#x27;s one reason I don&#x27;t want to show
        mine yet. When I try it your way, I&#x27;m much much slower than you,
        and I could imagine you can still improve quite a bit. Yours probably
        takes much fewer moves than mine. I estimate I do around 300 moves for
        this. How about you? Cheers! Stefan

        Ok I definitely cannot compete with your times, but you have definitely
        inspired me to try to go faster. I just did two solves counting the
        number of moves for the edges step only and got 146 for the first one
        including my 27 move alg to end an odd cycle. For the second solve I got
        161 using the 27 move odd cycle end alg twice. Wow you really have me
        curious about your approach now. I mean I wonder if maybe I am solving
        too slowly for my method, or maybe I am trying to be too efficient and
        therefore losing time. Grrrr...... I am considering starting to beg lol.
        But not yet.. I want to see if I can come up with these commutators on
        the fly faster than I have been doing so far. Chris --- In

        very nice. Congrats! And wow, I didn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d improve
        that much that fast! How about an average? I just got 2:16.17, single
        times were: 2:10.95 2:36.19 (DNF) 1:58.02 2:12.34 2:16.80 1:56.56
        2:19.24 2:17.01 2:14.65 2:39.96 (1:44.24) The 1:44.24 is my new best,
        but I think 3 edges were solved at the start and the rest might&#x27;ve
        been a 21-cycle. I also thought about my number of moves again, I think
        I should be around 300-350, probably closer to 350. I still haven&#x27;t
        thought the method through completely, but I think I&#x27;ll be a bit
        faster, not slower, when I don&#x27;t have to improvise anymore in the
        special cases. Just like my 3x3 blindsolving and my 4x4 centers
        speedsolving methods, my 4x4 edges blindsolving is built around brute
        force. Rather than slowly climbing over the wall, I run against it fast
        and often until it breaks down :-) Cheers! Stefan

        centers speedsolving is less of a brute force approach, it just shares

        Wow Stefan that video was very impressive! It looks like you are using a
        RrUu alg, or maybe more than one, to solve the edges. After watching
        that I think you would find my edge video quite boring. Basically when
        presented with the next three pieces to cycle I look for the best base
        face, my commutators are of the form [alg to place an edge, turn the
        base slice/face]. So I&#x27;ll spend a few seconds figuring out the best
        setup moves (2 is too many, but sometimes I&#x27;m forced to use 2, I
        try for 1 or to find a commutator based on how they&#x27;re setup
        already). Then I do an 8 move commutator at roughly the speed you
        execute your alg, then I undo the setup moves slowly and move to the
        next three. I can&#x27;t make a video until I get home, so maybe 4-5
        days from now, but after watching yours mine will appear quite boring to
        watch. Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        Alright here&#x27;s my average for edges: 2:11.49, 2:08.62, 2:22.31,
        (1:36.52), 2:41.81, 2:25.22, 2:14.40, 2:25.49, 2:15.28, (3:02.38),
        2:59.92, 1:56.67 = 2:22.12 This average alone convinced me that part of
        my method has to go. I always end an odd edge cycle with my 27 move alg,
        and that approach is horrible. The 3:02.38 had 5 odd cycles. That&#x27;s
        5*27 = 135 moves just to swap 10 pieces. Ridiculous. Interestingly
        though the 1:56 at the end had 3 odd cycles, so 81 moves just to swap 6
        pieces. I wonder what it would have been as one long 23 cycle. Anyway, I
        think I can go faster, but I have to handle odd cycles differently. I
        don&#x27;t really want to solve centers before edges to make it easier
        to handle them, since I like my order. But of course if this problem
        with the edges can only be solved by doing centers before edges during
        the solve, then I guess that is what I&#x27;ll do. The 1:36 is my new
        record, and was a 21 cycle as well. I&#x27;d say I average 1 setup move
        overall. Sometimes I can see a commutator with the way they&#x27;re
        setup, and equally as often I need 2 setup moves. Most of the time I do
        1 setup move. So I&#x27;d say I average right at 1 setup move overall.
        Wow, so yeah I&#x27;m satisfied with my method as being able to get
        better, but man I need a better method for finishing off an odd cycle.
        How do you handle odd cycles? I noticed you say you had
        &quot;parity&quot; which makes me think you either finish with the last
        two edges even if you have a number of odd cycles, or just solve a
        different way than I can think of to solve. Going to start looking for
        algs that perform a double transpostion on edges, does anyone have any?
        Alright, well I&#x27;m off to the drawing board to work on my edges lol,
        they need it. Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hmm.. I&#x27;ve thought about solving by pairs of transpositions for
        ending off more than one odd edge cycle. So if I have two odd cycles and
        I work them down to say (AB) and (CD) to solve the cube. Performing
        (ABC) leaving me with (ADC) and that solves the cube in two 8 move
        commutators. So I can solve with two commutators rather than 54 moves of
        supercube safe parity fixing nonsense. Hmmmm... gotta start messing
        around with this. Plus it leaves me with the most flexibility for
        minimzing setup moves, and also I can probably solve in less than 25
        moves most times. hmmmmmmmm.... I like working on new ideas........

        Wow this is really really really easy!!! I can just think of the two
        transpositions like this, I have (AB) and (CD). So I cycle A to B where
        it&#x27;s supposed to go, and B to either spot in the other
        transposition. After that the A spot (which started as my main spot)
        then cycles to the other spot in the other transposition (the one I
        didn&#x27;t cycle to) which then cycles to the first spot in the second
        transposition. That sounds really hard to say in words, but on the cube
        it is such an easy quick little maneuver!! Stefan, let me practice this
        and really get it down, then I&#x27;ll take another average. Doing my
        solves this way will mean that I only 1/2 the time have to do my super
        ugly 27 move alg, and then only once per solve. And also I can keep my
        same solving order, which I have really grown to like since it makes my
        memorization the most comfortable (I would argue memorization for bigger
        cubes BLD is the MOST important part of the whole solve). Heh heh wow
        this is cool. Give me some time to get used to doing this, and I&#x27;ll
        post another average. Tee hee, man I love BLD solving, it&#x27;s so much

        Hey everyone, Lately my 4x4 BLD has gotten much more accurate. I still
        make some dumb errors (forgetting parity and having a solved cube with
        two corners switched) but I&#x27;m getting much better at setup moves
        for the centers (my old place I used to mess up a lot) and I&#x27;m
        better at remembering longer edge piece cycles. I did two solves today,
        the first was 17 minutes 40 seconds roughly but I forget to swap my two
        corners from the beginning (this still is the place I need to work on
        most). I was frustrated so I immediately did another solve and got a
        successful 16:07.91 :-D Anyway I&#x27;m finding that it&#x27;s getting
        easier and easier to stay focused throughout the whole solve, and a lot
        of my old problems are going away. Now if only I can get over this
        forgetting about corner parity problem I&#x27;ll be golden heh heh. At
        first I thought solving a 4x4x4 cube BLD would mostly be hit or miss,
        but I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m getting better a visualizing
        throughout the whole solve, and accuracy is less of an issue now (but
        corner parity, aaah!!!!) My question to you big cube BLD&#x27;ers is
        this. How should I solve in competition? I mean I want to get a good
        time of course, but it&#x27;s more important to me to just get a
        successful solve. I&#x27;ve found that what allows me to remember the
        edge and center cycles is to just memorize superfast, so that by the
        time I actually start solving them, not much time has passed since I
        finished memorizing them. I definitely go for the recency effect here
        and just try to rehearse the edge cycles (my middle memorization step) a
        bit more than centers so that I don&#x27;t get interference from centers
        or corners. Anyway, I was just curious how I should train for a
        competition? Should I solve a bit slower and memorize better, or should
        I continue memorizing quickly and taking advantage of having centers and
        edges very very recently in my short term memory so that I don&#x27;t
        forget them? Just curious how you pros do this, I&#x27;m a complete
        novice when it comes to doing a big cube BLD in a public setting.
        I&#x27;m going to try to do a solve or two for my family over Christmas
        break, and try to get at least some experience doing this in front of a
        big crowd. Alright, well thanks in advance for any tips about public big
        cube BLD&#x27;ing. Chris

        I&#x27;ve noticed that in competitions most people end up with a DNF, so
        I would focus on accuracy and not speed. Or at least, memorize things in
        such a way that you won&#x27;t forget them. Relying on short term memory
        may work, but sometimes it forces other memorizations out. Devise ways
        of ensuring that the memorized cycles stay in the head. You will find
        that by going for accuracy and not speed, the speed will come naturally.
        Just focus on doing things correctly and consistently first and then you
        will naturally speed up once things become second nature. What are the
        primary algorithms that you use to solve the 4x4x4 BLD, by the way? I
        can post some of mine later on tonight as I have to run off to a final,
        but my execution time for the 4x4x4 is a bit slower and I am wondering
        if it is due to longer algs (and HELLA slower than you and Stefan
        turning-wise... holy crap guys). --- In

        have to try it again then. I think I did and it took me at least 2 most
        of the time. Question: do you have a certain edge place that is always
        part of every 3-cycle you do? Or do you do completely free 3-cycles? Ok,
        now here&#x27;s my method: First scramble the cube and then solve
        centers and corners speedstyle. Now we can begin. First please also
        solve the URf edge any way you like. It&#x27;s not necessary to do this
        at the start but it will make the explanation much easier. Do you know
        my 3x3 blindsolving method and how I solve the edges? I have a fixed
        buffer position from which I solve the edges one by one. That fixed
        buffer position is UR. For my 4x4 edges, I use the same idea: Solve the
        edges one by one, shooting from a certain buffer. But this time, the
        buffer is not fixed at one position: It alternates between UBr and URf.
        At the start (after you solved the URf edge) the buffer is UBr. So look
        at the edge in that position and bring its goal place (i.e. the edge
        currently in that place) to FUr. Now do this algorithm: R U R&#x27;
        U&#x27; (Rr) R&#x27; U R U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27; This brings the edge from
        UBr to FUr so now undo your setup moves and the edge will be solved. Now
        the buffer is at URf. So look at the edge in that position and bring its
        goal place (i.e. the edge currently in that place) to FUr. Now do the
        inverse of the above algorithm, i.e.: (Rr) U R&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27;
        R U R U&#x27; R&#x27; This brings the edge from URf to FUr so now undo
        your setup moves and the edge will be solved. Now the buffer is at UBr
        again. So repeat from now on. Is that clear enough to understand it? I
        pretend to use 2-edge-swaps by alternating between two buffer positions.
        So I think of it as solving with swaps, solving one edge at a time,
        exactly like my 3x3 method. Cheers! Stefan

        There are only 22 possible targets so you can *know* setup moves for all
        of them, and all 16 under the U layer are even covered by two very
        simple rules. - Use only two algs and they are very fast and easy
        (actually you might use them already for 3x3 OLL, at least I do).

        Hey Stefan, Yeah that&#x27;s really cool. And I can see how that creates
        parity and you will have to either &quot;solve parity&quot; or not. What
        do you do if both buffer spots solve though? That is something that also
        gives me problems with your method for 3x3x3. I just don&#x27;t know how
        to handle if the buffer spot solves. For my method I always start with
        UBl. That is my starting spot. If that spot is solved I start at UBr. If
        that spot is also solved I move around the U layer to find an unsolved
        edge, etc.. Ok, so I see where UBl goes, then where the piece in that
        spot goes too. Then I just solve via 3 cycles same as regular 3x3 cycles
        BLD. If the cycle involving UBl is shorter than a 24 cycle, then I find
        the other cycle(s) by hunting for pieces that weren&#x27;t in my first
        cycle. Once I have all 24 pieces accounted for I solve all the even
        cycles, and all the odd cycles down to just 2 pieces swapped. Then I
        used to use my ugly 27 move alg for all odd cycles, but now I use the 2
        three cycles idea (which I missed from your earlier post somehow) and if
        I am left finally with only two edges swapped then i use my 27 move alg.
        Also do you solve centers before edges? I can see how that would make
        your choice of algs much more varied. I have to do everything
        &quot;supercube safe&quot; since my centers are still unsolved when I am
        solving edges. I was wondering why you said to solve centers before
        edges for our examples, since I would only have corners done (or
        simplified to a two swap) at this point. :-D I definitely like your
        method, but I am partial to the freestyle method personally. I am
        horrible at remembering setup moves (I am for 3x3x3 too). I think using
        the freestyle approach helps me overcome this, I would definitely have
        trouble with remembering the setup moves if I used your approach. I
        think the number of moves is not much of an issue for your method, your
        thinking process is MUCH faster than mine, so the more moves are
        executed much faster. I like my approach since it lets me overcome my
        weak spot of dealing with setup moves, but I can see how your method can
        be amazingly fast. To each his own I guess ;-) Much respect though, I
        like your approach a lot, that is a very creative idea! I would be very
        interested in an explanation for how you handle both buffer pieces
        solving though, and the buffer spot solving for your 3x3 method too. I
        want to try your approach for the 3x3x3 too, but can&#x27;t get past
        this hangup. Chris --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        I start every cycle with the lUB spot. If that one solves, I just pick a
        new base spot in the other cycle(s). I use more types of commutators
        now, so I&#x27;m not quite as restrictive as I was back then. I can do
        another example solve if you guys want. I&#x27;ve learned how to use
        commutators much more efficiently since that last example solve, so
        I&#x27;ve been able to minimize my setup moves more than when I wrote
        that solve. Chris

        you and Stefan turning-wise... holy crap guys). Hey Marcus, I really
        don&#x27;t use algorithms in the sense that I think you mean. I just use
        types of commutators, but I perform them from any angle and on any face.
        I am usually cycles from the lUB piece, but if that piece solves I will
        still do commutators on other faces. Here is an exaple of all the types
        of commutators I use involving lUB. lUB -> rUF -> dFL [B d&#x27; B, U2]
        and also the inverse for the opposite direction cycle lUB -> rUF -> uFL
        [B&#x27; u2 B, U2] lUB -> fUL -> dFL [B d&#x27; B&#x27;, U] lUB -> fUL
        -> uFL [B&#x27; u2 B, U] lUB -> dFL -> fUL U B d&#x27; B&#x27; U B d
        B&#x27; U2 lUB -> lUF -> fUL [l, F&#x27; L F] lUB -> lUF -> bUL [B
        L&#x27; B&#x27;, l&#x27;] lUB -> dFL -> dBR [L&#x27; U&#x27; L, d2] The
        list goes on really. I also recognize lots of positions that are 1 move
        away from one of those positions. I really tried to turn the process of
        coming up with a commutator into one that is totally intuitive. I really
        do just come up with these on the fly, but I would say that the ones
        above are the typical forms that I use, but I don&#x27;t just do them
        that way. I would also do the reflections, rotations to other faces,
        etc.. I do like the commutators of the form where I do 3 outer face
        turns, and the single slice is an inner slice. They are much faster to
        do, since I don&#x27;t have to do double layer turns. For the centers I
        use mostly the same ideas, I try to keep them of the same form, or same
        rough idea, just for centers instead of edges. I mean I hope this helps?
        I consider my edges and centers solving to be 100% intuitive, since I
        understand exactly how each commutator works, and I just try to find the
        shortest one (with no setup moves, or as few as possible) to solve the
        three pieces next in my cycle. Hope that helps? Chris

        for 3x3x3. I just don&#x27;t > know how to handle if the buffer spot
        solves. Actually I don&#x27;t like to think of it as two buffers. Only
        as one. It&#x27;s switching between two places, but at one point of
        time, it&#x27;s only at one of the two places. The &quot;buffer
        edge&quot;, i.e. the edge that I ignore the whole time and only solve
        the other 23, is the UBr edge. The URf edge is also special, it&#x27;s a
        &quot;helper&quot; for the buffer. It should only move back and forth
        between the two possible buffer places as an unwanted side effect,
        similar to the URF and UBR corners swapping back and forth as a side
        effect when I solve 3x3 edges. Ideally this URf edge is already solved
        at the start, but since this is usually not the case, I try to let it
        &quot;slip in&quot; when it appears in a cycle. This is the part of my
        method I haven&#x27;t yet fully thought through, though (what a great
        sentence ending :-). To better understand my 4x4 edges method, I&#x27;d
        recommend you first understand my 3x3 method if you have problems with
        that. If the buffer edge is already solved but other pieces are
        unsolved, then I simply &quot;break into&quot; another cycle by pulling
        one of the bad pieces out of the cycle and into the buffer. Then I solve
        that cycle as usual. > Also do you solve centers before edges? Yes I do.
        But the main reason I suggested you solve centers+corners before doing
        edges blindfold-style, is that you can take centers+corners as a
        reference then. If you screw something up, you will notice because of
        destroyed centers or corners. And at the end, the cube will be solved so
        that&#x27;s more beautiful. And solving centers takes me less time than
        solving corners anyway :-) > I would definitely have trouble with
        remembering the setup moves > if I used your approach. What?!? I
        don&#x27;t think so. There are *overall* only 22 setup algs that
        you&#x27;ll *ever* need with my method. And they&#x27;re obvious. I see
        green/white, I setup with D F2. You also practice all of them with every
        solve! The small number of possibilities allows you to *know* a setup
        alg for *every* possibility. You don&#x27;t make them up on the fly.
        Instead, they are hard-coded in your brain. You don&#x27;t need to
        remember the setup alg. You only need to remember the edge you just
        solved, and then undo its setup alg. But I&#x27;ll try your approach,
        too, and see whether my brain can do that :-) Cheers! Stefan

        I can only comment on the English part, but yes, I agree. I think the
        &quot;bouncing 5 balls&quot; and &quot;hitting the right notes on a
        piano keyboard&quot; is just an illusion. I know many people who can
        juggle five balls and there&#x27;s no way you could get that kind of
        accuracy, especially with the width of those keys, while juggling five
        balls. Maybe three... but even then, I highly doubt it... especially at
        that speed. In normal juggling, the &quot;target&quot; is the same with
        each and every throw. Imagine a &#x27;moving&#x27; target that gets set

        Seems like it too. When he&#x27;s playing &quot;La Cucaracha&quot;,
        where there are three of the same note in a row, he is NOT hitting the
        same key three times in a row. That in itself rules out the idea that
        he&#x27;s actually playing the keyboard.

        :) That&#x27;s really clever. I think what I&#x27;ll do to solve the
        &#x27;parity&#x27; is to remember the algorithm that I used last, and if
        it&#x27;s the one I used first (the non-inverse one) I just use an alg
        that swaps UBr and ULf. I&#x27;m using L&#x27; F&#x27; (l&#x27; U2)
        (l&#x27; U2) x (U2 l&#x27;) (U2 r) x&#x27; (U2 r&#x27;) (U2 l2) F L for
        now, but there&#x27;s probibly better. Just one last question: how does
        the helper buffer edge get shoved in? The only way I can think of is to
        look for it at the start and consider it to act as the piece in the
        helper buffer position. The, when you execute, you swap these two pieces
        either at the start or end of the solve. I don&#x27;t get the whole
        &#x27;slip-it-in&#x27; idea yet. Aside from that, it&#x27;s a nice
        method :). ~Thom --- In blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube@yahoogroups.com,

        haven&#x27;t thought through yet. You can of course solve that buffer
        helper right away before doing anything else. At least for me it makes
        thinking easier (and it made the general explanation easier). Ok, let me
        think about slip-in, i.e. solving it on the fly. The idea is that this
        helper (URf) would ideally be solved (i.e. URf piece being in URf place)
        and just switch back and forth between URf and UBr. And the other of the
        two positions would be the buffer from which I shoot an edge to the
        correct position. So let&#x27;s imagine we come across that helper piece
        *during* the solve, i.e. it lands in the buffer. Let&#x27;s first
        consider what I achieve in each step: 1 The piece currently in the
        buffer ends up solved 2 The piece previously in the position of the now
        solved piece is now in the buffer 3 The buffer has switched between UBr
        and URf Now how do we react if we find the helper in the buffer? This
        means the bufferPlace contains the helperPiece. The answer: Do nothing!
        Just pretend you&#x27;ve done a step and continue. Why is this correct?
        3 bufferPlace has switched from UBr to URf (by pretending so) 1
        helperPiece got solved (it&#x27;s at UBr, the other of the two places) 2
        The piece which was in helperPlace is now in the buffer That surprises
        me, I&#x27;m somewhat shocked it&#x27;s so easy. Man, I should&#x27;ve
        thought about this earlier... Cheers! Stefan

        Ooops. The setup moves for that alg are suppost to be R&#x27;F&#x27; and
        FR. The helper edge method you have is pretty cool, Took me a while but
        eventually I got my head around how it works. Just did an example while
        looking solve and all is well :) I think during memorising and when you
        get to the helper piece, you tag &#x27;helper&#x27; or something onto it
        you you know to skip doing that alg that go. I memorise spatially, so
        I&#x27;ll just think that piece is &#x27;hot&#x27; or something. Another
        idea I had this morning, was to just find the helper piece and turn the
        cube around so it is in place. Then you memorise around that. It&#x27;s
        more restrictive when you come to memorisation freedom, but at least you
        don&#x27;t have to worry about the helper piece at all. Plus, it helps
        having a little place to referance from. Neverthe less, I will be using
        this or a varient of this method when I do 4x4x4 :) ~Thom --- In
