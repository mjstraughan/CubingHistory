        I haven&#x27;t actually looked at anyone&#x27;s method, except for a
        quick 10 second glance at Richard Carr&#x27;s page. Really all I got
        from Richard&#x27;s page was that he numbers the pieces. Anyway
        I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of thinking about my method and I think I
        might be able to significantly reduce my solving time for doing the cube
        blindfolded using the Fridrich method. Right now I estimate the limit to
        be about an hour with memorizing and solving, but I&#x27;m not very sure
        of the accuracy of that right now. I&#x27;m not sure how practical this
        is, as it is essentially purposefully doing a problem one of the hardest
        ways possible and trying to get good at it, but I&#x27;m interested to
        see what happens. Anyway I&#x27;m going to be very stubborn and not look
        at any of the other pages until I really work my method out. I&#x27;ll
        probably devote a section of my page to it once I really work all the
        kinks of it, in case anyone ever feels inclined to do it the hard way :)
        I wish everyone the best of luck in their blindfolded achievments, Chris

        I&#x27;m trying to learn to do the cube blindfolded exactly the same way
        as when I speed solve it, only it should actually be more like me
        solving for fewest moves since I have more time to think about it. At
        least that&#x27;s my goal anyway. Not sure if it&#x27;s practical but I
        want to try it. I figure if I can work on the mental aspect of following
        the pieces then I could probably do this pretty quickly (maybe sub-1
        hour but I&#x27;m not sure about that yet). Chris --- In

        What about a midway method ? It&#x27;s really easier to keep a numbers
        list (one dimensional) in memory than a colored cube (3D). But it&#x27;s
        much more efficient to apply algos that will move several pieces at a
        time like f2l or LL algs. I was wondering of the possibility of an
        hybrid method that would work like this : Orienting the corners : with
        the digit sequence for orientation we mentally compute a unique number.
        This number will refer to a specific algorithm which will solve the
        whole corners orientation without touching the corners permutations or
        the edges in any way. We would basically do the same thing for permuting
        the corners and for the edges in several steps. I don&#x27;t know the
        feasibility of such a method... For exemple how many orient/permuts
        exists for the 8 corners ? With Carr&#x27;s method corners are solved
        using very few algorithms. But since algorithms are fore-memorized we
        should store more of them for blindfoldspeedcubing. The main problem of
        the fridrich method (for blindfold) is that every single alg will
        scramble the rest of the cube. It&#x27;s determinant to find a technique
        that do solve the cube gradually so we don&#x27;t have to update or save
        again the sequence number memorized at the beginning...( an edges first
        method might do this ?? ) jo.

        My first cube solved blindfolded !!!! :-) It took me 10 minutes for
        memorizing the cube, and 30 minutes for solving. The main problem seems
        to be the permutation of edges. Have you got any tip allowing you to

        They&#x27;re not in production yet though, right? That would be hard.
        Generally speaking going up a size increases the difficulty a lot. For
        instance, a Revenge is much harder than 2 3x3x3&#x27;s, maybe harder
        than 3 3x3x3&#x27;s. You don&#x27;t have to remember as much but you
        can&#x27;t put as much to the back of your mind as doing separate cubes.
        Also the algorithms tend to be longer so it takes more time to finish
        and that in itself makes it harder. Plus they are really much harder to
        twist. You get very nervous when it feels as if maybe the centre pieces
        are about to come off and break away from the puzzle as you are twisting
        but you can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s best to make sure the puzzle stays in
        one piece. I think 6x6x6 would be too hard for me at the moment.
        Probably need to do at least a 4x4x4 and a 5x5x5 first and before that 3
        3x3x3s and a 5x5x5. Maybe some day... That megaminx is a bit troublesome
        too. It&#x27;s pretty difficult to keep the orientation of the puzzle as
        a whole in mind. > > > > >From: GameOfDeath2

        ago. And today I have solved my first (and second and third and
        fourth...etc.) blindfolded 2x2x2 cube. Nothing compared to some of you
        pros, but it&#x27;s a step in the right direction! I&#x27;ve done it
        correctly probably around 10 times today. Takes me about 3-5 minutes
        with memorization, but for a newb, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s too
        terrible. I&#x27;ll practice this for a while longer before I attempt
        the 3x3x3. Anyway, just thought I&#x27;d share! Daniel

        Hi all, I solved 2 cubes blindfolded today. I just thought I should do
        this to get myself ready for 5x5x5... It took me 12:20, and I don&#x27;t
        think I can improve much on it at this point. gotta practice this some
        more before I can memorize the 5x5x5... almost gave me a headache... I
        don&#x27;t know how you can do 3-5 all at once, Dr.C! Macky

        I know many of you frequent the speedsolving rubiks group, but I thought
        i&#x27;d mention it here too. I just did my first 3x3x3 blindfolded :)
        total time was somewhere around 25-30 minutes, 15-20 mem and about 10
        solution. I&#x27;m very happy :) Daniel

        Here is most of Richard&#x27;s advanced method in one email, a total of
        95 algorithms! These appeared in instalments over at speedsolving. I
        have changed some values to make it more useful for me to see -- at a
        glance -- probabilities. My thinking is that this is too much for one
        person to memorize (though I would love it if someone proved me wrong)
        but that the list can be used to assemble a shorter list (that is what I
        am doing now). This could drastically cut down execution times for
        blindfolding. All credit goes to Dr C., of course. S. Total average

        Thanks very much, that&#x27;s very useful indeed! I&#x27;ll probably
        just practice quite a bit. once I get the memorization time down, then
        I&#x27;ll work on getting the solution method down. Daniel -----

        advanced method Here is most of Richard&#x27;s advanced method in one
        email, a total of 95 algorithms! These appeared in instalments over at
        speedsolving. I have changed some values to make it more useful for me
        to see -- at a glance -- probabilities. My thinking is that this is too
        much for one person to memorize (though I would love it if someone
        proved me wrong) but that the list can be used to assemble a shorter
        list (that is what I am doing now). This could drastically cut down
        execution times for blindfolding. All credit goes to Dr C., of course.
