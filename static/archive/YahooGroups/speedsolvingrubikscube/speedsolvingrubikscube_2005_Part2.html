        Option 1) Answer "You say you know it. How do you know? Go ask the
        person who told you that." Option 2) Answer "How can an equation solve
        the cube? How does it even twist it? " Option 3) Answer "What do you
        mean?". If they still don't shut up, go to option 2 before trying
        anything else. Let them at least tell you what they mean/want. Option 4)
        Provide a short version of God's algorithm, e.g.: a) neighbours of a
        state are the states reachable in 1 move b) distance( solved state ) = 0
        c) for all states s, distance( s ) = 1 + Min(over all neighbours n of s)
        distance( n ) Ok so it's not a single equation but several. Also,
        neighbours could/should be defined with equations as well. And it's not
        a solution but then again saying "equation that solves the cube" is
        pretty nonsense (see option 2 above). It can be used to solve the cube
        with the instruction "always do a move that results in a state with
        smaller distance value". Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Well, I've somehow managed to get &lt;1 standard deviation averages
        using both a Fridrich 4 look LL method and with the Roux method. Of
        course, that only happens when I'm concentrating considerably, and it
        seems I'm another practitioner of Gille's religion: laziness. Also, I've
        been learning so many new methods and so much lately my averages have
        gone way down hill, but I expect with a healthy amount of shut-in
        practice, they should get back in shape. -Mike Bennett [Non-text

        Hey everyone, I posted this message on the corners first group already,
        but since it has been quiet there lately, and I would really need a
        response by Thursday this week in order to help me, I decided to post
        here too in case any of you corners first solvers read this group too.
        -------------- I post a lot at the international forum but haven't
        posted here before, and I have a corners first specific quesiton. I'm
        studying at college and it turns out that one of the guys on my hall is
        a corners first cuber. He recently asked me about where to start to
        learn more about cubing/speedcubing, specifically about the layer by
        layer method. I told him, though, that since he is already comfortable
        and used to corners first solving that there is no reason he should
        switch to layer by layer. &gt;From what he's told me about how he solves
        I get the impression that he uses a beginner/intermediate approach. What
        I'm going to do is to show him ways to make his current steps more
        efficient. The problem with this is that I am a diehard layers solver. I
        already know that for solving the last 4 corners he only uses 1 or 2
        algorithms, so that step needs work. Also I was going to point him to
        the algorithms on speedcubing.com about solving the last edge (the 8th
        edge, such that only the middle layer is left unsolved) and also orient
        the middle layer edges. I have messed around with corners first solving
        before and came up with my own version of a probably fairly widely used
        approach. I average about 50 seconds with this method. What I do is
        this: 1) solve the first 4 corners intuitively 2) solve the last 4 in
        one alg using COLL (NOT CLL, I use COLL simply because I know them from
        layers solving. If this guy gets interested in learning more algs I
        would point him towards CLL and _not_ COLL) 3) solve the 8 top and
        bottom layer edges, making sure to try to insert two at a time whenever
        possible. I insert the last two at the same time. 4) permute the middle
        layer edges 5) orient the LL edges in one alg I personally am not very
        fast with this method, but does it seem that it could be made fairly
        fast with practice? Should I teach the guy on my hall this method? For
        step 2 I would show him how to orient and then permute the corners using
        9 algs (7 to orient and 2 to permute) rather than say "learn CLL, it's
        only 40 algs". Should I tell him to look at the algs for inserting the
        8th edge (completing the two opposite layers) while also orienting the
        middle layer edges? It seems like there are only 8, since the 4 middle
        layer edge orientations have 8 different possibilites. Of course I
        haven't learned them, so I don't know if that is true in practice.
        Anyway I would appreciate some help. This guy sounds interested in
        learning more about cubing, and I really don't want to make him a
        Fridrich clone. Since he is already comfortable with corners first
        solving, I'd rather show him an intermediate/advanced corners first
        approach. Thanks, Chris

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey there, Chris. In an attempt not to become a Fridrich clone myself,
        I've been experimenting with various methods recently. My primary method
        is now the Roux method, which I use to average around 34. I started
        toying with my own corners first method recently, though, and have used
        it to teach a few friends, with minimal effort and a heck of a lot less
        memorization than the 40 COLL algs you suggested. It's not an advanced
        method by any means, but I feel it has merit because it's upgradable
        without having to abandon. Here's an attempt at an explanation. If you
        decide you'd like to know more, let me know and I'll elaborate. 1) Solve
        bottom corners intuitively. Usually takes somewhere around 7 or 8 moves.
        2) U layer corners in two looks. Algorithms, including reflections: 9 3)
        D layer edges. 5 incredibly simple (no more than 4 moves) cases covers
        all possibilities, including reflections. 4) Insert middle layer edges,
        controlling as much orientation as possible: 2 cases (edge 3 cycle and
        mirror). 5) Orient U layer edges. 3 algorithms cover all cases in a
        maximum of 2 steps. 6) Permute U layer edges. 3 cases. Using this
        method, which requires minimal memorization (the second step is easily
        solvable using a grand total of a corner swapping algorithm and
        Sune/antiSune but I use a few extras from my Fridrich method) I am able
        to solve the cube in under 45 seconds on average and around 75-80 moves.
        I've managed a single sub 30, but I got fairly lucky. My usual faster
        times are in the low and mid 30's with it. I'm sure if I worked on the
        method and practiced a little sub 35 averages would be attainable
        without major upgrading. I'm curious to see what you think. Let me know
        and I'll give you a list of sequences, though I'm sure you already know
        all of them already. =) -Mike Bennett ----- Original Message ----- From:

        When I cubed in the 80s and then again when I restarted I just chose the
        colour that looked easiest. But the consensus here seemed to be that it
        was faster to always start with the same colour so I switched. I've been
        cubing with the same colour for quite a few months now and probably

        About the "single trick to solve the cube" thing. I guess if someone was
        taught, and really understood, about conjugates they would be able to
        solve and would consider that to be a "trick". Thats the way I first

        Option 1) &gt; Answer "You say you know it. How do you know? Go ask the
        person who &gt; told you that." &gt; &gt; Option 2) &gt; Answer "How can
        an equation solve the cube? How does it even twist it? &gt; " &gt; &gt;
        Option 3) &gt; Answer "What do you mean?". If they still don't shut up,
        go to option &gt; 2 before trying anything else. Let them at least tell
        you what they &gt; mean/want. &gt; &gt; Option 4) &gt; Provide a short
        version of God's algorithm, e.g.: &gt; a) neighbours of a state are the
        states reachable in 1 move &gt; b) distance( solved state ) = 0 &gt; c)
        for all states s, &gt; distance( s ) = 1 + Min(over all neighbours n of
        s) distance( n ) &gt; Ok so it's not a single equation but several.
        Also, neighbours &gt; could/should be defined with equations as well.
        And it's not a &gt; solution but then again saying "equation that solves
        the cube" is &gt; pretty nonsense (see option 2 above). It can be used
        to solve the cube &gt; with the instruction "always do a move that
        results in a state with &gt; smaller distance value". &gt; &gt; Cheers!

        I use the Lars Petrus method with fixed coulours. I decided not to
        always use the same colour since I can get really nasty positions for a
        2x2x2. But I always go for the same 2x2x3, that is the yellow-gree one,
        so at the begining I can choose between two different 2x2x2's. I do that
        because after that I'm left with white and blue colours as the two-
        generator colours, which have the biggest contrast on the cube so seeing
        the bad edges happens almost instantly. Then I usually try to leave
        white as LL because of your reasons: it's bright. I also think that
        using the same colour for LL helps memorising the positions much faster.

        If you need a pure corners-first approach for your guy, he can try: - 4
        + 4 (but not CLL sequences, Waterman's for example or shorter/faster). -
        Gaétan's or even easier: -
        http://www.ai.sri.com/~cheyer/rubiks/rubiks.html -
        http://rubikscube.info/ortega.html But I feel that keeping all the edges
        unsolved is less efficient, because with a same number of pieces, it's
        faster to recognize them if they belong to 2 distinct categories. A good
        compromise (not strictly corners-first) between speed and complexity
        could be: - Solve L face minus 1 edge (Waterman's way, 1x2x3 + 2
        corners, etc). - Solve the last 4 corners. - Solve 3 R-edges + 1
        L/R-edge. - Solve the last L/R-edge while orienting M-edges. - Permute
        M-edges. Thierry Gagnaire says he was sub-19 with it, I'm very confident

        &gt; I post a lot at the international forum but haven't posted here
        &gt; before, and I have a corners first specific quesiton. &gt; &gt; I'm
        studying at college and it turns out that one of the guys on my &gt;
        hall is a corners first cuber. He recently asked me about where to &gt;
        start to learn more about cubing/speedcubing, specifically about the
        &gt; layer by layer method. I told him, though, that since he is already
        &gt; comfortable and used to corners first solving that there is no
        reason &gt; he should switch to layer by layer. &gt; &gt; From what he's
        told me about how he solves I get the impression that &gt; he uses a
        beginner/intermediate approach. What I'm going to do is to &gt; show him
        ways to make his current steps more efficient. The problem &gt; with
        this is that I am a diehard layers solver. &gt; &gt; I already know that
        for solving the last 4 corners he only uses 1 or 2 &gt; algorithms, so
        that step needs work. Also I was going to point him to &gt; the
        algorithms on speedcubing.com about solving the last edge (the 8th &gt;
        edge, such that only the middle layer is left unsolved) and also &gt;
        orient the middle layer edges. &gt; &gt; I have messed around with
        corners first solving before and came up &gt; with my own version of a
        probably fairly widely used approach. I &gt; average about 50 seconds
        with this method. &gt; &gt; What I do is this: &gt; 1) solve the first 4
        corners intuitively &gt; 2) solve the last 4 in one alg using COLL (NOT
        CLL, I use COLL simply &gt; because I know them from layers solving. If
        this guy gets interested &gt; in learning more algs I would point him
        towards CLL and _not_ COLL) &gt; 3) solve the 8 top and bottom layer
        edges, making sure to try to &gt; insert two at a time whenever
        possible. I insert the last two at the &gt; same time. &gt; 4) permute
        the middle layer edges &gt; 5) orient the LL edges in one alg &gt; &gt;
        I personally am not very fast with this method, but does it seem that
        &gt; it could be made fairly fast with practice? Should I teach the guy
        on &gt; my hall this method? For step 2 I would show him how to orient
        and &gt; then permute the corners using 9 algs (7 to orient and 2 to
        permute) &gt; rather than say "learn CLL, it's only 40 algs". &gt; &gt;
        Should I tell him to look at the algs for inserting the 8th edge &gt;
        (completing the two opposite layers) while also orienting the middle
        &gt; layer edges? It seems like there are only 8, since the 4 middle
        layer &gt; edge orientations have 8 different possibilites. Of course I
        haven't &gt; learned them, so I don't know if that is true in practice.
        &gt; &gt; Anyway I would appreciate some help. This guy sounds
        interested in &gt; learning more about cubing, and I really don't want
        to make him a &gt; Fridrich clone. Since he is already comfortable with
        corners first &gt; solving, I'd rather show him an intermediate/advanced
        corners first &gt; approach. &gt; &gt; Thanks, &gt; Chris

        Yes this seems like an okay intermediate corners first method. Yo, i
        wish u'd stick to that method chris. Then i could beat u ;-) Even if i
        use that method also. Im about 35-40 secs with such a method. One
        suggestion though, complete first layer before doing last 4 corners. Yes
        i know it's then not longer a pure corners first approach. Inserting
        edges into bottom layer (first solved layer remains at top when i do
        this approach) is easy with an alg like this : R' E R2 E R' or R E' R2
        E' R (first one backwards). A more advanced approach will orient the
        middle edges while doing the edges on the bottom layer. Or one could
        learn all the cases for edges on the middle layers. I once worked out
        all those algs. It's not all that many. Orient edges then position them
        is also not that bad. (This is opposite order of what u suggested
        chris!) There are a few bad cases for that when all edges need be
        flipped. Those are better dealt with by simply doing 2 edge-cycles. Ie
        diverting from the orient/permute pattern. &gt; Thanks, &gt; Chris Happy

        Yes, another method idea :P The one I'm about to describe has been
        inspired by a variety of different methods. While I'm sure it's been
        explored, I have yet to see it discussed. Step 1: Solve [D] layer except
        for one corner slot Step 2: Orient and Permute LL edges using the empty
        corner slot Step 3: Orient and Permute Middle Layer Step 4: Solve
        remaining corners This is a simplified version of the idea. I haven't
        persued learning it yet because I'm not sure if it's worth the trouble.

        Thanks for the help everybody, I guess mainly what I am looking for is a
        way to show this guy how to improve his method without saying to just
        learn lots of algs. I'm not sure how into speedcubing he is, but I
        assume since he seemed willing to learn a whole new method that he is
        fairly dedicated. I guess for now I'll show him the 9 algs necessary to
        do the last four corners relatively quickly (since he only uses I think
        2 now), as well as point him to the algs for inserting the 8th edge
        (such that only the middle layer is left) and also orient all middle
        layer edges at the same time. That is 17 algs, or I guess 25 if you
        count reflections, which seems like a reasonable amount given that I
        think he is fairly dedicated. Am I correct that there are only 8 (16
        with reflections) algs necessary for inserting the 8th edge and flipping
        the middle layer edges? I don't want to tell him to learn that step but
        it turn out to be a huge number of algs. I figure this method is
        scalable if he gets into speedcubing since the 9 algs for the last 4
        corners are all useful CLL algs, leaving only 31 if he decides to learn
        that. Also the algs to insert that last edge and flip the middle layer
        edges seem to be mentioned a lot on corners first sites and for corners
        first solving, so it seems like a useful set of algs to know, even if
        just for special cases in more advanced methods. I figure I'll also
        learn those edge algs along with this guy. I think it would be cool to
        expand my corners first knowledge, so this is also partially a selfish
        pursuit in that it is a convenient opportuity for me to learn about
        corners first solving. If anyone else has any more ideas for
        beginner/intermediate corners first adaptations please keep posting!

        algs I would point him towards CLL and _not_ COLL) &gt; &gt; 3) solve
        the 8 top and bottom layer edges, making sure to try to &gt; &gt; insert
        two at a time whenever possible. I insert the last two at &gt; the &gt;
        &gt; same time. &gt; &gt; 4) permute the middle layer edges &gt; &gt; 5)
        orient the LL edges in one alg &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I personally am not
        very fast with this method, but does it seem &gt; that &gt; &gt; it
        could be made fairly fast with practice? Should I teach the &gt; guy on
        &gt; &gt; my hall this method? &gt; &gt; Yes this seems like an okay
        intermediate corners first method. Yo, i &gt; wish u'd stick to that
        method chris. Then i could beat u ;-) Even if &gt; i use that method
        also. Im about 35-40 secs with such a method. &gt; &gt; One suggestion
        though, complete first layer before doing last 4 &gt; corners. Yes i
        know it's then not longer a pure corners first &gt; approach. Inserting
        edges into bottom layer (first solved layer &gt; remains at top when i
        do this approach) is easy with an alg like &gt; this : R' E R2 E R' or R
        E' R2 E' R (first one backwards). A more &gt; advanced approach will
        orient the middle edges while doing the edges &gt; on the bottom layer.
        Or one could learn all the cases for edges on &gt; the middle layers. I
        once worked out all those algs. It's not all &gt; that many. Orient
        edges then position them is also not that bad. &gt; (This is opposite
        order of what u suggested chris!) There are a few &gt; bad cases for
        that when all edges need be flipped. Those are better &gt; dealt with by
        simply doing 2 edge-cycles. Ie diverting from the &gt; orient/permute
        pattern. &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; Happy cubing!

        http://rubikscube.info/ortega.html ), it allows you to solve the corners
        faster than using a 2-stage CLL for about the same number of sequences!

        &gt; I don't think this is true at all. Though I agree with you, I'm not
        sure I agree with your arguments. &gt; 1. The 4x4x4 has way more
        combinations than the 3x3x3 The 5x5x5 has way more combinations than the
        4x4x4, but I would consider it "easier" because of the lack of parities.
        The megaminx has more combinations than the 4x4x4, but I would consider
        it easier, too, because it can be solved almost exactly like the 3x3x3.
        The 2x2x2 has more combinations than a pyraminx, but I consider the
        pyraminx to be MUCH easier to solve...Difficulty of puzzles can be very
        opinionated. &gt; 2. The most popular method is to unite the edges and
        centers, then solve like a &gt; 3x3x3. Perhaps that's not the "easiest"
        method to use for solving a 4x4x4. There are certainly other ways to
        solve it. Maybe some of the other ways of solving a 4x4x4 are easier?
        You say it requires a "different approach, so maybe the approach that is
        mentioned is easier than that off a 3x3x3 (note: I don't agree with
        this, but it is possible). &gt; 3. The world record time for the 4x4x4
        is at least 5 times as much as the 3x3x3. The world record time for
        blindsolving a 3x3x3 is nearly twice as fast as solving a 3x3x3 with
        feet, but surely it's not easier to solve it blindfolded (only faster
        :P). Speed and difficulty don't necessarily correlate to each other.

        &gt; Just wondering, do you think learning ZB will improve your times on
        &gt; bigger cubes at all? Hey, Yes I think it will. I've already
        experimented with doing ZBF2L on the 4x4x4 and had positive results, and
        once I am comfortable with all the ZBF2L algs on the 3x3x3 I am going to
        start relearning them for one-handed solving since I think it will help
        for that too. I mentioned a little bit about my 4x4x4 ZBF2L solving on
        my ZB progress page http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/myzb.html Once I am
        completely comfortable with using ZBF2L on the 3x3x3 normally I'll start
        working on the other categories. I think ZBLL is a bad idea for the
        4x4x4 since it is possible to have two corners switched (which can be
        tricky to recognize and cause problems sometimes), so my 4x4x4 strategy
        will most likely be just ZBF2L / COLL / PLL. Also on a side note I'm
        getting lots of sub-20 ZBF2L averages, and I set a non-lucky 12 second
        solve already using ZB techniques! I'm improving slowly but steadily. I
        think I'll go sub-19 fairly soon, maybe in a week or two. I still don't
        know if ZB will compare to Fridrich or Gilles' method, but I am of
        course trying to see how well I do when I have practiced the system
        more. Of course I'm curious if the method will help me improve my times,
        and I'd be happy if it would, but I'm just having fun learning a new
        method right now. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Make it into a simple commutator. Using simple setup moves (D2 B2 and

        Hey, Well, there are many speedcubing methods that you could learn, but
        the Fridrich method is the most common. If you are interested in
        learning it, try to learn to do the first two layers (F2L) intuitively
        so that you can place corner-edge pairs into their proper slots
        simultaneously. Then I would recommend learning PLL algorithms, and then
        the orientations. There are plenty of websites to learn these things
        from. Good luck, Bob --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi Per, At the Caltech Winter Tournament 2004 Tyson held a "Champion's
        solve." I thought that Macky might try it on a Deluxe so I loaned him
        one of mine. He solved it in less than 13 seconds. There was a bit of a
        mix up, and before he tried the "Champion's" scramble on the Deluxe he
        solved that scramble on another cube, though it turned out that he had
        solved it differently on the Deluxe. When I got home I discovered that I
        had accidently loaned Macky the wrong cube, he had done that solve on an
        older Deluxe which wasn't lubed. There used to be a video of the (12
        point something) solve on Dan Henage's page, but it's not there right
        now. Regards, David J --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi, I think that Fridrich is also a good method for beginner. I started
        cubing seriously in February and I have a personnal best time of 24.77
        and a best average of 36.66 with that method. You really should try to
        do the F2L steps first by searching yourself (or ask someone to explain
        you the general idea) then optimize your moves with the solutions you
        can find nearly evrywhere. But before that, I recommend you to learn the
        OLL and at least both the U and A PLL's (U changes 3 edges and A changes
        3 corners) because they enable you to solve any situation on the top
        layer. Then learn some other (for example : 2 opposite edges).. and with
        work you should see your times being improved. ;-) Good Luck ! --- In

        If a beginner wants to seriously optimize their times without extreme
        and outrageous amounts of memorization, they should check out Andy
        Camann's site. His explanation of the working corner method explanation
        is fantastic. Using that method, low 30's averages are possible, and
        from there, F2L is much easier to understand once you decide to upgrade.
        One needs not learn all of the OLL or even the PLL in order to average
        sub-30. Improving first two layers time is the way to improvement for
        beginners. Otherwise, I recommend using either the Petrus method or
        looking into corners first solutions. They often require minimal
        memorization and result in great times and fewer moves on average.
        http://rubikscube.info&lt;http://rubikscube.info/&gt; is a fantastic
        site for such solutions. Whatever method you choose, good luck and happy
        cubing. -Mike Bennett [Non-text portions of this message have been

        useful, learn both at the same time, if you can. To &gt; practice, start
        &gt; with a solved cube and apply A (once) then A' &gt; (twice) then A
        (twice), &gt; and so on. That way you regularly get to see the &gt;

        well lets just say from what i know, macky knows a lot. he pretty much
        learned how to solve the cube using corner method, fridrich, and also a
        bunch of other methods including ring method. he can pretty much solve
        the cube with the other methods in about 30sec. in a case like this, its
        true that learning lots about the cube, not only the fridrich can really
        lend a helping hand by making you really understand the way the cube
        pieces moves, and from experience, you can do many other nifty algs and
        tricks even while using the fridrich method. sincerely, John BTW:
        rumours about macky learnt all the ZB aint true. i heard it from him
        myself. --- d_j_salvia &lt;d_j_salvia@...&gt; wrote: &gt; &gt; Hi Per,

        My way of memorising. I order the cases. Then I memorise each algroithm
        in order in my head - just the moves. I dont always even touch a cube at
        this stage although sometimes it helps especially if I'm choosing
        between two possible algs. once they are memorised in my head then I
        start to practice with them. Its slow at first because I have to
        recognise a case, then where it appears in my ordering, then translate
        the moves in my head into real moves on the cube. The benefit is that I
        can start using the algs much sooner. and without having to carry pieces
        of paper around too much. Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From:

        &gt; &gt; At the moment I'm trying a thing recommeded to me regarding
        memorizing &gt; algs and their cases. &gt; &gt; I've printed out each
        case (using imagecube, size 200) on a sqaure piece &gt; of paper (I
        actually printed several on the same paper and them cut them &gt; into
        squares :). At first I lay them out on the table, doing all the &gt;
        separate algs over and over, until the cube is restored. When I feel a
        &gt; bit more confident, I draw random alg-papers and do the algs.
        Thereby &gt; learning the alg and learning to recognize the case. Seems
        to work &gt; pretty good so far. &gt; &gt; /Gustav &gt; &gt; dwarmaj

        Hey all you math people, We haven't had an interesting discussion
        lately, so I figured I would post a question I've been thinking about. I
        hope it hasn't been asked before, but here goes. I visited my cousin not
        too long ago and was cubing a little bit, he can't solve the cube yet
        but is interested to learn how. I was giving him some puzzles to solve
        (6 move patterns such as R2 U2 R2 L2 U2 L2) to get him started before I
        start showing him the full solution. Anyway he gave me a puzzle and told
        me to make a position such that no two stickers of the same color are
        touching on any face. I started from a solved cube and did the
        superflip, but then he said that the diagonal X's on the faces count as
        two like colored stickers touching since they share a corner. He also
        said that I should do this so that diagonally across an edge should
        count too. So that would mean that the F sticker of UF is adjacent to
        the U stickers of both ULF and URF. I had a hard time thinking of a way
        to do this, but I found one. Switch every corner with it's opposite
        across the body diagonal of the cube (4 transpositions), then do the
        superflip and viola! My question is though, is this the only position
        where this works? The puzzle is to find a (of course legal) position on
        the cube such that no two adjacent stickers (either horizontally,
        vertically, or diagonally if on the same face - or horizontally or
        diagonally across an edge of the cube) are the same color. My alg to set
        this case up is a bit long, 2 permutations and then the superflip, but I
        used Cube Explorer to find a shorter move: D' U F2 . B L R D' B2 R2 D' B
        F' R B2 R' F2 R' (perform on a solved cube). Is this the only possible
        position? By that I mean this type of position performed on any of the
        24 possible rotations of the cube. Chris

        In my last post I forgot to mention this also includes all possible
        rotations of the corners. So switching every corner with its body
        diagonally opposite corner, then doing the superflip, then allowing the
        corners to have all 3^7 possible orientations gives 2187 different
        positions such that the puzzle my cousin gave me is satisfied. I meant,
        is there a different permutation of the pieces that, given you fix the
        orientations correctly, still satisifes the puzzle? Chris

        Hi Per, Hmm...would you please tell me where on earth people talk about
        me (or anyone!) having learned all of ZB? =) My method is Fridrich with
        the following: - extended cross when possible - other block approaches
        to F2L when appropriate - F2L using empty slots with cross on bottom or
        left - multiple algs memorized for most c-e pairs used in such a way
        that there is minimum pause (_not_ to control edge orientation) -
        avoiding 4 wrong LL edges when fixing the fourth slot (but only when it
        flows nicely from the rest of the F2L) - the nicer patterns from COLL
        when all LL edges are correct (if it's not a nice COLL, I just use the
        normal OLL pattern but still know what corner permutation it's going to
        end up with.) - PLL recognition by blocks of same colors; AUF at end or
        beginning, never both - slamming down the cube pretty quickly ;) I know
        several algorithms for each F2L, but I haven't actually sit down and
        memorized their effects on edge orientation. Like Ron (read the comments
        on his new record!), I'm doubting the theoretical benefits of ZB. The
        number of moves in ZB is very appealing, but I find that F2L is much
        faster without it. Of course, maybe it'll all be very smooth once you
        master ZBF2L. I used a new 25th anniversary cube (best of the 20
        purchased) to set the new average. The cube is pretty lubed right
        now...I thought until now that stiff (but soft) cubes work better for me
        (because I'm not very fast at LL), but this cube is very nice. It is
        true that I used a Deluxe at one point. It was with a Deluxe that I came
        very near to the 15 sec barrier. The only reason I haven't touched it
        recently is because it's not tuned, and that takes longer than buying
        new cubes. I have to thank David for the Deluxe, of course. I plan to
        work much more with it once it's adjusted. =) I don't think that I will
        ever work too much with the 5-by. I'm finding it much harder to pair up
        the edges for this size than it is for the 4-by. I've never even had a

        I did think at one point that you had learned most if not all of ZBF2L,
        since at the time I thought you did COLL for nearly every solve (because
        of the frequent PLL skips). I don't know how or why I got that
        impression, but I will admit that I may have spread a rumor or two that
        I thought you had or were learning ZBF2L. ;-) Chris --- In

        Hi Macky! Or u prefer ppl call u Shotaro? Well, most simply call u Macky
        so i just follow suite :-) The rumour about that u know all zb stuff (or
        at least a large part of it) i cant really recall where it comes from.
        It's something i heard almost a yr ago now. Which means u must have
        learnt it really quickly since it was very new at that time ;-) So
        indeed i was sceptical about it. And yes i agree with u that a "simple"
        method can be just as fast or faster than a more sophisticated method.
        Cause fewer cases to distinguish and u get less time lost in
        recognition, better flow and better lookahead. Even if u should learn
        optimised fingertricks for 700 algs it won't help u much if u need 1 sec
        to recognize a case :- o 3 steps is then 3 lost secs ... What is the
        difference between the 25th anniversary cube and the diy- kit? I mean
        also the geometry of the cubies, not only the assembly/tuning. Cheers!

        Hmm...would you please tell me where on earth people talk about me &gt;
        (or anyone!) having learned all of ZB? =) &gt; &gt; My method is
        Fridrich with the following: &gt; - extended cross when possible &gt; -
        other block approaches to F2L when appropriate &gt; - F2L using empty
        slots with cross on bottom or left &gt; - multiple algs memorized for
        most c-e pairs used in such a way that &gt; there is minimum pause
        (_not_ to control edge orientation) &gt; - avoiding 4 wrong LL edges
        when fixing the fourth slot (but only &gt; when it flows nicely from the
        rest of the F2L) &gt; - the nicer patterns from COLL when all LL edges
        are correct (if it's &gt; not a nice COLL, I just use the normal OLL
        pattern but still know &gt; what corner permutation it's going to end up
        with.) &gt; - PLL recognition by blocks of same colors; AUF at end or
        beginning, &gt; never both &gt; - slamming down the cube pretty quickly
        ;) &gt; &gt; I know several algorithms for each F2L, but I haven't
        actually sit &gt; down and memorized their effects on edge orientation.
        &gt; &gt; Like Ron (read the comments on his new record!), I'm doubting
        the &gt; theoretical benefits of ZB. The number of moves in ZB is very
        &gt; appealing, but I find that F2L is much faster without it. Of
        course, &gt; maybe it'll all be very smooth once you master ZBF2L. &gt;
        &gt; I used a new 25th anniversary cube (best of the 20 purchased) to
        set &gt; the new average. The cube is pretty lubed right now...I thought
        until &gt; now that stiff (but soft) cubes work better for me (because
        I'm not &gt; very fast at LL), but this cube is very nice. It is true
        that I used &gt; a Deluxe at one point. It was with a Deluxe that I came
        very near to &gt; the 15 sec barrier. The only reason I haven't touched
        it recently is &gt; because it's not tuned, and that takes longer than
        buying new cubes. &gt; I have to thank David for the Deluxe, of course.
        I plan to work much &gt; more with it once it's adjusted. =) &gt; &gt; I
        don't think that I will ever work too much with the 5-by. I'm &gt;
        finding it much harder to pair up the edges for this size than it is
        &gt; for the 4-by. I've never even had a sub-3 min solve! &gt; &gt;

        it wasn't as difficult of a puzzle as I had previously thought :) I

        understand (either from your account or from &gt; Stefan's page) is how
        you associate orientations (3 possibiities) with &gt; your 2-colour
        object mnemonics for the corners. How does that work? Do &gt; you have
        three objects to choose from for each corner, for example? I actually
        had to ask him about that, too. You only have to remember the first two
        colors, going clockwise. For example, if you look at a solved cube and
        hold yellow on top, right in front, then the URF cubie is (with my color
        scheme) YGR. Note that there are no other corners that have green next
        to yellow in the clockwise direction. Thus, you can identify it instead
        just by yellow green (what I would memorize as Sprite :-D). It takes a
        little bit of extra thinking at first, but it is easy to check by
        visualizing where that piece goes. Does this clear things up? ~ Bob

        Ryan Patricio and I decided to meet at lunch this week to practice some
        cubing together before the Caltech tourney...I figured I might be able
        to compete with him if I use two hands versus his one hand. Well...
        Yesterday, we had a mini-competition...5 cubes, computer scrambles on
        the Stackmat...15 seconds pre-inspection, etc...Ryan did 32.93, 31.35,
        27.35, 30.06, 35.10...one handed. I choked ;-) best of 29.10 for me.
        Today, Ryan came in and started doing 29's, scrambling for himself. I
        decided to quit being lazy and "officiate him" on another set of five
        computer scrambles...His times: 25.02, 28.48, 32.39, 24.24, 28.74
        average of 5, throwing out high and low: 27.41 He then did two more
        cubes, which was all he could get in before the bell to his next
        class... 32.73, 30.37 The average for the 12 "official" solves over the
        last two days: 29.942...it can't really count for anything...but each
        solve is amazing to me. None of the solves were officially lucky, but he
        said the 24 and 25's were easy cases for him...I didn't save all of the
        scrambles, but I did write down the scramble for the 24.24, and gave it
        to him. His dexterity and finger speed is incredible. My hope for myself
        is to be more competitive with him, with two hands (versus his one
        hand). Oh, he also did some 16's and 18's two handed... ;-) Bill

        As near as I can tell, it's partly to do with people 'cramming' for the

        Hey Mike, I think you should learn the 1 look corners and other special
        cases for your method if you are interested. It sucks to spend so much
        time learning and not taking averages, but the payoff later is so nice.
        I'm starting to be of the opinion that the more algs you know for the
        last, non-intuitive, steps of your method the better off you are. Look
        at all the sub-15 cubers - they all know tons of algs and/or useful
        tricks and can do all kinds of cool special case solves at the end.
        Also, I'm sorry to get on my soapbox but everyone seems to seriously
        doubt ZB lately. I definitely do not, and the averages I've been doing
        lately are definitely making me think ZB will be a useful speedcubing
        system. I had to _really_ work with Fridrich to get sub-18, and to get
        sub-18 with ZBF2L I only had to get my first average where I only screw
        up once (since the slowest is eliminated). I can't wait till I know all
        these algs really well and have moved them to my subconcious. I don't
        know if ZB will ever be sub-15 or anything crazy like that, but I think
        I can beat my own personal best Fridrich average using ZBF2L and that at
        least is motivation enough for me to keep learning it. But Mike, I
        definitely think that you should learn the special case algs for your
        method. I guarantee that you won't regret it. Chris --- In

        Re: Sub-18 with ZBF2L!!!!!! Hey Mike, I think you should learn the 1
        look corners and other special cases for your method if you are
        interested. It sucks to spend so much time learning and not taking
        averages, but the payoff later is so nice. I'm starting to be of the
        opinion that the more algs you know for the last, non-intuitive, steps
        of your method the better off you are. Look at all the sub-15 cubers -
        they all know tons of algs and/or useful tricks and can do all kinds of
        cool special case solves at the end. Also, I'm sorry to get on my
        soapbox but everyone seems to seriously doubt ZB lately. I definitely do
        not, and the averages I've been doing lately are definitely making me
        think ZB will be a useful speedcubing system. I had to _really_ work
        with Fridrich to get sub-18, and to get sub-18 with ZBF2L I only had to
        get my first average where I only screw up once (since the slowest is
        eliminated). I can't wait till I know all these algs really well and
        have moved them to my subconcious. I don't know if ZB will ever be
        sub-15 or anything crazy like that, but I think I can beat my own
        personal best Fridrich average using ZBF2L and that at least is
        motivation enough for me to keep learning it. But Mike, I definitely
        think that you should learn the special case algs for your method. I
        guarantee that you won't regret it. Chris [Non-text portions of this

        &gt; And yes i agree with u that a "simple" method can be just as fast

        for &gt; 700 algs it won't help u much if u need 1 sec to recognize a

        What is the difference between the 25th anniversary cube and the diy-

        center caps from 25th anniversary cubes, so you can't tune them. They
        have arched centers, bad stickers, very noticeable imperfections of
        plastic on the legs of corners.... Quality varies from as bad as Chris
        recently described to as amazing as my new cube. A lot of them have a
        bump on the core that makes one layer click with every 90 degree
        rotation...I can't tell you about DIY because I don't have one, but I've
        tried a few, and they can be pretty amazing. DIY&gt;25th. In my opinion,
        the main problem with normal cubes is that you have to buy a few before
        you can get a good one. Studios are all very nice, but not any nicer
        than the best Oddzon cube. You can call me whatever you want to as long
        as I know who you're talking about. =) Macky

        Hey! I have run the HOS of the Cube Explorer. I have "only" 1 GB of RAM
        so that was obviously enough for me. Im sure it helps to close down all
        other applications before running it. Internet Explorer or Microsoft
        Office could steal 100's of MB of RAM without u noticing that anything
        is slow. So when u run the HOS it's better to close all other apps on ur
        computer. As for the algorithm it's of course just the same 2-phase
        algorithm, but with a much larger pruning table. That's indeed why u
        need so much RAM, to have the table loaded in memory ;-) And also the
        sourcecode for the Cube Explorer is freely available. Im not sure if u
        are allowed to modify it in any way. And it could also be that u have
        quite a task at hand installing external packages into the Delphi IDE.
        Cause i haven't tried it out yet ... Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        &gt; &gt; Depends on the puzzle and the algorithm. Without that info,
        it's &gt; &gt; impossible to answer. &gt; &gt; (Will also depend on your
        operating system.) &gt; &gt; But Stefan, the puzzle is the 3x3x3 -- this
        is the Huge Optimal &gt; Solver in the later versions of Cube Explorer,
        so we know pretty &gt; accurately what the algorithm is, too. My own
        experience of various &gt; puzzle programs that push the limits of
        available memory is that the &gt; amount needed at startup can be 50%
        greater (or even worse) than what &gt; it settles down to later. &gt;
        &gt; Sorry, GameOfDeath, but I have only 512MB on this machine, so
        haven't &gt; been able to try H.O.S. myself, but would like to -- surely
        someone &gt; here has used it? &gt; &gt; Mike

        I still turn in all the really big assignments ;-) In all seriousness

        speedcubing, but I try to keep a good balance of coursework and cubing

        I cube a lot to make up for my lighter &gt; &gt; practicing days. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; So I'm balanced I guess. Plus Caltech _is_ a better

        homework load isn't as much or &gt; as &gt; &gt; difficult as yours. :-)

        Hi, all! I recently had a look in this group and though I do no
        speedcubing I saw that there are quite a few questions concerning my
        progam. So I joined this group now. Concerning the huge optimal solver:
        1. You should definitely have 1 GB of RAM to run it. It will not run
        with 512 MB because the big table alone needs about 800 MB. 2. You
        should use a fresh rebooted system to run it then because Windows tends
        to steal much memory for other purposes (file buffering etc. ...). 3. It
        does not use the 2-phase algorithm because it is an *optimal* solver. 4.
        I removed the source code of the last versions from my homepage because
        it tends to become more and more ugly with all this additional stuff
        about web-cam, symmetry editor etc., but I will send the source code of
        version 2.25 which contains the essential algorithms to everyone who is
        interested in it. 5. My provider t-online will shut down his old server,
        so the old link to my homepage will become invalid within the next two
        months. Please update your link to

        before running it. Internet Explorer or &gt; Microsoft Office could
        steal 100's of MB of RAM without u noticing &gt; that anything is slow.
        So when u run the HOS it's better to close &gt; all other apps on ur
        computer. As for the algorithm it's of course &gt; just the same 2-phase
        algorithm, but with a much larger pruning &gt; table. That's indeed why
        u need so much RAM, to have the table &gt; loaded in memory ;-) And also
        the sourcecode for the Cube Explorer &gt; is freely available. Im not
        sure if u are allowed to modify it in &gt; any way. And it could also be
        that u have quite a task at hand &gt; installing external packages into
        the Delphi IDE. Cause i haven't &gt; tried it out yet ... &gt;

        corners (usually ULF and ULB), then with a second look recognize the PLL
        fully. Now I've drawn pictures of all the PLLs and their blocks and from
        some first experiences with it I must say I like it a lot. One question,
        though: Do you really define blocks that strictly? For example, consider
        case n3 and n9. According to your definition, they're equivalent. Both
        only have a triple-block of a corner and its two adjacent edges. But n3
        has another "non-adjacent block", two corners which share the same color
        on one side but the edge between them has a different color. But they're
        still easy to identify as a "non-adjacent block". Do you use this or do
        you differentiate them a different way? I think I've heard of the
        block-approach before, but never thought about it much. What recognition
        methods do the other top (PLL) cubers use? And a question for top F2L
        cross on bottom cubers: When you for example do (R U' R' U R U' R'), do
        you prefer using right thumb to push or using left index finger to pull
        the U'? I noticed I've been using the thumb but the index finger seems
        to do a much better job. Cheers! Stefan

        the need for any AUF" This sounds like you have to do AUF for the block

        &gt; I think I've heard of the block-approach before, but never thought

        tricks for recognising the PLL cases. But I saw Macky's 'block'
        approach, and I must say it looks quite like what I have always been
        doing. I just look at what pieces have the same colours on the same
        side... But I can also recognize some cases without seeing a block, just
        because I have seen it 100s of times :D. Btw, I am looking forward to
        see you again, Stefan ;), bye!! Joël. P.S.: What does AUF mean? All I
        can guess is 'Align U layer First'... Is that what it means? &gt; And a
        question for top F2L cross on bottom cubers: When you for &gt; example
        do (R U' R' U R U' R'), do you prefer using right thumb to &gt; push or

        by blocks of same colors; AUF at end or beginning, &gt; &gt; never both
        &gt; &gt; I've started using this now, too. So far I've always done AUF
        first to &gt; solve two corners (usually ULF and ULB), then with a
        second look &gt; recognize the PLL fully. Now I've drawn pictures of all
        the PLLs and &gt; their blocks and from some first experiences with it I
        must say I like &gt; it a lot. &gt; &gt; One question, though: Do you
        really define blocks that strictly? For &gt; example, consider case n3
        and n9. According to your definition, &gt; they're equivalent. Both only
        have a triple-block of a corner and its &gt; two adjacent edges. But n3
        has another "non-adjacent block", two &gt; corners which share the same
        color on one side but the edge between &gt; them has a different color.
        But they're still easy to identify as a &gt; "non-adjacent block". Do
        you use this or do you differentiate them a &gt; different way? &gt;
        &gt; I think I've heard of the block-approach before, but never thought
        &gt; about it much. What recognition methods do the other top (PLL)
        cubers &gt; use? &gt; &gt; And a question for top F2L cross on bottom
        cubers: When you for &gt; example do (R U' R' U R U' R'), do you prefer
        using right thumb to &gt; push or using left index finger to pull the
        U'? I noticed I've been &gt; using the thumb but the index finger seems
        to do a much better job. &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan

        have no problem devoting my massive ram to something &gt; of the sort,
        let me know if i can help in anyway, &gt; maybe we can team up on the
        project, or at least lemme &gt; know where i can get a copy, if its
        available The program is CubeExplorer by Herbert Kociemba. The project
        is a multi-stage project, it's the advanced blindfold method -
        "Blindfold Cubing For Seriously Sad Savants", a sequel to the
        intermediate method "Blindfold Cubing For The Seriously Sad", which is a
        follow up to the basic method which is available on the web. The
        intermediate method is probably more advanced than most people would
        care to try to learn, although it is possible to get useful sub-methods
        from it. The advanced method is part of a bigger project, but I need to
        get that finished first. The current stage of the project is the
        optimization of the orientation algorithms (in HTM - I may be mistaken
        but I think Cube Explorer doesn't optimize in QTM). I was able to obtain
        some time ago that this subgroup has diameter 20 (that is, that 20 moves
        is always sufficient and that 20 moves is sometimes necessary (the
        necessity was already well-known as witnessed by the superflip)).
        Originally, of the 94.518 isomorphism classes in the orientation group,
        I didn't have better than 20 move algorithms for over 90,000 of them
        (that's partly because I stopped optimizing and went on to get the
        diameter first). Now I am reducing that number. Currently it is a little
        under 2,400 (plus 11 which are definitely optimal at 20) and I've got
        about several of those running on Cube Explorer now to try to shorten
        their paths to less than 20 before optimizing - clearly if the optimum
        is say 19 moves then reducing 20 to 19 and then optimizing means that
        one would only have to search through 18 (but not wade for ages through
        19). Of course, some are quite probably going to take 20 moves and
        therefore will not be reduced by this method. Then I will have to
        optimize them (most likely by checking that all the (isomorphim classes
        of) neighbours need at least 19 moves - this is equivalent but can be
        done in stages and therefore takes less resources)). &gt; &gt; intel mb

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recently had a look in this group and
        though I &gt; &gt; do no speedcubing I &gt; &gt; &gt; saw that there are
        quite a few questions &gt; &gt; concerning my progam. So I &gt; &gt;
        &gt; joined this group now. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Concerning the
        huge optimal solver: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. You should
        definitely have 1 GB of RAM to run &gt; &gt; it. It will not run &gt;
        &gt; &gt; with 512 MB because the big table alone needs &gt; &gt; about
        800 MB. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks - I was wondering if I bought a
        Windows &gt; &gt; machine whether I &gt; &gt; should get one with 2GB
        but I guess that won't be &gt; &gt; necessary. Optimal &gt; &gt; is good
        - I have lots of potential 20 move positions &gt; &gt; to try to
        optimize. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 2. You should use a fresh rebooted system to run &gt; &gt; it then
        because &gt; &gt; &gt; Windows tends to steal much memory for other &gt;
        &gt; purposes (file buffering &gt; &gt; &gt; etc. ...). &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. It does not use the 2-phase algorithm because &gt;
        &gt; it is an *optimal* &gt; &gt; &gt; solver. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 4. I removed the source code of the last versions &gt; &gt; from my
        homepage &gt; &gt; &gt; because it tends to become more and more ugly
        with &gt; &gt; all this &gt; &gt; &gt; additional stuff about web-cam,
        symmetry editor &gt; &gt; etc., but I will send &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        source code of version 2.25 which contains the &gt; &gt; essential &gt;
        &gt; &gt; algorithms to everyone who is interested in it. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. My provider t-online will shut down his old &gt; &gt;
        server, so the old &gt; &gt; &gt; link to my homepage will become
        invalid within the &gt; &gt; next two months. &gt; &gt; &gt; Please
        update your link to &gt; &gt; &gt;

        that was obviously enough for me. Im sure it &gt; &gt; helps to close

        &gt; Internet Explorer or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Microsoft Office could

        &gt; that anything is slow. So when u run the HOS &gt; &gt; it's better
        to close &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all other apps on ur computer. As for the
        &gt; &gt; algorithm it's of course &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just the same
        2-phase algorithm, but with a much &gt; &gt; larger pruning &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; table. That's indeed why u need so much RAM, to &gt; &gt; have

        Hi Stefan, &gt;One question, though: Do you really define blocks that
        strictly? For &gt;example, consider case n3 and n9. According to your
        definition, &gt;they're equivalent. Both only have a triple-block of a
        corner and its &gt;two adjacent edges. But n3 has another "non-adjacent
        block", two &gt;corners which share the same color on one side but the
        edge between &gt;them has a different color. But they're still easy to
        identify as a &gt;"non-adjacent block". Do you use this or do you
        differentiate them a &gt;different way? Good point. I differentiate
        those two by looking at whether the corner opposite the triple-block is
        permuted correctly (or rather, whether those two corners share a same
        color). I like your definition of "non-adjacent block"...that's
        essentially what I use to decide which of the 4 G permutations I have.
        For now, I'm going to be lazy and place a link on my page to this
        discussion. &gt;Oh, and one more question for Macky: You say &gt; &gt;-
        "in PLL you need to AUF before you can see which pieces need to be
        &gt;permuted" &gt;- about even "better" methods: "eliminating the need
        for any AUF" &gt; &gt;This sounds like you have to do AUF for the block
        recognition &gt;approach, which I think is exactly wrong. Can you
        clarify this? Right, my fault. What I should have said was that there's
        never a need to look behind the cube...but I'm not sure that having to
        do this with the block approach makes you any slower. I find it much
        more intuitive and easier, anyways. (By the way, do we have different
        definitions for AUF? I thought that both methods have AUF, either before
        or after the permutation algorithm itself.) &gt;And a question for top
        F2L cross on bottom cubers: When you for &gt;example do (R U' R' U R U'
        R'), do you prefer using right thumb to &gt;push or using left index
        finger to pull the U'? I noticed I've been &gt;using the thumb but the
        index finger seems to do a much better job. &gt; &gt;Cheers! &gt;Stefan
        Index works much better for me as well! Macky

        Hi everyone! The results for the 3-colour Fewest Moves Challenge are now
        available on my website - www.cubestation.co.uk - and are definitely
        worth a look! This week we will have a normal challenge, and I would
        like to get as many people involved in Fewest Moves Solving as possible.
        It's becoming a very popular solving exercise, maybe one day people will
        be as enthusiastic about it as speedcubing! Maybe. There are lots of
        experts now, who I am sure would be willing to help out and answer any
        questions, and you can definitely learn from them by browsing their
        solutions to previous week's scrambles using the FMC archive. There is a
        lot of skill, lots of techniques, and a bit of luck involved in creating
        a winning solution, and it's a great puzzling exercise for the mind! I
        hope you will all decide to try it out this week, and if so, Best Of
        Luck! Dan Harris - www.cubestation.co.uk [Non-text portions of this

        Heh heh, I also have picked up pen spinning, but only to a very minor
        extent probably compared to you guys. I can do the forward and reverse
        thumb spin on both left and right hands, and I'm working on twirling the
        pen through all 4 fingers (Kam does it briefly in his video, I guess
        it's the most basic manipulation). I can keep up the illusion of
        constant flow for a few seconds sometimes, but most of the time as I
        transfer from my pinky finger to the index again I have a quick jerk in
        the pen's motion which doesn't look so cool :( One of the guys in my
        cube club in high school was an extremely good pen spinner. He wasn't as
        good as Kam, but watching him do a lot of the tricks he did did look
        kinda like Kam's videos. I think he's been pen spinning for about 4
        years, so he's had a lot of practice though. Chris --- In

        Thanks for the clarifications... Hmm, don't know about you but for me
        "AUF" just means "adjust U face" (or layer) in a very general way and
        sometimes I do it twice before PLL. Until now after OLL I did this: 1)
        Find two "non-adjacent" but "connected" corners (if any) 2) AUF so that
        these two corners are solved (or so that two diagonally opposite corners
        are solved) and rotate the cube so that these two corners are on the
        left side. 3) Recognize PLL case 4) Sometimes: AUF again (in case of
        corner 3-cycle) 5) Rotate the cube 6) Apply PLL algorithm Wow, now that
        I write it down this detailed, it looks like a terribly long list. Let's
        see what I hope it'll look like with the block approach: 1) Find the
        blocks, in other words: recognize the PLL case 2) AUF and rotate the
        cube 3) Apply the PLL algorithm Stefan

        Hi Everyone, If you would like to keep track of any new records or
        amazing times at the tournament tomorrow, sign-in and join the chatroom
        on the Caltech Rubik's yahoo groups here:
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/caltechrubiks/ If there is wireless
        in the lounge, and there probably will be, I will sign on and report any
        news as it happens. I will be logged on from 10 AM PDT to the
        tournament's end. I will also occasionally update the results file on my
        webspace so stay tuned in the chat for information about that. Tyson Mao

        A cube sighting in today's (16th April) New Scientist. Check out the
        picture in the article on superatoms (pp30-33). For those in the UK sad
        enough to have seen the new Ask the Family series I noticed a cube
        flying past in the opening sequences too! Duncan

        Actually, I should apologize. I've decided that I shouldn't be bringing
        this up in the community and that I only sent that e-mail because I was
        really mad. There's no reason for me to bring it up because it will be
        brought up and when the time comes, and when it is, I won't have to do
        anything. I'm not being arrogant. I'm just confident that I've been an
        honest person and people will respect that when the time comes. I'm
        confident that I don't lie to everyone and that I don't misrepresent my
        abilities. The time will come. I'm sure word of what happened today will
        spread but I've also decided that it's better for me to let this just

        Hello! When I started learning when to use which alg (I´m talking about
        Petrus also) I first started to learn the Complete Step 6+7 index. The
        way I did it was to look for "color-pairs" (if a edge and a corner share
        the same color on one face (not U-face) they are a color-pair). Then I
        made a table with all the 8 different configurations. I divided the
        different cases by the number of color-pairs and learned which alg
        belongs to which case. This way I made block so small I could learn all
        the cases in one block in on sitting. Some configurations were easy to
        learn because of symmetry and few cases where as other took lots of
        time. After that I started with the Complete Step 5+6 index. At this
        point I used most of the algs in the index. I only had to learn a few
        new ones and it is quite easy to reconize which alg to use where when
        you know which corners it flips. I definetly think I did it in the wrong
        order. I should have started with the Step 5+6 index because that way I
        can avoid getting in most positions in the other index. I still know
        most of Step 6+7 index so If I can skip Step 5 I still know what alg to
        choose. I´m sure there are way better ways of learning these things but
        this was how I did it. Hope it helps, Mikael &gt; Any tips on memorizing
        when to use the algorithms? &gt; &gt; For the method I use (Petrus)
        there are 12 cases for each &gt; configuration. What's the best way to
        learn when to use what algorithm?

        There is a poll on Rubiks.com and it is as follows: The 2005 Rubik's
        World Championships will be held in November. Will the current 20 second

        Hey everyone, I'm still experimenting with new methods and here are some
        tips I put on my page of things that have helped me to improve. I know
        some people do intuitive stuff to flip edges while doing the last c/e
        pair, and I know some people are learning a handful of the algs as well.
        I tried to write these tips for both groups, but of course I can relate
        more to the learning algs aspect of it. Anyway, in case anyone is
        interested here are some of my thoughts on the method.

        The normal 25th Anniversary cubes vary a lot in quality. Macky bought 20
        from me and found the best ones and seriously, you could get like, your
        normal averages, maybe +1 second on these cubes. Then you put some lube
        in and you're just fine. Some of the most amazing cubes I've seen in the
        last few weeks have been straight out of the box 25th Anniversary cubes.
        The 25th Anniversary cubes in my opinion are just fine. It is of my
        opinion that cubes may all start off at different places, but a bad cube
        can be worked in to become good. Of course, not many of us are willing
        to wait that long. Just don't be the guy that says that you are too good
        for any speedcube because your fingers and arms are too strong so you
        pop everything. I met him yesterday. It was fun. I'm sorry, I don't take
        things very well. You'll probably notice my small or not so small jabs

        Hey Everyone, As you may know, Will Arnold absolutely shattered the
        foot-cubing record at the tournament last Saturday. I met Will and he's
        actually very new to speed cubing and the method he uses right now is
        very elementary and inefficient. I was hoping the community would help
        him come up with a method that would allow him to solve faster and of
        course, we'd have to optimize it for his feet. What do the current
        foot-cubers use? I think it would be interesting to compare your methods
        and his and actually more specifically, your technique. This was the
        first time I've seen foot-cubing so I have no idea what the different
        styles are. However, I am lead to believe that the other foot-cubers out
        there do daily life activities such as opening and closing doors with
        their hands instead so they do not practice their toe dexterity on a
        day-to-day basis. What I'm saying is, Will right now can make about 1
        turn per second meaning if he knew Fridrich like I knew it, he would get
        sub-60 solves all the time. With our help and maybe some ingenious toe
        tricks, Maybe we can see some sub-40s? Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        I'm still fuming a little bit of last Saturday but I think I've calmed
        down to the point of sanity now. Basically, I had a run-in with a guy
        who claimed that he didn't use any method to solve the cube and that he
        could solve the cube intuitively in under 20 seconds. Later, he claimed
        that it was almost time to reveal his ultra-secret and amazing method.
        The whole thing about this guy is that he comes to my tournament from a
        very far place, doesn't compete, and then proceeds to insult everyone,
        not just me, not just the tournament, but people in practically every
        country, including Mr. Ernö Rubik himself, and then... doesn't compete
        and his excuse is that no cube is good enough for him because his arms
        and fingers are so strong that he pops everything. If you say you can
        solve a cube in under 20 seconds, show me. Get up on that stage with the
        timer, and solve for us. It's that simple. Solve it in under 25 and I'll
        believe you. Seriously... and saying that Mr. Rubik is lazy because he
        doesn't go to the tournaments? Doesn't he have cancer or something? I'd
        challenge him to crush my fingers with a handshake grip. I'd be willing
        to wager my fingers... and I was a musician before I even learned to
        cube. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On Apr 18,

        Intuition - wish I knew what it was. Here is a Cambridge Dictionary
        defnition "the feeling that you know something without being able to
        explain why". With most sophisticated things when people say it is
        "intuitively obvious" they have either worked on similar things so long
        that, by analogy, they are confident that know how to do them (and could
        almost certainly explain why), or they are wrong (which is why they
        can't explain why). I don't think speedcubing fits this definition
        anyway! I remember at University that I struggled for months to
        understand some things that I would blythely say were inutitively
        obvious 2 years later! Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From:

        Cubing is starting to gain a real measure of popularity, and it is
        spreading. As with any hobby, (especially with one as intellectual as
        ours), we are going to have to do deal with critics and phonies. So far
        in the cubing community, most of the people here are nice, and well
        mannered, but the larger we grow, and the more people we encompass, the
        more likely it is that people will not necessarily all be as respectful.
        This guy, sounds like a phony to me, somebody who showed up, did a
        little research on cubing, so that he knows what he is talking about,
        but is just talking. I don't know who it is, and I'm not exactly sure
        what happened, but this is just my impression. In my experience, most of
        the people that I've talked to in the cubing community have been helpful
        and responsive. I think that is something that we should emphasize,
        maybe as core values of being a cuber. I think that for us, being a
        cuber, sure it's about being fast, but there is also a sub-culture of
        support for everyone else here. I'd like to see that continue. Don't let
        this one person taint all the good things we have going on, and all the
        growth and potential that we have in our sport. To me, this sounds like
        a phony. One of the better measures of strength and integrity, is doing
        something while having restraint. You know like all the movies where the
        bad guy just goes around killing people, but the good guy could kill
        people, but chooses not to, even though it is a more difficult choice. I
        know that doesn't really directly apply, but whatever. A good speedcube
        helps, but most of the fastest solving is because of the brain being
        ahead of the hands. You could still try to solve it. He could have
        gotten a mid-20 or something, and then blame it on the cube...and if
        that was the case, why didn't he bring his own? I'm not convinced this
        was the case, but there was a kid at high school that I went to, and he
        was a chronic liar. He lied about everything, telling people that he was
        going to a really great college, and doing great things. The only person
        he was hurting, was himself. Best of luck to everyone, (hoping to see
        some of you at the new york tournament with Ian). Happy Cubing, Joe

        Probably. It involves putting up a cross on the yellow face by putting
        each edge to its corresponding center instead of putting all 4 in the
        right place in relation to each other and then connecting them all. Then
        it's first layer corners, middle layer edges. After that, it's position
        last layer corners, orient last layer corners, then use M' D M D2 M' D M
        to try and position all the edges and then some really long algorithm to
        fix whatever two edges are flipped. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        Well, also a lot of pauses. Let me try myself... Yeah, 240 moves does
        seem like quite a bit. I guess between 120-130 is more reasonable. I
        think the time is lost due to searching for pieces like when you switch
        corners, I've definitely got to search for about 3 or 4 seconds at
        least. (Which is why I stopped using Petrus.) Tyson Mao MSC #631

        if you want, you can get a solution in 246 moves and more. But I

        trying really hard ;) Sebastian PS. The number of my classmates who can
        now solve the cube is 10. One of them, when he was a beginner, used to
        need around 5 Sunes in order to solve the corners. So it's not
        impossible to need many moves, if you're a beginner.

        Until recently, I used a solution that is VERY similar to the one Tyson
        described. In my first couple months of cubing, I would average around
        100-110 moves. Though, I believe what I did was probably slightly more
        efficient, so 120-130 moves sounds reasonable here. ~ Bob --- In

        Jessica estimated the limit somewhere around 10-12 seconds.. But I don't

        need more than two Sunes and it's probably the easiest and most
        well-known alg for this. &gt; &gt; &gt; then use M' D M D2 M' D M to try
        and position all the edges &gt; &gt; ==&gt; 22 moves &gt; &gt; used say
        3 or 4 times, once for each edge. No, I already applied it twice. And I
        did count slice moves as two moves. And you never need do it more than
        twice. &gt; So if you want, you can get a solution in 246 moves and
        more. But I &gt; wouldn't expect you Stefan to be able to get such a
        solution without &gt; trying really hard ;) Yes, I would've had to try
        *even harder* than I *already did*. Notice I only used a very small set
        of algs, didn't look ahead (e.g. planning two edges of the cross at the
        same time and other sophisticated stuff like that ;-). And there were
        damn *two* middle-layer edges correctly placed but flipped which I
        solved very naively which is why I used 45 (!) moves for those four
        middle layer edges alone (I think that can be called a very unlucky
        case??). Had I just tried to follow the steps but used the
        algs/techniques I know, then it would've been far less moves of course.
        Actually I feel insulted now that you think I can't do better than that!
        Just kidding ;-) Cheers! Stefan

        he doesn't average 1 move per second for the whole solve. Neither do I
        average 8 moves per second though I can do that with two or three PLL
        algs. One is the T-perm and the other two are 3-edge-cycles. Using
        solely these for PLL I think solves 62.5% of the PLLs in at most 2
        looks. That was my PLL method a while ago (btw, today I learned the
        remaining two PLLs :-). So I was turning the PLL very fast most of the
        time. But now that I use more algorithms it's not only harder to
        recognize but also harder to execute fast. I guess Will uses only very
        few algs and he has practiced them a lot and they're probably
        well-suited for it (e.g. mostly twisting &lt;U,F,R&gt; maybe). So I
        don't think it will scale as nicely as Tyson suggested first. Cheers!

        easily do 1 move/second. However, there are delay times due to looking

        What about an F2L approach with cross on back during F2L? This would
        allow for the pairs to be solved into DR and DL, using mainly {D,R} or
        {D,L} moves. The cube could be rotated with z turns to move empty slots
        into DR or DL. Also {U,R} {U,L} turns might also be fairly fast for foot
        cubing. There is also the option of doing cross on left, which would
        also use a lot of {D,R} turns. The LL could be done with F2L on the B
        and LL as the F face. This would make for lots of z (seems like it may
        be fast) and {U,R,L,D} turns for the alg. Also, some algs could be
        recognized with LL as F and then rotate the cube so that LL will be on D
        and the alg will then have lots of D moves, plus recognitition won't be
        a factor since PLL is the last step. Just trying to throw out some
        ideas. I guess if cube rotations in the x direction aren't too hard then

        This thread actually inspired me to write a bit about how I recognize
        the PLL cases. I wrote a couple short paragraphs on my PLL page
        (www.cubewhiz.com and click "permutations") describing EXACTLY how I

        algorithm itself.) &gt; &gt; Thanks for the clarifications... &gt; &gt;
        Hmm, don't know about you but for me "AUF" just means "adjust U face"
        &gt; (or layer) in a very general way and sometimes I do it twice before
        &gt; PLL. Until now after OLL I did this: &gt; &gt; 1) Find two
        "non-adjacent" but "connected" corners (if any) &gt; 2) AUF so that
        these two corners are solved (or so that two diagonally &gt; opposite
        corners are solved) and rotate the cube so that these two &gt; corners
        are on the left side. &gt; 3) Recognize PLL case &gt; 4) Sometimes: AUF
        again (in case of corner 3-cycle) &gt; 5) Rotate the cube &gt; 6) Apply
        PLL algorithm &gt; &gt; Wow, now that I write it down this detailed, it
        looks like a terribly &gt; long list. Let's see what I hope it'll look
        like with the block &gt; approach: &gt; &gt; 1) Find the blocks, in
        other words: recognize the PLL case &gt; 2) AUF and rotate the cube &gt;
        3) Apply the PLL algorithm &gt; &gt; Stefan

        I hope somebody can find &gt; this helpful. Mmh, I'm a bit confused. In
        the introduction you seem to say you recognize the case by always just
        looking at two adjacent sides. But the detailed descriptions seem to
        disagree. For example "Corners Only" starts with "In these cases, I
        first AUF until the edges are already permuted." and then describes how
        you recognize the case after that AUF. Question: How do you recognize
        that the edges are permuted correctly relative to each other? And after
        the AUF, haven't you looked at at least three sides now? Cheers! Stefan

        Hey everyone, I had a really interesting pop today. I was solving at my
        computer and had a pop, a 3x1 group (2 corners and an edge) came out. I
        was able to find two of the pieces pretty quickly, but I could have
        sworn the other had disappeared in some quantum tunneling vortex or
        something. After about 10 minutes I gave up and just surfed the internet
        for about an hour before class, which by the way is a great way to spend
        time when you should be doing homework ;-) When it was time to go to
        class I grabbed my bag, one of those shoulder strap computer bags, and
        felt a weird lump where the strap was as I put it on. I figured the
        shoulder strap was twisted, but it turns out that the other popped piece
        had landed in my shirt pocket, *AND* had been there for the entire hour
        I was at my computer without my noticing! I feel kinda slow lol, but I
        thought it was somewhat interesting :) Chris

        I know I keep saying this, but eventually I want to add my 4x4 speed
        solution on my site. The solution on my site I consider to be
        beginner/intermediate. I was able to get to about 1:50-1:55 on average
        with that method. The only changes for speed solving are: 1) Solve two
        opposite centers 2) solve two adjacent centers 3) finish the last two 4)
        Solve the edges using one of the more common pair up methods (either 2,
        4, or 6). 5) Solve as a 3x3 The only changes are that the second and
        third pairs of centers are solved as adjacent pairs. Also solving the
        edges is much more structured as I mention on my site, so that you don't
        have to spend any time looking ahead. Chris --- In

        I've finally resigned to learn the 1 step LL corner algorithms for the
        Roux method, in pursuit of the elusive sub 20. I've dabbled with some of
        the PLL algs and somewhat understand the theory behind recognization.
        Unfortunately, with this method, there are no blocks, no helpful side
        pieces, or anything I've been able to figure out in order to identify
        cases quickly. It's making the learning process incredibly slow and
        difficult for me. There are only a small few I've learned I can see
        quickly enough to execute and achieve decent times with, and most of
        those are when either the corners are either oriented or permuted
        correctly. Any advice anyone could offer would be most appreciated. I
        have a lot of time to spend in a hospital waiting over the next week
        with my trusty page of cube notes to pour over. Thanks in advance. -Mike
        Bennett P.S. If anyone has any advice about recognizing special cases
        for Step 4, that would most certainly not go unwelcome. [Non-text

        I've recently had a similar experience, though not caused by a pop. I
        was preparing a 2cm 3x3 cube for speedsolving and its center caps are
        smaller than the stickers above them so I had to peel those stickers
        off. I've had missing parts maybe 4 or 5 times. Stupid me was working on
        the floor (grey carpet), imagine searching for a spring that's maybe
        2-3mm long. At one point the orange sticker was missing. I was looking
        for it everywhere. All around me. Even on myself, especially I remember
        rolling out the left sleeve of my sweater because I had a feeling it
        could be there. I even took out a few keys of my notebook keyboard
        because I thought the stickers might have gotten under them. Nothing.
        Nowhere. I found it later on the *right* sleeve of the sweater. Argh.
        Cheers! Stefan P.S. The cube turned out great, got a 35s average-of-10

        So i was streching the springs on my new cube when i saw that one of the

        loosen the rivets without ruining my new cube? Also, more importantly,
        whats an easy way to make the center cap stay on?

        Yea it is, but it affects edges permutations. I should have been more

        1) F2l except one c/e pair (7+7*3=28) 2) insert edge/solve edges (the

        Hey everyone, I am under the impression that at least some people find
        this info about the ZB method interesting. If that isn't the case, let
        me know and I'll stop posting. ----------------------- I just did a 100
        cube average, only instead of times I was counting the number of moves.
        I took note of when I got a ZBLL solve, and when I had a COLL/PLL solve.
        I also counted the average number of moves for ZBF2L, as well as the LL
        given whichever type of solve it was. Here were the total counts:
        Average number of moves for ZBF2L: 33.37 Average number of moves for
        COLL/PLL finish: 21.29 (54.66 if combined with ZBF2L) Average number of
        moves for ZBLL finish: 12.19 (45.66 if combined with ZBF2L) Average
        number of moves with my hybrid (VH + 10% ZBLL) system: 53.84 I had 9
        ZBLL solves, 4 of which were unintentional PLL skips after COLL.
        Interesting to notice, is that the ZBLL solves took on average 45.56
        moves total. So it seems that ZB might have a move average of 45. I
        personally still think the benefits of ZB are good, despite the move
        count being a bit higher. I think the move count is higher because I
        don't think an average of 18 moves for the ZBF2L is reasonable while
        speedsolving (perhaps while fewest moves solving). Out of all 100 solves
        my shortest ZBF2L solve was 26 moves, which I only was able to do 3
        times. So anyway, I still think ZB is a worthwhile system, but the
        average number of moves appears that it might be 45 instead of 40. 45
        moves done at 3.5 moves per second is 12.86, so I think sub-13 is a
        reasonable goal for ZB once you know all the algs and have completely
        mastered the system. Also my worst COLL/PLL solves were three 62's and
        my best ZBLL solve was a 37. 37 at 3.5 moves per second could have been
        10.57 for someone who had this system completely mastered. Well, I guess
        I am shooting for sub-13 in 10 years or less ;-) Chris

        Well, Square 1 has one feature that makes it nicer than the 3x3x3 to
        solve. You can swap two edges or two corners without moving any other
        pieces. So, the easiest way to break down a three cycle is into two
        swaps of two edge pieces. Now let me talk a bit about notation. Jaap
        manages to do a good job of describing (that's also where the algorithms
        are from). I'll try to paraphrase. There are only two axes on which the
        square 1 can move. You can turn the top or the bottom or you can do a
        twist diagonally across the cube. The twist is denoted as a "/". Turning
        the top and the bottom is denoted like this: (x, y) Where x is the
        number of 30 degree clockwise turns on the top (30 degrees is one edge
        and 60 degrees is one corner). y is the same thing for the bottom. x and
        y can be negative numbers, indicating that the face should go
        counterclockwise that many degrees. Now, the algorithm for swapping two
        edges, UF and UL, is (1,0)/(-3,0)/
        (-1,-1)/(3,0)/(1,1)/(-3,0)/(-1,-1)/(4,1)/(-1,0) This will also swap DF
        and DR, but after you do the second swap, this will return itself to
        normal. You also could just get a three cycle algorithm. To Cycle
        UF-&gt;UB-&gt;UR do (1,0)/(-1,2)/(-5,1)/(0,3)/(-3,0)/(5,2)/(-5,4)/(-4,0)
        And to go the opposite direction, you can just do this algorithm
        backwards. -Ben. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, Michael

        The ZB method is an interesting process. I'm happy with it just doing
        ZBF2L-&gt;OLL-&gt;PLL As my recognition for orientations is almost
        instant. My average number of turns wouldn't be affected though unless I
        started learning ZBLL, as I average about 55 turns a solve anyway. At
        the very least everyone should learn the most basic cases for ZBF2L.
        They're easy to recognize, and many are very fast. -Richard --- cmhardw

        &gt; and have completely &gt; mastered the system. &gt; &gt; Also my
        worst COLL/PLL solves were three 62's and my &gt; best ZBLL solve &gt;
        was a 37. 37 at 3.5 moves per second could have &gt; been 10.57 for &gt;
        someone who had this system completely mastered. &gt; &gt; Well, I guess
        I am shooting for sub-13 in 10 years &gt; or less ;-) &gt; &gt; Chris

        Lars Vand.. IS working on his page on his method of solving the
        square-1. it will be up soon on his website www.cubezone.be hang in
        there :P --- Ben King &lt;grsbmd@...&gt; wrote: &gt; &gt; Well, Square 1
        has one feature that makes it nicer &gt; than the 3x3x3 to &gt; solve.
        You can swap two edges or two corners &gt; without moving any &gt; other
        pieces. So, the easiest way to break down a &gt; three cycle is &gt;
        into two swaps of two edge pieces. &gt; &gt; Now let me talk a bit about
        notation. Jaap manages &gt; to do a good job &gt; of describing (that's
        also where the algorithms are &gt; from). I'll try &gt; to paraphrase.
        There are only two axes on which the &gt; square 1 can &gt; move. You
        can turn the top or the bottom or you can &gt; do a twist &gt;
        diagonally across the cube. The twist is denoted as &gt; a "/". Turning
        &gt; the top and the bottom is denoted like this: (x, y) &gt; Where x is
        the &gt; number of 30 degree clockwise turns on the top (30 &gt; degrees
        is one &gt; edge and 60 degrees is one corner). y is the same &gt; thing
        for the &gt; bottom. x and y can be negative numbers, indicating &gt;
        that the face &gt; should go counterclockwise that many degrees. &gt;
        &gt; Now, the algorithm for swapping two edges, UF and &gt; UL, is
        (1,0)/(-3,0)/ &gt; (-1,-1)/(3,0)/(1,1)/(-3,0)/(-1,-1)/(4,1)/(-1,0) &gt;
        &gt; This will also swap DF and DR, but after you do the &gt; second
        swap, this &gt; will return itself to normal. &gt; &gt; You also could
        just get a three cycle algorithm. To &gt; Cycle UF-&gt;UB-&gt;UR &gt; do
        &gt; (1,0)/(-1,2)/(-5,1)/(0,3)/(-3,0)/(5,2)/(-5,4)/(-4,0) &gt; &gt; And
        to go the opposite direction, you can just do &gt; this algorithm &gt;
        backwards. &gt; &gt; -Ben. &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        the thin wedges on the top row. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        It's been awhile since I've been around these parts, but I am still a
        someone active cuber... Here's proof. Today I (with a couple friends)
        finished making (the first version) of my take on a Rubik's Cube Solving
        Robot. It takes a while to load, cuz the file is so large. There is a
        long pause when it's *thinking*.
        &lt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/Cubebot_DivX.avi&gt; Recorded
        Friday April, 22, 2005 for a demo to the professors of an
        "Microprocessor-Based Embedded-Systems Design" Course I was taking as a
        final project. (It solves in a little under 38 seconds from one
        measurement I took. That my not be the case in this video.) It starts
        off by reading in the 6 faces by perfoming a 360 on each face. Then it
        takes about 27 seconds to *think*, that video was taken without the
        I-Cache or D-Cashe turned on (if you know what that means) or with
        millisecond interrupts turned off during that processing, so it could
        have been much faster (&lt;8 sec). It was running at 20Mhz Bus Speed and
        off a Motorola Power PC chip (the MPC823, very ancient). It's an
        embedded systems design, meaning it can be easily made to be portable.
        (It does *NOT* rely on an computer for processing.) It goes
        counterclockwise always, and overshoots... a protocol the same (or
        opposite) to what the DeepCube people used. We just wanted to get it
        working..., I can go in a modify it now that we know it is precise
        enough not to lock-up more then say 1% of the time... though I would put
        in an "anti-lock-up" protocal that detects-and-reverses. It is applying
        a breath-first search for the cross..., does the 4 c/e-pairs, CLL, and
        then ELL. (The LL according to my personal algorithms.) This was pretty
        close to a method I used to use, before moving onto something much more
        insane. It is essentially what Guus R. Schultz and/or Akimoto uses/used
        as well. It does c/e-pairing in a fairly sophisticated manner different
        from what is usually seen in stage-based solver programs I have seen
        before. Averages 69.1 quarter turns (i.e. QTM) in an average of 100,000
        runs. Though counter-clockwise is currently executed as a 270 rotation.
        It never does more then 270 on a face during solving. All these figures
        can be readily optimized now that everything else is reliable. And yes,
        it is dangling a few inches from the table due to us having to wire it
        up in a rush not using any ties to the frame. It can stand on 3 points
        of the frame as well. Just simple aluminum frame and some precise
        whelding. Oh, and that is NOT the standard color scheme, it is my own.
        BTW, if tHe bandwidth gets terrible, feel free to mirror the file
        elsewhere..., say on speedcubing.com. -Doug Li (Happy Cubing)

        Thats great. This may be a stupid question but does it effectively solve
        blindfold? That is: is the solve worked out from beginning to end before
        it does the first move, or is it rescanning the cube continually, or
        once it has scanned once is it calculating the new position while its
        moving? Or is there another option of which I haven't thought! Duncan

        Solving Robot=== &gt; &gt; &gt; It's been awhile since I've been around
        these parts, but I am still &gt; a someone active cuber... Here's proof.
        &gt; &gt; Today I (with a couple friends) finished making (the first
        version) &gt; of my take on a Rubik's Cube Solving Robot. &gt; &gt; It
        takes a while to load, cuz the file is so large. There is a long &gt;
        pause when it's *thinking*. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &lt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/Cubebot_DivX.avi&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Recorded Friday April, 22, 2005 for a demo to the professors of
        &gt; an "Microprocessor-Based Embedded-Systems Design" Course I was &gt;
        taking as a final project. (It solves in a little under 38 seconds &gt;
        from one measurement I took. That my not be the case in this video.)
        &gt; &gt; It starts off by reading in the 6 faces by perfoming a 360 on
        each &gt; face. Then it takes about 27 seconds to *think*, that video
        was &gt; taken without the I-Cache or D-Cashe turned on (if you know
        what &gt; that means) or with millisecond interrupts turned off during
        that &gt; processing, so it could have been much faster (&lt;8 sec). It
        was &gt; running at 20Mhz Bus Speed and off a Motorola Power PC chip
        (the &gt; MPC823, very ancient). &gt; &gt; It's an embedded systems
        design, meaning it can be easily made to be &gt; portable. (It does
        *NOT* rely on an computer for processing.) &gt; &gt; It goes
        counterclockwise always, and overshoots... a protocol the &gt; same (or
        opposite) to what the DeepCube people used. We just wanted &gt; to get
        it working..., I can go in a modify it now that we know it is &gt;
        precise enough not to lock-up more then say 1% of the time... though
        &gt; I would put in an "anti-lock-up" protocal that
        detects-and-reverses. &gt; &gt; It is applying a breath-first search for
        the cross..., does the 4 &gt; c/e-pairs, CLL, and then ELL. (The LL
        according to my personal &gt; algorithms.) This was pretty close to a
        method I used to use, before &gt; moving onto something much more
        insane. It is essentially what Guus &gt; R. Schultz and/or Akimoto
        uses/used as well. &gt; &gt; It does c/e-pairing in a fairly
        sophisticated manner different from &gt; what is usually seen in
        stage-based solver programs I have seen &gt; before. &gt; &gt; Averages
        69.1 quarter turns (i.e. QTM) in an average of 100,000 &gt; runs. Though
        counter-clockwise is currently executed as a 270 &gt; rotation. It never
        does more then 270 on a face during solving. All &gt; these figures can
        be readily optimized now that everything else is &gt; reliable. &gt;
        &gt; And yes, it is dangling a few inches from the table due to us
        having &gt; to wire it up in a rush not using any ties to the frame. It
        can &gt; stand on 3 points of the frame as well. Just simple aluminum
        frame &gt; and some precise whelding. &gt; &gt; Oh, and that is NOT the
        standard color scheme, it is my own. &gt; &gt; BTW, if tHe bandwidth
        gets terrible, feel free to mirror the file &gt; elsewhere..., say on

        I've gone through 3 new Rubik's 5x5x5 and they all suck. The first one
        wasn't too bad but was very hard to turn, even after lubing and playing
        with it for a month. I recently bought 2 more hoping for a good one but
        these are worst. &gt;From the first turn of the cube pieces just wanted
        to start twisting out. The molding of the plastic is very poor. The cube
        looks lumpy and out of square. I contacted customer services, but just
        got the ship it back response. Now I'll be out shipping and have to pray
        that the replacements are usable. I've purchased and used all the

        Well, on deepcube, After the scramble, and any other moves that people
        do on it (as I now have a nice GUI with which a user can do any moves
        that he/she likes ;-)), the moves are stored in a file. When someone
        presses solve, the computer does those moves on a virtual cube, so that
        it knows the state of the cube. It then passes this state to the solver
        (slightly modified version of mike reid's solver) and passes the
        solution to a file. This solution is then converted to motor commands,
        and output at the right times. So in essence, yes, it does blindfold.
        One more question for Doug, how well does the visual feedback work for
        the motors? I was thinking of trying something like that, but the motors
        that I currently do not support it in any simple fashion. -Evan Until

        hahahah, that's hilarious! something similar has happened to me, it was
        very interesting. about five cubies popped, which is quite a lot, and
        because of the way I was holding the cube, I dropped it. AND because of
        the poor quality/age of the cube I was using, it more or less exploded
        on impact with the floor. I found about 12 pieces, but I didn't find the
        rest of the pieces OR the central axle, which is the weirdest bit of
        all. a couple weeks later, I was cleaning my room (finally) and found

        a little under 38 seconds &gt; &gt; from one measurement I took. That my
        not be the case in this video.) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It starts off by
        reading in the 6 faces by perfoming a 360 on each &gt; &gt; face. Then
        it takes about 27 seconds to *think*, that video was &gt; &gt; taken
        without the I-Cache or D-Cashe turned on (if you know what &gt; &gt;
        that means) or with millisecond interrupts turned off during that &gt;
        &gt; processing, so it could have been much faster (&lt;8 sec). It was
        &gt; &gt; running at 20Mhz Bus Speed and off a Motorola Power PC chip
        (the &gt; &gt; MPC823, very ancient). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's an
        embedded systems design, meaning it can be easily made to be &gt; &gt;
        portable. (It does *NOT* rely on an computer for processing.) &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; It goes counterclockwise always, and overshoots... a protocol
        the &gt; &gt; same (or opposite) to what the DeepCube people used. We
        just wanted &gt; &gt; to get it working..., I can go in a modify it now
        that we know it is &gt; &gt; precise enough not to lock-up more then say
        1% of the time... though &gt; &gt; I would put in an "anti-lock-up"
        protocal that detects-and- reverses. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is applying
        a breath-first search for the cross..., does the 4 &gt; &gt; c/e-pairs,
        CLL, and then ELL. (The LL according to my personal &gt; &gt;
        algorithms.) This was pretty close to a method I used to use, before
        &gt; &gt; moving onto something much more insane. It is essentially what
        Guus &gt; &gt; R. Schultz and/or Akimoto uses/used as well. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; It does c/e-pairing in a fairly sophisticated manner different
        from &gt; &gt; what is usually seen in stage-based solver programs I
        have seen &gt; &gt; before. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Averages 69.1 quarter
        turns (i.e. QTM) in an average of 100,000 &gt; &gt; runs. Though
        counter-clockwise is currently executed as a 270 &gt; &gt; rotation. It
        never does more then 270 on a face during solving. All &gt; &gt; these
        figures can be readily optimized now that everything else is &gt; &gt;
        reliable. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And yes, it is dangling a few inches from
        the table due to us having &gt; &gt; to wire it up in a rush not using
        any ties to the frame. It can &gt; &gt; stand on 3 points of the frame
        as well. Just simple aluminum frame &gt; &gt; and some precise whelding.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, and that is NOT the standard color scheme, it is
        my own. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, if tHe bandwidth gets terrible, feel
        free to mirror the file &gt; &gt; elsewhere..., say on speedcubing.com.

        Raul Garcia and I are the unofficial record holders in the Blindfold
        Team Solve (BTS) category (one person holds the cube but never looks at
        it...the second person sees the cube and tells the first person what
        moves/algs to do but the second person can't touch the cube). We'd like
        to see more people in this category but that means having two
        speedcubers who live near eachother. Last night, Chris Hardwick and I
        tried a version of the BTS that two cubers can try even if they don't
        live close together. Chris would mix up his cube, hold the cube in front
        of his webcam, and close his eyes. I watched his webcam and told him
        (over the phone) what moves/algs to do. We even tried ZBF2L on some of
        the solves. Our best average of 10 solves was about 2:20 and our single
        best solve was 1:27. We use a bunch of codes that Raul and I adapted
        from Katsui's F2L page. Chris will post them soon in case anyone is
        interested in learning them. Raul and I generally do a 3-look last layer
        and we've got names for each of the edge orientation, corner
        orientation, and PLL cases. We'll probably do some demonstrations at the
        New York tournament next month. I'm not sure what the limits are for the
        BTS over a webcam but I'm hoping some of you will try it out. One thing
        that slowed us down was a poor refresh rate for the cam (only about 1
        frame per second and a half) which means I couldn't look ahead at all.
        In summary: BTS is a lot of fun and you only need a webcam (or two) and
        a phone (a microphone might be better and cheaper). Give it a shot! Ian

        that it had to be a piece of cake for me to solve it. I was proved

        square piece be turned 120 degrees? Right, it's the triangle shaped
        piece of South America that is actually fixed in the body of the globe.
        Does anybody know how I can remove the piece and place it back correctly
        without destroying the whole puzzle? Mirek

        congratulate everyone for their great performances at German Cube Day,
        it was a real privilege to be there and watch the masters in action :) I
        would like to say thank you to Joel for his hospitality, and the rest of
        the Dutch gang + Lars for making me feel so welcome and a part of their
        group during the weekend. Also a great thank you to Patrick Bellenbaum
        for hosting the event, you did a great job :) Hope to see you all again
        soon at Dutch Cube Day in October... and perhaps even in the UK if there
        will be an event this year, it wuld be very cool! I will post my
        experience on my webpage (cubestation.co.uk) very soon, with pictures
        and movies and results. I would be really grateful to everybody there
        who was taking pictures if they could maybe send me the pictures to my
        email (danh@...), or perhaps just send me an email to tell me where I
        can find them? I would like to build a comprehensive collection of media

        Hello everybody, It was the first time that i have come to a compation
        and meet all the cubers. I did have a great time there. And same as Joël
        the nevers was braking me with the clocks and the kubus in the semifinal
        i hope i can get over that :) Someone did video my record on the
        mastermagic sorry i did not cast you name :( I hope you will react on
        this forum to stay in contact. see you all at the next event :) greets

        let you all know that I had a great time at &gt; the German Open
        yesterday! It was very nice too meet all those cubers &gt; again! The
        ambiance was really great. &gt; &gt; I was glad I could realize some of
        my goals, but as usual, I could not &gt; realize all of them.. I should
        really find a way to master those &gt; nerves :). &gt; &gt;
        Congratulationswith the new records everybody, especially Stefan &gt;
        (megaminx!!) and Lars (some ER's). And DanH, with the new UK &gt;
        record.. ;) &gt; &gt; Cheers! ;) &gt; &gt; Joël. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I pretty much built every part from scratch... a lot of whelding had to
        be done, and I managed to do all the soldering myself. I suppose I could
        implement a Kocimba's algorithm..., but I'd rather just keep adding
        various human speedsolving methods. I would like it to illistrate
        different methodologies rather then just solve it as fast as possible. I
        think I can take it down to under 15s if I want to go for speed, which
        I'll probabily do just to demponsrate it's abilities. If it locks up for
        a few minutes, I can go up to it and fix the lock- up and it goes on
        it's merry way without loss of memory/state. HECK, if you turn it OFF,
        and turn it back on a few minutes later it will continue mid-solve. It
        currently has a 20MHz IBM embedded processor in it, I can upgrade that.
        Such a chip can be aquired for $15 or a free sample request. It worked
        out to be about $200 of parts. So fairly cheap. There was about $70
        spent on **white** LEDs :(. It cost $50 for the material for the frame:
        aluminum chasis, steel-shafts, high-quality ball- bearings. I'm thinking
        $60 for motors. And $20 for other odd stuff. The image processing is
        mostly done in hardware. There is no software processing it much, except
        to shift some values for different lighting backgrounds..., chack ranges
        that RGB values fall in. The motor control is done with some black
        posterboard wheels with lines on them. They are read by an
        IR-emitter/IR-sensor pair that I put on the underside of the motors.
        Currently, there are 16 regions on each disk, the other side has 32
        regions equally spaced, so a value can be changed in the software and
        the disks flipped to double the precision. The motors themselves took
        several hours to hack and mod for the proper calibration, torque, speed
        and stuff. It was an inital demo for the professors, better stuff is yet
        to come. hopefully I have time with two final exams left, one in Galois
        theory and one in Probability theory. I want to get it doing in both
        directions in one week, instead of always going clockwise to avoid
        lock-ups. Right now I have to prepare a presentation, report, and
        website for it. That'll be due Monday midnight. *sigh* Note that once
        the program is uploaded into the processor the computer can be
        dis-connected and the CubeBot is fully functional, able to do manual
        control, say from an old 8-bit Nintendo Controller (this hasn't been put
        in yet, current manual control is done with some DIP switches and button
        presses on thh board). It does the solve by first scanning the cube
        stickers in and then taking say 7.6seconds to *think*. It does some
        searchs and uses look-up tables..., it trys different paths and selects
        the optimal among them, etc. -Doug --- In

        the &gt; state of the cube. It then passes this state to the solver
        (slightly &gt; modified version of mike reid's solver) and passes the
        solution to a &gt; file. This solution is then converted to motor
        commands, and output &gt; at the right times. So in essence, yes, it
        does blindfold. &gt; &gt; One more question for Doug, how well does the
        visual feedback work for &gt; the motors? I was thinking of trying
        something like that, but the &gt; motors that I currently do not support
        it in any simple fashion. &gt; &gt; -Evan &gt; &gt; Until next time,

        does the first move, or is it rescanning the cube continually, or once

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's been awhile since I've been around these
        parts, but I am still &gt; &gt; &gt; a someone active cuber... Here's
        proof. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today I (with a couple friends)
        finished making (the first version) &gt; &gt; &gt; of my take on a
        Rubik's Cube Solving Robot. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It takes a
        while to load, cuz the file is so large. There is a long &gt; &gt; &gt;
        pause when it's *thinking*. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &lt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/Cubebot_DivX.avi&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Recorded Friday April, 22, 2005 for a
        demo to the professors of &gt; &gt; &gt; an "Microprocessor-Based
        Embedded-Systems Design" Course I was &gt; &gt; &gt; taking as a final
        project. (It solves in a little under 38 seconds &gt; &gt; &gt; from one
        measurement I took. That my not be the case in this video.) &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It starts off by reading in the 6 faces by perfoming
        a 360 on each &gt; &gt; &gt; face. Then it takes about 27 seconds to
        *think*, that video was &gt; &gt; &gt; taken without the I-Cache or
        D-Cashe turned on (if you know what &gt; &gt; &gt; that means) or with
        millisecond interrupts turned off during that &gt; &gt; &gt; processing,
        so it could have been much faster (&lt;8 sec). It was &gt; &gt; &gt;
        running at 20Mhz Bus Speed and off a Motorola Power PC chip (the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; MPC823, very ancient). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's an
        embedded systems design, meaning it can be easily made to be &gt; &gt;
        &gt; portable. (It does *NOT* rely on an computer for processing.) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It goes counterclockwise always, and
        overshoots... a protocol the &gt; &gt; &gt; same (or opposite) to what
        the DeepCube people used. We just wanted &gt; &gt; &gt; to get it
        working..., I can go in a modify it now that we know it is &gt; &gt;
        &gt; precise enough not to lock-up more then say 1% of the time...
        though &gt; &gt; &gt; I would put in an "anti-lock-up" protocal that
        detects-and- reverses. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is applying a
        breath-first search for the cross..., does the 4 &gt; &gt; &gt;
        c/e-pairs, CLL, and then ELL. (The LL according to my personal &gt; &gt;
        &gt; algorithms.) This was pretty close to a method I used to use,
        before &gt; &gt; &gt; moving onto something much more insane. It is
        essentially what Guus &gt; &gt; &gt; R. Schultz and/or Akimoto uses/used
        as well. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It does c/e-pairing in a fairly
        sophisticated manner different from &gt; &gt; &gt; what is usually seen
        in stage-based solver programs I have seen &gt; &gt; &gt; before. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Averages 69.1 quarter turns (i.e. QTM) in an
        average of 100,000 &gt; &gt; &gt; runs. Though counter-clockwise is
        currently executed as a 270 &gt; &gt; &gt; rotation. It never does more
        then 270 on a face during solving. All &gt; &gt; &gt; these figures can
        be readily optimized now that everything else is &gt; &gt; &gt;
        reliable. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And yes, it is dangling a few
        inches from the table due to us having &gt; &gt; &gt; to wire it up in a
        rush not using any ties to the frame. It can &gt; &gt; &gt; stand on 3
        points of the frame as well. Just simple aluminum frame &gt; &gt; &gt;
        and some precise whelding. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, and that is
        NOT the standard color scheme, it is my own. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; BTW, if tHe bandwidth gets terrible, feel free to mirror the file
        &gt; &gt; &gt; elsewhere..., say on speedcubing.com. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi, a technical question: Did anyone of you already tried/managed to
        connect the speedstacks timer to a PC (via the output that is used by
        the competition timer display)? My goal would be to have the time that
        is displayed on the timer itself also available at the PC (for further
        use in excel, etc.) Any ideas and/or experience welcome, all the best,
        Patrick

        algorithm..., but I'd rather just keep &gt; adding various human
        speedsolving methods. I would like it to &gt; illistrate different
        methodologies rather then just solve it as fast &gt; as possible. &gt;
        &gt; I think I can take it down to under 15s if I want to go for speed,
        &gt; which I'll probabily do just to demponsrate it's abilities. &gt;
        &gt; If it locks up for a few minutes, I can go up to it and fix the
        lock- &gt; up and it goes on it's merry way without loss of
        memory/state. &gt; &gt; HECK, if you turn it OFF, and turn it back on a
        few minutes later it &gt; will continue mid-solve. &gt; &gt; It
        currently has a 20MHz IBM embedded processor in it, I can upgrade &gt;
        that. Such a chip can be aquired for $15 or a free sample request. &gt;
        &gt; It worked out to be about $200 of parts. So fairly cheap. There was
        &gt; about $70 spent on **white** LEDs :(. It cost $50 for the material
        &gt; for the frame: aluminum chasis, steel-shafts, high-quality ball-
        &gt; bearings. I'm thinking $60 for motors. And $20 for other odd stuff.
        &gt; &gt; The image processing is mostly done in hardware. There is no
        &gt; software processing it much, except to shift some values for &gt;
        different lighting backgrounds..., chack ranges that RGB values fall
        &gt; in. &gt; &gt; The motor control is done with some black posterboard
        wheels with &gt; lines on them. They are read by an IR-emitter/IR-sensor
        pair that I &gt; put on the underside of the motors. Currently, there
        are 16 regions &gt; on each disk, the other side has 32 regions equally
        spaced, so a &gt; value can be changed in the software and the disks
        flipped to double &gt; the precision. &gt; &gt; The motors themselves
        took several hours to hack and mod for the &gt; proper calibration,
        torque, speed and stuff. &gt; &gt; It was an inital demo for the
        professors, better stuff is yet to &gt; come. hopefully I have time with
        two final exams left, one in Galois &gt; theory and one in Probability
        theory. I want to get it doing in both &gt; directions in one week,
        instead of always going clockwise to avoid &gt; lock-ups. Right now I
        have to prepare a presentation, report, and &gt; website for it. That'll
        be due Monday midnight. *sigh* &gt; &gt; Note that once the program is
        uploaded into the processor the &gt; computer can be dis-connected and
        the CubeBot is fully functional, &gt; able to do manual control, say
        from an old 8-bit Nintendo Controller &gt; (this hasn't been put in yet,
        current manual control is done with &gt; some DIP switches and button
        presses on thh board). It does the &gt; solve by first scanning the cube
        stickers in and then taking say &gt; 7.6seconds to *think*. It does some
        searchs and uses look-up &gt; tables..., it trys different paths and
        selects the optimal among &gt; them, etc. &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt;

        modified version of mike reid's solver) and passes the solution to &gt;
        a &gt;&gt; file. This solution is then converted to motor commands, and

        the visual feedback work &gt; for &gt;&gt; the motors? I was thinking of

        not support it in any simple fashion. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -Evan &gt;&gt;

        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's
        been awhile since I've been around these parts, but I am &gt; still
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a someone active cuber... Here's proof.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Today I (with a couple friends)
        finished making (the first &gt; version) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of my take on
        a Rubik's Cube Solving Robot. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It takes
        a while to load, cuz the file is so large. There is a &gt; long
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pause when it's *thinking*. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &lt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/Cubebot_DivX.avi&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Recorded Friday
        April, 22, 2005 for a demo to the professors of &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an
        "Microprocessor-Based Embedded-Systems Design" Course I was
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taking as a final project. (It solves in a little under
        38 &gt; seconds &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from one measurement I took. That my
        not be the case in this &gt; video.) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        It starts off by reading in the 6 faces by perfoming a 360 on &gt; each
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; face. Then it takes about 27 seconds to *think*, that
        video was &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taken without the I-Cache or D-Cashe turned
        on (if you know &gt; what &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that means) or with
        millisecond interrupts turned off during &gt; that &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        processing, so it could have been much faster (&lt;8 sec). It was
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; running at 20Mhz Bus Speed and off a Motorola Power PC
        chip &gt; (the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MPC823, very ancient). &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's an embedded systems design, meaning it can be
        easily made &gt; to be &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portable. (It does *NOT* rely on
        an computer for processing.) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It goes
        counterclockwise always, and overshoots... a protocol &gt; the
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same (or opposite) to what the DeepCube people used. We
        just &gt; wanted &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to get it working..., I can go in a
        modify it now that we know &gt; it is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; precise enough
        not to lock-up more then say 1% of the time... &gt; though
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would put in an "anti-lock-up" protocal that
        detects-and- &gt; reverses. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is
        applying a breath-first search for the cross..., does &gt; the 4
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; c/e-pairs, CLL, and then ELL. (The LL according to my
        personal &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; algorithms.) This was pretty close to a method
        I used to use, &gt; before &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; moving onto something much
        more insane. It is essentially what &gt; Guus &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; R.
        Schultz and/or Akimoto uses/used as well. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It does c/e-pairing in a fairly sophisticated manner
        different &gt; from &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what is usually seen in stage-based
        solver programs I have seen &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Averages 69.1 quarter turns (i.e. QTM) in an average of
        100,000 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; runs. Though counter-clockwise is currently
        executed as a 270 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rotation. It never does more then 270
        on a face during &gt; solving. All &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these figures can be
        readily optimized now that everything &gt; else is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        reliable. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And yes, it is dangling a
        few inches from the table due to us &gt; having &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to wire
        it up in a rush not using any ties to the frame. It can &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        stand on 3 points of the frame as well. Just simple aluminum &gt; frame
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and some precise whelding. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, and that is NOT the standard color scheme, it is my
        own. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BTW, if tHe bandwidth gets
        terrible, feel free to mirror the &gt; file &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        elsewhere..., say on speedcubing.com. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

        I've got a Hungrian Globe which I received as a gift. The one like that
        &gt; pictured on http://isacisco.free.fr/casserubiks.htm . It was mixed
        and &gt; I thought that it had to be a piece of cake for me to solve it.
        I was &gt; proved wrong! One piece is turned 120 degrees clockwise. You
        wonder how &gt; can a square piece be turned 120 degrees? Right, it's
        the triangle &gt; shaped piece of South America that is actually fixed
        in the body of the &gt; globe. &gt; Does anybody know how I can remove
        the piece and place it back &gt; correctly without destroying the whole
        puzzle? &gt; Mirek

        &gt; &gt; &gt; I was quite interested in the new white plastic DIY

        new white plastic DIY &gt; &gt; cubes from Rubiks.com, however when they
        arrived I was disappointed &gt; to &gt; &gt; find the they didn't have

        there will be a stand included. later in the year &gt; (in &gt; &gt;

        will be to the new higher standard. &gt; &gt; &gt; The cube kit on

        indeed wrong. What does this have to do with the white cubes? &gt; Also

        The picture is quite small but I think it shows flat centers. Simply
        click on "larger photos" and you'll see the one I showed you. I also got
        my cubes today and they look exactly like on the picture. So where's the
        problem? I don't think you should complain when they did something
        *right*, just because they've done a mistake somewhere else. Btw, what
        did rubiks.com say when you told them about this? Cheers! Stefan

        A question for all the skilled cubists out there: do you have any
        exercises that you perform to enhance your cubing abilities? I know I
        can figure this stuff out, but I guess I am looking to see if there is
        some advice or experience that can help speed the trial and error
        process up. I am looking for things that will help me concentrate on
        changing the position of one's grip fluidly; increasing the average
        turns per minute; see the cube better; etc. I could just perform a
        single algorithm over and over until it is down, but I was hoping there
        was something that could give an overall improvement, and not just on a
        per algorithm basis. Perhaps this does not exist in speedcubing, but in
        other skills people perform drills that increase ability before getting
        to the actual game. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.

        Thanks a lot! I looked at it again and indeed it seems to be basically
        correct but something's systematically wrong. I think the easiest way to
        fix it would be to swap the left and right parts of either page 1 or 3.
        Will tell rubiks.com about it. Also it would be nice if the rings on
        page 1 could be truly connected instead of just overlapping. If they
        can't fix it, I might print one page, cut it in half, swap the halves
        and glue them together, then print the other page. Sigh... Cheers!

        Sorry, couldn't help jumping on this one :-) Rotate the top either once
        clockwise or once counterclockwise and place it back down (since right
        now the cube is obviously not a normal cube, some pieces have two
        stickers the same color). Call the faces that we can see U, R, F, going
        counterclockwise and starting from the top face. The corner in UFL has
        stickers for blue and orange after the top rotation, and would need to
        belong in the DFR spot to be solved. However the other corner with
        Blue-orange is in UFR and would need to be rotated clockwise to be
        solved. This puts the third sticker of that corner, yellow, in the top
        layer, but the top layer sticker of UFR needs to be light blue when that
        piece is solved :-) Silly cube personal storage container makers :)

        This brings up an interesting question, how many positions have one face
        symmetrical enough that you can have a container like this, such that
        all 4 orientations of the top create a solvable cube? All 4 corners
        would have to be the same color, since you can't create corners with in
        correct color combinations. Even if you could switch the U sticker of a
        corner with that sticker's opposite color, the two side colors on the
        corner would now be in the incorrect positions for a solvable cube. It
        seems that the edges could potentially not all have to be the same
        color, as long as any rotation of the top face created 4 actual edges
        for that cube, and seemingly only did a double transposition of them
        since you can't change the parity without changing the corner parity.
        Also, if the edges appear to flip at all, you can only flip an even
        number. So let's say that all the corner stickers on the loose face (the
        one we can take off) are orange say. Obviously if all the edge stickers
        are the same then there are no problems, but that's boring :-) Also, as
        I'll show you can have some top configurations that don't have that.
        Below the edges are written such that they belong in the spots (in the
        same order as written below) UB UR UF UL and the first color shows what
        is the top layer sticker, and the second shows what is the bottom layer
        sticker. White-Green Yellow-Orange White-Orange Yellow-Green So the top
        layer is somewhat symmetrical, and only has 2 possible states. By
        turning the top once clockwise or counterclockwise you perform the cycle
        (UB UL) (UR UF) which is an even permutation (you haven't changed the
        corner permutation since all the top layer stickers for the corners are
        the same color. Also, no edges flip so we're good there too. I'm
        currently taking a break from writing a big paper due tomorrow :-D, but
        I wanted to post that one example to show it was possible. Are there any
        others that work too? You'll notice that the pattern of the top layer
        stickers in my example form a plus sign, and each line of the plus is
        one solid color. Is that a necessary condition? Are there other ways to
        do this besides the obvious all corners one color and all edges some
        other color? Having all the corners one color is a requirement of
        course, but what other cool things can be done with the edges, if any?
        One last thing, notice that if you use a certain edge sticker color in
        the top layer, that you can't have its opposite color, or same color, in
        the side layer of the edges. This is because any rotation of the top
        must be possible, so you have to avoid creating say a red-red or
        red-orange edge. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        found the only non-boring solution. Imagine a color (say red) only
        appears once in either the top four edges of the side four. Because we
        don't want a red-red edge it the other four can't be red. Since that red
        needs a certain partner, for rotation the whole other group needs to be
        that partner color. If the top four are that monocolor group, then it's
        valid but boring. If the side four are that monocolor group, then the
        top four colors need to be all different. But then a quarter turn is an
        odd permutation, making it invalid. So every color needs to appear at
        least twice (and in the same group of four). It can't be three because
        this would force another color to be alone. So every color appears
        either 2 or 4 times (and in the same group of four) and 4 is boring.
        Thus, all colors should appear twice and we have four colors, just like
        in your solution. There are only two patterns: Cross and Adjacent. We
        can't have the same pattern in both groups, this would lead to duplicate
        edges. Cross on top and Adjacent on sides works, that's your solution.
        The other way around doesn't work (easy to check). Cheers! Stefan

        the DFR spot to be solved. &gt; However the other corner with
        Blue-orange is in UFR and would need to &gt; be rotated clockwise to be
        solved. This puts the third sticker of &gt; that corner, yellow, in the
        top layer, but the top layer sticker of &gt; UFR needs to be light blue
        when that piece is solved :-) &gt; &gt; Silly cube personal storage

        I'm not following all of the discussion, but suppose this (Y/W, B/G,
        R/O): Up face: all corner colors are same, edges are R, O, B, G (in any
        order). UF/UR edges: on the F and R sides they are, say, Y and W. So the

        ya the best way would be to use a water pan as a weight. since water has
        density of 1gm/cc and volume measuring instruments are much more
        accesible, this will make the measurements more accurate. and if u
        really want to be accurate use verniers;) --- Tyson Mao &lt;tmao@...&gt;

        I did a cube medal from clay as an assignment for our art course. I took
        two photos of it (they are uploaded in the photos section of the group,
        the folder named Sebastian). To paint it more easily I scrambled my cube
        and copied the position. So it's a legal position. There's a poster in a
        classroom in our school which shows a timeline with some stuff about the
        EU. In the 80's there's a drawing of the cube, and it's impossible for
        the same reason: two corners with the same clockwise order of colours.
        On Dan's Cubestation there are four cubes on the lefthand side of the
        page, showing the 4 steps of the Fridrich method. The cube next to
        "Orient last layer" shows an impossible position again for the same
        reason. So cubers sometimes make this mistake too! Sebastian

        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Please help me find the R value for a 3x3x3
        spring. &gt; &gt;&gt; I'd like to validate my theory that says an old
        smooth cube would be &gt; &gt;&gt; very fast with very strong springs.
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Gilles. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Haha, that's
        funny. Exactly today I'm finalizing my thoughts about &gt; &gt; what
        springs I think will be perfect. I'm also going to order from a &gt;
        &gt; spring manufacturer, like I've done before. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But
        my claim is: They need very *weak* springs. We'll see who's right &gt;
        &gt; ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Btw, that website doesn't load for me. Will
        try again later. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt;

        Hi Gilles, Thanks for the interest. :-) At the moment the world rankings
        are in Excel. The hard work is getting all results in the same
        format..... The unofficial world records are either in Excel (for the
        popular categories) or in the HTML files. Updating every days takes me
        quite some time.... It is taking me more time than I actually like. :-(
        For both we are working on good programs. World rankings in PHP, so that
        people can generate personal profiles. UWR in MS Access, so that it is
        easier to do daily updates. Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message -----

        Hi, I've read the report of the german Open by Dan Harris and he
        mentioned that the cubes were checked before the competition. I find
        this completely normal but I'm wondering what is checked on the cube.
        (I've never been to any competition but I'm thinking about the Dutch
        Open in october.) I've tried to imagine how we could cheat with a cube
        but I didn't find anything except that it's possible to make it turn
        while another cube would block (for exemple : R'U badly executed). Thx

        a spam "marker" so I should've gotten it. I asked them now whether I'm

        Well.. The only thing I can think of, is that you should not be able to
        see what colour any stickers on the back sids have (when you look at the
        front), by painting it, or making your stickers in a weird way... Or,
        for BLD cubers, you can't have damaged stickers, because that might
        enable you to feel where certain stickers are. I did not notice any
        'official' checks on my cube btw, but maybe the organizer inspected them
        a little while scrambling. -Joel. --- In

        so i know i asked about commutators a while ago, and i got a pretty nice
        explanation, and i got it to work some of the time, but im running into
        problems now. so i want to do three cycles of edge peies on either a
        4x4x4 or a 5x5x5, and i know the general idea behind a commutator. the
        only problem is, almost every time i try it, i end up just doing like
        the dot pattern, M E'M'E on a 3x3x3 (hope i used the correct notation
        there), affecting a single center on all 6 sides, instead of just the
        three i want to switch. So i was wondering if someone could possibly
        explain it again, or send me to a page that has a good explanation,
        maybe it will click this time, who knows thank you in advanced -Evan

        I've been messing around with new methods for awhile that have less
        algorithms than zb but average less than fridrich. Here's the most
        viable option I've found so far: 1) f2l minus one c/e pair 7+7*3=28 2)
        pair up last c/e pair 3.5 3) insert c/e pair and solve edges. (I've
        found about half of the algorithms and so far avg. is 7.7) 4) solve
        corners 12.5 It needs 276 algorithms (including reflections and
        symmetries) and averages 51.7 moves (that might change when I find all
        the algs for step 3) which is 4 moves less than fridrich. My question
        is, does anyone think it would actually be any faster? I think with
        practice, step 3 and 4 recognition would be as fast as or faster than
        recognizing oll/pll. On my page I have almost half of the algs for step
        3 and recognition of step 3, but step 4 is not up yet.

        Greetings Mr Jones, I realise that it's probably an effort to put
        plastic through the new tooling before you dye it black, but how much
        effort would it be to cook up a bunch of white center cubies with
        arches? Lacking that, if the center caps for both the black and white
        cubes the same size then I'd settle for 2 sets of black arched center
        cubies with white caps. Thank you, David J --- In

        There aren't really any good sites for patterns on higher-order cubes,
        unfortunately. I have a personal database of a few cool 5x5x5 ones,
        although you guys can't use them because they use my notation (where f =
        turn two front layers). One of them for the 5x5x5 is 214 moves or so and
        I can't figure out how to get it better. I could, of course, solve it
        and get about 170 moves... How many moves do you guys usually take,
        excluding the 3x3x3 step if there is one? And do you have any ideas for

        Hey everyone, I just got back from an 80's dance at a really popular
        local band scene near my school. It's called Cat's Cradle and from
        rumors I've heard Dave Matthews band as well as Squirrel Nut Zippers
        used to play there before they hit it really big. Anyway they held an
        80's dance tonight, and I went as Axel Rose, wearing a red bandana, a
        plaid shirt and jeans (of course with long hair too :-) They had me get
        up on stage a couple hours in and do a solve. The crowd loved it - there
        were maybe 200-300 people there so it was pretty cool. I wasn't able to
        time the solve, but I know for sure it wasn't sub-20. I think it was a
        low twenty though (20-22), which was good for me for low light and about
        1.5 seconds of inspection :) Anyway I had a blast, and of course it
        being a crowd of 80's enthusiasts they loved it. Just wanted to share in
        case anyone was interested :) Chris

        I solve the last layer of the megaminx by first solving edges and then
        corners. That's because corners move much more freely than edges,
        they're part of three layers. Also, no nice "middle layer" twists are
        possible. So I do corners last. I've been wondering whether the same is
        true for the 3x3 cube. The algorithms section of SCC has algs for CLL
        first, ELL second. This seems bad for me now. Why not try it the other
        way around? ELL first, CLL second. Did someone try this already? Also,
        is there a comparison between the two possibilities, e.g. average number

        then CLL (42 configurations, average:11.73) (His numbers include the

        for ELL-then-CLL, but the average is indeed a little better in the

        configurations? I have a feeling it's the former, and I'd like the
        latter. I summed up the number of moves of all 42 shortest algs for
        "then CLL" and reached 491, resulting in a 491/42=11.69 average, not
        11.73. So maybe it *is* weighted... Stefan

        Hey everyone, I recently have gotten very interested in bettering my
        2x2x2 times. I had a question about one strategy that I think would help
        for those who do a "first layer first" strategy (not Gaetan's method).
        Here's is an example, Do this scramble on your 2x2x2 F' R2 U R2 U F2 U'
        F R' U' F' What if instead of solving one layer, you noticed that doing
        an R2 will solve two 2x1 blocks, effectively solving one layer. So do R2
        on this scramble. The bottom "layer" can now be treated as one layer,
        and you can do a CLL alg on the top, solving the last 4. So do B U2 B'
        U' B U' B' Then you just have to solve all the 2x1 blocks that you've
        formed, in this example it is B2. So if you combine the whole solve you
        get a very, very short solve of R2 B U2 B' U' B U' B This strategy would
        probably only really work when the two 2x1 blocks you can form have
        opposite colors as the 2 part. Notice how in that example the blocks
        were opposite colors, making it easy to still spot the CLL case, given
        that you know to convert the stickers on the "wrong" corners to their
        opposite counterparts. I imagine this would be very difficult to do for
        two 2x1 blocks that weren't opposite colors, but of course the strategy
        would work the same way. Has anyone ever messed around with a strategy
        like this? Does it work well? Chris

        Hi Chris This is a rather quirky event. It seems similar to solving one
        side with one move. I think that trying to figure out the correct CLL
        alg with a mix of U and D layer corners might cause severe headaches. At
        the very least, you might lose too much time thinking of the correct
        alg. There might be some benefit in a FMC type of event if you could
        recognize and exploit these cases. --- In

        Hey Lucas, and all following this thread. I had my first success in
        using this offset 2x1 groups as the first layer approach. I just got a
        5.90 second solve (pretty good for me) by building two 2x1 groups of
        opposite colors as my first "layer" and then solving the last "layer"
        with a CLL alg. I was able to read what the orientation case would be
        during inspection, and during the solve I was able to identify the CLL
        case. The last part to solve the four 2x1 groups into a solved 2x2x2
        wasn't hard. I think this method will be difficult to use for the harder
        to recognize CLL cases, but what helpful cool trick isn't hard to learn?
        ;-) I'm going to rehearse this and try to use it when it comes up. It
        makes for an easy, fast solve if you can do it correctly. Chris --- In

        an R2 &gt; &gt; will solve two 2x1 blocks, effectively solving one
        layer. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So do R2 on this scramble. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; The bottom "layer" can now be treated as one layer, and you can do
        a &gt; &gt; CLL alg on the top, solving the last 4. So do B U2 B' U' B
        U' B' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then you just have to solve all the 2x1 blocks
        that you've formed, in &gt; &gt; this example it is B2. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; So if you combine the whole solve you get a very, very short solve
        of &gt; &gt; R2 B U2 B' U' B U' B &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This strategy
        would probably only really work when the two 2x1 blocks &gt; &gt; you
        can form have opposite colors as the 2 part. Notice how in that &gt;
        &gt; example the blocks were opposite colors, making it easy to still
        spot &gt; &gt; the CLL case, given that you know to convert the stickers
        on the &gt; &gt; "wrong" corners to their opposite counterparts. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I imagine this would be very difficult to do for two 2x1
        blocks that &gt; &gt; weren't opposite colors, but of course the
        strategy would work the &gt; &gt; same way. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Has
        anyone ever messed around with a strategy like this? Does it work &gt;

        Hello Chris, I think that managing opposite colors during CLL as you
        proposed (and as I proposed before, and Ryan even before ;-) ) should
        not be a big problem. I can do it rather fast, but I try to avoid it
        when I want to be really fast. I'll even be more optimistic than you.
        This strategy could work without the need for opposite colors. You just
        have to learn to recognize more CLL configurations, in a different way.
        See http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Step_3.html (Possible improvement)

        Hi Michael! There's a few sticker-swapping "patterns" at Stefan
        Pochmann's site. (http://www.stefan-
        pochmann.de/spocc/other_stuff/4x4_5x5_algs/#ColorSchemeModifiers) And of
        course any 3x3x3 pattern will carry over to 4x4x4 and larger cubes n^3.
        Some do carry over with natural extensions like "cube-in- cube". U can
        make "cube-in-cube-in-cube-.....-in-cube" and so on. Like wise with spot
        patterns u can make new spots inside the "3x3x3 kind spots". Could u pls
        post ur pattern collection or give us a link to a webpage? I'd be very
        interested in finding shorter solution for ur terribly long sequence
        pattern. Im sure some algorithm with reasonable length can be worked out
        somehow (using commutators or whatever to move the various parts around
        without having to resort to the normal pairing-up 3x3x3 approach.) Have
        a look at this really simple pattern that i posted before sometime : (on

        Hi Chris.. It is an interesting strategy... But recognition is a bit of
        a problem.. However, when Fridrich published her method, some people
        thought recognizing F2L pairs would be difficult too :) (I read this
        somewhere). So maybe with practice, who knows? I should first learn CLL
        for this, though. -Joel. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        recently have gotten very interested in bettering my 2x2x2 times. I &gt;
        had a question about one strategy that I think would help for those &gt;
        who do a "first layer first" strategy (not Gaetan's method). &gt; &gt;
        Here's is an example, &gt; Do this scramble on your 2x2x2 &gt; F' R2 U
        R2 U F2 U' F R' U' F' &gt; &gt; What if instead of solving one layer,
        you noticed that doing an R2 &gt; will solve two 2x1 blocks, effectively
        solving one layer. &gt; &gt; So do R2 on this scramble. &gt; &gt; The
        bottom "layer" can now be treated as one layer, and you can do a &gt;
        CLL alg on the top, solving the last 4. So do B U2 B' U' B U' B' &gt;
        &gt; Then you just have to solve all the 2x1 blocks that you've formed,
        in &gt; this example it is B2. &gt; &gt; So if you combine the whole
        solve you get a very, very short solve of &gt; R2 B U2 B' U' B U' B &gt;
        &gt; This strategy would probably only really work when the two 2x1
        blocks &gt; you can form have opposite colors as the 2 part. Notice how
        in that &gt; example the blocks were opposite colors, making it easy to
        still spot &gt; the CLL case, given that you know to convert the
        stickers on the &gt; "wrong" corners to their opposite counterparts.
        &gt; &gt; I imagine this would be very difficult to do for two 2x1
        blocks that &gt; weren't opposite colors, but of course the strategy
        would work the &gt; same way. &gt; &gt; Has anyone ever messed around
        with a strategy like this? Does it work &gt; well? &gt; &gt; Chris

        Wow! Joel congrats on the new 5.90 average! That's awesome! I've decided
        to optimize my method with actual CLL algs wherever my COLL alg is just
        too long or too slow, so it may take me a while to improve again but
        I'll definitely try to take you up on your offer of catching up ;-)
        You've definitely got me really interested in learning Gaetan's method.
        I guess I'm so layers-entrenced that I just figured I'd go straight for
        the CLL approach when I started with the 2x2x2. Seeing that you can get
        3's with Gaetan's method defnitely makes me want to learn it though.
        Good luck with CLL if you decide to learn it, I'm learning it for the
        first time myself actually, since I use COLL right now. I'm only 0.50
        seconds behind you with COLL, so I hope learning CLL can make up the

        Actually, I kinda use a mix of Geatan's and the 'CFOP' aproach that I
        use for the 3x3. Sometimes, I first make one face, then do OLL on the
        other, and then permute both layers (PBL?). Geatan's algs are pretty
        easy. There are not that many of them, and they will enable you to see a
        way to orient all pieces very quickly. I can see the first two steps
        pretty often like that. Combined with C(O)LL, 2x2 can be solved very
        fast :). Not sure about continuing learning COLL, though.. I now know
        about 7 or 8 cases, but some of them really suck... Good luck with
        2x2-ing! Joel. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, cmhardw

        Hi Chris, I have actually thought about this before the competition. Of
        course not as advanced to CLL. I think sub 6 average is possible using
        the way that I solve the 2x2: 1)Shortest amount of moves to complete on
        layer (solution founded during inspection period) (sub 2) 2)OLL (sub 1)
        3)PLL (sub 2) Total:5 seconds+looking between each step Of course, the
        times that I got at the last competition didn't show - _-"~ ~Joseph

        Here's is an example, &gt; Do this scramble on your 2x2x2 &gt; F' R2 U
        R2 U F2 U' F R' U' F' &gt; &gt; What if instead of solving one layer,
        you noticed that doing an R2 &gt; will solve two 2x1 blocks, effectively
        solving one layer. &gt; &gt; So do R2 on this scramble. &gt; &gt; The
        bottom "layer" can now be treated as one layer, and you can do a &gt;
        CLL alg on the top, solving the last 4. So do B U2 B' U' B U' B' &gt;
        &gt; Then you just have to solve all the 2x1 blocks that you've formed,
        in &gt; this example it is B2. &gt; &gt; So if you combine the whole
        solve you get a very, very short solve of &gt; R2 B U2 B' U' B U' B &gt;
        &gt; This strategy would probably only really work when the two 2x1
        blocks &gt; you can form have opposite colors as the 2 part. Notice how
        in that &gt; example the blocks were opposite colors, making it easy to
        still spot &gt; the CLL case, given that you know to convert the
        stickers on the &gt; "wrong" corners to their opposite counterparts.
        &gt; &gt; I imagine this would be very difficult to do for two 2x1
        blocks that &gt; weren't opposite colors, but of course the strategy
        would work the &gt; same way. &gt; &gt; Has anyone ever messed around
        with a strategy like this? Does it work &gt; well? &gt; &gt; Chris

        I agree with these tips--we usually check expedia or travelocity, then
        go directly to the airline's site. But you should also check some other
        airlines that are not in the databases of expedia etc. Jetblue, for
        example, flies out of both Long Beach and Burbank non- stop to NY
        [though they go to JFK, not La Guardia]. Compared to LAX, Long Beach is
        a dream to get through; coming from Caltech I don't think it's that much
        farther to Long Beach vs. LAX. Southwest is also not in those databases,
        but don't think they go non-stop to NY. Happy travels Kirk --- In

        Resuscitating an old thread I know but I recently started doing
        something new and my times and confidence have improved as a result. I
        have picked a typical solve and then repeated it over and over. For
        example the first one I picked I did a pretty slow 37 seconds the first
        time I solved it but as I learned the solve I got it down to 17 seconds
        (I'm pretty sure I can go faster). I didn't really do it as an exercise
        - I was just amazed by two things recently - one was Chris estimating a
        solve time if he turns at 3.5 moves a second and the other was that
        11.52 video. I just didn't believe that I could turn the cube that
        smoothly and quickly even if I knew the solve. Now I know I can and also
        I know what it feels like to solve that quickly. I have found that in my
        normal solves I am looking ahead better and turning more accurately and
        quickly. I remember that someone suggested this some time ago as a way
        of working out how fast your method could be if you got really good at
        it. Anyway for those of us who think sub 20 seconds is a dream then I'd
        recommend trying it. Good luck Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From:

        Hey Duncan, just to throw in my two cents, I think that is a really good
        cubing exercise to do, it especially helps show at which steps you tend
        to delay. I never got as fast as some of the others I saw who posted
        averages like that on here, but I remember getting 14-15 second averages
        by doing the same solve for each solve of the average :-) Also, in my
        defense I did mention that I think it would be possible to average
        really really fast with ZB at roughly 3.5 turns per second (which seems
        reasonable based on the level of cubers out there right now), but that
        implies possibly years of practice, or at least solves where your
        recognition is phenomenally fast. I don't forsee a non-lucky 10-11
        second solve anywhere in my near future with ZB, though I hope to get
        there one day ;-) Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        first one I picked I did a pretty slow 37 seconds the first time &gt; I
        solved it but as I learned the solve I got it down to 17 seconds (I'm
        &gt; pretty sure I can go faster). &gt; &gt; I didn't really do it as an
        exercise - I was just amazed by two things &gt; recently - one was Chris
        estimating a solve time if he turns at 3.5 moves a &gt; second and the
        other was that 11.52 video. I just didn't believe that I &gt; could turn
        the cube that smoothly and quickly even if I knew the solve. Now &gt; I
        know I can and also I know what it feels like to solve that quickly.
        &gt; &gt; I have found that in my normal solves I am looking ahead
        better and turning &gt; more accurately and quickly. I remember that
        someone suggested this some &gt; time ago as a way of working out how
        fast your method could be if you got &gt; really good at it. &gt; &gt;
        Anyway for those of us who think sub 20 seconds is a dream then I'd &gt;
        recommend trying it. &gt; &gt; Good luck &gt; &gt; Duncan

        We have not written any rules about substance abuse and performance
        enhancing drugs in speed cubing. If people start using steroids or other
        narcotics, it would not be hard to write a rule. Actually, I was
        thinking about this as well. Bug Selig, the Commissioner of baseball
        here in the United States, wants to make harsher penalties for steroid
        use in baseball. I hate steroids a lot but what if there's a false
        positive? If there's a false positive and someone gets 10 days, it's not
        so bad. But if it's a false positive and they get 50 day suspension,
        that's kind of bad isn't it? Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        Hey! AFAIK there is no mention about this in the WCA rules. So in short
        it's allowed :-) This reminds me that using headphones was also

        If you use ear plugs and you get disqualified because you don't hear the
        judge, then it's your fault. Same with head phones. The WCA naturally
        does not support the use of performance enhancing drugs and if it does

        Then you would have the implications around issues of confidentiality.

        just throwing in my thoughts on the ear plugs debate... I did use ear
        plugs during the French Champs to help me relax, twice during the 1st
        roud, it didn't pay, because i did a wonderful 22.22 and a great 28.xx
        on these solves (yeah i know, shut up everyone) and at least 3 times
        during the 2nd and final round. It did help me then: 15.54 on the first
        solve, then I forgot my discman during the next 2 solves (3 solves
        actually, I poped one inbetween) and got a 17 and an 18 on the last 2
        solves w/ headphones. I don't think i missed something the judge said,
        the music wasn't too loud anyway. Shostakovich, preludes and fugues
        op.87 :-P. There was even a bit of me focusing with the headphones on

        The only drugs that would probably help, might be some stimulants, or
        the kind of you would find in herbal teas. I can't really see how
        steroids would be an issue, or that they would provide an advantage
        anyway. It'd be like using steroids to win a chess match. Most of the
        top cubers are limited not by twisting speed, but by how well you can
        follow the state of teh cube. Robin Williams Live on Broadway, "They
        took away his olympic medal from the candian skier, because he tested
        positive for Marijuana, which is kind of redundant anyway. They called
        it a performance enhancing drug. Now, marijuana enhances many things,
        feelings, colors, sensations, but you're certainly not f***ing

        Chris found a bug in JNetCube where the first three moves of either a
        4x4x4 or 5x5x5 scramble may have two moves that *cancel* each other out,
        effectively making the scramble one move shorter then it should be. It
        turns out I had an 'AND' where there should have been an 'OR'. An honest

        Hi friends, Yes, registration is still required in Florida, but that is
        to know that you are there, check the events that you want to compete in
        and receive your badge and goodie. You really have to register before
        the championship! Depending on the number of registrations we may need
        to close registration for some events. Of course we won't send you home
        if you come from far without registering. :-) We do expect many
        competitors, so without preregistration we cannot make a good time
        schedule. It is going to be fun!!!! Don't miss it! &gt;From Amsterdam I
        found tickets to Orlando for 300 euro. Hotel rooms for $69 is pretty
        cheap, and you can share hotel rooms (probably 3 people per room). You
        can use this forum to find people to share a room with. :-) Have fun,

        Hey Peter, It has been brought to my attention that a black and white
        cube mix would provide an unfair advantage to the solver because you
        would have an advantage of recognizing certain pieces. Therefore, the
        plastic of your cubes needs to all be the same color. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        I had written this timer about a month ago for my personal timer. About
        a week ago Leyan in the blindsolving group asked about a timer that
        would keep up with the stages of his blindfold solves. I volunteered to
        take that up. This version doesn't include that yet but is in the works.
        The current version generates shuffles for 2x2x2 through the 5x5x5. It
        stores all data in an access database. I have generated a few reports
        that will give you some statistical data. The file is slightly large, 8
        Meg, due to the use of Crystal Reports for statistical data. It can be
        be found at my site at www.rubikspuzzles.com. It will be listed on the
        right under the Files heading. Also, don't laugh at my slow solve
        videos. I'm old and not a super speedcuber like a lot of you.

        register for WC 2005. Well, it specifically states that members need

        Registration is still &gt; &gt; required in Florida, so I would assume

        Hi there. Using a layer approach with a 4 look last layer, I managed a
        pair of 30 second solves to start with. It wasn't particularly easy, but
        I employed a trick I know to permute and orient the corners at the same
        time. I average a tad under 30 like this, so I wasn't too impressed with
        how I solved it. My third time was a 24. Not bad, I thought. By the time
        I'd finished an average with that scramble, I'd managed a solve under
        17. I kept going like this for a while, enjoying seeing 1X.XX on the
        timer. Eventually I got curious and solved a new scramble. I got my
        personal fastest time of 21.16. If I could reach, Duncan, I'd give you a
        hug. I'll check back in after some more of this practicing. -Mike

        worn, you can tell where they are by feeling. If you have tiles on your
        cube, you're already guilty. They overlap the sides to the point you can
        see around the edges of pieces. If you're going to disqualify cubes with
        mixed pieces, it's unfair to allow cubes with anything other than
        perfect stickers and uniformly tensioned sides, and that seems
        unnecessary. The last time I checked, WCA rules stipulated something
        about no modifications to the basic shape or mechanism of the puzzle,
        but nothing was mentioned of the pieces' colors. I think mixed should be
        allowed. It would lead to an advantage, possibly, but so does learning
        COLL for those who are crazy enough =). Just my two cents. -Mike Bennett

        Black and White cubes mixed This is what I thought. But Does not
        everyone have this same chance to do this. So if I can do this, why not
        everyone. no real advantage. But I am just asking. I am actually

        Hi Tyson, I think you over-reacted, changing your mind so quickly. Four
        reasons: 1.) I have been thinking that a cube with black centers and
        corners and white edges, and vice versa, would look really cool. It
        wouldn't give an advantage either. 2.) I also thought of having all the
        LL cubies white, because it would look cool. I have no problem
        recognising LL positions and the white wouldn't be an advantage to me,
        but if it enabled other cubers to recognise positions with ease I would
        have no problem with that. 3.) I thought of having certain specific
        cubies white and the rest of the cube black. That might give enable me
        to see some F2L things better, but not be an advantage over others
        because others don't solve the F2L like I do. :) 4.) Eventually we all
        may have cubes tailored to our tastes with no stickers or tiles but the
        plastic itself colored. (I am suggesting here a new line for Rubik's.com
        to pursue.) Anyway, please reconsider, if only for one of the reasons
        stated. Thanks, David J --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; G'day, I haven't ported on here since I signed up but anyway.. &gt;
        I tried download your timer but it didn't work, all I've managed to &gt;
        do is save the page that comes up when I clicked on the link for it.
        &gt; What do I do next? I just posted the MSI which is a windows
        installer file. You should have windows installer already but if not
        goto
        http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=CEBBACD8-C094-4255-B702-DE3BB768148F
        and download it there. It's for 95-ME. 2000 and XP should have
        everything you need included. If you still have issues, I will look into
        making a setup.exe instead.

        I do think mixed cubes would give some people an advantage. One of my
        methods I use the "first layer minus working corner method" for F2L, and
        I know that making all the first layer cubies white, or the middle layer
        edges white, would definitely give me an advantage for recognition. As
        far as everyone being open to the same advantage I guess that true. But
        it's still a little unfair. Not everyone has access to the internet to
        get the white cubes, or is old enough to buy something online without
        help from a parent, or whatever. As far as feeling damaged stickers go,
        that's harder to control, but has always been a part of tournaments. The
        white-cubie thing is new. And there's no reason to nip the problem in
        the bud right away. And besides don't tournaments often provide new
        stickers to resticker your cube if you want to? But aside from all that
        I think there's a more important reason to not allow mixed cubes. It
        changes solving the cube on a small but fundamental level. As the cubies
        exist now, they're black with colored stickers. Recognition is done by
        the sticker color alone. Adding certain cubies with different colors now
        makes two types of cubie recognition. A small, but I think significant,
        differance in the existing cube- solving process. The line has to be
        drawn SOMEWHERE. It might as well be here, while it's still an easy line
        to be drawn.

        Hi friends, I think article 3 of the WCA regulations (see
        http://www.speedcubing.com/events ) prohibits this. "No modifications
        are allowed that enhance the basic concept of the puzzle. Puzzles may
        not have any textures or markings that distinguish one piece from
        another." And I think it is a good thing, that it is not allowed. You
        could have a 5 color cube, where each corner edge pair has different
        color of the two pieces. It is also not allowed to have small stickers
        at the edge of each piece, to see what color is on the other side of
        that piece. Our goal is to have fun in tournaments, and to make sure the
        best cuber in competition conditions wins. Our goal is not to go faster
        by changing rules in our favor. Apart from the rules, I think if we
        would be on tv, people would consider us cheating. They expect to see
        normal cubes. I am purist. And proud of it. Normal cubes rule! Have fun,

        &gt; Hi Tyson, &gt; &gt; I think you over-reacted, changing your mind so
        quickly. Four reasons: &gt; &gt; 1.) I have been thinking that a cube
        with black centers and corners &gt; and white edges, and vice versa,
        would look really cool. It wouldn't &gt; give an advantage either. &gt;
        &gt; 2.) I also thought of having all the LL cubies white, because it
        would &gt; look cool. I have no problem recognising LL positions and the
        white &gt; wouldn't be an advantage to me, but if it enabled other
        cubers to &gt; recognise positions with ease I would have no problem
        with that. &gt; &gt; 3.) I thought of having certain specific cubies
        white and the rest of &gt; the cube black. That might give enable me to
        see some F2L things &gt; better, but not be an advantage over others
        because others don't solve &gt; the F2L like I do. :) &gt; &gt; 4.)
        Eventually we all may have cubes tailored to our tastes with no &gt;
        stickers or tiles but the plastic itself colored. (I am suggesting &gt;
        here a new line for Rubik's.com to pursue.) &gt; &gt; Anyway, please
        reconsider, if only for one of the reasons stated. &gt; &gt; Thanks,

        Hello! I´ve been following this thread from the start and there have
        been good arguments both ways. I agree that a cube with different color
        cubies would make recognition easier, but on the other hand a two
        color-cubie cube (that sounded fun =D) would look cool. So why not make
        yourself this modified cube to have as a cool new toy and use it for
        practice. With time recognition would become so natural that the
        different colored cubies wouldn´t be needed anymore. As Ron already
        stated the rules, if read carefully, already prohibit the use of such a
        cube in competition. This is the way I think it should be in the future
        also. After all the competition is much more than just fast times. What
        is more important is to meet fellow cubers and have fun. Keep cubing,

        the Toronto WC. They appear to place all corners first and then solve
        left and right edges in pairs. They apparently have a very efficient way
        of solving the edges to be able to manage sub-20 times. I can avg 22-23
        by using a similar method except I solve top and bottom edges instead of
        left and right. Wayne --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        So I just applied for what is called highschool summer college at
        stanford. It needs this entire application with an essay and all that
        fun stuff. The essay prompt was "Tell us about a significant event in
        your life. How did this event change you, or make you view your life in
        a different light?" Of course, I wrote an essay about the Rubik's cube.
        So here it is for anyone who would like to read. Life Lessons^3 The
        following began on the night of November 19th 2003. I was at my
        grandmother's house for my cousin's 17th birthday. The atmosphere was
        cheery; the room was loud, as it often is when the whole family is
        together. Getting distracted from the event at hand, I decided to take
        part in a little sibling rivalry. My brother and I took turns on my
        grandmother's stationary bike, watching the RPM, seeing who could go
        faster. When we got to the hands only category (as the bike had moving
        handlebars which could be used in place of the pedals) my brother pushed
        and pulled his way to 73 RPM. Then it was my turn. I hopped on and
        started up. As my arms pumped like pistons, the RPM meter rose. The
        speed shot up to 20, 30, 40, 50 RPM and continued to rise up past 60,
        70, 80 RPM. At 93 RPM, disaster struck. Due to the torque of my upper
        body as I fought with the handles, my bare right foot slipped, and fell
        into the path of the pedal. The pedal struck my heel and violently
        jammed my toes into the foot peg. A trip to the emergency room revealed
        a broken foot, and broken hopes of playing football any more that
        season. To the untrained observer, this event may seem to be an act of
        stupidity followed by the deserved punishment. But in actuality this
        event started me on my most intriguing journey to date. A day or two
        later, while surfing the web and chatting with friends, I came across a
        video of someone not only solving the Rubik's cube, but doing so in
        under 20 seconds. I have a profound interest in mathematics and computer
        science, so the idea of the world's greatest puzzle intrigued me, and I
        followed up by getting a Rubik's cube of my own. Sadly, I followed the
        path of most first time cubists, and got fed up with the cube after a
        couple of days. After a quick search on Google, I found a couple simple
        and a couple not-so-simple solutions to the Rubik's cube online. I added
        the sites to my favorites, and then went to sleep for the night. The
        next day was a school football game. Because I was confined to the bench
        for the rest of the season, I brought my cube along for the twelve hour
        journey. During this time I began to understand the basics of the
        Rubik's cube. I became highly proficient at following the directions on
        how to solve the cube. After a day or two more, I was solving the cube
        without the aid of an instruction sheet, taking about three minutes to
        do so. The addiction had begun. From that day until the present I have
        been on a never ending quest for speed, learning more algorithms (sets
        of moves which produce a desired effect on the Rubik's cube) and
        different solutions, working my way up. I have attended several official
        Rubik's cube competitions, including the 2004 US national championships,
        in which I placed 15th out of the 47 cubists who attended. Currently my
        personal best time is 17.63 seconds. Now as if one time and life
        consuming hobby isn't enough fun, try combining it with another. This
        was the basic theory behind my 2004 science project. I'm fanatical about
        the Rubik's cube, passionate about programming, and fervent about
        robotics. So what type of diabolical scheme can you come up with that
        combines all three? That's right, the world's fastest Rubik's cube
        solving robot. My inspiration came from another video I had recently
        seen. Originally, I was planning on building a robot with the same basic
        design as in the video, but I wasn't content with the speed, or lack
        thereof, at which this design solved the Rubik's cube; I didn't want to
        be able to beat my own robot. So I went about designing something
        radically different and ended up with an 18 inch Plexiglas cube that
        looks like something out of Star Trek. The robot controlled my life for
        about two months, over the course of which I wrote the code for it,
        built it, and tuned it into a lean mean cube solving machine. It can now
        beat the current world record holder and averages only 11.46 seconds per
        solve. The robot took me to the California State Science Fair, and is
        unofficially the fastest cube solving robot in the world, as there has
        not yet been an official event for robots. In the end, I was able to
        turn a negative experience into a positive one. I set a goal for myself,
        pursued it, and enjoyed the journey as well as the destination. Although
        I have not become the fastest in the world, my robot has, and I can
        solve the Rubik's cube more quickly than I ever thought possible.
        Parents always preach persistence, hard work, dedication, and never
        using gym equipment without shoes. But until you experience the reward,
        until you understand the satisfaction that comes with the long hard
        hours of determination, you cannot truly appreciate these lessons. That
        is what this experience did for me. I now know how to go about solving a
        problem. I now understand what it feels like to take on something of
        this magnitude. And furthermore, I know how it feels to accomplish a
        daunting task, and it is that feeling that drives me.

        Hmm ... Are u really serious Stefan? How would u go about with that?
        What should the rules be like? How would handicapped for instance w no
        hands or feet be able to do the cube? And i guess that for obvious
        reasons 99% of those won't have any interest in doing cubing anyway. It
        could be that u are ironic ;-) Handicapped tournaments for ppl who can
        cube normally are easy to set up. One can compare times achieved with
        that persons normal (best) average and work out according to some simple

        Yes really a great timer! I especially liked the show progress
        function...its really helpful to me. And yes one more thing, you have
        said that you have no problem with copying and stuff, so can you please
        post the source code for the timer? so i(or whoever else)can make
        changes to it easily rather than burdening you for them. something like

        the night of November 19th 2003. I &gt; was at my grandmother's house
        for my cousin's 17th birthday. The &gt; atmosphere was cheery; the room
        was loud, as it often is when the &gt; whole family is together. Getting
        distracted from the event at &gt; hand, I decided to take part in a
        little sibling rivalry. My &gt; brother and I took turns on my
        grandmother's stationary bike, &gt; watching the RPM, seeing who could
        go faster. When we got to the &gt; hands only category (as the bike had
        moving handlebars which could &gt; be used in place of the pedals) my
        brother pushed and pulled his way &gt; to 73 RPM. Then it was my turn. I
        hopped on and started up. As my &gt; arms pumped like pistons, the RPM
        meter rose. The speed shot up to &gt; 20, 30, 40, 50 RPM and continued
        to rise up past 60, 70, 80 RPM. At &gt; 93 RPM, disaster struck. Due to
        the torque of my upper body as I &gt; fought with the handles, my bare
        right foot slipped, and fell into &gt; the path of the pedal. The pedal
        struck my heel and violently &gt; jammed my toes into the foot peg. &gt;
        A trip to the emergency room revealed a broken foot, and &gt; broken
        hopes of playing football any more that season. To the &gt; untrained
        observer, this event may seem to be an act of stupidity &gt; followed by
        the deserved punishment. But in actuality this event &gt; started me on
        my most intriguing journey to date. &gt; A day or two later, while
        surfing the web and chatting with &gt; friends, I came across a video of
        someone not only solving the &gt; Rubik's cube, but doing so in under 20
        seconds. I have a profound &gt; interest in mathematics and computer
        science, so the idea of the &gt; world's greatest puzzle intrigued me,
        and I followed up by getting a &gt; Rubik's cube of my own. Sadly, I
        followed the path of most first &gt; time cubists, and got fed up with
        the cube after a couple of days. &gt; After a quick search on Google, I
        found a couple simple and a couple &gt; not-so-simple solutions to the
        Rubik's cube online. I added the &gt; sites to my favorites, and then
        went to sleep for the night. &gt; The next day was a school football
        game. Because I was &gt; confined to the bench for the rest of the
        season, I brought my cube &gt; along for the twelve hour journey. During
        this time I began to &gt; understand the basics of the Rubik's cube. I
        became highly &gt; proficient at following the directions on how to
        solve the cube. &gt; After a day or two more, I was solving the cube
        without the aid of &gt; an instruction sheet, taking about three minutes
        to do so. The &gt; addiction had begun. &gt; From that day until the
        present I have been on a never &gt; ending quest for speed, learning
        more algorithms (sets of moves &gt; which produce a desired effect on
        the Rubik's cube) and different &gt; solutions, working my way up. I
        have attended several official &gt; Rubik's cube competitions, including
        the 2004 US national &gt; championships, in which I placed 15th out of
        the 47 cubists who &gt; attended. Currently my personal best time is
        17.63 seconds. &gt; Now as if one time and life consuming hobby isn't
        enough &gt; fun, try combining it with another. This was the basic
        theory &gt; behind my 2004 science project. I'm fanatical about the
        Rubik's &gt; cube, passionate about programming, and fervent about
        robotics. So &gt; what type of diabolical scheme can you come up with
        that combines &gt; all three? That's right, the world's fastest Rubik's
        cube solving &gt; robot. My inspiration came from another video I had
        recently seen. &gt; Originally, I was planning on building a robot with
        the same basic &gt; design as in the video, but I wasn't content with
        the speed, or lack &gt; thereof, at which this design solved the Rubik's
        cube; I didn't want &gt; to be able to beat my own robot. So I went
        about designing &gt; something radically different and ended up with an
        18 inch Plexiglas &gt; cube that looks like something out of Star Trek.
        The robot &gt; controlled my life for about two months, over the course
        of which I &gt; wrote the code for it, built it, and tuned it into a
        lean mean cube &gt; solving machine. It can now beat the current world
        record holder &gt; and averages only 11.46 seconds per solve. The robot
        took me to the &gt; California State Science Fair, and is unofficially
        the fastest cube &gt; solving robot in the world, as there has not yet
        been an official &gt; event for robots. &gt; In the end, I was able to
        turn a negative experience into a &gt; positive one. I set a goal for
        myself, pursued it, and enjoyed the &gt; journey as well as the
        destination. Although I have not become the &gt; fastest in the world,
        my robot has, and I can solve the Rubik's cube &gt; more quickly than I
        ever thought possible. Parents always preach &gt; persistence, hard
        work, dedication, and never using gym equipment &gt; without shoes. But
        until you experience the reward, until you &gt; understand the
        satisfaction that comes with the long hard hours of &gt; determination,
        you cannot truly appreciate these lessons. That is &gt; what this
        experience did for me. I now know how to go about solving &gt; a
        problem. I now understand what it feels like to take on something &gt;
        of this magnitude. And furthermore, I know how it feels to &gt;
        accomplish a daunting task, and it is that feeling that drives me.

        Only problem with it is the grid control control I had to purchase and
        had a license key which means nobody else could compile without the same
        control. I might convert that the the microsoft data grid though so that
        won't be an issue. Other problem is I have written most of it on the fly

        Hi Ron, The black plastic DIY cubes have arched centers and don't pop
        and are adjustable. The white plastic cubes have slicker plastic and
        look cool, however they have flat centers and pop a lot. So if I want an
        adjustable white cube that doesn't pop I *have* to have a black plastic
        center piece. I was displeased that the white DIY cubes I got were from
        the older model. I complained but no response. So I sent off for 2 black
        DIY kits so I could have arched centers on the whte cubes, and have good
        fast white cube which doesn't pop... ...and now you and Tyson tell me
        that cube is illegal. Thanks, but no thanks. Of course if a certain
        company made white plastic arched centers there'd be no problem. But
        that's not very likely seeing that I got *no* positive response to my
        complaint. David J --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Ron

        cube mix &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Tyson, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think you
        over-reacted, changing your mind so quickly. Four reasons: &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; 1.) I have been thinking that a cube with black centers and
        corners &gt; &gt; and white edges, and vice versa, would look really
        cool. It wouldn't &gt; &gt; give an advantage either. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 2.) I also thought of having all the LL cubies white, because it
        would &gt; &gt; look cool. I have no problem recognising LL positions
        and the white &gt; &gt; wouldn't be an advantage to me, but if it
        enabled other cubers to &gt; &gt; recognise positions with ease I would
        have no problem with that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3.) I thought of having
        certain specific cubies white and the rest of &gt; &gt; the cube black.
        That might give enable me to see some F2L things &gt; &gt; better, but
        not be an advantage over others because others don't solve &gt; &gt; the
        F2L like I do. :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4.) Eventually we all may have
        cubes tailored to our tastes with no &gt; &gt; stickers or tiles but the
        plastic itself colored. (I am suggesting &gt; &gt; here a new line for
        Rubik's.com to pursue.) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, please reconsider,
        if only for one of the reasons stated. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, &gt;

        I don't think you should be so quick to blame the cube. There are two
        factors that go into popping. The first is, yes, the cube. Certain cubes
        pop more easily than others. However, the second factor is the cuber. If
        you're accurate with your turns, then you can turn it as hard as you
        want and you won't pop. This principle is illustrated when I was cubing
        in front of Macky and jamming on a bunch of turns. Macky turns to me,
        says, "You need to work on your accuracy," grabs my cube, and then
        proceeds to make a billion turns on the cube smoothly without jamming at
        all. If the purpose of the white plastic cube is just to look cube and
        it has a negative impact on your cubing performance, why don't you just
        go with a black cube? Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        and the white &gt;&gt;&gt; wouldn't be an advantage to me, but if it
        enabled other cubers to &gt;&gt;&gt; recognise positions with ease I
        would have no problem with that. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 3.) I thought
        of having certain specific cubies white and the rest of &gt;&gt;&gt; the
        cube black. That might give enable me to see some F2L things
        &gt;&gt;&gt; better, but not be an advantage over others because others
        don't &gt;&gt;&gt; solve &gt;&gt;&gt; the F2L like I do. :) &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; 4.) Eventually we all may have cubes tailored to our tastes
        with no &gt;&gt;&gt; stickers or tiles but the plastic itself colored.
        (I am suggesting &gt;&gt;&gt; here a new line for Rubik's.com to

        for one of the reasons stated. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,

        Hi folks, The tournament at Horace Mann School in Riverdale, New York is
        coming up on Saturday, May 28th. We've got some really fast people
        coming (Macky, Chris H, Ryan Patricio, Tyson) and we're doing a bunch of
        different events (2x2, 3x3, 4x4, magic, rainbow cube, square-1,
        blindfold, one-handed, and maybe fewest moves). The tournament is an
        official one so we might have some new records at day's end! After the
        tournament, everyone is invited to a barbecue (BBQube?) at my house
        which is 10 minutes from the venue. The school is only 3 blocks from the
        subway and that Monday is Memorial Day so if you ever needed an excuse
        to visit New York City and do some sightseeing, this is it! I've been
        looking around for some suitable hotels and I've found a couple that are
        relatively cheap and are only a 10 minute drive from the venue. If you
        won't have a car, a taxi ride shouldn't be too expensive. Holiday Inn
        (914) 476-3800 125 Tuckahoe Rd Yonkers, NY 10710 Royal Regency Hotel
        914-476-6200 165 Tuckahoe Rd Yonkers, NY 10710 E-mail me (iwinoky@...)
        if you have any questions or if you want to register. There's info about
        the venue at http://home.manhattan.edu/~ian.winokur/CubeTournament.html
        I hope to see a bunch of you there! Ian Winokur

        Hi! I think this can be resolved quite easily. Use the black arched
        centers, but use the centercaps from the white diy cube. Nobody will be
        able to tell that the cube ain't "all white". Well unless someone
        disassembles it. And even do noone can claim u have a color advantage
        from it. Just a trivially easy idea ;-) -Per &gt; --- In

        have a 5 color cube, where each corner edge pair has &gt; different &gt;

        white edges, and vice versa, would look really cool. It wouldn't &gt;
        &gt; &gt; give an advantage either. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.) I

        Hi, Your timer is my new favourite and I like it a lot. Here are some
        suggestions on further improvements though: *Delete/Change time without
        the need of MS Access *Add 2 sec penalty option/button *Some additional
        statistics like standard deviation and median *Be able to show times
        over time as line graph in progression. Would be nice to have both for
        solve times and averages, and maybe also one where only improved
        averages are shown. (my first average made on 2005-05-08 and new points
        in the line graph are only added for better averages.) Thank you /Gustav

        to allow &gt; users to add their own puzzles. &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe it's
        a better idea to call the 'shuffle' a 'scramble' &gt; &gt; Done &gt;
        &gt; &gt; it would be nice to have an: 'add time' button, so I can use
        it &gt; &gt; in combination with my stackmat. Or maybe even a &gt; &gt;
        "countdown+add time" option, because my stackmat won't do the &gt; &gt;
        countdown for me :). &gt; &gt; Both Done &gt; &gt; Now what would be to
        add to the stackmat feature would be to read the &gt; time directly from
        the stackmat. There was a post just a few days ago &gt; about this.

        Hmmm ... Why don't they simply offer a 5x5x5 diy-kit with some spare
        parts and a choice of rivets or screws, just like they have for the
        3x3x3. Shouldn't be much of a problem to do that. And to be honest i
        think they would see the sales of the professor cube increase quite a
        bit. Many prefer the mefferts variant or eastsheen due to it's well
        known initial stiffness. A 5x5x5 rubiks.com diy-kit seems like a perfect
        idea to me :-) As a sidenote a 4x4x4 diy-kit does not seem to be much
        point. The only reason would be if we could glue those core parts
        together ourselves. That is kinda risky, but at least one can avoid some
        of the bad cores that i have seen with skewness and/or elevation. An
        almost perfect core is highly essential for a good 4x4x4 for speeding.

        Hey everybody, I am not sure if this post will be usefull for my, but
        I'll try anyway :). I think I have found a pretty nice area of
        improvement for me. When DanH was visiting me a few weeks ago, we had a
        few (a lot, actually) of races, and he would sometimes say when he
        finished the cross, 1st pair, 2nd pair, etc., and I noticed that he was
        much faster during the F2L, but I would usually catch up during the LL
        phase.. Both ending with about the same time. (sometimes, when he was
        solving F2L really fast, I thought, 'oh well, he's just saying that :)',
        remember Dan? ;)). Anyway, today, I timed my F2L and LL (without OLL
        regognition) seperately, and I think I barely average sub 10 for the
        F2L. Maybe around 11 seconds, but around 6 seconds for the last layer
        (just estimating, I didnt make notes yet.. maybe I should). Do any
        cubers here have tips to really speed up that F2L? I think I know most
        shortcuts, but maybe I have to cut out some cube rotations that I do
        automatically. But how can I train this? Does anyone else here recognize
        the same 'weak spot'? -Joël.

        Ya I also have the same problem, albeit on a much larger scale. Usually
        my times for F2L are around 45 - 60 seconds. And I also see a lot of
        improvement possible in this area for me. Really would appreciate if
        anyone gives some tips for speeding that up. Maybe these times could be
        in part due to a very bad cube that i get here, but i think my technique
        is also bad. Someday i will reach sub-60 :) --- Joï¿½l van Noort

        OK. So I went back and read the two threads "rubiks with lights?", from
        2002, and "Pretty Crazy Cube Idea", from 2004, and it got me thinking ;)
        I have to do a Computer Sciece capstone in about two years and, instead
        of making a cube-solving robot ;) , I want to make the cube that Evan
        and some other people were talking about in earlier threads. My brother,
        dad, and I are doing some research right now to try and figure out the
        best components to use for this thing. We have already dropped the idea
        of using wires and are considering possible metal contacts between
        cubies. I'm not sure how difficult this is going to be...but it CAN BE
        DONE!! ;) For those of you who haven't read the above threads, the main
        idea here is to make a rubik's cube that uses lights (LEDs?), instead of
        stickers, for color. Since the whole cube is electric, it will also be
        able to scramble itself via a button on some center face or something
        like that. I might build it using a 'large' 3x3x3 first, but maybe not.
        The hardest part about this project is going to be the hardware
        engineering. I'm pretty sure the software will be easy to write. Let me
        know if any one of you bright engineers have ideas for getting this
        done. I have two years ;) -Chris

        Hey! I think the basic feature which is needed is simply MEMORY. Ie the
        robot must do it's thinking not solely based on current state of it's
        sensors but also past history of the sensors. A few intermediate sensors
        btw one cubestate and the next (while doing a faceturn) would help
        identify what has happened to the cube and will correctly identify the
        next current state. Well something like this anyway. Haven't thought
        about it much yet. And though this would be cool my personal opinion is
        that is's much cooler to have a robot twist a normal cube like Evan's
        robot does. That way "computerworld" and real world combines to a great

        Hey! No i didn't miss the point. It's already far too late and im here
        at uni. OK a robot is not necessarily a physical robot like in Robocop

        cube/program/robot (whatever!) is in will make sure that the correct
        LED's are lit up at each external cubie face. The state-space is

        you mean by "robot". This is a design where the cube is still solved as
        normal, by a human, but the colors of each cubie are displayed with LEDs
        rather then stickers. The only 'thinking' would take place when the cube
        randomly changes the LED colors to make a valid scramble.

        well i wouldn't say that i am a fast cuber and all (about 18 seconds for
        f2l) but noticed a few improvements when i solve it. i solve f2l with a
        cross on the bottom and most of the f2l algorithms requires you to do a
        U2 turn and usually i take two moves U, U. i think i could improve my
        f2l times if i could eliminate the two moves and do one. so i tried to
        solve the f2l on the side.. at first it was kinda awkward... but it
        seems like i could move the U2 face into on move since it was now used
        for my right hand.. i think trying out side f2l maybe slightly easier
        for me, only because i take two moves for the U2. --- In

        fast, I thought, 'oh well, he's just saying &gt; that :)', &gt; remember
        Dan? ;)). Anyway, today, I timed my F2L and &gt; LL (without OLL &gt;
        regognition) seperately, and I think I barely average &gt; sub 10 for
        the &gt; F2L. Maybe around 11 seconds, but around 6 seconds for &gt; the
        last &gt; layer (just estimating, I didnt make notes yet.. maybe &gt; I
        should). &gt; &gt; Do any cubers here have tips to really speed up that
        &gt; F2L? I think I &gt; know most shortcuts, but maybe I have to cut

        Ah, ok... I thought you meant the cube would turn itself and even solve
        itself (what else would it need to "think" about?). That would be cool,
        though. Then we could really throw it in the air and it solves itself.
        Or imagine you scramble it, put it on the table and it slowly moves,
        solving itself. Like those pianos that play themselves where it looks
        like there's an invisible ghost playing... Cheers :-) Stefan --- In

        No it's not true. I ordered 2 through rubiks.com a few weeks ago and am
        not too happy with them. I just got a regular cube at Meijer today and
        like it. I believe new cubes shouldn't be so loose. Stiffer smoother
        cubes will produce better results in the end once they are worn in.
        Speaking of which, I haven't had a good speedcube for a long time. (Keep
        losing them on the bus.) I am wondering if there's someone out there who
        is willing to make me one. I'm of course willing to spend $100-$200 for
        a good speedcube. It would have to be severly modded to my liking
        though... putting in special washers, perfect tension, solid stickers, a
        different color scheme,...., etc. The 25th aniversary cubes came
        packaged very nicely, but they had the old style of stickers that peeled
        very easily. It took me about 1-2 weeks to wear-out the stickers as
        usual. Solving 300 times a day might do that.... -Doug --- In

        Hi! I really recommend the rubiks.com diy kit. After adjusting mine on
        the day i got it i haven't had to do anything since. It's turning really
        well for me. Some say that it's a good idea to chenge the springs on
        them. I wouldn't know cause i never tried it. Anyway with screws instead
        of rivets it's fairly easy to adjust to ur own liking. U can also make a
        hybrid diy (i haven't tried it) with cubies from the white diy and the
        arched centers from black diy. Then put the white centercaps on the
        centers instead of the black ones. U will need to glue the centercaps on
        so dun use too much glue and complete ur tension adjustments before
        gluing!! Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        have washers, their spring length/strength are ok (could be slightly
        softer but not necessary), the spring ends are somewhat ground (not
        perfect, but at least a bit) and perhaps most importantly their screws
        are great. The thread is only near the end, i.e. the upper part is flat
        and thus can't lock up with the spring. And most importantly the screw
        head has a large diameter, larger than the center hole. This way, how
        far you can pull a center from the kernel spider is not limited by the
        spring compressed to maximum (where it reaches maximum strength), but by
        the screw head, and the spring is not compressed fully and thus appears
        to be less strong. I haven't tried the white DIYs with their original
        springs (instead I immediately used others) but I'd guess they're ok,
        too, because of the large screw head. Cheers! Stefan

        Interesting. Have you tried to achieve this same limiting effect with a
        large washer between (small) screwhead and spring? (Am looking for a
        quick fix, as the only spare springs I have are as strong as those
        already in the Studio cube.) In fact it ought to be possible to get any
        tension you want by combining with washers at the opposite end of the
        spring. Might try it anyway... Mike

        blame the cube. I blame Seven Towns. They know very well that the flat

        tightly. Those are the very reasons why they went to arches for their
        main production runs. They know as well as I do that the flat centers
        are no treat for speedcubers. &gt; There are two &gt; factors that go
        into popping. The first is, yes, the cube. Certain &gt; cubes pop more
        easily than others. However, the second factor is the &gt; cuber. If
        you're accurate with your turns, then you can turn it as &gt; hard as
        you want and you won't pop. This principle is illustrated when &gt; I
        was cubing in front of Macky and jamming on a bunch of turns. Macky &gt;
        turns to me, says, "You need to work on your accuracy," grabs my cube,
        &gt; and then proceeds to make a billion turns on the cube smoothly
        without &gt; jamming at all. Do you remember that I had several cubes
        with me at last years Nationals? Yes, I used two flat center cubes
        during the 10 cube no-inspection solves and solved them without popping,
        but they slowed me down. I agree that accuracy helps, but not entirely,
        not even with Macky. And at one point that day Macky tried my best flat
        center speedcube and it literally exploded all over the place on about
        his tenth turn. &gt; If the purpose of the white plastic cube is just to
        look cube and it &gt; has a negative impact on your cubing performance,
        why don't you just go &gt; with a black cube? The purpose isn't just to
        look good - the white plastic is slicker. Regards, David J &gt; Tyson

        *sigh* I know it's a matter of economy also. They might eventually
        listen to complaints/recommendations. I'm not sure they understand that
        the diy kits are almost solely bought by speedcubers. So they should do
        these small things by themselves. For both white/black diy kits they
        could provide 2 types of centers, flat and arched. And also include the
        normal vinyl replacement stickers, not the crap laminated ones. Though i
        must admit that the laminated ones that came with my diy- kit are not
        all that bad. Much better than the ones on 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. But it's
        still laminated, so the edges of them dun look all that great after a
        while. And i hope also they pick up in my idea about 5x5x5 diy-kit.
        That'd be really really nice :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        I personally am a big fan of the flat centers because it reduces
        jamming. Macky popped on your cube because he wasn't used to it, not
        because it was chronically prone to popping. As a scrambler for these
        tournaments, you very quickly find out whose cubes are the loosest and
        most easy popping. Frank Chang's cube, for example, is absolutely
        ridiculous and I popped slightly even when scrambling at a slow speed.
        However, Frank can solve that cube in under 20 seconds. I believe that
        with proper control and accuracy, even the loosest cube will not pop. Of
        course, some cubes may actually pop, but I highly doubt this would be
        the case for a new cube that hasn't been worn in. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        achieve this same limiting effect with a &gt; large washer between
        (small) screwhead and spring? (Am looking for a &gt; quick fix, as the
        only spare springs I have are as strong as those &gt; already in the
        Studio cube.) Yes, I've already done that and with very good success,
        but thanks anyway :-) The problem is that this means I can't screw in
        the screw very much, about 2mm less than usual, and the screws keep
        getting unscrewed during play. I could probably fix this with glue but
        I'd hate to use glue. Also, I like the screw to be deep inside the
        kernel spider to have bigger stability. That's why I've ordered very
        weak springs today, so that they're soft even when they're almost
        completely compressed, and then when they're fully compressed they
        suddenly block, achieving the effect I want: Small interval for movement
        but very soft in this interval. I've also started to look for screws
        yesterday. I noticed that the Studio cubes use the same screws as those
        from the early 80s so there's got to be a standard. I'd like to get the
        same screw thread, but only for the lower half of the screw, and flat
        above. Also the screw should be 1.5-2mm longer and it should have a
        large head (or I'd use a large washer again but I'd like to use nylon
        and I don't know how strong it is and I have to take care about screw
        head vs center cap). I've recently prepared some "wonderful puzzler"
        cubes (I think) and they already have perfect screws. That's why I was
        able to turn them into very good cubes easily just by replacing their
        too strong springs (and adding some washers). Cheers! Stefan

        replacing the springs played a major part. The old ones have wire
        diameter 0.6mm or maybe even a bit more and the ends are not ground. Now
        I use 0.5mm springs with ends ground. It makes a huge difference. The
        springs I've now ordered have 0.32mm wire diameter, I hope that'll be
        weak enough. General question: Did anyone study the effects of different
        springs/washers/etc before? If so, I'd like to know anything that's
        known already (springs are much much more expensive than washers ;-)

        &gt; &gt; I am not sure if this post will be usefull for my, but &gt;
        &gt; I'll try &gt; &gt; anyway :). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think I have
        found a pretty nice area of improvement &gt; &gt; for me. When &gt; &gt;
        DanH was visiting me a few weeks ago, we had a few (a &gt; &gt; lot,
        actually) &gt; &gt; of races, and he would sometimes say when he
        finished &gt; &gt; the cross, 1st &gt; &gt; pair, 2nd pair, etc., and I
        noticed that he was much &gt; &gt; faster during &gt; &gt; the F2L, but
        I would usually catch up during the LL &gt; &gt; phase.. Both &gt; &gt;
        ending with about the same time. (sometimes, when he &gt; &gt; was
        solving F2L &gt; &gt; really fast, I thought, 'oh well, he's just saying
        &gt; &gt; that :)', &gt; &gt; remember Dan? ;)). Anyway, today, I timed
        my F2L and &gt; &gt; LL (without OLL &gt; &gt; regognition) seperately,
        and I think I barely average &gt; &gt; sub 10 for the &gt; &gt; F2L.
        Maybe around 11 seconds, but around 6 seconds for &gt; &gt; the last
        &gt; &gt; layer (just estimating, I didnt make notes yet.. maybe &gt;
        &gt; I should). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do any cubers here have tips to
        really speed up that &gt; &gt; F2L? I think I &gt; &gt; know most
        shortcuts, but maybe I have to cut out some &gt; &gt; cube rotations
        &gt; &gt; that I do automatically. But how can I train this? &gt; &gt;
        Does anyone else &gt; &gt; here recognize the same 'weak spot'? &gt;

        and others were too loose. So I used a power drill to drill the heads
        off of the rivets and replaced the kernel with one from a cube from a
        90's Rubik's Cube. Now the cube is the best one in my fleet. I was
        planning on trying this again with another old kernel that I have from a
        4th dimension cube. But I never got around to it. Jon

        can perform U2 just as fast as R2, and I think f2l on bottom is the best
        &gt; &gt; for looking ahead. Instead of using cube rotations, most of
        the time using &gt; &gt; d &gt; &gt; or d' or d2 will do the same thing
        and get one U move closer at the same &gt; &gt; time. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        anyway :). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think I have found a pretty
        nice area of improvement &gt; &gt; &gt; for me. When &gt; &gt; &gt; DanH
        was visiting me a few weeks ago, we had a few (a &gt; &gt; &gt; lot,
        actually) &gt; &gt; &gt; of races, and he would sometimes say when he
        finished &gt; &gt; &gt; the cross, 1st &gt; &gt; &gt; pair, 2nd pair,
        etc., and I noticed that he was much &gt; &gt; &gt; faster during &gt;
        &gt; &gt; the F2L, but I would usually catch up during the LL &gt; &gt;
        &gt; phase.. Both &gt; &gt; &gt; ending with about the same time.
        (sometimes, when he &gt; &gt; &gt; was solving F2L &gt; &gt; &gt; really
        fast, I thought, 'oh well, he's just saying &gt; &gt; &gt; that :)',
        &gt; &gt; &gt; remember Dan? ;)). Anyway, today, I timed my F2L and &gt;
        &gt; &gt; LL (without OLL &gt; &gt; &gt; regognition) seperately, and I
        think I barely average &gt; &gt; &gt; sub 10 for the &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L.
        Maybe around 11 seconds, but around 6 seconds for &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        last &gt; &gt; &gt; layer (just estimating, I didnt make notes yet..
        maybe &gt; &gt; &gt; I should). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do any
        cubers here have tips to really speed up that &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L? I
        think I &gt; &gt; &gt; know most shortcuts, but maybe I have to cut out
        some &gt; &gt; &gt; cube rotations &gt; &gt; &gt; that I do
        automatically. But how can I train this? &gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone else
        &gt; &gt; &gt; here recognize the same 'weak spot'? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi Tyson, OK. We know each others preference. I'd like to turn this
        thread into one about accuracy. You know those crappy stickers? The ones
        that most everybody complains about? I've used them daily on an arched
        cube for nearly two years and they only show a little wear. When I got
        the cube I found that the edges of the stickers catch on my fingers, so
        I quit hitting the edge of the stickers with my fingers and the wear
        pretty much stopped. If you practice on several different kinds of
        cubes, including ones you dread like arched- or flat-center ones, too
        tight or too loose ones, etc. it can help with accuracy. Cheers, David J

        Hi David, You know, the same applies with pianos as well. Some people
        who never practice on a piano other than their own have difficultly in
        adjust when it comes time for a performance. The 'crappy sticker' issue
        also depends on cubing style. I use my entire thumb on certain
        algorithms and unfortunately, I have developed a rough callous for
        writing (yes, I occasionally go to class =) ) which is usually want
        contributes to the wear on those paper stickers. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        Bryan, I got some of the tiles from Chris about a week ago. he said they
        were made from a clear Lexan. Whatever they are, they fit great on any
        normal 3x3x3 cube and they are much, much thinner than I thought they
        would be--when I got them I thought at first glance that they were
        another set of stickers because all six colors combined were about the
        thickness of a quarter [and that included the little paper backing that
        you peel off to stick them on]. truly no real noticeable difference in
        thickness vs. the ordinary stickers. definitely recommend them. --Kirk

        Okey, this is bizzare... Yesterday, I was working on a solution to this
        weeks FMC and left the cube (Rubiks Studio) in a partly solved state in
        my room. I then had other things to do so the cube remained untouched
        most of the day. In the evening when I picked it up again all orange
        facelets had turned red (it's almost impossible to differ between red
        and orange now, speedcubing is totally impossible). First I suspected
        that I had left it in the sun and the stickers had bleached but now I
        doubt the theory for two reasons. First of all, I have had left the cube
        in the same spot ever since I got it in January and nothing has
        happened. Second, the cube was not solved with orange facing up but only
        partly solved with orange stickers on several faces. Has this happened
        to anyone else or can someone give me a resonable explenation to this
        phenomena? I´m starting to develope a paranoia. I suspect there is some
        evil cube-hating force that tries to destroy my cubes to prevent me from
        cubing ever again (my girlfriend´s Rubiks.com cube [with arched centers]
        has popped on its own and disassembled itself in her bag). I´m very
        puzzled and really can´t understand what happened. In my opinion this is
        at least slightly funny so I thought I´d share. May the force be with
        you, fellow cubers, and don´t let the dark side touch your cube, Mikael

        Yesterday, I was working on a solution to this weeks FMC and left the

        had &gt; other things to do so the cube remained untouched most of the
        day. In &gt; the evening when I picked it up again all orange facelets

        orange now, &gt; speedcubing is totally impossible). &gt; &gt; First I
        suspected that I had left it in the sun and the stickers had &gt;
        bleached but now I doubt the theory for two reasons. First of all, I
        &gt; have had left the cube in the same spot ever since I got it in
        January &gt; and nothing has happened. &gt; Second, the cube was not
        solved with orange facing up but only partly &gt; solved with orange
        stickers on several faces. Well, if someone who has eaten a lot of beans
        and happens to be in the vicinity and ... &gt; Has this happened to
        anyone else or can someone give me a resonable &gt; explenation to this
        phenomena? &gt; I´m starting to develope a paranoia. I suspect there is
        some evil &gt; cube-hating force that tries to destroy my cubes to
        prevent me from &gt; cubing ever again (my girlfriend´s Rubiks.com cube
        [with arched &gt; centers] has popped on its own and disassembled itself
        in her bag). Since those cubes not only don't pop but are hard to
        disassemble I'd say someone was playing with your head. &gt; &gt; I´m
        very puzzled and really can´t understand what happened. In my &gt;
        opinion this is at least slightly funny so I thought I´d share. &gt;
        &gt; May the force be with you, fellow cubers, and don´t let the dark
        side &gt; touch your cube, As an Irish friend of mine says, Beware the
        dark side of the farce. &gt; Mikael Cheers DJ P.S. Actually I left a
        scrambled cube, with about half of the orange stickers exposed, in
        direct sun for about 20 minutes and about those exposed ones turned
        darker for a while. They went back to normal, but I forget how long it
        took. It wouldn't be too hard for another cubist to memorize a position,
        stick the orange side in the sun for a bit and return it to the state it
        was in before.

        Hi Joel, maybe you should have a look at Pedro's "Magical F2L Tricks".
        Also, why don't you start analyzing what you already know? You know a
        specific cuber who's faster than you, so try to find out why *he* is
        faster. Maybe compare the number of twists and the number of cube turns
        for a start (I'd also be interested in these numbers). Cheers! Stefan

        Hi Mikael, A similar thing actually did happen to me - at least
        partially. Again with orange turning to red and on a high quality studio
        cube (from Ton - my favourite cube). Only for me it was very confusing
        because it only happened to 2 corners and one edge piece. I had taken my
        cube apart to lube it and then when I went to reassemble it I couldn't
        find the OWB corner - in fact all of my white corners now had red
        stickers. IF you look VERY VERY closly you can tell the difference but
        it is useless for sppedcubing and I had to steal a couple of orange
        stickers off an inferior cube to keep my good one running. At the time I
        blamed the transformation on the lube and figured that I had been
        careless while spraying some of the pieces and that was why it only
        happened to 3 of the 8 orange stickers - now I'm no so sure what to
        think. Rob --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Mikael"

        hmm idk but i think its just me. i find that i can track pieces better
        if i hold the cube not with the front face facing me, but a little bit
        moved about 30 degrees to your left or right as you solve, you can see
        and track some pieces quiet efficiently. so basically its like holding
        the side of the cube facing you :P just like in those java applets.

        Hi Peter, I am very hopeful about being able to go to RWC 2005 pending
        money/employ/ and time off etc. I would likely be leaving from Toronto.
        I will be returning to Toronto at the start of June and would be very
        keen on a Canadian cube comp - or even just an informal gathering of the
        cube clan. Keep me posted. Rob --- In

        Same problem -- Studio cube. I tried household bleach, which possibly
        lightened the colour a little (sorry, no "control" in the experiment),
        but not enough. In the end I made new stickers from paper labels and
        protected with acrylic varnish (never use this, btw -- it takes weeks
        for acrylic to cure properly). Anyway, it sounds like a good time for
        you to visit Jello33's sticker shop... Mike

        Was the orange originaly a fluorescent color? I know that the

        Hey :-) This is a recurring topic ;-) Short and sad answer is : NO!
        Reason is that the wc2005 will be sponsored by Seventowns. They will not
        allow any Eastsheen or other unbranded puzzles for the competitions. In
        theory any cheap cloned knock-off 3x3x3 is therefore not allowed. But
        it's real hard to identify those with any great certainty. So the ban by
        and large is concerned with the Eastsheen kinda 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. So my
        advise is either to buy official rubiks.com 4x4x4/5x5x5 or borrow some
        that u can practise with. If u solely practise the Eastsheen and borrow
        official ones in Orlando u will not be used to them and hence u have a
        large handicap. The 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 won't have to be brand new
        rubiks.com of course. They could be old Arxon or Mefferts or any other
        which have the same mechanism as the current rubiks.com ones. Tiled ones
        are also allowed as long as each face has tiles of a distinct color. And
        also the color of all cubies (the plastic pieces) should be same so as
        not to give any recognition advantage ;-) Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        Hmm ... It's great news if there really are no branding restrictions for

        They have always been there in the past when Seventowns have sponsored

        that they can help us clarify this with the wc 2005 sponsor(s). Have

        pair, etc., and I noticed that he was much faster during &gt; &gt; the
        F2L, but I would usually catch up during the LL phase.. Both &gt; &gt;
        ending with about the same time. (sometimes, when he was solving F2L
        &gt; &gt; really fast, I thought, 'oh well, he's just saying that :)',
        &gt; &gt; remember Dan? ;)). Anyway, today, I timed my F2L and LL
        (without OLL &gt; &gt; regognition) seperately, and I think I barely
        average sub 10 for the &gt; &gt; F2L. Maybe around 11 seconds, but
        around 6 seconds for the last &gt; &gt; layer (just estimating, I didnt

        have tips to really speed up that F2L? I think I &gt; &gt; know most
        shortcuts, but maybe I have to cut out some cube rotations &gt; &gt;
        that I do automatically. But how can I train this? Does anyone else &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do any cubers here have tips to really speed up
        that F2L? I &gt; think I &gt; &gt; &gt; know most shortcuts, but maybe I
        have to cut out some cube &gt; rotations &gt; &gt; &gt; that I do
        automatically. But how can I train this? Does anyone &gt; else &gt; &gt;
        &gt; here recognize the same 'weak spot'? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        the WC2005 in Florida. Thankfully I have 6 months still to get better,
        in an attempt to avoid embarrassment. And on the topic of a Canadian
        cube competition, I would be very interested in that, more so if it was
        before the WC2005. I have never even been in the same room with another
        speedcuber, so I would love to get some experience before the big dance.

        For those of you who don't know what the E permutation is (not to insult
        anyone of course), it switches UFR&lt;-&gt;UFL corners, and UBR&lt;-
        &gt;UBL corners. This case has troubled me for quite some time, mostly
        because my previous algorithm took ~2.4 seconds to execute. In the
        overall scheme of things that's not bad execution time, but my desire to
        have all my permutations under 2 seconds has prevented any level of
        contentment. (sorry I'm rambling so much guys/girls) I've found an alg
        after some playing around, and it's a great improvement to my previous
        one. Here it is: x'(U'R U L'U'R'U)(r2 U R')(U'L'U R U') I'm not sure
        whether someone else has found this alg previously, but it's very fluid
        after some practice. My times for executing this case are ~2.1 seconds,
        but I think it will be sub2 after I 'master' it. Anyway, I'm sorry for
        such the long post regarding just a single LL case, but I was so excited
        to find it I couldn't help myself. Happy Cubing! -Richard

        else has found this alg previously, but &gt; it's very fluid after some
        practice. My times for executing this &gt; case are ~2.1 seconds, but I
        think it will be sub2 after I 'master' &gt; it. &gt; &gt; Anyway, I'm

        I am not sure if this post will be usefull for my, but I'll try &gt;
        &gt; anyway :). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think I have found a pretty nice
        area of improvement for me. When &gt; &gt; DanH was visiting me a few
        weeks ago, we had a few (a lot, actually) &gt; &gt; of races, and he
        would sometimes say when he finished the cross, 1st &gt; &gt; pair, 2nd
        pair, etc., and I noticed that he was much faster during &gt; &gt; the
        F2L, but I would usually catch up during the LL phase.. Both &gt; &gt;
        ending with about the same time. (sometimes, when he was solving F2L
        &gt; &gt; really fast, I thought, 'oh well, he's just saying that :)',
        &gt; &gt; remember Dan? ;)). Anyway, today, I timed my F2L and LL
        (without OLL &gt; &gt; regognition) seperately, and I think I barely
        average sub 10 for the &gt; &gt; F2L. Maybe around 11 seconds, but
        around 6 seconds for the last &gt; &gt; layer (just estimating, I didnt
        make notes yet.. maybe I should). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do any cubers here
        have tips to really speed up that F2L? I think I &gt; &gt; know most
        shortcuts, but maybe I have to cut out some cube rotations &gt; &gt;
        that I do automatically. But how can I train this? Does anyone else &gt;
        &gt; here recognize the same 'weak spot'? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Joël.

        Per brought this up in the chat one time and I tried timing myself. My
        normal scrambling pace seems to take me about 8 seconds on average, 7 if
        it is an easy algorithm. If we do start this category I'd like to try
        it. I wonder if we get 15 seconds to examine the algorithm and try to
        plan out how we will execute it? :) Chris P.S. No I really am serious

        15 seconds of preinspection time sounds reasonable. If we wanted to

        I'm kind of set back that I overlooked it! I've looked at Lars' PLL page
        quite a few times. Regardless, I'm hoping I can get this case under two
        seconds. It would bring my total sub2 second cases to 16/21. I feel like
        the remaining 5 cases will be nearly impossible to bring to sub2
        seconds. I've decided to focus more on improving my OLL now. Is it
        reasonable to shoot for having most orientations under 1.5 seconds? I'm
        not sure where orientations should be on average. -Richard --- Dan

        I've &gt; &gt; found an alg after some playing around, and it's a &gt;
        great &gt; improvement &gt; &gt; to my previous one. Here it is: &gt;

        practice will do... I'm at 16.85 best average, and i didn't even bother
        to learn the OLLs yet. I think by the time I was at 35s, I still did 1st
        layer then middle layer then 2 OLLs and that's where I started doing 2
        PLLs instead of 4-5 :-P. Anyway, just practice, the OLLs are no miracle
        solution, if you can do the OLL in say 3-4s but it takes you 5s to
        recognize the LL case (and find the alg you have to use there)...
        Execution time is not the key, recognition is. It'll never take you more
        than 4-5s to do the alg (unless... well... you know what I mean) but if
        it takes you, say, 4s to recognize the OLL, 2s to see the PLL, plus the
        20s to do the F2L, that's where you'll be losing most of your time. Just
        practice, i bet in one month of regular (not even freaky 5hours/day)
        practice you'll already be at 25 something, maybe even better.

        Francois made excellent points here. At best learning OLL improved my LL
        by 1.5 seconds. The easiest way to improve your times from this point is
        to focus on the f2l. And the amount of algs you have to learn to improve
        on this is 0 anyway. Work on minimizing cube rotations, and solving your
        f2l fluidly without stalls. -Richard --- Fran���ois Sechet

        I'm relatively new to speedcubing, and my cube is pretty fast. However,
        after watching some videos I've noticed cubes that are so loose that a
        tap sends that side spinning - any suggestions on how to get my cube to
        move faster? I have two cubes, one is a white DIY without arched centers
        and the other is a regular Rubiks model with arched centers. I have used
        Rubik's cube lube and also tried silicon spray. I've loosened the screws
        on my white cube but it pops all the time. thanks bryan

        Hey. I'm in almost the exact same boat as you are. I know all the 41 F2L
        algs, the 21 PLL, and all the two-step OLL algs. I'm currently averaging
        in the mid to low 30's. Aside from my own fears that i've reached the
        limit of my own dexterity, I've realized that by far my biggest weakness
        is the F2L. I believe this is the hardest part for most cubers to
        improve. I've just begun to try to spot a first-layer corner on the
        U-layer AS i'm placing a pair. I think this is a good step in working on
        spotting the pairs quicker. I use all triggerized versions of the F2L
        pair algs, which (for me at least) can be executed faster, even though
        each alg average about 1 move longer than the algs that Fridrich uses.
        Problem is I find algs that are done just by me left hand, are
        significantly slower. So strengthening your week hand might do some good
        as well. Just a couple ideas. --- In

        I think another useful thing to try would be experimenting with a Petrus
        or block style F2L. The more you know about things like that, the more
        lucky cases you can take advantage of. Another good tip I rarely hear
        mentioned is to use working corners. When a corner or an edge is already
        placed correctly, assuming it's not part of the last pair, you can
        insert it using a different open corner. That's an easy way to often
        save a couple of moves. Just remembering to do that when I see it has
        helped with my recent several second average improvement. Another things
        is to make sure you know all of your algs and can recognize them from
        multiple angles and quickly. My biggest problem is still large delays
        between pairs and looks. Minimal stopping is the key to fast times.

        If Chris can do a 25 move scramble alg in 8 seconds then he should do a
        20 move one in 6.4 seconds, so he'd beat Macky (assuming 15s) by a
        factor of 2.34 which means if you have a record average of 2.34*16.75s =
        39.26s or better you should have a good chance to beat Macky this way.
        Btw, I'd suggest to directly produce random scrambles with Cube Explorer
        instead. They're not only a bit shorter but also actually more uniformly
        distributed. Cheers! Stefan

        Well.. First of all, if there are still any cases (F2L, OLL or PLL) that
        you don't like, then I suggest you should try to find other versions of
        those algoritms that you do like. (It took me quite some time to get to
        the point where I like all my LL algs). For almost each algorithms,
        there are alternatives. I send some e-mails a couple of days ago to
        another speedcuber who also has about the same times as you... If you
        are interested, I can forward them to you... They might be usefull for
        you as well.. :). Good luck! - Joël. --- In

        Hmm.. I am not really sure if 'practice will do'... :S I think for LL,
        yes, practice will do after you have found algorithms that you like to
        execute... For F2L, I don't think practicing with a timer and all will
        do. I think it's very important to solve the cube without timing
        yourself, while actively thinking about the steps that you make, and try
        to find all the F2L shortcuts yourself. Joël. --- In

        you can &gt; do the OLL in say 3-4s but it takes you 5s to &gt;
        recognize the LL case (and find the alg you have to &gt; use there)...
        Execution time is not the key, &gt; recognition is. It'll never take you
        more than 4-5s to &gt; do the alg (unless... well... you know what I
        mean) &gt; but if it takes you, say, 4s to recognize the OLL, 2s &gt; to
        see the PLL, plus the 20s to do the F2L, that's &gt; where you'll be
        losing most of your time. Just &gt; practice, i bet in one month of

        I am in no position to be giving advice, which is not what I am here to
        do. But I wanted to offer some first hand experience. This idea that
        Joel suggested, about not timing yourself for a bit and just
        concentrating on going slowly and looking ahead during the F2L is sound.
        I had read people offer the advice before, but it is difficult to
        comprehend when you are first starting. You see other cubers flying
        through the F2L and feel you need to go as fast as you can to try and
        keep pace (which you won't anyway). Since Joel was nice enough to offer
        me some good tips, I took him seriously and did exactly that for most of
        this week  didn't time myself, and only concentrated on solving the F2L
        without stopping, no matter how slowly it felt I was going. After only 3
        days of doing that, I could feel I was finding the pieces better. So I
        did an average last night, and I already dropped nearly 2 seconds from
        my average. Sub 30 here I come! So listen to these guys, they know their

        Hi all, There are a few ways I've tried timing my algs. I guess the most
        common way, is probably similar to what Terje is describing. Starting
        from a computer timer, repeating the alg 5-10 times, and just find my
        average from there. I hope to get a webcam soon for recording videos,
        and I can be completely accurate in knowing my times. -Richard --- Terje

        First your should practice for a while and get good at reconizing and
        exicuting your algorithms quickly, then you should learn x-cross and
        COLL, and if you still want to get better you might want to learn zb.

        Hey Richard, Well, I think if you do it that way, it's probably pretty
        accurate :). And Tyson, good point about the ice cream :D. And Dave,

        &gt; &gt; Yeah.. The the question was, what kind of timer he &gt; &gt;
        uses. With these &gt; &gt; 2sec algorithms, you can't really compare
        unless you &gt; &gt; use the same &gt; &gt; timing method. &gt; &gt;

        Hey! Just a little remark. U cannot refer to one of the cases for
        OLL/PLL as an _algorithm_. An algorithm is how u do something, not what
        is to be done. A case is like a task. So another version of an algorithm
        doesn't make sense. Or it might possible mean u find another way to
        perform it. Likewise u can't say another sequence for an algorithm,
        cause then it's a different algorithm!! Sequence and algorithm is the
        same. At least when it comes to talking bout cube cases. So what u
        should have said was to find an algorithm/sequence and a way to perform
        it that suits u for _each_ of the cases in OLL/PLL ... Well this is how
        i understand it anyway. If im wrong please let me know :D Most ppl will
        still understand what is meant. But some might get confused when the
        terminology is not used consistently ;-) Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        all my LL algs). For almost &gt; each algorithms, there are
        alternatives. &gt; &gt; I send some e-mails a couple of days ago to
        another speedcuber who &gt; also has about the same times as you... If
        you are interested, I can &gt; forward them to you... They might be

        Hi everyone. I'm looking for e-shop with a octagon/barrel cube. I was
        searching for long time, but I didn't find one :( It should be possible
        to buy without using Paypal, because it doesn't accept my country :( For
        every answer big thanks. Regards, Rafal from Poland

        I'd be much more interested in finding out how many moves it actually
        takes you on average, how many steps and how efficient they are, and how
        easy the recognition of your steps is. These will give you a much better

        Actually, I solve with the Roux method, and it uses lots of slice turns,
        and seeing as half turns are generally accepted as single moves outside
        of the fewest moves community (in which there is a roaring debate about
        this as we type), I think it's safe to measure those with Slice Turn
        Metric. The moves you described are both counted as single moves in this
        metric. Using quarter turn metric, most of even the top solvers would
        count more than 60 or even 65 moves, in my estimatation. That would
        still most likely leave you with a number around 100 or so, which is all
        well and good for a beginner, especially homemade solution, but you
        should still look for ways to optimize it, even if it's only a few moves
        here and there. Try to minimize moves that cancel eachother out when
        possible, like the ends of certain algorithms when you realize you'll
        have to turn around and undo them at the beginning of the next. Anywho,
        would you care to describe your method? You've piqued my late night
        curiosity. =) -Mike Bennett ----- Original Message ----- From:

        I'm guessing that if I count the double moves as one the total will go
        down to about 80 because I use A LOT of doubles at the end. My method
        goes in layers, and I hear many of them do but have yet to research
        that. I may not at all. I like making my own, and call those who used
        the booklet that comes with the cube to solve it cheaters. Anyway, I do
        the top edges, then corners, then middle edges. All of those are just
        kind of... done. I don't have "steps" in my mind, I just see and do what
        is necessary. Then I have a move that switches two adjacent bottom
        corners and a move that switches both pairs of adjacent bottom corners.
        Next, I have a single move that re-orients three corners, but not
        necessarily correctly the first time I use it. I may have to re-orient
        the cube itself, then do the sequence two or three more times. Then, I
        have a move that shuffles three bottom edges around. Finally, I finish
        up with any of three sequences that solve the three possible situations
        at that point.

        I highly recommend not necessarily learning a bunch of algorithms for
        the first two layers, but at least looking at sites that explain it. The
        more you understand how and why the pieces you're moving around behave
        like they do, the easier you can see how to move them around the way you
        want to. First two layers is key for decreasing your times. Using a very
        beginner last layer method with fewer algorithms to learn than yours,
        I've managed times in the low and mid 20's. That method involved a
        sequence and its inverse to flip edges, one to swap two corners
        sometimes done twice, one and its reflection to to orient corners in
        also sometimes done twice, and another and its inverse to rotate three
        edges. The approach you're taking is closer to a 4 look CLL+ELL (Corners
        last layer+Edges last layer). There are fewer distinct cases to learn
        than OLL+PLL, and it's easier to recognize, in my opinion. Anyway, good
        luck with your method and remember to slow down and concentrate on your
        first two layers and minimizing delays. As always, happy cubing. -Mike

        The number of looks refers to the number of steps you use to solve the
        last layer. 3 looks=3 steps. They're called looks because generally,
        you're solving with a memorized sequence, so you're recognizing a case
        and performing an algorithm. While you're performing it, you should be
        looking ahead to the the state your cube will be in so as to minimize
        delays. When you orient pieces, that means they're flipped to face the
        direction they're supposed to face, though they're not necessarily in
        the correct spots. When you permute them, you're moving the pieces to
        their correct places, or at least to specific places you want them to
        go, and not necessarily conserving their orientation. CLL+ELL stands for
        Corners Last Layer+Edges Last Layer in much the same way OLL+PLL
        represents Orient and Permute Last Layer. CLL means you orient and
        permute the corners in one step (or two shorter steps). ELL is the same,
        but with edges. OLL is when you orient all of your last layer corners
        and edges at the same time. PLL is where you permute them all. -Mike

        To give you an idea, though I am a self-proclaimed "cheater" :) you
        should be able to do the first two layers in 35 moves or less on average
        with *LOTS* of practice (the real pros use around 32 moves or less on
        average). Though many of us spent times learning lots of sequences, they
        can all be discovered with intuition and time/practice. A lot of people
        never look up anything about the first two layers, and come up with the
        optimal sequences. I would say to not worry about your last layer
        technique just yet, but to really practice decreasing the number of
        moves it takes you to solve the first two layers. This doesn't mean time
        yourself, it means to just sit down with a cube for 5 minutes or more
        and solve the first two layers in as few moves as possible. This helps
        you to see new things. One of my main "drills" when I practice is to
        count the number of moves it takes me to solve the cube, taking as much
        time as I feel like taking. I don't do any "fewest moves" tricks, just
        my normal system, but with any helpful tricks I see. I personally regret
        being a "cheater" a little bit, so if you can keep your non-cheater
        status and figure out first two layers stuff on your own, that would be
        awesome! One thing to realize though, last layer algorithms are to speed
        cubing as opening lines are to chess. You can try to discover them
        yourself, but why reinvent the wheel when it would take you months to do
        so, and you still may not find the optimal sequences? Eventually you'll
        reach a point where you have to learn more last layer algorithms to
        speed up. Just realize that memorizing algs for the last layer is just a
        necessity of speedcubing (unless you are an *incredible* prodigy IHMO).

        Alright folks, so I've lost all my speedcubes and given away a few 4x4s
        and stuff. But lately I've been trying to amass a large fleet of cubes.
        I ordered over $150 worth of cubing materials and have finished
        preliminary evaluations. ***Items*** Rubiks.com: Harry Potter Magic, two
        25th Aniversary cubes, offical lube, offical sets of stickers,
        print-your-own-design stickers, White DIY, standard 4x4 CubeSmith.com: 8
        sets of 3x3 stickers Skiffy.com: 1000 cube-sized washers So last night I
        was sitting here tinkering with the Magic and 2 hrs flew by! The wires
        are holding up well, but one of my links seem to be noticably offset,
        perhaps someone here can help with that. It could be that I was doing a
        set of moves repeatedly and gradually moved the wires to an *unhappy
        place*. Long story short, the 25th Aniversary cubes are crap! I took out
        a mechanism and did some sanding, put on pieces from my mediocre cube
        (off-the-shelf Hasbro aged 9 months) (my best speedcube at the time
        sadly enough), and put on a set of the official stickers. Those stickers
        didn't last... Why? They were the out-dated laminated crap that we
        always warn you about. Those would have held up for about 10 days in
        [my] normal cubing conditions. I took off the center caps to the
        mechnism to see that..., yup no screws, hurray! Bleh.... It was good for
        one thing... placing in my cube robot. Then I found out that the
        stickers were overly reflective for my RGB sensors and so replaced them
        with oversized, colored electrical/plastic tape. The offical cube lube
        worked beautifully on my robot's cube. I am starting to really love this
        citrus smelling milky cube wax they offer. So that cube now happens to
        be donated (or indedefinate loan) to the computer engineering department
        after the conclusion of my project. (I will try to bring it back for
        some one credit independent study, 400-lvl control systems course, or
        just join an undergrad lab and get some office space to work on it in my
        spare time.) So then the remaining kernal was mated with the remaining
        pieces. So the twenty 25th Aniversary pieces on a half-worn-in Hasbro
        mechanism. That became my "best" speedcube for a few weeks, but I use
        the term "best" very loosely here. I am now finding the arched centers a
        terrible thing to have. (Not necessarily in general, but this case has
        already made up my mind it seems.) So I took out the other 25th
        Anniversary cube out of it's shiny hexagonal-prism box since I was
        lacking cubes. I haven't done anythig to it for the past 6 weeks I've
        had it. I feel it's not worth saving. I don't think there is much I can
        do for it and the amount of work I put into it will have severly
        deminishing returns. Ok so the main problem is that it came too loose,
        it's lacking the desired springy-ness, the plastic seems to be harder,
        when you turn a face it sounds like something is dying in there. In this
        case lubing of any form didn't help. In fact it made the slipping
        problem worst. It locks up as much as the disasterous Meffert's
        Assembly, lol. So that's just going to sit pretty on it's lovely
        hexagonal base on top of my monitor for the time being. On to the
        exciting stuff. I followed StefanP.'s washer idea on "twisty". You can
        find it here:
        http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3723&amp;highlight=washers
        I am still waiting for the order to arrive however. They are proving a
        cool little utility set. I mainly want it for the knife. Ordering from
        Europe would have been just $6.50 or so. But in the states, there is an
        extra $13 shippping fee which took me ages to decide on paying. More
        about the washers next week. I got a bunch of 3x3 stickers from
        Jello33/cubesmith. They arrived either yesterday or the day before, and
        I am very impressed with the service. It only took them like 2 days. I
        would like to place an order for other stuff like Eastsheen 2x2, 4x4,
        Oddzon 4x4, 5x5, 5x5 supercubing, and pyraminx... oh but wait, he
        doesn't sell any non- sqaure stickers. Hem... and also the 5x5 superset
        are done in the standard color-scheme and not made to my liking. (I'm
        sure the stickers are quality, just that I use this bizzare
        color-scheme.) So to that, I hope taht in the future cubesmith.com will
        be a more central shopping hub for our community. Surely, I see it's
        potential to be. It would be great if he can provide other types of
        stickers (megaminx?), injectable cube lube (I mean wax, since it's the
        new hip thing to do now), and DIY kits... I would like it if we could
        rally enough support as a community and push for a bulk order of these
        DIY kits and sell them at discounted rates at cubesmith.com, where by
        discounted I mainly refer to the shipping costs that rubik.com is a bit
        hefty on for my budget. Jello33 is THE MAN!!! While I try to pick enough
        things to get my total over the $10 mark to avoid the extra shipping
        costs, lets talk about the DIY kits. I got the white one a few days ago
        along with a brand-spankin' 4x4. (To replace the 4x4 my frined took to
        Bombay as a graduation/parting gift.) Now my old one was never schemed
        to my liking, and was a bit on hte stiff side requiring obnoxiously
        frequent lubrication (silicone spray, I still recommend it a couple
        weeks AFTER an injection wax treatment, if you can afford it.) The one I
        have been using has this terrible purple side, you know what I'm talking
        about... the little Eastsheen one. It fits my hands beautifully (I have
        small girlish hands, as I found out when comparing to other cometitors
        at Toronto, and when I say other competitiors I am thining about that 7
        year old Polish girl, lol) That one locks up and slips too much. There
        ARE a LOT of moving parts in there. (I think euqual or worst then the
        standard 5x5 the last time I counted.) I am afraid to re-scheme my
        Eastsheen cubes...., Ah! but wait we have cubesmith now.... rescued
        again :)! The Meffert's 4x4 still lies broken in my room, been like that
        for over two years, cuz every time I fix a fragil center piece it breaks
        again in a week or two along with another center :(. Ya, I recommend
        against Meffert's 4x4s (this doesn't count the Eastsheen ones. You see,
        they are not manufactured to good control standards I believe, or at
        least wasn't at the time of my purchese 4 years ago. Bubbles in the
        plactic underneth the stickers, tons of internal imperfections. Had to
        spend days to sand out properly. Though the kernal is dismantel-able
        unlike standard ones that are superglued in on top of the 9 screws. So
        THIS new 4x4 came 3 days after I placed my order! Very expedicant
        service, I'm quite pleased. I applied the usual techniques I do for
        4x4's, then an injection of wax, then a reschemeing. Referencing
        Stefan's page on how to minimally rescheme a 4x4, I found that none of
        those algorithms applied directly to my situation, my color- scheme is
        the devil..., it's as far away from standard as possible. It requies
        some 4-cycle of sticker faces. I managed to do it in 14 moves though!
        This required one twist of a corner piece which may be considered
        "cheating" to some purists. Anyhow, all that took up no more then a half
        hour and my cube was PERFECT! I would say a bit on the loose side
        though, and that's in accordance with MY style... I have a very
        loose/shifty/rapid movement style. It's borderline to the point where I
        perform starts AND *stops* of my turns. So the final note, I have a
        marvolously loose 4x4 sppedcube. It came that way, better then if it was
        too tight. but I'll eventually have to figure out how to tighten one of
        those things. Best of all is the White DIY 3x3 kit I recidved in the
        same shipment as the 4x4. Put it together in about 2-3 hours. I was
        going to hold out for the washers but, it's doing pretty well without it
        for the time being. WHITE, dang that looks freaky! Ihave very high
        standards when it comes to preparing a cube and some say that I have
        been quite spoiled with the quality of my speedcubes. (Those who have
        tested them at competitions.) Yet I lost them all on the bus over the
        past year, *sigh*. WHY, OH LORD WHY HAVE THEY FORSAKEN ME, lol. But the
        white one is fantastic. Only took about 3rhs to produce a magnificent
        speedcube! It surpassed my standards. No real need to wear it in. I'm
        going to have to tighten it further though after I use it's loose state
        to practice my "accuracy" as Tyson, Macky, and others have advocated. I
        think I'm going to order a FLEET (a word I adapted from JonM) of these.
        Get a dozen identical speedcubes suited up for Sunday contests and stuff
        would be great. So this was the story of how a cuber in
        speedcubing-proverty, is rising to speedcube-wealth. More to come I
        hope; catch you on the flip side! -Doug

        Hi Doug, nice extensive review, thanks :-) Some comments... &gt; So last
        night I was sitting here tinkering with the Magic and 2 hrs &gt; flew
        by! The wires are holding up well, but one of my links seem to &gt; be
        noticably offset, perhaps someone here can help with that. I have a few
        of these, too, and I can tell you they come this way. I'm not at all
        happy with them in mint condition. I got them in order to build new
        magics, e.g. a master magic. So I take out the strings, cut holes in the
        sides of the paper where they should be, and insert the strings again,
        but differently. A bit hard to explain, though, and if you only have one
        it's maybe a bit risky... &gt; Ok so the main problem is that it came
        too loose, it's lacking the &gt; desired springy-ness, the plastic seems
        to be harder, when you turn &gt; a face it sounds like something is
        dying in there. In this case &gt; lubing of any form didn't help. In
        fact it made the slipping problem &gt; worst. It locks up as much as the
        disasterous Meffert's Assembly, &gt; lol. When it's too loose you might
        be able to fix it even though they have rivets instead of screws.
        They're pretty much impossible to pull out but you might be able to push
        them in deeper. Have a closeup look at a rivet (that I got with a black
        DIY, I assume this is what's in your cube, too):
        http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/diy_rivet.jpg &gt; I followed StefanP.'s
        washer idea on "twisty". You can find it here: &gt;
        http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?
        t=3723&amp;highlight=washers &gt; I am still waiting for the order to
        arrive however. They are proving &gt; a cool little utility set. I
        mainly want it for the knife. Ordering &gt; from Europe would have been
        just $6.50 or so. But in the states, &gt; there is an extra $13
        shippping fee which took me ages to decide on &gt; paying. More about
        the washers next week. Uh, I do hope you'll get the tool. I didn't know
        this and I was surprised when I got it. They say it's a welcome present
        for ordering online, apparently sort of an appetizer also mentioned in
        the printed catalog (which I don't have). I don't like the knife that
        much, I was mainly interested in the washers, so for me it was just a
        nice extra. &gt; I got a bunch of 3x3 stickers from Jello33/cubesmith.
        They arrived &gt; either yesterday or the day before, and I am very
        impressed with the &gt; service. It only took them like 2 days. I would
        like to place an &gt; order for other stuff like Eastsheen 2x2, 4x4,
        Oddzon 4x4, 5x5, 5x5 &gt; supercubing, and pyraminx... oh but wait, he
        doesn't sell any non- &gt; sqaure stickers. Not true, look at the
        square-1 stickers :-) He'll probably have Megaminx stickers very soon,
        too. I've never seen a Pyraminx with bad stickers so I don't know
        whether that'd make sense ;-) &gt; It requies some 4-cycle of sticker
        faces. I managed to do it in 14 &gt; moves though! Can you tell those 14
        moves? Even though the resulting scheme might not be interesting for
        anyone but you (;-) such a short algorithm sounds nice. How many
        stickers did you need to peel off? &gt; Best of all is the White DIY 3x3
        kit I recidved in the same shipment &gt; as the 4x4. Put it together in
        about 2-3 hours. I was going to hold &gt; out for the washers but, it's
        doing pretty well without it for the &gt; time being. Yes, washers won't
        make a big difference here. The screw head is large enough to be the
        limit for how far you can pull out the center, so the spring is not
        almost fully compressed like with smaller screw heads. This and the
        somewhat ground spring ends prevent major scratching. I'd however
        suggest to try adding washers *outside* of the centers, between center
        and the kernel spider. This should stabilize the centers which I think
        is good, it might work against pops. Cheers! Stefan

        Oh what I meant was 14 sticker moves... the actual number of turns was
        probably quite large since I was brute forcing it bit by bit. My scheme
        is: U=white, F=blue, R=red, L=yellow, B=orange, and D=green. To get it
        there I only needed to cycle 3 "pairs" of edge stickers and move around
        8 corner stickers..., one on each conrer. I like your washer idea. -Doug

        welcome to the group I used to use a method that sounds very similar to
        what you describe, also self-taught over months of trial and error
        practice one summer before 7th grade when the cube first exploded on the
        scene--long before you could just look up these algs on the internet. I
        used that method until just the past few months when I started to learn
        Fridrich. I definitely see value in trying to figure it out on your own,
        but if you're serious about getting really fast, you'll almost certainly
        have to learn some algs that are already out there everywhere on the
        Net. my times with that old method were just over a minute, with an
        occasional sub 60. Just since March, my average has dropped to 47
        seconds, and I very rarely have a solve over 60 [only when I get a brain
        cramp]. And my times are slowly but steadily dropping literally every
        week as I add new algs and get faster on the others. I definitely still
        need a lot more work on the F2L, though. agree that that's a huge part
        of getting faster times. good luck! Kirk --- In

        :) you &gt; should be able to do the first two layers in 35 moves or
        less on &gt; average with *LOTS* of practice (the real pros use around
        32 moves or &gt; less on average). &gt; &gt; Though many of us spent
        times learning lots of sequences, they can all &gt; be discovered with
        intuition and time/practice. A lot of people never &gt; look up anything
        about the first two layers, and come up with the &gt; optimal sequences.
        &gt; &gt; I would say to not worry about your last layer technique just
        yet, but &gt; to really practice decreasing the number of moves it takes
        you to &gt; solve the first two layers. This doesn't mean time yourself,
        it means &gt; to just sit down with a cube for 5 minutes or more and
        solve the first &gt; two layers in as few moves as possible. This helps
        you to see new things. &gt; &gt; One of my main "drills" when I practice
        is to count the number of &gt; moves it takes me to solve the cube,
        taking as much time as I feel &gt; like taking. I don't do any "fewest

        see. &gt; &gt; I personally regret being a "cheater" a little bit, so if
        you can keep &gt; your non-cheater status and figure out first two
        layers stuff on your &gt; own, that would be awesome! &gt; &gt; One
        thing to realize though, last layer algorithms are to speed cubing &gt;
        as opening lines are to chess. You can try to discover them yourself,
        &gt; but why reinvent the wheel when it would take you months to do so,
        and &gt; you still may not find the optimal sequences? Eventually you'll
        reach &gt; a point where you have to learn more last layer algorithms to
        speed &gt; up. Just realize that memorizing algs for the last layer is
        just a &gt; necessity of speedcubing (unless you are an *incredible*
        prodigy IHMO). &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; --- In

        All of &gt; &gt; those are just kind of... done. I don't have "steps" in
        my mind, I &gt; &gt; just see and do what is necessary. Then I have a
        move that switches &gt; &gt; two adjacent bottom corners and a move that
        switches both pairs of &gt; &gt; adjacent bottom corners. Next, I have a
        single move that re- orients &gt; &gt; three corners, but not
        necessarily correctly the first time I use it. &gt; &gt; I may have to
        re-orient the cube itself, then do the sequence two or &gt; &gt; three
        more times. Then, I have a move that shuffles three bottom &gt; &gt;
        edges around. Finally, I finish up with any of three sequences that &gt;
        &gt; solve the three possible situations at that point.

        Hi Mark, I just take the easy way out and use "Motomaster Silicone
        Spray". It is easy to find in the automotive section of any Canadian
        Tire I've been to in either Ontario or Manitoba - presumably available
        from coast to coast. It comes in an aerosol can with an orange/reddish
        lid (they have several different types of lubes in the same section so
        do be careful which one you pick up). It is cheap and easy to find. It
        seems to work quite well on my cubes but since it is the only brand I
        have ever used I cannot rate its performance against other brands. I
        usually take my cubes apart, spray the silicone on all the cubies, and
        wait for the pieces to dry before reassembling. If I do this the cube is
        ready to go as soon as it is reassembled. Rob --- In

        I recently purchased several sets of vinyl stickers for my 3x3x3's from
        Chris. The only real downside to them is the lack of a logo, without
        which my cube just looks a bit off. I intend to make my own logo on the
        white center cubie, but I don't know what I can use that won't rub right

        Hi! I was stupid enough to bring 2 cans of silicone spray to the 2nd GCD
        in Gütersloh. The stupid thing is that i brought it in my rucksack
        thinking it was much safer there than in my suitcase. Had it been there
        it would have been fine. But after a security scan of my rucksack they
        confiscated both cans (this was on my way out), and there was no way i
        could get them back later. One can did indeed say flammable on it, and
        the other even said _highly flammable_. So even if it should not really
        be flammable it will say so on the can, and may cause u trouble trying
        to transport in onboard aircrafts, at least as part of ur hand luggage
        ... *ugh* Luckily silicone spray is cheap ;-) There are actually some
        types of silicone sprays that are no legal here in Norway anymore, due
        to toxicity probably. Amongst others the black 3M spray is impossible to
        get hold of here. Same with Chestertone. And since it seems kinda
        impossible to get spray from one country to another in any legal way
        it's tough luck if u live in a restrictive country. Cubing was easier
        back in early 80's ;-) Slick cubing! -Per &gt; --- In

        I use vinyl stickers, and I never evan thought of making a logo, I don't
        really care, after a while you get used to not having a logo. I guess it
        doesn't bother me as much considering I start with green, and not white.

        Well I just had to think about it... I know that the centers are free to
        move around due to the availiblity of a 3 center piece cycle algorithm I
        know, and since you can cycle say (XXY) it will look like a two cycle.
        Thus no center stickers need to be chnaged. I noticed that there are
        only 3 edge-pairs that will not exist in the new scheme so that means
        that 6 edge stickers need to be moved. I know that none of the corners
        can be preserved since none of them exist on the new scheme. I checked
        each corner and noticed that there are two stickers that can belong to
        the new corners and thought that a minimal 8 might be possible. Then it
        took some guess work to see which corner should go where, with the
        knowledge that you can have two-corner cycles on the 4x4 without
        effecting other pieces. I quickly reduced the problem down to that of a
        2x2, and since I already knew from experience that 8 is minimal on a
        2x2, I knew everything would work out. Now to generate an optimal
        sequence for this.... what programs do this? -Doug --- In

        &gt; To get it there I only needed to cycle 3 "pairs" of edge stickers

        Hey Doug, Thanks for the kind words. I'm looking into the posibility of
        selling more cubes and puzzles on my site. I'm not sure if I can get the
        DIY kits at wholsale though because rubiks.com wants a minimum of 100
        piece order to even consider bulk pricing. I also would need to make
        sure it's feasable on the shipping side. Quite a lot of my orders are to
        overseas, and I can't put a $1 stamp on a Supercube. :) Keep checking my
        site as I'm also putting up more sticker sets this week including
        Alexandars star and Megaminx sets. I'm working on having as much stuff
        as possible on my site so if anyone hase suggestions for items or
        sticker sets they'd like to see please let me know. I take all comments
        and feedback serious, because I want to make my products to please as
        many people as possible. Thanks Chris www.cubesmith.com

        the orientation subgroup (fix the positions of the pieces but orient
        them). There are 94,518 inequivalent such positions. They can all be
        done in 20 moves (half turn metric) or less. At least 11 of these
        require 20 moves. Initially I'm trying to cut down the number of 20s. In
        those posts I listed some candidate positions (that CubeExplorer was
        taking a long time over. Two or 3 of those I subsequently found were
        optimal in 19 - hence the follow-ups. Still lots more candidates. In

        Hi Per, Thanks for telling us about you cans being confiscated. I don't
        want to lose my lubricant if I fly to the Worlds in November. Perhaps
        the sponsors could have a "Cube Service Station" where people could
        clean and lube their cubes, sand their springs, swap springs and
        washers, etc. Have you looked into ordering the black 3M non-oil-based,
        non-toxic spray online, and having it shipped to you? I use it, having
        found it at an auto parts store. In the 80's I never used lube. I once
        tried graphite, which works very well except that it doesn't stay in the
        cube! :P Thanks, David J --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; &gt; I was stupid enough to bring 2 cans of silicone spray to the
        2nd GCD &gt; in Gütersloh. The stupid thing is that i brought it in my
        rucksack &gt; thinking it was much safer there than in my suitcase. Had
        it been &gt; there it would have been fine. But after a security scan of
        my &gt; rucksack they confiscated both cans (this was on my way out),
        and &gt; there was no way i could get them back later. One can did
        indeed say &gt; flammable on it, and the other even said _highly
        flammable_. So even &gt; if it should not really be flammable it will
        say so on the can, and &gt; may cause u trouble trying to transport in
        onboard aircrafts, at &gt; least as part of ur hand luggage ... *ugh*
        &gt; &gt; Luckily silicone spray is cheap ;-) There are actually some
        types of &gt; silicone sprays that are no legal here in Norway anymore,
        due to &gt; toxicity probably. Amongst others the black 3M spray is
        impossible &gt; to get hold of here. Same with Chestertone. And since it
        seems kinda &gt; impossible to get spray from one country to another in
        any legal way &gt; it's tough luck if u live in a restrictive country.

        hear many of them do but have yet to research &gt; that. I may not at
        all. I like making my own, and call those who &gt; used the booklet that
        comes with the cube to solve it cheaters. I think that by not solving it
        for themselves the first time they they miss out on a major opportunity
        to prove something to themselves. &gt; Anyway, I do the top edges, then
        corners, then middle edges. All of &gt; those are just kind of... done.
        I don't have "steps" in my mind, I &gt; just see and do what is
        necessary. I place two middle edges, four bottom corners, the other two
        middle edges then the four bottom edges. I average between 36 and 54
        moves to solve the cube, using about 30 moves to solve the first 2
        levels. &gt; Then I have a move that switches &gt; two adjacent bottom
        corners and a move that switches both pairs of &gt; adjacent bottom
        corners. I work on the top level next. I call those switching "two
        corners adjacent" and switching "two corners across." &gt; Next, I have
        a single move that re-orients &gt; three corners, but not necessarily
        correctly the first time I use it. &gt; I may have to re-orient the cube
        itself, then do the sequence two or &gt; three more times. There are no
        orientations which require the famous seven move sequence applied more
        than twice. &gt; Then, I have a move that shuffles three bottom &gt;
        edges around. Finally, I finish up with any of three sequences that &gt;
        solve the three possible situations at that point. If I break the last
        level into four pieces I move the corners into place, reorient them,
        then reorient the edges and move the edges into place. I only use my own
        algorithms. Since I started cubing I try to do as much as possible at
        one go. I often solve the corners and flip over two edges at the same
        time. It does take time to find all 1211 last level algs, but I'm slowly
        getting there. I almost have a complete set of CLL and ELL.
        Congratulations on solving it on your own. David J

        there any (far-fetched) possibility of you offering sticker sets for

        I had asked for a bulk order on the regular one a year or two ago and do
        know that 100 is their minimum and that they will take a dollar off or
        so... For DIY kits, that would be only about $650, and you'd make the
        money right back after a couple months of sales. Perhaps this way you
        make a slight profit and we buy for the same price but have an added
        convenicne of ordering cheaper and (IMHO) better stickers, thus driving
        down shipping time and costs. Offering washers too would be nice... a
        perfect addition to DIY kits... as would Rubik's Magic wires. Eh, I

        know that's actually more like an antislice): (M' R') U' R U' R' U2 R U'
        R r'. Ha! I do the slice move at the end as two moves :-) Cheers! Stefan

        Hey (the other) Doug, I'm in the process of making some 4x4 Supercube
        now, they should be on my site by the end of next week. The Megaminx
        sets will be 12 color, but I can make 6 color sets available as well.
        Stickers for more common custom puzzles may be coming in the near
        future, depending on demand. Thanks Chris &gt; sticker set for 3x3x3 and
        4x4x4? Also, will your megaminx sticker sets &gt; be 6 or 12 color? Is
        there any (far-fetched) possibility of you &gt; offering sticker sets

        I must concur with Rob. I get my silicone lubricant from Canadian Tire.
        It carries various types in its automotive section, all across the
        country. I use Jig-A-Loo, personally:
        http://jigaloo.nulko.com/en/silicone.html It is less than $10 there,
        plus you get the handy Canadian Tire money in return. Now who doesn't

        Hi all, Today I started studying the algoritms on

        them. What do x, y, w and - mean in these algoritms? Are they layers? I
        currently only use the following layer names: R (Right), L (Left), U
        (Up/Top), D (Down/Bottom), F(Front) and B (Back). Notice that there is
        no definition for the middle layers in each orientation.

        Hello! x,y,z refers to rotating the whole cube. Whereas x points to the
        right, y towards you and z up. If you look at the java cubes you can
        surely understand how it works. But note that the java-cubes use a
        different notation than Macky does (the axis are not the same and double
        layer turns are also noted differently). Hope that helps, Mikael PS.

        Hey Koen ! My opinion is that it's easier without the _applicator sheet_
        which probably is the word u are looking for :-) If u are unlucky with
        the sheet u end up with the stickers not being straight on the cubies
        and it can be hard to reposition the whole sheet :-o. Not being straight
        u wera out the stickers with ur fingers much much faster. So i find i
        have more control doing one sticker at a time. But it sure takes a while

        Yeah I feel ya Per.. maybe I'm just lazy :D I was just thinking if there
        is a good substitute for this so-called applicator sheet that you can
        optionally use, not neccesarily supplied by CubeSmith. But I think most
        sticky material is too sticky and won't let the stickers go easily once
        applied to the cube. Removing old stickers is in some cases (eastsheen
        for example) more work than putting new ones on, so it's a
        time-consuming thing to do anyway. Greets, Koen --- In

        Hi All, I just thought that I'd mention that this confusion happens, and
        will keep happening until the community unifies notation. :P Hi Bram, I
        use Q followed by F, L, U, B, R, or D to indicate rotating the whole
        cube. Q stands for "cube" so QR means that you rotate the whole cube
        clockwise like you would rotate the Right side clockwise When the 3x3x3
        appeared David Singmaster used F, L, U, B, R, or D to indicate sides of
        the cube. I think he use ME and S to mean slices. When the 4x4x4
        appeared he used the lower case letters f, l, u, b, r, d to mean slices.
        Some immediately extended this to the 3x3x3, since the meaning of M E
        and S: Middle, Equator, and Slice do not just fall into place and have
        to be memorized. Unfortunately most of the first people online did not
        use a lot of slices. They have since coopted the lower case to mean a
        slice and a side on the 3x3x3 for "finger tricks," and screwed up very
        clean notation. They also refuse to go back to the original usage. Oh
        well. Then there are the map maker's coordinates x, y, and z. I've yet
        to see a math class that didn't have someone get confused about axes.
        Because of that confusion, and since people use x, y, and z differently,
        Chris Hardwick recently suggested replacing them. I suggested Q for
        cube, but while people were interested, they didn't have websites. I
        guess a single set of letters for turns, slices, and cube rotations is

        Hey! This discussion will keep recurring cause it's extremely bad
        notation. Easy as that. There is no consensus on what x,y,z is. Whether
        z is upwards or facing towards u and so on. The only thing that is clear
        is that when using x,y,z in algorithmic notation it means rotation about
        those respective axes. Again in which direction could cause confusion.
        So why not replace those with notation based on FRBLUD which we all
        agree on and doesn't cause any confusion? Let Rc = x, R'c = x' R2c= x2
        and so on. This also extends to other puzzles where each face has well
        defined names, like the megaminx. Most common way is to use
        A,B,C,D,E,F,a,b,c,d,e,f i guess. Physical movement of the megaminx can
        easily be defined from those facenames. Adding brackets to avoid
        confusion. So we could have c(c)3 etc etc ... How could x,y,z ever
        extend to megaminx? :-P Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        Classically, z would be upwards - but I guess that doesn't seem to &gt;
        &gt; &gt; be the case in cubing... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In any
        case, if z is upwards, y should be away from you but if y is &gt; &gt;
        &gt; upward z should be towards you (in both cases assuming x is to the

        faces could be written as a combination of x, y and z, for example z57
        x313. Not sure these numbers would work. I think it would be easiest to
        have a sequence of rotations for each face that make this face the top
        face. Then to rotate the puzzle around any face, bring that face to top,
        rotate it with a clean multiple of y72, then bring it back where it came
        from. That all said, who cares about megaminx anyway? Cheers! Stefan

        here: &gt; www.cubestation.co.uk/cross/crosstraining.html Hi Dan, that's
        really cool, thanks a lot! (Too tired to continue the game after
        training the cross so much ;-) I guess you found the optimal lengths and
        number of solutions with computer help (which program?), so maybe most
        of the other solutions are somewhat more "magical". Below I list
        solutions and comments found by another human (me). Can you give numbers
        to the cases so it's easier to talk about them? I've simply numbered
        them from 1-15. On the webpage, it would be good to hide the optimal
        lengths. When I practice this, I'd like to know afterwards whether
        there's something better, not necessarily beforehand. Thanks for all the
        work. So far it's different than what I had in mind, but I like it a lot
        as well. What I had in mind is a program that generates random
        scrambles, maybe by solving two random cubes and concatenating their
        solutions to build the scramble. That would result in good scrambles
        with about 13 moves. I wouldn't have (your) human solutions so I
        wouldn't expect to learn as easily from it, but it would give me the
        opportunity to practice as often as I want to with new scrambles all the
        time. I must admit sometimes I exceeded the 15 seconds a bit and often I
        didn't have a clear vision of the solution, so I had to follow the
        pieces closely, think and turn slowly. That's part of why I'm not yet
        able to look ahead for the first F2L pair. I'd like to practice cross
        more often and then execute with closed eyes to force myself to see the
        solution clearly. Since you never have cube rotations I guess that can't
        be the way you execute your solutions. Can you show us how you execute
        them? 1) R D' B D' L F D Yippie, I beat you in QTM ;-) 2) D' F2 D2 R D
        F' Darn... 3) Same as yours. 4) Same as yours, though I rotated the cube
        with y first. 5) Same as yours. 6) x U L U' l U y' L2 D' Slightly
        different in the end. I save a quarter turn but pay with a cube rotation
        (or alternatively a B turn). Here's one I like, too, it's a bit longer
        but easier to execute (it's more similar to yours): x U L U' l D' U2 R2
        7) L' F D B' L R' D I like yours a lot, too. Your B' start is a bit
        counter-intuitive since you turn the "correctly flipped" white/green
        edge into an incorrect one. I need to learn not to always see that as
        something bad. 8) F' B2 U R2 D' L I think I actually did (y' R' L2 D L2
        D2 F) which is slightly different, not only because of the cube
        rotation. 9) Same as yours, though I started with y. 10) y' D2 L' D' L'
        R' D' +1 in HTM but same in QTM, and only &lt;L,D,R&gt; after initial
        rotation, so I'm not too unhappy ;-) 11) R B E' L F' Ha! Shorter than
        optimal ;-) 12) y2 D' R2 U F' D L2 Another one, quite similar to yours
        but with an inserted U to save the white/green early on: D' L2 U B' D
        R2. One less B' turn. 13) y' U2 L' D' R' F' L' B' Yeah yeah, I beat you
        in QTM ;-) But it took me a long time to actually execute it because my
        vision of the alg was all but clear, probably not only because of the
        overall length but because I turn all six sides :-) 14) I screwed this
        one and in the second attempt did 8 moves but had to do it slowly.
        Sigh... This is a hard one. Though your solution makes it look so easy,
        especially after your first three moves. I think my problem was that the
        white/orange edge was almost solved and I didn't think about moving it
        away. I had tried U B L' U' F2 R2. Unfortunately the white/green wasn't
        at UR before the R2. Something like this still happens to me too often.
        15) Same as yours, but with a different order in the middle where we
        solve each piece individually: F' R' L B L2. You seem to switch between
        right and left areas of action. That's all for now... thanks again!
        Cheers! Stefan

        Hi Dan, Suppose, there exists an optimal five mover for the cross.
        During the inspection time you get sight of a six mover, which you can
        execute more or less blindly. Would you still, whith a reasonable
        probability, find that five mover? (That is, in practical game). R -----

        &gt; would give me the opportunity to practice as often as I want to
        with &gt; new scrambles all the time. &gt; &gt; I must admit sometimes I
        exceeded the 15 seconds a bit and often I &gt; didn't have a clear
        vision of the solution, so I had to follow the &gt; pieces closely,
        think and turn slowly. That's part of why I'm not yet &gt; able to look
        ahead for the first F2L pair. I'd like to practice cross &gt; more often
        and then execute with closed eyes to force myself to see &gt; the
        solution clearly. Since you never have cube rotations I guess that &gt;
        can't be the way you execute your solutions. Can you show us how you
        &gt; execute them? &gt; &gt; 1) R D' B D' L F D &gt; Yippie, I beat you
        in QTM ;-) &gt; &gt; 2) D' F2 D2 R D F' &gt; Darn... &gt; &gt; 3) Same
        as yours. &gt; &gt; 4) Same as yours, though I rotated the cube with y
        first. &gt; &gt; 5) Same as yours. &gt; &gt; 6) x U L U' l U y' L2 D'
        &gt; Slightly different in the end. I save a quarter turn but pay with a
        &gt; cube rotation (or alternatively a B turn). Here's one I like, too,
        &gt; it's a bit longer but easier to execute (it's more similar to
        yours): &gt; x U L U' l D' U2 R2 &gt; &gt; 7) L' F D B' L R' D &gt; I
        like yours a lot, too. Your B' start is a bit counter-intuitive &gt;
        since you turn the "correctly flipped" white/green edge into an &gt;
        incorrect one. I need to learn not to always see that as something &gt;
        bad. &gt; &gt; 8) F' B2 U R2 D' L &gt; I think I actually did (y' R' L2
        D L2 D2 F) which is slightly &gt; different, not only because of the
        cube rotation. &gt; &gt; 9) Same as yours, though I started with y. &gt;
        &gt; 10) y' D2 L' D' L' R' D' &gt; +1 in HTM but same in QTM, and only
        &lt;L,D,R&gt; after initial rotation, so &gt; I'm not too unhappy ;-)
        &gt; &gt; 11) R B E' L F' &gt; &gt; Ha! Shorter than optimal ;-) &gt;
        &gt; 12) y2 D' R2 U F' D L2 &gt; Another one, quite similar to yours but
        with an inserted U to save the &gt; white/green early on: D' L2 U B' D
        R2. One less B' turn. &gt; &gt; 13) y' U2 L' D' R' F' L' B' &gt; Yeah
        yeah, I beat you in QTM ;-) But it took me a long time to &gt; actually
        execute it because my vision of the alg was all but clear, &gt; probably
        not only because of the overall length but because I turn all &gt; six
        sides :-) &gt; &gt; 14) I screwed this one and in the second attempt did
        8 moves but had &gt; to do it slowly. Sigh... This is a hard one. Though
        your solution &gt; makes it look so easy, especially after your first
        three moves. I &gt; think my problem was that the white/orange edge was
        almost solved and &gt; I didn't think about moving it away. I had tried
        U B L' U' F2 R2. &gt; Unfortunately the white/green wasn't at UR before
        the R2. Something &gt; like this still happens to me too often. &gt;
        &gt; 15) Same as yours, but with a different order in the middle where
        we &gt; solve each piece individually: F' R' L B L2. You seem to switch
        &gt; between right and left areas of action. &gt; &gt; That's all for
        now... thanks again! &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hey Rune, If in the inspection time, I would see a 6-move cross, which
        was easy to execute, I would definitely stick with it. I would then use
        the rest of the inspection time to try and imagine where my first F2L
        pair would be, that way right after the cross I could go seamlessly
        straight into the F2L. Of course, I wouldn't know that the 5-mover
        existed if I didn't search for it and see it, so I wouldn't really have
        to make a decision "between the two". Dan :) --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Dan, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that's really cool,
        thanks a lot! (Too tired to continue the game &gt; &gt; after training
        the cross so much ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess you found the optimal
        lengths and number of solutions with &gt; &gt; computer help (which
        program?), so maybe most of the other solutions &gt; &gt; are somewhat
        more "magical". Below I list solutions and comments found &gt; &gt; by
        another human (me). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can you give numbers to the
        cases so it's easier to talk about them? &gt; &gt; I've simply numbered
        them from 1-15. On the webpage, it would be good &gt; &gt; to hide the
        optimal lengths. When I practice this, I'd like to know &gt; &gt;
        afterwards whether there's something better, not necessarily &gt; &gt;
        beforehand. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for all the work. So far it's
        different than what I had in &gt; &gt; mind, but I like it a lot as
        well. What I had in mind is a program &gt; &gt; that generates random
        scrambles, maybe by solving two random cubes and &gt; &gt; concatenating
        their solutions to build the scramble. That would result &gt; &gt; in

        Going to buy myself some ice cream ;-) Just finished learning OLL. Being
        able to always solve the LL in two looks feels great :-) Never thought I
        would be able to learn this method after seeing it for the first time 23
        years ago. It took me almost a year. F2L is done intuitively, started
        doing this at the European Championships afterparty. Now most of the
        times I solve the cube within 60 moves. Next step is to drop my average
        time under 30 seconds. -Arjan --- In

        think this is perfect for any cuber to put on his desk. Leyan --- In

        do this. do a F then a 3-cycle to see some COLL. or a B then a 3 cycle.
        also try doing a F, then do the T permutation, you will see a nice alg
        from the 1211 rose palmers. practice that way, you will be able to see
        certain situations were you can do either a F, B, B' or F' and a certain
        permutation to fix oritentation and permutation at once. good luck! ---

        intuitively, started &gt; doing this at the &gt; European Championships

        first hand &gt; experience. This idea &gt; &gt; &gt; that Joel
        suggested, about not timing yourself &gt; for a bit and just &gt; &gt;
        &gt; concentrating on going slowly and looking ahead &gt; during the F2L
        is &gt; &gt; &gt; sound. I had read people offer the advice &gt; before,
        but it is &gt; &gt; &gt; difficult to comprehend when you are first &gt;
        starting. You see other &gt; &gt; &gt; cubers flying through the F2L and
        feel you need &gt; to go as fast as you &gt; &gt; &gt; can to try and
        keep pace (which you won't &gt; anyway). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Since Joel was nice enough to offer me some good &gt; tips, I took him
        &gt; &gt; &gt; seriously and did exactly that for most of this &gt; week
        ï¿½ didn't time &gt; &gt; &gt; myself, and only concentrated on solving
        the F2L &gt; without stopping, &gt; &gt; &gt; no matter how slowly it
        felt I was going. After &gt; only 3 days of &gt; &gt; &gt; doing that, I
        could feel I was finding the &gt; pieces better. So I did &gt; &gt; &gt;
        an average last night, and I already dropped &gt; nearly 2 seconds from
        &gt; &gt; &gt; my average. Sub 30 here I come! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Very nice Richard! I really liked your story, especially your false
        identity ;) It all very much brings back my thoughts when I started
        cubing. I think most speedcubers find similarities with their own
        experiences. I've come a little further in my journey than you Sachin.
        I'm sure you will hit sub-30 but, it can take time. I had already lost
        hope for keeping my average that low (my PB was 29.37 seconds done in
        February) but only a week ago I took a quantum leap forward, now my PB
        is 26.62 and I again dream of sub-20 averages :) Happy cubing, Mikael

        I received an email from a cuber who'd used my beginner solution to
        learn the basics and who is now interested in learning a 3-look LL. I
        thought Dan Knights' advanced solution
        &lt;http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/Advanced.html&gt; was
        very good for learning the 3-look LL, but Dan K's site has been down for
        quite a while now. Can anyone recommend another good 3-look LL site? If
        I had more time then I'd create one myself, but unfortunately I don't
        have time at the moment. I'm hoping that someone can point me in the
        direction of an existing 3-look LL site. :) Thanks, Jasmine

        hey, For a three look last layer, you can use any set of LL algorythms.
        Just use only the ones you need for orientation, and all of them for
        permutation. So I would recomend looking around at alot of different
        algorithm sites to find which ones fit best, as opposed to just learning
        them from a single site (my mistake). Hope that helps -Evan Until next

        Yeah, this is true, I just thought that it would be easier to email him
        a 3-look LL site if one existed (like Dan K's old site), rather than a
        selection of different sites where the 3-look LL stuff could be sourced.
        Anyway, I ended up sending the guy a couple of sites and specifying
        which algs on each site would be needed for each of the 3 steps (orient
        edges, orient corners, permute all). Jasmine

        Hi all, Where can I find details on how to start a cube, before applying
        the F2L algoritms? I have visited several pages, but still haven't found
        a decent explanation on how to start. I assume you all know where I can
        find this info, so please help me find it too. - Bram

        informing us (or reminding us) &gt; &gt; of what he is doing. No doubt
        it is very interesting -- a single case &gt; &gt; he mentioned a while
        back was intriguing because of its symmetry and &gt; &gt; depth. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Mike &gt; &gt; These refer back to posts somewhere around

        Tchus Stefan! Tonight I finally joined you in solving a 5x5x5 supercube
        blindfolded! It was not by any means my first attempt at this type of
        solve as I have had a few really heartbreaking near misses in the past
        couple of months. I had my system figured out just before Christmas but
        have only just now managed to execute the entire solution flawlessly.
        Memorization is really quite easy. What tripped me up was the length of
        the solution. One must be absolutely perfect and over the course of such
        a long solution there are many opportunities for even just a little slip
        up which will, of course, ruin the whole enterprise. It is indeed an
        unforgiving style of cubing but its rewards are correspondingly high
        when successful :) I memorize and solve the beast in the same order as
        follows: stage 1 - solve the orientations (centers, corners, middle
        edges) stage 2 - solve the 3x3x3 pieces (corners and middle edges) stage
        3 - solve the x centers stage 4 - solve the outer edges stage 5 - solve
        the + centers. The center / middle edge / corner parity is discovered
        immediately by analyzing the centercaps. It is dealt with as I memorize
        the information before step 1. The outedges / + center parity is only
        identified when I memorize step 4. When present it influences how I
        approach step 5 and is finally solved as the last task of the solution.
        One of the real regrets about blindsolving big cubes is not being able
        to see the cube gradually approach completion from chaos. In order to
        get even some small pleasure out of this I blindly point my digital
        camera towards my cube at the end of each stage of the solve. (This is
        also useful for trying to figure out where things went wrong on
        unsuccessful solves). Some of the pictures are a little blurry and they
        are all (except for the very beginning and very end) off center as it
        was very much a matter of guessing what angle to point the camera. I
        always blindsolve with BLUE facing me and WHITE on top. I took three
        photos for every stage of the solve - from straight on, from the left
        side, from the right side. I have uploaded them to the photos section
        under the folder "profblind" if anyone is interested in seeing them. You
        will notice that my supercube is not anywhere near as nice looking as
        Stefan's or Chris' new stickers. It is basically just a regular 5x5x5
        painted with nailpolish and with the centers identified by dots
        indicting 1-9 like they appear on playing cards or dice. Now that such
        beautiful supercube stickers are available to us I will be getting in
        touch with Chris in the very near future to purchase real supercube
        stickers. I will be returning home to Toronto at the very start of June
        after I finish my summer courses at the U of Manitoba. I intend to write
        up a full and detailed account of my method including the algs used for
        each step and much more accurate details on the parity solution but this
        will need to wait 10 days until the start of my summer vacation. Happy
        cubing, Rob

        "good bye" to me? Why, because my time is over? Hehe ;-) &gt; Tonight I
        finally joined you in solving a 5x5x5 supercube &gt; blindfolded! Yeah,
        great! Congratulations! I do remember your almost-successes you've
        mentioned before, glad you finally made it! One thing I do to prevent
        mistakes is to never in setup moves do something like (Rr) when actually
        I want (r) only, just because (Rr) is faster to execute. I did it a
        while ago and when undoing the setup moves I often wondered whether I
        had to undo (Rr) or (r). Now I always know. Rules are good, thinking is
        bad ;-) I solve both parities this way: For each type of piece I have an
        "error pair" on the U-layer, e.g. Urf and Ufl for the X-centers. In case
        of a parity problem, I make sure that it's this pair (or in case of
        centers, the U center) is wrong. Usually it takes two 3-cycles to solve
        my last piece and break the error pair. Then at the very end, I apply up
        to two algs, one for each parity. I solve all centers first, then outer
        edges, then middle edges, then corners. I think this way the layer steps
        have a smaller chance of destroying the first (particularly solving the
        corners will never destroy the centers or the edge triples, since I only
        use outer-layer twists) and thus if I make a mistake there then at least
        I can see parts of my cube solved :-) Cheers! Stefan

        Hi Jasmine (from Down Under?)! You (and others) might be interested in
        the "original Hungarian" or Ideal made cubes. Those have orange stickers
        with a good light reflective glue that lasts much longer than the glue
        of other stickers. Orange stickers practically never peel off. Does
        anybody has an experience with tiled cubes made few years ago? I only
        find Rubik's Cube Deluxe Edition made in 1980 for $76 at
        http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=1247 I thought that
        tiled cubes are in production and available for something like $15 but
        it seems not to be true any more. Mirek --- In

        If you want thick tiles like the Deluxe cube then have a look at the
        Mefferts website. I'm waiting for mine and I hope the "adhesive sheets"
        I have will work great for applying the tiles to puzzles. I hate super
        glue for that. It's just ugly and I can't take them off again if I want
        or need to and it's just ugly. Mmh, gotta ask them about my tiles,
        they're kinda very late... Will let you know about my experiences when I
        get them. Cheers! Stefan --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Mirek On www.cubesmith.com you can order 'tiles' which are not tiles
        like on the deluxe cube, but thin adhesive pieces of vinyl - I have them
        and they are really amazing. They won't fade or peel like stickers tend
        to do, and they have a very nice feel to them. bryan On May 25, 2005, at

        algorithms, it is much better to work out how to do this yourself. Most
        of the cases are quite simple to work out, and thinking about it
        yourself will help your Cube understanding... which is (almost!)
        necessary for you to make easy progress. Really that is just common
        sense, but it is emphasized especially in J Fridrich's description of
        her own method. Good luck. Mike

        If you want to begin and to have a good comprehension of the cube, You
        should start by trying to build seral patterns on your cube : 1. A cross
        (with edges) 2. A complete layer 3. A complete layer with all the pieces
        well placed (the collors on the side are well placed) 4. Place correctly
        all the edges on the first two layers (without the corners on the first
        layer) 5. Place correctly all the edges on the whole cube 6. Try to find
        a way to build completely the first two layers 7. Try to orientate the
        top edges when the F2L are complete 8. Try to orientate the top corners
        correctly with the F2L and the top cross correctly placed This will take
        you some time to figure out how to do that, but if you can do that :
        you'll only have to learn the PLL of the Fridrich method (you can try to
        find them too :p). But you should be able to do 1, 2 3 and 4 quite
        shortly. For the 5 and the 6 : it's possible too, but you have to have
        faith : it's possible. Then the 7 and the 8th are quite easy if you have
        a good vision of the cube. Good luck ! --- In

        Hi Bram, Why not decide what color you want for the First Layer and the
        Last Layer, so that you can easily recognize what pieces are where? The
        better you can see the location of the next pieces to place the faster
        you can be. Cheers, David J --- In

        I recommend picking one color and making that color always the first
        layer. Some people have that color on top, but most have it on bottom
        [or the side]. I used to have it on top, but switched to the bottom a
        few months ago. I always use White first, which means yellow is always
        my last layer [remember, the center pieces never move relative to each
        other, they just spin around]. I haven't taken a poll or anything, but I
        think white's a pretty common pick, probably the most common. Next step
        is just do the cross on the white side, then go into the F2L algs to
        complete the first 2 layers. If you're trying to decipher an alg and not
        sure if you are performing the moves correctly, one suggestion is to
        start with a solved cube [take yours apart and put it back together
        solved if you have to], and perform the alg from the solved state and
        then note what changed. sometimes that helps me understand the algs
        better. good luck. stick with it--it's worth the effort. --Kirk --- In

        I used to solve with cross on top, and that's how I was solving when I
        initally wrote the beginner solution page

        However, I agree that it's better to solve with cross on bottom rather
        than on top. I should update my beginner solution with some comments

        generally solve like this: - cross: mostly on left (yes, I'm

        Hi! I would actually like to expand a bit on ur point 6 in the list.
        Otherwise i think the list is quite ok. It will take a while to figure
        out all of that but it's really worth it. It surely will enhance the
        understanding of "how the cube works" :-) I'd suggest to break up 6 like
        this: 6a) Figure out how to make complete first 2 layers except that 1
        corner is missing (working corner) 6b) Figure out how to make complete
        first 2 layers except that 1 edge of the middle layer is missing
        (working edge) 6c) Now figure out from either a) or b) how the heck to
        do the last corner or edge. This will make up a complete first 2 layers,
        leaving only the last layer (the remaining points on the list).
        Mastering 6a and/or 6b should make the step from 5 to 6 (6c) a bit
        easier :-) Have fun cubing! -Per &gt; --- In

        I've seen about six different ones. The Gyro Cube is the only high

        of the centers are flat. There are several which are OK in terms of
        being light, but avoid the ones with flash still on the tiles. "Old
        Brand Magic Square" cube is terrible. Though Stefan P likes their

        Hi Bram, Art here. Like you I had this problem on how to start. First
        off as others might have told you already, you might want to choose
        whether you want to start solving the cube from the top to bottom (or
        vise versa) or left to right (or vise versa) or from front to back (or
        vise versa). When you have done this, to use the F2L you must make a
        cross or a plus pattern using the edges of the whatever side you want to
        solve using F2L. Then when you have done the F2L next is the Last Layer
        which are the Orientation of the Last Layer (OLL) and Permutation of the
        Last Layer (PLL) I use the cross at the bottom the doing the F2L then
        OLL then PLL or if I am lucky and know the PLL of the top pattern I can
        just skip OLL. I hope this helps you in making your current time faster
        or solving the cube. Please try looking at other sites or other styles
        of solving the cube. -----Original Message----- From:

        too long for 3x3s, though. Also, I do like the thin plastic for modding,
        i.e. building new puzzles from existing ones. I'm actually building a
        puzzle from an even cheaper clone that doesn't have springs and is
        probably really crap to play with (though I won't know for sure because
        I haven't even sanded/lubed it). It does have a great property, though,
        but I'll keep it secret for now. Maybe one day I'll add a "puzzle

        are first starting. You see other &gt; &gt; &gt; cubers flying through
        the F2L and feel you need to go as fast as you &gt; &gt; &gt; can to try
        and keep pace (which you won't anyway). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Since Joel was nice enough to offer me some good tips, I took him &gt;
        &gt; &gt; seriously and did exactly that for most of this week  didn't
        time &gt; &gt; &gt; myself, and only concentrated on solving the F2L
        without stopping, &gt; &gt; &gt; no matter how slowly it felt I was
        going. After only 3 days of &gt; &gt; &gt; doing that, I could feel I
        was finding the pieces better. So I did &gt; &gt; &gt; an average last

        If x and y are elements of the cube group (moves), define the sequence
        C_n(x,y) for n=0,1,2,3,... by C_0(x,y)=e (the identity element)
        C_{n+1}(x,y)=C_n(x,y)x^{-n}y^{-n}x^ny^n in other words C_n(x,y) times
        the commutator x^{-n}y^{-n}x^ny^n. Then for some n&gt;0, C_n(x,y)=e. Let
        the minimal such n be c(x,y). Here's the problem: what's c, the largest
        c(x,y) can be (by choosing x,y appropriately). It's easy to get an upper
        bound for this problem. Maybe it's quite easy - I've just come up with
        it so I've not given it any thought. (More generally, for any group with
        finite exponent c will be finite.)

        I'd wondered what "finite exponent" meant. Actually "i.e." was wrong
        there - finite exponent is a stronger condition than this but it does
        imply that every element has finite order. (If every element has finite
        order then each N(x,y) would be finite, but to get that the set of
        N(x,y)s is bounded wouldn't necessarily follow without finite exponent).
        The exponent of a group is the LCM of the orders of all the elements (in
        particular it implies that every element has finite order, but every
        element having finite order does not imply the exponent is finite). The
        exponent is always finite for finite groups though - the order of the
        group would work.

        done so far is about 38 secs. Making up my own scrambles may be slowing

        I strongly believe that there are numerous systems that can be as fast
        and maybe faster than the Fridrich system. Gilles and his innovative
        approaches are a good example. I also believe that the average times
        will "asymptotically" converge to the same number for a variety of
        systems once they are perfected to a certain level. This is because 1.
        there is a limit on how many algorithms an ordinary human mind can keep
        in memory and actively use (i.e., sufficiently fast recall from memory),
        2. with a growing number of algorithms, recognition time naturally
        grows, and thus more and more algorithms will not necessarily mean
        faster times, 3. most importantly, if you watch the fastest cubers,
        their mind and fingers work "in parallel". Fingers push the faces while
        mind is occupied with recognizing the next position. They seem to be in
        a balanced state of continuous twisting, when increasing the twisting
        speed will not lead to faster times unless the recognition improves too
        (this is, of course not true for the LLP). Jessica

        Just wanted to share... Yesterday I got a new best average of 10 time:
        34.22s 40.62s, 30.17s, 34.97s, 31.48s, (27.95s), 42.44s, 30.96s, 30.11s,
        (42.53s), 34.17s, 30.94s, 36.32s And this morning I did my first average
        with all 12 solves sub-40s. 39.05, 32.99, 38.42, 31.54, 36.20, 36.55,
        35.06, (39.93), 38.66, (30.02), 35.43, 39.93 Also, I reckon I can now
        comfortably say that my _real_ average is now sub-40s. I've done 64
        solves this weekend with an overall average of 36.95s. And the last few
        cubing sessions I've done (totally hundreds of solves) have all had
        averages sub-40s. :) BTW, timing and scrambles were done with JNetCube.

        I put together a white DIY with the centers of a black DIY and I've been
        using it exclusively ever since. I used the white center caps and had to
        use superglue for them since they don't have any other way of fitting to
        the black center, but that's the only rigging it's had. I initially
        lubed it and found it to be much too slick for me to control, so i
        washed it off and it's still slicker than I was ever able to make my
        black DIY. I'm also thinking the white doesn't break itself in as fast
        as the black does in that the dirty looking dust isn't showing up as
        much as my black ones. For me, I like this because my cube came out
        great from the start (after removing the lube), so I'm hoping it will
        have a longer life before the corners become too loose and jiggly. Was
        there ever a definitive answer to this being a legal cube? It is
        somewhat canabalized from two Rubik's products and there is no way of
        seeing a difference without taking it apart. I do like this cube.

        &gt; Stefan Not exactly: if [x,y] denotes the commutator of x and y then
        we're looking at the sequence: C_0=e C_1=e[x,y] C_2=e[x,y][x^2,y^2]
        C_3=e[x,y][x^2,y^2][x^3,y^3] ... C_{n+1}=C_n[x^{n+1},y^{n+1}] [x^n,y^n]
        is the identity (when n is the least common multiple of the orders of x
        and y, for example). Then [x^{n+1},y^{n+1}]=[x,y] and so C_{n+1}=C-nC_1
        in this situtation. Similarly, C_{n+k}=C_nC_k and so C_{nm}=(C_n)^m.
        Also, C_{nm-1}=C_{nm} so C_{nm-1}=(C_n)^m. (C_n)^m=e for some

        What method are you using. The best I have done is a 44.22 average and a

        AM Subject: [Speed cubing group] Finally cracked sub-40s as a *real*
        average (and sub-35s as a best average)! Just wanted to share...
        Yesterday I got a new best average of 10 time: 34.22s 40.62s, 30.17s,
        34.97s, 31.48s, (27.95s), 42.44s, 30.96s, 30.11s, (42.53s), 34.17s,
        30.94s, 36.32s And this morning I did my first average with all 12
        solves sub-40s. 39.05, 32.99, 38.42, 31.54, 36.20, 36.55, 35.06,
        (39.93), 38.66, (30.02), 35.43, 39.93 Also, I reckon I can now
        comfortably say that my _real_ average is now sub-40s. I've done 64
        solves this weekend with an overall average of 36.95s. And the last few
        cubing sessions I've done (totally hundreds of solves) have all had
        averages sub-40s. :) BTW, timing and scrambles were done with JNetCube.
        Happy day! :) Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com

        Hi Peter, I use a pretty standard 3-look LL method... cross (always
        white), F2L pairs, orient edges, orient corners, permute all. My best
        single solve is 23.12s. I can get sub-30s times, but not very often. Of
        the 64 cubes I did this weekend, only 2 were sub-30s. Although 6 were
        *almost* sub-30s (i.e. 6 solves were 30.xx) so I'm definitely improving!

        &gt; &gt; jerry rigging or bodging. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; David J &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Three weeks ago I put together a white DIY with the centers of
        a &gt; black DIY and I've been using it exclusively ever since. I used
        the &gt; white center caps and had to use superglue for them since they
        don't &gt; have any other way of fitting to the black center, but that's
        the &gt; only rigging it's had. I initially lubed it and found it to be
        much &gt; too slick for me to control, so i washed it off and it's still
        &gt; slicker than I was ever able to make my black DIY. I'm also &gt;
        thinking the white doesn't break itself in as fast as the black does
        &gt; in that the dirty looking dust isn't showing up as much as my black
        &gt; ones. For me, I like this because my cube came out great from the
        &gt; start (after removing the lube), so I'm hoping it will have a &gt;
        longer life before the corners become too loose and jiggly. &gt; &gt;
        Was there ever a definitive answer to this being a legal cube? &gt; It
        is somewhat canabalized from two Rubik's products and there is no &gt;
        way of seeing a difference without taking it apart. I do like this &gt;
        cube. The white caps are making up for the center cubies being smaller?
        How did you tune the cube with the centers off? Would you check and see
        if your black DIY parts are smaller than the white DIY parts? TIA, David
        J

        &gt; The white caps are making up for the center cubies being smaller?
        How &gt; did you tune the cube with the centers off? &gt; Not at all,
        the two centers are the same size. The white cap's edges are flush with
        the black center. The only way of seeing they weren't made for each
        other, other than the obvious color difference, is that the ridge on the
        back of the white cap is farther inboard than the black's inside is
        thick. Maybe that's a bad explanation, I'm saying the white cap can't be
        put onto the black center and remain on it's own by simply pressing it
        on, it must be glued. Conversely, the black cap's ridge would have be
        cut or shaved off to fit onto the white center, then of course glued to
        remain. &gt; Would you check and see if your black DIY parts are smaller
        than the &gt; white DIY parts? &gt; The cubies are all the same size.
        They are obviously made from different molds, but I've mixed them
        together on both black rounded centers and the white flat centers and
        the cubies all interact fine. Turning the mixed cubes, I can feel a
        difference in that not all turns feel as smooth, but I think it's
        attributed to the difference in the white and black plastics, not the
        fitting of the pieces. Matt

        Nice Report Bob, it was a real pleasure to meet you, and thanks for
        showing me how to do the magic, (even if it takes me about 5 seconds).
        It was really awesome meeting everyone, and the friendly competition
        brough out my best average so far, 20.xx during the second round. (until
        i got paired up with Macky for the final round, and lost it completely)
        I'm really looking forward to cubing with you all again, and Ian...you
        rock. Thanks, Joe Spadafora (also, for anyone who liked the shirt i was

        Hi Matt, I understood you explanation just fine. Thanks for checking the

        Hi all, I'm really enjoying reading about the tournament since I didn't
        get to see much of it myself so keep those reports and pictures coming!
        I've got 4 hours of video to sift through and I'm looking for people to
        host some clips from the tournament. If you've got some space on your
        website, please e-mail me privately and let me know how much space you
        have. I'll post to the group once videos are up. I really enjoyed the
        weekend (despite some serious sleep deprivation) and it was great seeing
        some old friends and making some new ones. The competition was even
        better than I expected with numerous world and American records set. Six
        of the eight finalists averaged sub-20 in the finals! This event
        wouldn't have happened without the efforts of a bunch of people so a
        great big thank you to: All the competitors for making the trip to New
        York (in particular to Tyson, Ryan, Macky, Chris H., and Rich for
        traveling so far). The Horace Mann School for the use of their
        facilities. Winning-Moves for donating prizes. cubesmith.com for
        donating stickers for all the competitors. Tyson for scrambling,
        judging, organizing, and a million other things. Jason for doing all
        things excel and for entering the 4x4 competition moments after learning
        the parity algs. HM volunteers (Marco, Aram - did anyone recognize him
        as the young Ben Stiller from the Royal Tannenbaums?, Fran, Eleanor,
        Johnny, Amanda and a few others whose names I've forgotten (sorry!)) for
        judging and other important stuff. Jeremy for filming. Maria, Laura, and
        Alison for running the concession stand. Peter for technical support. My
        wife Theresa for single-handedly running the BBQube. Everyone else who
        scrambled, judged, or helped out in any way. All in all, I was very
        pleased with the event. Now it's time to get back to reality and start
        grading 102 final exams. :) Ian Winokur

        Most of us are like that. I'm not a very good one-handed cuber, but I'm
        right handed and I cube one-handed with my left hand. Other notable

        I have always felt more comfortable cubing with my left hand than my
        right. I imagine I can solve it at least 30 seconds or so faster with my
        left hand than my right. ~ Bob

        Hey everybody! For a while now I've been working on improving my methods
        for solving the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 two different ways, or what I like to
        call a "multisolve". For those who aren't familiar with this, I'll
        explain: the 4x4x4 can be scrambled as a 2x2x2 or a 3x3x3, and the 5x5x5
        can be scrambled as a 3x3x3 in two different ways. By scrambling the
        puzzle first one way and then the other, and then solving in reverse
        order, the puzzle becomes a "custom" 2x2x2 or 3x3x3 that has different
        "pieces" every time. Especially challenging are the two cases that
        require orienting the centers in the first stage of the solve. I will
        refer to these as the "hard" cases, and the other two as the "easy"
        cases. I find multisolves to be very fun, and also quite addictive to
        try to improve on, because of the greater challenges they provide in
        piece recognition. Because speedcubing.com has records from only 3 or 4
        other people in these categories, I must assume that few people have
        ever tried multisolves, probably because they never even considered
        them. It would be great to get some more people interested, and compare
        times and methods. Anyway, here are my best times for all four types:
        4x4x4 easy case (scramble as 3x3x3, then as 2x2x2) 1:15.84 4x4x4 hard
        case (scramble as 2x2x2, then as 3x3x3) 2:24.77 5x5x5 easy case
        (scramble using only outer layers, then both layers) 1:45.95 5x5x5 hard
        case (scramble using both layers, then only outer layers) 2:45.06 Except
        for the 4x4x4 easy case, these times are by far the fastest I know of.
        While that's great, it simply doesn't seem right when you consider that
        multisolves are basically 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 solves, and there are dozens
        of active members in this group alone who can beat me in those
        categories by a wide margin. So, in order to rectify this: I DARE anyone
        to beat my times! That should do it. Now to sit back and await my
        comeuppance, which will no doubt be arriving shortly. -Ben B.

        easy case &gt; (scramble using only outer layers, then both layers) &gt;
        1:45.95 2:11.55 (2) &gt; 4x4x4 easy case &gt; (scramble as 3x3x3, then
        as 2x2x2) &gt; 1:15.84 1:05.49 (1) &gt; 4x4x4 hard case &gt; (scramble
        as 2x2x2, then as 3x3x3) &gt; 2:24.77 8:22.43 (1) The first 1.5 minutes
        or so I had no idea what to do ;-) &gt; 5x5x5 hard case &gt; (scramble
        using both layers, then only outer layers) &gt; 2:45.06 7:26.68 (1) This
        is truly fun :-) Once you get to the second phase it's such a relief...
        I know I've seen them on SCC but I can't find them anymore. Where are
        they? Cheers! Stefan

        &gt; David J Nice David, that's really the simplest. This reminds me an
        idea I had a few years ago (and I'm certainly not the only one), you
        could solve the F2L following this algorithm: 1) Solve the first layer.
        2) Solve 2 middle edges (neighbours). If you assume that at least a
        middle edge already lies in the last layer, and considering symetries,
        the number of sequences needed is really small. Some would look like
        Waterman's, others can be enhanced for speed. 3) Solve the last 2 middle
        edges. I don't think this strategy can be better than the standard
        approach, only in special cases when the first layer looks easy. But you
        certainly can solve the F2L in less than 10s and I'd be curious to see
        someone optimize it for speed... Gilles.

        particularly loose but it is much better than it once was. I suggest you
        turn a slice through 45 degrees and spray the exposed innards. You'll be
        able to hit either one side of 2 slices or 1 side of 2 slices and 2
        sides of a third, depending which slice (outer or inner) you rotate. Do
        this for several slices and slice them back in. This will get the spray
        inside. I used this technique on my 4x4x4 and my 5x5x5.

        Think with blocks instead of sides. It looked like a case where you have
        to break things already built to create a free space, and reinsert them
        the same way, or in another way. (r'Uru) takes the B-BR-BRD-BD 1x2x2
        block out of the F2L and moves it to a safe place. (Bu'B') puts it back
        in another way, changing unsafe middle edges. It works like
        (R'URU)(BU'B), but with a block. I found that (R'U'R) between the two
        (change a few things in the free space) answers the problem. Based on
        this, you can build similar sequences: - (r'Uru)(BUB'U')(Bu'B') -
        (r'Uru)(R'U2R)(Bu'B') - (BuB')(BUB'U')(Bu'B') = BuUB'U'Bu'B' changes
        only 1 edge, but I like it more than other shorter sequences. - etc.
        When dealing with partial F2L, I mean 2*1x2x3, more optimizations can be
        found. I admit that's not very scientifical :-) Gilles.

        You juggle two cubes in one hand, then solve the third cube in the other
        hand. Then you just switch off the cubes with some type of cross throw
        and you repeat until all cubes are solved. Then you proceed to get
        another four cubes, so you juggle all 7 cubes, you do a db97531, and
        then you're done. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology

        I just had an idea. What would happen if I taught someone how to solve a
        cube with their eyes open but with the blindfold method? In fact, I was
        even thinking about teaching them how to permute first and orient later,
        because with your eyes open, orientations are easy to spot once the
        pieces are in place. I've got someone who wants to learn... I'm thinking
        about using her as a guinea pig. Just think about it. And then like,
        after they've learned, you just say... oh btw... just limit yourself to
        these set up moves, change the order in which you do things and... uh,

        lot. &gt; - (BuB')(BUB'U')(Bu'B') = BuUB'U'Bu'B' changes only 1 edge,
        but I like &gt; it more than other shorter sequences. How about this
        one? R U' M' U R' U' M It's basically (R U' R') (r U R' U' M), I found
        that second part recently when I tried to get rid of cube rotations and
        F turns for that case. Actually I'd execute the combination as (R U' r
        R' U R' U' R r'). If you start with left thumb on F and right thumb on D
        then it's quite fast. Mmh, actually then (R U' l' U R' U' l) feels nice,
        too... But I'd certainly prefer my new one if the LL corners look good,
        since they're not changed. Hmm, another thought. Inverses. Try (r R' U R

        me with the idea, I just had to try it. ;) &gt; &gt; Just had to share.
        Thanks for sharing. From my point of view (I'm a beginner), that's
        really impressive! A video? Gilles. PS: I don't feel proud when I'm
        juggling, but well, I don't care, having fun :-)

        about F2L. So you &gt; change *more* pieces: One more 2nd layer edge and
        if you hold the cube &gt; like you suggested then also a 1st layer edge
        :-) &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan Hi Stefan, I wrote, &gt; To watch it
        work put the First Level on the left and the Last Level on the right (or
        vice-versa) and the middle pair to be flipped and swapped on the bottom.
        &lt; "Vice versa" means you can have the FL on the right, and therefore
        it doesn't have to change any edge on the First Level. Besides, I do the
        F2L differently from you. To swap two edges you must swap either two
        other edges or two corners minimum. My "flip two edges and swap them,"
        only swapped two other edges - that is minimum. r U r U' r' U r' U'
        makes fewer changes than his &gt; R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 y2 z M U M U M U2 M' U
        M' U M' U2 &lt; which additionally changes the position of four corners
        and two edges. My statement is accurate. :) Cheers, David J

        I'd like to get on to speedcubing, but I gotta be able to solve it
        first. Down the road maybe. In any case, I can complete the first 2
        layers and make the cross on the final layer with no problems. I
        position the cube with the cross up. I've got the final layer edges
        positioned as well. This leaves 4 corners on the final layer. 1 of the 4
        is in the correct position (but not oriented correctly). Using any
        number of sites (4 to be exact), I am left with the same results each
        time. When I try to position the 3 remaining LL corners into their
        respective corners, I get an out of place corner on the bottom layer. If
        I position the cross up and the correct position corner piece in the
        Upper Right Corner, and then apply U R U' L' U R' U' L, I get the back
        bottom corner out of color. If I repeat the same move 2 more times, I'll

        I decided to try something. in Jess Bonde's Timer, it shows a scrambling

        could mix up a cube. my first time was 11.67 I think, and I reduced it
        so far to 8.69 seconds. I'm sure that with practice I could get under 8

        practice because you have to figure out how to do random moves really
        fast and make them flow together really well without locking up and all

        I can't make out exactly where you are in the solve, but the last layer
        algoritms you can use would be: Positioning corners: Put good corner in
        UFR position and apply R2 D' L R' F2 R L' U2 D R2 You might have to do
        this twice. If you dont have any good corners, just apply the algoritm
        and you will get one. Rotating corners: Put wrong corner in UFR position
        To rotate clockwise, apply F D F' D' F D F' D' To rotate
        counterclockwise, apply D F D' F' D F D' F' Turn U until you have
        another wrong corner in UFR position (Keep the rest of the cube in the
        same position!!!!!!!) and apply algoritm. Repeat until all corners are
        correct. I am not a speedcuber myself, but this works for me. Good luck
        solving the cube. - Bram -----Oorspronkelijk bericht----- Van:

        cubing group] Last Layer Corner Piece Position I'd like to get on to
        speedcubing, but I gotta be able to solve it first. Down the road maybe.
        In any case, I can complete the first 2 layers and make the cross on the
        final layer with no problems. I position the cube with the cross up.
        I've got the final layer edges positioned as well. This leaves 4 corners
        on the final layer. 1 of the 4 is in the correct position (but not
        oriented correctly). Using any number of sites (4 to be exact), I am
        left with the same results each time. When I try to position the 3
        remaining LL corners into their respective corners, I get an out of
        place corner on the bottom layer. If I position the cross up and the
        correct position corner piece in the Upper Right Corner, and then apply
        U R U' L' U R' U' L, I get the back bottom corner out of color. If I
        repeat the same move 2 more times, I'll be back where I started. Any

        Sorry if this is a regular topic here, but don't remember seeing any
        discussion - I have trouble with springs breaking (studio cube): 4 in
        the past 6 months. That may not sound too bad, but I doubt that the cube
        has averaged much more than 1 hour's use per day. What's considered
        "normal" for spring breakages? Also, is it possible to reduce the risk
        of it happening? The cube is well lubricated and the ends of the springs
        are smooth, but I haven't bothered to file the screw-thread flat
        underneath the spring. I keep the centres screwed well down to reduce
        the risk of pops -- maybe that's the problem (if these spring breakages
        are unusual). Ideas, please! Mike

        The only springs I have *ever* broken were when I tried to grind their
        ends flat with a dremel clone and did too much. I have *never* broken a
        spring inside a puzzle (and I do have numerous puzzles of different
        types including studio cubes). I'd assume it's because you tightened the
        springs too much. The studio cubes have way too strong springs and a
        much much better way to reduce pops is to use weaker springs (which will
        also reduce the general tension/friction). I have a mint one which I
        haven't lubed or sanded yet, which doesn't pop (well, unless I really
        purposely try to, actually it's not even easy to disassemble) and which
        already allows me to do the T-perm four times in 10 seconds (i.e. 5.6
        moves/second) fairly easily (with a good cube I need about 8.5 seconds
        unless I lock up). All I did was replace the springs and add some
        washers. Cheers! Stefan --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hello! My main speedcube is a Studio cube, I bought it in January and
        I'd estimate an average of 2/h of daily use. I have no problem with my
        springs, but on the other hand I think I have "normal" tension on the
        springs. Why not go to a hardware store and by a few sets of springs
        with different tensions and test which works best ;) Mikael

        &gt; &gt; Still, as long as with "F2L" you don't mean two adjacent outer
        layers &gt; (which would be kinda strange (though maybe I just invented
        a new &gt; method)), I think you change a third F2L edge (which we
        don't). &gt; &gt; &gt; My statement is accurate. :) &gt; &gt; Well,
        obviously depends on how one counts ;-) &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan

      <div class="email-content">
        Hi Everyone, There's no harm in thinking about US Nationals 2006. In
        terms of a venue selection, I would like to hold this tournament in some
        place that we've actually had experience with. I know a lot of the
        mid-west cubers were talking about the Great Mall but unless we've held
        a tournament there, I don't want to take the risk with a new
        environment. With that said, I have only a handful of venue locations
        right now. In order to save space on discussion, I would recommend that
        discussion for US Nationals takes place in the Caltech group so we don't
        flood all the non-US readers with countless e-mails. My first choice
        right now, and this is very early in the process, would be the
        Exploratorium Museum in San Francisco, CA. We held our Winter Tournament
        2005 there and it was a lot of fun. Also, we had hundreds of spectators
        because it was an open event and it was just another day in the museum.
        We met after the tournament and discussed the problems we had and they
        can all be fixed. The Exploratorium will probably be our choice for the
        Caltech Winter Tournament 2006 so we would have another chance to be
        there before a US National tournament, which would take place in the
        summer of 2006. And another thing... at the Exploratorium, we would have
        enough judges... and this is guaranteed. They have high school students
        who work/volunteer etc. and they loved seeing the cube last time...
        Another idea is to hold it at Caltech again. I am slightly reluctant
        because of the inaccessibility to food at Caltech. However, we all know
        this venue very well and so it would be very easy to run a smooth
        tournament here. A third idea is Horace Mann, in New York. However, like
        Caltech, these are private places. The media coverage for a tournament
        in a museum would easily be 100 times more than the media attention at a
        private institution. Of course, there is a bit more hassle with
        competing in a museum but I must say, I had a great time in San
        Francisco last January and I think it's a lot of fun. I realize that two
        of these choices are again on the west coast. For a US National
        tournament though, I don't want to be playing around with a venue we
        haven't been at. We had a few issues at the Exploratorium and we know
        what these issues are now and we can avoid them. One more thing is that
        I would probably be in favor of a two day event. A one day event is
        extremely exhausting for the tournament organizers. Furthermore, with
        the growing numbers of participants in Rubik's Cube competitions these
        days, a two day event may be the only feasible idea. So feel free to
        suggest places. I would recommend, again, that discussion takes place in
        the Caltech group. I can try talking to a few major amusement parks
        around, and I'm sure that would be fun, but I would be hesitant to hold
        a national tournament in an unfamiliar venue. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        I think it would be a good idea to hold the US Nationals in the midwest
        because it wouldn't be as far for people comming from all over the
        country, and I'm not just saying this because I am a midwest cuber, but
        I think more people would come if it was in the center of the country.

        my megaminx. Its springs were *way* too strong, even much stronger than
        those of the studio cubes. So the springs of the clones were much
        better. But they're much too long (and probably too strong) for 3x3s
        (actually for most puzzles except the current megaminx, not even the
        older megaminx because it had much shorter screws). Now I used springs
        that I've bought from an industrial spring manufacturer. I had to buy
        lots of them to get good prices. The manufacturer I chose is relatively
        cheap I think but if you only buy a single spring you pay 2-3 Euros, not
        even including shipping. The price drops rapidly with higher quantities
        but unfortunately you can't mix different springs. If you want 100 of
        type X and 100 of type Y then no matter how similar they are, you have
        to pay them separately. You can *not* pay the cheaper per-spring-price
        for 200 pieces. I ended up with four orders so far, almost 1000 springs
        altogether, spending a little more than 100 Euros. Yep, just for
        springs. Cheers! Stefan

        my studio cube? The length (about 10 mm) is ok. But the wire should be
        thinner. Completely compress a spring, measure its compressed height and
        divide by the number of coils to get the wire diameter. Will probably be
        somewhere around 0.6 to 0.7 mm, right? I have 0.5 and 0.32, both with
        middle coil diameter 4 mm and length 10 and 12.7 mm, respectively. The
        0.5 might still be too strong but it's certainly better already and it's
        the thinnest I can order with ends ground flat already (though they
        don't do the best job and I often sand them even further, but they're
        much better than not ground at all and if you use washers it gets even
        less important). The 0.32 are maybe a bit too weak but it depends on
        your cubing style. Diameter 0.4 is also available, maybe that's perfect.
        But I like the two strengths I have very much. Depends on the cube which
        is better. If you have screws with large heads or if you use large
        washers to reach the same effect, then 0.5 is excellent because you
        don't even get close to full compression. For example I use the 0. 5
        ones in my newest megaminx, together with 1 nylon washer and 5 metal
        washers (in each center) and it feels perfect. Don't know whether you'll
        find cheap suppliers, maybe I could sell some of those that I have (and
        get back some of that 100+ Euros ;-). Cheers! Stefan

        Absolutely anyone is welcome to take part, and if you are a beginner,
        you are sure to be teamed up with a more knowledgeable FMC'er so you can
        get the most out of the competition! All you have to do to take part in
        this "historic" event is to register your details using the Team FMC
        registration form. The form is on this page
        http://www.cubestation.co.uk/fmcresults/teamfmc100.php - or
        alternatively you can visit www.cubestation.co.uk, click on the Fewest
        Moves Challenge link in the Red menu panel, and then click the yellow
        box to get to the Team FMC page. And why not browse around the new look
        FMC pages while you are there :) Full details of the competition will be

        Thanks for all the info, wow. If you'd like to sell me some that'd be
        much easier than me hunting them down - only problem is that I live in
        the US and would have to pay you in USD - which is of course inferior to
        the mighty euro :) Bryan Mytko bryanosaurus@... On Jun 6, 2005, at 7:22

        currently in my studio cube? &gt; &gt; The length (about 10 mm) is ok.
        But the wire should be thinner. &gt; Completely compress a spring,
        measure its compressed height and divide &gt; by the number of coils to
        get the wire diameter. Will probably be &gt; somewhere around 0.6 to 0.7
        mm, right? &gt; &gt; I have 0.5 and 0.32, both with middle coil diameter
        4 mm and length 10 &gt; and 12.7 mm, respectively. &gt; &gt; The 0.5
        might still be too strong but it's certainly better already &gt; and
        it's the thinnest I can order with ends ground flat already &gt; (though
        they don't do the best job and I often sand them even further, &gt; but
        they're much better than not ground at all and if you use washers &gt;
        it gets even less important). &gt; &gt; The 0.32 are maybe a bit too
        weak but it depends on your cubing style. &gt; Diameter 0.4 is also
        available, maybe that's perfect. &gt; &gt; But I like the two strengths
        I have very much. Depends on the cube &gt; which is better. If you have
        screws with large heads or if you use &gt; large washers to reach the
        same effect, then 0.5 is excellent because &gt; you don't even get close
        to full compression. For example I use the 0. &gt; 5 ones in my newest
        megaminx, together with 1 nylon washer and 5 metal &gt; washers (in each
        center) and it feels perfect. &gt; &gt; Don't know whether you'll find
        cheap suppliers, maybe I could sell &gt; some of those that I have (and
        get back some of that 100+ Euros ;-). &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt;

        Hello, I'm developping a method for the 4x4x4 cube. I'm close to the end
        but I'm stuck because I've been searching a lot for a move (by myself)
        but I can't find it. So I'm thinking about asking help to my computer
        but I need a program that is able to solve the 4x4x4 cube. If it could
        ignore parts of the cube, that would be even better. I don't know if it
        exists, but that would help me (otherwise I would continue to search
        lol). Thanks a lot. :-) Gilles

        above: The original megaminx springs were the ones that were way too
        strong. The clone cube springs were much better inside the megaminx.
        They're just not good for cubes I think (except maybe the clone cubes
        themselves, maybe they have more room inside the centers). &gt; When you
        reckon you've found "the perfect spring", please let us all &gt; know -

        *the* perfect spring. It always depends on what you want it for and what
        you'd like it to be. I'm still experimenting a lot, actually I enjoy
        buying old cubes (not necessarily only original Rubik, the "wonderful
        puzzler" is very very good, too, for example) from flea markets, clean
        them, replace springs and add washers, adjust tension, sand and lube the
        cubies. Most of these cubes can be easily turned into great speedcubes I
        think. So I see a lot of different cubes (or also octagons for example),
        with different wear and different screw heads and different plastic and
        I'm trying to find out what's good for what. I think I'd like the 0.32
        springs for mods like the half-truncated cube because I'd like them to
        turn very easily. I think my 0.5 springs in combination with my washers
        are pretty perfect for the current Megaminx. They seem to work well with
        the older Megaminx, too, but with fewer washers since it had much
        shorter screws. The Megaminx only has one source (Meffert) and it
        doesn't wear as much as cubes (partly because most people play less with
        it) so I think most current Megaminxs are almost the same, thus "the"
        perfect spring for it makes much more sense than for 3x3. Would anyone
        want new springs+washers for Megaminx (I know there aren't many Megaminx
        fans out there)? Cheers! Stefan

        to keep the amount of text to an absolute minimum. This is where I need
        your help. Do you have a clever idea for pictures, picture Icons and
        symbols that could substitute for text? Something like the great FWD and
        PLAY symbols now used on all VCRs and DVD players? I will also need
        ideas for Menu items, such as Hints, Contact Us, Media, Make Home Page,
        Add to Favorites, Link to Us and Shop. I wantt to use as few words as
        possible: just pictures, symbols and a little bit of English. Also
        needed: [bullet] An icon for "New Free Game of the Day" -- any smart
        ideas for that? [bullet] A "people" icon showing how many people are
        online playing at any one time [bullet]The online Puzzle Competitions

        springs needed compared with the Cube, I wouldn't want to spend very
        much more than $6 per set. The Dogics look good on the shelf, but don't
        seem much fun to play with (solving is too repetitive). On the other

        Gaetan Guimond's method is very, very fast for the 2x2x2,
        http://www.rubikscuberecord.com/methode_en.html I would also recommend
        looking into either CLL or COLL. If you solve OLL/PLL style then COLL
        would be useful for the 3x3 for you as well. I know people still do
        CLL/ELL as well. CLL is better for the 2x2x2 but not useful for the
        3x3x3 unless you either do CLL/ELL or other cool tricks for the LL. COLL
        is slower for the 2x2x2 than CLL, but also useful for 3x3. Chris --- In

        Among the students that I know at Temecula Valley High, there is one 16
        second average (Ryan Patricio), 2 other guys that can probably average
        under 30, one guy at 35, maybe 3 in the 40's, and possibly another 5
        people under 60...and those are people I know... the students and I
        estimate that about 200 students out of about 3000 can do the cube...
        it's like a virus ;-)...I am guessing there are probably a number of
        sub-60's that I don't know...at least there are rumors ;-) There are a
        couple of girls in my classes that have gone under a minute (47 sec and
        57 sec)... the 57 second girl learned how to cube 2 or 3 weeks ago...a
        guy that learned last week did a 1:12 on the stackmat today... Many of
        the fast cube people at the school are sophomores and juniors, so we
        would definitely be competitive next year in a School Cup contest....

        Happily, I've gotten a newer and much better computer recently.
        Unfortunately, this has left me without a cube timer, and my cubing has
        dropped off dramatically. I attempted to send the file I had already
        used from my old computer to the new one, only to find it doesn't work
        on the newer one. I tried downloading it from the net and receiving it
        from a messenger program, too. The closest I've gotten to making it run
        was an error message about it not being able to find the main class. It
        then shuts down. If anyone has any ideas, seeing as I'm not nearly the

        I am not a whiz too but i'll try to help. :) Seems like your Java is not
        installed properply. Goto
        http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.jsp to check your java
        version. Upgrade it to the latest. This usually happens when if a
        application is written for java 1.4 for example and you use java 1.3 to
        run it and 1.3 dosent understand some features of 1.4 so it gets
        confused:) And about the main class error i think you have to give a
        path to your java installation files- its called the classpath. Check
        the documentation. Do tell us when you solve your problem so that we all
        can learn. Bye. Sachin --- Mike Bennett &lt;mikebennett_one@...&gt;

        1.3 to run &gt; it and 1.3 dosent understand some features of 1.4 so
        &gt; it gets confused:) &gt; &gt; And about the main class error i think
        you have to &gt; give a path to your java installation files- its &gt;
        called the classpath. Check the documentation. &gt; &gt; Do tell us when
        you solve your problem so that we all &gt; can learn. &gt; &gt; Bye.

        &gt; The closest I've gotten to making it run was an error &gt; message
        about it &gt; not being able to find the main class. It then shuts &gt;

        Hello, I have a few questions: 1) when solving 4x4x4 (centers first),
        while finishing LL I often have 2 edges-pairs permuted diagonally, I use
        U-permutation then r2U2r2(Uu) 2r2u2. Is there a faster way to fix? 2)
        for 3x3x3, I'm starting to use finger tricks/shortcuts but I have
        problem to do RUR'U and R'U'RU' in one motion. Is there anyone which can
        explain me how to do or send me a link to a video of this finger trick?
        3) when trying to solve 3x3x3 fast, I have precision problems: I always
        go to far (1/8 or 1/16 of turn) when triggering U/U' in shortcuts. Do
        you have any exercices/tips to become more precise? Thanks, Joël

        r2U2r2(Uu)2r2u2 alone. Just do it before the PLL. Or use (Uu)2 (Rr)2 U2
        r2 U2 (Rr)2 (Uu)2. If you really end up with it last, try to use one of
        these embedded in setup-moves (only 2 are needed). Cheers! Stefan

        anyone which &gt; can explain me how to do or send me a link to a video
        of this finger &gt; trick? I made quick videos that hopefully show how I
        would perform each of these sequences of moves:
        http://www.cubewhiz.com/videos/fsc/FSC-RUR'U.avi For R U R' U', I hold
        the cube with my thumb on bottom and my first three fingers on the top
        of the cube. I use my wrist to turn the . As the cube begins to become
        lined up, I use my pointer to push the U, and continue to turn my wrist
        in the opposite direction for the R'. Meanwhile, my right middle finger
        heads to the back of the cube to prepare for the last turn. As that R'
        is finishing, I use my right middle finger for the final U.
        http://www.cubewhiz.com/videos/fsc/FSC-R'U'RU'.avi This is done
        similarly, except I use my thumb to push the second U', and I grip the
        cube differently. I would start with my right index on the top of the
        cube, my middle and ring fingers on the back, and my pinky just below
        the cube. My thumb would be covering the top right square of the front
        face. (DivX is required to view both videos). I didn't have a cameraman
        to help me out, so you have to translate the angle to first person on
        your own. &gt; 3) when trying to solve 3x3x3 fast, I have precision
        problems: I always &gt; go to far (1/8 or 1/16 of turn) when triggering
        U/U' in shortcuts. Do &gt; you have any exercices/tips to become more
        precise? I would just practice those shortcuts over and over so that
        they become more natural. Try to really concentrate on letting your
        fingers do exactly what they have to. First go slowly, then gradually
        pick up some speed. I'm sure others could offer better advice for this,
        though.

        someone help me lol &gt; -Justin Hi Justin You need to take the core
        apart, IMO. The core is a modified 3x3x3, but DON'T try to disassemble
        by levering out an "edge" piece. The edges are shaved right down, and
        are so thin that they get chewed up badly if you try to lever them out.
        In the middle of the "3x3x3" centres you'll see the flat heads of 3
        pins. Gently lever these up, but DON'T remove any other pieces until all
        3 pins are removed. (If you DO remove the edges surrounding a centre, it
        may crack when you lever out the pin -- the centres are also thin and
        fragile.) Once you've removed the 3 pins, disassembly is easy.
        Reasssembly is much easier than disassembly -- you won't need
        instructions. :) Hope this helps. Mike

        You need to download the latest JRE (java runtime environment) for your
        operating system. You can get that here:
        http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp The browser java plugin
        cannot be used to run a .jar file. That is why you must download and
        install the JRE from the link above. After you have installed the latest
        JRE from the link above, then you can run the .jar file by opening a
        command prompt and typing: "java -jar JNetCube.jar" If you are using
        Windows, then you should be able to just double-click the JNetCube.jar
        file after installing the latest JRE. Please let me know if you still
        cannot run the timer after following the steps above and I will be more
        than happy to get it working for you. -Chris

        from the terminal - My problem was that I didn't have the right JRE set
        as the default. All I had to do was go into java preferences and set JRE
        5.0 to be first priority over JRE 1.4.2. After that just clicking the
        jar file opens up the program. I actually figured this out minutes after
        I responded to the previous post. Bryan Mytko bryanosaurus@... On Jun 9,

        Well, maybe not. Sliced bread is pretty cool. What I made is called a

        no need for that anymore. Now anyone can create the applets on the fly

        Great work! Thanks man, i've always wanted something like this. At first
        i didnt mean what u meant by "on the fly" but after going to ur site i
        fully understood its meaning. For the uninitiated, this applet (or
        favlet as u call it) will generate Java cubes for any algo--u just
        select the algo and then run the favlet -- then u get a nice cube which
        u can drag anywhere u like. Keep up the good work :) --- Yasmara

        Hi all, After demonstrating you my favelet
        (http://vanderblonk.com/cube/favelet/index.htm) I realized it showed the
        cube after a scramble. I think it's more interesting if it shows by
        default how the algorithm solves the cube. That's in the case of PLL/OLL
        pages etc. So I changed the favelet. For something like the sunday/xday
        contest you still need the original one. I am working on making multiple
        versions of the favelet available and working out a way of making it
        configurable. I have to remind you that the program is hosted. That
        means even though it looks like it's on your PC it gets downloaded on
        every invocation and I can change it anytime (scary huh?). Michiel

        http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/foo/paper_cap.jpg Michel Bechtatou once
        suggested to use paper pieces to fix the 3x3 center caps. I *hate* glue.
        I have used the hammer method and can live with it. But this paper
        method is now my favourite, it does the least damage. The cross shape I
        use now is great, when you push down the cap then the paper will slide
        inside perfectly. It does raise the cap slightly but that might actually
        be good because if you've played with a cube for a while you might
        notice that the centers move inside a bit because both they and the
        edges polish each other at the connection.
        http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/foo/scratch_identifiers.jpg I scratch the
        color of the cubie into the center piece and I mark both the piece and
        the cap with a line that must then matched. This way I can always put
        everything back exactly the way it was (I consider this to be important
        because no two parts are ever the same). Helps for example if you want
        to keep all caps off and twist the and adjust the tensions.
        http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/foo/box.jpg A box I made from polystyrol
        sheet. I need more for a semi-secret project and I want to start giving
        ids to all my cubes because I'm losing the overview, which cube is
        which, what have I done to it, where are its original springs etc.
        http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/foo/studio3x3_fix.jpg What I now do to
        Studio 3x3s. Two washers at each end of the spring. Each washer has one
        side with a more rounded rim and let all round sides point into the
        cube. The innermost washer makes the center cubie hole bottom flat. The
        next one reduces the friction. The outer two also reduce friction, but
        mainly I need so many because the spring is quite short if fully
        compressed. http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/foo/studio3x3_springs.jpg

        The inner diameter is supposed to be 3.2mm but I can't check it. I only
        say this because the outer diameter is supposed to be 6mm but actually
        it's about 5.75mm which I determined by lining up 10 in a row. With 6mm
        it would probably *not* fit into the 3x3, so I was lucky (I had bought
        them for Megaminx which has larger holes). They're 0.8mm thick but that
        doesn't really matter much, I just say it for completeness. Cheers!

        you've played with &gt; a cube for a while you might notice that the

        weak springs, then they don't pop (unless you really want to or are a
        really terrible cuber ;-) Cheers! Stefan

        &gt; &gt; =) Nice. &gt; &gt; Macky That's pretty crazy stuff - I thought
        maybe you were juggling all 3 at once and just solving them as they came
        round into one hand (I guess left judging by the video) though. Then
        you'd be solving all 3 at once, intertwined so to speak. Not sure how

        Hi! I just recently receive a missing link puzle that i bought off eBay.
        After 2 days i have had some rather nice achievements. I started off by
        working out a nice method, while having a look around what methods exist
        out there. I found actually only one which was writen down in some
        detail. This method i found on Jaap's site and solves the puzzle column
        by column. The method im currently using involves following steps -
        trickle down all the tiles to go in first row and place them at bottom
        ... this should be faitly intuitive i hope ... make sure u do ALL 4
        bottom tiles before proceed or u are in a bit of trouble - now turn the
        middle 2 rows (they won't turn individually though) so as to put as many
        tiles as possible into solved or good positions ... a good position is
        typically in it's correct column - now u actually have some freedom in
        how u proceed .. either complete column by column (leave white for last)
        ... or u can do sorta row by row ... basically u solve the tiles that u
        spot first so as not to waste time ... when placing a tile into 2nd row
        from bottom u can always lift a column (i leave it to urselves to work
        out how) and then solve the tile and lower the column back - after
        having finished all tiles in the 2nd row almost all activity takes place
        in 2 top rows ... solving 3rd row is trivial ... - so final step is
        dealing w the last row .. there are five cases only u should know .. i
        have easy solutions for all of them ... only one case involves dealing
        with lifting a column ... this case is where if white column in front
        and the empty slot is also in front u have to swap the left and right
        top tile only ... then u have to put the tile in 3rd row from bottom in
        the column opposite to white into the 2nd row in that column (u know how
        already) ... doing that correctly and simply the puzzle is now solved I
        will post all these 5 last layer algs once i have worked out a good
        notation and made some diagrams :-) For those who don't know the missing
        link puzzle looks like here is a link :
        http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/missing.htm I'd like some
        feedback on this method. Any others here know how to solve the missing
        link and use other methods? I would also like some competion cause i
        have already posted good times for single solve and average. Check of
        course at : http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_other_puzzles.html
        This turned out to be a rather long post. Thx for ur time :-) Kind

        video) though. &gt; &gt;&gt; Then you'd be solving all 3 at once,
        intertwined so to speak. &gt; &gt;&gt; Not sure how hard that would
        be... or if you could get many twists &gt; &gt; in at once. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I think I could do that. And to top it off, I'd do it
        underwater! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; Stefan

        Hi: I'm new to this forum so decided to break the ice with a question.
        While many speed cubists will refer to corner's first in passing as one
        of the speed cubing solutions, I have not seen solutions based on it
        recently. I learned to put the cube together using a corner's first
        framework years ago and I'm now trying to improve my time with this
        methodology. I'm now averaging about 70sec, with personal best in the
        50s. So my question at this point is if it's worth pursuing faster times
        using this methodology or has it been proven to be suboptimal, in which
        case I should scrap it and try to relearn Fridrick or Peterus. I have
        not yet learned any finger moves as of yet; I now put the corners
        together using Petrus's Niklas/Sune combos; and my edge solutions are
        similar to that in http://cube.misto.cz/_MAIL_/cfsm.html. I think I can
        significantly increase my edge time (about 40 sec) with more stronger
        algorithms but haven't seen much in this area lately. Any thoughts or
        suggestions would be appreciated. dmacauley@...

        proved, and /suspect/ that the current dominance of the layer-by-layer
        approach is largely a "social" phenomenon. You would not be in bad
        company in pursuing corners-first. It's known that Marc Waterman
        achieved very fast times with a (complex) corners- first system. For
        details (probably you've already looked), see http://rubikscube.info/
        Note also that the majority of competitors in the 1982 world
        championship (including the Champion) used corners-first methods. See
        http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p4 Perhaps the
        dominance of corners-first in those days was similarly due to a "social"
        phenomenon. The big "problem" with adopting a corners-first framework as
        a beginner nowadays is that you will have to think for yourself: with
        Fridrich, there are many websites from which you can select
        sequences/fingertricks; also, the majority of people who contribute on
        this forum will be familiar mainly with Fridrich, so a corner-starter
        won't have so many people to talk to. Fridrich herself seems very open
        minded about this question. She has stated that there may be many
        methods that could be as fast as hers when worked out to a sufficient
        level of "perfection" - see also her recent comments here
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/16756
        So, good luck with the corners -- and sorry that I'm too inexpert to
        help with the specifics of any approach, let alone corners-first. Mike

        Hey everyone, I have a question about a section I'm adding to my
        webpage. I've already taken all the videos, I just need to get them onto
        my computer and edit them into separate clips, so almost all the work is
        done so far. Basically what this page will do is show you what a
        competition solve for speed, and for blindfolded solving, looks like. I
        did a complete mock-up of a competition solve, based on my experiences
        with how they go, and I filmed them. So there are 3 videos to watch: 1)
        mock competition 3x3 speed solve - this includes a judge (many thanks to
        my girlfriend Becky for helping me out here :-), everything the judge
        says to you that you have to respond to, the timer, the 15 second
        inspection, everything. Also includes the fact that you have up to about
        2 seconds after the judge removes the paper to re-focus on the cube
        before picking it up. (I think the rules technically say 3, but I think
        it's not a good idea to push this one). 2) mock competition 3x3 BLD
        solve - I didn't do the whole solve of course, I put the cube about two
        moves away from solved, but I show how the time starts, you picking up
        your cube, memorizing, putting on the blindfold, solving and stopping
        the timer. 3) putting down the cube without dropping. - I heard people a
        lot of times at competitions talking about how they don't know how to
        put their cube down at the end of the solve without droppping it. Well I
        filmed this video from two different angles, from my point of view, and
        from someone watching's point of view. It shows how I bring the cube to
        the mat and let it go at the last second, so not technically a drop. I
        have the approval of Tyson on this one, so it's ok WCA wise. I'm just
        curious if anyone here, who has not been to a competition but is
        considering going, would be interested? I'm going to put it on my site,
        and I was curious if I could get some reviews both by people who have
        been, and haven't been to one before. I will have the site done later
        today, but I just wanted to get an idea of whether or not people would
        be interested in this. Chris

        the black enclosure) and a rough draft of the &gt; advertisement that
        will appear on www.rubiks.com during the pre-order &gt; period. &gt;
        &gt; If you haven't seen the website recently, check it out at &gt;
        http://www.mission-designs.com/timer/journal.htm &gt; &gt; Peace, &gt;
        -Eric I gotta say, the timer looks pretty shnazzy. Any word on the
        retail price and release date? (I'm going back to read the details
        later, don't have much time right now.) Nice work! Daniel

        I'd be very interested in this guide. I have yet to attend a competition
        but I'll be going to the Dallas tournament in August. I think a website

        I'm adding to my webpage. &gt; &gt; I've already taken all the videos, I
        just need to get them onto my &gt; computer and edit them into separate
        clips, so almost all the work is &gt; done so far. &gt; &gt; Basically
        what this page will do is show you what a competition solve &gt; for
        speed, and for blindfolded solving, looks like. &gt; &gt; I did a
        complete mock-up of a competition solve, based on my &gt; experiences
        with how they go, and I filmed them. &gt; &gt; So there are 3 videos to
        watch: &gt; 1) mock competition 3x3 speed solve &gt; - this includes a
        judge (many thanks to my girlfriend Becky for &gt; helping me out here
        :-), everything the judge says to you that you &gt; have to respond to,
        the timer, the 15 second inspection, everything. &gt; Also includes the
        fact that you have up to about 2 seconds after the &gt; judge removes
        the paper to re-focus on the cube before picking it up. &gt; (I think
        the rules technically say 3, but I think it's not a good &gt; idea to
        push this one). &gt; &gt; 2) mock competition 3x3 BLD solve &gt; - I
        didn't do the whole solve of course, I put the cube about two &gt; moves
        away from solved, but I show how the time starts, you picking up &gt;
        your cube, memorizing, putting on the blindfold, solving and stopping
        &gt; the timer. &gt; &gt; 3) putting down the cube without dropping.
        &gt; - I heard people a lot of times at competitions talking about how
        they &gt; don't know how to put their cube down at the end of the solve
        without &gt; droppping it. Well I filmed this video from two different
        angles, &gt; from my point of view, and from someone watching's point of
        view. It &gt; shows how I bring the cube to the mat and let it go at the
        last &gt; second, so not technically a drop. I have the approval of
        Tyson on &gt; this one, so it's ok WCA wise. &gt; &gt; I'm just curious
        if anyone here, who has not been to a competition but &gt; is
        considering going, would be interested? I'm going to put it on my &gt;
        site, and I was curious if I could get some reviews both by people who
        &gt; have been, and haven't been to one before. &gt; &gt; I will have
        the site done later today, but I just wanted to get an &gt; idea of
        whether or not people would be interested in this. &gt; &gt; Chris

        Greetings dmacauley, Welcome to the list. Is "Corners First" suboptimal?
        I don't think so. I use a method which does 1. two edges 2. four corners
        3. six edges (done in pairs) 4. four corners 5. four edges and on a good
        day I take around 30 seconds. If I try "corners first" it take about 35
        seconds. So off hand I'd say that it looks like corners first is very
        good approach. I think that 2x2x2 practice can help a lot. Consider
        being able to "see" the corner's solution during the inspection time...
        I've played a little at "blindfold" 2x2x2 with a best at 7 seconds.

        cubing solutions, I have not seen solutions based on &gt; it recently. I
        learned to put the cube together using a corner's first &gt; framework
        years ago and I'm now trying to improve my time with this &gt;

        phenomenon. &gt; &gt; You would not be in bad company in pursuing
        corners-first. It's known &gt; that Marc Waterman achieved very fast
        times with a (complex) corners- &gt; first system. For details (probably
        you've already looked), see &gt; &gt; http://rubikscube.info/ &gt; &gt;
        Note also that the majority of competitors in the 1982 world &gt;
        championship (including the Champion) used corners-first methods. See
        &gt; &gt; http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p4 &gt;
        &gt; Perhaps the dominance of corners-first in those days was similarly
        due &gt; to a "social" phenomenon. &gt; &gt; The big "problem" with
        adopting a corners-first framework as a beginner &gt; nowadays is that
        you will have to think for yourself: with Fridrich, &gt; there are many
        websites from which you can select &gt; sequences/fingertricks; also,
        the majority of people who contribute on &gt; this forum will be
        familiar mainly with Fridrich, so a corner- starter &gt; won't have so
        many people to talk to. &gt; &gt; Fridrich herself seems very open
        minded about this question. She has &gt; stated that there may be many
        methods that could be as fast as hers &gt; when worked out to a
        sufficient level of "perfection" - see also her &gt; recent comments
        here &gt; &gt;
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/16
        756 &gt; &gt; So, good luck with the corners -- and sorry that I'm too
        inexpert to &gt; help with the specifics of any approach, let alone
        corners-first. &gt; &gt; Mike

        Hey Chris, After you inspect, the judge needs to ask you if you're ready
        to solve and you need to acknowledge it. That way, the competitor can't
        claim "oh, I wasn't ready." Also, the "3, 2, 1" countdown after the
        inspection isn't necessary. I've been meaning to amend to rules so that
        the judge just has to say "ready? go." And remember, after the judge
        says go, you have a second or two to refocus. And if there is any

        Hey Chris, I gave a look at the site and it's quite good. I was never
        sure exactly how the whole inspect-cover-uncover-solve thing went, it's
        nice to have a clear video. I do have 2 questions. First, at the end of
        your solve, do you pick up your cube, or does the judge have to hand it
        to you? I thought I read somewhere that the judge must hand it to you.
        Second, is there anywhere where the official rules are typed up? Thanks
        again, my girlfriend will be screening the videos tonight, and
        henceforth training me in accordance with them ;) lucky her! -Daniel ---

        let me know how it's going so far? &gt; &gt;
        http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tmao/blindfold.doc Hi Tyson, you asked for
        it... ;-) General: I'd appreciate it if you could at least mention that
        you describe only one method and that there are others as well. You say
        one solves two or three pieces at a time, I do one at a time. Not
        everybody does orientation and permutation separately. I never memorize
        with numbers, I'm convinced it's very very unnatural and bad, maybe
        unless you're Japanese and memorizing the sound of a number sequence is
        easy for you. There's good reason the real memorizers memorize numbers
        not as numbers but as images. Numbers are so abstract. Finally, as some
        people have demonstrated, it's indeed possible and not even hard (just
        takes long to plan the solution) to solve the cube blindfolded using
        your regular speedsolving method. Wrong effects for your corner
        orientation algs. Particularly you always say top/bottom when you really
        mean front/back (Or back/front? I'm completely confused). Also it could
        be better to name all three faces to describe a corner, not just two,
        but it coul be clear from context once you fix the other issue. About
        the powerful corner orientation method: I think the R' is not
        outstanding, it's part of the single-corner-orientation. Do the other
        six moves alone on a solve cube and it will just look confusing. Also, I
        highly recommend (you write this for beginners, right?) to *always* add
        the D-turn, this way you never have to think whether to do it or not,
        you just always do it. Examples of what I'd do: (R' D R D' R' D R D') U'
        (D R' D' R D R' D' R) U (R' D R D' R' D R D') U' (R' D R D' R' D R D')
        U' (R' D R D' R' D R D') U2 You could also mention that one can orient
        all four corners as well. And that the overall orientation must be a
        multiple of three (in clockwise rotations). I get the feeling you
        describe algorithms derived with the method but not the method itself
        clearly, which is a pity. It could also make the text quite a bit
        shorter. Maybe simply show that (R' D R D' R' D R D') and (D R' D' R D
        R' D' R) rotate the URF corner that you do them several times, to
        different corners, which you select by U-turns between the
        single-corner-rotations. Then show some instantiations (algorithms) of
        the general method. And how about orienting corners in the D layer
        instead of U? Do Macky/Leyan really do it the way you described? Try
        this, it's much faster (and also easier because one makes fewer mistakes
        when using fingertricks): (R U R' U' R U R' U') D (U R U' R' U R U' R')
        D' (R U R' U' R U R' U') D (R U R' U' R U R' U') D (R U R' U' R U R' U')
        D2 You say "always remember that I'm not right". Don't be so mean to
        yourself ;-) An easier way to find out whether an edge is badly
        oriented: I say white/yellow are brightest, green/blue are darkest and
        orange/red are medium. This way each edge has a brighter and a darker
        sticker. An edge is correctly oriented iff its brighter sticker is on
        the brighter face (defined by the centers). Just this single rule. I
        think "flip" is better than "switch" to describe the effect of edge
        orientation algs. Corner permutation: Same top/bottom vs front/back
        confusion again. Typo in (L F' L B2 L' F' L B2 L2). "This is very
        similar to Stefan Pochmann's blindfold method". Hmm... as much as I like
        my solution being referenced, I'd say this is not correct. I do use the
        T-perm, yes, but that's all the similarity. We use it for quite
        different purposes. So I'd like to ask you to remove the reference,
        please. Btw, you got the T-perm wrong ;-) And the edge crosser, too...
        Oh, and if you know the F-perm or N-perm you can use those, too. Any
        perm that swaps two opposite edges. Or two adjacent but you need to do
        it for both perms of course. But since it's a beginner tutorial I'd not
        demonstrate this in detail, just (if at all) mention it. It could
        improve the understanding and if someone knows the other perms already
        it might help to make blindsolving even easier. Some suggestions you
        maybe already have in mind for the rest of the document: - Suggest to
        solve using the blindfold method but without wearing a blindfold. At
        least until they get it right. - Suggest to scramble two cubes the same
        way. Then do one step to the first cube and make sure you got it right
        by comparing it to the other, which still shows the cube state right
        before the step. Then do the step to the other cube and make sure both
        cubes look the same again. - Link to the other solutions on the web and
        to the blindsolving yahoo group. Cheers! Stefan

        Hi Chris, thanks a lot (though I personally don't need it anymore unless
        I'm a judge for a newbie ;-), that's a very good idea. Some comments and
        corrections, though: The Timer --------- Hmm, I've seen Katsu place the
        hands on the timer this way, but I myself don't, I put my fingers on the
        contacts. Otherwise you could cheat (even unintentionally) when picking
        up the cube, especially with the Stackmat 2. Also, maybe describe the
        procedure, particularly what the lights mean. Putting the cube down
        --------------------- I think if you show it that slowly only, that's no
        use. With that speed, any method of holding the cube will work. A
        suggestion would be to lower your hands (probably better the whole body)
        close to the surface during the last solution step. And you could link
        to Macky's 12.11 solve, it looks very good how he puts down the cube and
        I doubt he grips the bottom of the cube like you describe. Btw, besides
        the risk of penalty, you should mention how mean it is to the poor cube
        if you throw it down, it might even break (and not only out in tears).
        The solve and competition procedure -----------------------------------
        1+2) This is only correct for the first attempt in a round. Well, unless
        Americans do it differently. At the competitions I've been to we were
        usually packed into groups of 4 or 8 people and we didn't get our cubes
        back between the solves of a round. 8) I'd recommend not getting too
        close to the limit here, either, because you might get interrupted
        during analysis and lose track. Also, I always count in my head
        (starting at 0, not at 10) so I have a better feeling how much time is
        left. 10) Not getting too close might also be important if as judge you
        get one of those people who start counting at 1 instead of 0. You know,
        some people count "1..2..3" and thus actually only measure 2 seconds.
        Maybe cubers are more intelligent, but I've seen it in real life. Also,
        like Tyson already mentioned, the judge should again ask you whether
        you're ready before he starts the countdown. That is, unless you've
        clearly instructed him otherwise beforehand, e.g. that you will be ready
        and that he shouldn't ask whether you are and maybe not even count down
        again but just cover the cube and take it away after the timer is ready
        (i.e. second light is on). Not sure whether this is in the rules but as
        a judge I was requested to do it this way once and I don't see a problem
        with it. 12) The cube must be flat on the table? I think it would be ok
        if it stays on a corner. Or if it drops to the floor of the podium and
        then to the floor below the podium (as happened with some 5x5s at the
        German Open... ouch ;-). 12.5) This step is missing (also in the video).
        The judge inspects your cube, looks whether it's correctly solved and
        whether a penalty is needed. Btw, with Rubik's Clock it's particularly
        irritating to hear the crowd cheer before anybody has checked the back
        side (which has really caused many disqualifications). 14) Unless the
        judge takes your cube with him/her for your next scramble. And you can
        also switch to a different cube if you want to. The video: I believe you
        only hold the cube with your left hand when putting it down. Baaad
        example ;-) Blindfolded solving procedure -----------------------------
        2) I wouldn't be so strict about wearing it from the start unless you're
        solving only a 3x3 or so ;-) 5) When you put the cube down for putting
        on the blindfold, be sure you don't accidentally stop the timer! I've
        almost done this myself once or twice, because the procedure is so
        similar to speedsolving. You inspect/memorize, then put the cube down,
        then (*), then pick up the cube and solve it. In speedsolving you touch
        the timer at (*) and in blindsolving you must not! It's also important
        during the solve, e. g. if you put the cube down for a moment to relax
        or whatever, and when you try to pick it up again you could accidentally
        stop the timer. Remember it's very sensitive. 7) It's the job of the
        judge, *not* the solver, to check whether the solve was successful. Do
        *not* touch the cube before the judge did it. The video: You put your
        hands down on the mat before and after putting on the blindfold. Not a
        good example I think, even though you don't get near the timer contacts.
        Cheers! Stefan

        That's not true... it actually is the end of the world. In all
        seriousness, if you stop the timer by accident, that's your fault, and
        we won't award you the time or another solve. In actuality, the
        stopwatch is only used for the 15 seconds inspection. Maybe it would be
        better if the judge doesn't time the actual solve because it gives the
        misconception that the judge's timing is a backup. The judge's timing of
        the solve is not a backup; simply said, usually the judge has the
        stopwatch in their fingers, so they feel compelled to time the solve. If
        the timer fails on its own, then you get another solve. Otherwise, you
        do not. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On Jun 14,

        Since the stackmats (at least generation 1) stop counting after 10

        Yeah, unfortunately we can't. Especially if your time is superb and even
        more especially if your solve is a world record. We can't have the world
        record time with inaccurate means. Fortunately, in the thousands of
        solves that I've watched over, I've only seen the timer fail once. These
        things happen, and there's nothing we can really do about it. Any other
        timing method would not be in accordance of the regulation and really
        wouldn't be fair. Also, how do we decide what's a "superb" solve and an
        absolute junk solve? Chris, when you refilm this video, maybe you could
        have Becky not time you during the actual solve. It's how things should
        be done. Exceptions for stopwatch timing occur for events that are
        expected to last over 10 minutes. At those time scales, the error in
        human judging is smaller. .2 is a big deal at the 15 second level but
        not that big of a deal at the 15 minute level, and for most of our
        events, if you're solving it in 15 minutes, it's not going to be a world
        record. I will work on asking StackMat to adjust their timers so that
        they do not shut off after 10 minutes. In the mean time, did you know
        that the timing of solar system object observations with the Very Large
        Array need to be timed so that you have the array in the right
        configuration? Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On

        Hey! I've been working on and off on this guide for 2 years (although
        the bulk of the actual work was done today), so that makes me more

        Hey everyone, Ok I fixed the main videos, the mockup 3x3 solves. I ran
        them by Tyson and I have the WCA stamp of approval for correctness of
        the procedure, what the judge says, when the competitor speaks, etc.. I
        also fixed the description of the procedure on my page. Also, thanks all
        for the detailed responses. In particular Stefan, I didn't realize that
        I never actually use both hands to bring the cube to the mat, but I
        thought I did! That's really weird, I always though I used both hands
        but after doing some speedsolves and really paying attention to that
        step I always do it with one hand! I've already refilmed all the videos
        for putting the cube down, but I have to go through and edit them into
        small downloadable clips. It's really late, so I'll do that tomorrow.
        But, the main 3x3 mock solves are corrected and can be used safely for
        preparing yourself for a competition solve.

        I'll also add some stuff about how the stackmats work in a text
        description, but right now I need sleep. Ok, enjoy the page, and keep
        checking back for more updates/fixes

        I like the timing on all the blindsolving tutorials. I just did my first
        bld solve on the 2x2x2 last week and was going to start on the 3x3x3
        this week. One question I have though is how much writing you guys
        actually do. When I was doing the 2x2x2 it ended up taking quite a bit
        of writing, corner cycles etc... I know a lot of you can bld solve the
        2x2x2 in under a minute, so I assume there's not a whole lot of writing.

        Understanding exactly what to do is necessary in order to solve it

        &gt; And how about orienting corners in the D layer instead of U? Do
        &gt; Macky/Leyan really do it the way you described? Try this, it's much
        &gt; faster (and also easier because one makes fewer mistakes when using
        &gt; fingertricks): &gt; &gt; (R U R' U' R U R' U') D (U R U' R' U R U'
        R') D' &gt; &gt; (R U R' U' R U R' U') D (R U R' U' R U R' U') D (R U R'
        U' R U R' U') &gt; D2 I turn the cube with z'. So now the corner twister
        is R and U, and the layer move is L. &gt; An easier way to find out
        whether an edge is badly oriented: I say &gt; white/yellow are
        brightest, green/blue are darkest and orange/red are &gt; medium. This
        way each edge has a brighter and a darker sticker. An &gt; edge is
        correctly oriented iff its brighter sticker is on the brighter &gt; face
        (defined by the centers). Just this single rule. Not if you're using
        blue-opposite-white! Macky

        When you do a bld solve I know you're allowed to put it behind your back
        to solve it, but are you allowed to read algorithms that you don't know

        Hi! I have been trying to shoot a good 4x4x4 speedsolving video today.
        It's not easy to find a good angle for the webcam. And it's a bit
        awkward to have to think of showing the cube for the cam while i solve.
        So i didn't manage my topspeed. But at least i did manage a 1:13.97
        solve while shooting. As you can see im not using the usual pairing-up.
        My method is ... umm .... arguably more intuitive. Sort of layer by
        layer if u like. I call theis the "cage" method since the cube looks
        indeed like a cage before i do the final centers :-) Ok, here is the

        Hi Per, Very nice solve. I could see the cube well - good distance. If
        you do another one, I would like to see all six sides of the cube both
        before and after it is solved. The only "better angle" that I can think
        of right of is if you shot it with a mirror placed strategically.
        However, that might be distracting. Regards, David J --- In

        Okay, so I need to send in some tape. I don't have a video camera with
        me... I could ask around, but I think it would be funnier if it were
        done at Caltech. I'm in New Mexico right now, but I'll drive through
        Caltech on my way back home. If you guys want to draw an outline for

        Actually, I've thought about this before, but do not have the necessary
        equipment to go through with the idea. I was thinking that if you could
        get multiple cameras set up at different angles, then you could put them
        together on the computer in 4 different quadrants. For instance, you
        have one from the cubers perspective, one below pointing up, one from
        the right side, and one from the upper-back-left (if that makes sense).
        If the cameras were positioned properly, then you wouldnt be able to see
        the other cameras in the shot. I think it would be great for analyzing
        someone's technique, but like I said, it requires a bit more resources
        than most people have. It would be fun to watch though! -Chris Parlette

        far as i can see he solves the cube in something like 9.5 - 10.0 secs.
        Even for a practised solve this is really good. This is equivalent to
        about 4 moves/sec or more. It's really lucky fridrich solve if it's less

        San Clemente High School's Cuber's Club just held a competition! We
        currently have 12 people at our school who I know can solve the cube,
        and 6 of the fastest competed. We even got to eat a Rubik's cake!
        Understand that most of the competitors have only been cubing for a
        month, so hopefully the times will be lower by the next competition.
        Since I was the host and judge of the competition, I did not
        participate. Obviously, this wasn't an official WCA competition, but I
        hope to bring a few friends to a Caltech competition soon (I'd love to
        go to the Dallas tourney, but I don't think I can go.) I've attached the
        results, and wanted to know if there is a simple way for me to post all
        of the results on speedcubing.com, rather than one at a time (though it
        wouldn't be that difficult.) People just love to see their names online.
        This was the first meeting for San Clemente High School's Cuber's Club,
        I hope to get a website running soon, and I'll post some pictures. I'd
        also love any advice you would give to someone starting a Rubik's cube
        club. Jeremy Fleischman [Non-text portions of this message have been

        By following the 9-cycle, you have the first 4 pairs in the same layer.
        Consider it like the D layer ( made as a cross) . The 4 next pairs are
        in the middle layer ( by analogy the F2L step). And the last pair is in
        the U layer. This alg leaves the last 3 pairs in U layer unsolved. If
        you have 5-cycle by example, nevermind. Continue the preposition with an
        other cycle. Just you loose one pair. Most of the time, my alg leaves 4
        pairs unsolved. If I loose one pair (it's an unlucky case), you have 5
        pairs unsolved. But 4 or 5 pairs unsolved is the same (about). I try to
        calculate the probabilities : having a cycle of minumum 9 pairs is
        possible most of the time, and it is not very important if you loose one
        pair. Have fun, Frederick --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        That'll be awesome! How many people do you think you would bring? If
        it's not a billion, we may be able to put you up in various people's

        Hey everyone, First off let me say that the COLL case I am mentioning
        has a fast alg to it already. However, personally for my hands I don't
        like that alg and it is very slow for me. Well I used Acube and came up
        with an {R,U,L} alg that I really, really like for it. All the COLL
        sites seem to list the same alg, which is (in some form or another): y
        (R F') U' (R2 F) U' F' U R2 U (F R') (Lars' site) RF'U'R2FU'F'UR2UFR'
        (Ron's algs list) The alg I found with Acube is: L U L' U R' U L U R U
        R' U R L' which I do as (L U L') (U) (R' U) L (U) [(R U R' U) R] L'
        Again, personally for my hands this RUL alg is MUCH better than the
        other one, but I know that the "regular" alg is also fast. Just not for
        my hands :-D Chris

        It's really too bad I wasn't able to pull off the competition before the
        school year ended, it would be a lot easier to gauge the school's
        interest in cubing. I know that there are at least three dedicated
        cubers who plan on learning more algorithms; while others may not be
        interested in knowing more than how to solve the cube. By October, if
        everything goes to plan, everyone at San Clemente will want to go to an
        official competition! Seriously though, I hope to bring four people
        (myself included) to a Caltech competition in Pasadena. And hopefully,
        the same group will go to the 2006 Nationals. I believe there is some
        real untapped talent at my high school, and I hope to have some very
        fast cubers for the coming school year. Oh, and thaiguy20fromLA, don't
        "wish that my middle school had a competition," instead, hold your own
        to kick off a new club! I'm amazed at how interested people are in
        learning how to solve a Rubik's cube. Just today, when I took a cube out
        of my pocket and did a 51 second solve, two people came up and asked me
        to teach them how to solve it this summer (and of course, I will.) As
        I've seen many people say, cubing is going through a revival of sorts,
        and we can help spread it like a virus! Jeremy Fleischman [Non-text

        among other things: "I have some buisness interest in Mexico. I often go
        there, and people there still know me as the cube champion". "Have three
        kids, one of them is cubing". "I think, it´s impossible to beat my

        published, at the WC03 official site. The interwiew was made just before

        Fast {R,U,L} version of a COLL alg Hey everyone, First off let me say
        that the COLL case I am mentioning has a fast alg to it already.
        However, personally for my hands I don't like that alg and it is very
        slow for me. Well I used Acube and came up with an {R,U,L} alg that I
        really, really like for it. All the COLL sites seem to list the same

        L') (U) (R' U) L (U) [(R U R' U) R] L' Again, personally for my hands
        this RUL alg is MUCH better than the other one, but I know that the

        Hi Chris, If I don't want to change where the corners are and just
        reorient them I use 11 moves: R U2 R2 U' R2 U' R2 U2 R which is probably
        well known. Your COLL reverses the LL corner positions. For that CLL I
        do 10 moves: R' F' U' F U' R U R' U R I call that corner permutation
        "barrow" because it reminds me a wheel barrow. Regards, David J --- In

        You wrote: "Solving a Rubik's Cube blindfolded is not difficult. At all!
        All we need is a fairly good short-term memory and the persistence to
        learn the method." Maybe you should add the parenthetical remark:
        "Solving a Rubik's Cube blindfolded is not difficult. At all! (If you
        take the time to memorize it properly!) All we ..." because if you try
        to go really fast it is quite possible to start the resolution before
        you've actually properly committed the starting position to memory.
        That's especially true if you're racing other people. But it's certainly
        true that if you just want to be able to solve a cube blindfolded then
        it isn't at all difficult. I'll agree with you 100% on that. Your link
        near the bottom (http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/%
        20Richard/BlindfoldRevenge.pdf) doesn't seem to work. Looks like it is
        because of the extra space: %20.
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Richard/BlindfoldRevenge.pdf would
        be the correct link. That's an old document, a beginner method - I guess
        you could use this intermediate method one instead:
        http://www.math.columbia.edu/~carr/BCFTSS.pdf This is also not a great
        document but it is a little better - in particular, I never really wrote
        a good section on memorization and it's not as in-depth as it might be.
        If I ever finish the advanced method it will be much better (and take
        far fewer moves on average). As far as I know, BCFTSS is the only method
        that gives an exact expected number of moves for solution (assuming
        non-cancellation between stages which I really didn't want to go into).

        observations - I'll admit that I haven't read it all, so maybe these are
        uninformed! i) Cycle Decomposition Algorithm 1. Locate the smallest
        number that has not been written (the first time this number is 1). a.
        If such number exists, write down "(" and then that number. b. If all
        numbers have been written, stop. 2. Find the last number that was
        written. Determine to which spot this corner needs to be moved. a. If
        the number of this spot has not been written, write it down and repeat
        step 2. b. If the number of this spot has been written, write ")" to end
        the cycle. Go to step 1. Just a small point: this seems to indicate that
        you are allowed to write stuff down. Surely that's against the rules.
        "iii. Edge Permutation Edge orientation is the hardest part of blindfold
        cubing" ^^^^^^^^^^^ Actually, having written the below I realize you
        have discussed exactly what I am saying. "iv) ..." Just as a note - you
        could reduce to 4 corners and 4 edges to be cycled (and then solve with
        "U" for instance). In the cycle set up that would be easier perhaps.
        It's immediately obvious whether you will need to do this stage if you
        are memorizing cycles and you could adjust the cycles mentally at the
        start to solve to the stage where you just need to do "U" at the end.
        This would result in a much faster resolution at the end. (Those skills
        are necessary anyway, if you want to be able to learn to blindfold solve
        from one given scrambled position to another.)

        Hi Richard, Thank you for the comments. &gt; Maybe you should add the
        parenthetical remark: &gt; &gt; "Solving a Rubik's Cube blindfolded is
        not difficult. At all! (If &gt; you take the time to memorize it
        properly!) All we ..." &gt; &gt; because if you try to go really fast it
        is quite possible to start &gt; the resolution before you've actually
        properly committed the &gt; starting position to memory. That's
        especially true if you're racing &gt; other people. But it's certainly
        true that if you just want to be &gt; able to solve a cube blindfolded
        then it isn't at all difficult. &gt; I'll agree with you 100% on that.
        Haha, you're quite right. I'll add that with "(Richard Carr adds, 'If
        you take....')" &gt; Your link near the bottom
        (http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/% &gt;
        20Richard/BlindfoldRevenge.pdf) doesn't seem to work. Looks like it &gt;
        is because of the extra space: %20. &gt;
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Richard/BlindfoldRevenge.pdf &gt;
        would be the correct link. &gt; That's an old document, a beginner
        method - I guess you could use &gt; this intermediate method one
        instead: &gt; &gt; http://www.math.columbia.edu/~carr/BCFTSS.pdf My
        apologies for the mistake. I'll fix the first and add this new link as
        well. This is quite an impressive collection of algorithms, plus theory
        for Megaminx! Cool stuff. I also rewrote the cubie names according to
        your "U&lt;D&lt;F&lt;B&lt;R&lt;L." &gt; i) Cycle Decomposition Algorithm
        &gt; 1. Locate the smallest number that has not been written (the first
        &gt; time this number is 1). &gt; a. If such number exists, write down
        "(" and then that number. &gt; b. If all numbers have been written,
        stop. &gt; 2. Find the last number that was written. Determine to which
        spot &gt; this corner needs to be moved. &gt; a. If the number of this
        spot has not been written, write it &gt; down and repeat step 2. &gt; b.
        If the number of this spot has been written, write ")" to &gt; end the
        cycle. Go to step 1. &gt; &gt; Just a small point: this seems to
        indicate that you are allowed to &gt; write stuff down. Surely that's
        against the rules. Right. I added, "In official attempts, writing down
        or reading anything is not permitted. However, using a piece of paper to
        write down the needed information for each step is a good practice when
        first working with cycles." &gt; "iii. Edge Permutation &gt; &gt; Edge
        orientation is the hardest part of blindfold cubing" &gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^
        Fixed. &gt; Actually, having written the below I realize you have
        discussed &gt; exactly what I am saying. &gt; &gt; "iv) ..." &gt; &gt;
        Just as a note - you could reduce to 4 corners and 4 edges to be &gt;
        cycled (and then solve with "U" for instance). In the cycle set up &gt;
        that would be easier perhaps. It's immediately obvious whether you &gt;
        will need to do this stage if you are memorizing cycles and you &gt;
        could adjust the cycles mentally at the start to solve to the stage &gt;
        where you just need to do "U" at the end. This would result in a &gt;
        much faster resolution at the end. (Those skills are necessary &gt;
        anyway, if you want to be able to learn to blindfold solve from one &gt;
        given scrambled position to another.) I was writing about doing U at the
        beginning of the solve, but you're right, you could modify the cycles
        just as easily to do U at the end. I'll also add a sentence about that.
        Much thanks, Macky

        Hes from India!!! It feels great to have someone from ur country doing
        speedcubing. Ron had told me about him long back. Heres a news article
        about him :

        another one bt this is in Tamil which i dont understand:

        Yes, but I figured he wanted to know the absolute minimum. And it's
        usually not too hard to remove the center caps, is it? I'd rather switch
        the stickers, though ;-). Not because it might be easier (depends on the
        cube) but because the caps are a semi-functional part and I always try
        to put everything back where it came from (that's for example the reason
        I usually only remove one center at a time). Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Hi James :-) For the 4x4x4 revenge/master cube i use the same system as
        i do for the 5x5x5 wahn/professor cube. The basic steps are as follows:
        (I call this the "Cage" method. ) 1. Do first layer completely. This is
        intuitive. If some centers are "tricky" to solve they can be left for
        later if so desired. basically i solve the cubies in the order i see
        them. Cubies that make up blocks are inserted into first layer as a
        block also, when possible. 2. (First twist the middle layers into
        favorable positions. U can get quite a few edges and/or centers for free
        by doing this.) Now do middle layers edges. This is done by and large
        with commutator 3- cycles. Also here one can cycle blocks of cubies when
        solving them. Either to solve several edges at the same time or remove
        badly placed edges (move to final layer where i do most of the
        "fishing") or move bad edges to a better position within the middle
        layers. 3. Final layer corners. First position them (only 2 algs needed)
        then orient them (there are 6 easy cases for this). 4. Now solve all
        last layer edges with 3-cycles. This is perhaps the most tricky step. I
        use easy commutator 3-cycles with very few setup moves. In fact the
        setup is never more than 1 single move. The most difficult thing about
        this is to recognize which 3-cycle to do next. I normally look for
        3-cycles that will solve 2 edges with same 3-cycle. So i do a quick
        "scan" tracking the edges and see if that is possible. If not i just
        settle for a 3-cycle solving 1 edge only. There is of coz the parity
        which means im left with only 2 edges to swap. This is fairly easy also.
        This is fixed with an inner slice turn and a edge 3- cycle on this
        layer. In most cases some setup moves are needed (at most 2 moves).
        Remember that it doesn't matter that my parity fix will mess w the
        centers. With some luck block 3-cycles can also be used efficiently. 5.
        Do all the remaining centers with yet more 3-cycles. Block cycles where
        possible. With practice u can achieve good cancellations btw 2 succesive
        3-cycles : (simple example) r'urUr'u'd'rU'r'dr - 4 moves are cancelled.
        There are also some other center-algs that works on oppsite faces. One
        example : (r2b2)*2 Benefits of this method are: - U solve the cubies
        into their home position all the time. There is no tricky parts where u
        just solve cubies relative to eachother like when pairing up edgesw
        Chris' method. - Doing lots of 3-cycle it's easy to foresee where all
        pieces are going so u get excellent lookahead and very good flow in ur
        solves most of the time. - Mistakes u do early are not so fatal. There
        is usually easy fix for simple mistakes. - U don't rely on a fast 3x3x3
        method to do the last stage for u. My method has no "3x3x3-stage" at
        all. - Only one parity, not two. One disadvantage is that i probably
        need about 25% more moves as compared w Chris' method. So u really have
        to be a grandmaster of commutator 3-cycles and utilise block cycling as
        much as u can. And u need to make sure u get a good flow. A typical
        solve for me goes like this : - (15 secs) First layer done - (30 secs)
        Middle layer edges done - (50-55 secs) Last layer done - (70-75 secs)
        All centers are done. Cube is SOLVED!! That's it for the 4x4x4 method.
        The 5x5x5 method has a few more special cases. A list of these: - Make
        sure while orienting the middle layers after solving first layer that
        the extreme middle layer is twisted such that the middle centers end up
        in correct location. So u are can actually only twist 2 of the 3 middle
        layers freely. Umm u can choose to willingly set up the 4-spot pattern.
        But i never do that. - For last layer edges i would do the middle edges
        first. This is actually a separate step since u can't mix middle edges
        and outer edges. Doing the middle ones first gives easier recognition
        for solving the outer edges. - There are more special algs for
        exchanging centers between opposite faces. Example : (r2 E2)*2 or (Ff)
        r'u'r U r'u r U' (Ff)' Writing down these details make it cound more
        complicated then it really is ;-) Cheers! -Per

        I got mine today and they're great! Really good job! I've watched them

        work alright (I only say so because Ian mentioned problems with PCs on

        now I have it about Macky, too, after seeing him on the DVDs. Notice
        that Lars has a lot of long hair which covers his neck. It's a primary
        instinct of humans to feel vulnerable if the neck is open for attacks.
        So that's why we're nervous but not Lars, he's protected by his hair.
        Macky is somewhat similar. Not with hair, but with his long-sleeved
        shirt. And with the jacket he wears *additionally*! While everybody else
        is wearing T-shirts!!! Alright, now I'll let you praise me for exposing

        Hmmm. Interesting theory, Stefan. But my hair is even longer than Lars

        &gt; have it about Macky, too, after seeing him on the DVDs. Notice that
        &gt; Lars has a lot of long hair which covers his neck. It's a primary
        &gt; instinct of humans to feel vulnerable if the neck is open for
        attacks. &gt; So that's why we're nervous but not Lars, he's protected
        by his hair. &gt; Macky is somewhat similar. Not with hair, but with his
        long-sleeved &gt; shirt. And with the jacket he wears *additionally*!

        Hi guys ! I made finally a tutorial for how to assemble the Eastsheen
        4x4x4 cube. I have seen many (mostly bad) descriptions how to do this.
        Most of them have seemed too complicated using various tricks such as
        loosen all the screws. It's surprisingly easy to put it back together.
        But yes u need to screw off one of the inner centers in order to do it
        my way. Here is the link :
        http://vakt.idi.ntnu.no/apartment/Eastsheen_4x4x4.htm Hope that some
        will find it useful. I must admit that first time ever i assembled that
        cube it took me ages. It wasn't until a little later i found an easy way
        to put it back together. Actually it's no wonder why this puzzle locks
        so badly when there are so many pieces :-o Cheers! -Per PS! I hate the
        eastsheen 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 for speeding. 4x4x4 version locks horribly and
        5x5x5 version pops horribly as well as locks too much for my liking :-(

        I've been doing a lot of serious pondering concerning last layer methods
        recently, since my job now affords me the time. I have a couple of
        observations and would like to pose a few questions, as well as a
        strategy I feel might be worth consideration. Apologies if anyone has
        come up with this before, but I've not heard of this, so I'm currently
        assuming I'm the only one. Yay me. =D First off, I know that Macky uses
        partial edge control during the F2L. I also know that Chris Hardwick and
        others are using ZBF2L. I understand this is a good way to cut down on
        your LL and recognization times, while only increasing your F2L times by
        a smaller amount. I also know most of the people doing this are using
        either a 2 or 3 look approach to follow it, with either OLL+PLL,
        COLL+PLL, or what have you. I don't think ZB is a realistic approach for
        most of us (sane cubers ;D). This can make for fast times in either
        case, but I think it can be improved upon, without resorting to ZBLL
        (for those of us who are far too lazy, such as myself). I started
        learning the Roux method a while back, and managed some relative success
        with it, despite doing corners in two looks, and not learning the 26
        special optimization cases or any of the fun tricks. I managed times in
        the low 20's, and was slightly faster than my 3 and 4 look LBL method at
        the time. This is where I began to consider CLL and COLL based
        strategies as competitive. I've since learned most of the PLL and some
        more tricks, and have been neglecting my Roux practicing lately. I
        decided to learn the CLL+ELL, both to help prevent me from being a basic
        Fridrich clone, and to help me with my occasional Roux solving. It also
        helps for 2x2x2, apparently, because I took my first averages for it
        yesterday, and managed a couple of 5.xx and few 6.xx solves. What if
        someone were to comprise a method using basic F2L with partial edge
        control only when the case is easy? This would cut down on how much your
        F2L would be slowed down, at least on average. You would of course need
        ELL algorithms to be able to finish in most cases, then. Next, if the
        method included both COLL algs and CLL algs that flip edges, you would
        have much better odds of obtaining a lucky case for your ELL step, often
        rendering it a simple edge only PLL. In the worst cases, you'd still
        wind up with only slightly longer LL times because of the comparison of
        ELL against pure edge PLL, but I think you'd make that up in time saved
        on the F2L and through lucky cases. As near as I can tell on my
        extremely quick number crunching, here are the approximate algorithm
        requirements for various last layer strategies: OLL+PLL: 57+21=78
        Partial Edge Control+OLL+PLL: 8+7 to 57+21=36 to 86 CLL+ELL: 40+29=69
        EOLL+COLL+PLL: 2+40+4=46 Partial Edge Control+COLL+PLL: 8+40+4=52
        ZBF2L+COLL+PLL: 306+40+4=350 (or fewer; I'm not certain) ZBF2L+ZBLL:
        306+493=799 Proposed method: 8+40+40+29=117 (partial edge
        control+C/COLL+ELL/PLL) If you discount reflections, most of these
        numbers will be less. The total number of algs for the proposed method
        would be cut down to something like 8+24+24+19=75, giving it an small
        fraction of the algorithms necessary for anything ZB, but with the added
        advantage of more lucky scenarios and easy recognition on the each of
        the cases for corners. All you would have to distinguish above and
        beyond either the CLL or COLL case to perform would be which of those to
        use, depending on the number of correctly oriented edges, and whether or
        not you want to flip any. It seems at first glance, that if you double
        the number of algorithms in your repertoire like this, you can
        effectively double the number of lucky situations you can achieve. I'm
        interested to hear what everyone thinks, and definitely what anyone who
        already uses a CLL or COLL approach thinks, especially as a viable
        alternative to ZBLL for most of us (I'm looking at you, Chris Hardwick),
        so if you have any thoughts or suggestions, fire away. -Mike 'putting

        Hey Mike, Thanks for your LL post, it was really interesting reading it,
        and my comments are below. First off, I would like to add one more
        option to your LL approach list. I seriously doubt I will be ready to
        use much ZB tricks by WC2005, but there is one idea that I think I may
        be ready for, and would like to practice to see if it has any merit.
        ZBF2L+OLL+PLL: 306+7+21=334 This idea has the advantage of using
        Fridrich PLL (very fast) and also only the 7 OLL algs that flip corners
        (all VERY fast). The F2L would of course be longer, but a lot of COLL
        algs are very fast and very easy to recognize, so on the easiest cases I
        would still do COLL. And of course the easiest to execute and recognize
        ZBLL algs as well. I'm still doubtful of this variation, but I think it
        might be a better option than COLL/PLL for me at least for WC2005. So
        add that the to your list too. This can also have the variation: Partial
        edge control+OLL+PLL which you already mentioned, so of course ZBF2L is
        not required. About your proposed method, I think it is a good idea. The
        only hard part I see is to know , for each CLL case, which edges are
        flipped. Of course just because something is hard doesn't mean you
        shouldn't do it too :-D The way I see it CLL has a 1/8 chance of not
        only solving corners, but flipping all edges correctly, leaving a fast
        edge PLL (or a 1/12 skip). Also I'm really starting to like COLL/PLL as
        well as a LL ending. The 1/12 chance of a PLL skip comes in handy, as
        well as the always very fast PLL alg. So I also agree that this is a
        good strategy. Personally I think this strategy is a good idea. It
        doesn't require a huge number of algs, or decisions while finishing the
        F2L or for the CLL/COLL step. I think delaying won't be a problem once
        mastered, and the ending would be very fast too. You may want to keep
        the fast OLL algs too, since Fridrich PLL is very fast. Say if you get
        the oriention that looks like the T (B U L U' L' B' to setup) then just
        do the OLL. Also, one thing you may want to think about for the 4th pair
        are ZBF2L algs where all edges are correctly, or incorrectly flipped.
        These cases are all very easy to notice, and the algs are all very fast
        to execute. It would require you to learn roughly 25 more algs, since
        most standard F2L algs are the ones that preserve edge orientation. In
        general flipping all edges while doing the 4th pair takes very slightly
        longer than the algs for preserving edge orientation, but not very much.
        So that might be something you could look into if you want to expand
        that step, but otherwise I think partial edge control is enough. I think
        this would be a good option for a LL technque, I mean the more algs you
        know towards achieving a lucky case, the more likely you are to get
        lucky. And your method has the option of CLL also orienting all edges
        (and also the 1/8 * 1/12 = 1/96 chance of a 1 look LL, but only for algs
        that flip edges), and COLL skipping PLL step 1/12. If you're interested
        I can give you what I consider the easiest ZBF2L cases (only about 5 or
        6 or so) that are all easy to recognize and really really short. You
        could add that to partial edge control and have a better chance of
        ending up with oriented edges. I say go for it, the method sounds good
        to me :-D Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Mike

        Yay me. =D &gt; &gt; First off, I know that Macky uses partial edge
        control during the F2L. I also know that Chris Hardwick and others are
        using ZBF2L. I understand this is a good way to cut down on your LL and
        recognization times, while only increasing your F2L times by a smaller
        amount. I also know most of the people doing this are using either a 2
        or 3 look approach to follow it, with either OLL+PLL, COLL+PLL, or what
        have you. I don't think ZB is a realistic approach for most of us (sane
        cubers ;D). This can make for fast times in either case, but I think it
        can be improved upon, without resorting to ZBLL (for those of us who are
        far too lazy, such as myself). &gt; &gt; I started learning the Roux
        method a while back, and managed some relative success with it, despite
        doing corners in two looks, and not learning the 26 special optimization
        cases or any of the fun tricks. I managed times in the low 20's, and was
        slightly faster than my 3 and 4 look LBL method at the time. This is
        where I began to consider CLL and COLL based strategies as competitive.
        I've since learned most of the PLL and some more tricks, and have been
        neglecting my Roux practicing lately. I decided to learn the CLL+ELL,
        both to help prevent me from being a basic Fridrich clone, and to help
        me with my occasional Roux solving. It also helps for 2x2x2, apparently,
        because I took my first averages for it yesterday, and managed a couple
        of 5.xx and few 6.xx solves. &gt; &gt; What if someone were to comprise
        a method using basic F2L with partial edge control only when the case is
        easy? This would cut down on how much your F2L would be slowed down, at
        least on average. You would of course need ELL algorithms to be able to
        finish in most cases, then. Next, if the method included both COLL algs
        and CLL algs that flip edges, you would have much better odds of
        obtaining a lucky case for your ELL step, often rendering it a simple
        edge only PLL. In the worst cases, you'd still wind up with only
        slightly longer LL times because of the comparison of ELL against pure
        edge PLL, but I think you'd make that up in time saved on the F2L and
        through lucky cases. &gt; &gt; As near as I can tell on my extremely
        quick number crunching, here are the approximate algorithm requirements
        for various last layer strategies: &gt; OLL+PLL: 57+21=78 &gt; Partial
        Edge Control+OLL+PLL: 8+7 to 57+21=36 to 86 &gt; CLL+ELL: 40+29=69 &gt;
        EOLL+COLL+PLL: 2+40+4=46 &gt; Partial Edge Control+COLL+PLL: 8+40+4=52
        &gt; ZBF2L+COLL+PLL: 306+40+4=350 (or fewer; I'm not certain) &gt;
        ZBF2L+ZBLL: 306+493=799 &gt; Proposed method: 8+40+40+29=117 &gt;
        (partial edge control+C/COLL+ELL/PLL) &gt; &gt; If you discount
        reflections, most of these numbers will be less. The total number of
        algs for the proposed method would be cut down to something like
        8+24+24+19=75, giving it an small fraction of the algorithms necessary
        for anything ZB, but with the added advantage of more lucky scenarios
        and easy recognition on the each of the cases for corners. All you would
        have to distinguish above and beyond either the CLL or COLL case to
        perform would be which of those to use, depending on the number of
        correctly oriented edges, and whether or not you want to flip any. It
        seems at first glance, that if you double the number of algorithms in
        your repertoire like this, you can effectively double the number of
        lucky situations you can achieve. &gt; &gt; I'm interested to hear what
        everyone thinks, and definitely what anyone who already uses a CLL or
        COLL approach thinks, especially as a viable alternative to ZBLL for
        most of us (I'm looking at you, Chris Hardwick), so if you have any
        thoughts or suggestions, fire away. &gt; &gt; -Mike 'putting way too

        Thanks for reading the post. It took me entirely too long to write,
        seeing as it was 1 in the morning here. I definitely thought about that
        one, but forgot to add it. 306+57+21=384 cases. (The last pair could be
        solved for you, leaving you with any OLL case) I only know a small
        portion of the CLL and a slightly larger chunk of the COLL. Still, even
        using the basic approach of a 3 look LL (2 look OLL+1 look PLL), it's
        easy to recognize the cases I know. When I look at the corner
        orientation, I really don't pay much attention to edges, only noticing
        if all are correct or some. Because I try to follow them during the end
        of my F2L, this is usually not a problem. When all are correct,
        obviously I use the COLL case. And when either some or none are, I use
        the CLL algorithm. Easy cases for the ELL include most of the cases
        where no edges are correct, the cases where all of the edges are
        correct, and several cases where either two adjacent or two opposing
        edges are correct. This leaves something like 1/3 of the ELL cases as
        very easy or lucky, with the others only lagging behind a bit. If 1/3 of
        cases wind up as either lucky or very easy, I think this gives the
        method a definite shot at being competitive with other methods. In
        general, I think this method also has an advantage due to incremental
        upgradability. For the time being, I'm using normal F2L with some
        partial edge control, then flipping any remaining edges, then using
        COLL+PLL. I think I'm going to finish learning the COLL first, followed
        the ELL. This will help out on solves where I still have a pair of edges
        to flip after the F2L. I'll learn CLL last, since it requires ELL in
        some cases. First, though, I'm interested in the ZBF2L cases you
        mentioneed. For only 25 or so more algs, most of which I would imagine
        to be rather short, I think that sounds like a fantastic idea. Adding
        those cases to the repertoire for the F2L would provide additional easy
        or lucky cases, and I hope it would help cancel some of the worst ELL
        cases, but that's only a hope. If you give me a list of the algs you
        think would be most useful for this, I can do some testing and see which
        would cancel. For the easier cases, I know a few of the OLL's, including
        the one you mentioned, and I use them when possible. Thanks for the
        input. Now all we need is a snappy name for it... =D -Mike Bennett -----

        AM Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: New LL strategy proposal Hey Mike,
        Thanks for your LL post, it was really interesting reading it, and my
        comments are below. First off, I would like to add one more option to
        your LL approach list. I seriously doubt I will be ready to use much ZB
        tricks by WC2005, but there is one idea that I think I may be ready for,
        and would like to practice to see if it has any merit. ZBF2L+OLL+PLL:
        306+7+21=334 This idea has the advantage of using Fridrich PLL (very
        fast) and also only the 7 OLL algs that flip corners (all VERY fast).
        The F2L would of course be longer, but a lot of COLL algs are very fast
        and very easy to recognize, so on the easiest cases I would still do
        COLL. And of course the easiest to execute and recognize ZBLL algs as
        well. I'm still doubtful of this variation, but I think it might be a
        better option than COLL/PLL for me at least for WC2005. So add that the
        to your list too. This can also have the variation: Partial edge
        control+OLL+PLL which you already mentioned, so of course ZBF2L is not
        required. About your proposed method, I think it is a good idea. The
        only hard part I see is to know , for each CLL case, which edges are
        flipped. Of course just because something is hard doesn't mean you
        shouldn't do it too :-D The way I see it CLL has a 1/8 chance of not
        only solving corners, but flipping all edges correctly, leaving a fast
        edge PLL (or a 1/12 skip). Also I'm really starting to like COLL/PLL as
        well as a LL ending. The 1/12 chance of a PLL skip comes in handy, as
        well as the always very fast PLL alg. So I also agree that this is a
        good strategy. Personally I think this strategy is a good idea. It
        doesn't require a huge number of algs, or decisions while finishing the
        F2L or for the CLL/COLL step. I think delaying won't be a problem once
        mastered, and the ending would be very fast too. You may want to keep
        the fast OLL algs too, since Fridrich PLL is very fast. Say if you get
        the oriention that looks like the T (B U L U' L' B' to setup) then just
        do the OLL. Also, one thing you may want to think about for the 4th pair
        are ZBF2L algs where all edges are correctly, or incorrectly flipped.
        These cases are all very easy to notice, and the algs are all very fast
        to execute. It would require you to learn roughly 25 more algs, since
        most standard F2L algs are the ones that preserve edge orientation. In
        general flipping all edges while doing the 4th pair takes very slightly
        longer than the algs for preserving edge orientation, but not very much.
        So that might be something you could look into if you want to expand
        that step, but otherwise I think partial edge control is enough. I think
        this would be a good option for a LL technque, I mean the more algs you
        know towards achieving a lucky case, the more likely you are to get
        lucky. And your method has the option of CLL also orienting all edges
        (and also the 1/8 * 1/12 = 1/96 chance of a 1 look LL, but only for algs
        that flip edges), and COLL skipping PLL step 1/12. If you're interested
        I can give you what I consider the easiest ZBF2L cases (only about 5 or
        6 or so) that are all easy to recognize and really really short. You
        could add that to partial edge control and have a better chance of
        ending up with oriented edges. I say go for it, the method sounds good
        to me :-D Chris [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]

        Hey Mike, Here are the fastest ZBF2L algs in my opinion. This list
        should also include all the "standard" F2L algs, which are very fast
        compared to most ZBF2L algs. I inlcuded the "standard" alg with all the
        cases I put down here, but you really should include all of them.
        http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zbf2l1.html All of these algs are fast
        and easy to recognize, and I think knowing all of these is a very
        powerful, useful tool to have in your belt so to speak. For all the algs
        listed below, do the inverse to set up the case: The groups are done by
        F2L case, so when the numbering goes back to 1, that's a new F2L case.
        1) R U' R' F' U2 F 2) R U2 R' U F' U2 F 1) F' U' F U' R U2 R' 2) F' U2 F
        R U2 R' 3) R U' R2 F R F' 4) R U' R' U R U' R' 1) F' U F R U R' 2) R U

        F2 U' F2 U' F' 1) F' L' B' U B L F 2) R U' R' U2 F' U' F 1) R U R2 F R
        F2 U' F 2) (U) F' U F U' F' U' F 1) R U R' F' U' F 2) F' L F' L' F2 (THE
        fastest ZBF2L alg, other than RUR') 3) F' U' F U' F' U F 1) F' U2 F2 R'

        http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zbf2l13.html These are all fairly
        intuitive, and don't require memorizing for each alg, but rather just
        the patterns seen in each case. These are optional though. So total
        count is 23 if you learn all the ones from the zbf2l1.html page as well
        as the individual ones I listed. If you learn the optional ones on
        zbf2l13.html it's an additional 7 (you already know one of the 8 cases
        as the "standard" F2L case). So 23 algs that are all very fast, or if
        you want the additional 7 it is 30 overall. The cases on zbf2l13.html
        aren't really among the fastest cases, but they all follow a similar
        pattern, and you can quickly learn how to do all 8 cases once you find
        the pattern. Hope this helps, Chris --- In

        list of the algs you think would be most useful for this, I can do some
        testing and see which would cancel. For the easier cases, I know a few

        using Fridrich PLL (very fast) and also &gt; only the 7 OLL algs that
        flip corners (all VERY fast). The F2L would &gt; of course be longer,
        but a lot of COLL algs are very fast and very &gt; easy to recognize, so
        on the easiest cases I would still do COLL. And &gt; of course the
        easiest to execute and recognize ZBLL algs as well. &gt; &gt; I'm still
        doubtful of this variation, but I think it might be a better &gt; option
        than COLL/PLL for me at least for WC2005. So add that the to &gt; your
        list too. This can also have the variation: &gt; &gt; Partial edge
        control+OLL+PLL which you already mentioned, so of course &gt; ZBF2L is
        not required. &gt; &gt; About your proposed method, I think it is a good
        idea. The only hard &gt; part I see is to know , for each CLL case,
        which edges are flipped. &gt; Of course just because something is hard
        doesn't mean you shouldn't do &gt; it too :-D The way I see it CLL has a
        1/8 chance of not only solving &gt; corners, but flipping all edges
        correctly, leaving a fast edge PLL (or &gt; a 1/12 skip). &gt; &gt; Also
        I'm really starting to like COLL/PLL as well as a LL ending. The &gt;
        1/12 chance of a PLL skip comes in handy, as well as the always very
        &gt; fast PLL alg. So I also agree that this is a good strategy. &gt;
        &gt; Personally I think this strategy is a good idea. It doesn't require
        a &gt; huge number of algs, or decisions while finishing the F2L or for
        the &gt; CLL/COLL step. I think delaying won't be a problem once
        mastered, and &gt; the ending would be very fast too. &gt; &gt; You may
        want to keep the fast OLL algs too, since Fridrich PLL is very &gt;
        fast. Say if you get the oriention that looks like the T (B U L U' L'
        &gt; B' to setup) then just do the OLL. &gt; &gt; Also, one thing you
        may want to think about for the 4th pair are ZBF2L &gt; algs where all
        edges are correctly, or incorrectly flipped. These &gt; cases are all
        very easy to notice, and the algs are all very fast to &gt; execute. It
        would require you to learn roughly 25 more algs, since &gt; most
        standard F2L algs are the ones that preserve edge orientation. &gt; &gt;
        In general flipping all edges while doing the 4th pair takes very &gt;
        slightly longer than the algs for preserving edge orientation, but not
        &gt; very much. So that might be something you could look into if you
        want &gt; to expand that step, but otherwise I think partial edge
        control is enough. &gt; &gt; I think this would be a good option for a
        LL technque, I mean the more &gt; algs you know towards achieving a
        lucky case, the more likely you are &gt; to get lucky. And your method
        has the option of CLL also orienting &gt; all edges (and also the 1/8 *
        1/12 = 1/96 chance of a 1 look LL, but &gt; only for algs that flip
        edges), and COLL skipping PLL step 1/12. &gt; &gt; If you're interested
        I can give you what I consider the easiest ZBF2L &gt; cases (only about
        5 or 6 or so) that are all easy to recognize and &gt; really really
        short. You could add that to partial edge control and &gt; have a better
        chance of ending up with oriented edges. &gt; &gt; I say go for it, the
        method sounds good to me :-D &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; [Non-text

        navigation, that aren't a seperate frame. There are the pros and cons of

        Hi Chris/Mike I havent really been following this because I dont have
        experience on COLL and all those things. However your (Chris') point
        about Fridrich PLL and the 7 corner flips in OLL is exactly the LL
        situation I solve when I use my L2L1 strategy and I can vouch for how
        fast abnd easily recognisable it is. Im not sure how the other L2L
        strategies compare with what Mike is proposing. They use less algorithms
        but as they dont use CE pairs so much they are probably a little less
        efficient on the F2L. Nevertheless you might find something useful in
        there! Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From: "cmhardw"

        &gt; Hey Mike, &gt; &gt; Thanks for your LL post, it was really
        interesting reading it, and my &gt; comments are below. &gt; &gt; First
        off, I would like to add one more option to your LL approach &gt; list.
        I seriously doubt I will be ready to use much ZB tricks by &gt; WC2005,
        but there is one idea that I think I may be ready for, and &gt; would
        like to practice to see if it has any merit. &gt; &gt; ZBF2L+OLL+PLL:
        306+7+21=334 &gt; &gt; This idea has the advantage of using Fridrich PLL
        (very fast) and also &gt; only the 7 OLL algs that flip corners (all
        VERY fast). The F2L would &gt; of course be longer, but a lot of COLL
        algs are very fast and very &gt; easy to recognize, so on the easiest
        cases I would still do COLL. And &gt; of course the easiest to execute
        and recognize ZBLL algs as well. &gt; &gt; I'm still doubtful of this
        variation, but I think it might be a better &gt; option than COLL/PLL
        for me at least for WC2005. So add that the to &gt; your list too. This
        can also have the variation: &gt; &gt; Partial edge control+OLL+PLL
        which you already mentioned, so of course &gt; ZBF2L is not required.
        &gt; &gt; About your proposed method, I think it is a good idea. The
        only hard &gt; part I see is to know , for each CLL case, which edges
        are flipped. &gt; Of course just because something is hard doesn't mean
        you shouldn't do &gt; it too :-D The way I see it CLL has a 1/8 chance
        of not only solving &gt; corners, but flipping all edges correctly,
        leaving a fast edge PLL (or &gt; a 1/12 skip). &gt; &gt; Also I'm really
        starting to like COLL/PLL as well as a LL ending. The &gt; 1/12 chance
        of a PLL skip comes in handy, as well as the always very &gt; fast PLL
        alg. So I also agree that this is a good strategy. &gt; &gt; Personally
        I think this strategy is a good idea. It doesn't require a &gt; huge
        number of algs, or decisions while finishing the F2L or for the &gt;
        CLL/COLL step. I think delaying won't be a problem once mastered, and
        &gt; the ending would be very fast too. &gt; &gt; You may want to keep
        the fast OLL algs too, since Fridrich PLL is very &gt; fast. Say if you
        get the oriention that looks like the T (B U L U' L' &gt; B' to setup)
        then just do the OLL. &gt; &gt; Also, one thing you may want to think
        about for the 4th pair are ZBF2L &gt; algs where all edges are
        correctly, or incorrectly flipped. These &gt; cases are all very easy to
        notice, and the algs are all very fast to &gt; execute. It would require
        you to learn roughly 25 more algs, since &gt; most standard F2L algs are
        the ones that preserve edge orientation. &gt; &gt; In general flipping
        all edges while doing the 4th pair takes very &gt; slightly longer than
        the algs for preserving edge orientation, but not &gt; very much. So
        that might be something you could look into if you want &gt; to expand
        that step, but otherwise I think partial edge control is enough. &gt;
        &gt; I think this would be a good option for a LL technque, I mean the
        more &gt; algs you know towards achieving a lucky case, the more likely
        you are &gt; to get lucky. And your method has the option of CLL also
        orienting &gt; all edges (and also the 1/8 * 1/12 = 1/96 chance of a 1
        look LL, but &gt; only for algs that flip edges), and COLL skipping PLL
        step 1/12. &gt; &gt; If you're interested I can give you what I consider
        the easiest ZBF2L &gt; cases (only about 5 or 6 or so) that are all easy
        to recognize and &gt; really really short. You could add that to partial
        edge control and &gt; have a better chance of ending up with oriented
        edges. &gt; &gt; I say go for it, the method sounds good to me :-D &gt;

        been doing a lot of serious pondering concerning last layer &gt; methods
        recently, since my job now affords me the time. I have a &gt; couple of
        observations and would like to pose a few questions, as well &gt; as a
        strategy I feel might be worth consideration. Apologies if &gt; anyone
        has come up with this before, but I've not heard of this, so &gt; I'm
        currently assuming I'm the only one. Yay me. =D &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        First off, I know that Macky uses partial edge control during the &gt;
        F2L. I also know that Chris Hardwick and others are using ZBF2L. I &gt;
        understand this is a good way to cut down on your LL and recognization
        &gt; times, while only increasing your F2L times by a smaller amount. I
        &gt; also know most of the people doing this are using either a 2 or 3
        look &gt; approach to follow it, with either OLL+PLL, COLL+PLL, or what
        have &gt; you. I don't think ZB is a realistic approach for most of us
        (sane &gt; cubers ;D). This can make for fast times in either case, but
        I think &gt; it can be improved upon, without resorting to ZBLL (for
        those of us &gt; who are far too lazy, such as myself). &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I started learning the Roux method a while back, and managed some
        &gt; relative success with it, despite doing corners in two looks, and
        not &gt; learning the 26 special optimization cases or any of the fun
        tricks. &gt; I managed times in the low 20's, and was slightly faster
        than my 3 and &gt; 4 look LBL method at the time. This is where I began
        to consider CLL &gt; and COLL based strategies as competitive. I've
        since learned most of &gt; the PLL and some more tricks, and have been
        neglecting my Roux &gt; practicing lately. I decided to learn the
        CLL+ELL, both to help &gt; prevent me from being a basic Fridrich clone,
        and to help me with my &gt; occasional Roux solving. It also helps for
        2x2x2, apparently, because &gt; I took my first averages for it
        yesterday, and managed a couple of &gt; 5.xx and few 6.xx solves. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; What if someone were to comprise a method using basic F2L
        with &gt; partial edge control only when the case is easy? This would
        cut down &gt; on how much your F2L would be slowed down, at least on
        average. You &gt; would of course need ELL algorithms to be able to
        finish in most &gt; cases, then. Next, if the method included both COLL
        algs and CLL algs &gt; that flip edges, you would have much better odds
        of obtaining a lucky &gt; case for your ELL step, often rendering it a
        simple edge only PLL. In &gt; the worst cases, you'd still wind up with
        only slightly longer LL &gt; times because of the comparison of ELL
        against pure edge PLL, but I &gt; think you'd make that up in time saved
        on the F2L and through lucky cases. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As near as I can
        tell on my extremely quick number crunching, here &gt; are the
        approximate algorithm requirements for various last layer &gt;
        strategies: &gt; &gt; OLL+PLL: 57+21=78 &gt; &gt; Partial Edge
        Control+OLL+PLL: 8+7 to 57+21=36 to 86 &gt; &gt; CLL+ELL: 40+29=69 &gt;
        &gt; EOLL+COLL+PLL: 2+40+4=46 &gt; &gt; Partial Edge Control+COLL+PLL:
        8+40+4=52 &gt; &gt; ZBF2L+COLL+PLL: 306+40+4=350 (or fewer; I'm &gt; not
        certain) &gt; &gt; ZBF2L+ZBLL: 306+493=799 &gt; &gt; Proposed method:
        8+40+40+29=117 &gt; &gt; (partial edge control+C/COLL+ELL/PLL) &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; If you discount reflections, most of these numbers will be
        less. &gt; The total number of algs for the proposed method would be cut
        down to &gt; something like 8+24+24+19=75, giving it an small fraction
        of the &gt; algorithms necessary for anything ZB, but with the added
        advantage of &gt; more lucky scenarios and easy recognition on the each
        of the cases for &gt; corners. All you would have to distinguish above
        and beyond either &gt; the CLL or COLL case to perform would be which of
        those to use, &gt; depending on the number of correctly oriented edges,
        and whether or &gt; not you want to flip any. It seems at first glance,
        that if you &gt; double the number of algorithms in your repertoire like
        this, you can &gt; effectively double the number of lucky situations you
        can achieve. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm interested to hear what everyone
        thinks, and definitely what &gt; anyone who already uses a CLL or COLL
        approach thinks, especially as a &gt; viable alternative to ZBLL for
        most of us (I'm looking at you, Chris &gt; Hardwick), so if you have any

        Hmmm ... U had 2 replies already. Non of them answered ut question ;-) I
        would say that as long as u can see that the centers are correctly
        solved it should be counted as solved (if the rest is also solved). This
        will of coz be at the judge discretion. But shouldn't be any problem
        unless too many center caps pop at same time :-o And yes, glue them
        down. It's enough to use superglue along one edge only. U can also cut
        out the inner plastic support bridges. Well at least my diy cube
        centercaps had those. But they were obstructed by the screws so i had to

        If I understand correctly, what you propose is: (1) Take care of
        last-layer edges orientation while solving the last pair, only if it's
        very fast. (2) Solve last layer corners before edges, using sequences
        that do not flip edges only if they're already correctly oriented thanks
        to (1). (3) Solve last layer edges, using mostly PLL sequences. What I
        think about it: (1) I'm not a F2L/OLL solver, but it looks like a good
        idea. I think a lot of Fridrich users try to do this, at least to avoid
        OLL cases with 4 misoriented edges. (2) Why not! The CLL and COLL sets
        have a lot in common. And you can ask Masayuki Akimoto, I think one of
        his goals last year was to find CLL sequences that solve edges
        orientation too. (3) That's where I disagree. Unfortunately, permuting
        oriented edges is not always faster than some other ELL cases. Take
        M'UMU2M'UM for example, or R'U'RUMU'R'Ur. They are VERY fast and
        frequent. (plus I feel a bit stupid when I have to 3-cycle edges of a
        side, it's much faster to 3-cycle edges of an inner slice with U2M'U2
        :-) ) In my opinion, the keys to faster solving are: 1) Learn a basic
        method perfectly. Train a lot, anticipate, practice fingers and mental
        dexterity, etc. 2) Multi-experts optimizations, or dynamic hybrid
        methods. Try to maximize lucky cases by choosing a technique or another.
        When the "method R3a-Z expert" in your head yells "Hey! This case is for
        me, I know that if you follow me, the chances for you to finish this
        cube fast are quite good!", listen to him. That's what you propose, and
        I totally agree with you. That's what I'm doing with the last 6 edges
        and 4 centers: Method 2 if I don't want to think at all, methods 1+3
        tricks when there's an obvious shortcut that can be detected fast, and
        sometimes ELL when the F2L are already solved. If at a given point of a
        solve you're given to choose between 2 possibilities, choose the one
        that is statistically the most powerful. But mixing different methods in
        real time is not easy. The criteria that will tell you to choose one way
        or another have to be very simple, because every step must be
        anticipated while executing/finishing the previous step. If you can't
        anticipate enough, you can't ready your fingers, and since we're trying
        to optimize for a few 1/10s it's often much easier to loose time. *IDEA*
        We could draw a graph of all methods and variations, that would tell
        you, step by step, what your choices are and how to decide. 3) Learn a
        lot of magical sequences. I don't believe in learning hundreds of cases
        to solve LL corners + permute edges. Since Lars or others introduced
        this idea, I've never understood why it makes people so excited (but
        it's fine if other people like this idea and have fun looking for all
        these sequences, I hope they'll prove me wrong -- Chris ;-) ). Gilles.

        serious pondering concerning last layer methods recently, since my job
        now affords me the time. I have a couple of observations and would like
        to pose a few questions, as well as a strategy I feel might be worth
        consideration. Apologies if anyone has come up with this before, but
        I've not heard of this, so I'm currently assuming I'm the only one. Yay
        me. =D &gt; &gt; First off, I know that Macky uses partial edge control
        during the F2L. I also know that Chris Hardwick and others are using
        ZBF2L. I understand this is a good way to cut down on your LL and
        recognization times, while only increasing your F2L times by a smaller
        amount. I also know most of the people doing this are using either a 2
        or 3 look approach to follow it, with either OLL+PLL, COLL+PLL, or what
        have you. I don't think ZB is a realistic approach for most of us (sane
        cubers ;D). This can make for fast times in either case, but I think it
        can be improved upon, without resorting to ZBLL (for those of us who are
        far too lazy, such as myself). &gt; &gt; I started learning the Roux
        method a while back, and managed some relative success with it, despite
        doing corners in two looks, and not learning the 26 special optimization
        cases or any of the fun tricks. I managed times in the low 20's, and was
        slightly faster than my 3 and 4 look LBL method at the time. This is
        where I began to consider CLL and COLL based strategies as competitive.
        I've since learned most of the PLL and some more tricks, and have been
        neglecting my Roux practicing lately. I decided to learn the CLL+ELL,
        both to help prevent me from being a basic Fridrich clone, and to help
        me with my occasional Roux solving. It also helps for 2x2x2, apparently,
        because I took my first averages for it yesterday, and managed a couple
        of 5.xx and few 6.xx solves. &gt; &gt; What if someone were to comprise
        a method using basic F2L with partial edge control only when the case is
        easy? This would cut down on how much your F2L would be slowed down, at
        least on average. You would of course need ELL algorithms to be able to
        finish in most cases, then. Next, if the method included both COLL algs
        and CLL algs that flip edges, you would have much better odds of
        obtaining a lucky case for your ELL step, often rendering it a simple
        edge only PLL. In the worst cases, you'd still wind up with only
        slightly longer LL times because of the comparison of ELL against pure
        edge PLL, but I think you'd make that up in time saved on the F2L and
        through lucky cases. &gt; &gt; As near as I can tell on my extremely
        quick number crunching, here are the approximate algorithm requirements
        for various last layer strategies: &gt; OLL+PLL: 57+21=78 &gt; Partial
        Edge Control+OLL+PLL: 8+7 to 57+21=36 to 86 &gt; CLL+ELL: 40+29=69 &gt;
        EOLL+COLL+PLL: 2+40+4=46 &gt; Partial Edge Control+COLL+PLL: 8+40+4=52
        &gt; ZBF2L+COLL+PLL: 306+40+4=350 (or fewer; I'm not certain) &gt;
        ZBF2L+ZBLL: 306+493=799 &gt; Proposed method: 8+40+40+29=117 &gt;
        (partial edge control+C/COLL+ELL/PLL) &gt; &gt; If you discount
        reflections, most of these numbers will be less. The total number of
        algs for the proposed method would be cut down to something like
        8+24+24+19=75, giving it an small fraction of the algorithms necessary
        for anything ZB, but with the added advantage of more lucky scenarios
        and easy recognition on the each of the cases for corners. All you would
        have to distinguish above and beyond either the CLL or COLL case to
        perform would be which of those to use, depending on the number of
        correctly oriented edges, and whether or not you want to flip any. It
        seems at first glance, that if you double the number of algorithms in
        your repertoire like this, you can effectively double the number of
        lucky situations you can achieve. &gt; &gt; I'm interested to hear what
        everyone thinks, and definitely what anyone who already uses a CLL or
        COLL approach thinks, especially as a viable alternative to ZBLL for
        most of us (I'm looking at you, Chris Hardwick), so if you have any
        thoughts or suggestions, fire away. &gt; &gt; -Mike 'putting way too

        This response actually applies to Dan's FMC contest as well... If you
        want to get more people to participate, I'd suggest not only giving

        giving a prize to the best newcomer (who has never participated before)

        I just read in Wired magazine that Ernö Rubik's birthday is July 13.
        Maybe this should be a holiday for us? I'll dedicate my solves that day
        to the man who has drained years from my life because of his invention,
        while at the same time provided years of joy and mental challenges. We
        should send him a gift... maybe some cubes? :) -Chris Parlette

        Hi all! We have started the planning of the Swedish Championship 2005.
        The dates are 10-11 September. We intend to have "noncommon" events
        (pyraminx, magic, no preinspection....) during the first day and the
        main events (3x3x3, 4x4x4... speedsolving) during the second day. The
        exact events and division between the two days will be decided upon
        later. The venue is still to be decided, but it will be in the city of
        Stockholm. SveKub &lt;www.svekub.se&gt; is the organiser and I will be
        the main contact person at present. We will have an open championship,
        thus allowing non-Swedes to participate. /Anders

        Ya really. The sunday contest is all about speed and i dont think i can
        achieve sub 30 times within 3-4 months now. So i am practically out of
        the competition. But surely i can try for the newcomer prize. For the

        question I have is whether people prefer a frame for navigation, the way
        that speedcubing.com is, and the way my site is now, or just links on
        the top or side of each page for navigation, that aren't a seperate
        frame. There are the pros and cons of both, so I just wanted to know
        what people thought. And anything else you'd like to say, tips,
        constructive criticism (about the site, not my spelling ;-) ) would be
        greatly appreciated. -Evan Until next time, Happy Cubing

        I am one of those who regularly participates in the Sunday Contest and

        idea, to encourage participation, is three fold: 1) Make it a draw 2)
        Make the winner ineligible for N tries( 6 is a good as any). This means
        that the winner is ineligible to win for 6 attempts. 3)If possible for
        every week you try, you get an additional entry into the draw. If you

        How about this: 1) 1x3x4 block 2)1x3x4 block on opposite side (like

        about with a start like this. Perhaps solving edges directly with 3 edge
        cycles might be faster. I can't tell whether or not it would be good for
        speedcubing simply because I take so long to do step 4 and 8 ( I only

        4x4x4 method :-) Hi James :-) For the 4x4x4 revenge/master cube i use
        the same system as i do for the 5x5x5 wahn/professor cube. The basic
        steps are as follows: (I call this the "Cage" method. ) 1. Do first
        layer completely. This is intuitive. If some centers are "tricky" to
        solve they can be left for later if so desired. basically i solve the
        cubies in the order i see them. Cubies that make up blocks are inserted
        into first layer as a block also, when possible. 2. (First twist the
        middle layers into favorable positions. U can get quite a few edges
        and/or centers for free by doing this.) Now do middle layers edges. This
        is done by and large with commutator 3- cycles. Also here one can cycle
        blocks of cubies when solving them. Either to solve several edges at the
        same time or remove badly placed edges (move to final layer where i do
        most of the "fishing") or move bad edges to a better position within the
        middle layers. 3. Final layer corners. First position them (only 2 algs
        needed) then orient them (there are 6 easy cases for this). 4. Now solve
        all last layer edges with 3-cycles. This is perhaps the most tricky
        step. I use easy commutator 3-cycles with very few setup moves. In fact
        the setup is never more than 1 single move. The most difficult thing
        about this is to recognize which 3-cycle to do next. I normally look for
        3-cycles that will solve 2 edges with same 3-cycle. So i do a quick
        "scan" tracking the edges and see if that is possible. If not i just
        settle for a 3-cycle solving 1 edge only. There is of coz the parity
        which means im left with only 2 edges to swap. This is fairly easy also.
        This is fixed with an inner slice turn and a edge 3- cycle on this
        layer. In most cases some setup moves are needed (at most 2 moves).
        Remember that it doesn't matter that my parity fix will mess w the
        centers. With some luck block 3-cycles can also be used efficiently. 5.
        Do all the remaining centers with yet more 3-cycles. Block cycles where
        possible. With practice u can achieve good cancellations btw 2 succesive
        3-cycles : (simple example) r'urUr'u'd'rU'r'dr - 4 moves are cancelled.
        There are also some other center-algs that works on oppsite faces. One
        example : (r2b2)*2 Benefits of this method are: - U solve the cubies
        into their home position all the time. There is no tricky parts where u
        just solve cubies relative to eachother like when pairing up edgesw
        Chris' method. - Doing lots of 3-cycle it's easy to foresee where all
        pieces are going so u get excellent lookahead and very good flow in ur
        solves most of the time. - Mistakes u do early are not so fatal. There
        is usually easy fix for simple mistakes. - U don't rely on a fast 3x3x3
        method to do the last stage for u. My method has no "3x3x3-stage" at
        all. - Only one parity, not two. One disadvantage is that i probably
        need about 25% more moves as compared w Chris' method. So u really have
        to be a grandmaster of commutator 3-cycles and utilise block cycling as
        much as u can. And u need to make sure u get a good flow. A typical
        solve for me goes like this : - (15 secs) First layer done - (30 secs)
        Middle layer edges done - (50-55 secs) Last layer done - (70-75 secs)
        All centers are done. Cube is SOLVED!! That's it for the 4x4x4 method.
        The 5x5x5 method has a few more special cases. A list of these: - Make
        sure while orienting the middle layers after solving first layer that
        the extreme middle layer is twisted such that the middle centers end up
        in correct location. So u are can actually only twist 2 of the 3 middle
        layers freely. Umm u can choose to willingly set up the 4-spot pattern.
        But i never do that. - For last layer edges i would do the middle edges
        first. This is actually a separate step since u can't mix middle edges
        and outer edges. Doing the middle ones first gives easier recognition
        for solving the outer edges. - There are more special algs for
        exchanging centers between opposite faces. Example : (r2 E2)*2 or (Ff)
        r'u'r U r'u r U' (Ff)' Writing down these details make it cound more
        complicated then it really is ;-) Cheers! -Per _____ Yahoo! Groups Links

        Hi James, I've got the same 1st, 2nd and 8th steps :-) The rest differs:
        a) Build two 1x3x4 L/R-blocks - 55 b) Finish L/R-sides (4 edge pieces) -
        75 c) Solve M (L+r) edges (8 pieces) - 95 d) Solve M centers (16 pieces)
        - 130 No parity problems, that's the good point of "centers-last". It
        averages 130 moves, but my technique is rather basic. For example, I
        don't use complicated sequences in c), only a simple one: U2rU2. In d)
        I'm sure you can optimize much more than I do. I'm not a big 4^3 fan and
        my best average is 84 secs. But I think such a technique is slower than
        the "standard" way (pairing up edges). Because there are many slice
        moves. Did you try: 6) corners, and then 5+7) solve edges and fix parity
        problems Are parity fixing sequences much shorter when you don't have to
        preserve some centers? GIlles. --- In

        care. Just write down your solution and either e-mail to me

        your method against mine :-D My record for solving that case is 2.63
        seconds, but I average about 4.00 seconds. Can you beat 4.00 seconds on
        average for that finish? If your method doesn't run into this type of
        case at any point, please ignore this post altogether. So you fast
        people out there, can you beat me for that case? If so, let me know! I
        would really like to find a fast alg for that case. Chris P.S. If you
        haven't guessed, my alg to solve that case is the inverse of the one

        success, but if you know cool, fast move groups to try please feel free!

        Did you try: 6) corners, and then 5+7) solve edges and fix parity
        problems Are parity fixing sequences much shorter when you don't have to
        preserve some centers? I just use the pure edge swap and the almost pure

        4x4x4 method :-) Hi James, I've got the same 1st, 2nd and 8th steps :-)
        The rest differs: a) Build two 1x3x4 L/R-blocks - 55 b) Finish L/R-sides
        (4 edge pieces) - 75 c) Solve M (L+r) edges (8 pieces) - 95 d) Solve M
        centers (16 pieces) - 130 No parity problems, that's the good point of
        "centers-last". It averages 130 moves, but my technique is rather basic.
        For example, I don't use complicated sequences in c), only a simple one:
        U2rU2. In d) I'm sure you can optimize much more than I do. I'm not a
        big 4^3 fan and my best average is 84 secs. But I think such a technique
        is slower than the "standard" way (pairing up edges). Because there are
        many slice moves. Did you try: 6) corners, and then 5+7) solve edges and
        fix parity problems Are parity fixing sequences much shorter when you
        don't have to preserve some centers? GIlles. --- In

        group] 4x4x4 method :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi James :-) &gt; &gt; For
        the 4x4x4 revenge/master cube i use the same system as i do for &gt; the
        5x5x5 wahn/professor cube. &gt; &gt; The basic steps are as follows:
        &gt; &gt; (I call this the "Cage" method. ) &gt; &gt; 1. Do first layer
        completely. This is intuitive. If some centers &gt; are "tricky" to
        solve they can be left for later if so desired. &gt; basically i solve
        the cubies in the order i see them. Cubies that make &gt; up blocks are
        inserted into first layer as a block also, when possible. &gt; &gt; 2.
        (First twist the middle layers into favorable positions. U can get &gt;
        quite a few edges and/or centers for free by doing this.) Now do &gt;
        middle layers edges. This is done by and large with commutator 3- &gt;
        cycles. Also here one can cycle blocks of cubies when solving them. &gt;
        Either to solve several edges at the same time or remove badly placed
        &gt; edges (move to final layer where i do most of the "fishing") or
        move &gt; bad edges to a better position within the middle layers. &gt;
        &gt; 3. Final layer corners. First position them (only 2 algs needed)
        then &gt; orient them (there are 6 easy cases for this). &gt; &gt; 4.
        Now solve all last layer edges with 3-cycles. This is perhaps the &gt;
        most tricky step. I use easy commutator 3-cycles with very few setup
        &gt; moves. In fact the setup is never more than 1 single move. The most
        &gt; difficult thing about this is to recognize which 3-cycle to do
        next. I &gt; normally look for 3-cycles that will solve 2 edges with
        same 3-cycle. &gt; So i do a quick "scan" tracking the edges and see if
        that is possible. &gt; If not i just settle for a 3-cycle solving 1 edge
        only. There is of &gt; coz the parity which means im left with only 2
        edges to swap. This is &gt; fairly easy also. This is fixed with an
        inner slice turn and a edge 3- &gt; cycle on this layer. In most cases
        some setup moves are needed (at &gt; most 2 moves). Remember that it
        doesn't matter that my parity fix will &gt; mess w the centers. With
        some luck block 3-cycles can also be used &gt; efficiently. &gt; &gt; 5.
        Do all the remaining centers with yet more 3-cycles. Block cycles &gt;
        where possible. With practice u can achieve good cancellations btw 2
        &gt; succesive 3-cycles : (simple example) r'urUr'u'd'rU'r'dr - 4 moves
        are &gt; cancelled. There are also some other center-algs that works on
        oppsite &gt; faces. One example : (r2b2)*2 &gt; &gt; Benefits of this
        method are: &gt; &gt; - U solve the cubies into their home position all
        the time. There is &gt; no tricky parts where u just solve cubies
        relative to eachother like &gt; when pairing up edgesw Chris' method.
        &gt; &gt; - Doing lots of 3-cycle it's easy to foresee where all pieces
        are &gt; going so u get excellent lookahead and very good flow in ur
        solves &gt; most of the time. &gt; &gt; - Mistakes u do early are not so
        fatal. There is usually easy fix for &gt; simple mistakes. &gt; &gt; - U
        don't rely on a fast 3x3x3 method to do the last stage for u. My &gt;
        method has no "3x3x3-stage" at all. &gt; &gt; - Only one parity, not
        two. &gt; &gt; One disadvantage is that i probably need about 25% more
        moves as &gt; compared w Chris' method. So u really have to be a
        grandmaster of &gt; commutator 3-cycles and utilise block cycling as
        much as u can. And u &gt; need to make sure u get a good flow. &gt; &gt;
        A typical solve for me goes like this : &gt; &gt; - (15 secs) First
        layer done &gt; - (30 secs) Middle layer edges done &gt; - (50-55 secs)
        Last layer done &gt; - (70-75 secs) All centers are done. Cube is
        SOLVED!! &gt; &gt; That's it for the 4x4x4 method. The 5x5x5 method has
        a few more &gt; special cases. A list of these: &gt; &gt; - Make sure
        while orienting the middle layers after solving first &gt; layer that
        the extreme middle layer is twisted such that the middle &gt; centers
        end up in correct location. So u are can actually only twist 2 &gt; of
        the 3 middle layers freely. Umm u can choose to willingly set up &gt;
        the 4-spot pattern. But i never do that. &gt; &gt; - For last layer
        edges i would do the middle edges first. This is &gt; actually a
        separate step since u can't mix middle edges and outer &gt; edges. Doing
        the middle ones first gives easier recognition for &gt; solving the
        outer edges. &gt; &gt; - There are more special algs for exchanging
        centers between opposite &gt; faces. Example : (r2 E2)*2 or (Ff) r'u'r U
        r'u r U' (Ff)' &gt; &gt; Writing down these details make it cound more
        complicated then it &gt; really is ;-) &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; -Per

        Hi, Chris. In return for your advice on my developing method, here's a
        little feedback for you. =D I played around with a few things, and then
        settled on my approach, which is the COLL alg, followed by the edge 3
        cycle. I do it like this: B' R'FR B R'F'R y2 M2U'M U2 MU' M2 But it
        might help to either look at it like this: x D'R'UR D R'U'l y2 M2U'M U2
        MU' M2 Performing it like that, after ten or so practice tries, I took
        an average and wound up at 3.91 seconds. Since I'm too lazy, that's how
        I do it. To make it a single alg, however, I'd eliminate the y2 turn by
        just doing the 3 cycle from the other side. The biggest factor slowing
        down this alg the way I do it is the rotation. If you eliminate this,
        I'm sure you could do much better. Try B' R'FR B R'F'R M2U'M' U2 M'U'
        M2. Happy learning too many algorithms for a new method in hopes of
        becoming only a few seconds faster! ;D -Mike Bennett --- In

        Yep. You're correct. I'm nuts. ; ) But in regards to (3), I'm not sure
        you're correct. Like you mentioned down there, permuting edges within a
        slice may be ever so slightly faster, but I don't think the PLL's are
        all that slow. I just tried an average of a slice 3 cycle against a
        normal 3 cycle, and the slice 3 cycle was only .2 seconds faster. Also,
        The PLL's are slightly easier to recognize, because you only have to pay
        attention to placement, not placement and orientation. In regards to the
        ELL case you mentioned, that's almost exactly how I perform the 3 cycle.
        Just change the first and last M'/M to M2. I agree with your position,
        as noted on your site, that algorithms involving M and U turns are very
        fast. All of the ELL's I use are of that variety for the same reason. My
        brain thinks in terms of slice moves well, and they just feel right. I
        also disagree with your position that mixing methods in real time is
        very difficult or detrimental. It just takes practice. Especially at the
        start of my solves, I try to be ambigous about methods. The more methods
        you are familiar and comfortable with, the more chances you have for
        lucky cases. If I see an easy start with your method, I use it. I also
        employ lots of blocks and every once in a great while an extended cross.
        My times have only benefited from this, as near as I can tell. As for
        last layer method ambiguity, it's also really not that hard. To
        distinguish between using the CLL and COLL case, you really only have to
        know whether or not you managed to solve all of the edges during the
        last F2L pair, which I try to keep track of anyhow. You don't
        necessarily need to know which specific edges or how many are flipped.
        You just need to know that some are or none are. My reaction times are
        already fairly low for the few cases I already know. I anticipate they
        will improve with practice. And happily, the cases aren't really as
        numerous as they appear. There are 24 CLL+reflections (which I learn
        simultaneously, so they really seem like a single case to me). It's the
        same number for COLL. There are only 19 or 20 distinct cases for ELL, 3
        of which are the PLL cases. That leaves 24+24+16=64 cases+whatever
        optional junk you feel like throwing in. It's not a beginner method, by
        any means, but it seems to me to be the logical next step from either
        COLL+PLL or CLL+ELL. Of course, I know of a certain 'simple' method that
        uses 24 corner cases+9 edge algs+26 special edge cases=59, so for the
        extra 6, I think I'll be in a similar boat. ;D -Mike Bennett -----

        AM Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: New LL strategy proposal If I
        understand correctly, what you propose is: (1) Take care of last-layer
        edges orientation while solving the last pair, only if it's very fast.
        (2) Solve last layer corners before edges, using sequences that do not
        flip edges only if they're already correctly oriented thanks to (1). (3)
        Solve last layer edges, using mostly PLL sequences. What I think about
        it: (1) I'm not a F2L/OLL solver, but it looks like a good idea. I think
        a lot of Fridrich users try to do this, at least to avoid OLL cases with
        4 misoriented edges. (2) Why not! The CLL and COLL sets have a lot in
        common. And you can ask Masayuki Akimoto, I think one of his goals last
        year was to find CLL sequences that solve edges orientation too. (3)
        That's where I disagree. Unfortunately, permuting oriented edges is not
        always faster than some other ELL cases. Take M'UMU2M'UM for example, or
        R'U'RUMU'R'Ur. They are VERY fast and frequent. (plus I feel a bit
        stupid when I have to 3-cycle edges of a side, it's much faster to
        3-cycle edges of an inner slice with U2M'U2 :-) ) In my opinion, the
        keys to faster solving are: 1) Learn a basic method perfectly. Train a
        lot, anticipate, practice fingers and mental dexterity, etc. 2)
        Multi-experts optimizations, or dynamic hybrid methods. Try to maximize
        lucky cases by choosing a technique or another. When the "method R3a-Z
        expert" in your head yells "Hey! This case is for me, I know that if you
        follow me, the chances for you to finish this cube fast are quite
        good!", listen to him. That's what you propose, and I totally agree with
        you. That's what I'm doing with the last 6 edges and 4 centers: Method 2
        if I don't want to think at all, methods 1+3 tricks when there's an
        obvious shortcut that can be detected fast, and sometimes ELL when the
        F2L are already solved. If at a given point of a solve you're given to
        choose between 2 possibilities, choose the one that is statistically the
        most powerful. But mixing different methods in real time is not easy.
        The criteria that will tell you to choose one way or another have to be
        very simple, because every step must be anticipated while
        executing/finishing the previous step. If you can't anticipate enough,
        you can't ready your fingers, and since we're trying to optimize for a
        few 1/10s it's often much easier to loose time. *IDEA* We could draw a
        graph of all methods and variations, that would tell you, step by step,
        what your choices are and how to decide. 3) Learn a lot of magical
        sequences. I don't believe in learning hundreds of cases to solve LL
        corners + permute edges. Since Lars or others introduced this idea, I've
        never understood why it makes people so excited (but it's fine if other
        people like this idea and have fun looking for all these sequences, I
        hope they'll prove me wrong -- Chris ;-) ). Gilles [Non-text portions of

        Hi Stefan, It's a pretty grey area, I guess we have to be limited by the

        ineligibility idea, but I am warming to it now. Best newcomer is a very
        good idea, perhaps I would include this very soon. And also it might be
        possible to extend my normal calculation to FMC, but gleaning the
        Mean/SD statistic would be much harder, perhaps it would be more
        feasible to use a different distribution or so. Thanks for your ideas

        Yes, almost right, but don't forget it also is dependent on the Standard
        Deviation. Two people who have the same average (say 30 seconds) but
        Person 1 has a long term (50 cubes or so) SD of 5 seconds, and Person 2
        has an SD of 10 seconds. (Just example numbers) If they both then posted
        a 25 second average in a competition, Person 1 would be ranked higher
        than person 2, because they would have beaten their average by 1 SD,
        whereas Person 2 only beats his by 1/2 SD. This means that the
        probability that Person 1 would score 25s in the competition is lower
        than the probability of Person 2 posting the same. Dan :) -

        &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a possible idea. &gt; &gt; Last night I chatted
        with Tyson about a method which ranks people &gt; based on how much they
        bettered their average average, according to &gt; Normal Probability
        theory. &gt; &gt; This would require everyone taking part to have a
        regular statistic &gt; on their previous (at least 30, maybe 50) cubes,
        with Mean and S.d. &gt; &gt; A normal probability calculation could then
        be performed on their &gt; competition average, and the person who has
        beaten their average &gt; average with the lowest probability of
        occurrence should take the &gt; prize, since they have bettered
        themselves the most, no matter what &gt; their times are. This would
        reward constantly improving competitors &gt; more, than just the fastest
        guy each week. &gt; &gt; This is the method I shall be using in the
        friendly handicap &gt; competition we will have on July 16th in the
        first puzzle meeting of &gt; speedcubers in the UK. &gt; &gt; Dan :) -

        Thanks for all of the great ideas. I like Dan's idea, but it would be
        very difficult to coordinate for the 70 - 80 different competitors. This
        is what I cam up with last night: Starting next Sunday. The winner of
        the contest will recieve a set of stickers for any six-color puzzle of
        his or her choice. In addition to that, a random drawing will be held
        for a set of 3x3x3 stickers. Winners will be ineligable for 4
        participations in the contest. For every consecutive participation
        non-winners will get an additional entry into the drawing for the next
        week. So the more that you participate, the better the chances that
        you'll win the drawing. Thanks to http://www.cubesmith.com for supplying
        the prizes! Jon http://www.geocities.com/nascarjon2001 --- In

        I saw all of the other solutions to the ZBLL case and I simply did this:
        y(U2 R U R' U2)(L U')(R U' R' U R U2)(L' R') The key to this sequence is
        in the y at the very beginning. The goal is to have as many triggers
        involving (R,U) and (L,U) as possible. I hope this helps. My slowest
        time for this was 4 seconds (which I got only twice) and my fastest was

        If you're going to go that route, you may as well change the beginning
        to d' U'. That saves you on a rotation, which is unproductive in terms
        of moves per second, since it's not really even a move. -Mike Bennett

        I saw all of the other solutions to the ZBLL case and I simply did this:
        y(U2 R U R' U2)(L U')(R U' R' U R U2)(L' R') The key to this sequence is
        in the y at the very beginning. The goal is to have as many triggers
        involving (R,U) and (L,U) as possible. I hope this helps. My slowest
        time for this was 4 seconds (which I got only twice) and my fastest was
        2. I'm guessing my average was about 2.6 - 2.9 seconds for this case.

        Hey everyone, Wow! Thanks so much for all the help! I really appreciate
        the time you guys took to do this. I went through and tested and worked
        on every alg, and finally came up with the two best options (for my
        hands of course). In fact, both of these algs are so fast that I am
        having a hard time deciding between the two. I think I may learn both of
        them, since they both end with effectively turning the LL a different
        direction. You all seriously turned my slowest case into one of my
        faster ones! Thanks so much!!! Here are my choices for the best two
        (again for my hands). The first one is slightly faster on average, but
        again #2 is so close I can't really ditch it for #1. 1) y L' F' U' L2 U
        L2 F U' L' U' L2 U L2 (posted by James Stuber) fastest exection: 2.26
        seconds (5.75 t/sec including the cube rotation) fastest average: 2.82
        seconds (4.61 t/sec) This includes the y rotation at the beginning,
        which actually makes the following L' F' much easier. I do the trigger
        as (y L' F') U' (L')2 U (L)2 (F) U' (L' U' (L)2) (U) (L')2 also ending
        with a U turn is fast because both hands end at a standard grip. 2) R' U
        R' U' R' U' F' R' U R U' F U2 R2 (posted by Stefan Pochmann) fastest
        execution: 2.30 seconds fastest average: 3.19 seconds (could be faster
        as I practiced #1 a bit more. I think this one can also go sub-3 on
        average.) I do the trigger as: [(R' U R') (U')] (R' U') (F') [(R' U) (R
        U')] (F U2) R2 Pros of #1: -the L2 U alternating moves are CRAZY fast,
        so the ending and the middle go by VERY quickly. - my common
        misalignment mistakes are easily corrected - grip never changes after y
        rotation Pros of #2: - Lots of RU moves - grip never changes - no
        rotation required Cons of #1: - The first trigger/rotation is hard to
        correct if I screw up - It requires a rotation from the angle I
        recognize the case at Cons of #2: - It has 3 non-productive hand
        movements (twisting my wrist around so that where I was grabbing the
        back of the face I now have to grab the front: the first move has none).
        - My common mistakes tend to be the move f' (F'S') instead of (F') which
        kills my time completely. So mistakes are not easily corrected.
        ---------------------- So far I like #1 just a tiiiiiiiny little bit
        better, but I think I'll end up keeping both. I'm so quoting help from
        the group on my ZBLL page for this case :-D Thanks so much to everyone,
        I spent a good bit of time figuring out finger tricks to each alg, so
        thanks to everyone who posted an alg. I really appreciate it. Thanks so
        much! Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, cmhardw

        Hey Batman, Heh, sorry, I let the camera just dangle from my neck when I
        filmed because nobody else was around to film. Yes, transform 5 on
        Jaap's page, except the way I hold it is slightly different than he
        suggests, I believe. I like the way I hold it because it feels very fast
        for me, but different people have different preferences on how to hold
        the puzzle for that transform. Side note--I made a new Magic video
        recently: http://www.cubewhiz.com/videos/burtonmagic129.avi (1.29
        seconds). Notice the pause in the solve? Should have been faster... :\ ~

        totally afford the flight and food and all that, but I would be hard
        pressed and probably have to borrow money from other people if I had to
        pay for hotel also. Are there any Dallas cubers, or other cubers nearby,
        that I could stay with just for the competition? I guess I would lfy in
        sometime Friday and leave on Sunday? Like I said I can eat my own food
        and all that, but I don't think I could swing hotel costs on top of my
        flight and food. Just wanted to ask, Chris

      <strong> 3246. Method for Handicap Competitions </strong>

      <div class="email-content">
        Hi Everyone, I would like some input on the following method for judging
        a handicap competition, especially whether it is actually feasible to
        use in a competition! 1. From each competitor, have a long term Mean and
        Standard Deviation Statistic. From my Statistics course a long tim ago,
        the number 30 seems to ring a bell in my head, ie you have to make 30+
        solves before the statistics becomes valid. 2. After the competition,
        calculate each competitors average. Then calculate a Normal Probability,
        with competition average as the "x" statistic, and using the long term
        Mean and SD. This will calculate the probability of the competitor
        achieving this competition average, if they were to make many thousands
        of averages. 3. The competitor who has achieved the lowest average
        probability would win, and competitors are ranked in order of ascending
        probabilities. So, all fine in theory? I have tried plugging some
        numbers into a spreadsheet, and the results are quite promising. But one
        observation I have made, is that in real life, results don't seem to
        "quite fit" the normal distribution. It is perfectly likely for someone
        who is quite consistent in practice, to have a wildly varying average in
        competition, and the probabilities end up being almost 0, or almost 1.
        Is there someway of "stretching" the margins of the normal probability,
        so it can cover a wider range of results? One way would be to multiply
        the competitors standard deviations by a factor, but is this
        mathematically valid? Any help is greatly needed :) Dan Harris -
        www.cubestation.co.uk :) P.S. I hated Statistics in college ;)

        No, thats not quite true. If your average was say 20 seconds (am I
        flattering or insulting you Stefan? ;) ) and you made a 60 second
        average in competition, then you would be at the high end of the scale,
        you probability would be 1, because the likelihood in the long term
        almost (if not all) your averages would be 60 seconds or under. So there
        is no way you would win like that. To win, you have to better your
        average by the most. Dan :) --- In

        Hey Chris, If you can't find somewhere to stay, you could stay at my
        hotel room and we could split the cost, if this would help. I'm getting

        Hey Chris, That's great! It'll be great to see you again. I'm very
        curious at how suddenly you acquired money to go to the tournament. If
        you've found out how to make money from solving cubes, you gotta let me
        know. As for all of you, if you feel you're 'noteworthy' or 'special' in
        any way, the museum is looking for ways to promote the tournament. Part
        of this includes making profiles of the competitors and talking about
        what they've done. For example, there could be a huge poster of Chris
        that lists all of his records and everything. You guys should let me
        know, because these things might look cool, and I'm sure they'd let you

        the way my site is &gt; &gt; now, or just links on the top or side of
        each page for navigation, &gt; &gt; that aren't a seperate frame. There
        are the pros and cons of both, so &gt; &gt; I just wanted to know what
        people thought. And anything else you'd &gt; &gt; like to say, tips,

        Where would you get the 30 solves? If you're using solves that span a
        large time frame, this is not a good idea because most people get faster
        the more they cube. It would probably be more fair to fit their solve
        times to an exponential decay curve up to a constant as a function of
        time, and then calculate their expected average and standard deviation
        for the day of the tournament from the fit. Leyan PS. From the
        statistics class I took, I remember the number 40 (Law of large

        Normal Probability, with competition average as the "x" &gt; statistic,

        probability of the competitor achieving this competition &gt; average,
        if they were to make many thousands of averages. &gt; &gt; 3. The
        competitor who has achieved the lowest average probability &gt; would
        win, and competitors are ranked in order of ascending &gt;

        Pool is one of those things I've always thought about practicing and
        getting really good at. Unlike the cube, the average person out there
        plays pool. I don't have to get good, I just have to get slightly better
        than the average, and just get to a point where I really understand the
        game, and know what I'm doing, and then I can... go to bars and hustle
        people, get them drunk, and walk away with their girlfriends. Yeah, that
        was besides the point. Anyway, glad to hear you're coming to Dallas.
        Dallas isn't my city, so I don't know where the places to shoot pool
        are. You should have come to New York. Macky's mom was owning EVERYONE!

        Hi Leyan, Tyson, The 30 - 40 solves would have to be fairly near the
        time of the competition, yes. As you say, if you were using an out of
        date statistic, it wouldn't work, because people's long term averages
        would slowly increase as they improved. This, in my opinion, is the main
        stumbling block of this method, how would you get all the competitors to
        bother to time 30 or 40 solves, before the day of the tournament?
        Perhaps everyone should time as many cubes as they possibly can, in a
        practice session before the competition or so. Well, I guess we will
        just have to see what happens on July 16th! Dan :) --- In

        &gt; &gt; I would like some input on the following method for judging a
        &gt; &gt; handicap competition, especially whether it is actually
        feasible to &gt; &gt; use in a competition! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. From
        each competitor, have a long term Mean and Standard &gt; &gt; Deviation
        Statistic. From my Statistics course a long tim ago, the &gt; &gt;
        number 30 seems to ring a bell in my head, ie you have to make 30+ &gt;
        &gt; solves before the statistics becomes valid. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.
        After the competition, calculate each competitors average. Then &gt;
        &gt; calculate a Normal Probability, with competition average as the "x"
        &gt; &gt; statistic, and using the long term Mean and SD. This will
        calculate &gt; &gt; the probability of the competitor achieving this
        competition &gt; &gt; average, if they were to make many thousands of
        averages. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. The competitor who has achieved the
        lowest average probability &gt; &gt; would win, and competitors are
        ranked in order of ascending &gt; &gt; probabilities. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; So, all fine in theory? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have tried plugging
        some numbers into a spreadsheet, and the &gt; &gt; results are quite
        promising. But one observation I have made, is &gt; &gt; that in real
        life, results don't seem to "quite fit" the normal &gt; &gt;
        distribution. It is perfectly likely for someone who is quite &gt; &gt;
        consistent in practice, to have a wildly varying average in &gt; &gt;
        competition, and the probabilities end up being almost 0, or almost &gt;
        &gt; 1. Is there someway of "stretching" the margins of the normal &gt;
        &gt; probability, so it can cover a wider range of results? One way
        would &gt; &gt; be to multiply the competitors standard deviations by a
        factor, but &gt; &gt; is this mathematically valid? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Any help is greatly needed :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dan Harris -

        Hey all you magic solvers, I'm totally and completely new to all this. I
        learned how to solve the magic just recently, and it turns out that I
        started timing myself before I knew the solution very well and on one of
        my solves my hand sort of spasmed or something and the magic went into a
        weird shape. I was able to get it back to the reguloar one and realign
        all the tiles, but now one of my strings is loose. I only notice it
        after I have solved, then undo the solve back to the start. The loose
        string, if I am looking at the unlinked side exactly as it should look
        before I start the solution, is on the top row 2nd tile from the right.
        There are 4 diagonal rows of strings that go from the top left to the
        bottom right, and it is the 2nd one from the bottom, there is a metal
        connector thingy (go easy, I'm new to this :-) Near where this tile
        touches the 3rd tile from the right is where the string gets loose. If
        after every solve and undo I pop that string back in things seem to go
        fine still, but that gets old after oh... 2 solves. :-D Is there a way
        to fix this string without restringing completely? (I have no idea how
        to do that). If that's necessary though, is there a tutorial vid or site
        with pics that I can learn how to do that? Thanks for the help, and
        please go easy on me if this explanation is more than what is needed, or
        if I goofed on something. I'm a noob magic solver :-D Chris

        What exactly do you mean with "it's loose"? Is it like the string is too
        long? Or does it just slip out of the groove slightly? I have the latter
        problem with one of mine, but it's not annoying enough to make me take
        it all apart. Maybe one day it will break and I'm gonna replace it then.
        I have this Darwin-like theory, survival of the fittest, so if a string
        breaks it's actually good because this way you identify and remove the
        weak links. Stefan --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        No Dan but there is a way to beat this. If you are considering only the
        best improvement done by a person then I'll do my worst times in the
        first 30 solves and then in the real solves i'll solve normally. So my
        scores come out far better than the 30 previous ones. Though this looks
        like a good idea. Keep working on this. Sachin --- Dan

        people's long term averages &gt; would slowly increase as they improved.
        &gt; &gt; This, in my opinion, is the main stumbling block of this
        method, how &gt; would you get all the competitors to bother to time 30
        or 40 solves, &gt; before the day of the tournament? Perhaps everyone
        should time as &gt; many cubes as they possibly can, in a practice
        session before the &gt; competition or so. &gt; &gt; Well, I guess we
        will just have to see what happens on July 16th! &gt; &gt; Dan :) &gt;

        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 2. After the competition, calculate each
        competitors average. &gt; Then &gt;&gt;&gt; calculate a Normal
        Probability, with competition average as &gt; the "x" &gt;&gt;&gt;
        statistic, and using the long term Mean and SD. This will &gt; calculate
        &gt;&gt;&gt; the probability of the competitor achieving this

        averages. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 3. The competitor who has achieved
        the lowest average &gt; probability &gt;&gt;&gt; would win, and
        competitors are ranked in order of ascending &gt;&gt;&gt; probabilities.
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So, all fine in theory? &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; I have tried plugging some numbers into a spreadsheet, and
        the &gt;&gt;&gt; results are quite promising. But one observation I have
        made, is &gt;&gt;&gt; that in real life, results don't seem to "quite
        fit" the normal &gt;&gt;&gt; distribution. It is perfectly likely for
        someone who is quite &gt;&gt;&gt; consistent in practice, to have a
        wildly varying average in &gt;&gt;&gt; competition, and the
        probabilities end up being almost 0, or &gt; almost &gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Is
        there someway of "stretching" the margins of the normal &gt;&gt;&gt;
        probability, so it can cover a wider range of results? One way &gt;
        would &gt;&gt;&gt; be to multiply the competitors standard deviations by

        Yeah but that's the problem with anything involving people. What's to
        stop me from posting an average of 15.00 on UWR list, even thought I've
        never been under 16? And it's not that unbelievable really. But it might
        be a bit odd, statistically, I might post a fake average where all the
        hundredths of a second were under .50 for example, which is
        statistically very unlikely. It's also unlikely, given enough cubes,
        that you would beat your long term average by more than 3 SD's. But

        So, for "Team Cubing," I was under the impression that the cube didn't
        have to be on the table, and that one person could hold the cube, and
        the other person could make moves while it was still in the other
        person's hand. The rules, in my mind, were such that one person would
        make a move (I think HTM was the standard) and then the other person
        would make a move, but there was no limitation on how you held the cube.
        Ian Winokur and I tried this and it was pretty ridiculous, we didn't use
        the same algorithms at all. (R U R' U R U2 R') versus something else...
        which can't remember. I think it might be time for a team Caltech :-P

        Is there some prize that's really worth it? That's why we can't do
        handicap competitions as an official event because there's no sure way
        to ensure honesty. For non-official events, and all that other sort,
        such as Sunday contests, or speedcubing.com averages, so far, we've been
        relying on the honesty of the cubers, and it's been working in my
        opinion. There really aren't that many doubtful records, and if someone
        lies, I personally don't care, because your sub-14 average on
        speedcubing.com means nothing to me if I beat you in a tournament. If
        you end up posting a fake average, then you waste the rest of your life
        trying to protect this lie, and trying to prevent people from finding
        out the truth. You're reduced to nothing more than a person who makes up
        excuses on why his times are so slow. It's just not worth it :-P Tyson

        the competition, calculate each &gt;&gt; competitors average. &gt;&gt;
        Then &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; calculate a Normal Probability, with competition
        &gt;&gt; average as &gt;&gt; the "x" &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; statistic, and
        using the long term Mean and SD. &gt;&gt; This will &gt;&gt; calculate
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the probability of the competitor achieving this
        &gt;&gt; competition &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; average, if they were to make many
        thousands of &gt;&gt; averages. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. The
        competitor who has achieved the lowest &gt;&gt; average &gt;&gt;
        probability &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would win, and competitors are ranked in
        order of &gt;&gt; ascending &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probabilities.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, all fine in theory?
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have tried plugging some numbers
        into a &gt;&gt; spreadsheet, and the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results are quite
        promising. But one observation I &gt;&gt; have made, is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        that in real life, results don't seem to "quite &gt;&gt; fit" the normal
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; distribution. It is perfectly likely for someone
        &gt;&gt; who is quite &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent in practice, to have a
        wildly varying &gt;&gt; average in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; competition, and the
        probabilities end up being &gt;&gt; almost 0, or &gt;&gt; almost
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Is there someway of "stretching" the margins of
        &gt;&gt; the normal &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probability, so it can cover a
        wider range of &gt;&gt; results? One way &gt;&gt; would &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        be to multiply the competitors standard deviations &gt;&gt; by a factor,
        &gt;&gt; but &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is this mathematically valid?
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any help is greatly needed :)

        No, of course not. Maybe you're missing the point. There's no need for a
        handicap in speedcubing tournaments, because there are a lot of sub 20
        cubers, and those cubers who aren't sub20 will have lots to aspire to,
        and to be honest, if they want to win, they'll have to improve. But for
        a small competition, where there maybe be on or two sub 20ers, a 30, 40,
        and a minuter, for example, and the averages are spread wide, then it
        makes it a lot more fun for everyone involved, rather than just going
        through the motions to make the eventual, predictable winner. Dan :) ---

        Tyson, &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The 30 - 40 solves would have to be
        fairly near the &gt; &gt;&gt; time of the &gt; &gt;&gt; competition,
        yes. As you say, if you were using an out &gt; &gt;&gt; of date &gt;
        &gt;&gt; statistic, it wouldn't work, because people's long &gt;
        &gt;&gt; term averages &gt; &gt;&gt; would slowly increase as they
        improved. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; This, in my opinion, is the main
        stumbling block of &gt; &gt;&gt; this method, how &gt; &gt;&gt; would
        you get all the competitors to bother to time 30 &gt; &gt;&gt; or 40
        solves, &gt; &gt;&gt; before the day of the tournament? Perhaps everyone
        &gt; &gt;&gt; should time as &gt; &gt;&gt; many cubes as they possibly
        can, in a practice session &gt; &gt;&gt; before the &gt; &gt;&gt;
        competition or so. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Well, I guess we will
        just have to see what happens on &gt; &gt;&gt; July 16th! &gt; &gt;&gt;

        to &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use in a competition! &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. From each competitor, have a long term Mean and
        &gt; &gt;&gt; Standard &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Deviation Statistic. From
        my Statistics course a &gt; &gt;&gt; long tim ago, &gt; &gt;&gt; the
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; number 30 seems to ring a bell in my head, ie you
        &gt; &gt;&gt; have to make &gt; &gt;&gt; 30+ &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        solves before the statistics becomes valid. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;

        No, you should really have it resting on the table, or pass it from

        You know, I've tried that, and tried shoving the cube in the other
        person's face with the correct face in front of them, but then never
        turn it the right way, and some higher being's way of punishing me, is

        I'm totally and completely new to all this. I learned how to solve &gt;
        the magic just recently, and it turns out that I started timing myself
        &gt; before I knew the solution very well and on one of my solves my
        hand &gt; sort of spasmed or something and the magic went into a weird
        shape. &gt; &gt; I was able to get it back to the reguloar one and
        realign all the &gt; tiles, but now one of my strings is loose. I only
        notice it after I &gt; have solved, then undo the solve back to the
        start. Loose? If it just comes out of the groove and you have to put it
        back in from time to time, that's normal (I suppose). On my Magic, VERY
        often I have to re-align strings if I went full speed because something
        usually pops out of place (even more common on my Master Magic). If the
        string seems to long, I would recommend cutting it with a razor and
        replacing it (you can replace any string without removing any additional
        strings ;)) ...you do have extra strings don't you? :-P I found that the
        silliest thing somebody can do if they want to get fast at the Magic is
        to buy only one Magic because the strings break so easily (I discovered
        this when I got my first broken string on Day 2 or 3). I would
        definitely recommend a Harry Potter or Simpson magic for spare parts
        (I've actually used more than two full Magics full of strings to replace
        broken ones by now). &gt; The loose string, if I am looking at the
        unlinked side exactly as it &gt; should look before I start the
        solution, is on the top row 2nd tile &gt; from the right. &gt; &gt;
        There are 4 diagonal rows of strings that go from the top left to the
        &gt; bottom right, and it is the 2nd one from the bottom, there is a
        metal &gt; connector thingy (go easy, I'm new to this :-) Near where
        this tile &gt; touches the 3rd tile from the right is where the string
        gets loose. &gt; &gt; If after every solve and undo I pop that string
        back in things seem to &gt; go fine still, but that gets old after oh...
        2 solves. :-D At least it's not like a cube and doesn't have to be
        scrambled after EVERY solve ;) &gt; Is there a way to fix this string
        without restringing completely? (I &gt; have no idea how to do that). If
        that's necessary though, is there a &gt; tutorial vid or site with pics
        that I can learn how to do that? Jaap's page has directions on how to
        replace a string or even string a Magic from scratch (which I found to
        be a total hassle and I don't plan on ever doing again ever in my
        life--I'd rather buy a new Magic than ever ever go through that again!)
        I actually plan on making a quick video showing how to replace a string
        (it takes about 15-30 seconds for me now) :) &gt; Thanks for the help,
        and please go easy on me if this explanation is &gt; more than what is
        needed, or if I goofed on something. I'm a noob &gt; magic solver :-D I
        hope this helps. ~ Bob

        Hi! I'm learning OLL right now and got 16 more to learn. Probably I will
        know them all within a month. It would be interesting to know what you
        guys averaged with 2-step OLL or 1,5-step OLL. My average record is
        18,84. I hope to do below 18 this summer.

        Thanks, 1MB is much better :-) And I think quality is good enough. But
        is it just me (and my movie player) or is there no sound? I'd like to

        There was also an American online shop discussed recently but they
        seemed to have delivery problems. Or maybe here:
        http://hlavolamy.gumruch.cz/europe.php &gt; Stackmat timer
        (www.speedstacks.com only has the generation 2 timers). Maybe ask them
        whether they still have an old one. You can also ask at their other
        sites around the world. Btw, I just found this:

        I've been playing around with my 4x4 method the last couple of hours. I
        realized I'd better start practicing, seeing as 2005 is now more than
        half over. November soon approaches. After hearing about Per's method, I
        decided to give it a shot. Here are some things I've noticed. 1) I can
        finish the 1x3x4 blocks on both sides. If you start with two opposing
        centers, then add the L/D and R/D edge pairs, followed by the corner
        edge pairs, it's simple and quick. 2) I think it's easier to finish the
        second center group if the centers are done first. 3) This is fairly
        simple and intuitive. 4) I've found a simple commutator that does the
        job, but I suspect there are a couple of tricks that could come in
        useful. For instance, often, I am only left with two pairs to finish.
        This is easily solvable by the commutator I found, but three cycles are
        not. 5) Which parity do you mean? The whole point to 'edges first'
        solutions is to avoid the nasty parity problem, isn't it? In my
        practice, I only ran into the easy parity problem once, and never
        obtained the difficult case. 6) Yep. Hooray for C(O)LL! 7) I pretty much
        resort to Gille's method to orient and place edges. Easy step. 8) This
        part I'm having problems with. The only algorithm I have found for this
        step switches a pair of opposing center pieces. That makes solving the
        final step somewhat difficult, as you might imagine. If anyone out there
        has any better suggestions, please let me know. -Mike Bennett --- In

        speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com &gt; Subject: [Speed cubing
        group] 4x4x4 method :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi James :-) &gt; &gt; For
        the 4x4x4 revenge/master cube i use the same system as i do for &gt; the
        5x5x5 wahn/professor cube. &gt; &gt; The basic steps are as follows:
        &gt; &gt; (I call this the "Cage" method. ) &gt; &gt; 1. Do first layer
        completely. This is intuitive. If some centers &gt; are "tricky" to
        solve they can be left for later if so desired. &gt; basically i solve
        the cubies in the order i see them. Cubies that make &gt; up blocks are
        inserted into first layer as a block also, when possible. &gt; &gt; 2.
        (First twist the middle layers into favorable positions. U can get &gt;
        quite a few edges and/or centers for free by doing this.) Now do &gt;
        middle layers edges. This is done by and large with commutator 3- &gt;
        cycles. Also here one can cycle blocks of cubies when solving them. &gt;
        Either to solve several edges at the same time or remove badly placed
        &gt; edges (move to final layer where i do most of the "fishing") or
        move &gt; bad edges to a better position within the middle layers. &gt;
        &gt; 3. Final layer corners. First position them (only 2 algs needed)
        then &gt; orient them (there are 6 easy cases for this). &gt; &gt; 4.
        Now solve all last layer edges with 3-cycles. This is perhaps the &gt;
        most tricky step. I use easy commutator 3-cycles with very few setup
        &gt; moves. In fact the setup is never more than 1 single move. The most
        &gt; difficult thing about this is to recognize which 3-cycle to do
        next. I &gt; normally look for 3-cycles that will solve 2 edges with
        same 3-cycle. &gt; So i do a quick "scan" tracking the edges and see if
        that is possible. &gt; If not i just settle for a 3-cycle solving 1 edge
        only. There is of &gt; coz the parity which means im left with only 2
        edges to swap. This is &gt; fairly easy also. This is fixed with an
        inner slice turn and a edge 3- &gt; cycle on this layer. In most cases
        some setup moves are needed (at &gt; most 2 moves). Remember that it
        doesn't matter that my parity fix will &gt; mess w the centers. With
        some luck block 3-cycles can also be used &gt; efficiently. &gt; &gt; 5.
        Do all the remaining centers with yet more 3-cycles. Block cycles &gt;
        where possible. With practice u can achieve good cancellations btw 2
        &gt; succesive 3-cycles : (simple example) r'urUr'u'd'rU'r'dr - 4 moves
        are &gt; cancelled. There are also some other center-algs that works on
        oppsite &gt; faces. One example : (r2b2)*2 &gt; &gt; Benefits of this
        method are: &gt; &gt; - U solve the cubies into their home position all
        the time. There is &gt; no tricky parts where u just solve cubies
        relative to eachother like &gt; when pairing up edgesw Chris' method.
        &gt; &gt; - Doing lots of 3-cycle it's easy to foresee where all pieces
        are &gt; going so u get excellent lookahead and very good flow in ur
        solves &gt; most of the time. &gt; &gt; - Mistakes u do early are not so
        fatal. There is usually easy fix for &gt; simple mistakes. &gt; &gt; - U
        don't rely on a fast 3x3x3 method to do the last stage for u. My &gt;
        method has no "3x3x3-stage" at all. &gt; &gt; - Only one parity, not
        two. &gt; &gt; One disadvantage is that i probably need about 25% more
        moves as &gt; compared w Chris' method. So u really have to be a
        grandmaster of &gt; commutator 3-cycles and utilise block cycling as
        much as u can. And u &gt; need to make sure u get a good flow. &gt; &gt;
        A typical solve for me goes like this : &gt; &gt; - (15 secs) First
        layer done &gt; - (30 secs) Middle layer edges done &gt; - (50-55 secs)
        Last layer done &gt; - (70-75 secs) All centers are done. Cube is
        SOLVED!! &gt; &gt; That's it for the 4x4x4 method. The 5x5x5 method has
        a few more &gt; special cases. A list of these: &gt; &gt; - Make sure
        while orienting the middle layers after solving first &gt; layer that
        the extreme middle layer is twisted such that the middle &gt; centers
        end up in correct location. So u are can actually only twist 2 &gt; of
        the 3 middle layers freely. Umm u can choose to willingly set up &gt;
        the 4-spot pattern. But i never do that. &gt; &gt; - For last layer
        edges i would do the middle edges first. This is &gt; actually a
        separate step since u can't mix middle edges and outer &gt; edges. Doing
        the middle ones first gives easier recognition for &gt; solving the
        outer edges. &gt; &gt; - There are more special algs for exchanging
        centers between opposite &gt; faces. Example : (r2 E2)*2 or (Ff) r'u'r U
        r'u r U' (Ff)' &gt; &gt; Writing down these details make it cound more
        complicated then it &gt; really is ;-) &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; -Per

        Hi, I have just uploaded some of my notes(speedcubing/regular cubing)
        onto: http://www.umich.edu/~tanqf/cube/index.html The page is 75%
        complete. I look forward to comments. Thanks for your time! -Tan p.s.
        Just sth about my cubing experience:- I started speedcubing beginning of
        last year. I was using 4-look LL for about a month b4 switching to
        Fridrich. It took me around 1 month to learn Fridrich and after that my
        times dropped dramatically. 5 months after time zero I was averaging
        around 20 seconds. Then i stopped taking averages, and only solved for
        fun. The cube i use has a weird color scheme: white-yellow, pink-purple,
        green blue. Moreover, it doesn't have springs in its axle. Probably i
        can get significantly faster if i switch to cubes with springs.

        I was wondering if somebody could make me a little program to make the
        random drawing for the Sunday Contest easier on me. What I need is a
        program that I can list a bunch of names and randomly draw one. But here
        is the catch; Some names will have more than one entry in the drawing
        and I need to be able to assign the number of entries to each name.
        There may be a free set of stickers for whoever makes me the nicest
        program, before next Sunday ;) Thanks, Jon

        Hi friendz, Yesterday we had a nice cube meeting at Jaap Scherphuis's
        place. There were 11 cubers: Lars V, Ton D, Peter J, Ruben G, Joël v N,
        Hans vd Z, Jaap S, Koen H, Michael F, Stefan B and me. Before dinner we
        had a little handicap competition and Joël beat us all by far. Averaging
        under 15. I haven't practiced 3x3x3 very much recently (focused on
        4x4x4), but Joël in this shape is gonna be a tough guy to beat! We also
        set two new fun records. But I am not sure whether they are records. Any
        group having done better maybe? First record: Joël and I were competing
        eachother on Stackmat, scrambling eachother's cubes. There was only one
        cube for which we both had the same time. And that time was 12.88
        seconds! Second record: Later Joël, Lars, Ton and I were competing
        eachother on Stackmat. For one cube the worst time of all 4 was 18.05
        seconds (set by me). Great to have so many cubers living so close! Have
        fun, Ron

        Nope. I came up with it on my own after Per mentioned doing edges first
        to avoid parity problems. I'm interested in learning where this page you
        mention is. I suspect I could be much faster with a method like this
        than a centers first method, because of the recognition time. -Mike

        One problem I found with this method is too many slice moves. I Can't do
        fast slice moves for my life, but if you can do 'em it could be fast.
        Which commuter do you use for two edges left? For centers, r2b2r2b2,
        ldl' U ld'l' U', and r'urUr'u'd'rU'r'dr are nice. --- In

        Hey Ron, Yes, I also enjoyed meeting all the Dutch cubers again.. It
        always gives me some more motivation. About the records, I think our
        'duo-solve' record is pretty hard to beat, but the one with 4 cubers
        racing each other should be easy. I remember racing DanH, Lars and
        Michel at the German Open. I am pretty sure we broke 18 seconds at least
        once :). Cya! ;) Joël. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        month &gt; to learn Fridrich and after that my times dropped
        dramatically. 5 &gt; months after time zero I was averaging around 20
        seconds. Then i &gt; stopped taking averages, and only solved for fun.
        The cube i use has a &gt; weird color scheme: white-yellow, pink-purple,
        green blue. Moreover, &gt; it doesn't have springs in its axle. Probably
        i can get significantly &gt; faster if i switch to cubes with springs.

        Hi Evan. Adding forum to your site is very easy. There is an open source
        php scripts called phpBB which do all the work for you. It uses MySql
        for storing the messages and has a lot of advanced features. Plus its
        free. And if you want to learn php itself then the best place would be
        www.php.net itself. Check the online documentation its totally
        exhaustive. And still if u face any problems feel free to ask me :)

        Hi! I have actually heard about ppl using olive oil as lubricant. And
        it's supposedly quite alrite. My guess is that probably u would use an
        almost microscopic amount to make sure u don't get oil on ur hands while
        u cube. Also i don't know if they used the expensive extra virgin or
        plain cooking variety of the oil :-P Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        Cooking oil will damage the plastic of the cube. I believe that this is
        true of all oil based products. You should avoid Vaseline for the same
        reason. Most people prefer a silicone based lubricant (either a spray or
        a gel). And you are putting this in the cube, not eating it or inhaling
        it, so it should be pretty safe. Short term contact with the skin while
        you are working with it is also harmless. On 7/5/05, mahtianssi

        Hey everyone, is there a standard practice used to denote your grip when
        doing a trigger? If not can we try to think one up? I'd like to be able
        to denote when I grab a standard grip, when you allow for say U and R
        turns, or U and L turns. Grips tend to hold the 2x2x3 that runs from F
        to B along the DL edge or DR edge, but often you can do others too. For
        example the Z perm holds the grip on just the FL and BL edges allowing R
        U D turns freely. Is there a way to denote this simply? My idea would be
        to have an alg and denote the grip before the triggers. such as ([grip
        notation here] R U R' U' R U R' U') all within the parenthesis. and if
        you change grips you could include that with cube rotations too: (R U R'
        U') x' y2 [new grip notation] (some other trigger here) What does
        everyone think? I'd like to use this idea to describe notation on my
        site, but if one doesn't exist and there isn't much interest I'll just
        make one up myself. However I would greatly prefer this to be a
        community effort with lots of input all around. Chris

        whole lot of time having to typ in all of the names everytime. I would
        be much better if it could accept a list from a text file, or better yet
        pull them right out of my sunday contest statistics spreadsheet

        Hey Chris, &gt; is there a standard practice used to denote your grip
        when doing a &gt; trigger? If not can we try to think one up? I don't
        think one exists...if one does, I've never heard of it. &gt; I'd like to
        be able to denote when I grab a standard grip, when you &gt; allow for
        say U and R turns, or U and L turns. &gt; &gt; Grips tend to hold the
        2x2x3 that runs from F to B along the DL edge &gt; or DR edge, but often
        you can do others too. And that's not a very uncommon thing to happen.
        &gt; For example the Z perm holds the grip on just the FL and BL edges
        &gt; allowing R U D turns freely. &gt; &gt; Is there a way to denote
        this simply? I think the best way to denote it (to be space efficient
        and not clutter algorithms up too much) would be to have some sort of
        symbolism for each group. For example, if you are holding the 2x2x3
        block you described, that would be for example, "A". It should be
        something short and simple, but the tricky part would be to come up with
        something that is also related to the grip so that these symbols don't
        have to be learned by brute memorization. &gt; My idea would be to have
        an alg and denote the grip before the triggers. &gt; &gt; such as ([grip
        notation here] R U R' U' R U R' U') all within the &gt; parenthesis.
        &gt; &gt; and if you change grips you could include that with cube
        rotations too: &gt; (R U R' U') x' y2 [new grip notation] (some other
        trigger here) That would be a good way to do it. &gt; What does everyone
        think? I'd like to use this idea to describe &gt; notation on my site,
        but if one doesn't exist and there isn't much &gt; interest I'll just
        make one up myself. However I would greatly prefer &gt; this to be a
        community effort with lots of input all around. I think it would
        certainly make learning algorithms a bit easier because it's much easier
        to remember them with your hands than your brain (in my opinion,
        anyway). I use slow-motion videos to show grips and triggers instead
        since no such notation exists. ~ Bob

        How about giving each finger a number, or something along those lines,
        then refer to the sticker that the specific finger is touching, somehow.
        Say your fingers are numbered 1 - 5 on the left and right hands, thumb
        being one. So your left thumb could be L1 or 1L and your right pinky
        would be R5, etc. Then naming the stickers. Perhaps you could use the
        conventional UFR, DBL, FR, etc. where the first letter, indicates the
        sticker you are touching. So UFR is the sticker on top of the UFR
        corner, but FRU is the sticker on the front of the up front right
        corner. Then combine the two, to tell where a finger goes. so L1F would
        be the left thumb on the front center, etc. So a fairly standard grip
        for a right handed cuber would be: (L1F L2BL L3B L4BD R1FR R2BUR R3BR
        R4BDR) Not as brief as what Bob mentioned, but less memorizing, and its
        simple to figure it out, without going to a lookup table. The formatting
        can of course be different, whether its separated by commas, or
        something else between finger, between hands, maybe a new line between
        hands. Just a rough idea up for criticism. -Evan Until next time, Happy

        Hey Chris, Never heard of grip notations, but I think the grip is
        something most cubers do automatically, depending on the algorithm. When
        I scramble, I can usually ajust my grip depending on the next three
        moves. And in your example, if I have an alg with R, U and D moves, if
        won't grab the cube at the D layer.. So I don't really think an extra
        notation for grips is necessary. Cya! Joël. --- In

        If you're going that route, you might as well try this for brevity's
        sake. Instead of (L1F L2BL... Just make standard spots for each finger.
        The first sticker note would always be L1, etc. A standard grip would
        look more like (FL * BL BLD BLD FR * BR BRD BRD) where * is a finger not
        touching the cube. For the most common grips, I suggest a symbol or
        implication. G1 or whatever you choose could be standard, and more
        complicated grips could be noted. Or, you could leave it blank and make
        it assumed to be a standard grip. -Mike Bennett ----- Original Message

        Hi Chris Good idea! For algs which use F R and B I use my leftt thumb on
        the Up Center and my middle finger on the Down Center. So using L for
        left and R for right and as an alternative to using numbers which Evan
        suggested, you could use letters for the names T for thumb, I for index,
        M for middle R for Ring and L for little (or P for pinky. But maybe it
        would be simpler to number the common grips: #1 LTF-LMB for Left Thumb
        Front (center) and Left Middle Back center. #2 LTU-LMD for Left Thumb Up
        (center) and Left Middle Down center. #3 LTL-LMR for Left Thumb Left
        (center) and Left Middle Right center. #4 RTF-RMB for Right Thumb Front
        (center) and Right Middle Back center. #5 RTU-RMD for Right Thumb Up
        (center) and Right Middle Down center. #6 RTL-RMR for Right Thumb Left
        (center) and Right Middle Right center. ([#2] R2 B2 R F2 R' B2R F2R )
        ([#1] R U R' U R U2 R' U2) for sune Slight variations may be understood
        to be implied, like favoring the side that's turning: Her I'm actually
        holding the edges under the Thumb and Middle fingers not the centers,
        because I turn a side and that turning becomes a grip. ([#2,6] F' L'

        That is another good point. After one gets accustomed to learning
        algorithms, the grips become pretty natural when learning a new
        algorithm. Also, some people have different grip preferences for the
        same algorithms. (I'm playing both sides on this one ;-)) ~ Bob --- In

        algorithm from the opposite side of the cube. I use this to pair up the
        last 3 sets of edges. It usually only takes two, because I've you can
        often match up two pairs of edges at the same time, but two executions
        can solve 3 edge pairs. Also, I ran into the hard parity problem last
        night and had no recourse but to resort to the very difficult algorithm
        I used previously. That single algorithm takes me something along the
        lines of 25 seconds when executed well. I'm very bad at executing it
        well. I'm also very bad at remembering it. I know there must be a better
        way to fix it for this method, but I have yet to find it. Any
        suggestions? -Mike Bennett ----- Original Message ----- From:

        One problem I found with this method is too many slice moves. I Can't do
        fast slice moves for my life, but if you can do 'em it could be fast.
        Which commuter do you use for two edges left? For centers, r2b2r2b2,
        ldl' U ld'l' U', and r'urUr'u'd'rU'r'dr are nice. --- In

        For everybody who has been cubing a while, grips become natural. Unless
        there is some extremely strange grip, there is no need for a grip
        notation. And if there is, use a picture. For those who have just picked
        up cubing, learning a whole new notation would be annoying and (I think)
        counterproductive. Videos and pictures are a much better tool for
        conveying this type of information. Even in text, finger tricks lose
        their "punch" on the newbies because they're not used to what they feel
        or look like. This is a visual game, don't fight it. TBTTyler Fox --- In

        we try to think one up? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to be

        &gt; Grips tend to hold the 2x2x3 that runs from F to B along the DL

        too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example the Z perm holds the grip

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My idea would be to have an alg and denote the

        and later I used silicon based spray. Now I haven't lubed my cube in
        about 5 months, and I have no trouble with it, it is still pretty
        smooth, so it's quite amazing. But don't use the stuff they put in

        Hi Chris, I think this is an interesting idea, though maybe not very
        practical. Videos show grip better, but then they are always too large
        to download. Now if someone could just program a MacroMedia flash
        animation or Java animation of the cube and the hands included.....
        Right... That's a bit ambitious. Anyway, if anyone does put any special
        'home-grown' notation on their site, I want to remind them that it
        breaks the very handy usage of applets and other programs, especially my
        Rubik's favelet, that works from right off the page. For this purpose it
        is always adviced to have a 'printable version' of your page. Michiel

        Hey Chris! I could not agree more :). I actually started the same kind
        of topic a long while ago.. But some people didn't really like my idea..
        And I don't really have the knowhow to setup a good forum like that.. -

        Since I have no other cuber nearby, I just invented "fake teamsolving".
        Put the cube on a surface and then make turns alternating between your

        far, got a 1:37.49 which should be very easy to beat. Try it :-) Cheers!

        &gt; I dunno, it just seems like that would be way easier than this. I
        agree with you 100%. I would even take the time to set it up. It's just
        hard to move this group to a new forum because so many people have been
        here for a long time and fear the change :). Even if we tried to move
        the group to a new location, I think lots of people would still continue
        to post here, it's just habit. I don't post nearly as much as a lot of
        people here, but I have been reading for about 2 years. A forum would be
        better because it keeps all the topics in one group. I wouldn't need to
        shift through a big long stream of messages to find the next/previous in
        a topic. It would even make it easier to see what messages you havn't
        read yet. I realize that many email programs can sort the messages in an
        appealing way, but I happen to check the board from the internet and
        don't really want all these messages coming to my inbox. I think the
        only way we'll move to a new location is when Yahoo explodes and we're
        all forced to move. I don't plan on that happening any time soon, so
        until then, I think we're stuck with this. -Chris

        Ya i totally agree. In my institute we have a common discussion forum
        based on phpBB containing about 2000 users. With about 1000 posts
        everyday. and everything is going very smoothly. with phpBB the
        advantage is that you can have plugins to it also like we just had a
        shoutbox added to our forum and its a craze now. Also the practice of
        administrating the forum is a piece of cake - everything is already
        providied by the developers. Also there are searching facilities, pm
        users and many more things... I would love to see a php forum for
        spedcubing but the webspace i get dosent allow php scripts to run .. :(
        So i would request others who have registered domains(Joel, Dan, etc) to
        try out this thing, its really easy to setup you just need a MySql
        database additionally. PS: Stefan you dont have to type [quote] [/quote]
        everytime. theres a buton below each reply that does the job for you.

        Well, I am new to this site and after coming here a few times, I &gt;
        &gt; am &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite annoyed by the layout, (all the Re:s
        that take up pages &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pages). &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; That's not the fault of the system, that's the fault of
        the people &gt; &gt; &gt; misusing it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but with a nice PHP forum, it wouldnt
        happen at all. &gt; &gt; You can full-quote in those forums as well. And
        neither here nor there &gt; is it necessary. Quote the parts you're
        answering and leave the rest &gt; out. Very simple. Actually it's
        simpler here than in phpBB, since I &gt; have to type extra [quote] and
        [/quote] a lot, which is very annoying. &gt; &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; P.S.
        What happened to your forum? I must admit I didn't bookmark it... &gt;
        :-( Well maybe i just need to get used to this layout. I'm just so used
        to the standard forum layout. Whatever...

        Hello Pedro, The most widely used applet in my opinion is the Rubik
        player applet. Its really easy to use and setup. Get it fro here :

        of java applets used for rubiks cube are these two:

        Bwahahahahaha. Victory. After much playing around with my 4x4 (read:
        working), I found a simple move to swap two center pieces on adjacent
        sides. Using this move, coupled with r2u2r2u2, I've managed to solve my
        4x4 with this new method. Also, I've found a way around the difficult
        parity, but it's intuitive and difficult. I still think someone out
        there has to know a simpler way to fix this. Anywho, November is
        creeping up quickly, and I'd like to be ready by then, so if Per could
        just share all his secrets right now, that would be great. =) -Mike

        found with this method is too many slice moves. I Can't do fast slice
        moves for my life, but if you can do 'em it could be fast. Which
        commuter do you use for two edges left? For centers, r2b2r2b2, ldl' U
        ld'l' U', and r'urUr'u'd'rU'r'dr are nice. --- In

        &gt; The nice thing about forums is that their pretty easy to maintain.
        All &gt; you need is a server and some users. People post and the server
        &gt; serves. Not much to it. &gt; &gt; -Chris On the swedish webpage for
        Rubik's cube we use a phpBB forum that works fine. Of course where not
        that many users but it's very easy to follow a thread compared to this
        mailing group. /Gunnar Krig

        There are more techniques to memorize the cube than piece by piece : you
        can have a photographic memory which only requires to look once at each
        face to know it completely. And then with 6 images you can build a cube
        inside your head and then start to solve it. I believe he uses a memory

        memorize the cube than piece by piece : &gt; you can have a photographic
        memory which only requires to look once at &gt; each face to know it
        completely. I don't really believe in that kind of thing. Just recently
        I read in a psychology book about an experiment where kids were shown an
        Alice in Wonderland picture and afterwards they were asked how many
        stripes the tail of the cat in the tree has. Surprise, surprise, there
        was a boy who got the right answer 13 and he explained that he saw the
        picture in his mind and counted. Big deal. Give me enough kids and I'll
        certainly find one who gets it right and they probably all try to see it
        in their mind and count so when someone gets it right then that will be
        his explanation. Stupid experiment! Tell me: With all those people who
        can memorize a page of a phone book completely and exactly in just one
        short look, why did none of them ever break a single world record for
        memorizing? All the records you can see here must make them laugh:
        http://www.recordholders.org/en/records/quick-memory/quick-memory.html I
        think what created this myth of photographic memory are stupid people
        misinterpreting things. Take cubing for example, very similar story: How
        often do I hear people around me whisper to each other "wow he doesn't
        even look"? It mostly happens when I scramble or they even say it
        because they don't realize I *do* look between the steps of the method,
        e.g. between OLL and PLL. They just misinterpret things and of course
        they tell others and the story begins... And consider the "Rubik's Cubic
        Compendium" book in which Mr Rubik himself was involved so it's kinda
        official. Chapter 6 is about photographic memory and stuff and the
        author ends by saying "And he did not even look at it" after describing
        how he saw a guy twist a cube in a train without looking at the cube.
        The chapter though makes it so obvious that the author is a non-cuber
        and probably has no clue about it so I claim he was probably wrong (yes
        I know blindsolving is possible but I hear the "he doesn't even look"
        much more often when I scramble than when I actually blindsolve).
        Another myth is extreme speedreading. Tony Buzan, a guy well-known for
        memorizing/speedreading/mindmapping books (though I don't like him very
        much because I'm convinced he makes up lots of the "facts" he claims in
        his books) writes in his speedreading book about a girl who could read
        416,250 words per minute if she could only flip the pages fast enough.
        Assuming average word length of 5 letters and 60*60 letters fitting on
        one page that's 9.6 pages per second! And she's supposed to know
        everything perfectly then. Apart from the speed itself, I'd like to ask
        again why she doesn't simply shatter the speedreading world records (yes
        there are even world championships). And why 416,250? How can they find
        out so exactly? Why did Tony not mention any details about how it was
        measured? &gt; I believe he uses a memory technique of that kind. As far
        as I know he doesn't. Stefan

        heh, good point....okay, so the polls part is fine, you can use polls on
        the yahoo group. but I'm still saying, forums are undeniably more useful

        &gt; How can you make that sound like an advantage? Do we need more
        here? &gt; I'd rather claim the opposite. &gt; &gt; Stefan I wasn't
        saying it was an advantage, because we all know that this group needs no
        maintanence whatsoever. Yahoo pretty much takes care of that. I was
        simply saying how easy it is to get a phpBB server up and running. I
        just don't think that moving to a php forum would require that much more
        work for whoever decided the host the thing (which I would be glad to
        do). I must admire your dedication to this group. It's incredible. Can

        Fair enough. We could set the message limit to 15 or so per page. That
        sounds reasonable. I believe there are phpbb mods available that allow a
        user to select if he/she wants to view avatars, but if not we could just
        take vote to see how many people really want avatars and possibly
        disable them globally. As for the reverse thread option, phpbb has
        sorting options at the bottom of each thread. I'm just trying to make
        this sound appealing to everyone ;) -Chris

        Hey everyone, When I started this group it was a yahoo club, before
        there were even groups. That gave you the option to hide your e-mail
        address, and when things converted over to groups a couple years later
        that option was kept. Only groups where you are NOT allowed to hide your
        e-mail address can have polls. The fault is in this group having been
        successful for too long :-D Chris &gt; I claim that's not the fault of

        dubious point. (Where did he write about it, though?) &gt; a girl who
        &gt; could read 416,250 words per minute if she could only flip the

        &gt; Yeah, just... don't bring up the music topic with me... Supposedly,
        Berlioz wrote the whole Symphonie Fantastique in one night, which gives
        a rate of something in the order of 10 notes/sec if you consider he
        started writing at, say, 6PM and stopped at 9AM. Which is, not
        possible... That's one of these myths... Also, I became quite expert in
        the field of Russian composers and more specifically Shostakovitch.
        Anyway, it is said (and I have reasons to believe it is true, actually
        no musician I know ever doubted that) that he was sitting in a pub one
        day with his friend and conductor and composer Nikolai Malko. Back then,
        there was one very popular song all over the world called "Tea for Two"
        (excerpt from "No, No, Nanette" by Vincent Youman). I know everyone here
        knows that song even if the title doesn't ring a bell, especially the
        French members of that group (vous vous souvenez, "la Grande
        Vadrouille", avec de Funï¿½s et Bourvil et bien d'autres encore? le truc
        qu'il siffle dans les bains turcs, et bah c'est ï¿½a...) Anyway, Shosta
        said to Malko, "come on, that thing sucks I bet I can orchestrate it in
        less than one hour" (well I guess that's not the way he said
        it,especially cuz both of them didn't speak one word of English back
        then) so they sat down in the pub, ordered a vodka and started to write
        it. 40 minutes later Shosta was done, with a brilliant orchestration I
        still can't believe someone wrote anything so cool. I think Malko was
        done about 30 minutes later, I've never heard his version of it anyway,
        but a while later, Shosta took that music again, thought it would be
        cool to insert it after the 3rd act of his ballett "the golden Age". Too
        bad for him, the only piece of that ballet that was "encored" every
        evening was that one piece, which doesn't have anything to do with the
        rest of the ballet anyway. that was just my last ï¿½0.02 before taking
        the plane tomorrow and switching to plain US$... Oh, and yeah, that post
        was totally inadequate, yeah... just felt like spending 10 mins on it
        instead of packing my stuff d'oh. Oh and if anyone wants to do
        something, I'll be in the Detroit, MI, area between tomorrow evening and
        next Wednesday. Won't have a chance to drive very far from home though.
        Drop me a line (Jon I don't forget you maybe planned something, just
        tell me before next wednesday if you can) Franï¿½ois

        Hi Mike, There was a long thread on this a while ago. I'm not about to
        try to search for it, but Chris mentioned that mathematically parity
        boils down to 1 quarter turn. I demonstrated that it was true, but I
        took 64 moves. Chris takes 15. Anyway, if you solve the Right and Left
        sides, with or without bothering with any of the Up edges, you can check
        for parity. If you have a parity problem you make one vertical slice
        quarter turn, then solve the rest with even-numbered moves. Cheers,

        &gt; After much playing around with my 4x4 (read: working), I found a
        simple move to swap two center pieces on adjacent sides. Using this
        move, coupled with r2u2r2u2, I've managed to solve my 4x4 with this new
        method. Also, I've found a way around the difficult parity, but it's
        intuitive and difficult. I still think someone out there has to know a
        simpler way to fix this. Anywho, November is creeping up quickly, and
        I'd like to be ready by then, so if Per could just share all his secrets
        right now, that would be great. =) &gt; &gt; -Mike Bennett &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; One problem I found with this method is too many slice
        moves. I Can't &gt; do fast slice moves for my life, but if you can do
        'em it could be &gt; fast. Which commuter do you use for two edges left?
        &gt; &gt; For centers, r2b2r2b2, ldl' U ld'l' U', and r'urUr'u'd'rU'r'dr
        are nice. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but with a nice PHP forum, it wouldnt

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I am new to this site and after coming here a few
        times, I &gt; &gt; &gt; am &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite annoyed by the
        layout, (all the Re:s that take up pages &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; pages). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's not the
        fault of the system, that's the fault of the people &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        misusing it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but with a nice PHP forum, it wouldnt happen at
        all. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can full-quote in those forums as well. And
        neither here nor there &gt; &gt; is it necessary. Quote the parts you're
        answering and leave the rest &gt; &gt; out. Very simple. Actually it's
        simpler here than in phpBB, since I &gt; &gt; have to type extra [quote]
        and [/quote] a lot, which is very annoying. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stefan
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; P.S. What happened to your forum? I must admit I
        didn't bookmark it... &gt; &gt; :-( Well, what I basically meant, was
        that with all the quoting, it wouldn't get such a mess, even if people
        'full quote' (like you call it) on a PHPBB forum (like the mess above
        :)). I tried to setup some forums, some on free hosts, and also on the
        free webspace my university provided to me, but that was just to test
        out the possibilities. - Joël.

        I'd gladly switch to a forum. I've only been actively invovled in one
        forum before, and I found it a much more enjoyable experience than
        sifting through emails from this group. But is it necessary to start up

        don't we just shut down this, and direct everyone to there? I hear a lot

        I read in a psychology book about an experiment where kids were shown an
        Alice in Wonderland picture and afterwards they were asked how many
        stripes the tail of the cat in the tree has. Surprise, surprise, there
        was a boy who got the right answer 13 and he explained that he saw the

        certainly find one who gets it right and they probably all try to see it
        in their mind and count so when someone gets it right then that will be
        his explanation. Stupid experiment! Tell me: With all those people who
        can memorize a page of a phone book completely and exactly in just one
        short look, why did none of them ever break a single world record for
        memorizing? All the records you can see here must make them laugh:
        http://www.recordholders.org/en/records/quick-memory/quick-memory.html I
        think what created this myth of photographic memory are stupid people
        misinterpreting things. Take cubing for example, very similar story: How
        often do I hear people around me whisper to each other "wow he doesn't
        even look"? It mostly happens when I scramble or they even say it
        because they don't realize I *do* look between the steps of the method,
        e.g. between OLL and PLL. They just misinterpret things and of course
        they tell others and the story begins... And consider the "Rubik's Cubic
        Compendium" book in which Mr Rubik himself was involved so it's kinda
        official. Chapter 6 is about photographic memory and stuff and the
        author ends by saying "And he did not even look at it" after describing
        how he saw a guy twist a cube in a train without looking at the cube.
        The chapter though makes it so obvious that the author is a non-cuber
        and probably has no clue about it so I claim he was probably wrong (yes
        I know blindsolving is possible but I hear the "he doesn't even look"
        much more often when I scramble than when I actually blindsolve).
        Another myth is extreme speedreading. Tony Buzan, a guy well-known for
        memorizing/speedreading/mindmapping books (though I don't like him very
        much because I'm convinced he makes up lots of the "facts" he claims in
        his books) writes in his speedreading book about a girl who could read
        416,250 words per minute if she could only flip the pages fast enough.
        Assuming average word length of 5 letters and 60*60 letters fitting on
        one page that's 9.6 pages per second! And she's supposed to know
        everything perfectly then. Apart from the speed itself, I'd like to ask
        again why she doesn't simply shatter the speedreading world records (yes
        there are even world championships). And why 416,250? How can they find
        out so exactly? Why did Tony not mention any details about how it was
        measured? &gt; I believe he uses a memory technique of that kind. As far
        as I know he doesn't. Stefan

        Not discrediting the php forums, but... I think Google groups is a
        viable option. Last time I looked, it was still in beta, but I haven't
        noticed any problems. When this topic last came up, some people opposed
        switching because they used this group via email. I'm pretty sure that
        Google groups works that way too. BUT... On the site, it keeps topics in
        context just like gmail or a forum. I'm not sure it has features like
        polls, etc... but if it's anything like gmail, load times should at
        least be a little better than yahoo.

        test and she read 1390 words in a fifth of a second. Somehow I wonder
        though how they measured so exactly, but it explains the huge number
        since 1390*5*60=417000. Of course it's slightly off so they must've
        actually measured 0.20036 seconds. Btw, she's Russian and the scientists
        testing her are Russian, too. Not that I have anything against them, but
        I don't necessarily trust everything that comes from Russia, especially
        if it's something spectacular. And unfortunately Tony didn't bother to
        mention when this happened (the text makes it sound like it wasn't too
        long ago, though). And he only provides her first name Eugenia. I tried
        to find out any more details about her on the web but I've been
        unsuccessful. Summary: This kind of stuff are myths, stories that people
        just made up to impress other people or they misinterpreted things they

        Memory is a muscle and it is trained. The reason why we find this so
        incredible is because we are cubers and for blindfold solving, it hasn't
        come to the point where memory has become an issue. Now, I don't really
        think that Bernett is special. We, as speed cubers, just simply haven't
        trained our memories. I don't know if 8 second memorization is possible
        for us, as my father isn't an international grand master, but I do
        believe with practice and dedication, 15 to 20 second memorization
        should be possible. After that, I'll just have to rely on my speed
        cubing speed for my competitive edge. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        techniques to memorize the cube than piece by piece : &gt;&gt; you can
        have a photographic memory which only requires to look once &gt; at
        &gt;&gt; each face to know it completely. &gt; &gt; I don't really
        believe in that kind of thing. Just recently I read in &gt; a psychology
        book about an experiment where kids were shown an Alice &gt; in
        Wonderland picture and afterwards they were asked how many stripes &gt;
        the tail of the cat in the tree has. Surprise, surprise, there was a
        &gt; boy who got the right answer 13 and he explained that he saw the
        &gt; picture in his mind and counted. Big deal. Give me enough kids and
        &gt; I'll certainly find one who gets it right and they probably all try
        to &gt; see it in their mind and count so when someone gets it right
        then that &gt; will be his explanation. Stupid experiment! &gt; &gt;
        Tell me: With all those people who can memorize a page of a phone book
        &gt; completely and exactly in just one short look, why did none of them
        &gt; ever break a single world record for memorizing? All the records
        you &gt; can see here must make them laugh: &gt;
        http://www.recordholders.org/en/records/quick-memory/quick-memory.html
        &gt; &gt; I think what created this myth of photographic memory are
        stupid &gt; people misinterpreting things. Take cubing for example, very
        similar &gt; story: How often do I hear people around me whisper to each
        other "wow &gt; he doesn't even look"? It mostly happens when I scramble
        or they even &gt; say it because they don't realize I *do* look between
        the steps of the &gt; method, e.g. between OLL and PLL. They just
        misinterpret things and of &gt; course they tell others and the story
        begins... And consider the &gt; "Rubik's Cubic Compendium" book in which
        Mr Rubik himself was involved &gt; so it's kinda official. Chapter 6 is
        about photographic memory and &gt; stuff and the author ends by saying
        "And he did not even look at it" &gt; after describing how he saw a guy
        twist a cube in a train without &gt; looking at the cube. The chapter
        though makes it so obvious that the &gt; author is a non-cuber and
        probably has no clue about it so I claim he &gt; was probably wrong (yes
        I know blindsolving is possible but I hear the &gt; "he doesn't even
        look" much more often when I scramble than when I &gt; actually
        blindsolve). &gt; &gt; Another myth is extreme speedreading. Tony Buzan,
        a guy well-known for &gt; memorizing/speedreading/mindmapping books
        (though I don't like him &gt; very much because I'm convinced he makes
        up lots of the "facts" he &gt; claims in his books) writes in his
        speedreading book about a girl who &gt; could read 416,250 words per
        minute if she could only flip the pages &gt; fast enough. Assuming
        average word length of 5 letters and 60*60 &gt; letters fitting on one
        page that's 9.6 pages per second! And she's &gt; supposed to know
        everything perfectly then. Apart from the speed &gt; itself, I'd like to
        ask again why she doesn't simply shatter the &gt; speedreading world
        records (yes there are even world championships). &gt; And why 416,250?
        How can they find out so exactly? Why did Tony not &gt; mention any
        details about how it was measured? &gt; &gt;&gt; I believe he uses a
        memory technique of that kind. &gt; &gt; As far as I know he doesn't.

        I agree, we should find a solution that satisfies all of these

        This whole debate reminds me of the debate about stackmats and Rubik's
        timers. One is used because it has been, but the other is obviously more
        natural to the task at hand. Some wish to stay out of familiarity,
        others for lack of effort. I personally vote to switch, so long as there
        is still an option to receive the messages via email. I think one of the
        main benefits of php style forums, other than the fabulous organization,
        is the ability to watch various threads that interest you. I mean, sure,
        everyone loves hearing about cooking your cube with potatoes, but some

        Oh forgot that one too, how could I... Bach wrote the 6 suites for cello

        To speak up for this side too, I consider myself a poweruser of this
        group (I check it several times a day) and I always use the website. I
        like the variety in that the messages are from all different categories
        when I click the next button. Plus I like the way the discussion flows
        since you forget what was going on a week before. You don't lose
        important messages if you bookmark, or just remember what month it was
        in. Of course I do admit a forum makes it easier to search, it is a pain
        to find a message where I can't remember when it was posted. Of course
        others don't like the group for the very same reasons that I like it, so
        these are just my two cents really. I am in favor of the yahoo layout,
        and I use solely the website to read this group. Plus I'm kind of biased
        towards the group for obvious reasons lol, so maybe my argument isn't
        the best one to listen to. Chris --- In

        want to switch, I might still post to this group just because all the
        people are still here and only very few on the other (at least on the
        WCA this is true right now). We'd maybe need to have two things: (1)

        for LL of 2x2x2 Hey all, Does anyone know how many different algorithms
        it is to solve the last layer of a pocket cube in one algorithm? Also
        does anyone know where I can get a list of these to learn if the number
        is not that large (Can't memorize 1211 algs like the 3x3x3). Dwayne

        trying to say with respect to that was that email is an attractive
        option to power users because it enables users to completely control how
        emails are accessed, authored, rendered ... As an example, I like to use
        an advanced writing tool called "vim" for all of my writing needs
        (reports, emails, Yahoo! messages, etc.) that doubles my efficiency. The
        sole reason I am able to use vim with Yahoo! is that Yahoo! is using a
        standard protocol, called Email, with which many power tools can
        interoperate. Ryan

        to know this for sure instead of just guessing, you could read his
        memoirs in which he writes: "Immediately after this composition on the
        subject of Faust, and still under the influence of Goeth's poem, I wrote
        the Fantastic Symphony; some parts caused me great difficulty, but
        others came with incredible ease. Thus the adagio (the Scene in the
        countryside), which always has such an effect on the general public and
        on myself, exhausted me for more than three weeks; I gave it up then
        started it again two or three times. By contrast the March to the
        scaffold was written in one night. Nevertheless I made many changes to
        both pieces and to all the other movements of the work over a period of
        several years." Ryan

        computationally more expensive than the process of merely taking a
        photograph. In a sense, the process of taking a photograph uses a
        pre-computed image (thanks universe) which is simply projected into your
        memory, while the process of reading involves a huge amount of analysis
        to determine the meaning/sense. Many people do find that they can stare
        at a picture, close their eyes and -- for a short moment -- see an
        impression of the picture in their mind's eye, without much
        computational effort at all. Then how is it that some people can
        supposedly see the impression clearer and for longer than others? It
        seems to me that this is because those people use more computational
        effort looking for the key points that would help to sustain the
        impression. This may be conscious or subconscious. I don't have well
        developed brain photo skills at all, but I do have a similar ability to
        make brain recordings of sounds. This was developed from a young age (at
        a subconscious level), and later, as I became more analytical, I became
        aware of how my brain was actually doing it. Relating back to
        photography vs. reading, I discovered I am much better at hearing than
        listening. That is, I can hear and record a sound signal instantly, and
        play it back in my head as many times as I wish, but some times it takes
        me a while to analyse the sound and realise that someone is trying to
        talk to me :-) Ryan

        When speedreading in a way where you take in a whole page at the time,
        you will not remember much instantly, but your brain will process what
        you have "seen", so in a short time you will remember and comprehend
        about as much as a person that read the text in "normal" speed. So when
        someone "read" 1390 words in 1/5 of a second, they do in fact take a
        brain photagraph, but the brain process the info as well, so a person
        with very good skills will remember the info "scanned", not reading back
        from the "scanned" image. But as Stefan said, the fact that she can read
        1390 words in a fifth of a second, does not mean that she can read or
        comprehend 416,250 words a minute. Even if Afasa Powell ran 100 meter in
        9.77 seconds, he can not run 10000 meter in 977 seconds. Even the brain
        gets tired, right ? :) Terje -----Opprinnelig melding----- Fra:

        Re: J Bernett Orlando When speedreading in a way where you take in a
        whole page at the time, you will not remember much instantly, but your
        brain will process what you have "seen", so in a short time you will
        remember and comprehend about as much as a person that read the text in
        "normal" speed. So when someone "read" 1390 words in 1/5 of a second,
        they do in fact take a brain photagraph, but the brain process the info
        as well, so a person with very good skills will remember the info
        "scanned", not reading back from the "scanned" image. But as Stefan
        said, the fact that she can read 1390 words in a fifth of a second, does
        not mean that she can read or comprehend 416,250 words a minute. Even if
        Afasa Powell ran 100 meter in 9.77 seconds, he can not run 10000 meter
        in 977 seconds. Even the brain gets tired, right ? :) Terje

        I found the explanation. They made a test and she read &gt; 1390 words
        in a fifth of a second. This is not so unbelievable to me. I mean, I
        don't believe that she can read 1390 words in 1/5th of a second, but I
        do think it is possible to take a brain photograph of 1390 words in
        1/5th of a second, then close your eyes and read back what it says in
        the photograph. It seems to me that the process of reading is
        computationally more expensive than the process of merely taking a
        photograph. In a sense, the process of taking a photograph uses a
        pre-computed image (thanks universe) which is simply projected into your
        memory, while the process of reading involves a huge amount of analysis
        to determine the meaning/sense. Many people do find that they can stare
        at a picture, close their eyes and -- for a short moment -- see an
        impression of the picture in their mind's eye, without much
        computational effort at all. Then how is it that some people can
        supposedly see the impression clearer and for longer than others? It
        seems to me that this is because those people use more computational
        effort looking for the key points that would help to sustain the
        impression. This may be conscious or subconscious. I don't have well
        developed brain photo skills at all, but I do have a similar ability to
        make brain recordings of sounds. This was developed from a young age (at
        a subconscious level), and later, as I became more analytical, I became
        aware of how my brain was actually doing it. Relating back to
        photography vs. reading, I discovered I am much better at hearing than
        listening. That is, I can hear and record a sound signal instantly, and
        play it back in my head as many times as I wish, but some times it takes
        me a while to analyse the sound and realise that someone is trying to

        Well these COLL algs are great to learn for other reasons but when it
        comes to the 2x2, lowing the restriction to preserve edge orientation
        does lower the average number of moves. Thus CLL would be faster. -Doug

        Well summarised, Ryan. I use both email and the web interface to access
        this group. For reading messages, I prefer email. I synchronise email to
        my iPAQ every day and catch up on messages from this group on the train
        to/from work (although not doing such things on the train this morning
        for obvious reasons - if you don't know what I'm talking about, check
        out any major news site and you'll see what happened in London this
        morning). For posting messages I generally use the web interface. I
        could do this from email, but I like to log on to the site every now and
        then. Re clogging up your email inbox - just set up another email
        address for messages from this group (this is what I have done), or use
        a filter - very easy options. Also, I have zillions of spare Gmail
        invitations and I'm happy to send them to anyone who wants one. Re
        moving, I would be very happy to move to any forum that satisfied Ryan's
        three criteria. Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com --- In

        important) &gt; &gt; Let's make these the requirements for any plan of
        action. Also, let's &gt; not make any immediate decision until we have
        (3) sorted out. &gt; &gt; Justification of requirements: &gt; &gt; 1.
        Email is the most flexible solution for powerusers. With the right &gt;
        tools and expertise, each individual to decide how they wish to &gt;
        interface with the forum, and not be forced to use a particular &gt;
        interface. If you wanted, you could make your inbox look just like a
        &gt; fancy web-based forum, but better integrated with your personal
        &gt; operating environment. This is important to me at least. &gt; &gt;
        2. Non powerusers still need a ready made solution, and so a web &gt;
        interface can do that job well. &gt; &gt; 3. If we are going to move to
        another host, let's make sure we can &gt; transfer the whole message
        archive across because there are a great &gt; number of interesting and
        significant posts in the archives that people &gt; still refer to today.

        Ummm ... The layout there is far too "metal/motif" for me. It's not
        really delicate. I quite like the layout here at Yahoo Groups.
        Disadvantage here is of coz that all the posts are entering a
        hotchpotch. Some more structure would be nice :-) Being able to read and
        post by using email is advantageous for many ppl. So i guess the perfect
        group/bbs/forum does not exist yet. Apart from the lack of structure
        here at Yahoo i think i would prefer not to move :-) And this group (and
        others here at Yahoo) are well established. I can't see there is a
        pressing reason to move it... Cheers! -Per PS! These yahoo groups have
        many features not actively used like calendar and option to create
        databases. Maybe the moderators can tell us how much available space the
        groups have. Since the yahoo email has had an increased quota i assume
        the same goes for the groups ? &gt; --- In

        I don't think we're trying to fragment the groups up. I want to have a
        single forum for everyone to use, but have it be an actual forum, not a
        Yahoo Group or Google group. the Yahoo group works okay....but it could
        be so much better. my main problem with this, like I've stated a few
        times before, is that you cannot search through previous posts. I have a
        few I would love to go back and reread, they were very helpful and
        informative, but they're lost in the archives somewhere and the search
        takes forever to find anything about it. a forum you can search through
        the entire archive of threads, or even just all the threads in a single
        topic, such as blindfold cubing or one handed or something. makes it
        much, much easier to find things. --- In

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, Reading over my last post I don't want it to seem like I'm
        completely against forums, though I really don't get excited at the idea
        of having this group on a forum over the current setup. I've heard some
        suggestions to shut down this group in order to facilitate this. Only
        Ron and I can do that, and speaking for myself I would only do that if:
        1) We were able to archive all the messages that haven't been lost (we
        did lose about a year's worth of message when clubs converted to forums)
        and make them very easily viewable and searchable for anyone who wants
        to. 2) We make sure that everyone on this group has lots of ways of
        finding out that the forum is moving. And even then I think this forum
        should stay open long enough to let stragglers know (a year, or at least
        several months). We can make it so that joining the group requires
        moderator approval, and Ron and I could simply not approve anyone who
        applies, but rather send them to the other forum. 3) e-mail access to
        post and read messages is maintained on the new forum for all users who
        prefer this. 4) Any other criteria that I have left out in this post but
        that most people would not agree to losing. I'm not flexible on the
        first 3, but am willing to add more criteria.
        ---------------------------------- To be very clear, I absolutely do not
        want to move this group to a forum. I really like the current setup, and
        from experience it has taken a VERY long time to build up the number of
        members we have right now. However, having said that if enough people do
        want to move I am willing to consider helping provided the above
        criteria are completely satisfied. I say "consider" because Ron and I
        are the main co-moderators (with Doug Li helping with messages and other
        moderator things of course :-D ), and I can't and won't act without
        consulting him first. Chris

        Yeah, Gmail is great. It archives all your mail for you, so you can
        search through previous posts, and it groups messages together with the
        same subject line, so all messages from one discussion are in one place
        and you can easily look at any one you want. And, I've heard, that if
        you somehow actualy reach the limit for space they offer, instead of not
        letting you get more emails, it just says something along the lines of
        "your inbox is 104% full". So if anyone is interested just ask someone
        with a Gmail account, we have 50 invites each. -Evan On 7/7/05,

        we must stay here! I would rather not move to another email-based group

        I have been keeping up with this topic. I highly agree with Chris on how
        it takes a lot of time to earn as many members as we have. I also use
        many of the more advanced forums out there. I don't find the benefits of
        those to outweight the effort needed to convert. And I'm sure that would
        end up forcing people to learn a bunch of phpBB stuff that they might
        not otherwise need. Though I'm not a member I regularly check the twisty
        forum for example. I found that using gmail was a great way of viewing
        this group's posts as several people have mentioned. Frankly, I think
        that direct suggustions to shut down this fourm is sort of heresy. That
        reminds me, it really sucks that we lost like a years worth of posts...
        Anyhow, those three criteria are pretty reasonable I think. And for the
        record, I'm only a moderator officially, all I do is delete spam every
        now and then and am not around during the academic year. So Chris and
        Ron really don't need to consult me for anything. Though when I am
        around, I tend to be pretty active, when it comes to actual cubing
        methodology, I am very opinionated (sometimes too much) due to my
        experience. I'm getting way past my prime when it comes to speedcubing.
        I think after the next WC, I'll retire and start being a tournament
        runner like Tyson (but for the Midwest) and try for a position on WCA.
        Cubing is starting to drive me insane, and I fear I'm getting about a
        second slower after every passing year... today my JNet average was
        24.09s. *sigh* (and it's so hopeless too, oh dear god I suck) OK, let's
        take a moment to consider the LOGISTICS of it!!! Trying to get hundreds
        of members to switch? Any guesses as to how long that would take? I know
        our setup is far from being the best, I hate the ads, the loading times
        aren't spectacular, the lack of editing, the plain- ness of it all, the
        inability to control spam (if you have it sent to your e-mail instead of
        just reading it here), ..., but it feels like home :). I say keep it
        simple, don't split the posts into all these new forums. Besides for
        more specilized things, there are already other groups/fourms for, I
        check the Petrus group, the Caltech group, and a few others too. I know
        some of you (especially those CS inclined) are ambitious enough to take
        on building a fourm (already see a few nice ones popping up). But take
        these 3 criteria as added challenges, mainly transfering the old posts.
        Realize that you need Chris's support, not many cubers out there command
        as much respect as he does, and if he says no, your definately out of
        luck. It better be a damn good phpBB forum for us to gamble all our
        chips on... if we do end up seriously considering (I'd need to see all
        the old posts populated in first of course). -Doug (member for 2 years)

        my last post I don't want it to seem like I'm &gt; completely against
        forums, though I really don't get excited at the &gt; idea of having
        this group on a forum over the current setup. &gt; &gt; I've heard some
        suggestions to shut down this group in order to &gt; facilitate this.
        Only Ron and I can do that, and speaking for &gt; myself I would only do
        that if: &gt; &gt; 1) We were able to archive all the messages that
        haven't been lost &gt; (we did lose about a year's worth of message when
        clubs converted to &gt; forums) and make them very easily viewable and
        searchable for anyone &gt; who wants to. &gt; &gt; 2) We make sure that
        everyone on this group has lots of ways of &gt; finding out that the
        forum is moving. And even then I think this &gt; forum should stay open
        long enough to let stragglers know (a year, &gt; or at least several
        months). We can make it so that joining the &gt; group requires
        moderator approval, and Ron and I could simply not &gt; approve anyone
        who applies, but rather send them to the other forum. &gt; &gt; 3)
        e-mail access to post and read messages is maintained on the new &gt;
        forum for all users who prefer this. &gt; &gt; 4) Any other criteria
        that I have left out in this post but that &gt; most people would not
        agree to losing. I'm not flexible on the &gt; first 3, but am willing to
        add more criteria. &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------- &gt;
        &gt; To be very clear, I absolutely do not want to move this group to a
        &gt; forum. I really like the current setup, and from experience it has
        &gt; taken a VERY long time to build up the number of members we have
        &gt; right now. However, having said that if enough people do want to
        &gt; move I am willing to consider helping provided the above criteria
        &gt; are completely satisfied. I say "consider" because Ron and I are
        &gt; the main co-moderators (with Doug Li helping with messages and
        other &gt; moderator things of course :-D ), and I can't and won't act
        without &gt; consulting him first. &gt; &gt; Chris

        You guys make it sound like it's the most normal thing in the world. Can
        you do it? Has someone demonstrated it to you? If so, please share some
        details. I just found another article:
        http://www.execuread.com/press_media.htm Quote: "[...] read a 30 000
        word book about Albert Einstein in 12s. Following that, she wrote a
        comprehension test and scored 95%." Depending on the book layout, that
        might be about 10 pages per second. Yeah ok I admit even I can flip the
        pages of a book that fast. My main argument is still this one: Of all
        those people (you'll easily find lots of reports of many people
        achieving things like that), why does not a single one of them ever go
        to a competition? They would completely SHATTER the existing world
        records. It'd be like a 10 meters tall basketball player in the NBA. Ok
        I don't have current world records but here's a report from 2001:
        http://www.msoworld.com/Press/Releases/MSO5day3.html It says "46012
        words in a under 21 minutes". And I do believe that. Why? Not because I
        can get even close to that myself or have seen someone else doing it,
        but simply because it was an official and well-known competition. Why
        does this other woman not just go there and beat 21 minutes with 19
        seconds? I mean, hello-o! Why don't *any* of those numerous geniuses go
        there? Don't tell me they're too shy or too decent or whatever. I'll
        tell you why: cause they're too lying. Stefan --- In

        mention any details about how it was measured? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok,
        gotta admit I found the explanation. They made a test and she read &gt;
        &gt; &gt; 1390 words in a fifth of a second. &gt; &gt; This is not so
        unbelievable to me. I mean, I don't believe that she can &gt; read 1390
        words in 1/5th of a second, but I do think it is possible to &gt; take a
        brain photograph of 1390 words in 1/5th of a second, then close &gt;
        your eyes and read back what it says in the photograph. It seems to me
        &gt; that the process of reading is computationally more expensive than
        the &gt; process of merely taking a photograph. In a sense, the process
        of taking &gt; a photograph uses a pre-computed image (thanks universe)
        which is simply &gt; projected into your memory, while the process of
        reading involves a huge &gt; amount of analysis to determine the
        meaning/sense. Many people do find &gt; that they can stare at a
        picture, close their eyes and -- for a short &gt; moment -- see an
        impression of the picture in their mind's eye, without &gt; much
        computational effort at all. &gt; &gt; Then how is it that some people
        can supposedly see the impression &gt; clearer and for longer than
        others? It seems to me that this is because &gt; those people use more
        computational effort looking for the key points &gt; that would help to
        sustain the impression. This may be conscious or &gt; subconscious. &gt;
        &gt; I don't have well developed brain photo skills at all, but I do
        have a &gt; similar ability to make brain recordings of sounds. This was
        developed &gt; from a young age (at a subconscious level), and later, as
        I became more &gt; analytical, I became aware of how my brain was
        actually doing it. &gt; &gt; Relating back to photography vs. reading, I
        discovered I am much better &gt; at hearing than listening. That is, I
        can hear and record a sound signal &gt; instantly, and play it back in
        my head as many times as I wish, but some &gt; times it takes me a while
        to analyse the sound and realise that someone &gt; is trying to talk to
        me :-) &gt; &gt; Ryan &gt; &gt; &gt; YAHOO! GROUPS LINKS &gt; &gt; 

        I'm sure they started much later. Also, if we "move" somewhere else then
        I'd say we'll build up hundreds of members almost instantly. Well, at

        I just found another article: &gt;
        http://www.execuread.com/press_media.htm &gt; &gt; Quote: &gt; "[...]
        read a 30 000 word book about Albert Einstein in 12s. Following &gt;
        that, she wrote a comprehension test and scored 95%." &gt; &gt;
        Depending on the book layout, that might be about 10 pages per second.
        &gt; Yeah ok I admit even I can flip the pages of a book that fast. &gt;
        &gt; My main argument is still this one: Of all those people (you'll
        easily &gt; find lots of reports of many people achieving things like
        that), why &gt; does not a single one of them ever go to a competition?
        They would &gt; completely SHATTER the existing world records. It'd be
        like a 10 &gt; meters tall basketball player in the NBA. &gt; &gt; Ok I
        don't have current world records but here's a report from 2001: &gt;
        http://www.msoworld.com/Press/Releases/MSO5day3.html &gt; &gt; It says
        "46012 words in a under 21 minutes". And I do believe that. &gt; Why?
        Not because I can get even close to that myself or have seen &gt;
        someone else doing it, but simply because it was an official and &gt;
        well-known competition. Why does this other woman not just go there &gt;
        and beat 21 minutes with 19 seconds? I mean, hello-o! Why don't *any*
        &gt; of those numerous geniuses go there? Don't tell me they're too shy
        or &gt; too decent or whatever. I'll tell you why: cause they're too

        you have "seen", so in a short time you will remember and comprehend
        &gt;&gt; about as much as a person that read the text in "normal" speed.
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So when someone "read" 1390 words in 1/5 of a second,
        they do in &gt; fact &gt;&gt; take a brain photagraph, but the brain

        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, gotta admit I found the explanation. They
        made a test and she &gt; read &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 1390 words in a
        fifth of a second. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is not so unbelievable to me.
        I mean, I don't believe that she &gt; can &gt;&gt; read 1390 words in
        1/5th of a second, but I do think it is possible &gt; to &gt;&gt; take a
        brain photograph of 1390 words in 1/5th of a second, then &gt; close
        &gt;&gt; your eyes and read back what it says in the photograph. It
        seems to &gt; me &gt;&gt; that the process of reading is computationally
        more expensive than &gt; the &gt;&gt; process of merely taking a
        photograph. In a sense, the process of &gt; taking &gt;&gt; a photograph
        uses a pre-computed image (thanks universe) which is &gt; simply
        &gt;&gt; projected into your memory, while the process of reading
        involves a &gt; huge &gt;&gt; amount of analysis to determine the
        meaning/sense. Many people do &gt; find &gt;&gt; that they can stare at
        a picture, close their eyes and -- for a &gt; short &gt;&gt; moment --
        see an impression of the picture in their mind's eye, &gt; without
        &gt;&gt; much computational effort at all. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Then how is
        it that some people can supposedly see the impression &gt;&gt; clearer
        and for longer than others? It seems to me that this is &gt; because
        &gt;&gt; those people use more computational effort looking for the key
        &gt; points &gt;&gt; that would help to sustain the impression. This may
        be conscious or &gt;&gt; subconscious. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't have
        well developed brain photo skills at all, but I do have &gt; a &gt;&gt;
        similar ability to make brain recordings of sounds. This was &gt;
        developed &gt;&gt; from a young age (at a subconscious level), and
        later, as I became &gt; more &gt;&gt; analytical, I became aware of how
        my brain was actually doing it. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Relating back to
        photography vs. reading, I discovered I am much &gt; better &gt;&gt; at
        hearing than listening. That is, I can hear and record a sound &gt;
        signal &gt;&gt; instantly, and play it back in my head as many times as
        I wish, but &gt; some &gt;&gt; times it takes me a while to analyse the
        sound and realise that &gt; someone &gt;&gt; is trying to talk to me :-)

        once suggested to use paper pieces to fix the 3x3 &gt; center caps. I
        *hate* glue. I have used the hammer method and can live &gt; with it.
        But this paper method is now my favourite, it does the least &gt;
        damage. The cross shape I use now is great, when you push down the cap
        &gt; then the paper will slide inside perfectly. It does raise the cap
        &gt; slightly but that might actually be good because if you've played
        with &gt; a cube for a while you might notice that the centers move
        inside a bit &gt; because both they and the edges polish each other at
        the connection. Haha, I just realized that it won't raise the cap if you
        make the paper smaller. Stupid me ;-) And of course you don't need a
        cross, a rectangle that fixes two opposite sides does a good job, too. I
        wouldn't recommend a square to fix all four sides, cause its corners
        will not nicely fold and might clutter up, but maybe that'd actually be
        a good thing. Yeah, whatever... Stefan

        Hmm ... Which 2 edges are u swapping and calling "parity" ? And for the
        centers have u considered this one : (lr')d2(l'r)U'(lr')d2(l'r)U It
        looks longish but it's actually ony 8 moves counted with the Hardwick
        metric ;-) And besides u can sorta fingertrick at least the (l'r) "slice
        move" :-) Alrite my idea for swapping 2 edges easily is as follows. Turn
        an inner slice layer a quarter turn. Then cycle 3 edges on this layer so
        that u get 2 swapped edges. It messes with edges for sure. U might want
        to use Chris algorithm : R2 (u'R2)*5 instead of a simple u turn. Now u
        for sure know how to swap any 2 edges easily. U can use this idea only
        if u do centers last, or else somehow "absorb" the side effect on the
        centers. Cheers! -Per PS! Also have a look at :
        (lr')d2(l'r)U'D'(lr')d2(l'r)UD And alrite also this :
        r'(ud')rU2r'(u'd)rU2 U want more rabbits? There are quite a few
        edge-rabbits too. Most simply involve cycling blocks around :-) They are
        easily performed but require some experience to see when to utilise
        them. &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Mike Bennett"

        &gt; After much playing around with my 4x4 (read: working), I found a
        simple move to swap two center pieces on adjacent sides. Using this
        move, coupled with r2u2r2u2, I've managed to solve my 4x4 with this new
        method. Also, I've found a way around the difficult parity, but it's
        intuitive and difficult. I still think someone out there has to know a
        simpler way to fix this. Anywho, November is creeping up quickly, and
        I'd like to be ready by then, so if Per could just share all his secrets
        right now, that would be great. =) &gt; &gt; -Mike Bennett &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; One problem I found with this method is too many slice
        moves. I Can't &gt; do fast slice moves for my life, but if you can do
        'em it could be &gt; fast. Which commuter do you use for two edges left?
        &gt; &gt; For centers, r2b2r2b2, ldl' U ld'l' U', and r'urUr'u'd'rU'r'dr
        are nice. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        Hey everyone, I recently received an e-mail from a guy Patrick Ludden
        who needs a speedcubing coach for an actor in a movie being filmed in
        San Francisco. &gt;From what he was saying the actor is fairly poplar
        and would want to "talk tech" with a speedcuber to get a feel for it and
        also for how to solve the cube quickly. The solve will be prepared of
        course and needs to be done in "something like ten quick moves". The
        scene involves an actor in a cab egged on by a friend to solve the cube,
        which he "does quickly". There is also the possibility of using a hands
        double, but it seems more likely that the actor will do the solve. I
        don't want to post this guy's e-mail address publicly, but e-mail me
        (chris@[nospam]speedcubing.com) if you are available and I will put you
        in contact with him. Remember to delete the [nospam] when you type that

        To be clear on my purpose for creating a Google speedsolving group: It
        wasn't created to fragment what we already have. Just like the
        strangepuzzle and the other user-created forums, it's just another
        option if we decide to move. It doesn't live up to Chris's third

        I keep getting asked to make a JNetCube that supports more then 2 users
        for online racing, so I think I'm going to start working on it. I'm not
        sure of the programming language I'm going to use, but I will promise to
        use another multiplatform language whether that may be java, perl, or
        even web-based like html or php. I have a little free time now after
        work so I'm going to investigate the best plan of action and get
        started! My question to you guys is: What features do you want? I'm
        going to incorperate the standard things like average, fastest time,
        slowest time, scramble, countdown, .... I just want to make sure there's
        nothing huge that people want because that would require an overhaul :)
        I want to get things right the first time. I hope to support an
        unlimited amount of users (the max amount to be set by the server) and
        to make the project dedicated server based. I can have a dedicated
        server constantly running at a specified URL (probably strangpuzzle.com)
        and have everyone just connect to the server and start a 'race room'.
        People could just connect to the room and race away with X amount of
        people. Does this sound like something people would use? I going to make
        it even if people don't want it :) but I figured I'd ask first too.
        Maybe this could also start a new weekly contest where people log on and
        race each other live. We'll see what happens. Let me know. -Chris

        I think there are too many sub forums. Just two or three is sufficient.
        Maybe even 1 subforum will do. After all, every topic on this group is
        posted on the same page, and that's not the big problem of this group.
        Too many subfora = confusing. Also, the amount of cubes on the

        I'm not exactly close to San Francisco... :-( Suggestion for the future
        "coach": Find a fingertrickable algorithm that changes the whole cube
        and has order 2, i.e. if you apply it twice to a solved cube you'll have
        the solved cube again. That will make it easier to learn/practice. It
        should be fingertrickable not only in order to execute it fast but also
        it will help the actor to learn/remember it. Optimally no cube
        rotations. So actually I'd suggest to have the DBL 2x2 solved already
        and only show the U, R and F faces (should be possible) so it can be an
        algorithm in the &lt;U,R,F&gt; group. To find such an algorithm simply
        choose an effect with order 2 and let ACube solve it in &lt;U,R,F&gt;.
        Oh, and do you know why they need a coach? Cause you'll be the one who
        has to solve the cube all the time cause the actor will screw up the
        algorithm. Please keep us updated, it's quite interesting they actually
        ask us. Cheers! Stefan --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Again I won't give away Patrick's e-mail, but here's the message he sent
        to me after that first one. ------------- chris, thanks for the email.
        the film is a studio film, and the actor is quite popular. one scene
        involves him riding in the back of a taxi with another actor. the other
        actor 'eggs' him on to try to solve the cube. so, our main actor does it
        quickly. so, we might need a cube set up for something like ten quick
        moves. i would get multiple cubes for extra takes. the actor might
        request to meet a speedcubing person to 'talk tech' with them. we might
        need a hand double, but it is too early in our prep to know that answer.
        basically i need a friendly person who would be OK talking to our actor,
        and then to be with me on set one day when we film the scene. this
        person would have to live in the Bay Area i suppose. what do you think?
        i would appreciate any help you could give me. cheers, patrick

        is just a tips page with general tips for cubers. The other one is an

        im not sure how easy this will be, but if you can, don't use java.
        mainly because its slow, but also because for some reason, after doing
        12 solves (at least for me), the sound stops. i'm not sure if its
        because of your programming or java, but it has become a nuisance.
        though it could just be my computer, im not sure. and for features...
        hmm iono. i guess my only gripe is that the sound goes off and its a tad
        slow. keep up the good work. On 7/7/05, Leyan Lo &lt;leyanlo@...&gt;

        record the sound of 1000 words in a second. Not at all. If you take a
        page of 1000 words and reduce its size by 200 times, the naked human eye
        cannot physically sense all of the light information required to
        actually see words. The resolution of sound, on the other hand, is in
        time, not space. After compressing 200 seconds worth of sound down to
        just 1 second, you are unreasonably expecting that I be able to hear
        everything as if it were at normal resolution. No, what I'm saying is
        that if a normal person is able to hear 100 details about a fragment of
        sound after 50 hearings, I can hear those same 100 details about a
        fragment of sound after only 1 hearing. I'm sure that after 50 hearings
        of a 1 second recording of 1000 spoken words, you would not pick up one
        single word. Do you understand? Give me 1 second of natural spoken
        English, and I can remember every inflection, tone, overtone, rhythm
        that I can reasonably hear at that resolution, as if I am making an
        audio recording. Give me, say, 15 seconds of some music, and I will hear
        and remember not only the "simple" information like the melody and
        rhythm, but all the layers of intrumentation and their precise(*)
        expression in terms of their tone, texture, and delayed timing. So, it
        is quite reasonable to me that if I can hear+record in one hearing what
        others can hear+record in 50 hearings, then some people can quite likely
        see+record in one look what others can see+record in 50 looks. I'm
        exiting this conversation now. Please Google eidetic memory if you want
        to find evidence more to your liking. (*) Regarding the word "precise",
        this does not mean "exact", of course. I can hear/record to a high level
        of precision, but not a perfect one. Memory, and even sensory input, is
        always an approximation of the real world. Ryan

        I would very much enjoy a slowest average statistic. I would also very
        much like a 'handicap' function, where you can automatically add a
        prespecified number of seconds to your time, so that cubers of different
        abilities could compete more evenly. Perhaps there could be a table or
        some function to compute the handicap based on average averages? This
        may help to make racing via the program more popular, as well as give us
        a chance to compete with people of different skill levels. It would also
        be nice to be able to do stop/starts in the middle of a time. When
        timing one step solves, you have to start and stop, then add the times
        up, then enter them separately. Another request would be to be able to
        crop solves out for compiling averages and getting different stats. With
        a function like this, you could make an average of your solves with
        different methods, for those of us using more than one. It would also
        allow us to make a 'best 12 solves' or similar save file, without
        forcing us to save and pare or individually enter anew. Other than that,
        an undo function seems almost necessary, if you don't include a separate
        'Accept' button. I cannot count the number of times I have accidentally
        double clicked when I've had to stop a solve to go answer the telephone.
        I think that about wraps up my list of demands/requests. I can't wait
        for the new version. =) -Mike Bennett ----- Original Message ----- From:

        (JNetCube2?) I keep getting asked to make a JNetCube that supports more
        then 2 users for online racing, so I think I'm going to start working on
        it. I'm not sure of the programming language I'm going to use, but I
        will promise to use another multiplatform language whether that may be
        java, perl, or even web-based like html or php. I have a little free
        time now after work so I'm going to investigate the best plan of action
        and get started! My question to you guys is: What features do you want?
        I'm going to incorperate the standard things like average, fastest time,
        slowest time, scramble, countdown, .... I just want to make sure there's
        nothing huge that people want because that would require an overhaul :)
        I want to get things right the first time. I hope to support an
        unlimited amount of users (the max amount to be set by the server) and
        to make the project dedicated server based. I can have a dedicated
        server constantly running at a specified URL (probably strangpuzzle.com)
        and have everyone just connect to the server and start a 'race room'.
        People could just connect to the room and race away with X amount of
        people. Does this sound like something people would use? I going to make
        it even if people don't want it :) but I figured I'd ask first too.
        Maybe this could also start a new weekly contest where people log on and
        race each other live. We'll see what happens. Let me know. -Chris

        I dont see why not competing in a championship, proves that you are a
        fraud. I guess there are many ppl around that could potentially do very
        well in mind olympics contests, but are not interrested or not aware of
        the fact that they exist. It's a bit too easy to just discredit them
        because they have not competed. The persons them self are probably not
        all that interrested in the media focus, but the "inventors" of the
        speed reading systems want media focus to attract more ppl and make more
        money. And the extreme results shown are, if they in fact are true,
        probably not something they could easily repeat, but I agree that they
        should shatter the world records on even a bad day. 46012 words in 21
        minutes are just over 2000 words a minute, and I myself can read over
        800 words a minute without any speedreading training, so that does not

        article: http://www.execuread.com/press_media.htm Quote: "[...] read a
        30 000 word book about Albert Einstein in 12s. Following that, she wrote
        a comprehension test and scored 95%." Depending on the book layout, that
        might be about 10 pages per second. Yeah ok I admit even I can flip the
        pages of a book that fast. My main argument is still this one: Of all
        those people (you'll easily find lots of reports of many people
        achieving things like that), why does not a single one of them ever go
        to a competition? They would completely SHATTER the existing world
        records. It'd be like a 10 meters tall basketball player in the NBA. Ok
        I don't have current world records but here's a report from 2001:
        http://www.msoworld.com/Press/Releases/MSO5day3.html It says "46012
        words in a under 21 minutes". And I do believe that. Why? Not because I
        can get even close to that myself or have seen someone else doing it,
        but simply because it was an official and well-known competition. Why
        does this other woman not just go there and beat 21 minutes with 19
        seconds? I mean, hello-o! Why don't *any* of those numerous geniuses go
        there? Don't tell me they're too shy or too decent or whatever. I'll

        unbelievable to me. I mean, I don't believe that she can &gt; read 1390
        words in 1/5th of a second, but I do think it is possible to &gt; take a
        brain photograph of 1390 words in 1/5th of a second, then close &gt;
        your eyes and read back what it says in the photograph. It seems to me
        &gt; that the process of reading is computationally more expensive than
        the &gt; process of merely taking a photograph. In a sense, the process
        of taking &gt; a photograph uses a pre-computed image (thanks universe)
        which is simply &gt; projected into your memory, while the process of
        reading involves a huge &gt; amount of analysis to determine the
        meaning/sense. Many people do find &gt; that they can stare at a
        picture, close their eyes and -- for a short &gt; moment -- see an
        impression of the picture in their mind's eye, without &gt; much
        computational effort at all. &gt; &gt; Then how is it that some people
        can supposedly see the impression &gt; clearer and for longer than
        others? It seems to me that this is because &gt; those people use more
        computational effort looking for the key points &gt; that would help to
        sustain the impression. This may be conscious or &gt; subconscious. &gt;
        &gt; I don't have well developed brain photo skills at all, but I do
        have a &gt; similar ability to make brain recordings of sounds. This was
        developed &gt; from a young age (at a subconscious level), and later, as
        I became more &gt; analytical, I became aware of how my brain was
        actually doing it. &gt; &gt; Relating back to photography vs. reading, I
        discovered I am much better &gt; at hearing than listening. That is, I
        can hear and record a sound signal &gt; instantly, and play it back in
        my head as many times as I wish, but some &gt; times it takes me a while

        The difference is that these people are making outrageous claims. They
        are claiming something like 10 times the world record. To boot, the are
        offering little, if any evidence. Also, they are generally attempting to
        sell a product. I don't know of anyone who can solve a randomly
        scrambled cube in under 1.2 seconds. I don't know of anyone who can run
        a mile in under 20 seconds. I certainly don't know of someone who can
        read 416,00 words per minute. I'm not saying it's impossible for any of
        these to happen (with the exception of the running bit. I'm fairly
        certain that works out to about 180 miles an hour, which is faster than
        human legs could conceivably carry someone.) I'm saying that we should
        be wary until some evidence is offered because the claims are so grand.
        Grand facts require grand scrutiny. Not everyone who challenges the

        This is quite off topic for this group, but anyway :) I dont think you
        can compare the brain with the physical world. We know of ppl that can
        do huge calculations in their head in just seconds, and memorize huge
        wolumes of information that for a normal person seems about as
        impossible as running a 20 second mile. Another point that makes it hard
        for the "photo readers" to compete in a contest is that even tho they
        can "read" the text really fast, they can not recall it instantly, but
        it takes a while for them to process the info. In a contest I guess they
        would be asked questions to check their comprehension of the text right
        after they are done reading. But I have never seen anyone perform these
        tasks, and have never tried to do them myself, so I can't say that they
        are not frauds. I just choose to believe that the human mind in capable
        of much more than we can even imagine, so why should we not be able to
        read that fast ? Terje -----Opprinnelig melding----- Fra:

        difference is that these people are making outrageous claims.  They are
        claiming something like 10 times the world record.  To boot, the are
        offering little, if any evidence.  Also, they are generally attempting
        to sell a product. I don't know of anyone who can solve a randomly
        scrambled cube in under 1.2 seconds.  I don't know of anyone who can run
        a mile in under 20 seconds.  I certainly don't know of someone who can
        read 416,00 words per minute.  I'm not saying it's impossible for any of
        these to happen (with the exception of the running bit.  I'm fairly
        certain that works out to about 180 miles an hour, which is faster than
        human legs could conceivably carry someone.)  I'm saying that we should
        be wary until some evidence is offered because the claims are so grand. 
        Grand facts require grand scrutiny. Not everyone who challenges the
        normally accepted 'records' for something should be regarded as a
        fraud.  However, certain people, the ones attempting to sell a product,

        The first thing that came to my mind after reading about this was that
        something seems strange. How much does a "popular" actor pull in these
        days, anywhere between 1  30 million dollars? And how much do these
        movie companies sink into special effects and special training for the
        actors? I find it odd that with all those large dollar bills being
        thrown around that they couldn't just fly Chris (or someone of equal
        proficiency) out to San Fran. How much does a plane ticket cost, less
        than $1000? Don't get me wrong, I am not saying it is a sham, I am found
        it to be odd. If they really wanted to make the scene entertaining, get
        Macky to do his 23 second one-handed solve. -Dave

        that responds when you issue scramble requests in the chat session, and
        when you announce your result, the times are stored in a database that
        can be queried with other chat commands. My suggestion would be to write
        a program that is a combination JNetCube/IRC client that lets people
        chat on this channel, has buttons to issue scramble requests to
        Alexander's program, and automatically announces the time results to the
        channel when the user accepts the results. This method would have the
        advantage that it also allows interaction with other cubers who can
        chat, but can't run the JNetCube timer (maybe because they are using
        Stackmat timers instead).

        Thanks, you exactly described what I meant and why it can't be compared.
        You just draw a different conclusion. The point is that those people
        claim to record a huge amount of data in extremely short time. You do
        something different, you don't record a huge amount, you record very
        precisely. I might be able to read a full page of text in 50 short
        looks, but I need to look at different points, like one line each look.
        I don't think I can "read" a full page by shortly staring at the whole
        page 50 times. But in your sound example you surely meant hearing the
        *same* sound 50 times, not 50 different sounds, right? The resolution
        difference, time vs space, is exactly what I meant. What makes your
        ability not similar. Stefan --- In

        fragment of sound after only 1 hearing. I'm &gt; sure that after 50
        hearings of a 1 second recording of 1000 spoken &gt; words, you would
        not pick up one single word. Do you understand? &gt; &gt; Give me 1
        second of natural spoken English, and I can remember every &gt;
        inflection, tone, overtone, rhythm that I can reasonably hear at that

        of &gt; intrumentation and their precise(*) expression in terms of their
        tone, &gt; texture, and delayed timing. &gt; &gt; So, it is quite
        reasonable to me that if I can hear+record in one &gt; hearing what
        others can hear+record in 50 hearings, then some people can &gt; quite
        likely see+record in one look what others can see+record in 50 &gt;
        looks. &gt; &gt; I'm exiting this conversation now. Please Google
        eidetic memory if you &gt; want to find evidence more to your liking.
        &gt; &gt; (*) Regarding the word "precise", this does not mean "exact",
        of course. &gt; I can hear/record to a high level of precision, but not

        Out of the many many people with claimed outstanding abilities, there
        should be at least one who wants to prove it. And the mind olympics are
        well-known. Guiness World Records are even more well-known. And the
        people often write how they broke a world record. But ok, maybe they're
        really all shy and just the inventors want media focus. Then why on
        earth don't these inventors prove it in official competitions? They
        surely know about them and they surely would benefit, no? And usually
        the inventors claim huge achievements for themselves, too. So why don't
        at least those guys prove it? Wikipedia has a short article on eidetic
        memory: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory I guess I like
        Marvin Minsky now :-). The Guiness world records mentioned are something
        completely different, they're much less extreme and they can be
        explained. There are systems that anyone can learn and train to do
        similar things with enough time and mor importantly motivation. Stefan

        speed reading (was: J Bernett Orlando &gt; &gt; You guys make it sound
        like it's the most normal thing in the world. &gt; Can you do it? Has
        someone demonstrated it to you? If so, please share &gt; some details.
        &gt; &gt; I just found another article: &gt;
        http://www.execuread.com/press_media.htm &gt; &gt; Quote: &gt; "[...]
        read a 30 000 word book about Albert Einstein in 12s. Following &gt;
        that, she wrote a comprehension test and scored 95%." &gt; &gt;
        Depending on the book layout, that might be about 10 pages per second.
        &gt; Yeah ok I admit even I can flip the pages of a book that fast. &gt;
        &gt; My main argument is still this one: Of all those people (you'll
        easily &gt; find lots of reports of many people achieving things like
        that), why &gt; does not a single one of them ever go to a competition?
        They would &gt; completely SHATTER the existing world records. It'd be
        like a 10 &gt; meters tall basketball player in the NBA. &gt; &gt; Ok I
        don't have current world records but here's a report from 2001: &gt;
        http://www.msoworld.com/Press/Releases/MSO5day3.html &gt; &gt; It says
        "46012 words in a under 21 minutes". And I do believe that. &gt; Why?
        Not because I can get even close to that myself or have seen &gt;
        someone else doing it, but simply because it was an official and &gt;
        well-known competition. Why does this other woman not just go there &gt;
        and beat 21 minutes with 19 seconds? I mean, hello-o! Why don't *any*
        &gt; of those numerous geniuses go there? Don't tell me they're too shy
        or &gt; too decent or whatever. I'll tell you why: cause they're too
        lying. &gt; &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        &gt; you have "seen", so in a short time you will remember and
        comprehend &gt; &gt; about as much as a person that read the text in
        "normal" speed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So when someone "read" 1390 words in
        1/5 of a second, they do in &gt; fact &gt; &gt; take a brain photagraph,
        but the brain process the info as well, so &gt; a &gt; &gt; person with
        very good skills will remember the info "scanned", not &gt; &gt; reading

        the fact that she can read 1390 words in a fifth &gt; of &gt; &gt; a
        second, does not mean that she can read or comprehend 416,250 &gt; words
        a &gt; &gt; minute. Even if Afasa Powell ran 100 meter in 9.77 seconds,
        he can &gt; not &gt; &gt; run 10000 meter in 977 seconds. Even the brain

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, gotta admit I found the explanation. They made a
        test and she &gt; read &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1390 words in a fifth of
        a second. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not so unbelievable to me. I mean,
        I don't believe that she &gt; can &gt; &gt; read 1390 words in 1/5th of
        a second, but I do think it is possible &gt; to &gt; &gt; take a brain
        photograph of 1390 words in 1/5th of a second, then &gt; close &gt; &gt;
        your eyes and read back what it says in the photograph. It seems to &gt;
        me &gt; &gt; that the process of reading is computationally more
        expensive than &gt; the &gt; &gt; process of merely taking a photograph.
        In a sense, the process of &gt; taking &gt; &gt; a photograph uses a
        pre-computed image (thanks universe) which is &gt; simply &gt; &gt;
        projected into your memory, while the process of reading involves a &gt;
        huge &gt; &gt; amount of analysis to determine the meaning/sense. Many
        people do &gt; find &gt; &gt; that they can stare at a picture, close
        their eyes and -- for a &gt; short &gt; &gt; moment -- see an impression
        of the picture in their mind's eye, &gt; without &gt; &gt; much
        computational effort at all. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then how is it that
        some people can supposedly see the impression &gt; &gt; clearer and for
        longer than others? It seems to me that this is &gt; because &gt; &gt;
        those people use more computational effort looking for the key &gt;
        points &gt; &gt; that would help to sustain the impression. This may be
        conscious or &gt; &gt; subconscious. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't have
        well developed brain photo skills at all, but I do have &gt; a &gt; &gt;
        similar ability to make brain recordings of sounds. This was &gt;
        developed &gt; &gt; from a young age (at a subconscious level), and
        later, as I became &gt; more &gt; &gt; analytical, I became aware of how
        my brain was actually doing it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Relating back to
        photography vs. reading, I discovered I am much &gt; better &gt; &gt; at
        hearing than listening. That is, I can hear and record a sound &gt;
        signal &gt; &gt; instantly, and play it back in my head as many times as
        I wish, but &gt; some &gt; &gt; times it takes me a while to analyse the
        sound and realise that &gt; someone &gt; &gt; is trying to talk to me

        Similarly, that you can only flip edges in pairs, &gt; and the similar
        things with corners. &gt; From experience, I know this to be true, but
        I'd like to see it &gt; worked proofed somehow. &gt; &gt; Thanks! &gt;
        Daniel The idea is that you look what the effect of a single move is. On
        the 3x3x3 cube there is one move (a face turned clockwise by 90 degrees)
        which we can say all moves consist of. Now, the effect of this move is
        to do an edge 4-cycle and a corner 4-cycle. Let the edges be 1, 2, 3, 4
        and the corners be 1', 2', 3', 4'. If we start from the position (1, 2,
        3, 4) and similarly for the corners, we get (4, 1, 2, 3) which is an odd
        permutation (i.e. we get to the solved position by doing an odd number
        of two pieces swaps). The corners will be in an odd permutation too.
        Now, since the starting position is obviously an even permutation, we
        see that performing one move will change the parity of the permutation
        of the edges. So it will also change the parity of the permutation of
        the corners. Overall, the permutation will be even. So the permutation
        of any position on the cube will be even. Since the position which we
        want to get to, that with two edges swapped, has an odd permutation, it
        is impossible to get to it. Same thing with the orientation. It's easy
        to define the orientation of pieces, and then we will just notice that
        no move changes the parity of the orientation. And since one switched
        piece means there is an odd orientation, than we see that this is
        impossible too. Sorry for the length. Sebastian

        Daniel Hi Daniel, The parity problem is caused by the centers only
        rotating in place, and never switching. The cube only allows 4 centers
        or 6 centers to move evenly (that is, in multiples of two turns) in
        relation to an otherwise solved cube. This even numbered limitation is
        shown, for example, by the cube not allowing only the centers of the
        slice between the Up and Down sides to move one turn to the right, in an
        otherwise solved cube. Regards, David J

        &gt;&gt; completely SHATTER the existing world records. It'd be like a
        10 &gt;&gt; meters tall basketball player in the NBA. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
        Ok I don't have current world records but here's a report from 2001:
        &gt;&gt; http://www.msoworld.com/Press/Releases/MSO5day3.html &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; It says "46012 words in a under 21 minutes". And I do believe
        that. &gt;&gt; Why? Not because I can get even close to that myself or
        have seen &gt;&gt; someone else doing it, but simply because it was an
        official and &gt;&gt; well-known competition. Why does this other woman
        not just go there &gt;&gt; and beat 21 minutes with 19 seconds? I mean,
        hello-o! Why don't &gt; *any* &gt;&gt; of those numerous geniuses go
        there? Don't tell me they're too shy &gt; or &gt;&gt; too decent or
        whatever. I'll tell you why: cause they're too lying. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;

        about how it was measured? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, gotta
        admit I found the explanation. They made a test and &gt; she &gt;&gt;
        read &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1390 words in a fifth of a second.
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This is not so unbelievable to me. I mean, I
        don't believe that &gt; she &gt;&gt; can &gt;&gt;&gt; read 1390 words in
        1/5th of a second, but I do think it is &gt; possible &gt;&gt; to
        &gt;&gt;&gt; take a brain photograph of 1390 words in 1/5th of a second,
        then &gt;&gt; close &gt;&gt;&gt; your eyes and read back what it says in
        the photograph. It seems &gt; to &gt;&gt; me &gt;&gt;&gt; that the
        process of reading is computationally more expensive than &gt;&gt; the
        &gt;&gt;&gt; process of merely taking a photograph. In a sense, the
        process of &gt;&gt; taking &gt;&gt;&gt; a photograph uses a pre-computed
        image (thanks universe) which is &gt;&gt; simply &gt;&gt;&gt; projected
        into your memory, while the process of reading involves &gt; a &gt;&gt;
        huge &gt;&gt;&gt; amount of analysis to determine the meaning/sense.
        Many people do &gt;&gt; find &gt;&gt;&gt; that they can stare at a
        picture, close their eyes and -- for a &gt;&gt; short &gt;&gt;&gt;
        moment -- see an impression of the picture in their mind's eye, &gt;&gt;
        without &gt;&gt;&gt; much computational effort at all. &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Then how is it that some people can supposedly see the
        impression &gt;&gt;&gt; clearer and for longer than others? It seems to
        me that this is &gt;&gt; because &gt;&gt;&gt; those people use more
        computational effort looking for the key &gt;&gt; points &gt;&gt;&gt;
        that would help to sustain the impression. This may be conscious &gt; or
        &gt;&gt;&gt; subconscious. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don't have well
        developed brain photo skills at all, but I do &gt; have &gt;&gt; a
        &gt;&gt;&gt; similar ability to make brain recordings of sounds. This
        was &gt;&gt; developed &gt;&gt;&gt; from a young age (at a subconscious
        level), and later, as I became &gt;&gt; more &gt;&gt;&gt; analytical, I
        became aware of how my brain was actually doing it. &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Relating back to photography vs. reading, I discovered I am
        much &gt;&gt; better &gt;&gt;&gt; at hearing than listening. That is, I
        can hear and record a sound &gt;&gt; signal &gt;&gt;&gt; instantly, and
        play it back in my head as many times as I wish, &gt; but &gt;&gt; some
        &gt;&gt;&gt; times it takes me a while to analyse the sound and realise
        that &gt;&gt; someone &gt;&gt;&gt; is trying to talk to me :-)

        Well, first off, there are many "equally proficient" cubers out in the
        SF area... say LarsP or Tyson (DanK used to live there). I don't think
        the point is to do something as entertaining/extravegant as possible,
        they probably just want to follow the script as close as possible. Also,
        who says they wouldn't be willing to fly someone in from afar. The
        letter was from Patrick, and it sounded to me like they just wanted SF
        area for convience of all parties. Plane ticket like that would cost
        less then $500 round trip actually so that was a gross over-estimate. I
        don't find anything odd about the whole deal. Unless the actor has small
        slender (and perhaps Asian) hands, I don't think they would want Macky.
        If I was directing, I would want a hand-double reasonably close to the
        actor's as my top priority, not looking for speed. I'm sure any cuber
        under 35s can show off mad deterity/speed if they really wanted to and a
        scene/cube was setup for it. Don't assume they are looking for that much
        authenticity... -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        is the one who solves the cube in the movie Mindhunters. Just check the
        news item of July 26, 2004 on my site. He was in a camper all day with
        several big names, like LL Cool J and Val Kilmer. Check out, he is even
        mentioned on imdb.com as the hand- double.

        JNetCube is the only non-browser timer I can use, being on a mac, and

        my cube to school and solved it in 35 or so seconds. some girl told me

        disregarded it, thinking they didn't know anything. but it happened
        again, at least 2 more times. well one day i finally met up with this

        themselves, too. So why don't at least those guys prove it? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Wikipedia has a short article on eidetic memory: &gt; &gt;
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory &gt; &gt; I guess I like
        Marvin Minsky now :-). The Guiness world records &gt; &gt; mentioned are
        something completely different, they're much less &gt; &gt; extreme and
        they can be explained. There are systems that anyone can &gt; &gt; learn
        and train to do similar things with enough time and mor &gt; &gt;
        importantly motivation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        P.S. Too bad news24.com must have deleted the article I mentioned &gt;
        &gt; (http://www.execuread.com/press_media.htm), I would've liked to see
        it &gt; &gt; there. They do have older articles in their archives. I
        wonder why &gt; &gt; they deleted that one. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt;&gt; You guys make it sound like it's the most normal thing in the
        world. &gt; &gt;&gt; Can you do it? Has someone demonstrated it to you?
        If so, please &gt; &gt; share &gt; &gt;&gt; some details. &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; I just found another article: &gt; &gt;&gt;
        http://www.execuread.com/press_media.htm &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        Quote: &gt; &gt;&gt; "[...] read a 30 000 word book about Albert
        Einstein in 12s. &gt; &gt; Following &gt; &gt;&gt; that, she wrote a
        comprehension test and scored 95%." &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        Depending on the book layout, that might be about 10 pages per &gt; &gt;
        second. &gt; &gt;&gt; Yeah ok I admit even I can flip the pages of a
        book that fast. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; My main argument is still
        this one: Of all those people (you'll &gt; &gt; easily &gt; &gt;&gt;
        find lots of reports of many people achieving things like that), why
        &gt; &gt;&gt; does not a single one of them ever go to a competition?
        They would &gt; &gt;&gt; completely SHATTER the existing world records.
        It'd be like a 10 &gt; &gt;&gt; meters tall basketball player in the
        NBA. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Ok I don't have current world records
        but here's a report from 2001: &gt; &gt;&gt;
        http://www.msoworld.com/Press/Releases/MSO5day3.html &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; It says "46012 words in a under 21 minutes". And I do believe
        that. &gt; &gt;&gt; Why? Not because I can get even close to that myself
        or have seen &gt; &gt;&gt; someone else doing it, but simply because it
        was an official and &gt; &gt;&gt; well-known competition. Why does this
        other woman not just go there &gt; &gt;&gt; and beat 21 minutes with 19
        seconds? I mean, hello-o! Why don't &gt; &gt; *any* &gt; &gt;&gt; of
        those numerous geniuses go there? Don't tell me they're too shy &gt;
        &gt; or &gt; &gt;&gt; too decent or whatever. I'll tell you why: cause
        they're too lying. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Stefan &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;

        much instantly, but your brain will process &gt; &gt;&gt; what &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; you have "seen", so in a short time you will remember and
        &gt; &gt; comprehend &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; about as much as a person that
        read the text in "normal" speed. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So
        when someone "read" 1390 words in 1/5 of a second, they do in &gt;
        &gt;&gt; fact &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; take a brain photagraph, but the brain

        does not mean that she can read or comprehend 416,250 &gt; &gt;&gt;

        in 977 seconds. Even the brain gets tired, right ? &gt; &gt; : &gt;

        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, gotta admit I found the
        explanation. They made a test and &gt; &gt; she &gt; &gt;&gt; read &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1390 words in a fifth of a second.
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This is not so unbelievable to me. I
        mean, I don't believe that &gt; &gt; she &gt; &gt;&gt; can &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; read 1390 words in 1/5th of a second, but I do think it is
        &gt; &gt; possible &gt; &gt;&gt; to &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; take a brain
        photograph of 1390 words in 1/5th of a second, then &gt; &gt;&gt; close
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; your eyes and read back what it says in the
        photograph. It seems &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt;&gt; me &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        that the process of reading is computationally more expensive than &gt;
        &gt;&gt; the &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; process of merely taking a photograph. In
        a sense, the process of &gt; &gt;&gt; taking &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a
        photograph uses a pre-computed image (thanks universe) which is &gt;
        &gt;&gt; simply &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; projected into your memory, while the
        process of reading involves &gt; &gt; a &gt; &gt;&gt; huge &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; amount of analysis to determine the meaning/sense. Many
        people do &gt; &gt;&gt; find &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that they can stare at a
        picture, close their eyes and -- for a &gt; &gt;&gt; short &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; moment -- see an impression of the picture in their mind's
        eye, &gt; &gt;&gt; without &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; much computational effort
        at all. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Then how is it that some
        people can supposedly see the impression &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; clearer and
        for longer than others? It seems to me that this is &gt; &gt;&gt;
        because &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; those people use more computational effort
        looking for the key &gt; &gt;&gt; points &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that would
        help to sustain the impression. This may be conscious &gt; &gt; or &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; subconscious. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don't
        have well developed brain photo skills at all, but I do &gt; &gt; have
        &gt; &gt;&gt; a &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; similar ability to make brain
        recordings of sounds. This was &gt; &gt;&gt; developed &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        from a young age (at a subconscious level), and later, as I became &gt;
        &gt;&gt; more &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; analytical, I became aware of how my
        brain was actually doing it. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        Relating back to photography vs. reading, I discovered I am much &gt;
        &gt;&gt; better &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; at hearing than listening. That is, I
        can hear and record a sound &gt; &gt;&gt; signal &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        instantly, and play it back in my head as many times as I wish, &gt;
        &gt; but &gt; &gt;&gt; some &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; times it takes me a while
        to analyse the sound and realise that &gt; &gt;&gt; someone &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; is trying to talk to me :-) &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;

        on the practice, since in this case it appears that PK joined the list
        expressly for the purpose of furthering his personal gain, and although

        these 50 million usenet, yahoo, &amp; other groups exist is because

        &gt; Hey everyone, &gt; &gt; I recently received an e-mail from a guy
        Patrick Ludden who needs a &gt; speedcubing coach for an actor in a
        movie being filmed in San Francisco. &gt; &gt; From what he was saying
        the actor is fairly poplar and would want to &gt; "talk tech" with a
        speedcuber to get a feel for it and also for how to &gt; solve the cube
        quickly. &gt; &gt; The solve will be prepared of course and needs to be
        done in &gt; "something like ten quick moves". The scene involves an
        actor in a &gt; cab egged on by a friend to solve the cube, which he
        "does quickly". &gt; &gt; There is also the possibility of using a hands
        double, but it seems &gt; more likely that the actor will do the solve.
        &gt; &gt; I don't want to post this guy's e-mail address publicly, but
        e-mail me &gt; (chris@[nospam]speedcubing.com) if you are available and

        I get that all the time. It's funny that I've never met another
        speedcuber, but everyone I solve it for happens to know someone who can
        do it faster. And their times always happen to be a few seconds faster
        than mine. It gets annoying, but not as annoying as "I solved that once
        when I was a kid... yeah I peeled off the stickers and put them back in

        46012 words in 21 minutes are just over 2000 words a minute, and I

        Bernett Orlando &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You guys make it sound
        like it's the most normal thing in the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; world.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you do it? Has someone demonstrated it to you? If
        so, please &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; share &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some details. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I just
        found another article: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        http://www.execuread.com/press_media.htm &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Quote: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "[...] read a 30 000 word book
        about Albert Einstein in 12s. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Following
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that, she wrote a comprehension test and
        scored 95%." &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Depending on the book
        layout, that might be about 10 pages per &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        second. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah ok I admit even I can flip
        the pages of a book that fast. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My main
        argument is still this one: Of all those people (you'll &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; easily &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find lots of reports
        of many people achieving things like that), &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; why
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does not a single one of them ever go to a competition?
        They would &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; completely SHATTER the existing world
        records. It'd be like a 10 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meters tall basketball
        player in the NBA. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok I don't have
        current world records but here's a report from &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2001:
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.msoworld.com/Press/Releases/MSO5day3.html
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It says "46012 words in a under 21
        minutes". And I do believe that. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why? Not because I can
        get even close to that myself or have seen &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; someone else
        doing it, but simply because it was an official and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        well-known competition. Why does this other woman not just go there
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and beat 21 minutes with 19 seconds? I mean, hello-o!
        Why don't &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; *any* &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of those numerous geniuses go there? Don't tell me
        they're too shy &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; or &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; too decent or whatever. I'll tell you why: cause
        they're too lying. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stefan

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When speedreading in a way where you take in a
        whole page at the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time,
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you will not remember much
        instantly, but your brain will process &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you have
        "seen", so in a short time you will remember and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; comprehend &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about as much
        as a person that read the text in "normal" speed. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So when someone "read" 1390 words in 1/5 of a
        second, they do in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fact
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take a brain photagraph, but the
        brain process the info as well, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; so
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        person with very good skills will remember the info "scanned", not
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reading back from the "scanned" image.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But as Stefan said, the fact
        that she can read 1390 words in a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        fifth &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a second, does not mean that she can read or
        comprehend 416,250 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; words a
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minute. Even if Afasa Powell ran
        100 meter in 9.77 seconds, he can &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        not &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; run 10000 meter in 977
        seconds. Even the brain gets tired, right ? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is not so unbelievable to me. I mean, I don't

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read 1390
        words in 1/5th of a second, but I do think it is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; possible &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take a brain photograph of 1390 words in 1/5th of a
        second, then &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; close
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your eyes and read back what it
        says in the photograph. It seems &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        that the process of reading is computationally more expensive than
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; process of merely taking a photograph. In a sense,
        the process of &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taking
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a photograph uses a pre-computed
        image (thanks universe) which is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        simply &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; projected into your memory,
        while the process of reading involves &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        a &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; huge &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amount of analysis to determine the meaning/sense.
        Many people do &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that they can stare at a picture,
        close their eyes and -- for a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        short &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; moment -- see an impression
        of the picture in their mind's eye, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much
        computational effort at all. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        Then how is it that some people can supposedly see the impression
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clearer and for longer than others? It seems to me
        that this is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those people use more
        computational effort looking for the key &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; points &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that would
        help to sustain the impression. This may be conscious
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; or &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        subconscious. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't have
        well developed brain photo skills at all, but I do &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; have &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; similar ability to make brain recordings of sounds.
        This was &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; developed
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from a young age (at a
        subconscious level), and later, as I became &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; analytical,
        I became aware of how my brain was actually doing it.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Relating back to photography
        vs. reading, I discovered I am much &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at hearing
        than listening. That is, I can hear and record a sound
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; signal &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; instantly, and play it back in my head as many
        times as I wish, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; but &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times it
        takes me a while to analyse the sound and realise that
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; someone &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is trying to talk to me :-) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

        Hey all, This reminds me of a documentary i saw recently, about people
        that could read a bit faster than the average people. I don't know why i
        didn't think of it at first, anyway, it's known to be a very interesting
        and serious show, and they had different guys talking about techniques
        to read faster and still get the meaning of what you read. They didn't
        speak of record-breaking ppl, however, they interviewed an eye scientist
        who showed a very simple trick: knowing that the eye is "slow" (well not
        really slow, but it's not freaking fast either, how long does it take
        you to move the eye, find the word, refocus, move, find, focus, move,
        find, focus etc.)she had a computer in front of her where she displayed
        a single sentence word by word, the words being quite big (something
        like Times New Roman size 40). then you can set about any speed on the
        comp, your eye, even if not reading every word, will record the image of
        the whole thing and you'll understand what you read. this process not
        being so tiring as reading the same amount of words in the same amount
        of time and still being able to undferstand what you read, or if you
        prefer, this is 10 times faster than normal reading when you're fully
        focused on what you read, mostly because the eyes don't move. Of course
        looking at a screen for a long time is tiring... I'm not saying I
        believe these records, I just say that using this technique, there's a
        way to read a lot faster and you can even count the number of words.
        Being focused on a computer for 10s isn't that hard, then you multiply
        by 6 and you get your "number of words/minute average"... If anyone has
        already said something in that direction and I'm only resaying what's
        already been said, please forgive me, I haven't been following the
        discussion very actively... Francois Stefan Pochmann
        &lt;pochmann@...&gt; a écrit : Thanks, you exactly described what I
        meant and why it can't be compared. You just draw a different
        conclusion. The point is that those people claim to record a huge amount
        of data in extremely short time. You do something different, you don't
        record a huge amount, you record very precisely. I might be able to read
        a full page of text in 50 short looks, but I need to look at different
        points, like one line each look. I don't think I can "read" a full page
        by shortly staring at the whole page 50 times. But in your sound example
        you surely meant hearing the *same* sound 50 times, not 50 different
        sounds, right? The resolution difference, time vs space, is exactly what
        I meant. What makes your ability not similar. Stefan --- In

        mean you can &gt; &gt; record the sound of 1000 words in a second. &gt;
        &gt; Not at all. If you take a page of 1000 words and reduce its size by
        200 &gt; times, the naked human eye cannot physically sense all of the
        light &gt; information required to actually see words. &gt; &gt; The
        resolution of sound, on the other hand, is in time, not space. After
        &gt; compressing 200 seconds worth of sound down to just 1 second, you
        are &gt; unreasonably expecting that I be able to hear everything as if
        it were &gt; at normal resolution. &gt; &gt; No, what I'm saying is that
        if a normal person is able to hear 100 &gt; details about a fragment of
        sound after 50 hearings, I can hear those &gt; same 100 details about a
        fragment of sound after only 1 hearing. I'm &gt; sure that after 50
        hearings of a 1 second recording of 1000 spoken &gt; words, you would
        not pick up one single word. Do you understand? &gt; &gt; Give me 1
        second of natural spoken English, and I can remember every &gt;
        inflection, tone, overtone, rhythm that I can reasonably hear at that
        &gt; resolution, as if I am making an audio recording. Give me, say, 15
        &gt; seconds of some music, and I will hear and remember not only the
        &gt; "simple" information like the melody and rhythm, but all the layers
        of &gt; intrumentation and their precise(*) expression in terms of their
        tone, &gt; texture, and delayed timing. &gt; &gt; So, it is quite
        reasonable to me that if I can hear+record in one &gt; hearing what
        others can hear+record in 50 hearings, then some people can &gt; quite
        likely see+record in one look what others can see+record in 50 &gt;
        looks. &gt; &gt; I'm exiting this conversation now. Please Google
        eidetic memory if you &gt; want to find evidence more to your liking.
        &gt; &gt; (*) Regarding the word "precise", this does not mean "exact",
        of course. &gt; I can hear/record to a high level of precision, but not
        a perfect one. &gt; Memory, and even sensory input, is always an
        approximation of the real &gt; world. &gt; &gt; Ryan

        impossible to twists any corner. If the answer is 'yes', then the
        problem is to determine which corners that are twisted clockwise and
        which corners that are twisted anti- clockwise. The central issue is how
        to determine if a corner is twisted or not when the corner piece is not

        absolute terms, but that you need to have some kind of reference frame.
        The edges pose not the same problem since we can define that each single

        The problem is that the !alg and !time commands are handled by
        Alexander's IRC client, so he has to be logged in in order for it to
        work. So, if you were to use this approach in your program, that's an

        Hi Chris, I'd like it to talk, of course, like my timer :) Some might
        think this is just for fun, but it started out because I want to know
        how far I am in my solution without having to look at the clock/timer.
        And it works. You could also implement the metronome as a simpler
        feature, and make it configurable, so 'beep every x seconds'. I am
        working for Dan Harris on an automated version of his profiles section.
        It's almost ready. If you like to connect your program to the profiles I
        am willing to cooperate. E.g. automatically show profile information
        downloaded from my database. Otherwise you'll end up storing all that
        information twice. It would be nice to see a picture of the one(s) you
        are racing against. If you want details of how to connect to my
        database, let me know in private email (blonkm[at]gmail[dot]com) Michiel

        Ell+CLL seems like a viable solution, because the second step can be
        completed using simple corner commutators that are generally very fast.
        Ryan Heise's method includes this, I believe. It's just done
        intuitively, instead of as a defined set of algorithms. -Mike Bennett
        P.S. I'm curious what the approximate move count would be for a method

        Ya, I hate it when that happens. What I do is ask for a name, and since
        I know most of the cubers names on top 200 lists, I can verify or deny
        it pretty quickly. Sure lots of times it's fake or an exaggeration. But
        (as I have recently found out) there is truth to some of these claims. I
        mean, just think, I've been seen in public cubing at this university by
        lots of people. Now when they see some newbie sub-1min cuber, they are
        going to mention me (or some faint memory of a guy cubing on campus).
        Similarly, I've heard stories about a cuber here, and had been denying
        it, but it seems like there are other cubers at my school. Who's to say
        DanK or JonM, didn't walk through the Detroit airport one day and one of
        the people watching me cube didn't see such a feat already. So now I'm
        pretty open to the idea that news of cubing travels fast; that it's more
        likely than I had originally expected for an individual too run into
        another cuber. You say you've never meant another speedcuber in real
        life, right? Well maybe you should try to seek some out in your area.
        Open your eyes, there are speedcubers lurking in every corner of the
        world and in basically every (technical) profession. Heck, just give
        your location. Might get some hits on this fourm... I'm from Ann Arbor,
        MI... I occasioanlly stop by places kinda far off from home and cube
        there. Such as Saginaw and Kalamazoo... so some poor cuber out in those
        places are going to deny sightings of me undoubtedly, lol. There are at
        least 7 cubers I've meant in/from MI, 4 or 5 faster than me in fact.
        Three national or international record holders are from MI. This doesn't
        even cout the ones I've heard about but haven't meant in person. Look
        around, you'll be suprised to actually see cubers faster than you
        around. -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, Bryan Mytko

        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I just found another
        article: &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.execuread.com/press_media.htm
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Quote: &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        "[...] read a 30 000 word book about Albert Einstein in 12s. &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Following &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that, she wrote a comprehension test and scored 95%."
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Depending on the book
        layout, that might be about 10 pages per &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; second. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah ok I
        admit even I can flip the pages of a book that fast. &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My main argument is still this
        one: Of all those people (you'll &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        easily &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find lots of reports of
        many people achieving things like that), &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; why &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does not a single one of them ever go to a competition?
        They would &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; completely SHATTER the existing world
        records. It'd be like a 10 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meters tall basketball
        player in the NBA. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok I
        don't have current world records but here's a report from &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2001: &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        http://www.msoworld.com/Press/Releases/MSO5day3.html &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It says "46012 words in a under
        21 minutes". And I do believe that. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why? Not
        because I can get even close to that myself or have seen &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; someone else doing it, but simply because it was an
        official and &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; well-known competition. Why does this
        other woman not just go there &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and beat 21 minutes

        &gt;&gt;&gt; *any* &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of those

        read the text in "normal" speed. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So when someone "read" 1390 words in 1/5 of a

        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take a brain photagraph,

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; person with very good skills

        back from the "scanned" image. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;

        words in a &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; fifth &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a second, does not mean that she can read or
        comprehend 416,250 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; words
        a &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minute. Even if Afasa

        read 1390 words in 1/5th of a second, but I do think it is &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; possible &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take
        a brain photograph of 1390 words in 1/5th of a second, then &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; close &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your eyes and read back what it says in the
        photograph. It seems &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the process of reading is computationally more
        expensive than &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; process of merely taking a
        photograph. In a sense, the process of &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taking &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        a photograph uses a pre-computed image (thanks universe) which is &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simply &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; projected into your memory, while the process
        of reading involves &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; huge &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amount of analysis to determine the meaning/sense.
        Many people do &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that they can stare at a
        picture, close their eyes and -- for a &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        moment -- see an impression of the picture in their mind's eye, &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much computational effort at all. &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then how is it that some
        people can supposedly see the impression &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        clearer and for longer than others? It seems to me that this is &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those people use more computational effort
        looking for the key &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        points &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that would help
        to sustain the impression. This may be conscious &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; or &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subconscious. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't have well developed brain photo skills at
        all, but I do &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; have &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; similar ability to make brain recordings of sounds.
        This was &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; developed &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from a young age (at a
        subconscious level), and later, as I became &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; analytical, I became aware of how my brain was
        actually doing it. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        Relating back to photography vs. reading, I discovered I am much &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at hearing than listening. That is, I can hear
        and record a sound &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        signal &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; instantly, and
        play it back in my head as many times as I wish, &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; but &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        times it takes me a while to analyse the sound and realise that &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; someone &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is trying to talk to me :-) &gt;

        Oh I'm sure it does, he is/was cooking up some pretty advanced stuff as
        I recall.... I'm curious though, and not sure what exactly you mean.
        Could you cite an example? when no corner is in correct permutation
        relative to the edges specifically. Cuz to move and twist 4 corners
        sounds like a lot to me. Or even an example of doing this intuitively...
        I'm very good at computing things like that, I'll have to go back and
        find your post. I used to do (weighted) move count averages and case
        counts for this group regularly. My specialty is case counting (in

        Well it wouldn't be the Fridrich method if you don't OLL then PLL...
        &gt; &gt; OLL first (41): 9.22 turn average &gt; PLL second (14): 11.21
        turn average &gt; &gt; CLL first (25): 9.18 &gt; ELL second (19): 11.27
        &gt; &gt; ELL first (13): 7.87 &gt; CLL second (42): 11.73 &gt; &gt; Of
        course these are in face turn metric. I counted the solved case &gt; for
        each case count in parentheses. Also you should account for an &gt;
        extra .75 turns based on the 75% chance of having to do an little &gt;
        post-adjust of the LL in the end. &gt; &gt; Now I've been a CLL/ELL user
        for a long time. Not sure if anyone in &gt; the world would do ELL/CLL,
        at least I've never heard of it. &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug Li &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Haha... given that the human pupil is .5 cm, the angular resolving power
        means you can read resolve how many words per line. I could totally
        figure this out, as it's my life as an astronomer, but I don't feel like

        you take a page of 1000 words and reduce its size by &gt; 200 &gt;&gt;
        times, the naked human eye cannot physically sense all of the light

        The resolution of sound, on the other hand, is in time, not space. &gt;
        After &gt;&gt; compressing 200 seconds worth of sound down to just 1
        second, you &gt; are &gt;&gt; unreasonably expecting that I be able to
        hear everything as if it &gt; were &gt;&gt; at normal resolution.
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; No, what I'm saying is that if a normal person is able
        to hear 100 &gt;&gt; details about a fragment of sound after 50
        hearings, I can hear &gt; those &gt;&gt; same 100 details about a
        fragment of sound after only 1 hearing. I'm &gt;&gt; sure that after 50
        hearings of a 1 second recording of 1000 spoken &gt;&gt; words, you
        would not pick up one single word. Do you understand? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
        Give me 1 second of natural spoken English, and I can remember every
        &gt;&gt; inflection, tone, overtone, rhythm that I can reasonably hear
        at &gt; that &gt;&gt; resolution, as if I am making an audio recording.
        Give me, say, 15 &gt;&gt; seconds of some music, and I will hear and
        remember not only the &gt;&gt; "simple" information like the melody and
        rhythm, but all the layers &gt; of &gt;&gt; intrumentation and their
        precise(*) expression in terms of their &gt; tone, &gt;&gt; texture, and
        delayed timing. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So, it is quite reasonable to me that
        if I can hear+record in one &gt;&gt; hearing what others can hear+record
        in 50 hearings, then some people &gt; can &gt;&gt; quite likely
        see+record in one look what others can see+record in 50 &gt;&gt; looks.

        from its normal resolution of 200 seconds down to 1 second. This
        resolution is too compacted for any human to perceive. To make a fair
        comparison, you should also shrink the size of the page of written text
        by 200 times as well. Then we are both handicapped in the same way.
        Relative to their respective normals, I have compared two people as

        think I can "read" a full page by shortly staring at the whole page 50
        &gt; times. Without being aware of it, your mind has been trained to
        focus on a small part of the page and ignore the rest of it. This is the
        way you learn to read. First of all, they teach you to focus on one
        letter at a time. After your brain learns how to automatically translate
        the image of that letter into the letter itself, you learn how to focus
        on a whole word and recognise the image of the whole word as the word
        itself. After that, most people learn on their own how to recognise two
        or three words in one go, and by necessity, only learn to expand their
        focus horizontally (for horizontally flowing languages), or vertically
        (for vertically flowing languages). This process happens automatically
        whenever you see something that can be interpreted as written words, and
        it is quite difficult to override this training. However, it is easy to
        rediscover how broadly your eyes can really focus when you stare at a
        block of text written in a different language. For example, please take
        a look at the table of Korean symbols on the following page:
        http://www.wam.umd.edu/~stwright/korean/korean-linguistics-origins.html
        Since the meaning of these symbols is not registering with you as
        written English, your mind is allowing you to focus normally and you can
        take in the whole image quite easily. However, if you try to learn how
        to read the Korean language, you will again train your mind to focus on
        each individual character, and you will ignore the rest of what's on the
        page. When I began learning the Korean language, I experienced exactly
        that: although I knew my eye could easily capture an entire Korean word
        with clarity, I could not stare at a whole Korean word and recognise it.
        Instead, I had to stare at each character individually until I had read
        through the whole word. Apart from this, there is a limit to how much
        you can focus on with clarity, but I am not about to guess at what the
        limit is. The more peripheral your vision, the less clear it is. When
        you look at something, your eyes automatically wander around to grab the
        full picture. Do you know if she is not allowed to move her eyes within
        that one second? One second seems like ample time to easily see the
        whole page. To me, "seeing" the whole page in 1 second is not the real
        feat. The real feat is being able to sustain the impression of that
        image in your mind for a long period of time. Please refer to my
        original email for an idea of how I do this for sound. &gt; But in your
        sound example you surely meant hearing the *same* sound 50 &gt; times,
        not 50 different sounds, right? Well, if you were to listen to a length
        of sound with the aim of memorising it, you would listen to it several
        times, focussing on a different portion each time and ignoring the rest.
        Possibly you would take in relatively small portions at a time, whereas
        I would take in relatively large chunks of sound as one unit. By
        portion, I do not mean just timewise, but also depthwise. For example,
        if you were able to demonstrate to me that you could listen to a whole
        10 second fragment of music in one hearing and remember the entire
        melody, I would point out that you have only remembered one portion of
        the sound; There are also the drums, the guitar, bass guitar, keyboard
        (which is very dense in that it can involve chords with 6 or 7 parts
        played simultaneously), vocal parts and more, as well as the finer
        subtle points such as "how" the vocalists expressed each word (e.g.
        there are an infinite many ways to say a particular word), how the bass
        player attacked the 29th note in the bassline, etc. There is a lot of
        data in here, which I can pick up in one hearing, like an audio
        recording, but not quite that precise. I don't really know how to
        convince you that it is a huge amount of data that I am hearing, since
        fewer people really care about hearing than they do about looking. I
        mean, it seems most would prefer to have visual rather than audio
        eidetic memory, and thus it is easy to diminish the latter ability
        relative to the former. After all, it is fair enough to say that more of
        the brain is devoted to vision than hearing, and that people depend more
        on vision than hearing. Ryan

        it, let alone speed solve it. I do know other cubers around my area,
        most of which are my friends who have gotten into it from each other. I
        was talking more about random occurrences, and how someone always has a
        friend who can solve it in 15 seconds, yet that friend is always somehow
        unreachable, and the fact that I never bump into one of those people's
        friends. I'm in New York by the way... anyone else on here from NY?

        times it's fake or an exaggeration. But (as I have &gt; recently found
        out) there is truth to some of these claims. &gt; &gt; I mean, just
        think, I've been seen in public cubing at this &gt; university by lots
        of people. Now when they see some newbie sub-1min &gt; cuber, they are
        going to mention me (or some faint memory of a guy &gt; cubing on
        campus). Similarly, I've heard stories about a cuber here, &gt; and had
        been denying it, but it seems like there are other cubers at &gt; my
        school. &gt; &gt; Who's to say DanK or JonM, didn't walk through the
        Detroit airport &gt; one day and one of the people watching me cube
        didn't see such a &gt; feat already. &gt; &gt; So now I'm pretty open to
        the idea that news of cubing travels fast; &gt; that it's more likely
        than I had originally expected for an &gt; individual too run into
        another cuber. &gt; &gt; You say you've never meant another speedcuber
        in real life, right? &gt; Well maybe you should try to seek some out in
        your area. &gt; &gt; Open your eyes, there are speedcubers lurking in
        every corner of the &gt; world and in basically every (technical)
        profession. &gt; &gt; Heck, just give your location. Might get some hits
        on this fourm... &gt; &gt; I'm from Ann Arbor, MI... I occasioanlly stop
        by places kinda far &gt; off from home and cube there. Such as Saginaw
        and Kalamazoo... so &gt; some poor cuber out in those places are going
        to deny sightings of &gt; me undoubtedly, lol. There are at least 7
        cubers I've meant in/from &gt; MI, 4 or 5 faster than me in fact. Three
        national or international &gt; record holders are from MI. This doesn't
        even cout the ones I've &gt; heard about but haven't meant in person.
        &gt; &gt; Look around, you'll be suprised to actually see cubers faster
        than &gt; you around. &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some details. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I just found another article: &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.execuread.com/press_media.htm &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Quote: &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "[...] read a 30 000 word book about Albert Einstein in
        12s. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Following &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that, she wrote a
        comprehension test and scored 95%." &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Depending on the book layout, that might be about 10
        pages per &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; second. &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah ok I admit even I can
        flip the pages of a book that fast. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My main argument is still this one: Of all those people
        &gt; (you'll &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; easily
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find lots of reports
        of many people achieving things like &gt; that), &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; why &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does not a single one of
        them ever go to a competition? They &gt; would &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; completely SHATTER the existing world records. It'd be
        like a &gt; 10 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meters tall basketball player
        in the NBA. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok I
        don't have current world records but here's a report &gt; from &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2001: &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        http://www.msoworld.com/Press/Releases/MSO5day3.html &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It says "46012 words in a
        under 21 minutes". And I do believe &gt; that. &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why? Not because I can get even close to that myself or
        have &gt; seen &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; someone else doing it, but
        simply because it was an official &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        well-known competition. Why does this other woman not just go &gt; there
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and beat 21 minutes with 19 seconds? I mean,
        hello-o! Why &gt; don't &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; *any* &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
        those numerous geniuses go there? Don't tell me they're &gt; too shy
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; or &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; too decent or whatever. I'll

        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mention any details about how it
        was measured? &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, gotta
        admit I found the explanation. They made a test &gt; and &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; she &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1390 words in a fifth of a second. &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is not so unbelievable to me. I mean, I don't
        believe &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        she &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read 1390 words in 1/5th
        of a second, but I do think it is &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; possible &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take a brain photograph of 1390 words in 1/5th of a
        second, &gt; then &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; close &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your eyes and read back what it says in the
        photograph. It &gt; seems &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the
        process of reading is computationally more &gt; expensive than &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; process of merely taking
        a photograph. In a sense, the &gt; process of &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taking &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a photograph uses a
        pre-computed image (thanks universe) &gt; which is &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simply &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; projected into your
        memory, while the process of reading &gt; involves &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; huge &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amount of analysis to determine the meaning/sense.
        Many &gt; people do &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that they can stare at a picture, close their eyes
        and -- &gt; for a &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; short &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; moment -- see an impression of the picture in their
        mind's &gt; eye, &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much computational effort at all. &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then how is it that
        some people can supposedly see the &gt; impression &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clearer and for longer than others? It seems to me
        that this &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; those people use more computational effort looking
        for the &gt; key &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; points &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that would help to sustain the impression. This may
        be &gt; conscious &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        or &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; subconscious.
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't
        have well developed brain photo skills at all, but I &gt; do &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; similar ability to make brain recordings of sounds.
        This was &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        developed &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from
        a young age (at a subconscious level), and later, as I &gt; became &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; analytical, I became
        aware of how my brain was actually &gt; doing it. &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Relating back to
        photography vs. reading, I discovered I am &gt; much &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at hearing than
        listening. That is, I can hear and record a &gt; sound &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; signal &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; instantly, and play it
        back in my head as many times as I &gt; wish, &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; but &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times it takes me a while to analyse the sound and
        realise &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; someone &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;

        So I'm sitting here at 4am, with nearly all my cubes out. Sadly only 5
        fully operational 3x3 cubes, and that includes my chrome one. I'm trying
        to re-build a fleet here. Two more cubes to prep and 2 and a half to
        re-sticker. And omg, re-stickering takes so much time and effort!
        Prepping used to take about a month per cube for me, so this is all
        looking pretty daunting. And once I'm done with that time to order more
        cubes... A while ago, I bashed the 25th aniversary cubes a bit. I
        thought they were too much like the Meffert's assembly in feel. That is
        it didn't take mis-alignment very well or have enough springy-ness.
        Right now I have two speedcubes: a White DIY, and one that is 25th
        anniversary pieces on a regular mechanism that I have worn in for about
        a year. But in genreal pretty crappy for my standards. Lately I've heard
        that a lot of very fast cubers use the 25th anniversary cubes. So I
        thought I'd give it a try. I took the pieces off a new 25th anniversary
        cube (hard to do btw), and put the ones from my black speedcube on it.
        And OH boy was it super smooth! And super quite too, oddly enough. Right
        now I'm doing a full cleaning and re-lubing just to make sure that
        phenomenon wasn't just a by-product of having lots and lots of dryed
        lube gunk in there. But so far I'm very impressed, and have changed my
        mind, I like these cubes now. Initially they are pretty bad and don't
        have that desired tightness I was used to finding on new cubes (in the
        past it used to be that tightness initially translated to smoothness a
        year later). I recommend the 25th anniversary cubes now. The one I just
        put together seems to be better then any cube I've used lately. Well
        except when one of my friends (35s cuber) came to visit 6 weeks ago with
        a cube I prepared for him 2 years ago, that one rocks hardcore and I'm
        convinced is one of the best speedcubes in the world. But back to
        this... Any one ever find a speedcube that doesn't do the usual clicking
        sounds but is very quite? Well back to pulling an all-nighter preping
        cubes and listening to a playlist entitiled "cubing" that I made years
        ago. See?, I'm such a hardcore cuber :). Speaking of which we should
        come up with jokes starting with "You know you've been cubing too much
        when..." Oh ya and it's that time of year again... I want people to
        start a thread, posting/listing the primary and perhaps secondary
        speedcube they use. Like how old it is, what make/model, and the type of
        stickers. Oh and don't forget to mention what class of speedcuber you
        are (i.e. sub-20 class, sub-25, sub-30, sub-35, ...). -Doug

        Ok fine, so I'm bored. In keeping with my last post, let me be the first
        to try some of these jokes. Though I suck at this.
        =====================================================================
        You know you've been cubing too much when the first thing you do every
        morning is wake up and check speedcubing.com. You know you've been
        cubing too much when the edges of your computer monitor(s) are filled
        with old cube stickers. You know you've been cubing *WAY* too much when
        all these stickers are LOGO stickers. You know you've been cubing too
        much when you regularly use the word "F2L" in conversation with
        non-cubers. You know you've been cubing too much when your fingers
        twitch while sleeping as if your doing a trigger. You know you've been
        cubing too much when it's 4:38am and you realized you hadn't left your
        room since you woke up and have been cubing continuously. You know
        you've been cubing too much when you have two Acube windows up, Ron's
        OnlineTimer, JNetCube, several IM windows to various cubers around the
        world, a recently finished MagicCube 4D window that you can't bare to
        close due to the 3.5 hrs you spent on it last night, browsers to several
        cubing sites (including your own!), shopping cart on rubik.com, a few
        record pages, CubeExplorer, and JNet's "Scramble View" window. (Oh wait,
        that's just me.) Your roommates know you've been cubing too much when
        you whip out "the mat". Your friends know you've been cubing too much
        when you always bring a cube to the restroom. You know you've been
        cubing too much when you have a special waterproof cube that you use
        while in the shower (and stays in the soap holder). You know you've been
        cubing too much when you walk around campus with a cell phone in one
        hand against your ear and doing one-handed in the other (...talking
        about the bld solve you did last night, lol). You know you've been
        cubing too much when the new roommate that just moved in last week finds
        you up at 6:45am out in the living room solving a cube with a blindfold
        on and does a double-take as she's trying to reach the bathroom. You
        know you've been cubing too much when you have an iTunes playlist
        entitled "Cubing" that is full of techno. You know you've been cubing
        too much that when shopping for a new cell phone you must have one that
        times to the hundredths of a second. Your classmates know you've been
        cubing too much when your palms are full of ink showing F's, prime's,
        L's, U's, etc... and your teacher know's your not cheating. You know
        you've been cubing too much when you carry around a piece of paper
        listing the latest Sunday contest scrambles. You know you've been cubing
        too much when your wardrobe has a disproportionate amount of utilites
        pants with extra large pockets. You know you've been cubing too much
        when you have a suitcase with foam lining with places for cubes and can
        lube. You know you've been cubing too much when for the past 5 years
        your computer's "busy-cursor" depicts a solving rubik's cube. You know
        you've been cubing too loudly when your neighbors pound the walls :(.
        You know you've been cubing too much when all your excercise/sleeping
        T-shirts are full of black grease marks. You know you've been cubing too
        much when you bring a cube to the beach or swimming pool and are anxious
        to do an underwater solve. You know you've been cubing too much when
        you've solved the cube on every rollercoster ride at your local theme
        park. You know you've been cubing too much when instead of fuzzy dice
        hanging in your car, you have fuzzy Rubik's cubes. You know you've been
        cubing too much when you take skydiving (or bungy jumpping) lessons for
        the expressed purpose of doing an "extreme-solve". You know you've been
        cubing too much when you have the utmost confidence that you can solve
        every mechanical permutation puzzle out there, even those not yet
        invented.... well except the accursed Astrolabacus, doh! You know you've
        been cubing too much when you keep a cube under your pillow... You know
        you've been cubing too much when you have a draw full of 2500 old cube
        stickers neatly packed in zip-lock bags with permenent marker labeling
        "Amsterdam", "Petrus", "HongKong", "Bombay", "CalTech 04", "Toronto 03",
        "Berkely 05", etc... You know you've been cubing too much when poeple
        ask you to write a book on the subject. You know you've been cubing too
        much when the school regularly asks you to give cubing/group theory
        lectures. You know you've been cubing too much when people forget your
        name and just call you "the cube guy". You know you've been cubing too
        much when you give mean and standard deviation when asked about your
        times. You know you've been cubing too much when you twist your watch
        around to the inside, reset it and then proclaim that "I am now in
        cubing-mode" like the nerd you are. You know you've been cubing too much
        when whenever people ask you for the time, you have to switch modes
        momentarily away from timer mode to respond. You know you've been cubing
        too much when you honestly think CalTech is the cubing capital of the
        world. You know you've been cubing too much when you have nightmeres
        about giant alien cubes invading and devouring your speedcubes.

        I'm doing a bit of cubing right now, and noticed I've been doing a
        couple of interesting things. You see, competitive speedcubing*, or at
        least the physical aspect can be broken up into three parts: Dexterity,
        Strength, and Accuracy. I think deterity comes from practice and is even
        something inherent of a person. So not much special can be done about
        that. For strength what I have been doing is practicing on an
        extra-tight and weighter cube. I have been using an over-tightened white
        DIY. To weigh it down, I put in about 18 zinc washers and stuff the edge
        pieces with playdoh. For accuracy, I now practice on an over lubed 25th
        anniversary cube, they are quite sensitive to lock-ups if your not
        careful enough, and the over-slickness will force you to build up
        accuracy and control. Ah yes, "accuracy" in this new age of cubing, that
        is now the new catch-phrase. I hear this term a lot from people like
        Macky and Tyson. So I leave you with the reminder: "It's not that your
        cube sucks, it's that you SUCK! So quick blaming your cubes and start
        working on your accuracy." -Doug *I say "competitive speedcubing" since
        there are actually many types of cubers out there, some that don't do it
        for speed, and even some that do it for speed but are not competitive on
        it. In fact, I don't fully fit into this category; I opted to be more of
        an "algorithm monopolizer".

        could be wrong. :-/ &gt; &gt; Yes, true. Because Java is an interpreted

        compiled languages. I what millenium are you guys living? ;-) Read a bit
        about JIT (just in time) compilers or Java HotSpot. And here's a little
        demo program: -------------------------------------------------- class

        program to C and C++, here are the timing results: Java: 0m21.740s C:
        0m34.830s C++: 0m34.850s Notice the program purposely has only very
        simple and fast operations (no divisions etc, just additions) so that
        most of the time is spent running the code, not waiting for computation
        results. I also ran the Java program on my PC (I only have Java 1.4.1
        where I did the first tests and that one doesn't have nice profiler
        output) and got the following profiler output. Notice how much is

        since we &gt; can define that each single move flips four edges. Thus,
        the U-turn of &gt; a solved cube results in four flipped edges... Hmm...
        how do you "define" that each move flips four edges? Also, it might be
        better to define how to count the edge flips and then "observe" that
        each move flips four edges (if that's true, and I actually doubt it).
        Here's my attempt for 3x3 corners: For each corner and each corner
        position choose a standard orientation (for corners choose a real
        sticker and for positions choose an imaginary sticker). Now the "twist"
        of a corner is how far it must be rotated clockwise (0,1 or 2) to match
        the standard orientation of the position it's in. The "total twist" is
        the sum of all corner twists, modulo 3. Now let's prove that a move
        doesn't change the total twist. The trick is to temporarily adjust the
        standard orientations of the corner positions involved in the move.
        Adjust them so that they match the face being turned. Since they're our
        reference, this will of course change our total twist. Call that change
        the "face twist". Now we do the move which (thanks to the adjusted
        standard orientations) doesn't change the total twist further.
        Afterwards we undo the adjustments, which will again change our total
        twist, but this time the opposite way. So we're back at the original
        standard orientations and the overall effect of the move on our total
        twist is: (face twist) + 0 - (face twist) = 0. Since any move doesn't
        change the total twist but rotating a single corner does, this can't be
        done with moves. What do you think? The proof (with different
        numbers/names) also works for edges and also other puzzles, e.g.

        if you have problems with speed and don't really depend on Swing, try
        AWT instead. Though I'd be a bit surprised if you have speed problems

        Meffert's assembly in feel. That is it &gt; didn't take mis-alignment
        very well or have enough springy-ness. &gt; &gt; Right now I have two
        speedcubes: a White DIY, and one that is 25th &gt; anniversary pieces on
        a regular mechanism that I have worn in for &gt; about a year. But in
        genreal pretty crappy for my standards. &gt; &gt; Lately I've heard that
        a lot of very fast cubers use the 25th &gt; anniversary cubes. So I
        thought I'd give it a try. &gt; &gt; I took the pieces off a new 25th
        anniversary cube (hard to do btw), &gt; and put the ones from my black
        speedcube on it. And OH boy was it &gt; super smooth! And super quite
        too, oddly enough. &gt; &gt; Right now I'm doing a full cleaning and
        re-lubing just to make sure &gt; that phenomenon wasn't just a
        by-product of having lots and lots of &gt; dryed lube gunk in there. But
        so far I'm very impressed, and have &gt; changed my mind, I like these
        cubes now. Initially they are pretty &gt; bad and don't have that
        desired tightness I was used to finding on &gt; new cubes (in the past
        it used to be that tightness initially &gt; translated to smoothness a
        year later). &gt; &gt; I recommend the 25th anniversary cubes now. The
        one I just put &gt; together seems to be better then any cube I've used
        lately. Well &gt; except when one of my friends (35s cuber) came to
        visit 6 weeks ago &gt; with a cube I prepared for him 2 years ago, that
        one rocks hardcore &gt; and I'm convinced is one of the best speedcubes

        unfounded due to the matter &gt; of normal resolution which you have
        completely misunderstood. You left &gt; the size of the page at its
        normal size/resolution, while on the other &gt; hand, you shrunk the
        size of the recording of 1000 spoken words from its &gt; normal
        resolution of 200 seconds down to 1 second. This resolution is &gt; too
        compacted for any human to perceive. To make a fair comparison, you &gt;
        should also shrink the size of the page of written text by 200 times as
        &gt; well. Then we are both handicapped in the same way. I should've
        been more clear. I don't want to play the 1000 words at high speed, I
        want to play them at *normal* speed. Just all at the same time. Just
        like the photoreaders when they see 1000 normal size words at the same
        time. &gt; Well, if you were to listen to a length of sound with the aim
        of &gt; memorising it, you would listen to it several times, focussing
        on a &gt; different portion each time and ignoring the rest. Possibly
        you would &gt; take in relatively small portions at a time, whereas I
        would take in &gt; relatively large chunks of sound as one unit. By
        portion, I do not mean &gt; just timewise, but also depthwise. For
        example, if you were able to &gt; demonstrate to me that you could
        listen to a whole 10 second fragment of &gt; music in one hearing and
        remember the entire melody, I would point out &gt; that you have only
        remembered one portion of the sound; There are also &gt; the drums, the
        guitar, bass guitar, keyboard (which is very dense in &gt; that it can
        involve chords with 6 or 7 parts played simultaneously), &gt; vocal
        parts and more, as well as the finer subtle points such as "how" &gt;
        the vocalists expressed each word (e.g. there are an infinite many ways
        &gt; to say a particular word), how the bass player attacked the 29th
        note in &gt; the bassline, etc. There is a lot of data in here, which I
        can pick up &gt; in one hearing, like an audio recording, but not quite
        that precise. I do believe you that. Reminds me a bit of the chess
        masters that can easily remember whole chess boards (that is, if they
        display a normal game, not if they're random). The first problem of most
        people remembering much of a music fragment is probably that they aren't
        even able to pay attention to everything because they're not used to it
        (missing attention when being introduced to people is also the #1 reason
        why I often can't remember their names ;-) And yes, it's of course data,
        but a different kind of data. How are you going to play/record 1000
        words in a second using sound? Hmm, just a thought... there's a
        memorization discipline called "spoken numbers" where you're just
        listening to someone telling a sequence of digits, one digit each
        second. How many do you think you could remember? And would it help if
        they spoke faster? Stefan

        Hmm... how do you "define" that each move flips four edges? Indeed. It
        just happens to be the case that you can choose a reference facelet for
        each edge such that no two are a quarter turn apart. If you do this 6H
        pattern, you will see which facelets I mean: U2 B2 R2 U2D2 R2 F2 U2 &gt;
        Here's my attempt for 3x3 corners: ... &gt; What do you think? That is
        the standard proof. You can find it in the Cubic Circular:
        http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p21 There you will
        also see the one-line proof for edge flip parity: A single edge-flip is
        a swap of two facelets, and hence is an odd permutation of the facelets,
        but every move is an even permutation of facelets and so no single edge
        flip is possible. Unfortunately this does not work on corners because a
        corner twist is a 3-cycle of facelets, not directly ruled out by the
        parity. Jaap http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/

        &gt; &gt; If the answer is 'yes', then the problem is to determine which
        corners &gt; that are twisted clockwise and which corners that are
        twisted anti- &gt; clockwise. The answer can be both "yes" and "no". The
        idea is that the cube is no longer considered symmetrical. That is,
        different face turns are different. Namely, U and D turns are different
        from the other face turns. We'll consider the reference frame as being
        the U and D faces. The twist of a corner is how many times it has to be
        twisted clockwise so that it's U/D face is in the U/D face (this can
        always be done, since every corner belongs to either of these two
        faces). In the starting position, the total twist is 0. Now let's see
        what different face turns do. U and D don't change the total twist. It
        is then easy to see that F, B, R and L are symmetrical to each other, so
        we'll consider doing the move F. We will have 4 twisted corners. The
        ones in the UFL and DFR positions have twist 1, and the ones in the UFR
        and DFL positions have twist 2. The total is 0. So no move changes the
        total twist. &gt; The edges pose not the same problem since we &gt; can
        define that each single move flips four edges. Thus, the U- turn of &gt;
        a solved cube results in four flipped edges... &gt; &gt; /Anders I think
        that's not possible if we define the orietation with regards to a frame,
        but I just found another definition: We define the twist of an edge as 0
        if by bringing it to its correct position (and orientation) we use an
        even number of quarter outer face turns, and 1 if we need an odd number
        of quarter turns. One move changes the orientation of 4 edges, because
        they are one quarter turn more (or less) away from their solved position
        - it is exactly that quarter turn which we performed. Since 4 is an even
        number, the parity of the total twist doesn't change when we perform a
        quarter turn. Again we see that there is an invariant: the parity of the
        total twist. One twisted edge means the total twist is odd, which is a
        contradiction. Sebastian

        Daniel I'm not sure if this was mentioned but there's a technical aspect

        well-defined. Essentially, that's to say that the identity ican't be
        realized as an odd permutation. If you are willing to accept that then
        the proof is fairly straightforward but that detail does require some
        proof. (One way to do this is using determiants of permutation matrices
        - then it essentially boils down to (-1)^n can't be 1 if n is odd.)

        &gt; Hmm... how do you "define" that each move flips four edges? &gt;
        &gt; Indeed. It just happens to be the case that you can choose a
        reference &gt; facelet for each edge such that no two are a quarter turn
        apart. If &gt; you do this 6H pattern, you will see which facelets I
        mean: &gt; U2 B2 R2 U2D2 R2 F2 U2 Nice, that indeed makes it obvious :-)
        &gt; &gt; Here's my attempt for 3x3 corners: &gt; ... &gt; &gt; What do
        you think? &gt; &gt; That is the standard proof. You can find it in the
        Cubic Circular: &gt;
        http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p21 Yeah yeah, once
        again I reinvented the wheel... I even used the same term and definition
        for "twist" ;-). Well, at least I didn't define the "principal
        direction" (my "standard orientation") of the pieces and positions to
        match when the puzzle is solved... which is completely unnecessary :-)
        &gt; A single edge-flip is a swap of two facelets, and hence is an odd
        &gt; permutation of the facelets, but every move is an even permutation
        of &gt; facelets and so no single edge flip is possible. Too bad I was
        thinking about corners only, I did think about facelet permutations but
        quickly abandoned it ;-) Stefan

        &gt; So if you have problems with speed and don't really depend on

        almost impossible to tell what the final product will look like on
        another OS/X combination. As a *nix user I know that there are almost an
        unlimited amount of window managers out there and you never know what to
        expect! I just like playing on the safe side and let java(swing) control
        the graphics. That way I don't have to worry about spacing issues when
        it comes to button/font sizes on different OSs. Java is nice. Not a bad
        language. Many prebuilt supplied libraries, but the graphics engine is
        nothing compared to a good GTK+ setup! Only problem with GTK+ is that I
        have to compile the GUI for every Os. pfft. I'll never win. -Chris

        same time. Just like the photoreaders when they see 1000 normal size
        &gt; words at the same time. ??! Ok, here is my serious answer, and you
        can laugh if you weren't being serious. A sound is temporal and a page
        is spatial. That is, you discern the contents of a sound by time, and
        you discern the contents of a page by space. If you want to overlay all
        of the spoken words over each other at one point in time and play them
        back, it is only fair to overlay all of the written words at point in
        space and then try to look at them. It can be done to a certain number
        of layers, but not 1000 words overlaid over each other! However, I would
        say that the number of layers one can discern in audio data is far
        greater than that in visual data, and that is one of the differences
        between audio and visual data. &gt; And yes, it's of course data, but a
        different kind of data. How are &gt; you going to play/record 1000 words
        in a second using sound? Yes, it's a different kind of data: it's audio,
        not visual. And this answers your next question: there is no natural way
        to express 1000 spoken words in 1 second, because a spoken word takes up
        too much time. No comparison can be made that way. It's not easy to
        express a sound on a piece of paper either. It's much more efficient to
        hear it. &gt; Hmm, just a thought... there's a memorization discipline
        called &gt; "spoken numbers" where you're just listening to someone
        telling a &gt; sequence of digits, one digit each second. How many do
        you think you &gt; could remember? And would it help if they spoke
        faster? There's a limit to how much data I can capture in one go. So,
        for example, give me 10 seconds of complex data such as this, and I will
        remember quite precisely the original audio track. I do not think about
        or even recognise the actual numbers and try to filter out the rest, I
        just hear and remember the whole sound. I can then play back the sound
        later in my head and try to figure out what numbers you actually spoke.
        People will often perceive me as a slow thinker because of that. The
        amount of sound I can capture in one go depends on its complexity. If it
        is less complex, I can capture maybe a whole minute in one go. I'm sure
        that if all you were interested in were the actual numbers themselves,
        you should ask someone who is good at filtering. I don't do any
        filtering - I try to capture every detail I hear. Ryan

        Hey all, I did a breakdown average, timing the F2L and LL separately on
        the Stackmat, and (for the curious) here were my results: F2L = cross
        (bottom face) + 4 C/E pairs LL = OLL (+ AUF) + PLL # F2L LL 1 16.61 9.61
        2 15.61 6.54 3 15.53 8.40 4 18.39 7.99 5 (14.15) (9.61) 6 19.43 7.44 7

        19.91 (6.00) Av 17.74 7.93 (Total avg: 25.67) Since my best average is
        24.78, I think this average accurately demonstrates what my typical
        solves look like (except OLL recognition is instead replaced with
        starting the Stackmat timer and grabbing the cube. There were no lucky
        cases. Based on these averages, it's clear that my biggest problem is
        the F2L (only one sub-15 F2L time!). I know it's been asked plenty of
        times before, but maybe I missed something important, so here's my
        question: Does anybody have any advice for improving the F2L? ~ Bob

        Hmm ... Java does indeed have quite powerful graphics. Apart from using
        Java3D which at least on windows u can run in either the DirectX or the
        OpenGL flavour. U need a separate JDK and runtime environment for coding
        and running respectively. Apart from this, the Java2D is also quite
        powerful. At least for Java2D u won't need other than the normal Sun
        java virtual machine, preferably JRE 1.5 (5.0). For a demo of it's
        powerful features check out ur JDK folder which should reside somewhere
        similar to this :
        C:\Programfiler\Java\jdk1.5.0_03\demo\jfc\Java2D\Java2Demo.html At least
        im quite impressed with all of it's features. Remember that this is
        platform independent graphics :-) Besides the java collection classes
        this is the java stuff im most impressed by. The downside of Java is the
        relatively slow text- and numbercrunching. And also it can be somewhat
        of a pain to make attractive GUI's with java using it's layout managers.
        Using for instance Eclipse and a plugin like JIgloo it's at least a
        little more attractive. But it requires lots or RAM to run smoothly. Oh
        and don't try to run Eclipse and ACube at the same time :-P Yes u
        guessed it, Eclipse is a java application. It will be very slow.
        Effective threading within the JVM is also not it's strong side :-(

        13~14 seconds for the F2L and 11 seconds (!!!) for the LL. To improve my
        F2L times, I used Macky's Tips
        (http://cubefreak.hp.infoseek.co.jp/speedcubing_tips.html) + I had a F2L
        cube which is very useful to improve your F2L. Another important thing
        is to be able to use FreeSlots when you do the 3 first F2L when it's
        necessary. You should also try to see what you can do when you have 2
        F2L done but not correctly placed in order to save them. For me, I have
        to work on the LL :p.

        I'm in the same boat. I average under 15 on my F2L. My last layer is 10
        or 11+ seconds most of the time. The key to slower times is to force
        yourself to go slower than the frantic pace you feel like you need. Just
        try to be constantly turning. Also, easy optimizations are very helpful.
        Play around with block style F2L shortcuts. Use tips from Gilles Roux's
        and Lars Petrus' sites. Also, try to use corners or edges already
        correctly placed to your advantage. Andy Camann's site has a great
        working corner method description you can use for this. -Mike Bennett

        I have a question regarding the F2L - I have been cubing for a few
        months and I average around 32s - my 3-look LL is very fast (haven't yet
        learned OLL) but my F2L is horrible. I use an intuitive method, cross on
        bottom, and many of the moves I can "see" are not optimal at all - it
        should be around 6-7 moves per pair and many cases for me are much more
        than that. My question is, what is the general way of doing F2L,
        intuitively or by memorization (or a mixture of both?). Bryan Mytko

        &gt; My question is, what is the general way of doing F2L, intuitively
        or &gt; by memorization (or a mixture of both?). I think both. You
        should first try to do most of them by yourself. Then if you want, you
        can check with F2L algorithm list. But the problem with that list is
        that it's for the last F2L. So it works for all of them, but in some
        cases they are not optimal because of free slots you could use to do
        F2L. So: 1. Search yourself (not only when timing, for exemple take a
        situation, then search what you can do. ) 2. With time and practice,
        you'll find other ways (better ?) to do some F2L. 3. If you want to have
        some idea, check the F2L algorithms list but don't study it stupidly.

        The more I think about it, the less fair your suggestions seems! Perhaps
        you are forgetting how big the United States is? This year, there are a
        total of 3 planned tournaments in California. The next closest
        tournament is OVER 1700 miles away. Almost every tournament in Europe is
        within about 1000 miles from the furthest one, which gives you (I am
        assuming you're from Europe?) a total of 7 competitions. Just look at
        the SCC Events page! The New York competition is just about as far from
        the California competitions as it is from the Dutch Open! I'm having
        trouble seeing what's so unfair and who it is unfair to. ~ Bob --- In

        &gt; Ok, looking at a screenshot it's pretty obvious you do make good
        use &gt; of layout managers. But I'd be surprised if there were big
        problems in &gt; different OSs/WindowManagers. Have you seen problems in
        the past or &gt; even have screenshots of them? &gt; &gt; Stefan AWT is
        not so much a 'problem' as it is an annoyance. The programs function
        fine and are still usable, they just have totally different appearances
        on each OS I use it on. I like swing because it promises that the GUI
        will look fine on any OS that supports a full JRE. I have a few
        minimal-type window managers I use in Linux that don't have native
        buttons (or even decent fonts), so AWT wouldn't work in that case. I
        just like making stuff that I will be able to use on any computer in my
        house (or any computer in anyone else's house I guess) :) Applet
        programming is a little different because you have to use awt (at least
        you did the last time I made an applet). That's why some java applets
        don't work on some of my computers. I have an X Server running, but not
        a powerful window manager. Only swing works for me in that case. -Chris

        Hello, I'm planning on buying a StackmatTimer. But I'm hesitating
        between the regular large Mat or the MiniMat. I'm only planning to use
        it to solve cubes, magic and small puzzles. There is no price
        difference. Is it really useful to have the large Mat to solve cubes ?
        Or is it mostly a problem because of the size ? Or is the best solution
        to have both ? :p (+10$ is not that much, and it could be useful on
        travel, etc) What do you think ? Thx, Gilles.

        Alright - let me rephrase my question. As I have realized through some
        of the replies to it apparently I didn't appropriately word it. Is there
        a MAX number of tourney's a "group" can hold in a calendar year? Does
        the WCA have a set number of Tournaments it is willing to approve for a
        year? I was pointed to the fact that I can view all the tournaments on
        the SCC page (which I didn't know, and I see that CA has only had 3 to
        date). So I apologize for that - just seems like so many more :) ---

        I agree, Caltech does have a LOT of tournaments every year. I think that
        there should be a maximum limit of maybe three local tournaments per
        year, and then there can also be national tournaments and other kinds.

        All right, In my very humble opinion, you're all jerks. I spent a good

        I apologize....? I really didn't mean to make you mad. I'm sorry. I just
        don't think that Caltech should be allowed to hold as many OFFICIAL
        tournaments as they do. that's because official tournaments are where
        official world records can be set, so if they're always attended by the
        same people, being the people at Caltech, will most likely always have
        the official world records. making it a little bit unfair. --- In

        us were asking you to spend any of your own out of pocket expenses for a
        tournament that is outside of your area. I agree that you work hard and
        put on good tournaments - I have seen them and heard about them - that
        isn't an issue. If you have/had the money to get to NY and to Dallas
        more power to you, no one is disputing that - especially if you
        volunteer to attend. I am just making sure that it would be totally
        feasible for myself to hold my own tournament if the requirements were
        met. True? Philia, Crispy

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There should be some sort of

        advantage against the people &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in

        Java programming, and I've never heard of the window manager affecting
        whether or not you can run AWT or Swing. The only thing that I could
        think of that would affect this is whether or not the classes are
        present in your JRE (Java runtime environment). Or maybe this is a Kaffe
        vs. Sun JVM problem that you are talking about. &gt; Applet programming
        is a little different because you have to use awt &gt; (at least you did
        the last time I made an applet). That's why some &gt; java applets don't
        work on some of my computers. I have an X Server &gt; running, but not a
        powerful window manager. Only swing works for me in &gt; that case. You
        can make applets that use Swing. Swing wasn't included in the Microsoft
        JVM, but there were still ways to make it work (see
        http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=135132).

        Hi friendz, Everyone is free to organize a tournament. For official
        tournaments we do need someone attending, whom can fully trust. He/she
        can be the WCA delegate, and will make sure that the full WCA
        regulations are followed. The problem is that there are only a few of us
        willing to offer time (and money) to organize events. There are some
        people out there who did this, some did it a few times. But it was
        ALWAYS to help other people, instead of for their own benefit. Cube
        tournaments have always been great, kind of like big reunions. It is
        absolutely unfair to complain if there is no tournament in your
        neighborhood. What prevents you from organizing one? And if you REALLY
        want to attend a tournament, then what prevents you from going to one?
        This is to ALL of you. If you are thinking of organizing a tournament,
        then just do it! If you contact Tyson, Gilles or me, then maybe we can
        help. Have fun, Ron No complaining please! ----- Original Message -----

      <div class="email-content">
        All right, my last post. I promise, and I'll be nicer in this one. If
        you'll notice for the 2005 year, there has only been one tournament held
        so far in Southern California. In October, we will hold the Caltech Fall
        tournament so that will be two tournaments in Southern California. In
        Northern California, there was the San Francisco tournament—that makes
        one. If we hold another one, then it would be two tournaments. As you
        can clearly see, not one of these locations is have an excessive number
        of tournaments. Furthermore, given the number of cubers in Southern
        California, I would think that four tournaments each year was a good
        number. That's one tournament every three months and each one of these
        tournaments is bringing in over 40 people. The Chevron gas station on
        Hill Ave. and Colorado Ave. in Pasadena to the Chevron gas station in
        San Mateo, California on 4th Ave. is 370 miles. That's about 6 hours of
        driving. 5 and a half if I don't make too many stops. For all purposes,
        Northern California and Southern California are separate regions. With
        the exception of Texas, a six hour drive easily puts you across state
        boarders. And on the east cost, would put you across two or three. I
        spend a lot of time and energy organizing these tournaments. It should
        be conceivable to you that perhaps it is much more feasible for you to
        come to Caltech or San Francisco than it is for me to go to your home
        and hold a tournament there. I cannot do these tournaments without my
        friends. The success in these tournaments lie in people such as Mark
        Team or Sleeping Leyan and Blindfoldmasterwoman Shelley. Without these
        people, the tournaments would not run smoothly. You might be able to ask
        me to host a tournament near you, but I can't possibly ask all of these
        people to come with me every where I go. The origin of our tournament in
        Dallas was simple: I was thinking of museums, Shelley suggest the
        Science Place, they liked the idea, and I have been working with them
        since February to make this tournament happen. If you want a tournament
        somewhere, how am I supposed to make it happen if you go around
        complaining about tournaments in California? That doesn't give me ANY
        information on where a tournament should be held. Take note of
        competitors like Bob and Macky. Bob has been to San Francisco, Chicago,
        New York... you name, he's there. He'll be in Dallas too. Macky has been
        to Pasadena, naturally, but he's also traveled to San Francisco and New
        York, and he'll be off to Dallas as well. Simply said, these are
        dedicated cubers willing to make the effort of travel. There are
        opportunities here in the United States for Rubik's Cube competitions,
        and they go ahead and take these opportunities. You complain about not
        having the resources. I am NOT a welfare program. If you are really that
        great at the Rubik's Cube, then someone would sponsor you. If not, all
        you need is the desire and determination to make these things happen. If
        you wanted to come to California to compete, and you wanted it bad
        enough, I'm sure you can accomplish it. The fact of the matter is you
        have a computer and that alone says that you have the resources and the
        intelligence to make things happens. The motivation and determination,
        well, that you'll have to dig up yourself. You claim why should you have
        to invest money so that I can go to your tournament? Well, you've
        treated me in such a manner that I don't think I would be willing to
        spend my own money to help you set up your own tournament, nor would I
        be willing to spend the time. Your complaining shows a lack of
        understanding of the amount of work and energy that goes in to these
        tournaments. You should notice that I generally don't compete at the
        tournaments which I'm in charge in. That should be an indication of the
        demands of running the tournament. As a final note, I will take your
        complaining as a compliment because you have noticed that a great deal
        of competitions are held under the Caltech name and I thank you for
        recognizing my hard work. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        Even though I live in California, Caltech is a 6 hour drive from my
        house, it might as well be in another state as far as it is but I still
        make the drive down there every chance I get to compete. Sure I'm an
        adult so I am able to arrange it for myself a little easier than a
        younger cuber might, but we can't put the world on hold until they grow
        up;) What you really need to think about is not that it's unfair that
        California has 4 tournaments a year, but there's 4 chances per year you
        may be able to come to one. Heck just a few years ago, there were no
        tournaments at all to go to, and now that they are organized (very well
        I must say) and more frequent, I find it hard to believe that any
        speedcubers would complain about this. Just in the past year Tyson and
        Caltech has done more to grow the sport especially in CALIFORNIA where
        he LIVES than anyone else has done wherever they live. Get off your
        butt, quit complaining, and do something about it. Do some public
        cubing, try to get on TV somehow with your amazing talent to get it some
        exposure in your area, just do something, be creative. You have to
        generate some interest where you live if you ever hope to get a
        tournament near you that you might have to organize yourself. Band
        together with other speedcubers in your area and make it happen. nobody

        quarter turns. (zero is also an even number!) - An edge cubie is flipped

        The &gt; twist of a corner is how many times it has to be twisted
        clockwise &gt; so that it's U/D face is in the U/D face (this can always
        be done, &gt; since every corner belongs to either of these two faces).
        In the &gt; starting position, the total twist is 0. Now let's see what
        &gt; different face turns do. &gt; &gt; U and D don't change the total
        twist. It is then easy to see that F, &gt; B, R and L are symmetrical to
        each other, so we'll consider doing &gt; the move F. We will have 4
        twisted corners. The ones in the UFL and &gt; DFR positions have twist
        1, and the ones in the UFR and DFL &gt; positions have twist 2. The

        I wholeheartedly concur. Look at Bob Burton. He travelled to Caltech to
        cube from New Jersey. He went to Chicago to compete. I have the sneaking
        suspicion he'll crop up in Dallas, too. Why don't you try to do the same
        thing? I realize you're only 16. Even so, if it bothered you so much,
        you could find a way to get there. This advice may seem harsh, but it's
        coming from someone working 7 day weeks in order to pay for a trip to
        Germany in a few weeks. Caltech tournaments should not be limited in
        number simply because they're in the state of California. For one thing,
        it's a very large state. Even many California cubers have long commutes
        to get there. Also, I don't understand why you think the community as a
        whole shouldn't try for as many good tournaments as possible. This gives
        more people a chance to compete, more exposure for the community, and
        gives the individual competitors the most chances to improve. I
        understand you're somewhat limited in your travel abilities, not only
        due to your age and financial situations, but also your location. You're
        900 miles from Caltech. I'm twice as far. I've missed out on a lot of
        tournaments I'd liked to have attended because of this. It's still no
        grounds to be bitter. It only makes my resolve to get to future
        tournaments and compete well that much stronger. -Mike Bennett -----

        PM Subject: [Speed cubing group] California tournaments Even though I
        live in California, Caltech is a 6 hour drive from my house, it might as
        well be in another state as far as it is but I still make the drive down
        there every chance I get to compete. Sure I'm an adult so I am able to
        arrange it for myself a little easier than a younger cuber might, but we
        can't put the world on hold until they grow up;) What you really need to
        think about is not that it's unfair that California has 4 tournaments a
        year, but there's 4 chances per year you may be able to come to one.
        Heck just a few years ago, there were no tournaments at all to go to,
        and now that they are organized (very well I must say) and more
        frequent, I find it hard to believe that any speedcubers would complain
        about this. Just in the past year Tyson and Caltech has done more to
        grow the sport especially in CALIFORNIA where he LIVES than anyone else
        has done wherever they live. Get off your butt, quit complaining, and do
        something about it. Do some public cubing, try to get on TV somehow with
        your amazing talent to get it some exposure in your area, just do
        something, be creative. You have to generate some interest where you
        live if you ever hope to get a tournament near you that you might have
        to organize yourself. Band together with other speedcubers in your area
        and make it happen. nobody likes whiners, let's try to keep it positive

        Hi Everyone, I just did a blindfold solve on a StackMat with a blindfold
        so I could practice under tournament conditions. I discovered that the
        first time I didn't quite pull the blindfold down very well and it was
        possible to see a little. I was hoping for suggestions on how to improve
        our blindfold technology. The googles they used in Sweden looked good,
        but I think it would be nicer to have blindfolds that you could put on
        more quickly. Anyway, ideas? Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        Did I just say "googles"? Actually, I think the problem isn't that much
        of a problem. The elastic band on the blindfold I have is very loose.
        With the tighter ones, the blindfolds hurt your eyes and face enough
        that there's no way you could open them without dying. :-P Tyson Mao MSC

        You could build a kind of screen that was placed between the solvers
        head and cube. Sort of like the sneeze guard at buffet restaurants. An
        other idea is a full hood covering the head. With breathing holes only.
        The other cheating avenue is if you let people use their own cubes. It's
        not hard to put some distinctive feelable marks on some stickers. It can

        a gross over-estimate. &gt; &gt; I don't find anything odd about the
        whole deal. &gt; &gt; Unless the actor has small slender (and perhaps
        Asian) hands, I &gt; don't think they would want Macky. If I was
        directing, I would want &gt; a hand-double reasonably close to the
        actor's as my top priority, &gt; not looking for speed. I'm sure any
        cuber under 35s can show off mad &gt; deterity/speed if they really
        wanted to and a scene/cube was setup &gt; for it. &gt; &gt; Don't assume
        they are looking for that much authenticity... &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug Doug
        Well, you took that rather hard. Allow me to clarify, I was merely
        kidding about getting Macky to do a one handed solve for the scene. I
        think the concept of a script is pretty self explanatory, but your
        dedication to the writer's guild was not lost. Do you have shares in the
        industry? I mentioned flying Chris, in particular, because it was he who
        they contacted in regards to the opportunity, so obviously they were
        interested in him. Especially since the email stated if HE, or one of
        his friends, could do it. This led me to believe that they were hoping
        for Chris first. My point was if that was the angle they had hoped for,
        why not shell out a few bucks to get it? However, I am sure you are more
        than capable of being the hand double and/or coach, if reading that will
        make you feel better. And I didn't do research for a plane ticket from
        Chris' home to San Francisco, but know that when I looked for a ticket
        to Dallas from Toronto, it was in the $700 range, so I was merely "ball
        parking" it. I also offered it up as a question, not as a concrete
        statistic. But I sure appreciate you clearing up such an important
        detail. Were you having a bad day?

        the SF area... say LarsP or Tyson (DanK used to live there). &gt; &gt; I
        don't think the point is to do something as &gt;
        entertaining/extravegant as possible, they probably just want to &gt;
        follow the script as close as possible. &gt; &gt; Also, who says they
        wouldn't be willing to fly someone in from afar. &gt; The letter was
        from Patrick, and it sounded to me like they just &gt; wanted SF area
        for convience of all parties. &gt; &gt; Plane ticket like that would
        cost less then $500 round trip actually &gt; so that was a gross
        over-estimate. &gt; &gt; I don't find anything odd about the whole deal.
        &gt; &gt; Unless the actor has small slender (and perhaps Asian) hands,
        I &gt; don't think they would want Macky. If I was directing, I would
        want &gt; a hand-double reasonably close to the actor's as my top
        priority, &gt; not looking for speed. I'm sure any cuber under 35s can
        show off mad &gt; deterity/speed if they really wanted to and a
        scene/cube was setup &gt; for it. &gt; &gt; Don't assume they are
        looking for that much authenticity... &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug Doug Well,
        you took that rather hard. Allow me to clarify, I was merely kidding
        about getting Macky to do a one handed solve for the scene. I think the
        concept of a script is pretty self explanatory, but your dedication to
        the writer's guild was not lost. Do you have shares in the industry? I
        mentioned flying Chris, in particular, because it was he who they
        contacted in regards to the opportunity, so obviously they were
        interested in him. Especially since the email stated if HE, or one of
        his friends, could do it. This led me to believe that they were hoping
        for Chris first. My point was if that was the angle they had hoped for,
        why not shell out a few bucks to get it? However, I am sure you are more
        than capable of being the hand double and/or coach, if reading that will
        make you feel better. And I didn't do research for a plane ticket from
        Chris' home to San Francisco, but know that when I looked for a ticket
        to Dallas from Toronto, it was in the $700 range, so I was merely "ball
        parking" it. I also offered it up as a question, not as a concrete
        statistic. But I sure appreciate you clearing up such an important
        detail. Were you having a bad day? SPONSORED LINKS Free puzzle games

        Well looking over his original post, I think he just feels it is unfair
        that a disproportionate number of tournemnts are held in CA. And from
        that alone, it does appear to be unfair for the rest of us. The obvious
        solution would be to limit the number of *offical* tournaments. (It's of
        course not possible to limit unoffical tournaments.) However, say there
        are 5 nearly identical tournaments at location X one year, and the limit
        is 3. Who gets to decide which of those 3 are offical... it's kind of a
        toss-up. World rankings will differ depending on that decision, and even
        if it is decided in advance, there is always the chance for bad-timing
        to happen... a very fast guy is out of town, or another very fast guy
        just happens to be visiting from out of town. So setting limits is not
        the best solution. It seems to me like anyone with enough experience can
        attempt to set up a tournament where they deem fit. I'd say it's fair to
        ask for 18 months experience in the cubing community. It's also a must
        to have someone trusted on site, and that person may or may not be the
        site coordinator. Most people that have been around for over 5 years or
        have ran previous tournements ought to be trustworthy enough, pending
        WCA decision.... Crispy, you failed to mention *WHERE* you would like a
        tournament to be held.... Instead of simply complaining, if you be more
        specific maybe somebody here is willing to help you out. I am at the
        initial planning stages of a tournament for the Midwest area, which
        seems to be lacking. Hopefully I can work something out with Tyson, Jon,
        and Jake on it. Though I do note that one was done in Chicago about 6
        months ago already. I don't want to conflict with anyone else's
        tournament, or I'd like to get permission to work out a
        symmutaneous/distributed tournament like they do for ARML. That would
        mean starting everything on two (or more) sites at the same time, have
        the same events, and use identical scrambles. (This is regardless of
        time zones, but the scrambles would have to be held under the tightest
        security and be devolged at the latest possible moment.) So as for what
        Ron said about lack of time and money.... *I am willing to offer the
        time*. Now money.... that's another issue, but I'm sure I could get some
        help on that from some of you guys out there (or corporate sponsorship).
        Though typically entry fees oughta cover it in most cases. Note that
        it's still quite speculative and there's already lots of stuff already
        planned for the remainder of the year, so this is more for say
        January... and I'll be trying to get Tyson's help on it. Alright let's
        have a vote... maybe oughta do a poll here. Where should it be and when?
        I want a LOT of feed back. Location: Chicago metro Chicago suburbs
        Kalamazoo Ann Arbor (my town) Other Time: Same time as Dallas (means I
        won't have to go, but that requires quick action as it's coming soon and
        an OK from Tyson) September (not same weekend as the other tournament in
        Europe) October (our retaliation for not being able to go to Dutch cube
        day) November (no, it out to be a rule that no tournaments may be held
        on the same month as a WC) December? (maybe too soon after WC and who
        wants to travel around the holidays?) late-January (sounds evenly placed
        there) or some other time later? -Doug P.S. - Is it just me, or don't
        you all think that Erno Rubik is whealthy enough he could/should setup
        an endowment fund for cube- related travel expenses. (There could be a
        committee overseeing it...) --- In

        Hey Everyone, Thanks for all the kind words about my stickers. If you
        like the Tiles, I'll have new ones next week with a rougher surface for
        better grip. Anyway here's the rules for winning the Sunday Contest
        Prize: The winner of the contest will receive a set of stickers for any
        six- color puzzle of his or her choice. The winner will then be
        ineligible to win again for 4 weeks of participation, but will continue
        earn "tokens" or random drawing entries for consecutive participations
        in the Sunday Contest; See next paragraph. In addition to having a
        winner for speed, a random drawing will be held for a set of randomly
        chosen stickers. Winners will be ineligible for 4 participations in the
        contest. For every consecutive participation participants will get an
        additional "token" or entry into the drawing for the next week. So the
        more that you participate, the better the chances that you'll win the
        drawing. As you can see it is well worth it to enter as any random entry
        can win!! Thanks Chris www.cubesmith.com

        I am 100% against this. I think we should require the cuber to resticker
        their cube with provided sticker sheets, or if that is too expensive the
        cuber's own. This means that the cube will be stiff and hard to use
        triggers on. Also who's going to buy the cubes? The organizer
        him/herself? Stickers are cheaper anyway. Also you can't put your cube
        together such that if a piece pops you know how to put it back in. A new
        cube won't have your internal "system" for the pieces. So if you pop on
        a new cube you're screwed, rather than being able to continue on your
        own cube. I like the spirit of the idea, but lets just replace the

        completely opposed. &gt; It seems to me like anyone with enough

        I'd say it's fair to ask for 18 &gt; months experience in the cubing

        that person may or may not be the site &gt; coordinator. Most people
        that have been around for over 5 years or &gt; have ran previous

        I could be wrong... &gt; Crispy, you failed to mention *WHERE* you would
        like a tournament to &gt; be held.... Instead of simply complaining, if
        you be more specific &gt; maybe somebody here is willing to help you
        out. There is WAY too much complaining going on about things lately.
        &gt; I am at the initial planning stages of a tournament for the Midwest
        &gt; area, which seems to be lacking. Hopefully I can work something out
        &gt; with Tyson, Jon, and Jake on it. Though I do note that one was done
        &gt; in Chicago about 6 months ago already. I am also trying to plan a
        tournament for this Fall. Since I started the Rutgers Univ. Rubik's Cube
        Club, I can get funding from the school and the school can be used as a
        venue without having to worry about paying for equipment or whatever.
        Though not in the Midwest, there haven't been many east coast
        competitions here, either, so hopefully this would spark some more
        interest in the area. &gt; Location: &gt; Chicago metro &gt; Chicago
        suburbs &gt; Kalamazoo &gt; Ann Arbor (my town) &gt; Other Where is
        Kalamazoo? Ann Arbor? Sorry, I'm not actually from the Midwest. I would
        be interested in attending, though (I am taking too many days off from
        school as it is already, however...) &gt; Time: &gt; Same time as Dallas
        (means I won't have to go, but that requires &gt; quick action as it's
        coming soon and an OK from Tyson) &gt; September (not same weekend as
        the other tournament in Europe) &gt; October (our retaliation for not
        being able to go to Dutch cube &gt; day) &gt; November (no, it out to be
        a rule that no tournaments may be held &gt; on the same month as a WC)
        &gt; December? (maybe too soon after WC and who wants to travel around
        &gt; the holidays?) &gt; late-January (sounds evenly placed there) &gt;
        or some other time later? At the same time as Dallas seems a little soon
        since it's only a month away, and you really should advertise for it,
        hype it up, etc, ya know? I wouldn't really worry too much about
        conflicting with other tournaments since those who would attend this
        tournament would probably not already be attending a different one that
        is occuring simultaneously, right? &gt; P.S. - Is it just me, or don't
        you all think that Erno Rubik is &gt; whealthy enough he could/should
        setup an endowment fund for cube- &gt; related travel expenses. (There
        could be a committee overseeing &gt; it...) Is he really that wealthy? ~

        I *kinda* see what you mean. I was watching Tyson's bld pop last night,
        and it was freakin' hilarious. So what you say is that if an edge pops
        out, it is possible that the cuber "knows" how to place it back
        properly. So that's good I suppose. Is that allowed though? I'm not sure
        what the WCA rules and regulations say about pops during bld events.
        This needs to be spelled out I think. Actually in addition to
        reschemeing my new cubes and putting on new stickers, I organize the
        pieces such that I could tell if any cubey is orientated or not. I'm
        sure it would be frowned upon however, if one does the bld solve by
        pulling al the pieces out and placing them back in all oriented... but
        in the same permutaions.... But from what LarsP was saying, I think it's
        more serious than stickers. Other cheating is possible... certain dents
        *under* the stickers for example. Heck any cube, if I look hard enough
        could find something distinctive. I am very (and I mean very, or used to
        be) observant about certain things. I recall once I was able to get a
        run of like 50 three-card monty games due to my observational skills,
        the back of cards have slight ink blots that most poeple might not see.
        (won losts of money too :) ) So all I was trying to do was expound on
        someone else's post about the possibilities. I was careful to say this,
        when I used the word "decent" I meant for the definition to be left
        open-ended. So in this case I would say that decent means not "stiff or
        hard to use triggers on." Which is something that WCA tournaments are
        supposed to provide anyways according to the rules and regulations that
        Tyson and Ron drafted. So it *shouldn't* be overly taxing for the
        organizers. I'd like to hear some more opinions! Other takers? -Doug ---

        You can't expect any cuber to perform at his/her best without using
        one's own cube. The cube should be inspected before the solve for any
        distinctive markings, and the cuber should be watched for trying to

        three-card &gt; monty games due to my observational skills, the back of
        cards have &gt; slight ink blots that most poeple might not see. (won
        losts of money &gt; too :) ) &gt; &gt; So all I was trying to do was
        expound on someone else's post about &gt; the possibilities. &gt; &gt; I
        was careful to say this, when I used the word "decent" I meant for &gt;
        the definition to be left open-ended. So in this case I would say &gt;
        that decent means not "stiff or hard to use triggers on." &gt; &gt;
        Which is something that WCA tournaments are supposed to provide &gt;
        anyways according to the rules and regulations that Tyson and Ron &gt;
        drafted. So it *shouldn't* be overly taxing for the organizers. &gt;
        &gt; I'd like to hear some more opinions! Other takers? &gt; &gt; &gt;

        expensive the cuber's own. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This means that the cube
        will be stiff and hard to use triggers &gt; on. &gt; &gt; Also who's
        going to buy the cubes? The organizer him/herself? &gt; &gt; Stickers
        are cheaper anyway. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also you can't put your cube
        together such that if a piece pops you &gt; &gt; know how to put it back
        in. A new cube won't have your internal &gt; &gt; "system" for the
        pieces. So if you pop on a new cube you're &gt; screwed, &gt; &gt;
        rather than being able to continue on your own cube. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi all, Its seems like there are quite a few ppl who think about the
        actual WCA rules: Timers, 45° rule, stickers, scrambles, number of
        official competitions.... And this is good! Well but how can a cuber
        influence these rules? If he only has the choice of talking over the
        topic in this group he may feel his powerlessness and will get
        frustrated. Obviously some ppl arent too happy with some decisions and
        the actual power of some young and very engaged member of the WCA. At
        the same time those engaged ppl did something for us all. So we gotta be
        thankfull as well. My opinion: As quite all of us live in democratic
        systems i think it would be fair to elect the ppl who make the rules for
        us! It will be a lot of work and sure discussions will start too about
        who and how can be elected. Its time to start that discussion i think.
        So ..what do u guys think about that idea? Didn't i read something like
        "after some time for installing WCA there will be elections" a while
        ago... so ..lets do it before the rules get too solid! I d like to thank
        the WCA Members, but i also think its time to get some more democracy
        into it.

        GOOD CALL. No offense to anybody, but WCA oughta be bigger and more
        democratically elected... and personally there are a few rules I don't
        agree fully with. though after a vote the members may be exactly the

        Alright, slight misunderstanding I suppose. Seems to be lots of those
        around here. You know, we all (ESPECiALLY ME) need to try and sound more
        polite and nice around here, too many "flames" start up that make lots
        of people feel bad for no good reason. Take it easy everyone :)! And I
        do simply mean *sound* nicer, cuz I'm sure we are all nice people in
        real life, but shit happens. Misunderstandings, incorrectly read
        connotation/tone, differing styles of sarcasms, poor taste in humor, bad
        mood.... lead to making people feel *less then thrilled* about posting
        in the future. I'm sure we have driven away many members over the years
        because lots of people won't/can't put up with the un-intentional
        rudeness that occurs in fourms (not just ours, in fact the other fourms
        I'm on it's much worst). Lots of times a paritally formed idea or
        suggestion pops into our heads and before we have time to ponder it, we
        post it. Just expecting some "constructive feedback" and not to be
        attacked. Sometimes we just look the other way and think "oh he had it
        comming", but I have seen many threads run on and on... falling way off
        topic. Threads that go on forever is like X-Files running 2 seasons too
        much, nobody wants to see that happen right? Let's try to stay away from
        anything personal (i.e. personal attacks, lol). I leave myself wide open
        for personal attacks all the time in fact, :). And before you try to
        help, double check your not just fanning the flames... if in doubt don't
        post and leave room for material of substance. Over 17000 posts here,
        how many of them are worth keeping becuse they are actually useful?
        ==Benefit of the doubt, k?== Oh and to Crispy: "DUDE!, you still haven't
        told us where you'd like a tournament to be held. At least two of us
        asked, I guess you must have missed it... I want to help. I've been
        getting interested in the tournament running buisness lately." -Doug ---

        image seen by one eye already has a lot of spatial information in it,
        whereas that heard by one ear has "none". It's hard to disagree with you
        there. :) [Nevertheless, I now remember reading that people with only
        one good ear can still locate sounds to a limited extent. Perhaps
        because the frequency-dependent filtering done by the outer ear and the
        rest of the head will "colour" a complex sound, depending on the source
        direction -- at least, I cannot imagine what else could be involved.

        I don't see the point in restrict the number of competitions either. If
        some people like to do the work and organize a lot of competitions thats
        just great. I think there are quite many competitions in northern and
        middle Europe too. By the way, it would be nice with some foreign guests

        Hi Stefan and others, Thanks for your feedback. Recently we opened the
        WCA forum to discuss official regulations and other WCA subjects.
        http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum So this is the place to send
        your suggestions. I think the main problem is that WCA is not a full
        time job for us, so establishing WCA has taken more time than expected.
        I had a lot of offers for help from people, but in the end NOONE has
        done much. (Still thanks to all these nice people!) Our schedule up to a
        full establishment is: 1) finalize the 2005 version of the regulations
        (not many changes, just improvements and clarifications) 2) finalize the
        website 3) legally establish WCA For 1) we took ALL your comments on
        this group and from e-mails, and we are working on a new proposal. For
        2) I did have a little help, but noone has done what he has promised. It
        is probably too boring to do this. No problem, but it is taking more
        time. :-( For 3) we are still in the process of defining what our goals
        exactly are. In the meantime we are investigating legal actions we need
        to take care of. This is international, so more complicated than I
        thought it was. After that there can be elections. So before going
        democratic, first some people need to do the dirty work. Although I
        agree on some of your points, I recall the saying "bachelor's wives and
        maiden's children are well trained". I am very willing to retire. (4
        tournaments I am working on, my own website that is taking me a lot of
        time, actually WCA costs me a lot of money, etcetera) So anyone:
        discharge me if you can do better. But I will check whether you do
        better! :-) Do not underestimate this. Anyway, we are always looking for
        help. So if you can do something: tell me! Have fun, Ron ----- Original

        Future Hi all, Its seems like there are quite a few ppl who think about
        the actual WCA rules: Timers, 45° rule, stickers, scrambles, number of
        official competitions.... And this is good! Well but how can a cuber
        influence these rules? If he only has the choice of talking over the
        topic in this group he may feel his powerlessness and will get
        frustrated. Obviously some ppl arent too happy with some decisions and
        the actual power of some young and very engaged member of the WCA. At
        the same time those engaged ppl did something for us all. So we gotta be
        thankfull as well. My opinion: As quite all of us live in democratic
        systems i think it would be fair to elect the ppl who make the rules for
        us! It will be a lot of work and sure discussions will start too about
        who and how can be elected. Its time to start that discussion i think.
        So ..what do u guys think about that idea? Didn't i read something like
        "after some time for installing WCA there will be elections" a while
        ago... so ..lets do it before the rules get too solid! I d like to thank
        the WCA Members, but i also think its time to get some more democracy
        into it. SPONSORED LINKS Free puzzle games Computer puzzle game Jigsaw

        Tyson and I talked a couple of times and thought a tournament in the
        middle of October was the most reasonably placed. I, too, would like to
        help out however possible. We've already had one tournament in Chicago's
        suburbs, but it seemed to work well enough. I never heard of any travel
        complaints. I would also like to offer the possibility of a tournament
        in or around Minneapolis, Minnesota. It's comprable distance for me to
        Chicago, but I'm farmiliar with the area. There are lots of great
        possible venues. Somebody shoot me an email and we can perhaps plan
        something. -Mike Bennett ----- Original Message ----- From:

        Hi Ron, A year or so ago you wrote that beginning with FL followed by
        CLL you could hardly count on an average under 26 secs. Why?! A man who
        does F2L in 9s, Must (with some practising) do FL in 6s. Then CLL in 2s.
        Notice that the average lengths of the algs here are shorter than e.g.
        with Friedrich, as you have the middle slice to your disposal. Then 3
        interchanges of edges between slice and LL (à 1.5s?) followed by
        rotation in the slice.(1s) To that 2 or 3 inline moves. Where am I that
        mistaken? I agree that for me it seems incredible, but so does F2L in 9s
        as the whole cube in 15s (but nevertheless it does exist). R

        So do you guys use the same cube for BLD as your normal speed cube? I
        would gladly donate sticker or tile sets to anyone running a BLD event.
        Although it might be a pain to have to resticker your cube on the day of
        the event. &gt; &gt; Actually in addition to reschemeing my new cubes
        and putting on new &gt; &gt; stickers, I organize the pieces such that I
        could tell if any cubey &gt; &gt; is orientated or not. I don't
        understand this part, how is that possible. Do you mark the pieces on
        the inside of the cube incase of a pop? I also watched Tysons BLD pop
        from the Horrace Mann DVD and it was very funny. I instantly thought of
        how frustrating that must have been. So, do a lot of BLD solvers use a
        custom color scheme? I'm not opposed to donating a few tiled DIY
        speedcubes to the WCA to send around to tournys either. Although most
        people seem highly opposed to not using they're own cube. Anyway, let me
        know if I can help. Chris www.cubesmith.com

        Gah... why is it that I'm always providing entertainment? On a side
        note, as soon as I get a video camera, I will be sending an application
        into that Beauty and the Geek. I'm at the freakin' Very Large Array...
        that's gotta be geeky enough. I actually don't use the same cube for BLD
        as my normal speed cube but I could. My normal cube risks popping more
        and so that's why I go with a different cube for BLD. I should make the
        note that at Horace Mann, I hadn't really completed a BLD solve... ever,
        so I really wasn't sure what I was doing. I had kind of done one at the
        JFK airport while waiting for the shuttle that never came but that was
        about it. Most, if not all, cubers use the same color scheme that they
        do for speed solving. It's what we're used to. What I've done with my
        stickers is that I have the edges all facing a certain way so that when
        it pops out, I know which way to put it back in. Now, I'll be honest...
        I popped, but I was in the middle of an algorithm, and I thought about
        it, and decided heck, there's no way I was going to be able to figure
        that out on stage so I gave up. I think I might be able to do it today
        though, with more BLD experience under my belt. If you still want more
        explanation, just wait for the Toy Fair and Leyan will explain what I'm
        talking about in person. It's much more easily understood that way. I
        would consider taking pieces out and orienting them to be cheating.
        However, I would also challenge anyone to beat me on a BLD solve by
        doing that. Even J. Bernett Orlando. I'm convinced that taking out the
        necessary pieces and feeling and then putting back in would be
        disorienting, and time consuming enough that it would not provide any
        type of advantage. Orienting pieces takes maybe... 10 seconds of
        memorization at the most, and 25 seconds of execution on my part. I
        don't think we need cubes yet. As Chris Hardwick said, perhaps stickers
        are all that are necessary. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        possible. Do you mark the &gt; pieces on the inside of the cube incase
        of a pop? I also watched &gt; Tysons BLD pop from the Horrace Mann DVD
        and it was very funny. I &gt; instantly thought of how frustrating that
        must have been. &gt; &gt; So, do a lot of BLD solvers use a custom color
        scheme? I'm not opposed &gt; to donating a few tiled DIY speedcubes to
        the WCA to send around to &gt; tournys either. Although most people seem
        highly opposed to not using &gt; they're own cube. &gt; &gt; Anyway, let

        Hi Rune, Please point me out in which message I wrote this. I don't
        understand. Which system do you refer to? I can easily do F2L, then CLL,
        then ELL, probably under 18 seconds with some practice. For CLL I would
        use COLL. For ELL I would use a lot of ELL, but I forgot the hardest
        cases. For F2L, ELL, CLL this would be harder. I think there are 84
        cases for CLL then! This is what Andy Camann had learned last year. He
        did this for the last step of the interesting system of Ryan Heise. Or
        are you talking about first layer, then CLL, then last 8 edges? That
        would be like the Waterman system. Without practice it takes ages to
        solve the last 8 edges! The first two remaining edges are an easy step
        of the Waterman system, but the last two final layer edges are a lot of
        algorithms. Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message ----- From: uweren2000

        or so ago you wrote that beginning with FL followed by CLL you could
        hardly count on an average under 26 secs. Why?! A man who does F2L in
        9s, Must (with some practising) do FL in 6s. Then CLL in 2s. Notice that
        the average lengths of the algs here are shorter than e.g. with
        Friedrich, as you have the middle slice to your disposal. Then 3
        interchanges of edges between slice and LL (à 1.5s?) followed by
        rotation in the slice.(1s) To that 2 or 3 inline moves. Where am I that
        mistaken? I agree that for me it seems incredible, but so does F2L in 9s
        as the whole cube in 15s (but nevertheless it does exist). R

        Hi Stefan, That is too much honor! Luckily we have a lot of people in
        our community who either publicly or on the background help organizing
        events. But yeah, we need help. A few weeks ago I asked on this club if
        someone wanted to figure out all official records of the past.
        (1981/1982/2003/2004) Because now we only have the record history of
        2005. Noone offered helped. It is not that much work! We are all too
        busy. The thing is that TALKING about regulations is a lot of fun.
        WRITING the regulations is the hardest and not much appreciated work.
        There are so many opinions that you need to take into account. And these
        opinions are often black/white (preinspection or not, pops allowed or
        not, how to deal with penalties). And you cannot change too much, there
        must be some basic stabile principles. Any help is still appreciated.
        You posting on this subject already helped, because today we found 1
        more volunteer. :-) Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message ----- From:

        &gt; &gt; After that there can be elections. So before going democratic,
        first some people need to do the dirty work. &gt; &gt; Although I agree
        on some of your points, I recall the saying "bachelor's wives and
        maiden's children are well trained". &gt; &gt; I am very willing to
        retire. (4 tournaments I am working on, my own website that is taking me
        a lot of time, actually WCA costs me a lot of money, etcetera) &gt; So
        anyone: discharge me if you can do better. But I will check whether you
        do better! :-) Do not underestimate this. &gt; &gt; Anyway, we are
        always looking for help. So if you can do something: tell me! &gt; &gt;
        Have fun, &gt; &gt; Ron

        Hi Everyone, There are a few people out there who have accused me or
        suggested that I write rules or influence regulations for the benefit of
        myself and my friends. I would like to assure the speedcubing community
        that this is not the case and that I write rules and regulations in an
        effort to uphold the principles of speedcubing, ensure fairness
        throughout Rubik's Cube competitions, and also provide a logical
        systematic approach to tournaments. For every regulation that a member
        of the community may disagree, there is easily another person who
        agrees. It is simple; people have different opinions and no one will
        ever fully agree. If there are disagreements, I am always willing to
        listen to logical and well supported evidence supporting the new
        suggestion. However, simply the reason that a few people do not agree
        with something should not be grounds for accusing or questioning my
        personal and moral integrity. I particularly feel regret that some of
        you feel this way. However, I also feel that one has little right to
        accuse me of such acts if they have never been to any of the tournaments
        I have run. Of my friends at Caltech, only one of them is really a
        speedcuber in contention of any records or prizes. My other friends
        assist me with the tournament and have little desire to compete and are,
        at no offense to them, way too slow to even make it to the second round.
        I personally refrain from competing in the 3x3x3 speed solve competition
        because I try to focus my energy on running a fair tournament. There are
        many things I could have done to influence the results of this
        tournament; most notably, I could easily release tournament scrambles to
        my friends before the tournament. I could have easily looked and
        practiced scrambles for the Horace Mann tournament. I assure you, if
        anyone approaches me and asks me to solve a Rubik's Cube, I will be able
        to reproduce my tournament results. I am indeed a sub-18 cuber, Macky
        can average sub-15, and Leyan did indeed perform a 2:41.54 blindfolded
        solve in adherence to the spirit of all aspects of the sport of
        speedcubing and blindfold solving. Anyway, I hope the community will
        reconsider their accusations and I continue to work hard and provide the
        United States with quality events and Rubik's Cube competitions that
        respect and hold dear the ultimate ideals of fair play. If you have any
        doubts, I encourage you to contact any member of the community who has
        attended any of my tournaments. I have met many competitors just for a
        few moments and have no ties or allegiance to most of them. I also
        encourage all to attend the tournaments that I run and if any procedures
        or regulations suggest any inkling of self-thought, I encourage you to
        raise the concern with me and the public community. I have done my best
        to present the world with an honest and open competition front for the
        Rubik's Cube. After this year, I will hopefully go off for further
        academic study in astrophysics and if is the wishes of the Rubik's Cube
        community, I am more than willing to leave this all behind. Tyson Mao

        Hi Everyone, I am only a couple of steps away from confirming this
        event. Once everything is confirmed and reserved, we will make the
        proper announcements on speedcubing.com and everything. Again, it would
        be best if tournament discussion were in the Caltech groups so we don't
        destroy the INBOXes of hundreds of people around the world. Honestly
        though, I think it gives Leyan a break from looking at magnetic
        influences on squids. Actually.... SQUID. Date: Saturday, September 17,
        2005 Time: 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM Location: Crystal Springs Uplands School
        400 Uplands Drive Hillsborough, California 94010 http://www.csus.com/ We
        will do 3x3x3 speed sovling, of course, and any other events that people
        would like to compete in. I would like to compete in the 3x3x3 blindfold
        solve. As a side event, it has been suggested that we do a cube-athon. A
        cube-athon would entail solving a 2-cube, 3-cube, 4-cube, and 5-cube.
        Each time would then be compared to the world record like they do in the
        decathlon and that's how we would decide the winner. The event results
        would be listed in the results, but will not appear in the WCA official
        records. Also for this tournament, pre-registration will be required.
        The school requests that I limit the number of competitors to 25. I
        doubt that the tournament will get 25 people, but I really need to know
        in case too many people decide to come—in which case, I would beg to the
        facility officials for the allowance of more competitors. So stay tuned
        to the Caltech yahoo groups as all future announcements for this
        tournament will be in there. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        back together wrong. &gt; So, do a lot of BLD solvers use a custom color

        Hi Tyson, I want to thank you for your efforts. Im addition I appreciate
        that you went out of your way to allow me time for no inspection solves.
        Your tournaments have been fair and fun and you deserve a lot of credit.
        Forget the naysayers. I wasn't here for much of the weekend and was
        about to ask you how much of the sky is covered by a cube held at arm's
        length, and then I see that some people don't know that the way to
        balance a shortage is to increase in the shortfall areas... I am a
        little ticked off that some people are giving you a hard time. They need
        to sit down somewhere and listen to a few thousand words per second
        until what they use for thinking shuts down. Hopefully their systems
        will reset. :P Adjustable blindfolds are sold in travel stores for
        people who need dark for sleeping on planes. Regards, David J --- In

        In Sweden, I have been involved in organising three tournaments, and we
        have the upcoming Swedish Championships in September. Before each of the
        tournaments, I have been in contact with both Ron and Tyson and their
        support and help have been great. Thank you! We have also shared views
        about rules and how to conduct tournaments. I see no reason to limit the
        amount of tournaments at present. I think that we should instead be
        inspired and encouraged by Tyson and all his tournaments and start to
        arrange them at more places. Certainly, I have been inspired. One great
        thing of organising a tournament is that the organisers can decide upon
        the rules themselves. Thus, at our first tournament, the Swedish Cube
        Day 2004, we ranked people by the median value instead of the average of
        five / mean of three. Furthermore, we have, with great success, had a
        3x3x3 speedcubing event without preinspection. Such events will not at
        present be official, but I find it proper to experiment with alternative
        events in tournaments together with the official ones. Thus, I suggest
        that future organisers experiment with the format (and in particular try
        the no- preinspection event  my favourite!). BUT, please discuss it with
        WCA in advance. In addition to experiments, I also suggest that future
        organisers try to make some events of tournaments official since one
        striving force in cubing is to get into the official ranking lists. The
        issue of ranking lists also makes me suggest that all rounds in
        tournaments ought have the same format (for instance, "average of five"
        in 3x3x3 speedcubing) so all competitors can be listed in all ranking
        list regardless of their performance. Organising tournaments are fun. Do
        as Ron uses to say "Have fun"! /Anders

        and help have been great. Thank you! We have also &gt; shared views
        about rules and how to conduct tournaments. &gt; &gt; I see no reason to
        limit the amount of tournaments at present. I &gt; think that we should
        instead be inspired and encouraged by Tyson and &gt; all his tournaments
        and start to arrange them at more places. &gt; Certainly, I have been
        inspired. &gt; &gt; One great thing of organising a tournament is that
        the organisers &gt; can decide upon the rules themselves. Thus, at our
        first tournament, &gt; the Swedish Cube Day 2004, we ranked people by
        the median value &gt; instead of the average of five / mean of three.
        Furthermore, we &gt; have, with great success, had a 3x3x3 speedcubing
        event without &gt; preinspection. Such events will not at present be
        official, but I &gt; find it proper to experiment with alternative
        events in tournaments &gt; together with the official ones. Thus, I
        suggest that future &gt; organisers experiment with the format (and in
        particular try the no- &gt; preinspection event – my favourite!). BUT,
        please discuss it with &gt; WCA in advance. &gt; &gt; In addition to
        experiments, I also suggest that future organisers &gt; try to make some
        events of tournaments official since one striving &gt; force in cubing
        is to get into the official ranking lists. The issue &gt; of ranking
        lists also makes me suggest that all rounds in &gt; tournaments ought
        have the same format (for instance, "average of &gt; five" in 3x3x3
        speedcubing) so all competitors can be listed in all &gt; ranking list
        regardless of their performance. &gt; &gt; Organising tournaments are
        fun. Do as Ron uses to say "Have fun"! &gt; &gt; /Anders &gt; &gt; &gt;

        properly In fact, if you check the "Optimal" box and keep clicking the

        use it in my own puzzle-solving programs; i.e., the search always starts
        at depth 1 rather than at depth 0. On the (possible) real "bugs"... I
        have also noticed anomalies in the timings, but it doesn't bother me.
        However, when running under Windows XP I find that clearing the main

        from a few seconds to several minutes on a 1.7GHz machine with 512MB
        RAM. During all this time, C.E. is using 97-99% cpu whilst apparently
        doing nothing. The hard disk is not churning (there is plenty of memory
        free). Does anyone else have this problem with the program? If so, can
        you find any pattern in the behaviour? I can't. :( (H. Kociemba isn't

        &gt; The thing is that TALKING about regulations is a lot of fun. &gt;
        WRITING the regulations is the hardest and not much appreciated work.
        There are so many opinions that you need to take into account. That's a
        beautiful point. Even though I don't fully agree on some of the rules
        and regulations, I don't whine about it. It just piles up work for one
        or two people. People need to take action if you feel strongly enough,
        and if you don't feel so strongly about it, then complaining doesn't
        help. Democracy is going to take time; I'm satisified with what's been
        going on so far. Rules and regulations will naturally evolve and adapt
        over time. Take the time to be grateful for what others have done for
        the cubing community these last 2 years alone. -Doug

        a no-preinspection event... -Doug (trying to plan a Midwest tournament,

        have been great. Thank you! We have also &gt; shared views about rules
        and how to conduct tournaments. &gt; &gt; I see no reason to limit the
        amount of tournaments at present. I &gt; think that we should instead be
        inspired and encouraged by Tyson and &gt; all his tournaments and start
        to arrange them at more places. &gt; Certainly, I have been inspired.
        &gt; &gt; One great thing of organising a tournament is that the
        organisers &gt; can decide upon the rules themselves. Thus, at our first
        tournament, &gt; the Swedish Cube Day 2004, we ranked people by the
        median value &gt; instead of the average of five / mean of three.
        Furthermore, we &gt; have, with great success, had a 3x3x3 speedcubing
        event without &gt; preinspection. Such events will not at present be
        official, but I &gt; find it proper to experiment with alternative
        events in tournaments &gt; together with the official ones. Thus, I
        suggest that future &gt; organisers experiment with the format (and in
        particular try the no- &gt; preinspection event  my favourite!). BUT,
        please discuss it with &gt; WCA in advance. &gt; &gt; In addition to
        experiments, I also suggest that future organisers &gt; try to make some
        events of tournaments official since one striving &gt; force in cubing
        is to get into the official ranking lists. The issue &gt; of ranking
        lists also makes me suggest that all rounds in &gt; tournaments ought
        have the same format (for instance, "average of &gt; five" in 3x3x3
        speedcubing) so all competitors can be listed in all &gt; ranking list
        regardless of their performance. &gt; &gt; Organising tournaments are
        fun. Do as Ron uses to say "Have fun"! &gt; &gt; /Anders

        Hi friends, Thanks for sharing. :-) :-( Now back to cubing! Let us not

        http://www.worldcubeassocation.org/forum = help me with the WCA website
        = help us with the legal stuff of establishing WCA = create the history
        of world puzzle records before 2005 = help other cubers by making a
        great website with your ideas and systems = create the best tournament
        Excel file that people can think of (generate all sheets for all events
        with all information of all competitors, and with all correct
        calculations) = start organizing a local cube event = write a good
        scientific article that will draw LOTS of attention to our fun hobby =

        I think anyone who is wiling to organize a tournament is to be given a
        lot of respect. If these people who are complaining were to try and
        organize a tourney themselves would see that it is not an easy task. I
        am still trying to get a tournament going for Canada and I know how hard

        Hi Ron, That is, what I have found. (Maybe you wrote about 26s earlier).
        OK, step 1 You should do in 6s. Step 2 (CLL?) You should do in 2s. Step
        5 is skipped, as you flip the pieces in the middle slice in steps 3 and
        4. In short, I think You (with practising) could do the cube in 15s with
        this system. R Hi friendz, Just to let you know that I started solving
        corners first a week after the WC 2003. My expectation is that I cannot
        beat my CFOP (cross/F2L/OLL/PLL) record with it. I do think that it will
        give me more experience to improve my times for more advanced CFOP
        systems. The corners first system I currently use is: 1) first layer
        (systematically) 2) corners of last layer (algorithms) 3) two edges of
        last layer (algorithms) 4) last two edges of last layer (algorithms) 5)
        orient middle layer edges (algorithms) 6) permute middle layer edges
        (algorithms) This is basically the Waterman system without combining
        step 4 and 5. For combining these steps you need to learn table 3 and 4
        of the Waterman system. These are tough ones! Slowly I am working my way
        through the tables, but it will take me some more time. At the moment,
        exactly one month after starting corners first, my normal averages are
        sub 24 seconds, with a best of 23.1 seconds: 20 (29) 25 24 22 20 20 26
        23 23 23 (19). I am finally getting used to keeping the last layer on
        the right and finishing off the cube using only R, U and M moves. I am
        surprised that using this system I only take on average 10 slice moves
        per cube. Anyway: corners first is fun! Have fun, Ron

        Just a quick reality check... How many of you would come to a tournament
        (assuming it doesn't conflict with another US tournamnet or Dutch Cube
        Day and is on a weekend during the academic year), held in Ann Arbor
        Michigan?, which is 40 minutes west of Detroit for those who don't know.
        venue: The University of Michigan room: decided soon, trying to reserve
        funding: University of Michigan, possibly rubiks.com, possibly
        cubesmith.com, entry fee Thus instead of called "Midwest Tournament" it
        will be called the "First [Annual] University of Michigan Cube Off." And
        oh yes, there will be an entry fee attached. I can't be going broke over
        this :). I need a least 20 entries, early registration appriciated (once
        I properly arrange enough to publicize the date). Macky, PLZ come!
        Pretty please? -Doug

        hey, my dad was just on a business trip in Europe, and he knows how I
        like puzzles, so he brought back a newspaper with a new puzzle in it

        more recently they've started posting it in the Washington Post, USA

        that's divided into 9 smaller squares, which are each divided into 9

        The American Regions Mathematics Competitions a competition at three
        simultaneous sites. One thought Doug and I were entertaining was to hold
        the University of Michigan tournament at the same time as the Caltech
        Fall. The tournaments would essentially be the same tournament—same
        scrambles and everything. In which case, we would have site winners, and
        also overall winners. Computers would be used to compile scores. Tyson

        I have two Rubik's Deluxe Game Cubes and one Deluxe Cube. They are both
        the same as far as I know, except for th e fact that one has peg holes
        in it to (so you can play a few games that they teach you to play). The
        peg holes are used to put pegs in them (duh -_-X). The feel of both
        cubes are the same (because everything but the tiles are different). As
        speedcubers, the pro and con of the Game Cube is that it is easier to
        grip (the holes catch onto your fingers), but all the holes takes a
        while to get used to. Oh yeah, and to answer Bryan's question, no it is
        not a piece of crap. It's hell good =], but heavier and feels bigger.

        dad was just on a business trip in Europe, and he knows how I like &gt;
        puzzles, so he brought back a newspaper with a new puzzle in it called
        &gt; Sudoku. apparently it's become really really popular in Japan, and
        &gt; they publish it in the newspaper every week with the crossword. and
        &gt; more recently they've started posting it in the Washington Post,
        USA &gt; Today, etc.... &gt; anyway, it's a very interesting puzzle.
        it's a square that's divided &gt; into 9 smaller squares, which are each
        divided into 9 more smaller &gt; squares, so there's 81 smaller squares.
        some of them are already &gt; filled with random numbers, and you have
        to fill in the rest of them &gt; so that each row, column, and separate
        3x3 square has the numbers 1-9 &gt; in it. &gt; I knew some of you would

        &gt; &gt; hey, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my dad was just on a business trip in
        Europe, and he knows how I like &gt; &gt; puzzles, so he brought back a
        newspaper with a new puzzle in it called &gt; &gt; Sudoku. apparently
        it's become really really popular in Japan, and &gt; &gt; they publish
        it in the newspaper every week with the crossword. and &gt; &gt; more
        recently they've started posting it in the Washington Post, USA &gt;
        &gt; Today, etc.... &gt; &gt; anyway, it's a very interesting puzzle.
        it's a square that's divided &gt; &gt; into 9 smaller squares, which are
        each divided into 9 more smaller &gt; &gt; squares, so there's 81
        smaller squares. some of them are already &gt; &gt; filled with random
        numbers, and you have to fill in the rest of them &gt; &gt; so that each
        row, column, and separate 3x3 square has the numbers 1-9 &gt; &gt; in
        it. &gt; &gt; I knew some of you would be interested in it, so decided
        to share. &gt; &gt; here's a wiki article on it: &gt; &gt;

        Hey guys, With the Dallas tourney approaching quickly and me with no
        experience at a stackmat I decided to do something about it so I
        wouldn't be caught totally unawares. A quick look at the bank account
        said "You're buying a stackmat? Riiiiiiiiiiight." And a quick look at
        the twistypuzzles forum gave me a kick in the rear to attempt to make my
        own. So after 1 night of slamming my head against a desk in desperation,
        and one afternoon of much of the same I have my finished product. It is
        ugly as all hell and doesn't function *exactly* like a stackmat, but at
        least I'll have a bit of the feel down. The best part is it only cost me
        $5 for a stopwatch and about $3 in parts I had lying around the house.
        The touch pads are sensitive enough to one person touch one, another
        person touch the other and then any contact between the two people will
        start the time (makes me think of the team solving vid I saw earlier,
        very cool btw). The only thing I'd like to do to it at this point is
        make it so that the timer starts on release instead of on contact. As it
        is now, the start and stop happen immediately upon touching the pads.
        Without further ado, here is the vid of the ugly thing in action!

        Just catching up on the last few days of posts and wow there were a
        lot!! (haven't finished reading them all yet!) Anyway, I want to add a
        few of my own thoughts about the frequency of California-based comps...
        I think it's fantastic that Tyson and others have put in so much time
        and effort to organise so many comps. I'm constantly impressed with how
        Tyson manages to do so much for the speedcubing community and still (I
        assume??) get through all his non-cubing stuff (astronomy, violin and
        whatever else he does). It doesn't bother me in the slightest that there
        are more official competitions in and around California than in other
        places. I would be sad to see this limited by anything other than
        Tyson's availability, even if I can't ever compete at any Caltech comps.
        Personally, I think it's great to see lots of official competitions
        happening and I don't really care where they are or if I can attend.
        More competitions means more publicity for speedcubing! The fact that
        Tyson (and others) organise comps voluntarily means that we should all
        be thankful for their hard work. I know I wouldn't be able to commit the
        time and effort to organise a comp myself, and so if not for the
        volunteers then I'd never have the opportunity to compete in anything
        anywhere. If organising competitions was *paid* work and the organisors
        chose to always focus the comps in the same city/state, then yes, there
        probably would be grounds for complaining, but as long as it's unpaid
        voluntary work then I'm just happy that there are competitions
        happening, wherever they might be! BTW, if you think you have a long way
        to travel to competitions... I'm Australian and I competed at the World
        Champs in Toronto. According to an online distance tool I just googled,
        that's 15815kms (9828 miles) away. I also went to the US Nationals
        (12334kms/7665 miles away). So if you think the comps are too far away,
        think about all the people in the southern hemisphere. I don't think
        there has ever been a single official competition south of the equator!

        You know you've been cubing too much when... ... you're at a restaurant
        and doing a speedcubing demo for a friend and the waiter comes over and
        is so impressed that he offers you a free drink and then at the end of
        the evening brings his own cube (which he happened to have in his bag)
        to you and asks you to autograph it and says that he recognises you from
        a news article in the local paper! ... you're at a different restaurant
        with a different friend in a different city and end up doing a
        speedcubing demo for all the staff, and the waitress with the cube
        t-shirt is so impressed by the demo that she gives you her t-shirt (no,
        this is not an x-rated story - she had two tops on, the cube t-shirt was
        the outer layer) ... you're at an airport cafe drinking coffee and
        cubing and waiting for a connecting flight and end up being asked to
        demo the cube to all the staff at the cafe (Yes, these all did happen to
        me - btw, the connecting flight I was waiting for was on my way back
        from RWC2003!) Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hey, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my
        dad was just on a business trip in Europe, and he knows how I &gt; like
        &gt; &gt; &gt; puzzles, so he brought back a newspaper with a new puzzle
        in it &gt; called &gt; &gt; &gt; Sudoku. apparently it's become really
        really popular in Japan, &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; they publish it in the
        newspaper every week with the crossword. &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; more
        recently they've started posting it in the Washington Post, &gt; USA
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Today, etc.... &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway, it's a very
        interesting puzzle. it's a square that's &gt; divided &gt; &gt; &gt;
        into 9 smaller squares, which are each divided into 9 more &gt; smaller
        &gt; &gt; &gt; squares, so there's 81 smaller squares. some of them are
        already &gt; &gt; &gt; filled with random numbers, and you have to fill
        in the rest of &gt; them &gt; &gt; &gt; so that each row, column, and
        separate 3x3 square has the &gt; numbers 1-9 &gt; &gt; &gt; in it. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I knew some of you would be interested in it, so decided to
        &gt; share. &gt; &gt; &gt; here's a wiki article on it: &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Ya a couple nights ago, me and DanH was discussing this as well. I have
        a rediculous standard deviation I though... these days I get times over
        30s occasioanlly and my fast times are even faster, I get 13s solves as
        well. So according to DanH (and i"m now inclined to agree), one *should*
        target a 10% SD. This is a "rule of thumb" similar to say... in tennis
        how your supposed to be at 80% on your first serve. (Just did 100 serves
        tonight btw, and then spent 20 minutes drenched in the rain, probably
        wake up with a cold....) Thus it comes to reason that if you are overly
        consistant, to risk more for the fast times, and to try to be more
        consistant (i.e. mistakes in terms of recognition, wrong alg execution,
        and lock-ups) by going a little be slower at first and then build up
        speed in a reasonable manner. -Doug --- In

        &gt; If organising competitions was *paid* work and the organisors chose
        to &gt; always focus the comps in the same city/state, then yes, there
        &gt; probably would be grounds for complaining, but as long as it's
        unpaid &gt; voluntary work then I'm just happy that there are
        competitions &gt; happening, wherever they might be! Excellent point! So
        &gt; if you think the comps are too far away, think about all the people

        yep. very possible. several people seem to have done it just today. if
        you keep at it long enough you'll get it and then you'll wonder why it
        took you so long... --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        group] Sudoku &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hey,
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my dad was just on a business
        trip in Europe, and he knows how &gt; I &gt; &gt; like &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; puzzles, so he brought back a newspaper with a new puzzle in &gt;
        it &gt; &gt; called &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sudoku. apparently it's become
        really really popular in &gt; Japan, &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        they publish it in the newspaper every week with the &gt; crossword.
        &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more recently they've started posting
        it in the Washington &gt; Post, &gt; &gt; USA &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today,
        etc.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway, it's a very interesting puzzle. it's
        a square that's &gt; &gt; divided &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into 9 smaller
        squares, which are each divided into 9 more &gt; &gt; smaller &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; squares, so there's 81 smaller squares. some of them are &gt;
        already &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; filled with random numbers, and you have to
        fill in the rest &gt; of &gt; &gt; them &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so that each
        row, column, and separate 3x3 square has the &gt; &gt; numbers 1-9 &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; in it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I knew some of you would be
        interested in it, so decided to &gt; &gt; share. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        here's a wiki article on it: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I think I have been the only competitor from down south at comps in
        recent years, but only because the comps are so far away! :) There are
        definitely other cubers in Oz! If there was a comp in Sydney or
        Melbourne then I'm sure we'd discover other cubers. Maybe even some New
        Zealand cubers?? Never met or heard of any cubers from New Zealand.

        cubing group] Sudoku &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; hey, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my
        dad was just on a business trip in Europe, and he knows &gt; how &gt;
        &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; like &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; puzzles, so he
        brought back a newspaper with a new puzzle in &gt; &gt; it &gt; &gt;
        &gt; called &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sudoku. apparently it's become
        really really popular in &gt; &gt; Japan, &gt; &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; they publish it in the newspaper every week with the &gt;
        &gt; crossword. &gt; &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more
        recently they've started posting it in the Washington &gt; &gt; Post,
        &gt; &gt; &gt; USA &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today, etc.... &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway, it's a very interesting puzzle. it's a square
        &gt; that's &gt; &gt; &gt; divided &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into 9
        smaller squares, which are each divided into 9 more &gt; &gt; &gt;
        smaller &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; squares, so there's 81 smaller squares.
        some of them are &gt; &gt; already &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; filled with
        random numbers, and you have to fill in the rest &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt;
        &gt; them &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so that each row, column, and
        separate 3x3 square has the &gt; &gt; &gt; numbers 1-9 &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; in it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I knew some of you would be
        interested in it, so decided to &gt; &gt; &gt; share. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; here's a wiki article on it: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        And there are cubes in several Simpsons episodes. In the episode where
        Homer removes a crayon out of his nose, he becomes very smart and solves
        a lot of cubes. I'm quite impressed because he only needs about five
        turns for each cube. /Gunnar --- In

        shots for level 36. I found the cheat solution by accident (the block in
        question can actually be dragged completely off the board, so the first
        time I tried to move it, it went at an odd angle - so that's how I found
        out). I thought the puzzle was impossible and this was their clever
        trick to make you have to realize which block made it impossible, but
        there is a regular solution, I've included that screenshot too. How to
        cheat level 36 http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/36cheatsoln.jpg The
        regular solution to level 36 http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/36soln.jpg

        ... u &gt; might as well practice all the 40 levels for speed. Can u
        manage all &gt; levels in say less than 20 minutes? Yes i know there is

        I wonder why cartoon characters always have only 4 fingers. Is it harder
        to draw five fingers? And which finger is missing. Probably the pinky.

        I like videos!! That's why I decided to make a video database for all
        speedsolving videos. It's fully searchable by first name, last name,
        puzzle type, and the time of the solve (like less than 20 seconds or
        something). I went ahead and uploaded 68 3x3x3 speedsolving videos
        already (just the ones I had in random places on my harddrive). Please
        check it out and submit your videos! All you do is goto the videos
        section fill out the form which includes your name, puzzle type, time of
        solve, and a URL that I can download the video from. Once I download the
        video and add it to the database, it's stored on my server. I have 3gig
        of storage and I want to fill it up! Please make me have to buy more

        Great job with the ability to search! I really like that database. A
        couple of things I was thinking about: 1) You might want to ask Ian
        Winokur before you start ripping videos from the DVD he made. He and
        Raul Garcia put a lot of time into making that look extraordinary, and
        I'd hate to see someone not buy the DVD since they could just download
        all the videos. However, he might say that its completely fine to do so,
        but I think you should get his permission. 2) I think it would be nice
        to have a naming convention for the videos. For instance, the names I
        use for the videos I download is "PuzzleType Time
        NameOfPerson.extension". So for instance, I have "3x3x3 12'11 Shotaro
        'Macky' Makisumi.wmv". This way, when I have all the videos in my one
        folder, all the puzzles are grouped together, then listed in order of
        time. It's not a huge deal, but it would be nice. Thanks again for the
        site, I look forward to utilizing it! -Chris Parlette --- In

        idea. I thought about that too, but I worry about file names getting too
        large. I have a couple ghetto computers in my house that don't like
        files with names larger than 8 (or so) characters. The numbering system
        I use is also automated so it makes it a little easier for me to add
        more videos to the database. I'm working on trying to do something like
        that though. -Chris

        search! I really like that database. A &gt;&gt; couple of things I was
        thinking about: &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 1) You might want to ask Ian Winokur
        before you start ripping videos &gt;&gt; from the DVD he made. He and
        Raul Garcia put a lot of time into &gt;&gt; making that look
        extraordinary, and I'd hate to see someone not buy &gt;&gt; the DVD
        since they could just download all the videos. However, he &gt;&gt;
        might say that its completely fine to do so, but I think you should
        &gt;&gt; get his permission. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) I think it would be
        nice to have a naming convention for the &gt;&gt; videos. For instance,
        the names I use for the videos I download is &gt;&gt; "PuzzleType Time
        NameOfPerson.extension". So for instance, I have &gt;&gt; "3x3x3 12'11
        Shotaro 'Macky' Makisumi.wmv". This way, when I have all &gt;&gt; the
        videos in my one folder, all the puzzles are grouped together, &gt;&gt;
        then listed in order of time. It's not a huge deal, but it would be
        &gt;&gt; nice. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks again for the site, I look
        forward to utilizing it! &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -Chris Parlette &gt;&gt;

        basically, standard deviation is how far one deviates on average from
        their average. so like nascarjon2001 averages 15-16 with a std dev of
        .5-1.5, which means that on average, he is .5-1.5 above or below 15-16.

        &gt; don't like files with names larger than 8 (or so) characters. The

        &gt; easier for me to add more videos to the database. I'm working on
        &gt; trying to do something like that though. &gt; &gt; -Chris &gt; &gt;

        with the ability to search! I really like that &gt; database. A &gt;
        &gt;&gt; couple of things I was thinking about: &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; 1) You might want to ask Ian Winokur before you start ripping
        &gt; videos &gt; &gt;&gt; from the DVD he made. He and Raul Garcia put a
        lot of time into &gt; &gt;&gt; making that look extraordinary, and I'd
        hate to see someone not buy &gt; &gt;&gt; the DVD since they could just
        download all the videos. However, he &gt; &gt;&gt; might say that its
        completely fine to do so, but I think you should &gt; &gt;&gt; get his
        permission. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2) I think it would be nice to
        have a naming convention for the &gt; &gt;&gt; videos. For instance, the
        names I use for the videos I download is &gt; &gt;&gt; "PuzzleType Time
        NameOfPerson.extension". So for instance, I have &gt; &gt;&gt; "3x3x3
        12'11 Shotaro 'Macky' Makisumi.wmv". This way, when I &gt; have all &gt;
        &gt;&gt; the videos in my one folder, all the puzzles are grouped
        together, &gt; &gt;&gt; then listed in order of time. It's not a huge
        deal, but it &gt; would be &gt; &gt;&gt; nice. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; Thanks again for the site, I look forward to utilizing it! &gt;

        Chris, I'm the unofficial Pyramorphix record holder, would you like to
        host a video of that? I'm sure I can get an 11 or so nonlucky time.

        Wow looks like it turns much better than my 5x5... I can't believe my
        eyes, how the heck is it even possible (from a mechanical pov)? Well I
        definately think that to be even more convincing the guy should of
        scrambled it up fully. Doing those turns and then undoing.... it doesn't
        have the same impact. For all I know, he's able to cheat the system, and

        beyond a couple simple turns. I would have at least liked to see him put
        a checkerboard pattern on it.... oh wait, that's right, even cubes don't
        admit good checkerboards. Ok, I want one. I want to take it apart and
        see how he does it... then again it might be too complicated and I
        wouldn't be able to put it back together. Though I'm sure Ton is doing

        Wow :D It's not fair to publish a video like that when im trying to
        finish my master theses by sept 1st :-( Now i'm getting desperate to lay
        my hands on a beauty like that ;-) It seems to turn quite nicely indeed.
        My guess is that it's possible to solve it in less than 4 minutes at
        least. Maybe even sub 3 if turning is really smooth. Or would i not dare
        push it to it's limits? Hmmm ... I hope it's as light as it seems on the
        video. Also i hope it has no fragile pieces like the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5
        does. Oh well, we'll see ... :D :D Panayotis, are u reading this group?
        Will this beauty (or other even larger ones) go into mass production any
        time soon? And in that case would u have any idea what the price would
        be? Im willing to pay at least £50 for a puzzle like that. At least if
        the quality is good. Hmm okay Chris already asked those obvious
        questions :-P Awesome video !!! Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        Due to the certainty of this tournament now that I have a few
        cofirmations from people that will be comming a rather long way to
        participate, I have decided that due this effort and financial concerns
        I can no longer attend the Dallas tournament. Sorry... Also I was trying
        to reserve a couple dorm rooms for poeple that would prefer that over
        hotel (better situated since there are no nearby hotels, and much more
        affordable). But then I realized, ops it's not going to be summer
        anymore. So it looks like I'll be looking around for a centralized
        hotel/motel for you guys. It has to be cheap and close by, though I can
        have my sister run a quick shuttle service between the hotel and
        competition building... as well as Airport and hotel. Today I was able
        to recruit one more volenteer (judges/scramblers/timers) for it (during
        an hr of intense soccer). And then another on AIM (the guy that
        approched me about building a cube robot a few months ago). The current
        progress on this is about 1 new person a day on average. Thus it's
        starting come together on the informal side.... now for the legal side.
        Going into student organizations office to discuss the feisibility of it
        all is NOT something I loook forward to doing this week (was gonna be
        today, but a friend dropped by and we walked the mall for hrs). On a
        lighter note, I beat Gridlock (lvl 31 took 3-4hrs, lvls 36 and 40 long
        too, all the rest flew through), and so decided to try some Sudoku, I
        htought it was rather hard and couldn't do it at first, but then I red
        the rules :). Besides columns and rows there's also the 3x3 regions...
        well I rapidly did an easy one. And then did one on "insane/evil"
        difficuilty, and am now temporarily severly addicted. I was even working
        on a "speed-sudoku" method :). One quote I find a bit disturbing though:
        "The immense popularity of Sudoku in British newspapers and
        internationally has led to it being dubbed in the world media in 2005
        variously as "the Rubik's cube of the 21st century" or the "fastest
        growing puzzle in the world"." (source: wikipedia) -Doug p.s. Hope to
        see somebody in NY [c.f. my last post], and many thanks to those that
        have already made plans to attend my event

        Hi everyone, I have been cleaning my cubes today. I use silicone spray
        lube to make the puzzles turn faster, and this is easy to clean off.
        When I open up the cube, I have to clean this grey gunky stuff, looks
        like a mix of dust and lube, with a texture slightly more viscous than
        graphite. Trouble is, some parts are very hard to reach. This happens in
        2 places: 1) Inside the edge pieces. The gunk is quite thick here, and
        on previous cleanings I think I've been a bit lazy and just rubbed the
        pieces a bit with a kitchen towel. Is it important to also remove the
        gunk inside the edge pieces? These areas, as far as I can see, don't
        come into contact with anything else, but they might add extra weight to
        each piece or something, I dunno hehe 2) Inbetween the centre piece of
        plastic, and the axles of each cube "arm". I think it must be very
        important to remove this, because these two areas are rotating against
        each other all the time during a solve. It's extremely fiddly to get in
        there, I need about 4 hands. I was just now going to take the whole
        centre-piece structure apart (a bit reluctant because I was worried that
        I might not find the correct spring tensions when I put it back
        together), and I found it was riveted together, so I can't even
        de-construct it. Do you have any tips for cleaning in these areas? And
        cleaning the cube in general :) Thanks, Dan Harris :)

        use a little toothbrush to reach and clean the 90 degree center part,
        wet with a little soap and water. then let it dry. this way you do not
        need to screw off the skeleton... i think the edge pieces do not need

        well I &gt; rapidly did an easy one. And then did one on "insane/evil"
        &gt; difficuilty, and am now temporarily severly addicted. &gt; &gt; I
        was even working on a "speed-sudoku" method :). &gt; &gt; One quote I
        find a bit disturbing though: "The immense popularity of &gt; Sudoku in
        British newspapers and internationally has led to it being &gt; dubbed
        in the world media in 2005 variously as "the Rubik's cube of &gt; the
        21st century" or the "fastest growing puzzle in the world"." &gt;

        The toothbrush is a brilliant idea. Just make sure you know which
        toothbrush is your cube brush and which one is for your teeth. I always
        found the residue as a mild skin irritant and so the tooth brush
        definitely helps protects my hands. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi everyone, &gt; &gt; I have been cleaning my cubes
        today. I use silicone spray lube to &gt; make &gt; the puzzles turn
        faster, and this is easy to clean off. &gt; &gt; When I open up the
        cube, I have to clean this grey gunky stuff, looks &gt; like a mix of
        dust and lube, with a texture slightly more viscous &gt; than &gt;
        graphite. &gt; &gt; Trouble is, some parts are very hard to reach. This
        happens in 2 &gt; places: 1) Inside the edge pieces. The gunk is quite
        thick here, and &gt; on previous cleanings I think I've been a bit lazy
        and just rubbed &gt; the &gt; pieces a bit with a kitchen towel. Is it
        important to also remove the &gt; gunk inside the edge pieces? These
        areas, as far as I can see, don't &gt; come into contact with anything
        else, but they might add extra weight &gt; to each piece or something, I
        dunno hehe &gt; &gt; 2) Inbetween the centre piece of plastic, and the
        axles of each cube &gt; "arm". I think it must be very important to
        remove this, because &gt; these &gt; two areas are rotating against each
        other all the time during a &gt; solve. &gt; It's extremely fiddly to
        get in there, I need about 4 hands. I was &gt; just now going to take
        the whole centre-piece structure apart (a bit &gt; reluctant because I
        was worried that I might not find the correct &gt; spring tensions when
        I put it back together), and I found it was &gt; riveted together, so I
        can't even de-construct it. &gt; &gt; Do you have any tips for cleaning
        in these areas? And cleaning the &gt; cube in general :) &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; Tyson Mao &gt; MSC #631 &gt; California Institute of
        Technology That video is actually pretty funny, thanks for bringing that
        to my attention. But it is in the "laughing with you not at you" kind of
        way. In regards to the strangepuzzle.com site, and the video section in
        particular, I wanted to throw out a suggestion or two. Of course I don't
        know what database you are using, but is it possible for you to change
        your query to use something like _select * from [table] where FirstName
        like `%@FName%'_ and the same for the last name as well? That way if you
        put in "Jeff" you would get results for "Jeffery" (if there is even such
        a cuber). Also, can you take off the restriction that you must put
        either a first or last name? It would be nice to just see every thing
        you have, as it is difficult to think of who you want to see, but if the
        list was just available it would be easier to decide. But aside from my
        requests, it is an excellent idea, and the site looks very nice. Great
        work and thank you for putting in the time, money and effort. -Dave

        the lower-order cubes could rival other cubes already in production in

        planning on going that far, it was just planning on the day and looking

        &gt; In regards to the strangepuzzle.com site, and the video section in
        &gt; particular, I wanted to throw out a suggestion or two. Of course I
        &gt; don't know what database you are using, but is it possible for you
        &gt; to change your query to use something like _select * from [table]
        &gt; where FirstName like `%@FName%'_ and the same for the last name as
        &gt; well? That way if you put in "Jeff" you would get results &gt; for
        "Jeffery" (if there is even such a cuber). Also, can you take &gt; off
        the restriction that you must put either a first or last name? &gt; It
        would be nice to just see every thing you have, as it is &gt; difficult
        to think of who you want to see, but if the list was just &gt; available
        it would be easier to decide. Great ideas. The latter I just finished
        this afternoon. You can now browse all videos in a given puzzle catagory
        by selecting the puzzle type and pressing 'search videos'. I'll
        implement the regular expression evaluation later tonight, hopefully.
        &gt; But aside from my requests, it is an excellent idea, and the site
        &gt; looks very nice. Great work and thank you for putting in the time,
        &gt; money and effort. Thanks a lot. I spent a while working on the page
        and I'm very very happy that people are enjoying the service. You can
        thank me by sending in videos :) Have a nice day! -Chris

        I use Q-tips in all those places. I do clean the the inside of the edges
        and that little hole on the corners because I just have this feeling
        that once I lube the cube the gunk will drip out onto all the pieces I
        just cleaned. I don't know, sometimes I'm too compulsive. --- In

        I use silicone spray lube to make &gt; the puzzles turn faster, and this
        is easy to clean off. &gt; &gt; When I open up the cube, I have to clean
        this grey gunky stuff, looks &gt; like a mix of dust and lube, with a
        texture slightly more viscous than &gt; graphite. &gt; &gt; Trouble is,
        some parts are very hard to reach. This happens in 2 &gt; places: 1)
        Inside the edge pieces. The gunk is quite thick here, and &gt; on
        previous cleanings I think I've been a bit lazy and just rubbed the &gt;
        pieces a bit with a kitchen towel. Is it important to also remove the
        &gt; gunk inside the edge pieces? These areas, as far as I can see,
        don't &gt; come into contact with anything else, but they might add
        extra weight &gt; to each piece or something, I dunno hehe &gt; &gt; 2)
        Inbetween the centre piece of plastic, and the axles of each cube &gt;
        "arm". I think it must be very important to remove this, because these
        &gt; two areas are rotating against each other all the time during a
        solve. &gt; It's extremely fiddly to get in there, I need about 4 hands.
        I was &gt; just now going to take the whole centre-piece structure apart
        (a bit &gt; reluctant because I was worried that I might not find the
        correct &gt; spring tensions when I put it back together), and I found
        it was &gt; riveted together, so I can't even de-construct it. &gt; &gt;
        Do you have any tips for cleaning in these areas? And cleaning the &gt;
        cube in general :) &gt; &gt; Thanks, &gt; &gt; Dan Harris :)

        the solve (like less than 20 seconds or &gt; something). &gt; &gt; I
        went ahead and uploaded 68 3x3x3 speedsolving videos already (just &gt;

        out &gt; the form which includes your name, puzzle type, time of solve,
        and a &gt; URL that I can download the video from. Once I download the
        video and &gt; add it to the database, it's stored on my server. I have
        3gig of &gt; storage and I want to fill it up! Please make me have to

        Absolutely. I would hate to undermine all their hard work. I also &gt;
        &gt; encourage anyone who sees their videos on my site and doesn't want
        &gt; &gt; them there, let me know!! I just uploaded all the videos that
        I had &gt; &gt; laying around and don't want anyone to have videos up
        there that they &gt; &gt; don't want me hosting. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 2) I think it would be nice to have a naming convention for the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; videos. For instance, the names I use for the videos I
        download is &gt; &gt; &gt; "PuzzleType Time NameOfPerson.extension". So
        for instance, I have &gt; &gt; &gt; "3x3x3 12'11 Shotaro 'Macky'
        Makisumi.wmv". This way, when I &gt; &gt; have all &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        videos in my one folder, all the puzzles are grouped together, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; then listed in order of time. It's not a huge deal, but it would be
        &gt; &gt; &gt; nice. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice idea. I thought about that
        too, but I worry about file names &gt; &gt; getting too large. I have a
        couple ghetto computers in my house that &gt; &gt; don't like files with
        names larger than 8 (or so) characters. The &gt; &gt; numbering system I
        use is also automated so it makes it a little &gt; &gt; easier for me to
        add more videos to the database. I'm working on &gt; &gt; trying to do
        something like that though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Chris &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Albany is about 2 1/2 hours away from me I
        believe (I live in &gt; &gt; North &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jersey,
        about 15 mins. from Manhattan). It really depends on &gt; &gt; what my
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plans look like, but I'm not one to typically
        turn down a cube &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gathering. :P &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Nice idea Joël. Part time hacker, full time cuber? But the better

        Actually, they draw it that way because years ago, animators had to draw
        everything by hand and draw several pages. This often took several
        hours. So sometimes animators took shortcuts by only drawing 4 fingers
        on characters, and drawing characters with less details. Now they often
        use computers for animation, but they still keep the "4 finger
        tradition". Andreas ;) --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; Having to draw the outlines of fingers makes 5 fingers look awkward

        name and 30 for the last name is fine. If someone comes along with a

        Hi Gunnar, Yesterday I received a videocd of J. Bernett solving 3x3x3
        and 5x5x5 blindfolded. It appeared that he was sometimes peeking during
        the solve. Therefore I removed his records. Now he needs to solve the
        cubes behind a barrier, so that he cannot peek. With his father watching
        carefully. Under these strict conditions he already solved 3x3x3 and
        4x4x4 blindfolded. But he was still feeling very insecure, that is why
        his times are much worse. We are definitely sure that he can solve 3x3x3
        blindfolded within 3 minutes. Let us follow his progress back to the
        top. Isn't it great that a 9 year old can solve 3x3x3 and 4x4x4
        blindfolded? Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message ----- From: Gunnar

        &gt; Under these strict conditions he already solved 3x3x3 and 4x4x4

        too! That's true. It seems to be in just about every newspaper here
        (Times (and Samurai), Independent (and 16x16), Guardian, Mail, Sun, TV
        guides, mobile phones (not that the latter is a newspaper) . Who knows,
        even the Sport - not a newspaper either, arguably - might have it
        (probably a 1x1 version, if they do)? &gt; Not too hard but quite
        addictive! Some can be quite challenging: here's a good site:
        http://sudoku.sourceforge.net/ This one, from that page (Brain Of
        Britain section), is supposed to be quite hard (you can get a similar
        puzzle replacing the middle 4 with 7). It took longer than usual and I
        had to invent myself a new technique about halfway through: . 2 . * . .
        . * . . . . . . * 6 . . * . . 3 . 7 4 * . 8 . * . . .
        ********************** . . . * . . 3 * . . 2 . 8 . * . 4 . * . 1 . 6 . .
        * 5 . . * . . . ********************** . . . * . 1 . * 7 8 . 5 . . * . .
        9 * . . . . . . * . . . * . 4 . It didn't paste well above, but it is
        worth a shot. It can all be done without trial-and-error, which is
        technically logical (being a finite puzzle) although the computer solver
        on the same site has to guess! - I guess it just doesn't have enough
        methods. Have a go at it - you definitely don't need anything
        extraordinary but it is tricky nonetheless. On a related topic with all
        the exposure it has over here I was naturally drawn to think up a
        related problem - it will need some terminology which is effectively
        just formalizing Sudoku terms to get everything on the same level of
        understanding. A clueset will be an assignment of clues to a subset of
        the squares (a function from some subset of n^2xn^2 to n, mathematically
        speaking). Given 2 clusets f and g, if f is a subset of g, f is a
        subclueset of g and g is a superclueset of f. f is row-feasible if it
        satisfies the row condition (the restriction of f to each row is 1 to 1
        or injective). Similarly we define column feasibility and
        box-feasibility relating to the other conditions and feasibility
        regarding all 3 conditions holding at once. A clueset will be a solution
        if it is feasible and assigns clues to every square (has fulll domain
        n^2*n^2). A clueset is consistent if it admits a solution superclueset.
        (NB Feasibility does not imply consistency.) A clueset is inconsistent
        if it is not consistent. A Sudoku puzzle is then a clueset which admits
        a unique solution superclueset. A Sudoku puzzle such that no proper
        subclueset is a Sudoku puzzle would then be a good Sudoku puzzle (in the
        sense of not having superfluous clues). So we define (two defiinitions
        at once): a (good) Sudon'tku puzzle is an inconsistent clueset such that
        every proper clueset is consistent and such that every subclueset
        omitting just one clue is a (good) Sudoku puzzle. So the questions are:
        are there any Sudon'tku puzzles (and if so what are the restrictions on
        n - clearly n must be &gt;1, but are there other restrictions). are
        there any good Sudon'tku puzzles (ditto)? Presumably it would be too
        hard to determine the answer for n=2 (by example if affirmative or an
        exhaustive search if negative, though a better argument would be
        preferable. Clearly we could start off by looking at all (good) Sudoku
        puzzles and then extending inconsistently by one clue and seeing if the
        result satisfied the conditions but perhaps there is a better way. &gt;

        &gt; &gt; hey, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my dad was just on a business trip in
        Europe, and he knows how I like &gt; &gt; puzzles, so he brought back a
        newspaper with a new puzzle in it called &gt; &gt; Sudoku. apparently
        it's become really really popular in Japan, and &gt; &gt; they publish
        it in the newspaper every week with the crossword. and &gt; &gt; more
        recently they've started posting it in the Washington Post, USA &gt;
        &gt; Today, etc.... &gt; &gt; anyway, it's a very interesting puzzle.
        it's a square that's divided &gt; &gt; into 9 smaller squares, which are
        each divided into 9 more smaller &gt; &gt; squares, so there's 81
        smaller squares. some of them are already &gt; &gt; filled with random
        numbers, and you have to fill in the rest of them &gt; &gt; so that each
        row, column, and separate 3x3 square has the numbers 1-9 &gt; &gt; in
        it. &gt; &gt; I knew some of you would be interested in it, so decided
        to share. &gt; &gt; here's a wiki article on it: &gt; &gt;

        Many of the fastest cubers in the world now use the anniversary cube it
        seems. Also, it is what I am using currently and I am preparing another
        one this week. For speedcubing I recommend either that or the Black DIY
        kits (I would go with no stickers and order stickers separately from
        cubesmith.com). Initally there is a bit of getting used to, but I think
        it takes less time for the anniversary cubes to become good than for the
        regular cubes. Since the anniversary cubes (and black DIY) have arched
        center pieces, they very rarely pop. In some styles of cubing, they
        simply do not pop unless forced. For me it has never popped. -Doug ---

        Hi Friends, Following recent events about BLD, I could not resist the
        temptation to introduce 2 ideas I had to perform BLD... ... with eyes
        opened. IDEA 1 (can use it in comp.) You need 2 cubes C1 and C2, and 2
        scrambling algs S1 and S2. The 2 cubes must have the same color schemes.
        Let's say that C2 is the own cube of the competitor (lubed, etc.).
        Protocol : a. scramble C1 with S1 b. scramble C2 with S2 followed by S1.
        c. give C1 to competitor for inspection and memorization d. take+hide C1
        from competitor once memorization is done. e. give C2 to competitor. f.
        competitor now "blindfoldsolves" C2 with eyes opened as if it were C1.
        g. take C2 from competitor h. apply inverse(S2) [the reverse of the
        sramble S2] to C2 i. check if C2 is now solved. IDEA 2 (new category for
        rubik's cube, another BLD with eyes wide opened) A few weeks ago, I was
        thinking about a new category for solving rubiks's cube. And I came up
        with this idea : a. Have the cube scrambled by a friend. b. The
        scrambled cube is called SC. c. try to : - solve the cube first - bring
        it back to the initial scrambled state SC (you don't know what the
        scrambling alg was in 1st place, so it's rather difficult ?). Well, I
        don't know how topcubers would do this. Obviously, there are two
        solutions at least : Solution1 : speedsolve the cube remembering all
        moves, and apply all those moves in reverse order to get back to initial
        state Solution2 : memorize initial state, speedsolve cube, and
        "blindsolve" the cube in reverse order (easy with Stefan P.'s method).
        Well, I've tried this idea number 2 a couple of times ;-). Hope you
        enjoyed this, -- François, Paris

        just that he/she switches to a different cube between memorizing and
        solving. The real difference is for the judge, he'll need to scramble
        and descramble more. And it must all be checked very thoroughly using
        printouts showing the scrambled cubes, created by the computer. We must

        looks pretty). &gt; I like the idea. Francois, are you into

        You need 2 cubes C1 and C2, and 2 scrambling algs S1 and S2. &gt; The 2
        cubes must have the same color schemes. I think they could have
        different color schemes since the competitor doesn't need to see C2 at
        all! Only C1 must have the color scheme that the competitor wants, and
        probably he'll choose the same as C2... Ok... as much as I like the
        idea, I must admit that for the sake of "naturalness" I'd rather do it
        the normal way and use full-face blindfolds or boards between head and
        cube in order to fight cheating. I think the only way to cheat and gain
        speed is to peek (or if a partner gives you solving commands through a
        hidden headphone or telepathy so you don't need to memorize at all).
        Using little dirty tricks like feeling the orientations can make it
        easier, but I'm convinced not faster than someone who does it well
        without cheating. General question: Do we really need to do more than we
        currently do against cheating, i.e. using blindfolds? Well, we usually
        blindsolve with the cube not straight in front of our eyes but much
        lower in a more comfortable position, so peeking isn't all that
        impossible. Especially if someone raises the head, and I know I do that
        sometimes when I try hard to remember something. I don't want it, but I
        do it. And the noncubers out there, including the media, might see the
        possibility of cheating. I'd like to prove better that I don't cheat.

        embark upon a line of investigation until either coming to a

        arriving at a solution but then having to check that going down the
        other paths didn't lead to a solution too (i.e. that there was indeed
        one solution). For instance, supposing you get to a point where say one
        square contains 1 or 3 but it's not obvious where to go. I'm saying that
        you can figure it out logically without having to resort to a logical
        but hardly neat method (of guessing) of "let's try 1 and see where it
        goes". (The computer program on that site actually does use that as I
        recall. I think one of its steps is something like "In cell (a,b) k
        leads to a contradction" without further justification of this
        contradiction - and it also claims that t needs a guess to finish (in
        fact, it might even require 2 guesses but you don't need any).

        I use one, but I don't recommend it for speedcubing. No arched centers
        and it pops a lot. It just don't feel too smooth. -Doug --- In

        &gt; For speedcubing I recommend either that or the Black DIY kits (I

        but I think it takes less &gt; time for the anniversary cubes to become
        good than for the regular &gt; cubes. &gt; &gt; Since the anniversary
        cubes (and black DIY) have arched center pieces, &gt; they very rarely
        pop. In some styles of cubing, they simply do not pop &gt; unless
        forced. For me it has never popped. &gt; &gt; &gt; -Doug &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I like your idea, François. Here is a small modification to your
        protocol. You need 3 cubes now. a. scramble both C2 and C3 with an
        arbitrary S2, check that they look the same, hide C3. b. scramble both
        C1 and already scrambled C2 with S1. c. give C1 to competitor for
        inspection and memorization d. take+hide C1 from competitor once
        memorization is done. e. give C2 to competitor. f. competitor now
        "blindfoldsolves" C2 with eyes opened as if it were C1. g. compare C2
        with C3, they should be scrambled identically. Everybody can see it
        after they are oriented the same way. Anybody from audience can add few
        moves to S2, performing them on C2 and C3 before start. C3 can be
        covered with a porcelain cup on the table and revealed only after
        solving. I bet the competitor would beg for a blindfold. :-) I don't see
        any space for cheating. Mirek --- In

        (new category for rubik's cube, another BLD with &gt; eyes wide opened)
        &gt; A few weeks ago, I was thinking about a new category for &gt;
        solving rubiks's cube. And I came up with this idea : &gt; a. Have the
        cube scrambled by a friend. &gt; b. The scrambled cube is called SC.
        &gt; c. try to : &gt; - solve the cube first &gt; - bring it back to the
        initial scrambled state SC &gt; (you don't know what the scrambling alg
        was in 1st place, &gt; so it's rather difficult ?). &gt; Well, I don't
        know how topcubers would do this. Obviously, there &gt; are two
        solutions at least : &gt; Solution1 : speedsolve the cube remembering
        all moves, and apply &gt; all those moves in reverse order to get back
        to initial state &gt; Solution2 : memorize initial state, speedsolve
        cube, and "blindsolve" &gt; the cube in reverse order (easy with Stefan
        P.'s method). &gt; &gt; Well, I've tried this idea number 2 a couple of

        I personally would like to keep faith in the blindfold solvers right now
        that they aren't cheating. We can examine stickers and cubes before the
        competition and everything. The reason is that, really... to the public,
        they're not going to "get it" if we do one of these procedures, as pure
        as they are, and furthermore, it's a considerable more effort for the
        tournament organizers. There is a certain beauty in opening your eyes to
        a solved cube that first time. This beauty is seen by the audience as
        they're all new. They won't appreciate the art of blindfolding
        otherwise... But we'll see. As of now, I have faith in all of the
        blindfold competitors and as a board member, the WCA takes into may
        considerations of assuring a fair competition. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        This suggestion and the orginal by François are absolutely brillient! I
        had always suspected (gut feeling) that there was something we could do
        about ruling out any possiblity of cheating, and it seems now there is.
        Also, this way for the actual executioning of the solve, the cuber can
        simply use his/her own prefered cube now without any chance of cheating.
        It's not that I have no faith in my fellow cuber. For [competitive]
        cubing (in all its splendorous forms) to have a future, we ought to
        strive for precautions that aim for fairness across the board. I was
        very excited and satisified when I read the inital concept. I actually
        have practiced your "Idea #2" before in front of people. The students on
        this campus are pretty creative... I give them a cube to mix up for me
        to solve, and instead they lay it on the table and tell me to make a
        second cube look like that. Fun stuff, not sure it has any place in
        official competition [yet] though. Given some extra time, stuff like
        this (I think) would make for great stress-relieving pre/post
        competition unoffical events. In some of the gatherings I've been to
        there have been competitions to see who can (correctly/solvablely)
        assemble their cube the fastest. Heck, it might make the bloopers
        section of the upcomming documentary that that one dude is making
        (Munro?). Though I am inclined to agree wiht Tyson that these
        precausions are not yet needed, and would in fact hinder the audience
        understanding/enjoyment (or require lengthy explanation). But good to
        know that it is there for when we do need it (and we will...). -Doug ---

        &gt;&gt; IDEA 1 (can use it in comp.) &gt; &gt;&gt; You need 2 cubes C1

        have the same color schemes. Let's say that &gt; &gt;&gt; C2 is the own
        cube of the competitor (lubed, etc.). &gt; &gt;&gt; Protocol : &gt;
        &gt;&gt; a. scramble C1 with S1 &gt; &gt;&gt; b. scramble C2 with S2
        followed by S1. &gt; &gt;&gt; c. give C1 to competitor for inspection

        &gt;&gt; h. apply inverse(S2) [the reverse of the sramble S2] to C2 &gt;
        &gt;&gt; i. check if C2 is now solved. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; IDEA
        2 (new category for rubik's cube, another BLD with &gt; &gt;&gt; eyes
        wide opened) &gt; &gt;&gt; A few weeks ago, I was thinking about a new
        category for &gt; &gt;&gt; solving rubiks's cube. And I came up with
        this idea : &gt; &gt;&gt; a. Have the cube scrambled by a friend. &gt;
        &gt;&gt; b. The scrambled cube is called SC. &gt; &gt;&gt; c. try to :
        &gt; &gt;&gt; - solve the cube first &gt; &gt;&gt; - bring it back to
        the initial scrambled state SC &gt; &gt;&gt; (you don't know what the
        scrambling alg was in 1st place, &gt; &gt;&gt; so it's rather difficult
        ?). &gt; &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know how topcubers would do this.
        Obviously, there &gt; &gt;&gt; are two solutions at least : &gt;
        &gt;&gt; Solution1 : speedsolve the cube remembering all moves, and
        apply &gt; &gt;&gt; all those moves in reverse order to get back to
        initial state &gt; &gt;&gt; Solution2 : memorize initial state,
        speedsolve cube, &gt; &gt; and "blindsolve" &gt; &gt;&gt; the cube in
        reverse order (easy with Stefan P.'s method). &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; Well, I've tried this idea number 2 a couple of times ;-). &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hope you enjoyed this, &gt; &gt;&gt; -- &gt;

        Thanks a bunch, Per. These algs, along with r2 u2 r2 u2 and r' d r U2 r'
        d' r (U2) are all that I use to fix centers. They work great, but I
        think I need to find some moves that cycle both 2x1 center blocks on 3
        faces witthin a slice and some that cycle single center pieces on 3
        faces within a slice. Here's the method I've been practicing with the
        past few days, and it's paying off nicely. A little while ago, I managed
        a few times under 2 minutes with it and a 2:26 average. That seems
        pretty good to me, considering my best times with my centers first
        method were around 2:30 when I practiced it all the time... Anyhow, it's
        sort of a Roux themed approach to edges first 4x4ing: 1) L and R
        centers, generally on red and orange 2) LD and RD edge pairs (orange/red
        and white) 3) LF, RF, LB, and RB edge pairs, along with matching D layer
        corners in corner/edge pair fashion, using M slice to pair up edges 4) U
        layer corners 5) any two edge pairs remaining 6) pair up remaining 4
        edge pairs and fix single pair flipped 7) orient remaining edges, using
        Roux method moves 8) place UL and UR edge pairs 9) adjust M slice,
        and/or apply U2 move, so that at least one edge pair in M slice is
        correctly positioned 10) place rest of M pairs, fixing 2 swapped edge
        pairs parity if necessary 11) use center algs, courtesy of Per, to fix
        centers The only problem I have is that it's difficult to tell whether
        or not a single edge pair is flipped. It's easy to fix once you know,
        but finding out takes forever. It's faster for me, on average, to just
        not look and pair up edges however I find them, then fix them if I see
        they need it. It seems that to recognize it, I have to count the single
        edge pieces that need flipped in pairs, then count how many rU2r' or
        l'U2l cycles it will take to fix them all. Both of those algs flip a
        single pair of edges. I understand that if the number of pairs to be
        flipped is odd and the number of pairs that will flip is even, or vice
        versa, a single r or l in either direction is all that is needed, but I
        would like to know if there is an easier way to see this. After only a
        few days' practice, I've managed to cut my average down to under 2:30,
        and I think I can probably take it quite a bit farther, without adding
        any more algorithms. The key is constant motion, as in 3x3ing, but it's
        hard to recognize that parity error. I'm sure my averages would drop
        significantly if I didn't waste so much time every other solve pairing
        up edges only to get them all done, see I need to do an r, and have to
        fix them all over again. That's at least ten seconds I'm wasting on
        those solves. I would stop and count the edges and figure it out, but
        for the cases I don't wind up having to go back and fix, my solves don't
        have any extra count time, so they're that much faster. Any more helpful
        advice would be greatly appreciated. Happy big cubing. -Mike Bennett

        3:02 PM Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: 4x4x4 method :-) Hmm ... Which
        2 edges are u swapping and calling "parity" ? And for the centers have u
        considered this one : (lr')d2(l'r)U'(lr')d2(l'r)U It looks longish but
        it's actually ony 8 moves counted with the Hardwick metric ;-) And
        besides u can sorta fingertrick at least the (l'r) "slice move" :-)
        Alrite my idea for swapping 2 edges easily is as follows. Turn an inner
        slice layer a quarter turn. Then cycle 3 edges on this layer so that u
        get 2 swapped edges. It messes with edges for sure. U might want to use
        Chris algorithm : R2 (u'R2)*5 instead of a simple u turn. Now u for sure
        know how to swap any 2 edges easily. U can use this idea only if u do
        centers last, or else somehow "absorb" the side effect on the centers.
        Cheers! -Per PS! Also have a look at : (lr')d2(l'r)U'D'(lr')d2(l'r)UD
        And alrite also this : r'(ud')rU2r'(u'd)rU2 U want more rabbits? There
        are quite a few edge-rabbits too. Most simply involve cycling blocks
        around :-) They are easily performed but require some experience to see
        when to utilise them. [Non-text portions of this message have been

        Hi Mike! Finding algs that do u what u went is no problem at all. U
        already know algs i presume that have the desired effect. But the cubies
        are not all within the same layer. All u need is some setup moves. I
        must admit that the setup for 2x1 blocks 3-cycle within a single layer
        will be somewhat lengthy. I'm sure u can work it out urself if u
        understand how setup moves work: take a such alg thet u know where the
        blocks are not confined to a single layer. Now find moves that put 3 2x1
        blocks from same layer into those positions that are cycled by the alg u
        know. Those will be ur setup moves. Now at the end after the setup and
        the known alg u must reverse the setup moves and u are done. If u really
        get stuck with this send me an email :-) By the way, Ron used ACube to
        find another useful center alg for 4x4x4. One that interchanges 3
        centers on opposite faces. Actually 3 on each of the opposite faces. U
        will see what i mean when u apply it to a solved cube : r2 (du')R(du')
        r2 (d'u)R'(d'u). As u can see it's a commutator :D [(d'u)= (du')'] If u
        define E on 4x4x4 to be (du') then u can indeed write it as : r2 ERE r2
        E'R'E' !! Cheers! -Per PS! Why doesn't setup moves work for

        this layer &gt; so that u get 2 swapped edges. It messes with edges for
        sure. U &gt; might want to use Chris algorithm : R2 (u'R2)*5 instead of
        a simple &gt; u turn. Now u for sure know how to swap any 2 edges
        easily. U can &gt; use this idea only if u do centers last, or else
        somehow "absorb" &gt; the side effect on the centers. &gt; &gt; Cheers!
        &gt; &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; PS! &gt; Also have a look at :
        (lr')d2(l'r)U'D'(lr')d2(l'r)UD &gt; And alrite also this :
        r'(ud')rU2r'(u'd)rU2 &gt; &gt; U want more rabbits? &gt; &gt; There are
        quite a few edge-rabbits too. Most simply involve cycling &gt; blocks
        around :-) They are easily performed but require some &gt; experience to
        see when to utilise them. &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message

        mean when u apply &gt; it to a solved cube : r2 (du')R(du') r2

        a bunch, Per. These algs, along with r2 u2 r2 u2 and r' d &gt; r U2 r'
        d' r (U2) are all that I use to fix centers. They work &gt; great, but I
        think I need to find some moves that cycle both 2x1 &gt; center blocks
        on 3 faces witthin a slice and some that cycle single &gt; center pieces
        on 3 faces within a slice. Here's the method I've &gt; been practicing
        with the past few days, and it's paying off nicely. &gt; A little while
        ago, I managed a few times under 2 minutes with it &gt; and a 2:26
        average. That seems pretty good to me, considering my &gt; best times
        with my centers first method were around 2:30 when I &gt; practiced it
        all the time... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyhow, it's sort of a Roux themed
        approach to edges first 4x4ing: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) L and R centers,
        generally on red and orange &gt; &gt; 2) LD and RD edge pairs
        (orange/red and white) &gt; &gt; 3) LF, RF, LB, and RB edge pairs, along
        with matching D layer &gt; corners in corner/edge pair fashion, using M
        slice to pair up edges &gt; &gt; 4) U layer corners &gt; &gt; 5) any two
        edge pairs remaining &gt; &gt; 6) pair up remaining 4 edge pairs and fix
        single pair flipped &gt; &gt; 7) orient remaining edges, using Roux
        method moves &gt; &gt; 8) place UL and UR edge pairs &gt; &gt; 9) adjust
        M slice, and/or apply U2 move, so that at least one &gt; edge pair in M
        slice is correctly positioned &gt; &gt; 10) place rest of M pairs,
        fixing 2 swapped edge pairs parity if &gt; necessary &gt; &gt; 11) use
        center algs, courtesy of Per, to fix centers &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The
        only problem I have is that it's difficult to tell whether or &gt; not a
        single edge pair is flipped. It's easy to fix once you know, &gt; but
        finding out takes forever. It's faster for me, on average, to &gt; just
        not look and pair up edges however I find them, then fix them &gt; if I
        see they need it. It seems that to recognize it, I have to &gt; count
        the single edge pieces that need flipped in pairs, then count &gt; how
        many rU2r' or l'U2l cycles it will take to fix them all. Both &gt; of
        those algs flip a single pair of edges. I understand that if the &gt;
        number of pairs to be flipped is odd and the number of pairs that &gt;
        will flip is even, or vice versa, a single r or l in either &gt;
        direction is all that is needed, but I would like to know if there &gt;
        is an easier way to see this. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After only a few days'
        practice, I've managed to cut my average &gt; down to under 2:30, and I
        think I can probably take it quite a bit &gt; farther, without adding
        any more algorithms. The key is constant &gt; motion, as in 3x3ing, but
        it's hard to recognize that parity error. &gt; I'm sure my averages
        would drop significantly if I didn't waste so &gt; much time every other
        solve pairing up edges only to get them all &gt; done, see I need to do
        an r, and have to fix them all over again. &gt; That's at least ten
        seconds I'm wasting on those solves. I would &gt; stop and count the
        edges and figure it out, but for the cases I &gt; don't wind up having
        to go back and fix, my solves don't have any &gt; extra count time, so
        they're that much faster. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any more helpful advice
        would be greatly appreciated. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy big cubing. &gt;

        &gt; Finding algs that do u what u went is no problem at all. U already
        &gt; &gt; know algs i presume that have the desired effect. But the
        cubies &gt; are &gt; &gt; not all within the same layer. All u need is
        some setup moves. I &gt; &gt; must admit that the setup for 2x1 blocks
        3-cycle within a single &gt; &gt; layer will be somewhat lengthy. I'm
        sure u can work it out urself &gt; if &gt; &gt; u understand how setup
        moves work: take a such alg thet u know &gt; where &gt; &gt; the blocks
        are not confined to a single layer. Now find moves that &gt; &gt; put 3
        2x1 blocks from same layer into those positions that are &gt; &gt;
        cycled by the alg u know. Those will be ur setup moves. Now at the &gt;
        &gt; end after the setup and the known alg u must reverse the setup &gt;
        moves &gt; &gt; and u are done. If u really get stuck with this send me
        an email :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, Ron used ACube to find
        another useful center alg for &gt; &gt; 4x4x4. One that interchanges 3
        centers on opposite faces. Actually &gt; 3 &gt; &gt; on each of the
        opposite faces. U will see what i mean when u apply &gt; &gt; it to a
        solved cube : r2 (du')R(du') r2 (d'u)R'(d'u). As u can see &gt; &gt;
        it's a commutator :D [(d'u)= (du')'] If u define E on 4x4x4 to be &gt;
        &gt; (du') then u can indeed write it as : r2 ERE r2 E'R'E' !! &gt; &gt;

        These algs, along with r2 u2 r2 u2 and r' d &gt; &gt; r U2 r' d' r (U2)
        are all that I use to fix centers. They work &gt; &gt; great, but I
        think I need to find some moves that cycle both 2x1 &gt; &gt; center
        blocks on 3 faces witthin a slice and some that cycle single &gt; &gt;
        center pieces on 3 faces within a slice. Here's the method I've &gt;
        &gt; been practicing with the past few days, and it's paying off &gt;
        nicely. &gt; &gt; A little while ago, I managed a few times under 2
        minutes with it &gt; &gt; and a 2:26 average. That seems pretty good to
        me, considering my &gt; &gt; best times with my centers first method
        were around 2:30 when I &gt; &gt; practiced it all the time... &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyhow, it's sort of a Roux themed approach to edges
        first 4x4ing: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) L and R centers,
        generally on red and orange &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) LD and RD edge pairs
        (orange/red and white) &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) LF, RF, LB, and RB edge pairs,
        along with matching D layer &gt; &gt; corners in corner/edge pair
        fashion, using M slice to pair up edges &gt; &gt; &gt; 4) U layer
        corners &gt; &gt; &gt; 5) any two edge pairs remaining &gt; &gt; &gt; 6)
        pair up remaining 4 edge pairs and fix single pair flipped &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 7) orient remaining edges, using Roux method moves &gt; &gt; &gt;
        8) place UL and UR edge pairs &gt; &gt; &gt; 9) adjust M slice, and/or
        apply U2 move, so that at least one &gt; &gt; edge pair in M slice is
        correctly positioned &gt; &gt; &gt; 10) place rest of M pairs, fixing 2
        swapped edge pairs parity if &gt; &gt; necessary &gt; &gt; &gt; 11) use
        center algs, courtesy of Per, to fix centers &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; The only problem I have is that it's difficult to tell whether or
        &gt; &gt; not a single edge pair is flipped. It's easy to fix once you
        know, &gt; &gt; but finding out takes forever. It's faster for me, on
        average, to &gt; &gt; just not look and pair up edges however I find
        them, then fix them &gt; &gt; if I see they need it. It seems that to
        recognize it, I have to &gt; &gt; count the single edge pieces that need
        flipped in pairs, then count &gt; &gt; how many rU2r' or l'U2l cycles it
        will take to fix them all. Both &gt; &gt; of those algs flip a single
        pair of edges. I understand that if &gt; the &gt; &gt; number of pairs
        to be flipped is odd and the number of pairs that &gt; &gt; will flip is
        even, or vice versa, a single r or l in either &gt; &gt; direction is
        all that is needed, but I would like to know if there &gt; &gt; is an
        easier way to see this. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After only a few
        days' practice, I've managed to cut my average &gt; &gt; down to under
        2:30, and I think I can probably take it quite a bit &gt; &gt; farther,
        without adding any more algorithms. The key is constant &gt; &gt;
        motion, as in 3x3ing, but it's hard to recognize that parity &gt; error.
        &gt; &gt; I'm sure my averages would drop significantly if I didn't
        waste so &gt; &gt; much time every other solve pairing up edges only to
        get them all &gt; &gt; done, see I need to do an r, and have to fix them
        all over again. &gt; &gt; That's at least ten seconds I'm wasting on
        those solves. I would &gt; &gt; stop and count the edges and figure it
        out, but for the cases I &gt; &gt; don't wind up having to go back and
        fix, my solves don't have any &gt; &gt; extra count time, so they're
        that much faster. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any more helpful advice
        would be greatly appreciated. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy big
        cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Mike Bennett &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which 2 edges are u swapping and calling
        "parity" ? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And for the centers have u
        considered this one : &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        (lr')d2(l'r)U'(lr')d2(l'r)U &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It looks
        longish but it's actually ony 8 moves counted with the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Hardwick metric ;-) And besides u can sorta fingertrick at &gt; least
        &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; (l'r) "slice move" :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Alrite my idea for swapping 2 edges easily is as follows. Turn
        &gt; &gt; an &gt; &gt; &gt; inner slice layer a quarter turn. Then cycle
        3 edges on this &gt; &gt; layer &gt; &gt; &gt; so that u get 2 swapped
        edges. It messes with edges for sure. U &gt; &gt; &gt; might want to use
        Chris algorithm : R2 (u'R2)*5 instead of a &gt; &gt; simple &gt; &gt;
        &gt; u turn. Now u for sure know how to swap any 2 edges easily. U &gt;
        &gt; can &gt; &gt; &gt; use this idea only if u do centers last, or else
        &gt; &gt; somehow "absorb" &gt; &gt; &gt; the side effect on the
        centers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS! &gt; &gt; &gt; Also have a
        look at : (lr')d2(l'r)U'D'(lr')d2(l'r)UD &gt; &gt; &gt; And alrite also
        this : r'(ud')rU2r'(u'd)rU2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; U want more
        rabbits? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are quite a few
        edge-rabbits too. Most simply involve &gt; &gt; cycling &gt; &gt; &gt;
        blocks around :-) They are easily performed but require some &gt; &gt;
        &gt; experience to see when to utilise them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; r U2 r' d' r (U2) are all that I use to fix centers. They work

        edges first 4x4ing: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) L and R
        centers, generally on red and orange &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) LD and RD
        edge pairs (orange/red and white) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) LF, RF, LB, and
        RB edge pairs, along with matching D layer &gt; &gt; &gt; corners in
        corner/edge pair fashion, using M slice to pair up edges &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 4) U layer corners &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5) any two edge pairs
        remaining &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6) pair up remaining 4 edge pairs and fix
        single pair flipped &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7) orient remaining edges, using
        Roux method moves &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8) place UL and UR edge pairs &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 9) adjust M slice, and/or apply U2 move, so that at least
        one &gt; &gt; &gt; edge pair in M slice is correctly positioned &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 10) place rest of M pairs, fixing 2 swapped edge pairs
        parity if &gt; &gt; &gt; necessary &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 11) use center
        algs, courtesy of Per, to fix centers &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; The only problem I have is that it's difficult to tell whether or
        &gt; &gt; &gt; not a single edge pair is flipped. It's easy to fix once
        you know, &gt; &gt; &gt; but finding out takes forever. It's faster for
        me, on average, to &gt; &gt; &gt; just not look and pair up edges
        however I find them, then fix them &gt; &gt; &gt; if I see they need it.
        It seems that to recognize it, I have to &gt; &gt; &gt; count the single
        edge pieces that need flipped in pairs, then count &gt; &gt; &gt; how
        many rU2r' or l'U2l cycles it will take to fix them all. Both &gt; &gt;
        &gt; of those algs flip a single pair of edges. I understand that if
        &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; number of pairs to be flipped is odd and
        the number of pairs that &gt; &gt; &gt; will flip is even, or vice
        versa, a single r or l in either &gt; &gt; &gt; direction is all that is
        needed, but I would like to know if there &gt; &gt; &gt; is an easier
        way to see this. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After only a
        few days' practice, I've managed to cut my average &gt; &gt; &gt; down
        to under 2:30, and I think I can probably take it quite a bit &gt; &gt;
        &gt; farther, without adding any more algorithms. The key is constant
        &gt; &gt; &gt; motion, as in 3x3ing, but it's hard to recognize that
        parity &gt; &gt; error. &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure my averages would drop
        significantly if I didn't waste so &gt; &gt; &gt; much time every other
        solve pairing up edges only to get them all &gt; &gt; &gt; done, see I
        need to do an r, and have to fix them all over again. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        That's at least ten seconds I'm wasting on those solves. I would &gt;
        &gt; &gt; stop and count the edges and figure it out, but for the cases
        I &gt; &gt; &gt; don't wind up having to go back and fix, my solves
        don't have any &gt; &gt; &gt; extra count time, so they're that much

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (lr')d2(l'r)U'(lr')d2(l'r)U &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It looks longish but it's actually
        ony 8 moves counted with the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hardwick metric ;-) And
        besides u can sorta fingertrick at &gt; &gt; least &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (l'r) "slice move" :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Alrite my idea for swapping 2 edges easily is as follows. Turn
        &gt; &gt; &gt; an &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inner slice layer a quarter turn.
        Then cycle 3 edges on this &gt; &gt; &gt; layer &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so
        that u get 2 swapped edges. It messes with edges for sure. U &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; might want to use Chris algorithm : R2 (u'R2)*5 instead of a
        &gt; &gt; &gt; simple &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; u turn. Now u for sure know
        how to swap any 2 edges easily. U &gt; &gt; &gt; can &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        use this idea only if u do centers last, or else &gt; &gt; &gt; somehow
        "absorb" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the side effect on the centers. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS! &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Also have a look at : (lr')d2(l'r)U'D'(lr')d2(l'r)UD &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; And alrite also this : r'(ud')rU2r'(u'd)rU2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; U want more rabbits? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; There are quite a few edge-rabbits too. Most simply involve
        &gt; &gt; &gt; cycling &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blocks around :-) They are
        easily performed but require some &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience to see
        when to utilise them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do u mean that when u do u u don't do u2 unless u do
        u and then u 2? Is it just me, or are there entirely way too many
        instances of "u" in that sentence? It's quite confusing here, and it
        would help to write "you" when appropriate in such a statement. ;-) ~

        I'd been meaning to write a little program that takes a scramble and
        give the disjoint cyclic notation of the pieces for blindfold solving.
        It's finally here, I managed to put in the time for it. So basically you
        give it the scramble (I prefer to use the Scramble generator in NetCube,
        it exports in the perfect format), and the program returns: Length: 0
        CO: 0000 0000 EO: 0000 0000 0000 CP: (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8) EP:
        (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12) For the solved case if you do
        not turn on 1-cycle supression. Actaully I'm not sure if it can handle
        the solved case.... oh ya it can :). The beautiful part about this is
        that you can label things however you like... you can call a corner
        "Bob" if you'd like. THe program supports whatever numbering/ordering
        you like. The user defines what is positively/nutural/negatively
        oriented corner for instance. Though CO is defined in the UD manner, and
        EO is defined in the R2L2 restriction. The order it outputs the cycles
        is also user defined. Read the accompanying files carefully and enjoy.
        It's under the files section of this forum called "BLD.zip". I look
        forward to sugguestions/improvements for future versions. -Doug

        You stick with your own numbering, practically nothing new to learn in
        order to enjoy this program. It is run from the command line and I have
        included a windows verison and linux version. I have a sample
        preferences file included (where the user only has to set their personal
        options once..., or swap out the file for a different setup); there is a
        list of scrambles for sample input (generated from NetCube); and there
        is the output file for what it looks like if you ran it correctly with
        those inputs. In both Linux and Windows, one way of running it is: "bld
        &lt; scrambles.txt &gt; output.txt" If one or both streams are not
        "redirected" then of course it accepts the scrambles from the keyboard
        and/or outputs to the console. It's kinda wierd when you run it with an
        output file but no input file..., you'd have to type the scrambles in
        without any text prompting you to. ======================== Uses:
        Instead of doing a full bld solve, you can spend a full sitting doing
        only the memorization part. Punch the scrmables through and it will be
        an instant check to see if you remembered it correctly. In fact, try to
        rush yourself a bit to the point just before you make mistakes. THis
        porgram is here to help you find that point effectively. Secondly, you
        can now spend a full sitting, NOT doing any memorization (i.e.
        lazy-bld). Just preform the scramble and stick it under the table while
        looking at the program output. This way you can try to minimize your
        execution time, and since memorization is not longer so expensive, you
        are more free to do riskier things :). Like trying that new lovely,
        exotic alg that flips 6, 8 or 10 edges symmutaneously, which you've been
        itchin' to do. Hey if nothing else, it makes BLD more fun for EVERBODY!

        &gt; 3 &gt; &gt; &gt; on each of the opposite faces. U will see what i
        mean when u apply &gt; &gt; &gt; it to a solved cube : r2 (du')R(du') r2
        (d'u)R'(d'u). As u can see &gt; &gt; &gt; it's a commutator :D [(d'u)=

        &gt; &gt; 3x3x3 cube ? :-P &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        Per. These algs, along with r2 u2 r2 u2 and r' d &gt; &gt; &gt; r U2 r'
        d' r (U2) are all that I use to fix centers. They work &gt; &gt; &gt;
        great, but I think I need to find some moves that cycle both 2x1 &gt;
        &gt; &gt; center blocks on 3 faces witthin a slice and some that cycle
        single &gt; &gt; &gt; center pieces on 3 faces within a slice. Here's
        the method I've &gt; &gt; &gt; been practicing with the past few days,
        and it's paying off &gt; &gt; nicely. &gt; &gt; &gt; A little while ago,
        I managed a few times under 2 minutes with it &gt; &gt; &gt; and a 2:26
        average. That seems pretty good to me, considering my &gt; &gt; &gt;
        best times with my centers first method were around 2:30 when I &gt;
        &gt; &gt; practiced it all the time... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Anyhow, it's sort of a Roux themed approach to edges first
        4x4ing: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) L and R centers,
        generally on red and orange &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) LD and RD edge pairs
        (orange/red and white) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) LF, RF, LB, and RB edge
        pairs, along with matching D layer &gt; &gt; &gt; corners in corner/edge
        pair fashion, using M slice to pair up edges &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4) U
        layer corners &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5) any two edge pairs remaining &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 6) pair up remaining 4 edge pairs and fix single pair
        flipped &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7) orient remaining edges, using Roux method
        moves &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8) place UL and UR edge pairs &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 9) adjust M slice, and/or apply U2 move, so that at least one &gt;
        &gt; &gt; edge pair in M slice is correctly positioned &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 10) place rest of M pairs, fixing 2 swapped edge pairs parity if
        &gt; &gt; &gt; necessary &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 11) use center algs,
        courtesy of Per, to fix centers &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        The only problem I have is that it's difficult to tell whether or &gt;
        &gt; &gt; not a single edge pair is flipped. It's easy to fix once you
        know, &gt; &gt; &gt; but finding out takes forever. It's faster for me,
        on average, to &gt; &gt; &gt; just not look and pair up edges however I
        find them, then fix them &gt; &gt; &gt; if I see they need it. It seems
        that to recognize it, I have to &gt; &gt; &gt; count the single edge
        pieces that need flipped in pairs, then count &gt; &gt; &gt; how many
        rU2r' or l'U2l cycles it will take to fix them all. Both &gt; &gt; &gt;
        of those algs flip a single pair of edges. I understand that if &gt;
        &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; number of pairs to be flipped is odd and the
        number of pairs that &gt; &gt; &gt; will flip is even, or vice versa, a
        single r or l in either &gt; &gt; &gt; direction is all that is needed,
        but I would like to know if there &gt; &gt; &gt; is an easier way to see
        this. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After only a few days'
        practice, I've managed to cut my average &gt; &gt; &gt; down to under
        2:30, and I think I can probably take it quite a bit &gt; &gt; &gt;
        farther, without adding any more algorithms. The key is constant &gt;
        &gt; &gt; motion, as in 3x3ing, but it's hard to recognize that parity
        &gt; &gt; error. &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure my averages would drop
        significantly if I didn't waste so &gt; &gt; &gt; much time every other
        solve pairing up edges only to get them all &gt; &gt; &gt; done, see I
        need to do an r, and have to fix them all over again. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        That's at least ten seconds I'm wasting on those solves. I would &gt;
        &gt; &gt; stop and count the edges and figure it out, but for the cases
        I &gt; &gt; &gt; don't wind up having to go back and fix, my solves
        don't have any &gt; &gt; &gt; extra count time, so they're that much
        faster. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any more helpful advice
        would be greatly appreciated. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Happy big cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Mike Bennett

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm ... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Which 2 edges are u swapping and calling "parity" ? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And for the centers have u considered this one :
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (lr')d2(l'r)U'(lr')d2(l'r)U &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It looks longish but it's actually
        ony 8 moves counted with the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hardwick metric ;-) And
        besides u can sorta fingertrick at &gt; &gt; least &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (l'r) "slice move" :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Alrite my idea for swapping 2 edges easily is as follows. Turn
        &gt; &gt; &gt; an &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inner slice layer a quarter turn.
        Then cycle 3 edges on this &gt; &gt; &gt; layer &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so
        that u get 2 swapped edges. It messes with edges for sure. U &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; might want to use Chris algorithm : R2 (u'R2)*5 instead of a
        &gt; &gt; &gt; simple &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; u turn. Now u for sure know
        how to swap any 2 edges easily. U &gt; &gt; &gt; can &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        use this idea only if u do centers last, or else &gt; &gt; &gt; somehow
        "absorb" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the side effect on the centers. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS! &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Also have a look at : (lr')d2(l'r)U'D'(lr')d2(l'r)UD &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; And alrite also this : r'(ud')rU2r'(u'd)rU2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; U want more rabbits? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; There are quite a few edge-rabbits too. Most simply involve
        &gt; &gt; &gt; cycling &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blocks around :-) They are
        easily performed but require some &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience to see
        when to utilise them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text

        &gt; You need 2 cubes C1 and C2, and 2 scrambling algs S1 and S2. &gt;
        &gt; The 2 cubes must have the same color schemes. Let's say that &gt;
        &gt; C2 is the own cube of the competitor (lubed, etc.). &gt; &gt;
        Protocol : &gt; &gt; a. scramble C1 with S1 &gt; &gt; b. scramble C2
        with S2 followed by S1. &gt; &gt; c. give C1 to competitor for
        inspection and memorization &gt; &gt; d. take+hide C1 from competitor
        once memorization is done. &gt; &gt; e. give C2 to competitor. &gt; &gt;
        f. competitor now "blindfoldsolves" C2 with eyes opened as &gt; &gt; if
        it were C1. &gt; &gt; g. take C2 from competitor &gt; &gt; h. apply
        inverse(S2) [the reverse of the sramble S2] to C2 &gt; &gt; i. check if
        C2 is now solved. &gt; &gt; François, Paris This reminds me very much of
        a magic trick you can do with two cubes. It was invented by Jerry
        Sadowitz after I explained to him the trick method for solving a cube
        behind your back. Have the two cubes scrambled as above, but with S2
        equal to the superflip. You can allow both cubes to be mixed further, as
        long as the same moves are done to both (essentially extending S1 a
        bit). You don't need to see this scrambling. One cube is hidden (doesn't
        matter which one), the other handed to you behind your back. You haven't
        seen either cube, and yet you can arrange your cube to match the hidden
        one exactly (just by doing the superflip S2 again). Jaap
