Option 1)
Answer &quot;You say you know it. How do you know? Go ask the person who 
told you that.&quot;

Option 2)
Answer &quot;How can an equation solve the cube? How does it even twist it?
&quot;

Option 3)
Answer &quot;What do you mean?&quot;. If they still don&#x27;t shut up, go to option 
2 before trying anything else. Let them at least tell you what they 
mean/want.

Option 4)
Provide a short version of God&#x27;s algorithm, e.g.:
a) neighbours of a state are the states reachable in 1 move
b) distance( solved state ) = 0
c) for all states s,
   distance( s ) = 1 + Min(over all neighbours n of s) distance( n )
Ok so it&#x27;s not a single equation but several. Also, neighbours 
could/should be defined with equations as well. And it&#x27;s not a 
solution but then again saying &quot;equation that solves the cube&quot; is 
pretty nonsense (see option 2 above). It can be used to solve the cube 
with the instruction &quot;always do a move that results in a state with 
smaller distance value&quot;.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Well, I&#x27;ve somehow managed to get &lt;1 standard deviation averages using both a Fridrich 4 look LL method and with the Roux method.  Of course, that only happens when I&#x27;m concentrating considerably, and it seems I&#x27;m another practitioner of Gille&#x27;s religion: laziness.  Also, I&#x27;ve been learning so many new methods and so much lately my averages have gone way down hill, but I expect with a healthy amount of shut-in practice, they should get back in shape.

My standard deviations are always all over the place and often several

Hey everyone, <br>
<br>
I posted this message on the corners first group already, but since it<br>
has been quiet there lately, and I would really need a response by<br>
Thursday this week in order to help me, I decided to post here too in<br>
case any of you corners first solvers read this group too.<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
I post a lot at the international forum but haven&#x27;t posted here<br>
before, and I have a corners first specific quesiton.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m studying at college and it turns out that one of the guys on my<br>
hall is a corners first cuber.  He recently asked me about where to<br>
start to learn more about cubing/speedcubing, specifically about the<br>
layer by layer method.  I told him, though, that since he is already<br>
comfortable and used to corners first solving that there is no reason<br>
he should switch to layer by layer.<br>
<br>
&gt;From what he&#x27;s told me about how he solves I get the impression that<br>
he uses a beginner/intermediate approach.  What I&#x27;m going to do is to<br>
show him ways to make his current steps more efficient.  The problem<br>
with this is that I am a diehard layers solver.<br>
<br>
I already know that for solving the last 4 corners he only uses 1 or 2<br>
algorithms, so that step needs work.  Also I was going to point him to<br>
the algorithms on speedcubing.com about solving the last edge (the 8th<br>
edge, such that only the middle layer is left unsolved) and also<br>
orient the middle layer edges.<br>
<br>
I have messed around with corners first solving before and came up<br>
with my own version of a probably fairly widely used approach.  I<br>
average about 50 seconds with this method.<br>
<br>
What I do is this:<br>
1) solve the first 4 corners intuitively<br>
2) solve the last 4 in one alg using COLL (NOT CLL, I use COLL simply<br>
because I know them from layers solving.  If this guy gets interested<br>
in learning more algs I would point him towards CLL and _not_ COLL)<br>
3) solve the 8 top and bottom layer edges, making sure to try to<br>
insert two at a time whenever possible.  I insert the last two at the<br>
same time.<br>
4) permute the middle layer edges<br>
5) orient the LL edges in one alg<br>
<br>
I personally am not very fast with this method, but does it seem that<br>
it could be made fairly fast with practice?  Should I teach the guy on<br>
my hall this method?  For step 2 I would show him how to orient and<br>
then permute the corners using 9 algs (7 to orient and 2 to permute)<br>
rather than say &quot;learn CLL, it&#x27;s only 40 algs&quot;.<br>
<br>
Should I tell him to look at the algs for inserting the 8th edge<br>
(completing the two opposite layers) while also orienting the middle<br>
layer edges?  It seems like there are only 8, since the 4 middle layer<br>
edge orientations have 8 different possibilites.  Of course I haven&#x27;t<br>
learned them, so I don&#x27;t know if that is true in practice.<br>
<br>
Anyway I would appreciate some help.  This guy sounds interested in<br>
learning more about cubing, and I really don&#x27;t want to make him a<br>
Fridrich clone.  Since he is already comfortable with corners first<br>
solving, I&#x27;d rather show him an intermediate/advanced corners first<br>
approach.<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey there, Chris.  In an attempt not to become a Fridrich clone myself, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with various methods recently.  My primary method is now the Roux method, which I use to average around 34.  I started toying with my own corners first method recently, though, and have used it to teach a few friends, with minimal effort and a heck of a lot less memorization than the 40 COLL algs you suggested.  It&#x27;s not an advanced method by any means, but I feel it has merit because it&#x27;s upgradable without having to abandon.  Here&#x27;s an attempt at an explanation.  If you decide you&#x27;d like to know more, let me know and I&#x27;ll elaborate.

1) Solve bottom corners intuitively.  Usually takes somewhere around 7 or 8 moves.
2) U layer corners in two looks.  Algorithms, including reflections: 9
3) D layer edges.  5 incredibly simple (no more than 4 moves) cases covers all possibilities, including reflections. 
4) Insert middle layer edges, controlling as much orientation as possible: 2 cases (edge 3 cycle and mirror).
5) Orient U layer edges.  3 algorithms cover all cases in a maximum of 2 steps.
6) Permute U layer edges.  3 cases.

Using this method, which requires minimal memorization (the second step is easily solvable using a grand total of a corner swapping algorithm and Sune/antiSune but I use a few extras from my Fridrich method) I am able to solve the cube in under 45 seconds on average and around 75-80 moves.  I&#x27;ve managed a single sub 30, but I got fairly lucky.  My usual faster times are in the low and mid 30&#x27;s with it.  I&#x27;m sure if I worked on the method and practiced a little sub 35 averages would be attainable without major upgrading.  I&#x27;m curious to see what you think.  Let me know and I&#x27;ll give you a list of sequences, though I&#x27;m sure you already know all of them already. =)

colour that looked easiest.  But the consensus here seemed to be that it was
faster to always start with the same colour so I switched.  I&#x27;ve been cubing
with the same colour for quite a few months now and probably agree that its
faster.

I use the Lars Petrus method with fixed coulours. I decided not to <br>
always use the same colour since I can get really nasty positions for a <br>
2x2x2. But I always go for the same 2x2x3, that is the yellow-gree one, <br>
so at the begining I can choose between two different 2x2x2&#x27;s. I do <br>
that because after that I&#x27;m left with white and blue colours as the two-<br>
generator colours, which have the biggest contrast on the cube so <br>
seeing the bad edges happens almost instantly. Then I usually try to <br>
leave white as LL because of your reasons: it&#x27;s bright. I also think <br>
that using the same colour for LL helps memorising the positions much <br>

If you need a pure corners-first approach for your guy, he can try:
- 4 + 4 (but not CLL sequences, Waterman&#x27;s for example or shorter/faster).
- Gaétan&#x27;s or even easier: 
- http://www.ai.sri.com/~cheyer/rubiks/rubiks.html
- http://rubikscube.info/ortega.html

But I feel that keeping all the edges unsolved is less efficient,
because with a same number of pieces, it&#x27;s faster to recognize them if
they belong to 2 distinct categories.

A good compromise (not strictly corners-first) between speed and
complexity could be:
- Solve L face minus 1 edge (Waterman&#x27;s way, 1x2x3 + 2 corners, etc).
- Solve the last 4 corners.
- Solve 3 R-edges + 1 L/R-edge.
- Solve the last L/R-edge while orienting M-edges.
- Permute M-edges.
Thierry Gagnaire says he was sub-19 with it, I&#x27;m very confident that
sub-18 is possible.

Have fun,

Gilles.

Hey :-)<br>
<br>
&gt; I have messed around with corners first solving before and came up<br>
&gt; with my own version of a probably fairly widely used approach.  I<br>
&gt; average about 50 seconds with this method.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; What I do is this:<br>
&gt; 1) solve the first 4 corners intuitively<br>
&gt; 2) solve the last 4 in one alg using COLL (NOT CLL, I use COLL <br>
simply<br>
&gt; because I know them from layers solving.  If this guy gets <br>
interested<br>
&gt; in learning more algs I would point him towards CLL and _not_ COLL)<br>
&gt; 3) solve the 8 top and bottom layer edges, making sure to try to<br>
&gt; insert two at a time whenever possible.  I insert the last two at <br>
the<br>
&gt; same time.<br>
&gt; 4) permute the middle layer edges<br>
&gt; 5) orient the LL edges in one alg<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I personally am not very fast with this method, but does it seem <br>
that<br>
&gt; it could be made fairly fast with practice?  Should I teach the <br>
guy on<br>
&gt; my hall this method?  <br>
<br>
Yes this seems like an okay intermediate corners first method. Yo, i <br>
wish u&#x27;d stick to that method chris. Then i could beat u ;-) Even if <br>
i use that method also. Im about 35-40 secs with such a method.<br>
<br>
One suggestion though, complete first layer before doing last 4 <br>
corners. Yes i know it&#x27;s then not longer a pure corners first <br>
approach. Inserting edges into bottom layer (first solved layer <br>
remains at top when i do this approach) is easy with an alg like <br>
this : R&#x27; E R2 E R&#x27; or R E&#x27; R2 E&#x27; R (first one backwards). A more <br>
advanced approach will orient the middle edges while doing the edges <br>
on the bottom layer. Or one could learn all the cases for edges on <br>
the middle layers. I once worked out all those algs. It&#x27;s not all <br>
that many. Orient edges then position them is also not that bad. <br>
(This is opposite order of what u suggested chris!) There are a few <br>
bad cases for that when all edges need be flipped. Those are better <br>
dealt with by simply doing 2 edge-cycles. Ie diverting from the <br>
orient/permute pattern.<br>

Yes, another method idea :P  The one I&#x27;m about to describe has been <br>
inspired by a variety of different methods.  While I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been <br>
explored, I have yet to see it discussed.<br>
<br>
Step 1:   Solve [D] layer except for one corner slot<br>
Step 2:   Orient and Permute LL edges using the empty corner slot<br>
Step 3:   Orient and Permute Middle Layer<br>
Step 4:   Solve remaining corners<br>
<br>
<br>
This is a simplified version of the idea.  I haven&#x27;t persued learning <br>

Oh, I like that -- I&#x27;ve been discovering some of these ideas for myself 
recently.  It is easy to say that much of it is common sense, but (to 
take one example) most of the sequences I use were learnt without the 
use of triggers, and the learning process was definitely harder then.

Idea from a non-expert: in cases where the inverse of a sequence A is 
useful, learn both at the same time, if you can.  To practice, start 
with a solved cube and apply A (once) then A&#x27; (twice) then A (twice), 
and so on.  That way you regularly get to see the cases that A and A&#x27; 
apply to, and you get equal amounts of practice on each.

Thanks for the help everybody,

I guess mainly what I am looking for is a way to show this guy how 
to improve his method without saying to just learn lots of algs.  
I&#x27;m not sure how into speedcubing he is, but I assume since he 
seemed willing to learn a whole new method that he is fairly 
dedicated.

I guess for now I&#x27;ll show him the 9 algs necessary to do the last 
four corners relatively quickly (since he only uses I think 2 now), 
as well as point him to the algs for inserting the 8th edge (such 
that only the middle layer is left) and also orient all middle layer 
edges at the same time.

That is 17 algs, or I guess 25 if you count reflections, which seems 
like a reasonable amount given that I think he is fairly dedicated.

Am I correct that there are only 8 (16 with reflections) algs 
necessary for inserting the 8th edge and flipping the middle layer 
edges?  I don&#x27;t want to tell him to learn that step but it turn out 
to be a huge number of algs.

I figure this method is scalable if he gets into speedcubing since 
the 9 algs for the last 4 corners are all useful CLL algs, leaving 
only 31 if he decides to learn that.  Also the algs to insert that 
last edge and flip the middle layer edges seem to be mentioned a lot 
on corners first sites and for corners first solving, so it seems 
like a useful set of algs to know, even if just for special cases in 
more advanced methods.

I figure I&#x27;ll also learn those edge algs along with this guy.  I 
think it would be cool to expand my corners first knowledge, so this 
is also partially a selfish pursuit in that it is a convenient 
opportuity for me to learn about corners first solving.

If anyone else has any more ideas for beginner/intermediate corners 
first adaptations please keep posting!

Chris

Learning 7 orientation sequences is quite easy:
- Sune, Anti-Sune, Double-Sune
- FRUR&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27; and the doubled version: FRUR&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27;
- Another you like and it&#x27;s &quot;anti&quot; for the last 2 cases.
That&#x27;s only 3 basic sequences to figure out.

See http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Step_4.html , Step 4-1b. If you
simplify 2 cases and take care of symetries, there are only 4
sequences left to learn.

BUT there&#x27;s more than this when the last edge is already in place,
twisted or not.

Nice, M (or E) is going to become your best friend :-)
And don&#x27;t miss my above link ( http://rubikscube.info/ortega.html ),
it allows you to solve the corners faster than using a 2-stage CLL for
about the same number of sequences! (+color neutral method)

I don&#x27;t think this is true at all.<br>

          <div class="email-content"><br>
&gt; On the box for the Rubik&#x27;s 4x4x4, it says that the 4x4x4 is not <br>
harder than the <br>
&gt; 3x3x3.  It just requires a different approach.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I don&#x27;t think this is true at all.<br>
<br>
Though I agree with you, I&#x27;m not sure I agree with your arguments.<br>
<br>
&gt; 1. The 4x4x4 has way more combinations than the 3x3x3<br>
<br>
The 5x5x5 has way more combinations than the 4x4x4, but I would <br>
consider it &quot;easier&quot; because of the lack of parities.  The megaminx has <br>
more combinations than the 4x4x4, but I would consider it easier, too, <br>
because it can be solved almost exactly like the 3x3x3.  The 2x2x2 has <br>
more combinations than a pyraminx, but I consider the pyraminx to be <br>
MUCH easier to solve...Difficulty of puzzles can be very opinionated.<br>
<br>
&gt; 2. The most popular method is to unite the edges and centers, then <br>
solve like a <br>
&gt; 3x3x3.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that&#x27;s not the &quot;easiest&quot; method to use for solving a 4x4x4.  <br>
There are certainly other ways to solve it.  Maybe some of the other <br>
ways of solving a 4x4x4 are easier?  You say it requires a &quot;different <br>
approach, so maybe the approach that is mentioned is easier than that <br>
off a 3x3x3 (note: I don&#x27;t agree with this, but it is possible).<br>
<br>
&gt; 3. The world record time for the 4x4x4 is at least 5 times as much as <br>
the 3x3x3.<br>
<br>
The world record time for blindsolving a 3x3x3 is nearly twice as fast <br>
as solving a 3x3x3 with feet, but surely it&#x27;s not easier to solve it <br>
blindfolded (only faster :P).  Speed and difficulty don&#x27;t necessarily <br>
correlate to each other.<br>

No, I mean standard deviation.  Sometimes they are small, sometimes 
they are large, so I say they are all over the place.

What I like best is his &quot;PLL recognition&quot;. Looks like I&#x27;m closer to 
what Macky&#x27;s way than to what Dan recently mentioned. Will try to 
fully understand what Macky describes...

Hey,

Yes I think it will.  I&#x27;ve already experimented with doing ZBF2L on
the 4x4x4 and had positive results, and once I am comfortable with all
the ZBF2L algs on the 3x3x3 I am going to start relearning them for
one-handed solving since I think it will help for that too.

I mentioned a little bit about my 4x4x4 ZBF2L solving on my ZB
progress page
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/myzb.html

Once I am completely comfortable with using ZBF2L on the 3x3x3
normally I&#x27;ll start working on the other categories.  I think ZBLL is
a bad idea for the 4x4x4 since it is possible to have two corners
switched (which can be tricky to recognize and cause problems
sometimes), so my 4x4x4 strategy will most likely be just ZBF2L / COLL
/ PLL.

Also on a side note I&#x27;m getting lots of sub-20 ZBF2L averages, and I
set a non-lucky 12 second solve already using ZB techniques!  I&#x27;m
improving slowly but steadily.  I think I&#x27;ll go sub-19 fairly soon,
maybe in a week or two.

I still don&#x27;t know if ZB will compare to Fridrich or Gilles&#x27; method,
but I am of course trying to see how well I do when I have practiced
the system more.  Of course I&#x27;m curious if the method will help me
improve my times, and I&#x27;d be happy if it would, but I&#x27;m just having
fun learning a new method right now.

          <div class="email-content">Make it into a simple commutator.  Using simple setup moves (D2 B2 and then either R2 or L2) twist the bottom layer around and turn the bottom layer edges in question so they&#x27;re on the top.  Then apply your Z permutation algorithm.  I&#x27;ll work on a shorter solution, but that&#x27;s a good way to start.

I use R E B&#x27; U2 M2 U2 M2 B E&#x27; R&#x27; for that case.

Or also R E B&#x27; M2 U2 M2 U2 B E&#x27; R&#x27; works as well, whichever is faster.
 I would probably use the second one.

Btw Macky, on the serious side. There are lots of rumours about what

the zb stuff. What is the truth? Probably u have all the answers to 
this at ur site, but it&#x27;s nice to see it here in the group as well.

Many congratz on ur new avg Macky !!!! **fanfare**

When will u seriously pick up speedcubing the 5x5x5? I know that u 
have done sone awesome times on the 4x4x4 so it&#x27;s not really much

How about this:
D2 (M S D S&#x27; D2 M&#x27;) D&#x27;

I used to swap two edges of the first layer with the middle six moves 
a while ago.

Cheers!

Actually, do it upside down for higher speed:
U2 M&#x27; S&#x27; U&#x27; S U2 M U

Hey!

Wouldn&#x27;t this be faster using M and E instead of M and S? Well that&#x27;s 
just me. And one could tilt the cube slightly to make the S almost

Hey,

Well, there are many speedcubing methods that you could learn, but the 
Fridrich method is the most common.  If you are interested in learning 
it, try to learn to do the first two layers (F2L) intuitively so that 
you can place corner-edge pairs into their proper slots simultaneously. 
Then I would recommend learning PLL algorithms, and then the 
orientations.  There are plenty of websites to learn these things from.

Good luck,
Bob

Hi Per,

   At the Caltech Winter Tournament 2004 Tyson held a &quot;Champion&#x27;s
solve.&quot; I thought that Macky might try it on a Deluxe so I loaned him
one of mine. He solved it in less than 13 seconds. There was a bit of
a mix up, and before he tried the &quot;Champion&#x27;s&quot; scramble on the Deluxe
he solved that scramble on another cube, though it turned out that he
had solved it differently on the Deluxe. When I got home I discovered
that I had accidently loaned Macky the wrong cube, he had done that
solve on an older Deluxe which wasn&#x27;t lubed. There used to be a video
of the (12 point something) solve on Dan Henage&#x27;s page, but it&#x27;s not
there right now. 

Regards,

Hi,

I think that Fridrich is also a good method for beginner.
I started cubing seriously in February and I have a personnal best 
time of 24.77 and a best average of 36.66 with that method.

You really should try to do the F2L steps first by searching 
yourself (or ask someone to explain you the general idea) then 
optimize your moves with the solutions you can find nearly 
evrywhere. But before that, I recommend you to learn the OLL and at 
least both the U and A PLL&#x27;s (U changes 3 edges and A changes 3 
corners) because they enable you to solve any situation on the top 
layer. Then learn some other (for example : 2 opposite edges).. and 
with work you should see your times being improved. ;-)

Good Luck !

          <div class="email-content">If a beginner wants to seriously optimize their times without extreme and outrageous amounts of memorization, they should check out Andy Camann&#x27;s site.  His explanation of the working corner method explanation is fantastic.  Using that method, low 30&#x27;s averages are possible, and from there, F2L is much easier to understand once you decide to upgrade.  One needs not learn all of the OLL or even the PLL in order to average sub-30.  Improving first two layers time is the way to improvement for beginners.  Otherwise, I recommend using either the Petrus method or looking into corners first solutions.  They often require minimal memorization and result in great times and fewer moves on average.  http://rubikscube.info&lt;http://rubikscube.info/> is a fantastic site for such solutions.  Whatever method you choose, good luck and happy cubing.

Yes, I&#x27;ve memorized the different algoritms (mirrors and inverses). 
But have only memorized the cases for a couple (A, B, and F 
configurations).

Right now I cheat by turning the C-G configurations into a B which 
can be done with one Sune. Then I solve B. 

Learning the different cases for each configuration should lower my 
LL from ~23 moves to closer to 15.

          <div class="email-content">well lets just say from what i know,

macky knows a lot.
he pretty much learned how to solve the cube using
corner method, fridrich, and also a bunch of other
methods including ring method.

he can pretty much solve the cube with the other
methods in about 30sec.

in a case like this, its true that learning lots about
the cube, not only the fridrich can really lend a
helping hand by making you really understand the way
the cube pieces moves, and from experience, you can do
many other nifty algs and tricks even while using the
fridrich method.

sincerely,

John

BTW: rumours about macky learnt all the ZB aint true.
i heard it from him myself.

          <div class="email-content">My way of memorising.
I order the cases.
Then I memorise each algroithm in order in my head - just the moves.
I dont always even touch a cube at this stage although sometimes it helps
especially if I&#x27;m choosing between two possible algs.
once they are memorised in my head then I start to practice with them.

Its slow at first because I have to recognise a case, then where it appears
in my ordering, then translate the moves in my head into real moves on the
cube.
The benefit is that I can start using the algs much sooner. and without
having to carry pieces of paper around too much.

Hey all you math people,<br>
<br>
We haven&#x27;t had an interesting discussion lately, so I figured I would<br>
post a question I&#x27;ve been thinking about.  I hope it hasn&#x27;t been asked<br>
before, but here goes.<br>
<br>
I visited my cousin not too long ago and was cubing a little bit, he<br>
can&#x27;t solve the cube yet but is interested to learn how.  I was giving<br>
him some puzzles to solve (6 move patterns such as R2 U2 R2 L2 U2 L2)<br>
to get him started before I start showing him the full solution.<br>
<br>
Anyway he gave me a puzzle and told me to make a position such that no<br>
two stickers of the same color are touching on any face.  I started<br>
from a solved cube and did the superflip, but then he said that the<br>
diagonal X&#x27;s on the faces count as two like colored stickers touching<br>
since they share a corner.  He also said that I should do this so that<br>
diagonally across an edge should count too.  So that would mean that<br>
the F sticker of UF is adjacent to the U stickers of both ULF and URF.<br>
 I had a hard time thinking of a way to do this, but I found one.<br>
<br>
Switch every corner with it&#x27;s opposite across the body diagonal of the<br>
cube (4 transpositions), then do the superflip and viola!<br>
<br>
My question is though, is this the only position where this works? <br>
The puzzle is to find a (of course legal) position on the cube such<br>
that no two adjacent stickers (either horizontally, vertically, or<br>
diagonally if on the same face - or horizontally or diagonally across<br>
an edge of the cube) are the same color.<br>
<br>
My alg to set this case up is a bit long, 2 permutations and then the<br>
superflip, but I used Cube Explorer to find a shorter move: D&#x27; U F2 .<br>
B L R D&#x27; B2 R2 D&#x27; B F&#x27; R B2 R&#x27; F2 R&#x27; (perform on a solved cube).<br>
<br>
Is this the only possible position?  By that I mean this type of<br>
position performed on any of the 24 possible rotations of the cube.<br>

&gt; position performed on any of the 24 possible rotations of the cube.<br>
<br>
In my last post I forgot to mention this also includes all possible<br>
rotations of the corners.  So switching every corner with its body<br>
diagonally opposite corner, then doing the superflip, then allowing<br>
the corners to have all 3^7 possible orientations gives 2187 different<br>
positions such that the puzzle my cousin gave me is satisfied.  I<br>
meant, is there a different permutation of the pieces that, given you<br>
fix the orientations correctly, still satisifes the puzzle?<br>

Hi Per,

Hmm...would you please tell me where on earth people talk about me 
(or anyone!) having learned all of ZB? =)

My method is Fridrich with the following:
- extended cross when possible
- other block approaches to F2L when appropriate
- F2L using empty slots with cross on bottom or left
- multiple algs memorized for most c-e pairs used in such a way that 
there is minimum pause (_not_ to control edge orientation)
- avoiding 4 wrong LL edges when fixing the fourth slot (but only 
when it flows nicely from the rest of the F2L)
- the nicer patterns from COLL when all LL edges are correct (if it&#x27;s 
not a nice COLL, I just use the normal OLL pattern but still know 
what corner permutation it&#x27;s going to end up with.)
- PLL recognition by blocks of same colors; AUF at end or beginning, 
never both
- slamming down the cube pretty quickly ;)

I know several algorithms for each F2L, but I haven&#x27;t actually sit 
down and memorized their effects on edge orientation. 

Like Ron (read the comments on his new record!), I&#x27;m doubting the 
theoretical benefits of ZB. The number of moves in ZB is very 
appealing, but I find that F2L is much faster without it. Of course, 
maybe it&#x27;ll all be very smooth once you master ZBF2L.

I used a new 25th anniversary cube (best of the 20 purchased) to set 
the new average. The cube is pretty lubed right now...I thought until 
now that stiff (but soft) cubes work better for me (because I&#x27;m not 
very fast at LL), but this cube is very nice. It is true that I used 
a Deluxe at one point. It was with a Deluxe that I came very near to 
the 15 sec barrier. The only reason I haven&#x27;t touched it recently is 
because it&#x27;s not tuned, and that takes longer than buying new cubes. 
I have to thank David for the Deluxe, of course. I plan to work much 
more with it once it&#x27;s adjusted. =)

I don&#x27;t think that I will ever work too much with the 5-by. I&#x27;m 
finding it much harder to pair up the edges for this size than it is 
for the 4-by. I&#x27;ve never even had a sub-3 min solve!

I did think at one point that you had learned most if not all of
ZBF2L, since at the time I thought you did COLL for nearly every solve
(because of the frequent PLL skips).  I don&#x27;t know how or why I got
that impression, but I will admit that I may have spread a rumor or
two that I thought you had or were learning ZBF2L.

Hmmm ... How did u manage to pop it? I still haven&#x27;t been able to pop 
it. And i have popped most kinds of cubes ;-) I have popped 10-15 
pieces on a rubiks.com 5^3 .. same on 4^3. I have popped a center only 
on the 4^3 (that is weird). I have popped half a eastsheen 5^3 (that 
was kinda fun). And i have popped another arched 3^3 also (cheap 
brand). But the DIY has resisted all my attempts at popping it :-P

Hi Chris

If I understand you correctly, the position generated by 

F R L2 U&#x27; R2 L&#x27; U&#x27; D2 R2 F D B D F2 U&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; F2 D2 L2

also solves the problem.  I found it myself, but because the position 
has a lot of symmetry, you can find the optimal generator on Jaap&#x27;s 
pages on symmetrical patterns:

http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/symmetr1.htm

It is pattern 3g: supertwist+superflip+pons-asinorum.

I haven&#x27;t tried to find any other solutions...

Hi Macky!

Or u prefer ppl call u Shotaro? Well, most simply call u Macky so i 
just follow suite :-)

The rumour about that u know all zb stuff (or at least a large part 
of it) i cant really recall where it comes from. It&#x27;s something i 
heard almost a yr ago now. Which means u must have learnt it really 
quickly since it was very new at that time ;-) So indeed i was 
sceptical about it.

And yes i agree with u that a &quot;simple&quot; method can be just as fast or 
faster than a more sophisticated method. Cause fewer cases to 
distinguish and u get less time lost in recognition, better flow and 
better lookahead. Even if u should learn optimised fingertricks for 
700 algs it won&#x27;t help u much if u need 1 sec to recognize a case :-
o 3 steps is then 3 lost secs ...

What is the difference between the 25th anniversary cube and the diy-
kit? I mean also the geometry of the cubies, not only the 
assembly/tuning.

Cheers!

Congratulations!  Your account of the first attempt was interesting, 
and the fact that it didn&#x27;t work out completely has got me interested 
in trying this: admitting a bit of fallibility somehow made it seem 
more (not less) possible.

Thanks.  I&#x27;m glad it sparked some interest. :-)  It&#x27;s really a lot of <br>
fun, though it gets a bit frustrating when you fail a few times.  It <br>
just made me want to solve it that much more every time I failed.  I <br>
was determined to spend as many attempts as it would take this morning <br>
to solve it, so I&#x27;m glad it took only one. :-)  You should definitely <br>
give it a try, though. It&#x27;s quite addicting!<br>

Now, something I didn&#x27;t understand (either from your account or from <br>
Stefan&#x27;s page) is how you associate orientations (3 possibiities) with <br>
your 2-colour object mnemonics for the corners. How does that work? Do <br>
you have three objects to choose from for each corner, for example?<br>

Hey Mike,

those are some interesting solutions to this puzzle.  I guess it 
wasn&#x27;t as difficult of a puzzle as I had previously thought :)

I liked that one position where the edges were all switched in pairs 
and then flipped, that was a cool way to do it.

So given 2187 ways to flip corners for each of these solutions it 
seems we have found a few ways to solve it :)

I actually had to ask him about that, too.  You only have to 
remember the first two colors, going clockwise.  For example, if you 
look at a solved cube and hold yellow on top, right in front, then 
the URF cubie is (with my color scheme) YGR.  Note that there are no 
other corners that have green next to yellow in the clockwise 
direction.  Thus, you can identify it instead just by yellow green 
(what I would memorize as Sprite :-D).  It takes a little bit of 
extra thinking at first, but it is easy to check by visualizing 
where that piece goes.  Does this clear things up?

Well, the first one did only take a minute or two, constructing by 
analogy with your own corner-permuted example.  The second one wasn&#x27;t 
really &quot;constructed&quot;, but I noticed it when I used Cube Explorer 3.56 
to generate all the other positions with the same symmetry as the 
first.  (I hadn&#x27;t got as far as &quot;3j&quot; when looking up the other pattern 
on Jaap&#x27;s page!)

Not quite that many: the corners can&#x27;t have every possible orientation, 
because their facelets mustn&#x27;t match the centres. ;)

They can&#x27;t because the corners were opposite their correct positions
so the 3 colours on the corner are all distinct from the 3 colours of
the adjacent centres.

That&#x27;s right for Chris&#x27;s example, but not for mine -- in which only the 
edges are permuted.

I thought that was the example under discussion - guess I should have
read all the messages in the thread. Sorry about that.

Ryan Patricio and I decided to meet at lunch this week to<br>
practice some cubing together before the Caltech tourney...I figured <br>
I might be able to compete<br>
with him if I use two hands versus his one hand.<br>
<br>
Well...<br>
<br>
Yesterday, we had a mini-competition...5 cubes, computer scrambles on <br>
the Stackmat...15 seconds pre-inspection, etc...Ryan did<br>
32.93, 31.35, 27.35, 30.06, 35.10...one handed. I choked ;-) best<br>
of 29.10 for me.<br>
<br>
Today, Ryan came in and started doing 29&#x27;s, scrambling for himself.<br>
I decided to quit being lazy and &quot;officiate him&quot;  on another set of <br>
five computer scrambles...His times:<br>
<br>
25.02, 28.48, 32.39, 24.24, 28.74<br>
<br>
average of 5, throwing out high and low: 27.41<br>
<br>
He then did two more cubes, which was all he could get in before the <br>
bell to his next class...  32.73, 30.37<br>
<br>
The average for the 12 &quot;official&quot; solves over the last two days:<br>
29.942...it can&#x27;t really count for anything...but each solve is <br>
amazing to me.<br>
<br>
None of the solves were officially lucky, but he said the 24 and 25&#x27;s <br>
were easy cases for him...I didn&#x27;t save all of the scrambles, but<br>
I did write down the scramble for the 24.24, and gave it to him.<br>
<br>
His dexterity and finger speed is incredible.<br>
<br>
My hope for myself is to be more competitive with him, with two hands <br>
(versus his one hand).<br>
<br>
Oh, he also did some 16&#x27;s and 18&#x27;s two handed... ;-)<br>

I put in some practice last night and it payed off with a personal best time of 22.19 and an average of 29.31 a few hours ago.

Yeah, videos videos videos! Even if he doesn&#x27;t break the record I&#x27;d 
still love to see him do such great times. Make sure you zoom in on 
his hand :-)

Depends on the puzzle and the algorithm. Without that info, it&#x27;s 
impossible to answer.

Hey Mike,

I think you should learn the 1 look corners and other special cases
for your method if you are interested.  It sucks to spend so much time
learning and not taking averages, but the payoff later is so nice. 
I&#x27;m starting to be of the opinion that the more algs you know for the
last, non-intuitive, steps of your method the better off you are. 
Look at all the sub-15 cubers - they all know tons of algs and/or
useful tricks and can do all kinds of cool special case solves at the end.

Also, I&#x27;m sorry to get on my soapbox but everyone seems to seriously
doubt ZB lately.  I definitely do not, and the averages I&#x27;ve been
doing lately are definitely making me think ZB will be a useful
speedcubing system.  I had to _really_ work with Fridrich to get
sub-18, and to get sub-18 with ZBF2L I only had to get my first
average where I only screw up once (since the slowest is eliminated).
  I can&#x27;t wait till I know all these algs really well and have moved
them to my subconcious.

I don&#x27;t know if ZB will ever be sub-15 or anything crazy like that,
but I think I can beat my own personal best Fridrich average using
ZBF2L and that at least is motivation enough for me to keep learning it.

But Mike, I definitely think that you should learn the special case
algs for your method.  I guarantee that you won&#x27;t regret it.

Chris

  Hey Mike,

  I think you should learn the 1 look corners and other special cases
  for your method if you are interested.  It sucks to spend so much time
  learning and not taking averages, but the payoff later is so nice. 
  I&#x27;m starting to be of the opinion that the more algs you know for the
  last, non-intuitive, steps of your method the better off you are. 
  Look at all the sub-15 cubers - they all know tons of algs and/or
  useful tricks and can do all kinds of cool special case solves at the end.

  Also, I&#x27;m sorry to get on my soapbox but everyone seems to seriously
  doubt ZB lately.  I definitely do not, and the averages I&#x27;ve been
  doing lately are definitely making me think ZB will be a useful
  speedcubing system.  I had to _really_ work with Fridrich to get
  sub-18, and to get sub-18 with ZBF2L I only had to get my first
  average where I only screw up once (since the slowest is eliminated).
    I can&#x27;t wait till I know all these algs really well and have moved
  them to my subconcious.

  I don&#x27;t know if ZB will ever be sub-15 or anything crazy like that,
  but I think I can beat my own personal best Fridrich average using
  ZBF2L and that at least is motivation enough for me to keep learning it.

  But Mike, I definitely think that you should learn the special case
  algs for your method.  I guarantee that you won&#x27;t regret it.

  Chris

Ha! That is exactly the reason why I&#x27;m forgetting some of my OLL.
School work is fun, but it leaves no time for cubing. ;)

You can&#x27;t take off the center caps from 25th anniversary cubes, so <br>
you can&#x27;t tune them. They have arched centers, bad stickers, very <br>
noticeable imperfections of plastic on the legs of corners.... <br>
Quality varies from as bad as Chris recently described to as amazing <br>
as my new cube. A lot of them have a bump on the core that makes one <br>
layer click with every 90 degree rotation...I can&#x27;t tell you about <br>
DIY because I don&#x27;t have one, but I&#x27;ve tried a few, and they can be <br>
pretty amazing. DIY&gt;25th.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the main problem with normal cubes is that you have to <br>
buy a few before you can get a good one. Studios are all very nice, <br>
but not any nicer than the best Oddzon cube.<br>

(Will also depend on your operating system.)

But Stefan, the puzzle is the 3x3x3 -- this is the Huge Optimal 
Solver in the later versions of Cube Explorer, so we know pretty 
accurately what the algorithm is, too.  My own experience of various 
puzzle programs that push the limits of available memory is that the 
amount needed at startup can be 50% greater (or even worse) than what 
it settles down to later.  

Sorry, GameOfDeath, but I have only 512MB on this machine, so haven&#x27;t 
been able to try H.O.S. myself, but would like to -- surely someone 
here has used it?

Hey!

I have run the HOS of the Cube Explorer. I have &quot;only&quot; 1 GB of RAM 
so that was obviously enough for me. Im sure it helps to close down 
all other applications before running it. Internet Explorer or 
Microsoft Office could steal 100&#x27;s of MB of RAM without u noticing 
that anything is slow. So when u run the HOS it&#x27;s better to close 
all other apps on ur computer. As for the algorithm it&#x27;s of course 
just the same 2-phase algorithm, but with a much larger pruning 
table. That&#x27;s indeed why u need so much RAM, to have the table 
loaded in memory ;-) And also the sourcecode for the Cube Explorer 
is freely available. Im not sure if u are allowed to modify it in 
any way. And it could also be that u have quite a task at hand 
installing external packages into the Delphi IDE. Cause i haven&#x27;t 
tried it out yet ...

Cheers!

Everyone is just trying to consolidate their position in the list, so 
they are frantically pulling off 30 averages pr day in order to get a

Just kidding of course. Probably just a coincidence i guess :-)

My guess would be that a lot of people were capable of such averages 
before, and that one person getting their position on the list caused 
others to want to solidify their spots.  A trickle down effect if you 
will.

Oops, ok, didn&#x27;t realize that. But you gotta admit it&#x27;s a terrible 
name, too general. Should be &quot;Kociemba&#x27;s HOS&quot;, then I would&#x27;ve known

I still turn in all the really big assignments ;-)

In all seriousness though, I&#x27;d probably be a better student if I never
discovered speedcubing, but I try to keep a good balance of coursework
and cubing practice.  I hardly practice on days where I have a paper
due the next day, or if I have a big test the next morning.  But, on a
light day for coursework I cube a lot to make up for my lighter
practicing days.

So I&#x27;m balanced I guess.  Plus Caltech _is_ a better school than UNC,
so I imagine that my coursework and homework load isn&#x27;t as much or as
difficult as yours.  :-)

Pen spinning&#x27;s real popular at my school (KAMSC) cause they bring all 
the math and science geeks to one magnet school.  I only know two

branch of SevenTowns :D Imagine to be paid for checking the quality 
of cubes. And not least the pleasure to toss crap cubes in the

Hi, all!

I recently had a look in this group and though I do no speedcubing I 
saw that there are quite a few questions concerning my progam. So I 
joined this group now.

Concerning the huge optimal solver:

1. You should definitely have 1 GB of RAM to run it. It will not run 
with 512 MB because the big table alone needs about 800 MB.

2. You should use a fresh rebooted system to run it then because 
Windows tends to steal much memory for other purposes (file buffering 
etc. ...).

3. It does not use the 2-phase algorithm because it is an *optimal* 
solver.

4. I removed the source code of the last versions from my homepage 
because it tends to become more and more ugly with all this
additional stuff about web-cam, symmetry editor etc., but I will send 
the source code of version 2.25 which contains the essential 
algorithms to everyone who is interested in it.

5. My provider t-online will shut down his old server, so the old
link to my homepage will become invalid within the next two months. 
Please update your link to

I&#x27;ve started using this now, too. So far I&#x27;ve always done AUF first to 
solve two corners (usually ULF and ULB), then with a second look 
recognize the PLL fully. Now I&#x27;ve drawn pictures of all the PLLs and 
their blocks and from some first experiences with it I must say I like 
it a lot.

One question, though: Do you really define blocks that strictly? For 
example, consider case n3 and n9. According to your definition, 
they&#x27;re equivalent. Both only have a triple-block of a corner and its 
two adjacent edges. But n3 has another &quot;non-adjacent block&quot;, two 
corners which share the same color on one side but the edge between 
them has a different color. But they&#x27;re still easy to identify as a 
&quot;non-adjacent block&quot;. Do you use this or do you differentiate them a 
different way?

I think I&#x27;ve heard of the block-approach before, but never thought 
about it much. What recognition methods do the other top (PLL) cubers 
use?

And a question for top F2L cross on bottom cubers: When you for 
example do (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27;), do you prefer using right thumb to 
push or using left index finger to pull the U&#x27;? I noticed I&#x27;ve been 
using the thumb but the index finger seems to do a much better job.

Cheers!
Stefan

Oh, and one more question for Macky: You say

- &quot;in PLL you need to AUF before you can see which pieces need to be 
permuted&quot;
- about even &quot;better&quot; methods: &quot;eliminating the need for any AUF&quot;

This sounds like you have to do AUF for the block recognition 
approach, which I think is exactly wrong. Can you clarify this?

Also, here&#x27;s the shortcut for anyone interested:

Thanks - I was wondering if I bought a Windows machine whether I
should get one with 2GB but I guess that won&#x27;t be necessary. Optimal
is good - I have lots of potential 20 move positions to try to optimize.

Thanks.

&gt; I think I&#x27;ve heard of the block-approach before, but never thought <br>

cubers <br>
&gt; use?<br>
<br>
Hi Stefan,<br>
<br>
I never actually learned any methods or tricks for recognising the PLL <br>
cases. But I saw Macky&#x27;s &#x27;block&#x27; approach, and I must say it looks <br>
quite like what I have always been doing. I just look at what pieces <br>
have the same colours on the same side... But I can also recognize <br>
some cases without seeing a block, just because I have seen it 100s of <br>
times :D. <br>
<br>
Btw, I am looking forward to see you again, Stefan ;), bye!!<br>
<br>
Joël.<br>
<br>
P.S.: What does AUF mean? All I can guess is &#x27;Align U layer First&#x27;... <br>
Is that what it means?<br>
&gt; And a question for top F2L cross on bottom cubers: When you for <br>
&gt; example do (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27;), do you prefer using right thumb to <br>
&gt; push or using left index finger to pull the U&#x27;? I noticed I&#x27;ve been <br>
&gt; using the thumb but the index finger seems to do a much better job.<br>

The program is CubeExplorer by Herbert Kociemba.
The project is a multi-stage project, it&#x27;s the advanced blindfold
method - &quot;Blindfold Cubing For Seriously Sad Savants&quot;, a sequel to the
intermediate method &quot;Blindfold Cubing For The Seriously Sad&quot;, which is
a follow up to the basic method which is available on the web. The
intermediate method is probably more advanced than most people would
care to try to learn, although it is possible to get useful
sub-methods from it. The advanced method is part of a bigger project,
but I need to get that finished first.
The current stage of the project is the optimization of the
orientation algorithms (in HTM - I may be mistaken but I think Cube
Explorer doesn&#x27;t optimize in QTM). I was able to obtain some time ago
that this subgroup has diameter 20 (that is, that 20 moves is always
sufficient and that 20 moves is sometimes necessary (the necessity was
already well-known as witnessed by the superflip)).
Originally, of the 94.518 isomorphism classes in the orientation
group, I didn&#x27;t have better than 20 move algorithms for over 90,000 of
them (that&#x27;s partly because I stopped optimizing and went on to get
the diameter first). Now I am reducing that number. Currently it is a
little under 2,400 (plus 11 which are definitely optimal at 20) and
I&#x27;ve got about several of those running on Cube Explorer now to try to
shorten their paths to less than 20 before optimizing - clearly if the
optimum is say 19 moves then reducing 20 to 19 and then optimizing
means that one would only have to search through 18 (but not wade for
ages through 19). Of course, some are quite probably going to take 20
moves and therefore will not be reduced by this method. Then I will
have to optimize them (most likely by checking that all the
(isomorphim classes of) neighbours need at least 19 moves - this is
equivalent but can be done in stages and therefore takes less resources)).

Actually it&#x27;s pretty stupid to call it that, especially if used

guess i started the pen spinning craze.

i wonder if joseph liao got into it?

macky started pen spinning after i msged him on his
website.

i got most of it.

but im working on doing some tricks with a quarter
coin, like the finger pass hehe.

Contrary to what you wrote, I started pen spinning after another friend 
of mine IMed me (this was mid-march. you left the comment on my c-box 
on 4/3). He&#x27;s a hobby lover and has done some cool stuff like card 
throwing...of course, I taught him to cube, too.
It&#x27;s pretty funny that we all started pen spinning at around the same 
time!

I&#x27;ve always been interested in different kinds of manipulation, mostly 
because there are workshops on zippo, cards, poker chips, and even 
butterfly knife manipulation in some juggling festivals I go to. I know 
several jugglers who are serious about cubing, too.

Hi Stefan,<br>
<br>
&gt;One question, though: Do you really define blocks that strictly? For<br>
&gt;example, consider case n3 and n9. According to your definition,<br>
&gt;they&#x27;re equivalent. Both only have a triple-block of a corner and its<br>
&gt;two adjacent edges. But n3 has another &quot;non-adjacent block&quot;, two<br>
&gt;corners which share the same color on one side but the edge between<br>
&gt;them has a different color. But they&#x27;re still easy to identify as a<br>
&gt;&quot;non-adjacent block&quot;. Do you use this or do you differentiate them a<br>
&gt;different way?<br>
<br>
Good point. I differentiate those two by looking at whether the <br>
corner opposite the triple-block is permuted correctly (or rather, <br>
whether those two corners share a same color). I like your definition <br>
of &quot;non-adjacent block&quot;...that&#x27;s essentially what I use to decide <br>
which of the 4 G permutations I have. For now, I&#x27;m going to be lazy <br>
and place a link on my page to this discussion.<br>
<br>
&gt;Oh, and one more question for Macky: You say<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;- &quot;in PLL you need to AUF before you can see which pieces need to be<br>
&gt;permuted&quot;<br>
&gt;- about even &quot;better&quot; methods: &quot;eliminating the need for any AUF&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;This sounds like you have to do AUF for the block recognition<br>
&gt;approach, which I think is exactly wrong. Can you clarify this?<br>
<br>
Right, my fault. What I should have said was that there&#x27;s never a <br>
need to look behind the cube...but I&#x27;m not sure that having to do <br>
this with the block approach makes you any slower. I find it much <br>
more intuitive and easier, anyways.<br>
(By the way, do we have different definitions for AUF? I thought that <br>
both methods have AUF, either before or after the permutation <br>
algorithm itself.)<br>
<br>
&gt;And a question for top F2L cross on bottom cubers: When you for<br>
&gt;example do (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27;), do you prefer using right thumb to<br>
&gt;push or using left index finger to pull the U&#x27;? I noticed I&#x27;ve been<br>
&gt;using the thumb but the index finger seems to do a much better job.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Cheers!<br>
&gt;Stefan<br>
<br>
Index works much better for me as well!<br>

<br>
The results for the 3-colour Fewest Moves Challenge are now available on my website - www.cubestation.co.uk - and are definitely worth a look!<br>
<br>
This week we will have a normal challenge, and I would like to get as many people involved in Fewest Moves Solving as possible. It&#x27;s becoming a very popular solving exercise, maybe one day people will be as enthusiastic about it as speedcubing! Maybe.<br>
<br>
There are lots of experts now, who I am sure would be willing to help out and answer any questions, and you can definitely learn from them by browsing their solutions to previous week&#x27;s scrambles using the FMC archive.<br>
<br>
There is a lot of skill, lots of techniques, and a bit of luck involved in creating a winning solution, and it&#x27;s a great puzzling exercise for the mind!<br>
<br>
I hope you will all decide to try it out this week, and if so, Best Of Luck!<br>

Heh heh, 

I also have picked up pen spinning, but only to a very minor extent
probably compared to you guys.

I can do the forward and reverse thumb spin on both left and right
hands, and I&#x27;m working on twirling the pen through all 4 fingers (Kam
does it briefly in his video, I guess it&#x27;s the most basic
manipulation).  I can keep up the illusion of constant flow for a few
seconds sometimes, but most of the time as I transfer from my pinky
finger to the index again I have a quick jerk in the pen&#x27;s motion
which doesn&#x27;t look so cool :(

One of the guys in my cube club in high school was an extremely good
pen spinner.  He wasn&#x27;t as good as Kam, but watching him do a lot of
the tricks he did did look kinda like Kam&#x27;s videos.  I think he&#x27;s been
pen spinning for about 4 years, so he&#x27;s had a lot of practice though.

Thanks for the clarifications...

Hmm, don&#x27;t know about you but for me &quot;AUF&quot; just means &quot;adjust U face&quot; 
(or layer) in a very general way and sometimes I do it twice before 
PLL. Until now after OLL I did this:

1) Find two &quot;non-adjacent&quot; but &quot;connected&quot; corners (if any)
2) AUF so that these two corners are solved (or so that two diagonally 
opposite corners are solved) and rotate the cube so that these two 
corners are on the left side.
3) Recognize PLL case
4) Sometimes: AUF again (in case of corner 3-cycle)
5) Rotate the cube
6) Apply PLL algorithm

Wow, now that I write it down this detailed, it looks like a terribly 
long list. Let&#x27;s see what I hope it&#x27;ll look like with the block 
approach:

1) Find the blocks, in other words: recognize the PLL case
2) AUF and rotate the cube
3) Apply the PLL algorithm

Hi Macky

-1-January 2004 ( my chat with your friend)

      makimoto2000us (05:19:50): Thanks. for your linking to my 
site. I will link to you sooner or later.

 I never see my link:))

-2-  Macky the cube freak webmaster..................

&quot;Gaetan Guimond&#x27;s Corner Method &quot;

&quot;An extremely fast orientation-first method for the corners&quot;

But where is my link at your webmaster ?:))

You do not ask why I have not had upgrad my website for one year and 
half. If not I would have added many link!

--3-  Imagine, Gilles Roux is a FRENCH people and he don&#x27;t link for  
me! I don&#x27;t had a minimum cuber.

     What it would have been on a deserted island. EX: Petrus, Guss 
and several others. 

The simple ideas can be excellent but some will not underline or 
will see only the facility or none:)) I invent a corner first PURE 
method and I&#x27;m a first big cheater in the world. 

I repeat I don&#x27;t pretend the better but I will never die!  I wish my 
link but I don&#x27;t real wait. I like Andy too but I suppose many more 
his beautifull webmaster sub20 (same link same method:)) than me:)) 
Anyway I add coming soon the link cubefreak &amp; cubestation for the 
différence 

The cube game is not a chess game, welcome to my circus, look my 
official Guinness paper message (on file) 15398.

bringing this up in the community and that I only sent that e-mail  
because I was really mad.  There&#x27;s no reason for me to bring it up  
because it will be brought up and when the time comes, and when it is,  
I won&#x27;t have to do anything.  I&#x27;m not being arrogant.  I&#x27;m just  
confident that I&#x27;ve been an honest person and people will respect that  
when the time comes.  I&#x27;m confident that I don&#x27;t lie to everyone and  
that I don&#x27;t misrepresent my abilities.

The time will come.  I&#x27;m sure word of what happened today will spread  
but I&#x27;ve also decided that it&#x27;s better for me to let this just go.  I&#x27;m  
not going to be the one who spreads it... so if you really want to  
know, just listen and ask around.

          <div class="email-content"><br>
Hello!<br>
<br>
When I started learning when to use which alg (I´m talking about <br>
Petrus also) I first started to learn the Complete Step 6+7 index. The <br>
way I did it was to look for &quot;color-pairs&quot; (if a edge and a corner <br>
share the same color on one face (not U-face) they are a color-pair). <br>
Then I made a table with all the 8 different configurations. I divided <br>
the different cases by the number of color-pairs and learned which alg <br>
belongs to which case. This way I made block so small I could learn <br>
all the cases in one block in on sitting. Some configurations were <br>
easy to learn because of symmetry and few cases where as other took <br>
lots of time.<br>
After that I started with the Complete Step 5+6 index. At this point I <br>
used most of the algs in the index. I only had to learn a few new ones <br>
and it is quite easy to reconize which alg to use where when you know <br>
which corners it flips.<br>
<br>
I definetly think I did it in the wrong order. I should have started <br>
with the Step 5+6 index because that way I can avoid getting in most <br>
positions in the other index.<br>
I still know most of Step 6+7 index so If I can skip Step 5 I still <br>
know what alg to choose.<br>
<br>
I´m sure there are way better ways of learning these things but this <br>
was how I did it.<br>
<br>
Hope it helps,<br>
Mikael<br>
<br>
&gt; Any tips on memorizing when to use the algorithms? <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; For the method I use (Petrus) there are 12 cases for each <br>
&gt; configuration. What&#x27;s the best way to learn when to use what <br>
algorithm?<br>

The 2005 Rubik&#x27;s World Championships will be held in November. Will <br>
the current 20 second world record be broken?<br>

Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m still experimenting with new methods and here are some tips I put<br>
on my page of things that have helped me to improve.  I know some<br>
people do intuitive stuff to flip edges while doing the last c/e pair,<br>
and I know some people are learning a handful of the algs as well.  I<br>
tried to write these tips for both groups, but of course I can relate<br>
more to the learning algs aspect of it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, in case anyone is interested here are some of my thoughts on<br>
the method.<br>

The answer to your question is based solely on opinion.  Personally, I 
have found the Rubik&#x27;s DIY kits to be better than all other speed 
cubes I have tried.  I would not buy any other cube to prepare for 
speedcubing.  I also spend hours when I get them to make sure they are 
exactly how I want them. :)  I&#x27;m sure others have different opinions...

          <div class="email-content">The normal 25th Anniversary cubes vary a lot in quality.  Macky bought  
20 from me and found the best ones and seriously, you could get like,  
your normal averages, maybe +1 second on these cubes.  Then you put  
some lube in and you&#x27;re just fine.  Some of the most amazing cubes I&#x27;ve  
seen in the last few weeks have been straight out of the box 25th  
Anniversary cubes.

The 25th Anniversary cubes in my opinion are just fine.  It is of my  
opinion that cubes may all start off at different places, but a bad  
cube can be worked in to become good.  Of course, not many of us are  
willing to wait that long.

Just don&#x27;t be the guy that says that you are too good for any speedcube  
because your fingers and arms are too strong so you pop everything.  I  
met him yesterday.  It was fun.

I&#x27;m sorry, I don&#x27;t take things very well.  You&#x27;ll probably notice my  
small or not so small jabs here and there for a bit.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Everyone,<br>
<br>
As you may know, Will Arnold absolutely shattered the foot-cubing <br>
record at the tournament last Saturday.  I met Will and he&#x27;s actually <br>
very new to speed cubing and the method he uses right now is very <br>
elementary and inefficient.  I was hoping the community would help him <br>
come up with a method that would allow him to solve faster and of <br>
course, we&#x27;d have to optimize it for his feet.<br>
<br>
What do the current foot-cubers use?  I think it would be interesting <br>
to compare your methods and his and actually more specifically, your <br>
technique.  This was the first time I&#x27;ve seen foot-cubing so I have no <br>
idea what the different styles are.  However, I am lead to believe that <br>
the other foot-cubers out there do daily life activities such as <br>
opening and closing doors with their hands instead so they do not <br>
practice their toe dexterity on a day-to-day basis.  What I&#x27;m saying <br>
is, Will right now can make about 1 turn per second meaning if he knew <br>
Fridrich like I knew it, he would get sub-60 solves all the time.  With <br>
our help and maybe some ingenious toe tricks, Maybe we can see some <br>
sub-40s?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m still fuming a little bit of last Saturday but I think I&#x27;ve calmed 
down to the point of sanity now.  Basically, I had a run-in with a guy 
who claimed that he didn&#x27;t use any method to solve the cube and that he 
could solve the cube intuitively in under 20 seconds.  Later, he 
claimed that it was almost time to reveal his ultra-secret and amazing 
method.  The whole thing about this guy is that he comes to my 
tournament from a very far place, doesn&#x27;t compete, and then proceeds to 
insult everyone, not just me, not just the tournament, but people in 
practically every country, including Mr. Ernö Rubik himself, and 
then... doesn&#x27;t compete and his excuse is that no cube is good enough 
for him because his arms and fingers are so strong that he pops 
everything.

If you say you can solve a cube in under 20 seconds, show me.  Get up 
on that stage with the timer, and solve for us.  It&#x27;s that simple.  
Solve it in under 25 and I&#x27;ll believe you.

Seriously... and saying that Mr. Rubik is lazy because he doesn&#x27;t go to 
the tournaments?  Doesn&#x27;t he have cancer or something?

I&#x27;d challenge him to crush my fingers with a handshake grip.  I&#x27;d be 
willing to wager my fingers... and I was a musician before I even 
learned to cube.

Quite so.  I&#x27;m sorry to hear that there was other unpleasantness, too.

Since his average in 3 attempts was about 265 seconds, does that mean 
his current methods needs around 265 turns?

Tyson,

I&#x27;m quite sure I know (and knew) what you were talking about. But do 
you understood me? Please notice how I wrote &quot;Him&quot;. Meant to say 
you&#x27;re surely talking about God, since He&#x27;s the only one who could do 
that as far as I convinced.

Well, He probably doesn&#x27;t even need a method because He can peel off 
all stickers in a split second. Or let them peel off themselves and 
fly to their correct spots.

Ok, a little more seriously: I do believe one could solve the cube 
sub20 with a completely &quot;intuitive method&quot;. Just not without a method 
in the intuition. 

Cheers!
Stefan

Speedcubing with logical thinking and reasoning is impossible.
All good cubers use intuition only, it&#x27;s a synonym for immediate
cognition.
Making more or less sophisticated things intuitive (thanks clever or
dumb techniques - rehearsed sequences, case recognition and so on) is
the art of speedcubing.

Just noticed a curious contradiction: this (alleged) sub-20 fellow 
has &quot;no method&quot; but promises to reveal his wonderful method to the 
world at a later date. :) 

Perhaps he means a method whose individual steps could be understood 
using only a small amount of logical thinking and reasoning, like 
the &quot;Fridrich&quot; F2L or the early phases of most other methods, such as 
your own.  Later steps, too, if you used simple commutators &amp; 
conjugates.  Of course, as you suggest, learning to apply it at speed 
would eliminate even that small amount of thinking &amp; reasoning.

All right, I could believe in the existence of such a method after 
all.  Let&#x27;s hope we see it someday.

Mike

          <div class="email-content">Intuition - wish I knew what it was.  Here is a Cambridge Dictionary
defnition &quot;the feeling that you know something without being able to explain
why&quot;.

With most sophisticated things when people say it is &quot;intuitively obvious&quot;
they have either worked on similar things so long that, by analogy, they are
confident that know how to do them (and could almost certainly explain why),
or they are wrong (which is why they can&#x27;t explain why).

I don&#x27;t think speedcubing fits this definition anyway!

I remember at University that I struggled for months to understand some
things that I would blythely say were inutitively obvious 2 years later!

Cubing is starting to gain a real measure of popularity, and it is <br>
spreading.  As with any hobby, (especially with one as intellectual <br>
as ours), we are going to have to do deal with critics and phonies.  <br>
So far in the cubing community, most of the people here are nice, and <br>
well mannered, but the larger we grow, and the more people we <br>
encompass, the more likely it is that people will not necessarily all <br>
be as respectful.  This guy, sounds like a phony to me, somebody who <br>
showed up, did a little research on cubing, so that he knows what he <br>
is talking about, but is just talking. I don&#x27;t know who it is, and <br>
I&#x27;m not exactly sure what happened, but this is just my impression.  <br>
<br>
In my experience, most of the people that I&#x27;ve talked to in the <br>
cubing community have been helpful and responsive.  I think that is <br>
something that we should emphasize, maybe as core values of being a <br>
cuber.  I think that for us, being a cuber, sure it&#x27;s about being <br>
fast, but there is also a sub-culture of support for everyone else <br>
here.  I&#x27;d like to see that continue.  Don&#x27;t let this one person <br>
taint all the good things we have going on, and all the growth and <br>
potential that we have in our sport.  <br>
<br>
To me, this sounds like a phony.  One of the better measures of <br>
strength and integrity, is doing something while having restraint. <br>
You know like all the movies where the bad guy just goes around <br>
killing people, but the good guy could kill people, but chooses not <br>
to, even though it is a more difficult choice.  I know that doesn&#x27;t <br>
really directly apply, but whatever.  A good speedcube helps, but <br>
most of the fastest solving is because of the brain being ahead of <br>
the hands.  You could still try to solve it.  He could have gotten a <br>
mid-20 or something, and then blame it on the cube...and if that was <br>
the case, why didn&#x27;t he bring his own?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not convinced this was the case, but there was a kid at high <br>
school that I went to, and he was a chronic liar.  He lied about <br>
everything, telling people that he was going to a really great <br>
college, and doing great things.  The only person he was hurting, was <br>
himself.<br>
<br>
Best of luck to everyone, (hoping to see some of you at the new york <br>
tournament with Ian).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Probably.  It involves putting up a cross on the yellow face by putting 
each edge to its corresponding center instead of putting all 4 in the 
right place in relation to each other and then connecting them all.  
Then it&#x27;s first layer corners, middle layer edges.  After that, it&#x27;s 
position last layer corners, orient last layer corners, then use M&#x27; D M 
D2 M&#x27; D M to try and position all the edges and then some really long 
algorithm to fix whatever two edges are flipped.

  &gt; I also noticed the cube (hard to miss!)... and when I got home I fired  <br>
  &gt; off an email straight away to the magazine, hoping that they would be  <br>
  &gt; able to tell me how to get hold of one. Imagine my disappointment  <br>
  &gt; when:<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; &quot;Dear Daniel,<br>
  &gt; I&#x27;m afraid it was a computer generated image, so it woud be rather  <br>
  &gt; hard to send you one.<br>

  &gt; It looked so real though, especially the picture of it in pieces. One  <br>

  &gt;   A cube sighting in today&#x27;s (16th April) New Scientist.  Check out the<br>
  &gt;   picture in the article on superatoms (pp30-33).<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt;   For those in the UK sad enough to have seen the new Ask the Family  <br>
  &gt; series I<br>
  &gt;   noticed a cube flying past in the opening sequences too!<br>

Yeah, 240 moves does seem like quite a bit.  I guess between 120-130 is <br>
more reasonable.  I think the time is lost due to searching for pieces <br>
like when you switch corners, I&#x27;ve definitely got to search for about 3 <br>
or 4 seconds at least.  (Which is why I stopped using Petrus.)<br>

So if you want, you can get a solution in 246 moves and more. But I <br>
wouldn&#x27;t expect you Stefan to be able to get such a solution without <br>
trying really hard ;)<br>

One of them, when he was a beginner, used to need around 5 Sunes in <br>

moves, if you&#x27;re a beginner.<br>

Until recently, I used a solution that is VERY similar to the one 
Tyson described.  In my first couple months of cubing, I would 
average around 100-110 moves.  Though, I believe what I did was 
probably slightly more efficient, so 120-130 moves sounds reasonable 
here.

Yeah! 13.92 is really amazing! I would love to see his videos :).

Well.. Jessica estimated the limit somewhere around 10-12 seconds.. 
But I don&#x27;t think that it can be done with pure Fridrich method. (But 
who knows..?!)

That&#x27;s terrible. I used a commutator, too. Does yours preserve 
orientation? Notice it doesn&#x27;t have to.

No, I applied the Sune *twice* already! Notice you&#x27;ll never need more 
than two Sunes and it&#x27;s probably the easiest and most well-known alg 
for this.

No, I already applied it twice. And I did count slice moves as two 
moves. And you never need do it more than twice.

Yes, I would&#x27;ve had to try *even harder* than I *already did*.

Notice I only used a very small set of algs, didn&#x27;t look ahead (e.g. 
planning two edges of the cross at the same time and other 
sophisticated stuff like that ;-). And there were damn *two* 
middle-layer edges correctly placed but flipped which I solved very 
naively which is why I used 45 (!) moves for those four middle layer 
edges alone (I think that can be called a very unlucky case??).

Had I just tried to follow the steps but used the algs/techniques I 
know, then it would&#x27;ve been far less moves of course. Actually I feel 
insulted now that you think I can&#x27;t do better than that! Just kidding 
;-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Ok I misread, sorry. But in case he uses such a crappy (sorry ;-) 
method he should really learn the Sune instead...

Btw, forgot my point: I believed he doesn&#x27;t average 1 move per second 
for the whole solve. Neither do I average 8 moves per second though I 
can do that with two or three PLL algs. One is the T-perm and the 
other two are 3-edge-cycles. Using solely these for PLL I think solves 
62.5% of the PLLs in at most 2 looks. That was my PLL method a while 
ago (btw, today I learned the remaining two PLLs :-). So I was turning 
the PLL very fast most of the time. But now that I use more algorithms 
it&#x27;s not only harder to recognize but also harder to execute fast. I 
guess Will uses only very few algs and he has practiced them a lot and 
they&#x27;re probably well-suited for it (e.g. mostly twisting &lt;U,F,R> 
maybe). So I don&#x27;t think it will scale as nicely as Tyson suggested 
first.

Cheers!

In the solution/hints booklet that I received with my first cube, I 
believe (not completely sure) that the algorithm they included for 
solving middle edges was TWELVE moves long!  4*12 + 2*12 (for 
flipping) = 72 moves + any moves between edges = ~ 75 edges, depending 
on the efficiency of the middle-layer edges algorithm. :)  Still, I 
admit this is a very unlucky (and unlikely) case.

What about an F2L approach with cross on back during F2L?

This would allow for the pairs to be solved into DR and DL, using
mainly  {D,R} or {D,L} moves.  The cube could be rotated with z turns
to move empty slots into DR or DL.  Also {U,R} {U,L} turns might also
be fairly fast for foot cubing.

There is also the option of doing cross on left, which would also use
a lot of {D,R} turns.

The LL could be done with F2L on the B and LL as the F face.  This
would make for lots of z (seems like it may be fast) and {U,R,L,D}
turns for the alg.

Also, some algs could be recognized with LL as F and then rotate the
cube so that LL will be on D and the alg will then have lots of D
moves, plus recognitition won&#x27;t be a factor since PLL is the last step.

Just trying to throw out some ideas.  I guess if cube rotations in the
x direction aren&#x27;t too hard then a cross on left startegy would work
(or cross on right) and if z rotations aren&#x27;t bad then cross on B
might work.

That must be some record ;-) Well, I only knoww the two 7-move algs 
and this 9-move one: R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U R. There are of course 
others and maybe some are even faster 2-gen algs but I wouldn&#x27;t 
imagine them in a beginner&#x27;s solution...

Maybe there should be a SCC record category for &quot;worst middle layer 
edge alg&quot;. Reminds me I want to submit my record for &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Magic: 
assembling to solved state&quot; (this one I actually will submit).

Cheers!

It does not work.

um indeed.  I guess nobody uses that method anymore (kidding, of 
course).  Do you know who the moderator was?  They may have deleted it.

This thread actually inspired me to write a bit about how I

Mmh, I&#x27;m a bit confused. In the introduction you seem to say you 
recognize the case by always just looking at two adjacent sides. But 
the detailed descriptions seem to disagree.

For example &quot;Corners Only&quot; starts with &quot;In these cases, I first AUF 
until the edges are already permuted.&quot; and then describes how you 
recognize the case after that AUF. Question: How do you recognize that 
the edges are permuted correctly relative to each other? And after the 
AUF, haven&#x27;t you looked at at least three sides now?

Cheers!
Stefan

Yes, I think it&#x27;s better. So I guess you might look at up to all four 
sides as well, for example to find that &quot;corner block&quot;, right?

For case #02, I like how you pull D2 with your middle and ring finger, 
gotta try that (the videos show case #1, though ;-)

I love the block recognition method. Not only did it motivate me to 
learn those darn final two PLLs that I&#x27;ve been wanting to learn for 
months, but I think it will allow me to get faster. Right now I&#x27;m 
still slower with it but hey I&#x27;ve only been doing it for a few days. 
The Y-permutation is my favourite. I see its two blocks and BOOM I 
immediately know what it is. Only the two double-edge-swaps are 
similarly easy for me to recognize.

Cheers!
Stefan

About your PLL 18: You don&#x27;t need to hate that case, not even the 
algorithm. Only the cube rotation ;-) I use the same algorithm but do 
that rotation differently:

Yes, that is possible.

Hehe, that&#x27;s what 3 years of solving LL on bottom will do ;)  I 
switched the videos for case #01 and #02--didn&#x27;t notice that they 
were wrong. thanks.

Yeah, I like it too.  I think that it&#x27;s a very natural way to 
recognize the PLL cases (it is how my mind decided it would 
recognize cases without anybody showing me how), so I find that as 
another advantage to it.

I love both of those permutations.  I think the double-edge-swaps 
(especially the cross swap) are still easier for me to recognize, 
though :-D

Thanks for the feedback/corrections/etc.

Wow.  That&#x27;s a lot better than the way I&#x27;ve been doing it.  I like 
that very much (thought it feels a bit awkward since I&#x27;m not used to 
it).  I&#x27;m definitely going to switch to doing it that way. :-)

Thanks,

Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I had a really interesting pop today.  I was solving at my computer<br>
and had a pop, a 3x1 group (2 corners and an edge) came out.  I was<br>
able to find two of the pieces pretty quickly, but I could have sworn<br>
the other had disappeared in some quantum tunneling vortex or something.<br>
<br>
After about 10 minutes I gave up and just surfed the internet for<br>
about an hour before class, which by the way is a great way to spend<br>
time when you should be doing homework ;-)  When it was time to go to<br>
class I grabbed my bag, one of those shoulder strap computer bags, and<br>
felt a weird lump where the strap was as I put it on.  I figured the<br>
shoulder strap was twisted, but it turns out that the other popped<br>
piece had landed in my shirt pocket, *AND* had been there for the<br>
entire hour I was at my computer without my noticing!<br>
<br>
I feel kinda slow lol, but I thought it was somewhat interesting :)<br>

I know I keep saying this, but eventually I want to add my 4x4 speed
solution on my site.  The solution on my site I consider to be
beginner/intermediate.  I was able to get to about 1:50-1:55 on
average with that method.

The only changes for speed solving are:
1) Solve two opposite centers
2) solve two adjacent centers
3) finish the last two

4) Solve the edges using one of the more common pair up methods
(either 2, 4, or 6).

5) Solve as a 3x3

The only changes are that the second and third pairs of centers are
solved as adjacent pairs.  Also solving the edges is much more
structured as I mention on my site, so that you don&#x27;t have to spend
any time looking ahead.

Chris,

I know exactly what you mean!  I have had several pops that I just 
can&#x27;t find the piece and then eventually I feel stupid because it 
was in plain sight somewhere (never in my pocket though).  That&#x27;s 
awesome. :-)

<br>
Unfortunately, with this method, there are no blocks, no helpful side pieces, or anything I&#x27;ve been able to figure out in order to identify cases quickly.  It&#x27;s making the learning process incredibly slow and difficult for me.  There are only a small few I&#x27;ve learned I can see quickly enough to execute and achieve decent times with, and most of those are when either the corners are either oriented or permuted correctly.<br>

Any advice anyone could offer would be most appreciated.  I have a lot of time to spend in a hospital waiting over the next week with my trusty page of cube notes to pour over.  Thanks in advance.<br>

Maybe we should have a competition for accuracy - a target to hit - perhaps
even you have to name the cubie you are going to pop!

Or maybe someone out there could work up a routine a bit like trick shots in
snooker (for the americans who might not know snooker is to pool as cricket
is to baseball)!

I&#x27;ve recently had a similar experience, though not caused by a pop. I 
was preparing a 2cm 3x3 cube for speedsolving and its center caps are 
smaller than the stickers above them so I had to peel those stickers 
off. I&#x27;ve had missing parts maybe 4 or 5 times. Stupid me was working 
on the floor (grey carpet), imagine searching for a spring that&#x27;s 
maybe 2-3mm long. At one point the orange sticker was missing. I was 
looking for it everywhere. All around me. Even on myself, especially I 
remember rolling out the left sleeve of my sweater because I had a 
feeling it could be there. I even took out a few keys of my notebook

Nothing. Nowhere. I found it later on the *right* sleeve of the

P.S. The cube turned out great, got a 35s average-of-10 with it.

Check out Speedcubing.com&#x27;s site for the LL corners.  Ron explains 
howo to recognize the orientation/permutation algs for corners.  I 
learned from there and after practice you can &quot;instantly&quot; recognize 
the situation.

On a similar note, does anyone think this method could be viable?

1) F2l except one c/e pair (7+7*3=28)

2) insert edge/solve edges (the ones I&#x27;ve got so far average around 6-7?)

3) Insert corner/ orient at least one corner (no clue how many moves this
takes...yet)

4) RH step 4 (12.48)

 

I&#x27;m wondering if I could do something more efficient with inserting the
corner without too many algs...

<br>

Here were the total counts:<br>
<br>
Average number of moves for ZBF2L:  33.37<br>
<br>
Average number of moves for COLL/PLL finish:  21.29 (54.66 if combined<br>
with ZBF2L)<br>
<br>
Average number of moves for ZBLL finish: 12.19 (45.66 if combined with<br>
ZBF2L)<br>
<br>
Average number of moves with my hybrid (VH + 10% ZBLL) system: 53.84<br>
<br>
I had 9 ZBLL solves, 4 of which were unintentional PLL skips after COLL.<br>
<br>
Interesting to notice, is that the ZBLL solves took on average 45.56<br>

personally still think the benefits of ZB are good, despite the move<br>

<br>
Out of all 100 solves my shortest ZBF2L solve was 26 moves, which I<br>
only was able to do 3 times.<br>
<br>
So anyway, I still think ZB is a worthwhile system, but the average<br>
number of moves appears that it might be 45 instead of 40.<br>
<br>
45 moves done at 3.5 moves per second is 12.86, so I think sub-13 is a<br>

Well, Square 1 has one feature that makes it nicer than the 3x3x3 to 
solve.  You can swap two edges or two corners without moving any 
other pieces.  So, the easiest way to break down a three cycle is 
into two swaps of two edge pieces.

Now let me talk a bit about notation.  Jaap manages to do a good job 
of describing (that&#x27;s also where the algorithms are from).  I&#x27;ll try 
to paraphrase.  There are only two axes on which the square 1 can 
move.  You can turn the top or the bottom or you can do a twist 
diagonally across the cube.  The twist is denoted as a &quot;/&quot;.  Turning 
the top and the bottom is denoted like this: (x, y)  Where x is the 
number of 30 degree clockwise turns on the top (30 degrees is one 
edge and 60 degrees is one corner).  y is the same thing for the 
bottom.  x and y can be negative numbers, indicating that the face 
should go counterclockwise that many degrees.

Now, the algorithm for swapping two edges, UF and UL, is (1,0)/(-3,0)/
(-1,-1)/(3,0)/(1,1)/(-3,0)/(-1,-1)/(4,1)/(-1,0) 

This will also swap DF and DR, but after you do the second swap, this 
will return itself to normal.

You also could just get a three cycle algorithm.  To Cycle UF->UB->UR 
do (1,0)/(-1,2)/(-5,1)/(0,3)/(-3,0)/(5,2)/(-5,4)/(-4,0)

And to go the opposite direction, you can just do this algorithm 
backwards.

-Ben.

At the very least everyone should learn the most basic
cases for ZBF2L.  They&#x27;re easy to recognize, and many
are very fast.

It&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve been around these parts, but I am still 
a someone active cuber... Here&#x27;s proof.

Today I (with a couple friends) finished making (the first version) 
of my take on a Rubik&#x27;s Cube Solving Robot.

It takes a while to load, cuz the file is so large. There is a long 
pause when it&#x27;s *thinking*.


&lt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/Cubebot_DivX.avi>


Recorded Friday April, 22, 2005 for a demo to the professors of 
an &quot;Microprocessor-Based Embedded-Systems Design&quot; Course I was 
taking as a final project. (It solves in a little under 38 seconds 
from one measurement I took. That my not be the case in this video.)

It starts off by reading in the 6 faces by perfoming a 360 on each 
face. Then it takes about 27 seconds to *think*, that video was 
taken without the I-Cache or D-Cashe turned on (if you know what 
that means) or with millisecond interrupts turned off during that 
processing, so it could have been much faster (&lt;8 sec). It was 
running at 20Mhz Bus Speed and off a Motorola Power PC chip (the 
MPC823, very ancient).

It&#x27;s an embedded systems design, meaning it can be easily made to be 
portable. (It does *NOT* rely on an computer for processing.)

It goes counterclockwise always, and overshoots... a protocol the 
same (or opposite) to what the DeepCube people used. We just wanted 
to get it working..., I can go in a modify it now that we know it is 
precise enough not to lock-up more then say 1% of the time... though 
I would put in an &quot;anti-lock-up&quot; protocal that detects-and-reverses.

It is applying a breath-first search for the cross..., does the 4 
c/e-pairs, CLL, and then ELL. (The LL according to my personal 
algorithms.) This was pretty close to a method I used to use, before 
moving onto something much more insane. It is essentially what Guus 
R. Schultz and/or Akimoto uses/used as well.

It does c/e-pairing in a fairly sophisticated manner different from 
what is usually seen in stage-based solver programs I have seen 
before.

Averages 69.1 quarter turns (i.e. QTM) in an average of 100,000 
runs. Though counter-clockwise is currently executed as a 270 
rotation. It never does more then 270 on a face during solving. All 
these figures can be readily optimized now that everything else is 
reliable.

And yes, it is dangling a few inches from the table due to us having 
to wire it up in a rush not using any ties to the frame. It can 
stand on 3 points of the frame as well. Just simple aluminum frame 
and some precise whelding.

Oh, and that is NOT the standard color scheme, it is my own.

BTW, if tHe bandwidth gets terrible, feel free to mirror the file 
elsewhere..., say on speedcubing.com.

          <div class="email-content">Wow, competition ;-)

you know, I hate to tell you this because you will probably end up
beating me, but mike reid (sp) has a very nice implementation of the
kociemba algorithm in C, that is what I currently have deepcube using.

I am very curious though on how you got the cameras to work, as I have
been having lots of trouble with color recognition, maybe shoot me an
email sometime, or if you have aim my screen name is     Gates Evan M

while on a somewhat similar topic, I just got back from the Los
Angeles county science and engineering fair with deepcube as a year
two project, placed first in my category :-) and ended up winning the
sweepstakes, meaning first out of all the first place projects :-D

I&#x27;m in a very good mood right now, just thought I&#x27;d share ;-)

good luck with the new robot, I&#x27;ll have to get serious again ;-)

Until next time, Happy Cubing

          <div class="email-content">Thats great.  This may be a stupid question but does it effectively solve
blindfold?  That is: is the solve worked out from beginning to end before it
does the first move, or is it rescanning the cube continually, or once it
has scanned once is it calculating the new position while its moving?  Or is
there another option of which I haven&#x27;t thought!

I&#x27;ve gone through 3 new Rubik&#x27;s 5x5x5 and they all suck. The first one <br>
wasn&#x27;t too bad but was very hard to turn, even after lubing and <br>
playing with it for a month. I recently bought 2 more hoping for a <br>
good one but these are worst. <br>
<br>
&gt;From the first turn of the cube pieces just wanted to start twisting <br>
out. The molding of the plastic is very poor. The cube looks lumpy and <br>
out of square. I contacted customer services, but just got the ship it <br>
back response. <br>
<br>
Now I&#x27;ll be out shipping and have to pray that the replacements are <br>
usable. <br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve purchased and used all the available 5x5&#x27;s on the market and <br>
these are by far the worst. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, on deepcube,

After the scramble, and any other moves that people do on it (as I now
have a nice GUI with which a user can do any moves that he/she likes
;-)), the moves are stored in a file.  When someone presses solve, the
computer does those moves on a virtual cube, so that it knows the
state of the cube.  It then passes this state to the solver (slightly
modified version of mike reid&#x27;s solver) and passes the solution to a
file.  This solution is then converted to motor commands, and output
at the right times.  So in essence, yes, it does blindfold.

One more question for Doug, how well does the visual feedback work for
the motors? I was thinking of trying something like that, but the
motors that I currently do not support it in any simple fashion.

hahahah, that&#x27;s hilarious! something similar has happened to me, it
was very interesting. about five cubies popped, which is quite a lot,
and because of the way I was holding the cube, I dropped it. AND
because of the poor quality/age of the cube I was using, it more or
less exploded on impact with the floor. I found about 12 pieces, but I
didn&#x27;t find the rest of the pieces OR the central axle, which is the
weirdest bit of all. a couple weeks later, I was cleaning my room
(finally) and found that it had bounced inside of a rolled up poster
on my floor....

Hi everybody.<br>
<br>
I am a speedcuber from Taiwan.<br>
<br>
where the 2x2 4x4 5x5 cube manufacturer Eastsheen is located.<br>
<br>
it&#x27;s great to join this forum since there are very few people in <br>
Taiwan who speedcube.<br>
<br>
And it&#x27;s also very difficult to get Rubik Studio cubes(well I don&#x27;t <br>
even have one.) and rubiks.com Cube from Taiwan, we can only get <br>
them through internet and wait for the long long shipping trip from <br>
North America to Asia.<br>
<br>
<br>
This speed timer is made by one of my friends in the Rubik&#x27;s Cube <br>
Club in my university.  Hope this may help.<br>
<br>
http://nctuyoyo.twbbs.org/~file/tool/speedtimer/<br>
<br>
please tell me if you found any problem using the timer.<br>
<br>
btw, it&#x27;s already known that it&#x27;s not working correctly through the <br>
browser Firefox :(<br>
<br>
I will make another one with Java in a few weeks(exams are coming <br>
right now), which will be able to record the timers and calculate <br>
average and will display the time in larger font.<br>

Yes but a nice software u have made. Can anyone tell

use CubeTimer but are there any other better ones?

Raul Garcia and I are the unofficial record holders in the Blindfold <br>
Team Solve (BTS) category (one person holds the cube but never looks <br>
at it...the second person sees the cube and tells the first person <br>
what moves/algs to do but the second person can&#x27;t touch the cube).  <br>
We&#x27;d like to see more people in this category but that means having <br>
two speedcubers who live near eachother.<br>
<br>
Last night, Chris Hardwick and I tried a version of the BTS that two <br>
cubers can try even if they don&#x27;t live close together.  Chris would <br>
mix up his cube, hold the cube in front of his webcam, and close his <br>
eyes.  I watched his webcam and told him (over the phone) what <br>
moves/algs to do.  We even tried ZBF2L on some of the solves.  Our <br>
best average of 10 solves was about 2:20 and our single best solve <br>
was 1:27.  <br>
<br>
We use a bunch of codes that Raul and I adapted from Katsui&#x27;s F2L <br>
page.  Chris will post them soon in case anyone is interested in <br>
learning them.  Raul and I generally do a 3-look last layer and <br>
we&#x27;ve got names for each of the edge orientation, corner <br>
orientation, and PLL cases.  We&#x27;ll probably do some demonstrations <br>
at the New York tournament next month.  <br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure what the limits are for the BTS over a webcam but I&#x27;m <br>
hoping some of you will try it out.  One thing that slowed us down <br>
was a poor refresh rate for the cam (only about 1 frame per second <br>
and a half) which means I couldn&#x27;t look ahead at all.<br>
<br>
In summary:  BTS is a lot of fun and you only need a webcam (or two) <br>
and a phone (a microphone might be better and cheaper).  Give it a <br>
shot!<br>

Hi all do-it-yourself guys!<br>
I&#x27;ve got a Hungrian Globe which I received as a gift. The one like that <br>
pictured on http://isacisco.free.fr/casserubiks.htm . It was mixed and <br>
I thought that it had to be a piece of cake for me to solve it. I was <br>
proved wrong! One piece is turned 120 degrees clockwise. You wonder how <br>
can a square piece be turned 120 degrees? Right, it&#x27;s the triangle <br>

globe. <br>
Does anybody know how I can remove the piece and place it back <br>
correctly without destroying the whole puzzle? <br>

Hope to see you all again soon at Dutch Cube Day in October... and perhaps even in the UK if there will be an event this year, it wuld be very cool!<br>
<br>
I will post my experience on my webpage (cubestation.co.uk) very soon, with pictures and movies and results. I would be really grateful to everybody there who was taking pictures if they could maybe send me the pictures to my email (danh@...), or perhaps just send me an email to tell me where I can find them? I would like to build a comprehensive collection of media from the event :D<br>

Hello everybody,

It was the first time that i have come to a compation and meet all 
the cubers.
I did have a great time there. And same as Joël the nevers was 
braking me with the clocks and the kubus in the semifinal i hope i 
can get over that :) 

Someone did video my record on the mastermagic sorry i did not cast 
you name :( 
I hope you will react on this forum to stay in contact.

see you all at the next event :)

greets Alexander

I also had a great time! Thanks a lot to everyone for making it <br>
exciting two days, especially Patrick, who organized the whole time <br>
and didn&#x27;t compete!<br>
<br>
Alexander, sorry, not sure who recorded your record. It was a German <br>
(I think Michael), I&#x27;ll try to find out and let you know (I don&#x27;t <br>
think the guys follow this group too closely). Btw, today I practiced <br>
a bit with your modification and it&#x27;s so great. I just got a 3.68 <br>
seconds solve, so don&#x27;t feel too safe ;-)<br>

I&#x27;ll also write some report with pictures in the next few days.<br>

I pretty much built every part from scratch... a lot of whelding had 
to be done, and I managed to do all the soldering myself. I suppose 
I could implement a Kocimba&#x27;s algorithm..., but I&#x27;d rather just keep 
adding various human speedsolving methods. I would like it to 
illistrate different methodologies rather then just solve it as fast 
as possible.

I think I can take it down to under 15s if I want to go for speed, 
which I&#x27;ll probabily do just to demponsrate it&#x27;s abilities.

If it locks up for a few minutes, I can go up to it and fix the lock-
up and it goes on it&#x27;s merry way without loss of memory/state.

HECK, if you turn it OFF, and turn it back on a few minutes later it 
will continue mid-solve.

It currently has a 20MHz IBM embedded processor in it, I can upgrade 
that. Such a chip can be aquired for $15 or a free sample request.

It worked out to be about $200 of parts. So fairly cheap. There was 
about $70 spent on **white** LEDs :(. It cost $50 for the material 
for the frame: aluminum chasis, steel-shafts, high-quality ball-
bearings. I&#x27;m thinking $60 for motors. And $20 for other odd stuff. 

The image processing is mostly done in hardware. There is no 
software processing it much, except to shift some values for 
different lighting backgrounds..., chack ranges that RGB values fall 
in.

The motor control is done with some black posterboard wheels with 
lines on them. They are read by an IR-emitter/IR-sensor pair that I 
put on the underside of the motors. Currently, there are 16 regions 
on each disk, the other side has 32 regions equally spaced, so a 
value can be changed in the software and the disks flipped to double 
the precision.

The motors themselves took several hours to hack and mod for the 
proper calibration, torque, speed and stuff.

It was an inital demo for the professors, better stuff is yet to 
come. hopefully I have time with two final exams left, one in Galois 
theory and one in Probability theory. I want to get it doing in both 
directions in one week, instead of always going clockwise to avoid 
lock-ups. Right now I have to prepare a presentation, report, and 
website for it. That&#x27;ll be due Monday midnight. *sigh*

Note that once the program is uploaded into the processor the 
computer can be dis-connected and the CubeBot is fully functional, 
able to do manual control, say from an old 8-bit Nintendo Controller 
(this hasn&#x27;t been put in yet, current manual control is done with 
some DIP switches and button presses on thh board). It does the 
solve by first scanning the cube stickers in and then taking say 
7.6seconds to *think*. It does some searchs and uses look-up 
tables..., it trys different paths and selects the optimal among 
them, etc.

Hi everybody,


regarding the German Open: it was a pleasure to have you all in 
Germany, thanks everybody for coming...

(@ Stefan: Actually I did compete: new personal best of 21.12 for the 
3x3x3)

However, detailed results are available at 
www.speedcubing.de/events.htm 

Please send me the links to any future reports/photos/videos/etc. so I 
can have a comprehensive link list for the event at speedcubing.de 

Thanks again, Patrick (info &quot;at&quot; speedcubing.de)

Hi,<br>
<br>
a technical question:<br>
<br>
Did anyone of you already tried/managed to connect the speedstacks <br>
timer to a PC (via the output that is used by the competition timer <br>
display)?<br>
<br>
My goal would be to have the time that is displayed on the timer itself <br>
also available at the PC (for further use in excel, etc.)<br>
<br>
Any ideas and/or experience welcome, all the best, Patrick<br>

Oops, I guess I should&#x27;ve checked. I just got the impression you were 
completely busy and devoted to organizing the whole time (thanks 
again!). Btw, that 21.12 also beats all my official times except my 
very easy and lucky record...

Hmm Mirek :-?

That is indeed impossible cause opposite piece will always move 
in &quot;parallell&quot;, so in that case u should expect 2 wrongly oriented 
pieces. In fact the orientations should be 0 (modulo 4).

Actually 90;1832 above is not optimal (optimal is 19 moves).

Dear Mr Jones,

   I was quite interested in the new white plastic DIY cubes.

   Going by the post below I ordered 2 of the new white plastic DIY
cubes from Rubiks.com, however when they arrived I was disappointed to
find the they didn&#x27;t have arched centers.  I trust that your word is
good, so will you please send me two sets of white arched centers? 

   Thank you,

Hi Alexander,

I don&#x27;t like your modification. I *love* it. Today I&#x27;ve got many fast

Back then when he wrote this it was correct (it was way before the 
white cubes, and it *is* correct for the other kits). And the picture

Hi Joel!

Don&#x27;t forget i set NR also. Though my cubing on the larger cubes was 
terrible. I really need a screentimer to pace myself (something like 
jess&#x27; timer is perfect). I know exactly how fast each step should be 
to keep my top-speed :-)

- 1 layer  @ 30 secs
- middle layer edges @ 60 secs
- last layer @ 95 secs
- complete w all centers @ 145 secs

That&#x27;s my &quot;average average&quot; lately.

Hehe ...

Hi Stefan,

The picture for the black DIY kits also showns flat centers, but have
arched centers from the newer tooling. 
https://secure.rubiks.com/lvl3/index_lvl3.cfm?lan=eng&amp;lvl1=produc&amp;lvl2=rubbrn&amp;lvl3=diykit&amp;lvl4=cubasy

Also the picture which you showed is different from the picture I saw
at
https://secure.rubiks.com/lvl3/index_lvl3.cfm?lan=eng&amp;lvl1=produc&amp;lvl2=rubbrn&amp;lvl3=newrls&amp;lvl4=cubwkt
which is similar to the black product picture,

You&#x27;re right, those pictures are indeed wrong.
What does this have to do with the white cubes?

The picture is quite small but I think it shows flat centers. Simply 
click on &quot;larger photos&quot; and you&#x27;ll see the one I showed you. I also 
got my cubes today and they look exactly like on the picture. So 
where&#x27;s the problem?

I don&#x27;t think you should complain when they did something *right*, 
just because they&#x27;ve done a mistake somewhere else.

Btw, what did rubiks.com say when you told them about this?

Cheers!
Stefan

Hi stefan,

Now i realy need a stackmat :) 
Im also trying to beat my rec but when i record it with my cam its 
hard to time with a stopwatch. I have one cam vid now thats my 
fastest i timed it a few times and the times where 3.5x 3.4x or 3.3x

Mmh, I don&#x27;t do this, but maybe it would help you to practice finger 
tricks? When Dan Knight&#x27;s website was still there he showed several 
finger tricks and explained the Z-permutation as a combination of 
finger tricks.

It looks like you can print it on one sheet,  it&#x27;s just that the pages 
on the download are oriented goofy,  at least it is for me.  I have an 
old Master Magic and I made one from the download and my pictures are 
identical.  If you take page one&#x27;s picture on the left,  it&#x27;s bottom 
left tile is opposite from page three&#x27;s picture on the right&#x27;s top 
left tile.  Page one&#x27;s picture on the right,  its tile in the top 
right is opposite  page three&#x27;s left picture&#x27;s tile in the bottom 
right.  It&#x27;s like page three is upside down.  If your old Master Magic 
is like mine,  the front and backside tiles that have Rubik&#x27;s 
signature are the same tiles on the download that say Rubik&#x27;s Magic.  
I hope this is what you&#x27;re asking.  I confused myself on all those 
lefts and rights.

Thanks a lot! I looked at it again and indeed it seems to be basically 
correct but something&#x27;s systematically wrong. I think the easiest way 
to fix it would be to swap the left and right parts of either page 1 
or 3. Will tell rubiks.com about it. Also it would be nice if the 
rings on page 1 could be truly connected instead of just overlapping. 
If they can&#x27;t fix it, I might print one page, cut it in half, swap the 
halves and glue them together, then print the other page. Sigh...

Sorry, couldn&#x27;t help jumping on this one :-)

Rotate the top either once clockwise or once counterclockwise and
place it back down (since right now the cube is obviously not a normal
cube, some pieces have two stickers the same color).

Call the faces that we can see U, R, F, going counterclockwise and
starting from the top face.

The corner in UFL has stickers for blue and orange after the top
rotation, and would need to belong in the DFR spot to be solved. 
However the other corner with Blue-orange is in UFR and would need to
be rotated clockwise to be solved.  This puts the third sticker of
that corner, yellow, in the top layer, but the top layer sticker of
UFR needs to be light blue when that piece is solved :-)

Silly cube personal storage container makers :)

This brings up an interesting question, how many positions have one
face symmetrical enough that you can have a container like this, such
that all 4 orientations of the top create a solvable cube?

All 4 corners would have to be the same color, since you can&#x27;t create
corners with in correct color combinations.  Even if you could switch
the U sticker of a corner with that sticker&#x27;s opposite color, the two
side colors on the corner would now be in the incorrect positions for
a solvable cube.

It seems that the edges could potentially not all have to be the same
color, as long as any rotation of the top face created 4 actual edges
for that cube, and seemingly only did a double transposition of them
since you can&#x27;t change the parity without changing the corner parity.
 Also, if the edges appear to flip at all, you can only flip an even
number.

So let&#x27;s say that all the corner stickers on the loose face (the one
we can take off) are orange say.

Obviously if all the edge stickers are the same then there are no
problems, but that&#x27;s boring :-)  Also, as I&#x27;ll show you can have some
top configurations that don&#x27;t have that.

Below the edges are written such that they belong in the spots (in the
same order as written below) UB UR UF UL and the first color shows
what is the top layer sticker, and the second shows what is the bottom
layer sticker.

White-Green Yellow-Orange White-Orange Yellow-Green

So the top layer is somewhat symmetrical, and only has 2 possible
states.  By turning the top once clockwise or counterclockwise you
perform the cycle (UB UL) (UR UF) which is an even permutation (you
haven&#x27;t changed the corner permutation since all the top layer
stickers for the corners are the same color.  Also, no edges flip so
we&#x27;re good there too.

I&#x27;m currently taking a break from writing a big paper due tomorrow
:-D, but I wanted to post that one example to show it was possible. 
Are there any others that work too?  You&#x27;ll notice that the pattern of
the top layer stickers in my example form a plus sign, and each line
of the plus is one solid color.  Is that a necessary condition?

Are there other ways to do this besides the obvious all corners one
color and all edges some other color?  Having all the corners one
color is a requirement of course, but what other cool things can be
done with the edges, if any?

One last thing, notice that if you use a certain edge sticker color in
the top layer, that you can&#x27;t have its opposite color, or same color,
in the side layer of the edges.  This is because any rotation of the
top must be possible, so you have to avoid creating say a red-red or
red-orange edge.

Hi Chris, nice riddle :-) I think you&#x27;ve found the only non-boring 
solution.

Imagine a color (say red) only appears once in either the top four 
edges of the side four. Because we don&#x27;t want a red-red edge it the 
other four can&#x27;t be red. Since that red needs a certain partner, for 
rotation the whole other group needs to be that partner color. If the 
top four are that monocolor group, then it&#x27;s valid but boring. If the 
side four are that monocolor group, then the top four colors need to 
be all different. But then a quarter turn is an odd permutation, 
making it invalid.

So every color needs to appear at least twice (and in the same group 
of four). It can&#x27;t be three because this would force another color to 
be alone. So every color appears either 2 or 4 times (and in the same 
group of four) and 4 is boring. Thus, all colors should appear twice 
and we have four colors, just like in your solution.

There are only two patterns: Cross and Adjacent. We can&#x27;t have the 
same pattern in both groups, this would lead to duplicate edges. Cross 
on top and Adjacent on sides works, that&#x27;s your solution. The other 
way around doesn&#x27;t work (easy to check).

Cheers!
Stefan

Thanks for the information.
I knew that there&#x27;s FMC at Dan&#x27;s cube station,
but I have no idea how to reduce the turns to solve a cube.
I will find this out.
and I am getting started with blindfolded cubing now, do you guys have 
any advice or good website for a starter?
Thanks a lot!

I use two cubes currently, one is really smooth as it is a few 
months old, and another is new and not as smooth.  I can see that 
doing this suggestion could be advantageous, but sometimes I get 
used to turning harder on the less slick cube, so when I go back to 
the smooth cube I over shoot sometimes.  I guess there is an 
adjustment period involved.

I agree. I definitely need to master more finger tricks. It sounds 
like Dan Knight&#x27;s page would have been ideal. However, since I have 
been interested in cubing the site has not existed. Does anyone have 
any data from the site, or can someone provide me with a site that 
has good VIDEO demonstrations for a variety of finger tricks? 

I have seen ASCII explanations on finger tricks (speedcubing.com 
comes to mind) but they are not as effective as having the ability 
to view the finger trick (at a reasonable speed).  

Better still, all the skilled cubists that record video of a fast 
solve or algorithms, how about taking the time to offer up some 
videos on finger tricks?

One would think they would take the time to scramble a cube and use

Yes, but don&#x27;t forget that their cube is already scrambled because 
they can&#x27;t solve it and they only peeled off a few stickers because 
they realized it&#x27;s almost as annoying as trying to solve by twisting.

Ok, now you&#x27;ve understood my question (that maybe was not clear, but I
wanted to use their terminology), does anybody have an idea about the
&quot;standard&quot; value for a 3x3x3?
I should ask this question on Twisty forum, but I&#x27;m so lazy, I never

weight. since water has density of 1gm/cc and volume
measuring instruments are much more accesible, this
will make the measurements more accurate. and if u
really want to be accurate use verniers;)

Haha, that&#x27;s funny. Exactly today I&#x27;m finalizing my thoughts about 
what springs I think will be perfect. I&#x27;m also going to order from a 
spring manufacturer, like I&#x27;ve done before.

But my claim is: They need very *weak* springs. We&#x27;ll see who&#x27;s right 
;-)

Btw, that website doesn&#x27;t load for me. Will try again later.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">I did a cube medal from clay as an assignment for our art course. I <br>
took two photos of it (they are uploaded in the photos section of the <br>
group, the folder named Sebastian). To paint it more easily I <br>
scrambled my cube and copied the position. So it&#x27;s a legal position.<br>
<br>
There&#x27;s a poster in a classroom in our school which shows a timeline <br>
with some stuff about the EU. In the 80&#x27;s there&#x27;s a drawing of the <br>
cube, and it&#x27;s impossible for the same reason: two corners with the <br>
same clockwise order of colours.<br>
<br>
On Dan&#x27;s Cubestation there are four cubes on the lefthand side of the <br>
page, showing the 4 steps of the Fridrich method. The cube next <br>
to &quot;Orient last layer&quot; shows an impossible position again for the same <br>
reason. So cubers sometimes make this mistake too!<br>

P.S. I am shocked to hear that one of the cubes on my website is of the &quot;unsolvable&quot; type. I think what happened is that when I was drawing the cube some pieces popped out and I must have drawn them back in wrong. :)<br>

Hahaha, that&#x27;s great :-) Actually I think the pictures for the first 
two steps are also wrong. Oh Danny boy, what shall we do with you... ;

1. final work done on stretched spring = potential energy 
             
           1/2K(Xsquare) = mgX
     
  where x=distance moved. if you measuare the distance from central
axle to center of cube

        g = gravity acceleration 
        
        K = spring constant

calculate spring constant:

        K = root(2mg/x)

If they sell springs by their K value then you should be able to get a
  good one for the cube. a small mass is good :P

Thanks for the interest. :-)

At the moment the world rankings are in Excel. The hard work is getting all 
results in the same format.....

The unofficial world records are either in Excel (for the popular 
categories) or in the HTML files. Updating every days takes me quite some 
time....
It is taking me more time than I actually like. :-(

For both we are working on good programs. World rankings in PHP, so that 
people can generate personal profiles.
UWR in MS Access, so that it is easier to do daily updates.


Have fun,

Ron

Solve top first and get the sides of the top all the same.  The you<br>
have solid on top and each side has the top of a T .  Next you solved<br>
the middle layer for each color and then the bottom line. No idea what<br>

Are you sure? Where does he say so? If my cubes were checked then I 
certainly didn&#x27;t notice. And I&#x27;m sure my magic (the only puzzle I 
didn&#x27;t give away for scrambling ;-) wasn&#x27;t checked.

          <div class="email-content">Well.. The only thing I can think of, is that you should not be able 
to see what colour any stickers on the back sids have (when you look 
at the front), by painting it, or making your stickers in a weird 
way... Or, for BLD cubers, you can&#x27;t have damaged stickers, because 
that might enable you to feel where certain stickers are.

I did not notice any &#x27;official&#x27; checks on my cube btw, but maybe the 
organizer inspected them a little while scrambling.

I think you just have to trust people, at least until the next 
$1,000,000 BLD event.

In fact, you don&#x27;t even have to modify/damage the cube first to get 
some info about the cube position.  For example, I can feel the edge 
orientations of my Studio cube without even wanting to: every edge 
piece has a slight depression on one facelet.  Imagine what might be 
possible after you&#x27;ve sandpapered your fingertips, just a little...

Uh... shouldn&#x27;t I have kept my big mouth shut there?

dot pattern, M E&#x27;M&#x27;E on a 3x3x3 (hope i used the correct notation <br>
there), affecting a single center on all 6 sides, instead of just the <br>
three i want to switch.  So i was wondering if someone could possibly <br>
explain it again, or send me to a page that has a good explanation, <br>
maybe it will click this time, who knows<br>

I&#x27;ve been messing around with new methods for awhile that have less<br>
algorithms than zb but average less than fridrich. Here&#x27;s the most viable<br>
option I&#x27;ve found so far:<br>
<br>
1) f2l minus one c/e pair 7+7*3=28<br>
<br>
2) pair up last c/e pair 3.5<br>
<br>
3) insert c/e pair and solve edges. (I&#x27;ve found about half of the algorithms<br>
and so far avg. is 7.7)<br>
<br>
4) solve corners 12.5<br>
<br>
It needs 276 algorithms (including reflections and symmetries) and averages<br>
51.7 moves (that might change when I find all the algs for step 3) which is<br>
4 moves less than fridrich. My question is, does anyone think it would<br>
actually be any faster? I think with practice, step 3 and 4 recognition<br>
would be as fast as or faster than recognizing oll/pll.  <br>
<br>
On my page I have almost half of the algs for step 3 and recognition of step<br>
3, but step 4 is not up yet.<br>

   I like the braille idea, but why stop there? Solving it by sound
could get really annoying, and I&#x27;m not sure I would even want to try
solving it by taste. But why not solve it my smell?

   White could smell like vanilla, Blue could smell like coffee,
Yellow could smell like honeysuckle, Green could smell like mint,
Orange could smell like Chocolate, and Red could smell like cinnamon. 

   Of coure any aromas would do so long as they could be told apart
from each other.

          <div class="email-content">Greetings Mr Jones,

   I realise that it&#x27;s probably an effort to put plastic through the
new tooling before you dye it black, but how much effort would it be
to cook up a bunch of white center cubies with arches?

   Lacking that, if the center caps for both the black and white cubes
the same size then I&#x27;d settle for 2 sets of black arched center cubies
with white caps.

Thank you,

David J

I have a personal database of a few cool 5x5x5 ones, although you guys can&#x27;t use them because they use my notation (where f = turn two front layers). One of them for the 5x5x5 is 214 moves or so and I can&#x27;t figure out how to get it better. I could, of course, solve it and get about 170 moves... How many moves do you guys usually take, excluding the 3x3x3 step if there is one? And do you have any ideas for patterns?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I just got back from an 80&#x27;s dance at a really popular local band<br>
scene near my school.  It&#x27;s called Cat&#x27;s Cradle and from rumors I&#x27;ve<br>
heard Dave Matthews band as well as Squirrel Nut Zippers used to play<br>
there before they hit it really big.<br>
<br>
Anyway they held an 80&#x27;s dance tonight, and I went as Axel Rose,<br>
wearing a red bandana, a plaid shirt and jeans (of course with long<br>
hair too :-)<br>
<br>
They had me get up on stage a couple hours in and do a solve.  The<br>
crowd loved it - there were maybe 200-300 people there so it was<br>
pretty cool.<br>
<br>
I wasn&#x27;t able to time the solve, but I know for sure it wasn&#x27;t sub-20.<br>
 I think it was a low twenty though (20-22), which was good for me for<br>
low light and about 1.5 seconds of inspection :)<br>
<br>
Anyway I had a blast, and of course it being a crowd of 80&#x27;s<br>
enthusiasts they loved it.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to share in case anyone was interested :)<br>

Mmmm, yes... I have tried solving with the tip of my nose, but with 
eyes open (not by smell).  Didn&#x27;t succeed.

But I think the braille idea is still too tough as an introduction to 
blindfold solving.  Maybe we could just wear sunglasses instead.

I know when I do this after getting a good time, it&#x27;s partly because I 
want to be sure myself that I don&#x27;t write down or remember a wrong 
time. I don&#x27;t always trust myself ;-)

It&#x27;s also good for when people in some forum post your video or 
directly link to it.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">I solve the last layer of the megaminx by first solving edges and then <br>
corners. That&#x27;s because corners move much more freely than edges, <br>
they&#x27;re part of three layers. Also, no nice &quot;middle layer&quot; twists are <br>
possible. So I do corners last.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been wondering whether the same is true for the 3x3 cube. The <br>
algorithms section of SCC has algs for CLL first, ELL second. This <br>
seems bad for me now. Why not try it the other way around? ELL first, <br>
CLL second. Did someone try this already? Also, is there a comparison <br>

I think what you need is in Bernard Helmstetter&#x27;s pages:

http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/

He lists:

CLL (25 configurations, average:9.18), 
then ELL (19 configurations, average:11.27). 

ELL (13 configurations, average:7.87), 
then CLL (42 configurations, average:11.73)

(His numbers include the solved cases.) So there are fewer (distinct) 
cases for CLL-then-ELL than for ELL-then-CLL, but the average is 
indeed a little better in the latter case.

Thanks, that&#x27;s really nice. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve seen it before, but 
obviously I forgot about it...

Do you know whether his move averages are weighted averages? I.e. is 
it the average over all 42 &quot;distinct&quot; configurations or over all 
12*27=324 configurations? I have a feeling it&#x27;s the former, and I&#x27;d 
like the latter. I summed up the number of moves of all 42 shortest 
algs for &quot;then CLL&quot; and reached 491, resulting in a 491/42=11.69 
average, not 11.73. So maybe it *is* weighted...

&gt; Hey everyone,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  A Rubiks Tournament is planned for Friday 5/27/05, 4-6pm (time subject<br>
&gt;  to change).<br>
&gt;  Location: Westview, 13500 Camino del Sur, San Diego CA 92129-4265 <br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  There is a large number of south cali cubers who are not/have not been<br>
&gt;  represented at the Caltech/other Tournaments and will host the (first)<br>
&gt;  tournament in south california.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  Rubik&#x27;s Cubing has spread like wildfire down here, after Tyson taught<br>
&gt;  me summer of 2004. At Westview Highschool alone, rubik&#x27;s cubing made<br>
&gt;  the feature article of the school newspaper (macky and tyson&#x27;s name<br>
&gt;  included), with safely-said, over 50 cubers and most everyone has seen<br>
&gt;  it solved by a student atleast once.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  The &quot;fad&quot; has of course cooled down a bit but there are still a good<br>
&gt;  handful of dedicated cubers (25-40second) who would love to have an<br>
&gt;  official tournament here for a change.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  Please let me (or tyson) know if you are interested in participating<br>
&gt;  because the possibility of this opportunity solely depends on the met<br>
&gt;  participation.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  Thanks!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I recently have gotten very interested in bettering my 2x2x2 times.  I<br>
had a question about one strategy that I think would help for those<br>
who do a &quot;first layer first&quot; strategy (not Gaetan&#x27;s method).<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s is an example, <br>
Do this scramble on your 2x2x2<br>
F&#x27; R2 U R2 U F2 U&#x27; F R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;<br>
<br>
What if instead of solving one layer, you noticed that doing an R2<br>
will solve two 2x1 blocks, effectively solving one layer.<br>
<br>
So do R2 on this scramble.<br>
<br>
The bottom &quot;layer&quot; can now be treated as one layer, and you can do a<br>
CLL alg on the top, solving the last 4.  So do B U2 B&#x27; U&#x27; B U&#x27; B&#x27;<br>
<br>
Then you just have to solve all the 2x1 blocks that you&#x27;ve formed, in<br>
this example it is B2.<br>
<br>
So if you combine the whole solve you get a very, very short solve of<br>
R2 B U2 B&#x27; U&#x27; B U&#x27; B<br>
<br>
This strategy would probably only really work when the two 2x1 blocks<br>
you can form have opposite colors as the 2 part.  Notice how in that<br>
example the blocks were opposite colors, making it easy to still spot<br>
the CLL case, given that you know to convert the stickers on the<br>
&quot;wrong&quot; corners to their opposite counterparts.<br>
<br>
I imagine this would be very difficult to do for two 2x1 blocks that<br>
weren&#x27;t opposite colors, but of course the strategy would work the<br>
same way.<br>
<br>
Has anyone ever messed around with a strategy like this?  Does it work<br>
well?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris

This is a rather quirky event.  It seems similar to solving one side
with one move.  

I think that trying to figure out the correct CLL alg with a mix of U
and D layer corners might cause severe headaches.  At the very least,
you might lose too much time thinking of the correct alg.  

There might be some benefit in a FMC type of event if you could
recognize and exploit these cases.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Lucas, and all following this thread.

I had my first success in using this offset 2x1 groups as the first
layer approach.  I just got a 5.90 second solve (pretty good for me)
by building two 2x1 groups of opposite colors as my first &quot;layer&quot; and
then solving the last &quot;layer&quot; with a CLL alg.  I was able to read what
the orientation case would be during inspection, and during the solve
I was able to identify the CLL case.  The last part to solve the four
2x1 groups into a solved 2x2x2 wasn&#x27;t hard.

I think this method will be difficult to use for the harder to
recognize CLL cases, but what helpful cool trick isn&#x27;t hard to learn? ;-)

I&#x27;m going to rehearse this and try to use it when it comes up.  It
makes for an easy, fast solve if you can do it correctly.

Hi Stefan,

Almost certain they are weighted, as the figures for &quot;Fridrich&quot; are the 
usual ones.  Why do you need the unweighted?  (Just nosy!)

[Btw, I had looked into ELL+CLL because it would be the obvious way to 
cut my current 3-look LL to 2 looks; though PLL-then-OLL (ugh) would be 
possible instead.  Either way it is too many new sequences to learn.]

Hello Chris,

I think that managing opposite colors during CLL as you proposed (and
as I proposed before, and Ryan even before ;-) ) should not be a big
problem. I can do it rather fast, but I try to avoid it when I want to
be really fast.

I&#x27;ll even be more optimistic than you.
This strategy could work without the need for opposite colors. You
just have to learn to recognize more CLL configurations, in a
different way.

See http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Step_3.html  (Possible improvement)

Gilles.

Yes, it _is_ a pain.  It might also help all those people who time and 
time again cry &quot;Help! Help! how do I swap 2 edges on a 5x5x5?&quot;, etc.  
On the other hand, if they ask that they probably haven&#x27;t worked out 
how to use Google to search for a 5x5x5 solution (or whatever).

          <div class="email-content">Hi Michael!

There&#x27;s a few sticker-swapping &quot;patterns&quot; at Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s site. 

(http://www.stefan-
pochmann.de/spocc/other_stuff/4x4_5x5_algs/#ColorSchemeModifiers)

And of course any 3x3x3 pattern will carry over to 4x4x4 and larger 
cubes n^3. Some do carry over with natural extensions like &quot;cube-in-
cube&quot;. U can make &quot;cube-in-cube-in-cube-.....-in-cube&quot; and so on. Like 
wise with spot patterns u can make new spots inside the &quot;3x3x3 kind 
spots&quot;.

Could u pls post ur pattern collection or give us a link to a webpage? 
I&#x27;d be very interested in finding shorter solution for ur terribly 
long sequence pattern. Im sure some algorithm with reasonable length 
can be worked out somehow (using commutators or whatever to move the 
various parts around without having to resort to the normal pairing-up 
3x3x3 approach.)

Have a look at this really simple pattern that i posted before 
sometime :

(on a 5x5x5 is nicest) r l f b r&#x27; l&#x27; f&#x27; b&#x27;

Quite neat, right?

Cheers!

No way i built that beauty ;-) But i can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on 
one (w stickers on it :-P). I saw that video at Ron&#x27;s place and 
asked him to send it to me. So i compressed it to a reasonable size 
and uploaded to the group :-) I guess it&#x27;s the olympicube in it&#x27;s 
6x6x6 incarnation, since Ron said a greek guy had sent it to him ;-)

Now we can all look forward to buy one some day. I&#x27;d pay lots for 
one of those even if it&#x27;s never gonna on official sale ...

Have fun!

Great to see that video at last, but if it is olympicube, the inventor 
has specifically requested (on twistypuzzles.com) that the video *NOT* 
be made available yet!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris..

It is an interesting strategy... But recognition is a bit of a 
problem.. However, when Fridrich published her method, some people 
thought recognizing F2L pairs would be difficult too :) (I read this 
somewhere). So maybe with practice, who knows? I should first learn 
CLL for this, though.

decided to optimize my method with actual CLL algs wherever my COLL

again but I&#x27;ll definitely try to take you up on your offer of catching
up ;-)

You&#x27;ve definitely got me really interested in learning Gaetan&#x27;s
method.  I guess I&#x27;m so layers-entrenced that I just figured I&#x27;d go
straight for the CLL approach when I started with the 2x2x2.  Seeing
that you can get 3&#x27;s with Gaetan&#x27;s method defnitely makes me want to
learn it though.

Good luck with CLL if you decide to learn it, I&#x27;m learning it for the
first time myself actually, since I use COLL right now.  I&#x27;m only 0.50
seconds behind you with COLL, so I hope learning CLL can make up the
difference :)

          <div class="email-content">Actually, I kinda use a mix of Geatan&#x27;s and the &#x27;CFOP&#x27; aproach that 
I use for the 3x3. Sometimes, I first make one face, then do OLL on 
the other, and then permute both layers (PBL?). Geatan&#x27;s algs are 
pretty easy. There are not that many of them, and they will enable 
you to see a way to orient all pieces very quickly. I can see the 
first two steps pretty often like that. Combined with C(O)LL, 2x2 
can be solved very fast :).

Not sure about continuing learning COLL, though..

I now know about 7 or 8 cases, but some of them really suck... 

Good luck with 2x2-ing!

I have actually thought about this before the competition. Of course 
not as advanced to CLL. I think sub 6 average is possible using the 
way that I solve the 2x2:
1)Shortest amount of moves to complete on layer (solution founded 
during inspection period) (sub 2)
2)OLL (sub 1)
3)PLL (sub 2)
Total:5 seconds+looking between each step
Of course, the times that I got at the last competition didn&#x27;t show -

Hi Stefan,

Almost certain they are weighted, as the figures for &quot;Fridrich&quot; are the 
usual ones.  Why do you need the unweighted?  (Just nosy!)

[Btw, I had looked into ELL+CLL because it would be the obvious way to 
cut my current 3-look LL to 2 looks; though PLL-then-OLL (ugh) would be 
possible instead.  Either way it is too many new sequences to learn.]

          <div class="email-content">I agree with these tips--we usually check expedia or travelocity, 
then go directly to the airline&#x27;s site.  But you should also check 
some other airlines that are not in the databases of expedia etc.  
Jetblue, for example, flies out of both Long Beach and Burbank non-
stop to NY [though they go to JFK, not La Guardia].  Compared to 
LAX, Long Beach is a dream to get through; coming from Caltech I 
don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that much farther to Long Beach vs. LAX.  Southwest 
is also not in those databases, but don&#x27;t think they go non-stop to 
NY.  

Happy travels

Too true -- the recognition problem is difficult. You&#x27;d certainly want 
to keep track of a couple of pieces during the preceding step.

But a 2-look LL is not a realistic goal for me, anyway, regardless of 
the system: I would never be able to spend enough time practising it.

Woohoo, that&#x27;s so great! I love her sitcom. But her talk show is of 
course not on German TV, so I&#x27;ve never seen it. Can someone please 
please record Ryan&#x27;s part and post it?

          <div class="email-content">Resuscitating an old thread I know but I recently started doing something
new and my times and confidence have improved as a result.
I have picked a typical solve and then repeated it over and over.  For

I solved it but as I learned the solve I got it down to 17 seconds (I&#x27;m
pretty sure I can go faster).

I didn&#x27;t really do it as an exercise - I was just amazed by two things
recently - one was Chris estimating a solve time if he turns at 3.5 moves a
second and the other was that 11.52 video.  I just didn&#x27;t believe that I
could turn the cube that smoothly and quickly even if I knew the solve.  Now
I know I can and also I know what it feels like to solve that quickly.

I have found that in my normal solves I am looking ahead better and turning
more accurately and quickly.  I remember that someone suggested this some
time ago as a way of working out how fast your method could be if you got
really good at it.

Anyway for those of us who think sub 20 seconds is a dream then I&#x27;d
recommend trying it.

Good luck

I use two cubes currently, one is really smooth as it is a few
months old, and another is new and not as smooth.  I can see that
doing this suggestion could be advantageous, but sometimes I get
used to turning harder on the less slick cube, so when I go back to
the smooth cube I over shoot sometimes.  I guess there is an
adjustment period involved.

I agree. I definitely need to master more finger tricks. It sounds
like Dan Knight&#x27;s page would have been ideal. However, since I have
been interested in cubing the site has not existed. Does anyone have
any data from the site, or can someone provide me with a site that
has good VIDEO demonstrations for a variety of finger tricks?

I have seen ASCII explanations on finger tricks (speedcubing.com
comes to mind) but they are not as effective as having the ability
to view the finger trick (at a reasonable speed).

Better still, all the skilled cubists that record video of a fast
solve or algorithms, how about taking the time to offer up some
videos on finger tricks?

          <div class="email-content">Hey Duncan, just to throw in my two cents, I think that is a really
good cubing exercise to do, it especially helps show at which steps
you tend to delay.

I never got as fast as some of the others I saw who posted averages
like that on here, but I remember getting 14-15 second averages by
doing the same solve for each solve of the average :-)

Also, in my defense I did mention that I think it would be possible to
average really really fast with ZB at roughly 3.5 turns per second
(which seems reasonable based on the level of cubers out there right
now), but that implies possibly years of practice, or at least solves
where your recognition is phenomenally fast.  I don&#x27;t forsee a
non-lucky 10-11 second solve anywhere in my near future with ZB,
though I hope to get there one day ;-)

AFAIK there is no mention about this in the WCA rules. So in short

The WCA naturally does not support the use of performance enhancing 
drugs and if it does become a problem, then we will deal with it as we 
can.  Unfortunately, it would easily mean raising fees to cover the 
expense of testing.  The way I see it now though, drug testing is silly 
and unnecessary.  Perhaps in the future some drugs will actually help 
people in speed cubing but for now, I can only see it as a detriment.

I agree about taking drugs for cheating purposes.  I was just pointing <br>
out that sometimes people are prescribed things like steroids for good <br>
medical reasons:).<br>

          <div class="email-content">just throwing in my thoughts on the ear plugs
debate... I did use ear plugs during the French Champs
to help me relax, twice during the 1st roud, it didn&#x27;t
pay, because i did a wonderful 22.22 and a great 28.xx
on these solves (yeah i know, shut up everyone) and at
least 3 times during the 2nd and final round. It did
help me then: 15.54 on the first solve, then I forgot
my discman during the next 2 solves (3 solves
actually, I poped one inbetween) and got a 17 and an
18 on the last 2 solves w/ headphones. I don&#x27;t think i
missed something the judge said, the music wasn&#x27;t too
loud anyway.
Shostakovich, preludes and fugues op.87 :-P. There was
even a bit of me focusing with the headphones on
French TV lol... something like, eh, see how much
stress there is in a speedcubing event lol.

---------------------------------
If you use ear plugs and you get disqualified because
you don&#x27;t hear 
the judge, then it&#x27;s your fault.  Same with head
phones.

The WCA naturally does not support the use of
performance enhancing 
drugs and if it does become a problem, then we will
deal with it as we 
can.  Unfortunately, it would easily mean raising fees
to cover the 
expense of testing.  The way I see it now though, drug
testing is silly 
and unnecessary.  Perhaps in the future some drugs
will actually help 
people in speed cubing but for now, I can only see it
as a detriment.

I don&#x27;t think registration is even required on Rubiks.com. It is to
help the organizers get an idea of how many people are coming and what
they are interested in. Is this correct? Registration is still
required in Florida, so I would assume the webpage-registration is for
informational perposes only.

I think &quot;learn some new tricks&quot; is caused by a typo I made while making
some suggestions to improve the registration page...
What it should have said is that we will have the side events for which
the winner will receive a trophy, but that you will also be able to SHOW
your abilities on other puzzles.

Have fun,

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,

Yes, registration is still required in Florida, but that is to know that
you are there, check the events that you want to compete in and receive
your badge and goodie.
You really have to register before the championship! Depending on the
number of registrations we may need to close registration for some events.
Of course we won&#x27;t send you home if you come from far without registering.
:-)
We do expect many competitors, so without preregistration we cannot make a
good time schedule.

It is going to be fun!!!! Don&#x27;t miss it!
>From Amsterdam I found tickets to Orlando for 300 euro. Hotel rooms for
$69 is pretty cheap, and you can share hotel rooms (probably 3 people per
room). You can use this forum to find people to share a room with. :-)

Have fun,

Ron

I wouldn&#x27;t see anything wrong with a hybrid white/black cube in a 
competition either, provided that all the corners had the same colour 
plastic, and all the edges the same colour. Otherwise you could get 
an advantage if you made for example all F2L pairs white and the rest

It has been brought to my attention that a black and white cube mix <br>
would provide an unfair advantage to the solver because you would have <br>
an advantage of recognizing certain pieces.  Therefore, the plastic of <br>
your cubes needs to all be the same color.<br>

About a week ago Leyan in the blindsolving group asked about a timer<br>

volunteered to take that up.  This version doesn&#x27;t include that yet<br>
but is in the works.  The current version generates shuffles for 2x2x2<br>
through the 5x5x5.  It stores all data in an access database.  I have<br>
generated a few reports that will give you some statistical data.  The<br>
file is slightly large, 8 Meg, due to the use of Crystal Reports for<br>
statistical data.  It can be be found at my site at<br>

Or is the preregistration a &quot;fast-pass&quot; to be sure to be accepted in

          <div class="email-content">Hi there.  Using a layer approach with a 4 look last layer, I managed a pair of 30 second solves to start with.  It wasn&#x27;t particularly easy, but I employed a trick I know to permute and orient the corners at the same time.  I average a tad under 30 like this, so I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with how I solved it.  My third time was a 24.  Not bad, I thought.  By the time I&#x27;d finished an average with that scramble, I&#x27;d managed a solve under 17.  I kept going like this for a while, enjoying seeing 1X.XX on the timer.  Eventually I got curious and solved a new scramble.  I got my personal fastest time of 21.16.  If I could reach, Duncan, I&#x27;d give you a hug.  I&#x27;ll check back in after some more of this practicing.

Woohoo, thanks a lot! It&#x27;s so great. Some questions:

- What&#x27;s the song about?
- What&#x27;s written on the paper?
- Does she have a boyfriend?

Thanks,

  Yeah sorry, I over looked that fact.  I think it is reasonable that we 
  mandate that the plastic color is all the same for the puzzles.

          <div class="email-content">The way I see it, people do this already.  If you have stickers that have worn, you can tell where they are by feeling.  If you have tiles on your cube, you&#x27;re already guilty.  They overlap the sides to the point you can see around the edges of pieces.  If you&#x27;re going to disqualify cubes with mixed pieces, it&#x27;s unfair to allow cubes with anything other than perfect stickers and uniformly tensioned sides, and that seems unnecessary.  The last time I checked, WCA rules stipulated something about no modifications to the basic shape or mechanism of the puzzle, but nothing was mentioned of the pieces&#x27; colors.  I think mixed should be allowed.  It would lead to an advantage, possibly, but so does learning COLL for those who are crazy enough =).  Just my two cents.

Hmm, &quot;guilty&quot; makes it sound illegal. Note the WCA rules explicitly

=) My point was that if those are allowed, and they allow ease of identification by seeing around edges of pieces, it doesn&#x27;t follow logically to disallow mixed color cubes.  That&#x27;s like outlawing OLL+PLL for allowing fewer steps, but allowing ELL+CLL.  Non-sequiturs make my brain hurt.

And my orange stickers were so worn at one point that I could instantly tell when I was touching one, which was handy for cases when the piece was on the back side and I needed to see which way it was oriented.  It&#x27;s not a big difference, but neither would mixed cubes be.

G&#x27;day, I haven&#x27;t ported on here since I signed up but anyway..
I tried download your timer but it didn&#x27;t work, all I&#x27;ve managed to 
do is save the page that comes up when I clicked on the link for it. 
What do I do next?

Thanks, Keith.

Just two things: Maybe it&#x27;s a better idea to call the &#x27;shuffle&#x27; 
a &#x27;scramble&#x27;, since this is the term most of us use. Second, I would 
like to request a feature: maybe it would be nice to have an: &#x27;add 
time&#x27; button, so I can use it in combination with my stackmat. Or 
maybe even a &quot;countdown+add time&quot; option, because my stackmat won&#x27;t do 
the countdown for me :).

Tnx a lot,

Joel.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

I think you over-reacted, changing your mind so quickly. Four reasons:

1.) I have been thinking that a cube with black centers and corners
and white edges, and vice versa, would look really cool. It wouldn&#x27;t
give an advantage either.  

2.) I also thought of having all the LL cubies white, because it would
look cool. I have no problem recognising LL positions and the white
wouldn&#x27;t be an advantage to me, but if it enabled other cubers to
recognise positions with ease I would have no problem with that.

3.) I thought of having certain specific cubies white and the rest of
the cube black. That might give enable me to see some F2L things
better, but not be an advantage over others because others don&#x27;t solve
the F2L like I do. :)

4.) Eventually we all may have cubes tailored to our tastes with no
stickers or tiles but the plastic itself colored. (I am suggesting
here a new line for Rubik&#x27;s.com to pursue.)

Anyway, please reconsider, if only for one of the reasons stated.

Thanks,

David J

I think it should be fine. I would approve such a cube if it were at
my tournament.

          <div class="email-content">I do think mixed cubes would give some people an advantage. One of my <br>
methods I use the &quot;first layer minus working corner method&quot; for F2L, <br>
and I know that making all the first layer cubies white, or the <br>
middle layer edges white, would definitely give me an advantage for <br>
recognition.<br>
<br>
As far as everyone being open to the same advantage I guess that <br>
true. But it&#x27;s still a little unfair. Not everyone has access to the <br>
internet to get the white cubes, or is old enough to buy something <br>
online without help from a parent, or whatever.<br>
<br>
As far as feeling damaged stickers go, that&#x27;s harder to control, but <br>
has always been a part of tournaments. The white-cubie thing is new. <br>
And there&#x27;s no reason to nip the problem in the bud right away. And <br>
besides don&#x27;t tournaments often provide new stickers to resticker <br>
your cube if you want to?<br>
<br>
But aside from all that I think there&#x27;s a more important reason to <br>
not allow mixed cubes.<br>
<br>
It changes solving the cube on a small but fundamental level.<br>
<br>
As the cubies exist now, they&#x27;re black with colored stickers. <br>
Recognition is done by the sticker color alone. Adding certain cubies <br>
with different colors now makes two types of cubie recognition. A <br>
small, but I think significant, differance in the existing cube- <br>
solving process. The line has to be drawn SOMEWHERE. It might as well <br>
be here, while it&#x27;s still an easy line to be drawn.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,

I think article 3 of the WCA regulations (see 
http://www.speedcubing.com/events ) prohibits this.
&quot;No modifications are allowed that enhance the basic concept of the puzzle. 
Puzzles may not have any textures or markings that distinguish one piece 
from another.&quot;
And I think it is a good thing, that it is not allowed.
You could have a 5 color cube, where each corner edge pair has different 
color of the two pieces.
It is also not allowed to have small stickers at the edge of each piece, to 
see what color is on the other side of that piece.

Our goal is to have fun in tournaments, and to make sure the best cuber in 
competition conditions wins.
Our goal is not to go faster by changing rules in our favor.

Apart from the rules, I think if we would be on tv, people would consider us 
cheating. They expect to see normal cubes.

I am purist. And proud of it.
Normal cubes rule!

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hello!<br>
<br>
I´ve been following this thread from the start and there have been <br>
good arguments both ways.<br>
<br>
I agree that a cube with different color cubies would make recognition <br>
easier, but on the other hand a two color-cubie cube (that sounded fun <br>
=D) would look cool.<br>
<br>
So why not make yourself this modified cube to have as a cool new toy <br>
and use it for practice. With time recognition would become so natural <br>
that the different colored cubies wouldn´t be needed anymore.<br>
<br>
As Ron already stated the rules, if read carefully, already prohibit <br>
the use of such a cube in competition. This is the way I think it <br>
should be in the future also. After all the competition is much more <br>
than just fast times. What is more important is to meet fellow cubers <br>
and have fun.<br>

Don&#x27;t forget blind people or people with less than two hands or babies 
or those elderly who can&#x27;t even hold a cube at all yet/anymore. 
Speedcubing in general is so unfair to these people. We should have 
rules that allow them to win tournaments, too. For a bonus, I want 
rules that allow them to beat Macky, Lars and Edouard. Please let&#x27;s 
seriously do this.

I&#x27;d rather suggest not to. I think it will actually be bad for you. 
When you learn to rely on this aid and in competition it&#x27;s not there, 
that&#x27;ll hurt you. The environment for learning/practicing should 
optimally be the same as the one where it matters. Makes sense 
intuitively and psychology research supports it, too (for example the 
scuba diver experiment of Godden and Baddeley).

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">So I just applied for what is called highschool summer college at <br>
stanford.  It needs this entire application with an essay and all <br>
that fun stuff.  The essay prompt was &quot;Tell us about a significant <br>
event in your life. How did this event change you, or make you view <br>
your life in a different light?&quot;  Of course, I wrote an essay about <br>
the Rubik&#x27;s cube. So here it is for anyone who would like to read.<br>
<br>
<br>
Life Lessons^3<br>
	The following began on the night of November 19th 2003. I <br>
was at my grandmother&#x27;s house for my cousin&#x27;s 17th birthday.  The <br>
atmosphere was cheery; the room was loud, as it often is when the <br>
whole family is together.  Getting distracted from the event at <br>
hand, I decided to take part in a little sibling rivalry.  My <br>
brother and I took turns on my grandmother&#x27;s stationary bike, <br>
watching the RPM, seeing who could go faster.  When we got to the <br>
hands only category (as the bike had moving handlebars which could <br>
be used in place of the pedals) my brother pushed and pulled his way <br>
to 73 RPM.  Then it was my turn.  I hopped on and started up.  As my <br>
arms pumped like pistons, the RPM meter rose.  The speed shot up to <br>
20, 30, 40, 50 RPM and continued to rise up past 60, 70, 80 RPM.  At <br>
93 RPM, disaster struck.  Due to the torque of my upper body as I <br>
fought with the handles, my bare right foot slipped, and fell into <br>
the path of the pedal.  The pedal struck my heel and violently <br>
jammed my toes into the foot peg.<br>
	A trip to the emergency room revealed a broken foot, and <br>
broken hopes of playing football any more that season.  To the <br>
untrained observer, this event may seem to be an act of stupidity <br>
followed by the deserved punishment.  But in actuality this event <br>
started me on my most intriguing journey to date.<br>
	A day or two later, while surfing the web and chatting with <br>
friends, I came across a video of someone not only solving the <br>
Rubik&#x27;s cube, but doing so in under 20 seconds.  I have a profound <br>
interest in mathematics and computer science, so the idea of the <br>
world&#x27;s greatest puzzle intrigued me, and I followed up by getting a <br>
Rubik&#x27;s cube of my own.  Sadly, I followed the path of most first <br>
time cubists, and got fed up with the cube after a couple of days.  <br>
After a quick search on Google, I found a couple simple and a couple <br>
not-so-simple solutions to the Rubik&#x27;s cube online.  I added the <br>
sites to my favorites, and then went to sleep for the night.<br>
	The next day was a school football game.  Because I was <br>
confined to the bench for the rest of the season, I brought my cube <br>
along for the twelve hour journey.  During this time I began to <br>
understand the basics of the Rubik&#x27;s cube.  I became highly <br>
proficient at following the directions on how to solve the cube.  <br>
After a day or two more, I was solving the cube without the aid of <br>
an instruction sheet, taking about three minutes to do so.  The <br>
addiction had begun.<br>
	From that day until the present I have been on a never <br>
ending quest for speed, learning more algorithms (sets of moves <br>
which produce a desired effect on the Rubik&#x27;s cube) and different <br>
solutions, working my way up.  I have attended several official <br>
Rubik&#x27;s cube competitions, including the 2004 US national <br>
championships, in which I placed 15th out of the 47 cubists who <br>
attended.  Currently my personal best time is 17.63 seconds.<br>
	Now as if one time and life consuming hobby isn&#x27;t enough <br>
fun, try combining it with another.  This was the basic theory <br>
behind my 2004 science project.  I&#x27;m fanatical about the Rubik&#x27;s <br>
cube, passionate about programming, and fervent about robotics.  So <br>
what type of diabolical scheme can you come up with that combines <br>
all three?  That&#x27;s right, the world&#x27;s fastest Rubik&#x27;s cube solving <br>
robot.  My inspiration came from another video I had recently seen.  <br>
Originally, I was planning on building a robot with the same basic <br>
design as in the video, but I wasn&#x27;t content with the speed, or lack <br>
thereof, at which this design solved the Rubik&#x27;s cube; I didn&#x27;t want <br>
to be able to beat my own robot.  So I went about designing <br>
something radically different and ended up with an 18 inch Plexiglas <br>
cube that looks like something out of Star Trek.  The robot <br>
controlled my life for about two months, over the course of which I <br>
wrote the code for it, built it, and tuned it into a lean mean cube <br>
solving machine.  It can now beat the current world record holder <br>
and averages only 11.46 seconds per solve.  The robot took me to the <br>
California State Science Fair, and is unofficially the fastest cube <br>
solving robot in the world, as there has not yet been an official <br>
event for robots.<br>
	In the end, I was able to turn a negative experience into a <br>
positive one.  I set a goal for myself, pursued it, and enjoyed the <br>
journey as well as the destination.  Although I have not become the <br>
fastest in the world, my robot has, and I can solve the Rubik&#x27;s cube <br>
more quickly than I ever thought possible.  Parents always preach <br>
persistence, hard work, dedication, and never using gym equipment <br>
without shoes.  But until you experience the reward, until you <br>
understand the satisfaction that comes with the long hard hours of <br>
determination, you cannot truly appreciate these lessons.  That is <br>
what this experience did for me.  I now know how to go about solving <br>
a problem.  I now understand what it feels like to take on something <br>
of this magnitude.  And furthermore, I know how it feels to <br>
accomplish a daunting task, and it is that feeling that drives me.<br>

Are u really serious Stefan? How would u go about with that? What

It could be that u are ironic ;-)

Handicapped tournaments for ppl who can cube normally are easy to 
set up. One can compare times achieved with that persons normal 
(best) average and work out according to some simple mathematical 
formula. I know that dutch cubers have practised with those kinda 
friendly tournaments :-)

I especially liked the show progress function...its

said that you have no problem with copying and stuff,
so can you please post the source code for the timer?
so i(or whoever else)can make changes to it easily

Yes, purely ironic of course :-)

When Ben mentioned the unfairness of those disadvantages of young or 
poor people I just wanted to take that reasoning to the extreme. If 
for some reason you&#x27;re not able to get a good cube, that&#x27;s not the 
fault of the rules but the fault of life. Do I complain that I don&#x27;t 
have a Deluxe Cube?

Cheers ;-)
Stefan

Just to clarify: That does not mean I think they&#x27;re the best cubes. 
Neither do I think they&#x27;re not. I don&#x27;t have enough experience with 
them (I only played with Ron&#x27;s once and I do have a Game Cube). But 
they&#x27;re at least quite nice.

Cheers!
Stefan

so that won&#x27;t be an issue.  Other problem is I have written most of it
on the fly and the source needs to be cleaned up a lot before I could

Also, to the guy wondering about the best of 12, you have to do all 12

Also, thanks for the compliments.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,

   The black plastic DIY cubes have arched centers and don&#x27;t pop and
are adjustable. The white plastic cubes have slicker plastic and look
cool, however they have flat centers and pop a lot. So if I want an
adjustable white cube that doesn&#x27;t pop I *have* to have a black
plastic center piece.

   I was displeased that the white DIY cubes I got were from the older
model. I complained but no response. So I sent off for 2 black DIY
kits so I could have arched centers on the whte cubes, and have good
fast white cube which doesn&#x27;t pop...

  ...and now you and Tyson tell me that cube is illegal.

   Thanks, but no thanks.

   Of course if a certain company made white plastic arched centers
there&#x27;d be no problem. But that&#x27;s not very likely seeing that I got
*no* positive response to my complaint.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think you should be so quick to blame the cube.  There are two 
factors that go into popping.  The first is, yes, the cube.  Certain 
cubes pop more easily than others.  However, the second factor is the 
cuber.  If you&#x27;re accurate with your turns, then you can turn it as 
hard as you want and you won&#x27;t pop.  This principle is illustrated when 
I was cubing in front of Macky and jamming on a bunch of turns.  Macky 
turns to me, says, &quot;You need to work on your accuracy,&quot; grabs my cube, 
and then proceeds to make a billion turns on the cube smoothly without 
jamming at all.

If the purpose of the white plastic cube is just to look cube and it 
has a negative impact on your cubing performance, why don&#x27;t you just go 
with a black cube?

<br>
The tournament at Horace Mann School in Riverdale, New York is <br>
coming up on Saturday, May 28th.  We&#x27;ve got some really fast people <br>
coming (Macky, Chris H, Ryan Patricio, Tyson) and we&#x27;re doing a <br>
bunch of different events (2x2, 3x3, 4x4, magic, rainbow cube, <br>
square-1, blindfold, one-handed, and maybe fewest moves).  The <br>
tournament is an official one so we might have some new records at <br>
day&#x27;s end!<br>
<br>
After the tournament, everyone is invited to a barbecue (BBQube?) at <br>
my house which is 10 minutes from the venue.<br>
<br>
The school is only 3 blocks from the subway and that Monday is <br>
Memorial Day so if you ever needed an excuse to visit New York City <br>
and do some sightseeing, this is it!<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been looking around for some suitable hotels and I&#x27;ve found a <br>
couple that are relatively cheap and are only a 10 minute drive from <br>
the venue.  If you won&#x27;t have a car, a taxi ride shouldn&#x27;t be too <br>
expensive.   <br>

I think this can be resolved quite easily. Use the black arched 
centers, but use the centercaps from the white diy cube. Nobody will 
be able to tell that the cube ain&#x27;t &quot;all white&quot;. Well unless someone 
disassembles it. And even do noone can claim u have a color 
advantage from it.

Just a trivially easy idea ;-)

<br>
Your timer is my new favourite and I like it a lot. Here are some <br>
suggestions on further improvements though:<br>
<br>
*Delete/Change time without the need of MS Access<br>
*Add 2 sec penalty option/button<br>
*Some additional statistics like standard deviation and median<br>
*Be able to show times over time as line graph in progression. Would be <br>
nice to have both for solve times and averages, and maybe also one where <br>
only improved averages are shown. (my first average made on 2005-05-08 <br>
and new points in the line graph are only added for better averages.)<br>
<br>
Thank you<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hmmm ...

Why don&#x27;t they simply offer a 5x5x5 diy-kit with some spare parts and 
a choice of rivets or screws, just like they have for the 3x3x3. 
Shouldn&#x27;t be much of a problem to do that. And to be honest i think 
they would see the sales of the professor cube increase quite a bit. 
Many prefer the mefferts variant or eastsheen due to it&#x27;s well known 
initial stiffness. A 5x5x5 rubiks.com diy-kit seems like a perfect 
idea to me :-)

As a sidenote a 4x4x4 diy-kit does not seem to be much point. The only 
reason would be if we could glue those core parts together ourselves. 
That is kinda risky, but at least one can avoid some of the bad cores 
that i have seen with skewness and/or elevation. An almost perfect 
core is highly essential for a good 4x4x4 for speeding.

I think I have found a pretty nice area of improvement for me. When <br>
DanH was visiting me a few weeks ago, we had a few (a lot, actually) <br>

the F2L, but I would usually catch up during the LL phase.. Both <br>
ending with about the same time. (sometimes, when he was solving F2L <br>
really fast, I thought, &#x27;oh well, he&#x27;s just saying that :)&#x27;, <br>
remember Dan? ;)). Anyway, today, I timed my F2L and LL (without OLL <br>
regognition) seperately, and I think I barely average sub 10 for the <br>
F2L. Maybe around 11 seconds, but around 6 seconds for the last <br>
layer (just estimating, I didnt make notes yet.. maybe I should).<br>
<br>
Do any cubers here have tips to really speed up that F2L? I think I <br>
know most shortcuts, but maybe I have to cut out some cube rotations <br>
that I do automatically. But how can I train this? Does anyone else <br>

          <div class="email-content">Ya I also have the same problem, albeit on a much
larger scale. Usually my times for F2L are around 45 -
60 seconds. And I also see a lot of improvement
possible in this area for me. Really would appreciate
if anyone gives some tips for speeding that up. Maybe
these times could be in part due to a very bad cube
that i get here, but i think my technique is also bad.

Someday i will reach sub-60 :)

I think the basic feature which is needed is simply MEMORY. Ie the 
robot must do it&#x27;s thinking not solely based on current state of 
it&#x27;s sensors but also past history of the sensors. A few 
intermediate sensors btw one cubestate and the next (while doing a 
faceturn) would help identify what has happened to the cube and will 
correctly identify the next current state. Well something like this 
anyway. Haven&#x27;t thought about it much yet.

And though this would be cool my personal opinion is that is&#x27;s much 
cooler to have a robot twist a normal cube like Evan&#x27;s robot does. 
That way &quot;computerworld&quot; and real world combines to a great effect!!

What robot? What thinking? Could it be you missed the point?

No i didn&#x27;t miss the point. It&#x27;s already far too late and im here at 
uni. OK a robot is not necessarily a physical robot like in Robocop or 
like Evan&#x27;s cube solving robot. Knowing which state the 
cube/program/robot (whatever!) is in will make sure that the correct 
LED&#x27;s are lit up at each external cubie face. The state-space is 
obviously too large for somthing like a neural net. Well anyway it&#x27;s 
too late to explain exactly what i mean ... zzzz ...

I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by &quot;robot&quot;. This is a
design where the cube is still solved as normal, by a human, but the
colors of each cubie are displayed with LEDs rather then stickers. The
only &#x27;thinking&#x27; would take place when the cube randomly changes the
LED colors to make a valid scramble.

I can perform U2 just as fast as R2, and I think f2l on bottom is the best
for looking ahead. Instead of using cube rotations, most of the time using d
or d or d2 will do the same thing and get one U move closer at the same
time.

I really recommend the rubiks.com diy kit. After adjusting mine on 
the day i got it i haven&#x27;t had to do anything since. It&#x27;s turning 
really well for me. Some say that it&#x27;s a good idea to chenge the 
springs on them. I wouldn&#x27;t know cause i never tried it. Anyway with 
screws instead of rivets it&#x27;s fairly easy to adjust to ur own 
liking. U can also make a hybrid diy (i haven&#x27;t tried it) with 
cubies from the white diy and the arched centers from black diy. 
Then put the white centercaps on the centers instead of the black 
ones. U will need to glue the centercaps on so dun use too much glue 
and complete ur tension adjustments before gluing!!

Cheers!

I hope you don&#x27;t mean me :-) These DIYs are actually ok, they do have 
washers, their spring length/strength are ok (could be slightly softer 
but not necessary), the spring ends are somewhat ground (not perfect, 
but at least a bit) and perhaps most importantly their screws are 
great. The thread is only near the end, i.e. the upper part is flat 
and thus can&#x27;t lock up with the spring. And most importantly the screw 
head has a large diameter, larger than the center hole. This way, how 
far you can pull a center from the kernel spider is not limited by the 
spring compressed to maximum (where it reaches maximum strength), but 
by the screw head, and the spring is not compressed fully and thus 
appears to be less strong. I haven&#x27;t tried the white DIYs with their 
original springs (instead I immediately used others) but I&#x27;d guess 
they&#x27;re ok, too, because of the large screw head.

Cheers!
Stefan

Interesting. Have you tried to achieve this same limiting effect with a 
large washer between (small) screwhead and spring?  (Am looking for a 
quick fix, as the only spare springs I have are as strong as those 
already in the Studio cube.) 

In fact it ought to be possible to get any tension you want by 
combining with washers at the opposite end of the spring.  Might try it 
anyway...

Hi Per,

  Yes, I already suggested that:
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/16321

  The caps not being the same makes for small problems but I&#x27;m trying
to get Seven Towns to make a white cube that&#x27;s *really* made for
speedcubers.

  Shouldn&#x27;t have to buy 2 cubes to get one that workd properly.

   I blame Seven Towns. They know very well that the flat centers pop,
and to have them pop less they need to be adjusted too tightly. Those
are the very reasons why they went to arches for their main production
runs. They know as well as I do that the flat centers are no treat for
speedcubers.

   Do you remember that I had several cubes with me at last years
Nationals? Yes, I used two flat center cubes during the 10 cube
no-inspection solves and solved them without popping, but they slowed
me down.  I agree that accuracy helps, but not entirely, not even with
Macky.  
   And at one point that day Macky tried my best flat center speedcube
and it literally exploded all over the place on about his tenth turn.

   The purpose isn&#x27;t just to look good - the white plastic is slicker.

I know it&#x27;s a matter of economy also. They might eventually listen 
to complaints/recommendations. I&#x27;m not sure they understand that the 
diy kits are almost solely bought by speedcubers. So they should do 
these small things by themselves. For both white/black diy kits they 
could provide 2 types of centers, flat and arched. And also include 
the normal vinyl replacement stickers, not the crap laminated ones. 
Though i must admit that the laminated ones that came with my diy-
kit are not all that bad. Much better than the ones on 4x4x4 and 
5x5x5. But it&#x27;s still laminated, so the edges of them dun look all 
that great after a while.

And i hope also they pick up in my idea about 5x5x5 diy-kit. That&#x27;d 
be really really nice :-)

          <div class="email-content">I personally am a big fan of the flat centers because it reduces <br>

Yes, I&#x27;ve already done that and with very good success, but thanks 
anyway :-) The problem is that this means I can&#x27;t screw in the screw 
very much, about 2mm less than usual, and the screws keep getting 
unscrewed during play. I could probably fix this with glue but I&#x27;d 
hate to use glue. Also, I like the screw to be deep inside the kernel 
spider to have bigger stability. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve ordered very weak 
springs today, so that they&#x27;re soft even when they&#x27;re almost 
completely compressed, and then when they&#x27;re fully compressed they 
suddenly block, achieving the effect I want: Small interval for 
movement but very soft in this interval.

I&#x27;ve also started to look for screws yesterday. I noticed that the 
Studio cubes use the same screws as those from the early 80s so 
there&#x27;s got to be a standard. I&#x27;d like to get the same screw thread, 
but only for the lower half of the screw, and flat above. Also the 
screw should be 1.5-2mm longer and it should have a large head (or I&#x27;d 
use a large washer again but I&#x27;d like to use nylon and I don&#x27;t know 
how strong it is and I have to take care about screw head vs center 
cap).

I&#x27;ve recently prepared some &quot;wonderful puzzler&quot; cubes (I think) and 
they already have perfect screws. That&#x27;s why I was able to turn them 
into very good cubes easily just by replacing their too strong springs 
(and adding some washers).

Cheers!
Stefan

Oh well, of course I also cleaned/lubed the pieces. But replacing the 
springs played a major part. The old ones have wire diameter 0.6mm or 
maybe even a bit more and the ends are not ground. Now I use 0.5mm 
springs with ends ground. It makes a huge difference. The springs I&#x27;ve 
now ordered have 0.32mm wire diameter, I hope that&#x27;ll be weak enough.

General question: Did anyone study the effects of different 
springs/washers/etc before? If so, I&#x27;d like to know anything that&#x27;s 
known already (springs are much much more expensive than washers ;-)

Cheers!
Stefan

sllooooow down during the f2l. like practice trying to go without stopping

anyways, hope that helps.

Uh, sorry... maybe we should&#x27;ve continued under a completely separate 
thread. No, I probably can&#x27;t do this with a 25th Anv. Cube, I recently 
tried to get the rivets out of a &quot;normal&quot; cube and did not succeed at 
all, I only hurt myself. But I don&#x27;t think it would be a big 
improvement, just like with the DIYs.

You could of course use a saw to destroy the kernel spider and get the 
rivets out, then replace the spider/rivets with spider/screws from a 
$1 clone cube. Haven&#x27;t actually done so, but it could work. It&#x27;s like 
a DIYDIY, build your own DIY kit...

Cheers!
Stefan

Oh, there&#x27;s also some confusion. I would not want to replace them with 
80s springs since those (among others) are the ones I&#x27;m complaining 
about.

That is what I did.  When the arched center cubes first came out last <br>

Some rivets were too tight and others were too loose.  So I used a <br>

I think I have found a good balance between speed and fluency now.. 
So I am afraid slowing down will not do the trick for me anymore :(..

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

   OK. We know each others preference. I&#x27;d like to turn this thread
into one about accuracy.

   You know those crappy stickers? The ones that most everybody
complains about? I&#x27;ve used them daily on an arched cube for nearly two
years and they only show a little wear. 

  When I got the cube I found that the edges of the stickers catch on
my fingers, so I quit hitting the edge of the stickers with my fingers
and the wear pretty much stopped.

   If you practice on several different kinds of cubes, including ones
you dread like arched- or flat-center ones, too tight or too loose
ones, etc. it can help with accuracy.


Cheers,

David J

You know, the same applies with pianos as well.  Some people who never 
practice on a piano other than their own have difficultly in adjust 
when it comes time for a performance.

The &#x27;crappy sticker&#x27; issue also depends on cubing style.  I use my 
entire thumb on certain algorithms and unfortunately, I have developed 
a rough callous for writing (yes, I occasionally go to class =) ) which 
is usually want contributes to the wear on those paper stickers.

I got some of the tiles from Chris about a week ago.  he said they 
were made from a clear Lexan.  Whatever they are, they fit great on 
any normal 3x3x3 cube and they are much, much thinner than I thought 
they would be--when I got them I thought at first glance that they 
were another set of stickers because all six colors combined were 
about the thickness of a quarter [and that included the little paper 
backing that you peel off to stick them on].  truly no real noticeable 
difference in thickness vs. the ordinary stickers.

definitely recommend them.

   Since those cubes not only don&#x27;t pop but are hard to disassemble
I&#x27;d say someone was playing with your head.

P.S. Actually I left a scrambled cube, with about half of the orange
stickers exposed, in direct sun for about 20 minutes and about those
exposed ones turned darker for a while. They went back to normal, but
I forget how long it took. It wouldn&#x27;t be too hard for another cubist
to memorize a position, stick the orange side in the sun for a bit and
return it to the state it was in before.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Joel,

maybe you should have a look at Pedro&#x27;s &quot;Magical F2L Tricks&quot;.

Also, why don&#x27;t you start analyzing what you already know? You know a 
specific cuber who&#x27;s faster than you, so try to find out why *he* is 
faster. Maybe compare the number of twists and the number of cube 
turns for a start (I&#x27;d also be interested in these numbers).

Cheers!
Stefan

Hi Mikael,

A similar thing actually did happen to me - at least partially.  
Again with orange turning to red and on a high quality studio cube 
(from Ton - my favourite cube).  Only for me it was very confusing 
because it only happened to 2 corners and one edge piece.  I had 
taken my cube apart to lube it and then when I went to reassemble it 
I couldn&#x27;t find the OWB corner - in fact all of my white corners now 
had red stickers.  IF you look VERY VERY closly you can tell the 
difference but it is useless for sppedcubing and I had to steal a 
couple of orange stickers off an inferior cube to keep my good one 
running.  At the time I blamed the transformation on the lube and 
figured that I had been careless while spraying some of the pieces 
and that was why it only happened to 3 of the 8 orange stickers - 
now I&#x27;m no so sure what to think.

yea sometimes slowing down doesnt help.. and in those cases im not quite 
sure what to do (im not quite there yet either),but if you spend a lot of 
time searching for the pair, well then it&#x27;s a great idea to slow down. and 
when slowing down look forward. and whatnot.

and i second the thing on f2l tricks.

idk but i think its just me.

i find that i can track pieces better if i hold the
cube not with the front face facing me, but a little
bit moved about 30 degrees to your left or right as
you solve, you can see and track some pieces quiet
efficiently.

so basically its like holding the side of the cube
facing you :P just like in those java applets.

Hi Peter,

I am very hopeful about being able to go to RWC 2005 pending 
money/employ/ and time off etc.  I would likely be leaving from 
Toronto.  I will be returning to Toronto at the start of June and 
would be very keen on a Canadian cube comp - or even just an 
informal gathering of the cube clan.  Keep me posted.

Rob

I believe so.  Disturbingly bright, anyway.

I actually don&#x27;t know how long my own cube was sitting in the blazing 
sunshine of Manchester, but one person has reported on 
twistypuzzles.com that the orange on his Studio cube darkened after 
just 5-10 min.

          <div class="email-content">Hey :-)

This is a recurring topic ;-)

Short and sad answer is : NO!

Reason is that the wc2005 will be sponsored by Seventowns. They will 
not allow any Eastsheen or other unbranded puzzles for the 
competitions. In theory any cheap cloned knock-off 3x3x3 is therefore 
not allowed. But it&#x27;s real hard to identify those with any great 
certainty. So the ban by and large is concerned with the Eastsheen 
kinda 4x4x4 and 5x5x5.

So my advise is either to buy official rubiks.com 4x4x4/5x5x5 or 
borrow some that u can practise with. If u solely practise the 
Eastsheen and borrow official ones in Orlando u will not be used to 
them and hence u have a large handicap.

The 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 won&#x27;t have to be brand new rubiks.com of course. 
They could be old Arxon or Mefferts or any other which have the same 
mechanism as the current rubiks.com ones. Tiled ones are also allowed 
as long as each face has tiles of a distinct color. And also the color 
of all cubies (the plastic pieces) should be same so as not to give 
any recognition advantage ;-)

Cheers!

How do you know? I&#x27;ve already searched on rubiks.com for puzzle 
restrictions and haven&#x27;t found any. Besides organizational rules they 
only refer to the WCA rules which don&#x27;t restrict puzzle brands at all.

I sure hope so, I&#x27;d like to use a tiled Meffert 5x5 if I can&#x27;t use my 
Eastsheen (I might want to use it anyway, it could become better than 
my Eastsheen once it is lubed).

Cheers!

It&#x27;s great news if there really are no branding restrictions for wc 
2005. But im afraid those restrictions will show up sooner or later. 
They have always been there in the past when Seventowns have 
sponsored competitions.

I assume Ron or Tyson has the final answer to this :-) Or that they 
can help us clarify this with the wc 2005 sponsor(s).

Have fun!

Does that mean they didn&#x27;t sponsor the 2003 WCs? The only contest I 
know of where other brands were forbidden was Euro2004. Any others?

  I, too, am a Canadian that plans on attending the WC2005 in Florida. <br>
  Thankfully I have 6 months still to get better, in an attempt to avoid <br>
  embarrassment. <br>
<br>
  And on the topic of a Canadian cube competition, I would be very <br>
  interested in that, more so if it was before the WC2005.  I have never <br>
  even been in the same room with another speedcuber, so I would love to <br>
  get some experience before the big dance.<br>

          <div class="email-content">For those of you who don&#x27;t know what the E permutation is (not to <br>
insult anyone of course), it switches UFR&lt;-&gt;UFL corners, and UBR&lt;-<br>
&gt;UBL corners.  This case has troubled me for quite some time, mostly <br>
because my previous algorithm took ~2.4 seconds to execute.  In the <br>
overall scheme of things that&#x27;s not bad execution time, but my <br>
desire to have all my permutations under 2 seconds has prevented any <br>
level of contentment.  (sorry I&#x27;m rambling so much guys/girls)  I&#x27;ve <br>
found an alg after some playing around, and it&#x27;s a great improvement <br>
to my previous one.  Here it is:<br>
<br>
x&#x27;(U&#x27;R U L&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;U)(r2 U R&#x27;)(U&#x27;L&#x27;U R U&#x27;)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure whether someone else has found this alg previously, but <br>
it&#x27;s very fluid after some practice.  My times for executing this <br>
case are ~2.1 seconds, but I think it will be sub2 after I &#x27;master&#x27; <br>
it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I&#x27;m sorry for such the long post regarding just a single LL <br>
case, but I was so excited to find it I couldn&#x27;t help myself.<br>

          <div class="email-content">hehe nice

i use something similiar except i hold it in a
different way.

visit www.planet-puzzle.com and go to the PLL
evolution page. and do the n7:

(r&#x27;) R U&#x27;R&#x27;D - R U R&#x27;U&#x27;w U&#x27;w - R&#x27;U R D - R&#x27;U&#x27;R


my best time for it was 1.96 :P.

only problem is since you do a D turn you must be good
with your pinky or the finger b4 it


LATERZ!

Verify it (maybe see if doing it backwards solves it)<br>

That would be interesting. On videos I&#x27;ve seen some guys scramble 
quite fast using a scramble algorithm and I&#x27;ve been wondering how fast 
they are. You can easily verify using this page:

Yes I remember, I think you thought I was saying it so fast to 
intimidate you or wind you up, but it didn&#x27;t work ;) BUt I was 
actually finding the pairs that fast ;) I was imagining chasing 
Macky ;)

On the cross... I heard some guy has a fantastic cross page on his 
website, with examples and rules and everything. Maybe you could try 
that out :)

Nope, that would be 28 moves!

Is this the mix you use all the time?

Yeah, I think I&#x27;ve seen it and I like it a lot. If that guy could just 
add a cross trainer it would be perfect. With this I mean a webpage 
that lists scrambles with (let&#x27;s say) 10-15 moves and also lists how 
many moves are necessary to solve the cross. So I can print them and 
then practice solving cross in shortest ways. I&#x27;ll suggest it to him 
next time we talk...

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Per brought this up in the chat one time and I tried timing myself.  
My normal scrambling pace seems to take me about 8 seconds on 
average, 7 if it is an easy algorithm.

If we do start this category I&#x27;d like to try it.  I wonder if we get 
15 seconds to examine the algorithm and try to plan out how we will 
execute it? :)

P.S.  No I really am serious about the inspection time ;-)

16/21.  I feel like the remaining 5 cases will be
nearly impossible to bring to sub2 seconds.  

I&#x27;ve decided to focus more on improving my OLL now. 
Is it reasonable to shoot for having most orientations
under 1.5 seconds?  I&#x27;m not sure where orientations
should be on average.

          <div class="email-content">Francois made excellent points here.  At best learning
OLL improved my LL by 1.5 seconds.  The easiest way to
improve your times from this point is to focus on the
f2l.  And the amount of algs you have to learn to
improve on this is 0 anyway.  Work on minimizing cube
rotations, and solving your f2l fluidly without
stalls.

If Chris can do a 25 move scramble alg in 8 seconds then he should do 
a 20 move one in 6.4 seconds, so he&#x27;d beat Macky (assuming 15s) by a 
factor of 2.34 which means if you have a record average of 2.34*16.75s 
= 39.26s or better you should have a good chance to beat Macky this 
way.

Btw, I&#x27;d suggest to directly produce random scrambles with Cube 
Explorer instead. They&#x27;re not only a bit shorter but also actually 
more uniformly distributed.

Cheers!
Stefan

Nah, scrambling itself isn&#x27;t that interesting. It&#x27;s a dull boring 
annoying activity to scramble the cube, only solving is fun (note to 
the non-cubers out there: yes, I know for you it&#x27;s the other way 
around). So I&#x27;m only interested in how to spend less time for 
scrambling and then why would I add any time for &quot;inspection&quot;? If 
scrambling were an interesting activity itself than I&#x27;d agree with 
inspection, but...

Cheers!

Ah, very good advice. My old method was a working corner method to 
solve the entire F2L, and i didn&#x27;t even think of doing that when I 
swtiched over to the pairs. That should definitely help.

          <div class="email-content">Well.. First of all, if there are still any cases (F2L, OLL or PLL) 
that you don&#x27;t like, then I suggest you should try to find other 
versions of those algoritms that you do like. (It took me quite some 
time to get to the point where I like all my LL algs). For almost 
each algorithms, there are alternatives.

I send some e-mails a couple of days ago to another speedcuber who 
also has about the same times as you... If you are interested, I can 
forward them to you... They might be usefull for you as well.. :).

Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Hmm.. I am not really sure if &#x27;practice will do&#x27;... :S

I think for LL, yes, practice will do after you have found 
algorithms that you like to execute... For F2L, I don&#x27;t think 
practicing with a timer and all will do. I think it&#x27;s very important 
to solve the cube without timing yourself, while actively thinking 
about the steps that you make, and try to find all the F2L shortcuts 
yourself.

Don&#x27;t forget to bring your cube bask to normal orientation and restore
your grip between 2 tries, you&#x27;ll have an even better idea of the cost
in speedcubing conditions.

          <div class="email-content">Sorry, but i just figured that he wasnt actually timing a single solve,
but multiple solves, and used the average. If you do 20 solves in a row,
the time you would save / loose depending on your timer mecanism would
not make a huge impact on the time.
 
I might be wrong on this point though.

Yeah.. The the question was, what kind of timer he uses. With these 
2sec algorithms, you can&#x27;t really compare unless you use the same 
timing method.

          <div class="email-content">I am in no position to be giving advice, which is not what I am here 
to do.  But I wanted to offer some first hand experience.  This idea 
that Joel suggested, about not timing yourself for a bit and just 
concentrating on going slowly and looking ahead during the F2L is 
sound.  I had read people offer the advice before, but it is 
difficult to comprehend when you are first starting.  You see other 
cubers flying through the F2L and feel you need to go as fast as you 
can to try and keep pace (which you won&#x27;t anyway).  

Since Joel was nice enough to offer me some good tips, I took him 
seriously and did exactly that for most of this week  didn&#x27;t time 
myself, and only concentrated on solving the F2L without stopping, 
no matter how slowly it felt I was going.  After only 3 days of 
doing that, I could feel I was finding the pieces better. So I did 
an average last night, and I already dropped nearly 2 seconds from 
my average.  Sub 30 here I come!

So listen to these guys, they know their stuff.  (And thanks again!!)

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,

There are a few ways I&#x27;ve tried timing my algs.  I
guess the most common way, is probably similar to what
Terje is describing.  Starting from a computer timer,
repeating the alg 5-10 times, and just find my average
from there. 

I hope to get a webcam soon for recording videos, and
I can be completely accurate in knowing my times.

exicuting your algorithms quickly, then you should learn x-cross and
COLL, and if you still want to get better you might want to learn zb.

Well, I think if you do it that way, it&#x27;s probably pretty 
accurate :).

And Tyson, good point about the ice cream :D.

And Dave, congratz with breaking 30 seconds!

3;1445 isn&#x27;t optimal either - that one&#x27;s optimal in 19 moves too.

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

Just a little remark. U cannot refer to one of the cases for OLL/PLL 
as an _algorithm_. An algorithm is how u do something, not what is 
to be done. A case is like a task. So another version of an 
algorithm doesn&#x27;t make sense. Or it might possible mean u find 
another way to perform it. Likewise u can&#x27;t say another sequence for 
an algorithm, cause then it&#x27;s a different algorithm!! Sequence and 
algorithm is the same. At least when it comes to talking bout cube 
cases.

So what u should have said was to find an algorithm/sequence and a 
way to perform it that suits u for _each_ of the cases in OLL/PLL ...

Well this is how i understand it anyway. If im wrong please let me 
know :D Most ppl will still understand what is meant. But some might 
get confused when the terminology is not used consistently ;-)

Cheers!

Well, I feel ridiculous now.  I just counted a few tries... if you 
count turning a face twice (half way around) and turning opposite 
faces simultaneously as TWO moves, not one, (for example (LR&#x27;) is two 
moves and so is (F2)), it&#x27;s about 115 moves.  I guess I need to find 
some shortcuts...

          <div class="email-content">Actually, I solve with the Roux method, and it uses lots of slice turns, and seeing as half turns are generally accepted as single moves outside of the fewest moves community (in which there is a roaring debate about this as we type), I think it&#x27;s safe to measure those with Slice Turn Metric.  The moves you described are both counted as single moves in this metric.  Using quarter turn metric, most of even the top solvers would count more than 60 or even 65 moves, in my estimatation.  That would still most likely leave you with a number around 100 or so, which is all well and good for a beginner, especially homemade solution, but you should still look for ways to optimize it, even if it&#x27;s only a few moves here and there.  Try to minimize moves that cancel eachother out when possible, like the ends of certain algorithms when you realize you&#x27;ll have to turn around and undo them at the beginning of the next.  Anywho, would you care to describe your method?  You&#x27;ve piqued my late night curiosity. =)

          <div class="email-content">I highly recommend not necessarily learning a bunch of algorithms for the first two layers, but at least looking at sites that explain it.  The more you understand how and why the pieces you&#x27;re moving around behave like they do, the easier you can see how to move them around the way you want to.  First two layers is key for decreasing your times.

Using a very beginner last layer method with fewer algorithms to learn than yours, I&#x27;ve managed times in the low and mid 20&#x27;s.  That method involved a sequence and its inverse to flip edges, one to swap two corners sometimes done twice, one and its reflection to to orient corners in also sometimes done twice, and another and its inverse to rotate three edges.

The approach you&#x27;re taking is closer to a 4 look CLL+ELL (Corners last layer+Edges last layer).  There are fewer distinct cases to learn than OLL+PLL, and it&#x27;s easier to recognize, in my opinion.  Anyway, good luck with your method and remember to slow down and concentrate on your first two layers and minimizing delays.  As always, happy cubing.

          <div class="email-content">The number of looks refers to the number of steps you use to solve the last layer.  3 looks=3 steps.  They&#x27;re called looks because generally, you&#x27;re solving with a memorized sequence, so you&#x27;re recognizing a case and performing an algorithm.  While you&#x27;re performing it, you should be looking ahead to the the state your cube will be in so as to minimize delays.
When you orient pieces, that means they&#x27;re flipped to face the direction they&#x27;re supposed to face, though they&#x27;re not necessarily in the correct spots.
When you permute them, you&#x27;re moving the pieces to their correct places, or at least to specific places you want them to go, and not necessarily conserving their orientation.
CLL+ELL stands for Corners Last Layer+Edges Last Layer in much the same way OLL+PLL represents Orient and Permute Last Layer.
CLL means you orient and permute the corners in one step (or two shorter steps).
ELL is the same, but with edges.
OLL is when you orient all of your last layer corners and edges at the same time.
PLL is where you permute them all.

          <div class="email-content">To give you an idea, though I am a self-proclaimed &quot;cheater&quot; :) you
should be able to do the first two layers in 35 moves or less on
average with *LOTS* of practice (the real pros use around 32 moves or
less on average).

Though many of us spent times learning lots of sequences, they can all
be discovered with intuition and time/practice.  A lot of people never
look up anything about the first two layers, and come up with the
optimal sequences.

I would say to not worry about your last layer technique just yet, but
to really practice decreasing the number of moves it takes you to
solve the first two layers.  This doesn&#x27;t mean time yourself, it means
to just sit down with a cube for 5 minutes or more and solve the first
two layers in as few moves as possible.  This helps you to see new things.

One of my main &quot;drills&quot; when I practice is to count the number of
moves it takes me to solve the cube, taking as much time as I feel
like taking.  I don&#x27;t do any &quot;fewest moves&quot; tricks, just my normal
system, but with any helpful tricks I see.

I personally regret being a &quot;cheater&quot; a little bit, so if you can keep
your non-cheater status and figure out first two layers stuff on your
own, that would be awesome!

One thing to realize though, last layer algorithms are to speed cubing
as opening lines are to chess.  You can try to discover them yourself,
but why reinvent the wheel when it would take you months to do so, and
you still may not find the optimal sequences?  Eventually you&#x27;ll reach
a point where you have to learn more last layer algorithms to speed
up.  Just realize that memorizing algs for the last layer is just a
necessity of speedcubing (unless you are an *incredible* prodigy IHMO).

          <div class="email-content">Alright folks, so I&#x27;ve lost all my speedcubes and given away a few <br>
4x4s and stuff.<br>
<br>
But lately I&#x27;ve been trying to amass a large fleet of cubes. I <br>
ordered over $150 worth of cubing materials and have finished <br>
preliminary evaluations.<br>
<br>
                          ***Items***<br>
Rubiks.com:<br>
Harry Potter Magic, two 25th Aniversary cubes, offical lube, offical <br>
sets of stickers, print-your-own-design stickers, White DIY, <br>
standard 4x4<br>
<br>
CubeSmith.com:<br>
8 sets of 3x3 stickers<br>
<br>
Skiffy.com:<br>
1000 cube-sized washers<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So last night I was sitting here tinkering with the Magic and 2 hrs <br>
flew by! The wires are holding up well, but one of my links seem to <br>
be noticably offset, perhaps someone here can help with that. It <br>
could be that I was doing a set of moves repeatedly and gradually <br>
moved the wires to an *unhappy place*.<br>
<br>
Long story short, the 25th Aniversary cubes are crap! I took out a <br>
mechanism and did some sanding, put on pieces from my mediocre cube <br>
(off-the-shelf Hasbro aged 9 months) (my best speedcube at the time <br>
sadly enough), and put on a set of the official stickers.<br>
<br>
Those stickers didn&#x27;t last... Why? They were the out-dated laminated <br>
crap that we always warn you about. Those would have held up for <br>
about 10 days in [my] normal cubing conditions. I took off the <br>
center caps to the mechnism to see that..., yup no screws, hurray! <br>
Bleh.... It was good for one thing... placing in my cube robot. Then <br>
I found out that the stickers were overly reflective for my RGB <br>
sensors and so replaced them with oversized, colored <br>
electrical/plastic tape.<br>
<br>
The offical cube lube worked beautifully on my robot&#x27;s cube. I am <br>
starting to really love this citrus smelling milky cube wax they <br>
offer. So that cube now happens to be donated (or indedefinate loan) <br>
to the computer engineering department after the conclusion of my <br>
project. (I will try to bring it back for some one credit <br>
independent study, 400-lvl control systems course, or just join an <br>
undergrad lab and get some office space to work on it in my spare <br>
time.)<br>
<br>
So then the remaining kernal was mated with the remaining pieces. So <br>
the twenty 25th Aniversary pieces on a half-worn-in Hasbro <br>
mechanism. That became my &quot;best&quot; speedcube for a few weeks, but I <br>
use the term &quot;best&quot; very loosely here.<br>
<br>
I am now finding the arched centers a terrible thing to have. (Not <br>
necessarily in general, but this case has already made up my mind it <br>
seems.)<br>
<br>
So I took out the other 25th Anniversary cube out of it&#x27;s shiny <br>
hexagonal-prism box since I was lacking cubes. I haven&#x27;t done <br>
anythig to it for the past 6 weeks I&#x27;ve had it. I feel it&#x27;s not <br>
worth saving. I don&#x27;t think there is much I can do for it and the <br>
amount of work I put into it will have severly deminishing returns.<br>
<br>
Ok so the main problem is that it came too loose, it&#x27;s lacking the <br>
desired springy-ness, the plastic seems to be harder, when you turn <br>
a face it sounds like something is dying in there. In this case <br>
lubing of any form didn&#x27;t help. In fact it made the slipping problem <br>
worst. It locks up as much as the disasterous Meffert&#x27;s Assembly, <br>
lol.<br>
<br>
So that&#x27;s just going to sit pretty on it&#x27;s lovely hexagonal base on <br>
top of my monitor for the time being. On to the exciting stuff.<br>
<br>
I followed StefanP.&#x27;s washer idea on &quot;twisty&quot;. You can find it here:<br>
http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3723&amp;highlight=washers<br>
I am still waiting for the order to arrive however. They are proving <br>
a cool little utility set. I mainly want it for the knife. Ordering <br>
from Europe would have been just $6.50 or so. But in the states, <br>
there is an extra $13 shippping fee which took me ages to decide on <br>
paying. More about the washers next week.<br>
<br>
I got a bunch of 3x3 stickers from Jello33/cubesmith. They arrived <br>
either yesterday or the day before, and I am very impressed with the <br>
service. It only took them like 2 days. I would like to place an <br>
order for other stuff like Eastsheen 2x2, 4x4, Oddzon 4x4, 5x5, 5x5 <br>
supercubing, and pyraminx... oh but wait, he doesn&#x27;t sell any non-<br>
sqaure stickers. Hem... and also the 5x5 superset are done in the <br>
standard color-scheme and not made to my liking. (I&#x27;m sure the <br>
stickers are quality, just that I use this bizzare color-scheme.)<br>
<br>
So to that, I hope taht in the future cubesmith.com will be a more <br>
central shopping hub for our community. Surely, I see it&#x27;s potential <br>
to be. It would be great if he can provide other types of stickers <br>
(megaminx?), injectable cube lube (I mean wax, since it&#x27;s the new <br>
hip thing to do now), and DIY kits... I would like it if we could <br>
rally enough support as a community and push for a bulk order of <br>
these DIY kits and sell them at discounted rates at cubesmith.com, <br>
where by discounted I mainly refer to the shipping costs that <br>
rubik.com is a bit hefty on for my budget. Jello33 is THE MAN!!!<br>
<br>
While I try to pick enough things to get my total over the $10 mark <br>
to avoid the extra shipping costs, lets talk about the DIY kits.<br>
<br>
I got the white one a few days ago along with a brand-spankin&#x27; 4x4. <br>
(To replace the 4x4 my frined took to Bombay as a graduation/parting <br>
gift.) Now my old one was never schemed to my liking, and was a bit <br>
on hte stiff side requiring obnoxiously frequent lubrication <br>
(silicone spray, I still recommend it a couple weeks AFTER an <br>
injection wax treatment, if you can afford it.)<br>
<br>
The one I have been using has this terrible purple side, you know <br>
what I&#x27;m talking about... the little Eastsheen one. It fits my hands <br>
beautifully (I have small girlish hands, as I found out when <br>
comparing to other cometitors at Toronto, and when I say other <br>
competitiors I am thining about that 7 year old Polish girl, lol)<br>
<br>
That one locks up and slips too much. There ARE a LOT of moving <br>
parts in there. (I think euqual or worst then the standard 5x5 the <br>
last time I counted.) I am afraid to re-scheme my Eastsheen <br>
cubes...., Ah! but wait we have cubesmith now.... rescued again :)!<br>
<br>
The Meffert&#x27;s 4x4 still lies broken in my room, been like that for <br>
over two years, cuz every time I fix a fragil center piece it breaks <br>
again in a week or two along with another center :(. Ya, I recommend <br>
against Meffert&#x27;s 4x4s (this doesn&#x27;t count the Eastsheen ones. You <br>
see, they are not manufactured to good control standards I believe, <br>
or at least wasn&#x27;t at the time of my purchese 4 years ago. Bubbles <br>
in the plactic underneth the stickers, tons of internal <br>
imperfections. Had to spend days to sand out properly. Though the <br>
kernal is dismantel-able unlike standard ones that are superglued in <br>
on top of the 9 screws.<br>
<br>
So THIS new 4x4 came 3 days after I placed my order! Very expedicant <br>
service, I&#x27;m quite pleased. I applied the usual techniques I do for <br>
4x4&#x27;s, then an injection of wax, then a reschemeing. Referencing <br>
Stefan&#x27;s page on how to minimally rescheme a 4x4, I found that none <br>
of those algorithms applied directly to my situation, my color-<br>
scheme is the devil..., it&#x27;s as far away from standard as possible. <br>
It requies some 4-cycle of sticker faces. I managed to do it in 14 <br>
moves though! This required one twist of a corner piece which may be <br>
considered &quot;cheating&quot; to some purists.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, all that took up no more then a half hour and my cube was <br>
PERFECT! I would say a bit on the loose side though, and that&#x27;s in <br>
accordance with MY style... I have a very loose/shifty/rapid <br>
movement style. It&#x27;s borderline to the point where I perform starts <br>
AND *stops* of my turns. So the final note, I have a marvolously <br>
loose 4x4 sppedcube. It came that way, better then if it was too <br>
tight. but I&#x27;ll eventually have to figure out how to tighten one of <br>
those things.<br>
<br>
Best of all is the White DIY 3x3 kit I recidved in the same shipment <br>
as the 4x4. Put it together in about 2-3 hours. I was going to hold <br>
out for the washers but, it&#x27;s doing pretty well without it for the <br>
time being. WHITE, dang that looks freaky! Ihave very high standards <br>
when it comes to preparing a cube and some say that I have been <br>
quite spoiled with the quality of my speedcubes. (Those who have <br>
tested them at competitions.) Yet I lost them all on the bus over <br>
the past year, *sigh*. WHY, OH LORD WHY HAVE THEY FORSAKEN ME, lol.<br>
<br>
But the white one is fantastic. Only took about 3rhs to produce a <br>
magnificent speedcube! It surpassed my standards. No real need to <br>
wear it in. I&#x27;m going to have to tighten it further though after I <br>
use it&#x27;s loose state to practice my &quot;accuracy&quot; as Tyson, Macky, and <br>
others have advocated.<br>
<br>
I think I&#x27;m going to order a FLEET (a word I adapted from JonM) of <br>
these. Get a dozen identical speedcubes suited up for Sunday <br>
contests and stuff would be great.<br>
<br>
So this was the story of how a cuber in speedcubing-proverty, is <br>
rising to speedcube-wealth. More to come I hope; catch you on the <br>
flip side!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug,<br>
<br>
nice extensive review, thanks :-) Some comments...<br>
<br>
&gt; So last night I was sitting here tinkering with the Magic and 2 hrs <br>
&gt; flew by! The wires are holding up well, but one of my links seem to <br>
&gt; be noticably offset, perhaps someone here can help with that.<br>
<br>
I have a few of these, too, and I can tell you they come this way. I&#x27;m <br>
not at all happy with them in mint condition. I got them in order to <br>
build new magics, e.g. a master magic. So I take out the strings, cut <br>
holes in the sides of the paper where they should be, and insert the <br>
strings again, but differently. A bit hard to explain, though, and if <br>
you only have one it&#x27;s maybe a bit risky...<br>
&gt; Ok so the main problem is that it came too loose, it&#x27;s lacking the <br>
&gt; desired springy-ness, the plastic seems to be harder, when you turn <br>
&gt; a face it sounds like something is dying in there. In this case <br>
&gt; lubing of any form didn&#x27;t help. In fact it made the slipping problem <br>
&gt; worst. It locks up as much as the disasterous Meffert&#x27;s Assembly, <br>
&gt; lol.<br>
<br>
When it&#x27;s too loose you might be able to fix it even though they have <br>
rivets instead of screws. They&#x27;re pretty much impossible to pull out <br>
but you might be able to push them in deeper. Have a closeup look at a <br>
rivet (that I got with a black DIY, I assume this is what&#x27;s in your <br>
cube, too):<br>
http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/diy_rivet.jpg<br>
<br>
&gt; I followed StefanP.&#x27;s washer idea on &quot;twisty&quot;. You can find it here:<br>
&gt; http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?<br>
t=3723&amp;highlight=washers<br>
&gt; I am still waiting for the order to arrive however. They are proving <br>
&gt; a cool little utility set. I mainly want it for the knife. Ordering <br>
&gt; from Europe would have been just $6.50 or so. But in the states, <br>
&gt; there is an extra $13 shippping fee which took me ages to decide on <br>
&gt; paying. More about the washers next week.<br>
<br>
Uh, I do hope you&#x27;ll get the tool. I didn&#x27;t know this and I was <br>
surprised when I got it. They say it&#x27;s a welcome present for ordering <br>
online, apparently sort of an appetizer also mentioned in the printed <br>
catalog (which I don&#x27;t have). I don&#x27;t like the knife that much, I was <br>
mainly interested in the washers, so for me it was just a nice extra.<br>
<br>
&gt; I got a bunch of 3x3 stickers from Jello33/cubesmith. They arrived <br>
&gt; either yesterday or the day before, and I am very impressed with the <br>
&gt; service. It only took them like 2 days. I would like to place an <br>
&gt; order for other stuff like Eastsheen 2x2, 4x4, Oddzon 4x4, 5x5, 5x5 <br>
&gt; supercubing, and pyraminx... oh but wait, he doesn&#x27;t sell any non-<br>
&gt; sqaure stickers.<br>
<br>
Not true, look at the square-1 stickers :-) He&#x27;ll probably have <br>
Megaminx stickers very soon, too. I&#x27;ve never seen a Pyraminx with bad <br>
stickers so I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;d make sense ;-)<br>
<br>
&gt; It requies some 4-cycle of sticker faces. I managed to do it in 14 <br>
&gt; moves though!<br>
<br>
Can you tell those 14 moves? Even though the resulting scheme might <br>
not be interesting for anyone but you (;-) such a short algorithm <br>
sounds nice. How many stickers did you need to peel off?<br>
<br>
&gt; Best of all is the White DIY 3x3 kit I recidved in the same shipment <br>
&gt; as the 4x4. Put it together in about 2-3 hours. I was going to hold <br>
&gt; out for the washers but, it&#x27;s doing pretty well without it for the <br>
&gt; time being.<br>
<br>
Yes, washers won&#x27;t make a big difference here. The screw head is large <br>
enough to be the limit for how far you can pull out the center, so the <br>
spring is not almost fully compressed like with smaller screw heads. <br>
This and the somewhat ground spring ends prevent major scratching. I&#x27;d <br>
however suggest to try adding washers *outside* of the centers, <br>
between center and the kernel spider. This should stabilize the <br>
centers which I think is good, it might work against pops.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Oh what I meant was 14 sticker moves... the actual number of turns 
was probably quite large since I was brute forcing it bit by bit.

My scheme is: U=white, F=blue, R=red, L=yellow, B=orange, and 
D=green.

To get it there I only needed to cycle 3 &quot;pairs&quot; of edge stickers 
and move around 8 corner stickers..., one on each conrer.

I like your washer idea.

          <div class="email-content">welcome to the group

I used to use a method that sounds very similar to what you 
describe, also self-taught over months of trial and error practice 
one summer before 7th grade when the cube first exploded on the 
scene--long before you could just look up these algs on the 
internet.  I used that method until just the past few months when I 
started to learn Fridrich.  I definitely see value in trying to 
figure it out on your own, but if you&#x27;re serious about getting 
really fast, you&#x27;ll almost certainly have to learn some algs that 
are already out there everywhere on the Net.

my times with that old method were just over a minute, with an 
occasional sub 60.  Just since March, my average has dropped to 47 
seconds, and I very rarely have a solve over 60 [only when I get a 
brain cramp].  And my times are slowly but steadily dropping 
literally every week as I add new algs and get faster on the others.

I definitely still need a lot more work on the F2L, though.  agree 
that that&#x27;s a huge part of getting faster times.  

good luck!
Kirk

Hi Mark,

I just take the easy way out and use &quot;Motomaster Silicone Spray&quot;.  
It is easy to find in the automotive section of any Canadian Tire 
I&#x27;ve been to in either Ontario or Manitoba - presumably available 
from coast to coast.  It comes in an aerosol can with an 
orange/reddish lid (they have several different types of lubes in 
the same section so do be careful which one you pick up).  It is 
cheap and easy to find.  It seems to work quite well on my cubes but 
since it is the only brand I have ever used I cannot rate its 
performance against other brands.  I usually take my cubes apart, 
spray the silicone on all the cubies, and wait for the pieces to dry 
before reassembling.  If I do this the cube is ready to go as soon 
as it is reassembled.

Rob

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

I was stupid enough to bring 2 cans of silicone spray to the 2nd GCD 
in Gütersloh. The stupid thing is that i brought it in my rucksack 
thinking it was much safer there than in my suitcase. Had it been 
there it would have been fine. But after a security scan of my 
rucksack they confiscated both cans (this was on my way out), and 
there was no way i could get them back later. One can did indeed say 
flammable on it, and the other even said _highly flammable_. So even 
if it should not really be flammable it will say so on the can, and 
may cause u trouble trying to transport in onboard aircrafts, at 
least as part of ur hand luggage ... *ugh*

Luckily silicone spray is cheap ;-) There are actually some types of 
silicone sprays that are no legal here in Norway anymore, due to 
toxicity probably. Amongst others the black 3M spray is impossible 
to get hold of here. Same with Chestertone. And since it seems kinda 
impossible to get spray from one country to another in any legal way 
it&#x27;s tough luck if u live in a restrictive country. Cubing was 
easier back in early 80&#x27;s ;-)

Slick cubing!

Man, it took me forever to accomplish this. Centers were of course 
trivial, edges were easy but centers were quite hard. Now I also have 
6 edge and 8 corner stickers wrong if I rotate a corner. How did you 
get it? Some sort of strategy or more or less random guessing? The 
latter was my master plan ;-)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Well I just had to think about it... I know that the centers are 
free to move around due to the availiblity of a 3 center piece cycle 
algorithm I know, and since you can cycle say (XXY) it will look 
like a two cycle. Thus no center stickers need to be chnaged. I 
noticed that there are only 3 edge-pairs that will not exist in the 
new scheme so that means that 6 edge stickers need to be moved. I 
know that none of the corners can be preserved since none of them 
exist on the new scheme. I checked each corner and noticed that 
there are two stickers that can belong to the new corners and 
thought that a minimal 8 might be possible.

Then it took some guess work to see which corner should go where, 
with the knowledge that you can have two-corner cycles on the 4x4 
without effecting other pieces.

I quickly reduced the problem down to that of a 2x2, and since I 
already knew from experience that 8 is minimal on a 2x2, I knew 
everything would work out.

Now to generate an optimal sequence for this.... what programs do 
this?

3;1445 isn&#x27;t optimal either - that one&#x27;s optimal in 19 moves too.

I suppose thet Jess Bonde&#x27;s timer will work on a Mac, or whichever

A good question.  It might be the number of a particular case in one of 
his blindfold-solving systems, see
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/9589

On the other hand, it might be something else. ;)

I really wish that in these irregular posts Richard would link to a web 
page (or even an earlier posting here) informing us (or reminding us) 
of what he is doing.  No doubt it is very interesting -- a single case 
he mentioned a while back was intriguing because of its symmetry and 
depth.

This is an element of the orientation subgroup.
3 denotes the edges to be flipped, in this case UF &amp; UB,
1346 denotes the corners to be twisted convert to base 3 (21211212, of length 7 plus a 
filler (0, 1 or 2) to make the sum of the digits congruent to 0 mod 3) and this represents 
the number of twists each corner needs to be correctly oriented.

Thanks for the kind words.  I&#x27;m looking into the posibility of <br>
selling more cubes and puzzles on my site.  I&#x27;m not sure if I can <br>
get the DIY kits at wholsale though because rubiks.com wants a <br>
minimum of 100 piece order to even consider bulk pricing. <br>
<br>
I also would need to make sure it&#x27;s feasable on the shipping side.  <br>
Quite a lot of my orders are to overseas, and I can&#x27;t put a $1 stamp <br>
on a Supercube. :) <br>
<br>
Keep checking my site as I&#x27;m also putting up more sticker sets this <br>

I&#x27;m working on having as much stuff as possible on my site so if <br>

These refer back to posts somewhere around numbers 16040-16080.
Since it&#x27;s now ply possible to search a few messages at a time I don&#x27;t want to look for 
earlier similar posts. The particular topic here (or rather subtopic) is optimising of the 
orientation subgroup (fix the positions of the pieces but orient them). There are 94,518 
inequivalent such positions. They can all be done in 20 moves (half turn metric) or less. At 
least 11 of these require 20 moves. Initially I&#x27;m trying to cut down the number of 20s. In 
those posts I listed some candidate positions (that CubeExplorer was taking a long time 
over. Two or 3 of those I subsequently found were optimal in 19 - hence the follow-ups. 
Still lots more candidates. In those earlier messages I think I had just uner 2400 to go. 
Now that figure is well under 1500.

Thanks for telling us about you cans being confiscated. I don&#x27;t want
to lose my lubricant if I fly to the Worlds in November. Perhaps the
sponsors could have a &quot;Cube Service Station&quot; where people could clean
and lube their cubes, sand their springs, swap springs and washers, etc. 

Have you looked into ordering the black 3M non-oil-based, non-toxic
spray online, and having it shipped to you? I use it, having found it
at an auto parts store.

In the 80&#x27;s I never used lube. I once tried graphite, which works very
well except that it doesn&#x27;t stay in the cube! :P 

Thanks,

David J

   I think that by not solving it for themselves the first time they
they miss out on a major opportunity to prove something to themselves.

   I place two middle edges, four bottom corners, the other two middle
edges then the four bottom edges. 

   I average between 36 and 54 moves to solve the cube, using about 30
moves to solve the first 2 levels.

I work on the top level next. I call those switching &quot;two corners
adjacent&quot; and switching &quot;two corners across.&quot;

There are no orientations which require the famous seven move sequence
applied more than twice.

If I break the last level into four pieces I move the corners into
place, reorient them, then reorient the edges and move the edges into
place.

I only use my own algorithms. Since I started cubing I try to do as
much as possible at one go. I often solve the corners and flip over
two edges at the same time. It does take time to find all 1211 last
level algs, but I&#x27;m slowly getting there. I almost have a complete set
of CLL and ELL. 

Congratulations on solving it on your own.

Thanks!  E.g. post 16069.  I guess you don&#x27;t have a progress page...

I do understand the problem of searching back through the earlier 
posts; the thing is, though, that if /you/ don&#x27;t do it, every 
potentially interested reader will have to do this painful searching 
himself.  Or, more likely, will give up after five minutes.

Much better if you just kept a record of the key post numbers yourself 
(for terminology, notation, last report, etc.) and included the most 
relevant post numbers when you next report on the project.

All the best,
Mike

<br>
I ordered some stickers and tiles off of your site a couple of days <br>

<br>
I don&#x27;t know how hard it would be on your end, but how about a supercube <br>
sticker set for 3x3x3 and 4x4x4?  Also, will your megaminx sticker sets <br>
be 6 or 12 color?  Is there any (far-fetched) possibility of you <br>
offering sticker sets for lesser-known/custom puzzles like <br>
half-truncated or truncated 3x3x3&#x27;s?<br>

&gt;Thanks for the kind words.  I&#x27;m looking into the posibility of <br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;I also would need to make sure it&#x27;s feasable on the shipping side.  <br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;Keep checking my site as I&#x27;m also putting up more sticker sets this <br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;I&#x27;m working on having as much stuff as possible on my site so if <br>

For me it depends on the environment, particularly of course the move 
right before and the move right after the slice turn. For example, I&#x27;d 
do (r (R&#x27; U))*4. It&#x27;s two movements, but the R&#x27; combines nicely with 
the U. On the other hand, I pull the middle slice with my left ring 
finger when I do this OLL (yes I know that&#x27;s actually more like an 
antislice): (M&#x27; R&#x27;) U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R U&#x27; R r&#x27;. Ha! I do the slice move 
at the end as two moves :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Mmh, does that mean you&#x27;ve already asked them? Did they tell you a 
price?

Actually, a single DIY kit consists of 51 pieces even if you don&#x27;t 
count stickers and lube ;-)

          <div class="email-content">I had asked for a bulk order on the regular one a year or two ago 
and do know that 100 is their minimum and that they will take a 
dollar off or so...

For DIY kits, that would be only about $650, and you&#x27;d make the 
money right back after a couple months of sales. Perhaps this way 
you make a slight profit and we buy for the same price but have an 
added convenicne of ordering cheaper and (IMHO) better stickers, 
thus driving down shipping time and costs.

Offering washers too would be nice... a perfect addition to DIY 
kits... as would Rubik&#x27;s Magic wires. Eh, I don&#x27;t know poll ppl on 
this forum to see what they would order, I&#x27;m not a typical consumer, 
I buy just aobut anything cube related.

My opinion is that it&#x27;s easier without the _applicator sheet_ which 
probably is the word u are looking for :-) If u are unlucky with the 
sheet u end up with the stickers not being straight on the cubies 
and it can be hard to reposition the whole sheet :-o. Not being 
straight u wera out the stickers with ur fingers much much faster. 
So i find i have more control doing one sticker at a time. But it 
sure takes a while on the 5x5x5 :-( In the end it&#x27;s worth it.

Who would even want that? It&#x27;s never gonna be perfectly perfect and it 
doesn&#x27;t take that much time to apply the stickers separately. At least 
not compared to the several hours it takes me anyway to prepare a 
speedcube ;-)

I was just thinking if there is a good substitute for this so-called
applicator sheet that you can optionally use, not neccesarily supplied
by CubeSmith. But I think most sticky material is too sticky and won&#x27;t
let the stickers go easily once applied to the cube.

Removing old stickers is in some cases (eastsheen for example) more
work than putting new ones on, so it&#x27;s a time-consuming thing to do
anyway.

The black DIYs actually do have washers. Only the white doesn&#x27;t. 
Unless they changed it recently.

I did get some a while ago in little bags that they also used for the 
DIY Magic, but that one has disappeared. You could still ask of 
course. And if not, just get a Potter or Simpson magic and disassemble 
it :-)

That sounds great, &quot;Silicone Dry&quot;. I have found two sprays here in 
Germany that are pretty &quot;dry&quot; and I like them a lot. I wish I had 
bought some Jig-A-Loo when I was in Canada. Well, maybe I wouldn&#x27;t

silicone spray to Euro2004 and back without problems.

          <div class="email-content">Hi All,

I just thought that I&#x27;d mention that this confusion happens, and will
keep happening until the community unifies notation. :P

Hi Bram,

I use Q followed by F, L, U, B, R, or D to indicate rotating the whole
cube. Q stands for &quot;cube&quot; so QR means that you rotate the whole cube
clockwise like you would rotate the Right side clockwise

When the 3x3x3 appeared David Singmaster used F, L, U, B, R, or D to
indicate sides of the cube. I think he use ME and S to mean slices.
When the 4x4x4 appeared he used the lower case letters f, l, u, b, r,
d to mean slices. Some immediately extended this to the 3x3x3, since
the meaning of M E and S: Middle, Equator, and Slice do not just fall
into place and have to be memorized.

Unfortunately most of the first people online did not use a lot of
slices. They have since coopted the lower case to mean a slice and a
side on the 3x3x3 for &quot;finger tricks,&quot; and screwed up very clean
notation. They also refuse to go back to the original usage. 

Oh well.

Then there are the map maker&#x27;s coordinates x, y, and z. I&#x27;ve yet to
see a math class that didn&#x27;t have someone get confused about axes.
Because of that confusion, and since people use x, y, and z
differently, Chris Hardwick recently suggested replacing them. I
suggested Q for cube, but while people were interested, they didn&#x27;t
have websites. 

I guess a single set of letters for turns, slices, and cube rotations
is too simple for people addicted to memorization. (That&#x27;s a joke,
people!)

Regards,

David J

Classically, z would be upwards - but I guess that doesn&#x27;t seem to 
be the case in cubing...

In any case, if z is upwards, y should be away from you but if y is 
upward z should be towards you (in both cases assuming x is to the 
right) - at least assuming you want a right-handed orthonormal triad 
of unit vectors. : )

Well, well...
I hate cube rotation noted with x,y,z because I can&#x27;t keep track of 
where which axis is pointing. I tried to be helpful but now I think I 
caused more confusion that anything else =D

Until cube rotation notation is standardized I will just keep my cube 
orientated the same throughout my solve!

Happy rotationless cubing everyone ;)

Onderwerp: [Speed cubing group] Re: Question about algoritms


Hi All,

I just thought that I&#x27;d mention that this confusion happens, and will
keep happening until the community unifies notation. :P

Hi Bram,

I use Q followed by F, L, U, B, R, or D to indicate rotating the whole
cube. Q stands for &quot;cube&quot; so QR means that you rotate the whole cube
clockwise like you would rotate the Right side clockwise

When the 3x3x3 appeared David Singmaster used F, L, U, B, R, or D to
indicate sides of the cube. I think he use ME and S to mean slices.
When the 4x4x4 appeared he used the lower case letters f, l, u, b, r,
d to mean slices. Some immediately extended this to the 3x3x3, since
the meaning of M E and S: Middle, Equator, and Slice do not just fall
into place and have to be memorized.

Unfortunately most of the first people online did not use a lot of
slices. They have since coopted the lower case to mean a slice and a
side on the 3x3x3 for &quot;finger tricks,&quot; and screwed up very clean
notation. They also refuse to go back to the original usage. 

Oh well.

Then there are the map maker&#x27;s coordinates x, y, and z. I&#x27;ve yet to
see a math class that didn&#x27;t have someone get confused about axes.
Because of that confusion, and since people use x, y, and z
differently, Chris Hardwick recently suggested replacing them. I
suggested Q for cube, but while people were interested, they didn&#x27;t
have websites. 

I guess a single set of letters for turns, slices, and cube rotations
is too simple for people addicted to memorization. (That&#x27;s a joke,
people!)

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

This discussion will keep recurring cause it&#x27;s extremely bad 
notation. Easy as that. There is no consensus on what x,y,z is. 
Whether z is upwards or facing towards u and so on. The only thing 
that is clear is that when using x,y,z in algorithmic notation it 
means rotation about those respective axes. Again in which direction 
could cause confusion. So why not replace those with notation based 
on FRBLUD which we all agree on and doesn&#x27;t cause any confusion? Let 
Rc = x, R&#x27;c = x&#x27; R2c= x2 and so on. This also extends to other 
puzzles where each face has well defined names, like the megaminx. 
Most common way is to use A,B,C,D,E,F,a,b,c,d,e,f i guess. Physical 
movement of the megaminx can easily be defined from those facenames. 
Adding brackets to avoid confusion. So we could have c(c)3 etc 
etc ... How could x,y,z ever extend to megaminx? :-P

Cheers!

I agree wholeheartedly. But, sadly, this battle has been lost... we 
cannot expect so many people to change their notation now. :(  And, in 
the end, it /is/ just notation.

Well, you could add the degrees, e.g. y72 for a fifth turn of the top 
face and everything below. Rotations for other faces could be written 
as a combination of x, y and z, for example z57 x313. Not sure these 
numbers would work. I think it would be easiest to have a sequence of 
rotations for each face that make this face the top face. Then to 
rotate the puzzle around any face, bring that face to top, rotate it 
with a clean multiple of y72, then bring it back where it came from. 
That all said, who cares about megaminx anyway?

Cheers!
Stefan

Hi Dan,

that&#x27;s really cool, thanks a lot! (Too tired to continue the game 
after training the cross so much ;-)

I guess you found the optimal lengths and number of solutions with 
computer help (which program?), so maybe most of the other solutions 
are somewhat more &quot;magical&quot;. Below I list solutions and comments found 
by another human (me).

Can you give numbers to the cases so it&#x27;s easier to talk about them? 
I&#x27;ve simply numbered them from 1-15. On the webpage, it would be good 
to hide the optimal lengths. When I practice this, I&#x27;d like to know 
afterwards whether there&#x27;s something better, not necessarily 
beforehand.

Thanks for all the work. So far it&#x27;s different than what I had in 
mind, but I like it a lot as well. What I had in mind is a program 
that generates random scrambles, maybe by solving two random cubes and 
concatenating their solutions to build the scramble. That would result 
in good scrambles with about 13 moves. I wouldn&#x27;t have (your) human 
solutions so I wouldn&#x27;t expect to learn as easily from it, but it 
would give me the opportunity to practice as often as I want to with 
new scrambles all the time.

I must admit sometimes I exceeded the 15 seconds a bit and often I 
didn&#x27;t have a clear vision of the solution, so I had to follow the 
pieces closely, think and turn slowly. That&#x27;s part of why I&#x27;m not yet 
able to look ahead for the first F2L pair. I&#x27;d like to practice cross 
more often and then execute with closed eyes to force myself to see 
the solution clearly. Since you never have cube rotations I guess that 
can&#x27;t be the way you execute your solutions. Can you show us how you 
execute them?

1) R D&#x27; B D&#x27; L F D
Yippie, I beat you in QTM ;-)

2) D&#x27; F2 D2 R D F&#x27;
Darn...

3) Same as yours.

4) Same as yours, though I rotated the cube with y first.

5) Same as yours.

6) x U L U&#x27; l U y&#x27; L2 D&#x27;
Slightly different in the end. I save a quarter turn but pay with a 
cube rotation (or alternatively a B turn). Here&#x27;s one I like, too, 
it&#x27;s a bit longer but easier to execute (it&#x27;s more similar to yours): 
x U L U&#x27; l D&#x27; U2 R2

7) L&#x27; F D B&#x27; L R&#x27; D
I like yours a lot, too. Your B&#x27; start is a bit counter-intuitive 
since you turn the &quot;correctly flipped&quot; white/green edge into an 
incorrect one. I need to learn not to always see that as something 
bad.

8) F&#x27; B2 U R2 D&#x27; L
I think I actually did (y&#x27; R&#x27; L2 D L2 D2 F) which is slightly 
different, not only because of the cube rotation.

9) Same as yours, though I started with y.

10) y&#x27; D2 L&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27;
+1 in HTM but same in QTM, and only &lt;L,D,R> after initial rotation, so 
I&#x27;m not too unhappy ;-)

11) R B E&#x27; L F&#x27;

Ha! Shorter than optimal ;-)

12) y2 D&#x27; R2 U F&#x27; D L2
Another one, quite similar to yours but with an inserted U to save the 
white/green early on: D&#x27; L2 U B&#x27; D R2. One less B&#x27; turn.

13) y&#x27; U2 L&#x27; D&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27;
Yeah yeah, I beat you in QTM ;-) But it took me a long time to 
actually execute it because my vision of the alg was all but clear, 
probably not only because of the overall length but because I turn all 
six sides :-)

14) I screwed this one and in the second attempt did 8 moves but had 
to do it slowly. Sigh... This is a hard one. Though your solution 
makes it look so easy, especially after your first three moves. I 
think my problem was that the white/orange edge was almost solved and 
I didn&#x27;t think about moving it away. I had tried U B L&#x27; U&#x27; F2 R2. 
Unfortunately the white/green wasn&#x27;t at UR before the R2. Something 
like this still happens to me too often.

15) Same as yours, but with a different order in the middle where we 
solve each piece individually: F&#x27; R&#x27; L B L2. You seem to switch 
between right and left areas of action.

That&#x27;s all for now... thanks again!

Cheers!
Stefan

   I have created a folder in &quot;Files&quot; for notation schemes. Everyone<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dan,
Suppose, there exists an optimal five mover for the cross. During the inspection time you get sight of  a six mover, which you can execute more or less blindly. Would you still, whith a reasonable probability, find that five mover? (That is, in practical game).

          <div class="email-content">Hey Rune,

If in the inspection time, I would see a 6-move cross, which was easy 
to execute, I would definitely stick with it. I would then use the 
rest of the inspection time to try and imagine where my first F2L 
pair would be, that way right after the cross I could go seamlessly 
straight into the F2L.

Of course, I wouldn&#x27;t know that the 5-mover existed if I didn&#x27;t 
search for it and see it, so I wouldn&#x27;t really have to make a 
decision &quot;between the two&quot;.

Just finished learning OLL. Being able to always solve the LL in two
looks feels great :-) Never thought I would be able to learn this
method after seeing it for the first time 23 years ago. It took me
almost a year. F2L is done intuitively, started doing this at the
European Championships afterparty. Now most of the times I solve the
cube within 60 moves. Next step is to drop my average time under 30
seconds.

          <div class="email-content">do this. 
do a F then a 3-cycle to see some COLL.

or a B then a 3 cycle.

 also try doing a F, then do the T permutation, you
will see a nice alg from the 1211 rose palmers.

practice that way, you will be able to see certain
situations were you can do either a F, B, B&#x27; or F&#x27; and
a certain permutation to fix oritentation and
permutation at once.

good luck!

Very nice Richard!

I really liked your story, especially your false identity ;) It all 
very much brings back my thoughts when I started cubing. I think most 
speedcubers find similarities with their own experiences.
I&#x27;ve come a little further in my journey than you Sachin. I&#x27;m sure you 
will hit sub-30 but, it can take time. I had already lost hope for 
keeping my average that low (my PB was 29.37 seconds done in February) 
but only a week ago I took a quantum leap forward, now my PB is 26.62 
and I again dream of sub-20 averages :)

Happy cubing,
Mikael

          <div class="email-content">I received an email from a cuber who&#x27;d used my beginner solution to
learn the basics and who is now interested in learning a 3-look LL.

I thought Dan Knights&#x27; advanced solution
&lt;http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/Advanced.html> was very
good for learning the 3-look LL, but Dan K&#x27;s site has been down for
quite a while now. Can anyone recommend another good 3-look LL site?
If I had more time then I&#x27;d create one myself, but unfortunately I
don&#x27;t have time at the moment. I&#x27;m hoping that someone can point me in
the direction of an existing 3-look LL site. :)

          <div class="email-content">hey,

For a three look last layer, you can use any set of LL algorythms.
Just use only the ones you need for orientation, and all of them for
permutation.  So I would recomend looking around at alot of different
algorithm sites to find which ones fit best, as opposed to just
learning them from a single site (my mistake).

Hope that helps

 G&#x27;day Jasmine,

I&#x27;ve got the Dan Knights Simple Solution video, (which is available at 
rubiks.com)it comes with a cheat sheet and has his beginner, advanced, 
and expert solutions on it. If ya like I could take some pics of it 
and email em to ya.

With respect to those posts

F2 U2 R2 D2 L U2 L F2 U2 R&#x27; D&#x27; B R&#x27; F&#x27; R B L&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U (20f) //90;1187

is indeed optimal. (1 out of 4 so far - one still to go from that post - not great, but at least 
one of them was a 20.)

          <div class="email-content"><br>
Tchus Stefan!<br>
<br>
Tonight I finally joined you in solving a 5x5x5 supercube <br>
blindfolded!<br>
<br>
It was not by any means my first attempt at this type of solve as I <br>
have had a few really heartbreaking near misses in the past couple <br>
of months. <br>
<br>
I had my system figured out just before Christmas but have only just <br>
now managed to execute the entire solution flawlessly.  Memorization <br>
is really quite easy.  What tripped me up was the length of the <br>
solution.  One must be absolutely perfect and over the course of <br>
such a long solution there are many opportunities for even just a <br>
little slip up which will, of course, ruin the whole enterprise.  It <br>
is indeed an unforgiving style of cubing but its rewards are <br>
correspondingly high when successful :)<br>
<br>
I memorize and solve the beast in the same order as follows:<br>
<br>
stage 1 - solve the orientations (centers, corners, middle edges)<br>
stage 2 - solve the 3x3x3 pieces (corners and middle edges)<br>
stage 3 - solve the x centers<br>
stage 4 - solve the outer edges<br>
stage 5 - solve the + centers.<br>
<br>
The center / middle edge / corner parity is discovered immediately <br>
by analyzing the centercaps.  It is dealt with as I memorize the <br>
information before step 1.  The outedges / + center parity is only <br>
identified when I memorize step 4.  When present it influences how I <br>
approach step 5 and is finally solved as the last task of the <br>
solution.<br>
<br>
One of the real regrets about blindsolving big cubes is not being <br>
able to see the cube gradually approach completion from chaos.  In <br>
order to get even some small pleasure out of this I blindly point my <br>
digital camera towards my cube at the end of each stage of the <br>
solve.  (This is also useful for trying to figure out where things <br>
went wrong on unsuccessful solves).  Some of the pictures are a <br>
little blurry and they are all (except for the very beginning and <br>
very end) off center as it was very much a matter of guessing what <br>
angle to point the camera.<br>
<br>
I always blindsolve with BLUE facing me and WHITE on top.  I took <br>
three photos for every stage of the solve - from straight on, from <br>
the left side, from the right side.  I have uploaded them to the <br>
photos section under the folder &quot;profblind&quot; if anyone is interested <br>
in seeing them.  You will notice that my supercube is not anywhere <br>
near as nice looking as Stefan&#x27;s or Chris&#x27; new stickers.  It is <br>
basically just a regular 5x5x5 painted with nailpolish and with the <br>
centers identified by dots indicting 1-9 like they appear on playing <br>
cards or dice.  Now that such beautiful supercube stickers are <br>
available to us I will be getting in touch with Chris in the very <br>
near future to purchase real supercube stickers.<br>
<br>
I will be returning home to Toronto at the very start of June after <br>
I finish my summer courses at the U of Manitoba.  I intend to write <br>
up a full and detailed account of my method including the algs used <br>
for each step and much more accurate details on the parity solution <br>
but this will need to wait 10 days until the start of my summer <br>
vacation.<br>
<br>
Happy cubing,<br>

Mmh, you wanna say &quot;good bye&quot; to me? Why, because my time is over? 
Hehe ;-)

Yeah, great! Congratulations! I do remember your almost-successes 
you&#x27;ve mentioned before, glad you finally made it!

One thing I do to prevent mistakes is to never in setup moves do 
something like (Rr) when actually I want (r) only, just because (Rr) 
is faster to execute. I did it a while ago and when undoing the setup 
moves I often wondered whether I had to undo (Rr) or (r). Now I always 
know. Rules are good, thinking is bad ;-)

I solve both parities this way: For each type of piece I have an 
&quot;error pair&quot; on the U-layer, e.g. Urf and Ufl for the X-centers. In 
case of a parity problem, I make sure that it&#x27;s this pair (or in case 
of centers, the U center) is wrong. Usually it takes two 3-cycles to 
solve my last piece and break the error pair. Then at the very end, I 
apply up to two algs, one for each parity.

I solve all centers first, then outer edges, then middle edges, then 
corners. I think this way the layer steps have a smaller chance of 
destroying the first (particularly solving the corners will never 
destroy the centers or the edge triples, since I only use outer-layer 
twists) and thus if I make a mistake there then at least I can see 
parts of my cube solved :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Yeah! Well done!

I would certainly be interested in a guid for solving bigger cubes 
blindfolded... Not sure if I will ever try it, but who knows.. Maybe 
I&#x27;ll try it one day.

You (and others) might be interested in the &quot;original Hungarian&quot; or
Ideal made cubes. Those have orange stickers with a good light
reflective glue that lasts much longer than the glue of other

Does anybody has an experience with tiled cubes made few years ago?
I only find Rubik&#x27;s Cube Deluxe Edition made in 1980 for $76 at 
http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=1247
I thought that tiled cubes are in production and available for
something like $15 but it seems not to be true any more.

On www.cubesmith.com you can order &#x27;tiles&#x27; which are not tiles like  
on the deluxe cube, but thin adhesive pieces of vinyl - I have them  
and they are really amazing. They won&#x27;t fade or peel like stickers  
tend to do, and they have a very nice feel to them.

Have a look at a &quot;beginner&quot; solution, such as

http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html

to see what is meant by &quot;the cross&quot;. Once that is done, each of the
first-2-layer algorithms places a missing corner into an angle of the
cross, together with the middle-layer edge next to it.  Note that 
Jasmine&#x27;s diagrams are slightly misleading: most speedcubers using 
this method prefer to solve the bottom layer (or sometimes the left-
hand layer, if right-handed) first.

But, rather than blindly following any algorithms, it is much better
to work out how to do this yourself. Most of the cases are quite 
simple to work out, and thinking about it yourself will help your 
Cube understanding... which is (almost!) necessary for you to make 
easy progress.

Really that is just common sense, but it is emphasized especially in 
J Fridrich&#x27;s description of her own method.

Good luck.
Mike

          <div class="email-content">If you want to begin and to have a good comprehension of the cube, 
You should start by trying to build seral patterns on your cube :

1. A cross (with edges)
2. A complete layer
3. A complete layer with all the pieces well placed (the collors on 
the side are well placed)
4. Place correctly all the edges on the first two layers (without 
the corners on the first layer)
5. Place correctly all the edges on the whole cube
6. Try to find a way to build completely the first two layers
7. Try to orientate the top edges when the F2L are complete
8. Try to orientate the top corners correctly with the F2L and the 
top cross correctly placed

This will take you some time to figure out how to do that, but if 
you can do that : you&#x27;ll only have to learn the PLL of the Fridrich 
method (you can try to find them too :p).

But you should be able to do 1, 2 3 and 4 quite shortly. For the 5 
and the 6 : it&#x27;s possible too, but you have to have faith : it&#x27;s 
possible. Then the 7 and the 8th are quite easy if you have a good 
vision of the cube.

Good luck !

Why not decide what color you want for the First Layer and the Last
Layer, so that you can easily recognize what pieces are where? 

The better you can see the location of the next pieces to place the
faster you can be.

Cheers,

          <div class="email-content">I recommend picking one color and making that color always the first 
layer.  Some people have that color on top, but most have it on 
bottom [or the side].  I used to have it on top, but switched to the 
bottom a few months ago.  

I always use White first, which means yellow is always my last layer 
[remember, the center pieces never move relative to each other, they 
just spin around].  I haven&#x27;t taken a poll or anything, but I think 
white&#x27;s a pretty common pick, probably the most common.

Next step is just do the cross on the white side, then go into the 
F2L algs to complete the first 2 layers.

If you&#x27;re trying to decipher an alg and not sure if you are 
performing the moves correctly, one suggestion is to start with a 
solved cube [take yours apart and put it back together solved if you 
have to], and perform the alg from the solved state and then note 
what changed.  sometimes that helps me understand the algs better.

good luck. stick with it--it&#x27;s worth the effort.

I&#x27;ve been gradually moving away from cross on top. Now I generally
solve like this:
- cross: mostly on left (yes, I&#x27;m right-handed)
- F2L pairs: mostly cross on left, some pairs with cross on bottom
- LL: *almost* all LL algs with cross on bottom, ~2 PLL algs with

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

I would actually like to expand a bit on ur point 6 in the list. 
Otherwise i think the list is quite ok. It will take a while to 
figure out all of that but it&#x27;s really worth it. It surely will 
enhance the understanding of &quot;how the cube works&quot; :-)

I&#x27;d suggest to break up 6 like this:

6a) Figure out how to make complete first 2 layers except that 1 
corner is missing (working corner)

6b) Figure out how to make complete first 2 layers except that 1 
edge of the middle layer is missing (working edge)

6c) Now figure out from either a) or b) how the heck to do the last 
corner or edge. This will make up a complete first 2 layers, leaving 
only the last layer (the remaining points on the list).

Mastering 6a and/or 6b should make the step from 5 to 6 (6c) a bit 
easier :-)

Have fun cubing!

I&#x27;d love to take you up on that but I&#x27;m now in the UK and so won&#x27;t be
able to the make it to the NY comp! If I was still living in Arlington
(where I was for part of last year) then I&#x27;d definitely be coming to
NY. :)

I&#x27;m hoping to make a special effort to get to the US in early Nov

Hi all,

Where can I find details on how to start a cube,
before applying the F2L
algoritms? I have visited several pages, but still
haven&#x27;t found a decent
explanation on how to start.

I assume you all know where I can find this info, so
please help me find it
too.

  I agree. I&#x27;ve had no troulble at all with the stickers on the Ideal
cubes. 

> Does anybody has an experience with tiled cubes made few years ago?

  I&#x27;ve seen about six different ones. The Gyro Cube is the only high
quality clone I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s like the Deluxe Edition but the
underside of the centers are flat.
   There are several which are OK in terms of being light, but avoid
the ones with flash still on the tiles. 
  &quot;Old Brand Magic Square&quot; cube is terrible. Though Stefan P likes
their springs.

   These are the best cubes.

   Seven Towns has refused to produce it again.

   You can get tiles from Mefferts, Chris Licciardi and Mark Longidge.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Bram,<br>
<br>
Art here. Like you I had this problem on how to start. First off as others<br>
might have told you already, you might want to choose whether you want to<br>
start solving the cube from the top to bottom (or vise versa) or left to<br>
right (or vise versa) or from front to back (or vise versa). When you have<br>
done this, to use the F2L you must make a cross or a plus pattern using the<br>
edges of the whatever side you want to solve using F2L.<br>
<br>
Then when you have done the F2L next is the Last Layer which are the<br>
Orientation of the Last Layer (OLL) and Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL)<br>
<br>
I use the cross at the bottom the doing the F2L then OLL then PLL or if I am<br>
lucky and know the PLL of the top pattern I can just skip OLL.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps you in making your current time faster or solving the<br>
cube. Please try looking at other sites or other styles of solving the cube.<br>

It&#x27;s *not* terrible. I just did three solves with mine: 19.91 (PLL=U), 
25.66, 24.92. My average with my best speedcube is 22 seconds. Plus my 
OBMS is painted with a glow-in-the-dark pen.

Yes, I took springs from these cubes to put them into my megaminx 
which had horrible springs. They&#x27;re too long for 3x3s, though.

Also, I do like the thin plastic for modding, i.e. building new 
puzzles from existing ones. I&#x27;m actually building a puzzle from an 
even cheaper clone that doesn&#x27;t have springs and is probably really 
crap to play with (though I won&#x27;t know for sure because I haven&#x27;t even 
sanded/lubed it). It does have a great property, though, but I&#x27;ll keep 
it secret for now. Maybe one day I&#x27;ll add a &quot;puzzle building for 
wimps&quot; section on my website, describing how to build puzzles the easy 
way.

Cheers!
Stefan

But that&#x27;s not a very fair question: compared with corners-first, there 
are so many followers of Fridrich nowadays that the record book is 
bound to be dominated by users of that system.

Marc Waterman is known to have achieved very good times in the 1980s 
with a (rather complex) corners-first system, so it is not necessarily 
slow.

OK, if I&#x27;m understanding this problem right, we can be sure that the 
commutators will start repeating themselves after

n = N(x,y) = LCM(ord x, ord y)

where ord x is the order of element x. So 

C_{mN} = (C_N)^m

However, C_N cannot have an order exceeding 1260.  From this, an easy 
upper bound for a particular x and y is 1260*N(x,y).

You could check out the table of the possible values for the orders 
of elements, and so find the maximum possible N(x,y) pretty quickly, 
but I&#x27;m not so keen to do that myself, as this may be a wildly 
pessimistic bound anyway.

However, is that roughly what you had in mind?  And how did the 
problem arise in the first place?

That&#x27;s pretty much what I was thinking, except that since C_N=C_{N-1}  we get

0 1 2 ... N-1
N           2N-1
2N         3N-1

and so 1260N-1 would work as well.

That&#x27;s exactly what I had in mind. I just thought of it - no particular reason for it - just 
some kind of problem to think about. Then I basically used the same logic as above. I 
thought it might be an interesting sort of thing - especially since it is bounded (for groups 
of finite exponent at least - i.e. where every element has finite order).

Hmmm... well, I wonder if you&#x27;ve thought about this one:

Can you represent every element of the commutator subgroup [half the 
cube group, in other words] by a single commutator?  And, if so: How?

Ah, thanks! I&#x27;d wondered what &quot;finite exponent&quot; meant.

Actually, with my definition C_1=x^{-1}y^{-1}xy isn&#x27;t e (unless x and y commute).

That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using, but note that with n=N(x,y) you get C_{kn}=C_{kn-1} as 
x^{-kn}y^{-kn}x^{kn}y^{kn}=e.
In particular since 1260*N(x,y)-1 will be an upper bound for x,y.

I haven&#x27;t thought about it actually. It&#x27;s a good question though.

Actually &quot;i.e.&quot; was wrong there - finite exponent is a stronger condition than this but it 
does imply that every element has finite order. (If every element has finite order then each 
N(x,y) would be finite, but to get that the set of N(x,y)s is bounded wouldn&#x27;t necessarily 
follow without finite exponent).
The exponent of a group is the LCM of the orders of all the elements (in particular it 
implies that every element has finite order, but every element having finite order does not 
imply the exponent is finite). The exponent is always finite for finite groups though - the 
order of the group would work.

Yes, you&#x27;re right. I should have written C_{n+1}(x,y)=C_n(x,y)x^{-(n+1)}y^{-
(n+1)}x^{n+1}y^{n+1}.
I had intended C_1(x,y) to be the commutator of x and y but I messed up my indices.
Hope you have a good dinner and good night also.

   The first one I got would not turn at all. The second one would
turn all but one side, the third one broke apart *across&quot; two cubies.
I threw the fourth one away without opening it.

A more likely explanation for the domination of the Fridrich system is
that it is a faster system than corner&#x27;s first.

If the question isn&#x27;t fair, can you come up with another practical way
of judging which system is faster?

Timing the fastest speedcubers cannot prove it, unfortunately.  I&#x27;ve 
no strong views either way, btw -- but I object to the assumptions... 
a bit like saying that the fastest running shoes are those worn by 
the fastest runners.

Fridrich&#x27;s system was &quot;first on the market&quot; for the new generations 
of speedcubers.  These users have had the benefit of many websites 
telling them how to do it, right down to collections of finger 
tricks.  Sadly, we can&#x27;t reproduce those conditions for corners-
first, so an experiment with controls is an unlikely prospect!

   The corner and edge pieces of the white cubes are larger than the
corner and edge pieces of the black DIY cubes. The black centers don&#x27;t
hold the white pieces far enough apart to work without some serious
jerry rigging  or bodging.

<br>
Yesterday I got a new best average of 10 time: 34.22s<br>
40.62s, 30.17s, 34.97s, 31.48s, (27.95s), 42.44s, 30.96s, 30.11s,<br>
(42.53s), 34.17s, 30.94s, 36.32s<br>
<br>
And this morning I did my first average with all 12 solves sub-40s.<br>
39.05, 32.99, 38.42, 31.54, 36.20, 36.55, 35.06, (39.93), 38.66,<br>
(30.02), 35.43, 39.93<br>
<br>
Also, I reckon I can now comfortably say that my _real_ average is now<br>
sub-40s. I&#x27;ve done 64 solves this weekend with an overall average of<br>
36.95s. And the last few cubing sessions I&#x27;ve done (totally hundreds<br>

BTW, timing and scrambles were done with JNetCube.<br>

Mmh, maybe I misunderstand, but aren&#x27;t we just asking how often I have 
to apply a specific commutator until we reach identity? Shouldn&#x27;t then 
the general upper limit of simply 1260 also apply here?

Yeah ok if you do it that way, I&#x27;m not surprised ;-) Here&#x27;s what to do 
with them:

1) Buy it.
2) Do *NOT* play with it.
3) Disassemble by removing a center cap, then the screw and center 
piece. Do *NOT* disassemble the normal way (popping an edge out).
4) (optional, I don&#x27;t think I did) cut imperfections and sand pieces
5) Lube.
6) Adjust tensions in all six centers (probably loosening the screws).
7) Assemble normally.
8) Play.

I.e. don&#x27;t treat it like a normal cube before you&#x27;ve prepared it.

That wouldn&#x27;t cover all cases. I do have at least one idea that would 
make both building a certain puzzle easier and the puzzle itself 
better. And without crap ingredients. I don&#x27;t want to use crap, I want 
to make building easier. Sometimes they coincide.

Cheers!

<br>
Three weeks ago I put together a white DIY with the centers of a <br>
black DIY and I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively ever since.  I used the <br>
white center caps and had to use superglue for them since they don&#x27;t <br>
have any other way of fitting to the black center,  but that&#x27;s the <br>
only rigging it&#x27;s had.  I initially lubed it and found it to be much <br>
too slick for me to control,  so i washed it off and it&#x27;s still <br>
slicker than I was ever able to make my black DIY.  I&#x27;m also <br>
thinking the white doesn&#x27;t break itself in as fast as the black does <br>
in that the dirty looking dust isn&#x27;t showing up as much as my black <br>
ones.  For me,  I like this because my cube came out great from the <br>
start (after removing the lube),  so I&#x27;m hoping it will have a <br>
longer life before the corners become too loose and jiggly.  <br>
<br>
   Was there ever a definitive answer to this being a legal cube?  <br>
It is somewhat canabalized from two Rubik&#x27;s products and there is no <br>
way of seeing a difference without taking it apart.  I do like this <br>
cube.<br>

Not exactly: if [x,y] denotes the commutator of x and y then we&#x27;re
looking at the sequence:
C_0=e
C_1=e[x,y]
C_2=e[x,y][x^2,y^2]
C_3=e[x,y][x^2,y^2][x^3,y^3]
...
C_{n+1}=C_n[x^{n+1},y^{n+1}]

[x^n,y^n] is the identity (when n is the least common multiple of the
orders of x and y, for example).
Then [x^{n+1},y^{n+1}]=[x,y] and so C_{n+1}=C-nC_1 in this situtation.
Similarly, C_{n+k}=C_nC_k and so C_{nm}=(C_n)^m.
Also, C_{nm-1}=C_{nm} so C_{nm-1}=(C_n)^m.
(C_n)^m=e for some m&lt;=1260, but that doesn&#x27;t the least k>0 with C_k=e
will be &lt;=1260. We just know it is &lt;=1260*n-1.
It&#x27;s possible to compute an upper bound for n that is independent of
x,y and hence one for the group. The exponent of the group would do
(it&#x27;s the least n>0 such that for every x in the group x^n=e i.e. the
LCM of the orders of the elements of the group).

Ah, ok, so I did misunderstand, sorry... Makes it suddenly a lot more

I think these two statements confused me. I don&#x27;t think they correctly 
describe what you mean. For example they seem to say:

C_3=[x^3,y^3][x^3,y^3][x^3,y^3]

C_3=C_2[x^3,y^3]=(C_1[x^2,y^2])[x^3,y^3]=e[x,y][x^2,y^2][x^3,y^3].

Maybe I didn&#x27;t put it clearly, Why does it look like C_3=[x^3,y^3][x^3,y^3][x^3,y^3]? I 
don&#x27;t see how you can get that.

Oh, ok, for some reason I thought C_n is a _number_ which is then 
_multiplied_ with the commutator. Sorry again, not my day ;-)

I use a pretty standard 3-look LL method... cross (always white), 
F2L pairs, orient edges, orient corners, permute all.

My best single solve is 23.12s. I can get sub-30s times, but not 
very often. Of the 64 cubes I did this weekend, only 2 were sub-30s. 
Although 6 were *almost* sub-30s (i.e. 6 solves were 30.xx) so I&#x27;m 
definitely improving! :) On the downside, 16 of the solves were over 
40s though. :(

What method do you use?

The white caps are making up for the center cubies being smaller? How
did you tune the cube with the centers off? 

Would you check and see if your black DIY parts are smaller than the
white DIY parts?

&gt;<br>
    Not at all,  the two centers are the same size.  The white cap&#x27;s <br>
edges are flush with the black center.  The only way of seeing they <br>
weren&#x27;t made for each other,  other than the obvious color <br>
difference,  is that the ridge on the back of the white cap is farther <br>
inboard than the black&#x27;s inside is thick.  Maybe that&#x27;s a bad <br>
explanation,  I&#x27;m saying the white cap can&#x27;t be put onto the black <br>
center and remain on it&#x27;s own by simply pressing it on,  it must be <br>
glued.  Conversely,  the black cap&#x27;s ridge would have be cut or shaved <br>
off to fit onto the white center,  then of course glued to remain.  <br>
   <br>
&gt; Would you check and see if your black DIY parts are smaller than the<br>
&gt; white DIY parts?<br>
&gt;<br>
    The cubies are all the same size.  They are obviously made from <br>
different molds,  but I&#x27;ve mixed them together on both black rounded <br>
centers and the white flat centers and the cubies all interact fine.  <br>
Turning the mixed cubes,  I can feel a difference in that not all <br>
turns feel as smooth,  but I think it&#x27;s attributed to the difference <br>
in the white and black plastics,  not the fitting of the pieces.   <br>

   I understood you explanation just fine. Thanks for checking the

   I wonder why each cubie of my black plastic cube is smaller than
the respective piece of the white plastic one. How very strange.

Basically, the cube wasn&#x27;t lined up properly.

You missed a closing > symbol on each of the anchors for the images 
except for the first image. In most browsers, this will result in the 
user unable to see any image.

But the report on the event is very good, I enjoyed reading about it.
Thanks for posting it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m really enjoying reading about the tournament since I didn&#x27;t get <br>
to see much of it myself so keep those reports and pictures coming!  <br>
I&#x27;ve got 4 hours of video to sift through and I&#x27;m looking for people <br>
to host some clips from the tournament.  If you&#x27;ve got some space on <br>
your website, please e-mail me privately and let me know how much <br>
space you have.  I&#x27;ll post to the group once videos are up.<br>
<br>
<br>
I really enjoyed the weekend (despite some serious sleep <br>
deprivation) and it was great seeing some old friends and making <br>
some new ones.  The competition was even better than I expected with <br>
numerous world and American records set.  Six of the eight finalists <br>
averaged sub-20 in the finals!  <br>
<br>
This event wouldn&#x27;t have happened without the efforts of a bunch of <br>
people so a great big thank you to:<br>
<br>
All the competitors for making the trip to New York (in particular <br>
to Tyson, Ryan, Macky, Chris H., and Rich for traveling so far).<br>
The Horace Mann School for the use of their facilities.<br>
Winning-Moves for donating prizes.<br>
cubesmith.com for donating stickers for all the competitors.<br>
Tyson for scrambling, judging, organizing, and a million other <br>
things.<br>
Jason for doing all things excel and for entering the 4x4 <br>
competition moments after learning the parity algs.<br>
HM volunteers (Marco, Aram - did anyone recognize him as the young <br>
Ben Stiller from the Royal Tannenbaums?, Fran, Eleanor, Johnny, <br>
Amanda and a few others whose names I&#x27;ve forgotten (sorry!)) for <br>
judging and other important stuff.<br>
Jeremy for filming.<br>
Maria, Laura, and Alison for running the concession stand.<br>
Peter for technical support.<br>
My wife Theresa for single-handedly running the BBQube.<br>
Everyone else who scrambled, judged, or helped out in any way.<br>
<br>
All in all, I was very pleased with the event.  Now it&#x27;s time to get <br>
back to reality and start grading 102 final exams. :)<br>

I have always felt more comfortable cubing with my left hand than my
right.  I imagine I can solve it at least 30 seconds or so faster with
my left hand than my right.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everybody! For a while now I&#x27;ve been working on<br>
improving my methods for solving the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5<br>
two different ways, or what I like to call a<br>
&quot;multisolve&quot;. <br>
<br>
For those who aren&#x27;t familiar with this, I&#x27;ll explain:<br>
the 4x4x4 can be scrambled as a 2x2x2 or a 3x3x3, and<br>
the 5x5x5 can be scrambled as a 3x3x3 in two different<br>
ways. By scrambling the puzzle first one way and then<br>
the other, and then solving in reverse order, the<br>
puzzle becomes a &quot;custom&quot; 2x2x2 or 3x3x3 that has<br>
different &quot;pieces&quot; every time. Especially challenging<br>
are the two cases that require orienting the centers<br>
in the first stage of the solve. I will refer to these<br>
as the &quot;hard&quot; cases, and the other two as the &quot;easy&quot;<br>
cases.<br>
<br>
I find multisolves to be very fun, and also quite<br>
addictive to try to improve on, because of the greater<br>
challenges they provide in piece recognition. Because<br>
speedcubing.com has records from only 3 or 4 other<br>
people in these categories, I must assume that few<br>
people have ever tried multisolves, probably because<br>
they never even considered them. It would be great to<br>
get some more people interested, and compare times and<br>
methods.<br>
<br>
Anyway, here are my best times for all four types:<br>
<br>
4x4x4 easy case <br>
(scramble as 3x3x3, then as 2x2x2) <br>
1:15.84<br>
<br>
4x4x4 hard case <br>
(scramble as 2x2x2, then as 3x3x3)<br>
2:24.77<br>
<br>
5x5x5 easy case <br>
(scramble using only outer layers, then both layers)<br>
1:45.95<br>
<br>
5x5x5 hard case<br>
(scramble using both layers, then only outer layers)<br>
2:45.06<br>
<br>
Except for the 4x4x4 easy case, these times are by far<br>
the fastest I know of. While that&#x27;s great, it simply<br>
doesn&#x27;t seem right when you consider that multisolves<br>
are basically 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 solves, and there are<br>
dozens of active members in this group alone who can<br>
beat me in those categories by a wide margin. So, in<br>
order to rectify this: I DARE anyone to beat my times!<br>
That should do it. Now to sit back and await my<br>
comeuppance, which will no doubt be arriving shortly.<br>

Seriously - its a strange phenomonen this left-right hand thing you guys all

thought it would also be worth noting that while the

can&#x27;t wait to get one!

This is truly fun :-) Once you get to the second phase it&#x27;s such a 
relief...

I know I&#x27;ve seen them on SCC but I can&#x27;t find them anymore. Where are 
they?

Or with a commutator based on E-slice, since it&#x27;s a matter of edges:
[BR&#x27;UB&#x27;R, E].
BR&#x27;UB&#x27;R E R&#x27;BU&#x27;RB&#x27; D is 13 QTM moves too, but 12 SQTM ;-)

ACube found this one: R&#x27;BU2S&#x27;U&#x27;SRUR&#x27;B&#x27; (11 HTM, 10 STM).
Probably not faster than yours.

But you made me think about something again. How about this:
L&#x27; u&#x27; B2 M&#x27; B&#x27; M E&#x27; B&#x27; U L

But I modified it even further:
R&#x27; S R S&#x27; E R E&#x27; R&#x27;

*You* (Gilles) should&#x27;ve found something like this and you know why ;
-) Actually I think you might like this execution even better:
l&#x27; E&#x27; R E x&#x27; E R E&#x27; R&#x27;
What do you say?

Yeah ok ok, so in the meantime you did. Don&#x27;t you hate it when someone

Hi Jason,

I&#x27;ve an alg for you. For me it&#x27;s the simplest and quickest.

To watch it work put the First Level on the left and the Last Level on
the right (or vice-versa) and the middle pair to be flipped and
swapped on the bottom.

I use r to mean the slice next to R. Turn r the same direction that
you would turn R.

r U r U&#x27; r&#x27; U r&#x27; U&#x27;

Cheers,

David J

Nice David, that&#x27;s really the simplest.


This reminds me an idea I had a few years ago (and I&#x27;m certainly not
the only one), you could solve the F2L following this algorithm:
1) Solve the first layer.
2) Solve 2 middle edges (neighbours). If you assume that at least a
middle edge already lies in the last layer, and considering symetries,
the number of sequences needed is really small. Some would look like
Waterman&#x27;s, others can be enhanced for speed.
3) Solve the last 2 middle edges.

I don&#x27;t think this strategy can be better than the standard approach,
only in special cases when the first layer looks easy. But you
certainly can solve the F2L in less than 10s and I&#x27;d be curious to see
someone optimize it for speed...

Gilles.

I&#x27;m yet another one who uses the left (non-dominant) hand. Can do the 
Cube with it (rather slowly), and also Square-1 (painfully slow). In 
normal, two-handed solving my left hand doesn&#x27;t do much at all after 
the F2L.

Strange... it&#x27;s not the general picture emerging here, anyway.

I can do it even shorter. Hold the two edges at FL and FR and do:

Another very fast one that does the job (I hope):

Looks good, but is 90% mystery to me ;-) Can you explain how/why it 
works? It reminds me of another special F2L alg I recently found on 
SCC:
R U2 R2 u&#x27; R&#x27; u R
I don&#x27;t understand that one, either... :-(

  You are right. I moved *fewer* pieces (other than the pair
specified) than in his example.

My cube isn&#x27;t particularly loose but it is much better than it once was. I suggest you turn a 
slice through 45 degrees and spray the exposed innards. You&#x27;ll be able to hit either one 
side of 2 slices or 1 side of 2 slices and 2 sides of a third, depending which slice (outer or 
inner) you rotate. Do this for several slices and slice them back in. This will get the spray 
inside. I used this technique on my 4x4x4 and my 5x5x5.

Think with blocks instead of sides.
It looked like a case where you have to break things already built to
create a free space, and reinsert them the same way, or in another way.

(r&#x27;Uru) takes the B-BR-BRD-BD 1x2x2 block out of the F2L and moves it
to a safe place.
(Bu&#x27;B&#x27;) puts it back in another way, changing unsafe middle edges.
It works like (R&#x27;URU)(BU&#x27;B), but with a block.
I found that (R&#x27;U&#x27;R) between the two (change a few things in the free
space) answers the problem.

Based on this, you can build similar sequences:
- (r&#x27;Uru)(BUB&#x27;U&#x27;)(Bu&#x27;B&#x27;)
- (r&#x27;Uru)(R&#x27;U2R)(Bu&#x27;B&#x27;)
- (BuB&#x27;)(BUB&#x27;U&#x27;)(Bu&#x27;B&#x27;) = BuUB&#x27;U&#x27;Bu&#x27;B&#x27; changes only 1 edge, but I like
it more than other shorter sequences.
- etc.

When dealing with partial F2L, I mean 2*1x2x3, more optimizations can
be found.


I admit that&#x27;s not very scientifical :-)


Gilles.

Emne: [Speed cubing group] Cubing while juggling (3 of them)
 
solving a cube one-handed while solving two other cubes in the other 
hand and cycling them through until having all three solved:
3:09.00

I&#x27;m done with finals and have a lot of time on hand...when Richard 
Patterson IMed me with the idea, I just had to try it. ;)

Just had to share.

          <div class="email-content">You juggle two cubes in one hand, then solve the third cube in the  
other hand.  Then you just switch off the cubes with some type of cross  
throw and you repeat until all cubes are solved.  Then you proceed to  
get another four cubes, so you juggle all 7 cubes, you do a db97531,  
and then you&#x27;re done.

As can be seen in the subject, his question was about F2L. So you 
change *more* pieces: One more 2nd layer edge and if you hold the cube 
like you suggested then also a 1st layer edge :-)

Thanks, your explanation and the other examples helped a lot.

How about this one?
R U&#x27; M&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; M

It&#x27;s basically (R U&#x27; R&#x27;) (r U R&#x27; U&#x27; M), I found that second part 
recently when I tried to get rid of cube rotations and F turns for 
that case. Actually I&#x27;d execute the combination as (R U&#x27; r R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; 
R r&#x27;). If you start with left thumb on F and right thumb on D then 
it&#x27;s quite fast. Mmh, actually then (R U&#x27; l&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; l) feels nice, 
too... But I&#x27;d certainly prefer my new one if the LL corners look 
good, since they&#x27;re not changed.

Hmm, another thought. Inverses. Try (r R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R r&#x27; U R&#x27;) and (l&#x27; U 
R U&#x27; l U R&#x27;). Strange, why did I never before think about using 
inverses of F2L algs?

Cheers!

Thanks for sharing. From my point of view (I&#x27;m a beginner), that&#x27;s
really impressive! A video?

PS: I don&#x27;t feel proud when I&#x27;m juggling, but well, I don&#x27;t care,
having fun :-)

Hi Stefan, 

I wrote, > To watch it work put the First Level on the left and the
Last Level on the right (or vice-versa) and the middle pair to be
flipped and swapped on the bottom. &lt;

&quot;Vice versa&quot; means you can have the FL on the right, and therefore it
doesn&#x27;t have to change any edge on the First Level.

Besides, I do the F2L differently from you.

To swap two edges you must swap either two other edges or two corners
minimum. My &quot;flip two edges and swap them,&quot; only swapped two other
edges - that is minimum.

r U r U&#x27; r&#x27; U r&#x27; U&#x27; makes fewer changes than his > R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 y2 z
M U M U M U2 M&#x27; U M&#x27; U M&#x27; U2  &lt; which additionally changes the
position of four corners and two edges.

My statement is accurate. :)

Cheers,

David J

I know what it means. But it was written in parentheses which makes it 
look like an alternative only, the main option being putting it on the 
left.

> Besides, I do the F2L differently from you.

Still, as long as with &quot;F2L&quot; you don&#x27;t mean two adjacent outer layers 
(which would be kinda strange (though maybe I just invented a new 
method)), I think you change a third F2L edge (which we don&#x27;t).

> My statement is accurate. :)

Well, obviously depends on how one counts ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

Try this out:

www.geocities.com/rubiks_galaxia/4lookLL.html

Try this approach for the LL...

1. flip up edges
you already know how to do this.

2. flip up corners
Using the sequences on the page I provided, you should
be able to complete this step.

3. position corners
sequences are on the page I provided

4. position edges
again, sequences are on the page I provided

Hope this helps!

          <div class="email-content">I can&#x27;t make out exactly where you are in the solve, but the last layer
algoritms you can use would be:
 
Positioning corners:
    Put good corner in UFR position and apply R2 D&#x27; L R&#x27; F2 R L&#x27; U2 D R2
    You might have to do this twice.    
    If you dont have any good corners, just apply the algoritm and you will
get one.
 
Rotating corners:
    Put wrong corner in UFR position
    To rotate clockwise, apply F D F&#x27; D&#x27; F D F&#x27; D&#x27;
    To rotate counterclockwise, apply D F D&#x27; F&#x27; D F D&#x27; F&#x27;
        Turn U until you have another wrong corner in UFR position (Keep the
rest of the cube in the same position!!!!!!!) and apply algoritm. Repeat
until all corners are correct.
 
I am not a speedcuber myself, but this works for me.
 
Good luck solving the cube.

Onderwerp: [Speed cubing group] Last Layer Corner Piece Position



I&#x27;d like to get on to speedcubing, but I gotta be able to solve it 
first. Down the road maybe. 

In any case, I can complete the first 2 layers and make the cross on 
the final layer with no problems. I position the cube with the cross 
up.

I&#x27;ve got the final layer edges positioned as well. 

This leaves 4 corners on the final layer. 

1 of the 4 is in the correct position (but not oriented correctly).

Using any number of sites (4 to be exact), I am left with the same 
results each time. When I try to position the 3 remaining LL corners 
into their respective corners, I get an out of place corner on the 
bottom layer. If I position the cross up and the correct position 
corner piece in the Upper Right Corner, and then apply U R U&#x27; L&#x27; U R&#x27; 
U&#x27; L, I get the back bottom corner out of color. If I repeat the same 
move 2 more times, I&#x27;ll be back where I started. Any ideas

2 hours seems excessive.  Have you used Jaap&#x27;s instructions?  I found 
them very helpful!

          <div class="email-content">The only springs I have *ever* broken were when I tried to grind their 
ends flat with a dremel clone and did too much. I have *never* broken 
a spring inside a puzzle (and I do have numerous puzzles of different 
types including studio cubes).

I&#x27;d assume it&#x27;s because you tightened the springs too much. The studio 
cubes have way too strong springs and a much much better way to reduce 
pops is to use weaker springs (which will also reduce the general 
tension/friction). I have a mint one which I haven&#x27;t lubed or sanded 
yet, which doesn&#x27;t pop (well, unless I really purposely try to, 
actually it&#x27;s not even easy to disassemble) and which already allows 
me to do the T-perm four times in 10 seconds (i.e. 5.6 moves/second) 
fairly easily (with a good cube I need about 8.5 seconds unless I lock 
up). All I did was replace the springs and add some washers.

Cheers!
Stefan

Thanks.  I am a brute after all. ;)

This is the first cube (or other puzzle) I&#x27;ve had this problem with, 
but not the first that I have &quot;punished&quot; by screwing its centres down.  
One of those has been cannibalized for springs, but they seem to be 
only a little softer than the studio springs.

Will any nasty cube do as a source?  I don&#x27;t remember ever seeing your 
favourite OBMS... does it have any aliases?

My main speedcube is a Studio cube, I bought it in January and I&#x27;d <br>

   The parentheses indicate a legitimate alternative, not some
inferior alternative. If it is allowed it is allowed, period. 

   The primary elements, the flip and swap, are accomplished both ways. 

   I do middle edges before First Level edges, with the option of
doing two middle edges both before or after the four First Level corners.

  My solution changes three middle layer edges and one edge on either
the First Level or the Last Level. At no time does it effect both
First Level and Last level.

  I do change a third middle edge, but that is fine in my F2L method.

  No, it doesn&#x27;t.  :P

  His original two algs have an unecessary U2, leaving two edges and
all four LL corners out of place.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
There&#x27;s no harm in thinking about US Nationals 2006.  In terms of a <br>
venue selection, I would like to hold this tournament in some place <br>
that we&#x27;ve actually had experience with.  I know a lot of the mid-west <br>
cubers were talking about the Great Mall but unless we&#x27;ve held a <br>
tournament there, I don&#x27;t want to take the risk with a new environment. <br>
  With that said, I have only a handful of venue locations right now.  <br>
In order to save space on discussion, I would recommend that discussion <br>
for US Nationals takes place in the Caltech group so we don&#x27;t flood all <br>
the non-US readers with countless e-mails.<br>
<br>
My first choice right now, and this is very early in the process, would <br>
be the Exploratorium Museum in San Francisco, CA.  We held our Winter <br>
Tournament 2005 there and it was a lot of fun.  Also, we had hundreds <br>
of spectators because it was an open event and it was just another day <br>
in the museum.  We met after the tournament and discussed the problems <br>
we had and they can all be fixed.  The Exploratorium will probably be <br>
our choice for the Caltech Winter Tournament 2006 so we would have <br>
another chance to be there before a US National tournament, which would <br>
take place in the summer of 2006.  And another thing... at the <br>
Exploratorium, we would have enough judges... and this is guaranteed.  <br>
They have high school students who work/volunteer etc. and they loved <br>
seeing the cube last time...<br>
<br>
Another idea is to hold it at Caltech again.  I am slightly reluctant <br>
because of the inaccessibility to food at Caltech.  However, we all <br>
know this venue very well and so it would be very easy to run a smooth <br>
tournament here.<br>
<br>
A third idea is Horace Mann, in New York.  However, like Caltech, these <br>
are private places.  The media coverage for a tournament in a museum <br>
would easily be 100 times more than the media attention at a private <br>
institution.<br>
<br>
Of course, there is a bit more hassle with competing in a museum but I <br>
must say, I had a great time in San Francisco last January and I think <br>
it&#x27;s a lot of fun.  I realize that two of these choices are again on <br>
the west coast.  For a US National tournament though, I don&#x27;t want to <br>
be playing around with a venue we haven&#x27;t been at.  We had a few issues <br>
at the Exploratorium and we know what these issues are now and we can <br>
avoid them.<br>
<br>
One more thing is that I would probably be in favor of a two day event. <br>
  A one day event is extremely exhausting for the tournament organizers. <br>
  Furthermore, with the growing numbers of participants in Rubik&#x27;s Cube <br>
competitions these days, a two day event may be the only feasible idea.<br>
<br>
So feel free to suggest places.  I would recommend, again, that <br>
discussion takes place in the Caltech group.  I can try talking to a <br>
few major amusement parks around, and I&#x27;m sure that would be fun, but I <br>
would be hesitant to hold a national tournament in an unfamiliar venue.<br>

I only used springs from those cheap clone cubes for my megaminx. Its 
springs were *way* too strong, even much stronger than those of the 
studio cubes. So the springs of the clones were much better. But 
they&#x27;re much too long (and probably too strong) for 3x3s (actually for 
most puzzles except the current megaminx, not even the older megaminx 
because it had much shorter screws).

Now I used springs that I&#x27;ve bought from an industrial spring 
manufacturer. I had to buy lots of them to get good prices. The 
manufacturer I chose is relatively cheap I think but if you only buy a 
single spring you pay 2-3 Euros, not even including shipping. The 
price drops rapidly with higher quantities but unfortunately you can&#x27;t 
mix different springs. If you want 100 of type X and 100 of type Y 
then no matter how similar they are, you have to pay them separately. 
You can *not* pay the cheaper per-spring-price for 200 pieces. I ended 
up with four orders so far, almost 1000 springs altogether, spending a 
little more than 100 Euros. Yep, just for springs.

Cheers!
Stefan

Definitely yes!

I know exactly what you mean. My studio cubes (also from Hungary) were 
exactly like you described. Either way too stiff (even after lubing) 
or popping horribly all the time. Now thanks to better springs they&#x27;re 
great.

Cheers!

The world record one, that is. I have used other new springs for my 
other megaminxs and I think they&#x27;ll be even better. A few days ago I 
got a non-lucky 1:38 as the fourth solve of a mint megaminx, which was 
*not* lubed, I had only used some better springs and washers.

Cheers!

So, what kind of springs do i want? Ones with less or more tension,  
longer or shorter than the ones currently in my studio cube?

The length (about 10 mm) is ok. But the wire should be thinner. 
Completely compress a spring, measure its compressed height and divide 
by the number of coils to get the wire diameter. Will probably be 
somewhere around 0.6 to 0.7 mm, right?

I have 0.5 and 0.32, both with middle coil diameter 4 mm and length 10 
and 12.7 mm, respectively.

The 0.5 might still be too strong but it&#x27;s certainly better already 
and it&#x27;s the thinnest I can order with ends ground flat already 
(though they don&#x27;t do the best job and I often sand them even further, 
but they&#x27;re much better than not ground at all and if you use washers 
it gets even less important).

The 0.32 are maybe a bit too weak but it depends on your cubing style. 
Diameter 0.4 is also available, maybe that&#x27;s perfect.

But I like the two strengths I have very much. Depends on the cube 
which is better. If you have screws with large heads or if you use 
large washers to reach the same effect, then 0.5 is excellent because 
you don&#x27;t even get close to full compression. For example I use the 0.
5 ones in my newest megaminx, together with 1 nylon washer and 5 metal 
washers (in each center) and it feels perfect.

Don&#x27;t know whether you&#x27;ll find cheap suppliers, maybe I could sell 
some of those that I have (and get back some of that 100+ Euros ;-).

Cheers!
Stefan

<br>
The FMC has a new, fresh look, and registration has opened for the special Team Fewest Moves Event which will be held to celebrate FMC #100!<br>
<br>
Registered competitors will be put into teams of 3, and will be given 5 weeks to solve the special scramble as a team.You can communicate as much as possible via email, phone, or whatever, and if it is possible, you will be teamed with people who live near you so you could even arrange a face to face meeting!<br>
<br>
You are guaranteed to learn lots from the experience, and you will also have a lot of fun!<br>
<br>
Absolutely anyone is welcome to take part, and if you are a beginner, you are sure to be teamed up with a more knowledgeable FMC&#x27;er so you can get the most out of the competition!<br>
<br>
All you have to do to take part in this &quot;historic&quot; event is to register your details using the Team FMC registration form. The form is on this page http://www.cubestation.co.uk/fmcresults/teamfmc100.php - or alternatively you can visit www.cubestation.co.uk, click on the Fewest Moves Challenge link in the Red menu panel, and then click the yellow box to get to the Team FMC page. And why not browse around the new look FMC pages while you are there :)<br>
<br>
Full details of the competition will be emailed to all registered competitors, and registration closes at around FMC week 95, and the scramble will be released at FMC #96.<br>

If you&#x27;d like to sell me some that&#x27;d be much easier than me hunting

Oh, shoot.  I spotted an OBMS yesterday and - not believing my good

When you reckon you&#x27;ve found &quot;the perfect spring&quot;, please let us all 
know - we could help you recoup your investment :)

Just to clarify my quote above: The original megaminx springs were the 
ones that were way too strong. The clone cube springs were much better 
inside the megaminx. They&#x27;re just not good for cubes I think (except 
maybe the clone cubes themselves, maybe they have more room inside the 
centers).

There&#x27;s no such thing as *the* perfect spring. It always depends on 
what you want it for and what you&#x27;d like it to be. I&#x27;m still 
experimenting a lot, actually I enjoy buying old cubes (not 
necessarily only original Rubik, the &quot;wonderful puzzler&quot; is very very 
good, too, for example) from flea markets, clean them, replace springs 
and add washers, adjust tension, sand and lube the cubies. Most of 
these cubes can be easily turned into great speedcubes I think. So I 
see a lot of different cubes (or also octagons for example), with 
different wear and different screw heads and different plastic and I&#x27;m 
trying to find out what&#x27;s good for what. I think I&#x27;d like the 0.32 
springs for mods like the half-truncated cube because I&#x27;d like them to 
turn very easily.

I think my 0.5 springs in combination with my washers are pretty 
perfect for the current Megaminx. They seem to work well with the 
older Megaminx, too, but with fewer washers since it had much shorter 
screws. The Megaminx only has one source (Meffert) and it doesn&#x27;t wear 
as much as cubes (partly because most people play less with it) so I 
think most current Megaminxs are almost the same, thus &quot;the&quot; perfect 
spring for it makes much more sense than for 3x3. Would anyone want 
new springs+washers for Megaminx (I know there aren&#x27;t many Megaminx 
fans out there)?

Cheers!
Stefan

I have stated this before, but i will again for completeness: I would 
be game for a competition of any sorts, and live in Toronto.  I am 
pretty sure that Matt Walker would be interested, too. He lives within 
driving distance of Toronto.

Personally, I just need something to use in a studio cube, so that I 
can tighten it enough to prevent popping, without making it difficult 
to turn.  It sounds as if Bryan needs the same.  There must be 
others, too.  Surely 6 good springs would be worth at least $6 from 
each of us.  Just think about all...

Not for me -- at the moment.  But how about the Dogic?

  I have stated this before, but i will again for completeness: I would 
  be game for a competition of any sorts, and live in Toronto.  I am 
  pretty sure that Matt Walker would be interested, too. He lives within 
  driving distance of Toronto.

----------------------------Original Letter From Mefferts------------------------------------------------------<br>
 <br>
Hi, all, I need your help.  I am creating a new supporting website for <br>
www.mefferts.com that will <br>
feature daily online puzzles with weekly, monthly and annual <br>
competitions featuring great prizes.  <br>
The new site will be translated into more than 100 different <br>
languages(!), so I need to keep the <br>
amount of text to an absolute minimum. This is where I need your help.<br>
<br>
Do you have a clever idea for pictures, picture Icons and symbols that <br>
could substitute for text?  <br>
Something like the great FWD and PLAY symbols now used on all VCRs and <br>
DVD players? I will also need<br>
ideas for Menu items, such as Hints, Contact Us, Media, Make Home Page, <br>
Add to Favorites, Link to Us<br>
and Shop.  I wantt to use as few words as possible: just  pictures, <br>
symbols and a little bit of <br>
English. <br>
<br>
Also needed: <br>
[bullet] An icon for &quot;New Free Game of the Day&quot; -- any smart ideas for <br>
that?  <br>
<br>
[bullet] A &quot;people&quot; icon showing how many people are online playing at <br>
any one time <br>
<br>
[bullet]The online Puzzle Competitions <br>
<br>
[bullet] For &quot;About Uwe Meffert &amp; Puzzles and Education.&quot;  These two <br>
items could be combined into one,<br>
just requiring one click on my &quot;mug shot&quot; (head photo). Any better <br>
ideas?<br>
<br>
Please, I welcome your suggestions.  I know this newsletter reaches one <br>
of the most creative groups<br>
of people on the Internet -- Puzzlers -- and I&#x27;m sure you have some <br>
innovative ideas just waiting to <br>
be expressed. So let me have them! Suggestions that are used in <br>
creating our new website will receive<br>
a FREE puzzle of their choice from our online shop. Put your brains to <br>
work, Puzzlers!<br>

I&#x27;d probably sell that but do you think anyone would pay that much? 
Maybe for 12 springs + 60 washers (that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve put in my 
megaminx) with its almost guaranteed big improvement...

I usually buy old original Rubik or good clones (Wonderful Puzzler 
maybe?) for 1 Euro, sometimes 2. Recently I paid 5 for a clone (I 
think) but it has arched centers and it&#x27;ll probably become one of my 
very best cubes (I haven&#x27;t sanded/lubed it yet and can only average 
about 30 seconds, but I feel lubrication will work extremely well on 
this one).

Yep, I&#x27;ve done that, too. With still different springs, though, 0.5mm 
wire diameter and uncompressed length 7mm only. Can you do this 
without much force?

By the way, I&#x27;ve never used washers on a cube before. Where do you  
put them, and what&#x27;s the benefit?

Do you mean another one like the online WCC we tried a while ago? I
entered last time we did this, but most of my team didn&#x27;t submit times
so we got disqualified. :/

I&#x27;d be happy to give it another go though. :)

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, something like that.  I actually pitched the idea to ESPN... and 
if they like it, it would be cool to fly everyone to a single location. 
  I dunno, that might be a long shot.  So don&#x27;t get too excited... yet.

Like Bryan, I would pay that much.  It would be well worth it, given 
the amount of time one spends on the Cube.

No, I can&#x27;t do that.  (I had seen the TP thread, btw.)  Despite the 
larger number of springs needed compared with the Cube, I wouldn&#x27;t want 
to spend very much more than $6 per set.  The Dogics look good on the 
shelf, but don&#x27;t seem much fun to play with (solving is too 
repetitive).  On the other hand, it would be good to have them turning 
well.

          <div class="email-content">Gaetan Guimond&#x27;s method is very, very fast for the 2x2x2,
http://www.rubikscuberecord.com/methode_en.html

I would also recommend looking into either CLL or COLL.  If you solve
OLL/PLL style then COLL would be useful for the 3x3 for you as well. 
I know people still do CLL/ELL as well.

CLL is better for the 2x2x2 but not useful for the 3x3x3 unless you
either do CLL/ELL or other cool tricks for the LL.

COLL is slower for the 2x2x2 than CLL, but also useful for 3x3.

          <div class="email-content">Among the students that I know at Temecula Valley High, there
is one 16 second average (Ryan Patricio), 2 other guys that
can probably average under 30,  one guy at 35, maybe 3 in the 40&#x27;s,
and possibly another 5 people under 60...and those are  people I know...
the students and I estimate that about 200 students out of about 3000 can do 
the cube...
it&#x27;s like a virus ;-)...I am guessing there are probably a number of 
sub-60&#x27;s that I don&#x27;t know...at least there are rumors ;-)

There are a couple of girls in my classes that have gone under a minute (47 
sec and 57 sec)...
the 57 second girl learned how to cube 2 or 3 weeks ago...a guy that learned 
last week did a 1:12 on the stackmat today...

Many of the fast cube people at the school are sophomores and juniors, so we 
would definitely
be competitive next year in a School Cup contest....

Seems like your Java is not installed properply. Goto
http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.jsp to
check your java version. Upgrade it to the latest.
This usually happens when if a application is written
for java 1.4 for example and you use java 1.3 to run
it and 1.3 dosent understand some features of 1.4 so
it gets confused:)

And about the main class error i think you have to
give a path to your java installation files- its
called the classpath. Check the documentation. 

Do tell us when you solve your problem so that we all
can learn.

Bye.

switched to mac os x (running 10.4.1) and I can&#x27;t get jnetcube to

Yes, r2U2r2(Uu)2r2u2 alone. Just do it before the PLL. Or use (Uu)2 
(Rr)2 U2 r2 U2 (Rr)2 (Uu)2. If you really end up with it last, try to 
use one of these embedded in setup-moves (only 2 are needed).

If you do this before you permute the LL, there is no harm doing (Uu)2
instead of u2 to finish.

I made quick videos that hopefully show how I would perform each of
these sequences of moves:

http://www.cubewhiz.com/videos/fsc/FSC-RUR&#x27;U.avi

For R U R&#x27; U&#x27;, I hold the cube with my thumb on bottom and my first
three fingers on the top of the cube.  I use my wrist to turn the . 
As the cube begins to become lined up, I use my pointer to push the U,
and continue to turn my wrist in the opposite direction for the R&#x27;. 
Meanwhile, my right middle finger heads to the back of the cube to
prepare for the last turn.  As that R&#x27; is finishing, I use my right
middle finger for the final U.

http://www.cubewhiz.com/videos/fsc/FSC-R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;.avi

This is done similarly, except I use my thumb to push the second U&#x27;,
and I grip the cube differently.  I would start with my right index on
the top of the cube, my middle and ring fingers on the back, and my
pinky just below the cube.  My thumb would be covering the top right
square of the front face.

(DivX is required to view both videos).  I didn&#x27;t have a cameraman to
help me out, so you have to translate the angle to first person on
your own.

I would just practice those shortcuts over and over so that they
become more natural.  Try to really concentrate on letting your
fingers do exactly what they have to.  First go slowly, then gradually
pick up some speed.  I&#x27;m sure others could offer better advice for
this, though.

Do

Use a stiffer cube ;-). Or a well-lubed Meffert assembly cube, that 
one will teach you to become precise (either that or it&#x27;ll make you 
mad).

Sorry, this is actually not completely correct. At first, I was
thinking of the wrong FSC.  I hold the cube with index and middle
fingers on the top and ring finger in the back.  I made the first U
turn with my ring finger, not the middle finger.

Whoops!  I mean second U with my ring finger, not the first.  Watch
the video! :)

You are very welcome! :)

I taught my little sister and took a video of her solving.  Her best
is 8.04 after about 30 minutes of practice.  She LOVES it, but I broke
the Magic she was using it and she can&#x27;t practice until I get a new
one.  Check it out :)

Hi Justin

You need to take the core apart, IMO.  

The core is a modified 3x3x3, but DON&#x27;T try to disassemble by 
levering out an &quot;edge&quot; piece.  The edges are shaved right down, and 
are so thin that they get chewed up badly if you try to lever them 
out.

In the middle of the &quot;3x3x3&quot; centres you&#x27;ll see the flat heads of 3 
pins.  Gently lever these up, but DON&#x27;T remove any other pieces until 
all 3 pins are removed.  (If you DO remove the edges surrounding a 
centre, it may crack when you lever out the pin -- the centres are 
also thin and fragile.) 

Once you&#x27;ve removed the 3 pins, disassembly is easy. 
Reasssembly is much easier than disassembly -- you won&#x27;t need 
instructions. :)

Hope this helps.

Mike

          <div class="email-content">You can run the jar file directly on mac osx, you don&#x27;t need to do it  
from the terminal - My problem was that I didn&#x27;t have the right JRE

set JRE 5.0 to be first priority over JRE 1.4.2. After that just

out minutes after I responded to the previous post.

Thanks man, i&#x27;ve always wanted something like this. At
first i didnt mean what u meant by &quot;on the fly&quot; but
after going to ur site i fully understood its meaning.
For the uninitiated, this applet (or favlet as u call
it) will generate Java cubes for any algo--u just
select the algo and then run the favlet -- then u get
a nice cube which u can drag anywhere u like. 

Keep up the good work :)

Well, maybe not. Sliced bread is pretty cool. What I
made is called a favelet, it&#x27;s a program so small it
fits in your browsers address bar. I created one that
shows a rubikplayer applet for any selected algorithm
on the page. So for all the guys who created pages
with tons of applets, no need for that anymore. Now
anyone can create the applets on the fly while
browsing.
 
You can read more and &#x27;download&#x27; it at
http://www.vanderblonk.com/cube/favelet/index.htm
 
If you cannot wait and know how this works, here is
the code. Remember it must remain one line.
 
javascript:d=document;if (d.getElementById(&#x27;frubik&#x27;))
showRubikApplet(); else {
z=document.getElementsByTagName(&#x27;head&#x27;)[0].appendChild(document.createElement(&#x27;script&#x27;));z.setAttribute(&#x27;src&#x27;,&#x27;http://vanderblonk.com/cube/favelet/frubik.js&#x27;);z.setAttribute(&#x27;type&#x27;,&#x27;text/javascript&#x27;);z.setAttribute(&#x27;id&#x27;,&#x27;frubik&#x27;)};
void(0);
 
And here is the code for a simpler version that can
also work offline, provided you have the applet
 
javascript:(function() { var
d=document;a=d.createElement(&#x27;applet&#x27;);a.code=&#x27;ch.randelshofer.rubik.RubikPlayerApp.class&#x27;;a.codebase=&#x27;http://www.randelshofer.ch/rubikplayer/&#x27;;a.archive=&#x27;rubikplayer.jar&#x27;;alg=d.createElement(&#x27;param&#x27;);alg.name=&#x27;script&#x27;;alg.value=d.selection.createRange().text;lang=d.createElement(&#x27;param&#x27;);lang.name=&#x27;scriptLanguage&#x27;;lang.value=&#x27;HarrisENG&#x27;;a.appendChild(alg);a.appendChild(lang);d.body.appendChild(a);

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
After demonstrating you my favelet <br>
(http://vanderblonk.com/cube/favelet/index.htm) I realized it showed <br>
the cube after a scramble. I think it&#x27;s more interesting if it shows <br>
by default how the algorithm solves the cube. That&#x27;s in the case of <br>
PLL/OLL pages etc. So I changed the favelet.<br>
<br>
For something like the sunday/xday contest you still need the original <br>
one. I am working on making multiple versions of the favelet available <br>
and working out a way of making it configurable. <br>
<br>
I have to remind you that the program is hosted. That means even <br>
though it looks like it&#x27;s on your PC it gets downloaded on every <br>
invocation and I can change it anytime (scary huh?).<br>

http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/foo/paper_cap.jpg<br>
Michel Bechtatou once suggested to use paper pieces to fix the 3x3 <br>
center caps. I *hate* glue. I have used the hammer method and can live <br>
with it. But this paper method is now my favourite, it does the least <br>
damage. The cross shape I use now is great, when you push down the cap <br>
then the paper will slide inside perfectly. It does raise the cap <br>
slightly but that might actually be good because if you&#x27;ve played with <br>
a cube for a while you might notice that the centers move inside a bit <br>
because both they and the edges polish each other at the connection.<br>
<br>
http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/foo/scratch_identifiers.jpg<br>
I scratch the color of the cubie into the center piece and I mark both <br>
the piece and the cap with a line that must then matched. This way I <br>
can always put everything back exactly the way it was (I consider this <br>
to be important because no two parts are ever the same). Helps for <br>
example if you want to keep all caps off and twist the and adjust the <br>
tensions.<br>

A box I made from polystyrol sheet. I need more for a semi-secret <br>

losing the overview, which cube is which, what have I done to it, <br>
where are its original springs etc.<br>
<br>
http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/foo/studio3x3_fix.jpg<br>
What I now do to Studio 3x3s. Two washers at each end of the spring. <br>
Each washer has one side with a more rounded rim and let all round <br>
sides point into the cube. The innermost washer makes the center cubie <br>
hole bottom flat. The next one reduces the friction. The outer two <br>
also reduce friction, but mainly I need so many because the spring is <br>
quite short if fully compressed.<br>

(I had bought them for Megaminx which has larger holes). They&#x27;re 0.8mm 
thick but that doesn&#x27;t really matter much, I just say it for

row. With 6mm it would probably *not* fit into the 3x3, so I was lucky 
(I had bought them for Megaminx which has larger holes). They&#x27;re 0.8mm 
thick but that doesn&#x27;t really matter much, I just say it for 
completeness.

Cheers!

Uh, too many negations for me... but what I think is: If you have 
large screw heads (or large washers right under them) and appropriate 
springs, or if you use very weak springs, then they don&#x27;t pop (unless 
you really want to or are a really terrible cuber ;-)

That&#x27;s pretty crazy stuff - I thought maybe you were juggling all 3 at once and just solving 
them as they came round into one hand (I guess left judging by the video) though. 
Then you&#x27;d be solving all 3 at once, intertwined so to speak.
Not sure how hard that would be... or if you could get many twists in at once.

I think I could do that. And to top it off, I&#x27;d do it underwater!

          <div class="email-content">Hi!<br>
<br>
I just recently receive a missing link puzle that i bought off eBay. <br>
After 2 days i have had some rather nice achievements.<br>
<br>
I started off by working out a nice method, while having a look <br>
around what methods exist out there. I found actually only one which <br>
was writen down in some detail. This method i found on Jaap&#x27;s site <br>
and solves the puzzle column by column.<br>
<br>
The method im currently using involves following steps<br>
<br>
- trickle down all the tiles to go in first row and place them at <br>
bottom ... this should be faitly intuitive i hope ... make sure u do <br>
ALL 4 bottom tiles before proceed or u are in a bit of trouble<br>
<br>
- now turn the middle 2 rows (they won&#x27;t turn individually though) <br>
so as to put as many tiles as possible into solved or good <br>
positions ... a good position is typically in it&#x27;s correct column<br>
<br>
- now u actually have some freedom in how u proceed .. either <br>
complete column by column (leave white for last) ... or u can do <br>
sorta row by row ... basically u solve the tiles that u spot first <br>
so as not to waste time ... when placing a tile into 2nd row from <br>
bottom u can always lift a column (i leave it to urselves to work <br>
out how) and then solve the tile and lower the column back<br>
<br>
- after having finished all tiles in the 2nd row almost all activity <br>
takes place in 2 top rows ... solving 3rd row is trivial ...<br>
<br>
- so final step is dealing w the last row .. there are five cases <br>
only u should know .. i have easy solutions for all of them ... only <br>
one case involves dealing with lifting a column ... this case is <br>
where if white column in front and the empty slot is also in front u <br>
have to swap the left and right top tile only ... then u have to put <br>
the tile in 3rd row from bottom in the column opposite to white into <br>
the 2nd row in that column (u know how already) ... doing that <br>
correctly and simply the puzzle is now solved<br>
<br>
I will post all these 5 last layer algs once i have worked out a <br>
good notation and made some diagrams :-)<br>
<br>
For those who don&#x27;t know the missing link puzzle looks like here is <br>
a link :<br>
<br>
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/missing.htm<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d like some feedback on this method. Any others here know how to <br>
solve the missing link and use other methods? I would also like some <br>
competion cause i have already posted good times for single solve <br>
and average. Check of course at :<br>
<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_other_puzzles.html<br>
<br>
This turned out to be a rather long post. Thx for ur time :-)<br>
<br>
Kind regards,<br>

*WOW*

But don&#x27;t you never drop cubes? Even you, you can&#x27;t avoid collisions
to happen?... How many broken cubes? ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi:<br>
I&#x27;m new to this forum so decided to break the ice with a question. <br>
While many speed cubists will refer to corner&#x27;s first in passing as <br>
one of the speed cubing solutions, I have not seen solutions based on <br>
it recently. I learned to put the cube together using a corner&#x27;s first <br>
framework years ago and I&#x27;m now trying to improve my time with this <br>
methodology. I&#x27;m now averaging about 70sec, with personal best in the <br>
50s. <br>
<br>
So my question at this point is if it&#x27;s worth pursuing faster times <br>
using this methodology or has it been proven to be suboptimal, in <br>
which case I should scrap it and try to relearn Fridrick or Peterus. I <br>
have not yet learned any finger moves as of yet; I now put the corners <br>
together using Petrus&#x27;s Niklas/Sune combos; and my edge solutions are <br>
similar to that in http://cube.misto.cz/_MAIL_/cfsm.html.<br>
<br>
I think I can significantly increase my edge time (about 40 sec) with <br>
more stronger algorithms but haven&#x27;t seen much in this area lately. <br>
Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.<br>

Will you then generate a picture of the world showing a little point 
for each cuber? Or better: An applet that shows you the name when you 
put the mouse cursor over a point and displays further info (like 
Dan&#x27;s profiles) when you click on it. That&#x27;d be sweet...

Cheers!
Stefan

I&#x27;m doubtful that this has ever been proved, and /suspect/ that the 
current dominance of the layer-by-layer approach is largely a &quot;social&quot; 
phenomenon.  

You would not be in bad company in pursuing corners-first. It&#x27;s known 
that Marc Waterman achieved very fast times with a (complex) corners-
first system.  For details (probably you&#x27;ve already looked), see 

http://rubikscube.info/

Note also that the majority of competitors in the 1982 world 
championship (including the Champion) used corners-first methods.  See

http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p4

Perhaps the dominance of corners-first in those days was similarly due 
to a &quot;social&quot; phenomenon.

The big &quot;problem&quot; with adopting a corners-first framework as a beginner 
nowadays is that you will have to think for yourself: with Fridrich, 
there are many websites from which you can select 
sequences/fingertricks; also, the majority of people who contribute on 
this forum will be familiar mainly with Fridrich, so a corner-starter 
won&#x27;t have so many people to talk to.  

Fridrich herself seems very open minded about this question.  She has 
stated that there may be many methods that could be as fast as hers 
when worked out to a sufficient level of &quot;perfection&quot; - see also her 
recent comments here

http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/16756
 
So, good luck with the corners -- and sorry that I&#x27;m too inexpert to 
help with the specifics of any approach, let alone corners-first.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I have a question about a section I&#x27;m adding to my webpage.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve already taken all the videos, I just need to get them onto my<br>
computer and edit them into separate clips, so almost all the work is<br>
done so far.<br>
<br>
Basically what this page will do is show you what a competition solve<br>
for speed, and for blindfolded solving, looks like.<br>
<br>
I did a complete mock-up of a competition solve, based on my<br>
experiences with how they go, and I filmed them.<br>
<br>
So there are 3 videos to watch:<br>
1) mock competition 3x3 speed solve<br>
- this includes a judge (many thanks to my girlfriend Becky for<br>
helping me out here :-), everything the judge says to you that you<br>
have to respond to, the timer, the 15 second inspection, everything. <br>
Also includes the fact that you have up to about 2 seconds after the<br>
judge removes the paper to re-focus on the cube before picking it up.<br>
 (I think the rules technically say 3, but I think it&#x27;s not a good<br>
idea to push this one).<br>
<br>
2) mock competition 3x3 BLD solve<br>
- I didn&#x27;t do the whole solve of course, I put the cube about two<br>
moves away from solved, but I show how the time starts, you picking up<br>
your cube, memorizing, putting on the blindfold, solving and stopping<br>
the timer.<br>
<br>
3) putting down the cube without dropping.<br>
- I heard people a lot of times at competitions talking about how they<br>
don&#x27;t know how to put their cube down at the end of the solve without<br>
droppping it.  Well I filmed this video from two different angles,<br>
from my point of view, and from someone watching&#x27;s point of view.  It<br>
shows how I bring the cube to the mat and let it go at the last<br>
second, so not technically a drop.  I have the approval of Tyson on<br>
this one, so it&#x27;s ok WCA wise.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m just curious if anyone here, who has not been to a competition but<br>
is considering going, would be interested?  I&#x27;m going to put it on my<br>
site, and I was curious if I could get some reviews both by people who<br>
have been, and haven&#x27;t been to one before.<br>
<br>
I will have the site done later today, but I just wanted to get an<br>
idea of whether or not people would be interested in this.<br>

I have never been to a competition, and would be very interested in 
the information mentioned here. I had no idea you couldn&#x27;t &quot;drop&quot; the 
cube at the end of the solve.  So that puts panic in my mind thinking 
I am doing many things that are wrong.  I would be happy to write a 
review for you once I have had a chance to view the work.

This is a great idea. Thanks, Chris.

I gotta say, the timer looks pretty shnazzy.  Any word on the retail
price and release date?  (I&#x27;m going back to read the details later,
don&#x27;t have much time right now.)

Nice work!

          <div class="email-content">Greetings dmacauley,

Welcome to the list.

Is &quot;Corners First&quot; suboptimal? I don&#x27;t think so.

I use a method which does 
1. two edges 
2. four corners 
3. six edges (done in pairs)
4. four corners
5. four edges
and on a good day I take around 30 seconds.

If I try &quot;corners first&quot; it take about 35 seconds.

So off hand I&#x27;d say that it looks like corners first is very good
approach.

I think that 2x2x2 practice can help a lot. Consider being able to
&quot;see&quot; the corner&#x27;s solution during the inspection time... I&#x27;ve played
a little at &quot;blindfold&quot; 2x2x2 with a best at 7 seconds.

Regards,
 
David J

Ian pressured me to finish the file.  As a result, I&#x27;m really hungry <br>
because I&#x27;ve been postponing dinner.  I&#x27;m sure my hunger will become <br>
evident towards the end of the tutorial.<br>
<br>
I guess I forgot to mention some permutaiton tricks, like if you&#x27;re <br>
cycling edges, you can do that on the U, F, D, or B faces, but I&#x27;ll add <br>
that in later after I get some dinner.<br>
<br>
And I forgot some other stuff... that&#x27;ll all get added in.  I think at <br>
this point, it should be possible to blindfold a cube by using the <br>
file.  Read it, let me know, suggestions if you&#x27;ve got them, and yeah, <br>
I&#x27;m hungry.<br>

After you inspect, the judge needs to ask you if you&#x27;re ready to solve <br>
and you need to acknowledge it.  That way, the competitor can&#x27;t claim <br>
&quot;oh, I wasn&#x27;t ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
Also, the &quot;3, 2, 1&quot; countdown after the inspection isn&#x27;t necessary.  <br>
I&#x27;ve been meaning to amend to rules so that the judge just has to say <br>
&quot;ready?  go.&quot;  And remember, after the judge says go, you have a second <br>
or two to refocus.<br>
<br>
And if there is any obvious delay, the judge kicks you in the bottom.<br>

  I gave a look at the site and it&#x27;s quite good.  I was never sure
exactly how the whole inspect-cover-uncover-solve thing went, it&#x27;s
nice to have a clear video.
  I do have 2 questions.  First, at the end of your solve, do you pick
up your cube, or does the judge have to hand it to you?  I thought I
read somewhere that the judge must hand it to you.  Second, is there
anywhere where the official rules are typed up?
  Thanks again, my girlfriend will be screening the videos tonight,
and henceforth training me in accordance with them ;) lucky her!

Hi Tyson,

you asked for it... ;-)

General: I&#x27;d appreciate it if you could at least mention that you 
describe only one method and that there are others as well. You say 
one solves two or three pieces at a time, I do one at a time. Not 
everybody does orientation and permutation separately. I never 
memorize with numbers, I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s very very unnatural and bad, 
maybe unless you&#x27;re Japanese and memorizing the sound of a number 
sequence is easy for you. There&#x27;s good reason the real memorizers 
memorize numbers not as numbers but as images. Numbers are so 
abstract. Finally, as some people have demonstrated, it&#x27;s indeed 
possible and not even hard (just takes long to plan the solution) to 
solve the cube blindfolded using your regular speedsolving method.

Wrong effects for your corner orientation algs. Particularly you 
always say top/bottom when you really mean front/back (Or back/front? 
I&#x27;m completely confused). Also it could be better to name all three 
faces to describe a corner, not just two, but it coul be clear from 
context once you fix the other issue.

About the powerful corner orientation method: I think the R&#x27; is not 
outstanding, it&#x27;s part of the single-corner-orientation. Do the other 
six moves alone on a solve cube and it will just look confusing. Also, 
I highly recommend (you write this for beginners, right?) to *always* 
add the D-turn, this way you never have to think whether to do it or 
not, you just always do it. Examples of what I&#x27;d do:

(R&#x27; D R D&#x27; R&#x27; D R D&#x27;) U&#x27; (D R&#x27; D&#x27; R D R&#x27; D&#x27; R) U

(R&#x27; D R D&#x27; R&#x27; D R D&#x27;) U&#x27; (R&#x27; D R D&#x27; R&#x27; D R D&#x27;) U&#x27; (R&#x27; D R D&#x27; R&#x27; D R 
D&#x27;) U2

You could also mention that one can orient all four corners as well. 
And that the overall orientation must be a multiple of three (in 
clockwise rotations). I get the feeling you describe algorithms 
derived with the method but not the method itself clearly, which is a 
pity. It could also make the text quite a bit shorter. Maybe simply 
show that (R&#x27; D R D&#x27; R&#x27; D R D&#x27;) and (D R&#x27; D&#x27; R D R&#x27; D&#x27; R) rotate the 
URF corner that you do them several times, to different corners, which 
you select by U-turns between the single-corner-rotations. Then show 
some instantiations (algorithms) of the general method.

And how about orienting corners in the D layer instead of U? Do 
Macky/Leyan really do it the way you described? Try this, it&#x27;s much 
faster (and also easier because one makes fewer mistakes when using 
fingertricks):

(R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) D (U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27;) D&#x27;

(R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) D (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) D (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) 
D2

You say &quot;always remember that I&#x27;m not right&quot;. Don&#x27;t be so mean to 
yourself ;-)

An easier way to find out whether an edge is badly oriented: I say 
white/yellow are brightest, green/blue are darkest and orange/red are 
medium. This way each edge has a brighter and a darker sticker. An 
edge is correctly oriented iff its brighter sticker is on the brighter 
face (defined by the centers). Just this single rule.

I think &quot;flip&quot; is better than &quot;switch&quot; to describe the effect of edge 
orientation algs.

Corner permutation: Same top/bottom vs front/back confusion again.

Typo in (L F&#x27; L B2 L&#x27; F&#x27; L B2 L2).

&quot;This is very similar to Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s blindfold method&quot;. Hmm... 
as much as I like my solution being referenced, I&#x27;d say this is not 
correct. I do use the T-perm, yes, but that&#x27;s all the similarity. We 
use it for quite different purposes. So I&#x27;d like to ask you to remove 
the reference, please. Btw, you got the T-perm wrong ;-) And the edge 
crosser, too... Oh, and if you know the F-perm or N-perm you can use 
those, too. Any perm that swaps two opposite edges. Or two adjacent 
but you need to do it for both perms of course. But since it&#x27;s a 
beginner tutorial I&#x27;d not demonstrate this in detail, just (if at all) 
mention it. It could improve the understanding and if someone knows 
the other perms already it might help to make blindsolving even 
easier.

Some suggestions you maybe already have in mind for the rest of the 
document:
- Suggest to solve using the blindfold method but without wearing a 
blindfold. At least until they get it right.
- Suggest to scramble two cubes the same way. Then do one step to the 
first cube and make sure you got it right by comparing it to the 
other, which still shows the cube state right before the step. Then do 
the step to the other cube and make sure both cubes look the same 
again.
- Link to the other solutions on the web and to the blindsolving yahoo 
group.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,<br>
<br>
thanks a lot (though I personally don&#x27;t need it anymore unless I&#x27;m a <br>
judge for a newbie ;-), that&#x27;s a very good idea. Some comments and <br>
corrections, though:<br>
<br>
The Timer<br>
---------<br>
<br>
Hmm, I&#x27;ve seen Katsu place the hands on the timer this way, but I <br>
myself don&#x27;t, I put my fingers on the contacts. Otherwise you could <br>
cheat (even unintentionally) when picking up the cube, especially with <br>
the Stackmat 2. Also, maybe describe the procedure, particularly what <br>
the lights mean.<br>
<br>
<br>
Putting the cube down<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
I think if you show it that slowly only, that&#x27;s no use. With that <br>
speed, any method of holding the cube will work. A suggestion would be <br>
to lower your hands (probably better the whole body) close to the <br>
surface during the last solution step. And you could link to Macky&#x27;s <br>
12.11 solve, it looks very good how he puts down the cube and I doubt <br>
he grips the bottom of the cube like you describe. Btw, besides the <br>
risk of penalty, you should mention how mean it is to the poor cube if <br>
you throw it down, it might even break (and not only out in tears).<br>
<br>
<br>
The solve and competition procedure<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
<br>
1+2) This is only correct for the first attempt in a round. Well, <br>
unless Americans do it differently. At the competitions I&#x27;ve been to <br>
we were usually packed into groups of 4 or 8 people and we didn&#x27;t get <br>
our cubes back between the solves of a round.<br>
<br>
8) I&#x27;d recommend not getting too close to the limit here, either, <br>
because you might get interrupted during analysis and lose track. <br>
Also, I always count in my head (starting at 0, not at 10) so I have a <br>
better feeling how much time is left.<br>
<br>
10) Not getting too close might also be important if as judge you get <br>
one of those people who start counting at 1 instead of 0. You know, <br>
some people count &quot;1..2..3&quot; and thus actually only measure 2 seconds. <br>
Maybe cubers are more intelligent, but I&#x27;ve seen it in real life. <br>
Also, like Tyson already mentioned, the judge should again ask you <br>
whether you&#x27;re ready before he starts the countdown. That is, unless <br>
you&#x27;ve clearly instructed him otherwise beforehand, e.g. that you will <br>
be ready and that he shouldn&#x27;t ask whether you are and maybe not even <br>
count down again but just cover the cube and take it away after the <br>
timer is ready (i.e. second light is on). Not sure whether this is in <br>
the rules but as a judge I was requested to do it this way once and I <br>
don&#x27;t see a problem with it.<br>
<br>
12) The cube must be flat on the table? I think it would be ok if it <br>
stays on a corner. Or if it drops to the floor of the podium and then <br>
to the floor below the podium (as happened with some 5x5s at the <br>
German Open... ouch ;-).<br>
<br>
12.5) This step is missing (also in the video). The judge inspects <br>
your cube, looks whether it&#x27;s correctly solved and whether a penalty <br>
is needed. Btw, with Rubik&#x27;s Clock it&#x27;s particularly irritating to <br>
hear the crowd cheer before anybody has checked the back side (which <br>
has really caused many disqualifications).<br>
<br>
14) Unless the judge takes your cube with him/her for your next <br>
scramble. And you can also switch to a different cube if you want to.<br>
<br>
The video: I believe you only hold the cube with your left hand when <br>
putting it down. Baaad example ;-)<br>
<br>
<br>
Blindfolded solving procedure<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<br>
2) I wouldn&#x27;t be so strict about wearing it from the start unless <br>
you&#x27;re solving only a 3x3 or so ;-)<br>
<br>
5) When you put the cube down for putting on the blindfold, be sure <br>
you don&#x27;t accidentally stop the timer! I&#x27;ve almost done this myself <br>
once or twice, because the procedure is so similar to speedsolving. <br>
You inspect/memorize, then put the cube down, then (*), then pick up <br>
the cube and solve it. In speedsolving you touch the timer at (*) and <br>
in blindsolving you must not! It&#x27;s also important during the solve, e.<br>
g. if you put the cube down for a moment to relax or whatever, and <br>
when you try to pick it up again you could accidentally stop the <br>
timer. Remember it&#x27;s very sensitive.<br>
<br>
7) It&#x27;s the job of the judge, *not* the solver, to check whether the <br>
solve was successful. Do *not* touch the cube before the judge did it.<br>
<br>
The video: You put your hands down on the mat before and after putting <br>
on the blindfold. Not a good example I think, even though you don&#x27;t <br>
get near the timer contacts.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

Ok, if you do accidentally stop the timer, that&#x27;s still not the end of 
the world, since that&#x27;s one reason why the judges always stop the time 
with an additional stopwatch.

(uh, even though I seem to say these things to you (Chris) I guess you 
know I know you know them, they just could be said in your tutorial)

Cheers!
Stefan

Actually, have a look at the official WCA world rankings for 3x3 
blindfold or for 5x5. You can see times exceeding 10 minutes. Since 
the stackmats (at least generation 1) stop counting after 10 minutes, 
these are probably from the judges and their stopwatches... are they 
all invalid now?

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, unfortunately we can&#x27;t.  Especially if your time is superb and <br>
even more especially if your solve is a world record.  We can&#x27;t have <br>
the world record time with inaccurate means.  Fortunately, in the <br>
thousands of solves that I&#x27;ve watched over, I&#x27;ve only seen the timer <br>
fail once.<br>
<br>
These things happen, and there&#x27;s nothing we can really do about it.  <br>
Any other timing method would not be in accordance of the regulation <br>
and really wouldn&#x27;t be fair.  Also, how do we decide what&#x27;s a &quot;superb&quot; <br>
solve and an absolute junk solve?<br>
<br>
Chris, when you refilm this video, maybe you could have Becky not time <br>
you during the actual solve.  It&#x27;s how things should be done.<br>
<br>
Exceptions for stopwatch timing occur for events that are expected to <br>
last over 10 minutes.  At those time scales, the error in human judging <br>
is smaller.  .2 is a big deal at the 15 second level but not that big <br>
of a deal at the 15 minute level, and for most of our events, if you&#x27;re <br>
solving it in 15 minutes, it&#x27;s not going to be a world record.<br>
<br>
I will work on asking StackMat to adjust their timers so that they do <br>
not shut off after 10 minutes.  In the mean time, did you know that the <br>
timing of solar system object observations with the Very Large Array <br>
need to be timed so that you have the array in the right configuration?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Ok I fixed the main videos, the mockup 3x3 solves.  I ran them by<br>
Tyson and I have the WCA stamp of approval for correctness of the<br>
procedure, what the judge says, when the competitor speaks, etc..<br>
<br>
I also fixed the description of the procedure on my page.<br>
<br>
Also, thanks all for the detailed responses.<br>
<br>
In particular Stefan, I didn&#x27;t realize that I never actually use both<br>
hands to bring the cube to the mat, but I thought I did!  That&#x27;s<br>
really weird, I always though I used both hands but after doing some<br>
speedsolves and really paying attention to that step I always do it<br>
with one hand!<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve already refilmed all the videos for putting the cube down, but I<br>
have to go through and edit them into small downloadable clips.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s really late, so I&#x27;ll do that tomorrow.<br>
<br>
But, the main 3x3 mock solves are corrected and can be used safely for<br>
preparing yourself for a competition solve.<br>

P.S.  I&#x27;ll also add some stuff about how the stackmats work in a text<br>
description, but right now I need sleep.  Ok, enjoy the page, and keep<br>

&gt; And how about orienting corners in the D layer instead of U? Do <br>
&gt; Macky/Leyan really do it the way you described? Try this, it&#x27;s much <br>
&gt; faster (and also easier because one makes fewer mistakes when using <br>
&gt; fingertricks):<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; (R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) D (U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27;) D&#x27;<br>

U&#x27;) <br>
&gt; D2<br>
<br>
I turn the cube with z&#x27;. So now the corner twister is R and U, and <br>
the layer move is L.<br>
<br>
&gt; An easier way to find out whether an edge is badly oriented: I say <br>
&gt; white/yellow are brightest, green/blue are darkest and orange/red <br>
are <br>
&gt; medium. This way each edge has a brighter and a darker sticker. An <br>
&gt; edge is correctly oriented iff its brighter sticker is on the <br>
brighter <br>
&gt; face (defined by the centers). Just this single rule.<br>
<br>
Not if you&#x27;re using blue-opposite-white!<br>

Ok, that&#x27;s even better :-) But why the cube rotation?

And why not say so in your tutorial? I&#x27;m convinced using finger tricks 
also makes it easier, not only faster.

Only sickos use that.

Hi,

I use this alg to solve 9 pairs of edge at once :

L&#x27; F&#x27; U (Rr)&#x27; (Dd)&#x27; D&#x27; U&#x27; R U D R&#x27; (Dd) (Rr) 

9 pairs is a max, 8 more often.
The first 3 moves don&#x27;t touch the edge-pair, but it&#x27;s an help to
preposition them.

Cool algorithm!
But how do you easily set up this 9 cycle? And what if there is a 5 cycle 
instead of a 9 cycle?

Have fun,

Mmh, I remember this one, too, but I think I&#x27;ve seen a different one. 
I may be wrong, of course, but I think I&#x27;ve seen a scan of a printed 
interview (2 pages?), including a picture.

But thanks a lot for that link. I recently had a look at articles at 
rubiks.com and found a summary of this one. But only a summary.

He came pretty close to saying that... &quot;difficult, if not physically

I have been trying to shoot a good 4x4x4 speedsolving video today. <br>
It&#x27;s not easy to find a good angle for the webcam. And it&#x27;s a bit <br>
awkward to have to think of showing the cube for the cam while i <br>
solve. So i didn&#x27;t manage my topspeed. But at least i did manage a <br>
1:13.97 solve while shooting.<br>
<br>
As you can see im not using the usual pairing-up. My method is ... <br>
umm .... arguably more intuitive. Sort of layer by layer if u like. <br>
I call theis the &quot;cage&quot; method since the cube looks indeed like a <br>

Good, so I&#x27;m not making this up :-) I remember seeing it on 
speedcubing.com, too. But I&#x27;ve already searched using the google 
search function and searching manually through the news pages but 
didn&#x27;t find it...

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

Very nice solve. I could see the cube well - good distance.

If you do another one, I would like to see all six sides of the cube
both before and after it is solved.

The only &quot;better angle&quot; that I can think of right of is if you shot it
with a mirror placed strategically. However, that might be distracting.

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Actually, I&#x27;ve thought about this before, but do not have the
necessary equipment to go through with the idea.  I was thinking that
if you could get multiple cameras set up at different angles, then you
could put them together on the computer in 4 different quadrants.  For
instance, you have one from the cubers perspective, one below pointing
up, one from the right side, and one from the upper-back-left (if that
makes sense).  If the cameras were positioned properly, then you
wouldnt be able to see the other cameras in the shot.

I think it would be great for analyzing someone&#x27;s technique, but like
I said, it requires a bit more resources than most people have.  It
would be fun to watch though!

I also went through the news archive, and wonder if you are thinking of 
the scans of Ideal Toys Rubik&#x27;s Cube newsletter, which were on Ton&#x27;s 
page, version of 8 May 04 (scroll to bottom of page):

http://web.archive.org/web/20040622142627/www.speedcubing.com/ton/Archiv
e/News2004_8.htm

I looked through them very quickly last night, but didn&#x27;t notice any 
actual interview in there.

Was it a relatively recent interview?

Yes that would be really cool. However Yuki Hayashi has a really 
fast 3x3x3 solve recorded on his site :

http://www.geocities.jp/n_wota/cube/video/fastest01.mpg

This seems to me to be a practiced solve ;-) But still it&#x27;s really 
really impressive. As far as i can see he solves the cube in 
something like 9.5 - 10.0 secs. Even for a practised solve this is 
really good. This is equivalent to about 4 moves/sec or more. It&#x27;s 
really lucky fridrich solve if it&#x27;s less than 40 moves required ;-)

Cheers!

That direct link won&#x27;t work. So u have to go first here :

http://www.geocities.jp/n_wota/cube/

Then it&#x27;s the Katsu Method video. Check out his other cool videos. 
There are some awesome 4x4x4 vids too (pairing-up method).

Some vids are on his temp page :

Ah, thanks, Rune.  I would not have seen that article myself, as I 
never looked at the WC03 site at the time.  (Thai did say something 
similar in the &quot;Rubiks&quot; interview anyway.)

I&#x27;d say not. You&#x27;re not supposed to make notes so equally you shouldn&#x27;t be able to read 
anything. If you read something then you&#x27;re not really solving without sight, plus that 
totally differentiates it from blindfold solving where you wouldn&#x27;t be able to read anything.

San Clemente High School&#x27;s Cuber&#x27;s Club just held a competition! We currently have 12 people at our school who I know can solve the cube, and 6 of the fastest competed. We even got to eat a Rubik&#x27;s cake! Understand that most of the competitors have only been cubing for a month, so hopefully the times will be lower by the next competition. Since I was the host and judge of the competition, I did not participate. Obviously, this wasn&#x27;t an official WCA competition, but I hope to bring a few friends to a Caltech competition soon (I&#x27;d love to go to the Dallas tourney, but I don&#x27;t think I can go.) I&#x27;ve attached the results, and wanted to know if there is a simple way for me to post all of the results on speedcubing.com, rather than one at a time (though it wouldn&#x27;t be that difficult.) People just love to see their names online.<br>
<br>
This was the first meeting for San Clemente High School&#x27;s Cuber&#x27;s Club, I hope to get a website running soon, and I&#x27;ll post some pictures. I&#x27;d also love any advice you would give to someone starting a Rubik&#x27;s cube club.<br>

          <div class="email-content">By following the 9-cycle, you have the first 4 pairs in the same 
layer. Consider it like the D layer ( made as a cross) .
The 4 next pairs are in the middle layer ( by analogy the F2L step).

And the last pair is in the U layer.
This alg leaves the last 3 pairs in U layer unsolved.

If you have 5-cycle by example, nevermind. Continue the preposition 
with an other cycle.
Just you loose one pair. Most of the time, my alg leaves 4 pairs 
unsolved. If I loose one pair (it&#x27;s an unlucky case), you have 5 
pairs unsolved.

But 4 or 5 pairs unsolved is the same (about).

I try to calculate the probabilities  :  having a cycle of minumum 9 
pairs is possible most of the time, and it is not very important if 
you loose one pair.


Have fun,

Haha, reminds me of something... I once taught a friend of mine how to 
solve it (with a 14-move solution) and he was able to solve it in 
about 25 seconds on average. One day I &quot;scrambled&quot; it for him just by 
changing a center clock by a single hour. He was so afraid to destroy 
anything that after two minutes of basically doing nothing he gave up 
I think (maybe he proceeded to solve it from scratch, but I don&#x27;t 
remember anymore).

Cheers!
Stefan

Yes, I think for example it mentioned his current job and his family. 
But thanks for reminding me about that old newsletter, hadn&#x27;t read

<br>

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s really too bad I wasn&#x27;t able to pull off the competition before the school year ended, it would be a lot easier to gauge the school&#x27;s interest in cubing. I know that there are at least three dedicated cubers who plan on learning more algorithms; while others may not be interested in knowing more than how to solve the cube. By October, if everything goes to plan, everyone at San Clemente will want to go to an official competition! Seriously though, I hope to bring four people (myself included) to a Caltech competition in Pasadena. And hopefully, the same group will go to the 2006 Nationals. I believe there is some real untapped talent at my high school, and I hope to have some very fast cubers for the coming school year.<br>
 <br>
Oh, and thaiguy20fromLA, don&#x27;t &quot;wish that my middle school had a competition,&quot; instead, hold your own to kick off a new club! I&#x27;m amazed at how interested people are in learning how to solve a Rubik&#x27;s cube. Just today, when I took a cube out of my pocket and did a 51 second solve, two people came up and asked me to teach them how to solve it this summer (and of course, I will.) As I&#x27;ve seen many people say, cubing is going through a revival of sorts, and we can help spread it like a virus!<br>

I think it was more like a normal interview (not an email interview in 
which Minh repeats all questions before answering, and it had a 
picture I believe).

alas, I havn´t!

If you say that because of blindsolving: I can only remember things 
that well if I actively store them in memory, but my normal memory 
isn&#x27;t different from yours. Anyone could do these blindsolve things. 
Actually I&#x27;m for example very bad at remembering quotes from movies 
(I&#x27;m always amazed how well others can do this, right when we come out 
of the cinema and they talk about quotes and things and I don&#x27;t 
remember them anymore) and often I forget the ending of a movie, which 
isn&#x27;t that bad because then I can be somewhat surprised again when I 
watch it again :-).

Cheers!
Stefan

The alg I found with Acube is:
L U L&#x27; U R&#x27; U  L U R U R&#x27; U R L&#x27;
which I do as

(L U L&#x27;) (U) (R&#x27; U) L (U) [(R U R&#x27; U) R] L&#x27;

Again, personally for my hands this RUL alg is MUCH better than the
other one, but I know that the &quot;regular&quot; alg is also fast.  Just not
for my hands :-D

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

If I don&#x27;t want to change where the corners are and just reorient them
I use 11 moves: 
R U2 R2 U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R2 U2 R
which is probably well known.

Your COLL reverses the LL corner positions. For that CLL I do 10 moves: 
R&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U R
  
I call that corner permutation &quot;barrow&quot; because it reminds me a wheel
barrow.

Regards,

David J

Hi Macky,

You wrote: &quot;Solving a Rubik&#x27;s Cube blindfolded is not difficult. At 
all! All we need is a fairly good short-term memory and the 
persistence to learn the method.&quot;

Maybe you should add the parenthetical remark:

&quot;Solving a Rubik&#x27;s Cube blindfolded is not difficult. At all! (If 
you take the time to memorize it properly!) All we ...&quot;

because if you try to go really fast it is quite possible to start 
the resolution before you&#x27;ve actually properly committed the 
starting position to memory. That&#x27;s especially true if you&#x27;re racing 
other people. But it&#x27;s certainly true that if you just want to be 
able to solve a cube blindfolded then it isn&#x27;t at all difficult. 
I&#x27;ll agree with you 100% on that.

Your link near the bottom (http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/%
20Richard/BlindfoldRevenge.pdf) doesn&#x27;t seem to work. Looks like it 
is because of the extra space: %20. 
http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Richard/BlindfoldRevenge.pdf 
would be the correct link.
That&#x27;s an old document, a beginner method - I guess you could use 
this intermediate method one instead:

http://www.math.columbia.edu/~carr/BCFTSS.pdf

This is also not a great document but it is a little better - in 
particular, I never really wrote a good section on memorization and 
it&#x27;s not as in-depth as it might be. If I ever finish the advanced 
method it will be much better (and take far fewer moves on average).

As far as I know, BCFTSS is the only method that gives an exact 
expected number of moves for solution (assuming non-cancellation 
between stages which I really didn&#x27;t want to go into).

Some observations - I&#x27;ll admit that I haven&#x27;t read it all, so maybe 
these are uninformed!

i) Cycle Decomposition Algorithm 
1. Locate the smallest number that has not been written (the first 
time this number is 1).
     a. If such number exists, write down &quot;(&quot; and then that number.
     b. If all numbers have been written, stop.
2. Find the last number that was written. Determine to which spot 
this corner needs to be moved.
     a. If the number of this spot has not been written, write it 
down and repeat step 2.
     b. If the number of this spot has been written, write &quot;)&quot; to 
end the cycle. Go to step 1.

Just a small point: this seems to indicate that you are allowed to 
write stuff down. Surely that&#x27;s against the rules.

&quot;iii. Edge Permutation

Edge orientation is the hardest part of blindfold cubing&quot;
     ^^^^^^^^^^^

Actually, having written the below I realize you have discussed 
exactly what I am saying.

&quot;iv) ...&quot;

Just as a note - you could reduce to 4 corners and 4 edges to be 
cycled (and then solve with &quot;U&quot; for instance). In the cycle set up 
that would be easier perhaps. It&#x27;s immediately obvious whether you 
will need to do this stage if you are memorizing cycles and you 
could adjust the cycles mentally at the start to solve to the stage 
where you just need to do &quot;U&quot; at the end. This would result in a 
much faster resolution at the end. (Those skills are necessary 
anyway, if you want to be able to learn to blindfold solve from one 
given scrambled position to another.)

Haha, you&#x27;re quite right. I&#x27;ll add that with &quot;(Richard Carr

My apologies for the mistake. I&#x27;ll fix the first and 
add this new link as well. 
This is quite an impressive collection of algorithms, 
plus theory for Megaminx! Cool stuff.
I also rewrote the cubie names according to your &quot;U&lt;D&lt;F&lt;B&lt;R&lt;L.&quot;

Right. I added, &quot;In official attempts, writing down or reading 
anything is not permitted. 
However, using a piece of paper to write down the needed information 
for each step is 
a good practice when first working with cycles.&quot;

I was writing about doing U at the beginning of the solve, but 
you&#x27;re right,
you could modify the cycles just as easily to do U at the end. I&#x27;ll
also add a sentence about that.

Much thanks,
Macky

Hey Mr. Akimoto,

I really like the reverse of this move, I had never though to try it
until you mentioned it.

(R U R&#x27; U) L&#x27; U R U (L U L&#x27; U L) R&#x27;

I really like the reverse better than the way I posted it.

I like your CLL alg too, I&#x27;ll have to try to learn that for the 2x2.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, but I figured he wanted to know the absolute minimum. And it&#x27;s 
usually not too hard to remove the center caps, is it? I&#x27;d rather 
switch the stickers, though ;-). Not because it might be easier 
(depends on the cube) but because the caps are a semi-functional part 
and I always try to put everything back where it came from (that&#x27;s for 
example the reason I usually only remove one center at a time).

Cheers!

Hi! :-)

I haven&#x27;t seen those in any shops. I guess they went out of 
production quite early in the 1980&#x27;s. They are however appearing 
quite often on eBay. So i guess bidding for one there is ur best 
chance to get one :-)

Have fun !

          <div class="email-content">Hi James :-)<br>
<br>
For the 4x4x4 revenge/master cube i use the same system as i do for <br>
the 5x5x5 wahn/professor cube.<br>
<br>
The basic steps are as follows:<br>
<br>
(I call this the &quot;Cage&quot; method. )<br>
<br>
1. Do first layer completely. This is intuitive. If some centers <br>
are &quot;tricky&quot; to solve they can be left for later if so desired. <br>
basically i solve the cubies in the order i see them. Cubies that make <br>
up blocks are inserted into first layer as a block also, when possible.<br>
<br>
2. (First twist the middle layers into favorable positions. U can get <br>
quite a few edges and/or centers for free by doing this.) Now do <br>
middle layers edges. This is done by and large with commutator 3-<br>
cycles. Also here one can cycle blocks of cubies when solving them. <br>
Either to solve several edges at the same time or remove badly placed <br>
edges (move to final layer where i do most of the &quot;fishing&quot;) or move <br>
bad edges to a better position within the middle layers.<br>
<br>
3. Final layer corners. First position them (only 2 algs needed) then <br>
orient them (there are 6 easy cases for this).<br>
<br>
4. Now solve all last layer edges with 3-cycles. This is perhaps the <br>
most tricky step. I use easy commutator 3-cycles with very few setup <br>
moves. In fact the setup is never more than 1 single move. The most <br>
difficult thing about this is to recognize which 3-cycle to do next. I <br>
normally look for 3-cycles that will solve 2 edges with same 3-cycle. <br>
So i do a quick &quot;scan&quot; tracking the edges and see if that is possible. <br>
If not i just settle for a 3-cycle solving 1 edge only. There is of <br>
coz the parity which means im left with only 2 edges to swap. This is <br>
fairly easy also. This is fixed with an inner slice turn and a edge 3-<br>
cycle on this layer. In most cases some setup moves are needed (at <br>
most 2 moves). Remember that it doesn&#x27;t matter that my parity fix will <br>
mess w the centers. With some luck block 3-cycles can also be used <br>
efficiently.<br>
<br>
5. Do all the remaining centers with yet more 3-cycles. Block cycles <br>
where possible. With practice u can achieve good cancellations btw 2 <br>
succesive 3-cycles : (simple example) r&#x27;urUr&#x27;u&#x27;d&#x27;rU&#x27;r&#x27;dr - 4 moves are <br>
cancelled. There are also some other center-algs that works on oppsite <br>
faces. One example : (r2b2)*2<br>
<br>
Benefits of this method are:<br>
<br>
- U solve the cubies into their home position all the time. There is <br>
no tricky parts where u just solve cubies relative to eachother like <br>
when pairing up edgesw Chris&#x27; method. <br>
<br>
- Doing lots of 3-cycle it&#x27;s easy to foresee where all pieces are <br>
going so u get excellent lookahead and very good flow in ur solves <br>
most of the time.<br>
<br>
- Mistakes u do early are not so fatal. There is usually easy fix for <br>
simple mistakes.<br>
<br>
- U don&#x27;t rely on a fast 3x3x3 method to do the last stage for u. My <br>
method has no &quot;3x3x3-stage&quot; at all.<br>
<br>
- Only one parity, not two.<br>
<br>
One disadvantage is that i probably need about 25% more moves as <br>
compared w Chris&#x27; method. So u really have to be a grandmaster of <br>
commutator 3-cycles and utilise block cycling as much as u can. And u <br>
need to make sure u get a good flow.<br>
<br>
A typical solve for me goes like this :<br>
<br>
- (15 secs) First layer done<br>
- (30 secs) Middle layer edges done<br>
- (50-55 secs) Last layer done<br>
- (70-75 secs) All centers are done. Cube is SOLVED!!<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s it for the 4x4x4 method. The 5x5x5 method has a few more <br>
special cases. A list of these:<br>
<br>
- Make sure while orienting the middle layers after solving first <br>
layer that the extreme middle layer is twisted such that the middle <br>
centers end up in correct location. So u are can actually only twist 2 <br>
of the 3 middle layers freely. Umm u can choose to willingly set up <br>
the 4-spot pattern. But i never do that.<br>
<br>
- For last layer edges i would do the middle edges first. This is <br>
actually a separate step since u can&#x27;t mix middle edges and outer <br>
edges. Doing the middle ones first gives easier recognition for <br>
solving the outer edges.<br>
<br>
- There are more special algs for exchanging centers between opposite <br>
faces. Example : (r2 E2)*2 or (Ff) r&#x27;u&#x27;r U r&#x27;u r U&#x27; (Ff)&#x27;<br>
<br>
Writing down these details make it cound more complicated then it <br>
really is ;-)<br>

on my notebook running Windows XP without problems, both video and

Btw, I know why Lars Vandenbergh and Macky can stay so cool in

have it about Macky, too, after seeing him on the DVDs. Notice that 
Lars has a lot of long hair which covers his neck. It&#x27;s a primary 
instinct of humans to feel vulnerable if the neck is open for attacks. 
So that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re nervous but not Lars, he&#x27;s protected by his hair. 
Macky is somewhat similar. Not with hair, but with his long-sleeved 
shirt. And with the jacket he wears *additionally*! While everybody 
else is wearing T-shirts!!! Alright, now I&#x27;ll let you praise me for 
exposing the coolness mystery...

Cheers!

Yeah, you should try that. Of course another reason for you to get

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys !<br>
<br>
I made finally a tutorial for how to assemble the Eastsheen 4x4x4 <br>
cube. I have seen many (mostly bad) descriptions how to do this. <br>
Most of them have seemed too complicated using various tricks such <br>
as loosen all the screws. It&#x27;s surprisingly easy to put it back <br>
together. But yes u need to screw off one of the inner centers in <br>
order to do it my way.<br>
<br>
Here is the link : <br>
http://vakt.idi.ntnu.no/apartment/Eastsheen_4x4x4.htm<br>
<br>
Hope that some will find it useful. I must admit that first time <br>
ever i assembled that cube it took me ages. It wasn&#x27;t until a little <br>
later i found an easy way to put it back together. Actually it&#x27;s no <br>
wonder why this puzzle locks so badly when there are so many <br>
pieces :-o<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
<br>

<br>
PS! I hate the eastsheen 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 for speeding. 4x4x4 version <br>
locks horribly and 5x5x5 version pops horribly as well as locks too <br>
much for my liking :-(<br>

Why would everyone get this skype to voice-chat? I guess quite a lot 
here already are familiar with and use regularly the yahoo 
messenger? The latest beta version (7.0) has enhanced voice-chat 
facility similar to sound quality of skype. And we can get 
eachother&#x27;s nick from this group.

Just an idea anyway ...

Have fun :-)

PS! And the yahoo messenger does so much more than Skype since it&#x27;s 
messenger software. File transfer, webcam, radio, games ...

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of serious pondering concerning last layer methods recently, since my job now affords me the time.  I have a couple of observations and would like to pose a few questions, as well as a strategy I feel might be worth consideration.  Apologies if anyone has come up with this before, but I&#x27;ve not heard of this, so I&#x27;m currently assuming I&#x27;m the only one.  Yay me. =D<br>
<br>
First off, I know that Macky uses partial edge control during the F2L.  I also know that Chris Hardwick and others are using ZBF2L.  I understand this is a good way to cut down on your LL and recognization times, while only increasing your F2L times by a smaller amount.  I also know most of the people doing this are using either a 2 or 3 look approach to follow it, with either OLL+PLL, COLL+PLL, or what have you.  I don&#x27;t think ZB is a realistic approach for most of us (sane cubers ;D).  This can make for fast times in either case, but I think it can be improved upon, without resorting to ZBLL (for those of us who are far too lazy, such as myself).<br>
<br>
I started learning the Roux method a while back, and managed some relative success with it, despite doing corners in two looks, and not learning the 26 special optimization cases or any of the fun tricks.  I managed times in the low 20&#x27;s, and was slightly faster than my 3 and 4 look LBL method at the time.  This is where I began to consider CLL and COLL based strategies as competitive.  I&#x27;ve since learned most of the PLL and some more tricks, and have been neglecting my Roux practicing lately.  I decided to learn the CLL+ELL, both to help prevent me from being a basic Fridrich clone, and to help me with my occasional Roux solving.  It also helps for 2x2x2, apparently, because I took my first averages for it yesterday, and managed a couple of 5.xx and few 6.xx solves.<br>
<br>
What if someone were to comprise a method using basic F2L with partial edge control only when the case is easy?  This would cut down on how much your F2L would be slowed down, at least on average.  You would of course need ELL algorithms to be able to finish in most cases, then.  Next, if the method included both COLL algs and CLL algs that flip edges, you would have much better odds of obtaining a lucky case for your ELL step, often rendering it a simple edge only PLL.  In the worst cases, you&#x27;d still wind up with only slightly longer LL times because of the comparison of ELL against pure edge PLL, but I think you&#x27;d make that up in time saved on the F2L and through lucky cases.<br>
<br>
As near as I can tell on my extremely quick number crunching, here are the approximate algorithm requirements for various last layer strategies:<br>
OLL+PLL:                                      57+21=78<br>
Partial Edge Control+OLL+PLL:    8+7 to 57+21=36 to 86<br>
CLL+ELL:                                      40+29=69<br>
EOLL+COLL+PLL:                         2+40+4=46<br>
Partial Edge Control+COLL+PLL:  8+40+4=52<br>
ZBF2L+COLL+PLL:                        306+40+4=350 (or fewer; I&#x27;m not certain)<br>
ZBF2L+ZBLL:                                 306+493=799<br>
Proposed method:                         8+40+40+29=117<br>
(partial edge control+C/COLL+ELL/PLL)<br>
<br>
If you discount reflections, most of these numbers will be less.  The total number of algs for the proposed method would be cut down to something like 8+24+24+19=75, giving it an small fraction of the algorithms necessary for anything ZB, but with the added advantage of more lucky scenarios and easy recognition on the each of the cases for corners.  All you would have to distinguish above and beyond either the CLL or COLL case to perform would be which of those to use, depending on the number of correctly oriented edges, and whether or not you want to flip any.  It seems at first glance, that if you double the number of algorithms in your repertoire like this, you can effectively double the number of lucky situations you can achieve.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m interested to hear what everyone thinks, and definitely what anyone who already uses a CLL or COLL approach thinks, especially as a viable alternative to ZBLL for most of us (I&#x27;m looking at you, Chris Hardwick), so if you have any thoughts or suggestions, fire away.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Mike,

Thanks for your LL post, it was really interesting reading it, and my
comments are below.

First off, I would like to add one more option to your LL approach
list.  I seriously doubt I will be ready to use much ZB tricks by
WC2005, but there is one idea that I think I may be ready for, and
would like to practice to see if it has any merit.

ZBF2L+OLL+PLL:         306+7+21=334

This idea has the advantage of using Fridrich PLL (very fast) and also
only the 7 OLL algs that flip corners (all VERY fast).  The F2L would
of course be longer, but a lot of COLL algs are very fast and very
easy to recognize, so on the easiest cases I would still do COLL.  And
of course the easiest to execute and recognize ZBLL algs as well.

I&#x27;m still doubtful of this variation, but I think it might be a better
option than COLL/PLL for me at least for WC2005.  So add that the to
your list too.  This can also have the variation:

Partial edge control+OLL+PLL which you already mentioned, so of course
ZBF2L is not required.

About your proposed method, I think it is a good idea.  The only hard
part I see is to know , for each CLL case, which edges are flipped. 
Of course just because something is hard doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t do
it too :-D  The way I see it CLL has a 1/8 chance of not only solving
corners, but flipping all edges correctly, leaving a fast edge PLL (or
a 1/12 skip).

Also I&#x27;m really starting to like COLL/PLL as well as a LL ending.  The
1/12 chance of a PLL skip comes in handy, as well as the always very
fast PLL alg.  So I also agree that this is a good strategy.

Personally I think this strategy is a good idea.  It doesn&#x27;t require a
huge number of algs, or decisions while finishing the F2L or for the
CLL/COLL step.  I think delaying won&#x27;t be a problem once mastered, and
the ending would be very fast too.

You may want to keep the fast OLL algs too, since Fridrich PLL is very
fast.  Say if you get the oriention that looks like the T (B U L U&#x27; L&#x27;
B&#x27; to setup) then just do the OLL.

Also, one thing you may want to think about for the 4th pair are ZBF2L
algs where all edges are correctly, or incorrectly flipped.  These
cases are all very easy to notice, and the algs are all very fast to
execute.  It would require you to learn roughly 25 more algs, since
most standard F2L algs are the ones that preserve edge orientation.

In general flipping all edges while doing the 4th pair takes very
slightly longer than the algs for preserving edge orientation, but not
very much.  So that might be something you could look into if you want
to expand that step, but otherwise I think partial edge control is enough.

I think this would be a good option for a LL technque, I mean the more
algs you know towards achieving a lucky case, the more likely you are
to get lucky.  And your method has the option of CLL also orienting
all edges (and also the 1/8 * 1/12 = 1/96 chance of a 1 look LL, but
only for algs that flip edges), and COLL skipping PLL step 1/12.

If you&#x27;re interested I can give you what I consider the easiest ZBF2L
cases (only about 5 or 6 or so) that are all easy to recognize and
really really short.  You could add that to partial edge control and
have a better chance of ending up with oriented edges.

I say go for it, the method sounds good to me :-D

Chris

think you&#x27;d make that up in time saved on the F2L and through lucky cases.

The total number of algs for the proposed method would be cut down to
something like 8+24+24+19=75, giving it an small fraction of the
algorithms necessary for anything ZB, but with the added advantage of
more lucky scenarios and easy recognition on the each of the cases for
corners.  All you would have to distinguish above and beyond either
the CLL or COLL case to perform would be which of those to use,
depending on the number of correctly oriented edges, and whether or
not you want to flip any.  It seems at first glance, that if you
double the number of algorithms in your repertoire like this, you can
effectively double the number of lucky situations you can achieve.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for reading the post.  It took me entirely too long to write, seeing as it was 1 in the morning here.<br>
<br>
I definitely thought about that one, but forgot to add it.  306+57+21=384 cases. (The last pair could be solved for you, leaving you with any OLL case)<br>
<br>
I only know a small portion of the CLL and a slightly larger chunk of the COLL.  Still, even using the basic approach of a 3 look LL (2 look OLL+1 look PLL), it&#x27;s easy to recognize the cases I know.  When I look at the corner orientation, I really don&#x27;t pay much attention to edges, only noticing if all are correct or some.  Because I try to follow them during the end of my F2L, this is usually not a problem.  When all are correct, obviously I use the COLL case.  And when either some or none are, I use the CLL algorithm.  Easy cases for the ELL include most of the cases where no edges are correct, the cases where all of the edges are correct, and several cases where either two adjacent or two opposing edges are correct.  This leaves something like 1/3 of the ELL cases as very easy or lucky, with the others only lagging behind a bit.  If 1/3 of cases wind up as either lucky or very easy, I think this gives the method a definite shot at being competitive with other methods.<br>
<br>
In general, I think this method also has an advantage due to incremental upgradability.  For the time being, I&#x27;m using normal F2L with some partial edge control, then flipping any remaining edges, then using COLL+PLL.  I think I&#x27;m going to finish learning the COLL first, followed the ELL.  This will help out on solves where I still have a pair of edges to flip after the F2L.  I&#x27;ll learn CLL last, since it requires ELL in some cases.  First, though, I&#x27;m interested in the ZBF2L cases you mentioneed.  For only 25 or so more algs, most of which I would imagine to be rather short, I think that sounds like a fantastic idea.  Adding those cases to the repertoire for the F2L would provide additional easy or lucky cases, and I hope it would help cancel some of the worst ELL cases, but that&#x27;s only a hope.  If you give me a list of the algs you think would be most useful for this, I can do some testing and see which would cancel.  For the easier cases, I know a few of the OLL&#x27;s, including the one you mentioned, and I use them when possible.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the input.  Now all we need is a snappy name for it...<br>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: New LL strategy proposal<br>
<br>
<br>
  Hey Mike,<br>
<br>
  Thanks for your LL post, it was really interesting reading it, and my<br>
  comments are below.<br>
<br>
  First off, I would like to add one more option to your LL approach<br>
  list.  I seriously doubt I will be ready to use much ZB tricks by<br>
  WC2005, but there is one idea that I think I may be ready for, and<br>
  would like to practice to see if it has any merit.<br>
<br>
  ZBF2L+OLL+PLL:         306+7+21=334<br>
<br>
  This idea has the advantage of using Fridrich PLL (very fast) and also<br>
  only the 7 OLL algs that flip corners (all VERY fast).  The F2L would<br>
  of course be longer, but a lot of COLL algs are very fast and very<br>
  easy to recognize, so on the easiest cases I would still do COLL.  And<br>
  of course the easiest to execute and recognize ZBLL algs as well.<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;m still doubtful of this variation, but I think it might be a better<br>
  option than COLL/PLL for me at least for WC2005.  So add that the to<br>
  your list too.  This can also have the variation:<br>
<br>
  Partial edge control+OLL+PLL which you already mentioned, so of course<br>
  ZBF2L is not required.<br>
<br>
  About your proposed method, I think it is a good idea.  The only hard<br>
  part I see is to know , for each CLL case, which edges are flipped. <br>
  Of course just because something is hard doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t do<br>
  it too :-D  The way I see it CLL has a 1/8 chance of not only solving<br>
  corners, but flipping all edges correctly, leaving a fast edge PLL (or<br>
  a 1/12 skip).<br>
<br>
  Also I&#x27;m really starting to like COLL/PLL as well as a LL ending.  The<br>
  1/12 chance of a PLL skip comes in handy, as well as the always very<br>
  fast PLL alg.  So I also agree that this is a good strategy.<br>
<br>
  Personally I think this strategy is a good idea.  It doesn&#x27;t require a<br>
  huge number of algs, or decisions while finishing the F2L or for the<br>
  CLL/COLL step.  I think delaying won&#x27;t be a problem once mastered, and<br>
  the ending would be very fast too.<br>
<br>
  You may want to keep the fast OLL algs too, since Fridrich PLL is very<br>
  fast.  Say if you get the oriention that looks like the T (B U L U&#x27; L&#x27;<br>
  B&#x27; to setup) then just do the OLL.<br>
<br>
  Also, one thing you may want to think about for the 4th pair are ZBF2L<br>
  algs where all edges are correctly, or incorrectly flipped.  These<br>
  cases are all very easy to notice, and the algs are all very fast to<br>
  execute.  It would require you to learn roughly 25 more algs, since<br>
  most standard F2L algs are the ones that preserve edge orientation.<br>
<br>
  In general flipping all edges while doing the 4th pair takes very<br>
  slightly longer than the algs for preserving edge orientation, but not<br>
  very much.  So that might be something you could look into if you want<br>
  to expand that step, but otherwise I think partial edge control is enough.<br>
<br>
  I think this would be a good option for a LL technque, I mean the more<br>
  algs you know towards achieving a lucky case, the more likely you are<br>
  to get lucky.  And your method has the option of CLL also orienting<br>
  all edges (and also the 1/8 * 1/12 = 1/96 chance of a 1 look LL, but<br>
  only for algs that flip edges), and COLL skipping PLL step 1/12.<br>
<br>
  If you&#x27;re interested I can give you what I consider the easiest ZBF2L<br>
  cases (only about 5 or 6 or so) that are all easy to recognize and<br>
  really really short.  You could add that to partial edge control and<br>
  have a better chance of ending up with oriented edges.<br>
<br>
  I say go for it, the method sounds good to me :-D<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Mike,

Here are the fastest ZBF2L algs in my opinion.  This list should also 
include all the &quot;standard&quot; F2L algs, which are very fast compared to 
most ZBF2L algs.  I inlcuded the &quot;standard&quot; alg with all the cases I 
put down here, but you really should include all of them.

http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zbf2l1.html All of these algs are 
fast and easy to recognize, and I think knowing all of these is a 
very powerful, useful tool to have in your belt so to speak.

For all the algs listed below, do the inverse to set up the case:
The groups are done by F2L case, so when the numbering goes back to 
1, that&#x27;s a new F2L case.

1) R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; U2 F
2) R U2 R&#x27; U F&#x27; U2 F 

1) F&#x27; U&#x27; F U&#x27; R U2 R&#x27;
2) F&#x27; U2 F R U2 R&#x27;
3) R U&#x27; R2 F R F&#x27;
4) R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27;

1) F&#x27; U F R U R&#x27;
2) R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27;

1) R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 R&#x27;

1) F&#x27; L&#x27; U L F R U R&#x27;
2) (U2) R&#x27; F R F&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F
3) (U) F2 U2 F U F&#x27; U F2

1) (U&#x27;) R U2 R&#x27; U F&#x27; U&#x27; F
2) F U2 F2 U&#x27; F2 U&#x27; F&#x27;

1) F&#x27; L&#x27; B&#x27; U B L F
2) R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F

1) R U R2 F R F2 U&#x27; F
2) (U) F&#x27; U F U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F

1) R U R&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F
2) F&#x27; L F&#x27; L&#x27; F2 (THE fastest ZBF2L alg, other than RUR&#x27;)
3) F&#x27; U&#x27; F U&#x27; F&#x27; U F

1) F&#x27; U2 F2 R&#x27; F&#x27; R
2) F&#x27; U2 F U&#x27; F&#x27; U F  

1) (U) R U&#x27; R&#x27; U F&#x27; U&#x27; F
2) (U&#x27;) F&#x27; U&#x27; F U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F  

1) L F&#x27; R&#x27; F R F L&#x27;
2) (U2) F&#x27; U&#x27; F U F&#x27; U2 F

http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zbf2l13.html  These are all fairly 
intuitive, and don&#x27;t require memorizing for each alg, but rather just 
the patterns seen in each case.  These are optional though.

So total count is 23 if you learn all the ones from the zbf2l1.html 
page as well as the individual ones I listed.  If you learn the 
optional ones on zbf2l13.html it&#x27;s an additional 7 (you already know 
one of the 8 cases as the &quot;standard&quot; F2L case).  So 23 algs that are 
all very fast, or if you want the additional 7 it is 30 overall.

The cases on zbf2l13.html aren&#x27;t really among the fastest cases, but 
they all follow a similar pattern, and you can quickly learn how to 
do all 8 cases once you find the pattern.

Hope this helps,
Chris

<br>
I&#x27;m moving my website, so I figured I might as well redesign while I&#x27;m <br>
at it.  The main question I have is whether people prefer a frame for <br>
navigation, the way that speedcubing.com is, and the way my site is <br>
now, or just links on the top or side of each page for navigation, <br>
that aren&#x27;t a seperate frame.  There are the pros and cons of both, so <br>
I just wanted to know what people thought.  And anything else you&#x27;d <br>
like to say, tips, constructive criticism (about the site, not my <br>
spelling ;-) ) would be greatly appreciated.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris/Mike
I havent really been following this because I dont have experience on COLL
and all those things.  However your (Chris&#x27;) point about Fridrich PLL and
the 7 corner flips in OLL is exactly the LL situation I solve when I use my
L2L1 strategy and I can vouch for how fast abnd easily recognisable it is.

Im not sure how the other L2L strategies compare with what Mike is
proposing.  They use less algorithms but as they dont use CE pairs so much
they are probably a little less efficient on the F2L.  Nevertheless you
might find something useful in there!

U had 2 replies already. Non of them answered ut question ;-)

I would say that as long as u can see that the centers are correctly 
solved it should be counted as solved (if the rest is also solved). 
This will of coz be at the judge discretion. But shouldn&#x27;t be any 
problem unless too many center caps pop at same time :-o

And yes, glue them down. It&#x27;s enough to use superglue along one edge 
only. U can also cut out the inner plastic support bridges. Well at 
least my diy cube centercaps had those. But they were obstructed by 
the screws so i had to remove them ...

Surely yes.  Isn&#x27;t that in the WCA rules?

Not keen on superglue myself.  Even with a small amount on one ridge, 
the ridge can break when removing the cap.  Currently I make one or two 
cuts across the ridge using a sharp knife.  Like Ton&#x27;s &quot;hammer method&quot;, 
this deforms the ridge sufficiently to keep the cap in place.

Or you could try Stefan&#x27;s paper crosses to wedge the caps in place.

          <div class="email-content">If I understand correctly, what you propose is:

(1) Take care of last-layer edges orientation while solving the last
pair, only if it&#x27;s very fast.
(2) Solve last layer corners before edges, using sequences that do not
flip edges only if they&#x27;re already correctly oriented thanks to (1).
(3) Solve last layer edges, using mostly PLL sequences.

What I think about it:

(1) I&#x27;m not a F2L/OLL solver, but it looks like a good idea. I think a
lot of Fridrich users try to do this, at least to avoid OLL cases with
4 misoriented edges.
(2) Why not! The CLL and COLL sets have a lot in common. And you can
ask Masayuki Akimoto, I think one of his goals last year was to find
CLL sequences that solve edges orientation too.
(3) That&#x27;s where I disagree. Unfortunately, permuting oriented edges
is not always faster than some other ELL cases. Take M&#x27;UMU2M&#x27;UM for
example, or R&#x27;U&#x27;RUMU&#x27;R&#x27;Ur. They are VERY fast and frequent. (plus I
feel a bit stupid when I have to 3-cycle edges of a side, it&#x27;s much
faster to 3-cycle edges of an inner slice with U2M&#x27;U2 :-) )


In my opinion, the keys to faster solving are:

1) Learn a basic method perfectly. Train a lot, anticipate, practice
fingers and mental dexterity, etc.

2) Multi-experts optimizations, or dynamic hybrid methods. Try to
maximize lucky cases by choosing a technique or another.
When the &quot;method R3a-Z expert&quot; in your head yells &quot;Hey! This case is
for me, I know that if you follow me, the chances for you to finish
this cube fast are quite good!&quot;, listen to him.
That&#x27;s what you propose, and I totally agree with you.
That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing with the last 6 edges and 4 centers: Method 2 if
I don&#x27;t want to think at all, methods 1+3 tricks when there&#x27;s an
obvious shortcut that can be detected fast, and sometimes ELL when the
F2L are already solved.
If at a given point of a solve you&#x27;re given to choose between 2
possibilities, choose the one that is statistically the most powerful.
But mixing different methods in real time is not easy. The criteria
that will tell you to choose one way or another have to be very
simple, because every step must be anticipated while
executing/finishing the previous step.
If you can&#x27;t anticipate enough, you can&#x27;t ready your fingers, and
since we&#x27;re trying to optimize for a few 1/10s it&#x27;s often much easier
to loose time.
*IDEA* We could draw a graph of all methods and variations, that would
tell you, step by step, what your choices are and how to decide.

3) Learn a lot of magical sequences.
I don&#x27;t believe in learning hundreds of cases to solve LL corners +
permute edges. Since Lars or others introduced this idea, I&#x27;ve never
understood why it makes people so excited (but it&#x27;s fine if other
people like this idea and have fun looking for all these sequences, I
hope they&#x27;ll prove me wrong -- Chris ;-) ).

it can be improved upon, without resorting to ZBLL (for those of us
who are far too lazy, such as myself).

I managed times in the low 20&#x27;s, and was slightly faster than my 3 and
4 look LBL method at the time.  This is where I began to consider CLL
and COLL based strategies as competitive.  I&#x27;ve since learned most of
the PLL and some more tricks, and have been neglecting my Roux
practicing lately.  I decided to learn the CLL+ELL, both to help
prevent me from being a basic Fridrich clone, and to help me with my
occasional Roux solving.  It also helps for 2x2x2, apparently, because
I took my first averages for it yesterday, and managed a couple of
5.xx and few 6.xx solves.

on how much your F2L would be slowed down, at least on average.  You
would of course need ELL algorithms to be able to finish in most
cases, then.  Next, if the method included both COLL algs and CLL algs
that flip edges, you would have much better odds of obtaining a lucky
case for your ELL step, often rendering it a simple edge only PLL.  In
the worst cases, you&#x27;d still wind up with only slightly longer LL
times because of the comparison of ELL against pure edge PLL, but I
think you&#x27;d make that up in time saved on the F2L and through lucky cases.

The total number of algs for the proposed method would be cut down to
something like 8+24+24+19=75, giving it an small fraction of the
algorithms necessary for anything ZB, but with the added advantage of
more lucky scenarios and easy recognition on the each of the cases for
corners.  All you would have to distinguish above and beyond either
the CLL or COLL case to perform would be which of those to use,
depending on the number of correctly oriented edges, and whether or
not you want to flip any.  It seems at first glance, that if you
double the number of algorithms in your repertoire like this, you can
effectively double the number of lucky situations you can achieve.

Thanks, after three superglue people I almost thought I&#x27;m the only one

Six is good I think.

But just to be sure we mean the same thing: 6 participations, not 6 
weeks, right? Or in other words: 6 weeks in which you participate. If 
you just say 6 weeks then I might decide to take a 6 week break after 
winning which is certainly not what you want ;-)

Hey everyone,

I&#x27;m moving my website, so I figured I might as well redesign while I&#x27;m 
at it.  The main question I have is whether people prefer a frame for 
navigation, the way that speedcubing.com is, and the way my site is 
now, or just links on the top or side of each page for navigation, 
that aren&#x27;t a seperate frame.  There are the pros and cons of both, so 
I just wanted to know what people thought.  And anything else you&#x27;d 
like to say, tips, constructive criticism (about the site, not my 
spelling ;-) ) would be greatly appreciated.

-Evan

Until next time, Happy Cubing

4)pair up last 3 edges with a 3 cycle

5) Orient edges and fix flip parity

6) last corners

7) solve edges and fix swap parity

8)solve last 4 centers.

 

 

I&#x27;m not sure step 3-7 is the fastest way to go about with a start like this.
Perhaps solving edges directly with 3 edge cycles might be faster. I can&#x27;t
tell whether or not it would be good for speedcubing simply because I take
so long to do step 4 and 8 ( I only know a 2 center cycle and the two center
algs Per gave below...). Any ideas?

Subject: [Speed cubing group] 4x4x4 method :-)

 

Hi James :-)

For the 4x4x4 revenge/master cube i use the same system as i do for 
the 5x5x5 wahn/professor cube.

The basic steps are as follows:

(I call this the &quot;Cage&quot; method. )

1. Do first layer completely. This is intuitive. If some centers 
are &quot;tricky&quot; to solve they can be left for later if so desired. 
basically i solve the cubies in the order i see them. Cubies that make 
up blocks are inserted into first layer as a block also, when possible.

2. (First twist the middle layers into favorable positions. U can get 
quite a few edges and/or centers for free by doing this.) Now do 
middle layers edges. This is done by and large with commutator 3-
cycles. Also here one can cycle blocks of cubies when solving them. 
Either to solve several edges at the same time or remove badly placed 
edges (move to final layer where i do most of the &quot;fishing&quot;) or move 
bad edges to a better position within the middle layers.

3. Final layer corners. First position them (only 2 algs needed) then 
orient them (there are 6 easy cases for this).

4. Now solve all last layer edges with 3-cycles. This is perhaps the 
most tricky step. I use easy commutator 3-cycles with very few setup 
moves. In fact the setup is never more than 1 single move. The most 
difficult thing about this is to recognize which 3-cycle to do next. I 
normally look for 3-cycles that will solve 2 edges with same 3-cycle. 
So i do a quick &quot;scan&quot; tracking the edges and see if that is possible. 
If not i just settle for a 3-cycle solving 1 edge only. There is of 
coz the parity which means im left with only 2 edges to swap. This is 
fairly easy also. This is fixed with an inner slice turn and a edge 3-
cycle on this layer. In most cases some setup moves are needed (at 
most 2 moves). Remember that it doesn&#x27;t matter that my parity fix will 
mess w the centers. With some luck block 3-cycles can also be used 
efficiently.

5. Do all the remaining centers with yet more 3-cycles. Block cycles 
where possible. With practice u can achieve good cancellations btw 2 
succesive 3-cycles : (simple example) r&#x27;urUr&#x27;u&#x27;d&#x27;rU&#x27;r&#x27;dr - 4 moves are 
cancelled. There are also some other center-algs that works on oppsite 
faces. One example : (r2b2)*2

Benefits of this method are:

- U solve the cubies into their home position all the time. There is 
no tricky parts where u just solve cubies relative to eachother like 
when pairing up edgesw Chris&#x27; method. 

- Doing lots of 3-cycle it&#x27;s easy to foresee where all pieces are 
going so u get excellent lookahead and very good flow in ur solves 
most of the time.

- Mistakes u do early are not so fatal. There is usually easy fix for 
simple mistakes.

- U don&#x27;t rely on a fast 3x3x3 method to do the last stage for u. My 
method has no &quot;3x3x3-stage&quot; at all.

- Only one parity, not two.

One disadvantage is that i probably need about 25% more moves as 
compared w Chris&#x27; method. So u really have to be a grandmaster of 
commutator 3-cycles and utilise block cycling as much as u can. And u 
need to make sure u get a good flow.

A typical solve for me goes like this :

- (15 secs) First layer done
- (30 secs) Middle layer edges done
- (50-55 secs) Last layer done
- (70-75 secs) All centers are done. Cube is SOLVED!!

That&#x27;s it for the 4x4x4 method. The 5x5x5 method has a few more 
special cases. A list of these:

- Make sure while orienting the middle layers after solving first 
layer that the extreme middle layer is twisted such that the middle 
centers end up in correct location. So u are can actually only twist 2 
of the 3 middle layers freely. Umm u can choose to willingly set up 
the 4-spot pattern. But i never do that.

- For last layer edges i would do the middle edges first. This is 
actually a separate step since u can&#x27;t mix middle edges and outer 
edges. Doing the middle ones first gives easier recognition for 
solving the outer edges.

- There are more special algs for exchanging centers between opposite 
faces. Example : (r2 E2)*2 or (Ff) r&#x27;u&#x27;r U r&#x27;u r U&#x27; (Ff)&#x27;

Writing down these details make it cound more complicated then it 
really is ;-)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi James,

I&#x27;ve got the same 1st, 2nd and 8th steps :-)
The rest differs:
a) Build two 1x3x4 L/R-blocks - 55
b) Finish L/R-sides (4 edge pieces) - 75
c) Solve M (L+r) edges (8 pieces) - 95
d) Solve M centers (16 pieces) - 130
No parity problems, that&#x27;s the good point of &quot;centers-last&quot;.

It averages 130 moves, but my technique is rather basic. For example,
I don&#x27;t use complicated sequences in c), only a simple one: U2rU2. In
d) I&#x27;m sure you can optimize much more than I do.
I&#x27;m not a big 4^3 fan and my best average is 84 secs. But I think such
a technique is slower than the &quot;standard&quot; way (pairing up edges).
Because there are many slice moves.

Did you try:
6) corners, and then
5+7) solve edges and fix parity problems
Are parity fixing sequences much shorter when you don&#x27;t have to
preserve some centers?

GIlles.

Did you try:
6) corners, and then
5+7) solve edges and fix parity problems
Are parity fixing sequences much shorter when you don&#x27;t have to
preserve some centers?

 

I just use the pure edge swap and the almost pure edge flip that messes up
orientation of corners.

Hi James,

I&#x27;ve got the same 1st, 2nd and 8th steps :-)
The rest differs:
a) Build two 1x3x4 L/R-blocks - 55
b) Finish L/R-sides (4 edge pieces) - 75
c) Solve M (L+r) edges (8 pieces) - 95
d) Solve M centers (16 pieces) - 130
No parity problems, that&#x27;s the good point of &quot;centers-last&quot;.

It averages 130 moves, but my technique is rather basic. For example,
I don&#x27;t use complicated sequences in c), only a simple one: U2rU2. In
d) I&#x27;m sure you can optimize much more than I do.
I&#x27;m not a big 4^3 fan and my best average is 84 secs. But I think such
a technique is slower than the &quot;standard&quot; way (pairing up edges).
Because there are many slice moves.

Did you try:
6) corners, and then
5+7) solve edges and fix parity problems
Are parity fixing sequences much shorter when you don&#x27;t have to
preserve some centers?

          <div class="email-content">Um... I just do the COLL followed by a three-cycle. It takes me 
about 4.25s. (4.23, 4.04, 4.54 4.43, 3.81, 4.54, ...) It&#x27;s becuase 
this particular COLL is really short and fast for me.

I do it this way:
[u&#x27;] L&#x27;B&#x27;RBLB&#x27;R&#x27;B - [u] R&#x27;UR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;URUR2&#x27;,
where the last turn of the first part cnacels out with the first 
turn of the second part and can thus be omitted.

Hopefully people understand my notation ([u&#x27;] = y&#x27;).

          <div class="email-content">Hi, Chris.

In return for your advice on my developing method, here&#x27;s a little feedback for you. =D

I played around with a few things, and then settled on my approach, which is the COLL alg, followed by the edge 3 cycle.

I do it like this:
B&#x27; R&#x27;FR B R&#x27;F&#x27;R y2 M2U&#x27;M U2 MU&#x27; M2

But it might help to either look at it like this:
x D&#x27;R&#x27;UR D R&#x27;U&#x27;l y2 M2U&#x27;M U2 MU&#x27; M2

Performing it like that, after ten or so practice tries, I took an average and wound up at 3.91 seconds.

Since I&#x27;m too lazy, that&#x27;s how I do it.  To make it a single alg, however, I&#x27;d eliminate the y2 turn by just doing the 3 cycle from the other side.  The biggest factor slowing down this alg the way I do it is the rotation.  If you eliminate this, I&#x27;m sure you could do much better.
Try B&#x27; R&#x27;FR B R&#x27;F&#x27;R M2U&#x27;M&#x27; U2 M&#x27;U&#x27; M2.

Happy learning too many algorithms for a new method in hopes of becoming only a few seconds faster! ;D

          <div class="email-content">Yep.  You&#x27;re correct.  I&#x27;m nuts. ; )<br>
<br>
But in regards to (3), I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;re correct.  Like you mentioned down there, permuting edges within a slice may be ever so slightly faster, but I don&#x27;t think the PLL&#x27;s are all that slow.  I just tried an average of a slice 3 cycle against a normal 3 cycle, and the slice 3 cycle was only .2 seconds faster.  Also, The PLL&#x27;s are slightly easier to recognize, because you only have to pay attention to placement, not placement and orientation.  In regards to the ELL case you mentioned, that&#x27;s almost exactly how I perform the 3 cycle. Just change the first and last M&#x27;/M to M2.<br>
<br>
I agree with your position, as noted on your site, that algorithms involving M and U turns are very fast.  All of the ELL&#x27;s I use are of that variety for the same reason.  My brain thinks in terms of slice moves well, and they just feel right.<br>
<br>
I also disagree with your position that mixing methods in real time is very difficult or detrimental.  It just takes practice.  Especially at the start of my solves, I try to be ambigous about methods.  The more methods you are familiar and comfortable with, the more chances you have for lucky cases.  If I see an easy start with your method, I use it.  I also employ lots of blocks and every once in a great while an extended cross.  My times have only benefited from this, as near as I can tell.<br>
<br>
As for last layer method ambiguity, it&#x27;s also really not that hard.  To distinguish between using the CLL and COLL case, you really only have to know whether or not you managed to solve all of the edges during the last F2L pair, which I try to keep track of anyhow.  You don&#x27;t necessarily need to know which specific edges or how many are flipped.  You just need to know that some are or none are.  My reaction times are already fairly low for the few cases I already know.  I anticipate they will improve with practice.<br>
<br>
And happily, the cases aren&#x27;t really as numerous as they appear.  There are 24 CLL+reflections (which I learn simultaneously, so they really seem like a single case to me).  It&#x27;s the same number for COLL.  There are only 19 or 20 distinct cases for ELL, 3 of which are the PLL cases.  That leaves 24+24+16=64 cases+whatever optional junk you feel like throwing in.  It&#x27;s not a beginner method, by any means, but it seems to me to be the logical next step from either COLL+PLL or CLL+ELL.  Of course, I know of a certain &#x27;simple&#x27; method that uses 24 corner cases+9 edge algs+26 special edge cases=59, so for the extra 6, I think I&#x27;ll be in a similar boat. ;D<br>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: New LL strategy proposal<br>
<br>
<br>
  If I understand correctly, what you propose is:<br>
<br>
  (1) Take care of last-layer edges orientation while solving the last<br>
  pair, only if it&#x27;s very fast.<br>
  (2) Solve last layer corners before edges, using sequences that do not<br>
  flip edges only if they&#x27;re already correctly oriented thanks to (1).<br>
  (3) Solve last layer edges, using mostly PLL sequences.<br>
<br>
  What I think about it:<br>
<br>
  (1) I&#x27;m not a F2L/OLL solver, but it looks like a good idea. I think a<br>
  lot of Fridrich users try to do this, at least to avoid OLL cases with<br>
  4 misoriented edges.<br>
  (2) Why not! The CLL and COLL sets have a lot in common. And you can<br>
  ask Masayuki Akimoto, I think one of his goals last year was to find<br>
  CLL sequences that solve edges orientation too.<br>
  (3) That&#x27;s where I disagree. Unfortunately, permuting oriented edges<br>
  is not always faster than some other ELL cases. Take M&#x27;UMU2M&#x27;UM for<br>
  example, or R&#x27;U&#x27;RUMU&#x27;R&#x27;Ur. They are VERY fast and frequent. (plus I<br>
  feel a bit stupid when I have to 3-cycle edges of a side, it&#x27;s much<br>
  faster to 3-cycle edges of an inner slice with U2M&#x27;U2 :-) )<br>
<br>
<br>
  In my opinion, the keys to faster solving are:<br>
<br>
  1) Learn a basic method perfectly. Train a lot, anticipate, practice<br>
  fingers and mental dexterity, etc.<br>
<br>
  2) Multi-experts optimizations, or dynamic hybrid methods. Try to<br>
  maximize lucky cases by choosing a technique or another.<br>
  When the &quot;method R3a-Z expert&quot; in your head yells &quot;Hey! This case is<br>
  for me, I know that if you follow me, the chances for you to finish<br>
  this cube fast are quite good!&quot;, listen to him.<br>
  That&#x27;s what you propose, and I totally agree with you.<br>
  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing with the last 6 edges and 4 centers: Method 2 if<br>
  I don&#x27;t want to think at all, methods 1+3 tricks when there&#x27;s an<br>
  obvious shortcut that can be detected fast, and sometimes ELL when the<br>
  F2L are already solved.<br>
  If at a given point of a solve you&#x27;re given to choose between 2<br>
  possibilities, choose the one that is statistically the most powerful.<br>
  But mixing different methods in real time is not easy. The criteria<br>
  that will tell you to choose one way or another have to be very<br>
  simple, because every step must be anticipated while<br>
  executing/finishing the previous step.<br>
  If you can&#x27;t anticipate enough, you can&#x27;t ready your fingers, and<br>
  since we&#x27;re trying to optimize for a few 1/10s it&#x27;s often much easier<br>
  to loose time.<br>
  *IDEA* We could draw a graph of all methods and variations, that would<br>
  tell you, step by step, what your choices are and how to decide.<br>
<br>
  3) Learn a lot of magical sequences.<br>
  I don&#x27;t believe in learning hundreds of cases to solve LL corners +<br>
  permute edges. Since Lars or others introduced this idea, I&#x27;ve never<br>
  understood why it makes people so excited (but it&#x27;s fine if other<br>
  people like this idea and have fun looking for all these sequences, I<br>
  hope they&#x27;ll prove me wrong -- Chris ;-) ).<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have a possible idea.

Last night I chatted with Tyson about a method which ranks people 
based on how much they bettered their average average, according to 
Normal Probability theory.

This would require everyone taking part to have a regular statistic 
on their previous (at least 30, maybe 50) cubes, with Mean and S.d.

A normal probability calculation could then be performed on their 
competition average, and the person who has beaten their average 
average with the lowest probability of occurrence should take the 
prize, since they have bettered themselves the most, no matter what 
their times are. This would reward constantly improving competitors 
more, than just the fastest guy each week.

This is the method I shall be using in the friendly handicap 
competition we will have on July 16th in the first puzzle meeting of 
speedcubers in the UK.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

It&#x27;s a pretty grey area, I guess we have to be limited by the 
generosity of our associate, Chris @ cubesmith.com, I would feel a 
bit cheeky asking for more and more free stuff to try and cater for 
everyone, to please everyone, and make it completely fair to 
everyone involved.

I do take your point of course. At first I didn&#x27;t like the 
ineligibility idea, but I am warming to it now. Best newcomer is a 
very good idea, perhaps I would include this very soon. And also it 
might be possible to extend my normal calculation to FMC, but 
gleaning the Mean/SD statistic would be much harder, perhaps it 
would be more feasible to use a different distribution or so.

Thanks for your ideas though! I wish I knew what I was doing more :P

  I have a possible idea.

  Last night I chatted with Tyson about a method which ranks people 
  based on how much they bettered their average average, according to 
  Normal Probability theory.

  This would require everyone taking part to have a regular statistic 
  on their previous (at least 30, maybe 50) cubes, with Mean and S.d.

  A normal probability calculation could then be performed on their 
  competition average, and the person who has beaten their average 
  average with the lowest probability of occurrence should take the 
  prize, since they have bettered themselves the most, no matter what 
  their times are. This would reward constantly improving competitors 
  more, than just the fastest guy each week.

  This is the method I shall be using in the friendly handicap 
  competition we will have on July 16th in the first puzzle meeting of 
  speedcubers in the UK.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, almost right, 

but don&#x27;t forget it also is dependent on the Standard Deviation. Two 
people who have the same average (say 30 seconds) but Person 1 has a 
long term (50 cubes or so) SD of 5 seconds, and Person 2 has an SD 
of 10 seconds. (Just example numbers)

If they both then posted a 25 second average in a competition, 
Person 1 would be ranked higher than person 2, because they would 
have beaten their average by 1 SD, whereas Person 2 only beats his 
by 1/2 SD. This means that the probability that Person 1 would score 
25s in the competition is lower than the probability of Person 2 
posting the same.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for all of the great ideas.  I like Dan&#x27;s idea, but it would 
be very difficult to coordinate for the 70 - 80 different 
competitors.  This is what I cam up with last night:

Starting next Sunday.  The winner of the contest will recieve a set 
of stickers for any six-color puzzle of his or her choice.  In 
addition to that, a random drawing will be held for a set of 3x3x3 
stickers.  Winners will be ineligable for 4 participations in the 
contest.  For every consecutive participation non-winners will get 
an additional entry into the drawing for the next week.  So the more 
that you participate, the better the chances that you&#x27;ll win the 
drawing.

Thanks to  http://www.cubesmith.com  for supplying the prizes!

The two 14-move QTM solutions found by ACube can be quite fast:

- (RUR&#x27;U&#x27;l&#x27;B&#x27;Ul)z&#x27;x&#x27;(U&#x27;R&#x27;FRE)
You should naturally find the &quot;right&quot; left finger and the &quot;right&quot;
right grip for the last E.

- (RUR&#x27;uRU&#x27;)x(U&#x27;r&#x27;U&#x27;rUR&#x27;)y&#x27;(R&#x27;U)
Sub-4s is easy.

Of course you could also do without that key feature if you replace 
the U2 at start with U&#x27; and add another U&#x27; at the end:

(U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U2)(L U&#x27;)(R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U2)(L&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27;)

Actually though you solve the inverse case since you probably used 
Dan&#x27;s solution for scrambling:

(U L)(R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U)(L&#x27; U2)(R U&#x27; R&#x27; U)

And they&#x27;re even inverse algorithms ;-)

Ok, now what I&#x27;d really like to know is how you found these 
algorithms.

Found with ACube using &lt;R,U,F>. I like the first one better and you 
could save its first U by adjusting the U layer differently. I think

That saves you on a rotation, which is unproductive in terms of moves per second, since it&#x27;s not really even a move.<br>

<br>
<br>
  I saw all of the other solutions to the ZBLL case and I simply did this:<br>
<br>
  y(U2 R U R&#x27; U2)(L U&#x27;)(R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U2)(L&#x27; R&#x27;)<br>
<br>
  The key to this sequence is in the y at the very beginning. The goal is to have as many <br>
  triggers involving (R,U) and (L,U) as possible. I hope this helps.<br>
<br>
  My slowest time for this was 4 seconds (which I got only twice) and my fastest was 2. I&#x27;m <br>
  guessing my average was about 2.6 - 2.9 seconds for this case.<br>

I would really like to come and participate. I live in Tampere, 
Finland, and it&#x27;s quite easy to come by train/ship to Stockholm. 
It&#x27;s not that expensive and I don&#x27;t mind about spending 10 hours on 
the sea, from Turku to Stockholm.

But since hotels are much more expensive, I was thinking if it would 
be possible for one of you to let me stay at their place for 
preferably the three nights of the tournament (Friday to Monday). If 
it is possible, then I will surely come!

Send me more details of your specific situation, but it is typical for 
shows to require you to relinquish rights to any materials [footage or 
ideas or suggestions] you submit for the show.  That way, they don&#x27;t 
have to pay you for the material and even if they use it, you are not 
entitled to royalties and cannot sue for copyright infringement, etc.  
And because they now own it, they can use it in any manner they 
please.  

If you want to email me more details, you can reach me at Kirk[at]

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

Wow!  Thanks so much for all the help!  I really appreciate the time
you guys took to do this.

I went through and tested and worked on every alg, and finally came up
with the two best options (for my hands of course).

In fact, both of these algs are so fast that I am having a hard time
deciding between the two.  I think I may learn both of them, since
they both end with effectively turning the LL a different direction.

You all seriously turned my slowest case into one of my faster ones!

Thanks so much!!!

Here are my choices for the best two (again for my hands).  The first
one is slightly faster on average, but again #2 is so close I can&#x27;t
really ditch it for #1.

1) y L&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; L2 U L2 F U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L2 U L2 (posted by James Stuber)
fastest exection: 2.26 seconds (5.75 t/sec including the cube rotation)
fastest average: 2.82 seconds (4.61 t/sec)
This includes the y rotation at the beginning, which actually makes
the following L&#x27; F&#x27; much easier.
I do the trigger as
(y L&#x27; F&#x27;) U&#x27; (L&#x27;)2 U (L)2 (F) U&#x27; (L&#x27; U&#x27; (L)2) (U) (L&#x27;)2
also ending with a U turn is fast because both hands end at a standard
grip.

2) R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; F U2 R2 (posted by Stefan Pochmann)
fastest execution: 2.30 seconds
fastest average: 3.19 seconds (could be faster as I practiced #1 a bit
more.  I think this one can also go sub-3 on average.)
I do the trigger as:
[(R&#x27; U R&#x27;) (U&#x27;)] (R&#x27; U&#x27;) (F&#x27;) [(R&#x27; U) (R U&#x27;)] (F U2) R2

Pros of #1:
-the L2 U alternating moves are CRAZY fast, so the ending and the
middle go by VERY quickly.
- my common misalignment mistakes are easily corrected
- grip never changes after y rotation

Pros of #2:
- Lots of RU moves
- grip never changes
- no rotation required

Cons of #1:
- The first trigger/rotation is hard to correct if I screw up
- It requires a rotation from the angle I recognize the case at

Cons of #2:
- It has 3 non-productive hand movements (twisting my wrist around so
that where I was grabbing the back of the face I now have to grab the
front: the first move has none).
- My common mistakes tend to be the move f&#x27; (F&#x27;S&#x27;) instead of (F&#x27;)
which kills my time completely.  So mistakes are not easily corrected.

----------------------

So far I like #1 just a tiiiiiiiny little bit better, but I think I&#x27;ll
end up keeping both.

I&#x27;m so quoting help from the group on my ZBLL page for this case :-D

Thanks so much to everyone, I spent a good bit of time figuring out
finger tricks to each alg, so thanks to everyone who posted an alg.  I
really appreciate it.

Thanks so much!
Chris

Hello!

I am also planning on comming to the competition and we (me and 
Sebastian) already had a talk about joining up and travelling 
together. I have a friend living in Stockholm who probably can house 
both of us (but I haven&#x27;t asked yet :D).

See you in Stockholm,

Actually after lots more practice I&#x27;ve decided to stick with this alg<br>
only.  I&#x27;ve found that with the other alg (my #2 from before) I can<br>
only get sub-3 on a flawless execution, whereas I can still get sub-3<br>
on #1 even with minor mistakes.  Also even with more practice I can&#x27;t<br>
get #2 to average sub-3, but I can easily now with #1.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all for the help.  I really really really appreciate it!  I<br>
went from 4.00-4.25 on average to sub-3 for this case!<br>
<br>
Can&#x27;t say thanks enough :-)<br>

y L&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; L2 U L2 F U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L2 U L2

Actually after lots more practice I&#x27;ve decided to stick with this alg
only.  I&#x27;ve found that with the other alg (my #2 from before) I can
only get sub-3 on a flawless execution, whereas I can still get sub-3
on #1 even with minor mistakes.  Also even with more practice I can&#x27;t
get #2 to average sub-3, but I can easily now with #1.

Thanks to all for the help.  I really really really appreciate it!  I
went from 4.00-4.25 on average to sub-3 for this case!

Can&#x27;t say thanks enough :-)

It&#x27;s the square root of the variation, which is the expected value of (X-mu)^2 where X is 
your random variable and mu is the mean. (Population standard deviation)

The sample variance is 1/(n-1) * sum (x-m)^2 where m is the sample mean and n is the 
size of the sample. That&#x27;s not quite the expected value (which would begin with 1/n rather 
than 1/(n-1). The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance. It 
is an unbiased estimator of the population standard deviation (which might not be 
tractable). If you replace 1/(n-1) by 1/n you&#x27;ll get a biased estimator, although I think you 
will then have the maximum likelihood estimator. It&#x27;s been a long time so that part about 
the MLE might not be right.

Heh, sorry, I let the camera just dangle from my neck when I filmed
because nobody else was around to film.  Yes, transform 5 on Jaap&#x27;s
page, except the way I hold it is slightly different than he suggests,
I believe.  I like the way I hold it because it feels very fast for
me, but different people have different preferences on how to hold the
puzzle for that transform.

Side note--I made a new Magic video recently:
http://www.cubewhiz.com/videos/burtonmagic129.avi (1.29 seconds). 
Notice the pause in the solve?  Should have been faster... :\

the alg for double layer turns.  Thanks to Francois again after giving <br>
this alg to me again when I lost it...lol<br>

That one might replace my slowest alg of all. And the U at the end 
could be left out or changed to U2 or U&#x27; so all angles could be 
completed fast. But how do you do the B&#x27; and B moves fast?

For this one, I prefer (L U2&#x27;) (L&#x27; U2) (L F&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L U) (L F L2&#x27; U),
which can somewhat easily be done in sub-2 seconds (easily average
sub-2.5).  This could be even faster if I cubed left-handed. ;-) How
fast have you been able to perform this one?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
I would like some input on the following method for judging a <br>
handicap competition, especially whether it is actually feasible to <br>
use in a competition!<br>
<br>
1. From each competitor, have a long term Mean and Standard <br>
Deviation Statistic. From my Statistics course a long tim ago, the <br>
number 30 seems to ring a bell in my head, ie you have to make 30+ <br>
solves before the statistics becomes valid.<br>
<br>
2. After the competition, calculate each competitors average. Then <br>
calculate a Normal Probability, with competition average as the &quot;x&quot; <br>
statistic, and using the long term Mean and SD. This will calculate <br>
the probability of the competitor achieving this competition <br>
average, if they were to make many thousands of averages.<br>
<br>
3. The competitor who has achieved the lowest average probability <br>
would win, and competitors are ranked in order of ascending <br>
probabilities.<br>
<br>
So, all fine in theory?<br>
<br>
I have tried plugging some numbers into a spreadsheet, and the <br>
results are quite promising. But one observation I have made, is <br>
that in real life, results don&#x27;t seem to &quot;quite fit&quot; the normal <br>
distribution. It is perfectly likely for someone who is quite <br>
consistent in practice, to have a wildly varying average in <br>
competition, and the probabilities end up being almost 0, or almost <br>
1. Is there someway of &quot;stretching&quot; the margins of the normal <br>
probability, so it can cover a wider range of results? One way would <br>
be to multiply the competitors standard deviations by a factor, but <br>
is this mathematically valid?<br>
<br>
Any help is greatly needed :)<br>

That way I&#x27;d win with a 60 second average because the probability for 
that is incredibly small ;-). Well, Macky might beat it with a 20 
second average being similarly improbable.

If your average was say 20 seconds (am I flattering or insulting you 
Stefan? ;) ) and you made a 60 second average in competition, then 
you would be at the high end of the scale, you probability would be 
1, because the likelihood in the long term almost (if not all) your 
averages would be 60 seconds or under. So there is no way you would 
win like that. To win, you have to better your average by the most.

If you can&#x27;t find somewhere to stay, you could stay at my hotel room
and we could split the cost, if this would help.  I&#x27;m getting one of
those flight+hotel deals from Travelocity or something, so the hotel
comes out to be only like $30-40 per night.

<br>
That&#x27;s great!  It&#x27;ll be great to see you again.  I&#x27;m very curious at <br>
how suddenly you acquired money to go to the tournament.  If you&#x27;ve <br>
found out how to make money from solving cubes, you gotta let me know.<br>
<br>
As for all of you, if you feel you&#x27;re &#x27;noteworthy&#x27; or &#x27;special&#x27; in any <br>
way, the museum is looking for ways to promote the tournament.  Part of <br>
this includes making profiles of the competitors and talking about what <br>
they&#x27;ve done.  For example, there could be a huge poster of Chris that <br>
lists all of his records and everything.  You guys should let me know, <br>
because these things might look cool, and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d let you take <br>
it home afterwards.<br>
<br>
Sorry I can&#x27;t provide you with a place to stay.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t <br>
live in Dallas (naturally) and I&#x27;m staying at a friend&#x27;s place and <br>
everything.  Maybe they have like, youth hostels or something?<br>

&gt; Are there any Dallas cubers, or other cubers nearby, that I could stay<br>
&gt; with just for the competition?  I guess I would lfy in sometime Friday<br>
&gt; and leave on Sunday?  Like I said I can eat my own food and all that,<br>
&gt; but I don&#x27;t think I could swing hotel costs on top of my flight and <br>
&gt; food.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

Yes, you are right. :-)

Anyway: if anyone has time and interest in checking back all WCA 
acknowledged events for records for all categories, then maybe soon we can 
change that text into &quot;previous world records&quot;. It is time that is 
prohibiting me.
If you do this, then please use the format of that page. And tell it to the 
world, because otherwise maybe two people are doing the same.

Have fun,

Ron

Yeah I&#x27;m VERY excited to be going and looking forward to hanging out
again as well :-D  Maybe you and Macky can help me learn to juggle,
I&#x27;ve always been interested but never really tried it :-)

lol, no it&#x27;s simply a matter of only spending money on food and gas
for the next six weeks or so ;-)  I can swing it though.  I just
talked to my parents, and if I do run a few bucks short they can spot
me a little bit.  So I&#x27;m definitely coming.

Woohoo!!!  :-D It&#x27;s always cool to see other cubers, and it sadly
happens too infrequently.  Well, see you guys in August :-)

&gt; average, if they were to make many thousands of averages.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 3. The competitor who has achieved the lowest average probability <br>
&gt; would win, and competitors are ranked in order of ascending <br>
&gt; probabilities.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; So, all fine in theory?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I have tried plugging some numbers into a spreadsheet, and the <br>
&gt; results are quite promising. But one observation I have made, is <br>
&gt; that in real life, results don&#x27;t seem to &quot;quite fit&quot; the normal <br>
&gt; distribution. It is perfectly likely for someone who is quite <br>
&gt; consistent in practice, to have a wildly varying average in <br>
&gt; competition, and the probabilities end up being almost 0, or almost <br>
&gt; 1. Is there someway of &quot;stretching&quot; the margins of the normal <br>
&gt; probability, so it can cover a wider range of results? One way would <br>
&gt; be to multiply the competitors standard deviations by a factor, but <br>
&gt; is this mathematically valid?<br>

Yeah I&#x27;m VERY excited to be going and looking forward to hanging out
again as well :-D  Maybe you and Macky can help me learn to juggle,
I&#x27;ve always been interested but never really tried it :-)

lol, no it&#x27;s simply a matter of only spending money on food and gas
for the next six weeks or so ;-)  I can swing it though.  I just
talked to my parents, and if I do run a few bucks short they can spot
me a little bit.  So I&#x27;m definitely coming.

Woohoo!!!  :-D It&#x27;s always cool to see other cubers, and it sadly
happens too infrequently.  Well, see you guys in August :-)

          <div class="email-content">Pool is one of those things I&#x27;ve always thought about practicing and 
getting really good at.  Unlike the cube, the average person out there 
plays pool.  I don&#x27;t have to get good, I just have to get slightly 
better than the average, and just get to a point where I really 
understand the game, and know what I&#x27;m doing, and then I can... go to 
bars and hustle people, get them drunk, and walk away with their 
girlfriends.

Yeah, that was besides the point.  Anyway, glad to hear you&#x27;re coming 
to Dallas.  Dallas isn&#x27;t my city, so I don&#x27;t know where the places to 
shoot pool are.  You should have come to New York.  Macky&#x27;s mom was 
owning EVERYONE!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Leyan, Tyson,

The 30 - 40 solves would have to be fairly near the time of the 
competition, yes. As you say, if you were using an out of date 
statistic, it wouldn&#x27;t work, because people&#x27;s long term averages 
would slowly increase as they improved.

This, in my opinion, is the main stumbling block of this method, how 
would you get all the competitors to bother to time 30 or 40 solves, 
before the day of the tournament? Perhaps everyone should time as 
many cubes as they possibly can, in a practice session before the 
competition or so.

Well, I guess we will just have to see what happens on July 16th!

Dan :)

          <div class="email-content">Hey all you magic solvers,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m totally and completely new to all this.  I learned how to solve<br>
the magic just recently, and it turns out that I started timing myself<br>
before I knew the solution very well and on one of my solves my hand<br>
sort of spasmed or something and the magic went into a weird shape.<br>
<br>
I was able to get it back to the reguloar one and realign all the<br>
tiles, but now one of my strings is loose.  I only notice it after I<br>
have solved, then undo the solve back to the start.<br>
<br>
The loose string, if I am looking at the unlinked side exactly as it<br>
should look before I start the solution, is on the top row 2nd tile<br>
from the right.<br>
<br>
There are 4 diagonal rows of strings that go from the top left to the<br>
bottom right, and it is the 2nd one from the bottom, there is a metal<br>
connector thingy (go easy, I&#x27;m new to this :-) Near where this tile<br>
touches the 3rd tile from the right is where the string gets loose.<br>
<br>
If after every solve and undo I pop that string back in things seem to<br>
go fine still, but that gets old after oh... 2 solves. :-D<br>
<br>
Is there a way to fix this string without restringing completely? (I<br>
have no idea how to do that).  If that&#x27;s necessary though, is there a<br>
tutorial vid or site with pics that I can learn how to do that?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help, and please go easy on me if this explanation is<br>
more than what is needed, or if I goofed on something.  I&#x27;m a noob<br>
magic solver :-D<br>

          <div class="email-content">What exactly do you mean with &quot;it&#x27;s loose&quot;? Is it like the string is 
too long? Or does it just slip out of the groove slightly?

I have the latter problem with one of mine, but it&#x27;s not annoying 
enough to make me take it all apart. Maybe one day it will break and 
I&#x27;m gonna replace it then. I have this Darwin-like theory, survival of 
the fittest, so if a string breaks it&#x27;s actually good because this way 
you identify and remove the weak links.

considering only the best improvement done by a person
then I&#x27;ll do my worst times in the first 30 solves and
then in the real solves i&#x27;ll solve normally. So my
scores come out far better than the 30 previous ones. 

Though this looks like a good idea. Keep working on
this.

Fine, maybe two, but you can have people all do the Sunday contests?  
And just have them submit their results to both you and Jon, and for

          <div class="email-content">Yeah but that&#x27;s the problem with anything involving people.

What&#x27;s to stop me from posting an average of 15.00 on UWR list, even 
thought I&#x27;ve never been under 16? And it&#x27;s not that unbelievable 
really. But it might be a bit odd, statistically, I might post a 
fake average where all the hundredths of a second were under .50 for 
example, which is statistically very unlikely. It&#x27;s also unlikely, 
given enough cubes, that you would beat your long term average by 
more than 3 SD&#x27;s.

But yeah, I agree with you, but if people want to cheat, then 
they&#x27;re only really cheating themselves.

          <div class="email-content">So, for &quot;Team Cubing,&quot; I was under the impression that the cube didn&#x27;t <br>
have to be on the table, and that one person could hold the cube, and <br>
the other person could make moves while it was still in the other <br>
person&#x27;s hand.  The rules, in my mind, were such that one person would <br>
make a move (I think HTM was the standard) and then the other person <br>
would make a move, but there was no limitation on how you held the <br>
cube.<br>
<br>
Ian Winokur and I tried this and it was pretty ridiculous, we didn&#x27;t <br>
use the same algorithms at all.  (R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;) versus something <br>
else... which can&#x27;t remember.<br>

I think it might be time for a team Caltech :-P<br>

          <div class="email-content">Is there some prize that&#x27;s really worth it?  That&#x27;s why we can&#x27;t do 
handicap competitions as an official event because there&#x27;s no sure way 
to ensure honesty.  For non-official events, and all that other sort, 
such as Sunday contests, or speedcubing.com averages, so far, we&#x27;ve 
been relying on the honesty of the cubers, and it&#x27;s been working in my 
opinion.  There really aren&#x27;t that many doubtful records, and if 
someone lies, I personally don&#x27;t care, because your sub-14 average on 
speedcubing.com means nothing to me if I beat you in a tournament.

If you end up posting a fake average, then you waste the rest of your 
life trying to protect this lie, and trying to prevent people from 
finding out the truth.  You&#x27;re reduced to nothing more than a person 
who makes up excuses on why his times are so slow.  It&#x27;s just not worth 
it :-P

          <div class="email-content">No, of course not. Maybe you&#x27;re missing the point.

There&#x27;s no need for a handicap in speedcubing tournaments, because 
there are a lot of sub 20 cubers, and those cubers who aren&#x27;t sub20 
will have lots to aspire to, and to be honest, if they want to win, 
they&#x27;ll have to improve.

But for a small competition, where there maybe be on or two sub 
20ers, a 30, 40, and a minuter, for example, and the averages are 
spread wide, then it makes it a lot more fun for everyone involved, 
rather than just going through the motions to make the eventual, 
predictable winner.

Loose?  If it just comes out of the groove and you have to put it back
in from time to time, that&#x27;s normal (I suppose).  On my Magic, VERY
often I have to re-align strings if I went full speed because
something usually pops out of place (even more common on my Master
Magic).  If the string seems to long, I would recommend cutting it
with a razor and replacing it (you can replace any string without
removing any additional strings ;)) ...you do have extra strings don&#x27;t
you? :-P I found that the silliest thing somebody can do if they want
to get fast at the Magic is to buy only one Magic because the strings
break so easily (I discovered this when I got my first broken string
on Day 2 or 3).  I would definitely recommend a Harry Potter or
Simpson magic for spare parts (I&#x27;ve actually used more than two full
Magics full of strings to replace broken ones by now).

At least it&#x27;s not like a cube and doesn&#x27;t have to be scrambled after
EVERY solve ;)

Jaap&#x27;s page has directions on how to replace a string or even string a
Magic from scratch (which I found to be a total hassle and I don&#x27;t
plan on ever doing again ever in my life--I&#x27;d rather buy a new Magic
than ever ever go through that again!)  I actually plan on making a
quick video showing how to replace a string (it takes about 15-30
seconds for me now) :)

&quot;Mon Cube&quot; is my personnal webpage on the cube, only in French at the
moment : dutch and english versions coming soon
(http://gillesvdp.phpnet.org/cube/) (very basic design, I&#x27;m working on
a new one)
Kochonland is like a Tamagochi game, but with pigs and you have a farm
with different missions,...well, it just takes a few minutes everyday
but it&#x27;s a lot of fun :D (french version of funnypigs.com / .co.uk)

(you forgot the eBay link, directly linked to the Rubik&#x27;s category on
ebay.co.uk ;-) lol)

Fast ones completed (though a couple are a bit slower than I would
like).  They&#x27;re up at:

I&#x27;ll try to get slow ones made by the end of the weekend.

Some were really fast, but I think you should do RU2R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27; as anti-
sune alg. I do it quicker then Sune. I average 0.83 at this alg.

Yes, that is a fast alg.  I like it :-D  I think I&#x27;ll make that switch.

Maybe in stores again? There was also an American online shop 
discussed recently but they seemed to have delivery problems. Or maybe 
here:

Maybe ask them whether they still have an old one. You can also ask at 
their other sites around the world.

Btw, I just found this:

I like the faces of those kids watching :-). And hey, doesn&#x27;t the kid 
look like a young Chris Hardwick?

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been playing around with my 4x4 method the last couple of hours.  I realized I&#x27;d better start practicing, seeing as 2005 is now more than half over.  November soon approaches.  After hearing about Per&#x27;s method, I decided to give it a shot.  Here are some things I&#x27;ve noticed.

1) I can finish the 1x3x4 blocks on both sides.  If you start with two opposing centers, then add the L/D and R/D edge pairs, followed by the corner edge pairs, it&#x27;s simple and quick.

2) I think it&#x27;s easier to finish the second center group if the centers are done first.

3) This is fairly simple and intuitive.

4) I&#x27;ve found a simple commutator that does the job, but I suspect there are a couple of tricks that could come in useful.  For instance, often, I am only left with two pairs to finish.  This is easily solvable by the commutator I found, but three cycles are not.

5) Which parity do you mean?  The whole point to &#x27;edges first&#x27; solutions is to avoid the nasty parity problem, isn&#x27;t it?  In my practice, I only ran into the easy parity problem once, and never obtained the difficult case.

6) Yep.  Hooray for C(O)LL!

7) I pretty much resort to Gille&#x27;s method to orient and place edges.  Easy step.

8) This part I&#x27;m having problems with.  The only algorithm I have found for this step switches a pair of opposing center pieces.  That makes solving the final step somewhat difficult, as you might imagine.  If anyone out there has any better suggestions, please let me know.

I have just uploaded some of my notes(speedcubing/regular cubing) onto:<br>

p.s.<br>
Just sth about my cubing experience:-<br>
I started speedcubing beginning of last year. I was using 4-look LL<br>
for about a month b4 switching to Fridrich. It took me around 1 month<br>
to learn Fridrich and after that my times dropped dramatically. 5<br>
months after time zero I was averaging around 20 seconds. Then i<br>
stopped taking averages, and only solved for fun. The cube i use has a<br>
weird color scheme: white-yellow, pink-purple, green blue. Moreover,<br>
it doesn&#x27;t have springs in its axle. Probably i can get significantly<br>
faster if i switch to cubes with springs.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi friendz,<br>
<br>
Yesterday we had a nice cube meeting at Jaap Scherphuis&#x27;s place.<br>
There were 11 cubers: Lars V, Ton D, Peter J, Ruben G, Joël v N, <br>
Hans vd Z, Jaap S, Koen H, Michael F, Stefan B and me.<br>
<br>
Before dinner we had a little handicap competition and Joël beat<br>
us <br>
all by far. Averaging under 15. I haven&#x27;t practiced 3x3x3 very much <br>
recently (focused on 4x4x4), but Joël in this shape is gonna be a <br>
tough guy to beat!<br>
<br>
We also set two new fun records. But I am not sure whether they are <br>
records. Any group having done better maybe?<br>
<br>
First record:<br>
Joël and I were competing eachother on Stackmat, scrambling <br>
eachother&#x27;s cubes. There was only one cube for which we both had the <br>
same time. And that time was 12.88 seconds!<br>
<br>
Second record:<br>
Later Joël, Lars, Ton and I were competing eachother on Stackmat. <br>
For one cube the worst time of all 4 was 18.05 seconds (set by me).<br>
<br>
Great to have so many cubers living so close!<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

One problem I found with this method is too many slice moves. I Can&#x27;t
do fast slice moves for my life, but if you can do &#x27;em it could be
fast. Which commuter do you use for two edges left?

For centers, r2b2r2b2, ldl&#x27; U ld&#x27;l&#x27; U&#x27;, and r&#x27;urUr&#x27;u&#x27;d&#x27;rU&#x27;r&#x27;dr are nice.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ron,

Yes, I also enjoyed meeting all the Dutch cubers again.. It always 
gives me some more motivation.

About the records, I think our &#x27;duo-solve&#x27; record is pretty hard to 
beat, but the one with 4 cubers racing each other should be easy. I 
remember racing DanH, Lars and Michel at the German Open. I am 
pretty sure we broke 18 seconds at least once :).

Cya! ;)

Adding forum to your site is very easy. There is an
open source php scripts called phpBB which do all the
work for you. It uses MySql for storing the messages
and has a lot of advanced features. Plus its free. 

And if you want to learn php itself then the best
place would be www.php.net itself. Check the online
documentation its totally exhaustive.

And still if u face any problems feel free to ask me
:)

Onderwerp: [Speed cubing group] Ap-3 lubricant?


Hello all. I just got my new cubes from a good friend
of mine in Amsterdam.:) Now after working them for a
couple of days i am thinking of applying some lube to
it. One lube i have with me is titled as white AP-3
grease. Is it safe to apply it to my cube? And please
could you tell me what the AP-3 signifies? Does it
mean its petroleum based?

I know u all must be thinking why not use silicon
based lubes but the thing is at the shops here noone
understands what is silicone ... and when asked for a
lubricant they give this AP-3 grease. 

Please tell me. I am very afraid to damage these
cubes. 

Sachin

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

I have actually heard about ppl using olive oil as lubricant. And 
it&#x27;s supposedly quite alrite. My guess is that probably u would use 
an almost microscopic amount to make sure u don&#x27;t get oil on ur 
hands while u cube. Also i don&#x27;t know if they used the expensive 
extra virgin or plain cooking variety of the oil :-P

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Cooking oil will damage the plastic of the cube.  I believe that this
is true of all oil based products.  You should avoid Vaseline for the
same reason.

Most people prefer a silicone based lubricant (either a spray or a
gel).  And you are putting this in the cube, not eating it or inhaling
it, so it should be pretty safe.  Short term contact with the skin
while you are working with it is also harmless.

You forgot to mention which type of cube it is. That&#x27;s important.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
is there a standard practice used to denote your grip when doing a<br>
trigger?  If not can we try to think one up?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d like to be able to denote when I grab a standard grip, when you<br>
allow for say U and R turns, or U and L turns.<br>
<br>
Grips tend to hold the 2x2x3 that runs from F to B along the DL edge<br>
or DR edge, but often you can do others too.<br>
<br>
For example the Z perm holds the grip on just the FL and BL edges<br>
allowing R U D turns freely.<br>
<br>
Is there a way to denote this simply?<br>
<br>
My idea would be to have an alg and denote the grip before the triggers.<br>
<br>
such as ([grip notation here] R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) all within the<br>
parenthesis.<br>
<br>
and if you change grips you could include that with cube rotations too:<br>
(R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) x&#x27; y2 [new grip notation] (some other trigger here)<br>
<br>
What does everyone think?  I&#x27;d like to use this idea to describe<br>
notation on my site, but if one doesn&#x27;t exist and there isn&#x27;t much<br>
interest I&#x27;ll just make one up myself.  However I would greatly prefer<br>
this to be a community effort with lots of input all around.<br>

I like your little program, but it doesn&#x27;t really save me a whole 
lot of time having to typ in all of the names everytime.  I would be 
much better if it could accept a list from a text file, or better 
yet pull them right out of my sunday contest statistics spreadsheet 
(everthing needed is on the data sheet).  Or maybe even be 
incorporated into the sheet.  Thanks.

I think the best way to denote it (to be space efficient and not<br>
clutter algorithms up too much) would be to have some sort of<br>
symbolism for each group.  For example, if you are holding the 2x2x3<br>
block you described, that would be for example, &quot;A&quot;.  It should be<br>
something short and simple, but the tricky part would be to come up<br>
with something that is also related to the grip so that these symbols<br>
don&#x27;t have to be learned by brute memorization.<br>
<br>
&gt; My idea would be to have an alg and denote the grip before the triggers.<br>
&gt; <br>

<br>
I think it would certainly make learning algorithms a bit easier<br>
because it&#x27;s much easier to remember them with your hands than your<br>
brain (in my opinion, anyway).  I use slow-motion videos to show grips<br>
and triggers instead since no such notation exists.<br>

          <div class="email-content">How about giving each finger a number, or something along those lines,

somehow.  Say your fingers are numbered 1 - 5 on the left and right
hands, thumb being one.  So your left thumb could be L1  or 1L  and
your right pinky would be R5, etc.  Then naming the stickers.  Perhaps
you could use the conventional UFR, DBL, FR, etc.  where the first
letter, indicates the sticker you are touching.  So UFR is the sticker
on top of the UFR corner, but FRU is the sticker on the front of the
up front right corner.  Then combine the two, to tell where a finger
goes.  so L1F would be the left thumb on the front center, etc.

So a fairly standard grip for a right handed cuber would be:
(L1F L2BL L3B L4BD R1FR R2BUR R3BR R4BDR)

Not as brief as what Bob mentioned, but less memorizing, and its
simple to figure it out, without going to a lookup table.

The formatting can of course be different, whether its separated by
commas, or something else between finger, between hands, maybe a new
line between hands.  Just a rough idea up for criticism.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Chris,

Never heard of grip notations, but I think the grip is something 
most cubers do automatically, depending on the algorithm. When I 
scramble, I can usually ajust my grip depending on the next three 
moves. And in your example, if I have an alg with R, U and D moves, 
if won&#x27;t grab the cube at the D layer.. So I don&#x27;t really think an 
extra notation for grips is necessary.

Cya!

Joël.

Instead of (L1F L2BL...  Just make standard spots for each finger.  The first sticker note would always be L1, etc.  <br>
<br>
A standard grip would look more like (FL * BL BLD BLD FR * BR BRD BRD) where * is a finger not touching the cube.<br>
<br>
For the most common grips, I suggest a symbol or implication.  G1 or whatever you choose could be standard, and more complicated grips could be noted.  Or, you could leave it blank and make it assumed to be a standard grip.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris

Good idea!

   For algs which use F R and B I use my leftt thumb on the Up Center
and my middle finger on the Down Center.

   So using L for left and R for right and as an alternative to using
numbers which Evan suggested, you could use letters for the names T
for thumb, I for index, M for middle R for Ring and L for little (or P
for pinky.

   But maybe it would be simpler to number the common grips:
#1 LTF-LMB for Left Thumb Front (center) and Left Middle Back center.
#2 LTU-LMD for Left Thumb Up (center) and Left Middle Down center.
#3 LTL-LMR for Left Thumb Left (center) and Left Middle Right center.
#4 RTF-RMB for Right Thumb Front (center) and Right Middle Back center.
#5 RTU-RMD for Right Thumb Up (center) and Right Middle Down center.
#6 RTL-RMR for Right Thumb Left (center) and Right Middle Right center.

 ([#2] R2 B2 R F2 R&#x27; B2R F2R )

 ([#1] R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27; U2) for sune

  Slight variations may be understood to be implied, like favoring the
side that&#x27;s turning:

   Her I&#x27;m actually holding the edges under the Thumb and Middle
fingers not the centers, because I turn a side and that turning
becomes a grip.

 ([#2,6] F&#x27; L&#x27; [#6] U&#x27; L  [#3,6] U R)

David J

          <div class="email-content">The commutator I use is rU2r&#x27;  It pairs up UBl edge with the FDl edge and the UBr edge with FDr.  When the edges are in the wrong spots, just turn the top pair of to the side with U, do an M, another U turn, and do the algorithm from the opposite side of the cube.  I use this to pair up the last 3 sets of edges.  It usually only takes two, because I&#x27;ve you can often match up two pairs of edges at the same time, but two executions can solve 3 edge pairs.

Also, I ran into the hard parity problem last night and had no recourse but to resort to the very difficult algorithm I used previously.  That single algorithm takes me something along the lines of 25 seconds when executed well.  I&#x27;m very bad at executing it well.  I&#x27;m also very bad at remembering it.  I know there must be a better way to fix it for this method, but I have yet to find it.  Any suggestions?

  One problem I found with this method is too many slice moves. I Can&#x27;t
  do fast slice moves for my life, but if you can do &#x27;em it could be
  fast. Which commuter do you use for two edges left?

  For centers, r2b2r2b2, ldl&#x27; U ld&#x27;l&#x27; U&#x27;, and r&#x27;urUr&#x27;u&#x27;d&#x27;rU&#x27;r&#x27;dr are nice.

Maybe something like DLf2leOlle(*) ?

More seriously, I guess you already thought about doing more than this
with this step, for example not just orient LL-edges, but solve them
in the same time and keep four LL-corners as a last step.
Could it be an interesting option?

          <div class="email-content">For everybody who has been cubing a while, grips become natural.
Unless there is some extremely strange grip, there is no need for a
grip notation. And if there is,  use a picture.

For those who have just picked up cubing, learning a whole new
notation would be annoying and (I think) counterproductive.

Videos and pictures are a much better tool for conveying this type of
information. Even in text, finger tricks lose their &quot;punch&quot; on the
newbies because they&#x27;re not used to what they feel or look like.

This is a visual game, don&#x27;t fight it.

I have used all kinds of lubricants. Olive oil works, but it depends 
on the cube. I have actually almost ruined my studio cube, where my 
regular rubiks.com cube had no problem with the oil. It came off 
nice and later I used silicon based spray. Now I haven&#x27;t lubed my 
cube in about 5 months, and I have no trouble with it, it is still 
pretty smooth, so it&#x27;s quite amazing.
 
But don&#x27;t use the stuff they put in cars...
 
Oh yes, and I have also used body lotion, which makes your hands 
smell really nice.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I think this is an interesting idea, though maybe not very 
practical. Videos show grip better, but then they are always too 
large to download. Now if someone could just program a MacroMedia 
flash animation or Java animation of the cube and the hands 
included..... Right... That&#x27;s a bit ambitious.

Anyway, if anyone does put any special &#x27;home-grown&#x27; notation on 
their site, I want to remind them that it breaks the very handy 
usage of applets and other programs, especially my Rubik&#x27;s favelet, 
that works from right off the page.

For this purpose it is always adviced to have a &#x27;printable version&#x27; 
of your page.

P.S. I do already have highspeed internet, I&#x27;m just always complaining 
about huge pictures because it&#x27;s still a waste (and before the

You can full-quote in those forums as well. And neither here nor there 
is it necessary. Quote the parts you&#x27;re answering and leave the rest 
out. Very simple. Actually it&#x27;s simpler here than in phpBB, since I 
have to type extra [quote] and [/quote] a lot, which is very annoying.

Stefan

P.S. What happened to your forum? I must admit I didn&#x27;t bookmark it...

Ok, you got me. This is great. How do you compress them so well? IF

download all of them.

I took Bob&#x27;s slow PLL 11 video:
http://www.cubewhiz.com/pll.html

It&#x27;s 1346 KB, though. Then I imported it into Windows Movie Maker and 
saved it again, choosing the file size. I chose it as small as 
possible, still keeping the original 320x240 size but reducing to 15 
fps (it&#x27;s a slow demo video anyway, no need for 30 fps). That&#x27;s all.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I dunno, it just seems like that would be way easier than this.<br>
<br>
I agree with you 100%. I would even take the time to set it up. It&#x27;s<br>
just hard to move this group to a new forum because so many people<br>
have been here for a long time and fear the change :). Even if we<br>
tried to move the group to a new location, I think lots of people<br>
would still continue to post here, it&#x27;s just habit.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t post nearly as much as a lot of people here, but I have been<br>
reading for about 2 years. A forum would be better because it keeps<br>
all the topics in one group. I wouldn&#x27;t need to shift through a big<br>
long stream of messages to find the next/previous in a topic. It would<br>
even make it easier to see what messages you havn&#x27;t read yet. I<br>
realize that many email programs can sort the messages in an appealing<br>
way, but I happen to check the board from the internet and don&#x27;t<br>
really want all these messages coming to my inbox.<br>
<br>
I think the only way we&#x27;ll move to a new location is when Yahoo<br>
explodes and we&#x27;re all forced to move. I don&#x27;t plan on that happening<br>
any time soon, so until then, I think we&#x27;re stuck with this.<br>

administrating the forum is a piece of cake -
everything is already providied by the developers.
Also there are searching facilities, pm users and many
more things...
I would love to see a php forum for spedcubing but the
webspace i get dosent allow php scripts to run .. :( 
So i would request others who have registered
domains(Joel, Dan, etc) to try out this thing, its
really easy to setup you just need  a MySql database
additionally.

PS: Stefan you dont have to type [quote] [/quote]
everytime. theres a buton below each reply that does
the job for you.

          <div class="email-content">Bwahahahahaha.  Victory.

After much playing around with my 4x4 (read: working), I found a simple move to swap two center pieces on adjacent sides.  Using this move, coupled with r2u2r2u2, I&#x27;ve managed to solve my 4x4 with this new method.  Also, I&#x27;ve found a way around the difficult parity, but it&#x27;s intuitive and difficult.  I still think someone out there has to know a simpler way to fix this.  Anywho, November is creeping up quickly, and I&#x27;d like to be ready by then, so if Per could just share all his secrets right now, that would be great. =)

  One problem I found with this method is too many slice moves. I Can&#x27;t
  do fast slice moves for my life, but if you can do &#x27;em it could be
  fast. Which commuter do you use for two edges left?

  For centers, r2b2r2b2, ldl&#x27; U ld&#x27;l&#x27; U&#x27;, and r&#x27;urUr&#x27;u&#x27;d&#x27;rU&#x27;r&#x27;dr are nice.

I just bought some webspace that has php and mysql about 2 hours ago
so I&#x27;m going to get a phpBB forum up as soon as I get my
username/password. The URL will be http://www.strangepuzzle.com

The nice thing about forums is that their pretty easy to maintain. All
you need is a server and some users. People post and the server
serves. Not much to it.

Thank you -- that would have been perfect!  (The pre-kitchen scenes are 
great, too.)

Clock au vin (that well-known British dish) is also quite satisfactory, 
and the Rabbits should be a good starting point for a Rubik&#x27;s Game(s) 
pie...

On the swedish webpage for Rubik&#x27;s cube we use a phpBB forum that 
works fine. Of course where not that many users but it&#x27;s very easy 
to follow a thread compared to this mailing group.

Yeah, he&#x27;s just unbelievable. He has (I think at least) 20 pieces to 
memorize and that makes 4 per second. It&#x27;s amazing. He solves it very 
quick to for blindfolded solving. He must know a lot of algorithms for 
special cases.

          <div class="email-content">There are more techniques to memorize the cube than piece by piece :
you can have a photographic memory which only requires to look once at
each face to know it completely.
And then with 6 images you can build a cube inside your head and then
start to solve it.

I believe he uses a memory technique of that kind.

Yes I know. But it&#x27;s painful. Note I&#x27;m not talking about full quotes 
but selected quotes. Say I want to answer several parts of your post 
separately, i.e. alternating between your quote and my comments (which 
is not that unusual). I have to type [quote][/quote] a lot, that&#x27;s 
what I meant. I know there are two buttons for these but they&#x27;re 
useless since they add at the *end* of the text.

How can you make that sound like an advantage? Do we need more here? 
I&#x27;d rather claim the opposite.

Let&#x27;s say you have a 12-cycle for edges and an 8-cycle for corners, 
then it&#x27;s 18 pieces. And I could imagine for his record it was an 
easier (not necessarily lucky) case needing even fewer pieces.

As far as I know he uses four different algorithms.

Set up a Gmail account.  It is an excellent way to read the messages
in this group.  You can set up a filter to keep the group messages in
a separate category so they don&#x27;t clutter your inbox. Your view of the
messages has one line per topic, and topics with unread messages are
clearly marked.

I don&#x27;t really believe in that kind of thing. Just recently I read in 
a psychology book about an experiment where kids were shown an Alice 
in Wonderland picture and afterwards they were asked how many stripes 
the tail of the cat in the tree has. Surprise, surprise, there was a 
boy who got the right answer 13 and he explained that he saw the 
picture in his mind and counted. Big deal. Give me enough kids and 
I&#x27;ll certainly find one who gets it right and they probably all try to 
see it in their mind and count so when someone gets it right then that 
will be his explanation. Stupid experiment!

Tell me: With all those people who can memorize a page of a phone book 
completely and exactly in just one short look, why did none of them 
ever break a single world record for memorizing? All the records you 
can see here must make them laugh:
http://www.recordholders.org/en/records/quick-memory/quick-memory.html

I think what created this myth of photographic memory are stupid 
people misinterpreting things. Take cubing for example, very similar 
story: How often do I hear people around me whisper to each other &quot;wow 
he doesn&#x27;t even look&quot;? It mostly happens when I scramble or they even 
say it because they don&#x27;t realize I *do* look between the steps of the 
method, e.g. between OLL and PLL. They just misinterpret things and of 
course they tell others and the story begins... And consider the 
&quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cubic Compendium&quot; book in which Mr Rubik himself was involved 
so it&#x27;s kinda official. Chapter 6 is about photographic memory and 
stuff and the author ends by saying &quot;And he did not even look at it&quot; 
after describing how he saw a guy twist a cube in a train without 
looking at the cube. The chapter though makes it so obvious that the 
author is a non-cuber and probably has no clue about it so I claim he 
was probably wrong (yes I know blindsolving is possible but I hear the 
&quot;he doesn&#x27;t even look&quot; much more often when I scramble than when I 
actually blindsolve).

Another myth is extreme speedreading. Tony Buzan, a guy well-known for 
memorizing/speedreading/mindmapping books (though I don&#x27;t like him 
very much because I&#x27;m convinced he makes up lots of the &quot;facts&quot; he 
claims in his books) writes in his speedreading book about a girl who 
could read 416,250 words per minute if she could only flip the pages 
fast enough. Assuming average word length of 5 letters and 60*60 
letters fitting on one page that&#x27;s 9.6 pages per second! And she&#x27;s 
supposed to know everything perfectly then. Apart from the speed 
itself, I&#x27;d like to ask again why she doesn&#x27;t simply shatter the 
speedreading world records (yes there are even world championships). 
And why 416,250? How can they find out so exactly? Why did Tony not 
mention any details about how it was measured?

> I believe he uses a memory technique of that kind.

As far as I know he doesn&#x27;t.

I claim that&#x27;s not the fault of the system but the choice of our 
moderators. Go here:

http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/polls

It says it&#x27;s not accessible. But it&#x27;s known! And if you click on 
&quot;Polls Help&quot; on the upper right and then &quot;How do I restrict access to 
this feature?&quot; on the lower right, the description makes it sound like 
this feature is just turned off for us non-moderators.

So I&#x27;d say you blame the wrong people ;-)

I do use and like phpBB forums, too. Well, mostly the twistypuzzles 
one. There are several other things that annoy me much more than the 
quote issue and they all have to do with long loading times. Have a 
look at this thread (and my posting in it):

Are you serious? I&#x27;m certainly not gonna type the quote, it ought to 
be copied from the original message.

That bugs me, too. Though it&#x27;s just a coincidence that this group 
doesn&#x27;t search further, it has nothing to do with &quot;this type of 
group&quot;. And maybe the search range can actually be extended (by the 
moderators)?

Ok, gotta admit I found the explanation. They made a test and she read 
1390 words in a fifth of a second. Somehow I wonder though how they 
measured so exactly, but it explains the huge number since 
1390*5*60=417000. Of course it&#x27;s slightly off so they must&#x27;ve actually 
measured 0.20036 seconds. Btw, she&#x27;s Russian and the scientists 
testing her are Russian, too. Not that I have anything against them, 
but I don&#x27;t necessarily trust everything that comes from Russia, 
especially if it&#x27;s something spectacular. And unfortunately Tony 
didn&#x27;t bother to mention when this happened (the text makes it sound 
like it wasn&#x27;t too long ago, though). And he only provides her first 
name Eugenia. I tried to find out any more details about her on the 
web but I&#x27;ve been unsuccessful.

Summary: This kind of stuff are myths, stories that people just made 
up to impress other people or they misinterpreted things they don&#x27;t 
understand. And then they tell someone who tells someone else and so 
on and on and numbers get bigger and bigger and more and more 
specatular.

Ok, one more thing about this. Even though it&#x27;s technically correct to 
say her reading speed is 417000 words per minute when she can read 
1390 words in a fifth of a second, it&#x27;s completely misleading. The 
duration must be mentioned, too, otherwise someone who reads it will 
tell someone else that the girl read 417000 words in one minute which 
she didn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s exactly one of the ways these myths are created.

Fair enough. We could set the message limit to 15 or so per page. That<br>
sounds reasonable. I believe there are phpbb mods available that allow<br>
a user to select if he/she wants to view avatars, but if not we could<br>
just take vote to see how many people really want avatars and possibly<br>
disable them globally.<br>
<br>
As for the reverse thread option, phpbb has sorting options at the<br>
bottom of each thread.<br>

I&#x27;m just trying to make this sound appealing to everyone ;)<br>

When I started this group it was a yahoo club, before there were even<br>

when things converted over to groups a couple years later that option<br>

This kind of thing becomes more credible when the person has a high 
level of knowledge/skill (genius even) in the relevant area.  E.g. 
Mozart writing down the score of a piece (how long?) after a single 
hearing: presumably the &quot;patterns&quot; he knew made this easy for him.

Similarly with chess players doing simultaneous blindfold displays: I 
doubt that they need to make artificial associations like &quot;black 
queen on a4&quot; = &quot;Donald Duck eating ketchup and fries&quot; to keep the 
various games in mind.

I also doubt that J.B.O. makes up a lengthy story in 5sec, even if he 
is still associating artificial images with the cube pieces.  Perhaps 
we&#x27;ll find out someday what he really does.

And so they should.  Don&#x27;t they make you laugh?  Cubing is funny, 
too, of course.

Vaguely recall that Marvin Minsky claimed to have investigated a 
number of these cases.  He decided they were all untrue, but he was 
probably trying to &quot;prove&quot; some equally dubious point.  (Where did he 
write about it, though?)

It does indeed sound like something from the old Soviet school.

Old joke: &quot;I took a speed reading course and read &#x27;War and Peace&#x27; in 
twenty minutes. It involves Russia.&quot; (W. Allen)

Yeah, just... don&#x27;t bring up the music topic with me... Supposedly, 
Berlioz wrote the whole Symphonie Fantastique in one night, which gives 
a rate of something in the order of 10 notes/sec if you consider he 
started writing at, say, 6PM and stopped at 9AM. Which is, not 
possible... That&#x27;s one of these myths...
Also, I became quite expert in the field of Russian composers and more 
specifically Shostakovitch. Anyway, it is said (and I have reasons to 
believe it is true, actually no musician I know ever doubted that) that 
he was sitting in a pub one day with his friend and conductor and 
composer Nikolai Malko. Back then, there was one very popular song all 
over the world called &quot;Tea for Two&quot; (excerpt from &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; by 
Vincent Youman). I know everyone here knows that song even if the title 
doesn&#x27;t ring a bell, especially the French members of that group (vous 
vous souvenez, &quot;la Grande Vadrouille&quot;, avec de Funï¿½s et Bourvil et bien 
d&#x27;autres encore? le truc qu&#x27;il siffle dans les bains turcs, et bah c&#x27;est 
ï¿½a...) Anyway, Shosta said to Malko, &quot;come on, that thing sucks I bet I 
can orchestrate it in less than one hour&quot; (well I guess that&#x27;s not the 
way he said it,especially cuz both of them didn&#x27;t speak one word of 
English back then) so they sat down in the pub, ordered a vodka and 
started to write it. 40 minutes later Shosta was done, with a brilliant 
orchestration I still can&#x27;t believe someone wrote anything so cool. I 
think Malko was done about 30 minutes later, I&#x27;ve never heard his 
version of it anyway, but a while later, Shosta took that music again, 
thought it would be cool to insert it after the 3rd act of his ballett 
&quot;the golden Age&quot;. Too bad for him, the only piece of that ballet that 
was &quot;encored&quot; every evening was that one piece, which doesn&#x27;t have 
anything to do with the rest of the ballet anyway.
that was just my last ï¿½0.02 before taking the plane tomorrow and 
switching to plain US$... Oh, and yeah, that post was totally 
inadequate, yeah... just felt like spending 10 mins on it instead of 
packing my stuff d&#x27;oh.
Oh and if anyone wants to do something, I&#x27;ll be in the Detroit, MI, area 
between tomorrow evening and next Wednesday. Won&#x27;t have a chance to 
drive very far from home though. Drop me a line (Jon I don&#x27;t forget you 
maybe planned something, just tell me before next wednesday if you can)

That&#x27;s a good one.  But perhaps he /composed/ it in his head one night

          <div class="email-content">Hi Mike,

  There was a long thread on this a while ago. I&#x27;m not about to try to
search for it, but Chris mentioned that mathematically parity boils
down to 1 quarter turn. I demonstrated that it was true, but I took 64
moves. Chris takes 15.

   Anyway, if you solve the Right and Left sides, with or without
bothering with any of the Up edges, you can check for parity. If you
have a parity problem you make one vertical slice quarter turn, then
solve the rest with even-numbered moves.

Cheers,

David J

new method.  Also, I&#x27;ve found a way around the difficult parity, but
it&#x27;s intuitive and difficult.  I still think someone out there has to
know a simpler way to fix this.  Anywho, November is creeping up
quickly, and I&#x27;d like to be ready by then, so if Per could just share
all his secrets right now, that would be great. =)

Try typing [quote] [/quote], select them, hit control c, and then
inset them at the beginning of the part you want to quote. Then select
[/quote] and drag it to the end of what you are quoting. It&#x27;s a lot
faster than typing. YOu can insert and drag many times.

Well, what I basically meant, was that with all the quoting, it 
wouldn&#x27;t get such a mess, even if people &#x27;full quote&#x27; (like you call 
it) on a PHPBB forum (like the mess above :)). 

I tried to setup some forums, some on free hosts, and also on the 
free webspace my university provided to me, but that was just to 
test out the possibilities.

I don&#x27;t really believe in that kind of thing. Just recently I read in 
a psychology book about an experiment where kids were shown an Alice 
in Wonderland picture and afterwards they were asked how many stripes 
the tail of the cat in the tree has. Surprise, surprise, there was a 
boy who got the right answer 13 and he explained that he saw the 
picture in his mind and counter. Big deal. Give me enough kids and 
I&#x27;ll certainly find one who gets it right and they probably all try to 
see it in their mind and count so when someone gets it right then that 
will be his explanation. Stupid experiment!

Tell me: With all those people who can memorize a page of a phone book 
completely and exactly in just one short look, why did none of them 
ever break a single world record for memorizing? All the records you 
can see here must make them laugh:
http://www.recordholders.org/en/records/quick-memory/quick-memory.html

I think what created this myth of photographic memory are stupid 
people misinterpreting things. Take cubing for example, very similar 
story: How often do I hear people around me whisper to each other &quot;wow 
he doesn&#x27;t even look&quot;? It mostly happens when I scramble or they even 
say it because they don&#x27;t realize I *do* look between the steps of the 
method, e.g. between OLL and PLL. They just misinterpret things and of 
course they tell others and the story begins... And consider the 
&quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cubic Compendium&quot; book in which Mr Rubik himself was involved 
so it&#x27;s kinda official. Chapter 6 is about photographic memory and 
stuff and the author ends by saying &quot;And he did not even look at it&quot; 
after describing how he saw a guy twist a cube in a train without 
looking at the cube. The chapter though makes it so obvious that the 
author is a non-cuber and probably has no clue about it so I claim he 
was probably wrong (yes I know blindsolving is possible but I hear the 
&quot;he doesn&#x27;t even look&quot; much more often when I scramble than when I 
actually blindsolve).

Another myth is extreme speedreading. Tony Buzan, a guy well-known for 
memorizing/speedreading/mindmapping books (though I don&#x27;t like him 
very much because I&#x27;m convinced he makes up lots of the &quot;facts&quot; he 
claims in his books) writes in his speedreading book about a girl who 
could read 416,250 words per minute if she could only flip the pages 
fast enough. Assuming average word length of 5 letters and 60*60 
letters fitting on one page that&#x27;s 9.6 pages per second! And she&#x27;s 
supposed to know everything perfectly then. Apart from the speed 
itself, I&#x27;d like to ask again why she doesn&#x27;t simply shatter the 
speedreading world records (yes there are even world championships). 
And why 416,250? How can they find out so exactly? Why did Tony not 
mention any details about how it was measured?

> I believe he uses a memory technique of that kind.

As far as I know he doesn&#x27;t.

actually blindsolve).

Another myth is extreme speedreading. Tony Buzan, a guy well-known for 
memorizing/speedreading/mindmapping books (though I don&#x27;t like him 
very much because I&#x27;m convinced he makes up lots of the &quot;facts&quot; he 
claims in his books) writes in his speedreading book about a girl who 
could read 416,250 words per minute if she could only flip the pages 
fast enough. Assuming average word length of 5 letters and 60*60 
letters fitting on one page that&#x27;s 9.6 pages per second! And she&#x27;s 
supposed to know everything perfectly then. Apart from the speed 
itself, I&#x27;d like to ask again why she doesn&#x27;t simply shatter the 
speedreading world records (yes there are even world championships). 
And why 416,250? How can they find out so exactly? Why did Tony not 
mention any details about how it was measured?

> I believe he uses a memory technique of that kind.

As far as I know he doesn&#x27;t.

Hello Pedro,
The most widely used applet in my opinion is the Rubik

Get it fro here :

Ok, gotta admit I found the explanation. They made a test and she read 
1390 words in a fifth of a second. Somehow I wonder though how they 
measured so exactly, but it explains the huge number since 
1390*5*60=417000. Of course it&#x27;s slightly off so they must&#x27;ve actually 
measured 0.20036 seconds. Btw, she&#x27;s Russian and the scientists 
testing her are Russian, too. Not that I have anything against them, 
but I don&#x27;t necessarily trust everything that comes from Russia, 
especially if it&#x27;s something spectacular. And unfortunately Tony 
didn&#x27;t bother to mention when this happened (the text makes it sound 
like it wasn&#x27;t too long ago, though). And he only provides her first 
name Eugenia. I tried to find out any more details about her on the 
web but I&#x27;ve been unsuccessful.

Summary: This kind of stuff are myths, stories that people just made 
up to impress other people or they misinterpreted things they don&#x27;t 
understand. And then they tell someone who tells someone else and so 
on and on and numbers get bigger and bigger and more and more 
specatular.

          <div class="email-content">Memory is a muscle and it is trained.  The reason why we find this so 
incredible is because we are cubers and for blindfold solving, it 
hasn&#x27;t come to the point where memory has become an issue.  Now, I 
don&#x27;t really think that Bernett is special.  We, as speed cubers, just 
simply haven&#x27;t trained our memories.  I don&#x27;t know if 8 second 
memorization is possible for us, as my father isn&#x27;t an international 
grand master, but I do believe with practice and dedication, 15 to 20 
second memorization should be possible.  After that, I&#x27;ll just have to 
rely on my speed cubing speed for my competitive edge.

          <div class="email-content">This whole debate reminds me of the debate about stackmats and Rubik&#x27;s timers.  One is used because it has been, but the other is obviously more natural to the task at hand.  Some wish to stay out of familiarity, others for lack of effort.  I personally vote to switch, so long as there is still an option to receive the messages via email.  I think one of the main benefits of php style forums, other than the fabulous organization, is the ability to watch various threads that interest you.  I mean, sure, everyone loves hearing about cooking your cube with potatoes, but some of us have already had dinner for the night. ; )<br>

Maybe his parents played it all the time when he was a baby or even

Not sure I like that comparison ;-) My reason I prefer stackmat is 
that I think it&#x27;s better. If you want it more natural, please don&#x27;t 
preinspect.

One more reason that kept me here in this forum: fear. I do trust Joel

I&#x27;d rather switch to a host that has already proven safety.

I like the variety in that the messages are from all different

discussion flows since you forget what was going on a week before. 
You don&#x27;t lose important messages if you bookmark, or just remember
what month it was in.  Of course I do admit a forum makes it easier to
search, it is a pain to find a message where I can&#x27;t remember when it
was posted.

Of course others don&#x27;t like the group for the very same reasons that I
like it, so these are just my two cents really.

I am in favor of the yahoo layout, and I use solely the website to
read this group.  Plus I&#x27;m kind of biased towards the group for
obvious reasons lol, so maybe my argument isn&#x27;t the best one to listen to.

Indeed I didn&#x27;t know it until now... I guess I&#x27;d trust that forum 
since Ron has been running SCC quite successfully :-)

Not sure about the &quot;more formal&quot; issue. Does that mean we shall not 
digress into talking about music etc?

One problem I just noticed: Even if I&#x27;m convinced some forum is much 
better and would want to switch, I might still post to this group just 
because all the people are still here and only very few on the other 
(at least on the WCA this is true right now). We&#x27;d maybe need to have 
two things: (1) strong advertisement about the new forum so that 
everybody knows it and then (2) shut down this group ;-)

I admit I didn&#x27;t know that, but it&#x27;s useless. It&#x27;s only for the 
current thread and doesn&#x27;t even remember that, so next time I visit 
the same thread it has already forgotton my choice. Note I asked for 
this because if each page contains 10 posts and there are 21 posts and 
I want to see the newest two posts then they&#x27;re on separate pages 
(pages 2 and 3). I&#x27;d rather have the ten newest posts on page 1.

Yeah, the flow is nice. I think one of the reasons I don&#x27;t have much 
problems with this group is that I&#x27;m here quite often and participate 
in a few threads so I&#x27;m actively involved which makes it easier to 
&quot;follow&quot; the discussions...

  Hey all,<br>
<br>
     Does anyone know how many different algorithms it is to solve the last layer of a pocket cube in one algorithm? Also does anyone know where I can get a list of these to learn if the number is not that large (Can&#x27;t memorize 1211 algs like the 3x3x3).<br>

  Hi Alberto,

  that sounds quite strange... how can you have email but no web?

So what I was trying to say with respect to that was that email is an<br>

control how emails are accessed, authored, rendered ...<br>
<br>
As an example, I like to use an advanced writing tool called &quot;vim&quot; for<br>
all of my writing needs (reports, emails, Yahoo! messages, etc.) that<br>
doubles my efficiency. The sole reason I am able to use vim with Yahoo!<br>

many power tools can interoperate.<br>

12 cases for adjacent swaps/3-cycles
    -27 if you count inverses and mirrors
7 cases for when corners are to be swapped diagonally
    -10 if you count inverses and mirrors

Thus I think 24 algs to memorize in total (if you are ok

46 distinct cases in total....

&gt; Ok, gotta admit I found the explanation. They made a test and she read <br>
&gt; 1390 words in a fifth of a second.<br>
<br>
This is not so unbelievable to me. I mean, I don&#x27;t believe that she can<br>
read 1390 words in 1/5th of a second, but I do think it is possible to<br>
take a brain photograph of 1390 words in 1/5th of a second, then close<br>
your eyes and read back what it says in the photograph. It seems to me<br>
that the process of reading is computationally more expensive than the<br>
process of merely taking a photograph. In a sense, the process of taking<br>
a photograph uses a pre-computed image (thanks universe) which is simply<br>
projected into your memory, while the process of reading involves a huge<br>
amount of analysis to determine the meaning/sense. Many people do find<br>
that they can stare at a picture, close their eyes and -- for a short<br>
moment -- see an impression of the picture in their mind&#x27;s eye, without<br>
much computational effort at all.<br>
<br>
Then how is it that some people can supposedly see the impression<br>
clearer and for longer than others? It seems to me that this is because<br>
those people use more computational effort looking for the key points<br>
that would help to sustain the impression. This may be conscious or<br>
subconscious.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t have well developed brain photo skills at all, but I do have a<br>
similar ability to make brain recordings of sounds. This was developed<br>
from a young age (at a subconscious level), and later, as I became more<br>
analytical, I became aware of how my brain was actually doing it.<br>
<br>
Relating back to photography vs. reading, I discovered I am much better<br>
at hearing than listening. That is, I can hear and record a sound signal<br>
instantly, and play it back in my head as many times as I wish, but some<br>
times it takes me a while to analyse the sound and realise that someone<br>
is trying to talk to me :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">When speedreading in a way where you take in a whole page at the time,<br>
you will not remember much instantly, but your brain will process what<br>
you have &quot;seen&quot;, so in a short time you will remember and comprehend<br>
about as much as a person that read the text in &quot;normal&quot; speed. <br>
<br>
So when someone &quot;read&quot; 1390 words in 1/5 of a second, they do in fact<br>
take a brain photagraph, but the brain process the info as well, so a<br>
person with very good skills will remember the info &quot;scanned&quot;, not<br>
reading back from the &quot;scanned&quot; image.<br>
<br>
But as Stefan said, the fact that she can read 1390 words in a fifth of<br>
a second, does not mean that she can read or comprehend 416,250 words a<br>
minute. Even if Afasa Powell ran 100 meter in 9.77 seconds, he can not<br>
run 10000 meter in 977 seconds. Even the brain gets tired, right ? :)<br>

<br>
When speedreading in a way where you take in a whole page at the time,<br>
you will not remember much instantly, but your brain will process what<br>
you have &quot;seen&quot;, so in a short time you will remember and comprehend<br>
about as much as a person that read the text in &quot;normal&quot; speed. <br>
<br>
So when someone &quot;read&quot; 1390 words in 1/5 of a second, they do in fact<br>
take a brain photagraph, but the brain process the info as well, so a<br>
person with very good skills will remember the info &quot;scanned&quot;, not<br>
reading back from the &quot;scanned&quot; image.<br>
<br>
But as Stefan said, the fact that she can read 1390 words in a fifth of<br>
a second, does not mean that she can read or comprehend 416,250 words a<br>
minute. Even if Afasa Powell ran 100 meter in 9.77 seconds, he can not<br>
run 10000 meter in 977 seconds. Even the brain gets tired, right ? :)<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; Ok, gotta admit I found the explanation. They made a test and she read<br>
<br>
&gt; 1390 words in a fifth of a second.<br>
<br>
This is not so unbelievable to me. I mean, I don&#x27;t believe that she can<br>
read 1390 words in 1/5th of a second, but I do think it is possible to<br>
take a brain photograph of 1390 words in 1/5th of a second, then close<br>
your eyes and read back what it says in the photograph. It seems to me<br>
that the process of reading is computationally more expensive than the<br>
process of merely taking a photograph. In a sense, the process of taking<br>
a photograph uses a pre-computed image (thanks universe) which is simply<br>
projected into your memory, while the process of reading involves a huge<br>
amount of analysis to determine the meaning/sense. Many people do find<br>
that they can stare at a picture, close their eyes and -- for a short<br>
moment -- see an impression of the picture in their mind&#x27;s eye, without<br>
much computational effort at all.<br>
<br>
Then how is it that some people can supposedly see the impression<br>
clearer and for longer than others? It seems to me that this is because<br>
those people use more computational effort looking for the key points<br>
that would help to sustain the impression. This may be conscious or<br>
subconscious.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t have well developed brain photo skills at all, but I do have a<br>
similar ability to make brain recordings of sounds. This was developed<br>
from a young age (at a subconscious level), and later, as I became more<br>
analytical, I became aware of how my brain was actually doing it.<br>
<br>
Relating back to photography vs. reading, I discovered I am much better<br>
at hearing than listening. That is, I can hear and record a sound signal<br>
instantly, and play it back in my head as many times as I wish, but some<br>
times it takes me a while to analyse the sound and realise that someone<br>
is trying to talk to me :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well these COLL algs are great to learn for other reasons but when 
it comes to the 2x2, lowing the restriction to preserve edge 
orientation does lower the average number of moves.

Thus CLL would be faster.

          <div class="email-content">Well summarised, Ryan.

I use both email and the web interface to access this group. For
reading messages, I prefer email. I synchronise email to my iPAQ every
day and catch up on messages from this group on the train to/from work
(although not doing such things on the train this morning for obvious
reasons - if you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about, check out any
major news site and you&#x27;ll see what happened in London this morning).

For posting messages I generally use the web interface. I could do
this from email, but I like to log on to the site every now and then.

Re clogging up your email inbox - just set up another email address
for messages from this group (this is what I have done), or use a
filter - very easy options. Also, I have zillions of spare Gmail
invitations and I&#x27;m happy to send them to anyone who wants one.

Re moving, I would be very happy to move to any forum that satisfied
Ryan&#x27;s three criteria.

The layout there is far too &quot;metal/motif&quot; for me. It&#x27;s not really 
delicate. I quite like the layout here at Yahoo Groups. Disadvantage 
here is of coz that all the posts are entering a hotchpotch. Some 
more structure would be nice :-) Being able to read and post by 
using email is advantageous for many ppl. So i guess the perfect 
group/bbs/forum does not exist yet. Apart from the lack of structure 
here at Yahoo i think i would prefer not to move :-) And this group 
(and others here at Yahoo) are well established. I can&#x27;t see there 
is a pressing reason to move it...

Cheers!

-Per

PS! These yahoo groups have many features not actively used like 
calendar and option to create databases. Maybe the moderators can 
tell us how much available space the groups have. Since the yahoo 
email has had an increased quota i assume the same goes for the

The current version of this group using yahoo group works well I think.
Now if the GoogleGroup has something very useful the the YahooGroups
don&#x27;t have, why not. But basically I don&#x27;t see any differences...

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re trying to fragment the groups up.  I want to have
a single forum for everyone to use, but have it be an actual forum,
not a Yahoo Group or Google group.  the Yahoo group works okay....but
it could be so much better.  my main problem with this, like I&#x27;ve
stated a few times before, is that you cannot search through previous
posts.  I have a few I would love to go back and reread, they were
very helpful and informative, but they&#x27;re lost in the archives
somewhere and the search takes forever to find anything about it.
a forum you can search through the entire archive of threads, or even
just all the threads in a single topic, such as blindfold cubing or
one handed or something.  makes it much, much easier to find things.

Absolutely.  If this group (or rather, its administrators) want to move 
elsewhere, I&#x27;ll follow.  But, please, no more groups, unless they serve 
a well-defined subset of us or our interests (like the FMC and BLD 
groups, Twisty, and Cube Lovers 2).

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Reading over my last post I don&#x27;t want it to seem like I&#x27;m <br>
completely against forums, though I really don&#x27;t get excited at the <br>
idea of having this group on a forum over the current setup.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve heard some suggestions to shut down this group in order to <br>
facilitate this.  Only Ron and I can do that, and speaking for <br>
myself I would only do that if:<br>
<br>
1) We were able to archive all the messages that haven&#x27;t been lost <br>
(we did lose about a year&#x27;s worth of message when clubs converted to <br>
forums) and make them very easily viewable and searchable for anyone <br>
who wants to.<br>
<br>
2) We make sure that everyone on this group has lots of ways of <br>
finding out that the forum is moving.  And even then I think this <br>
forum should stay open long enough to let stragglers know (a year, <br>
or at least several months).  We can make it so that joining the <br>
group requires moderator approval, and Ron and I could simply not <br>
approve anyone who applies, but rather send them to the other forum.<br>
<br>
3) e-mail access to post and read messages is maintained on the new <br>
forum for all users who prefer this.<br>
<br>
4) Any other criteria that I have left out in this post but that <br>
most people would not agree to losing.  I&#x27;m not flexible on the <br>
first 3, but am willing to add more criteria.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------<br>
<br>
To be very clear, I absolutely do not want to move this group to a <br>
forum.  I really like the current setup, and from experience it has <br>
taken a VERY long time to build up the number of members we have <br>
right now.  However, having said that if enough people do want to <br>
move I am willing to consider helping provided the above criteria <br>
are completely satisfied.  I say &quot;consider&quot; because Ron and I are <br>
the main co-moderators (with Doug Li helping with messages and other <br>
moderator things of course :-D ), and I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t act without <br>
consulting him first.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, Gmail is great.  It archives all your mail for you, so you can
search through previous posts, and it groups messages together with
the same subject line, so all messages from one discussion are in one
place and you can easily look at any one you want.  And, I&#x27;ve heard,
that if you somehow actualy reach the limit for space they offer,
instead of not letting you get more emails, it just says something
along the lines of &quot;your inbox is 104% full&quot;.

So if anyone is interested just ask someone with a Gmail account, we
have 50 invites each.

Amen! I created a forum because I didn&#x27;t know the wca had one. I
wanted to let people see what a phpbb forum looks like for those of
you who haven&#x27;t used one in the past. I was simply providing an
example of something we *could* use. An alternate plan. If people here
don&#x27;t want to move to a php forum, then we won&#x27;t. I find this Yahoo
group perfectly usable and it obviously suits everyone&#x27;s needs.

A forum would be better organized for those of us that access the
group from the web. that&#x27;s a fact. if the convience of email delivery
is more important to most users then organzation, then we must stay
here! I would rather not move to another email-based group because it
offers very little over what we have now.

I can always make the phpbb forum available if the desire is there.
I&#x27;m just offering my webspace and bandwidth. I&#x27;m not trying to
convince anyone to move.

          <div class="email-content">I have been keeping up with this topic. I highly agree with Chris on 
how it takes a lot of time to earn as many members as we have.

I also use many of the more advanced forums out there. I don&#x27;t find 
the benefits of those to outweight the effort needed to convert. And 
I&#x27;m sure that would end up forcing people to learn a bunch of phpBB 
stuff that they might not otherwise need. Though I&#x27;m not a member I 
regularly check the twisty forum for example.

I found that using gmail was a great way of viewing this group&#x27;s 
posts as several people have mentioned.

Frankly, I think that direct suggustions to shut down this fourm is 
sort of heresy.

That reminds me, it really sucks that we lost like a years worth of 
posts...

Anyhow, those three criteria are pretty reasonable I think.

And for the record, I&#x27;m only a moderator officially, all I do is 
delete spam every now and then and am not around during the academic 
year. So Chris and Ron really don&#x27;t need to consult me for anything. 
Though when I am around, I tend to be pretty active, when it comes 
to actual cubing methodology, I am very opinionated (sometimes too 
much) due to my experience.

I&#x27;m getting way past my prime when it comes to speedcubing. I think 
after the next WC, I&#x27;ll retire and start being a tournament runner 
like Tyson (but for the Midwest) and try for a position on WCA.

Cubing is starting to drive me insane, and I fear I&#x27;m getting about 
a second slower after every passing year... today my JNet average 
was 24.09s. *sigh* (and it&#x27;s so hopeless too, oh dear god I suck)

OK, let&#x27;s take a moment to consider the LOGISTICS of it!!! Trying to 
get hundreds of members to switch? Any guesses as to how long that 
would take?

I know our setup is far from being the best, I hate the ads, the 
loading times aren&#x27;t spectacular, the lack of editing, the plain-
ness of it all, the inability to control spam (if you have it sent 
to your e-mail instead of just reading it here), ..., but it feels 
like home :). I say keep it simple, don&#x27;t split the posts into all 
these new forums. Besides for more specilized things, there are 
already other groups/fourms for, I check the Petrus group, the 
Caltech group, and a few others too.

I know some of you (especially those CS inclined) are ambitious 
enough to take on building a fourm (already see a few nice ones 
popping up). But take these 3 criteria as added challenges, mainly 
transfering the old posts. Realize that you need Chris&#x27;s support, 
not many cubers out there command as much respect as he does, and if 
he says no, your definately out of luck.

It better be a damn good phpBB forum for us to gamble all our chips 
on... if we do end up seriously considering (I&#x27;d need to see all the 
old posts populated in first of course).

Can you do it? Has someone demonstrated it to you? If so, please share 
some details.

I just found another article:
http://www.execuread.com/press_media.htm

Quote:
&quot;[...] read a 30 000 word book about Albert Einstein in 12s. Following 
that, she wrote a comprehension test and scored 95%.&quot;

Depending on the book layout, that might be about 10 pages per second. 
Yeah ok I admit even I can flip the pages of a book that fast.

My main argument is still this one: Of all those people (you&#x27;ll easily 
find lots of reports of many people achieving things like that), why 
does not a single one of them ever go to a competition? They would 
completely SHATTER the existing world records. It&#x27;d be like a 10 
meters tall basketball player in the NBA.

Ok I don&#x27;t have current world records but here&#x27;s a report from 2001:
http://www.msoworld.com/Press/Releases/MSO5day3.html

It says &quot;46012 words in a under 21 minutes&quot;. And I do believe that. 
Why? Not because I can get even close to that myself or have seen 
someone else doing it, but simply because it was an official and 
well-known competition. Why does this other woman not just go there 
and beat 21 minutes with 19 seconds? I mean, hello-o! Why don&#x27;t *any* 
of those numerous geniuses go there? Don&#x27;t tell me they&#x27;re too shy or 
too decent or whatever. I&#x27;ll tell you why: cause they&#x27;re too lying.

Yeah, I just wanted to ask the same question. That&#x27;s cause I wanted to 
point out last week they had 991 members (we have 1174) and I&#x27;m sure 
they started much later. Also, if we &quot;move&quot; somewhere else then I&#x27;d 
say we&#x27;ll build up hundreds of members almost instantly. Well, at 
least I&#x27;d guess all the active members would go there quite soon.

Haha, I just realized that it won&#x27;t raise the cap if you make the 
paper smaller. Stupid me ;-) And of course you don&#x27;t need a cross, a 
rectangle that fixes two opposite sides does a good job, too. I 
wouldn&#x27;t recommend a square to fix all four sides, cause its corners 
will not nicely fold and might clutter up, but maybe that&#x27;d actually 
be a good thing. Yeah, whatever...

Sorry, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s similar. Unless you mean you can 
record the sound of 1000 words in a second.

Also, if we stay, some users might not particularly love the layout,  
but we won&#x27;t lose many (or any) because of this.

If we move, we will lose a LOT of members - that&#x27;s just what happens...

          <div class="email-content">Hmm ...

Which 2 edges are u swapping and calling &quot;parity&quot; ?

And for the centers have u considered this one :

(lr&#x27;)d2(l&#x27;r)U&#x27;(lr&#x27;)d2(l&#x27;r)U

It looks longish but it&#x27;s actually ony 8 moves counted with the 
Hardwick metric ;-) And besides u can sorta fingertrick at least the 
(l&#x27;r) &quot;slice move&quot; :-)

Alrite my idea for swapping 2 edges easily is as follows. Turn an 
inner slice layer a quarter turn. Then cycle 3 edges on this layer 
so that u get 2 swapped edges. It messes with edges for sure. U 
might want to use Chris algorithm : R2 (u&#x27;R2)*5 instead of a simple 
u turn. Now u for sure know how to swap any 2 edges easily. U can 
use this idea only if u do centers last, or else somehow &quot;absorb&quot; 
the side effect on the centers.

Cheers!

-Per

PS!
Also have a look at  : (lr&#x27;)d2(l&#x27;r)U&#x27;D&#x27;(lr&#x27;)d2(l&#x27;r)UD
And alrite also this : r&#x27;(ud&#x27;)rU2r&#x27;(u&#x27;d)rU2

U want more rabbits? 

There are quite a few edge-rabbits too. Most simply involve cycling 
blocks around :-) They are easily performed but require some 
experience to see when to utilise them.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone, <br>
<br>
I recently received an e-mail from a guy Patrick Ludden who needs a<br>
speedcubing coach for an actor in a movie being filmed in San Francisco.<br>
<br>
&gt;From what he was saying the actor is fairly poplar and would want to<br>
&quot;talk tech&quot; with a speedcuber to get a feel for it and also for how to<br>
solve the cube quickly.<br>
<br>
The solve will be prepared of course and needs to be done in<br>
&quot;something like ten quick moves&quot;.  The scene involves an actor in a<br>
cab egged on by a friend to solve the cube, which he &quot;does quickly&quot;.<br>
<br>
There is also the possibility of using a hands double, but it seems<br>
more likely that the actor will do the solve.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t want to post this guy&#x27;s e-mail address publicly, but e-mail me<br>

you in contact with him.  Remember to delete the [nospam] when you<br>

users for online racing, so I think I&#x27;m going to start working on it.<br>
I&#x27;m not sure of the programming language I&#x27;m going to use, but I will<br>
promise to use another multiplatform language whether that may be<br>
java, perl, or even web-based like html or php.<br>
<br>
I have a little free time now after work so I&#x27;m going to investigate<br>
the best plan of action and get started!<br>
<br>
My question to you guys is: What features do you want?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m going to incorperate the standard things like average, fastest<br>
time, slowest time, scramble, countdown, .... I just want to make sure<br>
there&#x27;s nothing huge that people want because that would require an<br>
overhaul :) I want to get things right the first time.<br>
<br>
I hope to support an unlimited amount of users (the max amount to be<br>
set by the server) and to make the project dedicated server based. I<br>
can have a dedicated server constantly running at a specified URL<br>
(probably strangpuzzle.com) and have everyone just connect to the<br>
server and start a &#x27;race room&#x27;. People could just connect to the room<br>
and race away with X amount of people. Does this sound like something<br>
people would use? I going to make it even if people don&#x27;t want it :)<br>
but I figured I&#x27;d ask first too.<br>
<br>
Maybe this could also start a new weekly contest where people log on<br>
and race each other live. We&#x27;ll see what happens. Let me know.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think there are too many sub forums. Just two or three is 
sufficient. Maybe even 1 subforum will do. After all, every topic on 
this group is posted on the same page, and that&#x27;s not the big 
problem of this group. Too many subfora = confusing.

Also, the amount of cubes on the background is a bit too large, IMHO.

Suggestion for the future &quot;coach&quot;: Find a fingertrickable algorithm 
that changes the whole cube and has order 2, i.e. if you apply it 
twice to a solved cube you&#x27;ll have the solved cube again. That will 
make it easier to learn/practice. It should be fingertrickable not 
only in order to execute it fast but also it will help the actor to 
learn/remember it. Optimally no cube rotations. So actually I&#x27;d 
suggest to have the DBL 2x2 solved already and only show the U, R and 
F faces (should be possible) so it can be an algorithm in the &lt;U,R,F> 
group. To find such an algorithm simply choose an effect with order 2 
and let ACube solve it in &lt;U,R,F>.

Oh, and do you know why they need a coach? Cause you&#x27;ll be the one who 
has to solve the cube all the time cause the actor will screw up the 
algorithm.

Please keep us updated, it&#x27;s quite interesting they actually ask us.

Cheers!

-------------

chris,

thanks for the email.
the film is a studio film, and the actor is quite popular.
one scene involves him riding in the back of a taxi with another actor.
the other actor &#x27;eggs&#x27; him on to try to solve the cube.
so, our main actor does it quickly.
so, we might need a cube set up for something like ten quick moves.
i would get multiple cubes for extra takes.
the actor might request to meet a speedcubing person to &#x27;talk tech&#x27;
with them.
we might need a hand double, but it is too early in our prep to know
that answer.
basically i need a friendly person who would be OK talking to our
actor, and then
to be with me on set one day when we film the scene. this person would
have to live in the Bay Area i suppose.
what do you think? i would appreciate any help you could give me.
cheers,
patrick

          <div class="email-content">im not sure how easy this will be, but if you can, don&#x27;t use java.
mainly because its slow, but also because for some reason, after doing
12 solves (at least for me), the sound stops. i&#x27;m not sure if its
because of your programming or java, but it has become a nuisance.
though it could just be my computer, im not sure.

and for features... hmm iono. i guess my only gripe is that the sound
goes off and its a tad slow. keep up the good work.

I&#x27;m actually pretty set on using a webpage-based timer, so no worries.
This will make it easier to allow many people to connect to a server
and race, only in this case the &#x27;server&#x27; will be the webserver :)

Seems pretty doable.

<br>
Not at all. If you take a page of 1000 words and reduce its size by 200<br>
times, the naked human eye cannot physically sense all of the light<br>
information required to actually see words.<br>
<br>
The resolution of sound, on the other hand, is in time, not space. After<br>
compressing 200 seconds worth of sound down to just 1 second, you are<br>
unreasonably expecting that I be able to hear everything as if it were<br>
at normal resolution.<br>
<br>
No, what I&#x27;m saying is that if a normal person is able to hear 100<br>
details about a fragment of sound after 50 hearings, I can hear those<br>
same 100 details about a fragment of sound after only 1 hearing. I&#x27;m<br>
sure that after 50 hearings of a 1 second recording of 1000 spoken<br>
words, you would not pick up one single word. Do you understand?<br>
<br>
Give me 1 second of natural spoken English, and I can remember every<br>
inflection, tone, overtone, rhythm that I can reasonably hear at that<br>
resolution, as if I am making an audio recording. Give me, say, 15<br>
seconds of some music, and I will hear and remember not only the<br>
&quot;simple&quot; information like the melody and rhythm, but all the layers of<br>
intrumentation and their precise(*) expression in terms of their tone,<br>
texture, and delayed timing. <br>
<br>
So, it is quite reasonable to me that if I can hear+record in one<br>
hearing what others can hear+record in 50 hearings, then some people can<br>
quite likely see+record in one look what others can see+record in 50<br>
looks.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m exiting this conversation now. Please Google eidetic memory if you<br>
want to find evidence more to your liking.<br>
<br>
(*) Regarding the word &quot;precise&quot;, this does not mean &quot;exact&quot;, of course.<br>
I can hear/record to a high level of precision, but not a perfect one.<br>
Memory, and even sensory input, is always an approximation of the real<br>
world.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Oh brillient!

I was just thinking about that yesterday. I would definately use it.

Not sure if it&#x27;s already a feature or on your to-do list, but I&#x27;d 
like the option of entering my own time (i.e. from a stackmat) and 
like Leyan said, and undo button to change the times in case of 
mistakes.

How long is that going to take ya? Sounds like a lot of work.

          <div class="email-content">I would very much enjoy a slowest average statistic.<br>
<br>
I would also very much like a &#x27;handicap&#x27; function, where you can automatically add a prespecified number of seconds to your time, so that cubers of different abilities could compete more evenly.  Perhaps there could be a table or some function to compute the handicap based on average averages?  This may help to make racing via the program more popular, as well as give us a chance to compete with people of different skill levels.<br>
<br>
It would also be nice to be able to do stop/starts in the middle of a time.  When timing one step solves, you have to start and stop, then add the times up, then enter them separately.<br>
<br>
Another request would be to be able to crop solves out for compiling averages and getting different stats.  With a function like this, you could make an average of your solves with different methods, for those of us using more than one.  It would also allow us to make a &#x27;best 12 solves&#x27; or similar save file, without forcing us to save and pare or individually enter anew.<br>
<br>
Other than that, an undo function seems almost necessary, if you don&#x27;t include a separate &#x27;Accept&#x27; button.  I cannot count the number of times I have accidentally double clicked when I&#x27;ve had to stop a solve to go answer the telephone.<br>

I think that about wraps up my list of demands/requests.  I can&#x27;t wait for the new version. =)<br>

  I keep getting asked to make a JNetCube that supports more then 2<br>
  users for online racing, so I think I&#x27;m going to start working on it.<br>
  I&#x27;m not sure of the programming language I&#x27;m going to use, but I will<br>
  promise to use another multiplatform language whether that may be<br>
  java, perl, or even web-based like html or php.<br>
<br>
  I have a little free time now after work so I&#x27;m going to investigate<br>
  the best plan of action and get started!<br>
<br>
  My question to you guys is: What features do you want?<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;m going to incorperate the standard things like average, fastest<br>
  time, slowest time, scramble, countdown, .... I just want to make sure<br>
  there&#x27;s nothing huge that people want because that would require an<br>
  overhaul :) I want to get things right the first time.<br>
<br>
  I hope to support an unlimited amount of users (the max amount to be<br>
  set by the server) and to make the project dedicated server based. I<br>
  can have a dedicated server constantly running at a specified URL<br>
  (probably strangpuzzle.com) and have everyone just connect to the<br>
  server and start a &#x27;race room&#x27;. People could just connect to the room<br>
  and race away with X amount of people. Does this sound like something<br>
  people would use? I going to make it even if people don&#x27;t want it :)<br>
  but I figured I&#x27;d ask first too.<br>
<br>
  Maybe this could also start a new weekly contest where people log on<br>

          <div class="email-content">I dont see why not competing in a championship, proves that you are a
fraud. I guess there are many ppl around that could potentially do very
well in mind olympics contests, but are not interrested or not aware of
the fact that they exist.

It&#x27;s a bit too easy to just discredit them because they have not
competed. The persons them self are probably not all that interrested in
the media focus, but the &quot;inventors&quot; of the speed reading systems want
media focus to attract more ppl and make more money.

And the extreme results shown are, if they in fact are true, probably
not something they could easily repeat, but I agree that they should
shatter the world records on even a bad day.

46012 words in 21 minutes are just over 2000 words a minute, and I
myself can read over 800 words a minute without any speedreading
training, so that does not seem impossible.

Emne: [Speed cubing group] speed reading (was: J Bernett Orlando

You guys make it sound like it&#x27;s the most normal thing in the world. 
Can you do it? Has someone demonstrated it to you? If so, please share 
some details.

I just found another article:
http://www.execuread.com/press_media.htm

Quote:
&quot;[...] read a 30 000 word book about Albert Einstein in 12s. Following 
that, she wrote a comprehension test and scored 95%.&quot;

Depending on the book layout, that might be about 10 pages per second. 
Yeah ok I admit even I can flip the pages of a book that fast.

My main argument is still this one: Of all those people (you&#x27;ll easily 
find lots of reports of many people achieving things like that), why 
does not a single one of them ever go to a competition? They would 
completely SHATTER the existing world records. It&#x27;d be like a 10 
meters tall basketball player in the NBA.

Ok I don&#x27;t have current world records but here&#x27;s a report from 2001:
http://www.msoworld.com/Press/Releases/MSO5day3.html

It says &quot;46012 words in a under 21 minutes&quot;. And I do believe that. 
Why? Not because I can get even close to that myself or have seen 
someone else doing it, but simply because it was an official and 
well-known competition. Why does this other woman not just go there 
and beat 21 minutes with 19 seconds? I mean, hello-o! Why don&#x27;t *any* 
of those numerous geniuses go there? Don&#x27;t tell me they&#x27;re too shy or 
too decent or whatever. I&#x27;ll tell you why: cause they&#x27;re too lying.

I dont think you can compare the brain with the physical world. We know<br>

about as impossible as running a 20 second mile.<br>
<br>
Another point that makes it hard for the &quot;photo readers&quot; to compete in a<br>
contest is that even tho they can &quot;read&quot; the text really fast, they can<br>
not recall it instantly, but it takes a while for them to process the<br>
info. In a contest I guess they would be asked questions to check their<br>
comprehension of the text right after they are done reading.<br>
<br>
But I have never seen anyone perform these tasks, and have never tried<br>
to do them myself, so I can&#x27;t say that they are not frauds. I just<br>
choose to believe that the human mind in capable of much more than we<br>

There are a few of us that chat on cubestation.co.uk on weekends. 
This chat is actually on the #Rubik channel on the irc.irchat.tv irc
server.  Alexander (I don&#x27;t know his e-mail address, just his nick on
IRC), has written a script that responds when you issue scramble
requests in the chat session, and when you announce your result, the
times are stored in a database that can be queried with other chat
commands.

My suggestion would be to write a program that is a combination
JNetCube/IRC client that lets people chat on this channel, has buttons
to issue scramble requests to Alexander&#x27;s program, and automatically
announces the time results to the channel when the user accepts the
results.

This method would have the advantage that it also allows interaction
with other cubers who can chat, but can&#x27;t run the JNetCube timer
(maybe because they are using Stackmat timers instead).

          <div class="email-content">Thanks, you exactly described what I meant and why it can&#x27;t be 
compared. You just draw a different conclusion.

The point is that those people claim to record a huge amount of data 
in extremely short time. You do something different, you don&#x27;t record 
a huge amount, you record very precisely. I might be able to read a 
full page of text in 50 short looks, but I need to look at different 
points, like one line each look. I don&#x27;t think I can &quot;read&quot; a full 
page by shortly staring at the whole page 50 times. But in your sound 
example you surely meant hearing the *same* sound 50 times, not 50 
different sounds, right?

The resolution difference, time vs space, is exactly what I meant. 
What makes your ability not similar.

          <div class="email-content">Out of the many many people with claimed outstanding abilities, there 
should be at least one who wants to prove it. And the mind olympics 
are well-known. Guiness World Records are even more well-known. And 
the people often write how they broke a world record.

But ok, maybe they&#x27;re really all shy and just the inventors want media 
focus. Then why on earth don&#x27;t these inventors prove it in official 
competitions? They surely know about them and they surely would 
benefit, no? And usually the inventors claim huge achievements for 
themselves, too. So why don&#x27;t at least those guys prove it?

Wikipedia has a short article on eidetic memory:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory
I guess I like Marvin Minsky now :-). The Guiness world records 
mentioned are something completely different, they&#x27;re much less 
extreme and they can be explained. There are systems that anyone can 
learn and train to do similar things with enough time and mor 
importantly motivation.

P.S. Too bad news24.com must have deleted the article I mentioned 
(http://www.execuread.com/press_media.htm), I would&#x27;ve liked to see it 
there. They do have older articles in their archives. I wonder why 
they deleted that one.

The idea is that you look what the effect of a single move is. On 
the 3x3x3 cube there is one move (a face turned clockwise by 90 
degrees) which we can say all moves consist of. Now, the effect of 
this move is to do an edge 4-cycle and a corner 4-cycle. Let the 
edges be 1, 2, 3, 4 and the corners be 1&#x27;, 2&#x27;, 3&#x27;, 4&#x27;. If we start 
from the position (1, 2, 3, 4) and similarly for the corners, we get 
(4, 1, 2, 3) which is an odd permutation (i.e. we get to the solved 
position by doing an odd number of two pieces swaps). The corners 
will be in an odd permutation too. Now, since the starting position 
is obviously an even permutation, we see that performing one move 
will change the parity of the permutation of the edges. So it will 
also change the parity of the permutation of the corners. Overall, 
the permutation will be even. So the permutation of any position on 
the cube will be even. Since the position which we want to get to, 
that with two edges swapped, has an odd permutation, it is 
impossible to get to it.

Same thing with the orientation. It&#x27;s easy to define the orientation 
of pieces, and then we will just notice that no move changes the 
parity of the orientation. And since one switched piece means there 
is an odd orientation, than we see that this is impossible too.

Sorry for the length.

Actually no need to separate edges and corners. Just say any quarter 
turn is two 4-cycles which is an even permutation :-)

I asked myself the same yesterday. Someone asked me about a flipped 
edge on the Megaminx. I told him it&#x27;s impossible and I know it&#x27;s 
correct and I&#x27;ve proven it to myself, but it&#x27;s harder for me to write 
a nice short proof. Proving the permutation parity is much easier for 
me.

Hi Daniel,

   The parity problem is caused by the centers only rotating in place,
and never switching. The cube only allows 4 centers or 6 centers to
move evenly (that is, in multiples of two turns) in relation to an
otherwise solved cube. This even numbered limitation is shown, for
example, by the cube not allowing only the centers of the slice
between the Up and Down sides to move one turn to the right, in an
otherwise solved cube.

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Well, first off, there are many &quot;equally proficient&quot; cubers out in 
the SF area... say LarsP or Tyson (DanK used to live there).

I don&#x27;t think the point is to do something as 
entertaining/extravegant as possible, they probably just want to 
follow the script as close as possible.

Also, who says they wouldn&#x27;t be willing to fly someone in from afar. 
The letter was from Patrick, and it sounded to me like they just 
wanted SF area for convience of all parties.

Plane ticket like that would cost less then $500 round trip actually 
so that was a gross over-estimate.

I don&#x27;t find anything odd about the whole deal.

Unless the actor has small slender (and perhaps Asian) hands, I 
don&#x27;t think they would want Macky. If I was directing, I would want 
a hand-double reasonably close to the actor&#x27;s as my top priority, 
not looking for speed. I&#x27;m sure any cuber under 35s can show off mad 
deterity/speed if they really wanted to and a scene/cube was setup 
for it.

Don&#x27;t assume they are looking for that much authenticity...

This reminds me of a Dutch puzzle friend Ronald Hoekstra.<br>

Just check the news item of July 26, 2004 on my site.<br>

He was in a camper all day with several big names, like LL Cool J and <br>
Val Kilmer. Check out, he is even mentioned on imdb.com as the hand-<br>

          <div class="email-content">heh, funny thing (although possibly off-topic)

last year, i had brought my cube to school and solved it in 35 or so
seconds. some girl told me that she knew some kid who could solve it
in 17 seconds. at first i disregarded it, thinking they didn&#x27;t know
anything. but it happened again, at least 2 more times. well one day i
finally met up with this guy.

turns out the fastest he&#x27;d ever solved it in was 50-something seconds.

people often will exaggerate. &#x27;nuff said.

PS regarding joining a list and sending out spam right away: regardless of free enterprise and whether you&#x27;re breaking laws, etc. etc., I would like to say I frown on the practice, since in this case it appears that PK joined the list expressly for the purpose of furthering his personal gain, and although he&#x27;s invited others to do the same, that&#x27;s actually a minus, not a plus, for me, because it encourages further such behavior.   The reason all these 50 million usenet, yahoo, &amp; other groups exist is because people want to discuss specific topics.   Going OT now and then (e.g. with speedreading) isn&#x27;t so bad, because it relates to the matter at hand, but PK, please don&#x27;t keep doing what you did here.  If I see you on any other Yahoo groups that I&#x27;m on, suddenly joining and sending notes like that, I&#x27;ll keep recommending to people not to participate in the game in the way that you want them to.<br>

&gt; Hey everyone, <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I recently received an e-mail from a guy Patrick Ludden who needs a<br>
&gt; speedcubing coach for an actor in a movie being filmed in San Francisco.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; From what he was saying the actor is fairly poplar and would want to<br>
&gt; &quot;talk tech&quot; with a speedcuber to get a feel for it and also for how to<br>
&gt; solve the cube quickly.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The solve will be prepared of course and needs to be done in<br>
&gt; &quot;something like ten quick moves&quot;.  The scene involves an actor in a<br>
&gt; cab egged on by a friend to solve the cube, which he &quot;does quickly&quot;.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; There is also the possibility of using a hands double, but it seems<br>
&gt; more likely that the actor will do the solve.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I don&#x27;t want to post this guy&#x27;s e-mail address publicly, but e-mail me<br>
&gt; (chris@[nospam]speedcubing.com) if you are available and I will put<br>
&gt; you in contact with him.  Remember to delete the [nospam] when you<br>

speedcuber, but everyone I solve it for happens to know someone who  
can do it faster. And their times always happen to be a few seconds  
faster than mine.

It gets annoying, but not as annoying as &quot;I solved that once when I

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,
This reminds me of a documentary i saw recently, about people that could read a bit faster than the average people. I don&#x27;t know why i didn&#x27;t think of it at first, anyway, it&#x27;s known to be a very interesting and serious show, and they had different guys talking about techniques to read faster and still get the meaning of what you read. They didn&#x27;t speak of record-breaking ppl, however, they interviewed an eye scientist who showed a very simple trick: knowing that the eye is &quot;slow&quot; (well not really slow, but it&#x27;s not freaking fast either, how long does it take you to move the eye, find the word, refocus, move, find, focus, move, find, focus etc.)she had a computer in front of her where she displayed a single sentence word by word, the words being quite big (something like Times New Roman size 40). then you can set about any speed on the comp, your eye, even if not reading every word, will record the image of the whole thing and you&#x27;ll understand what you read. this process not being
 so tiring as reading the same amount of words in the same amount of time and still being able to undferstand what you read, or if you prefer, this is 10 times faster than normal reading when you&#x27;re fully focused on what you read, mostly because the eyes don&#x27;t move. Of course looking at a screen for a long time is tiring...
I&#x27;m not saying I believe these records, I just say that using this technique, there&#x27;s a way to read a lot faster and you can even count the number of words. Being focused on a computer for 10s isn&#x27;t that hard, then you multiply by 6 and you get your &quot;number of words/minute average&quot;...
If anyone has already said something in that direction and I&#x27;m only resaying what&#x27;s already been said, please forgive me, I haven&#x27;t been following the discussion very actively...

Stefan Pochmann &lt;pochmann@...> a écrit :
Thanks, you exactly described what I meant and why it can&#x27;t be 
compared. You just draw a different conclusion.

The point is that those people claim to record a huge amount of data 
in extremely short time. You do something different, you don&#x27;t record 
a huge amount, you record very precisely. I might be able to read a 
full page of text in 50 short looks, but I need to look at different 
points, like one line each look. I don&#x27;t think I can &quot;read&quot; a full 
page by shortly staring at the whole page 50 times. But in your sound 
example you surely meant hearing the *same* sound 50 times, not 50 
different sounds, right?

The resolution difference, time vs space, is exactly what I meant. 
What makes your ability not similar.

Yes, true. Because Java is an interpreted language and not a compiled
one it tends to run slower then other compiled languages. I&#x27;m not a
big fan of Java myself, but decided to use it for that project because
it&#x27;s pretty powerful and most of all, multi-platform. I&#x27;m a huge linux
user and coding it in C or C++ wasn&#x27;t a good idea because then I would
have to write a different version for each operating system.

The &#x27;new&#x27; version I&#x27;m going to write is most likely going to be
webbased...html or php. I&#x27;m not going to recreate a standalone timer.
I&#x27;m just working on network timer that allows more users.

Is it? Do a U-turn on a solved cube. Have you twisted any corner in 
the upper layer?

If the answer is &#x27;no&#x27;, then it seems that it would be impossible to 
twists any corner.

If the answer is &#x27;yes&#x27;, then the problem is to determine which corners 
that are twisted clockwise and which corners that are twisted anti-
clockwise.

The central issue is how to determine if a corner is twisted or not 
when the corner piece is not in its correct place. It seems impossible 
to define the twist in absolute terms, but that you need to have some 
kind of reference frame. The edges pose not the same problem since we 
can define that each single move flips four edges. Thus, the U-turn of 
a solved cube results in four flipped edges...

I&#x27;d like it to talk, of course, like my timer :)

Some might think this is just for fun, but it started out because I 
want to know how far I am in my solution without having to look at 
the clock/timer. And it works. You could also implement the 
metronome as a simpler feature, and make it configurable, so &#x27;beep 
every x seconds&#x27;.

I am working for Dan Harris on an automated version of his profiles 
section. It&#x27;s almost ready. If you like to connect your program to 
the profiles I am willing to cooperate. E.g. automatically show 
profile information downloaded from my database. Otherwise you&#x27;ll 
end up storing all that information twice. It would be nice to see a 
picture of the one(s) you are racing against.

If you want details of how to connect to my database, let me know in 
private email (blonkm[at]gmail[dot]com)

P.S.  I&#x27;m curious what the approximate move count would be for a method described in my &#x27;New LL strategy proposal&#x27; topic.  I have a feeling it would be low, but I don&#x27;t know how to find the number of moves.

          <div class="email-content">Ya, I hate it when that happens.

What I do is ask for a name, and since I know most of the cubers 
names on top 200 lists, I can verify or deny it pretty quickly.

Sure lots of times it&#x27;s fake or an exaggeration. But (as I have 
recently found out) there is truth to some of these claims.

I mean, just think, I&#x27;ve been seen in public cubing at this 
university by lots of people. Now when they see some newbie sub-1min 
cuber, they are going to mention me (or some faint memory of a guy 
cubing on campus). Similarly, I&#x27;ve heard stories about a cuber here, 
and had been denying it, but it seems like there are other cubers at 
my school.

Who&#x27;s to say DanK or JonM, didn&#x27;t walk through the Detroit airport 
one day and one of the people watching me cube didn&#x27;t see such a 
feat already. 

So now I&#x27;m pretty open to the idea that news of cubing travels fast; 
that it&#x27;s more likely than I had originally expected for an 
individual too run into another cuber.

You say you&#x27;ve never meant another speedcuber in real life, right? 
Well maybe you should try to seek some out in your area.

Open your eyes, there are speedcubers lurking in every corner of the 
world and in basically every (technical) profession.

Heck, just give your location. Might get some hits on this fourm...

I&#x27;m from Ann Arbor, MI... I occasioanlly stop by places kinda far 
off from home and cube there. Such as Saginaw and Kalamazoo... so 
some poor cuber out in those places are going to deny sightings of 
me undoubtedly, lol. There are at least 7 cubers I&#x27;ve meant in/from 
MI, 4 or 5 faster than me in fact. Three national or international 
record holders are from MI. This doesn&#x27;t even cout the ones I&#x27;ve 
heard about but haven&#x27;t meant in person.

Look around, you&#x27;ll be suprised to actually see cubers faster than 
you around.

as I recall....

I&#x27;m curious though, and not sure what exactly you mean. Could you 
cite an example? when no corner is in correct permutation relative 
to the edges specifically. Cuz to move and twist 4 corners sounds 
like a lot to me.

Or even an example of doing this intuitively...

I&#x27;m very good at computing things like that, I&#x27;ll have to go back 
and find your post. I used to do (weighted) move count averages and 
case counts for this group regularly. My specialty is case counting 
(in whatever counting system you&#x27;d like).

You have kind of twisted my words, there.<br>
<br>
&gt; The point is that those people claim to record a huge amount of data <br>
&gt; in extremely short time. You do something different, you don&#x27;t record <br>
&gt; a huge amount, you record very precisely.<br>
<br>
My comparison is this:<br>
<br>
- In &quot;N&quot; seconds of hearing I can record 50x more data than the average<br>
  person.<br>
- In &quot;N&quot; seconds of looking this other person can record 50x more data<br>
  than the average person.<br>
<br>
You claim it is not &quot;data&quot; that I am recording in great numbers but<br>
something else??? What is it? On a computer, an audio file contains<br>
audio data, and a graphic file contains visual data. Audio and visual<br>
data are different in nature, of course, but I am instead comparing the<br>
ratio of 50x relative to an average person&#x27;s abilities for recording<br>
whatever kind of data. The ratios are comparable.<br>
<br>
Your claim that taking a visual recording of a page of 1000 written<br>
words in 1 second is comparable to taking a sound recording of 1 second<br>
of 1000 spoken words in 1 second is totally unfounded due to the matter<br>
of normal resolution which you have completely misunderstood. You left<br>
the size of the page at its normal size/resolution, while on the other<br>
hand, you shrunk the size of the recording of 1000 spoken words from its<br>
normal resolution of 200 seconds down to 1 second. This resolution is<br>
too compacted for any human to perceive. To make a fair comparison, you<br>
should also shrink the size of the page of written text by 200 times as<br>
well. Then we are both handicapped in the same way.<br>
<br>
Relative to their respective normals, I have compared two people as<br>
being 50x better than average.<br>
<br>
I have tried to offer you an insight into how in my case I am able to<br>
achieve this feat. Take it or leave it, but please don&#x27;t tell me I am<br>
achieving a different feat from what I think I am, when you yourself<br>
seem to have little understanding of it whatsoever.<br>
<br>
If you would rather argue with me about that, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what<br>
everyone else who&#x27;s participating in this thread wants to read about.<br>
They want to know how such a feat is possible, perhaps to see how it<br>

&gt; I might be able to read a full page of text in 50 short looks, but I<br>

&gt; think I can &quot;read&quot; a full page by shortly staring at the whole page 50<br>
&gt; times.<br>
<br>
Without being aware of it, your mind has been trained to focus on a<br>
small part of the page and ignore the rest of it. This is the way you<br>
learn to read.  First of all, they teach you to focus on one letter at a<br>
time. After your brain learns how to automatically translate the image<br>
of that letter into the letter itself, you learn how to focus on a whole<br>
word and recognise the image of the whole word as the word itself. After<br>
that, most people learn on their own how to recognise two or three words<br>
in one go, and by necessity, only learn to expand their focus<br>
horizontally (for horizontally flowing languages), or vertically (for<br>
vertically flowing languages).<br>
<br>
This process happens automatically whenever you see something that can<br>
be interpreted as written words, and it is quite difficult to override<br>
this training. However, it is easy to rediscover how broadly your eyes<br>
can really focus when you stare at a block of text written in a<br>
different language. For example, please take a look at the table of<br>
Korean symbols on the following page:<br>
<br>
http://www.wam.umd.edu/~stwright/korean/korean-linguistics-origins.html<br>
<br>
Since the meaning of these symbols is not registering with you as<br>
written English, your mind is allowing you to focus normally and you can<br>
take in the whole image quite easily. However, if you try to learn how<br>
to read the Korean language, you will again train your mind to focus on<br>
each individual character, and you will ignore the rest of what&#x27;s on the<br>
page. When I began learning the Korean language, I experienced exactly<br>
that: although I knew my eye could easily capture an entire Korean word<br>
with clarity, I could not stare at a whole Korean word and recognise it.<br>
Instead, I had to stare at each character individually until I had read<br>
through the whole word.<br>
<br>
Apart from this, there is a limit to how much you can focus on with<br>
clarity, but I am not about to guess at what the limit is. The more<br>
peripheral your vision, the less clear it is. When you look at<br>
something, your eyes automatically wander around to grab the full<br>
picture. Do you know if she is not allowed to move her eyes within that<br>
one second? One second seems like ample time to easily see the whole<br>
page.<br>
<br>
To me, &quot;seeing&quot; the whole page in 1 second is not the real feat. The<br>
real feat is being able to sustain the impression of that image in your<br>
mind for a long period of time.<br>
<br>
Please refer to my original email for an idea of how I do this for<br>
sound.<br>
<br>
&gt; But in your sound example you surely meant hearing the *same* sound 50<br>
&gt; times, not 50 different sounds, right?<br>
<br>
Well, if you were to listen to a length of sound with the aim of<br>
memorising it, you would listen to it several times, focussing on a<br>
different portion each time and ignoring the rest. Possibly you would<br>
take in relatively small portions at a time, whereas I would take in<br>
relatively large chunks of sound as one unit. By portion, I do not mean<br>
just timewise, but also depthwise.  For example, if you were able to<br>
demonstrate to me that you could listen to a whole 10 second fragment of<br>
music in one hearing and remember the entire melody, I would point out<br>
that you have only remembered one portion of the sound; There are also<br>
the drums, the guitar, bass guitar, keyboard (which is very dense in<br>
that it can involve chords with 6 or 7 parts played simultaneously),<br>
vocal parts and more, as well as the finer subtle points such as &quot;how&quot;<br>
the vocalists expressed each word (e.g. there are an infinite many ways<br>
to say a particular word), how the bass player attacked the 29th note in<br>
the bassline, etc. There is a lot of data in here, which I can pick up<br>
in one hearing, like an audio recording, but not quite that precise.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t really know how to convince you that it is a huge amount of data<br>
that I am hearing, since fewer people really care about hearing than<br>
they do about looking. I mean, it seems most would prefer to have visual<br>
rather than audio eidetic memory, and thus it is easy to diminish the<br>
latter ability relative to the former. After all, it is fair enough to<br>
say that more of the brain is devoted to vision than hearing, and that<br>
people depend more on vision than hearing.<br>

          <div class="email-content">So I&#x27;m sitting here at 4am, with nearly all my cubes out. Sadly only <br>
5 fully operational 3x3 cubes, and that includes my chrome one.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m trying to re-build a fleet here. Two more cubes to prep and 2 <br>
and a half to re-sticker. And omg, re-stickering takes so much time <br>
and effort! Prepping used to take about a month per cube for me, so <br>
this is all looking pretty daunting. And once I&#x27;m done with that <br>
time to order more cubes...<br>
<br>
A while ago, I bashed the 25th aniversary cubes a bit. I thought <br>
they were too much like the Meffert&#x27;s assembly in feel. That is it <br>
didn&#x27;t take mis-alignment very well or have enough springy-ness.<br>
<br>
Right now I have two speedcubes: a White DIY, and one that is 25th <br>
anniversary pieces on a regular mechanism that I have worn in for <br>
about a year. But in genreal pretty crappy for my standards.<br>
<br>
Lately I&#x27;ve heard that a lot of very fast cubers use the 25th <br>
anniversary cubes. So I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.<br>
<br>
I took the pieces off a new 25th anniversary cube (hard to do btw), <br>
and put the ones from my black speedcube on it. And OH boy was it <br>
super smooth! And super quite too, oddly enough.<br>
<br>
Right now I&#x27;m doing a full cleaning and re-lubing just to make sure <br>
that phenomenon wasn&#x27;t just a by-product of having lots and lots of <br>
dryed lube gunk in there. But so far I&#x27;m very impressed, and have <br>
changed my mind, I like these cubes now. Initially they are pretty <br>
bad and don&#x27;t have that desired tightness I was used to finding on <br>
new cubes (in the past it used to be that tightness initially <br>
translated to smoothness a year later).<br>
<br>
I recommend the 25th anniversary cubes now. The one I just put <br>
together seems to be better then any cube I&#x27;ve used lately. Well <br>
except when one of my friends (35s cuber) came to visit 6 weeks ago <br>
with a cube I prepared for him 2 years ago, that one rocks hardcore <br>
and I&#x27;m convinced is one of the best speedcubes in the world.<br>
<br>
But back to this... Any one ever find a speedcube that doesn&#x27;t do <br>
the usual clicking sounds but is very quite?<br>
<br>
Well back to pulling an all-nighter preping cubes and listening to a <br>
playlist entitiled &quot;cubing&quot; that I made years ago. See?, I&#x27;m such a <br>
hardcore cuber :). Speaking of which we should come up with jokes <br>
starting with &quot;You know you&#x27;ve been cubing too much when...&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh ya and it&#x27;s that time of year again... I want people to start a <br>
thread, posting/listing the primary and perhaps secondary speedcube <br>
they use. Like how old it is, what make/model, and the type of <br>
stickers. Oh and don&#x27;t forget to mention what class of speedcuber <br>
you are (i.e. sub-20 class, sub-25, sub-30, sub-35, ...).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ok fine, so I&#x27;m bored. In keeping with my last post, let me be the <br>
first to try some of these jokes. Though I suck at this.<br>
<br>
<br>
=====================================================================<br>
You know you&#x27;ve been cubing too much when the first thing you do <br>
every morning is wake up and check speedcubing.com.<br>
<br>
You know you&#x27;ve been cubing too much when the edges of your computer <br>
monitor(s) are filled with old cube stickers.<br>
<br>
You know you&#x27;ve been cubing *WAY* too much when all these stickers <br>
are LOGO stickers.<br>
<br>
You know you&#x27;ve been cubing too much when you regularly use the <br>
word &quot;F2L&quot; in conversation with non-cubers.<br>
<br>
You know you&#x27;ve been cubing too much when your fingers twitch while <br>
sleeping as if your doing a trigger.<br>
<br>
You know you&#x27;ve been cubing too much when it&#x27;s 4:38am and you <br>
realized you hadn&#x27;t left your room since you woke up and have been <br>
cubing continuously.<br>
<br>
You know you&#x27;ve been cubing too much when you have two Acube windows <br>
up, Ron&#x27;s OnlineTimer, JNetCube, several IM windows to various <br>
cubers around the world, a recently finished MagicCube 4D window <br>
that you can&#x27;t bare to close due to the 3.5 hrs you spent on it last <br>
night, browsers to several cubing sites (including your own!), <br>
shopping cart on rubik.com, a few record pages, CubeExplorer, and <br>
JNet&#x27;s &quot;Scramble View&quot; window. (Oh wait, that&#x27;s just me.)<br>
<br>
Your roommates know you&#x27;ve been cubing too much when you whip <br>
out &quot;the mat&quot;.<br>
<br>
Your friends know you&#x27;ve been cubing too much when you always bring <br>
a cube to the restroom.<br>
<br>
You know you&#x27;ve been cubing too much when you have a special <br>
waterproof cube that you use while in the shower (and stays in the <br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m doing a bit of cubing right now, and noticed I&#x27;ve been doing a <br>
couple of interesting things.<br>
<br>
You see, competitive speedcubing*, or at least the physical aspect <br>
can be broken up into three parts: Dexterity, Strength, and Accuracy.<br>
<br>
I think deterity comes from practice and is even something inherent <br>
of a person. So not much special can be done about that.<br>
<br>
For strength what I have been doing is practicing on an extra-tight <br>
and weighter cube. I have been using an over-tightened white DIY. To <br>
weigh it down, I put in about 18 zinc washers and stuff the edge <br>
pieces with playdoh.<br>
<br>
For accuracy, I now practice on an over lubed 25th anniversary cube, <br>
they are quite sensitive to lock-ups if your not careful enough, and <br>
the over-slickness will force you to build up accuracy and control.<br>
<br>
Ah yes, &quot;accuracy&quot; in this new age of cubing, that is now the new <br>
catch-phrase. I hear this term a lot from people like Macky and <br>
Tyson.<br>
<br>
So I leave you with the reminder:<br>
&quot;It&#x27;s not that your cube sucks, it&#x27;s that you SUCK! So quick blaming <br>
your cubes and start working on your accuracy.&quot;<br>

*I say &quot;competitive speedcubing&quot; since there are actually many types <br>
of cubers out there, some that don&#x27;t do it for speed, and even some <br>
that do it for speed but are not competitive on it. In fact, I don&#x27;t <br>
fully fit into this category; I opted to be more of an &quot;algorithm <br>
monopolizer&quot;.<br>

I use this one for one-handed but not normal speedcubing:
(U&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L U L&#x27;) y&#x27; (L&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; L U)

That&#x27;s for left-handed, mirror it for right-handed.

I what millenium are you guys living? ;-)

Read a bit about JIT (just in time) compilers or Java HotSpot.

And here&#x27;s a little demo program:

--------------------------------------------------
class Speed {
    public static void main ( String[] args ) {
        int a = 2, b = 3, c = 5, d = 7;
        for( int i=0; i&lt;1000000000; i++ ){
            a += i;
            b += a;
            c += b;
            d += c;
        }
        System.out.println( d );
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

I also translated the program to C and C++, here are the timing 
results:

Java: 0m21.740s
C:    0m34.830s
C++:  0m34.850s

Notice the program purposely has only very simple and fast operations 
(no divisions etc, just additions) so that most of the time is spent 
running the code, not waiting for computation results.

I also ran the Java program on my PC (I only have Java 1.4.1 where I 
did the first tests and that one doesn&#x27;t have nice profiler output) 
and got the following profiler output. Notice how much is interpreted 
and how much is *compiled*:

--------------------------------------------------

Hmm... how do you &quot;define&quot; that each move flips four edges? Also, it 
might be better to define how to count the edge flips and then 
&quot;observe&quot; that each move flips four edges (if that&#x27;s true, and I 
actually doubt it).

Here&#x27;s my attempt for 3x3 corners:

For each corner and each corner position choose a standard orientation 
(for corners choose a real sticker and for positions choose an 
imaginary sticker). Now the &quot;twist&quot; of a corner is how far it must be 
rotated clockwise (0,1 or 2) to match the standard orientation of the 
position it&#x27;s in. The &quot;total twist&quot; is the sum of all corner twists, 
modulo 3.

Now let&#x27;s prove that a move doesn&#x27;t change the total twist. The trick 
is to temporarily adjust the standard orientations of the corner 
positions involved in the move. Adjust them so that they match the 
face being turned. Since they&#x27;re our reference, this will of course 
change our total twist. Call that change the &quot;face twist&quot;. Now we do 
the move which (thanks to the adjusted standard orientations) doesn&#x27;t 
change the total twist further. Afterwards we undo the adjustments, 
which will again change our total twist, but this time the opposite 
way. So we&#x27;re back at the original standard orientations and the 
overall effect of the move on our total twist is:
(face twist) + 0 - (face twist) = 0.

Since any move doesn&#x27;t change the total twist but rotating a single 
corner does, this can&#x27;t be done with moves.

What do you think?

The proof (with different numbers/names) also works for edges and also 
other puzzles, e.g. Megaminx.

I&#x27;m no expert in Java graphics (I&#x27;ve done a bit with it but not too 
much) but if this is really a problem then you might want to try AWT 
instead of Swing. AWT is heavyweight (let the operating system draw 
stuff like buttons etc) and Swing is lightweight (drawing everyhing 
itself), which is why AWT can be faster. Here&#x27;s a very nice page 
discussing both, including a discussion about the pros and cons of 
each:
http://bdn.borland.com/article/0,1410,26970,00.html

So if you have problems with speed and don&#x27;t really depend on Swing, 
try AWT instead. Though I&#x27;d be a bit surprised if you have speed 
problems unless you have a fancy graphical application, which I don&#x27;t 
imagine a cube timer to be...

Cheers!

I should&#x27;ve been more clear. I don&#x27;t want to play the 1000 words at 
high speed, I want to play them at *normal* speed. Just all at the 
same time. Just like the photoreaders when they see 1000 normal size 
words at the same time.

I do believe you that. Reminds me a bit of the chess masters that can 
easily remember whole chess boards (that is, if they display a normal 
game, not if they&#x27;re random). The first problem of most people 
remembering much of a music fragment is probably that they aren&#x27;t even 
able to pay attention to everything because they&#x27;re not used to it 
(missing attention when being introduced to people is also the #1 
reason why I often can&#x27;t remember their names ;-)

And yes, it&#x27;s of course data, but a different kind of data. How are 
you going to play/record 1000 words in a second using sound?

Hmm, just a thought... there&#x27;s a memorization discipline called 
&quot;spoken numbers&quot; where you&#x27;re just listening to someone telling a 
sequence of digits, one digit each second. How many do you think you 
could remember? And would it help if they spoke faster?

Indeed. It just happens to be the case that you can choose a reference
facelet for each edge such that no two are a quarter turn apart. If
you do this 6H pattern, you will see which facelets I mean:
U2 B2 R2 U2D2 R2 F2 U2

That is the standard proof. You can find it in the Cubic Circular:
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p21

There you will also see the one-line proof for edge flip parity:

A single edge-flip is a swap of two facelets, and hence is an odd
permutation of the facelets, but every move is an even permutation of
facelets and so no single edge flip is possible.

Unfortunately this does not work on corners because a corner twist is
a 3-cycle of facelets, not directly ruled out by the parity.

The answer can be both &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. The idea is that the cube is 
no longer considered symmetrical. That is, different face turns are 
different. Namely, U and D turns are different from the other face 
turns. 

We&#x27;ll consider the reference frame as being the U and D faces. The 
twist of a corner is how many times it has to be twisted clockwise 
so that it&#x27;s U/D face is in the U/D face (this can always be done, 
since every corner belongs to either of these two faces). In the 
starting position, the total twist is 0. Now let&#x27;s see what 
different face turns do.

U and D don&#x27;t change the total twist. It is then easy to see that F, 
B, R and L are symmetrical to each other, so we&#x27;ll consider doing 
the move F. We will have 4 twisted corners. The ones in the UFL and 
DFR positions have twist 1, and the ones in the UFR and DFL 
positions have twist 2. The total is 0.

So no move changes the total twist.

I think that&#x27;s not possible if we define the orietation with regards 
to a frame, but I just found another definition:

We define the twist of an edge as 0 if by bringing it to its correct 
position (and orientation) we use an even number of quarter outer 
face turns, and 1 if we need an odd number of quarter turns. One 
move changes the orientation of 4 edges, because they are one 
quarter turn more (or less) away from their solved position - it is 
exactly that quarter turn which we performed. Since 4 is an even 
number, the parity of the total twist doesn&#x27;t change when we perform 
a quarter turn. Again we see that there is an invariant: the parity 
of the total twist. One twisted edge means the total twist is odd, 
which is a contradiction.

I&#x27;m not sure if this was mentioned but there&#x27;s a technical aspect to this also - which is that 
the oddness/evenness of a permutation is well-defined. Essentially, that&#x27;s to say that the 
identity ican&#x27;t be realized as an odd permutation. If you are willing to accept that then the 
proof is fairly straightforward but that detail does require some proof. (One way to do this 
is using determiants of permutation matrices - then it essentially boils down to (-1)^n 
can&#x27;t be 1 if n is odd.)

That&#x27;s an interesting idea. But it&#x27;s not too obvious that this is 
well-defined, at least not to me... :-( Yeah ok, now (after thinking a 
bit) I see it, we can use Jaap&#x27;s 6H-pattern...

Yeah yeah, once again I reinvented the wheel... I even used the same 
term and definition for &quot;twist&quot; ;-). Well, at least I didn&#x27;t define 
the &quot;principal direction&quot; (my &quot;standard orientation&quot;) of the pieces 
and positions to match when the puzzle is solved... which is 
completely unnecessary :-)

Too bad I was thinking about corners only, I did think about facelet 
permutations but quickly abandoned it ;-)

Ok, here is my serious answer, and you can laugh if you weren&#x27;t being<br>
serious.<br>
<br>
A sound is temporal and a page is spatial. That is, you discern the<br>
contents of a sound by time, and you discern the contents of a page by<br>
space. If you want to overlay all of the spoken words over each other at<br>
one point in time and play them back, it is only fair to overlay all of<br>
the written words at point in space and then try to look at them. It can<br>
be done to a certain number of layers, but not 1000 words overlaid over<br>
each other! However, I would say that the number of layers one can<br>
discern in audio data is far greater than that in visual data, and that<br>
is one of the differences between audio and visual data.<br>
<br>
&gt; And yes, it&#x27;s of course data, but a different kind of data. How are <br>
&gt; you going to play/record 1000 words in a second using sound?<br>
<br>
Yes, it&#x27;s a different kind of data: it&#x27;s audio, not visual. And this<br>
answers your next question: there is no natural way to express 1000<br>
spoken words in 1 second, because a spoken word takes up too much time.<br>
<br>
No comparison can be made that way. It&#x27;s not easy to express a sound on<br>
a piece of paper either. It&#x27;s much more efficient to hear it.<br>
<br>
&gt; Hmm, just a thought... there&#x27;s a memorization discipline called <br>
&gt; &quot;spoken numbers&quot; where you&#x27;re just listening to someone telling a <br>
&gt; sequence of digits, one digit each second. How many do you think you <br>
&gt; could remember? And would it help if they spoke faster?<br>
<br>
There&#x27;s a limit to how much data I can capture in one go. So, for<br>
example, give me 10 seconds of complex data such as this, and I will<br>
remember quite precisely the original audio track. I do not think about<br>
or even recognise the actual numbers and try to filter out the rest, I<br>
just hear and remember the whole sound. I can then play back the sound<br>
later in my head and try to figure out what numbers you actually spoke.<br>
People will often perceive me as a slow thinker because of that.<br>
<br>
The amount of sound I can capture in one go depends on its complexity.<br>
If it is less complex, I can capture maybe a whole minute in one go.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sure that if all you were interested in were the actual numbers<br>
themselves, you should ask someone who is good at filtering. I don&#x27;t do<br>
any filtering - I try to capture every detail I hear.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,<br>
<br>
I did a breakdown average, timing the F2L and LL separately on the<br>
Stackmat, and (for the curious) here were my results:<br>
<br>
F2L = cross (bottom face) + 4 C/E pairs<br>
LL = OLL (+ AUF) + PLL<br>
<br>
#   F2L      LL<br>
1   16.61    9.61<br>
2   15.61    6.54<br>
3   15.53    8.40<br>

12  19.91   (6.00)<br>
Av  17.74    7.93 (Total avg: 25.67)<br>
<br>
Since my best average is 24.78, I think this average accurately<br>
demonstrates what my typical solves look like (except OLL recognition<br>
is instead replaced with starting the Stackmat timer and grabbing the<br>
cube.  There were no lucky cases.  Based on these averages, it&#x27;s clear<br>
that my biggest problem is the F2L (only one sub-15 F2L time!).  I<br>
know it&#x27;s been asked plenty of times before, but maybe I missed<br>
something important, so here&#x27;s my question:<br>
<br>
Does anybody have any advice for improving the F2L?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hmm ...

Java does indeed have quite powerful graphics. Apart from using 
Java3D which at least on windows u can run in either the DirectX or 
the OpenGL flavour. U need a separate JDK and runtime environment 
for coding and running respectively.  Apart from this, the Java2D is 
also quite powerful. At least for Java2D u won&#x27;t need other than the 
normal Sun java virtual machine, preferably JRE 1.5 (5.0). For a 
demo of it&#x27;s powerful features check out ur JDK folder which should 
reside somewhere similar to this :

C:\Programfiler\Java\jdk1.5.0_03\demo\jfc\Java2D\Java2Demo.html

At least im quite impressed with all of it&#x27;s features. Remember 
that  this is platform independent graphics :-) Besides the java 
collection classes this is the java stuff im most impressed by. The 
downside of Java is the relatively slow text- and numbercrunching. 
And also it can be somewhat of a pain to make attractive GUI&#x27;s with 
java using it&#x27;s layout managers. Using for instance Eclipse and a 
plugin like JIgloo it&#x27;s at least a little more attractive. But it 
requires  lots or RAM to run smoothly.

Oh and don&#x27;t try to run Eclipse and ACube at the same time :-P Yes u 
guessed it, Eclipse is a java application. It will be very slow. 
Effective threading within the JVM is also not it&#x27;s strong side :-(

Cheers!

right thumb on the R sticker of the URF corner, turn
with your wrist for the U2, then pull the (B&#x27;) with
your thumb.  

(R&#x27;B)

you do this the same way you would do R&#x27;U, by tilting
the cube toward you a bit.

Hope this helps!

11+ seconds most of the time.

The key to slower times is to force yourself to go slower than the frantic 
pace you feel like you need.  Just try to be constantly turning.

Also, easy optimizations are very helpful.  Play around with block style F2L 
shortcuts.  Use tips from Gilles Roux&#x27;s and Lars Petrus&#x27; sites.  Also, try 
to use corners or edges already correctly placed to your advantage.  Andy 
Camann&#x27;s site has a great working corner method description you can use for 
this.

          <div class="email-content">I have a question regarding the F2L - I have been cubing for a few  <br>
months and I average around 32s - my 3-look LL is very fast (haven&#x27;t  <br>
yet learned OLL) but my F2L is horrible.<br>
I use an intuitive method, cross on bottom, and many of the moves I  <br>
can &quot;see&quot; are not optimal at all - it should be around 6-7 moves per  <br>
pair and many cases for me are much more than that.<br>
<br>
My question is, what is the general way of doing F2L, intuitively or  <br>
by memorization (or a mixture of both?).<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; My averages are like you : around 25 (best : 23.77)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; But I average 13~14 seconds for the F2L and 11 seconds (!!!) for  <br>
&gt; the LL.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; To improve my F2L times, I used Macky&#x27;s Tips<br>
&gt; (http://cubefreak.hp.infoseek.co.jp/speedcubing_tips.html) + I had a<br>
&gt; F2L cube which is very useful to improve your F2L.<br>
&gt; Another important thing is to be able to use FreeSlots when you do the<br>
&gt; 3 first F2L when it&#x27;s necessary.<br>
&gt; You should also try to see what you can do when you have 2 F2L done<br>
&gt; but not correctly placed in order to save them.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; For me, I have to work on the LL :p.<br>

Is it really that bad? Also, do you place the elements yourself or do 
you use the layout managers?

Ok, looking at a screenshot it&#x27;s pretty obvious you do make good use 
of layout managers. But I&#x27;d be surprised if there were big problems in 
different OSs/WindowManagers. Have you seen problems in the past or 
even have screenshots of them?

Doesn&#x27;t there seem to be an awful lot of CA

There should be some sort of limit because everytime I
turn around there is yet another tournament in CA.

To me it just seems like the people in the CA area are
going to have quite an advantage against the people in
other states.  It just seems to me that we as a US
should have a couple &quot;opens&quot; a year just like the rest
of the nonUS countries do. Perhaps only have 1-3 a
year instead of 5-7

I think it would be better to put the first paragraph of the proof 
before your claim, otherwise the claim talks about things that haven&#x27;t 
been defined yet.

What do you mean the reference colors will change? This sentence is a 
bit unclear to me.

You could also say that F2 is just FF and F&#x27; is just FFF and R is just 
yFy&#x27; etc without proving them all separately.

It is the first successful event under the regulation of WCA. <br>
Yuki Hayashi, unofficial record holder of 4x4x4, hit the new world <br>

The times were 01:00.38, 01:04.10, 01:10.44 (average = 01:04.97). <br>

It may take some time to edit the videotape but we will put his all <br>

You can see the results on my web site temporally. <br>

Get the point?

I don&#x27;t see why we should restrict the number of tournaments just 
because other people aren&#x27;t lucky enough to have as many.

<br>
I think both.<br>
You should first try to do most of them by yourself.<br>
Then if you want, you can check with F2L algorithm list.<br>
But the problem with that list is that it&#x27;s for the last F2L.<br>
So it works for all of them, but in some cases they are not optimal<br>
because of free slots you could use to do F2L.<br>
<br>
So:<br>
1. Search yourself (not only when timing, for exemple take a<br>
situation, then search what you can do. )<br>
2. With time and practice, you&#x27;ll find other ways (better ?) to do some F2L.<br>
3. If you want to have some idea, check the F2L algorithms list but<br>
don&#x27;t study it stupidly.<br>
&quot;Make sense of what you&#x27;re doing.&quot;<br>

doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t go to California.  You are certainly welcome to
compete in any of the Caltech tournaments that are held, I&#x27;m sure. :P

          <div class="email-content">The more I think about it, the less fair your suggestions seems! 
Perhaps you are forgetting how big the United States is?  This year,
there are a total of 3 planned tournaments in California.  The next
closest tournament is OVER 1700 miles away.

Almost every tournament in Europe is within about 1000 miles from the
furthest one, which gives you (I am assuming you&#x27;re from Europe?) a
total of 7 competitions.  Just look at the SCC Events page!  The New
York competition is just about as far from the California competitions
as it is from the Dutch Open!  I&#x27;m having trouble seeing what&#x27;s so
unfair and who it is unfair to.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Ok, looking at a screenshot it&#x27;s pretty obvious you do make good use <br>
&gt; of layout managers. But I&#x27;d be surprised if there were big problems in <br>
&gt; different OSs/WindowManagers. Have you seen problems in the past or <br>
&gt; even have screenshots of them?<br>
&gt; <br>

<br>
AWT is not so much a &#x27;problem&#x27; as it is an annoyance. The programs<br>
function fine and are still usable, they just have totally different<br>
appearances on each OS I use it on. I like swing because it promises<br>
that the GUI will look fine on any OS that supports a full JRE. I have<br>
a few minimal-type window managers I use in Linux that don&#x27;t have<br>
native buttons (or even decent fonts), so AWT wouldn&#x27;t work in that<br>
case. I just like making stuff that I will be able to use on any<br>
computer in my house (or any computer in anyone else&#x27;s house I guess) :)<br>
<br>
Applet programming is a little different because you have to use awt<br>
(at least you did the last time I made an applet). That&#x27;s why some<br>
java applets don&#x27;t work on some of my computers. I have an X Server<br>
running, but not a powerful window manager. Only swing works for me in<br>
that case.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m planning on buying a StackmatTimer.<br>
But I&#x27;m hesitating between the regular large Mat or the MiniMat.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m only planning to use it to solve cubes, magic and small puzzles.<br>
<br>
There is no price difference.<br>
Is it really useful to have the large Mat to solve cubes ?<br>
Or is it mostly a problem because of the size ?<br>
<br>
Or is the best solution to have both ? :p<br>
(+10$ is not that much, and it could be useful on travel, etc)<br>

What do you think ? <br>

          <div class="email-content">Alright - let me rephrase my question.  As I have
realized through some of the replies to it apparently
I didn&#x27;t appropriately word it.

Is there a MAX number of tourney&#x27;s a &quot;group&quot; can hold
in a calendar year? Does the WCA have a set number of
Tournaments it is willing to approve for a year?

I was pointed to the fact that I can view all the
tournaments on the SCC page (which I didn&#x27;t know, and
I see that CA has only had 3 to date). So I apologize
for that - just seems like so many more :)

In my very humble opinion, you&#x27;re all jerks.  I spent a good $684 
flying to New York for a tournament.  I also plan to drive a total of 
26 hours from Pasadena to Dallas, Texas to hold a tournament.  My 
friends have agreed to help out at the tournament in Dallas, Texas and 
they&#x27;re probably investing a total of about $800 just so we&#x27;re holding 
a tournament outside of California.

I&#x27;m not really arguing anymore.  You&#x27;re idiots.

I just don&#x27;t think that Caltech should be allowed to hold as many
OFFICIAL tournaments as they do.  that&#x27;s because official tournaments
are where official world records can be set, so if they&#x27;re always
attended by the same people, being the people at Caltech, will most
likely always have the official world records.  making it a little bit
unfair.

   Can&#x27;t we hold our own tournament pending we meet
the prior requirements laid out by the WCA?  I don&#x27;t
believe that any of us were asking you to spend any of
your own out of pocket expenses for a tournament that
is outside of your area.  I agree that you work hard
and put on good tournaments - I have seen them and
heard about them - that isn&#x27;t an issue.  If you
have/had the money to get to NY and to Dallas more
power to you, no one is disputing that - especially if
you volunteer to attend.  
   I am just making sure that it would be totally
feasible for myself to hold my own tournament if the
requirements were met.  True?



Philia,
Crispy

I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re talking about.  I&#x27;ve done some Java
programming, and I&#x27;ve never heard of the window manager affecting
whether or not you can run AWT or Swing.  The only thing that I could
think of that would affect this is whether or not the classes are
present in your JRE (Java runtime environment).  Or maybe this is a
Kaffe vs. Sun JVM problem that you are talking about.

You can make applets that use Swing.  Swing wasn&#x27;t included in the
Microsoft JVM, but there were still ways to make it work (see
http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=135132).

          <div class="email-content">Hi friendz,

Everyone is free to organize a tournament. For official tournaments we do need someone attending, whom can fully trust. He/she can be the WCA delegate, and will make sure that the full WCA regulations are followed.

The problem is that there are only a few of us willing to offer time (and money) to organize events. There are some people out there who did this, some did it a few times. But it was ALWAYS to help other people, instead of for their own benefit. Cube tournaments have always been great, kind of like big reunions.

It is absolutely unfair to complain if there is no tournament in your neighborhood. What prevents you from organizing one?
And if you REALLY want to attend a tournament, then what prevents you from going to one?

This is to ALL of you. If you are thinking of organizing a tournament, then just do it!
If you contact Tyson, Gilles or me, then maybe we can help.

Have fun,

Ron

No complaining please!

     Can&#x27;t we hold our own tournament pending we meet
  the prior requirements laid out by the WCA?  I don&#x27;t
  believe that any of us were asking you to spend any of
  your own out of pocket expenses for a tournament that
  is outside of your area.  I agree that you work hard
  and put on good tournaments - I have seen them and
  heard about them - that isn&#x27;t an issue.  If you
  have/had the money to get to NY and to Dallas more
  power to you, no one is disputing that - especially if
  you volunteer to attend.  
     I am just making sure that it would be totally
  feasible for myself to hold my own tournament if the
  requirements were met.  True?



  Philia,
  Crispy

          <div class="email-content">All right, my last post.  I promise, and I&#x27;ll be nicer in this one.<br>
<br>
If you&#x27;ll notice for the 2005 year, there has only been one tournament <br>
held so far in Southern California.  In October, we will hold the <br>
Caltech Fall tournament so that will be two tournaments in Southern <br>
California.  In Northern California, there was the San Francisco <br>
tournament—that makes one.  If we hold another one, then it would be <br>
two tournaments.<br>
<br>
As you can clearly see, not one of these locations is have an  <br>
excessive number of tournaments.  Furthermore, given the number of <br>
cubers in Southern California, I would think that four tournaments each <br>
year was a good number.  That&#x27;s one tournament every three months and <br>
each one of these tournaments is bringing in over 40 people.<br>
<br>
The Chevron gas station on Hill Ave. and Colorado Ave. in Pasadena to <br>
the Chevron gas station in San Mateo, California on 4th Ave. is 370 <br>
miles.  That&#x27;s about 6 hours of driving.  5 and a half if I don&#x27;t make <br>
too many stops.  For all purposes, Northern California and Southern <br>
California are separate regions.  With the exception of Texas, a six <br>
hour drive easily puts you across state boarders.  And on the east <br>
cost, would put you across two or three.<br>
<br>
I spend a lot of time and energy organizing these tournaments.  It <br>
should be conceivable to you that perhaps it is much more feasible for <br>
you to come to Caltech or San Francisco than it is for me to go to your <br>
home and hold a tournament there.  I cannot do these tournaments <br>
without my friends.  The success in these tournaments lie in people <br>
such as Mark Team or Sleeping Leyan and Blindfoldmasterwoman Shelley.  <br>
Without these people, the tournaments would not run smoothly.  You <br>
might be able to ask me to host a tournament near you, but I can&#x27;t <br>
possibly ask all of these people to come with me every where I go.<br>
<br>
The origin of our tournament in Dallas was simple: I was thinking of <br>
museums, Shelley suggest the Science Place, they liked the idea, and I <br>
have been working with them since February to make this tournament <br>
happen.  If you want a tournament somewhere, how am I supposed to make <br>
it happen if you go around complaining about tournaments in California? <br>
  That doesn&#x27;t give me ANY information on where a tournament should be <br>
held.<br>
<br>
Take note of competitors like Bob and Macky.  Bob has been to San <br>
Francisco, Chicago, New York... you name, he&#x27;s there.  He&#x27;ll be in <br>
Dallas too.  Macky has been to Pasadena, naturally, but he&#x27;s also <br>
traveled to San Francisco and New York, and he&#x27;ll be off to Dallas as <br>
well.  Simply said, these are dedicated cubers willing to make the <br>
effort of travel.  There are opportunities here in the United States <br>
for Rubik&#x27;s Cube competitions, and they go ahead and take these <br>
opportunities.<br>
<br>
You complain about not having the resources.  I am NOT a welfare <br>
program.  If you are really that great at the Rubik&#x27;s Cube, then <br>
someone would sponsor you.  If not, all you need is the desire and <br>
determination to make these things happen.  If you wanted to come to <br>
California to compete, and you wanted it bad enough, I&#x27;m sure you can <br>
accomplish it.  The fact of the matter is you have a computer and that <br>
alone says that you have the resources and the intelligence to make <br>
things happens.  The motivation and determination, well, that you&#x27;ll <br>
have to dig up yourself.<br>
<br>
You claim why should you have to invest money so that I can go to your <br>
tournament?  Well, you&#x27;ve treated me in such a manner that I don&#x27;t <br>
think I would be willing to spend my own money to help you set up your <br>
own tournament, nor would I be willing to spend the time.  Your <br>
complaining shows a lack of understanding of the amount of work and <br>
energy that goes in to these tournaments.  You should notice that I <br>
generally don&#x27;t compete at the tournaments which I&#x27;m in charge in.  <br>
That should be an indication of the demands of running the tournament.<br>
<br>
As a final note, I will take your complaining as a compliment because <br>
you have noticed that a great deal of competitions are held under the <br>
Caltech name and I thank you for recognizing my hard work.<br>

  Oh, and by the way...<br>
<br>
  Buy your own 2x2x2!  Puzzle sharing on a small scale is all right, but <br>
  you all need to make an effort to get your own puzzles.  With a lot of <br>
  puzzle sharing, you start to hold back the tournament and it gets <br>
  really frustrating.  I&#x27;m warning you ALL in advance for all future <br>
  tournaments... go buy your own 2x2x2, NOW!<br>
<br>
  World Championships will be very tight on time and if there&#x27;s any <br>
  delay, such as something like (oh, he has my 2x2x2), we&#x27;ll probably <br>
  have to skip you.  We can&#x27;t lose that much stage time because you <br>
  didn&#x27;t bring your own puzzle.<br>

What you really need to think about is not that it&#x27;s unfair that<br>
California has 4 tournaments a year, but there&#x27;s 4 chances per year<br>
you may be able to come to one. Heck just a few years ago, there were<br>
no tournaments at all to go to, and now that they are organized (very<br>
well I must say) and more frequent, I find it hard to believe that any<br>
speedcubers would complain about this. Just in the past year Tyson and<br>
Caltech has done more to grow the sport especially in CALIFORNIA where<br>
he LIVES than anyone else has done wherever they live.<br>
<br>
Get off your butt, quit complaining, and do something about it. Do<br>
some public cubing, try to get on TV somehow with your amazing talent<br>
to get it some exposure in your area, just do something, be creative.<br>
You have to generate some interest where you live if you ever hope to<br>

If the cube is treated as symmetric, that is, all face turns are 
equivalent, and if we accept that such a thing as flipped edges 
exist, any quarter turn must flip at least one edge. Due to 
symmetry, four edges must be flipped in a quarter turn. 

The flip can be defined as follows:

- An edge cubie is not flipped if it can be returned to its original 
position correctly oriented using an even number of quarter turns. 
(zero is also an even number!)

- An edge cubie is flipped if it can be returned to its original 
position correctly oriented using an odd number of quarter turns.

This definition is maybe not ideal when, for instance, solving LL, 
but it is a definition that treats all face turn equivalent.

That&#x27;s my point. For the edges, the cube can be considered as 
symmetrical and still the flip can be defined. See my other post. I 
have not found a way to do this for the twist of the corners. 
Something like your definition below is maybe the best we can 
achieve.

          <div class="email-content">I wholeheartedly concur.  Look at Bob Burton.  He travelled to Caltech to cube from New Jersey.  He went to Chicago to compete.  I have the sneaking suspicion he&#x27;ll crop up in Dallas, too.  Why don&#x27;t you try to do the same thing?<br>
<br>
I realize you&#x27;re only 16.  Even so, if it bothered you so much, you could find a way to get there.  This advice may seem harsh, but it&#x27;s coming from someone working 7 day weeks in order to pay for a trip to Germany in a few weeks.<br>
<br>
Caltech tournaments should not be limited in number simply because they&#x27;re in the state of California.  For one thing, it&#x27;s a very large state.  Even many California cubers have long commutes to get there.  Also, I don&#x27;t understand why you think the community as a whole shouldn&#x27;t try for as many good tournaments as possible.  This gives more people a chance to compete, more exposure for the community, and gives the individual competitors the most chances to improve.<br>
<br>
I understand you&#x27;re somewhat limited in your travel abilities, not only due to your age and financial situations, but also your location.  You&#x27;re 900 miles from Caltech.  I&#x27;m twice as far.  I&#x27;ve missed out on a lot of tournaments I&#x27;d liked to have attended because of this.  It&#x27;s still no grounds to be bitter.  It only makes my resolve to get to future tournaments and compete well that much stronger.<br>

Actually, I think the problem isn&#x27;t that much of a problem.  The <br>
elastic band on the blindfold I have is very loose.  With the tighter <br>
ones, the blindfolds hurt your eyes and face enough that there&#x27;s no way <br>

I like this idea....just make a single plastic covering that&#x27;s about
2-3 feet wide, and maybe a foot high on the table, so your hands can
fit under it comfortably.

wait....what&#x27;s wrong with just wearing a blindfold?

          <div class="email-content">Well looking over his original post, I think he just feels it is 
unfair that a disproportionate number of tournemnts are held in CA. 
And from that alone, it does appear to be unfair for the rest of us.

The obvious solution would be to limit the number of *offical* 
tournaments. (It&#x27;s of course not possible to limit unoffical 
tournaments.) However, say there are 5 nearly identical tournaments 
at location X one year, and the limit is 3. Who gets to decide which 
of those 3 are offical... it&#x27;s kind of a toss-up.

World rankings will differ depending on that decision, and even if 
it is decided in advance, there is always the chance for bad-timing 
to happen... a very fast guy is out of town, or another very fast 
guy just happens to be visiting from out of town.

So setting limits is not the best solution.

It seems to me like anyone with enough experience can attempt to set 
up a tournament where they deem fit. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s fair to ask for 18 
months experience in the cubing community. It&#x27;s also a must to have 
someone trusted on site, and that person may or may not be the site 
coordinator. Most people that have been around for over 5 years or 
have ran previous tournements ought to be trustworthy enough, 
pending WCA decision....

Crispy, you failed to mention *WHERE* you would like a tournament to 
be held.... Instead of simply complaining, if you be more specific 
maybe somebody here is willing to help you out.

I am at the initial planning stages of a tournament for the Midwest 
area, which seems to be lacking. Hopefully I can work something out 
with Tyson, Jon, and Jake on it. Though I do note that one was done 
in Chicago about 6 months ago already.

I don&#x27;t want to conflict with anyone else&#x27;s tournament, or I&#x27;d like 
to get permission to work out a symmutaneous/distributed tournament 
like they do for ARML. That would mean starting everything on two 
(or more) sites at the same time, have the same events, and use 
identical scrambles. (This is regardless of time zones, but the 
scrambles would have to be held under the tightest security and be 
devolged at the latest possible moment.)

So as for what Ron said about lack of time and money.... *I am 
willing to offer the time*. Now money.... that&#x27;s another issue, but 
I&#x27;m sure I could get some help on that from some of you guys out 
there (or corporate sponsorship). Though typically entry fees oughta 
cover it in most cases.

Note that it&#x27;s still quite speculative and there&#x27;s already lots of 
stuff already planned for the remainder of the year, so this is more 
for say January... and I&#x27;ll be trying to get Tyson&#x27;s help on it.

Alright let&#x27;s have a vote... maybe oughta do a poll here. Where 
should it be and when?

I want a LOT of feed back.

Location:
  Chicago metro
  Chicago suburbs
  Kalamazoo
  Ann Arbor (my town)
  Other

Time:
  Same time as Dallas (means I won&#x27;t have to go, but that requires 
quick action as it&#x27;s coming soon and an OK from Tyson)
  September (not same weekend as the other tournament in Europe)
  October (our retaliation for not being able to go to Dutch cube 
day)
  November (no, it out to be a rule that no tournaments may be held 
on the same month as a WC)
  December? (maybe too soon after WC and who wants to travel around 
the holidays?)
  late-January (sounds evenly placed there)
  or some other time later?


-Doug

P.S. - Is it just me, or don&#x27;t you all think that Erno Rubik is 
whealthy enough he could/should setup an endowment fund for cube-
related travel expenses. (There could be a committee overseeing 
it...)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Everyone,<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the kind words about my stickers.  If you like the <br>
Tiles, I&#x27;ll have new ones next week with a rougher surface for better <br>
grip.  <br>
<br>
Anyway here&#x27;s the rules for winning the Sunday Contest Prize:<br>
<br>
The winner of the contest will receive a set of stickers for any six-<br>
color puzzle of his or her choice.  The winner will then be <br>
ineligible to win again for 4 weeks of participation, but will <br>
continue earn &quot;tokens&quot; or random drawing entries for consecutive <br>
participations in the Sunday Contest; See next paragraph.<br>
<br>
    In addition to having a winner for speed, a random drawing will <br>
be held for a set of randomly chosen stickers. Winners will be <br>
ineligible for 4 participations in the contest.  For every <br>
consecutive participation participants will get an additional &quot;token&quot; <br>
or entry into the drawing for the next week. So the more that you <br>
participate, the better the chances that you&#x27;ll win the drawing.<br>
 <br>
<br>
As you can see it is well worth it to enter as any random entry can <br>
win!!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I am 100% against this.  I think we should require the cuber to
resticker their cube with provided sticker sheets, or if that is too
expensive the cuber&#x27;s own.

This means that the cube will be stiff and hard to use triggers on. 
Also who&#x27;s going to buy the cubes?  The organizer him/herself? 
Stickers are cheaper anyway.

Also you can&#x27;t put your cube together such that if a piece pops you
know how to put it back in.  A new cube won&#x27;t have your internal
&quot;system&quot; for the pieces.  So if you pop on a new cube you&#x27;re screwed,
rather than being able to continue on your own cube.

I like the spirit of the idea, but lets just replace the stickers only.

I agree.  I don&#x27;t see anything to be unfair about the CA tournaments.

I think limiting the tournaments is a terrible idea and am completely

Aren&#x27;t there already rules about who can run a tournament?  I could be
wrong...

There is WAY too much complaining going on about things lately.

I am also trying to plan a tournament for this Fall.  Since I started
the Rutgers Univ. Rubik&#x27;s Cube Club, I can get funding from the school
and the school can be used as a venue without having to worry about
paying for equipment or whatever.  Though not in the Midwest, there
haven&#x27;t been many east coast competitions here, either, so hopefully
this would spark some more interest in the area.

Where is Kalamazoo?  Ann Arbor?  Sorry, I&#x27;m not actually from the
Midwest.  I would be interested in attending, though (I am taking too
many days off from school as it is already, however...)

At the same time as Dallas seems a little soon since it&#x27;s only a month
away, and you really should advertise for it, hype it up, etc, ya
know?  I wouldn&#x27;t really worry too much about conflicting with other
tournaments since those who would attend this tournament would
probably not already be attending a different one that is occuring
simultaneously, right?

          <div class="email-content">I *kinda* see what you mean. I was watching Tyson&#x27;s bld pop last 
night, and it was freakin&#x27; hilarious.

So what you say is that if an edge pops out, it is possible that the 
cuber &quot;knows&quot; how to place it back properly. So that&#x27;s good I 
suppose. Is that allowed though?

I&#x27;m not sure what the WCA rules and regulations say about pops 
during bld events. This needs to be spelled out I think.

Actually in addition to reschemeing my new cubes and putting on new 
stickers, I organize the pieces such that I could tell if any cubey 
is orientated or not.

I&#x27;m sure it would be frowned upon however, if one does the bld solve 
by pulling al the pieces out and placing them back in all 
oriented... but in the same permutaions....

But from what LarsP was saying, I think it&#x27;s more serious than 
stickers. Other cheating is possible... certain dents *under* the 
stickers for example. Heck any cube, if I look hard enough could 
find something distinctive.

I am very (and I mean very, or used to be) observant about certain 
things. I recall once I was able to get a run of like 50 three-card 
monty games due to my observational skills, the back of cards have 
slight ink blots that most poeple might not see. (won losts of money 
too :) )

So all I was trying to do was expound on someone else&#x27;s post about 
the possibilities.

I was careful to say this, when I used the word &quot;decent&quot; I meant for 
the definition to be left open-ended. So in this case I would say 
that decent means not &quot;stiff or hard to use triggers on.&quot;

Which is something that WCA tournaments are supposed to provide 
anyways according to the rules and regulations that Tyson and Ron 
drafted. So it *shouldn&#x27;t* be overly taxing for the organizers.

I&#x27;d like to hear some more opinions! Other takers?

I accept that. Though I&#x27;m not even much of a blindfolded cuber, so I

I&#x27;d point it out; glad it has already been considered.

          <div class="email-content">You can&#x27;t expect any cuber to perform at his/her best without using
one&#x27;s own cube.  The cube should be inspected before the solve for any

Maybe it seems very hard and mysterious if you haven&#x27;t been to a <br>

cube you are EASILY both smart enough and have enough free time to have <br>
no excuse for not doing it yourself.<br>
<br>
If you attempt to use the local science museum and attract media <br>
attention it&#x27;s a whole different level, but to do a small simple <br>
&quot;garage&quot; tournament with a dozen or two people is so simple I really <br>
don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s stopping people. And don&#x27;t worry about making <br>
the first one &quot;official&quot; if that seems hard. Unless you plan to break <br>
some world records it really doesn&#x27;t matter.<br>
<br>
Sure, your first attempt will not be perfect, but it will work, and the <br>
next will be much better. You probably didn&#x27;t solve the cube in 20 <br>
seconds the first day you tried either. If you first attend an other <br>
tournament and see how they do it, you&#x27;ll learn a lot, but if that&#x27;s <br>
impractical, don&#x27;t let that stop you. You&#x27;ll figure it out.<br>
<br>
Finally, look at other sports. I can&#x27;t think of one that limits the <br>
number of competitions allowed in an area. And none that would consider <br>
4 competitions in a state with 36 million people a lot.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks for all the kind words about my stickers.  If you like the<br>

&gt; grip.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Anyway here&#x27;s the rules for winning the Sunday Contest Prize:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The winner of the contest will receive a set of stickers for any six-<br>
&gt; color puzzle of his or her choice.  The winner will then be<br>
&gt; ineligible to win again for 4 weeks of participation, but will<br>
&gt; continue earn &quot;tokens&quot; or random drawing entries for consecutive<br>
&gt; participations in the Sunday Contest; See next paragraph.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;     In addition to having a winner for speed, a random drawing will<br>
&gt; be held for a set of randomly chosen stickers. Winners will be<br>
&gt; ineligible for 4 participations in the contest.  For every<br>
&gt; consecutive participation participants will get an additional &quot;token&quot;<br>
&gt; or entry into the drawing for the next week. So the more that you<br>
&gt; participate, the better the chances that you&#x27;ll win the drawing.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As you can see it is well worth it to enter as any random entry can<br>
&gt; win!!<br>

Ok we need to collect these and put them on a site somewhere... I

...if you dated a girl primarily because you saw her with a cube.

...if every girl you ever dated now owns a cube.

...if you get late-night cravings to solve a rubik&#x27;s cube and don&#x27;t 
have to turn on any lights to do it.

...if you ever considered Rubik&#x27;s cubes as an interior design idea.

...if there is/was a giant rubik&#x27;s cube dangling from your light 
fixtures, celling, or protruding out of a wall.

...if you fell like your sticking out in a crowd *without* a cube in 
hand.

...if you started becomming interested in dating a co-worker *after* 
she brought a square-1 to work one afternoon.

...if you you would consider marrying a girl that could solve the 
cube in under 30s.

...if you have a car painted in the form of a rubik&#x27;s cube.

...if your licence plate is &quot;SPD QBR&quot;.

...if you know the names of the two individuals whom the last two

Durning most of the 80&#x27;s 22.95s was the offical world record. It was 
held by Minh Thai and done at the 1982 world championships in 
Budapest, Hungery.

And don&#x27;t call yourself a noob..., that&#x27;s our job :).

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
Its seems like there are quite a few ppl who think about the actual<br>
WCA rules: Timers, 45° rule, stickers, scrambles, number of official<br>
competitions.... And this is good! Well but how can a cuber influence<br>
these rules? If he only has the choice of talking over the topic in<br>
this group he may feel his powerlessness and will get frustrated.<br>
Obviously some ppl arent too happy with some decisions and the actual<br>
power of some young and very engaged member of the WCA. At the same<br>
time those engaged ppl did something for us all. So we gotta be<br>
thankfull as well.<br>
My opinion:<br>
As quite all of us live in democratic systems i think it would be fair<br>
to elect the ppl who make the rules for us!<br>
It will be a lot of work and sure discussions will start too about who<br>
and how can be elected. Its time to start that discussion i think.  <br>
So  ..what do u guys think about that idea?<br>
Didn&#x27;t i read something like &quot;after some time for installing WCA there<br>
will be elections&quot; a while ago... so ..lets do it before the rules get<br>
too solid!<br>
<br>
I d like to thank the WCA Members, but i also think its time to get<br>
some more democracy into it.<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">GOOD CALL. No offense to anybody, but WCA oughta be bigger and more 
democratically elected...

and personally there are a few rules I don&#x27;t agree fully with.

though after a vote the members may be exactly the same... :)

Sound is perceived spatially, too -- we have 2 ears!  Everyone knows 
that it is easier to pick out individual instruments/voices from a 
stereo recording than a mono recording.  Binaural is significantly 
better, as it puts the sound image outside your head: left/right, 
near/far, up/down are easy to distinguish; though, surprisingly, 
front/back isn&#x27;t such an easy distinction to make (at least not for me).

No, I&#x27;m not suggesting that anyone could pick out each of 1000 
simultaneaously spoken words from a binaural recording.  But the 
spatial information should help.

          <div class="email-content">Alright, slight misunderstanding I suppose. Seems to be lots of 
those around here.

You know, we all (ESPECiALLY ME) need to try and sound more polite 
and nice around here, too many &quot;flames&quot; start up that make lots of 
people feel bad for no good reason.

Take it easy everyone :)!

And I do simply mean *sound* nicer, cuz I&#x27;m sure we are all nice 
people in real life, but shit happens. Misunderstandings, 
incorrectly read connotation/tone, differing styles of sarcasms, 
poor taste in humor, bad mood.... lead to making people feel *less 
then thrilled* about posting in the future.

I&#x27;m sure we have driven away many members over the years because 
lots of people won&#x27;t/can&#x27;t put up with the un-intentional rudeness 
that occurs in fourms (not just ours, in fact the other fourms I&#x27;m 
on it&#x27;s much worst).

Lots of times a paritally formed idea or suggestion pops into our 
heads and before we have time to ponder it, we post it. Just 
expecting some &quot;constructive feedback&quot; and not to be attacked.

Sometimes we just look the other way and think &quot;oh he had it 
comming&quot;, but I have seen many threads run on and on... falling way 
off topic. Threads that go on forever is like X-Files running 2 
seasons too much, nobody wants to see that happen right?

Let&#x27;s try to stay away from anything personal (i.e. personal 
attacks, lol). I leave myself wide open for personal attacks all the 
time in fact, :). And before you try to help, double check your not 
just fanning the flames... if in doubt don&#x27;t post and leave room for 
material of substance. Over 17000 posts here, how many of them are 
worth keeping becuse they are actually useful?


==Benefit of the doubt, k?==

Oh and to Crispy:
&quot;DUDE!, you still haven&#x27;t told us where you&#x27;d like a tournament to 
be held. At least two of us asked, I guess you must have missed 
it... I want to help. I&#x27;ve been getting interested in the tournament 
running buisness lately.&quot;

Er... I guess you mean that an image seen by one eye already has a lot 
of spatial information in it, whereas that heard by one ear 
has &quot;none&quot;.  It&#x27;s hard to disagree with you there. :)

[Nevertheless, I now remember reading that people with only one good 
ear can still locate sounds to a limited extent.  Perhaps because the 
frequency-dependent filtering done by the outer ear and the rest of the 
head will &quot;colour&quot; a complex sound, depending on the source direction --
 at least, I cannot imagine what else could be involved.  Will have to 
dig around in psychoacoustics texts again sometime...]

If some people like to do the work and organize a lot of 
competitions thats just great. I think there are quite many 
competitions in northern and middle Europe too.

By the way, it would be nice with some foreign guests at the swedish

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan and others,<br>
<br>
Thanks for your feedback.<br>
<br>
Recently we opened the WCA forum to discuss official regulations and other WCA subjects.<br>
http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum<br>
So this is the place to send your suggestions.<br>
<br>
I think the main problem is that WCA is not a full time job for us, so establishing WCA has taken more time than expected.<br>
I had a lot of offers for help from people, but in the end NOONE has done much. (Still thanks to all these nice people!)<br>
<br>
Our schedule up to a full establishment is:<br>
1) finalize the 2005 version of the regulations (not many changes, just improvements and clarifications)<br>
2) finalize the website<br>
3) legally establish WCA<br>
<br>
For 1) we took ALL your comments on this group and from e-mails, and we are working on a new proposal.<br>
For 2) I did have a little help, but noone has done what he has promised. It is probably too boring to do this. No problem, but it is taking more time. :-(<br>
For 3) we are still in the process of defining what our goals exactly are. In the meantime we are investigating legal actions we need to take care of. This is international, so more complicated than I thought it was.<br>
<br>
After that there can be elections. So before going democratic, first some people need to do the dirty work.<br>
<br>
Although I agree on some of your points, I recall the saying &quot;bachelor&#x27;s wives and maiden&#x27;s children are well trained&quot;.<br>
<br>
I am very willing to retire. (4 tournaments I am working on, my own website that is taking me a lot of time, actually WCA costs me a lot of money, etcetera)<br>
So anyone: discharge me if you can do better. But I will check whether you do better! :-) Do not underestimate this.<br>
<br>
Anyway, we are always looking for help. So if you can do something: tell me!<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
  Hi all,<br>
<br>
  Its seems like there are quite a few ppl who think about the actual<br>
  WCA rules: Timers, 45° rule, stickers, scrambles, number of official<br>
  competitions.... And this is good! Well but how can a cuber influence<br>
  these rules? If he only has the choice of talking over the topic in<br>
  this group he may feel his powerlessness and will get frustrated.<br>
  Obviously some ppl arent too happy with some decisions and the actual<br>
  power of some young and very engaged member of the WCA. At the same<br>
  time those engaged ppl did something for us all. So we gotta be<br>
  thankfull as well.<br>
  My opinion:<br>
  As quite all of us live in democratic systems i think it would be fair<br>
  to elect the ppl who make the rules for us!<br>
  It will be a lot of work and sure discussions will start too about who<br>
  and how can be elected. Its time to start that discussion i think.  <br>
  So  ..what do u guys think about that idea?<br>
  Didn&#x27;t i read something like &quot;after some time for installing WCA there<br>
  will be elections&quot; a while ago... so ..lets do it before the rules get<br>
  too solid!<br>
<br>
  I d like to thank the WCA Members, but i also think its time to get<br>
  some more democracy into it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Tyson and I talked a couple of times and thought a tournament in the middle of October was the most reasonably placed.  I, too, would like to help out however possible.<br>
<br>
We&#x27;ve already had one tournament in Chicago&#x27;s suburbs, but it seemed to work well enough.  I never heard of any travel complaints.  I would also like to offer the possibility of a tournament in or around Minneapolis, Minnesota.  It&#x27;s comprable distance for me to Chicago, but I&#x27;m farmiliar with the area.  There are lots of great possible venues.<br>
<br>
Somebody shoot me an email and we can perhaps plan something.<br>

  &gt; &gt; I am at the initial planning stages of a tournament for the <br>
  Midwest <br>
  &gt; &gt; area, which seems to be lacking. Hopefully I can work something <br>
  out <br>
  &gt; &gt; with Tyson, Jon, and Jake on it. <br>
<br>
  I&#x27;ll help however I can.<br>
<br>
<br>
  &gt; Though not in the Midwest, there<br>
  &gt; haven&#x27;t been many east coast competitions here, either, so <br>
  hopefully<br>
  &gt; this would spark some more interest in the area.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,<br>
A year or so ago you wrote that beginning with FL followed by CLL you <br>
could hardly count on an average under 26 secs.<br>
Why?!<br>
A man who does F2L in 9s, Must (with some practising) do FL in 6s. Then <br>
CLL in 2s. Notice that the average lengths of the algs here are shorter <br>
than e.g. with Friedrich, as you have the middle slice to your disposal.<br>
Then 3 interchanges of edges between slice and LL (à 1.5s?) followed by <br>
rotation in the slice.(1s) To that 2 or 3 inline moves.<br>
Where am I that mistaken?<br>
I agree that for me it seems incredible, but so does F2L in 9s as the <br>
whole cube in 15s (but nevertheless it does exist).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Gah... why is it that I&#x27;m always providing entertainment?  On a side <br>
note, as soon as I get a video camera, I will be sending an application <br>
into that Beauty and the Geek.  I&#x27;m at the freakin&#x27; Very Large Array... <br>
that&#x27;s gotta be geeky enough.<br>
<br>
I actually don&#x27;t use the same cube for BLD as my normal speed cube but <br>
I could.  My normal cube risks popping more and so that&#x27;s why I go with <br>
a different cube for BLD.  I should make the note that at Horace Mann, <br>
I hadn&#x27;t really completed a BLD solve... ever, so I really wasn&#x27;t sure <br>
what I was doing.  I had kind of done one at the JFK airport while <br>
waiting for the shuttle that never came but that was about it.<br>
<br>
Most, if not all, cubers use the same color scheme that they do for <br>
speed solving.  It&#x27;s what we&#x27;re used to.<br>
<br>
What I&#x27;ve done with my stickers is that I have the edges all facing a <br>
certain way so that when it pops out, I know which way to put it back <br>
in.  Now, I&#x27;ll be honest... I popped, but I was in the middle of an <br>
algorithm, and I thought about it, and decided heck, there&#x27;s no way I <br>
was going to be able to figure that out on stage so I gave up.  I think <br>
I might be able to do it today though, with more BLD experience under <br>
my belt.  If you still want more explanation, just wait for the Toy <br>
Fair and Leyan will explain what I&#x27;m talking about in person.  It&#x27;s <br>
much more easily understood that way.<br>
<br>
I would consider taking pieces out and orienting them to be cheating.  <br>
However, I would also challenge anyone to beat me on a BLD solve by <br>
doing that.  Even J. Bernett Orlando.  I&#x27;m convinced that taking out <br>
the necessary pieces and feeling and then putting back in would be <br>
disorienting, and time consuming enough that it would not provide any <br>
type of advantage.  Orienting pieces takes maybe... 10 seconds of <br>
memorization at the most, and 25 seconds of execution on my part.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t think we need cubes yet.  As Chris Hardwick said, perhaps <br>
stickers are all that are necessary.<br>

Just joking :) ...  But you bring up a good point with venues.  I&#x27;m 
not sure how we feel about having the event in a public location.  
Cause the public library is the only good place that&#x27;s coming to mind.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,

My post wasnt ment to critisize you, far away. I really enjoyed EM2004
for example. It must have been lots of work and yes indeed.. i didnt
manage to thank u expressly. And what did in fact surprised me the
most...It was free! (Or did i miss something?) I dont want to get u
out of ur job u are obviusly doing like nobody else of us could.
Respect and thanks!
The idea of the democracy isn&#x27;t just about elections its also about to
approve ur work. U would then know that we are very proud of u!
Another point is: If the rules are base on the majorities will by a 
transparent system nobody can really complain anymore. (Well we know
there always will be a few). And btw i could imagine a WCA Fee. So
donating WCA cubers will get registered and will have their voice in
an election or something like that. U dont have to pay all the
expenses from ur own pocket! I d like to spent some money into it! 
And to all the others... U heard it: Our man Ron would like us to help
him more often! 
I m thinking about how i could help u...mhh. i am really not good at
creating websites :(
maybe i can do something .. i ll think about it..
ok
Respect to Ron!

Stefan

<br>
Please point me out in which message I wrote this. I don&#x27;t understand. Which system do you refer to?<br>
<br>
I can easily do F2L, then CLL, then ELL, probably under 18 seconds with some practice.<br>
For CLL I would use COLL.<br>
For ELL I would use a lot of ELL, but I forgot the hardest cases.<br>
<br>
For F2L, ELL, CLL this would be harder.<br>
I think there are 84 cases for CLL then! This is what Andy Camann had learned last year. He did this for the last step of the interesting system of Ryan Heise.<br>
<br>
Or are you talking about first layer, then CLL, then last 8 edges? That would be like the Waterman system. Without practice it takes ages to solve the last 8 edges! The first two remaining edges are an easy step of the Waterman system, but the last two final layer edges are a lot of algorithms.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

That is too much honor! Luckily we have a lot of people in our community who either publicly or on the background help organizing events.

But yeah, we need help. A few weeks ago I asked on this club if someone wanted to figure out all official records of the past. (1981/1982/2003/2004) Because now we only have the record history of 2005.
Noone offered helped. It is not that much work! We are all too busy.

The thing is that TALKING about regulations is a lot of fun.
WRITING the regulations is the hardest and not much appreciated work. There are so many opinions that you need to take into account. And these opinions are often black/white (preinspection or not, pops allowed or not, how to deal with penalties). And you cannot change too much, there must be some basic stabile principles.

Any help is still appreciated. You posting on this subject already helped, because today we found 1 more volunteer. :-)

Have fun,

Ron

  Hi Ron,

  My post wasnt ment to critisize you, far away. I really enjoyed EM2004
  for example. It must have been lots of work and yes indeed.. i didnt
  manage to thank u expressly. And what did in fact surprised me the
  most...It was free! (Or did i miss something?) I dont want to get u
  out of ur job u are obviusly doing like nobody else of us could.
  Respect and thanks!
  The idea of the democracy isn&#x27;t just about elections its also about to
  approve ur work. U would then know that we are very proud of u!
  Another point is: If the rules are base on the majorities will by a 
  transparent system nobody can really complain anymore. (Well we know
  there always will be a few). And btw i could imagine a WCA Fee. So
  donating WCA cubers will get registered and will have their voice in
  an election or something like that. U dont have to pay all the
  expenses from ur own pocket! I d like to spent some money into it! 
  And to all the others... U heard it: Our man Ron would like us to help
  him more often! 
  I m thinking about how i could help u...mhh. i am really not good at
  creating websites :(
  maybe i can do something .. i ll think about it..
  ok
  Respect to Ron!

  Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
There are a few people out there who have accused me or suggested that <br>
I write rules or influence regulations for the benefit of myself and my <br>
friends.  I would like to assure the speedcubing community that this is <br>
not the case and that I write rules and regulations in an effort to <br>
uphold the principles of speedcubing, ensure fairness throughout <br>
Rubik&#x27;s Cube competitions, and also provide a logical systematic <br>
approach to tournaments.<br>
<br>
For every regulation that a member of the community may disagree, there <br>
is easily another person who agrees.  It is simple; people have <br>
different opinions and no one will ever fully agree.  If there are <br>
disagreements, I am always willing to listen to logical and well <br>
supported evidence supporting the new suggestion.  However, simply the <br>
reason that a few people do not agree with something should not be <br>
grounds for accusing or questioning my personal and moral integrity.<br>
<br>
I particularly feel regret that some of you feel this way.  However, I <br>
also feel that one has little right to accuse me of such acts if they <br>
have never been to any of the tournaments I have run.  Of my friends at <br>
Caltech, only one of them is really a speedcuber in contention of any <br>
records or prizes.  My other friends assist me with the tournament and <br>
have little desire to compete and are, at no offense to them, way too <br>
slow to even make it to the second round.  I personally refrain from <br>
competing in the 3x3x3 speed solve competition because I try to focus <br>
my energy on running a fair tournament.<br>
<br>
There are many things I could have done to influence the results of <br>
this tournament; most notably, I could easily release tournament <br>
scrambles to my friends before the tournament.  I could have easily <br>
looked and practiced scrambles for the Horace Mann tournament.  I <br>
assure you, if anyone approaches me and asks me to solve a Rubik&#x27;s <br>
Cube, I will be able to reproduce my tournament results.  I am indeed a <br>
sub-18 cuber, Macky can average sub-15, and Leyan did indeed perform a <br>
2:41.54 blindfolded solve in adherence to the spirit of all aspects of <br>
the sport of speedcubing and blindfold solving.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I hope the community will reconsider their accusations and I <br>
continue to work hard and provide the United States with quality events <br>
and Rubik&#x27;s Cube competitions that respect and hold dear the ultimate <br>
ideals of fair play.  If you have any doubts, I encourage you to <br>
contact any member of the community who has attended any of my <br>
tournaments.  I have met many competitors just for a few moments and <br>
have no ties or allegiance to most of them.  I also encourage all to <br>
attend the tournaments that I run and if any procedures or regulations <br>
suggest any inkling of self-thought, I encourage you to raise the <br>
concern with me and the public community.<br>
<br>
I have done my best to present the world with an honest and open <br>
competition front for the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  After this year, I will <br>
hopefully go off for further academic study in astrophysics and if is <br>
the wishes of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube community, I am more than willing to <br>
leave this all behind.<br>

try to interpret things like u want to...be some more forgiving :)<br>
<br>
Another point is obvious: We cubers have nearly no clue what it means<br>
to organize the Wca and tournaments and what u guys are working on<br>
right now.<br>
nuff said. <br>
we are pulling the same string so why argue that hard?<br>

<br>
I am only a couple of steps away from confirming this event.  Once <br>
everything is confirmed and reserved, we will make the proper <br>
announcements on speedcubing.com and everything.  Again, it would be <br>
best if tournament discussion were in the Caltech groups so we don&#x27;t <br>
destroy the INBOXes of hundreds of people around the world.  Honestly <br>
though, I think it gives Leyan a break from looking at magnetic <br>
influences on squids.  Actually.... SQUID.<br>
<br>
Date:  Saturday, September 17, 2005<br>
Time:  10:00 AM to 5:00 PM<br>
<br>
Location:  Crystal Springs Uplands School<br>
400 Uplands Drive<br>
Hillsborough, California 94010<br>
<br>
http://www.csus.com/<br>
<br>
We will do 3x3x3 speed sovling, of course, and any other events that <br>
people would like to compete in.  I would like to compete in the 3x3x3 <br>
blindfold solve.  As a side event, it has been suggested that we do a <br>
cube-athon.  A cube-athon would entail solving a 2-cube, 3-cube, <br>
4-cube, and 5-cube.  Each time would then be compared to the world <br>
record like they do in the decathlon and that&#x27;s how we would decide the <br>
winner.  The event results would be listed in the results, but will not <br>
appear in the WCA official records.<br>
<br>
Also for this tournament, pre-registration will be required.  The <br>
school requests that I limit the number of competitors to 25.  I doubt <br>
that the tournament will get 25 people, but I really need to know in <br>
case too many people decide to come—in which case, I would beg to the <br>
facility officials for the allowance of more competitors.<br>
<br>
So stay tuned to the Caltech yahoo groups as all future announcements <br>
for this tournament will be in there.<br>

In the case of a pop the blinfold cubist could be allowed one edge
flipped, or two edges swapped, or two corners swapped. To allow for
putting the cube back together wrong.

   How about using both the old and the new &quot;official&quot; color schemes?

I want to thank you for your efforts. 
Im addition I appreciate that you went out of your way to allow me
time for no inspection solves.
Your tournaments have been fair and fun and you deserve a lot of
credit. Forget the naysayers.

I wasn&#x27;t here for much of the weekend and was about to ask you how
much of the sky is covered by a cube held at arm&#x27;s length, and then I
see that some people don&#x27;t know that the way to balance a shortage is
to increase in the shortfall areas...

I am a little ticked off that some people are giving you a hard time.
They need to sit down somewhere and listen to a few thousand words per
second until what they use for thinking shuts down. Hopefully their
systems will reset. :P

Adjustable blindfolds are sold in travel stores for people who need
dark for sleeping on planes.

David J

          <div class="email-content">In Sweden, I have been involved in organising three tournaments, and <br>
we have the upcoming Swedish Championships in September. Before each <br>
of the tournaments, I have been in contact with both Ron and Tyson <br>
and their support and help have been great. Thank you! We have also <br>
shared views about rules and how to conduct tournaments. <br>
<br>
I see no reason to limit the amount of tournaments at present. I <br>
think that we should instead be inspired and encouraged by Tyson and <br>
all his tournaments and start to arrange them at more places. <br>
Certainly, I have been inspired.<br>
<br>
One great thing of organising a tournament is that the organisers <br>
can decide upon the rules themselves. Thus, at our first tournament, <br>
the Swedish Cube Day 2004, we ranked people by the median value <br>
instead of the average of five / mean of three. Furthermore, we <br>
have, with great success, had a 3x3x3 speedcubing event without <br>
preinspection. Such events will not at present be official, but I <br>
find it proper to experiment with alternative events in tournaments <br>
together with the official ones. Thus, I suggest that future <br>
organisers experiment with the format (and in particular try the no-<br>
preinspection event  my favourite!). BUT, please discuss it with <br>
WCA in advance.<br>
<br>
In addition to experiments, I also suggest that future organisers <br>
try to make some events of tournaments official since one striving <br>
force in cubing is to get into the official ranking lists. The issue <br>
of ranking lists also makes me suggest that all rounds in <br>
tournaments ought have the same format (for instance, &quot;average of <br>
five&quot; in 3x3x3 speedcubing) so all competitors can be listed in all <br>
ranking list regardless of their performance.<br>
<br>
Organising tournaments are fun. Do as Ron uses to say &quot;Have fun&quot;!<br>

Try the new 25th anniversary cube, it has arched centers. Or the black 
DIY kits from rubiks.com. That has gotten rid of all my popping issues.

But just to shead some light on it, they call it the Pop Resort and 
not the Eighties Resort is because different parts of the building 
depict different decades, it&#x27;s not just the 80&#x27;s.

Well there was that time he ignored my comment that it couldn&#x27;t

(Yes, if you put in the solved state, it will return the sequence U U&#x27;

don&#x27;t take crap from anyone. everyone knows how hard you work and none
of us want you to leave. we all appreciate your efforts to spread the
cube and no one can deny that you are one of the main reasons that
cubing is how it is today. keep up all the good work :)

and btw, astrophysics is cool :)

I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s really answered your question...

The cubies are unsymmetrical inside (have a look), so you can verify by 
touch the orientation of one that&#x27;s popped out.  ;)

In fact, if you check the &quot;Optimal&quot; box and keep clicking the green 
arrow, Cube Explorer will calculate the shortest non-trivial 
identities (the &quot;do-nothing&quot; sequences).  I rather like that feature 
and use it in my own puzzle-solving programs; i.e., the search always 
starts at depth 1 rather than at depth 0.

On the (possible) real &quot;bugs&quot;... I have also noticed anomalies in the 
timings, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  However, when running under 
Windows XP I find that clearing the main window (even when there is 
only one cube) can sometimes be very slow -- from a few seconds to 
several minutes on a 1.7GHz machine with 512MB RAM.  During all this 
time, C.E. is using 97-99% cpu whilst apparently doing nothing.  The 
hard disk is not churning (there is plenty of memory free).

Does anyone else have this problem with the program?  If so, can you 
find any pattern in the behaviour?  I can&#x27;t. :(
(H. Kociemba isn&#x27;t using XP, so has not been able to investigate.)

work. There are so many opinions that you need to take into account. <br>
<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s a beautiful point.<br>
<br>
Even though I don&#x27;t fully agree on some of the rules and regulations, <br>
I don&#x27;t whine about it. It just piles up work for one or two people. <br>
People need to take action if you feel strongly enough, and if you <br>

Democracy is going to take time; I&#x27;m satisified with what&#x27;s been going <br>

Astrophysics is cool, and low temperature physics even more so.  Cubing 
has NEVER been cool.  Much too sweaty.

Ok we as a community frown upon this, there were lots and lots of

I cube quite a lot on public transport but have had that comment only 
once.  Luckily I remembered one of Macky&#x27;s friendlier ripostes.

Usually there&#x27;s just a bit of eye-rolling, but once someone started 
throwing loose change at me.  Not quite enough to make it worth 
putting up with, though.

BULL :) (or should that be BUL2?) It&#x27;s not difficult if we allow M,S, 
and especially E.

I have the greatest respect for both of you.  Someone wrote on here recently

High pop-denisty? Is that good for a cube tournament (cf. the pop

<br>
Thanks for sharing. :-) :-(<br>
<br>
Now back to cubing! Let us not waste more energy on negative things!<br>
<br>
If you have spare energy then use it in a positive way.<br>
Some ideas:<br>
= come with good suggestions for regulations. Preferrably in regulation<br>
style. Try http://www.worldcubeassocation.org/forum<br>
<br>
= help me with the WCA website<br>
<br>
= help us with the legal stuff of establishing WCA<br>
<br>
= create the history of world puzzle records before 2005<br>
<br>
= help other cubers by making a great website with your ideas and systems<br>
<br>
= create the best tournament Excel file that people can think of (generate<br>
all sheets for all events with all information of all competitors, and<br>
with all correct calculations)<br>
<br>
= start organizing a local cube event<br>
<br>
= write a good scientific article that will draw LOTS of attention to our<br>
fun hobby<br>
<br>
= et cetera, there is so much to do in Cubeland!<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think anyone who is wiling to organize a tournament is to be given a lot
of respect. If these people who are complaining were to try and organize a
tourney themselves would see that it is not an easy task. I am still trying
to get a tournament going for Canada and I know how hard it is. I am having
trouble just getting a place to hold it.

So well done Tyson, and anyone else who has managed to get a tournament
going.

          <div class="email-content">  Hi Ron,<br>
 That is, what I have found. (Maybe you wrote about 26s earlier).<br>
  OK, step 1 You should do in 6s. Step 2 (CLL?) You should do in 2s. Step 5 is skipped, as you flip the pieces in the middle slice in steps 3 and 4.<br>
  In short, I think You (with practising) could do the cube in 15s with this system. <br>
  R<br>
    Hi friendz,<br>
<br>
    Just to let you know that I started solving corners first a week <br>
    after the WC 2003.<br>
    My expectation is that I cannot beat my CFOP (cross/F2L/OLL/PLL) <br>
    record with it. I do think that it will give me more experience to <br>
    improve my times for more advanced CFOP systems.<br>
<br>
    The corners first system I currently use is:<br>
    1) first layer (systematically)<br>
    2) corners of last layer (algorithms)<br>
    3) two edges of last layer (algorithms)<br>
    4) last two edges of last layer (algorithms)<br>
    5) orient middle layer edges (algorithms)<br>
    6) permute middle layer edges (algorithms)<br>
<br>
    This is basically the Waterman system without combining step 4 and 5.<br>
    For combining these steps you need to learn table 3 and 4 of the <br>
    Waterman system. These are tough ones! Slowly I am working my way <br>
    through the tables, but it will take me some more time.<br>
<br>
    At the moment, exactly one month after starting corners first, my <br>
    normal averages are sub 24 seconds, with a best of 23.1 seconds:<br>
    20 (29) 25 24 22 20 20 26 23 23 23 (19).<br>
    I am finally getting used to keeping the last layer on the right and <br>
    finishing off the cube using only R, U and M moves.<br>
    I am surprised that using this system I only take on average 10 <br>
    slice moves per cube.<br>
<br>
    Anyway: corners first is fun!<br>
<br>
    Have fun,<br>

How many of you would come to a tournament (assuming it doesn&#x27;t <br>
conflict with another US tournamnet or Dutch Cube Day and is on a <br>
weekend during the academic year), held in Ann Arbor Michigan?, which <br>
is 40 minutes west of Detroit for those who don&#x27;t know.<br>
<br>
venue: The University of Michigan<br>
room: decided soon, trying to reserve<br>
funding: University of Michigan, possibly rubiks.com, possibly <br>
cubesmith.com, entry fee<br>
<br>
Thus instead of called &quot;Midwest Tournament&quot; it will be called <br>
the &quot;First [Annual] University of Michigan Cube Off.&quot;<br>
<br>
And oh yes, there will be an entry fee attached. I can&#x27;t be going <br>
broke over this :). I need a least 20 entries, early registration <br>
appriciated (once I properly arrange enough to publicize the date).<br>

hey,

my dad was just on a business trip in Europe, and he knows how I like
puzzles, so he brought back a newspaper with a new puzzle in it called
Sudoku.  apparently it&#x27;s become really really popular in Japan, and
they publish it in the newspaper every week with the crossword.  and

Today, etc....
anyway, it&#x27;s a very interesting puzzle.  it&#x27;s a square that&#x27;s divided

filled with random numbers, and you have to fill in the rest of them
so that each row, column, and separate 3x3 square has the numbers 1-9
in it.

I suppose it is always dependent on the actual day, but I would come 
barring any unforeseen circumstance.  I guess I shouldn&#x27;t speak for 
anyone else, but I know another cuber in my general vicinity that 
would want to go as well.

I would do my best to be there.  My girlfriend&#x27;s mother and stepfather
live in South Lyon, which I believe is not too far from Ann Arbor.  So
depending on the date, I could plan a trip up there and then go down
to the tournament.

So consider that a half yes from me, considering that my schedule
during the school year might prohibit my travels, but I will do my
best to come.

          <div class="email-content">I have two Rubik&#x27;s Deluxe Game Cubes and one Deluxe Cube. They are 
both the same as far as I know, except for th e fact that one has 
peg holes in it to (so you can play a few games that they teach you 
to play). The peg holes are used to put pegs in them (duh -_-X). The 
feel of both cubes are the same (because everything but the tiles 
are different). As speedcubers, the pro and con of the Game Cube is 
that it is easier to grip (the holes catch onto your fingers), but 
all the holes takes a while to get used to. Oh yeah, and to answer 
Bryan&#x27;s question, no it is not a piece of crap. It&#x27;s hell good =], 
but heavier and feels bigger. Hope that helps~

   I was never complaining.  Granted my first question
was poorly thought out and worded which is why I
reworded it the second time around.  I just simply
wanted to know if there was a limit - that is all.  If
somewhere wants to host 50+ tournaments in a year -
good for them.  More power to them and the energy they
have to implement those tournaments.

    This is exactly why I asked the question that I
did.  We have the interest and the ability to do so
here and do so probably as often as the people in CA. 
That is why I wanted to know if there was a limit

They are usually just little riddles - with answers like SUM, BUD,

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,<br>
  With the Dallas tourney approaching quickly and me with no<br>
experience at a stackmat I decided to do something about it so I<br>
wouldn&#x27;t be caught totally unawares.  A quick look at the bank account<br>
said &quot;You&#x27;re buying a stackmat?  Riiiiiiiiiiight.&quot;  And a quick look<br>
at the twistypuzzles forum gave me a kick in the rear to attempt to<br>
make my own.<br>
<br>
So after 1 night of slamming my head against a desk in desperation,<br>
and one afternoon of much of the same I have my finished product.  It<br>
is ugly as all hell and doesn&#x27;t function *exactly* like a stackmat,<br>
but at least I&#x27;ll have a bit of the feel down.  The best part is it<br>
only cost me $5 for a stopwatch and about $3 in parts I had lying<br>
around the house.<br>
<br>
The touch pads are sensitive enough to one person touch one, another<br>
person touch the other and then any contact between the two people<br>
will start the time (makes me think of the team solving vid I saw<br>
earlier, very cool btw).<br>
<br>
The only thing I&#x27;d like to do to it at this point is make it so that<br>
the timer starts on release instead of on contact.  As it is now, the<br>
start and stop happen immediately upon touching the pads.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Just catching up on the last few days of posts and wow there were a<br>
lot!! (haven&#x27;t finished reading them all yet!)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I want to add a few of my own thoughts about the frequency of<br>
California-based comps...<br>
<br>
I think it&#x27;s fantastic that Tyson and others have put in so much time<br>
and effort to organise so many comps. I&#x27;m constantly impressed with<br>
how Tyson manages to do so much for the speedcubing community and<br>
still (I assume??) get through all his non-cubing stuff (astronomy,<br>
violin and whatever else he does).<br>
<br>
It doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest that there are more official<br>
competitions in and around California than in other places. I would be<br>
sad to see this limited by anything other than Tyson&#x27;s availability,<br>
even if I can&#x27;t ever compete at any Caltech comps. Personally, I think<br>
it&#x27;s great to see lots of official competitions happening and I don&#x27;t<br>
really care where they are or if I can attend. More competitions means<br>
more publicity for speedcubing!<br>
<br>
The fact that Tyson (and others) organise comps voluntarily means that<br>
we should all be thankful for their hard work. I know I wouldn&#x27;t be<br>
able to commit the time and effort to organise a comp myself, and so<br>
if not for the volunteers then I&#x27;d never have the opportunity to<br>
compete in anything anywhere.<br>
<br>
If organising competitions was *paid* work and the organisors chose to<br>
always focus the comps in the same city/state, then yes, there<br>
probably would be grounds for complaining, but as long as it&#x27;s unpaid<br>
voluntary work then I&#x27;m just happy that there are competitions<br>
happening, wherever they might be!<br>
<br>
BTW, if you think you have a long way to travel to competitions... I&#x27;m<br>
Australian and I competed at the World Champs in Toronto. According to<br>
an online distance tool I just googled, that&#x27;s 15815kms (9828 miles)<br>
away. I also went to the US Nationals (12334kms/7665 miles away). So<br>
if you think the comps are too far away, think about all the people in<br>
the southern hemisphere. I don&#x27;t think there has ever been a single<br>
official competition south of the equator!<br>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Pseudo-stackmat<br>
<br>
<br>
  Hey guys,<br>
    With the Dallas tourney approaching quickly and me with no<br>
  experience at a stackmat I decided to do something about it so I<br>
  wouldn&#x27;t be caught totally unawares.  A quick look at the bank account<br>
  said &quot;You&#x27;re buying a stackmat?  Riiiiiiiiiiight.&quot;  And a quick look<br>
  at the twistypuzzles forum gave me a kick in the rear to attempt to<br>
  make my own.<br>
<br>
  So after 1 night of slamming my head against a desk in desperation,<br>
  and one afternoon of much of the same I have my finished product.  It<br>
  is ugly as all hell and doesn&#x27;t function *exactly* like a stackmat,<br>
  but at least I&#x27;ll have a bit of the feel down.  The best part is it<br>
  only cost me $5 for a stopwatch and about $3 in parts I had lying<br>
  around the house.<br>
<br>
  The touch pads are sensitive enough to one person touch one, another<br>
  person touch the other and then any contact between the two people<br>
  will start the time (makes me think of the team solving vid I saw<br>
  earlier, very cool btw).<br>
<br>
  The only thing I&#x27;d like to do to it at this point is make it so that<br>
  the timer starts on release instead of on contact.  As it is now, the<br>
  start and stop happen immediately upon touching the pads.<br>
<br>
  Without further ado, here is the vid of the ugly thing in action!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ya a couple nights ago, me and DanH was discussing this as well.

I have a rediculous standard deviation I though... these days I get 
times over 30s occasioanlly and my fast times are even faster, I get 
13s solves as well.

So according to DanH (and i&quot;m now inclined to agree), one *should* 
target a 10% SD.

This is a &quot;rule of thumb&quot; similar to say... in tennis how your 
supposed to be at 80% on your first serve. (Just did 100 serves 
tonight btw, and then spent 20 minutes drenched in the rain, probably 
wake up with a cold....)

Thus it comes to reason that if you are overly consistant, to risk 
more for the fast times, and to try to be more consistant (i.e. 
mistakes in terms of recognition, wrong alg execution, and lock-ups) 
by going a little be slower at first and then build up speed in a 
reasonable manner.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; If organising competitions was *paid* work and the organisors chose <br>
to<br>
&gt; always focus the comps in the same city/state, then yes, there<br>
&gt; probably would be grounds for complaining, but as long as it&#x27;s unpaid<br>
&gt; voluntary work then I&#x27;m just happy that there are competitions<br>
&gt; happening, wherever they might be!<br>
<br>
<br>
Excellent point!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So<br>
&gt; if you think the comps are too far away, think about all the people <br>
in<br>
&gt; the southern hemisphere. I don&#x27;t think there has ever been a single<br>
&gt; official competition south of the equator!<br>
<br>
<br>
Wait..., I thought you were the only competitor from the southern <br>
hemisphere :).<br>

recent years, but only because the comps are so far away! :) There are
definitely other cubers in Oz! If there was a comp in Sydney or
Melbourne then I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;d discover other cubers. Maybe even some
New Zealand cubers?? Never met or heard of any cubers from New Zealand.

stuckin the basement and try to solve a cube they stumble across:

Lisa: OK start with diagonal colors.
Homer: Use your main finger on the yellow side, and your other finger
on the other side, and turn it!
Marge: My main finger?

Bart: Spin the middle side topwise-topwise!

already (or if you don&#x27;t care to see the solution).

Here are some screen shots for level 36.  I found the cheat solution
by accident (the block in question can actually be dragged completely
off the board, so the first time I tried to move it, it went at an odd
angle - so that&#x27;s how I found out).

I thought the puzzle was impossible and this was their clever trick to
make you have to realize which block made it impossible, but there is
a regular solution, I&#x27;ve included that screenshot too.

          <div class="email-content">Great job with the ability to search!  I really like that database.  A
couple of things I was thinking about:

1) You might want to ask Ian Winokur before you start ripping videos
from the DVD he made.  He and Raul Garcia put a lot of time into
making that look extraordinary, and I&#x27;d hate to see someone not buy
the DVD since they could just download all the videos.  However, he
might say that its completely fine to do so, but I think you should
get his permission.

2) I think it would be nice to have a naming convention for the
videos.  For instance, the names I use for the videos I download is
&quot;PuzzleType Time NameOfPerson.extension&quot;.  So for instance, I have
&quot;3x3x3 12&#x27;11 Shotaro &#x27;Macky&#x27; Makisumi.wmv&quot;.  This way, when I have all
the videos in my one folder, all the puzzles are grouped together,
then listed in order of time.  It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but it would be
nice.

Thanks again for the site, I look forward to utilizing it!

Absolutely. I would hate to undermine all their hard work. I also<br>
encourage anyone who sees their videos on my site and doesn&#x27;t want<br>
them there, let me know!! I just uploaded all the videos that I had<br>

Nice idea. I thought about that too, but I worry about file names<br>
getting too large. I have a couple ghetto computers in my house that<br>
don&#x27;t like files with names larger than 8 (or so) characters. The<br>
numbering system I use is also automated so it makes it a little<br>
easier for me to add more videos to the database. I&#x27;m working on<br>
trying to do something like that though.<br>

          <div class="email-content">basically, standard deviation is how far one deviates on average from
their average.

so like nascarjon2001 averages 15-16 with a std dev of .5-1.5, which
means that on average, he is .5-1.5 above or below 15-16.

i hope that makes sense

Having to draw the outlines of fingers makes 5 fingers look awkward
and as if there is too many. In anime they usually have five fingers
though.

They were talking about theories of why they would have evolved from
such a primitive state to having only 4 fingers :-D

Always thought that was a good one ;-)

&gt; don&#x27;t want me hosting.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; 2) I think it would be nice to have a naming convention for the<br>
&gt; &gt; videos.  For instance, the names I use for the videos I download is<br>
&gt; &gt; &quot;PuzzleType Time NameOfPerson.extension&quot;.  So for instance, I have<br>
&gt; &gt; &quot;3x3x3 12&#x27;11 Shotaro &#x27;Macky&#x27; Makisumi.wmv&quot;.  This way, when I  <br>
&gt; have all<br>
&gt; &gt; the videos in my one folder, all the puzzles are grouped together,<br>
&gt; &gt; then listed in order of time.  It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but it would be<br>
&gt; &gt; nice.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Nice idea. I thought about that too, but I worry about file names<br>
&gt; getting too large. I have a couple ghetto computers in my house that<br>
&gt; don&#x27;t like files with names larger than 8 (or so) characters. The<br>
&gt; numbering system I use is also automated so it makes it a little<br>
&gt; easier for me to add more videos to the database. I&#x27;m working on<br>
&gt; trying to do something like that though.<br>

I&#x27;m the unofficial Pyramorphix record holder, would you like to host a<br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow looks like it turns much better than my 5x5...

I can&#x27;t believe my eyes, how the heck is it even possible (from a 
mechanical pov)? Well I definately think that to be even more 
convincing the guy should of scrambled it up fully. Doing those 
turns and then undoing.... it doesn&#x27;t have the same impact. For all 
I know, he&#x27;s able to cheat the system, and have someting that looks 
like it works but doesn&#x27;t really and is somehow 
(internally) &quot;bandaged&quot; if you know what I mean...

Ummm, maybe the guy is rather slow at solving one and just didn&#x27;t 
want to jumble it up beyond a couple simple turns. I would have at 
least liked to see him put a checkerboard pattern on it.... oh wait, 
that&#x27;s right, even cubes don&#x27;t admit good checkerboards.

Ok, I want one. I want to take it apart and see how he does it... 
then again it might be too complicated and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to put 
it back together. Though I&#x27;m sure Ton is doing everything in his 
power to get in on this amazing collector&#x27;s item; and he&#x27;s not the 
kinda guy that&#x27;ll be too afraid to take it apart.

          <div class="email-content">Wow :D

It&#x27;s not fair to publish a video like that when im trying to finish my 
master theses by sept 1st :-( Now i&#x27;m getting desperate to lay my 
hands on a beauty like that ;-) It seems to turn quite nicely indeed. 
My guess is that it&#x27;s possible to solve it in less than 4 minutes at 
least. Maybe even sub 3 if turning is really smooth. Or would i not 
dare push it to it&#x27;s limits? Hmmm ... I hope it&#x27;s as light as it seems 
on the video. Also i hope it has no fragile pieces like the 4x4x4 and 
5x5x5 does. Oh well, we&#x27;ll see ... :D :D

Panayotis, are u reading this group? Will this beauty (or other even 
larger ones) go into mass production any time soon? And in that case 
would u have any idea what the price would be? Im willing to pay at 
least £50 for a puzzle like that. At least if the quality is good. Hmm 
okay Chris already asked those obvious questions :-P

Awesome video !!!

Cheers!

But plz, you (or someone, I&#x27;m busy with other stuff) do a volume

It reminds me, my last cubing video was over two years ago... really

Albany is about 2 1/2 hours away from me I believe (I live in North
Jersey, about 15 mins. from Manhattan).  It really depends on what my
plans look like, but I&#x27;m not one to typically turn down a cube
gathering. :P

          <div class="email-content">Due to the certainty of this tournament now that I have a few <br>
cofirmations from people that will be comming a rather long way to <br>
participate, I have decided that due this effort and financial <br>
concerns I can no longer attend the Dallas tournament.<br>
<br>
Sorry...<br>
<br>
Also I was trying to reserve a couple dorm rooms for poeple that would <br>
prefer that over hotel (better situated since there are no nearby <br>
hotels, and much more affordable). But then I realized, ops it&#x27;s not <br>
going to be summer anymore. So it looks like I&#x27;ll be looking around <br>
for a centralized hotel/motel for you guys. It has to be cheap and <br>
close by, though I can have my sister run a quick shuttle service <br>
between the hotel and competition building... as well as Airport and <br>
hotel.<br>
<br>
Today I was able to recruit one more volenteer <br>
(judges/scramblers/timers) for it (during an hr of intense soccer). <br>
And then another on AIM (the guy that approched me about building a <br>
cube robot a few months ago). The current progress on this is about 1 <br>
new person a day on average. Thus it&#x27;s starting come together on the <br>
informal side.... now for the legal side.<br>
<br>
Going into student organizations office to discuss the feisibility of <br>
it all is NOT something I loook forward to doing this week (was gonna <br>
be today, but a friend dropped by and we walked the mall for hrs).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On a lighter note, I beat Gridlock (lvl 31 took 3-4hrs, lvls 36 and 40 <br>
long too, all the rest flew through), and so decided to try some <br>
Sudoku, I htought it was rather hard and couldn&#x27;t do it at first, but <br>
then I red the rules :).<br>
<br>
Besides columns and rows there&#x27;s also the 3x3 regions... well I <br>
rapidly did an easy one. And then did one on &quot;insane/evil&quot; <br>
difficuilty, and am now temporarily severly addicted.<br>
<br>
I was even working on a &quot;speed-sudoku&quot; method :).<br>
<br>
One quote I find a bit disturbing though: &quot;The immense popularity of <br>
Sudoku in British newspapers and internationally has led to it being <br>
dubbed in the world media in 2005 variously as &quot;the Rubik&#x27;s cube of <br>

I am sure Bram is more than capable of helping, though if you need any 
additional help, feel free to contact me as well, Jon.  You will have

<br>
I have been cleaning my cubes today. I use silicone spray lube to make <br>
the puzzles turn faster, and this is easy to clean off. <br>
<br>
When I open up the cube, I have to clean this grey gunky stuff, looks <br>
like a mix of dust and lube, with a texture slightly more viscous than <br>
graphite.<br>
<br>
Trouble is, some parts are very hard to reach. This happens in 2 <br>
places: 1) Inside the edge pieces. The gunk is quite thick here, and <br>
on previous cleanings I think I&#x27;ve been a bit lazy and just rubbed the <br>
pieces a bit with a kitchen towel. Is it important to also remove the <br>
gunk inside the edge pieces? These areas, as far as I can see, don&#x27;t <br>
come into contact with anything else, but they might add extra weight <br>
to each piece or something, I dunno hehe<br>
<br>
2) Inbetween the centre piece of plastic, and the axles of each cube <br>
&quot;arm&quot;. I think it must be very important to remove this, because these <br>
two areas are rotating against each other all the time during a solve. <br>
It&#x27;s extremely fiddly to get in there, I need about 4 hands. I was <br>
just now going to take the whole centre-piece structure apart (a bit <br>
reluctant because I was worried that I might not find the correct <br>
spring tensions when I put it back together), and I found it was <br>
riveted together, so I can&#x27;t even de-construct it.<br>
<br>
Do you have any tips for cleaning in these areas? And cleaning the <br>
cube in general :)<br>

&gt;   Do you have any tips for cleaning in these areas? And cleaning the<br>

That video is actually pretty funny, thanks for bringing that to my 
attention. But it is in the &quot;laughing with you not at you&quot; kind of 
way.  

In regards to the strangepuzzle.com site, and the video section in 
particular, I wanted to throw out a suggestion or two. Of course I 
don&#x27;t know what database you are using, but is it possible for you 
to change your query to use something like _select * from [table] 
where FirstName like `%@FName%&#x27;_  and the same for the last name as 
well? That way if you put in &quot;Jeff&quot; you would get results 
for &quot;Jeffery&quot; (if there is even such a cuber).  Also, can you take 
off the restriction that you must put either a first or last name? 
It would be nice to just see every thing you have, as it is 
difficult to think of who you want to see, but if the list was just 
available it would be easier to decide.

But aside from my requests, it is an excellent idea, and the site 
looks very nice. Great work and thank you for putting in the time, 
money and effort.

-Dave

A couple questions:

1. Do the 2 and 3 cubes have different mechanisms than other 
more &quot;classic&quot; implementations?

2. If so, does the smoothness on the 6-cube imply that the lower-order 
cubes could rival other cubes already in production in terms of speed 
and/or smoothness?

3. When it says on the 7-cube for example that it has &quot;219 smaller 
pieces, of which 218  pieces are visible to the player&quot;, does that 
mean that it has a solid kernel?

Wasn&#x27;t planning on going that far, it was just planning on the day 
and looking for apartments for/with my friend in Albany. I&#x27;m not

I&#x27;ll ask my friend (who is driving) to consider the extra 2 hrs.

&gt; off the restriction that you must put either a first or last name? <br>
&gt; It would be nice to just see every thing you have, as it is <br>
&gt; difficult to think of who you want to see, but if the list was just <br>
&gt; available it would be easier to decide.<br>
<br>
Great ideas. The latter I just finished this afternoon. You can now<br>
browse all videos in a given puzzle catagory by selecting the puzzle<br>
type and pressing &#x27;search videos&#x27;. I&#x27;ll implement the regular<br>
expression evaluation later tonight, hopefully.<br>
<br>
&gt; But aside from my requests, it is an excellent idea, and the site <br>
&gt; looks very nice. Great work and thank you for putting in the time, <br>
&gt; money and effort.<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot. I spent a while working on the page and I&#x27;m very very<br>
happy that people are enjoying the service. You can thank me by<br>
sending in videos :)<br>
<br>
Have a nice day!<br>

Sorry, it&#x27;s the only one I had at the time. It&#x27;s also the best video

Well done! I like the new website.. It looks very
clean and neat :).
 
The only thing I don&#x27;t like is a 21.50s solve of me
on it :p. But I
added a new one.
 
Great job!

You&#x27;re pushing me to make a new video of myself. the one you have is 
too old (July 4, 2003 and is not volume leveled properly).

My style has changed significantly since then, and I now actively 
apply 2 to 3 times as mang algs. (Though the actual solve will be 
slower as my hands are not as fast as in the good old days.)

Too much to do to stay on the mark in this community. Work, work,

I might add other databases. I haven&#x27;t decided yet. The main purpose
of the site is the video database and that may be all I ever add. I
would never be able to provide a better alg/method page then what is
already available. If I could think of anything original to provide,
then I&#x27;ll add it.

It always scares the crap out of me too. I fix the volume on it later
today when I get home.

I changed the max size for first and last name to 30 characters. If
anyone has name longer than 60 characters, then they need to change
their name :)

Please submit your video now.

True indeed. I did need to update the database too, however. I don&#x27;t
know why I set it at 15. It now has a 30 character limit.

          <div class="email-content">Actually, they draw it that way because years ago, animators had to 
draw everything by hand and draw several pages. This often took 
several hours. So sometimes animators took shortcuts by only drawing 4 
fingers on characters, and drawing characters with less details.
Now they often use computers for animation, but they still keep the &quot;4 
finger tradition&quot;.

This is incorrect. There are some corner positions missing.  

I wonder what other errors lurk unseen. I didn&#x27;t bother to check the
others.

Or a 100 letter first name :). Why not set a maxlength? It&#x27;s only one
sql command to change a column to a new size. I think 30 for the first
name and 30 for the last name is fine. If someone comes along with a
longer name then that, then I&#x27;ll knock it up again :).

I only set limits because I like them. Why alot space when you don&#x27;t
need it. Seems like a waste to me :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gunnar,<br>
<br>
Yesterday I received a videocd of J. Bernett solving 3x3x3 and 5x5x5 blindfolded.<br>
It appeared that he was sometimes peeking during the solve.<br>
<br>
Therefore I removed his records. Now he needs to solve the cubes behind a barrier, so that he cannot peek. With his father watching carefully.<br>

That&#x27;s true. It seems to be in just about every newspaper here (Times (and Samurai), 
Independent (and 16x16), Guardian, Mail, Sun, TV guides, mobile phones (not that the 
latter is a newspaper) . Who knows, even the Sport - not a newspaper either, arguably - 
might have it (probably a 1x1 version, if they do)?

> Not too hard but quite addictive!

Some can be quite challenging: here&#x27;s a good site:

http://sudoku.sourceforge.net/

This one, from that page (Brain Of Britain section), is supposed to be quite hard (you can 
get a similar puzzle replacing the middle 4 with 7). It took longer than usual and I had to 
invent myself a new technique about halfway through:

 . 2 . * . . . * . . . 
 . . . * 6 . . * . . 3 
 . 7 4 * . 8 . * . . . 
********************** 
 . . . * . . 3 * . . 2 
 . 8 . * . 4 . * . 1 . 
 6 . . * 5 . . * . . . 
********************** 
 . . . * . 1 . * 7 8 . 
 5 . . * . . 9 * . . . 
 . . . * . . . * . 4 . 

It didn&#x27;t paste well above, but it is worth a shot.
It can all be done without trial-and-error, which is technically logical (being a finite 
puzzle) although the computer solver on the same site has to guess! - I guess it just 
doesn&#x27;t have enough methods. Have a go at it - you definitely don&#x27;t need anything 
extraordinary but it is tricky nonetheless.

On a related topic with all the exposure it has over here I was naturally drawn to think up a 
related problem - it will need some terminology which is effectively just formalizing 
Sudoku terms to get everything on the same level of understanding.
A clueset will be an assignment of clues to a subset of the squares (a function from some 
subset of n^2xn^2 to n, mathematically speaking).
Given 2 clusets f and g, if f is a subset of g, f is a subclueset of g and g is a superclueset 
of f.
f is row-feasible if it satisfies the row condition (the restriction of f to each row is 1 to 1 or 
injective).
Similarly we define column feasibility and box-feasibility relating to the other conditions 
and feasibility regarding all 3 conditions holding at once.
A clueset will be a solution if it is feasible and assigns clues to every square (has fulll 
domain n^2*n^2).
A clueset is consistent if it admits a solution superclueset. (NB Feasibility does not imply 
consistency.)
A clueset is inconsistent if it is not consistent.
A Sudoku puzzle is then a clueset which admits a unique solution superclueset.
A Sudoku puzzle such that no proper subclueset is a Sudoku puzzle would then be a good 
Sudoku puzzle (in the sense of not having superfluous clues).

So we define (two defiinitions at once):

a (good) Sudon&#x27;tku puzzle is an inconsistent clueset such that every proper clueset is 
consistent and such that every subclueset omitting just one clue is a (good) Sudoku 
puzzle.

So the questions are:
are there any Sudon&#x27;tku puzzles (and if so what are the restrictions on n - clearly n must 
be >1, but are there other restrictions).
are there any good Sudon&#x27;tku puzzles (ditto)?

Presumably it would be too hard to determine the answer for n=2 (by example if 
affirmative or an exhaustive search if negative, though a better argument would be 
preferable. Clearly we could start off by looking at all (good) Sudoku puzzles and then 
extending inconsistently by one clue and seeing if the result satisfied the conditions but 
perhaps there is a better way.

It&#x27;s not only about stickers. One face of each Studio Cube edge has a 
noticable dent. Some cubes have corners without caps and after a 
quarter turn you can easily feel the holes. The deluxe cube allows the 
same with edges. Different tensions can be used to determine cube 
orientation. New rubiks.com 3x3s have &quot;Rubik&#x27;s&quot; indentation on one of 
the center caps which can be felt through the sticker (the 4x4 has it 
on a corner I believe).

Could be exploited, e.g. if I know I need to flip UR and either FL or 
FR but don&#x27;t remember which one, then I could simply flip all three 
(one by popping).

Do you mean without trial-and-error at all, or just without 
trial-and-error-writing-down? I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I&#x27;d guess I&#x27;d 
do some trial-and-error in my head...

Did you at least find some good cubes there? I&#x27;ve had some nice finds 
at flea markets but not recently. Last autumn I found a black magic 
every week or so, four overall. Since then I&#x27;ve been at many more flea

Are you sure? Take out the U layer edges and corners and look at the 
four side centers. Do they touch the central spider? Usually there&#x27;s a 
little gap because the moving pieces push/pull the centers out.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Friends,<br>
<br>
<br>
Following recent events about BLD, I could not resist the<br>
temptation to introduce 2 ideas I had to perform BLD...<br>
... with eyes opened.<br>
<br>
IDEA 1 (can use it in comp.)<br>
You need 2 cubes C1 and C2, and 2 scrambling algs S1 and S2.<br>
The 2 cubes must have the same color schemes. Let&#x27;s say that<br>
C2 is the own cube of the competitor (lubed, etc.).<br>
Protocol :<br>
a. scramble C1 with S1<br>
b. scramble C2 with S2 followed by S1.<br>
c. give C1 to competitor for inspection and memorization<br>
d. take+hide C1 from competitor once memorization is done.<br>
e. give C2 to competitor.<br>
f. competitor now &quot;blindfoldsolves&quot; C2 with eyes opened as <br>
   if it were C1.<br>
g. take C2 from competitor<br>
h. apply inverse(S2) [the reverse of the sramble S2] to C2<br>
i. check if C2 is now solved.<br>
<br>
IDEA 2 (new category for rubik&#x27;s cube, another BLD with<br>
  eyes wide opened)<br>
A few weeks ago, I was thinking about a new category for <br>
solving rubiks&#x27;s cube. And I came up with this idea :<br>
a. Have the cube scrambled by a friend. <br>
b. The scrambled cube is called SC.<br>
c. try to :<br>
   - solve the cube first <br>
   - bring it back to the initial scrambled state SC<br>
     (you don&#x27;t know what the scrambling alg was in 1st place,<br>
      so it&#x27;s rather difficult ?).<br>
Well, I don&#x27;t know how topcubers would do this. Obviously, there<br>
are two solutions at least :<br>
Solution1 : speedsolve the cube remembering all moves, and apply<br>
  all those moves in reverse order to get back to initial state<br>
Solution2 : memorize initial state, speedsolve cube, and &quot;blindsolve&quot;<br>
  the cube in reverse order (easy with Stefan P.&#x27;s method).<br>
<br>
Well, I&#x27;ve tried this idea number 2 a couple of times ;-).<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoyed this,<br>

One way to do this would be to memorize the cycle structure of S1 (by 
inspecting C1, of course).  Mentally apply inverse of this to your C2 
to work out what the final state must be.  Solve to that final state.

It would still be a real challenge to do it that way -- maybe there&#x27;s 
an easier approach.

> IDEA 2 

Might be too easy? -- no BLD techniques needed apart from 
memorization of the required final state.

Hmm... you could get away with memorizing the position C1, since you 
can work out from that &quot;what must go to to where&quot; on the fly.  I still 
think it&#x27;s tough, though.

Hmm, you make it sound like it&#x27;s something hard?

As far as I understand it, for the competitor it&#x27;s *exactly* the same 
as normal blindsolving, just that he/she switches to a different cube 
between memorizing and solving.

The real difference is for the judge, he&#x27;ll need to scramble and 
descramble more. And it must all be checked very thoroughly using 
printouts showing the scrambled cubes, created by the computer. We 
must make absolutely sure that the judge doesn&#x27;t make a mistake, 
otherwise the competitor could do everything right and not get it 
accepted.

The advantage of the normal way is of course that it&#x27;s immediately 
obvious whether the competitor got it right, and it looks much more 
natural, especially to noncubers. But this new idea would make 
cheating much harder. I&#x27;d suggest though to not solve with eyes open 
but to still use blindfolds.

I like the idea. Francois, are you into cryptography? ;-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Yes.
You could also decide that S1=S2. I mean, you scramble C1 w/
S1, and C2 with S1^2 (S1 applied twice).
Then, when you &quot;blindsolve&quot; C2 after memorizing C1, you get...
... C1 :-). I guess it must be easy for the judge to check this ;),
he has got two cubes to compare.

Yes using blindfolds should be mandatory.
Cheating with that method would be... mmmm.... DIFFICULT ? :).
The main problem is that it would probably be less spectacular.

In order to make it spectacular, we could decide that S2
is a pretty pattern (In that case the final cube is not
&quot;random&quot;, but looks pretty).

Not really, but I agree we could nickname the cubes by Alice
and Bob ;-).

I think they could have different color schemes since the competitor 
doesn&#x27;t need to see C2 at all! Only C1 must have the color scheme that 
the competitor wants, and probably he&#x27;ll choose the same as C2...

Ok... as much as I like the idea, I must admit that for the sake of 
&quot;naturalness&quot; I&#x27;d rather do it the normal way and use full-face 
blindfolds or boards between head and cube in order to fight cheating. 
I think the only way to cheat and gain speed is to peek (or if a 
partner gives you solving commands through a hidden headphone or 
telepathy so you don&#x27;t need to memorize at all). Using little dirty 
tricks like feeling the orientations can make it easier, but I&#x27;m 
convinced not faster than someone who does it well without cheating.

General question: Do we really need to do more than we currently do 
against cheating, i.e. using blindfolds? Well, we usually blindsolve 
with the cube not straight in front of our eyes but much lower in a 
more comfortable position, so peeking isn&#x27;t all that impossible. 
Especially if someone raises the head, and I know I do that sometimes 
when I try hard to remember something. I don&#x27;t want it, but I do it. 
And the noncubers out there, including the media, might see the 
possibility of cheating. I&#x27;d like to prove better that I don&#x27;t cheat.

Cheers!
Stefan

I mean you don&#x27;t need, at any point to say: &quot;these are the choices I have at this point; I&#x27;ll 
pick one and see if it leads to a contradiction&quot; (and hence embark upon a line of 
investigation until either coming to a contradiction and therefore having one less choice at 
that point or else arriving at a solution but then having to check that going down the other 
paths didn&#x27;t lead to a solution too (i.e. that there was indeed one solution).

For instance, supposing you get to a point where say one square contains 1 or 3 but it&#x27;s 
not obvious where to go. I&#x27;m saying that you can figure it out logically without having to 
resort to a logical but hardly neat method (of guessing) of &quot;let&#x27;s try 1 and see where it 
goes&quot;. (The computer program on that site actually does use that as I recall. I think one of 
its steps is something like &quot;In cell (a,b) k leads to a contradction&quot; without further 
justification of this contradiction - and it also claims that t needs a guess to finish (in fact, 
it might even require 2 guesses but you don&#x27;t need any).

Here is a small modification to your protocol. You need 3 cubes now. 

 a. scramble both C2 and C3 with an arbitrary S2, check that they 
look the same, hide C3.
 b. scramble both C1 and already scrambled C2 with S1.
 c. give C1 to competitor for inspection and memorization
 d. take+hide C1 from competitor once memorization is done.
 e. give C2 to competitor.
 f. competitor now &quot;blindfoldsolves&quot; C2 with eyes opened as 
    if it were C1.
 g. compare C2 with C3, they should be scrambled identically. 
Everybody can see it after they are oriented the same way.
Anybody from audience can add few moves to S2, performing them on C2 
and C3 before start.  C3 can be covered with a porcelain cup on the 
table and revealed only after solving. 
I bet the competitor would beg for a blindfold. :-) I don&#x27;t see any 
space for cheating.

          <div class="email-content">I personally would like to keep faith in the blindfold solvers right 
now that they aren&#x27;t cheating.  We can examine stickers and cubes 
before the competition and everything.  The reason is that, really... 
to the public, they&#x27;re not going to &quot;get it&quot; if we do one of these 
procedures, as pure as they are, and furthermore, it&#x27;s a considerable 
more effort for the tournament organizers.

There is a certain beauty in opening your eyes to a solved cube that 
first time.  This beauty is seen by the audience as they&#x27;re all new.  
They won&#x27;t appreciate the art of blindfolding otherwise...

But we&#x27;ll see.  As of now, I have faith in all of the blindfold 
competitors and as a board member, the WCA takes into may 
considerations of assuring a fair competition.

          <div class="email-content">This suggestion and the orginal by François are absolutely brillient!

I had always suspected (gut feeling) that there was something we 
could do about ruling out any possiblity of cheating, and it seems 
now there is.

Also, this way for the actual executioning of the solve, the cuber 
can simply use his/her own prefered cube now without any chance of 
cheating.

It&#x27;s not that I have no faith in my fellow cuber. For [competitive] 
cubing (in all its splendorous forms) to have a future, we ought to 
strive for precautions that aim for fairness across the board.

I was very excited and satisified when I read the inital concept. I 
actually have practiced your &quot;Idea #2&quot; before in front of people. 
The students on this campus are pretty creative... I give them a 
cube to mix up for me to solve, and instead they lay it on the table 
and tell me to make a second cube look like that.

Fun stuff, not sure it has any place in official competition [yet] 
though. Given some extra time, stuff like this (I think) would make 
for great stress-relieving pre/post competition unoffical events.

In some of the gatherings I&#x27;ve been to there have been competitions 
to see who can (correctly/solvablely) assemble their cube the 
fastest. Heck, it might make the bloopers section of the upcomming 
documentary that that one dude is making (Munro?).

Though I am inclined to agree wiht Tyson that these precausions are 
not yet needed, and would in fact hinder the audience 
understanding/enjoyment (or require lengthy explanation). But good 
to know that it is there for when we do need it (and we will...).

          <div class="email-content">Thanks a bunch, Per.  These algs, along with r2 u2 r2 u2 and r&#x27; d r U2 r&#x27; d&#x27; r (U2) are all that I use to fix centers.  They work great, but I think I need to find some moves that cycle both 2x1 center blocks on 3 faces witthin a slice and some that cycle single center pieces on 3 faces within a slice.  Here&#x27;s the method I&#x27;ve been practicing with the past few days, and it&#x27;s paying off nicely.  A little while ago, I managed a few times under 2 minutes with it and a 2:26 average.  That seems pretty good to me, considering my best times with my centers first method were around 2:30 when I practiced it all the time...<br>
<br>
Anyhow, it&#x27;s sort of a Roux themed approach to edges first 4x4ing:<br>
<br>
1)  L and R centers, generally on red and orange<br>
2)  LD and RD edge pairs (orange/red and white)<br>
3)  LF, RF, LB, and RB edge pairs, along with matching D layer corners in corner/edge pair fashion, using M slice to pair up edges<br>
4)  U layer corners<br>
5)  any two edge pairs remaining<br>
6)  pair up remaining 4 edge pairs and fix single pair flipped<br>
7)  orient remaining edges, using Roux method moves<br>
8)  place UL and UR edge pairs<br>
9)  adjust M slice, and/or apply U2 move, so that at least one edge pair in M slice is correctly positioned<br>
10) place rest of M pairs, fixing 2 swapped edge pairs parity if necessary<br>
11) use center algs, courtesy of Per, to fix centers<br>
<br>
The only problem I have is that it&#x27;s difficult to tell whether or not a single edge pair is flipped.  It&#x27;s easy to fix once you know, but finding out takes forever.  It&#x27;s faster for me, on average, to just not look and pair up edges however I find them, then fix them if I see they need it.  It seems that to recognize it, I have to count the single edge pieces that need flipped in pairs, then count how many rU2r&#x27; or l&#x27;U2l cycles it will take to fix them all.  Both of those algs flip a single pair of edges.  I understand that if the number of pairs to be flipped is odd and the number of pairs that will flip is even, or vice versa, a single r or l in either direction is all that is needed, but I would like to know if there is an easier way to see this.<br>
<br>
After only a few days&#x27; practice, I&#x27;ve managed to cut my average down to under 2:30, and I think I can probably take it quite a bit farther, without adding any more algorithms.  The key is constant motion, as in 3x3ing, but it&#x27;s hard to recognize that parity error.  I&#x27;m sure my averages would drop significantly if I didn&#x27;t waste so much time every other solve pairing up edges only to get them all done, see I need to do an r, and have to fix them all over again.  That&#x27;s at least ten seconds I&#x27;m wasting on those solves.  I would stop and count the edges and figure it out, but for the cases I don&#x27;t wind up having to go back and fix, my solves don&#x27;t have any extra count time, so they&#x27;re that much faster.<br>
<br>
Any more helpful advice would be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Happy big cubing.<br>

  Hmm ...<br>
<br>
  Which 2 edges are u swapping and calling &quot;parity&quot; ?<br>
<br>
  And for the centers have u considered this one :<br>
<br>
  (lr&#x27;)d2(l&#x27;r)U&#x27;(lr&#x27;)d2(l&#x27;r)U<br>
<br>
  It looks longish but it&#x27;s actually ony 8 moves counted with the <br>
  Hardwick metric ;-) And besides u can sorta fingertrick at least the <br>
  (l&#x27;r) &quot;slice move&quot; :-)<br>
<br>
  Alrite my idea for swapping 2 edges easily is as follows. Turn an <br>
  inner slice layer a quarter turn. Then cycle 3 edges on this layer <br>
  so that u get 2 swapped edges. It messes with edges for sure. U <br>
  might want to use Chris algorithm : R2 (u&#x27;R2)*5 instead of a simple <br>
  u turn. Now u for sure know how to swap any 2 edges easily. U can <br>
  use this idea only if u do centers last, or else somehow &quot;absorb&quot; <br>
  the side effect on the centers.<br>
<br>
  Cheers!<br>

  Also have a look at  : (lr&#x27;)d2(l&#x27;r)U&#x27;D&#x27;(lr&#x27;)d2(l&#x27;r)UD<br>
  And alrite also this : r&#x27;(ud&#x27;)rU2r&#x27;(u&#x27;d)rU2<br>
<br>
  U want more rabbits? <br>

  There are quite a few edge-rabbits too. Most simply involve cycling <br>

I certainly would :-) Watching a cube that I&#x27;m not gonna solve would 
only confuse me. And I&#x27;d want it for naturalness anyway.

If you&#x27;re allowed to look at the cube you can do some checks 
before/after every &quot;step&quot; to make sure you got the step right, 
particularly the setup moves, and particularly for orientation. You 
can even do it without looking, feeling pieces instead, but I think it 
would not be worth the time unless otherwise you&#x27;re not able to do it 
at all.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Mike!

Finding algs that do u what u went is no problem at all. U already 
know algs i presume that have the desired effect. But the cubies are 
not all within the same layer. All u need is some setup moves. I 
must admit that the setup for 2x1 blocks 3-cycle within a single 
layer will be somewhat lengthy. I&#x27;m sure u can work it out urself if 
u understand how setup moves work: take a such alg thet u know where 
the blocks are not confined to a single layer. Now find moves that 
put 3 2x1 blocks from same layer into those positions that are 
cycled by the alg u know. Those will be ur setup moves. Now at the 
end after the setup and the known alg u must reverse the setup moves 
and u are done. If u really get stuck with this send me an email :-)

By the way, Ron used ACube to find another useful center alg for 
4x4x4. One that interchanges 3 centers on opposite faces. Actually 3 
on each of the opposite faces. U will see what i mean when u apply 
it to a solved cube : r2 (du&#x27;)R(du&#x27;) r2 (d&#x27;u)R&#x27;(d&#x27;u). As u can see 
it&#x27;s a commutator :D [(d&#x27;u)= (du&#x27;)&#x27;] If u define E on 4x4x4 to be 
(du&#x27;) then u can indeed write it as : r2 ERE r2 E&#x27;R&#x27;E&#x27; !!

Cheers!

-Per

PS! Why doesn&#x27;t setup moves work for center-rotation algs on the 
3x3x3 cube ? :-P

Is it just me, or are there entirely way too many instances of &quot;u&quot; in
that sentence?  It&#x27;s quite confusing here, and it would help to write
&quot;you&quot; when appropriate in such a statement. ;-)

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;d been meaning to write a little program that takes a scramble and <br>
give the disjoint cyclic notation of the pieces for blindfold <br>
solving.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s finally here, I managed to put in the time for it.<br>
<br>
So basically you give it the scramble (I prefer to use the Scramble <br>
generator in NetCube, it exports in the perfect format), and the <br>
program returns:<br>
<br>
Length: 0<br>
CO: 0000 0000<br>
EO: 0000 0000 0000<br>
CP: (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)<br>
EP: (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)<br>
<br>
For the solved case if you do not turn on 1-cycle supression. <br>
Actaully I&#x27;m not sure if it can handle the solved case.... oh ya it <br>
can :).<br>
<br>
The beautiful part about this is that you can label things however <br>
you like... you can call a corner &quot;Bob&quot; if you&#x27;d like. THe program <br>
supports whatever numbering/ordering you like.<br>
<br>
The user defines what is positively/nutural/negatively oriented <br>
corner for instance. Though CO is defined in the UD manner, and EO <br>
is defined in the R2L2 restriction.<br>
<br>
The order it outputs the cycles is also user defined.<br>
<br>
Read the accompanying files carefully and enjoy.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s under the files section of this forum called &quot;BLD.zip&quot;.<br>
<br>
I look forward to sugguestions/improvements for future versions.<br>

          <div class="email-content">You stick with your own numbering, practically nothing new to learn 
in order to enjoy this program.

It is run from the command line and I have included a windows 
verison and linux version.

I have a sample preferences file included (where the user only has 
to set their personal options once..., or swap out the file for a 
different setup); there is a list of scrambles for sample input 
(generated from NetCube); and there is the output file for what it 
looks like if you ran it correctly with those inputs.

In both Linux and Windows, one way of running it is:
&quot;bld &lt; scrambles.txt > output.txt&quot;
If one or both streams are not &quot;redirected&quot; then of course it 
accepts the scrambles from the keyboard and/or outputs to the 
console.

It&#x27;s kinda wierd when you run it with an output file but no input 
file..., you&#x27;d have to type the scrambles in without any text 
prompting you to.

========================
Uses:
Instead of doing a full bld solve, you can spend a full sitting 
doing only the memorization part. Punch the scrmables through and it 
will be an instant check to see if you remembered it correctly.

In fact, try to rush yourself a bit to the point just before you 
make mistakes. THis porgram is here to help you find that point 
effectively.

Secondly, you can now spend a full sitting, NOT doing any 
memorization (i.e. lazy-bld). Just preform the scramble and stick it 
under the table while looking at the program output. This way you 
can try to minimize your execution time, and since memorization is 
not longer so expensive, you are more free to do riskier things :). 
Like trying that new lovely, exotic alg that flips 6, 8 or 10 edges 
symmutaneously, which you&#x27;ve been itchin&#x27; to do. 

Hey if nothing else, it makes BLD more fun for EVERBODY!

&gt; &gt; IDEA 1 (can use it in comp.)<br>
&gt; &gt; You need 2 cubes C1 and C2, and 2 scrambling algs S1 and S2.<br>
&gt; &gt; The 2 cubes must have the same color schemes. Let&#x27;s say that<br>
&gt; &gt; C2 is the own cube of the competitor (lubed, etc.).<br>
&gt; &gt; Protocol :<br>
&gt; &gt; a. scramble C1 with S1<br>
&gt; &gt; b. scramble C2 with S2 followed by S1.<br>
&gt; &gt; c. give C1 to competitor for inspection and memorization<br>
&gt; &gt; d. take+hide C1 from competitor once memorization is done.<br>
&gt; &gt; e. give C2 to competitor.<br>
&gt; &gt; f. competitor now &quot;blindfoldsolves&quot; C2 with eyes opened as <br>
&gt; &gt;    if it were C1.<br>
&gt; &gt; g. take C2 from competitor<br>
&gt; &gt; h. apply inverse(S2) [the reverse of the sramble S2] to C2<br>
&gt; &gt; i. check if C2 is now solved.<br>
&gt; &gt; François, Paris<br>
<br>
This reminds me very much of a magic trick you can do with two cubes. <br>
It was invented by Jerry Sadowitz after I explained to him the trick <br>
method for solving a cube behind your back.<br>
<br>
Have the two cubes scrambled as above, but with S2 equal to the <br>
superflip. You can allow both cubes to be mixed further, as long as <br>
the same moves are done to both (essentially extending S1 a bit). You <br>
don&#x27;t need to see this scrambling.<br>
<br>
One cube is hidden (doesn&#x27;t matter which one), the other handed to <br>
you behind your back. You haven&#x27;t seen either cube, and yet you can <br>
arrange your cube to match the hidden one exactly (just by doing the <br>
superflip S2 again).<br>
