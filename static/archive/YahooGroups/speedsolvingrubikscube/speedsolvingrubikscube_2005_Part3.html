That&#x27;s pretty clever. :-)

That means he didn&#x27;t follow the official rules for blindfold. What 
more u need to know? His achievements are still great. Just the fact 
he can solve the 5x5x5 cube at the age of 9 is really amazing :-) I&#x27;m 
sure Bernett will be back with great blindfold times following the 
official rules :-)

That was the initial barrier. You&#x27;ve just persuaded me that I should 
make more of an effort with the rest of it.  :D

That&#x27;s just a question, not a request from myself (maybe for others, 
don&#x27;t know). I don&#x27;t need yet another reason/way to not do full 
blindsolving ;-) Recently I&#x27;ve often solved with my blindsolving 
method but without being blindfolded, that&#x27;s pretty much the same as 
your second usage idea minus the excitement ;-) But now that I finally 
finished my set of mental images yesterday, I want to force myself to 
do real complete blindsolving...

<br>
Some cubers from the UK and Australia had a really fun meeting hosted <br>
by former one-handed world record holder Duncan Dicks. We had a really <br>
great time meeting each other, and we also held a friendly competition.<br>
<br>
This was the first time I put into practice the handicap method which <br>
was discussed earlier in the group, and even though I do say so myself <br>
(and I&#x27;m sure the others will agree with me) it worked very very well! <br>
So well, I may even write a page detailing how to use it for future <br>
friendly comps :)<br>
<br>
Jasmine Lee won the 3x3x3 event, and I will post the full results <br>
online on my website, when I write a report of my experiences (which <br>
will probably be tomorrow now).<br>
<br>

Be sure to watch out for the pictures and the report coming soon! :)<br>

<br>
Very good records! (I will update later today...)<br>
<br>
At the moment my best 4x4x4 cube is a Rubik&#x27;s Studio 4x4x4.<br>
But I bought two Rubiks.com 4x4x4&#x27;s. They are already nice, but I expect<br>
them to become much better.<br>
My Eastsheen 4x4x4&#x27;s really suck, but that puzzle has huge differences per<br>
cube. David Wesley had one of the best 4x4x4&#x27;s in Toronto, and it was an<br>
Eastsheen.<br>
Do not give up too soon on your Rubiks.com 4x4x4. After a while it will<br>

&gt;     Hi everyone!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  Yesterday I lowered my personal best and average for 4*4*4 to<br>
&gt;  1:16,67/1:27,34. I use a Meffert&#x27;s 4*4*4 but I will get my Rubik&#x27;s<br>
&gt;  4*4*4 any day now. Is the Rubik version better for speedcubing? If it<br>
&gt;  is eassier to perfor triggers I will be able to cut of at least 10<br>
&gt;  seconds from my average with my current method.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

>From my experience with various 4x4x4 cube i would say that it&#x27;s not 
necessarily the cube with which you can fingertrick most easily 
which will be your best cube ;-) Much more important than pure 
slickness of turning layers is stability of the cube. My old 
rubiks.com 4x4x4 cube turns much more easily than any of my 2 studio 
4x4x4. On the other hand it&#x27;s not stable at all. I spend too much 
time making sure not to overturn and to avoid frequent popping. 
There should stil be some resistance to your turning of the layers. 
This will make you turn much more accurately and the cube won&#x27;t pop 
easily. On the old design 4x4x4 cubes with a spherical core the most 
important thing is that the core doesn&#x27;t have any severe skewness. 
You can easily feel skewness when turning the cube as a 2x2x2 cube 
and resting ur palm against one half of the cube. You will feel 
something move distinctively round in circles inside if there is 
skewness. The more skew the more you feel it :-( A tight cube with 
less skewness will be better that a looser cube with more skewness, 
cause it will be more stable and you feel more confident with it. 
It&#x27;s a shame we can&#x27;t simply pick a good cube from the factory 
ourselves :-P

Your new times are great! If u really can shave off 10 more seconds 
it&#x27;s awesome :-)

Cheers!

-Per

PS! These observations do hold for my method anyway. I use lots of 
inner slice turns to make up my commutators. Edge-pairing/3x3x3 
reduction scheme maybe is more fogiving to a loose/rattling cube? 
I&#x27;m not sure but i guess maybe that&#x27;s a the case ;-)

I know what you mean... you can even find out the orientation of the 
centre ball that way.  It&#x27;s annoying, but is there /really/ no cure for 
it?  E.g., small adjustments of the core; filing down some core pieces, 
etc.

          <div class="email-content">I have been thinking about a 3x3x3 Sudoku Cube,

where you would have a box of 9 numbers on each sticker, and you 
would have to create a traditional Sudoku puzzle on each face.

Of course you wouldn&#x27;t need to solve the box, but you would still 
have to make the rows and columns on each face.

4x4x4 Sudoku sounds awesome! I expect there would be some hardcore 
maths involved, although I might have a go in the old fashioned 
trial and error way later ;)

One thing, how does one make sure that a Sudoku has only one 
solution?

I havn&#x27;t seen any edges on my 2*2*2. But to swap two diagonal corners

Im guessing you mean corners since a 2x2x2 doesnt have edges.

I should have mentioned that I wanted to keep the orientation. :)

<br>
Is there a set of algs (or a 2x2x2 solver) that doesn&#x27;t care what the<br>
orientation of the cube is after applying CLL (to solve the 2nd layer<br>
starting with the first layer solved?)<br>
<br>
So it solves the cube but maybe ends with the cube rotated some way.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I also recommend CLL for what you&#x27;re doing with it.  COLL algs are often longer, in order to preserve edge orientation.  If you&#x27;re only going to use it on the 2x2, you may as well learn whichever CLL or COLL case is fastest for a given situation.

-Mike Bennett

P.S.  How on Earth do you learn them all so fast?!  I&#x27;m going at a snail&#x27;s pace.  I&#x27;ve put so much effort into my 4x4 lately I haven&#x27;t learned a COLL case in probably two weeks.  You already know more of them than I do.  Are you learning them all from Lars&#x27; site, or do you use other sites, as well?  If so, which ones?

Well, the main reason I&#x27;m learning COLL is for 3x3, and the 2x2 usage
is just like an added bonus for me. :)  Of course, you can adapt COLL
algs on a 2x2 to make them easier (L R&#x27; = x&#x27; and tricks like that)

I have an easy time memorizing algorithms.  What I have been doing is
spending one day to learn an entire case of algorithms, then spending
the next day to practice the recognition.  So far the timeline looks
like this:
Day 1 -- Learn DoubleSune algs (easy, only 3 new algs, super-easy
recognition)
Day 2 -- Practice DoubleSune algs/recognition
Day 3 -- Learn Sune/Antisune algs (10 new algs, but 5 are mirrors!)
Day 4 -- Practice Sune/Antisune algs/recognition
Day 5 -- Learn &quot;T&quot; algs (very easy recognition, only 5 new algs, but 1
is a mirror!)
Day 6 (today) -- Practice &quot;T&quot; algs/recogntion
Day 7 (tomorrow) -- Learn either U, L, or Pi cases
etc.  Only 3 cases remain, so I should be done learning by Sunday. :)

I have been using Lars V&#x27;s and Dan H&#x27;s algorithms.  I know there is a
list of COLL algs on SCC, too, but I don&#x27;t know of any other sites
that have them.  Anyone else?

I was going to learn the &#x27;U&#x27; cases next, but I&#x27;m thinking about the Sune/Antisune cases instead, because they seem more frequent.

Any thoughts?

          <div class="email-content">I would definitely suggest the Sune/Antisune if you are ambidextrous.
:)  That way, you can tackle twice as many algorithms with the same
effort just by mirroring algorithms.  The recognition is exactly the
same, just mirrored.  Most of the algorithms are either mirrors, or in
some cases, you can use the inverse of another algorithm instead.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
First off I got this idea from Richard Patterson, so all my credit for<br>
this goes to him.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve recently started solving (after seeing Richard do it) my opposite<br>
cross color frequently.  During inspection I will always check both<br>
white and yellow and see which cross is set up better.<br>
<br>
I think this is helping my times.  I don&#x27;t get too thrown off with a<br>
yellow cross solve, since my F2L edges are the same.  I never have to<br>
look for an edge that has a yellow or white sticker, which is what<br>
throws me off about full color neutrality.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve had several solves where the white cross (my color I used to<br>
ALWAYS use, no matter what) was terrrrrrible, but my yellow cross was<br>
maybe an extended cross, or just a nice smooth easy cross.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m going to start using this all the time now.  The benefits are that<br>
I get to use two centers as my basis, so I have twice as much chance<br>
of getting a good cross as I used to.<br>
<br>
Also, since the F2L edges are ALWAYS the same, I won&#x27;t get thrown off<br>
during the F2L with a lot of practice.<br>
<br>
Again all credit to Richard here, as I got the idea from him, but this<br>
is now my current approach to F2L.<br>
<br>
What does everyone think?  Has anyone else ever considered solving<br>
your opposite color?<br>
<br>
Note: I would never solve a cross that is not white or yellow, since<br>
that would have an F2L edge that I noramally have as either a cross or<br>
LL edge, which would throw me off too much.  The only colors I<br>
consider are my old cross color, and it&#x27;s opposite.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been doing this for a while now, and it works wonders.  The only problem I run into is every great once in a while I somehow manage to place a pair in the wrong slot, because I&#x27;m used to red being clockwise from blue, or something of that nature.  Sometimes, having white for the last layer helps, too.  It&#x27;s so darned bright.<br>
<br>
Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that an easy way to shave off a couple of moves is to use working corners/edges.  If they&#x27;re correctly placed, it generally takes 4 or fewer moves to finish off the pair, instead of 7 or more.  The worst cases are something like 5 and 6 moves, so it&#x27;s almost always a good idea.<br>

<br>
A couple people requested that I put up some forums. I got a little<br>
bored today, so I put some up. Feel free to use them if you have the<br>
desire to. You will now see a link to them off strangepuzzle.com or<br>
you can access them directly by going to forum.strangepuzzle.com<br>
<br>
As a side note, the videos now have a naming scheme so the names<br>
actually make sense when you download them. Thanks to everyone who is<br>
sending in videos. I love to watch them!!<br>

          <div class="email-content">I always use working corners/edges for all of the F2L that I do and I&#x27;m
convinced it&#x27;s just as efficient as F2L pairs once you&#x27;ve picked up a few
tricks.  Having said that the more mechanical nature of F2L pairs has a lot
of advantages!

          <div class="email-content">Actually, usually Norwegians and Swedes make fun of others as much 
as they can. They use blond jokes against eachother, and instead of 
saying that blondes did those stupid things, they say that 
Norwegians did them.
Like, &#x27;Why did the Norwegian bring a car door into the desert? So 
that he can roll down the window if it gets to hot!&#x27; :))

And by the way, Finnish usually just keep to themselves and dont 
care much about the swedes or nowegians are fighting about.

          <div class="email-content">I tried this idea, it&#x27;s pretty cool! I have the same problem as Mike 
described also, but I don&#x27;t think it would take too long to get used 
to it. Its quite odd having blue to the right of red, rather than 
the other way round.

I also have tried a similar trick for the 4x4x4, I used to first 
solve White, then solve Yellow, and then solve the other four faces 
one after the other. I remember the order of the colours (so the 
colour scheme ends up being correct), by always turning the Yellow 
face into my Right hand, and then going around the cube using the 
word R-BOG (which means Red Blue Orange Green obviously)

But sometimes the White isn&#x27;t the easiest first colour to solve, so 
now I have 3 rules about which colour I have in my right hand (after 
solving the first two opposite faces) and 3 different words 
(depending on which colours are left) After some practice, it has 
improved my centres by a few seconds at least, because I can always 
pick the easiest centre to start off with.

Another trick I have found useful, while I am talking about 4x4x4, 
is when solving the final 4 centres, to try and preserve rows of 2 
if possible. This means that you might have to do a couple of extra 
moves when lining up the first two of the four, but then you are 
usually always faced with a very eaasy and fast case for the final 2 
centres. I&#x27;m yet to test whether it actually improves my centre 
solving time or not, I&#x27;m still taking about 25 seconds for the 
centres which I know is longer than the really fast guys, so I 
wouldn&#x27;t mind some tips too!

Now surely I know that works, but then i have to turn the cube upside
down and fix the same problem on the other side of the cube ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I was recently messing around with some ZBF2L stuff on my cube and<br>
found a case I&#x27;ve never seen/used before.  It&#x27;s a very helpful ZBF2L<br>
alg, but also very nice for using as just a standard F2L alg.<br>
<br>
Do R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; to a solved F2L (cross on bottom).<br>
<br>
To solve I used to do the inverse of the alg above, but I just found F<br>
R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U R&#x27;<br>
<br>
You can do this as y (r U&#x27; r&#x27;) y&#x27; (R2 U R&#x27;)<br>
<br>
So you save 2 moves instead of the usual 8 move alg.<br>

&gt; I was recently messing around with some ZBF2L stuff on my cube and<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Do R U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; to a solved F2L (cross on bottom).<br>

&gt; To solve I used to do the inverse of the alg above, but I just found F<br>
&gt; R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 U R&#x27;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; You can do this as y (r U&#x27; r&#x27;) y&#x27; (R2 U R&#x27;)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; So you save 2 moves instead of the usual 8 move alg.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Again I came up with this alg for use for ZBF2L.  If it stinks for F2L
then don&#x27;t use it.  I just wanted to see if anyone had ever seen it.

So the answer to your question for me is absolutely, but I use the alg
for a different purpose ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Other than the {R,U} move this one is my favorite for this case,
though it starts with the U turn at a different angle.  This alg also
happens to be the basis for about 5 other ZBF2L algs.  The other ones
just use maybe 3 setup moves to get into this case, then solve from there.

F&#x27; U F R U R&#x27; (do the inverse to setup the case)

This one is fast, nice easy conjugate U move sequences.

Along those lines I also like this alg: F&#x27; U&#x27; F R U R&#x27; (do the inverse
to setup)

Both of those are quite nice.

I&#x27;d try this, but I&#x27;m allergic to silicone. ;)  Also, isn&#x27;t there a

It is difficult - I take it you&#x27;ve already put in a 6 (that part is 
easy). To give you more idea of the difficulty, I gave a friend who 
also does Sudoku another grid with the numbers 1,2,... on which 
order to fill the squares in! (That was a while ago and he still 
hasn&#x27;t got the second one in yet.)
I don&#x27;t know where you are in the puzzle, so I&#x27;ll tell you this - 
the second number to put in goes in the square below that I&#x27;ve 
labelled with &quot;@&quot;. The third one goes where the # is. 
(If you get really stuck, I can post a complete solution that 
explains how to get each step without trial and error.)

I don&#x27;t see how you guys know that in Finland jokes about Swedes are 
less frequent than in Norway, or if they are part of Finnish tradition 
at all. The fact that Swedish is a compulsory language in Finnish 
schools and that Swedish is an official language in Finland already 
tells about how many Swedish jokes there should be in the Finnish 
folklore. It&#x27;s about the same thing as jokes about Hungarians in 
Romania, although the Hungarian language is not compulsory or an 
official language in Romania. The Swedish minority in Finland is just 
as large as the Hungarian minority in Romania, and I think that&#x27;s the 
main reason for the jokes (and also of course the common history the 
two countries have).

&quot;What does it read on the bottom of a Swedish swimming pool?

&lt;&lt;No smoking>>&quot;

I really like this. I&#x27;m been working on my cross seriously for the last week 
or so.

Seems like a waste of time trying to memorize so many moves when you can 
take advantage of the opposite color having 1 cross piece already in 
position and a few others ready to go in.

Thought it would be hard to get used to. But didn&#x27;t take very long.

Thanks for the Info
Dwayne

Its possible to swap any two outer edges on an ordinary 5x5. But when I<br>
try to do it on a super-5x5 I not only swap two outer edges but also two<br>
centers (centers-edges). Is it possible to swap only a pair of outer<br>
edges on a super cube, or is there some strange parity connecting those<br>
pieces?<br>

          <div class="email-content">The parity of those centers (the &quot;+&quot; ones as I call them, the ones
that form the plus around the centermost piece) is connected to that
of the corners and outer edges.

If you just want to swap the outer edges (and any other required
effects) then you want to leave the corners in the solved state (even
permutation).

If the corners are in an even permutation and the edges are in an odd
permutation (since you want to swap just two), then those plus sign
centers must also be odd.

This is because every type of quarter turn, inner slice or outer face,
affects the parity of those &quot;+&quot; centers.  If the corners are even then
the net number of outerface quarter turns done is even, and if the
outer edges are odd then the net number of inner slice turns is odd.

So the net number of turns total is odd and therefore the &quot;+&quot; centers
have odd parity.  This is because every type of quarter turn affects
the parity of these guys.

That&#x27;s why switching two outer edges requires also switching two &quot;+&quot;
centers.

It is difficult - I take it you&#x27;ve already put in a 6 (that part is 
easy). To give you more idea of the difficulty, I gave a friend who 
also does Sudoku another grid with the numbers 1,2,... on which 
order to fill the squares in! (That was a while ago and he still 
hasn&#x27;t got the second one in yet.)
I don&#x27;t know where you are in the puzzle, so I&#x27;ll tell you this - 
the second number to put in goes in the square below that I&#x27;ve 
labelled with &quot;@&quot;. The third one goes where the # is. 
(If you get really stuck, I can post a complete solution that 
explains how to get each step without trial and error.)

I somewhat disagree, but that comes mostly because I don&#x27;t understand 
your desire to not change the corners.

Summary: You have two causes that change the parity of several groups 
of pieces.

Outer layer: corners, Xcenters, +centers, middle edges
Inner slice: +centers, outer edges

So there are four different parity situations because those two causes 
can be combined 2*2 ways. Combining both you have a parity for the 
outer edges but not the +centers.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">I interpretted the first post as the want to switch *just* two outer
edges, which also requires switching two of the + centers.

I agree that switching just outer edges as well as changing the corner
parity, the inner edges, and the x centers to odd is ok too.

I remember I hadn&#x27;t noticed that till your (Uu) example a long time
ago ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey Mike,<br>
<br>
&gt; I understand that if one orients the edges during F2L, then performs<br>
COLL, the odds of skipping the PLL are 1/12.  What if one orients two<br>
of the pieces during F2L, then performs CLL, purposely flipping two<br>
edges?  Are the odds 1/48?  1/12 if the edges come up oriented?<br>
<br>
Shouldn&#x27;t you know which edges are going to be flipped?  A small<br>
amount of practice will teach you which edges are going to be flipped<br>
when you perform a CLL alg.  If instead it is random, I think it<br>
should be 1/6 * 1/12 = 1/72 for the edges to be oriented.<br>
<br>
&gt; What are good average times for most algorithms?<br>
<br>
Though I&#x27;ve only been using COLL+PLL for 8 days, I think almost all of<br>
the algorithms can be sub-2.  Surely there is at least one sub-2<br>
algorithm for each of the 7 orienations, with an average of 1.5 or so.<br>
 If it will take you about 2.5 seconds instead of 1.5, then also<br>
consider the amount of time you are losing at this stage for<br>
recognition (recognition of COLL is clearly going to take longer than<br>
just OLL).  Thus, you will probably be losing 1.5-2 seconds on this<br>
stage to *maybe* have a faster PLL.  That&#x27;s not worth it. ;)  Almost<br>
all of the COLL algorithms I have learned are very easy and very fast,<br>
but there are a couple of cruddy cases.  I don&#x27;t know for sure yet<br>
because I still have 8 cases to go. ;-)  I will hopefully make videos<br>
showing the fingertricks and stuff when I&#x27;m done learning and get most<br>
of these algorithms to be reasonably fast.<br>
<br>
 <br>
&gt; Should I strive for sub-2 on most of my corner algs?  All of the<br>
ones I currently have learned I average under 3 with, with most of<br>
those under 2.5.<br>
<br>
I am sure you are capable of sub-2 for most, with an average of about<br>
1.5 for many.<br>
<br>
&gt; What about edge algs?<br>
<br>
You mean the edge PLLs?  For me, the 3-cycles are just over 1.5 on<br>
avg, the Z-perm about 1.9 and the one that looks like a &quot;+&quot; is my<br>
fastest PLL at about 1.3 seconds. :-)<br>
 <br>
&gt; And what are some fast algs for the Z-permutation?  I currently use<br>
(RB&#x27;)(R&#x27;B)(FR&#x27;FB&#x27;)(R&#x27;BR)(F2U), but it takes me around 2.5 on average,<br>
which seems a bit much for a simple edge PLL.<br>
<br>
That one definitely doesn&#x27;t fit my hands! :-P  I use <br>
<br>
x&#x27; F (R U&#x27;) (R&#x27; Ua) (R&#x27; e) (R&#x27; U) (R D2)<br>
<br>
which is just angled differently.  I have a slow and fast video:<br>
http://www.cubewhiz.com/videos/pll/pll04slow.avi<br>
http://www.cubewhiz.com/videos/pll/pll04fast.avi<br>
<br>
The fast video isn&#x27;t overly fast, but it is still sub-2 seconds. :-)<br>

There are 12 cases of edge permutation on the LL.

1 All in place
4 One in place, three out of place clockwise
4 One in place, three out of place counterclockwise
1 two pairs swapped across
2 two pairs swapped adjacent
__
12 total

Using lower case letters for slices try

r2 D f2 D&#x27; f r2 f&#x27;

It sounds like you&#x27;re doing all right timewise.

Don&#x27;t you realize you contradict yourself? :-) If you switch two 
+centers as well, then you&#x27;re *not* &quot;just switching outer edges&quot;.

I could just as well claim it &quot;requires&quot; switching of two corners, two 
inner edges and two Xcenters. But that claim would be just as wrong.

find it confusing and I only use it when this method overlaps with it.

This is how Masayuki Akimoto recognizes, and this is more or less how
I do it too.

All you have to do is look around on the cube for sticker positions
that contain either opposite colored stickers, or same colored
stickers.  Most of the cases with two adjacent corners flipped and the
other two correctly oriented will be the same as the 2x2 grid method,
but the others are very different.

Not to put down the &quot;standard&quot; speedcubing.com method, but I find it
confusing.  Try Masayuki&#x27;s method, I think it is much clearer.

Hi Chris, <br>
<br>
It is always interesting to see your posts about COLLs. <br>
Since there are not many CLL (COLL) &gt; ELL cubers, it is good chance <br>
for me to think my algs. <br>

Sorry, I missed your old posts. <br>
I used to use B L&#x27; U2 L B&#x27; L&#x27; B U2 B&#x27; L. <br>
<br>
Probably one year ago, I changed this as similar to yours, but I do <br>
Alan (?) then anti-Sune(?). <br>
It is because of my recogition. <br>
I have to distinguish two cases. <br>
1: L&#x27; U R U&#x27; L U R&#x27;<br>
2: L&#x27; U R U&#x27; L U R&#x27; - L U2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27; L&#x27;<br>
<br>
If the recognition system is different, you may not be interested in. <br>
In regard to permution speed, I think I still can do faster with old <br>
alg. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Masayuki!

I have a question?  How do you perform B L&#x27; U2 L B&#x27; L&#x27; B U2 B&#x27; L ?

I do it as (B) (L&#x27; U2) x&#x27; (L U&#x27; L&#x27; U) y&#x27; R2 (U&#x27;) (F)

Maybe I just need to practice this alg more, of do it differently.  I
can get very fast times with it if I have a flawless execution, but if
I lockup my time for it is about 4 seconds :-(

I can do the RUL sune/alan one in about 2.75 on average, so I guess
I&#x27;m just debating whether I am just doing a good alg poorly, or if
that alg is slow for my hands.

I&#x27;d be curious in how you execute that case, or if you have any other
cool algs for it.

Thanks for the help and the comments!
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey again Masayuki,

Yeah my execution is very poor for B L&#x27; U2 L B&#x27; L&#x27; B U2 B&#x27; L
(02.50), 03.20, 03.28, 02.88, 04.20, 03.95, 03.06, 04.13, (04.53),
04.37, 03.26, 04.18 = 3.65

But for R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R - L&#x27; U R U&#x27; L U R&#x27; is better
02.72, (02.28), 02.45, (03.65), 03.38, 02.63, 02.34, 02.97, 02.72,
03.22, 03.26, 02.78 = 2.85

I always seem to lockup with the first B turn transition into the x&#x27;
(L U&#x27; L&#x27; U).

Also I have a question for you, can you recognize the CLL cases from
different angles?  I&#x27;ve been meaning to learn the sune cases from the
180 degree rotation of where I currently recognize.  Since I use your
method of same and opposite colored stickers I can do the 4 corner
flipped cases from multiple angles, but the two corners flipped cases
and the sunes I have to do from the same angle.

Do you use multiple angles for recognition, and if so does it help?

Thanks again,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Lots of questions from me today :-D<br>
<br>
I have a question about whether anyone uses this particular empty slot<br>
case?  I&#x27;ve recently realize that I rely very heavily on this alg, and<br>
use it quite often.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s not the fastest case, but then again I have gotten fast solves<br>
when using it.  I guess I consider this case to be somewhat mediocre,<br>
but maybe I&#x27;m just reading too much into things.<br>
<br>
The case is:<br>
R&#x27; F R F&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R (do the inverse of this alg to setup the case)<br>
<br>
It solves the BR pair, but it does so by using the FR one.<br>
<br>
Again I&#x27;ve noticed that I really do rely on this alg heavily, but I<br>
don&#x27;t know if it is a good alg to use (F and R moves, and 7 moves<br>
where most empty slot case are 5 or so).<br>
<br>
If anyone uses this alg a lot, thinks it sucks and would puke to see<br>
another cube use it lol, let me know.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m really curious about what others think about this case, since I<br>
don&#x27;t remember how I learned this alg.  I think I found it when<br>
messing around with Ron&#x27;s cube solver, but I&#x27;m not sure.<br>
<br>
Anyway let me know what you think, positive or negative, I really am<br>
curious!<br>

<br>
&gt; Yeah my execution is very poor for B L&#x27; U2 L B&#x27; L&#x27; B U2 B&#x27; L<br>
&gt; = 3.65<br>
= 8.56/3, 8.32/3 (timed 3 executions)<br>
<br>
&gt; But for R&#x27; U&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R - L&#x27; U R U&#x27; L U R&#x27; is better<br>
&gt; = 2.85<br>
= 9.02/3, 8.70/3<br>
<br>
I would do much faster. <br>
In both two cases, gripping position is completely different, it is <br>
difficult to compare directly. <br>
<br>
About my execution, it is very dificult to write down. <br>
So I made small video. <br>
Please try it. <br>

&gt; Also I have a question for you, can you recognize the CLL cases from<br>

&gt; Do you use multiple angles for recognition, and if so does it help?<br>
Not all cases, but I practice a lot of the cases of multiangle <br>
recognition. I think this does help. <br>
<br>
But in order to recognize CLL with edge flipping, I need to do from <br>
the same angle. I loose a second here. <br>
I think I need to go back more simple method. <br>

I havn&#x27;t seen this alg before, but I must say I like it very much. 
It&#x27;s possible to execute very fast, and I think it&#x27;s quite easy to 
recognize the case.

I use the same as your original alg, except I perform it differently:

[U2] (F R&#x27;) U2 (R F&#x27;) (R&#x27; F) U2 (F&#x27; R)

I&#x27;m not so good at those B and L turns. ;)

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for all the responses everyone,

I&#x27;m glad to know that others like it too.  I guess I just wanted to
make sure I wasn&#x27;t spending a lot of my F2L time on this case if
others though it wasn&#x27;t necessary.

I also use this one, which is more of a standard F2L empty slot case
in that it is only 5 moves long.

This one is the same as the other one in that the edge is flipped in
another F2L slot, but this one is much better than the other.

Case: L2 D F2 D&#x27; L2 (do the inverse of this alg to setup the case)
This case solves BL by using the FR slot.

Both this alg and the first I posted go together very nicely.  This
one I remember I found via intuition after I learned the first one.

Hope everyone has some use for these.

Chris

P.S.  While I&#x27;m at it I&#x27;ve also started using these a lot too.  Both
of these I found intuitively by getting tired of running into these
cases without a way to solve.

1) R2 D&#x27; F2 D R2 (solve FL using BR, do the inverse to setup)
2) R&#x27; U R&#x27; D&#x27; F&#x27; D R2 (the same as the above case, only the F2L edge
is flipped the other way).  Do the inverse to setup.

Nice, thanks (the others, too). How about using u instead of D?

1) R2 u&#x27; R2 u R2
2) R&#x27; U R&#x27; u&#x27; R&#x27; u R2

So u mean in actual we have only 3 parity scenarios : 1,2 and 1+2

For 7x7x7 cube we would then have following scenarios :

1,2,3,1+2,1+3,2+3,1+2+3 (7 scenarios).

That&#x27;s exactly how i think also. No real need to look at cycle 
decompositions to prove this, thought that can be interesting in 
itself ;-)

This extends easily to larger cubes of course :-)

Great, I wanted to do that anyway, obviously Francois was faster ;-) 
I&#x27;m gonna submit one soon and I&#x27;d really love to see the times of the 
top guys...

One suggestion, though: It says &quot;Time for cross and 4 F2L pairs.&quot; So 
is only Fridrich allowed? How about Petrus? Or anything else that 
solves (at least) two adjacent parallel layers? I think they should be 
allowed.

Cheers!

This is a bit OT for cubing but anyway, here&#x27;s the first few steps (to get the first 7 cells in).
It&#x27;s still difficult after this so there&#x27;s still a challenge left but it still doesn&#x27;t need any trial &amp; 
error.
Initial Grid:  (above)
For convenience label rows R1 to R9 (downwards), columns C1-C9 (left to right), boxes 
B1-B9 (right then down). 

1. The intersection of R1 and C3 contains 6 (it is the only square in B1 that can contain a 
6). 

*26|***|*** 
***|6**|**3 
*74|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
***|**3|**2 
*8*|*4*|*1* 
6**|5**|*** 
------------------ 
***|*1*|78* 
5**|**9|*** 
***|***|*4* 

2. In C9, 4,7 and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9, leaving only the intersections with R1, R5 and 
R6. In particular, R5 already contains 4 and 8 so the intersection of C9 and R5 must 
contain 7. 

*26|***|*** 
***|6**|**3 
*74|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
***|**3|**2 
*8*|*4*|*17 
6**|5**|*** 
------------------ 
***|*1*|78* 
5**|**9|*** 
***|***|*4* 

3. In B5, 1 and 8 must appear on the leading diagonal as they are already present in C5 
and R5. Thus since 7 is in R5, 7 must occur in the intersection of B5 and C5. In particular 
in C5, 4,7 and 8 appear before B8. Thus in R8 4,7,8 must occur in C2-C4 and hence 4 lies 
in the intersection of C2 and R8. 

*26|***|*** 
***|6**|**3 
*74|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
***|**3|**2 
*8*|*4*|*17 
6**|5**|*** 
------------------ 
***|*1*|78* 
54*|**9|*** 
***|***|*4* 

4. Thus in B4, 4 goes in the intersection of R4 and C1. 

*26|***|*** 
***|6**|**3 
*74|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
4**|**3|**2 
*8*|*4*|*17 
6**|5**|*** 
------------------ 
***|*1*|78* 
54*|**9|*** 
***|***|*4* 

5. Thus in C1, 7 must go in R9. 

*26|***|*** 
***|6**|**3 
*74|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
4**|**3|**2 
*8*|*4*|*17 
6**|5**|*** 
------------------ 
***|*1*|78* 
54*|**9|*** 
7**|***|*4* 

6. Recalling that in R8, C2-C4 contain 4,7 and 8, 8 must go in C3 (because B7 contains 
4,7) and so 7 in C4. 

*26|***|*** 
***|6**|**3 
*74|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
4**|**3|**2 
*8*|*4*|*17 
6**|5**|*** 
------------------ 
***|*1*|78* 
548|7*9|*** 
7**|***|*4*

Hmm, actually I wanted to do an average-of-100, will do that soon (did 
an ave10 a few moments ago).

One more rule suggestion: The cube should always be scrambled just 
like a normal full 3x3.

And I&#x27;d like to ask everyone to not make exceptions. If I get a superb 
F2L I might feel the urge to complete the full 3x3 in order to improve 
my record in that category. But it would make the F2L average 
unrealistic if I throw out fast times this way.

Cheers!
Stefan

Yeah but that was already well-known. What I tried to point out was 
that going quietly makes me go slowly, and it&#x27;s much easier to tell 
myself to go quietly than to go slowly.

I&#x27;m more interested to know whether u were trying a prototype or a 
production version of the puzzle. U could probably tell that from 
the finish of the cube whether it looked like the finished product 
or not ;-) Did it for instance still have the same (unusual) 
colorscheme as in the video on their site ? Still white plastic? 
Ando so on ...

Must have been fun trying it out anyway. And yes u should have 
solved it ;-) I&#x27;t just like a larger 4x4x4 really...

How about fastest reduction to a 3x3x3 cube-state on the 5x5x5 cube? 
Starting from fully scrambled (and allowing both parities). Or 
fastest setting up the cage with my method for the 5x5x5 ? At least 
in the latter category i wouldn&#x27;t have too much competition ;-)

Fastest cross on 3x3x3 could be cool also :-P

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I know a very small minority of people are interested in learning<br>
ZBF2L algs, but I&#x27;m trying to put together the ones that I think would<br>
benefit CFOP solvers the most without having to learn too many algs.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve come up with a proposal for an advanced partial edge control<br>
method for the LL edges while doing the 4th c/e pair.<br>
<br>
Macky already has all the algs to one of the cases I have too, so I&#x27;m<br>
only adding one more F2L case (7 more algs).  The total to learn would<br>
be 13 algorithms, but they would help you to get all oriented edges<br>
where most people would just use partial edge control.<br>
<br>
I added a section at the top of my zbf2l page that describes what I<br>
propose.<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zbf2l.html<br>
<br>
Again, I find these algs to be incredibly useful, and I&#x27;d like to<br>
bring to light the most useful ones that I think could benefit a CFOP<br>
solver.<br>
<br>
I also want to compile a list of all the shortest/fastest to execute<br>
zbf2l algs.  This would mean that instead of the regular f2l case for<br>
a few rare cases, you could use an alg that takes the same amount of<br>
time and get all oriented edges (and the best part is you would *know*<br>
you will get all oriented edges before starting the alg).<br>
<br>
Again, I&#x27;m just trying to make this stuff seem a little more<br>
accessible and show the pros of what I&#x27;m really starting to believe<br>
will be very useful algs to know.<br>
<br>
Let me know what you think about my proposed advanced edge control idea.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris.<br>
<br>
I think extending partial edge control to cases where the c/e pair isn&#x27;t yet together is a fantastic idea and something I&#x27;ve been planning to learn.  You&#x27;ve finally given me an excuse to get around to it.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s helpful because 75+% of the time, my c/e pairs are inserted from one of those cases.  This will make my partial edge solving much more efficient, and will probably eliminate my need for CLL+ELL for all cases except the final pair being solved before I orient edges.<br>
<br>
Because of these last few posts, I&#x27;m starting to believe in the ZBF2L cause a little more.  After I finish learning COLL and perhaps some CLL+ELL, I&#x27;ll probably wind up learning ZBF2L now.  Thanks. ; P<br>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] advanced LL edge control for CFOP<br>
<br>
<br>
  Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
  I know a very small minority of people are interested in learning<br>
  ZBF2L algs, but I&#x27;m trying to put together the ones that I think would<br>
  benefit CFOP solvers the most without having to learn too many algs.<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;ve come up with a proposal for an advanced partial edge control<br>
  method for the LL edges while doing the 4th c/e pair.<br>
<br>
  Macky already has all the algs to one of the cases I have too, so I&#x27;m<br>
  only adding one more F2L case (7 more algs).  The total to learn would<br>
  be 13 algorithms, but they would help you to get all oriented edges<br>
  where most people would just use partial edge control.<br>
<br>
  I added a section at the top of my zbf2l page that describes what I<br>
  propose.<br>
  http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zbf2l.html<br>
<br>
  Again, I find these algs to be incredibly useful, and I&#x27;d like to<br>
  bring to light the most useful ones that I think could benefit a CFOP<br>
  solver.<br>
<br>
  I also want to compile a list of all the shortest/fastest to execute<br>
  zbf2l algs.  This would mean that instead of the regular f2l case for<br>
  a few rare cases, you could use an alg that takes the same amount of<br>
  time and get all oriented edges (and the best part is you would *know*<br>
  you will get all oriented edges before starting the alg).<br>
<br>
  Again, I&#x27;m just trying to make this stuff seem a little more<br>
  accessible and show the pros of what I&#x27;m really starting to believe<br>
  will be very useful algs to know.<br>
<br>
  Let me know what you think about my proposed advanced edge control idea.<br>

CNN said they want me to solve on air which might be difficult since

I just got my 5x and promptly set to solving it. I&#x27;m using the <br>
standard &quot;reduce to 3x&quot; algorithm (centers, match edges, solve like <br>
3x).<br>
<br>
However, I&#x27;m stuck on the final edge match. Do you know any good 5x<br>
solution resources on the web? Chris Hardwick has a great 4x<br>
solutions resource which I use for the few things unique to 4x, but<br>
no 5x.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m stuck, in case you know of a move for it. What&#x27;s<br>
left is the Red-Green and the Red-Blue edge. I have them on the same<br>
layer (front) , opposite each other (FR and FL), with the following <br>
setup (the inner colors of the pair (in caps) are on the Front face)<br>
<br>
Blue-RED                   RED-Green<br>
Red-GREEN                  RED-Blue<br>
Red-GREEN                  BLUE-Red<br>

That&#x27;s the easy case, not parity problem. Think about how you&#x27;d match 
the last two edge pairs of the 4x4.

Cheers!

Sometimes im not in bed until 4 am ;-)

I can see 4 possible reasons for getting up so early:

1) u work in a bakery
2) u are sleepless in the morning
3) u do some hard cube practicing before going to work
4) u like to punish urself ;-)

Hehehe ...

Hi Chris

Congratulation for your hard motivation to learn ZB System !!
I read your note on your web page about your progress and I am 
surprise why you want to persever in this system because you say it 
could&#x27;nt be faster than fridrich if his system is use by excellents 
cubers like those who average 15&#x27; or sub 15 ? isn&#x27;t more &quot;easy&quot; to 
persever in F2L cases to decrease your time? . I say that because I 
think ZBF2L is not the problem of This system. For example you can 
easily decrease the number of configurations if you connect the pair 
on LL etc... or other example . The Big Problem of this system IS THE 
LL PERMUTATIONS (493 algos) and particulary The case: S (72 config.) 
and case: As (72 config) according to Dan Harris &#x27; Page at :
http://www.cubestation.co.uk/
So, 144 config in total on which you surely stuck because there are 
very similar ! I don&#x27;t know if you have always a list of them with 
the color pattern, that will frighten you!

good luck nevertheless 

Nicolas

I usually check your journal everyday and think it´s quite

those algs. What´s the procedure you use when learn new algs. I´m kind

I will be arriving as early as the evening on november 1st. Will 
arrive together with Ron and a bunch of other dutch cubers and 
possibly other european cubers too. Im not sure how many we gonna be 
travelling together :-)

We will be departing in the evening november 8th. So we do get a few 
days outside the 2 days of competition to do sightseeing/shopping and 
so on while we are there ;-)

It will be my first time in the US of A. I guess i wouldn&#x27;t go to USA 
if it wasn&#x27;t for the cubing ;-) There&#x27;s a whole bunch of people i look 
forward to meet in person :-)

Have fun :D

You&#x27;re right stefan, my record for solving corners was about 4s but
sub4 is possible I think.>

I gonna try avoid the shift key for the most part :-P

I don&#x27;t have a good 2x2x2 cube :-(

I do believe that 7-8 secs is possible even with a &quot;no-method&quot; 
approach:

- first layer corners , 3-4 secs (should see how to do those moves 
during preinspection time)

- position LL corners, 2- secs

- orient LL corner, 2+ secs

So total : 7-8 secs

I guess for those who practice the 2x2x2 they will prefer do it on a 
real 2x2x2 cube. Those who don&#x27;t practice much might well prefer to 
do it on a 3x3x3. Even w keeping stickers on the edges left intact :D

Also, is noone using LBL method anymore? Hehehe ... Well i&#x27;m in fact 
still using that and i just did a new pb average of 21.49 secs with 
it, and a new pb single solve of 13.20 also. Not too bad of a 39 yr 
old to still improve his 20 yr old speedcubing method :-))

Cheers!

-Per

PS! As a rough guess i&#x27;d say about 50% use pure fridrich method, 30% 
use some slight variation of it and the rest of us are using corners 
first, label by label or whatever ...

What he means by &quot;lazy&quot; is not that u are lazy to learn that enormous 
high number of special cases. But once you know all that u have 
reduced ur decison-making/intuition or whatever u call it to just 
be &quot;applying cases&quot;. At that stage u are &quot;lazy&quot; i guess ;-)

Relatively &quot;easy&quot; as the 3x3x3 cube is, this is the cube where it 
takes the most time to become a specialist. It&#x27;s taking a lot less 
time and effort to make it to the top in 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 cubing. Oh 
well, 4x4x4 is becoming tougher but there still aren&#x27;t all that many 
sub 3:00 guys around for the 5x5x5 cube.

I have never seen a special F2L category before... But if there is

It&#x27;s actually a combination of 3 and 1, except I work at a call-center

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gilles,<br>
<br>
I think it&#x27;s true for many things.  Personally, these last few days <br>
have been absolutely miserable on the blindfold solving for me.  I <br>
think I failed six solves in the row.  My hands were just slipping and <br>
I was forgetting pieces, transposing pieces... quite the nightmare.  <br>
This was just yesterday so I haven&#x27;t had the chance to take a break, <br>
but I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;ll help.<br>
<br>
It definitely applied when I was speed cubing and I was averaging <br>
around 27 seconds.  I got busy in school and so I took some time off, <br>
about three weeks, and then I came back.  The first two averages were <br>
about 28 but then after I started getting a feel for things, I hit <br>
about 25&#x27;s.<br>
<br>
And in music, generally the best preparation of a major concerto, at <br>
least I did this back in high school, was I learned a piece my <br>
sophomore year, and then put it off and learned some other things, and <br>
then brought it back up again for the competition when I was a senior.  <br>
Taking time off can give a new perspective to things that you weren&#x27;t <br>
able to see before.<br>

a shorter solution to a corner-edge pair.

          <div class="email-content">Multislotting is when you solve more than one F2L piece. Such that
when you make one F2L, the other one is already set-up or in the slot.
There is a website that has a few examples of multislotting
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/family.hayden/cube/cube_frontpage.html
but it doesn&#x27;t work. Multislotting saves times and uses fewer moves
than making two F2L pieces. Also I think you could use Multislotting
for more than two pieces.

  For the last 2 weeks, I hardly touched a cube. Yesterday, I recorded an <br>

  I don&#x27;t remember who it was, Dan Knights maybe, who was saying that <br>

I haven&#x27;t really though of that approach before. I guess there are no 
special algorithms. I&#x27;m almost done learning OLL so maybe 
multislotting will be my next big thing to take a look on.

particular positions it usually applies to the last
layer only, the first 2 layers are pretty much
intuitive.  i recommend lars petrus or macky&#x27;s page to
learn them here are links for two different and good

          <div class="email-content">Hey Gunnar,

When learning a new alg I usually am trying 3-4 different ones out for
the case I am looking at to see which I will like.  I basically just
read the alg off while timing myself to see which one I think will be
faster.  I don&#x27;t memorize each one, I just stare at the notation while
solving to get an idea of how the alg will work.

Once I do decide on an alg, I have already timed myself doing it 10-20
times, so I have a fairly loose idea of how the alg goes.  I usually
have them broken down into 3-5 groups of triggers so I just memorize
those trigger groups.  Once I&#x27;ve done that I time myself again and try
to get the alg to sub-4 (you can substitute whatever time contraint
you want here).

I basically just do averages with that same alg until I get a sub-4
one, or if sub-4 is easy I try for sub-3 etc..

By that point you&#x27;ve probably done 50-60 repetitions of the alg and if
you put the cube down and came back a day or two later you would still
recall it.

I did some research on memory and a lot of sources say that once
something is in your short term memory, you will lose it (forget it)
in 2-3 days.  However, if at the end of those 2-3 days you rehearse
that same thing (basically rememorize it, or think about it a lot),
then you will remember it for maybe 3-6 more days.  Then at the end of
those 6 days rehearse again and you will remember it for a week or
more.  Then at the end of that week rehearse again and you will
remember for a month, etc..

Of course at some point that information enters your procedural memory
and you won&#x27;t forget it unless you don&#x27;t think about it for years (and
sometimes not even then).

So just rehearse it at the end of each memorization period.  I mean
that sounds kind of hoky and weird, but it really does work for me. 
Since I&#x27;m learning algs all the time, I&#x27;m always in the &quot;rehearsal&quot;
stage for some cases at the same time that I&#x27;m in the &quot;just learning
for the first time&quot; for others.

So I sort of always am rehearsing something I learned 3 days, 6 days,
2 weeks, 1 month, a few months ago, etc. as well as learning new algs.

I hope that makes some sense.  I find this technique to work for
learning quickly, meaning always learning new algs, and not forgetting
what you&#x27;ve learned before.

I did mean what Per wrote a few messages back.  I called ZB the &quot;lazy
way out&quot; meaning that it doesn&#x27;t take as much skill as Fridrich during
the solve.  There is less art and more clunky applying of memorized
sequences.  So whereas solving with Fridrich is really an art form, ZB
is just brute force solving and not much art.

Didn&#x27;t mean to sound arrogant if it came across that way, I meant to
compliment the Fridrich method quite a bit actually :-D

          <div class="email-content">haha, how u feel about the fridrich is how i feel
about the petrus, i think it is a skilled beautiful
thought filled method that is an art form; where i
think cfop(fridrich) is kinda of a brute force
solution with not much thought involved, but i&#x27;m not
nearly as good as most on here (averaging around 30-35
seconds now) so this is just the opinion of a solving
slug, so i may be in error....

You&#x27;re going to make me work for it, aren&#x27;t you Stefan! :-)

If I had a 4x4 with the two edges like:

Blue-RED            RED-Blue
Red-GREEN           GREEN-Red

I&#x27;d use d R F&#x27; U R&#x27; F d&#x27;.

So, I played around with that sequence and variants on the 5x5x5, 
not quite getting there. A kind soul (David Barr) then sent me the 
answer for the above 5x5x5 situation:

L2 d2 R F&#x27; U R&#x27; F d2

As one can see, very very similar. So, I didn&#x27;t get it on my own, 
but I did successfully do the 5x5x5 for the first time after this 
one fix! Now, to do it again.

As a random question, it looks like the 5x5x5 doesn&#x27;t come apart as 
easy as the 4x or 3x. Any suggestions from folks on best way to lube 
a 5x5x5? It&#x27;s pretty stiff right now and while it&#x27;s good to build up 
strength, I don&#x27;t need to look like Popeye.

thanks,

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
So yeah, I&#x27;m a self admitted calendar cube addict.  I use my calendar<br>
cube everyday, and always change it with the day :-D  It actually is a<br>
lot of fun!<br>
<br>
I thought of an interesting challenge for it.  Trying to minimize the<br>
number of turns required to change each day (average for each month).<br>
 You can take longer to solve the next day and also do some moves to<br>
prepare the day after that, but then again you can&#x27;t do too much since<br>
you have to solve today in as few moves as possible.<br>
<br>
I also wonder if there is a distinct cube configuration for the<br>
beginning of each month such that every time you solve a day, the next<br>
day is setup very easily.  It seems with some thought you could plan<br>
out this entire solution and just setup the cube that way at the<br>
beginning of each month with a regular Fridrich solve.  So the first<br>
day of that month is say 50-55 moves (or you could FMC the solution on<br>
a regular cube and get it in even less) then each day after that is<br>
maybe 5 or so.<br>
<br>
Not sure which the best way would be, but it&#x27;s fun to try to turn<br>
something that seems at first to be simple into a more complicated puzzle.<br>
<br>
Does anyone else use the calendar cube, or try to minimize the moves<br>
required for each day change?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tom, 

I could relate when you say you thought you were good at 1:15 and then 
it&#x27;s kind of deflating stumbling across all these cube freaks here.  
Still, doing it at all, whether one minute or three, is impressive to 
any normal human.  I could do the cube at about that fast when I 
stumbled in here; now at about 40 and having a lot more fun with it.  
I also never met another person who could do it at all until recently--
and I used to live in Southern California where apparently there are 
more cubers than just about anywhere.  Oh well.    

How do you go about solving it?  Depending on what you do now, one of 
the methods out there may be easier to pick up...
best, 
Kirk

          <div class="email-content">Hey Rinie, 

you&#x27;ll get overwhelmed very quickly if you try to go too fast 
learning all the stuff out there.  Take it one step at a time.  If 
you do a layer by layer approach, maybe start with 
learning/improving on the OLL and PLL algorithms that affect edges 
only or corners only.  [sorry if you don&#x27;t know what OLL or PLL is 
yet, but lots of sites can get you caught up on the terminology].  
Basically, if you can flip the edges, then flip the corners, then re-
arrange the edges, then the corners, you can do the last layer with 
confidence no matter what you get.  After that feels fairly 
comfortable, then move on to some more last layer algorithms.  

Alternatively, if you&#x27;re comfortable with how you&#x27;re doing the last 
layer [assuming you do it that way], there&#x27;s been a lot of talk here 
lately about the first 2 layers [F2L] and there&#x27;s a lot of great 
tips on that out there.

good luck, and welcome.  I&#x27;d say the cube gets more fun the faster 
you get, and definitely a way to wow your friends [unless they&#x27;re 
already in here], so it&#x27;s worth putting in some time practicing.
best, 
Kirk

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve actively used this alg for about 5yrs now. Just checked LarsP&#x27;s 
site, thought it might already have a name or something but guess 
not.

The one that doesn&#x27;t touch edge perm I can average 2.20s on. Just 
took 22.04 for 10 executions.

I preform it like this: LL on F, oriented corner on UFR

(RU&#x27;)F2(UR&#x27;U&#x27;R)F2(R&#x27;U)

In full detail:
(RU&#x27;)
F2[with right thumb downward twice]
(UR&#x27;U&#x27;R)[start with right index; both R&#x27;,R done with right thumb 
passively resting, U&#x27; done wiht left index]
(F2)[same way]
(R&#x27;U)[quick flick]

Somewhere during the middle of this alg I do a rapid flick of my 
left wrist to guide the turns and angle the grip temporarily. It&#x27;s 
truly a feelgood alg! :)

Back from NY and there are a bit over 100 posts to catch up on....

Yes, I am. I don&#x27;t like to steal your opportunity to find a solution 
yourself and feel good, successful and satisfied with yourself. That&#x27;s 
why I always try to just give minimal hints, not a solution.

Do you understand *why* that algorithm works? If you do, I&#x27;m sure you 
could&#x27;ve found a solution to the 5x5 case yourself as well. Now try to 
find a different one than David gave you, more similar to your 4x4 alg 
:-)

Hi!

thnak you for this welcome :-)
and you&#x27;re right that it is veryvery much that&#x27;s coming at me now, 
esspecially the terms. I have my cube not here (that&#x27;s a bad thing, 
isn&#x27;t it? :-P) but when i see it again i will give it a big hug and 
then will try this method!

kiss!

mmhh.. maybe.. maybe not.. I was not that slow :-)

When I have a bad day (neurons not working together, acting like 
brakes), slowing down helps preventing disasters or bad times, I 
agree.
But when I feel great, I don&#x27;t have to take care about solving 
slowly, because turn speed is automatically regulated, driven by the 
anticipation possibilities.

I often heard people telling you have to slow down if you want to be 
consistent, but it never really worked for me, when I was a beginner 
or now.
What about you?

Hi gilles !

I think going slow down can help you to anticipate pieces, 
particulary for F2L but I think it&#x27;s for cubers who want to be sub 20 
and reach 17&#x27;. But when you reach 15&#x27; or 14&#x27; you&#x27;ll definitivly be 
very fast !!

&gt; Hey everyone,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; So yeah, I&#x27;m a self admitted calendar cube addict.  I use my calendar<br>
&gt; cube everyday, and always change it with the day :-D  It actually is a<br>
&gt; lot of fun!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I thought of an interesting challenge for it.  Trying to minimize the<br>
&gt; number of turns required to change each day (average for each month).<br>
&gt;  You can take longer to solve the next day and also do some moves to<br>
&gt; prepare the day after that, but then again you can&#x27;t do too much since<br>
&gt; you have to solve today in as few moves as possible.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I also wonder if there is a distinct cube configuration for the<br>
&gt; beginning of each month such that every time you solve a day, the next<br>
&gt; day is setup very easily.  It seems with some thought you could plan<br>
&gt; out this entire solution and just setup the cube that way at the<br>
&gt; beginning of each month with a regular Fridrich solve.  So the first<br>
&gt; day of that month is say 50-55 moves (or you could FMC the solution on<br>
&gt; a regular cube and get it in even less) then each day after that is<br>
&gt; maybe 5 or so.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Not sure which the best way would be, but it&#x27;s fun to try to turn<br>
&gt; something that seems at first to be simple into a more complicated <br>
&gt; puzzle.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Does anyone else use the calendar cube, or try to minimize the moves<br>
&gt; required for each day change?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve always had trouble going slowly on the F2L or steps 1 and 2 of your method.  Even if I try to go slowly on purpose, or cube quietly, it doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve just trained myself to see the pieces at the slightly faster speed, and it&#x27;s helped my F2L times a bunch.  When I see the pieces, even while going quickly, my times are very good.

With a good F2L, I can manage sub-20, no matter how difficult my last layer is.  For most solves, I use F2L, orient edges, orient corners, PLL.  However, there are 4 PLL cases I&#x27;ve never bothered to learn.  The cases which cycle 3 edges and 3 corners each I do in two steps.  Even so, because of good F2L&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve gotten several 18.xx&#x27;s on these cases.

I read about all of these people averaging 45+ on the groups who already know all of the OLL&#x27;s and PLL&#x27;s.  It seems like a waste of effort to me.  The F2L is really where to get faster, at least initially.  And I don&#x27;t think anyone needs necessarily to go slowly, just learn to recognize pieces at your comfortable speed.

          <div class="email-content">Ok.. Now people are giving their opinions about going slow or fast 
during F2L. Of course, speed is the ultimate goal, but you can&#x27;t 
reach that goal by telling a newbie to try to go as fast as 
possible. In that case, it will be counter productive. I&#x27;d like to 
quote my site on this subject:

----------QUOTE------------

Speedcubing videos might give you the impression that speedcubing is 
all about speed. But that&#x27;s not true. In my opinion, speedcubing is 
all about finding a balance between fluency and speed. You should 
not focus on speed to much. It&#x27;s more important to work on your 
technique. The speed will come naturally. When I am having a bad 
cubing day, one of the things that helps me to get better times is 
telling myself to slow down. The idea is not to solve the cube at 
full speed (especially the F2L), but to go a little slower instead. 
This will enable you to watch the pieces, and it gives you time to 
look ahead. When you are solving a &#x27;sub-problem&#x27;, you can try to 
figure out what your next step is going to be. For people that use 
Fridrich, this means that when you are inserting a corner edge pair, 
you should have already spotted the next pair. Also, after finishing 
the cross, you should at least have a general idea about where your 
first corner edge pair is. The goal of looking ahead this way is 
that you can solve the cube without, or with only very small delays 
between algorithms.

If you don&#x27;t believe me, just time yourself, while aiming at your 
normal average plus 5 or 10 seconds (this will probably work for 
most people who average around 17-30 seconds). You will see it&#x27;s not 
that hard to do that. Do about 10 of those very slow solves, and try 
to look ahead while doing this. Now, slowly accelerate to your 
normal times. I hope you&#x27;ll find that rushing through a solve like a 
mad man it completely unnecessary, and that you can have the same 
(or even better) results by slowing down just a little bit.

One last thing: It&#x27;s a good idea to solve the last layer at full 
speeds, because when solving the Last Layer, it&#x27;s almost impossible 
to look ahead. It&#x27;s also a good idea to practice solving all 
different steps at full speed, because you should be able to do them 
without thinking. Of course, I am not telling you to go slow, just 
go as fast as you can without making mistakes, and without big 
delays between algorithms.

effort to me.  The F2L is really where to get faster, at least 
initially.  And I don&#x27;t think anyone needs necessarily to go slowly, 
just learn to recognize pieces at your comfortable speed.

          <div class="email-content">&quot;It&#x27;s all about F2L.&quot;  - Shotaro Makisumi

Really, all cubers should learn F2L first in my opinion.  The reason is  
that OLL and PLL algorithms don&#x27;t take time to &quot;master&quot;.  There&#x27;s not  
nearly as much finesse and decision making in the LL as there is in the  
F2L.  The LL is all about just execution of the algorithm, and to a  
smaller extent, recognizing which case it is.

In the F2L, you have to deal with execution, but also being able to  
find the next pair.  Also, sometimes knowing to do one pair first will  
set you up nicely for the next pair, or sometimes you&#x27;ll know that for  
a certain algorithm if the 3 of the last layer edges are yellow, then  
you can get all the edges oriented, just things like that.  Learn the  
F2L.

Remember, there&#x27;s no way to average sub-20 if your F2L takes 18  
seconds.  Focus on getting F2L down because that&#x27;s really what accounts  
for your times.

          <div class="email-content">I also use F2L, orient edges, orient corners, PLL. And I also use a
combination of two PLL algs for the PLL cases which cycle 3 edges and
3 corners. Actually, only for 2 of the 4, I have learnt the alg +
mirror for one of the pairs. I think of these four PLL cases as two
pairs of cases.

Anyway, my point in saying this is that this makes me feel really
slow! ;) I use pretty much the same method as Mike and I average
~36-37 seconds. I&#x27;ve never done a sub-20s solve and I only
occasionally get sub-30s times!

I feel like I must be missing something fundamental. All the 3-LL
solvers are faster than me!! Even on what felt like my most perfectly
executed non-lucky solve, it was 23s. I just can&#x27;t imagine ever
getting sub-20s!!

I&#x27;ve been on this group for several years now, so I think I&#x27;ve read
just about every tip that anyone&#x27;s ever offered, so in theory I know
how I should be able to get faster, but I&#x27;m just not there. Maybe I
just don&#x27;t practice enough??

Having said all this, I guess I should keep in mind that my average
was well over a minute when I first joined this group, so I have made
*some* progress. :)

initially.  And I don&#x27;t think anyone needs necessarily to go slowly,
just learn to recognize pieces at your comfortable speed.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

There&#x27;s no need to take apart a puzzle in order to lube it. I bet as 
good as 100% of all sprays these days come with a narrow long tube 
for spraying. If so u only need a little gap (which u make easily) 
to get the silicone inside. Spray into the puzzle from various 
locations around the cube. Then work it in by playing about with the 
cube a little. If it&#x27;s first time u lube it u can repeat this a few 
times more. After working it in for the last time u can leave the 
puzzle couple of hrs before testing it again. (U might need a tissue 
to wipe off silicone on the outside of the puzzle.)

But actually i recommend for the rubiks.com 5x5x5 that u wait quite 
a while before lubing it first time. It will &quot;wear down&quot; faster i 
guess without the lube inside. I normally wait at least a few weeks 
before lubing those 5x5x5 cubes. With eastsheen (mini) cubes u can 
lube straight away. But only a very little amount will be needed. I 
recommend never to take apart those eastsheen cubes. They become 
loose easily. 

The only real good reason to take apart rubiks.com 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 
is to check cubies for irregularities that u can remove with a sharp 
knife or other sharp tool. 

Good luck :-)

I don&#x27;t know about that - I hardly cube at all but after I saw your message I did 
a bit of cubing. I got a 47 and a 27 and some 30s. 47 was worse than useless, 
27 was pretty good but lucky (amazingly I didn&#x27;t have to PLL which happens 
maybe once in a year so that&#x27;s me done for 2005). I&#x27;d have to say it was 
generally well below that level for which I might have hoped.
I found that some of the strings in my mind like LU2F&#x27;L&#x27;U&#x27;LUF2U2F&#x27;L&#x27; didn&#x27;t 
come to mind too easily either and RU2R2FRF&#x27;U2R&#x27;FRF&#x27; (in fact, I think I 
might have had that in the 47s one and I was thinking FR&#x27;F&#x27; and having to 
undo it. My fingers tripped over each other a lot too.
I did get a 30 a bit later which was the best non-lucky time but I don&#x27;t know 
about that abstinence resulting in faster times hypothesis. I&#x27;m sure once a 
long time ago I could have hit 29s or maybe even 28s at least once and may 
have got into the 32-34s with some regularity.

I&#x27;m envious.

My parents hate my cubes. My ex-girlfriend hates them, in fact she was 
jealous of them. My friends look angry at me when I even mention 
cubes. Once someone mentioned a different kind of cube and a friend of 
mine immediately looked strange at me, fearing I&#x27;d start talking about 
cubes (I didn&#x27;t even intend to...).

I&#x27;m envious.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been really doing some thinking about my F2L lately, and came up<br>
with a cool new technique that I really like, and that I think has<br>
very general applications.<br>
<br>
Obviously for ZBF2L I really have to focus on the LL edges while<br>
solving the 4th pair, but I find it to be very hard to be thrust into<br>
this F2L case + LL edges case right after the 3rd pair.<br>
<br>
So what I&#x27;ve started doing is to mentally focus only on the LL edges<br>
while solving F2L.  This is kinda cool, since it means I have an idea<br>
the whole time what the LL edges are doing, sometimes I get most of<br>
them oriented for one pair, only to flip them later, etc..  I&#x27;m<br>
starting to get a feel for which F2L algs flip the LL edges a lot, and<br>
which ones are more preserving.<br>
<br>
Anyway this makes the F2L itself a little easier.  I know that sounds<br>
weird, but since you are mentally focusing on your LL color only, the<br>
F2L pieces really stand out as &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;weird&quot; since they don&#x27;t<br>
have the LL color.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s weird, but my F2L is actually pretty smooth this way, plus the<br>
transition from 3rd pair to 4th pair ZBF2L is easier since I have been<br>
thinking about the LL edges the whole time and am not suddenly thrust<br>
into this hard case.<br>
<br>
So anyway I don&#x27;t know if anyone has ever tried F2L while focusing on<br>
LL edges, it&#x27;s sort of an inverted way of thinking, but it really<br>
makes the F2L pieces stand out.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to post, it seems to be helping me specifically for ZBF2L,<br>
but I also am getting some nice standard F2L solves when I try it.<br>
<br>
Try it and see what you think!<br>

Many years ago i teached it to my little brother, but then in my own 
terms, so he could understand it. there were whole stories in in, like 
travelling around the world and sneaking back in through the backdoor 
and so on... and now i still do it myself with this stories in my 
imagination :)

but i will learn your terms, then i can understand what the conversaton 
here is about.. çause till now it&#x27;s still very confusing... :-S

          <div class="email-content">I am a 3-look LL solver too, I average around 32s - and I agree it&#x27;s  
all about the F2L. I am constantly trying to make mine faster.  
Anyway, another good thing that might help is to time each part of  
your solution, ie cross, finishing F2L, edges, corners, PLL. When I  
was averaging in the 40&#x27;s, it helped me realize my cross should be  
faster, and I worked on that a little bit more.


As far as F2L goes, I still haven&#x27;t seen how slowing down helps but  
there are other things to look at such as using empty slots,  
inserting pairs from any angle, finding the next pair before the one  
youre working on is finished, etc

I&#x27;m sure if you work at it you can get your average down to around  
30s rather quickly, cuz I&#x27;ve only been cubing for 5-6 months - and  
you seem to have more experience :)

          <div class="email-content">I think that square-1 still has a long way to go until we approach an <br>
optimal solution.  But this does look to me like it might be able to <br>
contend (I don&#x27;t know what Lars V&#x27;s method is, though.)<br>
<br>
&gt; 1.  Cube Shape<br>
<br>
Obviously, the best way to do this step is to memorize how to solve <br>
from any shape, but I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re going to do about this.  <br>
I only know two good methods for returning to a cube.  One is to <br>
gather 6 corners on one side, then you only have about 5 or 6 cases <br>
to memorize.  The other is to gather exactly 4 corners on the top <br>
side.  This leaves 4 edges on the top and the same on the bottom.  <br>
Limits the number of cases you have to know.<br>
 <br>
&gt; 2.  Solve D corners (forcing U-D corner seperation)<br>
<br>
Both getting corners on their right layer and permuting them take <br>
very few twists, so this should be fast.<br>
<br>
&gt; 3.  Seperate Edges+Permute U corners <br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure what the actual move counts would be for this, but it <br>
seems like it would be more efficient to solve all corners at once.  <br>
50%, I think, of the time you can do it with 3 twists.  <br>
<br>
&gt; 4. Permute edges<br>
<br>
Lots of cases for this, but I think it could get pretty fast.  I&#x27;m <br>
wondering what you plan to do about parity?  Doubles the number of <br>
algorithms if you include algorithms for all parities.  But pushes <br>
the time way up if you don&#x27;t.<br>
 <br>
&gt; From what I can tell, this method has a manageable number of cases <br>
&gt; if learned completely.  I estimate possible average for this at <br>
&gt; sub20.  Let me know what you think.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m actually planning my own square-1 method right now.  Mine would <br>
go like this:<br>
<br>
1. Cube shape.<br>
<br>
Either learning all cases or using one of the methods I described <br>
above.<br>
<br>
2. Get colors on the correct layers<br>
<br>
Initially I may split this up into corners then edges (that&#x27;s what i <br>
do right now).  I&#x27;m thinking (I haven&#x27;t looked into it seriously, <br>
but) probably less than 30 algorithms for this step when combined.<br>
<br>
3. Solve corners.<br>
<br>
Really easy step.  Only about 8 algorithms for this.  And like I said <br>
above, half the time, it&#x27;s really really fast.<br>
<br>
4. Solve edges.<br>
<br>
Maybe someday, all in one step, but initially, find the fastest edge <br>
parity swap and use it when there is a parity issue.  Since there are <br>
algorithms for all the even parity cases, this should add very little <br>
time.  I don&#x27;t know how many cases there would be, but I think if we <br>
add parity into the algorithms, this may be comparable to the LL on <br>
the 3-cube.<br>
<br>
Sorry about the long post.  I have strong opinions about speedsolving <br>
the square-1.  I think if I knew as many algorithms for square1 as I <br>
did for the cube, I&#x27;d be faster than Lars.  I am glad to see that <br>
lately, a lot more people are learning the square-1 and pushing the <br>
limits, hopefully past what has been done by Lars.<br>
<br>
By the way, I think we need to get some three letter acronyms for <br>
these steps like they have for the cube.  (PLL, CLL, F2L, etc...)<br>

          <div class="email-content">*4x4 cubes
Non-Cuber, After playing around with the 4x4, and then comparing it 
and the 3x3 side by side: Woah, wait a minute, that one is bigger 
than the other one.
Cuber: 

Non-Cuber: The Rubik&#x27;s Cube has 54 pices. Duh! Everybody knows that!
Cuber: The cube is made up out of 8 corner pices, 12 edge pices, and 
one &quot;central structure&quot;.

Non-cuber: I sort of solve one side at a time.
Cuber: I first use the petrus method for the F2L, followed by OLL, 
and then PLL.

RUBIKLUB doesn&#x27;t exist anymore because of yahoo-france .

That&#x27;s why I just created RUBIKLUB-2 in order to try to find the 740 lost
members and continue rubikubing in French :-) 

=> Please could you update your links from rubiklub to RUBIKLUB-2 at:

  &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rubiklub-2/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rubiklub-2/ 

(no more hosted by the :&#x27;%&amp;$*() yahoo-france of course :-) 

=> Could you also forward this email all around you (and other groups)  in
order to reach the 740 members losts because of yahoo-france 

Thanks,

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve wondered about this since starting partial edge control a while ago.  Recently, I&#x27;ve taken to using COLL as often as possible, so having properly oriented edges when I get to the LL helps quite a bit.  It&#x27;s often the difference between sub-20 and not sub-20 for me.<br>
<br>
Lately, I&#x27;ve been focusing on the LL edge pieces during the entire F2L, preserving them when possible, but generally keeping an eye on them.  At very least, it helps me to know how many and which I&#x27;ll need to flip come 4th corner/edge pair or beginning of LL.  Generally, I don&#x27;t know very many alternate algorithms for edge preserving, but it still helps to know where I&#x27;ll end up a bit earlier.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, in the relatively near future, I&#x27;ll learn the rest of the case 2 for the ZBF2L algs you&#x27;ve compiled.  That ought to help me out immensely.  We&#x27;ll soon see.<br>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] New F2L idea/approach (well, maybe new)<br>
<br>
<br>
  Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
  I&#x27;ve been really doing some thinking about my F2L lately, and came up<br>
  with a cool new technique that I really like, and that I think has<br>
  very general applications.<br>
<br>
  Obviously for ZBF2L I really have to focus on the LL edges while<br>
  solving the 4th pair, but I find it to be very hard to be thrust into<br>
  this F2L case + LL edges case right after the 3rd pair.<br>
<br>
  So what I&#x27;ve started doing is to mentally focus only on the LL edges<br>
  while solving F2L.  This is kinda cool, since it means I have an idea<br>
  the whole time what the LL edges are doing, sometimes I get most of<br>
  them oriented for one pair, only to flip them later, etc..  I&#x27;m<br>
  starting to get a feel for which F2L algs flip the LL edges a lot, and<br>
  which ones are more preserving.<br>
<br>
  Anyway this makes the F2L itself a little easier.  I know that sounds<br>
  weird, but since you are mentally focusing on your LL color only, the<br>
  F2L pieces really stand out as &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;weird&quot; since they don&#x27;t<br>
  have the LL color.<br>
<br>
  It&#x27;s weird, but my F2L is actually pretty smooth this way, plus the<br>
  transition from 3rd pair to 4th pair ZBF2L is easier since I have been<br>
  thinking about the LL edges the whole time and am not suddenly thrust<br>
  into this hard case.<br>
<br>
  So anyway I don&#x27;t know if anyone has ever tried F2L while focusing on<br>
  LL edges, it&#x27;s sort of an inverted way of thinking, but it really<br>
  makes the F2L pieces stand out.<br>
<br>
  Just wanted to post, it seems to be helping me specifically for ZBF2L,<br>
  but I also am getting some nice standard F2L solves when I try it.<br>
<br>
  Try it and see what you think!<br>

          <div class="email-content">nice guys.

its cool to think of solving the bottom first so that
your eyes are on the top layer when you finally
permute.

as for me im doing the opposite lol i solve the top
first.

1.top corners.

2. top edges

3. permute everything at once on the bottom / fix odd
parity if needed.

my best time for the square-1 is 20.81 sec. done at
the orange county fair. i guess it was kinda lucky the
top layer was done pretty quick :-D

mostly i range in the 40s

For the corners, I teach them how to solve four on a side intuitively, and then one corner permuter and the Sune/antisune.  Then I teach them simple commutators to solve the pieces on one side, followed by two different 3 cycles and some edge flippers to orient.  It&#x27;s probably 7 easy algorithms total.  Takes a couple of hours, though.

For people who can see edges easier, I teach them how to solve the cross on top, generally using the &#x27;put the piece directly below where it needs to be&#x27; approach.  Two cases.  Then come the U layer corners.  Three cases.  Then I teach them how to solve middle layer edges (cross side is now on bottom).  Two algorithms that are very simple and only a single &#x27; different.  Then comes working corners, if they are doing well.  This is followed by two cases for edge orienting.  Then comes the corner permuter, same as above.  Next is the Sune/antisune.  Then, I teach a simple 3 cycle and its reverse.

Including working corners, I taught the latter method to someone in just over an hour, and she was watching a movie at the time.  She has since moved on to a 3 look LL and the F2L, and averages under 30, with very little effort.

I&#x27;ve also taught it to a couple of people that have taken several hour or longer sessions and are still very beginner.  It all depends on the student and how much they want to improve.

          <div class="email-content">Wow, good memory.

Hem, since not many people like it, it would go under your Step 5+6 
list, I seem to have the fastest execution of it, and have been 
using it for so long... maybe you can name it the &quot;Doug&quot; after me :) 
on your site.

I&#x27;ve really grown a liking to your naming scheme. This week I 
started calling the &quot;Buffy&quot; by that name.

I take a bit longer on the mirror (not sure why, but I never do the 
inverse), and do it like this:
L&#x27;UF2U&#x27;LUL&#x27;F2LU&#x27;, the L&#x27;s I do with my left hand (lots of supporting 
fingers), U with right index, U&#x27; with right thumb, and F2 with right 
thumb downward twice. Nowhere is there a genuine trigger, each move 
is pretty much individual, so it&#x27;s suprising how I can still be 
fairly fast with it. Though in actuality I might be using r and r&#x27; 
instead of the L turns... hard to tell, depends on my mood.

I just tried the inverse a few times (of the original) and I really 
like it, I think I can go much faster with it than this mirror I 
just listed. It solves the same case.

Looks like it&#x27;s time to change a 5yr old habit and covert... come to 
think of it, the only reason I can do the trigger-less mirror (I&#x27;m 
not as dexterous with my Left hand as most cubers out there) so fast 
is probably only due to necessity over the yrs.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

This is a bit like how I think for the F2L. When working on F2L pairs,
my focus is actually on looking for pieces that don&#x27;t have yellow
(yellow is always my LL face). I find this much easier than trying to
focus on five different F2L colours. It also makes it less difficult
switching between a White/Yellow cube (my usual colour scheme) and a
White/Blue cube. If someone hands me a White/Blue cube, then during
the F2L I just think to myself &#x27;focus on non-blue&#x27;.

What I&#x27;m not doing, which you have obviously started to do, is pay
attention to what is actually happening to the LL edges during the
F2L. I might try giving this a go sometimes, although I imagine you&#x27;d
only get the full benefit of it if learning ZB or VH, both of which
are too advanced for me at the moment!! :)

Let me combine it with the other thread:

Noncuber: He&#x27;s cheating!
Cuber: Congratulations!

If you add a co-worker scrambling it would only change to:

Noncuber: They&#x27;re cheating!
Cuber: Please don&#x27;t show me the boring scrambling.

Cheers!
Stefan

I just did an attempt with Kyle, a friend of mine, scrambling, but I 
was a 3-corner cycle off.  Dang it.

I&#x27;d be surprised if anyone has done the 9x9x9 cube in under 2 minutes 
as was stated in that thread.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m curious how much work it would take to learn a few simple algs that help with corner positioning.  I managed to insert my final edge pair on a solve last night in such a way that it correctly oriented my corners, and I did it on purpose.  It was entirely accidental that it happened to permute them correctly, too.  But getting the Z perm after a fantastic F2L+LL edges just felt great.  The fact that it was a 16.45 didn&#x27;t hurt, either.

If anyone knows more about this, please let me know.  It&#x27;s something I&#x27;d like to look into.

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: New F2L idea/approach (well, maybe new)


  Hi Chris,

  This is a bit like how I think for the F2L. When working on F2L pairs,
  my focus is actually on looking for pieces that don&#x27;t have yellow
  (yellow is always my LL face). I find this much easier than trying to
  focus on five different F2L colours. It also makes it less difficult
  switching between a White/Yellow cube (my usual colour scheme) and a
  White/Blue cube. If someone hands me a White/Blue cube, then during
  the F2L I just think to myself &#x27;focus on non-blue&#x27;.

  What I&#x27;m not doing, which you have obviously started to do, is pay
  attention to what is actually happening to the LL edges during the
  F2L. I might try giving this a go sometimes, although I imagine you&#x27;d
  only get the full benefit of it if learning ZB or VH, both of which
  are too advanced for me at the moment!! :)

That must feel pretty good. I wish I could do something so well that 
I convince the mass population it has to be phony because it appears 
impossible. Congratulations, that feat is almost as impressive as 
the blindfold solve itself.

Put bag over your head with a drawstring closure?

Why not use something like an opaque sneeze guard? Solve it on the
other side of a door hanging sideways in front to you? Sit normally at
a desk, put your head on top of the desk and solve it between your legs.

Solve it inside a tube, like a paper bag with no bottom. Camera on you
and down the tube. Hmmm...cube tubing.

Turn the lights off and videotape it in the dark in infrared. A Sony
handycam with night shot can do that.

Quite impressive but I only see 3 sides of the cube solved (could be unsolved edges in the 
unseen side - I&#x27;d be really impressed if you turned it over so we could see the other solved 
sides!

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s all well and good, I was able to figure that much the first 
try. It seemed that after an hr on it I had only placed one number 
(the 6). But I eventrually got two boxes/regions.

But then I got to the following point and haven&#x27;t been able to 
proceed for over a week.

. 2 6 * . . 7 * . . 8
8 9 5 * 6 2 . * . 7 3
. 7 4 * . 8 . * . . .
* * * * * * * * * * *
4 5 7 * 1 9 3 * 8 6 2
9 8 3 * 2 4 6 * 5 1 7
6 1 2 * 5 7 8 * . . 4
* * * * * * * * * * *
2 . 9 * . 1 . * 7 8 .
5 4 8 * 7 . 9 * . . .
7 . 1 * 8 . 2 * . 4 .

Kinda wierd one can still get stuck after getting two boxes, one 
column, and two rows...

Well I&#x27;ve been staring at this for a rather long time. I do know 
that (3,7) is one of 1,2,6,9; that (3,8) is one of 2,5,9; and that 
(3,9) is one of 1,6,9. (1,7) can be one of 1,4,9. Well anyways I&#x27;m 
lost. Also I&#x27;m what is known as a &quot;logical-purist&quot; so I won&#x27;t be 
satisfied with trial-error and stuff like that... (though in my math 
classes I do proof-by-contratdicton all the time).

Well I found the solution using trial/error, but I&#x27;m very much 
displeased by it, since I was able to convince myself of uniqueness 
in addition to existance, there much be a better way.

Probably a method I don&#x27;t know about. I started tring out ways of 
symutaneously placing all of a certain number. I noted that 5 had 
two different possiblities (placing one (in 1 of 2 spots in a 
row/col/box) would place force all others).

That&#x27;s a great quote! I need to put it on a huge banner in my new 
apartment, and get a shirt or mug with it on. It one of those things 
only uber geeks would understand :).

I&#x27;ve been learning so much ZBLL, specialized CLL, doing ELLs from 
different angles... I&#x27;ve neglected F2L too much.

All the ZBLL I know is so useless without a good number of ZBF2L to 
support them. My times have grown increasingly inconsistant once 
again. I switched to a 25th anniversary cube about a month ago and 
notcied that my standard deviation dropped like a rock (to like 1.5), 
my mean dropped slightly too. But with the special cases I&#x27;ve started 
actively using my SD has risen again. A few days ago I got a 10.32 
solve and these sub-15s are becomming more frequent. However I now get 
a bunch of >30s solves as well. I take a long time during 
recognition... there&#x27;s a lot to see between steps. Dispite having 
plenty of experience doing COLL recognition... Recalling those ZBF2L 
cases is pretty painful and gives at least a 2s pause.

>From my best RA of 22.16 this summer, my times avarage 25s again. But 
I&#x27;m not particularly sad about it. I really enjoy taking these weeks 
to (re)learn F2L.

A few of my algs have changed too. I caught a new COLL alg from BobB, 
and I&#x27;m getting an all time high on the percentage of getting good LL 
edges. It&#x27;s kinda cool how my internal alg set/repitoure changes a 
little bit every week (when I&#x27;m active), swapped out three COLL algs 
this week. And even this slight change requires a lot of effort to 
practice for me.

I think I fear change too much. I keep piling on more algs. This is 
bad... Lots of my previous algs need to be re-examined FIRST. I used 
to think this was hard to do, but I heard ppl like DanH saying they 
change algs they don&#x27;t like all the time.

With 100% on ZBF2L, the chances of an OLL skip is 1/27... for the COLL 
to solve it is 1/12. I like those odds :).

Yes, I can do that, too, but... well...

I have recorded a truly marvelous video of it that the margin of my

I&#x27;m sure Joel means separation (i.e. bring to the correct layer).<br>
<br>
As for recognising parity, it is not practical to try to recognise it <br>

when you get to the cube shape.<br>

Well if you know for each shape not only how to bring it to cube shape 
but also where each piece belongs (in the scrambled state, so that 
when you make the cube, the puzzle is completely solved), then you 
could see it right away. And you have 15 seconds preinspection, that 
could be enough for following 16 pieces :-) And you could know two 
ways for each shape to make it into a cube, one for each parity 
situation, so that you make the cube and fix parity at the same time.

Another negative aspect though is that you&#x27;d probably want to preserve 
the parity until the end, which would mean the algorithms you use for 
the other steps might become longer (though I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if 
most optimal algorithms preserve parity).

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, it&#x27;s cool being a girl. Much more variety when it comes to
fashion and accessories! :)

I saw a sparkly Rubik&#x27;s Cube necklace in a trendy store a few months
ago. I was going to buy it until I found out how much it cost  80
pounds!! This is ~$USD140!! Then I looked closer and saw that it was
basically just a keychain cube with fake gems stuck to it. What a rip-off.

BTW, Doug did you just make up that thing about the fingernails? If
so, that&#x27;s a huge coincidence because I said the same thing in an
interview the other day. I have actually done this before, but it was
a long long time ago.

          <div class="email-content">Wait is this right?  So by the expansion the term is 16007560800*x^7 
which is what I set it up as the number of distinct opening draws from
the bag of 100 tiles.

So this would count eeeeeez as the same draw as zeeeeee and eezeee.

Also this doesn&#x27;t acount for the ordering of the tiles on your rack,
it&#x27;s just the number of groupings of tiles out of the bag.

Is this right?

said that during the interview and was expecting I&#x27;d have to make an

I do like the Magic, I even bought two last year (Harry Potter +

puzzle that popped in my head was the Magic!

          <div class="email-content">Hi!<br>
<br>
I just tried to upload a file about 2.3 MB. And i got message there is <br>
not enough space. Since there already is a file uploaded almost 5MB i <br>
reckon this is total allocated space for files. Or in worst case it&#x27;s <br>
the total space for all the files, photos, messages and so on of the <br>
group. Im not sure ... :-(<br>
<br>
Should we do some cleaning in the files and photos sections. Or maybe <br>
move to some other site ??<br>
<br>
Cheers :-)<br>

Well, sure. I mean, we have &quot;electric paper&quot; or whatever they call it 
already today! You know, those displays as thin as paper. If I put 
that into the Magic, then...

What&#x27;s the minimum number of stickers that need to be repositioned in order to change from a Japanese color scheme (blue across from white) to a Rubiks.com (BOY) color scheme (blue across from green)?  The best I can do is 11.  What&#x27;s optimal?  Thanks.<br>

Are you serious? Of coarse I would! I would need a lift from the

I average sub-1.5 for this algorithm and can achieve sub-1.3 on
perfect execution. :-)  Watch the videos to see exactly how I perform
it. ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Ok to vent some frustration....

I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good deal all day... spent the last 3hrs on 
various sites. Oh how I wish you could pick the hotel first then 
attach a flight (instead of flight then hotel). Ahhhh.... I want to 
scream.

I need to find something from Detroit to Dallas staying at Hearthside 
Suites from the 11th till the 14th (preferably an evening flight back) 
with no limit of connectors (though a layover in Omaha would be 
amazing).

I need phone numbers (or just Tyson&#x27;s cell) too in case I need help: 
need a ride, or get lost...

Some of the deals I select don&#x27;t even have Hearthside as an option... 
are the differnt airports in Dallas located very far from each other? 
Which is Hearthside closest to?

Man I&#x27;d just google and find out all this stuff myself and had been 
done with it if I wasn&#x27;t so lazy... or if I wasn&#x27;t on dial-up this 
week. On broadband and a fast computer I tend to book flihgts by 
opening upwards of 30 browser windows... lol.

I mean I could chance it and try for a last minute deal... :).

Ok it&#x27;s 5:15AM, I&#x27;m going to keep looking.

The concensus seesm to be at $439 on all these sites... but I know I 
can find something under $400... oh dear god please! Last minute deals 
with hotel can even dip below $275...

How about those cubers with cars help out with shuttle service from 
the hotel to the venue??? Or maybe even airport, that&#x27;d be marvelous!

I keep asking myself... &quot;Do I really need to come???&quot; Thus I&#x27;m 
probably going to chance it last minute... I can&#x27;t really do much with 
my current finances.

p.s. I&#x27;m taking partial credit for convincing Hunt to come.

I use basically the same alg as you, Bob, except I do U&#x27; for the
second and second last moves and I execute it differently (and not as
fast as you!). I don&#x27;t use my left hand fingers for the M2 moves, and
I have my right thumb on the FRU cubie and use it to flick the U&#x27; and
U2 moves.

Ha ha, it&#x27;s true!

I was able to get the best price from expedia. When I was using
travelocity, I couldn&#x27;t find the hotel in the hotel list. It would not
list all hotels in the area when booking by flight. It&#x27;s easy on
expedia. Just pick the flight and then sort the hotels by price,
Hearthside is like the second one down.

That&#x27;s actually one of my better cases :). I do it like this:

(R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27;) x2 y&#x27; (R&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27;)(l R U&#x27;)(R&#x27; U R U) 

But when I first learned this algorithms, I did the cube rotation the 
wrong way.. There is a nice way to &#x27;combine&#x27; that x2 y&#x27; with the 
surrounding moves. This is well illustrated on this movie:&quot;

http://www.planet-puzzle.com/pll_video/n9.html

(Only Katsu does the last few moves slightly different, it shows the 
cube rotation.

LarsV also has a different algorithm that&#x27;s not used by a lot of 
cubers, see www.cubezone.be.

My worst case has to be (ULF URB) (UL UR).

Cyou

Joël.

          <div class="email-content">#16 used to be one of my least favourites because I hadn&#x27;t learnt a
PLL for it. I used a combination of 2 PLLs instead :/ A couple of
weeks ago at the UK speedcubers gathering, Duncan taught me an easy to
remember alg for this case: 

L U&#x27; R D2 R&#x27; U L&#x27; U2 L U&#x27; R D2 R&#x27; U L&#x27;

I find this easy to remember because it&#x27;s just the same sequence (L U&#x27;
R D2 R&#x27; U L&#x27;) repeated with a U2 in between.

I also quite like #11. :) I use the second alg list on Dan&#x27;s site for
this, although I hold the cube differently when I execute it.

G&#x27;day Jasmine!

This one was always awkward for me too but I picked a better alg from 
somewhere (can&#x27;t remember where now).
Try: L&#x27;U R U&#x27; L U L&#x27;U R&#x27;U&#x27; L U2 R U2 R&#x27;  and see what ya reckon. It 
sets up the case as well so just keep doin the same alg to set it up 
and to solve it. Hope that helps.

BTW, did ya get my last email?


Keith.

          <div class="email-content">That alg is heaps better than the one I&#x27;ve been using. I&#x27;m going to
re-learn that PLL case with that alg.

For (ULF URB) (UL UR) and the mirror I use:
L U&#x27; R d2 R&#x27; U L&#x27; U2 L U&#x27; R d2 R&#x27; U L&#x27; (+ the mirror alg)

Duncan also taught me this one. Actually, I think Duncan&#x27;s alg was a
little different, I just made a slight modification which made it
easier for me to remember.

happened.

The files section has 20 MB allocated and we are using 96% of that. 
So you can only upload about 800kb right now.

The photos section has 30MB allocated and we are using 82% of that so
only 5.14 MB remain.  This isn&#x27;t really that much of a problem, since
photos are usually small.

We can put the videos on a time limit, so the oldest videos will be
removed and then the space freed up until it fills up again, at which
point the oldest videos will be removed.

Since this is the first time this has happened I have no plan for what
to do.  So what do you guys suggest?

          <div class="email-content">We could start by moving the videos to the awesome collection on
www.strangepuzzle.com if Chris Hunt doesn&#x27;t mind. It&#x27;s kinda cool
having all the videos in one place.

Perhaps everyone should make an effort to go in and tidy up anything
they&#x27;ve added over the years? I&#x27;ve just moved the one pic that I added
several years ago!

We obviously don&#x27;t want to lose anything, but there&#x27;s no reason why
some of this stuff can&#x27;t be located elsewhere. Once upon a time we
used to put many more files/pics/vids on this group because we didn&#x27;t
all have websites of own own. Now that most people do have their own
sites, perhaps some of the stuff in the pics and files sections is
already stored elsewhere now?

I don&#x27;t mind at all :)

I can also add a file database so people can upload various different
files (puzzle related, of coarse).

If you think that a file database would be useful, then I just need to
know what kind of information we should store for each file:

-File Name
-Date Submitted
-Size
-Description
- ....

If not, then ok. I&#x27;m just offering it because I can. :)

with the one Joel posted. It&#x27;s just lovely. It was very easy to

I don&#x27;t know why I spent so long putting up with a slow awkward alg
for that case!!

No, I&#x27;m the one who&#x27;s retarded ;-) Sorry... that&#x27;ll teach me to check 
*every* alg with an applet before I post it. Anthony and Chris are 
right, the correct alg is:

R U&#x27; R&#x27; U l U F U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R U&#x27; R U R&#x27; F R&#x27;

I&#x27;m quite impressed Anthony was able to fix that l direction :-)

Cheers!

Thanks for pointing out Katsu&#x27;s videos! Though, to be honest, they 
make me sad ;-) Just yesterday I did the T-perm four times in a row on 
the stackmat in 6.81 seconds and I was quite happy with it, but now I 
watched Katsu apparently do it even much faster:

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Yes, you are supposed to have the choice between screw and rivets 
for attaching the centers to the core. I&#x27;m quiye sure 99% do prefer 
screws and not the rivets though. This is because it makes the cube 
tension adjustable :-)

Cut away that &quot;excess&quot; inner material from the centercaps so thay 
actually fit into the centers then you can sand down the edges of 
the caps as well since they tend to be a little too wide. Now you 
either glue the centercap along one edge only or use thin paper to 
make a better fit. If you use glue make sure you have already 
adjusted the cube to your liking. Not that it&#x27;s too hard to break 
the glue and reglue :-) The best glue to use is superglue. make sure 
it&#x27;s _real_ superglue w ONLY cyanoacrylat as its content. Get it in 
a plastic tube with a pipette. This glue is useful for repairing 
broken cubies also :-)

Cheers!

-Per

PS! All black diy-kits have arched centers yes. The white ones don&#x27;t 
have it. Most prefer black diy beacuse w the arched centers u hardly 
get any popping. However, without the arched centers the cube might 
lock a little less. The locking on my diy cube is negligible :-)

First of all, I think it is amazing what you already have achieved. I wish I had the spare time and guts to do this too.<br>

Even though you have the most experience with ZB (maybe???), I still think that you are too negative about ZB.<br>
Remember when you started F2L? It felt so awkward. Actually I have a 1981 book that describes the F2L technique, and in 1981 I made an annotation on that page: &quot;too hard to apply&quot;. My opinion has changed completely now. :-)<br>
What I am trying to say is that after looooooooots of practice ZB MUST be faster than basic CFOP. Fewer steps, fewer moves.<br>
Recognition and the huge number of algorithms are an issue now, but won&#x27;t be an issue when you have 3 years of practice at this.<br>
<br>
Anyway, keep up the good work. I like your ZB pages a lot.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Aaah I feel bad now, I don&#x27;t mean to sound negative about ZB at all! 
I really do still see myself spending the time learn all of ZBLL,
which I wouldn&#x27;t do unless I REALLY liked it :-)

I agree that maybe with a lot of practice, that ZB could potentially
be faster than CFOP (it doesn&#x27;t seem impossible).  However, after
seeing Sebastien and Jean on the 3x3 this seems like it would take a
lot of practice indeed (at the very least 3 years or so).  Maybe then
this strategy of using it as a &quot;first two rounds&quot; method is a way to
use it when you are in the intermediate stages of learning it?  I
think I will write something about that in my next entry.

I do feel bad though, I really, really, really like the idea of ZB
method (in fact that&#x27;s why I want to learn it so badly!) but I have
had some doubts lately about how fast it can get.  This could of
course be the fact that I have only used it for 6 months, which in the
context of ZB is really not very long.

I agree that perhaps this strategy would be a good idea for
&quot;intermediate/beginner&quot; ZB users such as myself rather than for an
expert (someone who knows all of it and has for at least a year).

Hopefully my opinion will change in 3 years!  I really hope it does,
but I guess for now this is the strategy I want to pursue!

Please don&#x27;t think I feel negatively about ZB, quite the opposite!  I
will try to be more careful with my wording in the future, please no
hard feelings!

          <div class="email-content">Exerpt from May 2, 2005: (I apoloize for the wording when comparing
ZBF2L to F2L, looking at it now I think it&#x27;s pretty harsh.  I just
mean to say that it was &quot;very easy&quot;).
------------------------------------------------------------
May 2, 2005:

18.95 18.42 15.12 16.07 17.60 (20.35) 17.00 15.82 17.09 (13.66) 16.22
16.94 = 16.92

This was my first pure Fridrich average since January 27, for almost
13 weeks. Recognizing the last F2L pair is pathetically easy after
being used to trying to recognize the ZBF2L case. I think I&#x27;ll use
ZBF2L as my method of practicing for May, but at the actual
competition I&#x27;ll honestly probably end up doing pure Fridrich. I can&#x27;t
wait until I know ZBF2L well enough to use it in competition. :-(
------------------------------------------------------------

Exerpt from May 7, 2005:
------------------------------------------------------------
May 7, 2005:
This next average was a mix of ZBF2L/COLL/PLL and F2L/OLL/PLL. I did 4
F2L/OLL/PLL solves, mostly near the end. I wanted to try to find a
good balance of Fridrich and ZBF2L that I might use at the New York
tournament. The 12.52 below was a ZBLL solve.

16.40 18.17 15.85 15.11 (12.52) 17.80 17.74 18.32 16.74 17.38 (19.65)
16.26 = 16.98
-------------------------------------------------------------


May 2nd shows that the transistion from ZB to Fridrich feels easy
(when I am still in practice with Fridrich, 13 weeks is not as much
time as 13 weeks plus basicaly 2 more months), and makes the steps
feel easy.

May 7th shows the spike times of ZBLL (the 12.52) and also that
Fridrich helped me to stay consistent with the average when I got
amnesia with ZBF2L.

Right now I&#x27;m fairly rusty with Fridrich, I amnesia OLL cases a lot,
and I&#x27;m at least 2-3 seconds slower on average than when I was
practicing all the time.

I hope with the 2 weeks of practice before Dallas that I can chip off
some of that rustiness, but I imagine not having worked on Fridrich
for a long time will really take its toll on my times.

That doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t think this will be a bad strategy.  Once
I&#x27;ve had time to practice both ZB _and_ Fridrich together (switching
between the two like I will in competition), I think it&#x27;s possible
that I&#x27;ll be able to repeat May 2, as well as use a combination of ZB
and Fridrich like on May 7 if I am screwing up with ZB in competition
(amnesia and the like).

P.S.  I can do a few averages and post them if you still want (ZB,
then Fridrich, done in that order) but I can almost guarantee that the
Fridrich will be nothing special, and perhaps slower than ZB since I
haven&#x27;t practiced Fridrich to the point of starting to amnesia OLL
cases.  Again, that entry was my theory for the future, once I&#x27;ve
practiced in that mindset for a while.  I don&#x27;t expect immediate
results with this at all.

It´s not necessary, if you think you are rusty with Fridrich it won´t
be so good to compare with anyway. And now i see that your zb-site is
longer then i first saw :)

<br>
Hey,<br>
<br>
in response to your question I went through and practiced my OLL cases<br>
to cover the ones I was amnesia&#x27;ing and then did a few warmup Fridrich<br>
averages.<br>
<br>
When I felt good I did a ZB average, followed immediately by a<br>
Fridrich average.<br>
<br>
First off I want to say that the two methods compliment eachother<br>
well.  The pacing for ZBF2L is much slower than F2L, since you have to<br>
track the LL edges, and for Fridrich is obviously much faster and more<br>
fluid.  So switching between the two helps me to try to apply some of<br>
the F2L pace of one to the other, speeding up ZBF2L a bit and making<br>
F2L nice and slowfast.<br>
<br>
Well here were the averages:<br>
<br>
ZB (every solve was ZBF2L / (21%ZBLL) or (COLL/PLL) :<br>
16.63, 17.73, 17.93, 16.00, 17.58, (15.54), 19.52, 18.90, 18.02,<br>
16.97, (21.40), 19.52 = 17.88<br>
<br>
followed immediately by Fridrich (every solve was F2L (with basic<br>
partial edge control / (OLL/PLL) or (1/7 COLL/PLL) :<br>
18.23, 17.86, 17.32, 15.56, 17.98, 14.55, (14.08), 15.49, 15.67,<br>
(20.02), 17.34, 17.26 = 16.73<br>
<br>
I did do COLL during the Fridrich average when it came up, but other<br>
than that I only did basic partial edge control (making sure to not<br>
end up with all flipped edges).<br>
<br>
16.73 beats my fastest ever offical rules average by 0.02 seconds! <br>
And I haven&#x27;t practiced Fridrich seriously since Horace Mann (2 months<br>
ago)!<br>
<br>
I am really set on using ZB as my &quot;first two rounds&quot; method and then<br>
Fridrich as my &quot;final round&quot; method.  If I do get to the point where I<br>
am consistently faster for ZB stuff than Fridrich, then I will of<br>
course try to use that for all rounds.<br>
<br>
These averages makes me really happy!  I think these methods<br>
compliment eachother well!  ZB solving makes me slow down and be<br>
slowfast for F2L when doing Fridrich.  Fridrich solving makes me try<br>
to speed up my ZBF2L pace a little bit.<br>
<br>
I can&#x27;t wait till I&#x27;ve had the time to practice and really get fluid<br>
with Fridrich again!<br>
<br>
I really do think ZB and Fridrich can be used together, and you can<br>
easily switch between the two without any interference or problems. <br>
In fact practicing one way seems to help me for the other way.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Lars,<br>
<br>
Yes, you are right.<br>
<br>
I think ZB is crazy and even a bit intimidating. :-)<br>
There will be guys learning this system. For me it is impossible to do that within 2.5 years: family, busy job, other hobbies, website, competitions...<br>
And if you finally master every little algorithm, you have to work hard each day to not forget anything and be able to execute them very fast.<br>
Actually, I think that if there would be someone fully mastering ZB (and most importantly: be exceptional on F2L!!!!!!), then it would force a few other cubers to use it too. And that makes me feel sad... I don&#x27;t want to work that hard. :-)<br>
<br>
There must be easier ways to achieve the times you could reach with ZB.<br>
Especially corners first systems look promising, because of the fewer moves.<br>
At the moment I am investigating CF approaches and I found some promising ones. CF systems where you solve several edges at once.<br>
After WC2005 I will give up CFOP for a while and see what these systems can bring.<br>
It would be great to not do this alone.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

It almost seems unfair to compare ZB to Fridrich via Sebastien and
Jean.  If you look at the SCC UWR list, their average times for F2L
are sub-9.  Since Fridrich and ZB &quot;share&quot; the first few steps--cross,
and first three pairs--I would think you could only compare the
remainder of their solves, instead of comparing entire times.  For
example, I remember seeing that you would like to be within one second
of the 1st place on the F2L fastest average list.  Therefore, would
you feel a bit more confident in ZB if your ZBF2L was sub-10 seconds?
 Even with a 6-second ZBLL, that would give you a sub-16 average.

I think that since there is an overlap between the two methods, it
would give you a better idea of comparison by comparing your speed for
the ZBF2L alg + ZBLL alg to the speed of a Fridrich 4th pair + OLL +
PLL. :-)

Whaddya think?

As far as I know, all official magics use exactly the same solution<br>

the original magics (I only know for sure on the Harry Potter magic). <br>

I assume you&#x27;re using a rubik&#x27;s 4x4x4.  I have that problem a lot too 
except when mine falls apart, it&#x27;s usually due to a center snapping.

But the way I do it is to build it layer by layer on a table.  For 
example, start with white.  Should be easy to get all the centers in.  
Then put in the rest of the pieces.  Build the side centers.  Should 
still be easy because the top isn&#x27;t done.  Then when you do the top, 
Just try to get as many centers out of the way when you put in the 
last one.  I think two of the centers should be able to move out of 
the way.

Hope that helps,
Ben.

          <div class="email-content">Ron, 
It would be great to have another corners guy on here.  I currently 
use an incomplete Waterman system and avg 21-23sec.  I say incomplete 
because I don&#x27;t position two edges while orienting the middle edges.  
Too many algs !  Also, I solve with the middle slice being &quot;E&quot; 
instead of &quot;M&quot; becuase I can execute the algs faster.  I wish I knew 
some details of the method that Dave Allen used.

Thanks Ben. I&#x27;m going to try and start over and do it that way. Right
now I have the whole thing done except for a corner, two edges, and a
center piece. I&#x27;m going to take apart the top layer and build up the
centers first.

http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/foo/uglyPLL.wmv
(479 KB)

1. The old alg with a new execution (slow)
2. Again but fast
3. My new alg

Both are below 3 seconds (2.8 for the old alg including regrip at 
start, and only 2.27 for my new alg).

Several places on the page, there are notations in parentheses about<br>

I&#x27;m confused.  First, there is U meaning &quot;Upper side&quot; and then there<br>
is Fridrich&#x27;s and Goljan&#x27;s &quot;constellation&quot; notation where U permutes<br>

I&#x27;m not sure why the standard notation wasn&#x27;t used for these turns.

They are in parentheses because they don&#x27;t really count toward the
length of the algorithm.  They are just there to let you know (a)
which direction the upper face is pointing when starting the algorithm
and (b) if there is a turn required at the end to align the face.

well this site was kinda supposed to be under wraps

have issues with the last set of edges, i will post
the page containing the last 2 sets of edges, it will
give you a guys taste of whats to come, i plan on
making this the main site for 4x4 and 5x5 information
and possibly contests in the future.  here is the page
address for those final steps, thanks to frank morris
for the algs on this page and all the other help on
the site, and thanks to the makers of the professor

any other cases should be mirrors of these, but please
take a picture or write it down and mail me if u see

          <div class="email-content">Hi Joseph,
I got a 5x5x5 last week and it took me a few hours thinking to work out the 
parity things.  It might not help but if you are just looking for hints and 
not actual algorithms then I would suggest as hints:

1.  To my mind there is only one issue and that is two edges apparently 
swapped - the other cases you mention can be reduced to this case.
2.  It really IS impossible to swap two edges.
3.  It might help to solve the edges before you solve all the centres.
4.  Its easier to see whats going on if you have the two edges in the same 
slice (rather than in the same layer for example).

Oh and I guess

5.  You can solve anything with conjugates!

Maybe thats all too cryptic or maybe it makes it too easy I don&#x27;t know :)

These hints amount to the rational thinking process I went through anyway 
and I&#x27;m not very fast (about 13 minutes!) but at least I understand whats 
going on now.  Hope that helps.

Duncan

Where and how do you fix the parity problem? I guess in step 3?

YES!!! Now 9.97 :-)

What has once been one of my worst three cases, is now one of my 
favourites. There are still other which I can do much faster, but this 
one is easy to recognize from all angles, it starts with the standard 
grip, and no cube rotation is necessary to set it up so that no U 
adjustment is necessary at the end.

Cheers!
Stefan

I&#x27;ve been hearing that they are the same thing as the Deluxe cube,  
only with holes in the tiles.
I think I might try and find one on ebay (I see them on there all the  
time, but no deluxe cubes: ( )

          <div class="email-content">Ok, let me know then :-). What&#x27;s your time for your current alg? I 
think you might easily get faster than me. The U and F at the end give 
me a bit of trouble. I&#x27;m trying two ways to fix it, one is to do the F 
with the middle finger. And I know you can do RUR&#x27;U fast like that, 
which I can&#x27;t. The other way is to push the U with my left index 
finger...

Cheers!

There is a deluxe cube on ebay right now, but you need sharp eyes. ;)

z&#x27; (U&#x27; L D&#x27; L2&#x27; U L&#x27; D)*2

But it takes me about 4 seconds to do and I don&#x27;t like the cube 
rotation, so I&#x27;m gonna find something better.

Gosh am I stupid. Try this:

The 4 seconds for the mirror case alg was without cube rotation, btw, 
it&#x27;s my slowest case.

Thats indeed what most top 4x4x4&#x27;ers do. With various little tricks 
along the way. Like pairing up many edges at a time or avoiding parity 
etc etc ...

Other ways of solving the 4x4x4 is the Akimoto columns method. Or my 
own cage method, which incidentally is VERY similar to Courtney 
mcFarrens method.

By searching around a little u should find info on those methods 
easily. Umm another potentially good method i&#x27;dl ike to listen is to 
do 2 opposite faces completely then the remaining edges (avoiding 
parity ... at least a trivial fix) then rest of the centers. There are 
others that may be good too. Like solving blocks-style like Petrus for 
the 3x3x3. Richard Patterson has looked into this. Not sure how far he 
got with it.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">In case anything is interested in what goes on in my head:<br>
<br>
The following is a full description of both the memorization and <br>
solving of  a cube scrambled with the following algorithm:<br>
<br>
U&#x27; R B F&#x27; R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; B F&#x27; R&#x27; U2 D&#x27; F&#x27; D L2 B2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R L B L2 R&#x27; U F2<br>
<br>
The first thing I memorize is the edge permutation.  I start with 1, <br>
and then go to 11.  Then I think that the cycle sweeps across the <br>
bottom to 9, and continues right, but goes diagonally up to 5 and then <br>
further across and back to 7.  From 7, I have to remember that it jumps <br>
to 3, but then I think that it sweeps across to the right to 2 and <br>
further down right to 10.  At 10, I have to remember that it jumps to <br>
6.  I glance at the timer and see that it reads 23 seconds.<br>
<br>
Then I see 4 and I see it plunges down to 12 and I realize it cycles to <br>
8.  I make a very quick mental note that it&#x27;s a clockwise cycle.<br>
<br>
For the corners, I see 1 going to 8 and 5.  I see the 8-corner in the <br>
one place so I make a quick note that I will start off with a D2 setup <br>
move for that cycle.  I then see 2 sweeping to 3 and I see that it <br>
continues down to 7.  I am relieved to see 4 and 8 in the right place.<br>
<br>
I notice the edge orientation that three edges are wrong on the top.  I <br>
see the front right edge in the middle layer is oriented wrong and I <br>
tell myself &quot;U2&quot; and then I picture very quickly that I will flip that <br>
edge in the middle layer for a four-edge flip.  I then flip the cube <br>
over with z2, tap the two adjacent edges that are wrong, and say to <br>
myself &quot;back left&quot;.<br>
<br>
I look at the corners, and think &quot;easy&quot; on the two corners which form a <br>
pair on the top layer in the left.  I flip the cube over with z2, and <br>
see three corners wanting to be clockwise twisted.  I make the mental <br>
note that no U-turns are necessary and that I will correct the corners <br>
starting with that first one, which happens to be on the URF after I <br>
flip the cube over with z2.<br>
<br>
I return the cube back to its position, and see that the timer reads 53 <br>
seconds.<br>
<br>
I immediately perform a right handed Sune and a left handed Sune.  Then <br>
I do z2 and cycle three corners clockwise.  Since the cube is already <br>
flipped over, I recall to myself &quot;back left&quot;, perform (L F), and do a <br>
two-edge flipper and then undo that setup move.  I then flip the cube <br>
back upright and do U2, F&#x27; and do the four-edge flipper that I <br>
visualized before.  I undo those setup moves.<br>
<br>
I recall the D2 setup move for (1 8 5) I told myself earlier so without <br>
thinking, I do D2 + (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;)x3 + D2 + (R&#x27; F R F&#x27;).  I remember that <br>
2 sweeps to 3 and continues down to 7.  I think that 7 wants to go to 2 <br>
so the setup move is U2 and I do U2 + (R B&#x27; R&#x27; B)x3 + U2 + (R B&#x27; R&#x27; <br>
B)x3.<br>
<br>
I turn my attention to the edges and I do L2 to put 11 next to 1.  I <br>
realize 9 is already in the bottom layer so I do D but do not do R2 to <br>
flip it up.  Instead, I begin my 3-cycle with just U.  I reverse the <br>
setup moves and then do U&#x27; and flip up the 5 and 7 and perform another <br>
counterclockwise U-permutation.  I reverse that and I immediately do <br>
another counterclockwise U-permutation because (1 3 2) is the nicest <br>
edge-cycle in the world.  I then do D&#x27; to put 10 next to 6 on the <br>
F-face and I do the counterclockwise U-permutation with the cube <br>
rotated but I do not do R&#x27; because I would have had to redo that for <br>
the setup move anyway.<br>
<br>
I then recall the clockwise U-permutation that awaits.  The clock reads <br>
1:53.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Darereck, (is that your name)?<br>
<br>
For JNetCube, the default sets white as the front and green as the top. <br>
  That&#x27;s because Chris Hunt solves it that way.  You can change the <br>
settings yourself in the options though.<br>
<br>
WCA scrambles are done two ways.  In certain tournaments, the <br>
organizers won&#x27;t say anything and they&#x27;ll just choose a color scheme.  <br>
The color scheme can be chosen at random.  Generally, if you request a <br>
certain color, the tournament organizers will honor that request.  In <br>
most tournaments in the United States, during registration, you have <br>
the opportunity to state what front and top color you would like for <br>
your puzzle for the different events.<br>
<br>
Color choosing is usually requested in the blindfold solves.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Just out of curiosity. Why would u do OLL and PLL for the edges of 
the last layer? Or u really mean OLL and PLL for edges and corners 
combined? I guess that will be far too many cases to be practical. I 
do corners on LL separately and then edges with 3-cycles pluss 
parity fix. I don&#x27;t have any need to orient edges then permute them. 
It&#x27;s unnecessary work. Using 3-cycles u for the most part solve 2 
edges at a time. It takes a while to get used to the various kinds 
of 3-cycles u will need. But it&#x27;s not extremely hard either :-) 
Umm .. doing centers also strictly layer by layer seems not like a 
good idea.

Cheers!

Now i follow. More details about doing first 3 layers pls. Do u do 
fully first layer then 3-cycles to solve middle 2-layer edges?

I can solve all of last layer corners/edges in about 20-25 secs on 
the 4x4x4. Sorting out the edges doesn&#x27;t have to be so long-winded 
really :-)

Have fun!

Good stuff, would you also make a printable page?

Hi Stefan,

This is how I used to do it:
Put the Up side on the right and do D&#x27; F2 R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R U2 L&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27; L
F2 D.

If you don&#x27;t like that one I&#x27;ve one more.

David J

Leyan and I decided to count the number of moves (in HTM) for a <br>
blindfold solve.  He did the above solve in 59 second memorization + 60 <br>
second solve and I did the above solve in 43 seconds memorization + 85 <br>
seconds solve.  We&#x27;re trying to figure out if there is a trade off <br>
between memorization and solve time.  The number of moves for my solve <br>
are as follows:<br>
<br>
Corner Orientation<br>
<br>
8*4 = 32<br>
<br>
Edge Orientation<br>
<br>
D2 F2 B + 4-Flip + B&#x27; F2 D2<br>
<br>
3 + 24 + 3 = 30<br>
<br>
Corner Permutation<br>
<br>
F2 U&#x27; + (A-Perm) + U F2<br>
<br>
2 + 9 + 2 = 13<br>
<br>
B2 F2 + (R A-Perm) U (Left A-Perm) U&#x27; + F2 B2<br>
<br>
2 + 9 + 1 + 9 + 1 + 2 = 24<br>
<br>
Edge Permutation<br>
<br>
2 + 11 + 2<br>
3 + 13 + 3<br>
2 + 11 + 2<br>
3 + 11 + 3<br>
<br>
Total = 165 moves<br>
<br>
Leyan on the other hand did: CO 28 + EO 32 + CP 26 + EP 49 = 135 moves.<br>

Hi David,

thanks, I do like the middle part a lot, but the D and F moves are 
killing me and I&#x27;d rather not have a cube rotation or regrip at start. 
What&#x27;s the other alg?

Cheers!
Stefan

Haha, I just realized I really knew the middle part already, since 
that&#x27;s another PLL I already use. It did feel somewhat familiar...

          <div class="email-content">Hey David,

I would love to, but unfortunately I have booked too many Saturdays
this semester.  My coach would get pissed if I booked another.  It&#x27;s
only a 3 hour (or so) drive, but I would probably not be able to leave
until around 10 or 11 (guessing here), and thus the tournament would
likely be half over. ;)  Sundays are the only free days I really have
for the rest of the semester (and next semester, racing in the
Spring). Hehe.  If for some reason practice gets out like super early,
I could *possibly* make it.  What time do you expect the tournament to
start?

I made a printable page tonight.  It is linked from the COLL page, but
 I will give the link here, also.

http://www.cubewhiz.com/collprint.html

I think eventually I will change the layout of my printable alg pages,
but it will do for now.  Eventually I want to have the algs all print
on one page and group the cases by orientation.

I should be able to make it.  Maryland isn&#x27;t that far from
Pittsburgh... actually, I&#x27;ll be at school in Virginia by then, so it
might even be closer!

Well you could try R&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L R but that changes the F2L.

Seriously though try L D&#x27; L B L2 D2 R F R&#x27; D2 L B&#x27; D L&#x27;

I don&#x27;t know whether or not it would suit your style.

Darn, another east coast comp, but I can&#x27;t make it! I would love to go,

          <div class="email-content">Ok, this is the one I found:
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=5989428808

I&#x27;m quite surprised about the prize, I thought it would go for much 
more. The Deluxe (if it is one), the Megaminx (Tomy?) and the Smart 
Alex should go for more already. And then there&#x27;s an Alexander&#x27;s Star, 
a Magix, two Worlds, a Rainbow Masterball and some low-price puzzles.

The way I found it: search for &quot;rubik&quot; and &quot;rubiks&quot; and *sort by 
price*.

David, is this the one you had in mind?

Cheers!
Stefan

I&#x27;m stopping four times in a row with a stopwatch now, record so far 
is 10.75 seconds. Already much faster than the alg I used previously 
and there&#x27;s no cube rotation at the start, so this is definitely my 
new alg for this case. It also uses the same setup rule as its mirror, 
i.e. bring the correct pair to front, then apply the alg. Any times 
from somebody else for this case?

13.55 12.87 12.62 12.56 13.90 13.67 (14.15) 12.59 13.17 12.28 12.83<br>
(12.13) SD=0.66 average 13.004(so close to sub13:D))with the fridrich<br>
method and think we can get sub12.<br>
<br>
Here are all the tips I use to speed my fridrich solves.<br>
<br>
CROSS:<br>
1.end your cross at D, L or R and try to find the 1st pair during the<br>
D, D&#x27; or D2 move. If you can anticipate the 1st pair during 15s of<br>
preinspection do it!<br>
<br>
2.try to build extended cross or a cross and a piece of the first<br>
pair, then before doing the D, D&#x27; or D2 to end the cross, insert the<br>
2nd piece of the 1st pair and you&#x27;ll get an extended cross<br>
<br>
3.be able to do the cross BLD almost everytime.<br>
<br>
F2L:<br>
<br>
<br>
1.Of course look ahead and have NO DELAYS<br>
<br>
2.use empty slots to less turn your cube during F2L.<br>
<br>
3.use multisloting to reduce your number of moves for solving F2L(try<br>
to do every F2L solve with less than 32 moves)<br>
<br>
4.have a look on LL edges from the 3rd slot to the 4rth slot, and try<br>
to orient as many as possible(it avoid 0 edges oriented OLL, and you<br>
have more than 1 chances out 27 to skip OLL if you master it since the<br>
3rd slot)<br>
<br>
5.of course know how to solve every case for every slots<br>
<br>
6.learn zbf2l algs for the cases where the last pair is incorrect but<br>
in its own slot.<br>
<br>
<br>
THE GOAL IS TO AVERAGE 7-8S FOR F2L<br>
<br>
LL:<br>
<br>
1.Have the best recognition system you can, the goal is to recognize<br>
and execute LL algs as fast as possible. For example when you got a<br>
thunder for OLL, place the 2 cases with the same orientation of the<br>
thunder, do the same thing for square cases...etcetcetc<br>
<br>
2.be able to achieve all OLL sub1.5 and all PLL sub2.<br>
<br>
3.avoid cube rotations during algs.<br>
<br>
THE GOAL IS TO AVERAGE 4-5S FOR LL<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

Professor (5x5x5) x-centers break rather too easily also. More 
easily than 4x4x4 centers i would say. Unless you use the original 
arxon which seems to have weaker centers than newer 4x4x4.

And anyway it seems to me the prices are a tad too high. Those who 
break cubies easily may be better off simply get a cheap cube off 
eBay for spare pieces.

That said it&#x27;s great that people now have a place to easily get 
single spare pieces. Myself, i have many &quot;retired&quot; cubes ;-)

Cheers!

I fixed the picture, thanks for pointing it out.  

As to the point of the parts being a little too pricey, these are 
brand new peices and I&#x27;d have to sell all the centers from each cube 
to make a profit, and since I probably won&#x27;t sell many of the other 
pieces, (edges &amp; corners) I&#x27;ll be lucky to break even on the parts, 
and that&#x27;s before I pay for shipping. ;)

Anyway, thanks to everyone for supporting cubesmith, I see a lot of 
kind words about my stuff around this board.

Which algs for LL do you use? From which website?

For people qho don&#x27;t know i&#x27;m sebastien felix, I averaged 13.00s (
13.55 12.87 12.62 12.56 13.90 13.67 (14.15) 12.59 13.17 12.28 12.83
(12.13) SD=0.66 average 13.004(so close to sub13:D))with the fridrich
method and think we can get sub12.

Here are all the tips I use to speed my fridrich solves.

CROSS:
1.end your cross at D, L or R and try to find the 1st pair during the
D, D&#x27; or D2 move. If you can anticipate the 1st pair during 15s of
preinspection do it!

2.try to build extended cross or a cross and a piece of the first
pair, then before doing the D, D&#x27; or D2 to end the cross, insert the
2nd piece of the 1st pair and you&#x27;ll get an extended cross

3.be able to do the cross BLD almost everytime.

F2L:


1.Of course look ahead and have NO DELAYS

2.use empty slots to less turn your cube during F2L.

3.use multisloting to reduce your number of moves for solving F2L(try
to do every F2L solve with less than 32 moves)

4.have a look on LL edges from the 3rd slot to the 4rth slot, and try
to orient as many as possible(it avoid 0 edges oriented OLL, and you
have more than 1 chances out 27 to skip OLL if you master it since the
3rd slot)

5.of course know how to solve every case for every slots

6.learn zbf2l algs for the cases where the last pair is incorrect but
in its own slot.


THE GOAL IS TO AVERAGE 7-8S FOR F2L

LL:

1.Have the best recognition system you can, the goal is to recognize
and execute LL algs as fast as possible. For example when you got a
thunder for OLL, place the 2 cases with the same orientation of the
thunder, do the same thing for square cases...etcetcetc

2.be able to achieve all OLL sub1.5 and all PLL sub2.

3.avoid cube rotations during algs.

THE GOAL IS TO AVERAGE 4-5S FOR LL




THE GOAL OF FRIDRICH METHOD IS TO AVERAGE 11-13S...

I hope this topic will help some cubers.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Sebastien!

Congratulations on your new average that is absolutely amazing!

Also thanks for your tips, I&#x27;m sure I speak for a number of people
when I say that I think they&#x27;ll be useful.

I&#x27;ve already started trying to prepare the next c/e pair while working
on the current one (multislotting) and so far I like it!  However
since I just started I really don&#x27;t know many cases and I have a hard
time doing it quickly.  But I assume this comes with practice.

Thanks again for the tips, I for one will be reading over and trying
to implement them in my own solving.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I remember this topic came up a long time ago, and it was decided that<br>
it would probably take a lot of work.<br>
<br>
Is there a way that we can build some sort of testing program to<br>
analyze this?  Maybe we could fabricate lots of similar scrambles with<br>
only a small portion of the algs different (say two or three turns in<br>
the middle) and have the users rate which one feels &quot;faster&quot;.<br>
<br>
This way we could have it rate two types of regrips, or two ways to<br>
insert an uncomfortable B move into a fast RUL alg or something like that.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve noticed with ZBLL algs that I almost exclusively look for RUL<br>
algs now.  I usually also end up liking RULM moves too, but they just<br>
don&#x27;t come up that often for the algs I need.<br>
<br>
Even when I get a weird alg like L D R U&#x27; R E R2 F D2 B&#x27; D2 F2 which<br>
has D,E,F, and B turns I still turn it into an RUL alg.  My trigger<br>
for this one is almost exclusively RrULlM except for one easy to<br>
execute F turn in the middle: L z&#x27; (R U) [L&#x27; (U)] [(M&#x27;) (U2)] (F) [R<br>
l] [U&#x27; (l&#x27;)2] U2<br>
<br>
What other turn groups are good?  I think ULD and URD and URF and ULF<br>
are also very fast!  What others do you guys use?<br>
<br>
Also do we think that together we could try to work on such a program,<br>
or would it not be very practical/accurate?  I was recently reminded<br>
of this old topic, but I don&#x27;t remember what we concluded.<br>
<br>
I think it would be very interesting if it existed, but I wonder about<br>
how good it would be at actually identifying which algs are good.<br>
<br>
What do you programmers think?<br>

To find these I&#x27;ve been using Jaap&#x27;s sq1optim.exe program.  It&#x27;s <br>
really fast, but it doesn&#x27;t pause between algorithms and it doesn&#x27;t <br>
have enough options for me.<br>
<br>
Plus the algorithms that I get are sometimes pretty ugly like: (1,0)/<br>
(5,-4)/(-2,-5)/(3,-3)/(-3,0)/(5,2)/(0,-3)/(4,-2)/(5,-3)<br>
<br>
So I&#x27;m wondering, has anyone already compiled a list of good edge <br>
permutation algorithms?<br>
<br>
Or does anyone have a square-1 solver with more options like no turns <br>
of 4 or 5, or ignoring the side-colors?<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help,<br>
Ben.<br>

Same here.. Ron van Bruchem told me he had no problem with it (without<br>
practicing one-handed) because he used to do a lot of computer-cubing<br>
and therefor could reproduce the actual algs pretty quickly<br>

          <div class="email-content">hi there ben.

ive come up with some simple but pretty fast
permutation for three cycle edge permutation and i
believe we can also derive other forms of permutations
from it.

its pretty hard to describe but ill see if i can get a
video of it onto this forum.

it involves.

(doing moves set A, my discovery :P)-(moving bottom by
1,2,5 etc.)-(reversing moves set A&#x27;)

its pretty fast from what i think.

...I think that multisloting is not fast to master but quite easy,<br>
that is just intuitive algs, the hardest thing is to anticipate the 4<br>
pieces! but doing that force you to develop you&#x27;re anticipation, it<br>
allow you to see how pieces will change during F2L and have a better<br>
fridrich F2L solve.<br>
<br>
I advice everybody to work a lot on his LL algs because thats one of<br>
the key to low averages(have an efficient LL with an avg of 4-5s at<br>
everytime), the other is to have an efficient F2L,)<br>
<br>
but i got one question for your gilles, why don&#x27;t you use ZBF2L for<br>
the last pair of your 2nd 1*2*3 blok and then use COLL to skip the<br>
orientation stage for your 6 last edges?<br>

You know, I hate to say this, but I have to agree here.  Now, I don&#x27;t know Sebastian, so I 
am not one to judge on his character.  However, the tournament in France where he set a 
20.02 average was in April.  Do you really expect us to believe that you cut 7 seconds off 
of your average in 3 months?  People spend years trying to shave off seconds especially in 
the 15 and 16 second range.  A 13 second average is amazingly fast, and I do not believe 
it is possible to achieve that from 20.02 in 3 months, especially since Rubik&#x27;s Cubing is 
not a job.

If you would provide some sort of video evidence that you can indeed accomplish this, 
then perhaps we would have more reason to believe.  However, as it stands, no one asked 
you for your advice and you simply put out an e-mail with &quot;your view about fridrich&quot;.  I get 
the feeling that you claim to be a master at Fridrich and a foremost authority simply 
because you occupy the number 1 slot on the unofficial rankings list.

There&#x27;s news.  You can say whatever you want!  But no one has to believe you.  In all 
honesty, you are not the number 1 cuber.  There are 24 cubers who are faster than you.  
You are 25th.  This is based on official competitions where we know you cannot cheat or 
lie.

And yeah, thanks a lot for presenting your views on Fridrich.  You have done nothing but 
spit out the mantra of every sub-25 cuber out there in the world.  Find algorithms that fit 
your hands?  Look ahead?  We know all of this already!  I do not see a single novel idea in 
anything that you have presented.

Thylakoid is right.  You cannot expect any respect from any of us unless you provide us 
with a little bit of evidence.  Just a little.  Macky has time and time again in competition 
showed that he can achieve low 15 and sub-15 averages in pressure situations.  For a 
13.00 second cuber, I would expect you to solve a cube, on a bad day, in about 15 
seconds.  Just show us a 15.5 second average and it will quell the doubts of everyone.

You gain nothing from bragging here.  No one believes you, and when it comes time for 
the competition, you will be beaten by 19 second cubers, and you&#x27;ll be searching for 
excuses, and we&#x27;ll all turn away, and turn our attention to those who have honest 
characters.

<br>
I don&#x27;t know much about fast progress, but what I know by my own<br>
experience is that you can always improve yourself, and sometimes it<br>
doens&#x27;t take that long if you have done many mistakes all along, and<br>
then one day you say &quot;oh ! I can do that instead !&quot;<br>
<br>
Ron can tell you that 2 or 3 days ago I sent him 2 differents emails<br>
about a new best average : 22.16 in the morning, and the evening I did<br>
a 20.97.<br>
<br>
What happened ? I changed something in the way I was solving the<br>
cross, and the result is there.<br>
<br>
Now I can agree that there is a slight difference between 1.19 seconds<br>
(from 22.16 to 20.97) and 7 seconds (from 20 to 13).<br>
That&#x27;s why I agree that it&#x27;s possible to have a doubt, but you can&#x27;t<br>
judge the person directly without letting him proving himself.<br>
I see 2 possibilities here :<br>
1. One video would be a very good way to prove yourself to the people<br>
(and have your average accepted in the UWC list)<br>
2. Wait until the next tournament to see if you can solve it so fast<br>
<br>
You can choose :-)<br>
Anyway, keep up the good work :-)<br>

I must say that I find all of those posts outrageously offensive.
It&#x27;s always possible to have doubts, but then accusing people of
cheating is another matter, unless YOU have proofs that he&#x27;s cheating...
... and YOU obviously don&#x27;t.

I don&#x27;t say we have proofs of Sebastian&#x27;s times either, but he must
have the benefit of doubts. What I know for sur about him is :
- he has probably one of the most technical F2L today ;
- his LL is very famous in France, used by the so called members
  of the absolut team.
- his best average was around 16.xx at the time of the french open,
  not 20.xx
- I&#x27;ve heard he works rubik&#x27;s cube **A LOT** those days.

Now if you take as evidence the competition results, you are
probably wrong. I can give you numerous example why :
- in the German ChShip, Ron VB&#x27;s average over 15 cubes was around 18.5
  how do u explain he could make a 14.59 average one month before ?
- what about Gilles Roux&#x27;s times ? Can you explain why he has problems
  even getting under 20&#x27;&#x27; in competition and produce 15.xx at the same
  times ?
- What about Stefan Pochmann ? He was around 26&#x27;&#x27; in that german open
  and now he&#x27;s claiming sub19, when everybody knows that he has a full
  time job, and that he also achieves numerous performances in 4x4, 5x5,
  BLD, magic, click, etc. ? Where did he find the time to cut those 7&#x27;&#x27; ?

I think that nobody would doubt about the performances of the 3 guys
above. It just tells us that there&#x27;s a huge gap between competition
and cubing at home.

By the way, those records are &quot;unofficial&quot;.

This is maybe going to far, &quot;everyone&quot;, &quot;no-one&quot;, why do you
think you are allowed to speak in the name of the whole rubik&#x27;s
community ?

I advise moderation,

          <div class="email-content">This has nothing to do with not performing well in competition. When
did I say he did not perform well? All I said was that he improved

          <div class="email-content">Hi there,


I&#x27;m just a sub30 cubist, and never entered any comp&#x27;
so far, so I&#x27;m maybe not the best one to write this
post.

Anyway...

I was wondering about the fairness of allowing an 
extra time for pops in comps.

If you consider that :
- popping is the consequence of bad handling of the cube
- popping occurs when you take lots of risks to achieve
  a great time ;
- in other sports like tennis, we don&#x27;t allow to replay
  the point when a string gets broken ; in car races, if
  you go to fast and leave the road, you are not allowed 
  another start ;
- in principle you could &quot;fake&quot; a pop when you need another
  excellent time in comp&#x27;, and you just have realized that
  the start of your F2L is rather bad...(ok, enough about
  &quot;cheating&quot; today ;))
... I&#x27;m wondering if we should really allow extra cube for
popping.


If we still allow extracube...
Would it be clever to change the rule that for the extra
cube, you get some kind of penalty like :
IDEA1 : add 2&#x27;&#x27; to the extra cube time ;
 or
IDEA2 : the time of the extra cube cannot be better than
        your {average(AVG) on the serie] +(alpha x SD).
        [SD = standard dev.]
        [example, alpha = 1. You time (T_ex) your extra cube :.
         If T_ex >= AVG + SD, then you keep T_ex in the Avg
            T_ex &lt;  AVG + SD, you replace T_ex by AVG + SD.]

Well, what do you think ?

Hi &quot;isolvecubes&quot;, &quot;thylakoid125&quot;, &quot;Jonathan&quot; or whoever you really 
are. Yes, I did notice that you &quot;both&quot; only joined the group 
yesterday. And what&#x27;s the first thing you do? Attack someone you don&#x27;t 
even know. What shall we think about *you* now?

And yes, no one asked for his advice here. Well, maybe someone asked 
in email. Plus, which of the posts here have been asked for? Certainly 
nobody asked for yours, either! And I myself am happy and thankful 
Sebastien posted his advice. He did *not* only repeat old ideas, and 
even if he did, it would reaffirm my faith in those ideas, so it would 
still be welcome. I would know that I&#x27;m on the &quot;right way&quot; to success.

And yes, if someone is a &quot;master&quot; on something, he might feel the 
desire to share his knowledge. Is there anything wrong with this? I 
know I felt that way for example when making my magic videos. And it 
has even paid back for me, since Alexander Ooms improved my master 
magic method and then showed me the improvement.

That&#x27;s no proof, either. The scramble sequences he used could be 
identity algs, i.e. not changing the cube. For a better proof, he 
should repeat (throw into air then make *one* move) let&#x27;s say 10 times 
(starting with an already scrambled cube). And a moving environment 
would be good, e.g. people walking around, so that he can&#x27;t trick with 
video editing.

Then again, that&#x27;s all unnecessary. I believe him anyway, I don&#x27;t need 
a proof. I don&#x27;t even need the scrambling he already showed.

Then again, it&#x27;s not useless. It does increase the entertainment value 
a bit, which I&#x27;ve already noticed comparing Tyson&#x27;s two blindfold 
videos. From a &quot;trust&quot; point of view it doesn&#x27;t matter to me whether 
he has someone else scrambling and then people walking and talking 
around him. But it is indeed more lively and entertaining, especially 
his remark after the solve :-)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Jonathan and Mr. thylakoid,

I think that you have both read entirely too much into the the 
initial post of Sebastien.  Please go ahead and read it again ... 
I&#x27;ll wait.

Good.  Now, Sebastien&#x27;s subsequent posts in this topic were simply 
responses to questions asked of him.  I&#x27;m not sure where you get the 
idea that he is trying to pass himself off as the &quot;foremost 
authority&quot; or a &quot;deity.&quot;  Your reactions to Sebastien&#x27;s post are 
just not warranted by what he wrote.

There has been much discussion in this forum of the limits of 
different solution methods.  In his first post Sebastien merely 
states that he thinks &quot;... we can get sub12&quot; and goes on to give 
some of his recommendations.  He should be free to do this without 
harassment.  First, this is a forum dedicated to the open discussion 
of speedcubing.  Second, while he has not shown himself to be the 
single fastest cuber in the world in competition, he has shown 
himself to be one of the fastest in the world.  Even though most of 
what he wrote has been written before, I suspect that it could still 
give insight to some of us ~30&quot; cubers how a &lt;20&quot; cuber focuses his 
efforts.

Peace,
Scott

Uh, just to clarify:

- Like Sebastien, I had already been much better (than 26 seconds) 
back then, my record average was 21.46 I believe. In addition to being 
nervous, I had also just a few days earlier learned the last 3 PLLs 
and switched to block recognition method and I forced myself to use 
the new stuff.

- Uh, if I have a full time job, then it&#x27;s cubing and I unfortunately 
don&#x27;t get paid for it. I pretty much do it all day long, every day.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">You don´t have to judge him and call him a cheater. I realize that 
some poeple may find it funny to send in fake times but Felix has 
shown that he is indeed a good cuber at French Championship, and I 
don&#x27;t think a guy who is really into cubing would do that.

Some guys are nervous during competitions and do much worse times 
then they usually do at home. That meaans that Felix may have had a 
personal best of 16-17 when he did 20 in April at a competition. 
That means that his improvement maybe was &quot;only&quot; 16-13=3 seconds 
which I think is possible in 4 months.

Just my opinion.

How do you prove that he popped on purpose? I almost never pop myself 
(thanks to my cubes and my style) but I could imagine someone having a 
&quot;pop-pll&quot; that looks like a normal algorithm but forces a pop. I know 
some of my algs are much more prone to popping than others. It could 
even be an identity algorithm, i.e. in case you fail to pop, you only 
lose a little time.

I don&#x27;t like the current pop handling, either, and I think the penalty 
idea is a good compromise. In the rules they&#x27;re unfortunately called 
&quot;Puzzle Defects&quot;, though actually they&#x27;re of course the fault of the 
cuber. Even if you want to blame the puzzle, you must blame the person 
who chose and prepared the puzzle.

My first vote would go to not treating pops specially, i.e. if you 
pop, you better fix it fast and continue.

My second vote would go to Francois&#x27; IDEA1 of adding 2 seconds, since 
the cuber should not get away for free for making a mistake. IDEA2 is 
too complicated I think.

Cheers!
Stefan

There will be two &quot;gaps&quot; in between tiles, diagonal from each other
that have only two strings in them instead of four.

Key word:  &quot;seems&quot;...

> Is it really important to have all the strings ?

Though you can probably achieve the same times as you normally would
(or sometimes even slightly faster times), the puzzle is less stable.
  You become much more likely to break another string and it becomes
quite easy to tangle the puzzle when you are solving it.  I know from
past experience of solving with a missing string. :( Ugly stuff,
really... lol

Hey everybody,

I am almost a bit afraid to give a reply in this discussion.. It&#x27;s 
already getting a bit tooo crowded in here. Anyway, first of all, 
I&#x27;d like to ask everybody to stay calm, for your own sake. 

Second, it&#x27;s very natural for people to have doubts. People want to 
see before they believe something. And I don&#x27;t really think there&#x27;s 
anything wrong with that. Humans tend to have doubts, try to 
understand that Sebastian.

To the people who have doubts: There&#x27;s no need to accuse anyone or 
use bad language or anything. Just remember to always be polite.

About the credibility of videos: Of course, we all know that videos 
proove nothing. However, seeing someone on the internet, on 
websites, pics, of videos, anything on the net, help me a lot. I 
remember when Jean Pons had the UWR for the cube, I had a pretty 
hard time believing him. But we had some chats on MSN and nice races 
with a webcam (really had that &#x27;race&#x27;-feeling), and it made me 
confident that he was for real. The idea is simple: Katsu has a huge 
site with video&#x27;s, tv-appearances etc. so there&#x27;s no reason to doubt 
he did a sub-15 average. But if someone cuber posts exactly the same 
times, it would still be easier to believe Katsu then to believe 
that new person. We all know it&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;s easier to trust 
someone you &#x27;know&#x27; (even though I only know Katsu by his website).

I must say I am also a pretty sceptical about the new records 
Sebastian is telling us (I hate to say this, Sebastian ;)). But I 
also had a few chats with him, and he sounds like a pretty nice guy, 
and I know he&#x27;s into cubing pretty seriously, so I can&#x27;t see why any 
cuber who is into cubing that seriously would make up records like 
that. There is simply no &#x27;motive&#x27;.

So yes, I would appreciate to see some more nice videos. And no, I 
am not calling anyone a *.

See you guys,

Joël.

I second this idea, in particular for events with &quot;average of...&quot; 
(that is, when slowest and fastest times are removed) and events 
with &quot;best of...&quot;. For such events, one pop will not be decisive for 
the results. I may have second thoughts about it for events with &quot;mean 
of&quot; where all solves counts, since then a big pop would be disasterous 
for the results.

Ok, video analysis rules :-)

My record for doing it four times in a row is around 9.3 now, but a 
video analysis showed me that I can already achieve Sebastian&#x27;s sub2 
goal with flawless execution. I can&#x27;t tell exactly but I think it&#x27;s 
around 1.9 seconds:

          <div class="email-content">I thought Sebastien&#x27;s Fridrich tips were helpful, they weren&#x27;t  
regurgitated from other websites...
And if he did a 20 avg. in public, and can do 13 at home that doesn&#x27;t  
really mean he cut 7s off his time - cubing at home is much  
different. But even so, I don&#x27;t think that 3-4 months is too short to  
cut off that amount of time if he works hard at it everyday. I&#x27;ve  
only been cubing for 5 months and I&#x27;ve gone from solving in minutes  
to averaging 29s.

Sebastien will you be competing a tournament any time soon?

Especially if you work not only hard, but also smart.

How many times have I told myself to learn the last few missing algs? 
Or systematically practice/improve/replace the algs that are bad for 
me? Or to learn algs so that the U adjustment for similarly looking 
cases is the same? Or use the stackmat? And use computer scrambles? 
And write down the times and collecting statistics? And always use 
perfect cubes? Or in general any stuff that requires me to do some 
serious thinking/work instead of just stupid lazy practicing?

Cheers!
Stefan

P.S. Talent can help, too :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi. I am sorry too..<br>
you can rebuild it using fishing wire. but this is a hard thing to do yourself...<br>
I have the same problem and until today I haven&#x27;t fixed it.<br>
Time ago, rubiks.com offered magic DIY, but not now and I think it will never be on sale again.<br>
I found some web pages were you can take some ideas on how to rebuild your magic.<br>

<br>
<br>
The &#x27;only&#x27; thing you must do is to make your own strings with some fishing wire... I have not tried yet, but some day maybe. If you experience some advances, please inform me.<br>
<br>
have fun...<br>

I have talked with Sebastien quite a bit over the past couple of weeks, and his tips have helped alot.  Thanks!  Also, I was in a chat with him and Jon Morris yesterday, and he walked us through some of his F2L solves.  Jon generated the scrambles right there, and the solutions were given quickly.  Judging by the way that Sebastien solved the F2L, I can definately see how he can post such fast times.  This, coupled with his &quot;perfected&quot; Last Layer, I believe that his times are credible.  
 
I know first hand how competitions can affect one&#x27;s performance.  It is much different than relaxing in front of the computer, solving for hours on end.  Nerves definately mess with me.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, as always, this is been a controversial topic.  The trick, of 
course, is finding a method that allows us to deal with &#x27;average&#x27; 
competitions and &#x27;mean&#x27; competitions.  Obviously, in the &#x27;mean&#x27; 
competition, the effects are much more detrimental.  Anyway, keep 
throwing out ideas, but I can say there probably won&#x27;t be any 
significant changes before 2006.  We don&#x27;t want to be meddling around 
too much before WC 2005.

On the WC on August 23/24, 2003, Macky&#x27;s best time was 20.30 seconds. On the Caltech Spring Tournament, on April 3, 2004 (less than 7 months after), his best time was 12.11 and the average of the all tournament was 15.62. He cuted of 8 seconds on 7 months, both done on oficial competitions. Why Sebastien times aren&#x27;t posible? I&#x27;ve been cubing since June 15 (i&#x27;m not sure about the day, but was around this), and improved from 5 minutes to 45s average, and with a very bad cube from China.

My recommendation:  buy a couple Simpson or Harry Potter Magics from
rubiks.com and disassemble them for their strings.  They are $5 each.
 I used Jaap&#x27;s website for putting a Magic together (I have done it
before).  Over the past few months since I started Magic-ing, I have
replaced over 60 strings (maybe an underestimate).  It happens.  I
have never heard of anybody making their own from fishing line
(probably not even worth the effort).  If it is your first time
building a Magic from nothing, it will take a few hours, but it is
worth the experience, because you will probably have to do it again. :-P

          <div class="email-content">In Macky&#x27;s defense, best time comparisons are not the same as average 
comparisons.  All it takes for a &#x27;best time&#x27; is just one good solve and 
we all understand that.  If you really want to do a comparison, I think 
Macky was averaging around 20 back at WC 2003 and took his average down 
to about 16 at the Caltech tournament.  Macky also has a habit of doing 
well in tournaments.

Whoa, that&#x27;s a lot :-)

I have maybe broken 15-20 so far... next time you completely 
disassemble one, you could try lubing the strings, I use pure liquid 
(but high viscosity) silicone now. It&#x27;s not only good to make cubes 
twist faster but also to protect plastic.

You could also just go slower. I&#x27;d especially suggest that for 
tournaments, because you&#x27;re more nervous anyway. Especially I&#x27;d 
suggest that for you, Bob, in Dallas.

I know somebody who did, but he said he breaks strings (original or 
his own) every three solves so he stopped magicing ;-)

Cheers!

The thing with LL algs is that you dont just have to do them
quickly(about 2-3s in your case) you must always do them at the same
speed and have no lock up, thats one of the basic advice you can find
on every good speedcubing page, because one alg done slower than usual
and you can loose 2-3s on a solve...

          <div class="email-content">I have one, and it&#x27;s far better then the best speedcube I&#x27;ve ever had.

but I did have to lube mine, but that made it perfect.  As far as
looking strange, I don&#x27;t see that as a negative point, since it makes

-) Because you can prepare this last pair while finishing the previous 
1x2x2. Recognizing the orientation of 5 or 6 edges takes time.

-) Because fixing orientations at the same time requires additional 
moves, sometimes as much as when you do it later with slices.

-) Because CLL is faster than COLL, and &quot;CLL after 2*1x2x3&quot; is even 
faster.

-) Because more substeps in the end means more lucky cases too, and 
different possible strategies. Quite often, 6E4C (6 edges + 4 centers) 
can be solved in 10 moves or less.

-) Because with an early orientation, 6E4C often begins with a costly 
M2 move you can avoid when mixing orientation and permutation.

-) And more :-)

I&#x27;m sure there are positive arguments for what you propose, but 
overall, I feel it&#x27;s not worth it.

Gilles.

<br>
I just got my new DIY cube in the post. (They said 30-40 business <br>
days to ship to Australia and it arrived in a week :D)<br>
<br>
A few questions about putting this baby together:<br>
<br>
1) How tight should I adjust the centres? I&#x27;ve tried to make them <br>
even all around with a gap of about 1mm, but not fully tight. <br>
<br>
2) Should I play with the cube before I put the lube in? I mean <br>
perhaps cubing a bit before will smooth the cubies a little, does <br>
anyone have any recommendations on the best way to break in a new <br>
cube like this?<br>
<br>
3) Which way should I put the coloured stickers on? My old cube had <br>
blue opposite white but on cubing video&#x27;s I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of cubes <br>
with yellow opposite white instead.<br>
<br>

G&#x27;day Alex, where are you from? I&#x27;m an aussie too. I live in NSW.
It&#x27;s up to you which way you sticker you cube but I did mine in the 
standard Rubiks configuration, eg. white opp yellow etc. I&#x27;ve also 
heard that the lube that they come is&#x27;nt that good so I just used 
silicone spray instead.

Keith.

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

I&#x27;m in Sydney, but don&#x27;t know many cubers around here :) Only some 
friends from school but they aren&#x27;t exactly speed cubers... My latest 
average is 31.2 seconds so I&#x27;m not too shabby but then again I&#x27;m a 
long way from the elite cubers! I&#x27;m hoping to find some speed in my 
new cube as my old cube was always catching and scratching and being 
a pain.

As for the DIY cube, I was kind of hoping the supplied lube would be 
good but I guess I&#x27;ll have to go looking in a hardware shop now for 
some spray-on stuff.

One last question is about the centre caps. How do you get them to 
stay on? They have these little ridges around the edges which stop 
them even from sitting neatly inside the centre cubes. I guess I&#x27;ll 
have to glue them but I still want to be able to pop them off if I 
need to adjust the screw tension, right?

Thanks,
Alex MDC

Now you might want to glue or use any other technique to be sure they<br>
won&#x27;t go off, but this means you won&#x27;t be able to remove them<br>
afterwards (or it&#x27;ll be a lot more difficult).<br>

you guys sand the inner part of the cubies right away as part of the
process?

I&#x27;m gonna have an american friend to bring a few kits to Mozambique
(where I currently live) and don&#x27;t want to mess up any of them. They
are too precious here.

1. I think that it&#x27;s easier to start tight and then loosen than to
start loose then tighten. 
2. play with it for a few hours for about a week. Lube it then do it
again.
3. I prefer white opposite blue which was the original color scheme.
If you get a Deluxe cube, a Rubik&#x27;s game cube or the original 2x2x2
and 4x4x4 they are all white opposite blue.

The supplied lube is a silicone based lube and works very well.

A sliver of paper can help hold the cap on. If you insist of gluing it
avoid epoxy because you may never get the cap off again.

Gilles van den Peereboom 

The silicone spray to avoid is the oil-based version. 

Marco Garbelini 

Don&#x27;t sand the inside of the cube at first. Try adjusting the spring
tension, and wearing it in, and lubing it first. Very very rarely is
any sanding needed.

Cheers,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi Guys,

Concerning how much someone can improve over time:

The second time I solved the cube it took me an hour. It was
immediately scrambled and the third time I solved the cube it took me
15 minutes. So inside of 15 minutes I improved 45 minutes, which was a
rate of 7,776,000 seconds per month.  :)

 This, coupled with his &quot;perfected&quot; Last Layer, I believe that his

I&#x27;ve been cubing for almost 2 years and I just learned the last of OLL
today. That&#x27;s just me though. If you&#x27;re anyone else, you can probably
learn all the algs in 2-3 months. If you Bob Burton or Chris Hardwick,
then you can learn the algs in 2-3 weeks. ;)

Do you know if they have screws?
and how about the 25th anniversary cube?

You can understant that you have less contrast when you look at a
white or a yellow sticker, then I think it takes a longer time to
recognize it as white or yellow.

Despite that, I think it&#x27;s as good as any other cube if it&#x27;s well
lubed and built. :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
I recently received my StackMat Generation 2 (with a big tournament <br>
display!).<br>
It works fine, it feels a bit faster to stop, but it also requires <br>
more precise positioning of the hands to start and stop.<br>
<br>
One issue I found is that for speedcubing the small display is too <br>
close and too soft. So when you throw down your cube, you can <br>
accidentally touch the small display with your cube. I now have a pit <br>
in my display. :-(<br>
Yesterday I glued a small piece of transparent acryl on top of the <br>
display, to protect it.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

Are you asking if the 25th anniversary cube has screws? If you
are...then I don&#x27;t think so. I have had mixed results with the 25th
anniversary cube. The first one I received was very loose and rattled
way too much for my tastes. The second is much better and has the
potential to be a nice cube.

Mmh, I finally looked up &quot;oil&quot; in wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil

Maybe petroleum is bad (not sure, just a guess), but not oil in 
general. I doubt vegetable oil would harm the cube. And these days I&#x27;m 
using pure silicone oil to lube my cubes (all kinds) and it&#x27;s great.

What system are you using for the F2L? And what are your times like 
now? And how much experience do you have.. It&#x27;s easier for me to give 
you tips when I know the answers to these questions.

If you want to know how I improved, just take a look at my cubelog on 
www.solvethecube.co.uk (I started on december 2003, btw). I can also 
recommend reading my tips page (see tutorials -> #5). Especially what 
I see about not focussing on speed too much.

It took me about two or three weeks to learn all the PLL&#x27;s. And it 
took me a few months to do OLL, yes I took my time for those.

For PLL algorithm: Try to search different websites with different 
algs to find the ones you like most. Do this every once in a while, 
and also try other algs you rejected a few months before.

For OLL algorithms: Try my OLL page :). Maybe it works for you. (but 
also look for alternatives on other sites!

Good luck with getting sub-20!

Joël.

Just wait until you are flying through a solve and slam your hands 
down excited  to see a nice fast time on your spiffy new timer, only 
to realize you have accidentally hit the RESET button with your 
right thumb, never to know your time.  It happens to me almost 
weekly.  I fear it happening in a competition.  Why they would not 
put the reset button on the SIDE of the timer is beyond me.

If you get my Deluxe then it&#x27;ll have white opposite yellow. Well, ok, 
that statement is meaningless. I could also say that if you get my 
Deluxe, the moon will consist of green cheese.

Ha. I  bought two 20oz. cans of Heavy Duty Silicone Lubricant about 18
months ago and I haven&#x27;t even finished the first. I really like it
because it&#x27;s &quot;99% pure high viscosity silicone&quot; and lasts quite a
while. I bought it for $5.99 a can from here:

          <div class="email-content">Hey Pedro,

Hey Pedro,

I am not yet sub-20, but here is an idea of my progress once I began
&quot;speedcubing&quot;

Feb. 7 - Switch from cross on top to cross on bottom, begin learning
F2L instead of first layer corners -> middle edges
-- 2 week break from learning --
Mid-March - (2 weeks) - Learn PLL
-- 2 week break from learning --
Begin taking averages with Fridrich for first time! :)
Mid-April - (6 weeks, noncontinuous) - Learn OLL
-- 6 week break from learning --
Mid-July - (2 weeks) - Learn COLL
Late July - (2 days) - Learn VH edge control (connected first day,
non-connected second day)

Just over five months after I started learning Fridrich, I got the
average that currently stands as my best, 23.49 seconds.  Like
everybody says, it&#x27;s all about the F2L.  My F2L sucks (17-18 second
avg?), and it&#x27;s the only reason why I&#x27;m not sub-20...maybe if I
practiced for more than 3 hours per week? :(

Don&#x27;t learn all LL algs from the same place.  That&#x27;s bad.  There are
TONS of sites with different LL algs, and some will fit you better
than others.

Does this help?  Everybody is different, you know that. :P

Remember, a 4-look LL with a lightning fast F2L is faster than a
crappy F2L with a 2-look LL. ;) (I don&#x27;t listen :\)

Those times are very normal for your system and your experience. It 
is actually very similar to my situation when I was cubing for two 
months! So keep on going like this, and you will be fine. If you 
ever want my help, just use the &#x27;contact&#x27; option on my site.

At this point, my tip about solving the cube very slowly (number 1) 
is pretty important. Try to find your own shortcuts for the F2L.

My opinion:
I perceive white and yellow to be the brightest colors on my cube,
so I like having yellow opposite white on my cube. I feel that it
(in Fridrich style solving) helps first in f2l recognition (using
white) and then in OLL recognition (using yellow) since those colors
stand out the most from the others. I also like the idea of having
similar colors (white/yellow, blue/green, red/orange) opposite one
another. I think that it helps me with PLL recognition.

Take a look at Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s suggestion for using paper to hold 
the caps in place. I recently tried it with my DIY cube and I like 
it. Take look at messages #16940 and 17455 in this group to learn 
more about it.

Peace,
Scott

P.S. My current best average is just barely sub-30, so don&#x27;t take
my post as expert testimony. I&#x27;m curious to hear other people&#x27;s
ideas on the color issue.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Pedro,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been cubing for about 11 months now. I&#x27;ve gotten 5 sub 20<br>
averages so far, and I can average about 21 seconds consistently once<br>
I&#x27;m warmed up. I was using a very basic 7 step LBL method for about 7<br>
months probably. I didn&#x27;t really practice that much, just when I was<br>
bored in my spare time really, but eventually I could consistenly<br>
average 30 seconds using that crappy method (best average was 27.94).<br>
Then I started getting bored at using the same thing and I decided I<br>
wanted to get faster, so I started learning PLL. It took me about 3<br>
weeks to learn them all. I used just this method for about a month<br>
and was averaging under 30 seconds with it. I went to the Horace Mann<br>
tournament using this, and that REALLY sparked my motivation to get<br>
faster. As soon as I got home from the tournament, I started learning<br>
F2L. It took about two weeks to get through the algs (I had a hard<br>
time seeing things intuitively at first), and I was very frustrated<br>
because I was averaging about 40 seconds. It was really tough for me<br>
to see the pairs for a while. But suddently I just started gradually<br>
improving, and within a few days really I went from averaging 40 to<br>
averaging 26-27. I started working on OLL then while my times<br>
continued to drop. I learned the OLL algs in a little over a month,<br>
and by that point my F2L was still getting better and I was averaging<br>
about 23-24 seconds. For the past two weeks or so, I&#x27;ve just been<br>
working on using all the Fridrich algs. On July 31, I got my first<br>
ever sub 20 average. Since then I&#x27;ve gotten 4 more sub 20 averages<br>
(best is 19.60), and I consistenly average around 21 seconds. I&#x27;m<br>
very confident that with some more practice, I&#x27;ll be able to average<br>
sub 20 all the time.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that should give you an idea of how things have gone for me.<br>
Just keep practicing, and don&#x27;t be lazy with learning algs, and<br>
eventually you&#x27;ll get to being sub 20. Good luck, and have fun.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys!<br>
Yeah, after one month off internet, I&#x27;m finally back... I just attended an orchestra camp in Michigan, in case anyone cares where I was, it was fun but the orchestra sucked very, very badly, they had me play with the faculty orchestra and even that one was particularly bad. ANYWAY there were about 1200 kids there (yeah, orchestra was only one of the numerous majors there), but no need to say I was THE attraction of the camp, sadly not for my (*ahum*) amazing cello skills but for my cubing, which eventually became annoying after a while. I started to keep track on a notebook of every single time I got the stickers quote or the &quot;is there a pattern to it&quot; one but I lost count after a while (or got bored or both). Not talking about, I&#x27;ve done it once, I can do one side, oh dude that&#x27;s freakin&#x27;awesome and so on. You know&#x27;em all.<br>
So basically there was that camp store, where they started selling cubes after I went to the talent show. They had some of these keychain-like cubes, only crappier and with the worst color scheme ever. It even says Made in china on one of the dark yellow corners (yep the scheme is like, dark yellow, light yellow, light blue, purple-ish, red/orange, green and pink duh). I so should get royalties from them, they&#x27;re making money out of my talent. Not fair. Not talking about how I was giving cello lessons to the kids there... anyway. Yeah, so I stayed 2 sessions there, went to the talent show the first time and did an horrible 23s 2-handed solve on stage, like, with a guy and his stopwatch next to me (the guy was huge, I was probably scared, like, a lumberjack or something). So i messed up the cross and the F2L and did 2 PLL, horrible. But I was still way faster than anyone the audience had ever seen before so it was cool. When I got back to the dorms, the counselor was like, it&#x27;s the<br>
 slowest solve I&#x27;ve ever seen you doing, but it was still awesome, so I guess I enjoyed doing it anyway. During the second session, I guess they must&#x27;ve heard I had the European record for a while or something, but I got a note from the administration, they wanted me to do the cube one-handed this time. Oh well. But I&#x27;m like, you know, having a guy standing alone on stage for 40s solving a rubik&#x27;s cube is pretty boring and quite long though, plus since I haven&#x27;t practiced for at least 2 months one-handed and it&#x27;s not my usual OH cube, it might even get up to 50s, but they say, no, the kids&#x27;re gonna love it. Ok. So this time, I dressed in black, with a very tight black t-shirt inside-out (yeah the outside said &quot;I love Detroit&quot; or something like that, not my shirt... too tight for me, but with the distance noone could guess I have no muscle...), took my Neo sunglasses with me on stage in my pocket and put some good Matrix music, and when the music started, I put my glasses on and<br>
 started solving the cube one-handed. Everyone was screaming, that was so awesome... did quite well on this one, 36s. I was &quot;THE&quot; man... The music and the sunglasses worked perfectly with it.<br>
The sad part of it, besides the comments &quot;hey are you the cube dude&quot; or &quot;did you know that the cube has been invented like, 50 years ago?&quot;, was all the ppl asking me to solve their crappy piece of shit they bought off the camp store I didn&#x27;t even want to even touch (unless the person asking it was a girl and very very cute). We also have a dance at the end of each session, and I guess the cubing has been part of my success here... I should upload that picture of me solving the cube above my head while I&#x27;m dancing, it&#x27;s hilarious... Oh and yes, while I was playing in the faculty/staff orchestra, we had that one piece (Ravel&#x27;s Bolero for those who know it, it&#x27;s roughly 18 minutes of straight C-GC-GC-GC-GC-G.....etc. for the cellos), very boring, where you don&#x27;t even need both hands for playing, so I just plucked my cello as a guitar and solved the cube with the other hand, when I wasn&#x27;t teaching the counselor next to me how to solve it.<br>
Last couple of factoids and then I&#x27;ll pretty much be done about my random babbling about my camp experience. 1. do not take your best speedcube out with you at the pool, and 2. Coca-cola is not a good lubricant. A jackass spilled coke all over my bag and it ate the plastic of my cube away, it&#x27;s horrible. It doesn&#x27;t turn anymore. Never seen that before.<br>
Oh very last thing. I hate you guys. I forgot to change my preferences before I left, so I kept receiving the emails in my regular box. Result: 942 new emails when I got back yesterday. still a bit over 300 to go. Go figure.<br>
j/k. I love you all.<br>

PS. But still... 942...<br>

Someone on here suggested cutting the tabs off the centre caps and 
you will have to glue them on, just don&#x27;t use too much glue so 
getting them off isn&#x27;t too hard.
Silicone spray isn&#x27;t hard to find, I bought some from Kmart.

Hey Pedro,

Hey Pedro,

I am not yet sub-20, but here is an idea of my progress once I began
&quot;speedcubing&quot;

Feb. 7 - Switch from cross on top to cross on bottom, begin learning
F2L instead of first layer corners -> middle edges
-- 2 week break from learning --
Mid-March - (2 weeks) - Learn PLL
-- 2 week break from learning --
Begin taking averages with Fridrich for first time! :)
Mid-April - (6 weeks, noncontinuous) - Learn OLL
-- 6 week break from learning --
Mid-July - (2 weeks) - Learn COLL
Late July - (2 days) - Learn VH edge control (connected first day,
non-connected second day)

Just over five months after I started learning Fridrich, I got the
average that currently stands as my best, 23.49 seconds.  Like
everybody says, it&#x27;s all about the F2L.  My F2L sucks (17-18 second
avg?), and it&#x27;s the only reason why I&#x27;m not sub-20...maybe if I
practiced for more than 3 hours per week? :(

Don&#x27;t learn all LL algs from the same place.  That&#x27;s bad.  There are
TONS of sites with different LL algs, and some will fit you better
than others.

Does this help?  Everybody is different, you know that. :P

Remember, a 4-look LL with a lightning fast F2L is faster than a
crappy F2L with a 2-look LL. ;) (I don&#x27;t listen :\)

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Scott. For me, blue and green are more similar than blue and white. I haven&#x27;t had a white opposite blue cube on my hands, but I think it is kinda strange...And I don&#x27;t like the idea of having a white/yellow/orange corner or a blue/green/red one.

My opinion:
I perceive white and yellow to be the brightest colors on my cube,
so I like having yellow opposite white on my cube. I feel that it
(in Fridrich style solving) helps first in f2l recognition (using
white) and then in OLL recognition (using yellow) since those colors
stand out the most from the others. I also like the idea of having
similar colors (white/yellow, blue/green, red/orange) opposite one
another. I think that it helps me with PLL recognition.

Take a look at Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s suggestion for using paper to hold 
the caps in place. I recently tried it with my DIY cube and I like 
it. Take look at messages #16940 and 17455 in this group to learn 
more about it.

Peace,
Scott

P.S. My current best average is just barely sub-30, so don&#x27;t take
my post as expert testimony. I&#x27;m curious to hear other people&#x27;s
ideas on the color issue.

Jason Baum &lt;speedrunningcuber@...> escreveu:Hi Pedro,

I&#x27;ve been cubing for about 11 months now. I&#x27;ve gotten 5 sub 20
averages so far, and I can average about 21 seconds consistently once
I&#x27;m warmed up. I was using a very basic 7 step LBL method for about 7
months probably. I didn&#x27;t really practice that much, just when I was
bored in my spare time really, but eventually I could consistenly
average 30 seconds using that crappy method (best average was 27.94).
Then I started getting bored at using the same thing and I decided I
wanted to get faster, so I started learning PLL. It took me about 3
weeks to learn them all. I used just this method for about a month
and was averaging under 30 seconds with it. I went to the Horace Mann
tournament using this, and that REALLY sparked my motivation to get
faster. As soon as I got home from the tournament, I started learning
F2L. It took about two weeks to get through the algs (I had a hard
time seeing things intuitively at first), and I was very frustrated
because I was averaging about 40 seconds. It was really tough for me
to see the pairs for a while. But suddently I just started gradually
improving, and within a few days really I went from averaging 40 to
averaging 26-27. I started working on OLL then while my times
continued to drop. I learned the OLL algs in a little over a month,
and by that point my F2L was still getting better and I was averaging
about 23-24 seconds. For the past two weeks or so, I&#x27;ve just been
working on using all the Fridrich algs. On July 31, I got my first
ever sub 20 average. Since then I&#x27;ve gotten 4 more sub 20 averages
(best is 19.60), and I consistenly average around 21 seconds. I&#x27;m
very confident that with some more practice, I&#x27;ll be able to average
sub 20 all the time.

Anyway, that should give you an idea of how things have gone for me.
Just keep practicing, and don&#x27;t be lazy with learning algs, and
eventually you&#x27;ll get to being sub 20. Good luck, and have fun.

-Jason

Is tarted cubing in late 2002 with Petrus&#x27; method. Until december last 
year I didn&#x27;t cube wery seriously even thou my average was 28,51. Then 
I descided to start cubing more seriously and to change method to 
Fridrich. I learn all F2L-algs in about 4 weeks. Then in April 3 
months later I knew PLL and 8 OLL-cases and my average record was then 
22,44. Kow I finally know all 57 OLL-cases and average 18,84. So it 
took me approximately 8 months to learn Fridrich&#x27;s method, but I was 
familiar with the cube before.

I never would have guessed that someone made a vegetable oil-based

You can &quot;sand&quot; something, like wood or plastic, smooth using
&quot;sandpaper,&quot; which is a tough paper which has sand-like grit covering
one side. It comes in different grades from coarse to fine.

Hey Pedro,

Those times are very normal for your system and your experience. It 
is actually very similar to my situation when I was cubing for two 
months! So keep on going like this, and you will be fine. If you 
ever want my help, just use the &#x27;contact&#x27; option on my site.

At this point, my tip about solving the cube very slowly (number 1) 
is pretty important. Try to find your own shortcuts for the F2L.

Just to clarify: Those were two independent statements. My lube is

I don&#x27;t mean to belittle the problem, I had the same issue for a

anymore.  

I agree that this is a problem with using the stackmat 2 in 
competition.  If there was a way to put a raised barrier of acryllic

problem for people who aren&#x27;t used to it.

          <div class="email-content">yeah I told you the cubes were crappy... :-p
Seems i forgot how to count. No wonder I couldn&#x27;t remember the last color... No pink then. But still. Crappy. Told you.
Oh and btw, I found a funny way to couter at least the first 2 questions they ask you...
Non-cuber: OH MY GOD, how do you do that?
Cuber (looking bored): hmmm by turning the faces...
Non-cuber: no but I mean, what&#x27;s your trick?
Cuber: I use the Force...
So by the end of the camp, everyone called me Darth Rubik, I heard they even made a song about me.
Oh and there was that joke going around camp, but it&#x27;s so lame i don&#x27;t even want to put it up there... The punch line is so stupid...
Although since there were quite a few jokes around here about Swedes and Norwegian... Ok, so here we go: &quot;if you&#x27;re French before and after you&#x27;ve solved the cube, what are you while you&#x27;re solving it?&quot;
&quot;Cubin&#x27;...&quot;

Thanks for sharing, very funny experiences you had :-)

So, they had cubes with 7 colors? Hehe ;-)

waw, you&#x27;ve learned so much and you are not yet sub-20 ?
I only know 20/22 PLL and 30/57 OLL and no other system for the LL and
I did a 20.97, I guess this is because of my F2L :-)

I started Frifrich 4 months ago (very odd method at the beginning :
edge first :s) and you should definitely practice more ;-)

I started cubing in April 2004. My father taught me LBL-method. At the 
beginning  my times were about 4 minutes with very bad cube. At the 
end of May I learned Dan Knight&#x27;s 4-look LL in two days. In mid-June 
my average was around 1 minute. Then I learned PLL, and in July my 
averages were about 40 seconds. And then I started learning F2L.
I think it was 16.8.04 when I got 38.xx avg. In September I learned 
OLOLL and got my average record to 22 seconds. 7.10.04 I did 21.4 sec 
avg, and then my improving stopped. In November-December I broke two 
cubes. I smashed them to floor because I was so close to average 
record. In mid-December I finally broke my record and got 20.54 avg.
In mid-January I did my first (rolling)sub-20 averge 19.96.
And now my best time is 12 seconds and avg 16.51.

Hard to avg sub-20 with a 17-second F2L ;)  Still working on that
sub-3 LL. ;) (just kidding, of course).

22 PLL?  I hope you&#x27;re not counting the solved case. It would be
difficult not to know how to solve that one. ;)

play with the faculty orchestra and even that one was particularly
bad. ANYWAY there were about 1200 kids there (yeah, orchestra was only
one of the numerous majors there), but no need to say I was THE
attraction of the camp, sadly not for my (*ahum*) amazing cello skills
but for my cubing, which eventually became annoying after a while. I
started to keep track on a notebook of every single time I got the
stickers quote or the &quot;is there a pattern to it&quot; one but I lost count
after a while (or got bored or both). Not talking about, I&#x27;ve done it
once, I can do one side, oh dude that&#x27;s freakin&#x27;awesome and so on. You
know&#x27;em all.

cubes after I went to the talent show. They had some of these
keychain-like cubes, only crappier and with the worst color scheme
ever. It even says Made in china on one of the dark yellow corners
(yep the scheme is like, dark yellow, light yellow, light blue,
purple-ish, red/orange, green and pink duh). I so should get royalties
from them, they&#x27;re making money out of my talent. Not fair. Not
talking about how I was giving cello lessons to the kids there...
anyway. Yeah, so I stayed 2 sessions there, went to the talent show
the first time and did an horrible 23s 2-handed solve on stage, like,
with a guy and his stopwatch next to me (the guy was huge, I was
probably scared, like, a lumberjack or something). So i messed up the
cross and the F2L and did 2 PLL, horrible. But I was still way faster
than anyone the audience had ever seen before so it was cool. When I
got back to the dorms, the counselor was like, it&#x27;s the

so I guess I enjoyed doing it anyway. During the second session, I
guess they must&#x27;ve heard I had the European record for a while or
something, but I got a note from the administration, they wanted me to
do the cube one-handed this time. Oh well. But I&#x27;m like, you know,
having a guy standing alone on stage for 40s solving a rubik&#x27;s cube is
pretty boring and quite long though, plus since I haven&#x27;t practiced
for at least 2 months one-handed and it&#x27;s not my usual OH cube, it
might even get up to 50s, but they say, no, the kids&#x27;re gonna love it.
Ok. So this time, I dressed in black, with a very tight black t-shirt
inside-out (yeah the outside said &quot;I love Detroit&quot; or something like
that, not my shirt... too tight for me, but with the distance noone
could guess I have no muscle...), took my Neo sunglasses with me on
stage in my pocket and put some good Matrix music, and when the music
started, I put my glasses on and
>  started solving the cube one-handed. Everyone was screaming, that
was so awesome... did quite well on this one, 36s. I was &quot;THE&quot; man...
The music and the sunglasses worked perfectly with it.
> The sad part of it, besides the comments &quot;hey are you the cube dude&quot;
or &quot;did you know that the cube has been invented like, 50 years ago?&quot;,
was all the ppl asking me to solve their crappy piece of shit they
bought off the camp store I didn&#x27;t even want to even touch (unless the
person asking it was a girl and very very cute). We also have a dance
at the end of each session, and I guess the cubing has been part of my
success here... I should upload that picture of me solving the cube
above my head while I&#x27;m dancing, it&#x27;s hilarious... Oh and yes, while I
was playing in the faculty/staff orchestra, we had that one piece
(Ravel&#x27;s Bolero for those who know it, it&#x27;s roughly 18 minutes of
straight C-GC-GC-GC-GC-G.....etc. for the cellos), very boring, where
you don&#x27;t even need both hands for playing, so I just plucked my cello
as a guitar and solved the cube with the other hand, when I wasn&#x27;t
teaching the counselor next to me how to solve it.
> Last couple of factoids and then I&#x27;ll pretty much be done about my
random babbling about my camp experience. 1. do not take your best
speedcube out with you at the pool, and 2. Coca-cola is not a good
lubricant. A jackass spilled coke all over my bag and it ate the
plastic of my cube away, it&#x27;s horrible. It doesn&#x27;t turn anymore. Never
seen that before.

bit over 300 to go. Go figure.

First off:
> l&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U R U&#x27; l U R&#x27; U&#x27; L U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F

wow!!!  that alg is really nice!  The trigger R U&#x27; L U R&#x27; is very 
fast, and the R U&#x27; l U R&#x27; is an easy extension of that.

I&#x27;ve also had the same thing you have with error prone algs.

One of my ZBLL algs is (U) (L&#x27; U2) [L (U) (L&#x27; U&#x27;)] [R (U&#x27;) L (U) R&#x27;] 
(L&#x27; U2) L

This alg feels very nice now that I have practiced it a lot, but when 
I first tried it I locked up very badly _every_ time I did it.  The 
transition between the [L (U) (L&#x27; U&#x27;)] and [R (U&#x27;) L (U) R&#x27;] was 
particularly brutal at first.

Also I tend to look for algs that have the [R (U&#x27;) L (U) R&#x27;] trigger 
in them becuase it is so fast!  For that trigger I do the (U&#x27;) with my 
left index finger and the (U) with my right index finger.

I really like your E perm alg, I think it could be very fast!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan here&#x27;s how I do the second alg:

[(l&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27;) (U)] [R (U&#x27;) l (U)] [R&#x27; (U&#x27;) L (U)] [R (U&#x27;) l&#x27; (U)]

My notation (U) or (U&#x27;) means to do that turn with the index finger of 
the opposite hand used for the previous turn.  So [(l&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27;) (U)] the 
(U) means to do the (U) with the right hand since the left hand is the 
one used for the first part.

[R (U&#x27;) l (U)] : means the (U&#x27;) with the left hand (opposite of the R 
just before it) and the (U) with the right hand opposite of the l just 
before it.

What do you think?  I think it is better to split up the R U&#x27; l U R&#x27; 
as I did above as I think that makes the ending flow better and a bit 
faster.

How do you do this one?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I think we both do it pretty much the same way :-)

I also pull the U/U&#x27; turns with the index fingers all the time, and i 
do tilt the cube a bit for the last two turns so it&#x27;s almost like your 
l&#x27; U ending.

Not sure I&#x27;m able to agree or disagree with splitting it up the way 
you did, after practicing it a while, it now feels like one long 
fluent motion (well, after the first three moves which still are a bit 
slow).

I got a lot of low 11s already for doing it four times in a row, I 
didn&#x27;t even get close to that with my previous alg. Once I would&#x27;ve 
had 10.5 or so but I screwed up stopping the stopwatch :-(

Just made two videos, slow and fast:

http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/foo/E_PLL_slow.wmv (394 KB)
http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/foo/E_PLL_fast.wmv (257 KB)

If I don&#x27;t count the initial regrip, the fast version is a 2 seconds 
execution.

Cheers!

Wow..that&#x27;s my new E-perm. This is fast! Thanks for sharing.

P.S. -> And so far about 50% of my attempts at doing the alg fast have

Doing it a bunch of times, I only wound up with a half solved cube  
the first time around. I can understand mixing the alg up though -  
the guts of it really only contains L (l), U and R twists and it  
seems it&#x27;d be very easy to mix one of these up. I think this alg will  
be blazing fast once committed to muscle memory...

Maybe you practice algs to much and speed to little!? I take my time 
learning algs, and that way I get a lot of solves for each new alg 
that I learn. It also give my more F2L practice which, as you 
already know, is the key to great times. I won&#x27;t be learning CLL 
before I master OLL perfectly, which means another one or two months 
of practice.

<br>
My question is, how do they determine this?  The latest DIY kits <br>
with PVC stickers do not include the Rubik logo on the central white <br>
sticker.  Granted one of the center caps has an embossed logo but <br>
you can&#x27;t really see it once the stickers are applied.<br>
<br>
The latest cubes all seem to have some kind of lot number printed <br>
inside one of the corners (visible at a 45 degree twist).  For <br>
example, mine says M0105B (presumably manufactured January 2005?)  <br>
But their older cubes did not have this feature.<br>
<br>
Would they allow a classic 80&#x27;s Ideal cube?<br>
<br>
Do they disassemble your cube to verify its authenticity somehow?  <br>
To me there would be no way to really tell some of the clones apart <br>
from the real thing.<br>
<br>
One other thought-- are the Rubik&#x27;s brand white plastic cubes <br>
allowed?<br>
<br>
I plan to use a DIY cube, so no worries.  I was just curious about <br>
that rule as well.<br>

Hey, mistakes happen. I did not state I do it every solve, so 
obviously I am capable of hitting the timer pad with my hands.  It 
is just like I can turn the cube at 8 moves a second at times, but 
sometimes I lock it up.   In fact I am sure you can find more than 
one of the top cubers in the world that has accidentally dropped his 
or her cube once while solving.  Mistakes happen.  Add high pressure 
to the situation and one may be more likely to be inaccurate as 
well.  And all I said was I was worried, not that I should not be 
disqualified.   Also, I am also not a sub 20 cuber, so I do have 
more to learn in all areas. Thanks for your input.

I don&#x27;t really practice algs that much, pretty much only when I&#x27;m
walking on my way to class or something like that when I should be
watching where I&#x27;m going. ;) Since there is nothing that I feel is
critical for me to learn, I decided that it will be pure F2L practice
from now until I am sub-20, and then I will consider tackling
something new.

          <div class="email-content">To be technical, the only sticker that needed to be swapped was the

          <div class="email-content">In the past, stopwatches were a safety precaution, and the times 
recorded were only to be used in the event of a solve that takes longer 
than 10min (longer than what the stackmat can record).  Now that we have 
time limits for each phase, (I think we do... right?), the stopwatches 
are no longer used to follow the solve.  Their only purpose now is for 
the 15s preinspection phase.

          <div class="email-content">lol.. sounds a lot like my camp experience... which i will share with
the world, because im bored and its kinda funny

basically it was me and two other guys who signed up to solve the cube
for our talent show. i showed up at the audition place and solved it
in 19 seconds (which btw was my 3rd sub-20 time i had ever got.) at
the actual talent show, one of my friends was in charge of creating
music (he has this thing called the electribe, which basically is a
beat synthesizer... its a beast), and he created some music to start
us off. the MCs for the talent show then went on stage and threw out
three cubes into the audience for them to mix up. then the mc comes
back with my friends&#x27; cubes and they go up and both solve half of it
and in the middle switch cubes and solve each other&#x27;s cube (it took a
little long for them though, because they&#x27;er not speedcubers and they
were supposed to communicate to each other in some way when they were
done, but something got lost in translation, so they spent about 30
extra seconds just messing around because they didnt know that the
other was already done). all in all it took them like 2 minutes or so,
which is still faster than anyone had camp (except those who knew me)
had ever seen. in the meantime, the MC that had my cube came back with
it all broken, because some kid accidently popped a couple of pieces.
so i had to frantically put it back together and solve it really
quickly to makd sure that i had put it in the right way. then i had to
get someone in the back to scramble it for me (so they would be sure
that i hadn&#x27;t rigged it or anything). then i came onstage with my
hoodie and polarized sunglasses and solved it in about 25 seconds
(messed up on the cross and f2l and had a near pop). it was really
cool because all of my friends had incited the crowd to chant my
name.. though i actually didnt hear it because i was so nervous.

man, its fun though :)

Mmh, we could of course also mirror F&lt;->B to get this:
l U L U&#x27; R&#x27; U l&#x27; U&#x27; R U L&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U l U&#x27;

I thought about this because I don&#x27;t really like to regrip at the 
start. Btw, just in case somebody is curious, here&#x27;s how I found the 
alg:

1. ACube searching in &lt;U,L,R,F> spits out (among lots of others):
U F&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F R&#x27; F&#x27; L F R U&#x27;

2. I remove U/U&#x27; at start/end and rewrite like this:
(F&#x27; R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) (L&#x27; U) (R U&#x27;) (l&#x27; U R&#x27; U&#x27;) (L U l)

3. Because I don&#x27;t like to start with F&#x27;, I invert it:
l&#x27; U&#x27; L&#x27; U R U&#x27; l U R&#x27; U&#x27; L U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F

I like the F&lt;->B mirror as well and will practice it a bit, but I 
guess I&#x27;ll stick to the &quot;original&quot;.

Hey Bob

I actually really like that algorithm. I used to use one that was 
similar, but yours changes at the u2&#x27; (I believe I got it off of 
Jesse Bond&#x27;s site). But I really like the flow of yours, so I 
switched to that one a few weeks ago.  I struggled with the u2&#x27; as 
well at first, but now I use my index finger, as I am brining that 
last R&#x27; up, I place I on the right yellow edge and push down, then 
the rest just flies.  Thanks for that, by the way. 

Now if only I could find a better alg for your PLL case 4.  I will 
have to try yours out, but I am not a fan of slice moves most of the 
time.

I suppose you wouldn&#x27;t like the (also fast) algorithm:

M2&#x27;UM&#x27;U2M2&#x27;U2M&#x27;U&#x27;M2&#x27; ? :P

I kind of like it.

Whoa, I actually managed to typed gibberish there. Impressive.  That 
was supposed to read,  &quot;as I am bringing the last R&#x27; up, I place my 
right index finger on the yellow edge and push down&quot;.

If I could do those slice moves as fast as you, I would probably enjoy 
that as well. I have no idea how you do that, though.  I must admit, I 
have been using your first one [ x&#x27; F (R U&#x27;) (R&#x27; Ua) (R&#x27; e) (R&#x27; U) (R 
D2) ] and it is not as bad as I thought it was going to be.  After a 
couple of minutes I have hit a few low 3 second attempts, so with some 
practice to where I don&#x27;t have to think about it, I should be able do 
it around 2 seconds, which is good for me.  I am going to have to root 
through the rest of your algs to look for replacements for a couple 
other sluggish ones I use.

M&#x27; is very simple, but people don&#x27;t like it.  Hold the cube with the
thumbs on the (front of the) L and R layers and the other fingers on
the back face of the same layers.  Use the left ring finger and push
the middle slice to make it M&#x27;.  For M2&#x27;, follow it with the middle
finger. :)

right now I do pretty much the F&lt;->B mirror (I think, haven&#x27;t checked

R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F R U R&#x27; F R&#x27; F&#x27; R U&#x27; R

It&#x27;s slightly awkward but at least I never regrip with the left hand 
and that&#x27;s a strong plus for me. Well, I do tilt the cube with the 
left hand a bit near the end. Haven&#x27;t practiced it much yet, though, 
I&#x27;m usually around 12 seconds.

Hey Darereck,

I use z U&#x27;(RD&#x27;) (R2&#x27;UR&#x27;D)  U&#x27;(RD&#x27;)(R2&#x27;UR&#x27;D) [R]

Here is how I do it:
Pull the first U&#x27; with the left index finger
When starting the R, hold your right index finger on the BRU corner, 
so you can make the D&#x27; afterwards.
I make the (R2&#x27;UR&#x27;D) move while holding one corner with my right 
index and middlefinger, which is the FRD piece. It goes all around 
the R face, finaly ending at BRD.

Hope it helps,

Joël.

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
Tyson and I created a draft version of the WCA regulations, version <br>
2005.<br>
You can find the draft version at:<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/events/regulations_draft2005.html<br>
<br>
Our goals for this version were to not change the basic rules and <br>
procedures, but improve the text and remove unclear things.<br>
On the bottom of the page you can find a list of changes.<br>
<br>
You are all very welcome to send in your comments, additions and <br>
other suggestions. For your feedback please use the WCA forum at<br>
http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum<br>
If you want to see text or regulations changed, then please post a <br>
new text proposal.<br>
<br>
We want to finalize this version on September 5, 2 months before WC <br>
2005. So don&#x27;t wait too long with your feedback.<br>
<br>
We are looking forward to a positive discussion. We expect that <br>
there won&#x27;t be a consensus on all issues. In that case the WCA board <br>
will need to make a decision. For the 2006 version we are open to <br>
discuss some bigger changes.<br>
<br>
Thanks and have fun,<br>

Finally I did it.<br>
It was a complete success. I have re-stringed my magic and made my own &quot;fishing wire&quot; loop string and it works fine!! <br>
I *just* followed the instructions in the web pages below... 8-)<br>
It is a hard work, but it is worth, I think.<br>

  Hi. I am sorry too..<br>
  you can rebuild it using fishing wire. but this is a hard thing to do yourself...<br>
  I have the same problem and until today I haven&#x27;t fixed it.<br>
  Time ago, rubiks.com offered magic DIY, but not now and I think it will never be on sale again.<br>
  I found some web pages were you can take some ideas on how to rebuild your magic.<br>
<br>

  http://twistypuzzles.com/articles/magic-super-master.shtml<br>
<br>
<br>
  The &#x27;only&#x27; thing you must do is to make your own strings with some fishing wire... I have not tried yet, but some day maybe. If you experience some advances, please inform me.<br>
<br>
  have fun...<br>

<br>
    I&#x27;ve learned something today : never use a Magic whom doesn&#x27;t have all<br>
    his strings.<br>
<br>
    It just felt completely apart as 2 others strings broke.<br>
<br>
    So I have to rebuild it completely :-(<br>
<br>
    The thing is that I don&#x27;t know how to do that and the booklet doesn&#x27;t<br>
    explain how to rebuild it...<br>
    Could you explain me how to put back all the strings (I have to make<br>
    new ones) or give me an address where I can find that ?<br>
<br>
    Thanks<br>
<br>
    (hopefully I&#x27;ll have a new one on monday :p)<br>

Hi Bryan,

They have adjusting screws. You need to remove the tiles to get at the
screws. 

I use a *very* sharp 5/8 inch wood chisel and so I wear work gloves. I
push the edge of the chisel under the tile as far as it can go, which
really isn&#x27;t very far, but is important, then I begin gently rocking
the tile back and forth. I sometimes find I need to be patient, and
gradually the glue lets go.

You need to determine which is the correct side to try to lever up so
that you aren&#x27;t working against the structure of the tile and the
trough it sits in. There is a trough underneath every tile which has
two slanted indentations and two straight edges. 

The underside of the tile has two straight edges and two slanted
edges, and fit neatly into the indentations. These edges are shallow.
The straight edges lay flat against the trough in the cube and if you
try to lever that way you would bend or break the plastic of the tile.
The slanted edges move like a rocker with no resistance. Also the
slanted edges are where the glue is and they are the right edges to
try to pry up. 

You may see slight indentations on the top of the tile, at the edge.
Underneath the indentation is the slanted edge. Those are the edges
you need to pry. 

I hope this helps. 

David J

Haha, when you asked this I already feared I&#x27;m not alone. But I was.

There was no silver or 25th anniversary cube at WC 2003. ;)

I never stated that it is a rule at this competition because I do not
know that.  I&#x27;d be the wrong person to ask.

I only do that when it helps the flow of the algorithm better, like if
the R&#x27; leads into the next move better than the M&#x27;.

          <div class="email-content">I perform all of my M, M&#x27;, and M2 moves that way, because they are always

M2&#x27; U M2&#x27; U M&#x27; U2 M2&#x27; U2 M&#x27; U2.

(insert several minutes here)

I&#x27;ve just discovered that speedcubing.com has a similar algorithm, which is 
a move shorter, and I think, after playing with it, I&#x27;ll wind up with this:

M2&#x27; U M&#x27; U2&#x27; M2&#x27; U2&#x27; M&#x27; U&#x27; M2&#x27;

I do all of the U2 turns as a click with my left index finger followed by 
the left middle finger.  It will be fast, methinks. =)

Thoughts?

I guess you didn&#x27;t read all the back posts yet. ;)

http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/18633

I posted the alg: M2&#x27; U M&#x27; U2 M2&#x27; U2 M&#x27; U&#x27; M2&#x27;

I actually do the U2 in the clockwise direction because I use my left
hand for the slices. ;)

~ Bob

...not that I actually use that algorithm (yet?).  But I can do it
pretty fast. :D  My current alg is just over 2 seconds.

          <div class="email-content">Back when I was still using a 4-look last layer, I only had to know 3  
PLLs (well you only actually have to know 1, but knowing 3 helps) and  
up until now I was still using the same one. It was by far my slowest  
case but I don&#x27;t tend to see it that often. It was from Fridrich&#x27;s  
site :  Ls Ds2 Ls D   Ls2 U&#x27; Bs2 (Ds2 is horrible...)

I was actually thinking the other day that I should try and find a  
new one. The PLL which handles opposite edges can be sub-2 easily,  
and this one is rather similar, so I definitely think it can be as well.

By the way, I think me and you have a similar cubing style,  
especially for LL - for PLL I used to collect algs from various  
websites but found that nearly all the ones on your site are best for  
my hands. (except I really don&#x27;t like your U perm [cycle 3 edges], I  
can do 1.2s with mine)

Which is also the mirrored case. If you allow mirrors, you could get 
away with either the R or J perm to solve both corners and edges.

All right, I&#x27;m not being very practical. :D

I&#x27;m glad that the knife worked. None I tried which could get in there
were strong enough. 
Any cube for which Mr Rubik was paid a royalty is allowed. They just
don&#x27;t want counterfeits.

          <div class="email-content">Ah, ok... the way you had said it made me think you were saying one 
PLL (algorithm) would be enough to solve all PLL (cases), i.e. not 
just edge-PLL but also corners. And I tried a few and didn&#x27;t succeed. 
Is there an easy proof that one PLL alg, applied repeatedly to the 
last layer and with U adjustments allowed, is not enough to solve all 
PLL cases? Oh, and... is that actually true?

You can actually get away with knowing zero PLL algs if you wanted. 
You can use OLL algs to cycle edges by doing an OLL that doesn&#x27;t
disturb corner permutation and then fixing it with another OLL that
restores the OLL but is not the exact inverse of the original OLL.

Example:  Sune - U - Sune Mirrored U&#x27; cycles three edges.

The corners can of course be permuted without any algs using simple
intuition. :)

          <div class="email-content">Yeah what I was saying was for a 4-look LL, where you fix the corners  
and only have to permute edges.

As far as one PLL for all cases, that&#x27;s curious....
If it IS possible, we could limit it to only PLLs that move edges and  
corners.
I&#x27;m going to play around with it.

bad and my cousin couldn&#x27;t speak English at all. After trying
unsuccessfully to explain the notation to him, I gave up and drew all
the turns for the algs on a piece of paper. On the steps that didn&#x27;t
require algs, I was like &quot;turn this way, then this way, then this way,
then this way...&quot; while turing the cube to let him see (and he was
teasing me because of that). I was able to teach him how to solve it
that way.

For non-cubers even sub-1 minute avg is incredible ?=)

As I mentioned before, J or R will do, provided you supplement it with 
its mirror.  Still believe that is correct, but haven&#x27;t checked how 
many/few applications you would need in the worst case.

I remember being ranked better than what I am ranked now, yet my best
was 30+ instead of 17.xx. :)

Yeah, if you add the mirror it&#x27;s of course easy, but I&#x27;m interested in 
just the alg alone (plus U adjustments).

Btw, the G perm and its mirror would also be enough:

F U F&#x27; L2 D&#x27; B U&#x27; B&#x27; U B&#x27; D L2
U&#x27;
F&#x27; U&#x27; F R2 D B&#x27; U B U&#x27; B D&#x27; R2
U

I think I can see a fairly simple proof of impossibility, if the 
sequence has to be a PLL.  But must check...

          <div class="email-content">Yes.. There are many cool quotes in those archives.

How about this newsflash:

&quot;Justin Vining breaks the Unofficial World Record for Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2 
average. The new record is 15.06 seconds. There is still room for 
improvement!&quot;

          <div class="email-content">About Stefan&#x27;s question:
If you allow mirror algs, several different PLL algs
can be used.  However, if mirrors are not allowed,
then one may reason as follows:
First, the alg must obviously permute both edges and
corners.  Otherwise, cases that permute both would be
impossible to solve.
Second, if the alg only switches a pair of edges and a
pair of corners, neither the edges nor the corners can
be opposite because this would make 3-cycles of that
type of piece impossible to solve.
This leaves the L, R, and G PLLs.  L can be ruled out
because each edge and corner next to it are permuted
together and cannot be separated.  R can similarly be
ruled out by thinking of the separate pairs that are
permuted &quot;together&quot; (ex. UFL/UR and UFR/UB).  G, on
the other hand, might work.  I tried it several times
and repeatedly made edge and corner 3-cycles (which
would be enough to solve PLL), but I can&#x27;t be sure
because I often (accidentally) did the mirror of the
alg.

anyway, I donno if anyone&#x27;s mentioned this already, I&#x27;m guessing no,<br>
so.  a couple weeks ago my family and I went to Silverwood, a theme<br>
park near Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho.  At the restaurant there they always<br>
have entertainment and stuff going on.  Today, they had a juggler, and<br>
I thought that was pretty awesome because I&#x27;m a bit of a juggler<br>
myself.  but what REALLY intrigued me is his final act was solving a<br>
rubiks cube WHILE juggling!!  so I thought that was totally awesome. <br>
it took him like five minutes, but still cool (:<br>
after the show I talked to him, of course I had my cube with me, so I<br>
got to show off properly.  So, he said that one of his friends told<br>
him about this guy on the internet who could solve a rubiks cube while<br>
juggling, and this kinda bummed him out, because he thought that he<br>
was the only guy to have done that.  so he looked online, of course it<br>
was Macky, and he downloaded the video and all.  But then he told me<br>
that he thinks Macky was CHEATING, because Macky&#x27;s not juggling and<br>
solving at the same time, he&#x27;s juggling two balls in one hand, and<br>
solving the cube in the other.  This performer was juggling all of<br>
them, going back and forth between the two hands, so the cube was in<br>
both his left and right hand an equal amount of time.<br>
<br>
so Macky, you should take that as a challenge, learn to do it right,<br>
you cheater (; just kiddin, I can&#x27;t even do it your way, much less<br>
while juggling all of them together.  just thought I&#x27;d share (:<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
With all these new young talented cubers around, I begin to feel <br>
old!!! :-(<br>
<br>
I was wondering whether age matters, like in other sports/hobbies.<br>
Is cubing more like swimming (most records set under age of 20) or <br>
marathon (for the older guys/girls)?<br>
<br>
&gt;From recent experiences and competitions I extracted the following <br>
observations:<br>
- young people&#x27;s addiction and dedication are stronger<br>
- young people have more spare time<br>
- young people learn faster<br>
- young people have speedier fingers and more dexterity<br>
- young people have fewer problems with nerves<br>
<br>
Am I right?<br>
<br>
Personally I spend too much time on the websites and organizing <br>
tournaments. I have a family and a busy job. Lots of excuses, but no <br>
excuse to perform badly in competitions.<br>
<br>
It looks like the young cubers are taking over!<br>

I had a very long discussion with Stefan, back in february.
We did NOT agree :-).
I&#x27;m 36 now, and have experienced learning cubing twice : 25 years
ago, and now. I&#x27;m 100% sure that my physical (including brain)
abilities have changed slightly in between.
It took me less than 1 month when I was 12 to reach around 36-40&#x27;&#x27;
avg, using a LBL method (around 100 moves). I was only cubing for
1 hour a day.
My dexterity has gone down today, even if I am sub29 now.
I&#x27;m sure that 25 years ago, if I had learnt the fridrich and spent
the same amount of time as today, I would be close to sub20.

> From recent experiences and competitions I extracted the following
> observations:

I&#x27;m not sure about this one. This has NOT changed for me.

> - young people have more spare time

That&#x27;s right.

> - young people learn faster

Definitely right. I&#x27;ve been teaching bridge to juniors (&lt; 25yo)
and elderly (> 60yo). These people have :
- the same motivation ;
- the same spare time (elderly having even more) ;
- the same education ;
Juniors learn lightning fast in comparison to elderly.

There&#x27;s also scientific evidence. There&#x27;s an excellent book (in
french :-() made by Alain Lieury (&quot;Psychologie de la mï¿½moire, histoire,
thï¿½orie, expï¿½riences&quot;, Dunod), in which scientifical studies
about decreases of cognitive abilities throughout the years
are presented. In cubing, I guess that short-term memory also
plays a huge role. It decreases regularly from age 20 till
death :-).

I think the only advantage that older people have over younger
maybe &quot;experience&quot;. They may be able to use their &quot;slightly&quot;
reduced capacities better than the younger... to a certain extent.


> - young people have speedier fingers and more dexterity

Maybe.
Muscle tone also decreases years after year.
But when I think about Glen Gould or Richter, I&#x27;m wondering
about loss of dexterity...

> - young people have fewer problems with nerves

I don&#x27;t think so.
This is IMO some part of all sports (being mindgames or true
sports) where you can work A LOT, not depending on ur age.
Nowadays, top competitors very often have a coach AND a
psy in order to cope with competition pressure, which can
devastate your abilities.

We share the same excuses. I don&#x27;t even attempt comps ;).

People less than 30 should have a 5&#x27;&#x27; handicap in comps, IMO.

          <div class="email-content">I have to agree with most of this.  My main experience is in chess where 
players tend to peak at about 30-32.  But there isnt the same physical 
element in chess so I think speedcubing probably favours the young slightly 
more.  There are examples of chess players (e.g. Korchnoi, Smyslov) playing 
very strong chess into their 70s - but even then they aren&#x27;t as good as in 
their youth.  Their vast experience compensates somewhat for a drop in speed 
of thought.  My feeling is that academics also suffer from a drop off as 
they age.  Most mathematicians produce their best work in their 20&#x27;s early 
30&#x27;s - that is their most creative work.  Experience in this field can 
provide much greater compensation for slower thought speed though.

If we had professional speedcubers then some of the other advantages of 
youth wouldnt be quite so pronounced - shame no-one will pay us a wage to 
speedcube
:(

I think nerves is more a personal thing than age related.  And for some 
people nerves can be a good thing.  I usually do better in competition or 
when demonstrating even though I get very nervous!

Still there are some very fast old cubers out there so don&#x27;t write us off. 
And we may be just as good at contributing to the theory!

If only I was 18 again (sigh).

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ron,

You may be right about some issue&#x27;s here.

- young people&#x27;s addiction and dedication are stronger.

You may be right.. But your dedication beats everybody ;).

- young people have more spare time

Yes.. That&#x27;s definately true.. I am very blessed with my spare time 
as a student, I guess.

- young people have speedier fingers and more dexterity

Hmm.. I don&#x27;t really know if this is true. People like Jessica 
Fridrich, Katsu, you, etc. also seem to be pretty dexterous (how do 
you spell that word?). I am not sure if there is a significant 
difference here.

- young people have fewer problems with nerves

On this point I have to disagree. I kinda believe the &#x27;nerves&#x27; issue 
is not influenced by age. Everybody gets nervous, but there are just 
some people who can &#x27;transform&#x27; that feeling into a 
positive &#x27;emotion&#x27;.

> It looks like the young cubers are taking over!
> (Except for the bigger cubes, still...)

Yes.. There are quite a few talented young cubers getting faster 
right now.. Maybe it&#x27;s because a lot of young people who get into 
cubing know to find their way around the internet better. And about 
the bigger cubes: I am working on the 4x4 a little right now... Hope 
to catch up with Koen and Michael sometime...

> PS: let us NOT start an [OldCubers Team] :-)

Whahaha! That&#x27;s just hilarious... :D LOL.

You don&#x27;t need to excuse yourself Ron. We all get nervous in 
competitions. I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to get rid of that 
feeling during competition (maybe I should get into &#x27;hypnotherapy&#x27;, 
LOL). One thing I do at home sometimes is just tell my self to go 
slower. Like I say &#x27;speedlimit: 3 moves/second&#x27;. Well not really 
that strict :)... Anyways, I did the same thing during my 14.99 
solve in Germany. It didn&#x27;t help me in every solve, but I believe 
that learning a fluent and &#x27;slow&#x27; kind of cubing style will pay off 
in competitions... (I don&#x27;t claim to be an expert with this of 
course).

See you @ Eindhoven ;),

Joël.

Can you tell us how he juggled? When I juggle three items, they&#x27;re 
always in my hand for maybe up to a half second. How can he do 3 moves 
with one hand in such a short amount of time?

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

Us veterans who have been cubing since those early days in 1980/81, 
we won&#x27;t win anything in competition by knowing theory of the cube. 
Sad but true ;-) 

However i find that my experience and theoretical insight gives me 
advantages on the larger cubes and particularly in fewest moves. So 
far i haven&#x27;t really seen any cubing &quot;prodigy&quot; doing well or 
consistently well in fewest moves. Or to put it another way. I 
haven&#x27;t really seen a top top class 3x3x3 speedcuber doing well in 
fewest moves. They are sufficiently incompatible to be very hard to 
master both :-) And im glad for that cause im a lousy 3x3x3 
speedcuber ;-)

Another benefit of being a true veteran is that we have dealt with 
the pleasures of cubing for a much longer time. We have had more 
fun ;-)

Cheers!

I thought to start a list the other day when I saw Charlie Sheen with
one in Being John Malkovich.

I&#x27;ll do that. Unless someone come up with with an old and more populated
list.

I made it home safe as well :)

It was nice meeting you as well as everyone else. A very memorable
experience. This just gets me more excited for the tournaments to
come.

I&#x27;d also like to thank Chris Hardwick for his help with bld last
night. I had two successful solves on the airplane. You rock :)

And Ian is going to drive me insane with the team blindfold. I have to
teach someone the cube here so I can team bld...

And to quote someone we all hold dear in our hearts: &quot;I hate Texas.&quot;

Rune Wesström must be in his early to middle 70s... but I don&#x27;t know if 
he is the oldest cuber here.

Oh, I dunno.  Correct placement of facial features?  Possibly 
educational for the very young.  In the old version, you had to add the 
features to your own, real potato -- sadly, even Mr Potato Head has 
been dumbed down. :D

Nice report, thanks :-)

You might wanna fix this, though:

&quot;While practicing the Magic, I got a few sub-1.2 second sovles, 
including a new personal best of 1.16.  Frank was excited to have 
witnesses of a sub-2 minute solve.&quot;

Cheers ;-)

LOL -- &quot;a natural high&quot; makes it sound like fun ;)

All I can say is that it was no longer a problem when I started 
puzzling &quot;seriously&quot; after a break of many years.  Perhaps I&#x27;m not 
trying hard enough. :)

Actually first I only saw the paper on the right, I recognized it&#x27;s

I just want to say that Bob Burton was downright amazing at Rubik&#x27;s<br>
Magic and Master Magic. I had never seen anyone do it before, so i was<br>
just amazed. It was great.<br>

Chris Hardwick was amazing with his 55.xx (cant remember) second solve<br>
on the 4x4x4, and Macky was amazing with his oh, Blindfolded, and<br>
speed solve.<br>

Everyone was just amazing<br>

          <div class="email-content">Even doing a layer method on the 3x3 you should be able to get under  
a minute.
Learning Fridrich F2L is very easy - it&#x27;s all intuitive. Learning the  
optimized algs is a little harder, but using intuitive method should  
ensure you are under a minute.

          <div class="email-content">Initially, I began one handing with my left hand, even though I&#x27;m a right 
handed person with everything else.  Somehow, my left hand was faster at it, 
and I&#x27;ve been working my times down to between 1:00 and 1:30.

The past few days, however, I&#x27;ve tried using my right hand and to great 
success.  I&#x27;m now even between my two hands, despite having only practiced 
occasionally and almost never with the right.  I&#x27;ve also noticed several 
things that have helped me improve immensely in the past few days.

For turns that are easy to perform in one direction, the inverse is often 
very difficult.  I used to resort to sort of pushing the face with my 
fingertip, but it was very slow.  I realized that it&#x27;s much easier to 
slightly shift where you grip the cube, and turn the opposite two layers.  
Example, since I&#x27;m certain that isn&#x27;t very clear:  U&#x27; is very hard for me in 
my right hand.  Instead, I now grab the U side, and then turn d&#x27; with my 
middle and ring fingers.

Also, I&#x27;ve learned that going slower than a two handed solve works wonders 
for looking ahead.  I can see easy ways to help with multislotting, and to 
orient LL edges on the third and fourth pairs.

I&#x27;ve noticed that often, however, COLL is not very helpful, except in 
certain very simple cases. I usually do better with my 3 look OLL/PLL.  
Perhaps once out of ten solves, I use a 4 look LL, because I have trouble 
with certain PLL cases one handed.  I try to use COLL when it comes up 
because it&#x27;s good practice, but with only one hand, I find the simple edge 
PLL&#x27;s are very difficult.  Also, a lot of my COLL algs use both slice and 
LUR moves, which are hard to reach with one hand.

Anywho, I&#x27;m not much of an expert, but these are just some of the things 
I&#x27;ve noticed in the past few days.

Well, I was over 50, when the cube came. Maybe my dexterity then had detoriated from what it was 25 years ago. Who knows?

Rune Wesström must be in his early to middle 70s... but I don&#x27;t know if 
he is the oldest cuber here.

I use pretty much the same algorithms - in fact I&#x27;ve recently taken to 
learning them one handed because I think you have to know them better that 
way!  (see chris Hardwick on OH amnesia!)
Also I&#x27;m right handed and seem pretty unusual in solving OH right handed 
too!

          <div class="email-content">For most cases I use the same algorithms.. But for some cases, it&#x27;s 
easy to choose a more OH-friedly algorithm. For example:

Two hands: RUR&#x27; F&#x27; RUR&#x27;U&#x27; R&#x27;F R2U&#x27; R&#x27;U&#x27;
One hand: U LU&#x27;R U2 L&#x27; U L U2 R&#x27;L&#x27;

I can do the last one pretty fast with one hand.. I kinda execute it 
with the U face on the right, so I can do the L moves with my left 
index, and some of the U moves with my (also left :)) ring finger. The 
last R&#x27;L&#x27; can be done at the same time this way :).

Other example:


Two hands: M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2
One hand: LR U2 L&#x27;R&#x27; y&#x27; L&#x27;R&#x27; U2 LR

These are of course just my personal preferences...

Haha, same here.  I never expected team BLD to be nearly as
fun/addicting as it is.  Once you start you can&#x27;t stop!

Nice report Bob!  I also had a great time at the tournament.  I
enjoyed seeing the Horace Mann guys again as well as meeting new
cubers.  I met both of my main goals:  a sub 20 solve and a successful
BLD solve, but overall I think I could have done a bit better.  I
can&#x27;t wait until the next tournament I go to!

I have quite a bit of videos (105 minutes). I&#x27;m going to put a lot of
them up at strangepuzzle.com in the next week or so and I&#x27;m also
making a DVD with all the videos for those of you like higher-quality

You will not be the lone Canadian in Florida come November, I can 
assure you of that. And you will have a hell of a time beating a few 
of them in most categories.  Keep practicing.

Hey, does it mean are you into Megaminxing again now? Last record you

Do you have a picture of those acrylic trophy cubes? And I think your 
last 4x4 solve was faster than 4:06.30 ;-)

I have one.  It is just like the Meffert assembly cube (complete with 
off-centre holes in the face centres), but with paper stickers. 
Smooth? -- it can be.  Any good? -- no.

Jasmine will confirm but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the Australian cube.  My

As recently as that?  I haven&#x27;t seen them in UK shops for several 
years, but I remember the &quot;World&#x27;s smoothest-turning&quot; and still have 
the solution sheet -- which isn&#x27;t at all bad, as these things go.

Blimey -- I hope it wasn&#x27;t her main speedcube. ;)  The faces on mine 
spin very freely, but must be aligned very precisely.  It was my only 
working 3x3x3 for several years, until I got a Studio cube last year.

  Well, I&#x27;ve not stopped minxing, but I haven&#x27;t been hitting it as
hard either.  I&#x27;m really going to hunker down in case I get to go to
Florida though.  I didn&#x27;t train quite as much as I would&#x27;ve liked to
for the Dallas tourney, but I did shave a couple seconds off my average.
  The times you&#x27;ve been throwing down are simply incredible,  as is
your video on strangepuzzle.com .  We&#x27;re all going to have to work
hard to get anywhere near you!  I hope I get to see you in action with
my own eyes sometime soon!

Best,
Daniel

          <div class="email-content">Even before seeing Duncan&#x27;s reply, I immediately recognised this cube! 

Yep, Duncan&#x27;s right, these cubes have been available in Canberra over
the past few years, although I very much doubt that they are actually
manufactured in Australia. It was briefly my main speedcube, and yes I
was using it at Worlds 2003. All the other cubers laughed at my cube.
:(  ;)

I didn&#x27;t realise how crappy the cube was until I tried everyone else&#x27;s
cube. After Worlds I used the cube they gave us there, and now I&#x27;m
using a 25th anniversary cube which is very nice.

These &#x27;smoothest cubes&#x27; are not so smooth straight out of the box, but
loosenly up A LOT (too much!) which a little silicone. The cube is
probably fine for a beginner, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend a non-beginner
getting one of these cubes.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I want to make a webpage with my 4x4 solution on it, speedsolve and <br>
not the current intermediate/beginner approach I have on my site now.<br>
<br>
I made the pictures for my current page myself, and I don&#x27;t think they <br>
look very professional.  Is there a program like Lars Vandenbergh&#x27;s <br>
ImageCube available for 4x4x4?  If not would anyone with some graphic <br>
savvy skills be willing to help me make a blank 4x4x4 template?  I <br>
would just need to be able to use the fill tool in photoshop to color <br>
the blank squares different colors and save as for a new picture file.<br>
<br>
I really am not very graphics savvy, and I&#x27;d like this page to look <br>
nice.<br>
<br>
Thanks to anyone who responds,<br>

That looks really good!  I&#x27;m going to start on the webpage tomorrow

Hi Chris!

Our intention was to go down to the lobby and mail the times to Jon,
but we never got around to it. I think I speak for everyone when I say
that you can submit them. The averages weren&#x27;t so great because Frank
and Ian were quoting Napoleon Dynamite the whole time, but whatever :)

          <div class="email-content">You can imagine why I would be skeptical at something like this.  I <br>
think it&#x27;s pretty much close to without a doubt that there is no better <br>
cuber in the world than Macky.  Do you realize the combined cubing + <br>
juggling skill that Macky has?  Macky, though not the best juggler in <br>
the world, is probably better than this amusement park performer.  I <br>
mean, how good of a juggler was this guy?  Are you a juggler yourself?<br>
<br>
There are many unskilled jugglers who get by doing tricks that don&#x27;t <br>
take much technical skill, but look very impressive to someone who <br>
doesn&#x27;t juggle much.  It is of my suspicion that the amusement park <br>
performer can&#x27;t do this.  If you could give us a detailed description <br>
of what was going on, I&#x27;d probably be more convinced.<br>
<br>
Quinn Lewis can flash 8 balls I believe.  I&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;ll tell <br>
you that it&#x27;s pretty hard to juggle a ball and a cube in one hand, and <br>
throw the ball high enough to make three moves with one-hand on a cube.<br>
<br>
Unless the guy can juggle 7 balls, he&#x27;s not better at juggling than <br>
Macky and we certainly know he&#x27;s not a better cuber than Macky.<br>

Maybe, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it is possible to do this using a 55113 <br>

If I could juggle that pattern well enough to do this, I would still <br>

I had a better idea. I created a new database table in the group so
anyone can add entries.

I added already the ones mentioned here.

This way it&#x27;s a more collective thing.

Cheers.

I agree with all this.

> G, on the other hand, might work.  

Although G is the only candidate left, it can also be ruled out.  The 
following argument seems excessively complicated, but I cannot think 
of a simpler one yet:

Let&#x27;s write the configuration in the form [corners][edges], where the 
pieces are taken in order clockwise around the U face.  The solved 
state is [0123][0123], and G can be taken to have the action 
G([0123][0123])=[2013][1203].  
Of course, U has the action U([0123][0123])=[3012][3012].

We need to investigate the kinds of positions that can be generated 
by repeated application of U and G.  Obviously there are too many to 
investigate by hand, so instead consider a reduced representation in 
which we do not distinguish a piece from its opposite number: 0 &amp; 2 
are both represented by 0, and 1 &amp; 3 are represented by 1.  Now 
consider the action of G and U on 

A = [0011]
B = [0101]
C = [0110]
D = [1001]
E = [1010]
F = [1100].

We have U{A,B,C,D,E,F} = {D,E,A,F,B,C} for both corners and edges, but

G{A,B,C,D,E,F} = {D,A,E,B,F,C} for corners

while G{A,B,C,D,E,F} = {B,D,F,A,C,E} for edges. 

In the reduced representation, several [corner][edge] configurations 
will be represented by the same ordered pair of symbols XY.  For 
example, the solved state is one of the states represented by BB.

By applying U and G repeatedly to BB, you can easily show that the 
only reduced configurations that can be reached are 
{BB,EE,BE,EB,AD,FC,DF,CA,DA,CF,FD,AC}.  (You can check in a couple of 
minutes that this set is invariant under U and G -- assuming that I 
haven&#x27;t made a silly mistake.)

Note in particular that this shows that a 3-cycle on one kind of 
piece is impossible, since this would require B (the reduced form of 
the solved state for one kind of piece) to be paired with a reduced 
configuration other than B or E.

Hope the idea is clear enough, but there really ought to be a simpler 
way of seeing it.

Some people are just REALLY fast with their hands...so they do the
move and they drop the magic in air and their hands are back to the
timer before the magic hits the table.  Could you jump onto yahoo

For World 2003 I thought there was no chance I was going to make it
since I was in Canberra, Australia and Worlds were in Toronto, Canada
(15815kms/9828miles away!), but then through a series of events and
changed travel plans it looked like I was going to be in Washington DC
anyway around the same time as Worlds. An extra trip from DC to
Toronto was pretty negligible once I&#x27;d already flown from Canberra! I
was sooooo excited!

You can simplify the argument by conflating your A and F, B and E, C 
and D.

The argument then boils down to the following.
Let&#x27;s mark pairs of LL pieces that have opposite colours (i.e. such 
pieces belong opposite each other in the last layer when it is 
solved).
The starting position it this:
abc
d d
cba

Note that I&#x27;m using the letters only as labels for identifying which 
pieces form a pair, not for identifying a particular pair. In other 
words, the following labelling means just the same:
adc
b b
cda

When applying the G perm and U turns to this, there are only two 
other possibilities of where the pairs can be:
aba
d b
cdc

abc
b d
adc
It is easily checked that no other patterns are generated when you 
apply G or U to these 3 patterns.
In particular, the mirror images of the last two patterns is not 
possible, nor can corners be opposite pairs and edges adjacent pairs 
(nor vice versa).

my own plane tickets. :) BTW, I&#x27;m 28 years  so older than a lot of

BTW, you don&#x27;t need to have mega fast times to compete. I was
averaging over a minute leading up to Worlds. I got my first sub-1min
average only about a week before Worlds and my best time at the
competition was only 54 seconds. I knew my times were waaay too slow
to be really competitive so I was just aiming to do times that were
good times for me.

For me, Worlds 2003 was primarily about meeting cubers from all around
the world, and also getting some competition experience. My current
average is about 35 seconds, which is still not internationally
competitive, so my aim is just to beat my previous competition times. :)

Yah, I agree with everything you said...except that I have a job, not
a great one, but it is a job...and I could pay for everything, but it

that I won&#x27;t do anything except cube for the next two months...

Thanks, Jaap!

That makes it quite obvious.  In particular, it would seem that there 
is nothing special about identifying opposite pairs.  Any reduced 
representation in which a 3-cycle can be distinguished from the solved 
state, a double-swap of adjacent pieces of the same type, or an X-swap 
should do a similar job.

Darn, you guys were faster ;-) I had this thought about any PLL (plus 
U turns): Pairs that belong opposite are either opposite or not. Like 
a kind of parity. We need an alg that changes this parity, both for 
edges and corners. But exactly this requirement makes a 3-cycle 
impossible. Right?

I badly wanted to believe this, but the parity change depends both on 
the state and the PLL -- not just the PLL -- so I don&#x27;t understand 
how your argument works.  

To give an explicit example (focusing on corners), suppose the PLL 
swaps UBR and URF:

12
03

the even-&quot;parity&quot;, solved state becomes

13
02

which has odd &quot;parity&quot;. Now apply U to get

01
23

which still has odd &quot;parity&quot;.  Now apply the PLL again to get

03
21.

The &quot;parity&quot; is still odd, so there has been no parity change this 
time.

Yeah ok, I see. Well, my proof has one big advantage: You all have a 
reason to laugh now ;-)

Another demonstration why my &quot;proof&quot; doesn&#x27;t work is that it would 
also prove that e.g. the PLL, its mirror and U together would also not 
be enough to create a 3-cycle...

But there must be a fix, there must be a really short proof...

Sigh...

Yep, there &quot;ought&quot; to be.  It is horribly tantalizing, but I must stop 
thinking about it now. ;)

Great work! Well done! I like watching these.. The quality is very

But I already liked your videos-site anyway, so keep up the nice work!

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m going to write a report on Dallas, and actually also on the Horace <br>
Mann tourny (though I&#x27;m almost done with that one) pretty soon, but I <br>
wanted to post about ZB.<br>
<br>
I did 6 ZB solves in Dallas, 4 of the first round solves (I got <br>
amnesia on the ZBF2L on one of the solves and used Fridrich), and the <br>
last two solves of the final round.<br>
<br>
Of those 6 solves I got 2 ZBLL solves, 15.91 which was a PLL skip <br>
after COLL and 17.52 which was the ZBLL case F&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; F2 U F2 R U&#x27; F&#x27; <br>
U&#x27; F2 U F2 U2 which I do as y x (L&#x27; U&#x27;) x&#x27; (U&#x27; L2) (U) ((L)2 F) (U&#x27;) <br>
[L&#x27; U&#x27; (L)2 (U) (L&#x27;)2] U2<br>
<br>
I was definitely very nervous trying to recognize the ZBF2L case while <br>
being timed and if you watch my video of the 17.52 solve I have a very <br>
long delay in trying to recognize the ZBLL case.  I knew by the COLL <br>
case that I knew the ZBLL one, but it took me a few seconds to fully <br>
recognize it.<br>
<br>
I still feel excited about ZB for competitions, though I agree with <br>
pretty much everyone who has posted that I think ZB will take a lot of <br>
work.  My motivation comes from the fact that ZBF2L, though harder <br>
than F2L is still manageable in competition.  Also, even with a slow <br>
recognition of one of my better practiced ZBLL cases I can still get <br>
17.xx seconds.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t expect to see any real results from ZB in competition for a <br>
long time, but after trying it in Dallas I definitely think it is a <br>
viable method for competitions, and this only motivated me even more <br>
to learn it.<br>
<br>
I hope people aren&#x27;t sick of hearing about ZB, but I felt extremely <br>
excited to use it for the first time in competition and I wanted to <br>
post about it.<br>

 I seriously doubt anyone is tired of hearing about ZB. I personally
am facinated at your determination to get it done. Please keep us
posted and good luck in your endeavor.

Yes it&#x27;s a nice feeling when it&#x27;s really new. But i guess u won&#x27;t 
like it that much once u get faster;-) U will notice better that 
it&#x27;s locking too much.

And don&#x27;t try to take it apart like u do with a normal 3x3x3, 
popping an edge. That will get u into trouble reassembling it 
again ;-) U can take off the centercaps of a face to get access to a 
screw which will let u disassble it properly if u fancy. But i 
recommend never do that. The cube will get very loose after u do :-(

Have fun!

Hi Chris,

First of all, congratulations on your results!

There&#x27;s something I&#x27;d like to ask about &quot;ZB&quot; (I already asked but I 
think the post didn&#x27;t appear?!).

I don&#x27;t know if this technique is interesting for super-humans, but 
it is not for normal humans like me because of an important point 
that is rarely discussed: Case recognition time.

For three years, I&#x27;ve been practicing CLL recognition, and I think I 
became rather good at it.

In my opinion, being fast means:

1) Being able to recognize the case from the best angle immediately. 
But that&#x27;s not enough.

2) Being able to recognize it from different point of views. Full 
identification or partial when this point of view (3 sides) is not 
enough.

3) Being able to anticipate as much as possible, *before the end of 
the previous step* (simple example: If you finish the F2L stage with 
an R turn, start analyzing the ULx corners before). (Tip: Practice 
Lars Petrus&#x27; fifth step if you want to master relative positioning of 
corners)

4) At any stage of the recognition process, ready your fingers. If 
there are 3 hypothesis left, your fingers must be ready for any of 
them, waiting for the last pieces of information.

5) In order to do 4) efficiently, the sequences must be carefully 
selected. It&#x27;s useless to optimize a sequence for pure speed only if 
you need to adjust U or, more seriously, if you need to change your 
grip at the last moment because you are hesitating between 2 cases 
and the 2 solving sequences start with very different moves and grip.

CLL ==
- 43 different cases
- 24 unique sequences
--> Years of optimizations and practice.


Now for the question you can guess ;-)

What&#x27;s your estimation of the recognition time for &quot;CLL + LL-edges 
position&quot;, or more precisely, the delay between the last F2L turn and 
the first move of the LL sequence?


Gilles.

The simplest way might be: Get a new Megaminx from mefferts.com ;-)

No, seriously! I think they used much more glue a while ago and 
nowadays the caps come off easily. Also, they now have good long 
screws with large heads (and maybe only thread on the ends but I&#x27;m not 
sure). And they do have tiles which make them totally beautiful :-)

Other than that, I&#x27;d suggest to use a thin rectangular blade like 
this:
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/images/Center_Remove.JPG
Stick it under the cap from all five directions, I think you can go 
about 2mm deep without causing damage (other than cracking glue, which 
is what you want).

Cheers!
Stefan

Yeah, they did use too much glue. Today I also got another game cube 
and three of the centers had lots of excessive glue where the springs 
are! The springs were completely paralyzed! It was just terrible. I&#x27;ve 
repaired one center now (pulled out the spring, used my dremel to 
remove the glue and make the hole even larger so it had a flat bottom 
rim again on which I could put a nice metal washer). Just this one 
center took me at least an hour. The other two will be faster now that 
I know what to do and have the tools.

But to &quot;answer&quot; your question: David recently wrote a description how 
to get deluxe/game cube tiles off nicely. Don&#x27;t know whether it was 
here or over at TPF. And of course minimize the number of tiles you 
swap (i.e. 8 if you want to swap just two colors).

Cheers!
Stefan

Yes, I need to hunt down all bargains, that&#x27;s why I check ebay maybe 
3-5 times every day, mostly together with this group and the 
twistypuzzles forum...

P.S. Dammit at what point did this happen to me? Oh curse you, you 
cubers.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for the tips guys.  I have two different megaminxes<br>
(megaminxi?) that I am working on.  One is the stickered 6 color style<br>
(though the stickers have since been replaced) and the other is from<br>
the new run of 12 color tiled minxes, both from mefferts.<br>
<br>
After trying every prying device known to man to get these center caps<br>
off, I went with drastic measures.  I drilled a very small (1/16 inch)<br>
hole at the seem between the cap and the base and stuck a tiny nail in<br>
there.  Then grabbed that nail with some pliers and pried them off.  I<br>
got all but one to come up this way (and in fact, the one that won&#x27;t<br>
come off bent the nail at a right angle!)  I did that on my test<br>
megaminx to try it out before touching me speed minx, and I think it&#x27;s<br>
going to work.<br>
<br>
However, the tile scheme is not to my liking on the tiled minx, so if<br>
anyone can dig up those tile removal tips, let me know!<br>
<br>
Thanks guys!<br>

OUCH!!! That hurt reading it, man :-)

So which one did you do this, too? The new 12 color tiled one you have 
should have only very little glue and the caps should really come off 
easily just using a thing blade/knife.

My tip: Get used to the new color scheme and buy at least four of them 
so you&#x27;re safe for the near future (that&#x27;s what I did ;-). Or you can 
get just the tiles from mefferts.com and put them on a stickered 
Megaminx the way you like it.

Cheers!
Stefan

Oh, and if you don&#x27;t use superglue then you can take them off whenever 
you feel the desire/need to change the color scheme again :-). For 
example like this:

This was actually the new 12 color tiled minx.  Only one cap came off<br>
when I tried to pry them.  Having them off now, I can tell maybe 2<br>
others that could have come off had I tried a bit harder, but there is<br>
so much residual glue on the others I&#x27;m surprised they ever came off!<br>

<br>
You&#x27;re probably right on this one :D ... Old habits though!  I might<br>
just do the tile set from mefferts, I&#x27;d only have to learn two new<br>
colors this way (my gray and black would both become a shade of<br>
blue... I mean really, 3 shades of blue on one puzzle!?!).  Those<br>
tiles do seem to be REALLY well stuck down.<br>
<br>
Also, does anyone know where I might score some shorter springs? Or at<br>
least less taught ones?  I was thinking of checking out ACE or<br>
something like that, but I don&#x27;t know if they carry too many kinds of<br>
springs.<br>
<br>
Thanks again!<br>

As you can see from my videos (www.cubewhiz.com/videos.html#magic), it
certainly is possible. The magic is also on the mat before I stop the
timer. ;)

Thanks Ian, very nice and funny (enough for me to read it all :-). 
You&#x27;re a pro.

Only that... &quot;Anyway, the five of us (me, Tyson, Leyan, Isaac, Macky 
and his mom) went to a restaurant that served Thai food.&quot;

I bet you&#x27;re the kind of guy who can also solve just five sides of the 
cube ;-)

I tried it a few days ago...Chris Hardwick watched me do that in 4.xx
seconds.  I&#x27;ve even done 5 in a row before in under 7.5 :)  I was
racing Chris&#x27;s 3-6-3 speedstack cycle by solving 3 magics in a row and
the times were pretty similar. ;)

I noticed that you did the last moves on the mat. I do it in the air,
I should try to do it on the mat, it might be better. :-)

It&#x27;s strange that they cite legal reasons.  What are these reasons, 
exactly?  The Eastsheen cubes use different, patented mechanisms from 
Rubiks, and I believe (correct me if wrong) that Sebesteny&#x27;s patent for 
the Revenge mechanism lapsed quite a few years ago.

The reason seems to be only commercial : they cannot organize an event
and allow people to compete (and be seen) with other branded cubes, it
would be as if Budweiser was providing Heineken at a beer festival !

I think I&#x27;ve tried that before, too, but I didn&#x27;t know where to put 
all the magics. How did you place them? Oh, now I remember: I was 
trying to solve Magic+MasterMagic.

I think they have a copyright on the design, i.e. the appearance, so 
it doesn&#x27;t matter that the Eastsheen has a different mechanism since 
it still looks and feels the same (unless you&#x27;re a cuber in which case 
you know the difference ;-).

Ah, thanks... it still seems odd, but perhaps not odder than the 
colour &quot;Barbie pink&quot; having legal protection.

Gilles: Yes, in the past I&#x27;d also assumed that the reasons for the 
restriction were purely commercial, which is why the tournament

Here it is:

Dear Craig
Eastsheen Cubes are not allowed, we do appreciate that a lot of
speedcubers prefer their 2x2 and 4x4 but we cannot legally be seen to
endorse them. I have copied this reply to our webmaster regarding your
registration question.
Looking forward to meeting you in November.
Best wishes

Dear Responder,
Thank you very much for a fast reply, but I believe that only the
2x2x2 is better.  The two world champions, Frank Morris and Chris
Hardwick, both use Rubik&#x27;s 4x4x4s and 5x5x5s, it is just the 2x2x2
that is smoother.  I got the answer to the registration question from
the World Championships FAQ page.  How do you tell if a cube is a
rubik&#x27;s or not?  Because I have been trying to find the serial numbers
on my cubes, but cannot tell.  I know they all are because I bought
them either at a store in the Rubik&#x27;s packaging, or off of your
website, but I do not know how you would tell the difference.

Craig 

Hi Craig
Size and quality and if in doubt the internal mechanism (so I&#x27;m told !)

Dear Responder,
I ordered 2 Eastsheens yesterday, and I am not sure when they will get
here, but I am pretty sure they are the same size (5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm)
but I should double check.  As for quality, how can you tell???
Someone may have lubed up a Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2 and made it seem like an
Eastsheen, and the internal parts, how can they be different???
Whatever.  I am not trying to argue with you, just trying to support
speedcubers worldwide.

Craig

Hi Craig
Yes it would be good if you can check. The point really is that people
have to be taken on trust and everyone should be using the same cube. 
There is also the good point that the costs of these events (or
Gala&#x27;s!) is enormous so the Rubik&#x27;s guys that pay for it (me) don&#x27;t
think we should support companies like East Sheen who trade off our
efforts.

Maybe you guys can make something of that...I don&#x27;t know.  I kinda
figured he meant that, like Gilles said, they can&#x27;t support another
company...P.S. - Gilles, nice analogy...with the Beer...lol...

Haha, that is really funny... like any two official Rubik&#x27;s cubes are 
ever the same ;-). And I&#x27;m not even talking about all the different

<br>
In order to clarify the situation, I wrote an email to Rubik&#x27;s to know<br>
if we can compete with non-Rubik&#x27;s stickers.<br>
Here is a copy of the e-mail :<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
Hello,<br>
<br>
My name is Gilles and I&#x27;m going to take part to the World Championship<br>
in November.<br>
I have a question about the regulations regarding  the cubes. I&#x27;m<br>
aware that only Rubik&#x27;s cubes will be allowed at the competition. But<br>
does that also include the stickers ?<br>
I&#x27;m afraid the Rubik&#x27;s Stickers quality is not very good, and I had to<br>
change my stickers in order to cube in good conditions.<br>
I&#x27;d like to know if I&#x27;ll be allowed to compete at the WC with Rubik&#x27;s<br>
cubes but with other stickers (which do not show any brand, just plain<br>
stickers).<br>
<br>
I hope you anderstand my concerns and can give me a quick answer.<br>
Thank you,<br>
Kind regards,<br>
Gilles.<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll forward the answer to you all so that everybody knows :-)<br>

was not very good :P)<br>

You must have really good accuracy. If that was me, I would be 
hitting my cube on the computer a few times each average.  I agree, 
the big mats are a lot of wasted space, but I would really need the 
mini mat to be about 4 inches bigger.  I just have my mat sprawled 
across my whole computer desk, so my mouse works anywhere I need it 
to work.

So when the first picture loaded I saw your monitor and I thought to 
myself, that is a really sharp looking desktop image. He must have a 
really good monitor and graphics card. Then I though, no! He must 
have a really good camera to capture the quality so vividly. Then I 
thought, no! I must have a good monitor and graphics card in order 
to see vividness.  Then I thought, no! All three items must have 
come together in order for all of this to happen! Needless to say, I 
stopped thinking after that.

Frank Morris pointed out to me this past weekend that I do put the
cube down rather softly. I&#x27;m just not one of those people who throw my
cube across the room every time I stop the timer :)

It works great for my purposes.

 I also had a personal best average yestrday. I crossed the sub-50
mark average for the first time! And the strange thing is that on my
two tries before i got the same average to the second decimal place!
50.14 ! One of them was on the sunday contest. I thought it was very
wierd.

Ofcourse this is not at all on the same grounds as your sub 20 but
still im very excited.


Keep cubing and keep sub-bing ! :)

You could also try asking the Germans:
http://www.getspeedstacks.de/

If you scroll down you can also watch a nice 10 minute video of a 
German TV show where they demonstrate cupstacking. The kids became 
world champions recently. And hey, what&#x27;s that about cupstacking that 
again a girl beats all the guys?

Actually btw there are some more sites you can choose here:

It&#x27;s funny you should ask because it&#x27;s my first PDA and I got it two
days ago...mostly for Reed&#x27;s timer, but I&#x27;m finding that there are so
many cool things I can do with it!

It&#x27;s an HP iPAQ hx2755.

I need to do that too...It&#x27;s been a while since I played.

Yeah, I had to basically clear my desk...So because of that I rarely
used the stackmat. I anticipate using this much more.

You should definitely check out Grant Tregay&#x27;s iPAQ cube timer. It&#x27;s
in the Files section of the group: CubeTimes2Go.exe. I use this for
timing myself when I&#x27;m out and about. It&#x27;s great!

BTW, where can I find Reed&#x27;s timer?

So the table and the graph update dynamically as you accept solves?
That&#x27;s really cool. Is it something others could use too?

Congrats Joe!  That was a really nice average.  Don&#x27;t forget who was
giving you the scrambles though.  ;)

Now just finish learning your corner cases and you could average sub
20 all the time...

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m actually thinking about that. It still needs some more polishing,
a few obvious bugs need to be taken care of and an installation manual
need to be done. It&#x27;s gonna require a server with PHP and Mysql
though. :/

I&#x27;ll release it here as soon as it gets to a state where I think it&#x27;s
ready for public scrutiny.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :D

They earn money from selling bad stickers. They know the vinyl is 
not good. It cracks easily and the glue is rather ridiculous. After 
some use the stickers feel like floating on the cubies :-P And also 
the corners are not rounded well so that also helps wearing them 
down really fast. A plus however is that the colors are not that bad 
at all ;-)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">C&#x27;mon people what&#x27;s with the paranoia? I just downloaded it, scanned 
it for viruses and malware using Norton, and then ran it. Then it 
didn&#x27;t post anything to the net. So this is safeware, unless it will 
crash my hard disk tomorrow. I&#x27;ll let you know.

Besides that, congratz on the best rubik animated game I have ever 
seen. The gliding clube is nothing compared to the slick graphics 
this thing employs. One word: I love it! No that&#x27;s three.. :(

The user interface/usability could use some work though (this is for 
you programmers at gabba):
1. Enable keyboard usage
2. Make very clear visible help. I was fiddling for 5 minutes before 
I found out I could rotate the cube by dragging with the right mouse 
button down (which is quite awkward, but functional). Think of a 
future mac version people, they don&#x27;t have a right mouse button. Most 
applets just use the left button on the outside of the cube for this. 
That&#x27;s very natural.
3. Why not zoom even further. Look at how Werner Randelshofer really 
takes that to the max (www.randelshofer.de). You are obviously using 
OpenGL, so why the heck not?
4. Enable a few of our favourite things: scramble/alg edit, save 
session times, look at NetCube e.g. from strangepuzzle.com, or my 
very own RubikTimer at http://tinyurl.com/926l4
5. How about (going wild) saving the solve as a movie (AVI/SWF or 
whatever). Then you would finally have created something none of the 
applets has.
6. Oh, and make it possible to disable the animated background. I get 
dizzy looking at it.

          <div class="email-content">I saw this question by someone, don&#x27;t remember it.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s the answer: Go to http://www.putfile.com<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s really easy, and totally free, provided you don&#x27;t use disturbing <br>
language, like e.g. &quot;I ain&#x27;t cheating, you punks&quot; at the end of your <br>
movie. Just make sure your video is below 10MB. And that&#x27;s also really <br>
easy. If you have Windows XP home you will find Windows Movie Maker on <br>
your system, which has the &#x27;save movie wizard&#x27;. Then you can just <br>
select a size/quality, and bingo!<br>
<br>
Apple users should have it somewhere integrated into every program.<br>
Linux Users know Everything, so I won&#x27;t give them any advice.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I definately agree on the help front, took me a while to figure out
how to efficiently see the other side of the cube.  But since it&#x27;s
only an alpha release, my guess is that it&#x27;s just not implemented yet.

I DEFINATELY like the video idea.  My tweak to it would be to have a
twist recorder that plays back twists on a cube (twists saved in a
file which can be shared) and then have an option to export the twists
as a video.  You&#x27;d lose the realtime aspect of the solve this way
though...

And lastly, who doesn&#x27;t like to see a 9x9x9 with a cool spot pattern?

Funny, being the only person there with a Rubik&#x27;s Game cube makes it 
pretty easy to tell when they are about to call you... Actually it 
helped, as most of the judges in Dallas liked to just call &quot;Doug&quot; 
without specifying &quot;Li&quot; or &quot;Reed&quot;.

          <div class="email-content">Wow the magic is addicting!  Before I went to Dallas, where Bob Burton<br>
and Doug Li showed me how to restring a magic, I broke one of my red<br>
magics so bad that a tile came out.<br>
<br>
Well tonight I completely disassembled that magic and put it back<br>
together.  It was actually pretty cool!  It was very time consuming,<br>
but in a way good since now I feel *very* comfortable replacing a<br>
string on a magic now.<br>
<br>
This actually was also practice for wanting to string a master magic<br>
from scratch.  I actually disassembled two of my other magics as well<br>
to prepare for making a master magic, but I wanted to try a regular<br>
magic from scratch first.<br>
<br>
I also now realized that I don&#x27;t know where to get the design for the<br>
master magic.  I checked Jaap&#x27;s page but he doesn&#x27;t have printouts for<br>
the master magic design.  The closest one I could find was the magic<br>
rings, but I would prefer to use the master magic sheets so I can<br>
solve in competitions.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know where I can get the graphics for a master magic to<br>
printout so I can build my own?<br>

          <div class="email-content">The comments so far (onlist and e-mail) have been very productive - <br>
keep &#x27;em coming!  The interface requests have been very informative <br>
in particular.  Someone had mentioned enabling the keyboard.  The <br>
question is: How does one enable keyboard input for a n-size cube.  <br>
In other words, how should we implement keyboard controls that work <br>
on both a 2x2x2 and a 9x9x9 cube?  We will try to get a new release <br>
out in the next few days to address using the left mouse button to <br>
turn the cube.  We will also include a readme.txt file in the next <br>
release that details the cube interface.<br>
<br>
For now, here are a few of the less-obvious controls:<br>
<br>
- The up/down arrows keys zoom the cube in/out (as does the mouse <br>
wheel.<br>
<br>
- You can produce a 180 degree twist of any face by holding down the <br>
left CTRL key down while turning the cube slice.<br>
<br>
- You can change the fullscreen resolution from the default of <br>
1024x768 by editing the sys.rc file in the install directory with <br>
any text editor (notepad, for example) and changing the values on <br>

          <div class="email-content">I loved the software. but the cube turning is a lil bit uncomfortable
for me. I think i&#x27;ll have to get used to it . And yes the music seems
nice at first but it gets a lil monotonous later on. Ofcourse you
could turn it off but it&#x27;ll be nice to have many tunes and have them
played randomly or something.

Great work!

Being possibly overcautious, I use only 100% pure silicone grease from 
a tube.

Petroleum products can damage ABS plastic quickly.  (Bitter 
experience.)  However, of the hydrocarbons listed on your spraycan, 
heptane is the only one that isn&#x27;t a gas at room temperature and 
pressure.  I assume that the other two are the propellant, and that the 
silicone is dissolved in the heptane so that it can be expelled from 
the can as a liquid.  If so, the heptane would be expected to evaporate 
fairly quickly from the lube -- it should have a mild petroleum smell, 
so you would know when most of it had gone.

Maybe I would risk it, so long as it&#x27;s /your/ cube. ;)

I think I use something similar, though mine is called &quot;silicone oil&quot;:
http://www1.conrad.de/xl/2000_2999/2200/2260/2269/226976_BB_00_FB.EPS.

I used to spray some spray into a tiny can and then use a paintbrush 
to paint the insides of my puzzles. Now with the oil this is much 
easier and it doesn&#x27;t seem to smell/evaporate at all.

Does yours say something about viscosity?

Cheers!
Stefan

He guys,

  I&#x27;ve been working on it for a few days as I promised a few folks at
the Dallas tournament I would.  I think it&#x27;s close enough to done to
call it done!  Now no one has read it except myself, so I ezpect a few
errors, just let me know and I&#x27;ll fix them as soon as I can.
  Also let me know if you think I went about the whole thing the wrong
way, as I&#x27;ve never really written a guide like this before!

At any rate, it&#x27;s a 16 page (lots of pictures) word document located here:

I also posted a very similar message to the twistypuzzle forums.

Anywhoo, let me know what you think!

No, but it is definitely a &quot;grease&quot; -- sticky and viscous.

Silicone oil might well be better. I wanted that but could find only a 
spraycan version here.

Looks good, especially I like the pictures better than Grant&#x27;s textual 
descriptions (though they&#x27;re ok). And you&#x27;ve reminded me I might have 
to replace some of my LL algs with better ones...

Are there real differences between your solution and Grant&#x27;s? If so, 
maybe you could point them out so they&#x27;re easier to see for someone 
knowing Grant&#x27;s method already. And you two could link to each other&#x27;s 
solution, too.

Thanks!

Have a look for &quot;silicone damper oil&quot; or &quot;silicone shock oil&quot; in model 
making shops. Here&#x27;s a page that shows some more different:

I&#x27;m pretty sure that Grant and I have very very similar methods.  I&#x27;m
know we do the faces in the same general order, and we do the same
OLLE, PLLE, OLLC, PLLC for the last layer. I&#x27;ll have to try out his
algorithms and see if there&#x27;s any differences there (though at a
glance it really only looks like the OLLE algs are different). 
Essentially the solutions look almost identical though.

And I&#x27;ll add a link to Grant&#x27;s solution for sure!

          <div class="email-content">Cool, thanks everybody!  I only have one more question though, I 
have the sheet printed out and the magic tiles and strings ready, 
but how do the tiles line up?

The front side is obvious, but how do I place the back tiles in 
relation to the front tiles?

The sheet makes it look like I flip the magic horizontally, so that 
the right end of the front side becomes the left end of the back 
side.

Is that right?

That&#x27;s all I need to string the master magic, so let me know!

          <div class="email-content">That was an awesome solution guide.  I&#x27;ve never gotten into the
megaminx much, partly because I used to have a 6-color minx, and then
with my new stickers the last layer always gave me problems.  Your
solution was very easy to follow, and the pictures were great.  I just
used it to solve mine (well, mostly just the last layer part).  One
thing that would help is having an index somewhere which lists all the
moves you gave greek (I think greek) symbols for, and possibly having
the index in a seperate file or something.  I say this because it was
only a very minor hassle to read the move, then go back and have to
look for the different symbols to find the moves.

Again, that was just a very tiny issue.  Overall, I thought it was
great, and maybe I&#x27;ll start minxing more to put up some good times in
Orlando.  Thanks again.

Hey Chris,
Congrats on restringing your 2x4 magic. I just finished stringing my 
master magic, but it was a lot of work. I messed up quite a bit, but 
heres some tips that will save you time:

The strings do NOT start at the top left corner of the tiles, they 
start at the bottom left corner.
The loop that you will creat should work this way: Hold the MM with 
the linked rings facing you. Fold the top half onto the back of the 
bottom. This is important to get correct, or else the magic will be 
upside down, thus unsolvable. 

If you have anymore questions, feel free to email me: 
pjgat09@...

Good luck!!

Nevermind that that post was sorta spam. The demo at their site is
great! U can test out cubes up to 9x9x9 in very nice 3D. A bit like
java applets but much nicer graphics. For those who can&#x27;t wait for
the 6x6x6 olympicube it&#x27;s well worth checking out. Maybe i should
speak to those guys about implementing super-supercubing. Hehe ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
I was just thinking, right now, the Guinness Book of World Records <br>
recognizes 16.53 seconds as the fastest solve.  If you&#x27;ve seen the <br>
Guinness Book&#x27;s criteria for a Rubik&#x27;s speed solve attempt, it&#x27;s quite <br>
interesting.  They require two cubes new from the package and a lot of <br>
other odd things.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if no one breaks 12.11 in Florida, well, they will have a <br>
difficult time ignoring the WCA.  After all, you can&#x27;t claim a 12.5x <br>
time is the world record when a 12.11 time was set on April 3, 2004.  <br>
However, if someone does break 12.11, I foresee the slight issue.  <br>
Guinness will recognize this record as the world record, which would <br>
undermine the authority of all of the other competitions taking place.  <br>
It will propagate the standard that only records achieved in a world <br>
championship are valid.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m most likely not going to be the one in contention to break 12.11 <br>
seconds, but there are some of you out there that just might do it.  In <br>
the event that the single speed solve record is broken (and us speed <br>
cubers know that 12.11 isn&#x27;t nearly as important as 14.52), my <br>
suggestion is to not accept the Guinness recognition of holding the <br>
world record.  Accepting their recognition would undermine the <br>
authority of all the tournament work that has happened in the last two <br>
years.  Until Guinness is ready to accept the WCA&#x27;s records as the <br>
world records, we really shouldn&#x27;t help them out.<br>
<br>
And anyway, what&#x27;s important?  Having a record in the book which no one <br>
of any authority or knowledge recognizes, or having a record that is <br>
respected by the community?<br>
<br>
Anyway, these are just my initial impressions.  Obviously, the most <br>
likely candidate that would have to deal with something like this is <br>
Macky, but 12.11 can be broken by anyone.  I really hope that this <br>
e-mail doesn&#x27;t spark an outrage in the community, and I don&#x27;t foresee a <br>
heated debate and many flames.  If I&#x27;m out of line, please let me know, <br>
but I feel that Guinness&#x27; ignorance of 12.11 seconds shows disrespect <br>
for the work that I have done these last two years and undermine the <br>
work that all competition organizers have put in and so I submit to you <br>
not to acknowledge the Guinness Book of Records.<br>

I tried to describe this a little while ago

/16249.  It may sound too strange without another Master Magic to 
compare it.  I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t take a picture.

Hi Chris (again),

Check out this page first:
http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=505

Thats how the front and back will look. Now to make it like the 
normal master magics, heres how the front and backs line up:
If you are looking at the back side, the tile on the lower left 
corner would be the tile with the signature.

Hope this helps!!

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

The Guiness requirements for setting speedcubing world records are 
just outrageous if u ask me. In which other sport or discipline do 
they require to use brand new equipment that has not been customised 
for the competitor. I would guess none. What if speeding with cars 
on a closed circuit should be done with a car straight from the 
factory, not tested or modified in any way whatsoever. Or shooting w 
guns that are not heavily prepared to fit the sportsman. No, this is 
really so stupid that i can&#x27;t believe people with any sense at all 
has made it up.

I also believe that WCA should contact Guiness and try to make them 
think logically about this, which they obviously haven&#x27;t done until 
now. It&#x27;s not a big deal for us speedcubers belonging to the 
community that the book of world records doesn&#x27;t recognize all times 
recognized by the WCA. The ptoblem is that the rest of the people 
will seriously believe that faster than 16.53 hasn&#x27;t been done in 
controlled environment. And that is really too stupid.

Ok, cubing shouldn&#x27;t be taken too seriously, but a time set in 
controlled environment by the sports recognized association should 
indeed be accepted by Guiness as well.

Another serious implication of this is that the World Championships 
will moist likely always be sponsored by Seventowns. And we all know 
that they only acceopt their own branded cubes/puzzles where 
applicable. So they do allow of coz any kind of megaminx simply 
cause they don&#x27;t produce thir own ones. But my point then is that 
Guiness in fact as a consequence only accept world records set with 
Rubiks.com branded products. Those who are fast with say Eastsheen 
2x2x2/4x4x4/5x5x5 and solve faster than world record set with the 
mentioned branded products in competitions acknowledged by the WCA 
will automatically not be accepted. Adidas does indeed sponsor many 
events (not as sole sponsor of coz) but that doesn&#x27;t mean tracking 
world records have to be set with Adidas shoes !!! Grrrrr ...

Ok, that&#x27;s enough emotions over this issue. I feel really sorry for 
those who won&#x27;t have their achievements acknowledged, when it was 
truly deserved :-(

but I&#x27;m going to try to string it tomorrow.

I&#x27;ll let everyone know how it goes.

Thanks again!

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I just took an average for doing the magic harmonic.  This is where <br>
you start with unlinked rings, solve to linked rings, then undo back <br>
to unlinked rings.  So you start the timer and pick up the magic, <br>
solve then unsolve, then once the magic is solved again you stop the <br>
timer.  I got the idea from cupstacking, since for the cycle you start <br>
and end in the same configuration.<br>
<br>
Anyway the times were:<br>
3.77 3.34 3.28 4.30 (3.11) (5.11) 3.20 4.35 3.50 3.54 4.13 4.42 = 3.78<br>
<br>
Bob Burton and I were trying this out some too in Dallas.<br>
<br>
Anyway if you&#x27;re a magic solver and haven&#x27;t tried this it&#x27;s pretty <br>
fun, give it a shot!  I know sub-3 will be possible with practice for <br>
a single time, though not sure of the limits for an average.<br>

I think, but the Guinness record is only about 8.xx seconds.

Emily holds both records, so they&#x27;re unhappy but not too terribly so
about it.

I think Guinness just isn&#x27;t as interested in our &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;off-beat&quot;
sports.  So if their rules don&#x27;t fit our sport it doesn&#x27;t really
matter much to them.

Have you been in contact with Guinness, trying to make them accept

a WCA authorized cometition, we (the cubers) shall not cooperate 
with them at all.

Are you sure you sent your question? After writing the message and hit 
&quot;send&quot; (or whatever) you get sort of a preview and then you have to 
hit &quot;send&quot; a second time.

Just a small addition: Between those first two pictures the puzzle was 
flipped left-right, i.e. not up-down. Of course for solving it doesn&#x27;t 
matter. Btw, rubiks.com made a mistake, don&#x27;t know whether they&#x27;ve 
fixed it now. The way it was you couldn&#x27;t just print both sides on the 
same sheet. Just look at the twistypuzzles pictures how to arrange the 
tiles.

I think you need to say *which* book of records, cause this one I 
think does:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1843581264

It&#x27;s made by these people:
http://www.recordholders.org/en/index.html

And if you search for &quot;rubik&quot; one of the pages you&#x27;ll find is:
http://www.recordholders.org/en/index.html

But yeah, the only lists I really care about are the WCA ones.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think this is really worth getting too worried about. Who
really cares what&#x27;s in Guinness anyway? We all know that
speedcubing.com is the place to go for checking speedcubing records.

I often cube on the train and people always ask me what the world
record is, and of course I say 12.11 seconds. If anyone did contradict
me and say they read 16.53 seconds in Guinness, they I&#x27;d tell them
that the book is out of date and 16.53 seconds has been broken many
times in official competitions since Worlds 2003.

BTW, http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/ also has a records section
with cool filters so you can sort by puzzle, year and even by person
to see all the official times set by particular solvers. Another cool
thing which the WCA site has which speedcubing.com doesn&#x27;t (but please
correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) is a list of 3x3x3 official rankings combined
across years - this is probably the list I&#x27;m most interested in
because you can see where you rank relative to solves in all
competitions across all years (including the 1982 championships!).
BTW, it&#x27;s actually not quite all years at the moment though because it
hasn&#x27;t yet been updated to include 2005 comps.

I never knew such a site existed! It is pretty cool. I&#x27;m not sure why the fewest moves 
records need to be listed to 2 decimal places though!

Maybe that&#x27;s so I can end my solution with let&#x27;s say &quot;... R*0.8&quot; 
because small misalignments are allowed and this way I could beat your 
27 with my 26.8. But I could be wrong.

Wait, actually why only save at the end? I could for example write 
&quot;U*0.9 R*0.8&quot; which works very well cause my cubes forgives some 
misalignments. Ok, now I&#x27;m sure that this is the reason.

Cheers!
Stefan

Here&#x27;s my best average so far, and it even has my best time in it 
too.

I think that there isn&#x27;t any international laws, which say that
Guinness has the monopoly in deciding which records are official.
And I must say that my German Open 2005 15.00 sec. solve was lucky.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tyson,

I really can&#x27;t be bothered about the cubing records Guinness 
recognises. Someone else once said (it may have been you), Guinness 
sucks when you are interested in cube records. 

So if people in the community know that Guinness sucks when it comes 
to cubing records, Guinness will certainly not set a &#x27;standard&#x27; for 
what official records really are.

You say: &#x27;Guinness will recognize this record as the world record, 
which would undermine the authority of all of the other competitions 
taking place.&#x27;

You can say the same thing now about Guinness not recognising the 
12.11 records.

If you think I am wrong, please tell me why.

Bye!

Joël.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not worried about ourselves.  Cubers are smart enough to know 
what&#x27;s recognized by what and who has authority.  However, think about 
the publicity during and after the WC 2005?  Think about how many 
non-cubers will think, hmm... what&#x27;s the world record?  Where will they 
turn?

          <div class="email-content">Could you give an option to keep just the clicking sound on and the
music off. because i sometimes get bored by the music but i still like
when the cube &quot;clicks&quot; when i turn it.

Also one more thing. Could you keep a keyboard shortcut like the shift
key or something for turning two layers at a time. I mean like when i
prs shift and the right layer the rt layer plus the middle should turn
simultaneously. This is more quicker than turning the left side in the
opposite directn and then turning the whole cube again.

Anyways the software is awesome!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jasmine :-)

Yes i guess i was a bit wound up when i wrote my post. But the truth 
remains that many people do regard the Guiness book of world records 
as the De Facto reference for world records. And as such Guiness 
should have fair and reasonable regulations for accepting world 
records. Yes, we speedcubers know about all those useful resources 
on the net about cubing. I&#x27;m not worried about us. I&#x27;m worried about 
the 99.9% of the rest of the ppl who will seriously believe that 
16.53 is the best. And who knows, if they see better record 
somewehere they might think it&#x27;s fake. I think it&#x27;s actually a semi 
serious matter.

Well, there are worse things happening in the world than this ;-)

Cheers!

A _WILD_ guess (lol) is that all data presented is extracted from 
the same table in the database. So basically the number of moves is 
then treated like it was a time. Hence the 2 decimals in the listing 
on the webpage.

Have fun!

-Per

PS! I haven&#x27;t managed to use 23.9 or 23.97 moves yet ... hahaha :-P

Hey Tyson, Guinness is just nothing &quot;professional&quot;, and I don&#x27;t
trust Guinness at all. This is not even official. Those are just
people who try to make money by selling books.
The only Guinness I would trust is beer, the rest is just
&quot;une grosse plaisanterie&quot; as frenchies say.

Would you trust Guinness for tracks and fields records ?
You would be wrong.

I just made a quick check on :
http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com
for WRs on 100m, 110m hurdles, and 5000m.
They are ALL wrong :
- WR on 100m has been beaten last june, this is not updated ;
- 110m hurdle has been made again by a chinese during the last
  olympics in august 2004 : no mention about it, we still have
  Colin Powell only as the recordholder ;
- the time for 5000m is wrong again, despite the current record
  being 1 year and a half old.
If I want to know the truth, I don&#x27;t look into the guinness.
I *drink* a Guinness, and click on http://www.athlerecords.net/

Actually, Guinness is full of mistakes, in many fields, some
being rather funny like in mathematics.

I would say that :
- non-cubers who don&#x27;t really care about cubing, *may* look in
  the Guinness and find the wrong rubik record... so what ?
- non-cubers that may get interested into cubing will use Google
  and finally reach speedcubing.com. And they will just trust it
  and regard Guinness as b******t ;
- cubers just look at SC.com and the site is just great.

So I would just not bother with the Guinness book. This book
is just not serious at all. In all sports, only the federations
keep track of records. Guinness is to serious records what your
local newspaper is to serious scientific publications.
Just almost nothing.

Dear Mr Chen,

Thank you for your email.  We are sorry for the delay in replying to 
you.

Our website is in the process of being updated but we have recognised
Shotaro Makisumi as the record holder for some time.

Thank you again for your correspondence.

Yours sincerely,

Everbody who matters (i.e. we cubers) knows the truth, so what&#x27;s the 
problem? That Guiness exploits you? That&#x27;s life ;-)

I took an average of the Harmonic:
3.02 4.37 3.28 2.85 4.51 2.78 (2.73) 2.79 3.04 (DNF) 5.11 2.96 => 3.47

I also was taking a regular average, but it was destroyed by three bad
times:
1.20 1.29 1.22 1.22 1.21 (DNF) 3.22 1.18 1.16 1.18 2.35 (1.13) => 1.52

Even if I kept the DNF and got sub-2 for the 2.35 and 3.22, I&#x27;d be
happy. :(

          <div class="email-content">I often cube on the train. Sometimes no one pays any attention, but<br>
sometimes they do. Tonight was definitely the later. A group of four<br>
girls sitting across from me let out audible gasps when I finished a<br>
solve. I like to take any opportunity to promote cubing, so if anyone<br>
shows any interest on the train (or anywhere!) I&#x27;ll offer to do them<br>
another demo and ask them to do the scramble themselves (so they know<br>
it wasn&#x27;t &#x27;set up&#x27; and also to get them involved). I did a few more<br>
3x3x3 demos for them and they were very impressed. Then I whipped out<br>
the 4x4x4 and got them to scramble that too. :)<br>
<br>
Later during the train trip, another group of people got on. They were<br>
pretty amazed (&quot;Oh my goodness! Did you just solve that thing?!&quot;) and<br>
so I handed them my cube. I did several demos as various different<br>
people in train scrambled my cube. They timed one of the solves (32<br>
seconds) and then I got an applause from half the train carriage. When<br>
the train was approaching the final stop, which was also my stop,<br>
there was one guy left from the group. He&#x27;d been further down the<br>
carriage and hadn&#x27;t actually seen my solves, he&#x27;d just heard his<br>
friends talking (&quot;Wow! She just solved that in 32 seconds!&quot;) So<br>
obviously I offered to do a demo for him. :) He was completely blown<br>
away and asked me what I did. He then asked me if I was looking for a<br>
job and gave me his contact details!<br>
<br>
BTW, I beat my PB single solve tonight too - 22.23 seconds. :)<br>

Guinness, probably. Allthough lots of people also know about the 
internet. But really don&#x27;t think it matters that much, honestly.

We all know that anyone can learn to solve the cube if they have the
patience and commitment, but it&#x27;s cool that non-cubers assume that
anyone who can solve the cube pretty quickly is obviously brilliant! I
think we should use all use this to our advantage and put it in our
CVs. I have done this in the past (buried somewhere after educational
qualifications and employment history) and at one job interview it was
the first thing they commented on!

I have one. I didn&#x27;t know that there are so many possibilities. Thanks 
for showing me the web page. I was just solving it with all strings 
streight not touching each other. It was pretty boring. Now I&#x27;ll have 
more fun playing with it:)
Right now I would say if you are good at 3-D seeing brainstring should 
be pretty easy.
I&#x27;ll try out the solutions on the page, where the strings touch each 
other and let you know, if it&#x27;s more difficult or not.

          <div class="email-content">Other thing I meant to say is that I definitely recommend cubing in
public. It&#x27;s valuable pre-competition preparation. I get nervous
performing in competitions and my hands shake a bit and this has an
adverse effect on my times. My best time at my last competition was
4-5 seconds slower than my average at the time. :(

I&#x27;m hoping that my public cubing experience over the past month will
help me feel less nervous in competition! :)

they wouldn&#x27;t sell me one or two of it. They could only sell, imagine, <br>
at least 400 unities. I talked to the manager and told him how I would <br>
like to buy only one and that I use to solve the cube. You what? he <br>
said. I solve the cube, I answered. He scrambled one, hung it by the <br>
chain and challenging me said: As I never saw one solving this, if you <br>
do it it&#x27;s yours. My wife started laughing and the cube is now mine.<br>

not really difficult to get the strings untangled.

but making pretty tangled star patterns is a little
tricky.

to the ordinary person. s 12.11 solve and a 16.xx
solve  dont make much of a difference. if you can
solve it really fast under 20 sec they are alread
amazed.

PS: once you learn to solve the cube your done :-D

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve got a master magic now, too.  All of this talk about magic
inspired me to pull my old master magic out of the box.  I thought
that it had broken about 7 years ago, and never knew how to fix it. 
After closer examination, I determined that some of the tiles had been
twisted, but none of the strings were broken.  I was able to
reassemble it with the directions on Jaap&#x27;s page.

Congrats!! but bewarned, the MM&#x27;s are highly addictive  ;)
Before i made my master magic from scratch too, but it took a long 
time cuz the only time i have ever played with on before was at HM. 
and even tht was for like 5 min. It took me several hours because i 
messed up quite a few times. First i had to figure out (by my self) 
how the tiles lined up. Then i started stringing, but i strung it the 
normal way, so of course it didnt work. After trying like 10 
different ways to wire it, i just gave up. (it was like 5 am) The 
next day i re thought everything and finally put it together

I agree, if you dont have $40 to spend, make one!!
My PB is now 3.59, and its only like the 3-4 day ive had it!! (told 
you it was addictive) I hope to break 3 sec soon...(maybe)

Good luck with your MM!! Hope you enjoy it!

Peter Greenwood

P.S. -> And if you&#x27;re really adventurous, you could just use Linux
which does it all. In the rare case that you can&#x27;t find a free piece
of software to solve your problem, then write your own. :)

It is hilarious. They were talking to the head PR guy from the<br>

an international association for competitive eating!! I googled and<br>
found it here: http://www.ifoce.com/<br>

Anyway, the guy was saying that it really is a sport and they&#x27;ve been<br>
trying for ages to get it added as an Olympic sport!! He described the<br>
eaters as athletes.<br>
<br>
This is a much more crazy activity than speedcubing!!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi I have been hanging around this group for a few months, and this is<br>
my first posting<br>
<br>
I have been doing the cube for about 20 years now, and my best time is<br>
72 secs, using only about five algs. Basicaly do First Layer, do<br>
Center Layer turn around allingn cross, orient cross, allign corners,<br>
orient corners.<br>
<br>
I went out, bought myself a new cube and some silicon spray and lubed<br>
my cube.<br>
Downloaded the Fridrich method and started learning, that was about a<br>
week ago.<br>
<br>
I have a question. How do you guys do it. Do you remember the<br>
sequencing i.e. R U R&#x27; d&#x27; etc or is it just part of your muscle<br>
memmory. I know from learning those five algs i currently do, that<br>
they form part of my muscle memmory, I cannot tell you what I do, but<br>
when I do them they just go. In order to build up the muscle memory, I<br>
need to repeat the alg. over and over again.<br>
<br>
In order to repeat the alg I think the best would be to do a certain<br>
case, then reverse the alg. and do again etc. etc. and in doing so,<br>
most propably know the reverse just as well as the forward alg?<br>
<br>
What would you guys suggest?<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

I already have a very good job.

We all know that anyone can learn to solve the cube if they have the
patience and commitment, but it&#x27;s cool that non-cubers assume that
anyone who can solve the cube pretty quickly is obviously brilliant! I
think we should use all use this to our advantage and put it in our
CVs. I have done this in the past (buried somewhere after educational
qualifications and employment history) and at one job interview it was
the first thing they commented on!

          <div class="email-content">Hello goophy00!

The way I remember the moves (algorithms) is by memorizing the moves
but while doing that I see where the pieces go when I move them.
Typically I find it easier to memorize when algorithms are given in
triggers... for example: (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U) D (F R U). I just memorize the
first part: RU&#x27;R&#x27;U as one move, then D as another and then FRU as one.
Eventually after a while it will turn to muscle memory. But I don&#x27;t
keep repeating the algorithm. Try memorizing and soon you&#x27;ll remember
the feeling on your fingers. I hope this helps and good luck on the
Fridrich method!

Yes, the buttons are functional and necessary to solve the puzzle.

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s indeed muscle memory as you say. Even with the most simple ones
I have trouble doing it slowly when teaching someone.

When training any LL algs I start with a solved cube and execute it
over and over again untill I have a solved cube again. This is very
interesting (and pretty obvious if you think about it), some algs need
to be executed only twice, others 8 times, if after any execution the
F2L is messed up tou know you did something wrong ... It&#x27;s part of the
fun and it works with any LL alg.

Cheers,
Marco

Therefore, when you put it on your cube, it is semi transparent  <br>
(which looks awful since the cubies are black)<br>

Can you please show me one that needs 8 times? I don&#x27;t think this is 
possible.

I guess u are right stefan. Every scenario that is possibly order 8

          <div class="email-content">Hi Louis,
 
That&#x27;s where I was around 12 months ago.

I&#x27;ve been speedcubing for about a year now and I&#x27;m still learning 
OLL (I&#x27;m up to 23 at last count). I learnt PLL first though as there 
are fewer algs to learn. You might find that certain algs inverse 
others.

I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s easier to learn a new alg when there&#x27;s only one 
case and it&#x27;s mirror, eg. the &quot;W&quot; pattern OLL alg. But with other 
cases where there are more possibilities, eg.where two adjasent 
edges are to be oriented along with four corners (six all up which 
I&#x27;m still to learn), It&#x27;s easier to learn two at a time then try a 
different case to save getting confused. 

For me personally it&#x27;s easier to repeat a new alg as much as I can, 
I just need to remember that I&#x27;ve learnt the new alg for that case 
during a solve before doing the cross orientation that I would&#x27;ve 
automatically done before learning the new alg.  

Like someone else mentioned I too have trouble doing some algs 
slowly without messing them up.

BTW, I recently did a new PB of 26.72 sec (WOO HOO!!), still average 
in the 40&#x27;s though.


Cheers, Keith.

you how i learn algs.

What i do is try to make some connection between consequitive steps
and first just see the algo over and over again. Then i try it on the
cube and once that too is done i try to mentally imagine the whole
algorithm and do it backwards. That i recommend to everyone because if
u can do the alg backward by just imagining then you have surely got
the alg. I learn about 5-8 algs at a time and then revise them again
during my classes :)  After that i take a break and try to implement
them during the solves.

Happy cubing!
Sachin.

speedcubing seems to be well educated and has done well with their <br>
schooling, especially with mathematics.<br>
<br>
Well, I&#x27;m completely the oppossite, I had trouble with learning <br>
difficulties at school and was put into a slow learners class. <br>
Obviously I can read and write well enough but I absolutly suck at <br>
maths, even basic stuff.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve done a bit of research into dyslexia and found that I possess a <br>
lot of the symptoms that describe the problems that dyslexics have. <br>
The most prominant one&#x27;s being daydreaming and getting confused easily.<br>
I&#x27;m good with problem solving and being creative and I&#x27;m told I have a <br>
bit of a flair for writing.<br>
<br>
So you&#x27;re probably reading this and thinking  &quot;but dylexics can&#x27;t read <br>
or write&quot; which is the common missconseption.  <br>
<br>
What I really wanted to know is, are there any other speedcubers that <br>
have similar problems?<br>

Well, daydreaming for me anyway, is when you are not concentrating on 
your surroundings and your imagination takes over. Like having a dream 
when your awake. Sometimes they can feel like it&#x27;s really happening.

Well, I&#x27;m completely the oppossite, I had trouble with learning 
difficulties at school and was put into a slow learners class. 
Obviously I can read and write well enough but I absolutly suck at 
maths, even basic stuff.

I&#x27;ve done a bit of research into dyslexia and found that I possess a 
lot of the symptoms that describe the problems that dyslexics have. 
The most prominant one&#x27;s being daydreaming and getting confused easily.
I&#x27;m good with problem solving and being creative and I&#x27;m told I have a 
bit of a flair for writing.

So you&#x27;re probably reading this and thinking  &quot;but dylexics can&#x27;t read 
or write&quot; which is the common missconseption.  

What I really wanted to know is, are there any other speedcubers that 
have similar problems?


Cheers, Keith.

I cube daily on public transport (it is a good time to practise), but 
it doesn&#x27;t usually provoke much reaction beyond eye-rolling and the 
odd chuckle.  Maybe 3 or 4 times I&#x27;ve been asked a question about 
cubing.

Elsewhere (still in public) I&#x27;ve had coins thrown at me because 
I /wasn&#x27;t/ cubing... the total was only 17 pence. :(

Well, that&#x27;s nice.  I&#x27;ll just try to imagine that I have lots of 
admirers who are too shy to speak.  ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gunnar!

That can&#x27;t possibly be right? Order 13? Every algorithm (sequence of 
moves) has a cyclic decomposition (corners and edges). U have to 
repeat an algorithm a number of times to yield the state u started 
from. This number is equal to the least common multiple of the 
orders of all the subcycles produced by this algorithm. Hence the 
overall order can&#x27;t be a prime number (unless 2 or 3 or 5 or 7 or 
11). The 7 and 11 could be corner cycles of those respective order. 
Im now talking general of coz, not necessarily restricted to LL. So 
i can&#x27;t see how order 13 can be possible.

Ok, i checked w FMC Companion now. Ur given algorithm has order 12. 
So probably just wrongly spelt from ur side ... ;-)

Cheers,

I can&#x27;t speedcube on the train, people ask me to stop because it&#x27;s

Bwahahahahaha.  Victory.

After much playing around with my 4x4 (read: working), I found a simple move to swap two center pieces on adjacent sides.  Using this move, coupled with r2u2r2u2, I&#x27;ve managed to solve my 4x4 with this new method.  Also, I&#x27;ve found a way around the difficult parity, but it&#x27;s intuitive and difficult.  I still think someone out there has to know a simpler way to fix this.  Anywho, November is creeping up quickly, and I&#x27;d like to be ready by then, so if Per could just share all his secrets right now, that would be great. =)

  One problem I found with this method is too many slice moves. I Can&#x27;t
  do fast slice moves for my life, but if you can do &#x27;em it could be
  fast. Which commuter do you use for two edges left?

  For centers, r2b2r2b2, ldl&#x27; U ld&#x27;l&#x27; U&#x27;, and r&#x27;urUr&#x27;u&#x27;d&#x27;rU&#x27;r&#x27;dr are nice.

Don&#x27;t forget that there is stuff on that DVD that is not on the

That is almost perfectly correct, but we can allow two turns at a time
in the same plane! This is how it works:

- The first move can be any move
- The seconds move can be any move EXCEPT one on the same face as the last turn
- The next 23 moves can be any move EXCEPT one on the same face as the
last turn and it cannot be in the same plane as the last turn if the
last turn and the one before it are also in the same plane. Thus only
two turns in a row can be in the same plane.

If we just said that each turn had to be in a different plane, then we
would get a scramble like:

R U L&#x27; F L B ....

This is fine, but it doesn&#x27;t allow for all possible positions of the
cube, a scramble like this is more desirable:

F B&#x27; U R D U2 ...

Notice that some turns are in the same plane!

Gilles, your tiles are bad.  Behind every color should be a solid 
white backing coat.  I&#x27;m sure that no more that 20 sets went out 
like this and they should have all been the new textured version.

I&#x27;ll post pictures today on my site of a bad/good tile.

thanks eveyone, and sorry for the trouble.

My description doesn&#x27;t disallow sequences like &quot;F B&quot;.  My way of
thinking it may be simpler or more complex depending on your point of
view.  The logic that you stated is one possible way of implementing
my description.

Here&#x27;s another possible implementation.  Keep track of the faces that
can possibly be the next turn.  Initially, all faces are in this set. 
Now repeat this 25 times:  Pick a face randomly from the set to turn. 
Remove that face from the set.  Place all of the faces that are
adjacent to that face back in the set if they are not there already.

Both implementations are equivalent.  The method I desribed has the
advantage that the rules for picking a face don&#x27;t differ on the first,
second and remaining steps.  The method probably has other
disadvantages, but that isn&#x27;t my point.  My point is that my
description is perfectly correct (as far as I can tell).

I guess I just misunderstood this statement:

>is turned, it is not allowed to be turned again until an adjacent face
>is turned.

I read it as: &quot;once a face is turned, moves in the same plane are not
allowed to be turned until an adjacent face is turned.&quot;

That is a different way of looking at it then I have done in the
past...it&#x27;s cool to think about it that way. Thanks for correcting me.

Another nice feature of the algorithm I described is that it works on
puzzles with more than 6 faces, like the the Megaminx:

Really?

I cube on on the train everytime... But usually, I don&#x27;t go full speed 
when I am one the train, because I don&#x27;t want to make too much noise. 
So I try to cube slowly and fluently, which is also good practice. And 
my 4x4 and 5x5 (eastsheens) don&#x27;t make much noise, so I can do those 
too :).

I wouldn&#x27;t dare solving those cubes outdoor at all. To me those are 
mean popping machines ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hehe, I reinvented one of the algorithms... I mean the one to orient 
two adjacent corners (that you solve with the theta algorithm). I had 
seen yours and noticed it&#x27;s shorter than mine but since I had the pc 
turned off I looked for a shorter one myself and found the same (well, 
somewhat mirrored, since I solve left-handed and your F is my U). And 
then today I got the same case for 3x3 cube OLL and used the new 
algorithm (cause I don&#x27;t yet have a good alg for that) which resulted 
in a PLL skip. Proof enough that this alg is good, huh?

Hey, try this 2-gen alg (for Megaminx, of course):
R / F / R&#x27; / F / R / F&#x27;&#x27; / R&#x27;&#x27; / F&#x27;&#x27; / R / F / R&#x27; / F / R

P.S. How about a naming scheme for Megaminx cases ;-)

Yeah ok, it&#x27;s maybe better to not use a cube that may make you angry 
and throw it out the window, particularly if you&#x27;re in a train.

          <div class="email-content">ADD and ADHD are forms of dyslexia in the way that the person 
experiences &quot;disorientations&quot; which is were some other symptoms kick 
in, like getting letters mixed up. One of my young nephews has been 
diagnosed with ADD and another (like myself) only began talking when 
he was 4 years old. Some people say that letters and words swim around 
or shimmer on the page. dyslexia.com is a very good source of 
information on the subject.

<br>
On the topic of the Dyslexic cubers It will be interesting to know the<br>
average IQ of the group. Even if you are Dyslexic (Why is the word for<br>
people who can&#x27;t spell such a difficult one to spell), or have ADD and<br>
do bad at math it doesnt mean that you have a low IQ. People with a<br>
High IQ have an affinity for problem solving, such as the rubicks<br>
cube. I am of the oppinion that the group average would be at least<br>
125, where the general population average is 100.<br>
<br>
If you which to know your own IQ you could do an online test (Not very<br>
accurate) or go to your local MENSA and take a test for a fee. <br>
To find your local MENSA try Google.<br>

thought I&#x27;d see what opinions this group has about the best approach <br>
to try next.<br>
<br>
First, my story. I first cubed back in high school in Texas <br>
(1980/1981) - I used a layer-by-layer method, turning with my whole <br>
hand, and got to the point where I could average about 1:10-1:15, <br>
which was decent back then and helped me do well in local <br>
competitions. This was back before the Internet, before anyone in my <br>
area knew of the Fridrich or finger tricks or any of that &quot;new-<br>
fangled&quot; cubing :-)<br>
<br>
Fast forward to November 2004, when I pick up a cube at Target. <br>
Looking for info on the web, I find the San Francisco competition in <br>
Jan 2005. Re-learned my old layer-by-layer method, went to SF and <br>
did alright (1:05-1:10).<br>
<br>
After being impressed by the incredible times at the competition, I <br>
wanted to get faster. My first step was to learn cross/F2L, which <br>
brought me to consistently to below a minute. Changing my LL <br>
approach from (permute corners, orient corners, permute edges, <br>
orient edges) to (orient edges, permute corners, orient corners, <br>
permute edges) took me to around 50-55 seconds. Lubing up the cube <br>
and a lot of practice took me to around a 50 second average, with a <br>
best of 47 second average (and occasional times below 41 seconds).<br>
<br>
Since I was still turning with my hands, with the cross on top, I <br>
realized it was probably time to start learning a better approach. I <br>
switched over to cross on bottom and started learning finger turning.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s where I was a couple months ago, and since then progress has <br>
been very slow. I&#x27;m just now getting back to 50 second averages, but <br>
not quite yet. I seem plagued by mistakes and brain stalls and the <br>
occasional jam or slip.<br>
<br>
At this point, I&#x27;m looking at various ideas on how to get faster, <br>
and I thought I&#x27;d run them by the group and see what thoughts people <br>
have. I&#x27;m also restricted by the fact that I&#x27;ve got a pretty busy <br>
life: work, family, kids, etc, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to <br>
devote to cubing. So, I&#x27;m looking for the best &quot;bang for the buck&quot;, <br>
in terms of effort - both short term (in prep for the Norcal <br>
tournament in a month) and longer term.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s my ideas:<br>
<br>
- learn OLL/PLL. This seems like a lot of work, and while it would <br>
make me faster (due to cutting moves down to around 60 from my <br>
current 80) I&#x27;m not sure I can get through OLL/PLL in any time. <br>
Eventually, long term, I&#x27;ll have to do this.<br>
<br>
- learn just PLL. I could switch my LL approach to (orient sides, <br>
orient corners, PLL). The PLL would be easier to learn (21? algs), <br>
but I&#x27;m not too sure about what the benefit would be (maybe cut out <br>
10 moves?).<br>
<br>
- better cube. Not as sure about this one - my cubes seem pretty <br>
good (esp the 25th anniv ones), I could make them a little slicker <br>
but I&#x27;m not sure I could easily control them. I might get more jams <br>
and slips (this has happened in the past).<br>
<br>
- faster moves. I could work on making my sequences faster. I&#x27;m <br>
unsure about this one, since total time is (find sequence + perform <br>
sequence), faster sequences could help but there&#x27;s still <br>
the &quot;search&quot; time.<br>
<br>
- practice &quot;lookahead&quot;. I could work on being better about <br>
recognizing the next sequence, especially during F2L. This follows <br>
with the &quot;F2L is everything&quot; philosophy discussed in group.<br>
<br>
- practice technique. Work on being clean with my movements, with <br>
the hope of reducing jams and keeping movements clean.<br>
<br>
- slow down. Following with the &quot;go slower to go faster&quot; philosophy, <br>
I could slow down on sequences with the hope of finding the next <br>
sequence faster. This is an analog to the &#x27;practice lookahead&#x27; above.<br>
<br>
So, what do you folks think? I&#x27;ve got some ideas, but I&#x27;d like to <br>
hear other&#x27;s opinions as well - what could I tackle, both short-term <br>
(in the next month) and long term in order to get faster??<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help!<br>

No, last time I checked, my IQ was about 45, but feel it could be a bit 
lower now.
Anyway, it&#x27;s still too much for speedcubing.

I&#x27;m also lower, I&#x27;ve checked several times and it looks like the older 
I get the closer I get to sub20.

Why not? I mean, isn&#x27;t that&#x27;s how the world is supposed to work, i.e. 
noncubers feeding cubers? Damn, if that&#x27;s not true, then I have to 
rethink my life plans...

If I count welll : 90 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 95
Where are the last 5% of the people ? They are aliens who can&#x27;t take

          <div class="email-content">It sounds like you have a good idea of what you need to do.  The
following tips are based on what people told me to do to get better:

1. Make sure you have a decent cube.  It sounds like you do already.

2. Make sure you are doing the F2L properly.  Rather than focusing on
the clock for a while, focus on the number of turns that you are
taking.  You should be able to complete the first two layers in fewer
than 35 turns consistently.

3. Learn the PLL.  This will let you do a three step LL.  I&#x27;ve heard
that people can get to at least the low 20&#x27;s with this method.  And
after you learn the PLL, you can start learning the OLL.

4. After you are comfortable with #2, practice solving the first two
layers at a constant pace of one or two turns per second with no
pauses.  This excercise is useful for getting rid of pauses when you
are going faster.

 (my best average is 20.16 and I know 20/22 PLL and 32/57 OLL;-))<br>
<br>
so, F2L is really the main point to gain time at first, then try to<br>
accelerate your LL by switching from a 3-look to a 2-look method.<br>
<br>
Anoter important point is to train with some regularity (example :<br>
once a day), even if it&#x27;s not for a long time. You could try to train<br>
in the public transportations because this will put you under stress<br>
(if people are looking at you), you&#x27;ll have some disurbance (noise,<br>
unexpected shock,...) which is a good training for the competition.<br>
:-)<br>
<br>
Good luck :-)<br>

The timer I used was made by Dennis Webb.  I don&#x27;t remember the web address of where I got it, but if you search the group for that guys name, then you can find the post.
 
Tyson, I caught that solve on tape last week.   The solve was 10.29 seconds non lucky, and can be seen on strangepuzzle.com

          <div class="email-content">I was in Las Vegas about a month ago (for two weeks) and was waiting
to see the Blue Man Group. It was about 45 minutes until the door
opened, so I took my bag off and sat down to solve the cube. About 40
minutes later I had $32 sitting on my bag because people kept putting
money down.

I should take the drive down to Seattle and see if it works there too. :)

          <div class="email-content">At school last year, Joe Spadafora and I were in line for dinner.  Joe<br>
was in the middle of doing a solve, and this kid in front of us turns<br>
around and says &quot;If you can solve that in under 10 minutes I&#x27;ll give<br>
you $5000.&quot;  So Joe extended his hand and they shook on it.  A few<br>
seconds later he finished his solve and the kid was pretty amazed. <br>
Unfortunately he didn&#x27;t have $5000 cash on him to give so Joe didn&#x27;t<br>
get it.  It&#x27;s funny though because to a non cuber, $5000 to solve<br>
in 10 minutes seems like a safe bet.<br>
<br>
Then there was another time that Joe and I were cubing in my dorm<br>
room.  The guy that lived  next to me had a bunch of people over and<br>
they were all REALLY wasted.  He knocks on my door and asks us to cube<br>
for them in his room.  We go over there, and they mix up our cubes,<br>
and then he says &quot;the winner of this race gets a blowjob from his<br>
choice of girl in this room, and the loser gets kicked in the nuts by<br>
all of us.&quot;  Of course, this was when Joe was still faster than me, so<br>
he won.  :(<br>
<br>
Ahh... good times cubing with Joe.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I had two rather inebriated patrons come into the gas station I was working <br>
at a while back.  One of them saw the cube sitting on top of the register I <br>
was at and proceeded to tell me at length about how impossible they were.  <br>
So, I nonchalantly picked it up and nodded politely as he was talking and <br>
solved it in about 25 seconds.  He nearly wet himself.<br>
<br>
He excitedly explained to his friend that I had just solved it in slightly <br>
over 2 minutes.  I was a tad miffed.  I was no speed demon at the time, <br>
especially under no inspection circumstances, but two minutes hurt me deep.  <br>
I corrected him, and he challenged me to a timed solve.  I accepted, and <br>
solved in 24 seconds.  I then performed two more sub 25 solves, which he <br>
witnessed and saw the stopwatch.  I was feeling pretty good for no <br>
inspection.<br>
<br>
Then, the alcohol kicked in.  He, after having seen me solve (with a timer) <br>
sub 25 three times, challenged me to solve it in under 30, to the tune of <br>
$3, which was all he had on him, sadly.  I solved the cube in 21, dropped <br>
the stopwatch, picked it up and handed it to him, and he saw it at 24.  I <br>
told him to keep his money, because it wasn&#x27;t a fair bet.  He mumbled in <br>
unintelligible drunk speak something about &#x27;amazing&#x27; and &#x27;circus&#x27;, threw the <br>
money on the counter, and left, telling his disinterested friend about how I <br>
just blew his mind.<br>
<br>
I took the money, and those three dollars are still hiding in my dresser as <br>
a trophy.<br>

the cube. Let&#x27;s not tell them that anyone<br>

<br>
just a funny encounter:<br>
<br>
Today in the bank was the second time I got the same reaction: &quot;Are <br>
you a rocket scientist?&quot;. I simply replied: &quot;no, but I am a computer <br>
scientist&quot;. <br>
Her: &quot;Oh, thank God for you, now we have Dell computers. Now I still <br>
can&#x27;t remember my password&quot;<br>
Me: (no reply to that)<br>
--- Me moving into PLL just finishing up with last 3 moves<br>
&quot;Can you actually solve that?&quot;<br>
--- Solved. <br>
Me: &quot;ehm yes, apparantly&quot;<br>
Her: &quot;Oh my God you solved it. How often have you solved it?&quot;<br>
--- I really couldn&#x27;t think of an answer that would be correct or <br>
something witty and I just didn&#x27;t want to give her an approximation <br>
and have her fall off her chair or anything<br>
Me: I can just solve it<br>
Her: &quot;How long does it take you&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;under 30 seconds&quot;<br>
--- see I don&#x27;t ever want people to be very disappointed. I once did <br>
a demo of 19 seconds, but that is not a very common time for me.<br>
Me: &quot;actually most of us can solve it that fast, a lot of us even <br>
faster&quot;<br>
Her: &quot;You seriously mean there are more like you?&quot;<br>
--- this was getting creapy. Are we some alien life form? Maybe to <br>
non-cubers it does seem like that<br>
<br>
anyway, still a nice conversation. I tend to get a lot more attention <br>
from the tourists then from the locals. I think people on vacation <br>
are not as worried with daily life and like the <br>
distraction/attraction.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I had another &#x27;cubing on the train&#x27; encounter yesterday. I was at the<br>
train station waiting for my train. As usual, I was cubing while<br>
waiting. A guy sat down about two seats away and after a few moments<br>
he said &quot;Excuse me, did I see you in a magazine recently?&quot; To which I<br>
replied &quot;TNT Magazine? Yep, that was me.&quot; We proceeded to talk about<br>
cubing till the train arrived, and then as we were catching the same<br>
train we sat together and I explained my beginner method. He then<br>
asked me where he should go to buy cubes! :)<br>
<br>
Cubing moments like this on trains are cool. Sometimes people make<br>
really really lame comments though. The other day a guy said to me &quot;Do<br>
you solve that often? Is that how you know how to do it?&quot; What I was<br>
thinking, but didn&#x27;t actually say, was &quot;Yes, there are only 43+<br>
quintillion configurations so I figured if I randomly work through<br>
them I&#x27;ll eventually get there!&quot; (Duh, obviously there&#x27;s a system!)<br>
<br>
Then tonight I was out with some friends and, as usual, I had my cube<br>
out. When the waitress came by she commented on the cubes. My friends<br>
told her that I could solve it really quickly and so I offered to do a<br>
demo. I got her to scramble and then time me. After thousands and<br>
thousands of solves, I can generally make a pretty good estimate of<br>
the time of my solves and this one felt like low 30s (my current<br>
avaerage). The waitress looked at her watch and said 3 minutes!! I<br>
told her it definitely wasn&#x27;t 3 mins and that it was much more like<br>
30s and she didn&#x27;t believe me. When she left, my friend said that he<br>
agreed she was definitely very wrong and you don&#x27;t need to have a<br>
watch to know that the brief period of time that passed was no where<br>
near 3 minutes. Then my friend joked that we certainly wouldn&#x27;t want<br>
her adjudicating at a competition! I&#x27;m not sure how she came up with 3<br>
minutes since she was the one who had the watch!!<br>

I&#x27;m living in London at the moment and I&#x27;ve noticed that many of the
people who actually come and ask me about the cube when they see me
cubing are not English. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they&#x27;re tourists
though as there are so many different people from everywhere who live
in London.

The other thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it&#x27;s pretty much always guys
who&#x27;ll come and talk to me about cubing. It&#x27;s very rarely girls, and
when it is a girl, she&#x27;ll just make a brief comment (&#x27;wow, that&#x27;s
impressive!&#x27; or &#x27;you solved that thing so quickly!&#x27;). The girls are
never interested in the actual solving or method or logic or anything
like that. It&#x27;s only the guys who ask me more detailed questions about
the cube and how to solve it.

This is not really that surprising though. I think we all know that
any girl who is really interested in cubing is an anomaly!! :)

yea.. im in the low 20s and one of my friend&#x27;s only knows half of the
OLLs and is a sub-18 cuber. so pll definitely helps (though i think
f2l makes much more of a difference)

if you want to train for the norcal competition, get your f2l to be
amazing. imo, it will help more.

Well, there should only be 4 green corners and 4 green edges pieces. I
counted 5 green edge pieces. There are 2 green/yellow edges. (Getting
close...) The one on the left and far bottom faces of the cross
diagram. Yet I don&#x27;t know which one of those green edges should be
orange. I suppose you could run a parity check on the edges and deduct
that way which green should be orange.

I picked up a cube again in September 2003 after a 20 years lay off.  Had to 
work out my new strategies and algorithms and have done a lot of one handed 
cubing in that time but for the last 6 months or so I&#x27;ve averaged under 35 
seconds but never put in that extra effort to get under 30.

Agreed.

But if it&#x27;s for a piece of artwork, why not just scramble a cube and 
paint its portrait? :S

Haha!  I wonder if it&#x27;s really going to be one of those &quot;What is wrong 
with this picture?&quot; puzzles for children. You know the kind of thing: 
woman with 2 left hands, door-handle on the hinged side of the door, 
dog with 3 legs, and... cube with one orange facelet coloured green?!

websites.

And why are you thinking &quot;Kids...&quot;?

majority are guys still, but i know a number of girl

and with shelly chang solving (quite well, i might
add) in a lot of events (including bld) i don&#x27;t think
that girls are all that uncommon anymore, and we will
see the numbers even out soon, especially since cubing
is becoming more popular.

Did you see the new world record posted on speedcubing.com earlier 
today? It&#x27;s already gone, but John had posted an 18.xy onehanded 
solve. Did you see that one before it was removed again? And I thought 
&quot;Kids&quot; partly because I think he&#x27;s around 17 years old.

It&#x27;s just so much faster than anyone else (didn&#x27;t know about Ryan&#x27;s

Also maybe I&#x27;m just in suspicion mode today. I&#x27;m participating in a 
programming contest and saw the results of the qualification round

It would be awsome to watch.

Yes Ron is on vacation and I am updating the records while he is gone.
 He will be back August 31.

I&#x27;m sorry that something went weird with your record.  Ron has backups
of the records files on his computer, so we can check and see what
went wrong when he gets back.  As far as right now, go ahead and send
in your 18.00 average again and I will post it the next time I update.

Are you sure your 18.00 had been on the page? I&#x27;ve noticed sometimes 
my submissions just get lost somehow and never appear.

Ok, it looks like some of the tiles shipped between 7/24/05 and <br>

placed between those dates and am resending all the tiles from those <br>

to just play it safe and resend them all.<br>
 I&#x27;ll send a confirmation to each person as I ship them.  All the bad <br>

          <div class="email-content">well just scrambling a cube 
and painting its portrait was the idea

but i&#x27;m slightly colourblind
and the shades of green and orange are very similar
and so in transferring them to the sketch (which i posted)
i made a mistake

having further scrambled the cube in the meantime
i could no longer work out where the mistake was

it doesn&#x27;t take a cuber to work out 
that ten green squares isn&#x27;t right
but it does take one to work out 
which one is the wrong one

though i did consider painting the mistaken version
i&#x27;m going to paint the corrected one
which is why i asked

i thank you for your responses
and, as i say
when the paintings are finished
i&#x27;ll post pics in the cube art folder

Well *thank you* for your respect for the cube :-)

Most artists never care about whether they get it right. Recently I 
saw a box that looked like a cube, it was large and stylish etc and 
the seller wanted lots of money for it. And it had two yellow centers 
:-(. When I asked about this he (or she?) got pretty angry at me ;-)

Plus, not even on the official Rubik&#x27;s boxes that the cubes are sold 
in, or on their booklets, did the artists get them right. The pictures 
on the Rubik&#x27;s Magic box and in the booklet are also very wrong. Sigh.
..

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hey Joël,

The only thing I can think of is that the excel file Ron is using now
has a macro to save the HTML file, which I had never used before (I
stopped doing updates all the time a few months ago).

It took me a while to figure out how to get the macro setup, so maybe
something went weird when I tried to save the HTML file?

I&#x27;ll ask Ron when he gets back.

If anyone did have a record go weird and revert back to an earlier
one, just send it in again and put something in the post somewhere
about how your old record got changed.  I&#x27;ll fix any stray ones that
went weird, and then ask Ron what could have happened.

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Fridrich&#x27;s page shows all the algs as if cross was on top, which I  
dislike because she says to have cross on bottom.
I actually started learning them cross on top when I first learned  
F2L, but it&#x27;s just silly, cuz you can&#x27;t see anything else that&#x27;s  
going on.

          <div class="email-content">I had completely the opposite issue! I was still getting ID-ed at 27
years old in Australia if I tried to buy alcohol. For my US friends, I
should point out that the legal drinking age in Australia is 18 years,
so getting ID-ed at 27 years is pretty funny.

I&#x27;m about to turn 29 years old in 2 days and everyone always assumes
I&#x27;m younger that this. In case you are curious, I have some pics of
myself (with Dan Harris) from the 25th anniversary cube promo stuff we
did last month:

I don&#x27;t think anyone there thought I was almost a decade older than
Dan! :)

Jasmine, are you saying that Dan looks old? Just kidding. He hasn&#x27;t 
even got beard or moustache ;-)

I&#x27;m also having great fun letting girls who don&#x27;t know me well guess 
my age. It&#x27;s very nice when they guess i&#x27;m mid to late 20&#x27;s or even 
early 30&#x27;s. I turned 40 exactly 3 weeks ago :D Maybe it&#x27;s the cubing 
keeping us young ? :-P

Maybe i should dress up like a girl and go on a train-trip there in 
UK and show off cubing in order to get a job offer ... hehe ;-)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Nah, Dan definitely does not look old! :)

Recently, heaps more people have approached me while I&#x27;ve been cubing
on the train or in other public places - it happens a couple of times
a week now. I wondered why the sudden change and I came up with two
ideas based on the timing of the change.

My first thought was because there was a fair bit of publicity about
the cube in the UK in July for the 25th anniversary of the cube. I
wondered if maybe it got people reminicising about the cube they used
to own adn therefore more likely to talk to someone they saw cubing. 

Another possibility, which someone else reminded me of, was that there
were other significant events last month in London. It was suggested
to me that after the train bombings last month, people are generally
more observant about what&#x27;s going on around them on the train and
particularly things that are unusual.

I like to think that it&#x27;s the former - much happier to think about
cube birthday celebrations! :)

BTW, Per, I saw you in some pics on someones website from the Euros
last year and I definitely didn&#x27;t think you were almost 40 then!

          <div class="email-content">I used to do *everything* with cross on top. It was such a crappy way
to do things, but I until I found this group and everyone&#x27;s website I
didn&#x27;t know any better.

I found it *really* difficult to change after years of cross on top,
so I highly recommend that people just learn it with cross on bottom
to begin with. I have now moved to having the cross somewhere between
top and left for forming the actual cross, then I have the cross on
the left for most of the F2L, and I do most of the LL with cross on
bottom. There&#x27;s just one or two PLLs that I do with cross on left.

standing start of 12.11 sec (29.72 km/h, or 18.47 mph) at Las Vegas, 
Nevada, USA, on March 25, 1994. His unicycle talents have achieved 
him eight Guinness World Records, taken him to 36 countries and won 
him appearances on 75 TV shows.&quot; 

I wonder, what&#x27;s his best average of 12? ;)

Onderwerp: Re: [Speed cubing group] wife? kids? what?!?


I had completely the opposite issue! I was still getting ID-ed at 27
years old in Australia if I tried to buy alcohol. For my US friends, I
should point out that the legal drinking age in Australia is 18 years,
so getting ID-ed at 27 years is pretty funny.

I&#x27;m about to turn 29 years old in 2 days and everyone always assumes
I&#x27;m younger that this. In case you are curious, I have some pics of
myself (with Dan Harris) from the 25th anniversary cube promo stuff we
did last month:

&lt;http://speedcuber.blogspot.com/2005/07/25th-anniversary-of-rubiks-cube.html
> 

I don&#x27;t think anyone there thought I was almost a decade older than
Dan! :)

It&#x27;s a great time killer at stop lights. I noticed I feel much less
stressed with traffic since I started doing that.

Hey Craig, 

I am pretty sure (98%) we will use the &#x27;old&#x27;- first generation timers. 
Most people are used to these timers. I think I would also prefer that 
version of the timer :).

<br>
Some company has asked me to help them with a promotional video or <br>
commercial... And I accepted, of course :). Pretty exited about this! <br>
The want me solve some cubes, and the video should express something <br>
like &#x27;complex problems, short and fast solutions&#x27;. The goal is not to <br>
do it as fast as possible, but they want to close-up on my hands and <br>
see some cool and fluent finger-trick action. It&#x27;s the first time I am <br>
actually going to earn a little money by solving cubes :). Not much <br>
probably, but I can use all little bits when I am in Florida!! The <br>
shooting of the video will take place next tuesday... They want me to <br>
come in a nice fancy suit :).<br>
<br>
Well.. Just wanted to share this with you guys.<br>

See you :),<br>

Hey everybody,

Some company has asked me to help them with a promotional video or 
commercial... And I accepted, of course :). Pretty exited about this! 
The want me solve some cubes, and the video should express something 
like &#x27;complex problems, short and fast solutions&#x27;. The goal is not to 
do it as fast as possible, but they want to close-up on my hands and 
see some cool and fluent finger-trick action. It&#x27;s the first time I am 
actually going to earn a little money by solving cubes :). Not much 
probably, but I can use all little bits when I am in Florida!! The 
shooting of the video will take place next tuesday... They want me to 
come in a nice fancy suit :).

Well.. Just wanted to share this with you guys.

See you :),

          <div class="email-content">Hey Bram,

I am not sure if it&#x27;s really a commercial that is meant to be
broadcasted on national television. I think it might be something for
a more specific group of people, maybe just to put it on a website or
something. Anyway, I will try to ask them if they can send me a
digital version of it, I am pretty sure that should be possible.

Does it actually help to sand the internals of a 3x3x3 cube? -- i.e., 
not just to deal with molding defects, but perhaps to reduce the 
frequency of lock-ups.  If so, does anyone know of pictures showing 
where to do this, and how much to sand away?

I thought I had read it was not legal to sand your cube for anything 
other than to remove manufacturing defects? It was a while ago that 
I read that, so I can&#x27;t confirm the source. Can anyone else verify 
this?

I&#x27;m doing that sometimes. I noticed some of my cubes have quite sharp 
edges (not edge pieces, but internal edges of pieces) that lock up too 
often. So I rounded them more. Mainly the &quot;cubic edges&quot;, though 
(Imagine the pieces as small perfect cubes and round the edges that 
are actually there, that is for 3x3, I round three edges of each 
corner piece and four 0.7 edges of each edge pieces). Another reason I 
got this idea was because the Deluxe/Game cubes pretty much never lock 
up and they&#x27;re a bit more rounded than other cubes, I think. I&#x27;m gonna 
do it with an Eastsheen 5x5 some (very long ;-) day, too.

Cheers!
Stefan

Probably nobody can verify that. Have a look at Article 3 of the 
rules, I guess that&#x27;s what you meant:
http://www.speedcubing.com/events/regulations_draft2005.html

This is the new draft and explains with examples what&#x27;s not allowed. 
So for example if you sand the internals so much that you can rotate 
the 9 centers of your 5x5 cube alone, that&#x27;s not allowed. But if you 
sand them just so that the X-centers don&#x27;t get accidentally rotated 
all the time thanks to locking up, that&#x27;s ok.

Cheers!
Stefan

Thanks, Stefan. I had been going on the pretence that it was not 
allowed.  I was sure I had read that somewhere, so I did some quick 
searching and found the page (it is in the 5th paragraph after the 
section header &quot;Rubik&#x27;s.com cube speedcube&quot;):

http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/Speedcube/makinga.htm

Since it was on the speedcubing.com site, I think I must have taken 
it as law. But I realize now that it is not an official document, 
like the one you provided.  So I am glad this has been cleared up.

          <div class="email-content">Greetings,<br>
<br>
We want to thank everyone from the online cubing community who has <br>
been kind enough to send us their comments, ideas, and suggestions.  <br>
Over the past week, we have accumulated some great ideas from you <br>
folks as to how we can make our product better!  Please keep sending <br>
us feedback and continue to try out the new versions as we post them.<br>
<br>
The biggest change in the new version is related to the comments <br>
we&#x27;ve received about wanting an alternate method of orienting your <br>
view of the cube.  So, without losing the existing freedom of <br>
rotation, we have added a secondary way to change your view of the <br>
cube.  Holding down the left shift key while rotating a slice of the <br>
cube will turn the *entire* cube 90 degrees (or 180 if you also have <br>
the left CTRL key down) in the same axis/direction the single slice <br>
would have moved.  This eases the ability to &#x27;flip&#x27; the cube around <br>
and see the backside without losing your current perspective on the <br>
cube.  Thanks to Joël van Noort for this suggestion!<br>
<br>
An in-game help screen has been added that details all the available <br>
controls as well.  The change log for the demo project is now posted <br>
on the downloads page of our website (http://www.gabbasoft.com) if <br>
anyone is interested in seeing everything that has been modified to <br>
date.<br>
<br>
Again, thanks so much for all of your input and we hope you will <br>
continue to send us your thoughts and ideas for making our product <br>
better.<br>

These cubic edges (i.e. the ones that would also be part of the edges 
on a complete cube) have worn quite sharp on my cube&#x27;s corner pieces.

> four 0.7 edges of each edge pieces). 

What do you mean by &quot;0.7 edges&quot;?  When you auctioned a speedcube 
recently, I thought from the picture that the &quot;circular edges&quot; might 
have been modified. That&#x27;s one reason I posted my question, btw.

they form part of the circle that you see when you remove all the 
pieces of one layer.  Um... it&#x27;s hard to describe things clearly...]

Had also wondered about the Eastsheens, but I don&#x27;t want to risk one 
yet.  Good luck with finding the time &amp; energy... ;)

Yeah.. I have been working on a DIY cube today.. Was very carefull 
with the knives :). Usually I cut myself a lot :).

Still 2 more DIY&#x27;s to assamble.

I think this page is a bit old already. Ton has added a few things at 
some point but I think it&#x27;s older than the WCA rules. Also, Dan Gosbee 
I think once came up with very strict rules for WC 2003. For example, 
I remember someone had the idea to glue very strong little magnets 
under the center caps instead of glueing them to the center piece, and 
Dan said that&#x27;s not allowed (maybe even that you&#x27;d be disqualified). 
So that kind of rules might&#x27;ve been around earlier, but not anymore.

Cheers!
Stefan

Yeah, I know what you mean. That cube actually came mainly that way, I 
did round other edges but those circular parts had been that way 
already (the picture might give a too strong impression, btw, it&#x27;s not 
that much different than a normal edge piece). First I thought it 
would be bad but surprisingly it isn&#x27;t. With &quot;0.7 edges&quot; I meant the 
straight part, maybe it&#x27;s closer to 0.6, anyway it&#x27;s not a &quot;whole&quot; 
edge because of the circular cut (which I didn&#x27;t sand except its edges 
a bit, i.e. I did sand the outer edge of the circular edge of the edge 
piece ;-).

          <div class="email-content">Take your cube to the beach. Try to avoid getting sand into your cube
and some will still get in there but not very much. Then play with it
in the sun (wear sunblock) for an hour or so then go home and clean
your cube out really well and relube it.

The disease is catching. :)
Thanks for the explanation of the &quot;0.7 edge&quot;!

Skeneegee:  I like the literal interpretation of &quot;sanding&quot;, but hate 
cubing (or doing anything much) in the sun.  ;)

That&#x27;s simple.  Each INDIVIDUAL case has the exact same likelyhood of
occuring.  For example.  A pure PLL skip is 1/288.  There are 288
distinct PLL cases (count them! :))  But, you can consider that if the
cube is only U/U&#x27;/U2 away from solved, it is also a PLL skip.  So
there are 4/288 PLL skips => 1/72.  Now take for example, something
like the H-perm (edges cross perm).  You will find it has the same
probability.  Look now at an edge 3-cycle.  There are the 4 cases to
align the edge (do nothing, U&#x27;, U, U2).  However, the &quot;solved&quot; edge
can be any of the 4 colors.  So, we have 4*4 = 16/288 = 1/18 chance
for a particular edge cycle.  The other edge cycle is the same. Look
at the Z-perm.  There are only two angles to apply the algorithm that
result in a different permutation (ignoring the AUF at the end).  So,
There is a 2*4 = 8/288 = 1/36 chance of getting the Z-perm.  Etc.

For OLLs, think of it this way:

If you rotate the cube and get a different angle, then it is a
different case:

For example:

The &quot;X&quot; OLL:  probability 1/216 (only 1 angle)
The &quot;H&quot; OLL:  probability 2/216 (two distinct angles)
Most OLLs:  probability 4/216 (four distinct angles)

This help?

PS.: Probabilities are just probabilities, they are not exactly the reality. I was doing some solves today and the F permutation occured 4 times on 20.That&#x27;s 1/5. The G case occured 4 times too. The J occured 2 times and also the R. Maybe I have to do 288 solves...

I am evolving past this method, but I thought I would share it.<br>
I keep finding bugs in the document, so I hope some people will<br>
not hesitate to send me things to correct. If anyone actually<br>
learns to solve blindfolded because of the site, let me know...<br>
that would be great.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m only about 90% sure (pretty sure) about this since I don&#x27;t have 
one of those cubes myself, but since no one else is answering:

The 25th anniversary cubes and generally any Rubik&#x27;s cube you find 
in your average store do not have screws under the center caps.  
Instead, it has these annoying rivets that cannot be adjusted 
(except possibly to push them in further) to hold the centers in 
place.  If you want to be able to adjust screw tension, the way to 
go is the DIY cube from the rubiks.com.  You could also search 
around for a Rubik&#x27;s Studio cube which also has screws, but those 
are harder to come by.

Hope this helps,
Scott

p.s.  If I&#x27;m wrong and they do have screws beneath the caps, someone 
correct me so I can feel quite dumb for not having purchased one.

yes, but the more you solve, the closer your actual will get to the
theoretical (the law of large numbers). you probably wont get the same
probability by doing 288, but you will be pretty close.

I made a site last night about my first method for solving
the 3x3x3 blindfolded...I like to think it&#x27;s something like

my method: Macky&#x27;s method :: layer by layer method : Fridrich method

That is, it&#x27;s a place to start...it is kind of tedious because
it is so simplified...not much mental gymnastics.

I am evolving past this method, but I thought I would share it.
I keep finding bugs in the document, so I hope some people will
not hesitate to send me things to correct. If anyone actually
learns to solve blindfolded because of the site, let me know...
that would be great.

Thanks to all blindfold cubers for their inspiration and methods:
Stefan Pochmann, who definitely gave me ideas for my method
Shotaro, Leyan, Tyson, Chris Hardwick: You are all awesome
Richard Carr and Stiff hands: pioneers


Blindfold cubing is great...now I just need to succeed in 
competition. ;-)

<br>
I&#x27;m still working on my 4x4x4 tutorial, it&#x27;s pretty long so far with<br>
lots of pictures and detailed explanations.<br>
<br>
Anyway I&#x27;m done with the centers page, my method for the edges, and<br>
now I&#x27;m working on a page with a detailed example solve of the 6 pair<br>
method.<br>
<br>
Again I wouldn&#x27;t use that approach except for in very rare special<br>
cases for my method, but I&#x27;ve done a lot of practicing with it, so I<br>
want to include it to be fair to those who like it, especially since<br>
it can be VERY fast.<br>
<br>
So anyway I think I can finish either tomorrow (well Friday lol) or<br>
Saturday.  I&#x27;ll post the link once I&#x27;m finished with everything.<br>
<br>
So if you&#x27;re looking for a really detailed explanation of a 4x4x4<br>
speed solve method you don&#x27;t have to wait long!<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S.  This entire page is only on how to transform your scrambled 4x4<br>
into a scrambled 3x3 (with the potential for parities still).  So your<br>
4x4 times will still very much depend on your 3x3x3 times, but as I<br>
say on the page you might as well use a nice method for the<br>
transforming part to help your times.  Anyway it&#x27;ll be up soon!<br>

customizable sticker sheets that you can print your own photos onto<br>

drag and drop, right click and paste, Insert -&gt; Picture from the file<br>
menu at the top of MS Word and the photos wont drop into a grid of 9<br>
squares. The photos always go to the top left corner of the document<br>
and they wont allow you to drag and drop it anywhere else in the<br>
document. Has anyone else figured this out?<br>

More intuitive? Yes.

Easier to learn? ...that depends on the person. Fridrich was way
easier for me to understand when I first started.

I am reasonably certain that no New Zealander has even competed in any
WCA recognised competitions (WCA = World Cubing Association). I&#x27;m
Australian and as far as I can tell I&#x27;m the only Australian who&#x27;s
competed in any WCA recognised competitions!

I&#x27;m sure there are people in New Zealand who solve, but I&#x27;ve never
meet any at any cube events and I haven&#x27;t met any cubers online from
New Zealand. This Yahoo forum is where most cubers around the world
congregate so it&#x27;s certainly a good group to contact!

          <div class="email-content">Joël,

When I got my first 4x4x4 back around 1983 I almost solved it with
just the 3x3x3 algorithms and some basic logic. I got stuck with the
edge piece parity problem and how to permute center pieces. Since the
parity problem comes around only 50 percent of the time I would just
shuffle the edges up a bit and permute them again until the parity
problem didn&#x27;t appear. A book helped me with permuting center pieces.
I now have a 15 move algorithm that permutes two edge pieces and
solves the parity problem.

If you can solve the 3x3x3 I&#x27;m sure you are close. How close can you
get to solving the 4x4x4 now?

Yes, I taught one of my daughters when she was 9 (or possibly 8), 
because she asked me to. The cube was tough for her, trying on her 
own, and she had got discouraged, even though she had already solved 
the pyraminx partly by herself.  

The cross was no problem for her, but placing 3 corners with the 
correct orientations was difficult for her to grasp.  The first 3 
middle layer edges were no problem.  &quot;Picking up the last edge with 
the last corner&quot; was harder again.

I encouraged her to practice F2L a lot before we went on to LL.  
She &quot;got&quot; the commutator principle surprisingly quickly.  All of her 
LL methods are based on commutators.  And no conjugates, I think.

The whole process took several weeks, with a session every few days 
when she asked for one: we took it slowly, so she would understand 
what she was doing and perhaps tackle other puzzles on her own.  
However, the only other puzzle she tries regularly is Square-1 -- 
just solving the shapes and getting edges into their correct layers 
so far (i.e., the intuitive steps).

It would be interesting to know, but I don&#x27;t think you could get 
reliable stats on that, short of going out on the street and asking 
several thousand strangers if they can solve the cube.  (If someone 
can solve the cube reliably, the chances are that they can do it in 
under 5 minutes, wouldn&#x27;t you think?)

And you have to really /want/ to do it. ;) Of course, if more people 
around you are doing it, this will help generate the necessary 
interest: at university in the early 80s quite a lot of people I knew 
(male and female) could solve the Cube in a few minutes.  But 
students of maths, science and engineering are not a typical subset 
of the population. :D

over that,  running it through the printer again.  Like I said,  I 
don&#x27;t know what the sticker sheets look like,  or if they&#x27;re too thick 
for your printer to feed them with another sheet of paper.  My printer

it could when it was in the middle.

I don&#x27;t have time right now to read it completely, but there&#x27;s one 
comment I&#x27;d like to give already. You say:

&quot;This system, because it uses 2-cycles, will not allow you to break 
the world record for solving blindfolded.&quot;

That is wrong.

I&#x27;m using 2-cycles as well and I&#x27;ve solved the cube (just not 
blindfolded) under 1 minute this way. With more practice and some more 
algorithms I&#x27;m sure I can average 1 minute. The unofficial world 
record might be harder to beat, but the official one stands at over 2 
minutes so with fast memorization it&#x27;s definitely possible to beat it.

Cheers!
Stefan

My brother and I learned when I was 12 and he was 9.  We had a page of 
hints from our older cousin as our only guide.  I mastered it in about 
a week.  He had it about a week later.  We were on long road trip 
(vacation) at the time, so we had plenty of time to practice!

He was pretty fast, too, as I recall.  About 3-4 minutes-- not bad for 
a 9-year old!

Does she *want* to learn it? If not, you&#x27;re lost anyway ;-). But if 
yes, why don&#x27;t you let her find out things herself first. It&#x27;s not 
like she only has a few days left in life, is it?

Maybe with some guidance like &quot;solve the white face&quot;, then when she 
can safely do that, &quot;solve the first layer&quot;. Or just tell her &quot;solve 
as much as you can&quot; and see where that leads her and go on from there. 
Maybe she&#x27;d go a corners first way. I could imagine she&#x27;ll learn 
faster when she thinks on her own rather than trying to remember what 
you tell her.

Cheers!

Thierry told us his average was 19s (more precisely 18.95s), not 15s.
His method looks like this:
- A face minus an edge.
- Corners.
- Edges.

            I am J.bernett orlando.I AM 9 NOW. I learnt 3*3*3 when I was 7 from my dad. He knows only LBL method even today. He is happy with his under 2 min solves. 
           Mr.Stefan Pochmann then tutored me for blindfold. He  really made me to think rather than just tutoring. Thanks to him. Then I learnt F2L  I understood the theory behind these algm on my own. Now I know all 57 OLL and 21 PLL. by heart but can not explain the theory of these algms. 
           I learnt 4*4*4 from chris hardwick page. I learnt  5*5*5 and megaminx myself. I am not sure what those methods are called. I have to improve my solving 5*5*5 and megaminx.
           I am still learning fingering from Bob Burtons video. Mr.Ron Van Bruchem, Mr. Tyson Mao are really encouraging me to come back fair and genuine after the biggest mistake I made 2 months ago. Thanks to both of them.
I have successfully tutored few of my relatives and friends(not less than 10 and all are below 13). I successfully taught my elder sister 3*3*3 blindfolded. She is doing correctly!!

If he does then I&#x27;ll submit my record for solving 3x3 with thumb and 
middle finger of the right hand, ring finger of the left hand, middle 
three toes of right foot, and only looking with left eye and most 
importantly between 4:27am and 4:48am.

I own this book and if you want I´ll send it by mail.
As my french is probably not good enough to understand it,
I won´t miss it _that_ badly ;)
You may give it back in Orlando or next GCD.

Just send an email with your adress.

Mr.Ron Van Bruchem, Mr. Tyson Mao are really encouraging me to come 
back fair and genuine after the biggest mistake I made 2 months ago. 
Thanks to both of them.

<br>
The page is finally done.  It&#x27;s huge, so don&#x27;t expect to get through<br>
it quickly.<br>
<br>
I still need to add some more organization, break up the longer pages,<br>
and things like that, but all the content is already there.<br>
<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4speedsolve.html<br>
<br>
I did include a walk-through solve using the 6-pair method, but please<br>
keep in mind that in no way am I an expert in using the 6 pair method.<br>
 So if you really want to learn that method well, then ask around.  I<br>
did try to put in the tricks that I know for it though, which really<br>
isn&#x27;t much.<br>
<br>
The 2 pair method is extremely detailed with all the special case<br>
situations that I would recognize, so feel free to check that out too.<br>
<br>
Many thanks to Clancy, and Richard Patterson for helping me proofread<br>
and getting feedback on layout.<br>
<br>
Also the most thanks goes to Jon Morris for the great 4x4 template! <br>
The graphics look really nice, so Jon thanks a bunch!<br>
<br>
Let me know what you all think.  Keep in mind, although the content is<br>
all there, it&#x27;s still a work in progress.  I just couldn&#x27;t wait any<br>
longer to post it :-D<br>

I wrote this guide as an e-mail to Dave Campbell a few weeks ago.  I
don&#x27;t remember the details and I don&#x27;t feel like re-reading them, so
some of this stuff may not apply, but I believe it will give you
enough information to do what you need:

This explains how to (re)place a string.
 
1)  Identify the location of where the string belongs.  This part is
simple.  Look for the two gaps in which there are only two strings
instead of four.  It&#x27;s quite easy to notice.  The gaps will be
diagonal from each other.  The three tiles that &quot;touch&quot; those gaps are
the ones that the missing string belongs on.  If any of the gaps are 
above/below tiles instead of next to the tiles (ie - not all in the
same row of tiles), then fold the magic, shift the magic so that the
gaps will be in the same row, and then open it again.
 
2)  Find the location of the missing metal bit.  There are two main
options:
    a)  place it so that there are 2 metal bits on every other tile; or:
    b)  place it so that there is 1 metal bit on every tile.
Choose which pattern you wish to follow (or follow the existing
pattern).  This will determine where you will &quot;start&quot; in the string.
 
3)  Place the string around the first corner (it will be diagonal and
to the outside of either of the gaps that has fewer strings.  Make
sure you have an idea of where the metal bit will go when you put the
string around the first corner.  You will want to put the string
behind the corner, not in front, so this will determine how you hold
the puzzle.  You have to follow the over-and-under pattern already
existing on the puzzle.
 
4)  String the puzzle.  Follow the over-under pattern along the three
tiles, wrap it around, and bring it back the other way.  Make sure you
place the strings properly into the gaps.  You will want to achieve a
&quot;sandwich&quot; of strings.  This means that you will have one string going
in a direction, two strings above it going in the perpendicular
direction, and then a fourth string at the top going in the original
direction.
 
5)  Place the last loop of the string.  This part is the most
difficult, but becomes easy with practice.  When you place the last
loop of the string, you want to make sure you do this on an inside
corner, so that there is an even distribution of tension.  Try to flex
the tiles to make this easier.  You may want to use something to bring
the string over the last corner.  I used to use a pencap, but I have
also used a pen/pencil for this (though this may put a nick in the
string, I suspect).  I believe Stefan Pochmann uses gift twine.  Now,
I just use my fingers.  It will seem like it will not go, but if you
force it (not too hard!) it will go over the corner.

seen lately on bigger cubes. i&#x27;d like to thank frank<br>
morris for his massive contribution with videos and<br>
methodology, this site wouldn&#x27;t be as good or nearly<br>
as accurate without his help. also chris hardwick for<br>
help with the 4x4 ideas and some proofreading. and<br>
last but not least lars petrus who&#x27;s extremely badass<br>
applet filled 3x3 page inspired me to try and reach<br>
the same great level with page, and getting me to<br>
start speedsolving. many edits will be made i&#x27;m sure<br>
there&#x27;s lots of spelling and other things, and i&#x27;m<br>
adding specific points of acheivement and other things<br>

          <div class="email-content">Cube Demo Updated For 20x20x20 Cube Support<br>
<br>
Greetings,<br>
<br>
I can&#x27;t believe how many requests we&#x27;ve received about the desire <br>
for larger cubes!  Of course, I should have known better after I saw <br>
that someone in Japan had solved the 9x9x9 in a little over 2 hours <br>
and posted the screenshots on his site.  So, as of this release, we <br>
now support cube sizes up to 20x20x20.  I would certainly expect <br>
that performance will noticably degrade on slower/older systems when <br>
you get up to 15x15x15 and above but you are free to give `em a <br>
try.  Ton from Speedcubing.com made the request for changing the <br>
timer behavior to wait until the first move is made after a scramble <br>
to start  seemed to be a good idea to me so that has been added as <br>
well.  We&#x27;ve also received enough comments about the moving <br>
background making people dizzy to change it and make it static  we <br>
hope you like it better!  You can get the latest version from our <br>
downloads page: http://www.gabbasoft.com/download.htm<br>
<br>
As always, thanks so much for all of your input and we hope you will <br>
continue to send us your thoughts and ideas for making our product <br>
better.<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey James,

Thanks for pointing that out I totally missed that when I was writing.
 I just fixed it so the link works now.  I&#x27;ll check the rest of the
page again tomorrow for structural errors.  I spent some time tonight
going over the solves and correcting typos and weird parts.  Gotta
still proofread the 6 pair page some more though.

Thanks for the help though, I want this page to be nice so I need to
fix any bugs in it :-D

Next time choose something that &quot;makes sense&quot; and is less arbitrary, 
so that others actually have an incentive to do the same.

Stefan

P.S. Maybe also bragging with superhigh IQs doesn&#x27;t necessarily help 
make friends, either.

Hi Olli,

thanks, but my French isn&#x27;t the best, either ;-)

I just came across it and was wondering because 15 seconds would&#x27;ve 
been quite fast in 1981 and the only guy I had heard about getting 
that was Mark Waterman.

So, thanks to Gilles for telling a bit about it and thanks to someone 
else who sent me some scanned pages. No need to send the book to me, 
but thanks for the offer :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

I think that one would actually get on speedcubing.com if you can 
convince Ron that it&#x27;s real ;-). He&#x27;d probably create a general 
category like &quot;amazing bld stuff&quot; again, though. When I&#x27;m fast enough 
I&#x27;m gonna try blindfolded under water and submit it...

no idea that you had to turn it 45 degrees to put it back.  I think 
he ended up with a cube without one corner piece, at which point he 
gave up and returned it to the toy store.  In that short time, 
however, the store had switched from the cylinder cubes to the boxed 
ones, so I never got the cylinder cube back. :(

Cubing while driving a stick isn&#x27;t that hard, especially if you one 
hand. (I also drive a stick; it&#x27;s cooler)

It makes drives across states much more enjoyable, and is a great way 
to cement algs.

          <div class="email-content">I taught my younger brother (turned ten a few days ago) to solve the 
first two layers a couple of weeks ago, before I left the country.  
Depending on whether people have an easier time seeing corners or 
edges, I teach them a corners first approach or a layer one.  He, like 
most, sees edges fairly easily, so that&#x27;s the way we went.

For most beginners, I try to remember the things that helped me when I 
was teaching myself, thinking back to the days of elation after ten or 
more minute solves.

A good &#x27;trick&#x27; is to get the pieces directly below where they need to 
end up.  Then there are two simple cases: F2; or adjust D, RF&#x27;R or 
L&#x27;FL.  Same for corners.  Directly under where they should be, 
matching up the sticker colors to the center in front.  (cross on 
white on top) &#x27;If white is on the right, hold the white sticker on the 
right side; then, R&#x27;D&#x27;R.&#x27;  If it&#x27;s on the left, hold the white sticker 
on the left, then show them LDL&#x27;.

The one that gives people the most trouble, in my experience, is the 
case where the white sticker is facing down.  The most successful way 
to tackle this is to show them to solve it like either case, but make 
a D2 turn instead, to &#x27;make it usable.&#x27;

>From there, I think using the algs FU2RUR&#x27;U2F&#x27; and FU2RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2F&#x27; are 
very easy to understand, because the target spot is always in the same 
place, and the algs differ only in the direction of a single turn.

If they do well with this, working corners are next, using a similar 
approach to the corner pieces.

For the LL, they always seem to do the best with a sheet of paper with 
the steps described clearly and with pictures.  Some people get 
OeLL+PCLL+OCLL+PELL very easily, which can be very fast.  Others have 
trouble recognizing the corner permutation cases, so I have them do 
OELL+OCLL+PCLL+PELL.  This will probably be more conducive later to 
upgrading to full PLL, but I think is harder to learn at the outset.

That&#x27;s all the advice I have at the moment, and I may write more if I 
have time later.

second cube I ever owned.<br>
<br>
As you may have noticed, the faces of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube TURN.  <br>
Therefore, said my flawless 8-year-old boyhood logic, I can stand on <br>
the cube, on one leg, and spin around like a ballarina.  So I tried it <br>
and managed to spin about 1/8 turn.  I tried it again and got up to a <br>
quarter turn.  Then I really cranked it up and spun (span?) as hard and <br>
fast as I could.<br>
<br>
CRRUNCH<br>
<br>
Suddenly I was on the ground, with my cube in about a dozen pieces.  <br>
One of the centers had completely come off, screw and all.  I told my <br>
stepdad, &quot;Uhh my cube broke again&quot; and he replied, &quot;I&#x27;m going to <br>
exchange this one more time.  If you break it again, you will not get <br>
another one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Needless to say, that third cube was not used as a Stand-n-Spin.  It <br>
lasted a LONG time.<br>

Not really, but that would be funny.  Even though dim light doesn&#x27;t 
matter with a blindfold.  And it&#x27;s hard to do a bld solve right after 
waking up.

A lot of these categories also don&#x27;t exist anymore.

          <div class="email-content">Huh? Doug, I haven&#x27;t solved a F2L on top in 1.5 year... you might want 
to ask me though, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll want be able to answer... I know 
Per does LL on bottom (yeah he is crazy, but eh, he is Norvegian... 
:-p), but I think (only my guess but I have actually never seen anyone 
doing elseways, besides Per) most people will just turn the cube upside 
down after the F2L is done so they get the LL on top.
And for the record, cross on the left rocks.

PS. if someone answered that mail already, just forget about me, but 
I&#x27;ve been away for a few days so I missed a lot. I&#x27;m trying to catch up 
on the recent topics...

...and perhaps the first ever average of 100:  54.90 seconds. ;)<br>
<br>
Here is a 36.98 second solve we got on video:<br>
http://www.cubewhiz.com/videos/burtonwinokurteambld3698.wmv<br>
<br>
The file is just unde 4 MB.<br>
<br>
Our best single was a 33.98, though we did get a 29.80 PLL skip early<br>
on. :)<br>
<br>
I believe we are both shocked at our average being 14 seconds faster<br>
than last week. :D<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey! That team solve video looks very nice! Interesting... 

Maybe it&#x27;s an idea to standardize the &#x27;codes&#x27; for all the cases, so 
all speedcubers that are interested in learning them can practice 
this with each other... I&#x27;d like to try it once.

- Joël.

          <div class="email-content">nice man. love that.

same thing yesterday, in my neighborhood we had a
summer jubilee. so i did some public cubing in front
of soo many ppl i lost count.

Then went to starbucks and did more cubing, suddenly
this lady walks up and asked me how i do it soo fast
and i explained myself. I gave her the website of
speedcubing and she left :)


PS: to all ppl, do more public cubing. raise
awareness.

          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Mon, 29 Aug 2005 02:05:48 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">Some weeks ago I posted a very excited email detailing something <br>
like a plan for a method involving C(O)LL and (E)PLL.  After much <br>
experimenting, a lot of number crunching, and more struggling than I <br>
care to put into words, I&#x27;ve decided against this for several <br>
reasons.<br>
<br>
Some people thought it would be too complicated, or that the <br>
benefits wouldn&#x27;t be enough.  To the former, I still think <br>
otherwise, especially after certain people named Chris successfully <br>
used large chunks of ZB in Dallas.  To the latter, I think this now <br>
to be true.<br>
<br>
Instead, I now think cases 1 and 2 of ZBF2L, along with COLL and <br>
EPLL will be a much better full time strategy entailing better <br>
rewards and fewer algs and decisions.<br>
<br>
However, I would like to go farther than that.  Inspired both by <br>
Chris&#x27; recent performance, and by Bob&#x27;s decision to persue ZB as a <br>
method, and after playing with ZBF2L a bit for my COLL, I think a <br>
modified COLL+some specialized ZB approach would be either a decent <br>
method in its own right, or at least a useful stepping stone to full <br>
ZB.<br>
<br>
For ZBF2L, I would pretty much learn it as is, or with a few added <br>
special cases for some corner orienting.  Then, COLL+EPLL.  I would <br>
also take advantage of OLL skips due to ZBF2L by employing PLL when <br>
applicable.  The stats for this seem to me something like the <br>
following:<br>
<br>
Chance to skip<br>
EPLL step:   1/12<br>
OLL step:    1/8<br>
LL entirely: 1/1944<br>
Any other things I&#x27;m missing at the moment, which there seem to be, <br>
that I can&#x27;t quite remember, and the less frequent COLL solves due <br>
to OLL skips leave us with the grand total at about a 20% chance of <br>
a skipped step during a solve.  This is similar to <br>
Vandenbergh/Harris, I believe.<br>
<br>
Now, adding in the ZB cases only for correctly permuted corners, we <br>
get <br>
better odds for when we still do COLL.  The odds to skip the PLL <br>
after COLL are 1/12.  The odds for cases with correct corner <br>
permutation are something like 18% of COLL cases, meaning we have <br>
odds of 1/12 for 82% of cases, and odds of 100% for 18% of COLL <br>
cases.  The total odds for PLL skip after our COLL would then be <br>
something like 25% or 1/4.  Factoring in the reduced occasion for <br>
COLL because of OLL skips the stats begin to look more like...<br>
<br>
Chance to skip<br>
Step during COLL:  1/5<br>
OLL step:          1/8<br>
other special cases: x<br>
Total:             ~32.5+% or a little over 3/10<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sure there are ways to add in special cases and tricks to <br>
further this, but even without any a 1/3 chance for a one step LL is <br>
very powerful, especially in comparison with standard OLL+PLL, with <br>
a chance to skip a step at about 1/8 with early edge orienting and <br>
almost neglibible without.<br>
<br>
The reason I&#x27;m considering cases with corners correctly permuted as <br>
opposed to learning specific orientation cases fully is that they&#x27;re <br>
generally easier to recognize than other cases as a whole, and can <br>
often be completed by using Sune/Antisunes from different angles, <br>
making them fast, and easy to execute.  Also, when I do get one of <br>
those cases, it feels almost lazy to just do a simple Sune/Antisune <br>
instead of a longer COLL alg.<br>
<br>
Of course, this leaves us with lots of cases to learn (158 for ZBF2L <br>
and about 75 new cases for ZBLL, assuming you already know COLL, <br>
putting us at around 380 new cases total with reflections), but I <br>
still think that&#x27;s a managable number, considering simple <br>
reflections, the massive benefits, and the staggering abilities <br>
demonstrated by people who already know and use hundreds of <br>
algorithms.<br>
<br>
Since I&#x27;m writing this at 3:44 in the morning local time after a <br>
long day, I&#x27;m not entirely certain I&#x27;ve explained myself well, so <br>
feel free to comment/criticize as necessary.  Any thoughts are much <br>
appreciated, especially from those of you using similar approaches.<br>

Cube Demo Updated For 20x20x20 Cube Support

Greetings,

I can&#x27;t believe how many requests we&#x27;ve received about the desire 
for larger cubes!  Of course, I should have known better after I saw 
that someone in Japan had solved the 9x9x9 in a little over 2 hours 
and posted the screenshots on his site.  So, as of this release, we 
now support cube sizes up to 20x20x20.  I would certainly expect 
that performance will noticably degrade on slower/older systems when 
you get up to 15x15x15 and above but you are free to give `em a 
try.  Ton from Speedcubing.com made the request for changing the 
timer behavior to wait until the first move is made after a scramble 
to start  seemed to be a good idea to me so that has been added as 
well.  We&#x27;ve also received enough comments about the moving 
background making people dizzy to change it and make it static  we 
hope you like it better!  You can get the latest version from our 
downloads page: http://www.gabbasoft.com/download.htm

As always, thanks so much for all of your input and we hope you will 
continue to send us your thoughts and ideas for making our product 
better.

          <div class="email-content">Hi !

Yes i agree that demanding DirectX 9.0b or whatever it was is a bit 
over the top. But that&#x27;s typical. Those developers of coz have the 
latest software and hardware. A game like this would work perfectly 
with DirectX 6 or 7. And would then be compatible with windows98 as 
well as windows95 even. And older hardware. That said it&#x27;s probably 
a minority who don&#x27;t have at least windows 2000 professional today.

The problem with DirectX 9.0b on old computers is not that it&#x27;s 
impossible to install that DirectX version on the OS. The problem is 
that the graphics cards on old computers won&#x27;t support it, more 
specifially won&#x27;t support the instruction set (API) of the Direct X 
version. Actually installing DirectX 9 on systems with non-
compatible graphics cards probably means that the OS needs to be 
reinstalled as there is no (easy) to uninstall it. This happened to 
me some yrs ago. The marvellous installtion CD coming with the 
screencard kindly installed DirectX 9 even my specific card didn&#x27;t 
support it. Had i  only installed it the manual way it would have 
been fine ... grrrr ...

Cheers!

<br>
Yesterday my Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2 fell apart and although I managed to reconstruct<br>
it, I cannot turn one of the directions. I assume this has to do with the<br>
different kind of quarter circular things that are in there. I just put them<br>
in arbitrarily, which was probably the wrong way to go. Can anyone tell me<br>
how I should have put them in?<br>
<br>
I hope somebody can help me.<br>

In the Photos section of this group, there is an album called &quot;Fix 
your 2x2x2&quot; where someone posted photos of the reassembly of a 
Rubik&#x27;s 2x2x2 with instructions.  And you&#x27;re right that you have to

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan!

Wow! What a hardcore scrambler ;-) No user options at all ... hehe ...
Well that&#x27;s what u wanted so im not gonna suggest u add options for 
scramble length and stuff like that :D

But i have an idea anyway. I know u have just dumped the numbers from 
the main control loop, hence first scramble is number zero (0). How 
about letting it start from 1 and go up to 50? It&#x27;s just that little 
bit more natural for ordinary deadly humans ... lol ...

Cheers!

I do sub-18 averages everyday. I think I can do sub-20 avg again in

Maybe Lars Petrus or David Wesley shows up and beats both of u? ;-)

A pop or 2 is also enough to ruin an average :-(

Here are the first few codes.  The F2L slot to be filled is always
placed in the FR spot.

A1 - edge is correctly placed, corner is in the top layer with white
facing right
A2 - same but white faces front
A3 - same but white faces up

C1 - edge is placed backwards, corner in the top layer with white
facing right
C2 - same but white faces front
C3 - same but white faces up

In message 18337 I wrote up a detailed explanation of a team solve
that Chris and I caught on tape.  One of the codes is C3.  Check it out!

I was quietly cubing in a cafe late the other night and a woman with a 
rather loud voice informed me that 
(1) she loved Rubik&#x27;s cubes (a good start, I thought) 
(2) she had never actually owned a cube 
(3) she could solve it in 5 seconds.  

It&#x27;s no use arguing... I just told her that that was a pretty good time.
There ought to be a special UWR page for these folk. ;)

My goal is to brake Wesleys swedish records (17,37/20,96). It will

Starting with 1 is a terribly flawed habit. I&#x27;d like the first digit 
of every block of 10 scrambles to be the same. Imagine it&#x27;d generate 
100 scrambles, then the last would be a 3-digit number if I started 
with 1. Ugly. Now I only wish I weren&#x27;t used to start with 1 in real 
life. My teachers/parents/generalEnvironment suck. Computer 
programmers should rule the world.

Maybe I should just remove the index column ;-)

Cheers!
Stefan

P.S. One thing for which I really want to start with 0 in real life is 
memorization. I&#x27;ve built a memo home with 100 points, i.e. 10 rooms 
with 10 points each. I&#x27;d like the index of the point tell me both the 
room and the point inside the room, which is nicer if I have 00-99 
than if it&#x27;s 01-100. Also, when memorizing digit sequences and 
memorizing two digits at a time, I get 00-99 anyway.

Which reminds me.

I was cubing on a nearly empty tram a few evenings ago, when an 
attractive young woman sat down near me and /also/ expressed her love 
of things Rubikal.  I grunted approvingly.

She then asked (a propos de rien) whether I would like to find Britney 
and Paris cuddled up in my front room.  &quot;What -- /my/ front room?&quot;  I 
asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; said she.  &quot;Can they do the Cube?&quot; I asked.

At this point she changed the subject again...

Even though its not complete yet, maybe my page can help?
http://www.geocities.com/pjgat09/misc2a.html
After you finish the steps on my page, find the UBR corner, and put 
the heart shaped piece into it facing the other square center, then 
put another rounded edge piece into the other side of it, then slide 
it into its correct place. Then take the UBL corner, and put a 
rounded edge piece into in, and slide it into place. Next, take the 
UFL corner, put the remaining squared edge piece into facing the 
other one and slide it on. Now heres the hard part: Take your 
selected corner, and slide it over the 2 squared edge pieces. Notw 
push and pull it over the heart shaped edge until it &quot;pops&quot; into 
place. You cube should now work fine!!

Good luck! Tell me how it goes.

You suggest that the first few moves can be called out during the

          <div class="email-content">I think you&#x27;re correct about that.  Let&#x27;s update the stats, then.

Instead of 20% odds for the scenario with regular COLL, ZBF2L, and 
PLL when applicable, it&#x27;s now more like 12%.

And, instead of 33% odds for with the correct corners ZBLL cases, 
it&#x27;s now more like 27.78%.  Not great, but still much better.  More 
than twice as good, in fact.  It still means the odds for a 1 look 
LL are something greater than 1 out of 4, and when you don&#x27;t skip, 
you&#x27;ve still only got an edge PLL case for the second one.

So, pending further experimentation, this is now my new plan.

I suppose I should finish learning the last few COLL&#x27;s first...

More feedback, please.

When you solve the cube yourself, you know the first couple of moves
in advance before you begin. It makes sense to me to allow that in a
team blindfold solve as well. It will probably only help your times by
a second or two...if at all.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Mike, my comments below:<br>
<br>
&gt; Some weeks ago I posted a very excited email detailing something <br>
&gt; like a plan for a method involving C(O)LL and (E)PLL.  After much <br>
&gt; experimenting, a lot of number crunching, and more struggling than <br>
I <br>
&gt; care to put into words, I&#x27;ve decided against this for several <br>
&gt; reasons.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Some people thought it would be too complicated, or that the <br>
&gt; benefits wouldn&#x27;t be enough.  To the former, I still think <br>
&gt; otherwise, especially after certain people named Chris <br>
successfully <br>
&gt; used large chunks of ZB in Dallas.  To the latter, I think this <br>
now <br>
&gt; to be true.<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t done much experimenting with strictly COLL/(E)PLL, but it <br>
sounds like you put a lot of work into this and I trust your <br>
judgement.  I had thought for a while that maybe the 1/12 chance for <br>
a PLL skip or the 1/27 chance for an OLL skip might add up to <br>
overcome the slower COLL, but if you don&#x27;t think that does then I <br>
think that is good to know.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Instead, I now think cases 1 and 2 of ZBF2L, along with COLL and <br>
&gt; EPLL will be a much better full time strategy entailing better <br>
&gt; rewards and fewer algs and decisions.<br>
<br>
Why not also add the ZBF2L with all LL edges either correctly <br>
oriented or all incorrectly oriented?  Those are all, for the most <br>
part, some of the fastest ZBF2L algs.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; However, I would like to go farther than that.  Inspired both by <br>
&gt; Chris&#x27; recent performance, and by Bob&#x27;s decision to persue ZB as a <br>
&gt; method, and after playing with ZBF2L a bit for my COLL, I think a <br>
&gt; modified COLL+some specialized ZB approach would be either a <br>
decent <br>
&gt; method in its own right, or at least a useful stepping stone to <br>
full <br>
&gt; ZB.<br>
<br>
So far I think my LL skip count is up to 23.xx% maybe 24.xx% and I <br>
like this type of method so far.  I have thought that maybe only <br>
know the &quot;T&quot; orientation, and the other orientation where two <br>
adjacent corners are twisted, but the other direction as the &quot;T&quot; <br>
(&quot;H&quot; orientation on Dan Harris&#x27; page) would be a good method just by <br>
itself.  Those two OLL cases are some of the easiest to recognize, <br>
since two corners are twisted correctly and can be used as <br>
a &quot;base&quot;.  Also knowing those two cases and all COLL would give you <br>
a 1/27 + 8/27 + (18/27)*(1/12) = 38.89% chance of a 1 look LL.<br>
<br>
I think those two are the easiest ZBLL cases for recognition, and <br>
knowing just those two and COLL gives you a nearly 40% chance of a 1 <br>
look LL, which would be realyl powerful!  In fact, after I finish <br>
with the &quot;T&quot; orientation I&#x27;m going to start learning the &quot;H&quot; <br>
orientation next for just the reason of using the two together for <br>
that nearly 40% chance of a 1 look.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; For ZBF2L, I would pretty much learn it as is, or with a few added <br>
&gt; special cases for some corner orienting.  Then, COLL+EPLL.  I <br>
would <br>
&gt; also take advantage of OLL skips due to ZBF2L by employing PLL <br>
when <br>
&gt; applicable.  The stats for this seem to me something like the <br>
&gt; following:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Chance to skip<br>
&gt; EPLL step:   1/12<br>
&gt; OLL step:    1/8<br>
&gt; LL entirely: 1/1944<br>
&gt; Any other things I&#x27;m missing at the moment, which there seem to <br>
be, <br>
&gt; that I can&#x27;t quite remember, and the less frequent COLL solves due <br>
&gt; to OLL skips leave us with the grand total at about a 20% chance <br>
of <br>
&gt; a skipped step during a solve.  This is similar to <br>
&gt; Vandenbergh/Harris, I believe.<br>
<br>
After trying ZB some in Dallas I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that ZB2L <br>
is totally reasonable for competitive solving.  Each fo the 23 F2L <br>
cases is broken down into 8 sub-cases, with lots of cool <br>
simplifications for symmetry.  So your recognition has two phases, <br>
F2L case (by looking ahead you know this before finishing the 3rd <br>
F2L pair) and LL edges case.  You can recognize the LL edges case by <br>
looking at only the LL edges currently in the LL after solving the <br>
3rd F2L pair, so even this is possible by looking ahead leaving no <br>
transition from 3rd to 4th pair.<br>
<br>
So I think your idea to learn ZBF2L is totally reasonable, even for <br>
competitions.  It will take a lot of practice obviously, but I don&#x27;t <br>
think it is too much to recall under pressure given enough practice.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Now, adding in the ZB cases only for correctly permuted corners, <br>
we <br>
&gt; get <br>
&gt; better odds for when we still do COLL.  The odds to skip the PLL <br>
&gt; after COLL are 1/12.  The odds for cases with correct corner <br>
&gt; permutation are something like 18% of COLL cases, meaning we have <br>
&gt; odds of 1/12 for 82% of cases, and odds of 100% for 18% of COLL <br>
&gt; cases.  The total odds for PLL skip after our COLL would then be <br>
&gt; something like 25% or 1/4.  Factoring in the reduced occasion for <br>
&gt; COLL because of OLL skips the stats begin to look more like...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Chance to skip<br>
&gt; Step during COLL:  1/5<br>
&gt; OLL step:          1/8<br>
&gt; other special cases: x<br>
&gt; Total:             ~32.5+% or a little over 3/10<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#x27;m sure there are ways to add in special cases and tricks to <br>
&gt; further this, but even without any a 1/3 chance for a one step LL <br>
is <br>
&gt; very powerful, especially in comparison with standard OLL+PLL, <br>
with <br>
&gt; a chance to skip a step at about 1/8 with early edge orienting and <br>
&gt; almost neglibible without.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The reason I&#x27;m considering cases with corners correctly permuted <br>
as <br>
&gt; opposed to learning specific orientation cases fully is that <br>
they&#x27;re <br>
&gt; generally easier to recognize than other cases as a whole, and can <br>
&gt; often be completed by using Sune/Antisunes from different angles, <br>
&gt; making them fast, and easy to execute.  Also, when I do get one of <br>
&gt; those cases, it feels almost lazy to just do a simple <br>
Sune/Antisune <br>
&gt; instead of a longer COLL alg.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure whether or not I agree on the recognition for the <br>
corners correctly permuted ZBLL cases.  I&#x27;ve found that the first <br>
thing my brain has to settle on for ZBLL recognition is always the <br>
COLL case.  There are many examples of cases that look exactly the <br>
same for edges, but the COLL case is different.  So for the reason <br>
of avoiding mis-reading the case I prefer to always look for the <br>
COLL case first.<br>
<br>
Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be bad, but personally I think it would be hard, <br>
since my brain always seems to settle on seeing the COLL case first, <br>
but it could also be that I&#x27;ve trained that way from the start.<br>
 <br>
&gt; Of course, this leaves us with lots of cases to learn (158 for <br>
ZBF2L <br>
&gt; and about 75 new cases for ZBLL, assuming you already know COLL, <br>
&gt; putting us at around 380 new cases total with reflections), but I <br>
&gt; still think that&#x27;s a managable number, considering simple <br>
&gt; reflections, the massive benefits, and the staggering abilities <br>
&gt; demonstrated by people who already know and use hundreds of <br>
&gt; algorithms.<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
I also agree to that being a manageable number.  I think knowing 2-3 <br>
full OLL cases should be manageable for most people.  I think that <br>
ZB is just a mental barrier right now.  Once more people start to <br>
learn the algs I think that barrier will break down and people won&#x27;t <br>
be afraid to learn so many algs.  Right now it seems like a lot <br>
because most people only use around 100 or so algs (23+57+21=101 for <br>
Fridrich F2L + OLL + PLL).<br>
<br>
Most people wouldn&#x27;t consider the 23 algs for F2L as &quot;algs&quot; per se <br>
but as intuition.  That is my exact same feeling about a LOT of <br>
ZBF2L cases, so it&#x27;s not 158 algs per se, because lots of cases are <br>
reductions to a few common recurring short cases.<br>
<br>
&gt; Since I&#x27;m writing this at 3:44 in the morning local time after a <br>
&gt; long day, I&#x27;m not entirely certain I&#x27;ve explained myself well, so <br>
&gt; feel free to comment/criticize as necessary.  Any thoughts are <br>
much <br>
&gt; appreciated, especially from those of you using similar approaches.<br>
<br>
I tried to give my thoughts as best I could, and would also <br>
appreciate feedback, particularly about recognizing ZBLL differently <br>
from COLL then EPLL.  I think that would be hard, but I would love <br>
to be proved wrong!<br>

Why should that be cheating? Again, think of it as imitating a cuber 
without hands and blind cuber who participate as a pair, but following 
the normal rules as close as possible. Would be quite strange if they 
didn&#x27;t talk. For example, the commander should really tell the twister 
how to orient the cube at the start.

Sorry for the lack of clarity.  I meant to say that I felt cases 1 
and 2, along with COLL and EPLL will be faster than the method I 
previously suggested.

I&#x27;m currently only using chunks of cases 1 and 2, and most of the 
COLL algs, but intend to use full ZBF2L eventually.

Actually, I would really see the COLL case first, then the edges 
permutation.  That&#x27;s how it&#x27;s going so far, at least.  I know the 2 
Z perms for the two cases with adjacent corners flipped.  All you 
need to see is two adjacent edges to know the case.  It&#x27;s similar to 
recognizing the EPLL as a separate step.

It may be less efficient to do it this way, but I think it will work 
for me, given my currently atrocious LL times at present.  In fact, 
I think the longer recognition won&#x27;t be a problem at all, because 
even when I perform a 3 cycle to finish perfectly after COLL, it 
still takes over 1 second.  This doesn&#x27;t include any recognition.  I 
think I can be competitive this way, but it may be too much for 
other cubers.

Actually, I&#x27;ve never considered them algs, because I never learned 
them as such.  I taught myself an intuitive F2L after Chicago, and 
edge orienting is really just a simple extension.  Most of the ZB 
algs I know right now either involve pairing up, then 
inserting+flipping, or flipping, then pairing+inserting.  Since this 
is the same as an intuitive approach, just slightly more concrete, 
the going is easy.

The only cases giving me problems are the ones without clear 
pairing/flipping/inserting stages.  These really aren&#x27;t that bad, 
though, because they&#x27;re generally simple and short.

Like I said, it&#x27;s really not much different, except that you 
recognize the EPLL before you perform COLL.  It&#x27;s very simple for 
me, because I use the recognition method on Gilles&#x27; and Lars V&#x27;s 
sites.  The sticker method everyone else seems to use boggles my 
mind.  Again, it may be less efficient because it would be harder to 
see the EPLL ahead of time, as you could with COLL, but I think it 
will balance in the end due to the effectiveness of the 1 look LL.

Anywho, thanks for the feedback, and keep the ideas coming.

P.S.  I replied to this once, with a nicely planned out, long, 
fantastically well written email.  Then, I hit &#x27;Send&#x27; and waited.  
Yahoo decided to lose the post and give me an error message.  
Unfortunately, the friend I&#x27;m staying with has yet to switch to 
Firefox and IE doesn&#x27;t save the text changes I made.  That ruined my 
whole night.

          <div class="email-content">And, because I forgot to include it in the second go-round on the <br>
reply, here&#x27;s an extra bit of fun:<br>
<br>
When I recognize the edge perm case on the two ZB cases I know some <br>
of, I nearly always seem to hold the cube so I can see the UF and UL <br>
edges.  I often use the UR edge, instead, though, because sometimes <br>
I see that one first.  I think, I will have to pick one side and <br>
stick to it, though, because recognizing from two different angles <br>
all the time would make twice as many cases to see.<br>
<br>
If I can train myself to always look to the UL and UF edges after I <br>
AUF for the COLL case, I think it will help.  Since the cases I know <br>
now are rather symmetrical, it&#x27;s not a problem, but I think could be <br>
very harmful in the end if not taken care of.<br>
<br>
Again, it differs very little from standard COLL+EPLL, except in the <br>
timing of the recognition steps.  I think it will be very fast, once <br>
I get used to it, but for now it&#x27;s still somewhat slow.  Time will <br>
tell.<br>

I have used the method of recognition where I just look to see what
corners need to be swapped in the past (until February).  Now, I use
the sticker method for recognition of COLL.  I think it is easier,
personally.  It is better for me to not know what goes where and
instead  just recognize by some sort of pattern. :)

Hello Bram,
Even though its not complete yet, maybe my page can help?
http://www.geocities.com/pjgat09/misc2a.html
&lt;http://www.geocities.com/pjgat09/misc2a.html> 
After you finish the steps on my page, find the UBR corner, and put 
the heart shaped piece into it facing the other square center, then 
put another rounded edge piece into the other side of it, then slide 
it into its correct place. Then take the UBL corner, and put a 
rounded edge piece into in, and slide it into place. Next, take the 
UFL corner, put the remaining squared edge piece into facing the 
other one and slide it on. Now heres the hard part: Take your 
selected corner, and slide it over the 2 squared edge pieces. Notw 
push and pull it over the heart shaped edge until it &quot;pops&quot; into 
place. You cube should now work fine!!

Good luck! Tell me how it goes.
Peter Greenwood

It is difficult - I take it you&#x27;ve already put in a 6 (that part is 
easy). To give you more idea of the difficulty, I gave a friend who 
also does Sudoku another grid with the numbers 1,2,... on which 
order to fill the squares in! (That was a while ago and he still

I don&#x27;t know where you are in the puzzle, so I&#x27;ll tell you this - 
the second number to put in goes in the square below that I&#x27;ve 
labelled with &quot;@&quot;. The third one goes where the # is. 
(If you get really stuck, I can post a complete solution that 
explains how to get each step without trial and error.)

But what on earth are those levels u talk about. I never heard about

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,

I just got back from Hilversum, where I had to record that video. 
The cameraman and the director were very nice, so we had a good time 
shooting the video.

I got there about an hour early, so got to meet some people who were 
working at the studio. After having a nice cup of coffee and doing a 
little chatting with those guys, I showed them a few nice and fluent 
sub17 solves. They all liked it very much. (And someone mentiond: &quot;I 
used to peel of the stickers!!). After that they showed my around 
the studio, and told me a bit more about what the video should look 
like. It&#x27;s gonna be just a small 1-minute video. The company is 
called &#x27;Deloitte&#x27;, and I understand that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a worldwide company, 
with people working in like... every country in the world :). The 
video is going to be shown on a big meeting/congress with 
shareholders.

So, after doing a few warm up solves, we recorded some solves from 
different angle, while standing still, and a few while rotating 
around on a platform. We also did a lot of different other shots 
(close up on my eyes, showing off the solved cube, picking up the 
scrambled cube, putting down a solved cube etc.), it took about 1.5 
hours I think.

The director promised me they are gonna edit the whole thing until 
it looks perfect, so I expect it to look very cool.. They are gonna 
send me a DVD with the whole movie on it when they finish it, so 
I&#x27;ll try to upload it to my site.

They also gave me a brand new anniversery cube, because they didn&#x27;t 
need that one anymore.. And they promised a nice &#x27;payment&#x27;, which I 
am gonna need if I want to have fun in Florida.

AND... The director told me he could get me in touch with the 
marketing guys from Deloitte.. If they like the video, maybe they 
want to sponser me for the WC.. (Well, don&#x27;t really expect that to 
happen, but it&#x27;s worth a shot!).

So.. I&#x27;ll tell you guys when I got the video,

Cya!

Deloitte is indeed a huge international company, which means that sponsoring
remark could be serious after all.

What do you mean &quot;start incorporating it&quot;? Oh, and I assume you mean 
4x4 and 5x5, right? Well, the programs already spit out lower and 
upper case letters, so just interpret the lower case letters as double 
layer turns. No? But be warned, I tried that recently and it *slowed 
me down* because I got confused all the time. Try it.

Cheers!
Stefan

There&#x27;s still the issue of how many turns to use in the scramble.  I 
doubt that this would depend significantly (if at all) on 
the &quot;metric&quot;, but how were the original figures arrived at for the 
various puzzles?  Was it just a matter of:

(1) estimating the number of distinct sequences (not positions) of 
length d

(2) finding d such that the above number exceeds the number of 
possible configurations of the puzzle

(3) adding a few turns for safety.

If so, the the safety margin looks rather high for 2x2x2 and Square-1 
(the only ones I&#x27;ve really thought about, apart from 3x3x3).

Maybe so, but how much could you afford to spend on lawyers to stop 
them?

          <div class="email-content">The way to determine the needed scramble number would seem to be to 
determine the average number of moves required by a perfect solver for 
each number of scramble moves.

That is, scramble 18 moves and solve it in Cube Explorer 20 times and 
compute the average solve length. Do the same for 19, 20 etc, until the 
average stops increasing. That is the number of NEEDED to do a full 
scramble.

That would actually be interesting to see from 1 - 25 for other reasons.

with so am writing here. I just had my first succesful BLD solve of<br>
the 3x3x3.<br>
<br>
It took about 6 days for me to learn it completely..there was a gap of<br>
3-4 days in between as i had gotten sick, and when today i took the<br>
cube again, i had a unseccusful solve for the first time but the<br>
second time when i opened my eyes there it was the solved cube...i was<br>
never so happy to see a solved cube before !<br>
<br>
I made a mistaske in the last part doing a R while permuting the<br>
edges...then when i realised it i had to undo the moves and do it<br>
again, i was so tensed.<br>
<br>
Anyway i would like to say a lot of thanks to Tyson and Macky for<br>
their BLD tutorials. It was quite a journey learning the BLD<br>
solution(though typo errors in Tyson&#x27;s document made it more like an<br>
adventure ;) )<br>

That&#x27;s fine for the 3x3x3, Square-1, etc, where we have optimal 
solvers.  Unfortunately, we do NOT have optimal solvers for 4x4x4, 
5x5x5 and the megaminx, which is why I was wondering how you could 
estimate the necessary scramble lengths independently.

Taking the 3x3x3 as an example, the minimum d from &quot;my&quot; criterion 
would be 18, which is comparable with the median number of turns 
(about 18) actually needed to solve random cubes optimally.

Of course, you then have to add a few more turns to this d to stand a 
chance of sampling the &quot;deepest&quot; configurations...

But my question is still: How were the WCA scramble 
lengths /actually/ determined?

Hi Bram,
I too have become interesting in sudoku lately, and have found this 
program: 
http://www.angusj.com/sudoku/index.php 
It is very handy if you get stuck on a puzzle. It will tell you what 
to do to solve it step by step. I have also saved you some time by 
making the file you need to open for that puzzle: 
http://www.geocities.com/pjgat09/bramsudoku.zip

Install the program (you will like it alot), then unzip the file in 
the second link, and save it in a folder somewhere. Then open it with 
the program. When you have opened it, heres how it can show you how 
to solve it step by step: Click on View-Hint. It will show you a 
hint, and tell you at the bottom why it is. Then click View-Solve 
Next Step. This will use the hint to get the puzzle closer to solved. 

I hope this helped!!

Hi Tyson,
I only have 2 problems with what you said:
1. My mom would like to register me online, but to do this, we have to 
become a member of the rubik&#x27;s club or what ever. And this requires us 
to fill in that form with has the &quot;income&quot; question. Since my mom would 
rather not give out that information, we cant register unless they add 
an option like &quot;choose not to answer&quot;
2. The hotel. My mom used the internet form to book the hotel, but 
never got a confirmation. What should we do?

R1-R9, C1-C9 will denote the rows and columns and B1-B9 the boxes (in the order

123
456
789
).

I will not put in too many diagrams as it takes up a lot of space but here is the full solution 
- at least the one I came up with. Probably there are several. The crucial bit here wasdtep 
27. I hadn&#x27;t used anything like that before:

basically if you get a pattern of possibilities

ab           ac

ab                bc

as in this case (crucially, although they lie in 3 different columns they do lie in only 2 rows 
and in only 2 boxes) then because the two on the right lie in the same box they can&#x27;t both 
be c. Thus the two on the left can&#x27;t be a and b (a above b) so must be b and a (b above a). 
That allows for 1 and 3 to be determined and without guessing because they follow this 
logical pattern (above). Other than that the most difficult stages are probably 2 and 3 to 
get a start. 2. isn&#x27;t really so bad - it&#x27;s just observing that the triple 4,7,8 can only appear in 
3 squares (so splitting C9 into 2 subsets) whence 7 can be placed straightaway (this step 
can be done first but is less obvious than step 1.).
3. is a bit technical too but I think 27. is the key stage. It relies on spotting a triple in 4 
squares that do not lie all in the same column, row or box.
NB You can also solve the same initial puzzle except with a 7 in the middle instead of a 4. 
It is quite similar.

1. The intersection of R1 and C3 contains 6 (it is the only square in B1 that can contain a 
6). 
2. In C9, 4,7 and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9, leaving only the intersections with R1, R5 and 
R6. In particular, R5 already contains 4 and 8 so the intersection of C9 and R5 must 
contain 7. 
Initial Grid: 

*2*|***|*** 
***|6**|**3 
*74|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
***|**3|**2 
*8*|*4*|*1* 
6**|5**|*** 
------------------ 
***|*1*|78* 
5**|**9|*** 
***|***|*4* 

For convenience label rows R1 to R9 (downwards), columns C1-C9 (left to right), boxes 
B1-B9 (right then down). 

1. The intersection of R1 and C3 contains 6 (it is the only square in B1 that can contain a 
6). 

2. In C9, 4,7 and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9, leaving only the intersections with R1, R5 and 
R6. In particular, R5 already contains 4 and 8 so the intersection of C9 and R5 must 
contain 7. 

3. In B5, 1 and 8 must appear on the leading diagonal as they are already present in C5 
and R5. Thus since 7 is in R5, 7 must occur in the intersection of B5 and C5. In particular 
in C5, 4,7 and 8 appear before B8. Thus in R8 4,7,8 must occur in C2-C4 and hence 4 lies 
in the intersection of C2 and R8. 

4. Thus in B4, 4 goes in the intersection of R4 and C1. 

5. Thus in C1, 7 must go in R9. 

6. Recalling that in R8, C2-C4 contain 4,7 and 8, 8 must go in C3 (because B7 contains 
4,7) and so 7 in C4. 

*26|***|*** 
***|6**|**3 
*74|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
4**|**3|**2 
*8*|*4*|*17 
6**|5**|*** 
------------------ 
***|*1*|78* 
548|7*9|*** 
7**|***|*4* 

7. In C1, neither 1 nor 8 can go in R5 or R7 (because they both appear elsewhere in R5 and 
R7) so both must appear in B1 and further 3 doesn&#x27;t appear in the intersection of R2 and 
B1 so in B1 3 must be in C1. That leaves 5 and 9 in the intersection of B1 and R2 which 
means that (recalling 7 is in the intersection of B5 and C5) the intersection of R2 and C5 
must be a 2. 

8. Thus 2 must appear in the intersection of B5 and R5 (since 1,8 are on the leading 
diagonal of that box) and 2 can&#x27;t appear in the intersection of C1 and R5. Since the 
intersection of C1 and B1 contains 1,3 and 8 it follows that 2 must appear in the 
intersection of C1 and R7 and 9 in the intersection of C1 and R5. 

9. In B4, 2 must appear in C3 but neither in R4 nor (because 2 appears in the intersection 
of B5 and R5) in R5, so 2 must appear in the intersection of C3 and R6.

10. Therefore in B4, 7 appears in the intersection of R4 and C3. 

11. So in B5, recalling 7 is in C5, 7 must occur in R6. 

12. Now 9 already appearing in R5 and 1,8 being on the leading diagonal of B5, 9 must 
appear in B5 at the intersection of R4 and C5. 

13. Again, 6 being already in C4 and R6, 6 must be in B5 at the intersection of C6 and R5.

14. 2s being in B4 and B6, the only remaining place in R5 for a 2 is the intersection with 
B5, i.e. in C4. 

15. In B4, 1 must fall in C2, hence 1 must fall in C3 in B7, but not in R7 as we already have 
a 1 in R7. So 1 must fall in R9 and C3 in B9. 

16. Moreover, in B8, 2 must lie in C6 but not in R7 (hence in R9). 

17. Again in B8, 8 can&#x27;t appear in R7 or C5 so it must be in the intersection of C4 and R9. 

18. Thus in B5 we have that 1 lies in R4 and 8 lies in R6. 

19. Now in B4, 1 lies in R6, 5 lies in R4, leaving 3 in R5. 

20. In R4 8 can&#x27;t lie in C8 and so must lie in C7, leaving 6 in C8 to complete R4. Also 5 
completes R5.

21. Way back in 2, we figured that in C9, 4, 7 and 8 could lie only in R1, R5 and R6. From 
B6, we conclude that 4 must lie in the intersection of C9 and R6 and so 8 in the 
intersection of C9 and R1. 

22. Now in B1, 8 must lie in R2 and C1. 

23. From 7., in B1 5 and 9 are in R2. Since also 5 is in C2 and B4, 5 must lie in the 
intersection of B1 and C3 and 9 in the intersection of B1 and C2. 

24. In C3, 9 must go in R7 (as that is all that remains in C3). 

25. In R2 only 1,4 and 7 remain but in C8 both 1 and 4 are placed, so 7 lies in the 
intersection of R2 and C8. 

26. Hence the final 7 must go in B2 in the intersection of R1 and C6. 

*26|**7|**8 
895|62*|*73 
*74|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
457|193|862 
983|246|517 
612|578|**4 
------------------ 
2*9|*1*|78* 
548|7*9|*** 
7*1|8*2|*4* 

27. The intersection of C5 and R1 is either 3 or 5. Similarly the intersection of C6 and R3 
is either 1 or 5. Also in B1 the remaining numbers are 1 and 3. Since 5 cannot occupy two 
places in B2 either the intersection of C5 and R1 is 3 or the intersection of C6 and R3 is 1. 
In the first case 3 can&#x27;t go into the intersection of R1 with B1 (so 1 goes there and 3 in the 
remaining space of B1) and in the second 1 can&#x27;t go in the intersection of R3 with B1 (so 3 
goes there and 1 in the remaining space of B1). Either way 1 goes in the intersection of R1 
with B1 and 3 in the intersection of R3 with B1. 

126|**7|**8 
895|62*|*73 
374|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
457|193|862 
983|246|517 
612|578|**4 
------------------ 
2*9|*1*|78* 
548|7*9|*** 
7*1|8*2|*4*

28. In C4, only 3, 4 and 9 remain to be filled but R3 already contains 3 and 4, so the 
intersection of C4 with R3 contains 9. 

29. Thus 9 is not in the intersection of R3 and C9, so it is in the intersection of C9 and B9 
but it isn&#x27;t in R7 or R8 so it is at the intersection of C9 and R9. 

30. This implies that in R9 5 lies in C5. 

31. Thus in B9, 5 must occur in R7 and hence also in C9 and also in B8 6 must lie in C5 
and so in R8. 

32. So in R7, 6 must lie in C2, then in C2, 3 must lie in R9 and in R9 6 must lie in C7 and 3 
is the only remaining number to be filled in C5. 

33. In B8, 3 must lie in C4 leaving 4 in C6. 

34. 4 is the only thing left to go in C4, so in R2 4 must go in C7 leaving 1 in C6 to 
complete R2 and thus 5 in R3 to complete B2. 

35. In R1 5 must go in C8 and hence 9 in C7 to complete. Thus in R6 9 must go in C8 and 
so 3 in C7 to complete. 

36. In C8, 3 must go in R8 leaving 2 in R3 to complete. Thus in C7 2 must go in R8 leaving 
1 in R3 to complete. Thus in C9 1 must go in R3 leaving 2 in C8 to complete the puzzle.

I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m going to end up competing more events than what I
registered for seeing as how I&#x27;ve learned both the magic and master
magic since I registered.

Is this kind of thing something you need to know about from already
registered people?

if we came to a conclusion.

          <div class="email-content">You may assemble the cube so that you can tell orientation.  In fact, I 
think everyone should always sticker their cube in this manner.  
However, the spirit of the law allows you to feel for orientation 
during a BLD solve if you pop.  You can&#x27;t pop pieces out on purpose, 
feel for which way they belong in, and then stick them in.

If anyone wants to try that, I&#x27;d be happy to race them.  I&#x27;ll give you 
a minute head start too.  (I think trying to tell orientation that way 
would slow you down like mad.)

So I guess it wasn&#x27;t you who added the rule to forbid exactly this?

Hi Bram,
I too have become interesting in sudoku lately, and have found this 
program: 
http://www.angusj.com/sudoku/index.php
&lt;http://www.angusj.com/sudoku/index.php>  
It is very handy if you get stuck on a puzzle. It will tell you what 
to do to solve it step by step. I have also saved you some time by 
making the file you need to open for that puzzle: 
http://www.geocities.com/pjgat09/bramsudoku.zip
&lt;http://www.geocities.com/pjgat09/bramsudoku.zip> 

Install the program (you will like it alot), then unzip the file in 
the second link, and save it in a folder somewhere. Then open it with 
the program. When you have opened it, heres how it can show you how 
to solve it step by step: Click on View-Hint. It will show you a 
hint, and tell you at the bottom why it is. Then click View-Solve 
Next Step. This will use the hint to get the puzzle closer to solved. 

I hope this helped!!
Peter Greenwood

R1-R9, C1-C9 will denote the rows and columns and B1-B9 the boxes (in the
order

123
456
789
).

I will not put in too many diagrams as it takes up a lot of space but here
is the full solution 
- at least the one I came up with. Probably there are several. The crucial
bit here wasdtep 
27. I hadn&#x27;t used anything like that before:

basically if you get a pattern of possibilities

ab           ac

ab                bc

as in this case (crucially, although they lie in 3 different columns they do
lie in only 2 rows 
and in only 2 boxes) then because the two on the right lie in the same box
they can&#x27;t both 
be c. Thus the two on the left can&#x27;t be a and b (a above b) so must be b and
a (b above a). 
That allows for 1 and 3 to be determined and without guessing because they
follow this 
logical pattern (above). Other than that the most difficult stages are
probably 2 and 3 to 
get a start. 2. isn&#x27;t really so bad - it&#x27;s just observing that the triple
4,7,8 can only appear in 
3 squares (so splitting C9 into 2 subsets) whence 7 can be placed
straightaway (this step 
can be done first but is less obvious than step 1.).
3. is a bit technical too but I think 27. is the key stage. It relies on
spotting a triple in 4 
squares that do not lie all in the same column, row or box.
NB You can also solve the same initial puzzle except with a 7 in the middle
instead of a 4. 
It is quite similar.

1. The intersection of R1 and C3 contains 6 (it is the only square in B1
that can contain a 
6). 
2. In C9, 4,7 and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9, leaving only the intersections
with R1, R5 and 
R6. In particular, R5 already contains 4 and 8 so the intersection of C9 and
R5 must 
contain 7. 
Initial Grid: 

*2*|***|*** 
***|6**|**3 
*74|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
***|**3|**2 
*8*|*4*|*1* 
6**|5**|*** 
------------------ 
***|*1*|78* 
5**|**9|*** 
***|***|*4* 

For convenience label rows R1 to R9 (downwards), columns C1-C9 (left to
right), boxes 
B1-B9 (right then down). 

1. The intersection of R1 and C3 contains 6 (it is the only square in B1
that can contain a 
6). 

2. In C9, 4,7 and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9, leaving only the intersections
with R1, R5 and 
R6. In particular, R5 already contains 4 and 8 so the intersection of C9 and
R5 must 
contain 7. 

3. In B5, 1 and 8 must appear on the leading diagonal as they are already
present in C5 
and R5. Thus since 7 is in R5, 7 must occur in the intersection of B5 and
C5. In particular 
in C5, 4,7 and 8 appear before B8. Thus in R8 4,7,8 must occur in C2-C4 and
hence 4 lies 
in the intersection of C2 and R8. 

4. Thus in B4, 4 goes in the intersection of R4 and C1. 

5. Thus in C1, 7 must go in R9. 

6. Recalling that in R8, C2-C4 contain 4,7 and 8, 8 must go in C3 (because
B7 contains 
4,7) and so 7 in C4. 

*26|***|*** 
***|6**|**3 
*74|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
4**|**3|**2 
*8*|*4*|*17 
6**|5**|*** 
------------------ 
***|*1*|78* 
548|7*9|*** 
7**|***|*4* 

7. In C1, neither 1 nor 8 can go in R5 or R7 (because they both appear
elsewhere in R5 and 
R7) so both must appear in B1 and further 3 doesn&#x27;t appear in the
intersection of R2 and 
B1 so in B1 3 must be in C1. That leaves 5 and 9 in the intersection of B1
and R2 which 
means that (recalling 7 is in the intersection of B5 and C5) the
intersection of R2 and C5 
must be a 2. 

8. Thus 2 must appear in the intersection of B5 and R5 (since 1,8 are on the
leading 
diagonal of that box) and 2 can&#x27;t appear in the intersection of C1 and R5.
Since the 
intersection of C1 and B1 contains 1,3 and 8 it follows that 2 must appear
in the 
intersection of C1 and R7 and 9 in the intersection of C1 and R5. 

9. In B4, 2 must appear in C3 but neither in R4 nor (because 2 appears in
the intersection 
of B5 and R5) in R5, so 2 must appear in the intersection of C3 and R6.

10. Therefore in B4, 7 appears in the intersection of R4 and C3. 

11. So in B5, recalling 7 is in C5, 7 must occur in R6. 

12. Now 9 already appearing in R5 and 1,8 being on the leading diagonal of
B5, 9 must 
appear in B5 at the intersection of R4 and C5. 

13. Again, 6 being already in C4 and R6, 6 must be in B5 at the intersection
of C6 and R5.

14. 2s being in B4 and B6, the only remaining place in R5 for a 2 is the
intersection with 
B5, i.e. in C4. 

15. In B4, 1 must fall in C2, hence 1 must fall in C3 in B7, but not in R7
as we already have 
a 1 in R7. So 1 must fall in R9 and C3 in B9. 

16. Moreover, in B8, 2 must lie in C6 but not in R7 (hence in R9). 

17. Again in B8, 8 can&#x27;t appear in R7 or C5 so it must be in the
intersection of C4 and R9. 

18. Thus in B5 we have that 1 lies in R4 and 8 lies in R6. 

19. Now in B4, 1 lies in R6, 5 lies in R4, leaving 3 in R5. 

20. In R4 8 can&#x27;t lie in C8 and so must lie in C7, leaving 6 in C8 to
complete R4. Also 5 
completes R5.

21. Way back in 2, we figured that in C9, 4, 7 and 8 could lie only in R1,
R5 and R6. From 
B6, we conclude that 4 must lie in the intersection of C9 and R6 and so 8 in
the 
intersection of C9 and R1. 

22. Now in B1, 8 must lie in R2 and C1. 

23. From 7., in B1 5 and 9 are in R2. Since also 5 is in C2 and B4, 5 must
lie in the 
intersection of B1 and C3 and 9 in the intersection of B1 and C2. 

24. In C3, 9 must go in R7 (as that is all that remains in C3). 

25. In R2 only 1,4 and 7 remain but in C8 both 1 and 4 are placed, so 7 lies
in the 
intersection of R2 and C8. 

26. Hence the final 7 must go in B2 in the intersection of R1 and C6. 

*26|**7|**8 
895|62*|*73 
*74|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
457|193|862 
983|246|517 
612|578|**4 
------------------ 
2*9|*1*|78* 
548|7*9|*** 
7*1|8*2|*4* 

27. The intersection of C5 and R1 is either 3 or 5. Similarly the
intersection of C6 and R3 
is either 1 or 5. Also in B1 the remaining numbers are 1 and 3. Since 5
cannot occupy two 
places in B2 either the intersection of C5 and R1 is 3 or the intersection
of C6 and R3 is 1. 
In the first case 3 can&#x27;t go into the intersection of R1 with B1 (so 1 goes
there and 3 in the 
remaining space of B1) and in the second 1 can&#x27;t go in the intersection of
R3 with B1 (so 3 
goes there and 1 in the remaining space of B1). Either way 1 goes in the
intersection of R1 
with B1 and 3 in the intersection of R3 with B1. 

126|**7|**8 
895|62*|*73 
374|*8*|*** 
------------------ 
457|193|862 
983|246|517 
612|578|**4 
------------------ 
2*9|*1*|78* 
548|7*9|*** 
7*1|8*2|*4*

28. In C4, only 3, 4 and 9 remain to be filled but R3 already contains 3 and
4, so the 
intersection of C4 with R3 contains 9. 

29. Thus 9 is not in the intersection of R3 and C9, so it is in the
intersection of C9 and B9 
but it isn&#x27;t in R7 or R8 so it is at the intersection of C9 and R9. 

30. This implies that in R9 5 lies in C5. 

31. Thus in B9, 5 must occur in R7 and hence also in C9 and also in B8 6
must lie in C5 
and so in R8. 

32. So in R7, 6 must lie in C2, then in C2, 3 must lie in R9 and in R9 6
must lie in C7 and 3 
is the only remaining number to be filled in C5. 

33. In B8, 3 must lie in C4 leaving 4 in C6. 

34. 4 is the only thing left to go in C4, so in R2 4 must go in C7 leaving 1
in C6 to 
complete R2 and thus 5 in R3 to complete B2. 

35. In R1 5 must go in C8 and hence 9 in C7 to complete. Thus in R6 9 must
go in C8 and 
so 3 in C7 to complete. 

36. In C8, 3 must go in R8 leaving 2 in R3 to complete. Thus in C7 2 must go
in R8 leaving 
1 in R3 to complete. Thus in C9 1 must go in R3 leaving 2 in C8 to complete
the puzzle.

I bought 2 weeks ago a book full of SUdoku&#x27;s at Glasgow airport.

I&#x27;ve solved now about 30 of them (82 to go :p)

Sudoku is very addictive.
(moreover it says on the back cover that Sudoku&#x27;s are what Rubik&#x27;s
Cube was in the 70&#x27;s...

          <div class="email-content">I have a couple knock-off cheap versions from Taiwan.  My brother and I  
got into it awhile back but we could only judge &#x27;speed&#x27; by the pitch  
that the powerball was making.  I can totally see myself getting  
obsessed given that these models now give you actual rpm numbers.

It&#x27;s kinda like running or whatever... I dunno, maybe I think I&#x27;ve just  
got problems with being too competitive.  If I go out for a normal run,  
it&#x27;s all nice and happy.  If I&#x27;m on a track, I have the sudden urge to  
time myself.

Congratz, Sachin!
I&#x27;m learning BLD too, but I&#x27;m having some troubles with edge 
permutation...sometimes I flip the corners when permuting the edges...

          <div class="email-content">Hi Bram,
If you look in the program that i showed you inder File-Creat New, 
you can make 5 different levels of difficult puzzles. Each is a few 
steps up from the previous one, with like 2-3 more techniques you 
will need. The methods are all included in the help file, so if you 
dont understand, you can just check there. 

Have fun and good luck!

Our newest cube demo (ver 0.03.0007) includes (among other changes) <br>
supercube versions for every puzzle size!  It is available now on <br>

something we had considered doing, you online cubers have been so <br>
wonderful about sharing your ideas and comments with us that we <br>
wanted to make something just for you: the only folks we know that <br>
might not cry at the thought of solving a 20x20x20 supercube.  We <br>
also increased the range of the timer and move counters to <br>
accomodate the larger cube sizes.  So enjoy and keep the suggestions <br>

Why don&#x27;t they see the difference between a 3x3x3 and a 5x5x5? I had to show him a 3x3x3 before he saw the difference. :-)

  I was quietly cubing in a cafe late the other night and a woman with a 
  rather loud voice informed me that 
  (1) she loved Rubik&#x27;s cubes (a good start, I thought) 
  (2) she had never actually owned a cube 
  (3) she could solve it in 5 seconds.  

  It&#x27;s no use arguing... I just told her that that was a pretty good time.
  There ought to be a special UWR page for these folk. ;)

whole thing. It&#x27;s still &#x27;simple&#x27; (as in: it&#x27;s does not require a lot <br>

easier than before, IMHO.<br>

unique is it?  you can still swap some pieces, i think
the colored band around the edge is the only way to
make each piece unique, so there would be a box around
every ever subsequent layer to the edge...or am i off
my rocker

Wow, English train travellers are obviously nicer than Dutch commuters.<br>
When I cube in the train, most of the time people demonstratively move to a seat far away. Or they ask me to stop, because of the noise that cubing makes.<br>
Only once in a while people are interested or amazed.<br>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Cubing on the train<br>
<br>
<br>
  I often cube on the train. Sometimes no one pays any attention, but<br>
  sometimes they do. Tonight was definitely the later. A group of four<br>
  girls sitting across from me let out audible gasps when I finished a<br>
  solve. I like to take any opportunity to promote cubing, so if anyone<br>
  shows any interest on the train (or anywhere!) I&#x27;ll offer to do them<br>
  another demo and ask them to do the scramble themselves (so they know<br>
  it wasn&#x27;t &#x27;set up&#x27; and also to get them involved). I did a few more<br>
  3x3x3 demos for them and they were very impressed. Then I whipped out<br>
  the 4x4x4 and got them to scramble that too. :)<br>
<br>
  Later during the train trip, another group of people got on. They were<br>
  pretty amazed (&quot;Oh my goodness! Did you just solve that thing?!&quot;) and<br>
  so I handed them my cube. I did several demos as various different<br>
  people in train scrambled my cube. They timed one of the solves (32<br>
  seconds) and then I got an applause from half the train carriage. When<br>
  the train was approaching the final stop, which was also my stop,<br>
  there was one guy left from the group. He&#x27;d been further down the<br>
  carriage and hadn&#x27;t actually seen my solves, he&#x27;d just heard his<br>
  friends talking (&quot;Wow! She just solved that in 32 seconds!&quot;) So<br>
  obviously I offered to do a demo for him. :) He was completely blown<br>
  away and asked me what I did. He then asked me if I was looking for a<br>
  job and gave me his contact details!<br>
<br>
  BTW, I beat my PB single solve tonight too - 22.23 seconds. :)<br>

Jean solves F2L with &lt;y, U, R> using left hand for cube rotations (y) 
and right hand for solving (U, R). Now after watching Macky&#x27;s video I 
think he does it very similarly, though sometimes he also seems to 
hold the cross more on the left than on the bottom.

          <div class="email-content">European trains must be much quieter than the London Tube if the noise
from a cube is disturbing people! The London Tube is very loud and
bumpy - no one would ever even hear me cubing on the Tube.

I was just in the US very briefly (flew back into London earlier
today) and cubed on the train there too. One guy said he&#x27;d seen
someone on TV do it blindfolded and behind their back and asked if I
could do this. I said no, but that I knew people who could. I asked
who he&#x27;d seen on TV doing this because I assumed it was probably
someone from this group. He didn&#x27;t remember the name though.

Anyone done any blindfolded cubing on TV?

Great picture! and great concentration too - everyone else in the log 
looks very impressed.

Perhaps it&#x27;s time for &quot;High-Profile Cubing&quot; or &quot;Extreme Cubing&quot;, where 
people share pictures of:

- cubing with famous people (actors, politicians, sports figures, etc) 
Note that high-profile cubers don&#x27;t count :-)

- cubing in &quot;extreme&quot; places (landmarks, mountains, skydiving, 
rollercoasters, etc). See &quot;Extreme Ironing&quot; (www.extremeironing.com) 
for a comparison.

Is the &quot;photos&quot; section of this group a resonable place for such 
photos??? Anyone else have such photos???

sounds like fun,

yeff

          <div class="email-content">I used to use the Petrus Niklas and Sune to solve the 2x2x2.  It works
out okay because you don&#x27;t have to worry about the edges permuting, of
course.  Since Petrus was the only method I knew to solve the 3x3x3 at
the time, it was what I used.

I recently learned the PLL algorithms so my approach to the 2x2x2 has
changed to use those instead.  A strict Petrus type approach to the
2x2x2 probably isn&#x27;t ideal because a couple of the corner orientations
require 2 Sunes or something in order to get the whole LL oriented. 
Probably faster to use a simple OLL algorithm and then a PLL.  I
suppose that you could learn the Sune orientations well enough to be
able to do a 2 look LL on the 2x2x2 (1 for permutation, one for
orientation) instead of the opposite approach.  Still more turns
though probably.

<br>
I have a question about sokoban puzzles (where you push boxes around<br>
into designated spots).<br>
<br>
My girlfriend recently gave me the link to this page<br>
http://www.addictinggames.com/ledix<br>
<br>
and of course I&#x27;m addicted to it :-)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m almost done with it, there are 24 levels and I&#x27;m on #18.<br>
<br>
Anyway I had an idea, do they have team sokoban puzzles?  Where you<br>
can control two characters to move the boxes around?<br>
<br>
It seems like you could make some really crazy puzzles like this. <br>
Like you could completely box in one guy to move boxes out of the way,<br>
then the boxed in guy would have to, at the right moment, start moving<br>
those 4 boxes around, stuff like that.<br>
<br>
Anyone know a simple way to make sokoban puzzles online?  If no one<br>
has ever made pair sokoban puzzles then I&#x27;d love to try it and see if<br>
it works.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if there are any other sokoban fans, let me know if pair<br>
sokoban solving exists.  I&#x27;m curious.<br>

Mmh, I thought about the latter again. It&#x27;s like he does z turns or 
rather holds the cube at about z/2, enabling him to do &lt;L,U,R> all 
with his right hand! Pretty cool...

It seems to work fine for me. To test this I went first to a cube
size I know well - 5x5x5. I do prefer Stefan&#x27;s style of supercube
sticker available at cubesmith but I was able to get used to the
arrow verson easily enough.

I solved a 5x5x5 - 526 moves in 26 min 08 sec
and then a 6x6x6 - 890 moves in 45 min 42 sec

bigger supercube solves to come :)

It both astounds and annoys me that non-cubers have so much trouble
telling the difference between a 5x5x5, a 4x4x4 and a 3x3x3. Until you
put a 3x3x3 next to it they don&#x27;t even realise it&#x27;s different puzzle!
Grrr!

Everyone notices that the 2x2x2 is a different puzzle though. People
see the 2x2x2 and say &quot;that looks easy, I reckon I can do that one!&quot;
To which I always reply &quot;well, I challenge you then!&quot; Of course, they
NEVER can solve it. The 2x2x2 is only easy for a cuber.

asked him how he knew about this. He said it had been all over the<br>

Just thought you&#x27;d be interested to know that the publicity for the<br>

Yeah, I was once cubing with a 4x4 and someone said something about 
how he used to play with it, too. I took out my 3x3 and asked &quot;are you 
sure you don&#x27;t mean this one?&quot; and he insisted it was the 4x4. Well 
ok, it&#x27;s not impossible. But then he insisted it was a keychain one. 
Ever saw a keychain 4x4?

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I just did my second ever 50 cube average on the 4x4x4.  The first<br>
time I was incredibly close to sub-1:10 and was kind of mad, so I did<br>
another one today and I made it!<br>
<br>
It was incredibly hard to stay concentrated.  I was at about a 1:07.xx<br>
average after 30 solves, but after that point I totally lost my focus.<br>
    I think with more practice sub-1:08 for 50 cubes should be possible.<br>
<br>
I thought about doing a 100 cube average, but I think that would be a<br>
bit much for the 4x4, but maybe others have done it.<br>
<br>
Anyway I was very happy with this average and wanted to post:<br>

          <div class="email-content">I remember quite a few years ago (maybe 3 or 4), I saw somebody doing <br>
the cube on one of the Network morning shows, like &quot;Today&quot;.  It seems <br>
like it was NBC, but I might be wrong.  Anyone here know who it was?<br>
<br>
My guess would be Dan Knights, cause he was the only well known really <br>
fast cuber a few years ago, but I&#x27;m not sure.<br>
<br>
He got about a 20-24 second solve if I remember.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not really as fast as all of you guys, but I  am always around 1
minute for an average solve...The other day I was out golfing with my
dad and his co-workers and after we had lunch and I pulled out my
cube, which my mom once commented was like a soother cuz I never go
anywheres without it, and then one guy was like, can you do it???Let
me time you, and then he pulled out his watch and i went...and it was
not the greatest solve of mine ever but it wasn&#x27;t bad...and then when
I was done he said it had taken me 3 minutes 21 seconds and I was
like...no...that&#x27;s not right...and he was like...yah...it is...and
then he amazed me and solved it using a weird method, mainly intuitive...

          <div class="email-content">I was at Dorney Park solving my cube and a guy decided to &quot;time&quot; me. 
He looked at his cell phone and it said 5:15 when I started.  It said
5:16 when I finished.  His claim to his friends was &quot;This guy can
solve a cube in about a minute.&quot;  The solve was probably closer to 1/3
of that. :(

Well he *did* realize the difference, cause he insisted he had played 
with the 4x4, not the 3x3. But I&#x27;m quite sure he said so because the 
4x4 was the first he saw me with so he immediately thought that&#x27;s what 
he had, too, and when I pulled out the 3x3 it looked different but at 
that point he was already convinced the 4x4 was what he had so he 
sticked to that.

Hey, you should&#x27;ve tried again from 5:17 to 5:17 then he would&#x27;ve said 
you solved it in no time :-)

Onderwerp: [Speed cubing group] Puzzle question (sokoban)


Hey everyone,

I have a question about sokoban puzzles (where you push boxes around
into designated spots).

My girlfriend recently gave me the link to this page
http://www.addictinggames.com/ledix &lt;http://www.addictinggames.com/ledix> 

and of course I&#x27;m addicted to it :-)

I&#x27;m almost done with it, there are 24 levels and I&#x27;m on #18.

Anyway I had an idea, do they have team sokoban puzzles?  Where you
can control two characters to move the boxes around?

It seems like you could make some really crazy puzzles like this. 
Like you could completely box in one guy to move boxes out of the way,
then the boxed in guy would have to, at the right moment, start moving
those 4 boxes around, stuff like that.

Anyone know a simple way to make sokoban puzzles online?  If no one
has ever made pair sokoban puzzles then I&#x27;d love to try it and see if
it works.

Anyway, if there are any other sokoban fans, let me know if pair
sokoban solving exists.  I&#x27;m curious.

Chris

The guy said the solver took 12 minutes. This surprised me since most
of the BLD solvers here do it much faster than that. Perhaps it was
something he saw ages ago? Or perhaps the guy mis-remembered how long
it took?

Apparently yes, but he doesn&#x27;t give details.  My own question is 
whether it can be done without getting silicone on the paper inserts.  
I hate the sight of silicone-soaked paper. ;)

Yeah, just disassemble it, then clean it, then lube a towel piece and 
polish all pieces (except the paper ;-) with it. Leave a &quot;dry&quot; film, 
i.e. very thin, if necessary polish a bit more with an unlubed piece.

Btw, who has a metal clock?

Cheers!

Ha! I asked for that, but I do get silicone grease /everywhere/ when I 
lube a puzzle.  Will have to stop smearing it on with my fingers -- 
just the thought of that would probably make you feel ill. :D

Yeah, I even bought 50 thin one-time gloves recently for work like 
that (cost about $2).

You and/or Ron, in the role of representing WCA, need to take a
professional stand on this: inform Guiness *formally* that they may no
longer publish Rubik&#x27;s cube records unless they adopt WCA standards
and criteria. Do it politely but in an authoritative tone.

Consider how the Olympic&#x27;s governing body would write such a letter.

Regards,

David J

I&#x27;ve been away for two weeks (and there have been 700 additional

some same named guys + something on svekub.se and my speedcuber

Do you think &quot;glue&quot; = &quot;huge amounts of super glue&quot; ?
I used strips that are intended to put posters on the wall.

In the meantime I constructed something better, though:

I take them all out and hold them all as one ring with the metal parts 
on one place. Then I lube a towel piece and wipe along the strings, 
leaving out the metal parts.

It also depends a lot on how you treat your Magic. Bob wrote he broke 
more than 60, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve broken more than 20 and not many in 
recent times. Ok, maybe he has practiced more. Also, I recently heard 
from Josef Jelinek (also very fast) that he only ever broke one string 
and another person was involved in that. So be nice to your Magic :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Nah, it&#x27;s pretty ok. The helmet was uncomfortable. But this new 
construction is pretty lightweight.

Do the participants in a competition sign something

Just a question?

          <div class="email-content">Hi fellow cubers! It&#x27;s been months since I&#x27;ve posted here or even read<br>
the messages. It&#x27;s amazing to see how much the community has grown and<br>
how times have improved. The best average is now 13 seconds! and a<br>
sub20 average would only place me 62 on the UWR list. I remember when<br>
I was 36th(i think) with 20.96.<br>
Anyway, I&#x27;ve barely solved a cube in the last few months but I&#x27;m<br>
getting back into it now seeing that I only have 2 months of practice<br>
left before the world championships. I took a couple averages. My<br>
first was 27.xx and my second 23.xx so I&#x27;m getting back to my old<br>
times but I still need to learn/relearn many algs and hopefully I will<br>
be sub20 before the champs. Just thought I&#x27;d drop by and say hi. I&#x27;m<br>
looking foward to finally meeting everyone in November.<br>

That number has jumped up over 80, master magic strings included, I
believe. Never broken any on my Magic Balls, though. :)  I&#x27;m gentler
with that puzzle, though.  I think that I am actually abusive to my
puzzle.  The &quot;angry magic&quot; video Craig mentioned is only the end of
that segment.  I was just as violent for a few minutes prior to that
clip, but grew increasingly violent when the puzzle was being mean to
me back.

advantage over stickers because tiles allow you to see the color

Is there some place to get tiles that I don&#x27;t know about??? Please do

I asked that to Rubiks.com, they told me they would see with the WCA
and then decide.Tyson and Ron (members of the WCA) told several tims
here that unofficial stickers would be allowed. (I&#x27;m 99% sure of this,
correct me if I&#x27;m wrong)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Duncan,

If you check the WCA regulations, you will find that there are regulations about the stickers, but none about the logos in the center or which trade mark.

Competitions may have additional rules. For WC2005 the only additional rule is that the CUBES must be Rubik&#x27;s. But the stickers don&#x27;t need to be Rubik&#x27;s.
We are thinking about adding a sticker set to the WC2005 gift pack.

Have fun,

Ron

  Back to an old question - are tiles acceptable for competition solves?  In 
  particular are they allowed in the WC?
  I don&#x27;t see why they shouldnt be but I&#x27;m very wary of the rules.  Someone 
  said they had asked whether non-official stickers could be used but I never

Hello Ron,

is that the pack that&#x27;s going to be given to any person that register

I am sure you will love the WC2005 gift pack! It will be a collectible, like the WC2003 gift pack.

Yes, everyone competing at WC2005 will receive a gift pack.

living in Australia for 28 years! Surprisingly, I think most<br>
Australians visit Europe before they visit their nearest neighbour!<br>

Is that page up yet, by any chance? I&#x27;m really interested in 
practicing with my friend, but we are terrible at the F2L, and I see 
no reason to make up our own naming system, since you guys have 
already done it. Who knows, maybe we&#x27;ll get a chance to practice 
together sometime! 
But I&#x27;ll have to learn all the OLL algorithms first, urrghhhhh....

If I am wrong, correct me.

This is mostly up to date, but not fully.

          <div class="email-content">Tiles are better stickers if you ask me, but when they start losing their 
adhesiveness, the corners of them come up and when you&#x27;re cubing it can dig 
under your nail and hurt.life a mofo. (believe me, its happened 2wice)
But they stay on way longer, and look cool too,

Yeah that was mine. I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m brutal when I cube and think I
grind my nails on them a lot.
It&#x27;s definitely my fault, not yours : ) I love your stickers - and
they don&#x27;t chip for any of my friends.

          <div class="email-content">I was noticing that the proliferation of posts to the group this
weekend has not been as overwhelming as usual. Someone suggested to me
that it might be because it&#x27;s a long weekend in the US (Labor Day
weekend?).

If this is true then it means that &lt;shock! amazement!> *sometimes*
cubers might actually get out of the house and do other things! Surely
not! :o

Although, I guess that just because cubers aren&#x27;t sitting in front of
their computers doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t cubing...

          <div class="email-content">Hi there,<br>
<br>
<br>
I wanted to share my thoughts about the effect of public <br>
cubing.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m &quot;seriously&quot; into speedcubing since late april (did<br>
BLD before). I&#x27;m usially averaging between 27 and 31 now,<br>
my personal best AVG10 being around 27.5.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m mostly cubing in the metro, in Paris. This is the place<br>
where I make my best times. I&#x27;m 100% sure I am sub23 in<br>
the metro, where usually 2-3 people are glaring at the<br>
cube. I don&#x27;t need to time myself : I KNOW that my F2L is<br>
way faster in the metro. Is that the effect of public <br>
cubing ?<br>
<br>
OK, then I&#x27;ll talk about my times, in different contexts,<br>
in a decreasing order of efficiency.<br>
<br>
1. REHEARSAL : I execute the same scrambling over and over.<br>
   In that case, my times are between 17 and 20, depending<br>
   on the OLL/PLL case mostly. It means that I lose about<br>
   10 secs on recognition. This is my &quot;dexterity time&quot;.<br>
<br>
2. METRO : I would say between 22 and 25 secs<br>
<br>
3. BUS : between 27 and 31<br>
<br>
4. TIMING MYSELF W/ NETCUBE : between 27 and 31<br>
<br>
5. TAKING VIDEOS : between 23 and 40 (!!!)<br>
<br>
6. IN FRONT OF FRIENDS : between 28 and 38 (!!)<br>
<br>
There&#x27;s something weird about the difference between &quot;METRO&quot;<br>
and &quot;FRIENDS&quot;. I came up with this explanation : the parisian<br>
METRO is one of the MOST unpersonal place I know. People are<br>
never communicating. This is a DEAD place. So maybe, the only<br>
thing my brain can do is : &quot;focus on the cube, and do nothing<br>
else&quot;. And it seems to work.<br>
<br>
The Bus is more convivial. You know that somebody may ask you<br>
questions about cubing. It happens often actually. It seems<br>
to disturb my concentration.<br>
<br>
Then &quot;taking vids&quot; or &quot;timing&quot; : I&#x27;m JUDGING MYSELF, so, I&#x27;m<br>
not 100% focused. Not to talk about friends... then if I run<br>
into a difficult case, it can become terrible.<br>
<br>
My (not so original) conclusion about this is : find a way<br>
to focus 100% on your cube, and forget about the environment.<br>
For some, it may help to train in their worst &quot;conditions&quot; <br>
(i.e. : in public). <br>
For others, it  may help to change the conditions of <br>
performing, just in order to see how one can keep 100% of <br>
the concentrations on the moves and the anticipations.<br>
<br>
My best performances are in front of the DEAD public of the<br>
metro ;).<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve never attended a competition so far. It might be my<br>
worst case scenario. See you in the next french open I hope...<br>

always break at least 1 PB...i don&#x27;t know why...but I do...Today I had
a co-worker&#x27;s friend(pretty hot to mention) ask me to do a solve for
her...and let me say that i&#x27;m lucky that the timer wouldn&#x27;t

          <div class="email-content">yes that is the corrected version

both me and Akimoto have been using this alg for several years, 
though I am faster with the inverse (both are needed in a more 
advanced CLL/ELL system)

The reason why it appears wrong is probably because we both (I 
think, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) execute it with LL on D, and so 
typing it out he must have accidently mirrored some of the turns 
instead of rotating them x2.

It&#x27;s done faster when LL is on D I think.

I do it this way:
FD&#x27;F&#x27;D&#x27;R2&#x27;U&#x27;LBL&#x27;UR2&#x27;

Definately not one of my fastest CLL cases, but this is how I&#x27;ve 
been doing it:
F (with right index downward)
  4 quick progessions
D&#x27; (with right thumb and middle finger)
F&#x27; (with right thumb)
D&#x27; (with right middle finger)
R2&#x27; (sweep with many fingers on right hand)
U&#x27; (right thumb)
(rDr&#x27;U) (a quick trigger)
R2&#x27; (sweep with many fingers on right hand)

Thought I do it entirely as rapid progression of my right fingers, 
some might use their left index for U&#x27; turns, and I think I might 
have at some point changed to that and then reverted back (due to 
lack of practice). [I say rapid progression of turns because it&#x27;s 
not something I would catergorize as a triggerable alg.]

Hope that sheds some light on the mysterious land of CLL.

          <div class="email-content">I think most cubers don&#x27;t understand the algorithms they use but just
memorize them and execute them accordingly.

But if you spend enough time thinking about an algorithm, then one 
may
gain insite into how they actaully work, why they do what they do.

Most algs we use are quite complicated and can&#x27;t be disected into
small parts that are understandable.

Here is an example of one of the simplest PLL that I&#x27;m sure most ppl
understand. The so-called &quot;Allan&quot; maneuver (old slice/non-2-gen
version of the 3-edge cycle):

R2 U F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U R2

It can be understood as the sequence S&#x27; U2 S U2 conjugated with R2 U
(or &quot;conjugated by&quot; in some literature). And it becomes the final
alg with some cancellations.

By conjugation I mean: if A=(R2 U) and B=(S&#x27; U2 S U2) then the final
alg is A * B * A^(-1) after a bit of cancellation.

Now the B in this case is easy enough to understand. B here is in 
fact
in itself a commutator, and as we know from Group Theory, commutators
tend to fix many indicies in subgroups of (finite) symmetric groups.

A commutator is something of the form x*y*x^(-1)*y^(-1). It is easy 
to
see why this reduces to the identity in commutative algebras (Abelian
groups) and &quot;does nothing&quot;. In &quot;not-so-commutative groups&quot; it is
something that tends to be &quot;close&quot; to &quot;doing nothing&quot;.

A bit of trivia that even we as cubers typically don&#x27;t know:

Although there are 12!*8!*2^11*3^7/2 possible positionsm, it is 
really
901083404981813616 after modding out by rotational isomorphisms. (can
be shown by the Pólya-Burnside lemma)

The group is the semi-direct product of the orientation aspect of the
cube and the permutation aspect. The orientations are isomorphic to
the commutative group (Z_2)^11 &quot;cross&quot; (Z_3)^7. The permutation group
is isomorphic to (A_8 cross A_12) semi-direct product with Z_2.
(I have this memorized since I&#x27;m a math major and get asked this
question A LOT.)

          <div class="email-content">There are two ways of thinking about it.  I for one learned the 
Fridrich method very early into my cubing career—about 6 weeks after I 
first learned how to solve the cube.  I didn&#x27;t think the look at what 
the F2L algorithms did and so I executed the algorithms blindly.  I 
knew if there was a case and I did a certain algorithm, I would get the 
result I wanted.

Blind execution is the key for fast times.   Understanding how the 
algorithms work can enhance what you can do to the cube, but being able 
to react to cases on a cube is necessary for very fast times.

I was in Paris a few weeks ago, too.  My girlfriend and I both cubed
on the metro several times.  However, neither of us did very well. 
Besides the fact that we were worried about missing our stops, there
was the element of the noise, the bumpy ride, and the glaring.  These
added up to some pretty terrible solves.  The glaring bothered me the
most.  I cube in public everywhere in America, and it doesn&#x27;t bother
me nearly as much.  Paris just frightened me, apparently.

I still solve best when cubing in my room or with people I am very
comfortable with.  My average at the Chicago tournament was about 15
seconds slower than my average average at the time.  I blame lack of
sleep and nerves, but I&#x27;m fairly certain it was just nerves.  Oh well.
 I suppose I&#x27;ll see in November...

There are two ways of thinking about it.  I for one learned the
Fridrich method very early into my cubing careerï¿½about 6 weeks after I
first learned how to solve the cube.  I didn&#x27;t think the look at what
the F2L algorithms did and so I executed the algorithms blindly.  I
knew if there was a case and I did a certain algorithm, I would get the
result I wanted.

Blind execution is the key for fast times.   Understanding how the
algorithms work can enhance what you can do to the cube, but being able
to react to cases on a cube is necessary for very fast times.

Too true.  I devised a high proportion of the sequences I use... I slow 
right down in a number of cases where the method of construction is 
still obvious to me -- conjugates where there was little or no 
cancellation of turns, and where there are several cases that differ 
only in the short &quot;conjugating&quot; sequence.  Hard to know what to do 
about it, apart from finding alternative -- 
preferably &quot;incomprehensible&quot; ;) -- sequences.

If in addition you regard a position as being equivalent to its inverse 
(give or take a rotation or reflection), the number is reduced to 
450541810590509978, which can also be obtained using Burside&#x27;s lemma.

          <div class="email-content">If one memorizes the algorithms well enough, they would know it well 
enough to execute it one-handed.

I know that for me, after spending so much time on algs... 
forgetting an alg and having to re-learn it repeatedly over the 
years, I can easily call out an alg letter-by-letter without 
touching the cube if I see a certain case for about 1/2 of my algs.

I remember Ron was saying how he know&#x27;s his algs so well that he 
doesn&#x27;t get &quot;one-handed amnesia&quot; (as ChrisH calles it) as much as 
most of us do.

So I don&#x27;t think understanding algs would help with one-handed times 
either unfortunately. It&#x27;s all down to practicing the same alg over 
and over one-handed until you can do most of your algs one-handed 
(nearly) as fluidly as with two hands.


I just wanted to explain for people that haven&#x27;t heard about how 
back in the old days before we could so readily plug cases into 
something like ACube, how cubist used to discover new algs for their 
systems. The use of commutators was something that JessicaF fondly 
remembers I&#x27;m sure (I think that&#x27;s where I first read about it from).

In fact I am currently up at 4:44am &quot;understanding&quot; various ZBF2L 
algs I have been learning. (After lying awake in bed for an hr... 
and realizing that today is going to be the first day of classes 
here.)

Now, I believe that understanding algs is unavoidable as a cuber 
continues to learn new algs. This past few months I have begun to 
gain significant insight into the algs I use more so than ever 
before. It defiantely doesn&#x27;t help my times of course; actually, it 
might have even hurt them, lol. After a certain point algs 
just &quot;make sense&quot;.

I&#x27;m talking about when a person learns hundreds of algs; probably 
around 2-3 times as many algs as in the basic Fridrich system (and 
now thanks the great devotion of cubers nowadays, messily even).

Unless one has some super-human (long-term) memory going on, I don&#x27;t 
see how to maintain all that information without 
realizing/understanding what&#x27;s really going on amongst the algs... 
how they inter-relate to each other. I look at a new ZBLL and 
execute it a few times and think to myself how it&#x27;s the first part 
of alg A (some irreducible alg I know) combined with the last part 
of alg B (another simple alg I already know). And this is how I 
remember it... and learning new algs just builds on top of older 
algs.

For a lot of the simple algs I know, I understand how they work and 
so it is reasonable how combining one alg with another would behave. 
And after a while the pace of absorbing more algs becomes faster. A 
lot of us are very amazing and impressed with how many algs some of 
the cubers have learned I&#x27;m sure. But consider this. Isn&#x27;t it now 
many times easier for them to learn one new alg in a given amount of 
time than for a cuber that only knows say the algs of the basic 
Fridrich system alone?

Learning *and understanding* new algs is so fun! Right now I&#x27;m 
drawing a bunch of arrows on my ZBF2L diagram depicting how one cae 
reduces down to another after only a few turns (typically 3). 
(Imagine the sq-1 shapes diagram on Jaap&#x27;s site, lol.)

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m pretty sure he does 2 at a time through out all solves... unless 
of course there is some special cases he encounters. He has tried 
doing it many ways and find this to be best for his style.

I&#x27;m sure it would be differenet for differnt people, but it never 
hurts to learn new methodology even if you don&#x27;t end up using it. 
(Well, remember a WC is comming up though... so scratch the word 
never, lol.)

Personally I do 6-4-2 a lot or even better get 5 in some way first 
and then the last 7 at once. Somestimes I get lucky and do 7 at once 
first. I know how to take care of many of the special cases that 
force some cubers to be &quot;stuck&quot;, so for me it&#x27;s pretty safe. Where I 
lack is finding pieces, and that really slows down my times. But 
until my recognition gets to a certain point where doing 2 at a time 
is faster than the 6-4-2 or 6-3-3 I am used to, I see no reason to 
stop. Besides doing a 6 if FUN!

Then again I&#x27;m sick and preverse.... I slow down to use ZB stuff on 
my big cubes solves. I fell like it takes me so much longer to make 
a turn on the larger cubes that it is worth saving turns this way.

I&#x27;m only half-way through it, I&#x27;ll have to finish it tommorow though.

Curious though, was this research for any academic purpose, it 
sounds like the writer is a fellow math person.

Just goes to show you, there&#x27;s a lot of undiscovered math beind the 
cube still (that article was submitted mid-June of this year). 
Hopefully enough uncharted territory in the cube for a thesis topic 
in the future :). Eh... and if not, there&#x27;s always the tried and

I&#x27;m a solid-state physicist, so the only connection with &quot;real&quot; work 
was noticing that the concept of &quot;magnetic symmetry&quot; of crystals could 
also be applied to the Cube.  

Glad you find it interesting. :)

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,

    No Idea what you&#x27;re talking about, but thanks for taking the time to explain it. Guess I&#x27;ll just be like most cubers who only memorizes and execute the algorithms

Subject: Re: Understanding Algorithms

I think most cubers don&#x27;t understand the algorithms they use but just 
memorize them and execute them accordingly.

But if you spend enough time thinking about an algorithm, then one may 
gain insite into how they actaully work, why they do what they do.

Most algs we use are quite complicated and can&#x27;t be disected into 
small parts that are understandable.

Here is an example of one of the simplest PLL that I&#x27;m sure most ppl 
understand. The so-called &quot;Allan&quot; maneuver (old slice/non-2-gen 
version of the 3-edge cycle):

R2 U F B&#x27; R2 F&#x27; B U R2

It can be understood as the sequence S&#x27; U2 S U2 conjugated with R2 U 
(or &quot;conjugated with&quot; in some literature). And it becomes the final 
alg with some cancellations.

By conjugation I mean: if A=(R2 U) and B=(S&#x27; U2 S U2) then the final 
alg is A * B * A^(-1) after a bit of cancellation.

Now the B in this case is easy enough to understand. B here is in fact 
in itself a commutator, and as we know from Group Theory, commutators 
tend to fix many indicies in subgroups of (finite) symmetric groups.

A commutator is something of the form x*y*x^(-1)*y^(-1). It is easy to 
see why this reduces to the identity in commutative algebras (Abelian 
groups) and &quot;does nothing&quot;. In &quot;not-so-commutative groups&quot; it is 
something that tends to be &quot;close&quot; to &quot;doing nothing&quot;.

A bit of trivia that even we as cubers typically don&#x27;t know:

Although there are 12!*8!*2^11*3^7/2 possible positionsm, it is really 
901083404981813616 after modding out by rotational isomorphisms. (can 
be shown by the Pólya-Burnside lemma)

The group is the semi-direct product of the orientation aspect of the 
cube and the permutation aspect. The orientations are isomorphic to 
the commutative group (Z_2)^11 &quot;cross&quot; (Z_3)^7. The permutation group 
is isomorphic to (A_8 cross A_12) semi-direct product with Z_2.
(I have this memorized since I&#x27;m a math major and get asked this 
question A LOT.)

          <div class="email-content">Some algorithms are pretty basic and can be broken down into small
simple steps.  Understanding simple algs can help you learn them
better and also helps you learn more of them.  If you notice why some
algs work, you can come up with more of them for similar cases.  For
example, a lot of OLL algs involve taking out a pair, flipping stuff,
and putting the pair back differently in the same spot.  Some of them
hide a bunch of pieces, flip stuff, and then put the pieces back.  I
think this is what is meant by &quot;understanding&quot; algorithms.  At least,
it is how I interpret it.

You can just tell the judge when u are ready with ur preinspection. 
There is no need to spend all those 15 secs. And the judge should let 
you proceed with the solving as soon as you say you are done with the 
preinspection :-)

Cheers!

But since you asked. I would say U, Z, T, V, Y in that order. Oh and

          <div class="email-content">Why, V and R are very much so my favorite algorithms (R then V)
Followed by Y and N.

If you do V with the right cube rotations, then it becomes almost the
same thing twice in a row (doing that just looks impressive)

I do R differently than most people. If you look through the list of
all 1211 POLL the guy gives about 12 different algs for each of the
PLL.  If you hate an alg, check it out.

Y is just fun if you hold onto the right face for the first couple of R2.

N is one of those where you do the same thing twice. It&#x27;s pretty fun
to do.

R - RU&#x27; R&#x27;U&#x27; RURD R&#x27;U&#x27;RD&#x27;R&#x27;U2R&#x27;U&#x27;

N (2.5 sec)

The algs I use are of course on my website (though I don&#x27;t list all of
the edge-cycles I use yet and sometimes I use mirrors of algs on there
or something).

Hey Pedro,
     Can you elaborate on this?  As in, how fast you can perform the 
R,G, and Y algs, and which algs you use?  This would be much 
appreciated- 
thanks!

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m very happy as now I am 100% convinced that sub-60 is possible <br>
for an average of 10 on the 4x4x4.<br>
<br>
Today I did an average and got two sub-60 parity times, with the OLL <br>
parity (the 15 move to fix one!).<br>
<br>
63.92 (55.04) 66.58 65.54 62.02 67.21 67.78 56.47 (76.89) 70.04<br>
61.86 57.52 = 63.89<br>
<br>
Both the 56.47 and the 57.52 were with the OLL parity, and I was <br>
still able to end with a sub-60 time.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve noticed that even though the 3x3x3 step is the most important, <br>
since it is after all the entire purpose of solving with centers <br>
first, that my fastest solves are when I really concentrate and <br>
blaze through the edges step.<br>
<br>
I think I am getting faster at my centers, but I know for a fact <br>
that I don&#x27;t average as fast as Stefan Pochmann and his average for <br>
the 4x4 centers on speedcubing.com.  So I think I still need to <br>
improve my centers too.<br>
<br>
Anyway what I am trying to say is that even with a slower centers <br>
step, and a not the fastest 3x3x3 no-inspection step, I think sub-60 <br>
is possible.<br>
<br>
So I think this barrier is only in our heads, and that soon a LOT of <br>
people will break it.  You don&#x27;t need perfect steps to do it, just <br>
concentration and practice.<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s get past this stupid barrier and see what the limits are for <br>
the 4x4x4!<br>

Just remember that A) it&#x27;s only my record average and real average is 
more like 15-16 and B) Olivier is faster so next time you should 
mention him instead of me :-)

Did you measure center solving recently?

I remember a while back Lars Vandenbergh did an analysis of all the <br>
possible cross solves for the 3x3x3 (or at least I think it was Lars) <br>
and found that no case takes more than 8 moves.<br>
<br>
I was wondering how can I go about doing the same type of analysis for <br>
solving the first two opposite centers of a 4x4x4?<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d like to know the maximum number of moves it takes to solve two <br>
opposite centers (I don&#x27;t care about any other pieces), and also maybe <br>
an average # too.<br>

I guess my question is how exactly should I approach this problem?<br>

The first BLD solve is always great. I almost jumped from my bed after
i got it:)
Anyway good luck with beatig all those u mentioned:)

          <div class="email-content">This problem doesn&#x27;t sound too difficult for a computer to run a 
brute force search for.

Make a structure that only stores the center sticker colors and 
manipulates them accordingly; the key is to exploit as many of the 
cube symmetries as possible.

As an experienced 4x4 solver yourself, you could probably provide a 
very reliable &quot;branch and bound&quot; for it.

I must refine it to two different questions here:

1. Suppose we specify the opposite sides to be solved first.
2. We don&#x27;t specify this and take the best possible opposite center 
pair.

In the second question we would certainly get a smaller number 
(eh... or equal I guess).

Oh and a third (dumber) question is if we specify one color *then* 
it&#x27;s opposite. But this would create much bigger numbers, though I&#x27;m 
sure still better than humans who do not use any optimizations for 
symmutaneously achiving progrress on both sides.

*Even I* can write a very quick and dirty program to give the answer 
to question 1 (if I had the time). Just to indicate how routine 
something like that would be for CS ppl. Now question 2 at first 
sight seems (at least to me) to be highly non-trivial, though I 
would assume to still be attainable using todays processor speeds.

The more interesting number would be the answer to question 2, and 
the success of the program (running in reasonable time) I would 
think is totally reliant on exploiting cube symmetries.

*By number I really mean numbers, since the program really would 
generate something like a chart for the number of positions at 
each &quot;distance&quot; to the identity. And though you would think there 
would be multiple identities, you would start by fixing one center 
as the piece that &quot;never moves&quot;... i.e. since doing (R) is some how 
the same as doing (Llr&#x27;) for our purposes, it would suffice to have 
the mappings: &lt;L,r,R,B,f,F,u,d,D> and fix the center piece on ULB 
quadrant that points up.

keep up the good work. So is ZB helping as much as you thought it

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

It will always be the centers located between the middle center and 
a corner-piece that will break. I have never heard of centers 
between the middle center and a middle edge breaking. Of course this 
might happen, but never heard of it. If u are serious about 5x5x5 
cubing you better have a spare cube u can take pieces from. One 
extra cube is 24 of those centers that are likely to break ;-) This 
should last a few yrs. By that time u probably need to retire ur 
current cube anyway :-o

Have fun!

Hello all:
 
I am David Weinstein, and am heading up the Canadian PR initiative to promote the 25th Anniversary of the Cube, and the upcoming World Championships.
 
As part of our promotion of the Championships, we are looking for Cube Enthusiasts who would be willing to demo their skills with the Canadian media (on TV Shows; with print journalists &amp; photographers; and even with radio hosts).
 
Ideally we&#x27;d like to have Cubists from the following Canadian centers:
 

1.	Halifax, NS 
2.	Montreal, QC 
3.	Ottawa, ON 
4.	Toronto, ON 
5.	London, ON 
6.	Winnipeg. MB 
7.	Regina/Saskatoon, SK 
8.	Edmonton. AB 
9.	Calgary, AB 
10.	Vancouver, BC 
11.	Other communities in BC

If you can please reply and confirm your willingness to be profiled as a &quot;local participant going the the championships&quot; we will do our very best to secure some interviews for you, and ensure you are briefed prior to your interviews.  
 
Please let me be clear on one point:  We are not asking you to be a spokesperson for the Cube - rather we&#x27;d like you to share your enthusiasm and cubing skills with the media - who will in turn profile you as a local resident who is going off the the Championships to represent your city/province/ and our country.
 
Typically these interviews happen in-studio (TV / Radio); in-person - meeting with either a TV/Radio or Print journalist at a coffee shop or wherever is mutually convenient; or over the phone.
 
If you are interested in being profiled please reply to this email and let me know the following:
 

1.	Who you are (Name) 
2.	Your phone and email address 
3.	What Canadian city you live in (or near) 
4.	Your experience level 
5.	Your area of cube expertise 
6.	and any confines that we might have to take into consideration to schedule your interviews 

We look forward to hearing from you, and making you famous in your community and across Canada!
 
Standing by and best regards, 
 
David Weinstein

As far as I know, at least Ron, Ton and Bob are coming to Essen 
(Germany) to organize the German Nationals on Saturday. Afterwards 
we&#x27;ll drive to Eindhoven (where we&#x27;ll stay in a hotel). So yes, we&#x27;ll 
meet on Saturday already. I just don&#x27;t know the exact schedule, but 
have a look at the schedule for the German Nationals to get some idea.

Cheers!
Stefan

Fellow Canadians, I just got off the phone with David Weinstein, and 
he is very enthusiastic about helping the cubing community. This is 
a great opportunity for us to have a shot at the Canadian Media to 
help promote our interest here in Canada.  If you are skeptical 
about this, it is very legitimate and I encourage you to follow up.  
When he says reply, he means to his email not this group.  His email 
is davidw [at] strategicobjectives.com (the group hides it).

Drop a note here as well so the other Canadians know what is going 
on as well. 

-Dave (different Dave!)

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Canadians Going to the RUBIK&#x27;S Games Championships?



  Hello all:

  I am David Weinstein, and am heading up the Canadian PR initiative to promote the 25th Anniversary of the Cube, and the upcoming World Championships.

  As part of our promotion of the Championships, we are looking for Cube Enthusiasts who would be willing to demo their skills with the Canadian media (on TV Shows; with print journalists &amp; photographers; and even with radio hosts).

  Ideally we&#x27;d like to have Cubists from the following Canadian centers:


  1.      Halifax, NS 
  2.      Montreal, QC 
  3.      Ottawa, ON 
  4.      Toronto, ON 
  5.      London, ON 
  6.      Winnipeg. MB 
  7.      Regina/Saskatoon, SK 
  8.      Edmonton. AB 
  9.      Calgary, AB 
  10.      Vancouver, BC 
  11.      Other communities in BC

  If you can please reply and confirm your willingness to be profiled as a &quot;local participant going the the championships&quot; we will do our very best to secure some interviews for you, and ensure you are briefed prior to your interviews.  

  Please let me be clear on one point:  We are not asking you to be a spokesperson for the Cube - rather we&#x27;d like you to share your enthusiasm and cubing skills with the media - who will in turn profile you as a local resident who is going off the the Championships to represent your city/province/ and our country.

  Typically these interviews happen in-studio (TV / Radio); in-person - meeting with either a TV/Radio or Print journalist at a coffee shop or wherever is mutually convenient; or over the phone.

  If you are interested in being profiled please reply to this email and let me know the following:


  1.      Who you are (Name) 
  2.      Your phone and email address 
  3.      What Canadian city you live in (or near) 
  4.      Your experience level 
  5.      Your area of cube expertise 
  6.      and any confines that we might have to take into consideration to schedule your interviews 

  We look forward to hearing from you, and making you famous in your community and across Canada!

  Standing by and best regards, 

  David Weinstein

I know. i have similar experiences. I suppose everyone is tired or 
just want to get home so bad that they dont care... Which is too 
bad, because at first the teachers think the cube is cool, but after 
a while they get mad at me for even bringing the cube into the 
classroom... so basically the only times to cube are at lunch, on 
the bus, and at PE (i havent made that teacher mad yet ;)

are already terrible...

I&#x27;ve found the same thing: these are the only stickers that haven&#x27;t 
chipped on my Studio cube (though the orange darkened after exposure to 
strong sunlight).  However, on other puzzles (not only Rubik&#x27;s) I&#x27;ve 
had problems with the orange stickers -- either poor adhesion or rapid 
wear.  There must be a good reason for it...

          <div class="email-content">Dear All.
I can also verify that David is the PR guru for Canada, it was David 
and his team that managed to get the fantastic coverage in Toronto.
 
Looking forward to November and off to Sweden for the competition 
this weekend. Will take some photos.

Dave (yet another one!)

Nah, He&#x27;d be too busy to notice the stickers.  Doesn&#x27;t even answer 
prayers these days... still working on His algorithm, I&#x27;d say.

  Hello all:

  I am David Weinstein, and am heading up the Canadian PR initiative to promote the 25th Anniversary of the Cube, and the upcoming World Championships.

  As part of our promotion of the Championships, we are looking for Cube Enthusiasts who would be willing to demo their skills with the Canadian media (on TV Shows; with print journalists &amp; photographers; and even with radio hosts).

  Ideally we&#x27;d like to have Cubists from the following Canadian centers:


  1.      Halifax, NS 
  2.      Montreal, QC 
  3.      Ottawa, ON 
  4.      Toronto, ON 
  5.      London, ON 
  6.      Winnipeg. MB 
  7.      Regina/Saskatoon, SK 
  8.      Edmonton. AB 
  9.      Calgary, AB 
  10.      Vancouver, BC 
  11.      Other communities in BC

  If you can please reply and confirm your willingness to be profiled as a &quot;local participant going the the championships&quot; we will do our very best to secure some interviews for you, and ensure you are briefed prior to your interviews.  

  Please let me be clear on one point:  We are not asking you to be a spokesperson for the Cube - rather we&#x27;d like you to share your enthusiasm and cubing skills with the media - who will in turn profile you as a local resident who is going off the the Championships to represent your city/province/ and our country.

  Typically these interviews happen in-studio (TV / Radio); in-person - meeting with either a TV/Radio or Print journalist at a coffee shop or wherever is mutually convenient; or over the phone.

  If you are interested in being profiled please reply to this email and let me know the following:


  1.      Who you are (Name) 
  2.      Your phone and email address

I just discovered why God can be a bit slow answering prayers right 
now.  Apparently He has been swamped by grovelling e-mails addressed to 
god@....  If you need proof (shurely not), take a look at

http://heaven.com/prayer/

You can send your e-mail to jesus@... if you prefer, or even use 
the on-line submission form.  It&#x27;s free!!!  I&#x27;m going to try it right 
now...

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,<br>
  I just had my backup hard drive tank and I lost a ton of stuff (none<br>
of it important).  One of the things I&#x27;m now looking for is a catchy<br>
little song about the cube.  I&#x27;ve only ever heard of 3 songs<br>
specifically about the cube, and I can only remember the name and<br>
singer of one:<br>
<br>
Baron Knights - &quot;Mr. Rubik&quot;<br>
<br>
Luckily, I remember a lot of lyrics from the other two, so I&#x27;ll post<br>
em and see if anyone else can tell me who sang them or where to find them.<br>
<br>
The first I stumbled across on the internet one day and goes something<br>
like:<br>
<br>
 I&#x27;ve never peeled off the stickers,<br>
 Taken apart the pieces,<br>
 Or purchased any books with the solution.<br>
 But I&#x27;m gonna get that bottom line<br>
 If it takes all my time,<br>
 Cause I don&#x27;t want to add to next year&#x27;s resolutions.<br>
 Whether by skill or by luck,<br>
 There&#x27;s no choice but to mix it back up.<br>
<br>
 Where will I be when old Rubik&#x27;s stops challenging me.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s longer than that and maybe not in the right order, but you get<br>
the jist.  Anyway, it was actually a catchy melody and I really liked<br>
it! So any help finding it would be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
The last song I first heard during Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Premium Blend&quot; a<br>
few years back.  I&#x27;m pretty sure he was the last performer to go on. <br>
It was more silly (like the Baron Knights song) but still not bad.<br>
Anyway, here&#x27;s what I remember of it:<br>
<br>
 Hello operator can you get me Hungry?<br>
 I&#x27;ve got to talk to Erno Rubik &#x27;bout this problem you see.<br>
 ...<br>
 (chorus)<br>
 Rubik&#x27;s cube, it&#x27;s driving me crazy!<br>
 I&#x27;m about to peal the stickers off<br>
 &#x27;Cause I&#x27;m too stupid and lazy.<br>
<br>
Sorry, that was a loooong time ago that I heard that so I don&#x27;t<br>
remember very much of it.<br>
<br>
At any rate, those are the only cube songs I know about (though lots<br>
actually mention the cube without being about it!)  So if you guys<br>
have any more or know which these are, I&#x27;d appreciate it!<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

It was the Barron Knights, but I never heard that song, or any other 
song about cubing for that matter.  Some of the lyrics can be found 
here:

Good luck with the hunt.

   Why is Fridrich the most popular method when all I seem to hear about is that the Waterman method is the most efficient. Is this like a what came first question: Chicken/Egg?

have no idea who Mark Waterman is and the only thing I know about his <br>

doesn&#x27;t seem there is anything on the internet to teach these things.<br>

Can someone direct me to the &quot;Waterman&quot; method?  I am relatively new to <br>
cubing so as far as I know, it&#x27;s just a myth... kinda like Loch Ness <br>
and the Yeti.  These legendary things but why should I believe it if I <br>
haven&#x27;t seen it?<br>

Yeah, i have a 4x4 not verry used that i lended out to a friend, and 
when it came back 2 of the orange pices are instead white, but since 
it was scrambled i didnt notice, so while solving it i couldnt find 
a pice, so i scolded my friend and got mad at him because i thought 
he had swapped the stickers, ooops... :) there is a thin layer on 
the orange sticker pice that peels off to easily, the whole sticker 
doesnt peel....

Loch Ness isn&#x27;t a myth. Here&#x27;s a picture of it:

http://www.scotland-flavour.co.uk/highlands_pictures/highlands_loch_ness_0136.jpg

It&#x27;s almost 1000 feet deep and is 24 miles long so it could hardly be described as a myth.
I&#x27;ve been there before.

An interesting quote from this site:

&quot;We tried to do 41 cubes in less then 15 minutes, we nearly succeeded!


In this period I met Anneke Treep and entered CFF (Cubism For Fun, the Dutch cube 
association). I did contests with Guus Razoux-Schultz at his home, and won most times. 
We practised together very often, we learned each others method. We even did contests, 
using each others method, and became as fast as 40 seconds!&quot;

40 seconds was obviously a time to get excited about (even if it was a different method 
would they be so happy if they were much faster using their own methods) so a very good 
time for 41 cubes would be 41*40 seconds = 1640 seconds which is 27 minutes 20 
seconds.

Could it be that they tried to solve 41 cubes between them (i.e. about 20.5 cubes each)?  
That would then be 13 minutes 40 (on a very good time)  so allowing for less good times 
and tiredness setting in 15 minutes could be still a good time.

Or could it be that 40 seconds with a different method seemed extraordinary (in which 
case, what time would be realistic from their own methods)?

It doesn&#x27;t seem to add up to me.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m pretty sure he meant the monster that&#x27;s supposed to live in there. 
You know, the thing that&#x27;s greenish-brownish, that throws boats to the 
ground, only comes out when it&#x27;s foggy and most importantly, is between 
50 and 300 feet long depending on the witness and the quantity of 
guiness left in the glass in front of him. And it IS a myth. No monster 
in there.

<br>
I have discovered that the third song I mention is called &quot;This<br>
Rubik&#x27;s Cube is Driving me Crazy!&quot; by Crazy Davis.  Crazy Davis is the<br>
alter ego of Eric Drysdale who write&#x27;s for Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Daily<br>
Show&quot;   -- a fantastic show IMHO.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have gone to his website and e-mailed him directly asking if<br>
I could have a copy of the song and if I could post it to the group. <br>
There is VERY little information about this song on the internet.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m still hunting for the other song though, and thanks guys who<br>
directed me to the song by The Barron Knights!  I know have 1/3 recovered!<br>

The booklet explicitly says Mark averaged 18 seconds. But first I was

of it online.  Josef Jelinek made a site that explicitly demonstrates <br>
the method in full detail and recently had Waterman&#x27;s permission to <br>
have it fully published on the www.rubiks.info site.  A few people I <br>
know in here are learning/use it (Josef himself, Mike Atkinson...).  <br>
Not sure if some of them gave it up or not, but I think it has <br>
something to do with (or a variation of) David Allen&#x27;s method back in <br>

          <div class="email-content">OK, sorry to spam the boards guys but I this was driving me crazy. <br>
Last post on the subject, I promise!  I&#x27;ve been searching all day and<br>
finally found out every thing I need to know.<br>
<br>
Song 1 - You folks were kind enough to point me to a download of &quot;Mr.<br>
Rubik&quot; By The Barron Knights.  That was the easy one!<br>
<br>
Song 2 - After much searching, the secret lies in post number 2715 of<br>
our very own group.  The song is &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot; by the Amateur Lovers<br>
off the 1997 album Virgin White Lies.  I posted it on www.putfile.com<br>
, which I&#x27;ve never used before so let me know if it works:<br>
http://media.putfile.com/RubiksCube26  It&#x27;s a fantastic song, and<br>
there were many responses to the original post about it.  Odd that<br>
none of us remembered them.<br>
<br>
Song 3 - &quot;This Rubik&#x27;s Cube is Driving me Crazy!&quot; - Eric Drysdale<br>
Originally aired on Comedy Central&#x27;s Premium Blend episode 307 and (I<br>
think) can be found on Comic Remix episode 116.  I&#x27;ll have to keep an<br>
eye out on the comedy central tv listings, and see if Mr. Drysdale<br>
responds to my request.  I&#x27;d like to have a copy of it.<br>
<br>
Other songs I found during the search:<br>
&quot;Your Cat Can do the Cube&quot; - Ronnie Allen &amp; the Missing Pieces from<br>
The Dr. Demento Show #82-41 - 10/10/82<br>
<br>
&quot;I can&#x27;t do The Cube&quot; - Ronnie Allen &amp; the Missing Pieces<br>
<br>
&quot;The Cube&quot; - Bob Jenkins<br>
<br>
&quot;Cubic Refugee&quot; - Stevens &amp; Grdnic (not a typo) from The Dr. Demento<br>
Show #82-22 - May 30, 1982<br>
<br>
I have been unable to find copies of any of these yet, though I do<br>
have partial lyrics for some.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help, and I&#x27;m happy I can finally sleep!<br>

Well, I just sent a polite request for the length of His algorithm (HTM 
and QTM -- heck, I hope he doesn&#x27;t prefer SQTM), but got a screen 
saying that my prayer would be reviewed by a moderator shortly.

A *moderator*.  What&#x27;s that then -- some measly saint?  Some acned 
seraph?

I am bitterly disappointed.  God doesn&#x27;t even read his own e-mail...

Yeah, i have a 4x4 not verry used that i lended out to a friend, and 
when it came back 2 of the orange pices are instead white, but since 
it was scrambled i didnt notice, so while solving it i couldnt find 
a pice, so i scolded my friend and got mad at him because i thought 
he had swapped the stickers, ooops... :) there is a thin layer on 
the orange sticker pice that peels off to easily, the whole sticker 
doesnt peel....

          <div class="email-content">With November rapidly approaching and in light of the recent<br>
achievments of some of the elite, I have some questions about what the<br>
possible limits of 4x4ing are.<br>
<br>
I know most of the top cubers feel that sub-60 is realistically<br>
achievable.  I&#x27;m curious what they feel the fastest possible average<br>
will be.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m also curious about the current average move counts of the faster<br>
solvers out there for centers first, but also for other systems.  I&#x27;ve<br>
come up with an edges first method that works great for me, and I&#x27;m<br>
curious how it compares.<br>
<br>
With the method I use, a good solve without the hard parity generally<br>
runs about 130 moves.  With the hard parity it&#x27;s about 140.  A good<br>
solve without either parity is around 120 to 125.  Now, my times with<br>
this are still pretty high (2 min. on average), but that works out to<br>
a little over 1 move per second.  I suspect the top solvers are moving<br>
at twice this speed.<br>
<br>
Because it&#x27;s edges first, there are a lot of slice moves.  Probably<br>
many more than a centers first method.  This will perhaps make it<br>
slower overall than centers first, but I wonder how much.  This method<br>
affords excellent look ahead, but is that enough to offset the<br>
possible extra moves and more slice turns?<br>
<br>
Currently, I&#x27;m averaging something like 49-50 seconds for the two<br>
1x3x4 blocks on L and R, around 40-41 for the U layer corners and the<br>
edge pairing and placement, and 34-35 for the centers.  I&#x27;m 100%<br>
certain these times could be much lower with more effort.  I think<br>
more specialized algorithms would help for both the centers stage and<br>
for edge pairing.  I also think I could benefit from learning more<br>
algs for the two centers I begin with.  It often takes me 10 or more<br>
seconds for the first two centers alone.  As I understand it, that&#x27;s<br>
only a little less than it takes some people to solve all 6.<br>
<br>
Another area I think could stand some improvement is the final centers<br>
stage.  I&#x27;m left with 4 centers in the M slice.  I really only use a<br>
few cases to solve everything.  Once I get the hang of solving 3<br>
cycles, though, it should go much faster.  I can&#x27;t seem to find the<br>
alg anywhere that swaps 3 opposite center cubies, though.  I know<br>
someone mentioned it in a post on here, but I can&#x27;t find it.<br>
<br>
Based on how efficient my solving currently is, improvement to sub-30<br>
for the first step, 25-30 for the second, and sub-25 for the third<br>
should be easily attainable.  This still comes out to 80-85 seconds,<br>
but that&#x27;s a far cry from my 150 pb with centers first.  I know that<br>
if someone were to put as much effort into this method as some people<br>
are putting into centers first, this could be taken much farther than<br>
I am, but I suppose laziness strikes again...<br>
<br>
Anyway, I guess this wraps up my late night ramble.  Thanks for<br>
reading if you made it this far. ;)  Happy (big) cubing.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m in Honolulu. I too feel marooned with no other cubers or
competition around. I would love to start a Honolulu cube club that
meets once every 3 months for competition and sharing of ideas. But
atlas... people here are more interested in surfing and hula. Being 13
is a good thing and not a problem! Those were the good ol&#x27; days for
many other reasons. When I was in junior high I knew only one other
kid that could solve the cube. When I was in high school, I was the
only cubist. :(

Aloha!

You can be sub-15 with a method like Waterman&#x27;s.
I think nobody knows all the sequences described in this method.

          <div class="email-content">I havent checked this out but it seems to me that the number of seconds to 
be really world class to solve a cube is around about (maybe a bit less 
than!)  the number of cubies in that cube.  That would mean under 20 seconds 
for 3x3x3, 56 seconds for 4x4x4 and 1 minute 32 seconds for 5x5x5.  Just a 
rule of thumb and I dont actually know what good times for 5x5x5 are - I 
suspect that they aren&#x27;t quite that fast - yet!  Anyway one cubie per second 
solving sounds like a reasonable goal.  Maybe it gives us a target for the 
6x6x6 too.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Gilles, I am nobody according to your opinion? :-)
Well, I know all the algs of the method, however, I know just optimal 
ones (in UMR group, generated by ACube); the original method contains 
some algs that are longer (all found &#x27;manually&#x27; by Marc, Daan, and 
some others).
The point is that unlike Fridrich and similar methods, the sequences 
can be learned by understanding what is to be accomplished. Knowing 
background of the last step of the Gilles&#x27;s method may help in this.
I still have to improve a lot (I average low 20s now - even without 
fingertricks...).
I agree with Gilles, that you can get 15s with this or similar 
method. I saw video of Marc doing 42 cubes bellow 17min with many 
mistakes and some pops and obviously crap stiff cubes. He used 
absolutely NO fingetricks and M, M&#x27;, M2 doing always like r&#x27;R, rR&#x27;, 
and r2R2...

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

I have been thinking about this for a while without posting about it.
My cage method for 4x4x4 requires about 145-150 moves. And i have 
achieved averages of about 70 secs and lower for that. So that&#x27;s 
slight above 2 moves/sec. The way i see it there are 2 aspects to 
how fast u can solve a twisty puzzle. One is og course the solution 
length. And the other is turning speed. Im a firm believer that 
eventually it&#x27;s the method with higher turning speed that will be 
the best.

In order to achieve high turning speed 2 things are required. Good 
lookahead and predictability of where cubies will end up after an 
algorithm (sequence of moves). Good lookahead leads to shorter 
delays between successive algorithms. Moving only a few pieces by 
each algorithm makes it easier to track cubies and hence makes it 
easier to prepare for next sequence of moves.

I have strong doubts it will be possible to solve 1 cubie/sec for 
larger cubes than 5x5x5. Even for 5x5x5 im not really close to that 
on average. There is too large &quot;search space&quot; as the puzzles go 
larger (have more parts/cubies).

Maybe others have an opinion about this ??

Have fun !!

Fast Fridrich cubers do ~32 turns for F2L (corrent me if I am wrong).
8-9s is 3.5-4 turns/s. I average 16 turns for one layer (always the 
same color). Marc averaged about 6-7s for one face...
After solving remaining corners (2-3s), you can be still bellow 10s and 
you are left with two steps and the last easy middle edge permutation 
which is around 22 turns total...

Yes, it may be better for someone... Everyone can find the best-fitting 
method for himself (maybe even herself? :-)).

When you say 16 moves for one layer do you mean a complete layer oriented 
and positioned correctly - that would be a very useful start for my system! 
I will look around now but any chance of a link where I could find out how 
to do a layer in that few moves?  I can do a layer and two middle edges in 
22 - 24 but 16 sounds good and there may be some good tips for me there.

Hi Dwayne,

   I think that the Fridrich method was the first method to be posted
online which could produce times near 20 seconds, and enthusiastic
cubers like Chris and Ron helped make it popular, and developed it more.

Cheers,

maybe 5-10% if you exclude F2L.  Those aren&#x27;t necessarily algs, unless<br>

I don&#x27;t really count as a speedcuber, but I use my own LBL method, with 
3-look LL.  Mostly my own simple algs.

Sorry, I can&#x27;t quote a percentage: there is more than one way to do the 
counting, and I use some simple conjugates of a couple of the algs -- I 
wouldn&#x27;t know how many times to count those!  But of the ones 
I /didn&#x27;t/ work out myself:

1 sequence was from Singmaster&#x27;s Notes... possibly 2 (it&#x27;s too long ago 
to be sure now)
1 came from Helmstetter&#x27;s tables (but I should be using more)
4 were computed using ACube (but I&#x27;ve only learnt 3 -- the fourth 
covers a fairly rare case)

And yes, I&#x27;m lazy. :)

Mike

We may be able to make it since it is sort of close -
just depends on the when

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

All the stuff i use for any size cube is all mine. I use a pretty 
basic LBL for 3x3x3 and average on average mid to low 20&#x27;s. For 
larger cubes i use sorta LBL also. I call it the cage method: i 
build first layer complete, middle layers edges, last layer corners, 
last layer edges (and parity)and then finally all the remaining 
centers. If i switch to a better f2l or LL for 3x3x3 i will learn 
algs from sites or reinvent them somehow ;-) That would be my 
first &quot;cube-cheating&quot; ;-)

Have fun !!

          <div class="email-content">Hello, I was about to make a post on a neat thread when I realized<br>
that it was a bit old, so here is just some thoughts on blind cubing<br>
that I was going to toss in.<br>
<br>
If any of you have gotten a cube (or megaminx or any other) from<br>
mefert&#x27;s then youve probably seen the neat tiles that he uses instead<br>
of stickers. These have a bunch of little grooves that add a nice<br>
little texture. And, on a perfectly solved cube or minx ect. all the<br>
lines go in one direction (which adds a nice level of difficulty when<br>
you have to acount for center square orientation for all faces of a<br>
3x3x3).  Draw a arrow on your centers and you&#x27;ll get the idea. :)<br>
Any-whoo, Duct-tape, grip tape, vinyl tape, fine grit sanpaper, and<br>
your standard stickers would be all you would need to start getting<br>
used to blind, and maby start texturing 2 or more faces the same once<br>
you wanted to.  Just some thoughts, happy cubing.<br>
Carter.<br>
<br>
<br>
I&#x27;d also LOVE to see some more thoughts on solving when you have to<br>
acount for center face orientation or if there are any cool<br>
observations already known about it.  I got started looking into this<br>
when one of my cubes had the rubiks logo on the white center sticker...<br>
<br>
Have a good one.<br>

*That* would be your first cube cheating, the first time you use work 
of others? How much of your cubes have you built yourself?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Clancy,

Many things were invented by more than one person independently.
Same goes for cross/F2L/OLL/PLL system. Jessica was one of them, but she was 
the first who published the system on internet.
Even the cube itself was invented by more than 1 person. And ZB system.

Because of Jessica (and the fact that it is a very good system and that most 
people copy what is good) the cross/F2L/OLL/PLL system has become so 
popular.

Have fun,

Ron

Please better no links to auctions that aren&#x27;t over yet.
The cube is perfectly alright, nothing unusual about it. Note there&#x27;s 
one front and one back picture.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
Just to clear up a few things.  Bisqwit&#x27;s site should not be taken<br>
seriously as an official world record video game site.  The videos on<br>
Bisqwit&#x27;s site were all done by manipulating emulators to play the<br>
game literally frame by frame, and re-records so that if you mess up<br>
you can just go back and fix it.  Most of the videos on that site took<br>
literally tens of thousands of re-records while playing at super slow<br>
motion.  The purpose of Bisqwit&#x27;s site is to make videos showing a<br>
game being played theoretically to perfection.<br>
<br>
The official site for speed video game accomplishments is<br>
www.speeddemosarchive.com.  www.twingalaxies.com is another one.  The<br>
videos you see here are all 100% legit, played on a real console and<br>
all painstakingly verified as such.  So, if you want to see the TRUE<br>
world records for speed video games, www.speeddemosarchive.com is the<br>
only place.  If you want to see a bunch of low skilled gamers who make<br>
fake videos and try to pass them off as real, legit records, easily<br>
fooling the casual audience, then maybe Bisqwit&#x27;s site is your place.<br>
<br>
I used to be really into speed running video games myself (hence my<br>
user name).  There has long been animosity between Bisqwit&#x27;s site and<br>
the real speed runners, if you couldn&#x27;t tell from my last paragraph<br>
;P.  A run that I highly recommend watching on speeddemosarchive.com<br>
is the Super Mario World 96 exit run.  ;)<br>

Now if i could only slow down my 5x5x5 cubing and shave 20-25% off

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I am interested in stats (using the Fridrich method)<br>
of people in this group:<br>
- how much time does it take you to solve F2L?<br>
- how much time does ik take you to solve the whole cube?<br>
<br>
Same goes for number of moves (when trying to go for<br>
speed, not for minimal number of moves):<br>
- how many moves does it take you to solve F2L?<br>
- how many moves does ik take you to solve the whole cube?<br>
<br>
Please take the average of many cubes (e.g., 30, 50, 100).<br>
<br>
To start, mine are:<br>
F2L 21.34 sec (61.5% of total)<br>
all 34.70 sec<br>
<br>
F2L 32.97 moves (56.0% of total)<br>
all 58.90 moves<br>

<br>
By the way, I&#x27;m one of the few who prefers the Japanese, or white-blue <br>
color scheme.  I guess that&#x27;s b/c the very first cube I had (Ideal <br>
plastic cylinder no less!) was that way.  But also, I tend to want what <br>
I can&#x27;t have.  Back in the 80&#x27;s, virtually all cubes were white-blue.  <br>
I wanted white-yellow to match the TV commercial.  So I rearranged the <br>
stickers, ruining a few in the process.<br>
<br>
Now that white-yellow is all that&#x27;s available in the US, I want white-<br>
blue.  So I rearranged the stickers, ruining a few in the <br>
process...Wish they&#x27;d just offer both at the same time.<br>

Any other white-blue fans (outside Japan)?<br>

Is there such a rule?  There is one at the twistypuzzles.com, but I 
don&#x27;t see why we should respect that convention here.

Unless that was from a small sample, I don&#x27;t think you can be using 
full Fridrich.  Or do you make a lot of unnecessary AUFs during the LL?

Can&#x27;t give my own stats -- non-Fridrich, and I can&#x27;t &quot;speed&quot;-solve and 
count turns at the same time. I could probably chew gum, though. :D

You&#x27;re telling me.  The levels, other than the first few, didn&#x27;t seem<br>
to follow any progression of difficulty.  I had more trouble on a lot<br>
of the teens levels than the later ones.  Most of the twenties ones I<br>
made it through in around 25 moves.  I was sort of let down when it<br>
was over.  I want more.<br>

30 - the last one is like a chess board but you have to get the colours past each other. I 
think level 3 was the one that had me thinking most.

Just in case somebody doesn&#x27;t know that one and is interested, here it 
is:
http://www.twistypuzzles.com/forumrules.shtml
(and see item 3)

The explanation for the rule makes sense to me, that&#x27;s why I myself 
try to respect it here as well. If you link to an active auction then 
probably you&#x27;re not interested in buying the item yourself (or you&#x27;re 
rich, but I think we can ignore this case). So what&#x27;s the point in 
showing everybody and annoying/upsetting the people who are interested 
and have found it already? If there&#x27;s something interesting in it and 
you&#x27;d like to talk about it, why not simply wait until it&#x27;s over?

Not seen anything like that before.  Some of them were rather neat, but 
why did I waste time doing all 30?  Oh dearie, dearie dear...

          <div class="email-content">Very similar to my method.  I do OC then OE...a throwback to James

hardest one for me to learn was Fridrich&#x27;s &quot;G&quot; which I like to call 
the &quot;Flag&quot;.

Anyways I don&#x27;t have my precise stats but I&#x27;m probably about 40 moves 
for the F2L and 65 for the cube.  My F2L is very high for two 
reasons, 1) I suck at the cross and 2) I cannot recognize F2L 
patterns to save my life, so I make a ton of extra U-turns.  If I 
want to align the red-white-green corner and red-green edge, for 
example, I have to move that corner between the red and green sides 
or I cannot see how to do it.

Timewise I&#x27;m averaging about 30-32s for the F2L and 50-52s for the 
whole cube.

Never seen one but I can&#x27;t see any problem in solving one. 20x20x20 is pretty easy. 
Supercube wouldn&#x27;t make things much more difficult.

Richard Carr hasn&#x27;t solved a 20x20x20 supercube - only a 20x20x20 cube.

Marked centres - so the centres have do go in the correct place. I&#x27;m not aware of any site 
that does nxnxn supercubes.

In that link above, Chris talks about the fact that because the centres can be mixed up in 
lots of ways there are a few solutions to the 20x20x20. The supercube would have only 
one solution - that&#x27;s the essential difference.

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,

Today I completed the 20x20 super cube.  Which was an ambitious 
attempt, considering; 1) the biggest super cube I&#x27;ve solved is a 3x3, 
and 2) the biggest normal cube I&#x27;ve solved is a 10x10.

By far the most difficult thing for me was solving the 6th center.  I 
didn&#x27;t know how to 3 cycle centers.  With help from Chris and Per I was 
able to figure this out.

Total solving time:  19 hours 37 minutes

I lost a lot of time due to mistakes, but without errors I wouldn&#x27;t 
have done much better than 10 hours anyway.  I had always wanted to 
solve the 20x20, so it just made sense to me to &quot;go for the gold&quot;.

Details and screenshots soon to come on my website!  Keep an eye out :)

Happy Cubing!

<br>
Alright, Well, let me bring you all up to speed.<br>
<br>
A supercube is a cube in which each piece must be properly oriented in<br>
its proper spot, not just any random spot for multiple pieces(such as<br>
on a 5x5 the X and + pieces can be switched around on a regular cube,<br>
but on a supercube they must be in a certain place)<br>
<br>
Before Gabbasoft, there was no computer software that would produce a<br>
20x20x20 supercube, and few that would produce a regular.<br>
<br>
Chris Hardwick has only solved a regular 20x20x20, not the supercube,<br>
though I am sure that he will at some point attempt the supercube, the<br>
crazy monster that he is...<br>
<br>
There are only 7 people on speedcubing.com who have solved a 20x20x20.<br>
<br>
Richard Patterson has just become the first person to solve the<br>
20x20x20 Supercube, with a time of 19 hours 37 minutes.  I would like<br>
to congratulate him as this is an amazing feat...This was not done all<br>
in one sitting, but in total...If you want any details about the<br>
solve, please ask him, not me.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hem the rate of posts seem to have sped back up again.

If anybody was going to ask this question, I thought it would be you 
(after reading so many posts, I get a good feel for who tends to post 
what types of questions :)).

For those that don&#x27;t know:

I have my own system and started developing it about 6.5 years ago. I 
use it in combination with other methodology though. Depending on the 
inital preinspection I might use GuusR.S. (Fridrich but with CLL/ELL 
instead). I&#x27;ll go for Petrus solves about 3% of the time, and a Gilles 
method solve about 5% of the time... approximately, I really should 
keep track.

I incorporated some ZBF2L algs into my solving (as part of advancing 
the Petrus method). I know a lot of what I would now like to 
call &quot;Akimoto algs&quot; or &quot;Akimoto CLL&quot;, it was something I started doing 
accidently, but was motivated when he pointed it out. It&#x27;s when each 
CLL case becomes a category of up to 8 cases depending on edge flip... 
basically I flip edges while doing CLL. (I&#x27;ve killed off a few 
categories of cases.)

I was doing pure CLL/ELL in the first couple years I was working on my 
system. I don&#x27;t start with a cross NOR with corners NOR with 
a &quot;layer&quot;. I am a bit ashamed that I have yet to publish it.

The algorithms I found using a rather ancient version of ACube (in 
which I took the original C++ code and modifided it a bit). Then after 
I wanted shorter c/e pairing algs I used Ron&#x27;s listing. (But my 
CLL,ELL,COLL are all found either by trial and error or ACube, or 
composing algs I know.)

I guess I&#x27;m holding on to one of the last unpublished *un-
catergorizable* methods... well if you can call the Gilles method and 
Petrus method &quot;block methods&quot; then perhaps so is mine. But is is 
definately not LBL or CF. Though my steps are *strictly* a 
bit &quot;modular&quot;. (something I thought was kinda cool was the uniquneness 
of this, as far as I know)

And I keep (as in actively use) the entire PLL set, 65% of OLLs, all 
the COLLs, ELLs, CLLs, and F2L paring algs a subset of the algs needed 
for this system as it currently stands.

(It is)/(I am) currently moving it two directions, adding more of the 
Lars step 6+7 combinded and ZBF2L. (Though I have decient enough 
partial edge control to make use of the limited ZBLL algs I know.)

It still really helps to have a complete ELL set for backup incase ZB 
stuff goes wrong though.

  Hem the rate of posts seem to have sped back up again.

  If anybody was going to ask this question, I thought it would be you 
  (after reading so many posts, I get a good feel for who tends to post 
  what types of questions :)).

  For those that don&#x27;t know:

  I have my own system and started developing it about 6.5 years ago. I 
  use it in combination with other methodology though. Depending on the 
  inital preinspection I might use GuusR.S. (Fridrich but with CLL/ELL 
  instead). I&#x27;ll go for Petrus solves about 3% of the time, and a Gilles 
  method solve about 5% of the time... approximately, I really should 
  keep track.

  I incorporated some ZBF2L algs into my solving (as part of advancing 
  the Petrus method). I know a lot of what I would now like to 
  call &quot;Akimoto algs&quot; or &quot;Akimoto CLL&quot;, it was something I started doing 
  accidently, but was motivated when he pointed it out. It&#x27;s when each 
  CLL case becomes a category of up to 8 cases depending on edge flip... 
  basically I flip edges while doing CLL. (I&#x27;ve killed off a few 
  categories of cases.)

  I was doing pure CLL/ELL in the first couple years I was working on my 
  system. I don&#x27;t start with a cross NOR with corners NOR with 
  a &quot;layer&quot;. I am a bit ashamed that I have yet to publish it.

  The algorithms I found using a rather ancient version of ACube (in 
  which I took the original C++ code and modifided it a bit). Then after 
  I wanted shorter c/e pairing algs I used Ron&#x27;s listing. (But my 
  CLL,ELL,COLL are all found either by trial and error or ACube, or 
  composing algs I know.)

  I guess I&#x27;m holding on to one of the last unpublished *un-
  catergorizable* methods... well if you can call the Gilles method and 
  Petrus method &quot;block methods&quot; then perhaps so is mine. But is is 
  definately not LBL or CF. Though my steps are *strictly* a 
  bit &quot;modular&quot;. (something I thought was kinda cool was the uniquneness 
  of this, as far as I know)

  And I keep (as in actively use) the entire PLL set, 65% of OLLs, all 
  the COLLs, ELLs, CLLs, and F2L paring algs a subset of the algs needed 
  for this system as it currently stands.

  (It is)/(I am) currently moving it two directions, adding more of the 
  Lars step 6+7 combinded and ZBF2L. (Though I have decient enough 
  partial edge control to make use of the limited ZBLL algs I know.)

  It still really helps to have a complete ELL set for backup incase ZB 
  stuff goes wrong though.

faster.  If it was, I should be able to keep going that fast, but now I 
can&#x27;t get times that fast anymore.

It can&#x27;t be luck, cause I did almost 50 solves at this speed.

And it can&#x27;t be that I was &quot;in the zone&quot; because I got the same kind of 
times 2 hours later for the FC.

And if it was going slow, I should be able to do it again.

But I can&#x27;t.

So I don&#x27;t know what it was making me so much faster, but it&#x27;s really 
bugging me now.

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

There&#x27;s nothing really magic about supercubing (solving supercubes). 
All there is to it is cycling pieces. Once the cube is solved as a 
normal cube then the rest can be done with cycling the centers using 
only 3-cycles. It&#x27;s just that u need to do a heck of lot of them on 
the 20x20x20 cube. Even if u start cleverly by directly solving all 
centers correctly and then do edges and corners without destroying all 
ur centers work :-)

The way to go about it is as i said 3-cycles. U can use 3 cycles 
involving 3 centers on same face or cycles involving centers from 2 
adjacent faces or even 3-cycles involving centers from 3 faces. It&#x27;s 
not too hard work to come up wuth these once one understands the 
principles of commutators and setup moves.

U might end up with having to swap 2 &quot;similar&quot; centers on a face. In 
this case u have the same problem on at least one other face (and 
always an even number of faces). So u only have to do 2 3-cycles 
involving these 2 faces to get those 4 centers in their correct 
places :-) Repeat this approach if u have same problem on more faces 
or other centergroups (orbitals) :-)

There&#x27;s at least ONE more song about the rubiks cube. Or at least i 
suppose it&#x27;s about that since it&#x27;s from mid 80&#x27;s and has the 
following title : &quot;May the Cube be with you&quot;. The song is by Thomas 
Dolby and George Clinton. It&#x27;s from the album &quot;Aliens ate my Buick&quot;. 
Umm .. actually it was released in 1988 ... hehe ;-)

You could slice and use a doublr transpostion instead of 2 3-cycles. That would be faster.

You can remove it from your college account now, i added it to

          <div class="email-content">I know I&#x27;m in the minority here - I prefer white/blue, because it&#x27;s 
what I grew up with, using my Ideal cubes.

But, that&#x27;s the only reason.  White/yellow is a better all-around 
color scheme IMO.  My fastest time ever was on a W/Y cube.  And I 
like to play a weird game with my cube, where I first &quot;half-solve&quot; 
the cube (each side must consist entirely of either that center&#x27;s 
color or the opposite center&#x27;s color), and then I &quot;full-solve&quot; from 
that point.  It is MUCH easier on the eyes to have sides consisting 
of W/Y and B/G, than the other scheme.

Anyways you should try the weird game.  It&#x27;s fun.

I could&#x27;ve made use of that on oinkleburger - I lost a lot of time sometimes 
through accidently moving things in te wrong direction (moving the mouse 
slightly up and to the right and slicing parallel to R instead of D for instance 
but not realizing straightaway what I&#x27;d just done.

It&#x27;s been a long time since I looked at a 5x5x5 - I&#x27;m not sure I could solve one 
now as the strings are long to remember so I can&#x27;t remember the algorithms 
mostly and I can&#x27;t think of the way I meant to do the original problem.

I don&#x27;t  think in terms of commutators (I&#x27;ve never consciously thought that I 
would use a commutator - Ron showed me some time at Schiphol but I 
couldn&#x27;t get my head round it and I forgot about it before I had caught the 
plane - he was too fast!) and I certainly don&#x27;t know the difference between M, 
E and S but for instance this conjugate of a commutator could be used to do 2 
4-cycles (on the F and R faces). (That&#x27;s not exactly what was required but the 
last time I looked at a 5x5x5 was August 2004 and so I can&#x27;t remember all the 
techniques to solve the thing.)

          <div class="email-content">Ummm ...

I thought u had a general easy principle for easily exchanging 2 
centers on a face while also swapping 2 on another face. That should 
have worked also on the 5x5x5 cube...

And now u come with something which is much longer than 2 3-cycles 
and also it&#x27;s not doing what is should do ... :-?

Ok, i will show how easily it&#x27;s done with 2 3-cycles to achieve the 
dual swap ;-) Say u want to swap 1 and 2 on one face and 3 and 4 on 
a second face. U simply make up the following 2 3-cycles :

(1,2,3) and (1,4,3) Those are the cycles relative to locations.

1 1 2 2 (faces)
1 2 3 4 (locations)
=======
2 1 4 3 > do (1,2,3)
4 2 1 3 > do (1,4,3)
1 2 3 4 > done!! (matches locations!)

After first 3-cycle one can see easily which to do next. One of the 
centers is already in it&#x27;s correct location. Maybe i&#x27;ll post a 
specific example and actual move sequences later. But htis should 
give the idea. This shouldn&#x27;t require more than 16 moves in total. 
With possible move cancellation btw the 2 sequences :-)

Yeah, that&#x27;d be great, good luck convincing him it&#x27;ll be the coolest

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

That&#x27;s beautiful for 5x5x5 of course, for some special cases. I can 
imagine some really horrible setup scenarios for the general case :-
o And i can think of many more similar along ur lines of thought. 
But they won&#x27;t really do the trick for the general case on an nxnxn 
cube. 2 3-cycles still rocks IMHO ;-)

OK, i will give 2 simple commutators that together interchange 2 x-
centers on U face and similarly 2 on R face:

( [P,Q]=P Q P&#x27;Q&#x27; as usual )

[r&#x27;u r,U&#x27;][R,u r&#x27;u&#x27;] 

(i would actually rotate the cube before the second commutator i 
guess)

Easy as can be i think. 

Doing similar stuff to swap +-centers using U,R,E and M should be 
fairly easy :-)

Have fun!

Don&#x27;t you dare insult my algorithms ;-)

Damn, I wish I could run that simulator... I&#x27;d like to generalize my 
algs but only doing it in my head is kinda hard... I wish they&#x27;d just 
make it a normal applet...

It&#x27;s not much longer than what I use for 1 3-cycle, it&#x27;s the quickest move I can remember 
and I have solved the 5x5x5 with it in under 2 minutes so it can&#x27;t be too bad.

Yeah, but I can only do that with something twice as long as what I originally posted.

I guess what&#x27;s fast on virtual cube and what&#x27;s fast on a real cube 
is a bit different. And this centerswapping stuff is mostly for 
supercubing. I have solved the 5x5x5 many times in less than 2 
minutes using mostly simple commutators and 3-cycles :-)

I tend not to use commutators to solve cubes - maybe that&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t solve 
the 3x3x3 fast; that and the fact that I can&#x27;t remember enough algorithms.
I&#x27;d probably think of a commutator as [x,y] but to do the algorithm I&#x27;d need to 
expand that out which would be at odds with the shorter [x,y] and would make 
it harder to remember.
But I don&#x27;t cube these days so it doesn&#x27;t matter anymore if I know any 
algorithms or not.

How can an average of 3 be technically termed a best average of &quot;5&quot;? That  
doesn&#x27;t make sense.
I guess you could rechnically call it a truncated average of 5 (if there were 5 
solves and the top and bottom times were dropped) because you&#x27;d be 
averaging a truncated set but an average of 3 can&#x27;t be an average of 5.

If you are as old as the hills you might remember that supposedly Bert is Evil.<br>
<br>
Anyway, having discovered <br>
<br>
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EvilNumber.html<br>
<br>
I decided to test if Bert was Evil in various bases (starting from base 30) using <br>
the digits 0-9, the letters A-T and other symbols.<br>
<br>
So in base 30, BERT represents the number which (in binary) is <br>
1001011110010100111 so (at least in base 30) BERT is not evil.<br>
Similarly in base 36, BERT is not evil.<br>
I tried out bases 30 all the way up to 208. That&#x27;s 179 tests of Bert being evil.<br>
I found Bert to be evil in 82 of the bases and odious in 97 of them. That makes <br>
Bert only 45.8% evil (approximately) - at least up to that stage.<br>
Of course, it would be better to figure out whether or not Bert was evil in liminf <br>
and limsup (or even in the limit if it exists) but the empirical evidence at least <br>
suggests that Bert is not evil - at least he appears to be less than 50% evil. <br>
Perhaps he&#x27;d only be not evil if the limsup was close to 0.<br>
<br>
If you stop at base 54, Bert is 56% evil. So far, the latest point at which Bert <br>
has been more than 50% evil is base 79 and the latest point at which Bert <br>
was half evil (50%) was base 91. That means Bert has been less than 50% <br>
evil on average (for all bases from 30 up to base n) for 117 consecutive <br>
bases.<br>

I don&#x27;t know what key I pressed but it was just an accident, so here&#x27;s 
the rest. The Mechanism is just like 3x3 but more of everything, and 
it&#x27;s even more robust.

Take out an edge:
http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/disassemble_megaminx/take_edge_out.jpg
(I use a screw driver for new ones only, they&#x27;re extremely stiff)

Remove a center cap:
http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/disassemble_megaminx/remove_center_cap.
jpg
(I prefer a thin rectangular blade for this. These days there 
shouldn&#x27;t be much glue so you shouldn&#x27;t need much force)

Center and its cap:
http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/disassemble_megaminx/center_cap.jpg
(Just so you know how deep you can stick the blade in without damaging 
anything)

Screw depth:
http://stefan-pochmann.de/foo/disassemble_megaminx/screw_depth.jpg
(When I&#x27;m done I screw in the screw just so it&#x27;s &quot;even&quot; with the top 
of the center, i.e. if I&#x27;m looking flat over the center top (here I&#x27;m 
at an angle) then I make the screw just disappear)

I  just don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;d complain that it was referred to as an average of 3, 
that&#x27;s all. If you want to call it an average of &quot;5&quot;, fair enough but complaining 
about it being called an average of 3 seems a bit over the top.

Good pic of Will Smith (and I assume yourself?) by the way.

I just wanted to share with you my happiness. Today I made my first sub-<br>

I&#x27;m very happy<br>
The times were:<br>
28.67, 27.56, 25.66, (25.59), 32.30, 32.83, (33.61), 31.84, 32.30, <br>
26.84, 27.53, 27.44. Average=29.30, SD=2.71<br>
I was very concentrated, and managed to do 7 sub-30 times. And the <br>
worst was 33.61. Man, this is very good to me!<br>
And earlier today, I made a very bad 35 average...<br>
I just have to stay calm and concentrate on fluency, more than turning <br>

I know it is not such a thing, but, hey!, I&#x27;ve cubing for just 3 months!<br>

Because after that Excel started putting BERT in scientific notation and I got 
lazy.
But spurred on by your message I have gone further - to base 8000 (no 
particular reason to stop there either except I don&#x27;t want to overload the 
machine which is also solving cubes) and I found that up to that stage Bert 
was 51% evil!

Well, if it was in a set of 3 times then he&#x27;s right. If it was in a set of 5 times with 
the best and worst times taken out I wouldn&#x27;t say it was an average of 3 or 5. I 
wouldn&#x27;t say it was technically an average of &quot;5&quot; though. I&#x27;d be more inclined 
to say it was an &quot;average&quot; of 5 (with the emphasis on average in that it was a 
truncated average rather than the mean that was being used). That may be 
because I&#x27;m a mathematician and not a cubist.

In the other instance, I guess I could just solve it in under 12.11 minutes and 
let them think that I was the fastest in the world!

Haha, you seriously need to learn a real programming language ;-)

I&#x27;ve also always been wondering why you click all your cubes together 
instead of writing a program that generates them...

Here&#x27;s a C++ program that aber about 1 second tells you that until 
base 100000 BERT is 50.25% evil:

#include &lt;iostream>
using namespace std;

typedef long long Int;

int main () {
  int first = 30, last = 100000, evils = 0;
  for( Int b=first; b&lt;=last; b++ ){
    char source[] = &quot;BERT&quot;;
    Int n = 0;
    for( int i=0; i&lt;4; i++ )
      n = b * n + source[i] - &#x27;A&#x27; + 10;
    bool evil = true;
    while( n ){
      n &amp;= n-1;
      evil = !evil;
    }
    evils += evil;
  }
  cout &lt;&lt; 100.0 * evils / (last - first + 1);
}

Cheers!
Stefan

Ok, I was way too afraid to leave 64 bits. Base 942972 is still ok and 
up until that BERT is 50.0271% evil (which the program told me after 
less than 2 seconds).

I can but I&#x27;ve not figured out how to do that on a Mac. I wouldn&#x27;t have come up with as 
nice a solution as below though.

Because I&#x27;m not good enough to write a cube solver - also, I am only solving specific cubes 
at the moment rather than generating a tree (if that&#x27;s what you meant).
At the moment, I&#x27;m only doing cube orientations.

I like that line Thats good.

OK that&#x27;s very nice.

Is there an official WCA definition of what is low and what is high? I figure there must be if 
all people who know about cubing know exactly which terminology to use in which 
situation.

          <div class="email-content">Actually, you can use Muppet Theory to prove Bert is evil.<br>
<br>
Definition.  A lemon is a lemma.<br>
<br>
Lemon. RAD=1<br>
Proof. Using chemical symbols<br>
NEON=NE, which means ON=1.<br>
BORON=B means ORON=1.  Since ON=1, OR=1 also.<br>
XENON=XE means NON=1.  Since ON=1, N=1 also.<br>
&gt;From ON=1 and N=1 we conclude O=1.<br>
&gt;From OR=1 and O=1 we conclude R=1.<br>
RADON=RN meaning ADO=1.  Since O=1, AD=1 also.<br>
Thus R=1 and AD=1 so RAD=1. QED<br>
<br>
Theorem. BERT = EVIL<br>
Proof.<br>
RAD=1 from the lemon.<br>
IRAD=I<br>
EAD=I (Ohm&#x27;s law E=IR)<br>
LEAD=LI<br>
PB=LI by chemical symbols.<br>
<br>
(It&#x27;s nice to know that lead = lithium, but that is not what we want <br>
so let us continue.)<br>
<br>
In the proof of the lemon we showed N=1.  Thus we can multiply by N <br>
on the right side only:<br>
PB=NIL<br>
PBRT=NRTIL<br>
<br>
The ideal gas law tells us PV=NRT.  Thus<br>
PBRT=PVIL<br>
BRT=VIL<br>
<br>
and multiplying by E yields<br>
B E R T = E V I L<br>

started a yahoo group like this one and till now we have abt 30-35
members. I recently got cubes for many of them so they&#x27;ll atleast
start cubing when the cube is in front of them. Only abt 3-4 ppl are
really interested though.

Anyone has any hints on how to make cubing popular? Ofcourse I boast
abt my avg to everyone who cares to listen and I posted abt my
blindfold cubing on our newsgroup and everyone was really excited. But
that soon died down. :(

Maybe i should start public cubing, but im a shy person and dont
usually like to do this. Any other hints?

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m also planning on starting a cube club at my school (Liberty<br>
University).  I always have a cube in my hands, whether I&#x27;m just<br>
walking to class, sitting in class waiting for it to start, or<br>
sometimes during class.  ;)  So there are a lot of people that know me<br>
for my cubing and many people seem interested in a club.  I&#x27;ve already<br>
taught  4 or 5 people there how to cube, and I know several more that<br>
want to learn.<br>
<br>
Bob, you have a cube club at your school, right?  Any tips on making<br>
it a success?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I haven&#x27;t look at the booklet, but I know that corner flip method 
you mentioned works.

Notice that
(R&#x27; D&#x27; R D)x6 = I

Also that move rotates UFR counterclockwise.

So if you have three corners that need to go clockwise you do that 
move

(R&#x27; D&#x27; R D)x4 on the first corner, then spin U, x4 for the second, 
spin U then x4 for the third.

That&#x27;s 12 executions, so your bottom layer pieces will solve twice, 
and of course end solved.

Three corners flipped counterclockwise will be 6 executions which is 
safe.

Also 1 corner clockwise and one counterclockwise will likewise be 6 
and so will 2 going each direction.

Again I haven&#x27;t look through the booklet, that would really stink if 
they&#x27;ve misprinted algorithms, but that corner flip method works.  
Though I think it wouldn&#x27;t be too complicated to print the inverse 
rather than to say to do the alg 4 times (which is the equivalent of 
the inverse since it solves in 6 repetitions).

Maybe they want to give the most basic solution possible to allow 
people room to think for themselves and come up with new things?

Isn&#x27;t it V=IR? Maybe sometimes other symbols are used so I&#x27;ll shut up.

You could mention it as a corollary.

Marvellous. I thoroughly enjoyed your post.

I guess you do hundreds of magic-solves in a row, when taking time!?
