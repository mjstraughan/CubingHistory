        trick you can do with two cubes. &gt; It was invented by Jerry Sadowitz
        after I explained to him the trick &gt; method for solving a cube behind
        your back. &gt; &gt; Have the two cubes scrambled as above, but with S2
        equal to the &gt; superflip. You can allow both cubes to be mixed
        further, as long as &gt; the same moves are done to both (essentially
        extending S1 a bit). You &gt; don't need to see this scrambling. &gt;
        &gt; One cube is hidden (doesn't matter which one), the other handed to
        &gt; you behind your back. You haven't seen either cube, and yet you can
        &gt; arrange your cube to match the hidden one exactly (just by doing
        the &gt; superflip S2 again). That's pretty clever. :-) ~ Bob

        Hey! That means he didn't follow the official rules for blindfold. What

        Does it support sticker cycles? I.e. what I use because I orient and
        permute at the same time? That's just a question, not a request from
        myself (maybe for others, don't know). I don't need yet another
        reason/way to not do full blindsolving ;-) Recently I've often solved
        with my blindsolving method but without being blindfolded, that's pretty
        much the same as your second usage idea minus the excitement ;-) But now
        that I finally finished my set of mental images yesterday, I want to
        force myself to do real complete blindsolving... Cheers! Stefan --- In

        a scramble and &gt; give the disjoint cyclic notation of the pieces for
        blindfold &gt; solving. &gt; &gt; It's finally here, I managed to put in
        the time for it. &gt; &gt; So basically you give it the scramble (I
        prefer to use the Scramble &gt; generator in NetCube, it exports in the
        perfect format), and the &gt; program returns: &gt; &gt; Length: 0 &gt;
        CO: 0000 0000 &gt; EO: 0000 0000 0000 &gt; CP: (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)
        &gt; EP: (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12) &gt; &gt; For the
        solved case if you do not turn on 1-cycle supression. &gt; Actaully I'm
        not sure if it can handle the solved case.... oh ya it &gt; can :). &gt;
        &gt; The beautiful part about this is that you can label things however
        &gt; you like... you can call a corner "Bob" if you'd like. THe program
        &gt; supports whatever numbering/ordering you like. &gt; &gt; The user
        defines what is positively/nutural/negatively oriented &gt; corner for
        instance. Though CO is defined in the UD manner, and EO &gt; is defined
        in the R2L2 restriction. &gt; &gt; The order it outputs the cycles is
        also user defined. &gt; &gt; Read the accompanying files carefully and
        enjoy. &gt; &gt; It's under the files section of this forum called

        Hi everyone, Some cubers from the UK and Australia had a really fun
        meeting hosted by former one-handed world record holder Duncan Dicks. We
        had a really great time meeting each other, and we also held a friendly
        competition. This was the first time I put into practice the handicap
        method which was discussed earlier in the group, and even though I do
        say so myself (and I'm sure the others will agree with me) it worked
        very very well! So well, I may even write a page detailing how to use it
        for future friendly comps :) Jasmine Lee won the 3x3x3 event, and I will
        post the full results online on my website, when I write a report of my
        experiences (which will probably be tomorrow now). Be sure to watch out
        for the pictures and the report coming soon! :) Dan :)

        Hi everyone! Yesterday I lowered my personal best and average for 4*4*4
        to 1:16,67/1:27,34. I use a Meffert's 4*4*4 but I will get my Rubik's

        eassier to perfor triggers I will be able to cut of at least 10 seconds

        Hi Gunnar, Very good records! (I will update later today...) At the
        moment my best 4x4x4 cube is a Rubik's Studio 4x4x4. But I bought two
        Rubiks.com 4x4x4's. They are already nice, but I expect them to become
        much better. My Eastsheen 4x4x4's really suck, but that puzzle has huge
        differences per cube. David Wesley had one of the best 4x4x4's in
        Toronto, and it was an Eastsheen. Do not give up too soon on your
        Rubiks.com 4x4x4. After a while it will get much better! Good luck and

        Hey! &gt;From my experience with various 4x4x4 cube i would say that
        it's not necessarily the cube with which you can fingertrick most easily
        which will be your best cube ;-) Much more important than pure slickness
        of turning layers is stability of the cube. My old rubiks.com 4x4x4 cube
        turns much more easily than any of my 2 studio 4x4x4. On the other hand
        it's not stable at all. I spend too much time making sure not to
        overturn and to avoid frequent popping. There should stil be some
        resistance to your turning of the layers. This will make you turn much
        more accurately and the cube won't pop easily. On the old design 4x4x4
        cubes with a spherical core the most important thing is that the core
        doesn't have any severe skewness. You can easily feel skewness when
        turning the cube as a 2x2x2 cube and resting ur palm against one half of
        the cube. You will feel something move distinctively round in circles
        inside if there is skewness. The more skew the more you feel it :-( A
        tight cube with less skewness will be better that a looser cube with
        more skewness, cause it will be more stable and you feel more confident
        with it. It's a shame we can't simply pick a good cube from the factory
        ourselves :-P Your new times are great! If u really can shave off 10
        more seconds it's awesome :-) Cheers! -Per PS! These observations do
        hold for my method anyway. I use lots of inner slice turns to make up my
        commutators. Edge-pairing/3x3x3 reduction scheme maybe is more fogiving
        to a loose/rattling cube? I'm not sure but i guess maybe that's a the
        case ;-) &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Ron van

        I have been thinking about a 3x3x3 Sudoku Cube, where you would have a
        box of 9 numbers on each sticker, and you would have to create a
        traditional Sudoku puzzle on each face. Of course you wouldn't need to
        solve the box, but you would still have to make the rows and columns on
        each face. 4x4x4 Sudoku sounds awesome! I expect there would be some
        hardcore maths involved, although I might have a go in the old fashioned
        trial and error way later ;) One thing, how does one make sure that a

        Hey everyone, Is there a set of algs (or a 2x2x2 solver) that doesn't
        care what the orientation of the cube is after applying CLL (to solve
        the 2nd layer starting with the first layer solved?) So it solves the
        cube but maybe ends with the cube rotated some way. Chris

        I also recommend CLL for what you're doing with it. COLL algs are often
        longer, in order to preserve edge orientation. If you're only going to
        use it on the 2x2, you may as well learn whichever CLL or COLL case is
        fastest for a given situation. -Mike Bennett P.S. How on Earth do you
        learn them all so fast?! I'm going at a snail's pace. I've put so much
        effort into my 4x4 lately I haven't learned a COLL case in probably two
        weeks. You already know more of them than I do. Are you learning them
        all from Lars' site, or do you use other sites, as well? If so, which

        I have an easy time memorizing algorithms. What I have been doing is
        spending one day to learn an entire case of algorithms, then spending
        the next day to practice the recognition. So far the timeline looks like

        easy recognition, only 5 new algs, but 1 is a mirror!) Day 6 (today) --
        Practice "T" algs/recogntion Day 7 (tomorrow) -- Learn either U, L, or

        I've been learning the COLL and some CLL algs, recently, in an effort to
        change over my method. If you're interested, I believe the subject of
        the relevant posts is something like 'New LL strategy proposal'. Since I
        seem to be moving at such a slow pace in learning them, I was wondering
        which ones are the most frequent cases. It seems that the Sune and
        Antisune cases crop up fairly regularly, but the others seem less
        frequent. I've been learning them in order of the ones that take me the

        followed by the 'T' cases. I was going to learn the 'U' cases next, but
        I'm thinking about the Sune/Antisune cases instead, because they seem

        I would definitely suggest the Sune/Antisune if you are ambidextrous. :)
        That way, you can tackle twice as many algorithms with the same effort
        just by mirroring algorithms. The recognition is exactly the same, just
        mirrored. Most of the algorithms are either mirrors, or in some cases,
        you can use the inverse of another algorithm instead. ~ Bob --- In

        Hey everyone, First off I got this idea from Richard Patterson, so all
        my credit for this goes to him. I've recently started solving (after
        seeing Richard do it) my opposite cross color frequently. During
        inspection I will always check both white and yellow and see which cross
        is set up better. I think this is helping my times. I don't get too
        thrown off with a yellow cross solve, since my F2L edges are the same. I
        never have to look for an edge that has a yellow or white sticker, which
        is what throws me off about full color neutrality. I've had several
        solves where the white cross (my color I used to ALWAYS use, no matter
        what) was terrrrrrible, but my yellow cross was maybe an extended cross,
        or just a nice smooth easy cross. I'm going to start using this all the
        time now. The benefits are that I get to use two centers as my basis, so
        I have twice as much chance of getting a good cross as I used to. Also,
        since the F2L edges are ALWAYS the same, I won't get thrown off during
        the F2L with a lot of practice. Again all credit to Richard here, as I
        got the idea from him, but this is now my current approach to F2L. What
        does everyone think? Has anyone else ever considered solving your
        opposite color? Note: I would never solve a cross that is not white or
        yellow, since that would have an F2L edge that I noramally have as
        either a cross or LL edge, which would throw me off too much. The only
        colors I consider are my old cross color, and it's opposite. Chris

        Toby and I raced where we did a cross of each color. Yeah, opposite you
        can do pretty close to normal. With practice, I'm sure it'd be the same.

        I've been doing this for a while now, and it works wonders. The only
        problem I run into is every great once in a while I somehow manage to
        place a pair in the wrong slot, because I'm used to red being clockwise
        from blue, or something of that nature. Sometimes, having white for the
        last layer helps, too. It's so darned bright. Also, I've noticed that an
        easy way to shave off a couple of moves is to use working corners/edges.
        If they're correctly placed, it generally takes 4 or fewer moves to

        I always use working corners/edges for all of the F2L that I do and I'm
        convinced it's just as efficient as F2L pairs once you've picked up a
        few tricks. Having said that the more mechanical nature of F2L pairs has
        a lot of advantages! ----- Original Message ----- From: "Mike Bennett"

        Actually, usually Norwegians and Swedes make fun of others as much as
        they can. They use blond jokes against eachother, and instead of saying
        that blondes did those stupid things, they say that Norwegians did them.
        Like, 'Why did the Norwegian bring a car door into the desert? So that
        he can roll down the window if it gets to hot!' :)) And by the way,

        I tried this idea, it's pretty cool! I have the same problem as Mike
        described also, but I don't think it would take too long to get used to
        it. Its quite odd having blue to the right of red, rather than the other
        way round. I also have tried a similar trick for the 4x4x4, I used to
        first solve White, then solve Yellow, and then solve the other four
        faces one after the other. I remember the order of the colours (so the
        colour scheme ends up being correct), by always turning the Yellow face
        into my Right hand, and then going around the cube using the word R-BOG
        (which means Red Blue Orange Green obviously) But sometimes the White
        isn't the easiest first colour to solve, so now I have 3 rules about
        which colour I have in my right hand (after solving the first two
        opposite faces) and 3 different words (depending on which colours are
        left) After some practice, it has improved my centres by a few seconds
        at least, because I can always pick the easiest centre to start off
        with. Another trick I have found useful, while I am talking about 4x4x4,
        is when solving the final 4 centres, to try and preserve rows of 2 if
        possible. This means that you might have to do a couple of extra moves
        when lining up the first two of the four, but then you are usually
        always faced with a very eaasy and fast case for the final 2 centres.
        I'm yet to test whether it actually improves my centre solving time or
        not, I'm still taking about 25 seconds for the centres which I know is
        longer than the really fast guys, so I wouldn't mind some tips too! Dan

        chance &gt; &gt; of getting a good cross as I used to. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Also, since the F2L edges are ALWAYS the same, I won't get thrown
        off &gt; &gt; during the F2L with a lot of practice. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Again all credit to Richard here, as I got the idea from him, but this
        &gt; &gt; is now my current approach to F2L. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What
        does everyone think? Has anyone else ever considered solving &gt; &gt;
        your opposite color? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Note: I would never solve a
        cross that is not white or yellow, since &gt; &gt; that would have an
        F2L edge that I noramally have as either a cross or &gt; &gt; LL edge,
        which would throw me off too much. The only colors I &gt; &gt; consider
        are my old cross color, and it's opposite. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris

        Hey everyone, I was recently messing around with some ZBF2L stuff on my
        cube and found a case I've never seen/used before. It's a very helpful
        ZBF2L alg, but also very nice for using as just a standard F2L alg. Do R
        U' R' U R U' R' U' to a solved F2L (cross on bottom). To solve I used to
        do the inverse of the alg above, but I just found F R' F' R2 U R' You
        can do this as y (r U' r') y' (R2 U R') So you save 2 moves instead of
        the usual 8 move alg. Apologies if this isn't new, but hey it was new to
        me :-D Chris

        Again I came up with this alg for use for ZBF2L. If it stinks for F2L
        then don't use it. I just wanted to see if anyone had ever seen it. So
        the answer to your question for me is absolutely, but I use the alg for

        Other than the {R,U} move this one is my favorite for this case, though
        it starts with the U turn at a different angle. This alg also happens to
        be the basis for about 5 other ZBF2L algs. The other ones just use maybe
        3 setup moves to get into this case, then solve from there. F' U F R U
        R' (do the inverse to setup the case) This one is fast, nice easy
        conjugate U move sequences. Along those lines I also like this alg: F'
        U' F R U R' (do the inverse to setup) Both of those are quite nice.

        you've already put in a 6 (that part is easy). To give you more idea of

        &gt; And by the way, Finnish usually just keep to themselves and dont
        &gt; care much about the swedes or nowegians are fighting about. &gt;
        &gt; 2) why was finland suddenly included (on the positive side)? I
        don't see how you guys know that in Finland jokes about Swedes are less
        frequent than in Norway, or if they are part of Finnish tradition at
        all. The fact that Swedish is a compulsory language in Finnish schools
        and that Swedish is an official language in Finland already tells about
        how many Swedish jokes there should be in the Finnish folklore. It's
        about the same thing as jokes about Hungarians in Romania, although the
        Hungarian language is not compulsory or an official language in Romania.
        The Swedish minority in Finland is just as large as the Hungarian
        minority in Romania, and I think that's the main reason for the jokes
        (and also of course the common history the two countries have). "What

        All, I really like this. I'm been working on my cross seriously for the
        last week or so. Seems like a waste of time trying to memorize so many
        moves when you can take advantage of the opposite color having 1 cross
        piece already in position and a few others ready to go in. Thought it
        would be hard to get used to. But didn't take very long. Thanks for the

        opposite color solving &gt;I always use working corners/edges for all of
        the F2L that I do and I'm &gt; convinced it's just as efficient as F2L
        pairs once you've picked up a few &gt; tricks. Having said that the more

        &gt; helps, too. It's so darned bright. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, I've
        noticed that an easy way to shave off a couple of moves is to &gt; use
        working corners/edges. If they're correctly placed, it generally &gt;
        takes &gt; 4 or fewer moves to finish off the pair, instead of 7 or
        more. The worst &gt; cases are something like 5 and 6 moves, so it's

        &gt; Hey everyone, &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; First off I got this idea
        from Richard Patterson, so all my credit &gt;&gt; for &gt;&gt; &gt; this
        goes to him. &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've recently started solving
        (after seeing Richard do it) my &gt;&gt; opposite &gt;&gt; &gt; cross
        color frequently. During inspection I will always check both &gt;&gt;
        &gt; white and yellow and see which cross is set up better. &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I think this is helping my times. I don't get too
        thrown off with a &gt;&gt; &gt; yellow cross solve, since my F2L edges
        are the same. I never have to &gt;&gt; &gt; look for an edge that has a
        yellow or white sticker, which is what &gt;&gt; &gt; throws me off about
        full color neutrality. &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've had several
        solves where the white cross (my color I used to &gt;&gt; &gt; ALWAYS
        use, no matter what) was terrrrrrible, but my yellow cross was &gt;&gt;
        &gt; maybe an extended cross, or just a nice smooth easy cross. &gt;&gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm going to start using this all the time now. The
        benefits are &gt;&gt; that &gt;&gt; &gt; I get to use two centers as my
        basis, so I have twice as much chance &gt;&gt; &gt; of getting a good
        cross as I used to. &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Also, since the F2L
        edges are ALWAYS the same, I won't get thrown off &gt;&gt; &gt; during
        the F2L with a lot of practice. &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Again all
        credit to Richard here, as I got the idea from him, but &gt;&gt; this
        &gt;&gt; &gt; is now my current approach to F2L. &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        &gt; What does everyone think? Has anyone else ever considered solving
        &gt;&gt; &gt; your opposite color? &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Note: I
        would never solve a cross that is not white or yellow, since &gt;&gt;
        &gt; that would have an F2L edge that I noramally have as either a cross
        &gt;&gt; or &gt;&gt; &gt; LL edge, which would throw me off too much.
        The only colors I &gt;&gt; &gt; consider are my old cross color, and
        it's opposite. &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Chris &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;

        Its possible to swap any two outer edges on an ordinary 5x5. But when I
        try to do it on a super-5x5 I not only swap two outer edges but also two
        centers (centers-edges). Is it possible to swap only a pair of outer
        edges on a super cube, or is there some strange parity connecting those
        pieces? /K√•re

        The parity of those centers (the "+" ones as I call them, the ones that
        form the plus around the centermost piece) is connected to that of the
        corners and outer edges. If you just want to swap the outer edges (and
        any other required effects) then you want to leave the corners in the
        solved state (even permutation). If the corners are in an even
        permutation and the edges are in an odd permutation (since you want to
        swap just two), then those plus sign centers must also be odd. This is
        because every type of quarter turn, inner slice or outer face, affects
        the parity of those "+" centers. If the corners are even then the net
        number of outerface quarter turns done is even, and if the outer edges
        are odd then the net number of inner slice turns is odd. So the net
        number of turns total is odd and therefore the "+" centers have odd
        parity. This is because every type of quarter turn affects the parity of
        these guys. That's why switching two outer edges requires also switching
        two "+" centers. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Last week, this Sudoku was posted in this group: It is difficult - I
        take it you've already put in a 6 (that part is easy). To give you more
        idea of the difficulty, I gave a friend who also does Sudoku another
        grid with the numbers 1,2,... on which order to fill the squares in!
        (That was a while ago and he still hasn't got the second one in yet.) I
        don't know where you are in the puzzle, so I'll tell you this - the
        second number to put in goes in the square below that I've labelled with
        "@". The third one goes where the # is. (If you get really stuck, I can
        post a complete solution that explains how to get each step without
        trial and error.) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; . 2 . * . . . * . . . &gt; &gt; .

        As many of you are aware, I've started learning COLL and CLL, in an

        I interpretted the first post as the want to switch *just* two outer
        edges, which also requires switching two of the + centers. I agree that
        switching just outer edges as well as changing the corner parity, the
        inner edges, and the x centers to odd is ok too. I remember I hadn't

        Hey Mike, &gt; I understand that if one orients the edges during F2L,
        then performs COLL, the odds of skipping the PLL are 1/12. What if one
        orients two of the pieces during F2L, then performs CLL, purposely
        flipping two edges? Are the odds 1/48? 1/12 if the edges come up
        oriented? Shouldn't you know which edges are going to be flipped? A
        small amount of practice will teach you which edges are going to be
        flipped when you perform a CLL alg. If instead it is random, I think it
        should be 1/6 * 1/12 = 1/72 for the edges to be oriented. &gt; What are
        good average times for most algorithms? Though I've only been using
        COLL+PLL for 8 days, I think almost all of the algorithms can be sub-2.
        Surely there is at least one sub-2 algorithm for each of the 7
        orienations, with an average of 1.5 or so. If it will take you about 2.5
        seconds instead of 1.5, then also consider the amount of time you are
        losing at this stage for recognition (recognition of COLL is clearly
        going to take longer than just OLL). Thus, you will probably be losing
        1.5-2 seconds on this stage to *maybe* have a faster PLL. That's not
        worth it. ;) Almost all of the COLL algorithms I have learned are very
        easy and very fast, but there are a couple of cruddy cases. I don't know
        for sure yet because I still have 8 cases to go. ;-) I will hopefully
        make videos showing the fingertricks and stuff when I'm done learning
        and get most of these algorithms to be reasonably fast. &gt; Should I
        strive for sub-2 on most of my corner algs? All of the ones I currently
        have learned I average under 3 with, with most of those under 2.5. I am
        sure you are capable of sub-2 for most, with an average of about 1.5 for
        many. &gt; What about edge algs? You mean the edge PLLs? For me, the
        3-cycles are just over 1.5 on avg, the Z-perm about 1.9 and the one that
        looks like a "+" is my fastest PLL at about 1.3 seconds. :-) &gt; And
        what are some fast algs for the Z-permutation? I currently use
        (RB')(R'B)(FR'FB')(R'BR)(F2U), but it takes me around 2.5 on average,
        which seems a bit much for a simple edge PLL. That one definitely
        doesn't fit my hands! :-P I use x' F (R U') (R' Ua) (R' e) (R' U) (R D2)
        which is just angled differently. I have a slow and fast video:

        http://www.cubewhiz.com/videos/pll/pll04fast.avi The fast video isn't
        overly fast, but it is still sub-2 seconds. :-) ~ Bob

        1/12. What if one orients two of the pieces during F2L, then performs
        CLL, purposely flipping two edges? Are the odds 1/48? 1/12 if the edges

        COLL recognition isn't hard at all once you get it. look at the
        non-yellow U stickers of all the corners and the F stickers of UFL and
        UFR. The notation shows the stickers relationships to eachother on the

        The U and F stickers on the UFL corner are a color, and the color left

        the color to the right of the first color. the F sticker of UFR is the
        same as the first color. I don't memorize the actual notation written, I
        memorize in shapes and opposites, So for that case above, I'd call it:
        diagonal down (for the two F stickers) opposite (for the non F

        I know that it is a fast method that Ron, Dan H, and Lars V use with the
        2x2 grids of letters to define each case. However I personally find it
        confusing and I only use it when this method overlaps with it.
        http://rokumentai.akimoto3.com/GRSM-e3.htm This is how Masayuki Akimoto
        recognizes, and this is more or less how I do it too. All you have to do
        is look around on the cube for sticker positions that contain either
        opposite colored stickers, or same colored stickers. Most of the cases
        with two adjacent corners flipped and the other two correctly oriented
        will be the same as the 2x2 grid method, but the others are very
        different. Not to put down the "standard" speedcubing.com method, but I
        find it confusing. Try Masayuki's method, I think it is much clearer.

        Hi Chris, It is always interesting to see your posts about COLLs. Since
        there are not many CLL (COLL) &gt; ELL cubers, it is good chance for me
        to think my algs. Sorry, I missed your old posts. I used to use B L' U2
        L B' L' B U2 B' L. Probably one year ago, I changed this as similar to
        yours, but I do Alan (?) then anti-Sune(?). It is because of my
        recogition. I have to distinguish two cases. 1: L' U R U' L U R' 2: L' U
        R U' L U R' - L U2 L' U' L U' L' If the recognition system is different,
        you may not be interested in. In regard to permution speed, I think I
        still can do faster with old alg. Masayuki Akimoto

        Hey Masayuki! I have a question? How do you perform B L' U2 L B' L' B U2
        B' L ? I do it as (B) (L' U2) x' (L U' L' U) y' R2 (U') (F) Maybe I just
        need to practice this alg more, of do it differently. I can get very
        fast times with it if I have a flawless execution, but if I lockup my
        time for it is about 4 seconds :-( I can do the RUL sune/alan one in
        about 2.75 on average, so I guess I'm just debating whether I am just
        doing a good alg poorly, or if that alg is slow for my hands. I'd be
        curious in how you execute that case, or if you have any other cool algs

        Hey again Masayuki, Yeah my execution is very poor for B L' U2 L B' L' B
        U2 B' L (02.50), 03.20, 03.28, 02.88, 04.20, 03.95, 03.06, 04.13,
        (04.53), 04.37, 03.26, 04.18 = 3.65 But for R' U' R U' R' U2 R - L' U R
        U' L U R' is better 02.72, (02.28), 02.45, (03.65), 03.38, 02.63, 02.34,
        02.97, 02.72, 03.22, 03.26, 02.78 = 2.85 I always seem to lockup with
        the first B turn transition into the x' (L U' L' U). Also I have a
        question for you, can you recognize the CLL cases from different angles?
        I've been meaning to learn the sune cases from the 180 degree rotation
        of where I currently recognize. Since I use your method of same and
        opposite colored stickers I can do the 4 corner flipped cases from
        multiple angles, but the two corners flipped cases and the sunes I have
        to do from the same angle. Do you use multiple angles for recognition,
        and if so does it help? Thanks again, Chris --- In

        Hey everyone, Lots of questions from me today :-D I have a question
        about whether anyone uses this particular empty slot case? I've recently
        realize that I rely very heavily on this alg, and use it quite often.
        It's not the fastest case, but then again I have gotten fast solves when
        using it. I guess I consider this case to be somewhat mediocre, but
        maybe I'm just reading too much into things. The case is: R' F R F' R'
        U' R (do the inverse of this alg to setup the case) It solves the BR
        pair, but it does so by using the FR one. Again I've noticed that I
        really do rely on this alg heavily, but I don't know if it is a good alg
        to use (F and R moves, and 7 moves where most empty slot case are 5 or
        so). If anyone uses this alg a lot, thinks it sucks and would puke to
        see another cube use it lol, let me know. I'm really curious about what
        others think about this case, since I don't remember how I learned this
        alg. I think I found it when messing around with Ron's cube solver, but
        I'm not sure. Anyway let me know what you think, positive or negative, I
        really am curious! Chris

        Hi Chris, &gt; Yeah my execution is very poor for B L' U2 L B' L' B U2
        B' L &gt; = 3.65 = 8.56/3, 8.32/3 (timed 3 executions) &gt; But for R'
        U' R U' R' U2 R - L' U R U' L U R' is better &gt; = 2.85 = 9.02/3,
        8.70/3 I would do much faster. In both two cases, gripping position is
        completely different, it is difficult to compare directly. About my
        execution, it is very dificult to write down. So I made small video.
        Please try it. http://rokumentai.akimoto3.com/cll.wmv &gt; Also I have a
        question for you, can you recognize the CLL cases from &gt; different
        angles? I've been meaning to learn the sune cases from the &gt; 180
        degree rotation of where I currently recognize. Since I use your &gt;
        method of same and opposite colored stickers I can do the 4 corner &gt;
        flipped cases from multiple angles, but the two corners flipped cases
        and the sunes I have to do from the same angle. &gt; Do you use multiple
        angles for recognition, and if so does it help? Not all cases, but I
        practice a lot of the cases of multiangle recognition. I think this does
        help. But in order to recognize CLL with edge flipping, I need to do
        from the same angle. I loose a second here. I think I need to go back
        more simple method. Happy COLL Masayuki

        Thanks for all the responses everyone, I'm glad to know that others like
        it too. I guess I just wanted to make sure I wasn't spending a lot of my
        F2L time on this case if others though it wasn't necessary. I also use
        this one, which is more of a standard F2L empty slot case in that it is
        only 5 moves long. This one is the same as the other one in that the
        edge is flipped in another F2L slot, but this one is much better than
        the other. Case: L2 D F2 D' L2 (do the inverse of this alg to setup the
        case) This case solves BL by using the FR slot. Both this alg and the
        first I posted go together very nicely. This one I remember I found via
        intuition after I learned the first one. Hope everyone has some use for
        these. Chris P.S. While I'm at it I've also started using these a lot
        too. Both of these I found intuitively by getting tired of running into
        these cases without a way to solve. 1) R2 D' F2 D R2 (solve FL using BR,
        do the inverse to setup) 2) R' U R' D' F' D R2 (the same as the above
        case, only the F2L edge is flipped the other way). Do the inverse to
        setup. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Bob Burton"

        (F and R moves, and 7 moves &gt; &gt; where most empty slot case are 5
        or so). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone uses this alg a lot, thinks it

        about this case, since I &gt; &gt; don't remember how I learned this
        alg. I think I found it when &gt; &gt; messing around with Ron's cube
        solver, but I'm not sure. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway let me know what

        Last night I noticed that when I try to cube quietly (because someone is
        sleeping nearby) I automatically slow down and become quite
        fluent/smooth during F2L and generally lock up much less. It works much
        better than explicitly telling myself "boy go slow". Maybe that's also a
        reason we hurry too much in competitions: because the sound level is
        generally higher there and we have a tendency to match the sound level
        around us (at least that's the case for talking). Cheers! Stefan

        One suggestion, though: It says "Time for cross and 4 F2L pairs." So is
        only Fridrich allowed? How about Petrus? Or anything else that solves
        (at least) two adjacent parallel layers? I think they should be allowed.

        without &gt; &gt; trial-and-error... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Bram This is a
        bit OT for cubing but anyway, here's the first few steps (to get the
        first 7 cells in). It's still difficult after this so there's still a
        challenge left but it still doesn't need any trial &amp; error. Initial
        Grid: (above) For convenience label rows R1 to R9 (downwards), columns
        C1-C9 (left to right), boxes B1-B9 (right then down). 1. The
        intersection of R1 and C3 contains 6 (it is the only square in B1 that
        can contain a 6). *26|***|*** ***|6**|**3 *74|*8*|*** ------------------
        ***|**3|**2 *8*|*4*|*1* 6**|5**|*** ------------------ ***|*1*|78*
        5**|**9|*** ***|***|*4* 2. In C9, 4,7 and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9,
        leaving only the intersections with R1, R5 and R6. In particular, R5
        already contains 4 and 8 so the intersection of C9 and R5 must contain
        7. *26|***|*** ***|6**|**3 *74|*8*|*** ------------------ ***|**3|**2
        *8*|*4*|*17 6**|5**|*** ------------------ ***|*1*|78* 5**|**9|***
        ***|***|*4* 3. In B5, 1 and 8 must appear on the leading diagonal as
        they are already present in C5 and R5. Thus since 7 is in R5, 7 must
        occur in the intersection of B5 and C5. In particular in C5, 4,7 and 8
        appear before B8. Thus in R8 4,7,8 must occur in C2-C4 and hence 4 lies
        in the intersection of C2 and R8. *26|***|*** ***|6**|**3 *74|*8*|***
        ------------------ ***|**3|**2 *8*|*4*|*17 6**|5**|***
        ------------------ ***|*1*|78* 54*|**9|*** ***|***|*4* 4. Thus in B4, 4
        goes in the intersection of R4 and C1. *26|***|*** ***|6**|**3
        *74|*8*|*** ------------------ 4**|**3|**2 *8*|*4*|*17 6**|5**|***
        ------------------ ***|*1*|78* 54*|**9|*** ***|***|*4* 5. Thus in C1, 7

        54*|**9|*** 7**|***|*4* 6. Recalling that in R8, C2-C4 contain 4,7 and
        8, 8 must go in C3 (because B7 contains 4,7) and so 7 in C4. *26|***|***
        ***|6**|**3 *74|*8*|*** ------------------ 4**|**3|**2 *8*|*4*|*17

        product or not ;-) Did it for instance still have the same (unusual)
        colorscheme as in the video on their site ? Still white plastic? Ando so
        on ... Must have been fun trying it out anyway. And yes u should have

        Hey everyone, I know a very small minority of people are interested in
        learning ZBF2L algs, but I'm trying to put together the ones that I
        think would benefit CFOP solvers the most without having to learn too
        many algs. I've come up with a proposal for an advanced partial edge
        control method for the LL edges while doing the 4th c/e pair. Macky
        already has all the algs to one of the cases I have too, so I'm only
        adding one more F2L case (7 more algs). The total to learn would be 13
        algorithms, but they would help you to get all oriented edges where most
        people would just use partial edge control. I added a section at the top
        of my zbf2l page that describes what I propose.
        http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zbf2l.html Again, I find these algs to
        be incredibly useful, and I'd like to bring to light the most useful
        ones that I think could benefit a CFOP solver. I also want to compile a
        list of all the shortest/fastest to execute zbf2l algs. This would mean
        that instead of the regular f2l case for a few rare cases, you could use
        an alg that takes the same amount of time and get all oriented edges
        (and the best part is you would *know* you will get all oriented edges
        before starting the alg). Again, I'm just trying to make this stuff seem
        a little more accessible and show the pros of what I'm really starting
        to believe will be very useful algs to know. Let me know what you think
        about my proposed advanced edge control idea. Chris

        It was a prototype. It got stuck very often, and it had weird color
        scheme. It took me 1 hour to solve centers, except 2 pieces. My dad
        solved them. Then I started doing pairing, but I sadly messed up
        centers. The inventor, Mr. Verdes, sends me one when it's ready. Maybe
        6x6x6 was so hard for me, because I have never tried 5x5x5!

        Hi Chris. I think extending partial edge control to cases where the c/e
        pair isn't yet together is a fantastic idea and something I've been
        planning to learn. You've finally given me an excuse to get around to
        it. It's helpful because 75+% of the time, my c/e pairs are inserted
        from one of those cases. This will make my partial edge solving much
        more efficient, and will probably eliminate my need for CLL+ELL for all
        cases except the final pair being solved before I orient edges. Because
        of these last few posts, I'm starting to believe in the ZBF2L cause a
        little more. After I finish learning COLL and perhaps some CLL+ELL, I'll
        probably wind up learning ZBF2L now. Thanks. ; P -Mike Bennett -----

        Caltech Club on Friday morning so November 4. We'll be at the

        actually get UK TV will already know but Tuesday &gt; 26th July morning
        there are some cube TV things going on. &gt; &gt; Dan Harris and Jasmine
        Lee are going to be on ITV during the breakfast show &gt; and I (Duncan
        Dicks) and my kids are going to be on BBC Breakfast (at around &gt; 8 am
        I believe). &gt; &gt; We are all going to be at Hamley's toy shop later
        in the day for their &gt; Rubik's Cube 25th Anniversary. &gt; &gt; We
        are hoping to to get both TV slots videoed and maybe posted sometime.
        &gt; Wish us luck! &gt; &gt; Duncan &gt;

        All -- I just got my 5x and promptly set to solving it. I'm using the
        standard "reduce to 3x" algorithm (centers, match edges, solve like 3x).
        However, I'm stuck on the final edge match. Do you know any good 5x
        solution resources on the web? Chris Hardwick has a great 4x solutions
        resource which I use for the few things unique to 4x, but no 5x. Here's
        where I'm stuck, in case you know of a move for it. What's left is the
        Red-Green and the Red-Blue edge. I have them on the same layer (front) ,
        opposite each other (FR and FL), with the following setup (the inner
        colors of the pair (in caps) are on the Front face) Blue-RED RED-Green
        Red-GREEN RED-Blue Red-GREEN BLUE-Red Feel free to reply in email (to
        yeff@...) and say "check out *this* website" to avoid group clutter.
        Thanks in advance for any help, yeff

        My experience is that people are just as impressed by a 20 seconds solve
        as a 40 seconds one. Either way it's just faster than is imaginable for

        Congratulation for your hard motivation to learn ZB System !! I read
        your note on your web page about your progress and I am surprise why you
        want to persever in this system because you say it could'nt be faster
        than fridrich if his system is use by excellents cubers like those who
        average 15' or sub 15 ? isn't more "easy" to persever in F2L cases to
        decrease your time? . I say that because I think ZBF2L is not the
        problem of This system. For example you can easily decrease the number
        of configurations if you connect the pair on LL etc... or other example
        . The Big Problem of this system IS THE LL PERMUTATIONS (493 algos) and
        particulary The case: S (72 config.) and case: As (72 config) according
        to Dan Harris ' Page at : http://www.cubestation.co.uk/ So, 144 config
        in total on which you surely stuck because there are very similar ! I
        don't know if you have always a list of them with the color pattern,
        that will frighten you! good luck nevertheless Nicolas

        Alrite ;-) I gonna try avoid the shift key for the most part :-P I don't
        have a good 2x2x2 cube :-( I do believe that 7-8 secs is possible even
        with a "no-method" approach: - first layer corners , 3-4 secs (should
        see how to do those moves during preinspection time) - position LL
        corners, 2- secs - orient LL corner, 2+ secs So total : 7-8 secs I guess
        for those who practice the 2x2x2 they will prefer do it on a real 2x2x2
        cube. Those who don't practice much might well prefer to do it on a
        3x3x3. Even w keeping stickers on the edges left intact :D Also, is
        noone using LBL method anymore? Hehehe ... Well i'm in fact still using
        that and i just did a new pb average of 21.49 secs with it, and a new pb
        single solve of 13.20 also. Not too bad of a 39 yr old to still improve
        his 20 yr old speedcubing method :-)) Cheers! -Per PS! As a rough guess
        i'd say about 50% use pure fridrich method, 30% use some slight
        variation of it and the rest of us are using corners first, label by
        label or whatever ... &gt; --- In

        Hi :-) What he means by "lazy" is not that u are lazy to learn that
        enormous high number of special cases. But once you know all that u have

        Hi Gilles, I think it's true for many things. Personally, these last few
        days have been absolutely miserable on the blindfold solving for me. I
        think I failed six solves in the row. My hands were just slipping and I
        was forgetting pieces, transposing pieces... quite the nightmare. This
        was just yesterday so I haven't had the chance to take a break, but I'm
        confident it'll help. It definitely applied when I was speed cubing and
        I was averaging around 27 seconds. I got busy in school and so I took
        some time off, about three weeks, and then I came back. The first two
        averages were about 28 but then after I started getting a feel for
        things, I hit about 25's. And in music, generally the best preparation
        of a major concerto, at least I did this back in high school, was I
        learned a piece my sophomore year, and then put it off and learned some
        other things, and then brought it back up again for the competition when
        I was a senior. Taking time off can give a new perspective to things
        that you weren't able to see before. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        Multislotting is when you solve more than one F2L piece. Such that when
        you make one F2L, the other one is already set-up or in the slot. There
        is a website that has a few examples of multislotting
        http://homepage.ntlworld.com/family.hayden/cube/cube_frontpage.html but
        it doesn't work. Multislotting saves times and uses fewer moves than
        making two F2L pieces. Also I think you could use Multislotting for more

        In fact multisloting is very easy, but it is hard to do at very high
        speed because you may anticipate 4 F2L pieces, Joel was right but not
        complete, in fact i try to work with another pair while inserting the
        first one. Sometimes it doesnt solve direclty the 2nd pair but offers an
        easier case which allow me to always have easy cases or at least not
        have worst cases. Some people think thats is better to use it for 2
        first slots, but I think it is easier to do that with 2-3 lasts slots
        because there is less freedom, and for the 1st slot you need to
        anticipate quickly what you'll do after cross. I did an average of 50
        cubes one month ago and average about 31 moves for solving F2L.

        Perhaps a part of this is the fact that because you haven't touched the
        cube in two weeks, you're forced to go slightly slower at the beginning.

        Hey Gunnar, When learning a new alg I usually am trying 3-4 different
        ones out for the case I am looking at to see which I will like. I
        basically just read the alg off while timing myself to see which one I
        think will be faster. I don't memorize each one, I just stare at the
        notation while solving to get an idea of how the alg will work. Once I
        do decide on an alg, I have already timed myself doing it 10-20 times,
        so I have a fairly loose idea of how the alg goes. I usually have them
        broken down into 3-5 groups of triggers so I just memorize those trigger
        groups. Once I've done that I time myself again and try to get the alg
        to sub-4 (you can substitute whatever time contraint you want here). I
        basically just do averages with that same alg until I get a sub-4 one,
        or if sub-4 is easy I try for sub-3 etc.. By that point you've probably
        done 50-60 repetitions of the alg and if you put the cube down and came
        back a day or two later you would still recall it. I did some research
        on memory and a lot of sources say that once something is in your short
        term memory, you will lose it (forget it) in 2-3 days. However, if at
        the end of those 2-3 days you rehearse that same thing (basically
        rememorize it, or think about it a lot), then you will remember it for
        maybe 3-6 more days. Then at the end of those 6 days rehearse again and
        you will remember it for a week or more. Then at the end of that week
        rehearse again and you will remember for a month, etc.. Of course at
        some point that information enters your procedural memory and you won't
        forget it unless you don't think about it for years (and sometimes not
        even then). So just rehearse it at the end of each memorization period.
        I mean that sounds kind of hoky and weird, but it really does work for
        me. Since I'm learning algs all the time, I'm always in the "rehearsal"
        stage for some cases at the same time that I'm in the "just learning for
        the first time" for others. So I sort of always am rehearsing something
        I learned 3 days, 6 days, 2 weeks, 1 month, a few months ago, etc. as
        well as learning new algs. I hope that makes some sense. I find this
        technique to work for learning quickly, meaning always learning new
        algs, and not forgetting what you've learned before. Chris --- In

        Fridrich is really an art form, ZB is just brute force solving and not

        Hey everyone, So yeah, I'm a self admitted calendar cube addict. I use
        my calendar cube everyday, and always change it with the day :-D It
        actually is a lot of fun! I thought of an interesting challenge for it.
        Trying to minimize the number of turns required to change each day
        (average for each month). You can take longer to solve the next day and
        also do some moves to prepare the day after that, but then again you
        can't do too much since you have to solve today in as few moves as
        possible. I also wonder if there is a distinct cube configuration for
        the beginning of each month such that every time you solve a day, the
        next day is setup very easily. It seems with some thought you could plan
        out this entire solution and just setup the cube that way at the
        beginning of each month with a regular Fridrich solve. So the first day
        of that month is say 50-55 moves (or you could FMC the solution on a
        regular cube and get it in even less) then each day after that is maybe
        5 or so. Not sure which the best way would be, but it's fun to try to
        turn something that seems at first to be simple into a more complicated
        puzzle. Does anyone else use the calendar cube, or try to minimize the
        moves required for each day change? Chris

        Hey Tom, I could relate when you say you thought you were good at 1:15
        and then it's kind of deflating stumbling across all these cube freaks
        here. Still, doing it at all, whether one minute or three, is impressive
        to any normal human. I could do the cube at about that fast when I
        stumbled in here; now at about 40 and having a lot more fun with it. I
        also never met another person who could do it at all until recently--
        and I used to live in Southern California where apparently there are
        more cubers than just about anywhere. Oh well. How do you go about
        solving it? Depending on what you do now, one of the methods out there
        may be easier to pick up... best, Kirk --- In

        Hey Rinie, you'll get overwhelmed very quickly if you try to go too fast
        learning all the stuff out there. Take it one step at a time. If you do
        a layer by layer approach, maybe start with learning/improving on the
        OLL and PLL algorithms that affect edges only or corners only. [sorry if
        you don't know what OLL or PLL is yet, but lots of sites can get you
        caught up on the terminology]. Basically, if you can flip the edges,
        then flip the corners, then re- arrange the edges, then the corners, you
        can do the last layer with confidence no matter what you get. After that
        feels fairly comfortable, then move on to some more last layer
        algorithms. Alternatively, if you're comfortable with how you're doing
        the last layer [assuming you do it that way], there's been a lot of talk
        here lately about the first 2 layers [F2L] and there's a lot of great
        tips on that out there. good luck, and welcome. I'd say the cube gets
        more fun the faster you get, and definitely a way to wow your friends
        [unless they're already in here], so it's worth putting in some time

        I've actively used this alg for about 5yrs now. Just checked LarsP's
        site, thought it might already have a name or something but guess not.
        The one that doesn't touch edge perm I can average 2.20s on. Just took
        22.04 for 10 executions. I preform it like this: LL on F, oriented
        corner on UFR (RU')F2(UR'U'R)F2(R'U) In full detail: (RU') F2[with right
        thumb downward twice] (UR'U'R)[start with right index; both R',R done
        with right thumb passively resting, U' done wiht left index] (F2)[same
        way] (R'U)[quick flick] Somewhere during the middle of this alg I do a
        rapid flick of my left wrist to guide the turns and angle the grip
        temporarily. It's truly a feelgood alg! :) Back from NY and there are a
        bit over 100 posts to catch up on.... -Doug --- In

        Chris, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is always interesting to see
        your posts about COLLs. &gt; &gt; &gt; Since there are not many CLL
        (COLL) &gt; ELL cubers, it is good chance &gt; &gt; &gt; for me to think
        my algs. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, I missed your old posts.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I used to use B L' U2 L B' L' B U2 B' L. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Probably one year ago, I changed this as similar to
        yours, but I do &gt; &gt; &gt; Alan (?) then anti-Sune(?). &gt; &gt;
        &gt; It is because of my recogition. &gt; &gt; &gt; I have to
        distinguish two cases. &gt; &gt; &gt; 1: L' U R U' L U R' &gt; &gt; &gt;
        2: L' U R U' L U R' - L U2 L' U' L U' L' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        If the recognition system is different, you may not be interested in.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; In regard to permution speed, I think I still can do
        faster with old &gt; &gt; &gt; alg. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        :-) Yes, I am. I don't like to steal your opportunity to find a solution
        yourself and feel good, successful and satisfied with yourself. That's
        why I always try to just give minimal hints, not a solution. &gt; If I

        understand *why* that algorithm works? If you do, I'm sure you could've
        found a solution to the 5x5 case yourself as well. Now try to find a
        different one than David gave you, more similar to your 4x4 alg :-) &gt;
        As a random question, it looks like the 5x5x5 doesn't come apart as &gt;
        easy as the 4x or 3x. Any suggestions from folks on best way to lube

        I'd also like to add something to this: The week before I did my 14.76
        average, I went on sort of a vacation, and I didnt have time to cube for
        about the week.. And that average came out pretty easy too, even though

        gilles ! I think going slow down can help you to anticipate pieces,
        particulary for F2L but I think it's for cubers who want to be sub 20
        and reach 17'. But when you reach 15' or 14' you'll definitivly be very
        fast !! Nico

        I usually use about 3 or 4 moves for changing the last digit so it takes
        a few more moves if it's going from the 29th to the 30th. For the day of
        the week, I usually just use an A-permutation because I don't want to

        change it with the day :-D It actually is a &gt; lot of fun! &gt; &gt; I
        thought of an interesting challenge for it. Trying to minimize the &gt;
        number of turns required to change each day (average for each month).
        &gt; You can take longer to solve the next day and also do some moves to
        &gt; prepare the day after that, but then again you can't do too much
        since &gt; you have to solve today in as few moves as possible. &gt;
        &gt; I also wonder if there is a distinct cube configuration for the
        &gt; beginning of each month such that every time you solve a day, the
        next &gt; day is setup very easily. It seems with some thought you could
        plan &gt; out this entire solution and just setup the cube that way at
        the &gt; beginning of each month with a regular Fridrich solve. So the
        first &gt; day of that month is say 50-55 moves (or you could FMC the
        solution on &gt; a regular cube and get it in even less) then each day
        after that is &gt; maybe 5 or so. &gt; &gt; Not sure which the best way
        would be, but it's fun to try to turn &gt; something that seems at first
        to be simple into a more complicated &gt; puzzle. &gt; &gt; Does anyone
        else use the calendar cube, or try to minimize the moves &gt; required

        I've always had trouble going slowly on the F2L or steps 1 and 2 of your
        method. Even if I try to go slowly on purpose, or cube quietly, it
        doesn't work. I've just trained myself to see the pieces at the slightly
        faster speed, and it's helped my F2L times a bunch. When I see the
        pieces, even while going quickly, my times are very good. With a good
        F2L, I can manage sub-20, no matter how difficult my last layer is. For
        most solves, I use F2L, orient edges, orient corners, PLL. However,
        there are 4 PLL cases I've never bothered to learn. The cases which
        cycle 3 edges and 3 corners each I do in two steps. Even so, because of
        good F2L's, I've gotten several 18.xx's on these cases. I read about all
        of these people averaging 45+ on the groups who already know all of the
        OLL's and PLL's. It seems like a waste of effort to me. The F2L is
        really where to get faster, at least initially. And I don't think anyone
        needs necessarily to go slowly, just learn to recognize pieces at your
        comfortable speed. -Mike Bennett ----- Original Message ----- From:

        Ok.. Now people are giving their opinions about going slow or fast
        during F2L. Of course, speed is the ultimate goal, but you can't reach
        that goal by telling a newbie to try to go as fast as possible. In that
        case, it will be counter productive. I'd like to quote my site on this
        subject: ----------QUOTE------------ Speedcubing videos might give you
        the impression that speedcubing is all about speed. But that's not true.
        In my opinion, speedcubing is all about finding a balance between
        fluency and speed. You should not focus on speed to much. It's more
        important to work on your technique. The speed will come naturally. When
        I am having a bad cubing day, one of the things that helps me to get
        better times is telling myself to slow down. The idea is not to solve
        the cube at full speed (especially the F2L), but to go a little slower
        instead. This will enable you to watch the pieces, and it gives you time
        to look ahead. When you are solving a 'sub-problem', you can try to
        figure out what your next step is going to be. For people that use
        Fridrich, this means that when you are inserting a corner edge pair, you
        should have already spotted the next pair. Also, after finishing the
        cross, you should at least have a general idea about where your first
        corner edge pair is. The goal of looking ahead this way is that you can
        solve the cube without, or with only very small delays between
        algorithms. If you don't believe me, just time yourself, while aiming at
        your normal average plus 5 or 10 seconds (this will probably work for
        most people who average around 17-30 seconds). You will see it's not
        that hard to do that. Do about 10 of those very slow solves, and try to
        look ahead while doing this. Now, slowly accelerate to your normal
        times. I hope you'll find that rushing through a solve like a mad man it
        completely unnecessary, and that you can have the same (or even better)
        results by slowing down just a little bit. One last thing: It's a good
        idea to solve the last layer at full speeds, because when solving the
        Last Layer, it's almost impossible to look ahead. It's also a good idea
        to practice solving all different steps at full speed, because you
        should be able to do them without thinking. Of course, I am not telling
        you to go slow, just go as fast as you can without making mistakes, and
        without big delays between algorithms. ----------QUOTE------------ ---

        slowly on the F2L or steps 1 and 2 of your method. Even if I try to go
        slowly on purpose, or cube quietly, it doesn't work. I've just trained
        myself to see the pieces at the slightly faster speed, and it's helped
        my F2L times a bunch. When I see the pieces, even while going quickly,
        my times are very good. &gt; &gt; With a good F2L, I can manage sub-20,
        no matter how difficult my last layer is. For most solves, I use F2L,
        orient edges, orient corners, PLL. However, there are 4 PLL cases I've
        never bothered to learn. The cases which cycle 3 edges and 3 corners
        each I do in two steps. Even so, because of good F2L's, I've gotten
        several 18.xx's on these cases. &gt; &gt; I read about all of these
        people averaging 45+ on the groups who already know all of the OLL's and
        PLL's. It seems like a waste of effort to me. The F2L is really where to
        get faster, at least initially. And I don't think anyone needs
        necessarily to go slowly, just learn to recognize pieces at your
        comfortable speed. &gt; &gt; -Mike Bennett &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original

        &gt; &gt; When I have a bad day (neurons not working together, acting

        I &gt; agree. &gt; But when I feel great, I don't have to take care
        about solving &gt; slowly, because turn speed is automatically
        regulated, driven by the &gt; anticipation possibilities. &gt; &gt; I

        "It's all about F2L." - Shotaro Makisumi Really, all cubers should learn
        F2L first in my opinion. The reason is that OLL and PLL algorithms don't
        take time to "master". There's not nearly as much finesse and decision
        making in the LL as there is in the F2L. The LL is all about just
        execution of the algorithm, and to a smaller extent, recognizing which
        case it is. In the F2L, you have to deal with execution, but also being
        able to find the next pair. Also, sometimes knowing to do one pair first
        will set you up nicely for the next pair, or sometimes you'll know that
        for a certain algorithm if the 3 of the last layer edges are yellow,
        then you can get all the edges oriented, just things like that. Learn
        the F2L. Remember, there's no way to average sub-20 if your F2L takes 18
        seconds. Focus on getting F2L down because that's really what accounts
        for your times. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On

        &gt; So yeah, I'm a self admitted calendar cube addict. I use my
        calendar &gt; &gt; cube everyday, and always change it with the day :-D
        It actually is a &gt; &gt; lot of fun! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I thought of
        an interesting challenge for it. Trying to minimize the &gt; &gt; number
        of turns required to change each day (average for each month). &gt; &gt;
        You can take longer to solve the next day and also do some moves to &gt;
        &gt; prepare the day after that, but then again you can't do too much
        since &gt; &gt; you have to solve today in as few moves as possible.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also wonder if there is a distinct cube
        configuration for the &gt; &gt; beginning of each month such that every
        time you solve a day, the next &gt; &gt; day is setup very easily. It
        seems with some thought you could plan &gt; &gt; out this entire
        solution and just setup the cube that way at the &gt; &gt; beginning of
        each month with a regular Fridrich solve. So the first &gt; &gt; day of
        that month is say 50-55 moves (or you could FMC the solution on &gt;
        &gt; a regular cube and get it in even less) then each day after that is
        &gt; &gt; maybe 5 or so. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure which the best way
        would be, but it's fun to try to turn &gt; &gt; something that seems at
        first to be simple into a more complicated &gt; &gt; puzzle. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Does anyone else use the calendar cube, or try to minimize the
        moves &gt; &gt; required for each day change? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris

        I also use F2L, orient edges, orient corners, PLL. And I also use a
        combination of two PLL algs for the PLL cases which cycle 3 edges and 3
        corners. Actually, only for 2 of the 4, I have learnt the alg + mirror
        for one of the pairs. I think of these four PLL cases as two pairs of
        cases. Anyway, my point in saying this is that this makes me feel really
        slow! ;) I use pretty much the same method as Mike and I average ~36-37
        seconds. I've never done a sub-20s solve and I only occasionally get
        sub-30s times! I feel like I must be missing something fundamental. All
        the 3-LL solvers are faster than me!! Even on what felt like my most
        perfectly executed non-lucky solve, it was 23s. I just can't imagine
        ever getting sub-20s!! I've been on this group for several years now, so
        I think I've read just about every tip that anyone's ever offered, so in
        theory I know how I should be able to get faster, but I'm just not
        there. Maybe I just don't practice enough?? Having said all this, I
        guess I should keep in mind that my average was well over a minute when
        I first joined this group, so I have made *some* progress. :) Jasmine

        never bothered to learn. The cases which cycle 3 edges and 3 corners
        each I do in two steps. Even so, because of good F2L's, I've gotten
        several 18.xx's on these cases. &gt; &gt; I read about all of these
        people averaging 45+ on the groups who already know all of the OLL's and
        PLL's. It seems like a waste of effort to me. The F2L is really where to
        get faster, at least initially. And I don't think anyone needs
        necessarily to go slowly, just learn to recognize pieces at your
        comfortable speed. &gt; &gt; -Mike Bennett &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mmhh.. maybe.. maybe not.. I was not that slow :-)
        &gt; &gt; When I have a bad day (neurons not working together, acting
        like &gt; brakes), slowing down helps preventing disasters or bad times,
        I &gt; agree. &gt; But when I feel great, I don't have to take care
        about solving &gt; slowly, because turn speed is automatically
        regulated, driven by the &gt; anticipation possibilities. &gt; &gt; I
        often heard people telling you have to slow down if you want to be &gt;
        consistent, but it never really worked for me, when I was a beginner
        &gt; or now. &gt; What about you? &gt; &gt; Gilles. &gt; &gt; &gt; ---

        Hi :-) There's no need to take apart a puzzle in order to lube it. I bet
        as good as 100% of all sprays these days come with a narrow long tube
        for spraying. If so u only need a little gap (which u make easily) to
        get the silicone inside. Spray into the puzzle from various locations
        around the cube. Then work it in by playing about with the cube a
        little. If it's first time u lube it u can repeat this a few times more.
        After working it in for the last time u can leave the puzzle couple of
        hrs before testing it again. (U might need a tissue to wipe off silicone
        on the outside of the puzzle.) But actually i recommend for the
        rubiks.com 5x5x5 that u wait quite a while before lubing it first time.
        It will "wear down" faster i guess without the lube inside. I normally
        wait at least a few weeks before lubing those 5x5x5 cubes. With
        eastsheen (mini) cubes u can lube straight away. But only a very little
        amount will be needed. I recommend never to take apart those eastsheen
        cubes. They become loose easily. The only real good reason to take apart
        rubiks.com 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 is to check cubies for irregularities that u
        can remove with a sharp knife or other sharp tool. Good luck :-) -Per

        I don't know about that - I hardly cube at all but after I saw your
        message I did a bit of cubing. I got a 47 and a 27 and some 30s. 47 was
        worse than useless, 27 was pretty good but lucky (amazingly I didn't
        have to PLL which happens maybe once in a year so that's me done for
        2005). I'd have to say it was generally well below that level for which
        I might have hoped. I found that some of the strings in my mind like
        LU2F'L'U'LUF2U2F'L' didn't come to mind too easily either and
        RU2R2FRF'U2R'FRF' (in fact, I think I might have had that in the 47s one
        and I was thinking FR'F' and having to undo it. My fingers tripped over
        each other a lot too. I did get a 30 a bit later which was the best
        non-lucky time but I don't know about that abstinence resulting in
        faster times hypothesis. I'm sure once a long time ago I could have hit
        29s or maybe even 28s at least once and may have got into the 32-34s
        with some regularity.

        Hey everyone, I've been really doing some thinking about my F2L lately,
        and came up with a cool new technique that I really like, and that I
        think has very general applications. Obviously for ZBF2L I really have
        to focus on the LL edges while solving the 4th pair, but I find it to be
        very hard to be thrust into this F2L case + LL edges case right after
        the 3rd pair. So what I've started doing is to mentally focus only on
        the LL edges while solving F2L. This is kinda cool, since it means I
        have an idea the whole time what the LL edges are doing, sometimes I get
        most of them oriented for one pair, only to flip them later, etc.. I'm
        starting to get a feel for which F2L algs flip the LL edges a lot, and
        which ones are more preserving. Anyway this makes the F2L itself a
        little easier. I know that sounds weird, but since you are mentally
        focusing on your LL color only, the F2L pieces really stand out as
        "wrong" or "weird" since they don't have the LL color. It's weird, but
        my F2L is actually pretty smooth this way, plus the transition from 3rd
        pair to 4th pair ZBF2L is easier since I have been thinking about the LL
        edges the whole time and am not suddenly thrust into this hard case. So
        anyway I don't know if anyone has ever tried F2L while focusing on LL
        edges, it's sort of an inverted way of thinking, but it really makes the
        F2L pieces stand out. Just wanted to post, it seems to be helping me
        specifically for ZBF2L, but I also am getting some nice standard F2L
        solves when I try it. Try it and see what you think! Chris

        I am a 3-look LL solver too, I average around 32s - and I agree it's all
        about the F2L. I am constantly trying to make mine faster. Anyway,
        another good thing that might help is to time each part of your
        solution, ie cross, finishing F2L, edges, corners, PLL. When I was
        averaging in the 40's, it helped me realize my cross should be faster,
        and I worked on that a little bit more. As far as F2L goes, I still
        haven't seen how slowing down helps but there are other things to look
        at such as using empty slots, inserting pairs from any angle, finding
        the next pair before the one youre working on is finished, etc I'm sure
        if you work at it you can get your average down to around 30s rather
        quickly, cuz I've only been cubing for 5-6 months - and you seem to have
        more experience :) Bryan Mytko bryanosaurus@... On Jul 27, 2005, at 2:03

        of the 4, I have learnt the alg + &gt; mirror for one of the pairs. I
        think of these four PLL cases as two &gt; pairs of cases. &gt; &gt;
        Anyway, my point in saying this is that this makes me feel really &gt;
        slow! ;) I use pretty much the same method as Mike and I average &gt;
        ~36-37 seconds. I've never done a sub-20s solve and I only &gt;
        occasionally get sub-30s times! &gt; &gt; I feel like I must be missing
        something fundamental. All the 3-LL &gt; solvers are faster than me!!
        Even on what felt like my most perfectly &gt; executed non-lucky solve,
        it was 23s. I just can't imagine ever &gt; getting sub-20s!! &gt; &gt;
        I've been on this group for several years now, so I think I've read &gt;
        just about every tip that anyone's ever offered, so in theory I know
        &gt; how I should be able to get faster, but I'm just not there. Maybe I
        &gt; just don't practice enough?? &gt; &gt; Having said all this, I
        guess I should keep in mind that my average &gt; was well over a minute
        when I first joined this group, so I have made &gt; *some* progress. :)

        The cases which cycle 3 edges and 3 corners each I do in two &gt; steps.

        averaging 45+ on the groups who &gt; already know all of the OLL's and

        maybe.. maybe not.. I was not that slow :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I
        have a bad day (neurons not working together, acting like &gt; &gt;
        brakes), slowing down helps preventing disasters or bad times, I &gt;
        &gt; agree. &gt; &gt; But when I feel great, I don't have to take care
        about solving &gt; &gt; slowly, because turn speed is automatically
        regulated, driven &gt; by the &gt; &gt; anticipation possibilities. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I often heard people telling you have to slow down if you
        want &gt; to be &gt; &gt; consistent, but it never really worked for me,

        I have a method that's been strictly in the planning stages. I'd like to
        share it with everyone, in hopes of refining it further, and getting
        useful feedback. It goes as follows: 1. Cube Shape 2. Solve D corners
        (forcing U-D corner seperation) 3. Seperate Edges+Permute U corners

        I think that square-1 still has a long way to go until we approach an
        optimal solution. But this does look to me like it might be able to
        contend (I don't know what Lars V's method is, though.) &gt; 1. Cube
        Shape Obviously, the best way to do this step is to memorize how to
        solve from any shape, but I don't know what you're going to do about
        this. I only know two good methods for returning to a cube. One is to
        gather 6 corners on one side, then you only have about 5 or 6 cases to
        memorize. The other is to gather exactly 4 corners on the top side. This
        leaves 4 edges on the top and the same on the bottom. Limits the number
        of cases you have to know. &gt; 2. Solve D corners (forcing U-D corner
        seperation) Both getting corners on their right layer and permuting them
        take very few twists, so this should be fast. &gt; 3. Seperate
        Edges+Permute U corners I'm not sure what the actual move counts would
        be for this, but it seems like it would be more efficient to solve all
        corners at once. 50%, I think, of the time you can do it with 3 twists.
        &gt; 4. Permute edges Lots of cases for this, but I think it could get
        pretty fast. I'm wondering what you plan to do about parity? Doubles the
        number of algorithms if you include algorithms for all parities. But
        pushes the time way up if you don't. &gt; From what I can tell, this
        method has a manageable number of cases &gt; if learned completely. I
        estimate possible average for this at &gt; sub20. Let me know what you
        think. I'm actually planning my own square-1 method right now. Mine
        would go like this: 1. Cube shape. Either learning all cases or using
        one of the methods I described above. 2. Get colors on the correct
        layers Initially I may split this up into corners then edges (that's
        what i do right now). I'm thinking (I haven't looked into it seriously,
        but) probably less than 30 algorithms for this step when combined. 3.
        Solve corners. Really easy step. Only about 8 algorithms for this. And
        like I said above, half the time, it's really really fast. 4. Solve
        edges. Maybe someday, all in one step, but initially, find the fastest
        edge parity swap and use it when there is a parity issue. Since there
        are algorithms for all the even parity cases, this should add very
        little time. I don't know how many cases there would be, but I think if
        we add parity into the algorithms, this may be comparable to the LL on
        the 3-cube. Sorry about the long post. I have strong opinions about
        speedsolving the square-1. I think if I knew as many algorithms for
        square1 as I did for the cube, I'd be faster than Lars. I am glad to see
        that lately, a lot more people are learning the square-1 and pushing the
        limits, hopefully past what has been done by Lars. By the way, I think
        we need to get some three letter acronyms for these steps like they have
        for the cube. (PLL, CLL, F2L, etc...) -Ben.

        I've wondered about this since starting partial edge control a while
        ago. Recently, I've taken to using COLL as often as possible, so having
        properly oriented edges when I get to the LL helps quite a bit. It's
        often the difference between sub-20 and not sub-20 for me. Lately, I've
        been focusing on the LL edge pieces during the entire F2L, preserving
        them when possible, but generally keeping an eye on them. At very least,
        it helps me to know how many and which I'll need to flip come 4th
        corner/edge pair or beginning of LL. Generally, I don't know very many
        alternate algorithms for edge preserving, but it still helps to know
        where I'll end up a bit earlier. Hopefully, in the relatively near
        future, I'll learn the rest of the case 2 for the ZBF2L algs you've
        compiled. That ought to help me out immensely. We'll soon see. -Mike

        5:19 PM Subject: [Speed cubing group] New F2L idea/approach (well, maybe
        new) Hey everyone, I've been really doing some thinking about my F2L
        lately, and came up with a cool new technique that I really like, and
        that I think has very general applications. Obviously for ZBF2L I really
        have to focus on the LL edges while solving the 4th pair, but I find it
        to be very hard to be thrust into this F2L case + LL edges case right
        after the 3rd pair. So what I've started doing is to mentally focus only
        on the LL edges while solving F2L. This is kinda cool, since it means I
        have an idea the whole time what the LL edges are doing, sometimes I get
        most of them oriented for one pair, only to flip them later, etc.. I'm
        starting to get a feel for which F2L algs flip the LL edges a lot, and
        which ones are more preserving. Anyway this makes the F2L itself a
        little easier. I know that sounds weird, but since you are mentally
        focusing on your LL color only, the F2L pieces really stand out as
        "wrong" or "weird" since they don't have the LL color. It's weird, but
        my F2L is actually pretty smooth this way, plus the transition from 3rd
        pair to 4th pair ZBF2L is easier since I have been thinking about the LL
        edges the whole time and am not suddenly thrust into this hard case. So
        anyway I don't know if anyone has ever tried F2L while focusing on LL
        edges, it's sort of an inverted way of thinking, but it really makes the
        F2L pieces stand out. Just wanted to post, it seems to be helping me
        specifically for ZBF2L, but I also am getting some nice standard F2L
        solves when I try it. Try it and see what you think! Chris SPONSORED

        nice guys. its cool to think of solving the bottom first so that your
        eyes are on the top layer when you finally permute. as for me im doing
        the opposite lol i solve the top first. 1.top corners. 2. top edges 3.
        permute everything at once on the bottom / fix odd parity if needed. my
        best time for the square-1 is 20.81 sec. done at the orange county fair.
        i guess it was kinda lucky the top layer was done pretty quick :-D
        mostly i range in the 40s --- Ben King &lt;grsbmd@...&gt; wrote: &gt; I
        think that square-1 still has a long way to go &gt; until we approach an
        &gt; optimal solution. But this does look to me like it &gt; might be
        able to &gt; contend (I don't know what Lars V's method is, &gt;
        though.) &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Cube Shape &gt; &gt; Obviously, the best way
        to do this step is to &gt; memorize how to solve &gt; from any shape,
        but I don't know what you're going &gt; to do about this. &gt; I only
        know two good methods for returning to a &gt; cube. One is to &gt;
        gather 6 corners on one side, then you only have &gt; about 5 or 6 cases
        &gt; to memorize. The other is to gather exactly 4 &gt; corners on the
        top &gt; side. This leaves 4 edges on the top and the same &gt; on the
        bottom. &gt; Limits the number of cases you have to know. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        2. Solve D corners (forcing U-D corner &gt; seperation) &gt; &gt; Both
        getting corners on their right layer and &gt; permuting them take &gt;
        very few twists, so this should be fast. &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Seperate
        Edges+Permute U corners &gt; &gt; I'm not sure what the actual move
        counts would be &gt; for this, but it &gt; seems like it would be more
        efficient to solve all &gt; corners at once. &gt; 50%, I think, of the
        time you can do it with 3 &gt; twists. &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Permute edges
        &gt; &gt; Lots of cases for this, but I think it could get &gt; pretty
        fast. I'm &gt; wondering what you plan to do about parity? Doubles &gt;
        the number of &gt; algorithms if you include algorithms for all &gt;
        parities. But pushes &gt; the time way up if you don't. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        From what I can tell, this method has a manageable &gt; number of cases
        &gt; &gt; if learned completely. I estimate possible &gt; average for
        this at &gt; &gt; sub20. Let me know what you think. &gt; &gt; I'm
        actually planning my own square-1 method right &gt; now. Mine would &gt;
        go like this: &gt; &gt; 1. Cube shape. &gt; &gt; Either learning all
        cases or using one of the &gt; methods I described &gt; above. &gt; &gt;
        2. Get colors on the correct layers &gt; &gt; Initially I may split this
        up into corners then &gt; edges (that's what i &gt; do right now). I'm
        thinking (I haven't looked into &gt; it seriously, &gt; but) probably
        less than 30 algorithms for this step &gt; when combined. &gt; &gt; 3.
        Solve corners. &gt; &gt; Really easy step. Only about 8 algorithms for
        this. &gt; And like I said &gt; above, half the time, it's really really
        fast. &gt; &gt; 4. Solve edges. &gt; &gt; Maybe someday, all in one
        step, but initially, find &gt; the fastest edge &gt; parity swap and use
        it when there is a parity issue. &gt; Since there are &gt; algorithms
        for all the even parity cases, this &gt; should add very little &gt;
        time. I don't know how many cases there would be, &gt; but I think if we
        &gt; add parity into the algorithms, this may be &gt; comparable to the
        LL on &gt; the 3-cube. &gt; &gt; Sorry about the long post. I have
        strong opinions &gt; about speedsolving &gt; the square-1. I think if I
        knew as many algorithms &gt; for square1 as I &gt; did for the cube, I'd
        be faster than Lars. I am &gt; glad to see that &gt; lately, a lot more
        people are learning the square-1 &gt; and pushing the &gt; limits,
        hopefully past what has been done by Lars. &gt; &gt; By the way, I think
        we need to get some three letter &gt; acronyms for &gt; these steps like
        they have for the cube. (PLL, CLL, &gt; F2L, etc...) &gt; &gt; -Ben.

        I teach either a very simple corners first method or a very simple layer
        by layer method, depending on whether they see corners or edges easier
        at first. For the corners, I teach them how to solve four on a side
        intuitively, and then one corner permuter and the Sune/antisune. Then I
        teach them simple commutators to solve the pieces on one side, followed
        by two different 3 cycles and some edge flippers to orient. It's
        probably 7 easy algorithms total. Takes a couple of hours, though. For
        people who can see edges easier, I teach them how to solve the cross on
        top, generally using the 'put the piece directly below where it needs to
        be' approach. Two cases. Then come the U layer corners. Three cases.
        Then I teach them how to solve middle layer edges (cross side is now on
        bottom). Two algorithms that are very simple and only a single '
        different. Then comes working corners, if they are doing well. This is
        followed by two cases for edge orienting. Then comes the corner
        permuter, same as above. Next is the Sune/antisune. Then, I teach a
        simple 3 cycle and its reverse. Including working corners, I taught the
        latter method to someone in just over an hour, and she was watching a
        movie at the time. She has since moved on to a 3 look LL and the F2L,
        and averages under 30, with very little effort. I've also taught it to a
        couple of people that have taken several hour or longer sessions and are
        still very beginner. It all depends on the student and how much they
        want to improve. -Mike Bennett ----- Original Message ----- From: Sachin

        Yes. Look under my files section in cubewhiz.com. It is written in Java,
        however, there is no user interface. You must run it in DOS and have
        Java installed on your computer. Cube1 gives the number in scientific
        notation and Cube2 gives the number written out in expanded form. The
        program will give the number of combinations for any cube of size n=2 to
        n=100. ~ Bob --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, klcandyman

        Wow, good memory. Hem, since not many people like it, it would go under
        your Step 5+6 list, I seem to have the fastest execution of it, and have
        been using it for so long... maybe you can name it the "Doug" after me
        :) on your site. I've really grown a liking to your naming scheme. This
        week I started calling the "Buffy" by that name. I take a bit longer on
        the mirror (not sure why, but I never do the inverse), and do it like
        this: L'UF2U'LUL'F2LU', the L's I do with my left hand (lots of
        supporting fingers), U with right index, U' with right thumb, and F2
        with right thumb downward twice. Nowhere is there a genuine trigger,
        each move is pretty much individual, so it's suprising how I can still
        be fairly fast with it. Though in actuality I might be using r and r'
        instead of the L turns... hard to tell, depends on my mood. I just tried
        the inverse a few times (of the original) and I really like it, I think
        I can go much faster with it than this mirror I just listed. It solves
        the same case. Looks like it's time to change a 5yr old habit and
        covert... come to think of it, the only reason I can do the trigger-less
        mirror (I'm not as dexterous with my Left hand as most cubers out there)
        so fast is probably only due to necessity over the yrs. -Doug --- In

        Hi Chris, This is a bit like how I think for the F2L. When working on
        F2L pairs, my focus is actually on looking for pieces that don't have
        yellow (yellow is always my LL face). I find this much easier than
        trying to focus on five different F2L colours. It also makes it less
        difficult switching between a White/Yellow cube (my usual colour scheme)
        and a White/Blue cube. If someone hands me a White/Blue cube, then
        during the F2L I just think to myself 'focus on non-blue'. What I'm not
        doing, which you have obviously started to do, is pay attention to what
        is actually happening to the LL edges during the F2L. I might try giving
        this a go sometimes, although I imagine you'd only get the full benefit
        of it if learning ZB or VH, both of which are too advanced for me at the
        moment!! :) Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com --- In

        wrote: &gt; Hey everyone, &gt; &gt; I've been really doing some thinking
        about my F2L lately, and came up &gt; with a cool new technique that I
        really like, and that I think has &gt; very general applications. &gt;
        &gt; Obviously for ZBF2L I really have to focus on the LL edges while
        &gt; solving the 4th pair, but I find it to be very hard to be thrust
        into &gt; this F2L case + LL edges case right after the 3rd pair. &gt;
        &gt; So what I've started doing is to mentally focus only on the LL
        edges &gt; while solving F2L. This is kinda cool, since it means I have
        an idea &gt; the whole time what the LL edges are doing, sometimes I get
        most of &gt; them oriented for one pair, only to flip them later, etc..
        I'm &gt; starting to get a feel for which F2L algs flip the LL edges a
        lot, and &gt; which ones are more preserving. &gt; &gt; Anyway this
        makes the F2L itself a little easier. I know that sounds &gt; weird, but
        since you are mentally focusing on your LL color only, the &gt; F2L
        pieces really stand out as "wrong" or "weird" since they don't &gt; have
        the LL color. &gt; &gt; It's weird, but my F2L is actually pretty smooth
        this way, plus the &gt; transition from 3rd pair to 4th pair ZBF2L is
        easier since I have been &gt; thinking about the LL edges the whole time
        and am not suddenly thrust &gt; into this hard case. &gt; &gt; So anyway
        I don't know if anyone has ever tried F2L while focusing on &gt; LL
        edges, it's sort of an inverted way of thinking, but it really &gt;
        makes the F2L pieces stand out. &gt; &gt; Just wanted to post, it seems
        to be helping me specifically for ZBF2L, &gt; but I also am getting some
        nice standard F2L solves when I try it. &gt; &gt; Try it and see what
        you think! &gt; Chris

        I'm curious how much work it would take to learn a few simple algs that
        help with corner positioning. I managed to insert my final edge pair on
        a solve last night in such a way that it correctly oriented my corners,
        and I did it on purpose. It was entirely accidental that it happened to
        permute them correctly, too. But getting the Z perm after a fantastic
        F2L+LL edges just felt great. The fact that it was a 16.45 didn't hurt,
        either. If anyone knows more about this, please let me know. It's
        something I'd like to look into. -Mike Bennett ----- Original Message

        New F2L idea/approach (well, maybe new) Hi Chris, This is a bit like how
        I think for the F2L. When working on F2L pairs, my focus is actually on
        looking for pieces that don't have yellow (yellow is always my LL face).
        I find this much easier than trying to focus on five different F2L
        colours. It also makes it less difficult switching between a
        White/Yellow cube (my usual colour scheme) and a White/Blue cube. If
        someone hands me a White/Blue cube, then during the F2L I just think to
        myself 'focus on non-blue'. What I'm not doing, which you have obviously
        started to do, is pay attention to what is actually happening to the LL
        edges during the F2L. I might try giving this a go sometimes, although I
        imagine you'd only get the full benefit of it if learning ZB or VH, both
        of which are too advanced for me at the moment!! :) Jasmine

        wrote: &gt; Hey everyone, &gt; &gt; I've been really doing some thinking
        about my F2L lately, and came up &gt; with a cool new technique that I
        really like, and that I think has &gt; very general applications. &gt;
        &gt; Obviously for ZBF2L I really have to focus on the LL edges while
        &gt; solving the 4th pair, but I find it to be very hard to be thrust
        into &gt; this F2L case + LL edges case right after the 3rd pair. &gt;
        &gt; So what I've started doing is to mentally focus only on the LL
        edges &gt; while solving F2L. This is kinda cool, since it means I have
        an idea &gt; the whole time what the LL edges are doing, sometimes I get
        most of &gt; them oriented for one pair, only to flip them later, etc..
        I'm &gt; starting to get a feel for which F2L algs flip the LL edges a
        lot, and &gt; which ones are more preserving. &gt; &gt; Anyway this
        makes the F2L itself a little easier. I know that sounds &gt; weird, but
        since you are mentally focusing on your LL color only, the &gt; F2L
        pieces really stand out as "wrong" or "weird" since they don't &gt; have
        the LL color. &gt; &gt; It's weird, but my F2L is actually pretty smooth
        this way, plus the &gt; transition from 3rd pair to 4th pair ZBF2L is
        easier since I have been &gt; thinking about the LL edges the whole time
        and am not suddenly thrust &gt; into this hard case. &gt; &gt; So anyway
        I don't know if anyone has ever tried F2L while focusing on &gt; LL
        edges, it's sort of an inverted way of thinking, but it really &gt;
        makes the F2L pieces stand out. &gt; &gt; Just wanted to post, it seems
        to be helping me specifically for ZBF2L, &gt; but I also am getting some
        nice standard F2L solves when I try it. &gt; &gt; Try it and see what
        you think! &gt; Chris

        Hi Tyson, Put bag over your head with a drawstring closure? Why not use
        something like an opaque sneeze guard? Solve it on the other side of a
        door hanging sideways in front to you? Sit normally at a desk, put your
        head on top of the desk and solve it between your legs. Solve it inside
        a tube, like a paper bag with no bottom. Camera on you and down the
        tube. Hmmm...cube tubing. Turn the lights off and videotape it in the
        dark in infrared. A Sony handycam with night shot can do that. DJ --- In

        really impressed if you turned it over so we could see the other solved
        sides!

        That's all well and good, I was able to figure that much the first try.
        It seemed that after an hr on it I had only placed one number (the 6).
        But I eventrually got two boxes/regions. But then I got to the following
        point and haven't been able to proceed for over a week. . 2 6 * . . 7 *
        . . 8 8 9 5 * 6 2 . * . 7 3 . 7 4 * . 8 . * . . . * * * * * * * * * * *
        4 5 7 * 1 9 3 * 8 6 2 9 8 3 * 2 4 6 * 5 1 7 6 1 2 * 5 7 8 * . . 4 * * *
        * * * * * * * * 2 . 9 * . 1 . * 7 8 . 5 4 8 * 7 . 9 * . . . 7 . 1 * 8 .
        2 * . 4 . Kinda wierd one can still get stuck after getting two boxes,
        one column, and two rows... Well I've been staring at this for a rather
        long time. I do know that (3,7) is one of 1,2,6,9; that (3,8) is one of
        2,5,9; and that (3,9) is one of 1,6,9. (1,7) can be one of 1,4,9. Well
        anyways I'm lost. Also I'm what is known as a "logical-purist" so I
        won't be satisfied with trial-error and stuff like that... (though in my
        math classes I do proof-by-contratdicton all the time). Well I found the
        solution using trial/error, but I'm very much displeased by it, since I
        was able to convince myself of uniqueness in addition to existance,
        there much be a better way. Probably a method I don't know about. I
        started tring out ways of symutaneously placing all of a certain number.
        I noted that 5 had two different possiblities (placing one (in 1 of 2
        spots in a row/col/box) would place force all others). -Doug --- In

        can't solve it without &gt; &gt; &gt; trial-and-error... &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; -Bram &gt; &gt; This is a bit OT for cubing but anyway,
        here's the first few steps (to get the first 7 cells in). &gt; It's
        still difficult after this so there's still a challenge left but it
        still doesn't need any trial &amp; &gt; error. &gt; Initial Grid:
        (above) &gt; For convenience label rows R1 to R9 (downwards), columns
        C1-C9 (left to right), boxes &gt; B1-B9 (right then down). &gt; &gt; 1.
        The intersection of R1 and C3 contains 6 (it is the only square in B1
        that can contain a &gt; 6). &gt; &gt; *26|***|*** &gt; ***|6**|**3 &gt;
        *74|*8*|*** &gt; ------------------ &gt; ***|**3|**2 &gt; *8*|*4*|*1*
        &gt; 6**|5**|*** &gt; ------------------ &gt; ***|*1*|78* &gt;
        5**|**9|*** &gt; ***|***|*4* &gt; &gt; 2. In C9, 4,7 and 8 cannot go
        into R3 or B9, leaving only the intersections with R1, R5 and &gt; R6.
        In particular, R5 already contains 4 and 8 so the intersection of C9 and
        R5 must &gt; contain 7. &gt; &gt; *26|***|*** &gt; ***|6**|**3 &gt;
        *74|*8*|*** &gt; ------------------ &gt; ***|**3|**2 &gt; *8*|*4*|*17
        &gt; 6**|5**|*** &gt; ------------------ &gt; ***|*1*|78* &gt;
        5**|**9|*** &gt; ***|***|*4* &gt; &gt; 3. In B5, 1 and 8 must appear on
        the leading diagonal as they are already present in C5 &gt; and R5. Thus
        since 7 is in R5, 7 must occur in the intersection of B5 and C5. In
        particular &gt; in C5, 4,7 and 8 appear before B8. Thus in R8 4,7,8 must
        occur in C2-C4 and hence 4 lies &gt; in the intersection of C2 and R8.
        &gt; &gt; *26|***|*** &gt; ***|6**|**3 &gt; *74|*8*|*** &gt;
        ------------------ &gt; ***|**3|**2 &gt; *8*|*4*|*17 &gt; 6**|5**|***
        &gt; ------------------ &gt; ***|*1*|78* &gt; 54*|**9|*** &gt;
        ***|***|*4* &gt; &gt; 4. Thus in B4, 4 goes in the intersection of R4
        and C1. &gt; &gt; *26|***|*** &gt; ***|6**|**3 &gt; *74|*8*|*** &gt;
        ------------------ &gt; 4**|**3|**2 &gt; *8*|*4*|*17 &gt; 6**|5**|***
        &gt; ------------------ &gt; ***|*1*|78* &gt; 54*|**9|*** &gt;
        ***|***|*4* &gt; &gt; 5. Thus in C1, 7 must go in R9. &gt; &gt;
        *26|***|*** &gt; ***|6**|**3 &gt; *74|*8*|*** &gt; ------------------
        &gt; 4**|**3|**2 &gt; *8*|*4*|*17 &gt; 6**|5**|*** &gt;
        ------------------ &gt; ***|*1*|78* &gt; 54*|**9|*** &gt; 7**|***|*4*
        &gt; &gt; 6. Recalling that in R8, C2-C4 contain 4,7 and 8, 8 must go in
        C3 (because B7 contains &gt; 4,7) and so 7 in C4. &gt; &gt; *26|***|***
        &gt; ***|6**|**3 &gt; *74|*8*|*** &gt; ------------------ &gt;
        4**|**3|**2 &gt; *8*|*4*|*17 &gt; 6**|5**|*** &gt; ------------------

        That's a great quote! I need to put it on a huge banner in my new
        apartment, and get a shirt or mug with it on. It one of those things
        only uber geeks would understand :). I've been learning so much ZBLL,
        specialized CLL, doing ELLs from different angles... I've neglected F2L
        too much. All the ZBLL I know is so useless without a good number of
        ZBF2L to support them. My times have grown increasingly inconsistant
        once again. I switched to a 25th anniversary cube about a month ago and
        notcied that my standard deviation dropped like a rock (to like 1.5), my
        mean dropped slightly too. But with the special cases I've started
        actively using my SD has risen again. A few days ago I got a 10.32 solve
        and these sub-15s are becomming more frequent. However I now get a bunch
        of &gt;30s solves as well. I take a long time during recognition...
        there's a lot to see between steps. Dispite having plenty of experience
        doing COLL recognition... Recalling those ZBF2L cases is pretty painful
        and gives at least a 2s pause. &gt;From my best RA of 22.16 this summer,
        my times avarage 25s again. But I'm not particularly sad about it. I
        really enjoy taking these weeks to (re)learn F2L. A few of my algs have
        changed too. I caught a new COLL alg from BobB, and I'm getting an all
        time high on the percentage of getting good LL edges. It's kinda cool
        how my internal alg set/repitoure changes a little bit every week (when
        I'm active), swapped out three COLL algs this week. And even this slight
        change requires a lot of effort to practice for me. I think I fear
        change too much. I keep piling on more algs. This is bad... Lots of my
        previous algs need to be re-examined FIRST. I used to think this was
        hard to do, but I heard ppl like DanH saying they change algs they don't
        like all the time. With 100% on ZBF2L, the chances of an OLL skip is
        1/27... for the COLL to solve it is 1/12. I like those odds :). -Doug

        shape but also where each piece belongs (in the scrambled state, so that
        when you make the cube, the puzzle is completely solved), then you could
        see it right away. And you have 15 seconds preinspection, that could be
        enough for following 16 pieces :-) And you could know two ways for each
        shape to make it into a cube, one for each parity situation, so that you
        make the cube and fix parity at the same time. Another negative aspect
        though is that you'd probably want to preserve the parity until the end,
        which would mean the algorithms you use for the other steps might become
        longer (though I wouldn't be surprised if most optimal algorithms
        preserve parity). Cheers! Stefan

        My calendar cube is on my desk at work, so I don't solve it on weekends.
        I'm trying to arrange my cube today (Friday, July 29th) so that I'll
        have as few turns as possible to solve it when I come in on Monday,
        August 1st. So far I've got it down to 11 turns. Can anyone do better? I
        have my stickers applied like cubesmith.com suggests. Here's my
        solution: Friday JUL 29 on F G at (U)R Tues at (R)UB C at (B)L 1 at

        yeah, I'm a self admitted calendar cube addict. I use my calendar &gt;
        cube everyday, and always change it with the day :-D It actually is a
        &gt; lot of fun! &gt; &gt; I thought of an interesting challenge for it.
        Trying to minimize the &gt; number of turns required to change each day
        (average for each month). &gt; You can take longer to solve the next day
        and also do some moves to &gt; prepare the day after that, but then
        again you can't do too much since &gt; you have to solve today in as few
        moves as possible. &gt; &gt; I also wonder if there is a distinct cube
        configuration for the &gt; beginning of each month such that every time
        you solve a day, the next &gt; day is setup very easily. It seems with
        some thought you could plan &gt; out this entire solution and just setup
        the cube that way at the &gt; beginning of each month with a regular
        Fridrich solve. So the first &gt; day of that month is say 50-55 moves
        (or you could FMC the solution on &gt; a regular cube and get it in even
        less) then each day after that is &gt; maybe 5 or so. &gt; &gt; Not sure
        which the best way would be, but it's fun to try to turn &gt; something
        that seems at first to be simple into a more complicated puzzle. &gt;
        &gt; Does anyone else use the calendar cube, or try to minimize the
        moves &gt; required for each day change? &gt; &gt; Chris

        Yeah, it's cool being a girl. Much more variety when it comes to fashion
        and accessories! :) I saw a sparkly Rubik's Cube necklace in a trendy

        it cost ¬ñ 80 pounds!! This is ~$USD140!! Then I looked closer and saw
        that it was basically just a keychain cube with fake gems stuck to it.

        Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Quite impressive but I only see 3 sides of
        the cube solved (could be &gt; unsolved edges in the &gt; &gt; unseen
        side - I'd be really impressed if you turned it over so we &gt; could
        see the other solved &gt; &gt; sides! &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I can do that,
        too, but... well... &gt; &gt; I have recorded a truly marvelous video of

        &gt; Stefan Does that mean that in 350 years time someone will actually

        Hi! I just tried to upload a file about 2.3 MB. And i got message there
        is not enough space. Since there already is a file uploaded almost 5MB i
        reckon this is total allocated space for files. Or in worst case it's
        the total space for all the files, photos, messages and so on of the
        group. Im not sure ... :-( Should we do some cleaning in the files and

        Ok to vent some frustration.... I've been trying to find a good deal all
        day... spent the last 3hrs on various sites. Oh how I wish you could
        pick the hotel first then attach a flight (instead of flight then
        hotel). Ahhhh.... I want to scream. I need to find something from
        Detroit to Dallas staying at Hearthside Suites from the 11th till the
        14th (preferably an evening flight back) with no limit of connectors
        (though a layover in Omaha would be amazing). I need phone numbers (or
        just Tyson's cell) too in case I need help: need a ride, or get lost...
        Some of the deals I select don't even have Hearthside as an option...
        are the differnt airports in Dallas located very far from each other?
        Which is Hearthside closest to? Man I'd just google and find out all
        this stuff myself and had been done with it if I wasn't so lazy... or if
        I wasn't on dial-up this week. On broadband and a fast computer I tend
        to book flihgts by opening upwards of 30 browser windows... lol. I mean
        I could chance it and try for a last minute deal... :). Ok it's 5:15AM,
        I'm going to keep looking. The concensus seesm to be at $439 on all
        these sites... but I know I can find something under $400... oh dear god
        please! Last minute deals with hotel can even dip below $275... How
        about those cubers with cars help out with shuttle service from the
        hotel to the venue??? Or maybe even airport, that'd be marvelous! I keep
        asking myself... "Do I really need to come???" Thus I'm probably going
        to chance it last minute... I can't really do much with my current
        finances. p.s. I'm taking partial credit for convincing Hunt to come.

        Hey Jasmine! That's actually one of my better cases :). I do it like
        this: (R' U R' U') x2 y' (R' U R' U')(l R U')(R' U R U) But when I first
        learned this algorithms, I did the cube rotation the wrong way.. There
        is a nice way to 'combine' that x2 y' with the surrounding moves. This
        is well illustrated on this movie:"
        http://www.planet-puzzle.com/pll_video/n9.html (Only Katsu does the last
        few moves slightly different, it shows the cube rotation. LarsV also has
        a different algorithm that's not used by a lot of cubers, see
        www.cubezone.be. My worst case has to be (ULF URB) (UL UR). Cyou Jo√´l.

        #16 used to be one of my least favourites because I hadn't learnt a PLL
        for it. I used a combination of 2 PLLs instead :/ A couple of weeks ago
        at the UK speedcubers gathering, Duncan taught me an easy to remember
        alg for this case: L U' R D2 R' U L' U2 L U' R D2 R' U L' I find this
        easy to remember because it's just the same sequence (L U' R D2 R' U L')
        repeated with a U2 in between. I also quite like #11. :) I use the
        second alg list on Dan's site for this, although I hold the cube
        differently when I execute it. Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com

        That alg is heaps better than the one I've been using. I'm going to

        We are running out of space, but this is the first time that's ever
        happened. The files section has 20 MB allocated and we are using 96% of
        that. So you can only upload about 800kb right now. The photos section
        has 30MB allocated and we are using 82% of that so only 5.14 MB remain.
        This isn't really that much of a problem, since photos are usually
        small. We can put the videos on a time limit, so the oldest videos will
        be removed and then the space freed up until it fills up again, at which
        point the oldest videos will be removed. Since this is the first time

        We could start by moving the videos to the awesome collection on
        www.strangepuzzle.com if Chris Hunt doesn't mind. It's kinda cool having
        all the videos in one place. Perhaps everyone should make an effort to
        go in and tidy up anything they've added over the years? I've just moved
        the one pic that I added several years ago! We obviously don't want to
        lose anything, but there's no reason why some of this stuff can't be
        located elsewhere. Once upon a time we used to put many more
        files/pics/vids on this group because we didn't all have websites of own
        own. Now that most people do have their own sites, perhaps some of the
        stuff in the pics and files sections is already stored elsewhere now?

        I've played around with these two algs a little and I'm going to go with
        the one Joel posted. It's just lovely. It was very easy to memorise and
        I can already execute it faster than the other one I had been using for
        ages. I don't know why I spent so long putting up with a slow awkward
        alg for that case!! Thanks guys. :) Jasmine

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This one was always awkward for me too but I picked
        a better alg from &gt; &gt; somewhere (can't remember where now). &gt;
        &gt; Try: L'U R U' L U L'U R'U' L U2 R U2 R' and see what ya reckon. It
        &gt; &gt; sets up the case as well so just keep doin the same alg to set
        it up &gt; &gt; and to solve it. Hope that helps. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I got my square-1(s) today. They are very nice and it only took about a
        week from the time I ordered to the time they were in my hand. Very

        07/18/2005 has not yet arrived! I went to the webpage to check the
        status and it said 'new'. How can my order still be 'new' after 12 days

        Hi :-) Yes, you are supposed to have the choice between screw and rivets
        for attaching the centers to the core. I'm quiye sure 99% do prefer
        screws and not the rivets though. This is because it makes the cube
        tension adjustable :-) Cut away that "excess" inner material from the
        centercaps so thay actually fit into the centers then you can sand down
        the edges of the caps as well since they tend to be a little too wide.
        Now you either glue the centercap along one edge only or use thin paper
        to make a better fit. If you use glue make sure you have already
        adjusted the cube to your liking. Not that it's too hard to break the
        glue and reglue :-) The best glue to use is superglue. make sure it's
        _real_ superglue w ONLY cyanoacrylat as its content. Get it in a plastic
        tube with a pipette. This glue is useful for repairing broken cubies
        also :-) Cheers! -Per PS! All black diy-kits have arched centers yes.
        The white ones don't have it. Most prefer black diy beacuse w the arched
        centers u hardly get any popping. However, without the arched centers
        the cube might lock a little less. The locking on my diy cube is
        negligible :-) &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hello, I just have a question about the regulations about the fact that
        it has to be a brand Rubik's cube : # THE ONLY CUBES ALLOWED FOR
        COMPETITION ROUNDS MUST BE AUTHENTIC RUBIK'S BRAND CUBES. COUNTERFEIT
        CUBES OR ALTERNATIVE CUBES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Does that also include
        the stickers ? For example if I want to take part to the championship
        with a Rubik's Cube but with CubeSmith stickers, will I be allowed to
        compete with that cube ? Thx, Gilles.

        Hi Chris, First of all, I think it is amazing what you already have
        achieved. I wish I had the spare time and guts to do this too. Even
        though you have the most experience with ZB (maybe???), I still think
        that you are too negative about ZB. Remember when you started F2L? It
        felt so awkward. Actually I have a 1981 book that describes the F2L
        technique, and in 1981 I made an annotation on that page: "too hard to
        apply". My opinion has changed completely now. :-) What I am trying to
        say is that after looooooooots of practice ZB MUST be faster than basic
        CFOP. Fewer steps, fewer moves. Recognition and the huge number of
        algorithms are an issue now, but won't be an issue when you have 3 years
        of practice at this. Anyway, keep up the good work. I like your ZB pages
        a lot. Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message ----- From: cmhardw To:

        Aaah I feel bad now, I don't mean to sound negative about ZB at all! I
        really do still see myself spending the time learn all of ZBLL, which I
        wouldn't do unless I REALLY liked it :-) I agree that maybe with a lot
        of practice, that ZB could potentially be faster than CFOP (it doesn't
        seem impossible). However, after seeing Sebastien and Jean on the 3x3
        this seems like it would take a lot of practice indeed (at the very
        least 3 years or so). Maybe then this strategy of using it as a "first
        two rounds" method is a way to use it when you are in the intermediate
        stages of learning it? I think I will write something about that in my
        next entry. I do feel bad though, I really, really, really like the idea
        of ZB method (in fact that's why I want to learn it so badly!) but I
        have had some doubts lately about how fast it can get. This could of
        course be the fact that I have only used it for 6 months, which in the
        context of ZB is really not very long. I agree that perhaps this
        strategy would be a good idea for "intermediate/beginner" ZB users such
        as myself rather than for an expert (someone who knows all of it and has
        for at least a year). Hopefully my opinion will change in 3 years! I
        really hope it does, but I guess for now this is the strategy I want to
        pursue! Please don't think I feel negatively about ZB, quite the
        opposite! I will try to be more careful with my wording in the future,
        please no hard feelings! Chris --- In

        Exerpt from May 2, 2005: (I apoloize for the wording when comparing
        ZBF2L to F2L, looking at it now I think it's pretty harsh. I just mean
        to say that it was "very easy").
        ------------------------------------------------------------ May 2,
        2005: 18.95 18.42 15.12 16.07 17.60 (20.35) 17.00 15.82 17.09 (13.66)
        16.22 16.94 = 16.92 This was my first pure Fridrich average since
        January 27, for almost 13 weeks. Recognizing the last F2L pair is
        pathetically easy after being used to trying to recognize the ZBF2L
        case. I think I'll use ZBF2L as my method of practicing for May, but at
        the actual competition I'll honestly probably end up doing pure
        Fridrich. I can't wait until I know ZBF2L well enough to use it in
        competition. :-(
        ------------------------------------------------------------ Exerpt from
        May 7, 2005:
        ------------------------------------------------------------ May 7,
        2005: This next average was a mix of ZBF2L/COLL/PLL and F2L/OLL/PLL. I
        did 4 F2L/OLL/PLL solves, mostly near the end. I wanted to try to find a
        good balance of Fridrich and ZBF2L that I might use at the New York
        tournament. The 12.52 below was a ZBLL solve. 16.40 18.17 15.85 15.11
        (12.52) 17.80 17.74 18.32 16.74 17.38 (19.65) 16.26 = 16.98
        ------------------------------------------------------------- May 2nd
        shows that the transistion from ZB to Fridrich feels easy (when I am
        still in practice with Fridrich, 13 weeks is not as much time as 13
        weeks plus basicaly 2 more months), and makes the steps feel easy. May
        7th shows the spike times of ZBLL (the 12.52) and also that Fridrich
        helped me to stay consistent with the average when I got amnesia with
        ZBF2L. Right now I'm fairly rusty with Fridrich, I amnesia OLL cases a
        lot, and I'm at least 2-3 seconds slower on average than when I was
        practicing all the time. I hope with the 2 weeks of practice before
        Dallas that I can chip off some of that rustiness, but I imagine not
        having worked on Fridrich for a long time will really take its toll on
        my times. That doesn't mean I don't think this will be a bad strategy.
        Once I've had time to practice both ZB _and_ Fridrich together
        (switching between the two like I will in competition), I think it's
        possible that I'll be able to repeat May 2, as well as use a combination
        of ZB and Fridrich like on May 7 if I am screwing up with ZB in
        competition (amnesia and the like). Chris P.S. I can do a few averages
        and post them if you still want (ZB, then Fridrich, done in that order)
        but I can almost guarantee that the Fridrich will be nothing special,
        and perhaps slower than ZB since I haven't practiced Fridrich to the
        point of starting to amnesia OLL cases. Again, that entry was my theory
        for the future, once I've practiced in that mindset for a while. I don't
        expect immediate results with this at all. --- In

        It's probably 7 easy algorithms total. Takes a couple of hours, though.

        the cross on top, generally using the 'put the piece directly below
        where it needs to be' approach. Two cases. Then come the U layer
        corners. Three cases. Then I teach them how to solve middle layer edges
        (cross side is now on bottom). Two algorithms that are very simple and
        only a single ' different. Then comes working corners, if they are doing
        well. This is followed by two cases for edge orienting. Then comes the
        corner permuter, same as above. Next is the Sune/antisune. Then, I teach
        a simple 3 cycle and its reverse. &gt; &gt; Including working corners, I
        taught the latter method to someone in just over an hour, and she was

        &gt; It¬¥s not necessary, if you think you are rusty with Fridrich it
        won¬¥t &gt; be so good to compare with anyway. And now i see that your
        zb-site is &gt; longer then i first saw :) Hey, in response to your
        question I went through and practiced my OLL cases to cover the ones I
        was amnesia'ing and then did a few warmup Fridrich averages. When I felt
        good I did a ZB average, followed immediately by a Fridrich average.
        First off I want to say that the two methods compliment eachother well.
        The pacing for ZBF2L is much slower than F2L, since you have to track
        the LL edges, and for Fridrich is obviously much faster and more fluid.
        So switching between the two helps me to try to apply some of the F2L
        pace of one to the other, speeding up ZBF2L a bit and making F2L nice
        and slowfast. Well here were the averages: ZB (every solve was ZBF2L /
        (21%ZBLL) or (COLL/PLL) : 16.63, 17.73, 17.93, 16.00, 17.58, (15.54),
        19.52, 18.90, 18.02, 16.97, (21.40), 19.52 = 17.88 followed immediately
        by Fridrich (every solve was F2L (with basic partial edge control /
        (OLL/PLL) or (1/7 COLL/PLL) : 18.23, 17.86, 17.32, 15.56, 17.98, 14.55,
        (14.08), 15.49, 15.67, (20.02), 17.34, 17.26 = 16.73 I did do COLL
        during the Fridrich average when it came up, but other than that I only
        did basic partial edge control (making sure to not end up with all
        flipped edges). 16.73 beats my fastest ever offical rules average by
        0.02 seconds! And I haven't practiced Fridrich seriously since Horace
        Mann (2 months ago)! I am really set on using ZB as my "first two
        rounds" method and then Fridrich as my "final round" method. If I do get
        to the point where I am consistently faster for ZB stuff than Fridrich,
        then I will of course try to use that for all rounds. These averages
        makes me really happy! I think these methods compliment eachother well!
        ZB solving makes me slow down and be slowfast for F2L when doing
        Fridrich. Fridrich solving makes me try to speed up my ZBF2L pace a
        little bit. I can't wait till I've had the time to practice and really
        get fluid with Fridrich again! I really do think ZB and Fridrich can be
        used together, and you can easily switch between the two without any
        interference or problems. In fact practicing one way seems to help me
        for the other way. Chris

        Hi Lars, Yes, you are right. I think ZB is crazy and even a bit
        intimidating. :-) There will be guys learning this system. For me it is
        impossible to do that within 2.5 years: family, busy job, other hobbies,
        website, competitions... And if you finally master every little
        algorithm, you have to work hard each day to not forget anything and be
        able to execute them very fast. Actually, I think that if there would be
        someone fully mastering ZB (and most importantly: be exceptional on
        F2L!!!!!!), then it would force a few other cubers to use it too. And
        that makes me feel sad... I don't want to work that hard. :-) There must
        be easier ways to achieve the times you could reach with ZB. Especially
        corners first systems look promising, because of the fewer moves. At the
        moment I am investigating CF approaches and I found some promising ones.
        CF systems where you solve several edges at once. After WC2005 I will
        give up CFOP for a while and see what these systems can bring. It would
        be great to not do this alone. Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message

        3x3 this seems like it would take a &gt; lot of practice indeed (at the
        very least 3 years or so). Maybe then &gt; this strategy of using it as
        a "first two rounds" method is a way to &gt; use it when you are in the
        intermediate stages of learning it? I &gt; think I will write something
        about that in my next entry. It almost seems unfair to compare ZB to
        Fridrich via Sebastien and Jean. If you look at the SCC UWR list, their
        average times for F2L are sub-9. Since Fridrich and ZB "share" the first
        few steps--cross, and first three pairs--I would think you could only
        compare the remainder of their solves, instead of comparing entire
        times. For example, I remember seeing that you would like to be within
        one second of the 1st place on the F2L fastest average list. Therefore,
        would you feel a bit more confident in ZB if your ZBF2L was sub-10
        seconds? Even with a 6-second ZBLL, that would give you a sub-16
        average. I think that since there is an overlap between the two methods,
        it would give you a better idea of comparison by comparing your speed
        for the ZBF2L alg + ZBLL alg to the speed of a Fridrich 4th pair + OLL +
        PLL. :-) Whaddya think? ~ Bob

        assume you're using a rubik's 4x4x4. I have that problem a lot too
        except when mine falls apart, it's usually due to a center snapping. But
        the way I do it is to build it layer by layer on a table. For example,
        start with white. Should be easy to get all the centers in. Then put in
        the rest of the pieces. Build the side centers. Should still be easy
        because the top isn't done. Then when you do the top, Just try to get as
        many centers out of the way when you put in the last one. I think two of
        the centers should be able to move out of the way. Hope that helps, Ben.

        Ron, It would be great to have another corners guy on here. I currently
        use an incomplete Waterman system and avg 21-23sec. I say incomplete
        because I don't position two edges while orienting the middle edges. Too
        many algs ! Also, I solve with the middle slice being "E" instead of "M"
        becuase I can execute the algs faster. I wish I knew some details of the
        method that Dave Allen used. Wayne --- In

        &gt; I think ZB is crazy and even a bit intimidating. :-) &gt; There
        will be guys learning this system. For me it is impossible to do that
        within 2.5 years: family, busy job, other hobbies, website,
        competitions... &gt; And if you finally master every little algorithm,
        you have to work hard each day to not forget anything and be able to
        execute them very fast. &gt; Actually, I think that if there would be
        someone fully mastering ZB (and most importantly: be exceptional on
        F2L!!!!!!), then it would force a few other cubers to use it too. And
        that makes me feel sad... I don't want to work that hard. :-) &gt; &gt;
        There must be easier ways to achieve the times you could reach with ZB.
        &gt; Especially corners first systems look promising, because of the
        fewer moves. &gt; At the moment I am investigating CF approaches and I
        found some promising ones. CF systems where you solve several edges at
        once. &gt; After WC2005 I will give up CFOP for a while and see what
        these systems can bring. &gt; It would be great to not do this alone.

        that after looooooooots of practice ZB MUST &gt; &gt; be faster than
        basic CFOP. Fewer steps, fewer moves. &gt; &gt; The case against that
        MUST is that for a given amount of practice time &gt; Fridrich will
        always allow for X times more training per alg than ZB, &gt; where X is
        the ratio of algs in ZB vs Fridrich, which I think is around &gt; 10 or
        20 (?). So each alg you encounter you will have X times more &gt;
        practice with. If it's true that the more you practice an alg, the &gt;
        faster you get, we're not talking about a MUST here as much as weighing
        &gt; different factors. &gt; &gt; Inherent in a method with fewer algs
        is that you'll always be better &gt; practiced on those algs than one
        with more. &gt; &gt; Another possibility it is that you need a certain
        amount of practice to &gt; reach your top speed, and once you're there
        it can't really be &gt; improved. In that case, you only need to spend X
        times as much time to &gt; reach your top speed with ZB, and then your
        MUST will be true by &gt; logical necessity. That disregarding the need
        to maintain your skills, &gt; which may be ignorable. &gt; &gt; Anyway.
        My point is that for a fair comparison between methods, you &gt; need to
        compare them with a similar amount of practice put in. I &gt; suspect
        that while it's probably *possible* to become faster with ZB &gt; than
        any other method using that measure, it would require *enormous* &gt;
        amounts of practice to reach the breakeven point. &gt; &gt; - - - - - -

        easy to get all the centers in. &gt; Then put in the rest of the pieces.
        Build the side centers. Should &gt; still be easy because the top isn't
        done. Then when you do the top, &gt; Just try to get as many centers out
        of the way when you put in the &gt; last one. I think two of the centers
        should be able to move out of &gt; the way. Thanks Ben. I'm going to try
        and start over and do it that way. Right now I have the whole thing done
        except for a corner, two edges, and a center piece. I'm going to take
        apart the top layer and build up the centers first.

        I have a question about Fridrich's PLL notation. I'm referring to this
        page: http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Mike/permute.html Several
        places on the page, there are notations in parentheses about (U), (U1),
        (U2), and (U3). What do these mean? I'm confused. First, there is U
        meaning "Upper side" and then there is Fridrich's and Goljan's
        "constellation" notation where U permutes three edges. Neither one of
        these seem to mean the same thing as the
        U-with-or-without-a-numeral-in-parentheses. Thanks, Larry [Non-text

        Hi Joseph, I got a 5x5x5 last week and it took me a few hours thinking
        to work out the parity things. It might not help but if you are just
        looking for hints and not actual algorithms then I would suggest as
        hints: 1. To my mind there is only one issue and that is two edges
        apparently swapped - the other cases you mention can be reduced to this
        case. 2. It really IS impossible to swap two edges. 3. It might help to
        solve the edges before you solve all the centres. 4. Its easier to see
        whats going on if you have the two edges in the same slice (rather than
        in the same layer for example). Oh and I guess 5. You can solve anything
        with conjugates! Maybe thats all too cryptic or maybe it makes it too
        easy I don't know :) These hints amount to the rational thinking process
        I went through anyway and I'm not very fast (about 13 minutes!) but at
        least I understand whats going on now. Hope that helps. Duncan -----

        I also decided to solve the 5x5x5 without specific algorithms, but I
        managed to do it because my method avoids that parity problem : 1. Solve
        the centers 2. Pair up the edges with one wing (so that you have on one
        edge 2 blocks : one wing and on wing/edge paired) 3. Finish the edges
        (pair up the blocks together) 4. Solve the 3x3x3 cube And you can't have

        With my solution, you can't have two wings swapped, they are just in the
        good orientation. Now you might have to use the (R1R2 U¬≤)*5 if you only
        have 2 or 4 edges to solve at the end, but you don't have to swap to
        wings. I don't know which way is the best. :s

        What has once been one of my worst three cases, is now one of my

        one is easy to recognize from all angles, it starts with the standard
        grip, and no cube rotation is necessary to set it up so that no U
        adjustment is necessary at the end. Cheers! Stefan

        Ok, let me know then :-). What's your time for your current alg? I think
        you might easily get faster than me. The U and F at the end give me a
        bit of trouble. I'm trying two ways to fix it, one is to do the F with
        the middle finger. And I know you can do RUR'U fast like that, which I
        can't. The other way is to push the U with my left index finger...

        Rubik's Game contains a Rubik's Deluxe Cube with peg holes. And they
        have arches. The game cube I use every day has never popped on me. There
        is a deluxe cube on ebay right now, but you need sharp eyes. ;) David J

        Hey! Thats indeed what most top 4x4x4'ers do. With various little tricks
        along the way. Like pairing up many edges at a time or avoiding parity
        etc etc ... Other ways of solving the 4x4x4 is the Akimoto columns
        method. Or my own cage method, which incidentally is VERY similar to
        Courtney mcFarrens method. By searching around a little u should find
        info on those methods easily. Umm another potentially good method i'dl
        ike to listen is to do 2 opposite faces completely then the remaining
        edges (avoiding parity ... at least a trivial fix) then rest of the
        centers. There are others that may be good too. Like solving
        blocks-style like Petrus for the 3x3x3. Richard Patterson has looked
        into this. Not sure how far he got with it. Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        In case anything is interested in what goes on in my head: The following
        is a full description of both the memorization and solving of a cube
        scrambled with the following algorithm: U' R B F' R' L' U' B F' R' U2 D'
        F' D L2 B2 R' U' R L B L2 R' U F2 The first thing I memorize is the edge
        permutation. I start with 1, and then go to 11. Then I think that the
        cycle sweeps across the bottom to 9, and continues right, but goes
        diagonally up to 5 and then further across and back to 7. From 7, I have
        to remember that it jumps to 3, but then I think that it sweeps across
        to the right to 2 and further down right to 10. At 10, I have to
        remember that it jumps to 6. I glance at the timer and see that it reads
        23 seconds. Then I see 4 and I see it plunges down to 12 and I realize
        it cycles to 8. I make a very quick mental note that it's a clockwise
        cycle. For the corners, I see 1 going to 8 and 5. I see the 8-corner in
        the one place so I make a quick note that I will start off with a D2
        setup move for that cycle. I then see 2 sweeping to 3 and I see that it
        continues down to 7. I am relieved to see 4 and 8 in the right place. I
        notice the edge orientation that three edges are wrong on the top. I see
        the front right edge in the middle layer is oriented wrong and I tell
        myself "U2" and then I picture very quickly that I will flip that edge
        in the middle layer for a four-edge flip. I then flip the cube over with
        z2, tap the two adjacent edges that are wrong, and say to myself "back
        left". I look at the corners, and think "easy" on the two corners which
        form a pair on the top layer in the left. I flip the cube over with z2,
        and see three corners wanting to be clockwise twisted. I make the mental
        note that no U-turns are necessary and that I will correct the corners
        starting with that first one, which happens to be on the URF after I
        flip the cube over with z2. I return the cube back to its position, and
        see that the timer reads 53 seconds. I immediately perform a right

        clockwise. Since the cube is already flipped over, I recall to myself
        "back left", perform (L F), and do a two-edge flipper and then undo that
        setup move. I then flip the cube back upright and do U2, F' and do the
        four-edge flipper that I visualized before. I undo those setup moves. I
        recall the D2 setup move for (1 8 5) I told myself earlier so without
        thinking, I do D2 + (R' F R F')x3 + D2 + (R' F R F'). I remember that 2
        sweeps to 3 and continues down to 7. I think that 7 wants to go to 2 so
        the setup move is U2 and I do U2 + (R B' R' B)x3 + U2 + (R B' R' B)x3. I
        turn my attention to the edges and I do L2 to put 11 next to 1. I
        realize 9 is already in the bottom layer so I do D but do not do R2 to
        flip it up. Instead, I begin my 3-cycle with just U. I reverse the setup
        moves and then do U' and flip up the 5 and 7 and perform another
        counterclockwise U-permutation. I reverse that and I immediately do
        another counterclockwise U-permutation because (1 3 2) is the nicest
        edge-cycle in the world. I then do D' to put 10 next to 6 on the F-face
        and I do the counterclockwise U-permutation with the cube rotated but I
        do not do R' because I would have had to redo that for the setup move
        anyway. I then recall the clockwise U-permutation that awaits. The clock
        reads 1:53. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology

        Hey Tyson this is really interesting but when you say "1 goes to 6" or

        &gt; U' R B F' R' L' U' B F' R' U2 D' F' D L2 B2 R' U' R L B L2 R' U F2
        &gt; &gt; The first thing I memorize is the edge permutation. I start
        with 1, &gt; and then go to 11. Then I think that the cycle sweeps
        across the &gt; bottom to 9, and continues right, but goes diagonally up
        to 5 and then &gt; further across and back to 7. From 7, I have to
        remember that it jumps &gt; to 3, but then I think that it sweeps across
        to the right to 2 and &gt; further down right to 10. At 10, I have to
        remember that it jumps to &gt; 6. I glance at the timer and see that it
        reads 23 seconds. &gt; &gt; Then I see 4 and I see it plunges down to 12
        and I realize it cycles to &gt; 8. I make a very quick mental note that
        it's a clockwise cycle. &gt; &gt; For the corners, I see 1 going to 8
        and 5. I see the 8-corner in the &gt; one place so I make a quick note
        that I will start off with a D2 setup &gt; move for that cycle. I then
        see 2 sweeping to 3 and I see that it &gt; continues down to 7. I am
        relieved to see 4 and 8 in the right place. &gt; &gt; I notice the edge
        orientation that three edges are wrong on the top. I &gt; see the front
        right edge in the middle layer is oriented wrong and I &gt; tell myself
        "U2" and then I picture very quickly that I will flip that &gt; edge in
        the middle layer for a four-edge flip. I then flip the cube &gt; over
        with z2, tap the two adjacent edges that are wrong, and say to &gt;
        myself "back left". &gt; &gt; I look at the corners, and think "easy" on
        the two corners which form a &gt; pair on the top layer in the left. I
        flip the cube over with z2, and &gt; see three corners wanting to be
        clockwise twisted. I make the mental &gt; note that no U-turns are
        necessary and that I will correct the corners &gt; starting with that
        first one, which happens to be on the URF after I &gt; flip the cube
        over with z2. &gt; &gt; I return the cube back to its position, and see
        that the timer reads 53 &gt; seconds. &gt; &gt; I immediately perform a

        Hi Darereck, (is that your name)? For JNetCube, the default sets white
        as the front and green as the top. That's because Chris Hunt solves it
        that way. You can change the settings yourself in the options though.
        WCA scrambles are done two ways. In certain tournaments, the organizers
        won't say anything and they'll just choose a color scheme. The color
        scheme can be chosen at random. Generally, if you request a certain
        color, the tournament organizers will honor that request. In most
        tournaments in the United States, during registration, you have the
        opportunity to state what front and top color you would like for your
        puzzle for the different events. Color choosing is usually requested in
        the blindfold solves. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        Hi :-) Just out of curiosity. Why would u do OLL and PLL for the edges
        of the last layer? Or u really mean OLL and PLL for edges and corners
        combined? I guess that will be far too many cases to be practical. I do
        corners on LL separately and then edges with 3-cycles pluss parity fix.
        I don't have any need to orient edges then permute them. It's
        unnecessary work. Using 3-cycles u for the most part solve 2 edges at a
        time. It takes a while to get used to the various kinds of 3-cycles u
        will need. But it's not extremely hard either :-) Umm .. doing centers

        Hey David, I would love to, but unfortunately I have booked too many
        Saturdays this semester. My coach would get pissed if I booked another.
        It's only a 3 hour (or so) drive, but I would probably not be able to
        leave until around 10 or 11 (guessing here), and thus the tournament
        would likely be half over. ;) Sundays are the only free days I really
        have for the rest of the semester (and next semester, racing in the
        Spring). Hehe. If for some reason practice gets out like super early, I
        could *possibly* make it. What time do you expect the tournament to
        start? ~ Bob --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, David Barr

        lot, but the D and F moves &gt; are &gt; &gt; &gt; killing me and I'd
        rather not have a cube rotation or regrip at &gt; start. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        What's the other alg? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well you could try R' L' U2 L R but that
        changes the F2L. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seriously though try L D' L B L2 D2
        R F R' D2 L B' D L' &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know whether or not it

        quite surprised about the prize, I thought it would go for much more.
        The Deluxe (if it is one), the Megaminx (Tomy?) and the Smart Alex

        I'm stopping four times in a row with a stopwatch now, record so far is
        10.75 seconds. Already much faster than the alg I used previously and
        there's no cube rotation at the start, so this is definitely my new alg

        For people qho don't know i'm sebastien felix, I averaged 13.00s ( 13.55
        12.87 12.62 12.56 13.90 13.67 (14.15) 12.59 13.17 12.28 12.83 (12.13)
        SD=0.66 average 13.004(so close to sub13:D))with the fridrich method and
        think we can get sub12. Here are all the tips I use to speed my fridrich
        solves. CROSS: 1.end your cross at D, L or R and try to find the 1st
        pair during the D, D' or D2 move. If you can anticipate the 1st pair
        during 15s of preinspection do it! 2.try to build extended cross or a
        cross and a piece of the first pair, then before doing the D, D' or D2
        to end the cross, insert the 2nd piece of the 1st pair and you'll get an
        extended cross 3.be able to do the cross BLD almost everytime. F2L: 1.Of
        course look ahead and have NO DELAYS 2.use empty slots to less turn your
        cube during F2L. 3.use multisloting to reduce your number of moves for
        solving F2L(try to do every F2L solve with less than 32 moves) 4.have a
        look on LL edges from the 3rd slot to the 4rth slot, and try to orient
        as many as possible(it avoid 0 edges oriented OLL, and you have more
        than 1 chances out 27 to skip OLL if you master it since the 3rd slot)
        5.of course know how to solve every case for every slots 6.learn zbf2l
        algs for the cases where the last pair is incorrect but in its own slot.
        THE GOAL IS TO AVERAGE 7-8S FOR F2L LL: 1.Have the best recognition
        system you can, the goal is to recognize and execute LL algs as fast as
        possible. For example when you got a thunder for OLL, place the 2 cases
        with the same orientation of the thunder, do the same thing for square
        cases...etcetcetc 2.be able to achieve all OLL sub1.5 and all PLL sub2.
        3.avoid cube rotations during algs. THE GOAL IS TO AVERAGE 4-5S FOR LL
        THE GOAL OF FRIDRICH METHOD IS TO AVERAGE 11-13S... I hope this topic
        will help some cubers. [Absolut teaM member]

        Hi! Professor (5x5x5) x-centers break rather too easily also. More
        easily than 4x4x4 centers i would say. Unless you use the original arxon
        which seems to have weaker centers than newer 4x4x4. And anyway it seems
        to me the prices are a tad too high. Those who break cubies easily may
        be better off simply get a cheap cube off eBay for spare pieces. That
        said it's great that people now have a place to easily get single spare
        pieces. Myself, i have many "retired" cubes ;-) Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        are all the tips I use to speed my fridrich solves. CROSS: 1.end your
        cross at D, L or R and try to find the 1st pair during the D, D' or D2
        move. If you can anticipate the 1st pair during 15s of preinspection do
        it! 2.try to build extended cross or a cross and a piece of the first
        pair, then before doing the D, D' or D2 to end the cross, insert the 2nd
        piece of the 1st pair and you'll get an extended cross 3.be able to do
        the cross BLD almost everytime. F2L: 1.Of course look ahead and have NO
        DELAYS 2.use empty slots to less turn your cube during F2L. 3.use
        multisloting to reduce your number of moves for solving F2L(try to do
        every F2L solve with less than 32 moves) 4.have a look on LL edges from
        the 3rd slot to the 4rth slot, and try to orient as many as possible(it
        avoid 0 edges oriented OLL, and you have more than 1 chances out 27 to
        skip OLL if you master it since the 3rd slot) 5.of course know how to
        solve every case for every slots 6.learn zbf2l algs for the cases where
        the last pair is incorrect but in its own slot. THE GOAL IS TO AVERAGE
        7-8S FOR F2L LL: 1.Have the best recognition system you can, the goal is
        to recognize and execute LL algs as fast as possible. For example when
        you got a thunder for OLL, place the 2 cases with the same orientation
        of the thunder, do the same thing for square cases...etcetcetc 2.be able
        to achieve all OLL sub1.5 and all PLL sub2. 3.avoid cube rotations
        during algs. THE GOAL IS TO AVERAGE 4-5S FOR LL THE GOAL OF FRIDRICH
        METHOD IS TO AVERAGE 11-13S... I hope this topic will help some cubers.

        Hey Sebastien! Congratulations on your new average that is absolutely
        amazing! Also thanks for your tips, I'm sure I speak for a number of
        people when I say that I think they'll be useful. I've already started
        trying to prepare the next c/e pair while working on the current one
        (multislotting) and so far I like it! However since I just started I
        really don't know many cases and I have a hard time doing it quickly.
        But I assume this comes with practice. Thanks again for the tips, I for
        one will be reading over and trying to implement them in my own solving.

        For LL i use my own algs, I advice everybody bernard helmstetter
        database:Very usefull to find THE alg which fits well with your hands...
        I fogot some things... F2L: 7.Use non adjacent pairing, if one piece of
        a pair is already solve? do D or D' or D2 then put the 2nd piece and
        realign F2L... LL: 3.Use your own algs, I think finding your own algs

        Hey everyone, I remember this topic came up a long time ago, and it was
        decided that it would probably take a lot of work. Is there a way that
        we can build some sort of testing program to analyze this? Maybe we
        could fabricate lots of similar scrambles with only a small portion of
        the algs different (say two or three turns in the middle) and have the
        users rate which one feels "faster". This way we could have it rate two
        types of regrips, or two ways to insert an uncomfortable B move into a
        fast RUL alg or something like that. I've noticed with ZBLL algs that I
        almost exclusively look for RUL algs now. I usually also end up liking
        RULM moves too, but they just don't come up that often for the algs I
        need. Even when I get a weird alg like L D R U' R E R2 F D2 B' D2 F2
        which has D,E,F, and B turns I still turn it into an RUL alg. My trigger
        for this one is almost exclusively RrULlM except for one easy to execute
        F turn in the middle: L z' (R U) [L' (U)] [(M') (U2)] (F) [R l] [U'
        (l')2] U2 What other turn groups are good? I think ULD and URD and URF
        and ULF are also very fast! What others do you guys use? Also do we
        think that together we could try to work on such a program, or would it
        not be very practical/accurate? I was recently reminded of this old
        topic, but I don't remember what we concluded. I think it would be very
        interesting if it existed, but I wonder about how good it would be at
        actually identifying which algs are good. What do you programmers think?

        I finally made it to sub-17 with ZB!!!! It took me 6 months, all of

        Lately I've been working on trying to find algorithms that I like for
        all the edge permuations on the square-1. To find these I've been using
        Jaap's sq1optim.exe program. It's really fast, but it doesn't pause
        between algorithms and it doesn't have enough options for me. Plus the
        algorithms that I get are sometimes pretty ugly like: (1,0)/
        (5,-4)/(-2,-5)/(3,-3)/(-3,0)/(5,2)/(0,-3)/(4,-2)/(5,-3) So I'm
        wondering, has anyone already compiled a list of good edge permutation
        algorithms? Or does anyone have a square-1 solver with more options like
        no turns of 4 or 5, or ignoring the side-colors? Thanks for your help,

        hi there ben. ive come up with some simple but pretty fast permutation

        if i can get a video of it onto this forum. it involves. (doing moves
        set A, my discovery :P)-(moving bottom by 1,2,5 etc.)-(reversing moves

        merci gilles mais tu es trop flatteur;) ...I think that multisloting is
        not fast to master but quite easy, that is just intuitive algs, the
        hardest thing is to anticipate the 4 pieces! but doing that force you to
        develop you're anticipation, it allow you to see how pieces will change
        during F2L and have a better fridrich F2L solve. I advice everybody to
        work a lot on his LL algs because thats one of the key to low
        averages(have an efficient LL with an avg of 4-5s at everytime), the
        other is to have an efficient F2L,) but i got one question for your
        gilles, why don't you use ZBF2L for the last pair of your 2nd 1*2*3 blok
        and then use COLL to skip the orientation stage for your 6 last edges?

        Hey sebastien, I'm sure I'm not the only one, but I have very high
        doubts about your incredible records. Maybe show us some proof...
        perhaps an uncut vidoe like katsu's? Even a sub 15 average would be

        simply put out an e-mail with "your view about fridrich". I get the
        feeling that you claim to be a master at Fridrich and a foremost
        authority simply because you occupy the number 1 slot on the unofficial
        rankings list. There's news. You can say whatever you want! But no one
        has to believe you. In all honesty, you are not the number 1 cuber.
        There are 24 cubers who are faster than you. You are 25th. This is based
        on official competitions where we know you cannot cheat or lie. And
        yeah, thanks a lot for presenting your views on Fridrich. You have done
        nothing but spit out the mantra of every sub-25 cuber out there in the
        world. Find algorithms that fit your hands? Look ahead? We know all of
        this already! I do not see a single novel idea in anything that you have
        presented. Thylakoid is right. You cannot expect any respect from any of
        us unless you provide us with a little bit of evidence. Just a little.
        Macky has time and time again in competition showed that he can achieve
        low 15 and sub-15 averages in pressure situations. For a 13.00 second
        cuber, I would expect you to solve a cube, on a bad day, in about 15
        seconds. Just show us a 15.5 second average and it will quell the doubts
        of everyone. You gain nothing from bragging here. No one believes you,
        and when it comes time for the competition, you will be beaten by 19
        second cubers, and you'll be searching for excuses, and we'll all turn
        away, and turn our attention to those who have honest characters.

        Hello, I don't know much about fast progress, but what I know by my own
        experience is that you can always improve yourself, and sometimes it
        doens't take that long if you have done many mistakes all along, and
        then one day you say "oh ! I can do that instead !" Ron can tell you
        that 2 or 3 days ago I sent him 2 differents emails about a new best
        average : 22.16 in the morning, and the evening I did a 20.97. What
        happened ? I changed something in the way I was solving the cross, and
        the result is there. Now I can agree that there is a slight difference
        between 1.19 seconds (from 22.16 to 20.97) and 7 seconds (from 20 to
        13). That's why I agree that it's possible to have a doubt, but you
        can't judge the person directly without letting him proving himself. I
        see 2 possibilities here : 1. One video would be a very good way to
        prove yourself to the people (and have your average accepted in the UWC
        list) 2. Wait until the next tournament to see if you can solve it so
        fast You can choose :-) Anyway, keep up the good work :-)

        There's a huge difference between 22-20 and 20-13. Anyways... yes a
        video would be extremely good proof, but as I said before, I highly

        1. Competitions are hard. Most people are several seconds slower than
        their at home average, especially on the first one. 2. A video proves
        nothing. Anyone averaging 20 seconds can do sub 15 on rehearsed cubes.
        This is a pointless argument since there is no way to find out. If you

        F2L today ; - his LL is very famous in France, used by the so called
        members of the absolut team. - his best average was around 16.xx at the
        time of the french open, not 20.xx - I've heard he works rubik's cube
        **A LOT** those days. Now if you take as evidence the competition
        results, you are probably wrong. I can give you numerous example why : -
        in the German ChShip, Ron VB's average over 15 cubes was around 18.5 how
        do u explain he could make a 14.59 average one month before ? - what
        about Gilles Roux's times ? Can you explain why he has problems even
        getting under 20'' in competition and produce 15.xx at the same times ?
        - What about Stefan Pochmann ? He was around 26'' in that german open
        and now he's claiming sub19, when everybody knows that he has a full
        time job, and that he also achieves numerous performances in 4x4, 5x5,
        BLD, magic, click, etc. ? Where did he find the time to cut those 7'' ?
        I think that nobody would doubt about the performances of the 3 guys
        above. It just tells us that there's a huge gap between competition and
        cubing at home. By the way, those records are "unofficial". [Snip
        overagressive and useless comments] &gt; seconds. Just show us a 15.5
        second average and it will quell the doubts of everyone. &gt; &gt; You
        gain nothing from bragging here. No one believes you, and when it comes
        time for &gt; the competition, you will be beaten by 19 second cubers,
        and you'll be searching for &gt; excuses, and we'll all turn away, and
        turn our attention to those who have honest &gt; characters. This is
        maybe going to far, "everyone", "no-one", why do you think you are
        allowed to speak in the name of the whole rubik's community ? I advise
        moderation, Cheers, -- Francois.

        This has nothing to do with not performing well in competition. When did
        I say he did not perform well? All I said was that he improved vastly

        Hello, I was just practising Magic (found a new technique and I'm
        improving my times :-)) but I broke one string. I searched to repair it
        on the Magic but I couldn't find where it broke as it moved a lot while
        I was solving it. So I removed it completely. It seems that the Magic
        works still very well whithout any problem. Is it really important to
        have all the strings ? Thank you, Gilles.

        Hi there, I'm just a sub30 cubist, and never entered any comp' so far,
        so I'm maybe not the best one to write this post. Anyway... I was
        wondering about the fairness of allowing an extra time for pops in
        comps. If you consider that : - popping is the consequence of bad
        handling of the cube - popping occurs when you take lots of risks to
        achieve a great time ; - in other sports like tennis, we don't allow to
        replay the point when a string gets broken ; in car races, if you go to
        fast and leave the road, you are not allowed another start ; - in
        principle you could "fake" a pop when you need another excellent time in
        comp', and you just have realized that the start of your F2L is rather
        bad...(ok, enough about "cheating" today ;)) ... I'm wondering if we
        should really allow extra cube for popping. If we still allow
        extracube... Would it be clever to change the rule that for the extra
        cube, you get some kind of penalty like : IDEA1 : add 2'' to the extra
        cube time ; or IDEA2 : the time of the extra cube cannot be better than
        your {average(AVG) on the serie] +(alpha x SD). [SD = standard dev.]
        [example, alpha = 1. You time (T_ex) your extra cube :. If T_ex &gt;=
        AVG + SD, then you keep T_ex in the Avg T_ex &lt; AVG + SD, you replace
        T_ex by AVG + SD.] Well, what do you think ? -- Francois.

        already scrambled cube). And a moving environment would be good, e.g.
        people walking around, so that he can't trick with video editing. Then
        again, that's all unnecessary. I believe him anyway, I don't need a

        it's not useless. It does increase the entertainment value a bit, which
        I've already noticed comparing Tyson's two blindfold videos. From a
        "trust" point of view it doesn't matter to me whether he has someone

        is indeed more lively and entertaining, especially his remark after the
        solve :-) Cheers! Stefan

        Jonathan and Mr. thylakoid, I think that you have both read entirely too
        much into the the initial post of Sebastien. Please go ahead and read it
        again ... I'll wait. Good. Now, Sebastien's subsequent posts in this
        topic were simply responses to questions asked of him. I'm not sure
        where you get the idea that he is trying to pass himself off as the
        "foremost authority" or a "deity." Your reactions to Sebastien's post
        are just not warranted by what he wrote. There has been much discussion
        in this forum of the limits of different solution methods. In his first
        post Sebastien merely states that he thinks "... we can get sub12" and
        goes on to give some of his recommendations. He should be free to do
        this without harassment. First, this is a forum dedicated to the open
        discussion of speedcubing. Second, while he has not shown himself to be
        the single fastest cuber in the world in competition, he has shown
        himself to be one of the fastest in the world. Even though most of what
        he wrote has been written before, I suspect that it could still give
        insight to some of us ~30" cubers how a &lt;20" cuber focuses his
        efforts. Peace, Scott

        You don¬¥t have to judge him and call him a cheater. I realize that some
        poeple may find it funny to send in fake times but Felix has shown that
        he is indeed a good cuber at French Championship, and I don't think a
        guy who is really into cubing would do that. Some guys are nervous
        during competitions and do much worse times then they usually do at
        home. That meaans that Felix may have had a personal best of 16-17 when
        he did 20 in April at a competition. That means that his improvement
        maybe was "only" 16-13=3 seconds which I think is possible in 4 months.

        uncut vidoe like katsu's? Even a sub 15 average would be &gt; &gt;
        sufficient because honestly, with your reputation, I don't think you
        &gt; &gt; can even hit that. But its ok, you'll probably have an excuse
        for not &gt; &gt; making a video so I don't expect one. Unlike macky,
        you have no proof &gt; &gt; of your accomplishments. I'm sorry if this
        sounds offensive, but I &gt; &gt; think you should expect some doubt
        with those kind of achievements and &gt; &gt; no form of credibility.
        &gt; &gt; You know, I hate to say this, but I have to agree here. Now, I
        don't know Sebastian, so I &gt; am not one to judge on his character.
        However, the tournament in France where he set a &gt; 20.02 average was
        in April. Do you really expect us to believe that you cut 7 seconds off
        &gt; of your average in 3 months? People spend years trying to shave off
        seconds especially in &gt; the 15 and 16 second range. A 13 second
        average is amazingly fast, and I do not believe &gt; it is possible to
        achieve that from 20.02 in 3 months, especially since Rubik's Cubing is
        &gt; not a job. &gt; &gt; If you would provide some sort of video
        evidence that you can indeed accomplish this, &gt; then perhaps we would
        have more reason to believe. However, as it stands, no one asked &gt;
        you for your advice and you simply put out an e-mail with "your view
        about fridrich". I get &gt; the feeling that you claim to be a master at
        Fridrich and a foremost authority simply &gt; because you occupy the
        number 1 slot on the unofficial rankings list. &gt; &gt; There's news.
        You can say whatever you want! But no one has to believe you. In all
        &gt; honesty, you are not the number 1 cuber. There are 24 cubers who
        are faster than you. &gt; You are 25th. This is based on official
        competitions where we know you cannot cheat or &gt; lie. &gt; &gt; And
        yeah, thanks a lot for presenting your views on Fridrich. You have done
        nothing but &gt; spit out the mantra of every sub-25 cuber out there in
        the world. Find algorithms that fit &gt; your hands? Look ahead? We know
        all of this already! I do not see a single novel idea in &gt; anything
        that you have presented. &gt; &gt; Thylakoid is right. You cannot expect
        any respect from any of us unless you provide us &gt; with a little bit
        of evidence. Just a little. Macky has time and time again in competition
        &gt; showed that he can achieve low 15 and sub-15 averages in pressure
        situations. For a &gt; 13.00 second cuber, I would expect you to solve a
        cube, on a bad day, in about 15 &gt; seconds. Just show us a 15.5 second
        average and it will quell the doubts of everyone. &gt; &gt; You gain
        nothing from bragging here. No one believes you, and when it comes time
        for &gt; the competition, you will be beaten by 19 second cubers, and
        you'll be searching for &gt; excuses, and we'll all turn away, and turn
        our attention to those who have honest &gt; characters. &gt; &gt;

        either, and I think the penalty idea is a good compromise. In the rules
        they're unfortunately called "Puzzle Defects", though actually they're

        better fix it fast and continue. My second vote would go to Francois'

        Well, lot of answers, many of them arn't interesting. First I dont claim
        to be THE master of fridrich and to be god, i just know that I average
        lower than other cubers in front of my PC and want to share some ideas
        in order to let cubers see where the loose time. You treat me of cheater
        or liar, so F**K you, i dont want to be recognize as the best, come and
        do battle with me then you could say I'm a liar or a cheater. When i did
        france championship, my best avg was 16.83, so I lost avout 3s in
        competition, then win 3.5s on my best avg, about 1s per month isnt a lot
        I think... I know there was people doubting of me but seeing such
        assholes astonished me, if you're not happy get out of here, i never
        asked you something! And as everybody know in france, still you're not
        recognize guilty you're innocent, i say that for people who forget that
        you must have proofs to accuse someone. What will me my interest to give
        a wrong average, contrary tou you teenagers who doubt of my abilities, i
        dont cube in order to try to have a kool personality and have friends, I
        get rid about the cube!!! So thanks to people who read my post smartly
        and to other suspicious people...F**K!I'm not an authority because i'm
        for instance at the 1st place of the list asshole(Isolvecubes) but if I
        can do a cube 1s faster than other cubers(on average) thats because
        other cubers loose time somewhere and they can cut those time with my
        advice(I hope). concerning thylakoid125, you doubt me to do a video, I
        already have 5-6 sub15 videos what do you want more! And just a detail,
        when you're a smart person, you tell others your name when you came into
        a discussion... thx to Gilles VDP, golgobridge, stefan P, pioneersop and
        gunnar to have defended my POW when i was sleeping:) Well, to summarize,
        i ignore people who dont trust me and for people who trust me come talk
        with me to know if i can help you to save time. Keep cubing sebastien
        PS:for people who dont know, since 7-8 monthes, i just practice 3*3*3
        and fridrich method!

        everybody, I am almost a bit afraid to give a reply in this discussion..
        It's already getting a bit tooo crowded in here. Anyway, first of all,
        I'd like to ask everybody to stay calm, for your own sake. Second, it's
        very natural for people to have doubts. People want to see before they
        believe something. And I don't really think there's anything wrong with
        that. Humans tend to have doubts, try to understand that Sebastian. To
        the people who have doubts: There's no need to accuse anyone or use bad
        language or anything. Just remember to always be polite. About the
        credibility of videos: Of course, we all know that videos proove
        nothing. However, seeing someone on the internet, on websites, pics, of
        videos, anything on the net, help me a lot. I remember when Jean Pons
        had the UWR for the cube, I had a pretty hard time believing him. But we
        had some chats on MSN and nice races with a webcam (really had that
        'race'-feeling), and it made me confident that he was for real. The idea
        is simple: Katsu has a huge site with video's, tv-appearances etc. so
        there's no reason to doubt he did a sub-15 average. But if someone cuber
        posts exactly the same times, it would still be easier to believe Katsu
        then to believe that new person. We all know it's possible, but it's
        easier to trust someone you 'know' (even though I only know Katsu by his
        website). I must say I am also a pretty sceptical about the new records
        Sebastian is telling us (I hate to say this, Sebastian ;)). But I also
        had a few chats with him, and he sounds like a pretty nice guy, and I
        know he's into cubing pretty seriously, so I can't see why any cuber who
        is into cubing that seriously would make up records like that. There is
        simply no 'motive'. So yes, I would appreciate to see some more nice
        videos. And no, I am not calling anyone a *. See you guys, Jo√´l.

        I thought Sebastien's Fridrich tips were helpful, they weren't
        regurgitated from other websites... And if he did a 20 avg. in public,
        and can do 13 at home that doesn't really mean he cut 7s off his time -
        cubing at home is much different. But even so, I don't think that 3-4
        months is too short to cut off that amount of time if he works hard at
        it everyday. I've only been cubing for 5 months and I've gone from
        solving in minutes to averaging 29s. Sebastien will you be competing a

        Hi. I am sorry too.. you can rebuild it using fishing wire. but this is
        a hard thing to do yourself... I have the same problem and until today I
        haven't fixed it. Time ago, rubiks.com offered magic DIY, but not now
        and I think it will never be on sale again. I found some web pages were
        you can take some ideas on how to rebuild your magic.

        I have not tried yet, but some day maybe. If you experience some
        advances, please inform me. have fun... Alberto ----- Original Message

        I've learned something today : never use a Magic whom doesn't have all
        his strings. It just felt completely apart as 2 others strings broke. So
        I have to rebuild it completely :-( The thing is that I don't know how
        to do that and the booklet doesn't explain how to rebuild it... Could
        you explain me how to put back all the strings (I have to make new ones)
        or give me an address where I can find that ? Thanks (hopefully I'll
        have a new one on monday :p)

        I guess that since there are more and more opinions being posted, I will
        post mine. I have talked with Sebastien quite a bit over the past couple
        of weeks, and his tips have helped alot. Thanks! Also, I was in a chat
        with him and Jon Morris yesterday, and he walked us through some of his
        F2L solves. Jon generated the scrambles right there, and the solutions
        were given quickly. Judging by the way that Sebastien solved the F2L, I
        can definately see how he can post such fast times. This, coupled with
        his "perfected" Last Layer, I believe that his times are credible. I
        know first hand how competitions can affect one's performance. It is
        much different than relaxing in front of the computer, solving for hours
        on end. Nerves definately mess with me. Anyhow, I believe you Sebastien,

        Yeah, as always, this is been a controversial topic. The trick, of
        course, is finding a method that allows us to deal with 'average'
        competitions and 'mean' competitions. Obviously, in the 'mean'
        competition, the effects are much more detrimental. Anyway, keep
        throwing out ideas, but I can say there probably won't be any
        significant changes before 2006. We don't want to be meddling around too

        I hate to say "I told you so." :-P My recommendation: buy a couple
        Simpson or Harry Potter Magics from rubiks.com and disassemble them for
        their strings. They are $5 each. I used Jaap's website for putting a
        Magic together (I have done it before). Over the past few months since I
        started Magic-ing, I have replaced over 60 strings (maybe an
        underestimate). It happens. I have never heard of anybody making their
        own from fishing line (probably not even worth the effort). If it is
        your first time building a Magic from nothing, it will take a few hours,

        In Macky's defense, best time comparisons are not the same as average
        comparisons. All it takes for a 'best time' is just one good solve and
        we all understand that. If you really want to do a comparison, I think
        Macky was averaging around 20 back at WC 2003 and took his average down
        to about 16 at the Caltech tournament. Macky also has a habit of doing
        well in tournaments. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        of &gt; weeks, and his tips have helped alot. Thanks! Also, I was in a
        chat &gt; with him and Jon Morris yesterday, and he walked us through
        some of &gt; his F2L solves. Jon generated the scrambles right there,
        and the &gt; solutions were given quickly. Judging by the way that
        Sebastien &gt; solved the F2L, I can definately see how he can post such
        fast times. &gt; This, coupled with his "perfected" Last Layer, I
        believe that his &gt; times are credible. &gt; &gt; I know first hand
        how competitions can affect one's performance. It &gt; is much different
        than relaxing in front of the computer, solving for &gt; hours on end.

        I think multislotting is what Marcus Sturh also uses. Basically, as you
        put in a pair, you're doing other things to manipulate the other pieces
        to make them easier to put in later. I think... that's the idea. You
        probably do it a bit already just from instinct. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        same speed and have no lock up, thats one of the basic advice you can
        find on every good speedcubing page, because one alg done slower than
        usual and you can loose 2-3s on a solve... sebastien

        I have one, and it's far better then the best speedcube I've ever had. I
        don't know how it compares to the black DIYs, since I don't have one,
        but I love it. Some have said they didn't even have to lube it, but I
        did have to lube mine, but that made it perfect. As far as looking
        strange, I don't see that as a negative point, since it makes it stand
        out from my other cubes. It takes a few solves to get used to having the

        The color of the background is important. You can understant that you
        have less contrast when you look at a white or a yellow sticker, then I
        think it takes a longer time to recognize it as white or yellow. Despite
        that, I think it's as good as any other cube if it's well lubed and
        built. :-)

        6 last edges? -) Because you can prepare this last pair while finishing
        the previous 1x2x2. Recognizing the orientation of 5 or 6 edges takes
        time. -) Because fixing orientations at the same time requires
        additional moves, sometimes as much as when you do it later with slices.
        -) Because CLL is faster than COLL, and "CLL after 2*1x2x3" is even
        faster. -) Because more substeps in the end means more lucky cases too,
        and different possible strategies. Quite often, 6E4C (6 edges + 4
        centers) can be solved in 10 moves or less. -) Because with an early
        orientation, 6E4C often begins with a costly M2 move you can avoid when
        mixing orientation and permutation. -) And more :-) I'm sure there are
        positive arguments for what you propose, but overall, I feel it's not
        worth it. Gilles.

        Hello hello I just got my new DIY cube in the post. (They said 30-40
        business days to ship to Australia and it arrived in a week :D) A few
        questions about putting this baby together: 1) How tight should I adjust
        the centres? I've tried to make them even all around with a gap of about
        1mm, but not fully tight. 2) Should I play with the cube before I put
        the lube in? I mean perhaps cubing a bit before will smooth the cubies a
        little, does anyone have any recommendations on the best way to break in
        a new cube like this? 3) Which way should I put the coloured stickers
        on? My old cube had blue opposite white but on cubing video's I've
        noticed a lot of cubes with yellow opposite white instead. Cheers! Alex

        G'day Alex, where are you from? I'm an aussie too. I live in NSW. It's
        up to you which way you sticker you cube but I did mine in the standard
        Rubiks configuration, eg. white opp yellow etc. I've also heard that the
        lube that they come is'nt that good so I just used silicone spray
        instead. Keith.

        as my old cube was always catching and scratching and being a pain. As
        for the DIY cube, I was kind of hoping the supplied lube would be good
        but I guess I'll have to go looking in a hardware shop now for some
        spray-on stuff. One last question is about the centre caps. How do you
        get them to stay on? They have these little ridges around the edges
        which stop them even from sitting neatly inside the centre cubes. I
        guess I'll have to glue them but I still want to be able to pop them off
        if I need to adjust the screw tension, right? Thanks, Alex MDC --- In

        &gt; &gt; A few questions about putting this baby together: &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; 1) How tight should I adjust the centres? I've tried to make
        them &gt; &gt; even all around with a gap of about 1mm, but not fully
        tight. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Should I play with the cube before I put

        the cubies a little, does &gt; &gt; anyone have any recommendations on
        the best way to break in a new &gt; &gt; cube like this? &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 3) Which way should I put the coloured stickers on? My old cube
        &gt; had &gt; &gt; blue opposite white but on cubing video's I've
        noticed a lot of &gt; cubes &gt; &gt; with yellow opposite white

        &gt; G'day Alex, where are you from? I'm an aussie too. I live in NSW.
        &gt; It's up to you which way you sticker you cube but I did mine in the
        &gt; standard Rubiks configuration, eg. white opp yellow etc. I've also
        &gt; heard that the lube that they come is'nt that good so I just used
        &gt; silicone spray instead. &gt; &gt; Keith.

        Personnally, I just put them in it and they stay at their place. Now you
        might want to glue or use any other technique to be sure they won't go
        off, but this means you won't be able to remove them afterwards (or
        it'll be a lot more difficult). I think you should just put them in it,
        and even if they pop, you could always glue them or whatever...

        alex_mdc, 1. I think that it's easier to start tight and then loosen
        than to start loose then tighten. 2. play with it for a few hours for
        about a week. Lube it then do it again. 3. I prefer white opposite blue
        which was the original color scheme. If you get a Deluxe cube, a Rubik's
        game cube or the original 2x2x2 and 4x4x4 they are all white opposite
        blue. The supplied lube is a silicone based lube and works very well. A
        sliver of paper can help hold the cap on. If you insist of gluing it
        avoid epoxy because you may never get the cap off again. Gilles van den
        Peereboom The silicone spray to avoid is the oil-based version. Marco
        Garbelini Don't sand the inside of the cube at first. Try adjusting the
        spring tension, and wearing it in, and lubing it first. Very very rarely
        is any sanding needed. Cheers, David J --- In

        Sometimes I think to myself: "man, I will never get to sub-20, it seems
        imposible." But I think it's posible with dedication and a good cube.
        I'd like to know how much time took to you that are sub-20 to get there.
        I know it is different to each person, but I can have and idea (or maybe
        do an average...:)). And other important thing: my last layer. I
        currently use a 4-look LL. I know it's veeeeeery slow. I need to

        Hi Guys, Concerning how much someone can improve over time: The second
        time I solved the cube it took me an hour. It was immediately scrambled
        and the third time I solved the cube it took me 15 minutes. So inside of
        15 minutes I improved 45 minutes, which was a rate of 7,776,000 seconds
        per month. :) David J --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        He cuted of 8 seconds on 7 months, both done on oficial competitions.
        Why Sebastien times aren't posible? I've been cubing since June 15 (i'm

        minutes to 45s average, and with a very bad cube from China. &gt; &gt;

        in a chat with him and Jon Morris yesterday, and he walked us through
        some of his F2L solves. Jon generated the scrambles right there, and the
        solutions were given quickly. Judging by the way that Sebastien solved
        the F2L, I can definately see how he can post such fast times. This,
        coupled with his "perfected" Last Layer, I believe that his times are
        credible. &gt; &gt; I know first hand how competitions can affect one's
        performance. It is much different than relaxing in front of the

        waste words insulting people that you don't care about??? the only you
        need is to proof yourself and nothing more, when i was having times of
        60 y blame my cube (because is one made in china, and here i don't get
        any original), when i reach my first sub-20 time i stop that, and start
        to blame miself, because i'm still not good enough to reach that times,
        think about it, you (all of you who are reading this) has the luck to
        use one original rubik's cube, or put your hand in a stackmat, or go to
        a tournament, are things that i dream every day, but i know i never get.
        Maybe you become the master of the fridich method, maybe not, there is
        no limit for speedcubing. One anonymus samurai say: "once you become a
        master of an art, you demostrate it on every aspect of you life" Keep

        Hi friends, I recently received my StackMat Generation 2 (with a big
        tournament display!). It works fine, it feels a bit faster to stop, but
        it also requires more precise positioning of the hands to start and
        stop. One issue I found is that for speedcubing the small display is too
        close and too soft. So when you throw down your cube, you can
        accidentally touch the small display with your cube. I now have a pit in
        my display. :-( Yesterday I glued a small piece of transparent acryl on
        top of the display, to protect it. Have fun, Ron

        Don't use Gunk, I made the mistake of putting it on a studio cube and
        had to scrub it off each cubie... Try and get lube made my Snap - it

        Hey Pedro, Hey Pedro, I am not yet sub-20, but here is an idea of my
        progress once I began "speedcubing" Feb. 7 - Switch from cross on top to
        cross on bottom, begin learning F2L instead of first layer corners -&gt;
        middle edges -- 2 week break from learning -- Mid-March - (2 weeks) -
        Learn PLL -- 2 week break from learning -- Begin taking averages with
        Fridrich for first time! :) Mid-April - (6 weeks, noncontinuous) - Learn
        OLL -- 6 week break from learning -- Mid-July - (2 weeks) - Learn COLL
        Late July - (2 days) - Learn VH edge control (connected first day,
        non-connected second day) Just over five months after I started learning
        Fridrich, I got the average that currently stands as my best, 23.49
        seconds. Like everybody says, it's all about the F2L. My F2L sucks
        (17-18 second avg?), and it's the only reason why I'm not sub-20...maybe
        if I practiced for more than 3 hours per week? :( Don't learn all LL
        algs from the same place. That's bad. There are TONS of sites with
        different LL algs, and some will fit you better than others. Does this
        help? Everybody is different, you know that. :P Remember, a 4-look LL
        with a lightning fast F2L is faster than a crappy F2L with a 2-look LL.

        time took to you that are sub-20 to &gt; get there. I know it is
        different to each person, but I can have and &gt; idea (or maybe do an

        currently use a 4-look LL. I know it's veeeeeery slow. I need &gt; to
        improve. How long it takes to memorize OLL an PLL? &gt; &gt; Pedro

        Hey Pedro, Those times are very normal for your system and your
        experience. It is actually very similar to my situation when I was
        cubing for two months! So keep on going like this, and you will be fine.
        If you ever want my help, just use the 'contact' option on my site. At
        this point, my tip about solving the cube very slowly (number 1) is
        pretty important. Try to find your own shortcuts for the F2L. - Jo√´l.

        feel that it (in Fridrich style solving) helps first in f2l recognition
        (using white) and then in OLL recognition (using yellow) since those
        colors stand out the most from the others. I also like the idea of
        having similar colors (white/yellow, blue/green, red/orange) opposite
        one another. I think that it helps me with PLL recognition. &gt; One
        last question is about the centre caps. How do you get them to &gt; stay
        on? Take a look at Stefan Pochmann's suggestion for using paper to hold
        the caps in place. I recently tried it with my DIY cube and I like it.
        Take look at messages #16940 and 17455 in this group to learn more about
        it. Peace, Scott P.S. My current best average is just barely sub-30, so
        don't take my post as expert testimony. I'm curious to hear other
        people's ideas on the color issue.

        Hi Pedro, I've been cubing for about 11 months now. I've gotten 5 sub 20
        averages so far, and I can average about 21 seconds consistently once
        I'm warmed up. I was using a very basic 7 step LBL method for about 7
        months probably. I didn't really practice that much, just when I was
        bored in my spare time really, but eventually I could consistenly
        average 30 seconds using that crappy method (best average was 27.94).
        Then I started getting bored at using the same thing and I decided I
        wanted to get faster, so I started learning PLL. It took me about 3
        weeks to learn them all. I used just this method for about a month and
        was averaging under 30 seconds with it. I went to the Horace Mann
        tournament using this, and that REALLY sparked my motivation to get
        faster. As soon as I got home from the tournament, I started learning
        F2L. It took about two weeks to get through the algs (I had a hard time
        seeing things intuitively at first), and I was very frustrated because I
        was averaging about 40 seconds. It was really tough for me to see the
        pairs for a while. But suddently I just started gradually improving, and
        within a few days really I went from averaging 40 to averaging 26-27. I
        started working on OLL then while my times continued to drop. I learned
        the OLL algs in a little over a month, and by that point my F2L was
        still getting better and I was averaging about 23-24 seconds. For the
        past two weeks or so, I've just been working on using all the Fridrich
        algs. On July 31, I got my first ever sub 20 average. Since then I've
        gotten 4 more sub 20 averages (best is 19.60), and I consistenly average
        around 21 seconds. I'm very confident that with some more practice, I'll
        be able to average sub 20 all the time. Anyway, that should give you an
        idea of how things have gone for me. Just keep practicing, and don't be
        lazy with learning algs, and eventually you'll get to being sub 20. Good
        luck, and have fun. -Jason

        Hey guys! Yeah, after one month off internet, I'm finally back... I just
        attended an orchestra camp in Michigan, in case anyone cares where I
        was, it was fun but the orchestra sucked very, very badly, they had me
        play with the faculty orchestra and even that one was particularly bad.
        ANYWAY there were about 1200 kids there (yeah, orchestra was only one of
        the numerous majors there), but no need to say I was THE attraction of
        the camp, sadly not for my (*ahum*) amazing cello skills but for my
        cubing, which eventually became annoying after a while. I started to
        keep track on a notebook of every single time I got the stickers quote
        or the "is there a pattern to it" one but I lost count after a while (or
        got bored or both). Not talking about, I've done it once, I can do one
        side, oh dude that's freakin'awesome and so on. You know'em all. So
        basically there was that camp store, where they started selling cubes
        after I went to the talent show. They had some of these keychain-like
        cubes, only crappier and with the worst color scheme ever. It even says
        Made in china on one of the dark yellow corners (yep the scheme is like,
        dark yellow, light yellow, light blue, purple-ish, red/orange, green and
        pink duh). I so should get royalties from them, they're making money out
        of my talent. Not fair. Not talking about how I was giving cello lessons
        to the kids there... anyway. Yeah, so I stayed 2 sessions there, went to
        the talent show the first time and did an horrible 23s 2-handed solve on
        stage, like, with a guy and his stopwatch next to me (the guy was huge,
        I was probably scared, like, a lumberjack or something). So i messed up
        the cross and the F2L and did 2 PLL, horrible. But I was still way
        faster than anyone the audience had ever seen before so it was cool.
        When I got back to the dorms, the counselor was like, it's the slowest
        solve I've ever seen you doing, but it was still awesome, so I guess I
        enjoyed doing it anyway. During the second session, I guess they must've
        heard I had the European record for a while or something, but I got a
        note from the administration, they wanted me to do the cube one-handed
        this time. Oh well. But I'm like, you know, having a guy standing alone
        on stage for 40s solving a rubik's cube is pretty boring and quite long
        though, plus since I haven't practiced for at least 2 months one-handed
        and it's not my usual OH cube, it might even get up to 50s, but they
        say, no, the kids're gonna love it. Ok. So this time, I dressed in
        black, with a very tight black t-shirt inside-out (yeah the outside said
        "I love Detroit" or something like that, not my shirt... too tight for
        me, but with the distance noone could guess I have no muscle...), took
        my Neo sunglasses with me on stage in my pocket and put some good Matrix
        music, and when the music started, I put my glasses on and started
        solving the cube one-handed. Everyone was screaming, that was so
        awesome... did quite well on this one, 36s. I was "THE" man... The music
        and the sunglasses worked perfectly with it. The sad part of it, besides
        the comments "hey are you the cube dude" or "did you know that the cube
        has been invented like, 50 years ago?", was all the ppl asking me to
        solve their crappy piece of shit they bought off the camp store I didn't
        even want to even touch (unless the person asking it was a girl and very
        very cute). We also have a dance at the end of each session, and I guess
        the cubing has been part of my success here... I should upload that
        picture of me solving the cube above my head while I'm dancing, it's
        hilarious... Oh and yes, while I was playing in the faculty/staff
        orchestra, we had that one piece (Ravel's Bolero for those who know it,
        it's roughly 18 minutes of straight C-GC-GC-GC-GC-G.....etc. for the
        cellos), very boring, where you don't even need both hands for playing,
        so I just plucked my cello as a guitar and solved the cube with the
        other hand, when I wasn't teaching the counselor next to me how to solve
        it. Last couple of factoids and then I'll pretty much be done about my
        random babbling about my camp experience. 1. do not take your best
        speedcube out with you at the pool, and 2. Coca-cola is not a good
        lubricant. A jackass spilled coke all over my bag and it ate the plastic
        of my cube away, it's horrible. It doesn't turn anymore. Never seen that
        before. Oh very last thing. I hate you guys. I forgot to change my
        preferences before I left, so I kept receiving the emails in my regular
        box. Result: 942 new emails when I got back yesterday. still a bit over
        300 to go. Go figure. j/k. I love you all. Francois PS. But still...

        seconds so I'm not too shabby but then again I'm a &gt; long way from
        the elite cubers! I'm hoping to find some speed in my &gt; new cube as
        my old cube was always catching and scratching and being &gt; a pain.
        &gt; &gt; As for the DIY cube, I was kind of hoping the supplied lube
        would be &gt; good but I guess I'll have to go looking in a hardware
        shop now for &gt; some spray-on stuff. &gt; &gt; One last question is
        about the centre caps. How do you get them to &gt; stay on? They have

        sitting neatly inside the centre cubes. I guess I'll &gt; have to glue

        little, does &gt; &gt; &gt; anyone have any recommendations on the best

        are just mirror of "a", so, it's not THAAAT difficult (yes, I think I
        will learn that...:) &gt;Remember, a 4-look LL with a lightning fast F2L
        is faster than a crappy F2L with a 2-look LL. ;) (I don't listen :\)
        Yeah, it's true. But I don't have a lightning fast F2L... Bob Burton

        here is an idea of my progress once I began "speedcubing" Feb. 7 -
        Switch from cross on top to cross on bottom, begin learning F2L instead
        of first layer corners -&gt; middle edges -- 2 week break from learning
        -- Mid-March - (2 weeks) - Learn PLL -- 2 week break from learning --

        months after I started learning Fridrich, I got the average that
        currently stands as my best, 23.49 seconds. Like everybody says, it's
        all about the F2L. My F2L sucks (17-18 second avg?), and it's the only
        reason why I'm not sub-20...maybe if I practiced for more than 3 hours
        per week? :( Don't learn all LL algs from the same place. That's bad.
        There are TONS of sites with different LL algs, and some will fit you
        better than others. Does this help? Everybody is different, you know
        that. :P Remember, a 4-look LL with a lightning fast F2L is faster than

        I agree with Scott. For me, blue and green are more similar than blue
        and white. I haven't had a white opposite blue cube on my hands, but I
        think it is kinda strange...And I don't like the idea of having a
        white/yellow/orange corner or a blue/green/red one. Pedro Scott Mikos

        perceive white and yellow to be the brightest colors on my cube, so I
        like having yellow opposite white on my cube. I feel that it (in
        Fridrich style solving) helps first in f2l recognition (using white) and
        then in OLL recognition (using yellow) since those colors stand out the
        most from the others. I also like the idea of having similar colors
        (white/yellow, blue/green, red/orange) opposite one another. I think
        that it helps me with PLL recognition. &gt; One last question is about
        the centre caps. How do you get them to &gt; stay on? Take a look at
        Stefan Pochmann's suggestion for using paper to hold the caps in place.

        I tought I will never learn all those F2L algs, but when I saw, I had
        learned almost all of them. Interesting...I hope it goes the same with
        the OLL... Jason Baum &lt;speedrunningcuber@...&gt; escreveu:Hi Pedro,
        I've been cubing for about 11 months now. I've gotten 5 sub 20 averages
        so far, and I can average about 21 seconds consistently once I'm warmed
        up. I was using a very basic 7 step LBL method for about 7 months
        probably. I didn't really practice that much, just when I was bored in
        my spare time really, but eventually I could consistenly average 30
        seconds using that crappy method (best average was 27.94). Then I
        started getting bored at using the same thing and I decided I wanted to
        get faster, so I started learning PLL. It took me about 3 weeks to learn
        them all. I used just this method for about a month and was averaging
        under 30 seconds with it. I went to the Horace Mann tournament using
        this, and that REALLY sparked my motivation to get faster. As soon as I
        got home from the tournament, I started learning F2L. It took about two
        weeks to get through the algs (I had a hard time seeing things
        intuitively at first), and I was very frustrated because I was averaging
        about 40 seconds. It was really tough for me to see the pairs for a
        while. But suddently I just started gradually improving, and within a
        few days really I went from averaging 40 to averaging 26-27. I started
        working on OLL then while my times continued to drop. I learned the OLL
        algs in a little over a month, and by that point my F2L was still
        getting better and I was averaging about 23-24 seconds. For the past two
        weeks or so, I've just been working on using all the Fridrich algs. On
        July 31, I got my first ever sub 20 average. Since then I've gotten 4
        more sub 20 averages (best is 19.60), and I consistenly average around
        21 seconds. I'm very confident that with some more practice, I'll be
        able to average sub 20 all the time. Anyway, that should give you an
        idea of how things have gone for me. Just keep practicing, and don't be
        lazy with learning algs, and eventually you'll get to being sub 20. Good
        luck, and have fun. -Jason SPONSORED LINKS Free puzzle games Puzzle

        Hi Pedro! Is tarted cubing in late 2002 with Petrus' method. Until
        december last year I didn't cube wery seriously even thou my average was
        28,51. Then I descided to start cubing more seriously and to change
        method to Fridrich. I learn all F2L-algs in about 4 weeks. Then in April
        3 months later I knew PLL and 8 OLL-cases and my average record was then
        22,44. Kow I finally know all 57 OLL-cases and average 18,84. So it took
        me approximately 8 months to learn Fridrich's method, but I was familiar
        with the cube before. /Gunnar --- In

        I also had the same problem with hitting reset at first, which is one
        reason why I don't practice BLD solves on the stackmat 2. After a while
        though you get used to the distance of the pads and just hit them near
        the outside, so there's no risk of hitting reset. I don't mean to
        belittle the problem, I had the same issue for a while myself. However
        with practice you don't hit the reset button anymore. I agree that this
        is a problem with using the stackmat 2 in competition. If there was a
        way to put a raised barrier of acryllic or plastic or cardboard around
        the button that would solve the problem for people who aren't used to
        it. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, thewetdog

        yeah I told you the cubes were crappy... :-p Seems i forgot how to
        count. No wonder I couldn't remember the last color... No pink then. But
        still. Crappy. Told you. Oh and btw, I found a funny way to couter at
        least the first 2 questions they ask you... Non-cuber: OH MY GOD, how do
        you do that? Cuber (looking bored): hmmm by turning the faces...
        Non-cuber: no but I mean, what's your trick? Cuber: I use the Force...
        So by the end of the camp, everyone called me Darth Rubik, I heard they
        even made a song about me. Oh and there was that joke going around camp,
        but it's so lame i don't even want to put it up there... The punch line
        is so stupid... Although since there were quite a few jokes around here
        about Swedes and Norwegian... Ok, so here we go: "if you're French

        Pedro, &gt; &gt; I am not yet sub-20, but here is an idea of my progress
        once I began &gt; "speedcubing" &gt; &gt; Feb. 7 - Switch from cross on
        top to cross on bottom, begin learning &gt; F2L instead of first layer
        corners -&gt; middle edges &gt; -- 2 week break from learning -- &gt;
        Mid-March - (2 weeks) - Learn PLL &gt; -- 2 week break from learning --
        &gt; Begin taking averages with Fridrich for first time! :) &gt;
        Mid-April - (6 weeks, noncontinuous) - Learn OLL &gt; -- 6 week break
        from learning -- &gt; Mid-July - (2 weeks) - Learn COLL &gt; Late July -
        (2 days) - Learn VH edge control (connected first day, &gt;
        non-connected second day) waw, you've learned so much and you are not
        yet sub-20 ? I only know 20/22 PLL and 30/57 OLL and no other system for
        the LL and I did a 20.97, I guess this is because of my F2L :-) &gt;
        &gt; Just over five months after I started learning Fridrich, I got the
        &gt; average that currently stands as my best, 23.49 seconds. Like &gt;
        everybody says, it's all about the F2L. My F2L sucks (17-18 second &gt;
        avg?), and it's the only reason why I'm not sub-20...maybe if I &gt;
        practiced for more than 3 hours per week? :( I started Frifrich 4 months
        ago (very odd method at the beginning : edge first :s) and you should
        definitely practice more ;-) &gt; &gt; Don't learn all LL algs from the
        same place. That's bad. There are &gt; TONS of sites with different LL
        algs, and some will fit you better &gt; than others. &gt; &gt; Does this
        help? Everybody is different, you know that. :P that's very important
        &gt; &gt; Remember, a 4-look LL with a lightning fast F2L is faster than
        a &gt; crappy F2L with a 2-look LL. ;) (I don't listen :\) that's the
        difference between you and me I think (except I'm not yet "lightning"
        lol, but a litlle fast) &gt; &gt; ~ Bob Gilles. :D

        I'm talking to Speed Stacks right now about developing a timer
        specifically for Rubik's Cube use. They might design a cover to help
        prevent people from hitting the reset button or other things. However,
        what happens if you hit the reset button during the championship solve?
        It's happy news and you get disqualified. Yeah, so it's not happy. Why?
        Starting and stopping the timer and having command of stopping the timer
        is your responsibility. If you're worried, it's simple. Take a second or
        two and stop the timer carefully. Of course, this is unreasonable when
        solves are 20 seconds, so you assume your own risk of stopping the timer
        quickly. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On Aug 9,

        started cubing in April 2004. My father taught me LBL-method. At the
        beginning my times were about 4 minutes with very bad cube. At the end
        of May I learned Dan Knight's 4-look LL in two days. In mid-June my
        average was around 1 minute. Then I learned PLL, and in July my averages
        were about 40 seconds. And then I started learning F2L. I think it was
        16.8.04 when I got 38.xx avg. In September I learned OLOLL and got my
        average record to 22 seconds. 7.10.04 I did 21.4 sec avg, and then my
        improving stopped. In November-December I broke two cubes. I smashed
        them to floor because I was so close to average record. In mid-December
        I finally broke my record and got 20.54 avg. In mid-January I did my
        first (rolling)sub-20 averge 19.96. And now my best time is 12 seconds
        and avg 16.51.

        off internet, I'm finally back... I just attended an orchestra camp in
        Michigan, in case anyone cares where I was, it was fun but the orchestra
        sucked very, very badly, they had me play with the faculty orchestra and
        even that one was particularly bad. ANYWAY there were about 1200 kids
        there (yeah, orchestra was only one of the numerous majors there), but
        no need to say I was THE attraction of the camp, sadly not for my
        (*ahum*) amazing cello skills but for my cubing, which eventually became
        annoying after a while. I started to keep track on a notebook of every
        single time I got the stickers quote or the "is there a pattern to it"
        one but I lost count after a while (or got bored or both). Not talking
        about, I've done it once, I can do one side, oh dude that's
        freakin'awesome and so on. You know'em all. &gt; So basically there was
        that camp store, where they started selling cubes after I went to the
        talent show. They had some of these keychain-like cubes, only crappier
        and with the worst color scheme ever. It even says Made in china on one
        of the dark yellow corners (yep the scheme is like, dark yellow, light
        yellow, light blue, purple-ish, red/orange, green and pink duh). I so
        should get royalties from them, they're making money out of my talent.
        Not fair. Not talking about how I was giving cello lessons to the kids
        there... anyway. Yeah, so I stayed 2 sessions there, went to the talent
        show the first time and did an horrible 23s 2-handed solve on stage,
        like, with a guy and his stopwatch next to me (the guy was huge, I was
        probably scared, like, a lumberjack or something). So i messed up the
        cross and the F2L and did 2 PLL, horrible. But I was still way faster
        than anyone the audience had ever seen before so it was cool. When I got
        back to the dorms, the counselor was like, it's the &gt; slowest solve
        I've ever seen you doing, but it was still awesome, so I guess I enjoyed
        doing it anyway. During the second session, I guess they must've heard I
        had the European record for a while or something, but I got a note from
        the administration, they wanted me to do the cube one-handed this time.
        Oh well. But I'm like, you know, having a guy standing alone on stage
        for 40s solving a rubik's cube is pretty boring and quite long though,
        plus since I haven't practiced for at least 2 months one-handed and it's
        not my usual OH cube, it might even get up to 50s, but they say, no, the
        kids're gonna love it. Ok. So this time, I dressed in black, with a very
        tight black t-shirt inside-out (yeah the outside said "I love Detroit"
        or something like that, not my shirt... too tight for me, but with the
        distance noone could guess I have no muscle...), took my Neo sunglasses
        with me on stage in my pocket and put some good Matrix music, and when
        the music started, I put my glasses on and &gt; started solving the cube
        one-handed. Everyone was screaming, that was so awesome... did quite
        well on this one, 36s. I was "THE" man... The music and the sunglasses
        worked perfectly with it. &gt; The sad part of it, besides the comments
        "hey are you the cube dude" or "did you know that the cube has been
        invented like, 50 years ago?", was all the ppl asking me to solve their
        crappy piece of shit they bought off the camp store I didn't even want
        to even touch (unless the person asking it was a girl and very very
        cute). We also have a dance at the end of each session, and I guess the
        cubing has been part of my success here... I should upload that picture
        of me solving the cube above my head while I'm dancing, it's
        hilarious... Oh and yes, while I was playing in the faculty/staff
        orchestra, we had that one piece (Ravel's Bolero for those who know it,
        it's roughly 18 minutes of straight C-GC-GC-GC-GC-G.....etc. for the
        cellos), very boring, where you don't even need both hands for playing,
        so I just plucked my cello as a guitar and solved the cube with the
        other hand, when I wasn't teaching the counselor next to me how to solve
        it. &gt; Last couple of factoids and then I'll pretty much be done about
        my random babbling about my camp experience. 1. do not take your best
        speedcube out with you at the pool, and 2. Coca-cola is not a good
        lubricant. A jackass spilled coke all over my bag and it ate the plastic
        of my cube away, it's horrible. It doesn't turn anymore. Never seen that
        before. &gt; Oh very last thing. I hate you guys. I forgot to change my
        preferences before I left, so I kept receiving the emails in my regular
        box. Result: 942 new emails when I got back yesterday. still a bit over
        300 to go. Go figure. &gt; j/k. I love you all. &gt; Francois &gt; PS.

        It really depends on how much time I have. When I have a free day, and
        decide I want to practice, I can easily do 100 cubes, or more. But
        during the busy days of the year, I sometimes don't solve a cube at

        Hey Stefan, First off: &gt; l' U' L' U R U' l U R' U' L U R U' R' F
        wow!!! that alg is really nice! The trigger R U' L U R' is very fast,
        and the R U' l U R' is an easy extension of that. I've also had the same
        thing you have with error prone algs. One of my ZBLL algs is (U) (L' U2)
        [L (U) (L' U')] [R (U') L (U) R'] (L' U2) L This alg feels very nice now
        that I have practiced it a lot, but when I first tried it I locked up
        very badly _every_ time I did it. The transition between the [L (U) (L'
        U')] and [R (U') L (U) R'] was particularly brutal at first. Also I tend
        to look for algs that have the [R (U') L (U) R'] trigger in them becuase
        it is so fast! For that trigger I do the (U') with my left index finger
        and the (U) with my right index finger. I really like your E perm alg, I
        think it could be very fast! Chris --- In

        previous turn. So [(l' U' L') (U)] the (U) means to do the (U) with the
        right hand since the left hand is the one used for the first part. [R

        it. What do you think? I think it is better to split up the R U' l U R'

        Hi Chris, I think we both do it pretty much the same way :-) I also pull
        the U/U' turns with the index fingers all the time, and i do tilt the
        cube a bit for the last two turns so it's almost like your l' U ending.
        Not sure I'm able to agree or disagree with splitting it up the way you
        did, after practicing it a while, it now feels like one long fluent
        motion (well, after the first three moves which still are a bit slow). I
        got a lot of low 11s already for doing it four times in a row, I didn't
        even get close to that with my previous alg. Once I would've had 10.5 or
        so but I screwed up stopping the stopwatch :-( Stefan --- In

        I really like the second alg. I think it's faster than the one I use
        now. Doing it a bunch of times, I only wound up with a half solved cube
        the first time around. I can understand mixing the alg up though - the
        guts of it really only contains L (l), U and R twists and it seems it'd
        be very easy to mix one of these up. I think this alg will be blazing
        fast once committed to muscle memory... Bryan Mytko bryanosaurus@... On

        lot, but when &gt; I first tried it I locked up very badly _every_ time
        I did it. The &gt; transition between the [L (U) (L' U')] and [R (U') L

        look for algs that have the [R (U') L (U) R'] trigger &gt; in them
        becuase it is so fast! For that trigger I do the (U') with my &gt; left

        Hi Bob! Maybe you practice algs to much and speed to little!? I take my
        time learning algs, and that way I get a lot of solves for each new alg
        that I learn. It also give my more F2L practice which, as you already
        know, is the key to great times. I won't be learning CLL before I master
        OLL perfectly, which means another one or two months of practice.

        here is an idea of my progress once I began &gt; &gt; "speedcubing" &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Feb. 7 - Switch from cross on top to cross on bottom,
        begin learning &gt; &gt; F2L instead of first layer corners -&gt; middle
        edges &gt; &gt; -- 2 week break from learning -- &gt; &gt; Mid-March -
        (2 weeks) - Learn PLL &gt; &gt; -- 2 week break from learning -- &gt;
        &gt; Begin taking averages with Fridrich for first time! :) &gt; &gt;
        Mid-April - (6 weeks, noncontinuous) - Learn OLL &gt; &gt; -- 6 week
        break from learning -- &gt; &gt; Mid-July - (2 weeks) - Learn COLL &gt;
        &gt; Late July - (2 days) - Learn VH edge control (connected first day,
        &gt; &gt; non-connected second day) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just over five
        months after I started learning Fridrich, I got the &gt; &gt; average
        that currently stands as my best, 23.49 seconds. Like &gt; &gt;
        everybody says, it's all about the F2L. My F2L sucks (17-18 second &gt;
        &gt; avg?), and it's the only reason why I'm not sub-20...maybe if I
        &gt; &gt; practiced for more than 3 hours per week? :( &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Don't learn all LL algs from the same place. That's bad. There are
        &gt; &gt; TONS of sites with different LL algs, and some will fit you
        better &gt; &gt; than others. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does this help?
        Everybody is different, you know that. :P &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remember,

        &gt; # THE ONLY CUBES ALLOWED FOR COMPETITION ROUNDS MUST BE AUTHENTIC
        &gt; RUBIK'S BRAND CUBES. COUNTERFEIT CUBES OR ALTERNATIVE CUBES WILL
        NOT &gt; BE ACCEPTED. My question is, how do they determine this? The
        latest DIY kits with PVC stickers do not include the Rubik logo on the
        central white sticker. Granted one of the center caps has an embossed
        logo but you can't really see it once the stickers are applied. The
        latest cubes all seem to have some kind of lot number printed inside one
        of the corners (visible at a 45 degree twist). For example, mine says
        M0105B (presumably manufactured January 2005?) But their older cubes did
        not have this feature. Would they allow a classic 80's Ideal cube? Do
        they disassemble your cube to verify its authenticity somehow? To me
        there would be no way to really tell some of the clones apart from the
        real thing. One other thought-- are the Rubik's brand white plastic
        cubes allowed? I plan to use a DIY cube, so no worries. I was just
        curious about that rule as well.

        It is still a design flaw and we have a right to complain. And yes, it
        is probably not hard to get used to. I don't understand why Speed Stacks
        made the changes they did to their timer. The new generation 2 mats seem
        more like a personal timer rather than a competition timer. For
        competitions using the new timer, the judge would need to be on top of

        actually this thought also went through my head. i remember that at the

        would we have to do that this time as well? or would the cubesmith

        In the past, stopwatches were a safety precaution, and the times
        recorded were only to be used in the event of a solve that takes longer
        than 10min (longer than what the stackmat can record). Now that we have
        time limits for each phase, (I think we do... right?), the stopwatches
        are no longer used to follow the solve. Their only purpose now is for
        the 15s preinspection phase. Leyan Sapan Upadhyay wrote: &gt; wait, isnt

        lol.. sounds a lot like my camp experience... which i will share with
        the world, because im bored and its kinda funny basically it was me and
        two other guys who signed up to solve the cube for our talent show. i
        showed up at the audition place and solved it in 19 seconds (which btw
        was my 3rd sub-20 time i had ever got.) at the actual talent show, one
        of my friends was in charge of creating music (he has this thing called
        the electribe, which basically is a beat synthesizer... its a beast),
        and he created some music to start us off. the MCs for the talent show
        then went on stage and threw out three cubes into the audience for them
        to mix up. then the mc comes back with my friends' cubes and they go up
        and both solve half of it and in the middle switch cubes and solve each
        other's cube (it took a little long for them though, because they'er not
        speedcubers and they were supposed to communicate to each other in some
        way when they were done, but something got lost in translation, so they
        spent about 30 extra seconds just messing around because they didnt know
        that the other was already done). all in all it took them like 2 minutes
        or so, which is still faster than anyone had camp (except those who knew
        me) had ever seen. in the meantime, the MC that had my cube came back
        with it all broken, because some kid accidently popped a couple of
        pieces. so i had to frantically put it back together and solve it really
        quickly to makd sure that i had put it in the right way. then i had to
        get someone in the back to scramble it for me (so they would be sure
        that i hadn't rigged it or anything). then i came onstage with my hoodie
        and polarized sunglasses and solved it in about 25 seconds (messed up on
        the cross and f2l and had a near pop). it was really cool because all of
        my friends had incited the crowd to chant my name.. though i actually
        didnt hear it because i was so nervous. man, its fun though :) On

        one month off internet, I'm finally back... I just &gt; attended an
        orchestra camp in Michigan, in case anyone cares where I &gt; was, it
        was fun but the orchestra sucked very, very badly, they had me &gt; play
        with the faculty orchestra and even that one was particularly &gt; bad.
        ANYWAY there were about 1200 kids there (yeah, orchestra was only &gt;
        one of the numerous majors there), but no need to say I was THE &gt;
        attraction of the camp, sadly not for my (*ahum*) amazing cello skills
        &gt; but for my cubing, which eventually became annoying after a while.
        I &gt; started to keep track on a notebook of every single time I got
        the &gt; stickers quote or the "is there a pattern to it" one but I lost
        count &gt; after a while (or got bored or both). Not talking about, I've
        done it &gt; once, I can do one side, oh dude that's freakin'awesome and
        so on. You &gt; know'em all. &gt; &gt; So basically there was that camp
        store, where they started selling &gt; cubes after I went to the talent
        show. They had some of these &gt; keychain-like cubes, only crappier and
        with the worst color scheme &gt; ever. It even says Made in china on one
        of the dark yellow corners &gt; (yep the scheme is like, dark yellow,
        light yellow, light blue, &gt; purple-ish, red/orange, green and pink
        duh). I so should get royalties &gt; from them, they're making money out
        of my talent. Not fair. Not &gt; talking about how I was giving cello
        lessons to the kids there... &gt; anyway. Yeah, so I stayed 2 sessions
        there, went to the talent show &gt; the first time and did an horrible
        23s 2-handed solve on stage, like, &gt; with a guy and his stopwatch
        next to me (the guy was huge, I was &gt; probably scared, like, a
        lumberjack or something). So i messed up the &gt; cross and the F2L and
        did 2 PLL, horrible. But I was still way faster &gt; than anyone the
        audience had ever seen before so it was cool. When I &gt; got back to
        the dorms, the counselor was like, it's the &gt; &gt; slowest solve I've
        ever seen you doing, but it was still awesome, &gt; so I guess I enjoyed
        doing it anyway. During the second session, I &gt; guess they must've
        heard I had the European record for a while or &gt; something, but I got
        a note from the administration, they wanted me to &gt; do the cube
        one-handed this time. Oh well. But I'm like, you know, &gt; having a guy
        standing alone on stage for 40s solving a rubik's cube is &gt; pretty
        boring and quite long though, plus since I haven't practiced &gt; for at
        least 2 months one-handed and it's not my usual OH cube, it &gt; might
        even get up to 50s, but they say, no, the kids're gonna love it. &gt;
        Ok. So this time, I dressed in black, with a very tight black t-shirt
        &gt; inside-out (yeah the outside said "I love Detroit" or something
        like &gt; that, not my shirt... too tight for me, but with the distance
        noone &gt; could guess I have no muscle...), took my Neo sunglasses with
        me on &gt; stage in my pocket and put some good Matrix music, and when
        the music &gt; started, I put my glasses on and &gt; &gt; started
        solving the cube one-handed. Everyone was screaming, that &gt; was so
        awesome... did quite well on this one, 36s. I was "THE" man... &gt; The
        music and the sunglasses worked perfectly with it. &gt; &gt; The sad
        part of it, besides the comments "hey are you the cube dude" &gt; or
        "did you know that the cube has been invented like, 50 years ago?", &gt;
        was all the ppl asking me to solve their crappy piece of shit they &gt;
        bought off the camp store I didn't even want to even touch (unless the
        &gt; person asking it was a girl and very very cute). We also have a
        dance &gt; at the end of each session, and I guess the cubing has been
        part of my &gt; success here... I should upload that picture of me
        solving the cube &gt; above my head while I'm dancing, it's hilarious...
        Oh and yes, while I &gt; was playing in the faculty/staff orchestra, we
        had that one piece &gt; (Ravel's Bolero for those who know it, it's
        roughly 18 minutes of &gt; straight C-GC-GC-GC-GC-G.....etc. for the
        cellos), very boring, where &gt; you don't even need both hands for
        playing, so I just plucked my cello &gt; as a guitar and solved the cube
        with the other hand, when I wasn't &gt; teaching the counselor next to
        me how to solve it. &gt; &gt; Last couple of factoids and then I'll
        pretty much be done about my &gt; random babbling about my camp
        experience. 1. do not take your best &gt; speedcube out with you at the
        pool, and 2. Coca-cola is not a good &gt; lubricant. A jackass spilled
        coke all over my bag and it ate the &gt; plastic of my cube away, it's
        horrible. It doesn't turn anymore. Never &gt; seen that before. &gt;
        &gt; Oh very last thing. I hate you guys. I forgot to change my &gt;
        preferences before I left, so I kept receiving the emails in my &gt;
        regular box. Result: 942 new emails when I got back yesterday. still a
        &gt; bit over 300 to go. Go figure. &gt; &gt; j/k. I love you all. &gt;
        &gt; Francois &gt; &gt; PS. But still... 942... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        spits out (among lots of others): &gt; U F' R U R' U' L' U R U' R' F R'
        F' L F R U' &gt; &gt; 2. I remove U/U' at start/end and rewrite like
        this: &gt; (F' R U R' U') (L' U) (R U') (l' U R' U') (L U l) &gt; &gt;
        3. Because I don't like to start with F', I invert it: &gt; l' U' L' U R
        U' l U R' U' L U R U' R' F &gt; &gt; I like the F&lt;-&gt;B mirror as
        well and will practice it a bit, but I &gt; guess I'll stick to the

        Hey Bob I actually really like that algorithm. I used to use one that
        was similar, but yours changes at the u2' (I believe I got it off of
        Jesse Bond's site). But I really like the flow of yours, so I switched
        to that one a few weeks ago. I struggled with the u2' as well at first,
        but now I use my index finger, as I am brining that last R' up, I place
        I on the right yellow edge and push down, then the rest just flies.
        Thanks for that, by the way. Now if only I could find a better alg for
        your PLL case 4. I will have to try yours out, but I am not a fan of
        slice moves most of the time. -Dave

        Maybe you practice algs to much and speed to little!? I take my time
        &gt; &gt; learning algs, and that way I get a lot of solves for each new
        alg &gt; &gt; that I learn. It also give my more F2L practice which, as
        you &gt; &gt; already know, is the key to great times. I won't be
        learning CLL &gt; &gt; before I master OLL perfectly, which means
        another one or two months &gt; &gt; of practice. &gt; &gt; I don't
        really practice algs that much, pretty much only when I'm &gt; walking
        on my way to class or something like that when I should be &gt; watching
        where I'm going. ;) Since there is nothing that I feel is &gt; critical
        for me to learn, I decided that it will be pure F2L practice &gt; from
        now until I am sub-20, and then I will consider tackling &gt; something
        new. &gt; &gt; ~ Bob &gt; &gt; PS ~ I saw a video of you doing the
        2-cube. Very nice. :)

        Hi friends, Tyson and I created a draft version of the WCA regulations,
        version 2005. You can find the draft version at:
        http://www.speedcubing.com/events/regulations_draft2005.html Our goals
        for this version were to not change the basic rules and procedures, but
        improve the text and remove unclear things. On the bottom of the page
        you can find a list of changes. You are all very welcome to send in your
        comments, additions and other suggestions. For your feedback please use
        the WCA forum at http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum If you want
        to see text or regulations changed, then please post a new text
        proposal. We want to finalize this version on September 5, 2 months
        before WC 2005. So don't wait too long with your feedback. We are
        looking forward to a positive discussion. We expect that there won't be
        a consensus on all issues. In that case the WCA board will need to make
        a decision. For the 2006 version we are open to discuss some bigger
        changes. Thanks and have fun, Ron

        I am sorry too.. you can rebuild it using fishing wire. but this is a
        hard thing to do yourself... I have the same problem and until today I
        haven't fixed it. Time ago, rubiks.com offered magic DIY, but not now
        and I think it will never be on sale again. I found some web pages were
        you can take some ideas on how to rebuild your magic.

        I've learned something today : never use a Magic whom doesn't have all
        his strings. It just felt completely apart as 2 others strings broke. So
        I have to rebuild it completely :-( The thing is that I don't know how
        to do that and the booklet doesn't explain how to rebuild it... Could
        you explain me how to put back all the strings (I have to make new ones)
        or give me an address where I can find that ? Thanks (hopefully I'll
        have a new one on monday :p)

        against the trough in the cube and if you try to lever that way you

        Yeah, I had a few issues but I was able to work it out. I was in Taiwan
        last year and most people my age in Taipei do not speak Taiwanese so I
        had to use Mandarin. Unfortunately, my Mandarin is very weak. I feel
        ashamed because I've forgotten how to say 'clockwise' and
        'counter-clockwise'. I was able to get through it though. After I
        explained notation, it was relatively easy. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        I perform all of my M, M', and M2 moves that way, because they are
        always followed by U, U', or U2. It's super fast, and I don't need to
        shift my hands at all in order to begin the next move. I began doing it
        this way when I started practicing with the Roux method, and it works
        wonders. The 3 cycle PLL clockwise takes me under 1.5, the
        anti-clockwise one takes 1.5, and the cross PLL takes me about 1.3. I
        found an algorithm only using U, U2, M', and M2 riding in a car on the
        way to the Netherlands the other day but I haven't practiced it enough
        to be very fast, yet. I currently use the case from Dan Knights' site,
        but I suspect with practice the newer one will be faster than my already
        sub-2 alg. M2' U M2' U M' U2 M2' U2 M' U2. (insert several minutes here)
        I've just discovered that speedcubing.com has a similar algorithm, which
        is a move shorter, and I think, after playing with it, I'll wind up with
        this: M2' U M' U2' M2' U2' M' U' M2' I do all of the U2 turns as a click
        with my left index finger followed by the left middle finger. It will be

        Back when I was still using a 4-look last layer, I only had to know 3
        PLLs (well you only actually have to know 1, but knowing 3 helps) and up
        until now I was still using the same one. It was by far my slowest case
        but I don't tend to see it that often. It was from Fridrich's site : Ls
        Ds2 Ls D Ls2 U' Bs2 (Ds2 is horrible...) I was actually thinking the
        other day that I should try and find a new one. The PLL which handles
        opposite edges can be sub-2 easily, and this one is rather similar, so I
        definitely think it can be as well. By the way, I think me and you have
        a similar cubing style, especially for LL - for PLL I used to collect
        algs from various websites but found that nearly all the ones on your
        site are best for my hands. (except I really don't like your U perm
        [cycle 3 edges], I can do 1.2s with mine) Bryan Mytko bryanosaurus@...

        I assume he means the LL alg which just permutes 3 edges. If the 4th
        step of the 4-look LL is to permute the edges then this is the only alg
        that you need to know if going for absolute minimum memorisation.
        Depending on the LL case though the alg may need to be repeated multiple

        Yeah what I was saying was for a 4-look LL, where you fix the corners
        and only have to permute edges. As far as one PLL for all cases, that's
        curious.... If it IS possible, we could limit it to only PLLs that move

        I tried teaching my cousin in Taiwan this year. My Mandarin was really
        bad and my cousin couldn't speak English at all. After trying
        unsuccessfully to explain the notation to him, I gave up and drew all
        the turns for the algs on a piece of paper. On the steps that didn't
        require algs, I was like "turn this way, then this way, then this way,
        then this way..." while turing the cube to let him see (and he was
        teasing me because of that). I was able to teach him how to solve it
        that way. Alan Chang --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        It seems that sub-14 averages are becoming pretty common these days. I
        remember 3 years ago when I began speed-cubing, Dan Gosbee was the best
        cuber with an incredible 16.89 that looked impossible to beat. Things
        have changed a lot! Gilles.

        looked impossible &gt; to &gt; &gt; beat. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Things have changed a lot! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Gilles. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For non-cubers even
        sub-1 minute avg is incredible ?=)

        About Stefan's question: If you allow mirror algs, several different PLL
        algs can be used. However, if mirrors are not allowed, then one may
        reason as follows: First, the alg must obviously permute both edges and
        corners. Otherwise, cases that permute both would be impossible to
        solve. Second, if the alg only switches a pair of edges and a pair of
        corners, neither the edges nor the corners can be opposite because this
        would make 3-cycles of that type of piece impossible to solve. This
        leaves the L, R, and G PLLs. L can be ruled out because each edge and
        corner next to it are permuted together and cannot be separated. R can
        similarly be ruled out by thinking of the separate pairs that are
        permuted "together" (ex. UFL/UR and UFR/UB). G, on the other hand, might
        work. I tried it several times and repeatedly made edge and corner
        3-cycles (which would be enough to solve PLL), but I can't be sure
        because I often (accidentally) did the mirror of the alg. Later, Ravi

        hey, I haven't been to this group in AGES, I pretty much don't post here
        anymore. still cubin' though. anyway, I donno if anyone's mentioned this
        already, I'm guessing no, so. a couple weeks ago my family and I went to
        Silverwood, a theme park near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. At the restaurant
        there they always have entertainment and stuff going on. Today, they had
        a juggler, and I thought that was pretty awesome because I'm a bit of a
        juggler myself. but what REALLY intrigued me is his final act was
        solving a rubiks cube WHILE juggling!! so I thought that was totally
        awesome. it took him like five minutes, but still cool (: after the show
        I talked to him, of course I had my cube with me, so I got to show off
        properly. So, he said that one of his friends told him about this guy on
        the internet who could solve a rubiks cube while juggling, and this
        kinda bummed him out, because he thought that he was the only guy to
        have done that. so he looked online, of course it was Macky, and he
        downloaded the video and all. But then he told me that he thinks Macky
        was CHEATING, because Macky's not juggling and solving at the same time,
        he's juggling two balls in one hand, and solving the cube in the other.
        This performer was juggling all of them, going back and forth between
        the two hands, so the cube was in both his left and right hand an equal
        amount of time. so Macky, you should take that as a challenge, learn to
        do it right, you cheater (; just kiddin, I can't even do it your way,
        much less while juggling all of them together. just thought I'd share (:

        Was he juggling 3 rubik's cubes and solving them all, or just one cube
        and 2 balls and just solving the one cube? Pretty cool nonetheless -

        Hi friends, With all these new young talented cubers around, I begin to
        feel old!!! :-( I was wondering whether age matters, like in other
        sports/hobbies. Is cubing more like swimming (most records set under age
        of 20) or marathon (for the older guys/girls)? &gt;From recent
        experiences and competitions I extracted the following observations: -
        young people's addiction and dedication are stronger - young people have
        more spare time - young people learn faster - young people have speedier
        fingers and more dexterity - young people have fewer problems with
        nerves Am I right? Personally I spend too much time on the websites and
        organizing tournaments. I have a family and a busy job. Lots of excuses,
        but no excuse to perform badly in competitions. It looks like the young
        cubers are taking over! (Except for the bigger cubes, still...) Have
        fun, Ron PS: let us NOT start an [OldCubers Team] :-)

        &gt; Hi friends, &gt; &gt; With all these new young talented cubers
        around, I begin to feel &gt; old!!! :-( &gt; &gt; I was wondering
        whether age matters, like in other sports/hobbies. &gt; Is cubing more
        like swimming (most records set under age of 20) or &gt; marathon (for
        the older guys/girls)? I had a very long discussion with Stefan, back in
        february. We did NOT agree :-). I'm 36 now, and have experienced
        learning cubing twice : 25 years ago, and now. I'm 100% sure that my
        physical (including brain) abilities have changed slightly in between.
        It took me less than 1 month when I was 12 to reach around 36-40'' avg,
        using a LBL method (around 100 moves). I was only cubing for 1 hour a
        day. My dexterity has gone down today, even if I am sub29 now. I'm sure
        that 25 years ago, if I had learnt the fridrich and spent the same
        amount of time as today, I would be close to sub20. &gt; From recent
        experiences and competitions I extracted the following &gt;
        observations: &gt; - young people's addiction and dedication are
        stronger I'm not sure about this one. This has NOT changed for me. &gt;
        - young people have more spare time That's right. &gt; - young people
        learn faster Definitely right. I've been teaching bridge to juniors
        (&lt; 25yo) and elderly (&gt; 60yo). These people have : - the same
        motivation ; - the same spare time (elderly having even more) ; - the
        same education ; Juniors learn lightning fast in comparison to elderly.

        decreases of cognitive abilities throughout the years are presented. In
        cubing, I guess that short-term memory also plays a huge role. It

        competitions. We share the same excuses. I don't even attempt comps ;).
        &gt; It looks like the young cubers are taking over! &gt; (Except for
        the bigger cubes, still...) People less than 30 should have a 5''

        I have to agree with most of this. My main experience is in chess where
        players tend to peak at about 30-32. But there isnt the same physical
        element in chess so I think speedcubing probably favours the young
        slightly more. There are examples of chess players (e.g. Korchnoi,
        Smyslov) playing very strong chess into their 70s - but even then they
        aren't as good as in their youth. Their vast experience compensates
        somewhat for a drop in speed of thought. My feeling is that academics
        also suffer from a drop off as they age. Most mathematicians produce
        their best work in their 20's early 30's - that is their most creative
        work. Experience in this field can provide much greater compensation for
        slower thought speed though. If we had professional speedcubers then
        some of the other advantages of youth wouldnt be quite so pronounced -
        shame no-one will pay us a wage to speedcube :( I think nerves is more a
        personal thing than age related. And for some people nerves can be a
        good thing. I usually do better in competition or when demonstrating
        even though I get very nervous! Still there are some very fast old
        cubers out there so don't write us off. And we may be just as good at
        contributing to the theory! If only I was 18 again (sigh). Duncan -----

        &gt;&gt; Hi friends, &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; With all these new young talented
        cubers around, I begin to feel &gt;&gt; old!!! :-( &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I
        was wondering whether age matters, like in other sports/hobbies.
        &gt;&gt; Is cubing more like swimming (most records set under age of 20)
        or &gt;&gt; marathon (for the older guys/girls)? &gt; &gt; I had a very
        long discussion with Stefan, back in february. &gt; We did NOT agree
        :-). &gt; I'm 36 now, and have experienced learning cubing twice : 25
        years &gt; ago, and now. I'm 100% sure that my physical (including
        brain) &gt; abilities have changed slightly in between. &gt; It took me
        less than 1 month when I was 12 to reach around 36-40'' &gt; avg, using
        a LBL method (around 100 moves). I was only cubing for &gt; 1 hour a
        day. &gt; My dexterity has gone down today, even if I am sub29 now. &gt;
        I'm sure that 25 years ago, if I had learnt the fridrich and spent &gt;
        the same amount of time as today, I would be close to sub20. &gt;
        &gt;&gt; From recent experiences and competitions I extracted the
        following &gt;&gt; observations: &gt;&gt; - young people's addiction and
        dedication are stronger &gt; &gt; I'm not sure about this one. This has
        NOT changed for me. &gt; &gt;&gt; - young people have more spare time
        &gt; &gt; That's right. &gt; &gt;&gt; - young people learn faster &gt;
        &gt; Definitely right. I've been teaching bridge to juniors (&lt; 25yo)
        &gt; and elderly (&gt; 60yo). These people have : &gt; - the same
        motivation ; &gt; - the same spare time (elderly having even more) ;
        &gt; - the same education ; &gt; Juniors learn lightning fast in
        comparison to elderly. &gt; &gt; There's also scientific evidence.
        There's an excellent book (in &gt; french :-() made by Alain Lieury

        like five minutes, but still cool (: &gt; after the show I talked to
        him, of course I had my cube with me, so I &gt; got to show off
        properly. So, he said that one of his friends told &gt; him about this
        guy on the internet who could solve a rubiks cube while &gt; juggling,
        and this kinda bummed him out, because he thought that he &gt; was the

        Macky, and he downloaded the video and all. But then he told me &gt;
        that he thinks Macky was CHEATING, because Macky's not juggling and &gt;
        solving at the same time, he's juggling two balls in one hand, and &gt;
        solving the cube in the other. This performer was juggling all of &gt;
        them, going back and forth between the two hands, so the cube was in
        &gt; both his left and right hand an equal amount of time. &gt; &gt; so
        Macky, you should take that as a challenge, learn to do it right, &gt;

        Hey Ron, You may be right about some issue's here. - young people's
        addiction and dedication are stronger. You may be right.. But your
        dedication beats everybody ;). - young people have more spare time Yes..
        That's definately true.. I am very blessed with my spare time as a
        student, I guess. - young people have speedier fingers and more
        dexterity Hmm.. I don't really know if this is true. People like Jessica
        Fridrich, Katsu, you, etc. also seem to be pretty dexterous (how do you
        spell that word?). I am not sure if there is a significant difference
        here. - young people have fewer problems with nerves On this point I
        have to disagree. I kinda believe the 'nerves' issue is not influenced
        by age. Everybody gets nervous, but there are just some people who can
        'transform' that feeling into a positive 'emotion'. &gt; It looks like
        the young cubers are taking over! &gt; (Except for the bigger cubes,
        still...) Yes.. There are quite a few talented young cubers getting
        faster right now.. Maybe it's because a lot of young people who get into
        cubing know to find their way around the internet better. And about the
        bigger cubes: I am working on the 4x4 a little right now... Hope to
        catch up with Koen and Michael sometime... &gt; PS: let us NOT start an
        [OldCubers Team] :-) Whahaha! That's just hilarious... :D LOL. &gt;
        Personally I spend too much time on the websites and organizing &gt;
        tournaments. I have a family and a busy job. Lots of excuses, but no
        &gt; excuse to perform badly in competitions. You don't need to excuse
        yourself Ron. We all get nervous in competitions. I still haven't
        figured out how to get rid of that feeling during competition (maybe I
        should get into 'hypnotherapy', LOL). One thing I do at home sometimes
        is just tell my self to go slower. Like I say 'speedlimit: 3
        moves/second'. Well not really that strict :)... Anyways, I did the same
        thing during my 14.99 solve in Germany. It didn't help me in every
        solve, but I believe that learning a fluent and 'slow' kind of cubing
        style will pay off in competitions... (I don't claim to be an expert

        &gt; anyway, I donno if anyone's mentioned this already, I'm guessing
        no, &gt; &gt; so. a couple weeks ago my family and I went to Silverwood,
        a theme &gt; &gt; park near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. At the restaurant
        there they always &gt; &gt; have entertainment and stuff going on.
        Today, they had a juggler, and &gt; &gt; I thought that was pretty
        awesome because I'm a bit of a juggler &gt; &gt; myself. but what REALLY
        intrigued me is his final act was solving a &gt; &gt; rubiks cube WHILE
        juggling!! so I thought that was totally awesome. &gt; &gt; it took him
        like five minutes, but still cool (: &gt; &gt; after the show I talked
        to him, of course I had my cube with me, so I &gt; &gt; got to show off
        properly. So, he said that one of his friends told &gt; &gt; him about
        this guy on the internet who could solve a rubiks cube while &gt; &gt;
        juggling, and this kinda bummed him out, because he thought that he &gt;
        &gt; was the only guy to have done that. so he looked online, of course
        it &gt; &gt; was Macky, and he downloaded the video and all. But then he
        told me &gt; &gt; that he thinks Macky was CHEATING, because Macky's not
        juggling and &gt; &gt; solving at the same time, he's juggling two balls
        in one hand, and &gt; &gt; solving the cube in the other. This performer
        was juggling all of &gt; &gt; them, going back and forth between the two
        hands, so the cube was in &gt; &gt; both his left and right hand an
        equal amount of time. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so Macky, you should take that
        as a challenge, learn to do it right, &gt; &gt; you cheater (; just
        kiddin, I can't even do it your way, much less &gt; &gt; while juggling
        all of them together. just thought I'd share (: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi! Us veterans who have been cubing since those early days in 1980/81,
        we won't win anything in competition by knowing theory of the cube. Sad
        but true ;-) However i find that my experience and theoretical insight
        gives me advantages on the larger cubes and particularly in fewest
        moves. So far i haven't really seen any cubing "prodigy" doing well or
        consistently well in fewest moves. Or to put it another way. I haven't
        really seen a top top class 3x3x3 speedcuber doing well in fewest moves.
        They are sufficiently incompatible to be very hard to master both :-)
        And im glad for that cause im a lousy 3x3x3 speedcuber ;-) Another
        benefit of being a true veteran is that we have dealt with the pleasures
        of cubing for a much longer time. We have had more fun ;-) Cheers! -Per

        main experience is in chess where &gt; players tend to peak at about
        30-32. But there isnt the same physical &gt; element in chess so I think
        speedcubing probably favours the young slightly &gt; more. There are
        examples of chess players (e.g. Korchnoi, Smyslov) playing &gt; very
        strong chess into their 70s - but even then they aren't as good as in
        &gt; their youth. Their vast experience compensates somewhat for a drop
        in speed &gt; of thought. My feeling is that academics also suffer from
        a drop off as &gt; they age. Most mathematicians produce their best work
        in their 20's early &gt; 30's - that is their most creative work.
        Experience in this field can &gt; provide much greater compensation for
        slower thought speed though. &gt; &gt; If we had professional
        speedcubers then some of the other advantages of &gt; youth wouldnt be
        quite so pronounced - shame no-one will pay us a wage to &gt; speedcube
        &gt; :( &gt; &gt; I think nerves is more a personal thing than age
        related. And for some &gt; people nerves can be a good thing. I usually
        do better in competition or &gt; when demonstrating even though I get
        very nervous! &gt; &gt; Still there are some very fast old cubers out
        there so don't write us off. &gt; And we may be just as good at
        contributing to the theory! &gt; &gt; If only I was 18 again (sigh).

        matter? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi friends, &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        With all these new young talented cubers around, I begin to feel &gt;
        &gt;&gt; old!!! :-( &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I was wondering whether
        age matters, like in other sports/hobbies. &gt; &gt;&gt; Is cubing more
        like swimming (most records set under age of 20) or &gt; &gt;&gt;
        marathon (for the older guys/girls)? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I had a very
        long discussion with Stefan, back in february. &gt; &gt; We did NOT
        agree :-). &gt; &gt; I'm 36 now, and have experienced learning cubing
        twice : 25 years &gt; &gt; ago, and now. I'm 100% sure that my physical
        (including brain) &gt; &gt; abilities have changed slightly in between.
        &gt; &gt; It took me less than 1 month when I was 12 to reach around 36-
        40'' &gt; &gt; avg, using a LBL method (around 100 moves). I was only
        cubing for &gt; &gt; 1 hour a day. &gt; &gt; My dexterity has gone down
        today, even if I am sub29 now. &gt; &gt; I'm sure that 25 years ago, if
        I had learnt the fridrich and spent &gt; &gt; the same amount of time as
        today, I would be close to sub20. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; From recent
        experiences and competitions I extracted the following &gt; &gt;&gt;
        observations: &gt; &gt;&gt; - young people's addiction and dedication
        are stronger &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure about this one. This has
        NOT changed for me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; - young people have more
        spare time &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's right. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; -
        young people learn faster &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Definitely right. I've
        been teaching bridge to juniors (&lt; 25yo) &gt; &gt; and elderly (&gt;
        60yo). These people have : &gt; &gt; - the same motivation ; &gt; &gt; -
        the same spare time (elderly having even more) ; &gt; &gt; - the same
        education ; &gt; &gt; Juniors learn lightning fast in comparison to
        elderly. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There's also scientific evidence. There's
        an excellent book (in &gt; &gt; french :-() made by Alain Lieury
        ("Psychologie de la m√©moire, histoire, &gt; &gt; th√©orie, exp√©riences",
        Dunod), in which scientifical studies &gt; &gt; about decreases of
        cognitive abilities throughout the years &gt; &gt; are presented. In
        cubing, I guess that short-term memory also &gt; &gt; plays a huge role.
        It decreases regularly from age 20 till &gt; &gt; death :-). &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I think the only advantage that older people have over younger
        &gt; &gt; maybe "experience". They may be able to use their "slightly"
        &gt; &gt; reduced capacities better than the younger... to a certain
        extent. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; - young people have speedier
        fingers and more dexterity &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe. &gt; &gt; Muscle
        tone also decreases years after year. &gt; &gt; But when I think about
        Glen Gould or Richter, I'm wondering &gt; &gt; about loss of
        dexterity... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; - young people have fewer problems
        with nerves &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think so. &gt; &gt; This is IMO
        some part of all sports (being mindgames or true &gt; &gt; sports) where
        you can work A LOT, not depending on ur age. &gt; &gt; Nowadays, top
        competitors very often have a coach AND a &gt; &gt; psy in order to cope
        with competition pressure, which can &gt; &gt; devastate your abilities.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Am I right? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think so. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Personally I spend too much time on the websites and
        organizing &gt; &gt;&gt; tournaments. I have a family and a busy job.
        Lots of excuses, but no &gt; &gt;&gt; excuse to perform badly in
        competitions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We share the same excuses. I don't
        even attempt comps ;). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It looks like the young
        cubers are taking over! &gt; &gt;&gt; (Except for the bigger cubes,
        still...) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; People less than 30 should have a 5''
        handicap in comps, IMO. &gt; &gt; -- &gt; &gt; FD. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Alright, I have this problem...I can solve the cube edges/wings, before

        also does Sudoku another grid with the numbers 1,2,... on which &gt;

        goes in the square below that I've &gt; labelled with "@". The third one
        goes where the # is. &gt; (If you get really stuck, I can post a

        minor physical problem that I didn't have then is a tenderness and

        objects; e.g., people's faces would appear somehow "dislocated" or

        I'm 28 and I have a similar problem when cubing for too long. The cube
        itself starts to get distorted and uneven like the back face was smaller
        than the front. (It's a natural high) But I think this only happens when
        I'm hungry or something. To cube in a a moving car is a NO NO, I get

        &gt; I don't think this have anything to do with age... or does it? All
        I can say is that it was no longer a problem when I started puzzling
        "seriously" after a break of many years. Perhaps I'm not trying hard
        enough. :) Mike

        Dallas tournament was so cool. It was my first tournament and im a new
        cuber, relatively, and havent practiced that much but by far, that
        tournament was amazing. I just want to say that Bob Burton was downright
        amazing at Rubik's Magic and Master Magic. I had never seen anyone do it
        before, so i was just amazed. It was great. Chris Hardwick was amazing
        with his 55.xx (cant remember) second solve on the 4x4x4, and Macky was
        amazing with his oh, Blindfolded, and speed solve. Everyone was just
        amazing -parth P.S. Texas is awesome. Dont mess with Texas :-D

        Even doing a layer method on the 3x3 you should be able to get under a
        minute. Learning Fridrich F2L is very easy - it's all intuitive.
        Learning the optimized algs is a little harder, but using intuitive
        method should ensure you are under a minute. Bryan Mytko

        a new method for &gt; &gt; 5x5...and I need to learn fridrich...I made
        this rule for &gt; &gt; myself...that if I can't learn Fridrich, or I
        can't get sub-minute &gt; &gt; (for now) average, then I am not
        coming...but if I do...watch out...If &gt; &gt; I am at the world
        championships you can expect some great things from &gt; &gt; the sole
        Canadian at the championships...10 national records...here I &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually first I only saw the
        paper on the right, I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recognized &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; it's &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; part of
        Chris's 4x4 solution and I thought you must &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have the

        &gt; &gt; &gt; page somewhere, too. Then between my two posts I saw &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; the paper &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; gotten into &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speedsolving it...and am
        trying to better my times...but the &gt; &gt; &gt; stickers &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; are starting to peel... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Haha, I wasn't offended by lack of stickers :) Just &gt; trying to
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offer a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solution
        because I know how bad the Rubik's stickers are. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; On a new cube mine start peeling after a few days. &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I find it funny that you can identify a move by

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually
        first I only saw the paper on the &gt; right, I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        recognized &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; part of Chris's 4x4 solution and I
        thought you &gt; must &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; second &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; page somewhere, too. Then between my two posts &gt; I saw &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the paper &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Had a great time myself. The talent there was simply amazing! Bob
        inspired me and I came home and started working with my magic, got my
        first sub 3 second solve today :). Frank and Chris inspired me and I'm
        going to try getting those stinkin big cube times down (thanks for the
        tips Frank!). And even my father, who has been somewhat nonchalant about
        my cubing for the past 4 years has asked me to teach him how to do it
        after attending the competition! It really was a spectacular time,
        highlight of my summer by far. I'd like to make an addendum to the
        controversial statement: "I hate Texas...roads." I mean really, they are
        very poorly marked! Lastly, I'm working up a megaminx solution as
        promised to some of the guys. I'll post it when it gets up, but drawing
        pentagons is hard! Hope to see you all sometime soon, Daniel --- In

        It was my first tournament and im a new &gt; cuber, relatively, and
        havent practiced that much but by far, that &gt; tournament was amazing.
        &gt; &gt; I just want to say that Bob Burton was downright amazing at
        Rubik's &gt; Magic and Master Magic. I had never seen anyone do it
        before, so i was &gt; just amazed. It was great. &gt; &gt; Chris
        Hardwick was amazing with his 55.xx (cant remember) second solve &gt; on
        the 4x4x4, and Macky was amazing with his oh, Blindfolded, and &gt;
        speed solve. &gt; &gt; Everyone was just amazing &gt; &gt; -parth &gt;

        &gt; I'm going to try getting those stinkin big cube times down (thanks
        for &gt; the tips Frank!). And even my father, who has been somewhat
        &gt; nonchalant about my cubing for the past 4 years has asked me to
        teach &gt; him how to do it after attending the competition! &gt; It
        really was a spectacular time, highlight of my summer by far. &gt; I'd
        like to make an addendum to the controversial statement: "I hate &gt;

        I'm working up a megaminx solution as promised to some of &gt; the guys.
        I'll post it when it gets up, but drawing pentagons is &gt; hard! &gt;

        Initially, I began one handing with my left hand, even though I'm a
        right handed person with everything else. Somehow, my left hand was
        faster at it, and I've been working my times down to between 1:00 and
        1:30. The past few days, however, I've tried using my right hand and to
        great success. I'm now even between my two hands, despite having only
        practiced occasionally and almost never with the right. I've also
        noticed several things that have helped me improve immensely in the past
        few days. For turns that are easy to perform in one direction, the
        inverse is often very difficult. I used to resort to sort of pushing the
        face with my fingertip, but it was very slow. I realized that it's much
        easier to slightly shift where you grip the cube, and turn the opposite
        two layers. Example, since I'm certain that isn't very clear: U' is very
        hard for me in my right hand. Instead, I now grab the U side, and then
        turn d' with my middle and ring fingers. Also, I've learned that going
        slower than a two handed solve works wonders for looking ahead. I can
        see easy ways to help with multislotting, and to orient LL edges on the
        third and fourth pairs. I've noticed that often, however, COLL is not
        very helpful, except in certain very simple cases. I usually do better
        with my 3 look OLL/PLL. Perhaps once out of ten solves, I use a 4 look
        LL, because I have trouble with certain PLL cases one handed. I try to
        use COLL when it comes up because it's good practice, but with only one
        hand, I find the simple edge PLL's are very difficult. Also, a lot of my
        COLL algs use both slice and LUR moves, which are hard to reach with one
        hand. Anywho, I'm not much of an expert, but these are just some of the
        things I've noticed in the past few days. -Mike Bennett &gt;From: "Craig

        For most cases I use the same algorithms.. But for some cases, it's easy
        to choose a more OH-friedly algorithm. For example: Two hands: RUR' F'
        RUR'U' R'F R2U' R'U' One hand: U LU'R U2 L' U L U2 R'L' I can do the
        last one pretty fast with one hand.. I kinda execute it with the U face
        on the right, so I can do the L moves with my left index, and some of
        the U moves with my (also left :)) ring finger. The last R'L' can be
        done at the same time this way :). Other example: Two hands: M2 U M2 U2
        M2 U M2 One hand: LR U2 L'R' y' L'R' U2 LR These are of course just my

        I also had a great time at the tournament. I enjoyed seeing the Horace

        goals: a sub 20 solve and a successful BLD solve, but overall I think I
        could have done a bit better. I can't wait until the next tournament I

        Hey Stefan, Well, I've not stopped minxing, but I haven't been hitting
        it as hard either. I'm really going to hunker down in case I get to go
        to Florida though. I didn't train quite as much as I would've liked to
        for the Dallas tourney, but I did shave a couple seconds off my average.
        The times you've been throwing down are simply incredible, as is your
        video on strangepuzzle.com . We're all going to have to work hard to get
        anywhere near you! I hope I get to see you in action with my own eyes
        sometime soon! Best, Daniel --- In

        one hand? &gt; &gt; On 8/15/05, Mike Bennett

        handing with my left hand, even though I'm a right &gt; &gt; handed
        person with everything else. Somehow, my left hand was faster at it,
        &gt; &gt; and I've been working my times down to between 1:00 and 1:30.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The past few days, however, I've tried using my
        right hand and to great &gt; &gt; success. I'm now even between my two
        hands, despite having only practiced &gt; &gt; occasionally and almost
        never with the right. I've also noticed several &gt; &gt; things that
        have helped me improve immensely in the past few days. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; For turns that are easy to perform in one direction, the inverse is
        often &gt; &gt; very difficult. I used to resort to sort of pushing the
        face with my &gt; &gt; fingertip, but it was very slow. I realized that
        it's much easier to &gt; &gt; slightly shift where you grip the cube,
        and turn the opposite two layers. &gt; &gt; Example, since I'm certain
        that isn't very clear: U' is very hard for me in &gt; &gt; my right
        hand. Instead, I now grab the U side, and then turn d' with my &gt; &gt;
        middle and ring fingers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I've learned that
        going slower than a two handed solve works wonders &gt; &gt; for looking
        ahead. I can see easy ways to help with multislotting, and to &gt; &gt;
        orient LL edges on the third and fourth pairs. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've
        noticed that often, however, COLL is not very helpful, except in &gt;
        &gt; certain very simple cases. I usually do better with my 3 look
        OLL/PLL. &gt; &gt; Perhaps once out of ten solves, I use a 4 look LL,
        because I have trouble &gt; &gt; with certain PLL cases one handed. I
        try to use COLL when it comes up &gt; &gt; because it's good practice,
        but with only one hand, I find the simple edge &gt; &gt; PLL's are very
        difficult. Also, a lot of my COLL algs use both slice and &gt; &gt; LUR
        moves, which are hard to reach with one hand. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Anywho, I'm not much of an expert, but these are just some of the things
        &gt; &gt; I've noticed in the past few days. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Mike

        Even before seeing Duncan's reply, I immediately recognised this cube!
        Yep, Duncan's right, these cubes have been available in Canberra over
        the past few years, although I very much doubt that they are actually
        manufactured in Australia. It was briefly my main speedcube, and yes I
        was using it at Worlds 2003. All the other cubers laughed at my cube. :(
        ;) I didn't realise how crappy the cube was until I tried everyone
        else's cube. After Worlds I used the cube they gave us there, and now
        I'm using a 25th anniversary cube which is very nice. These 'smoothest
        cubes' are not so smooth straight out of the box, but loosenly up A LOT
        (too much!) which a little silicone. The cube is probably fine for a
        beginner, but I wouldn't recommend a non-beginner getting one of these
        cubes. Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com --- In

        Hey everyone, I want to make a webpage with my 4x4 solution on it,
        speedsolve and not the current intermediate/beginner approach I have on
        my site now. I made the pictures for my current page myself, and I don't
        think they look very professional. Is there a program like Lars
        Vandenbergh's ImageCube available for 4x4x4? If not would anyone with
        some graphic savvy skills be willing to help me make a blank 4x4x4
        template? I would just need to be able to use the fill tool in photoshop
        to color the blank squares different colors and save as for a new
        picture file. I really am not very graphics savvy, and I'd like this
        page to look nice. Thanks to anyone who responds, Chris

        You can imagine why I would be skeptical at something like this. I think
        it's pretty much close to without a doubt that there is no better cuber
        in the world than Macky. Do you realize the combined cubing + juggling
        skill that Macky has? Macky, though not the best juggler in the world,
        is probably better than this amusement park performer. I mean, how good
        of a juggler was this guy? Are you a juggler yourself? There are many
        unskilled jugglers who get by doing tricks that don't take much
        technical skill, but look very impressive to someone who doesn't juggle
        much. It is of my suspicion that the amusement park performer can't do
        this. If you could give us a detailed description of what was going on,
        I'd probably be more convinced. Quinn Lewis can flash 8 balls I believe.
        I'm pretty sure he'll tell you that it's pretty hard to juggle a ball
        and a cube in one hand, and throw the ball high enough to make three
        moves with one-hand on a cube. Unless the guy can juggle 7 balls, he's
        not better at juggling than Macky and we certainly know he's not a
        better cuber than Macky. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        well, it looked like he was just juggling normally...kind of slowly, I

        By the way, all of this was in a previous thread. I had already posted

        doing tricks that &gt; don't &gt; take much technical skill, but look
        very impressive to someone who &gt; doesn't juggle much. It is of my
        suspicion that the amusement park &gt; performer can't do this. Maybe,
        but I'm pretty sure it is possible to do this using a 55113 juggle
        pattern (in siteswap notation), because then you have 2 beats in which
        to do a cube turn. Or even a 7711113 pattern. To do it properly, you
        need to be able to throw the cube across without it rotating in space.
        If I could juggle that pattern well enough to do this, I would still use
        a prepared scramble, and just memorize the colours of the faces that
        need to be turned. Probably just a repeated cycle of 6 colours. Jaap

        be ruled out &gt; because each edge and corner next to it are permuted
        &gt; together and cannot be separated. R can similarly be &gt; ruled out
        by thinking of the separate pairs that are &gt; permuted "together" (ex.
        UFL/UR and UFR/UB). I agree with all this. &gt; G, on the other hand,
        might work. Although G is the only candidate left, it can also be ruled
        out. The following argument seems excessively complicated, but I cannot
        think of a simpler one yet: Let's write the configuration in the form
        [corners][edges], where the pieces are taken in order clockwise around
        the U face. The solved state is [0123][0123], and G can be taken to have
        the action G([0123][0123])=[2013][1203]. Of course, U has the action
        U([0123][0123])=[3012][3012]. We need to investigate the kinds of
        positions that can be generated by repeated application of U and G.
        Obviously there are too many to investigate by hand, so instead consider
        a reduced representation in which we do not distinguish a piece from its
        opposite number: 0 &amp; 2 are both represented by 0, and 1 &amp; 3 are
        represented by 1. Now consider the action of G and U on A = [0011] B =
        [0101] C = [0110] D = [1001] E = [1010] F = [1100]. We have
        U{A,B,C,D,E,F} = {D,E,A,F,B,C} for both corners and edges, but
        G{A,B,C,D,E,F} = {D,A,E,B,F,C} for corners while G{A,B,C,D,E,F} =
        {B,D,F,A,C,E} for edges. In the reduced representation, several
        [corner][edge] configurations will be represented by the same ordered
        pair of symbols XY. For example, the solved state is one of the states
        represented by BB. By applying U and G repeatedly to BB, you can easily
        show that the only reduced configurations that can be reached are
        {BB,EE,BE,EB,AD,FC,DF,CA,DA,CF,FD,AC}. (You can check in a couple of
        minutes that this set is invariant under U and G -- assuming that I
        haven't made a silly mistake.) Note in particular that this shows that a
        3-cycle on one kind of piece is impossible, since this would require B
        (the reduced form of the solved state for one kind of piece) to be
        paired with a reduced configuration other than B or E. Hope the idea is
        clear enough, but there really ought to be a simpler way of seeing it.

        on the table - Both hands must start flat on the table or timing device
        - You may use a Stackmat timer, or any other timing device where both
        hands must be placed flat on the table to stop the timer.

        possible (I need more than 1s just to start/stop a stackmat timer!). Do
        people really have their fingers flat on the pads before? Do they
        clearly drop the Magic before stopping? Gilles.

        rules are: &gt; &gt; - You must time yourself in the fashion of an
        official Rubik's Magic &gt; event at an official contest &gt; - The
        Magic must start flat on the table &gt; - Both hands must start flat on
        the table or timing device &gt; - You may use a Stackmat timer, or any
        other timing device where both &gt; hands must be placed flat on the
        table to stop the timer. &gt; &gt; ---------------- &gt; &gt; Tell me, I
        want to understand how such a thing is possible (I need &gt; more than
        1s just to start/stop a stackmat timer!). &gt; Do people really have
        their fingers flat on the pads before? Do they &gt; clearly drop the
        Magic before stopping? &gt; &gt; Gilles.

        This is great to hear! I know it's so exciting when you think there's no
        chance you can go, and then things turn your way! :) For World 2003 I
        thought there was no chance I was going to make it since I was in
        Canberra, Australia and Worlds were in Toronto, Canada
        (15815kms/9828miles away!), but then through a series of events and
        changed travel plans it looked like I was going to be in Washington DC
        anyway around the same time as Worlds. An extra trip from DC to Toronto
        was pretty negligible once I'd already flown from Canberra! I was sooooo
        excited! Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com --- In

        argument then boils down to the following. Let's mark pairs of LL pieces
        that have opposite colours (i.e. such pieces belong opposite each other
        in the last layer when it is solved). The starting position it this: abc
        d d cba Note that I'm using the letters only as labels for identifying
        which pieces form a pair, not for identifying a particular pair. In
        other words, the following labelling means just the same: adc b b cda
        When applying the G perm and U turns to this, there are only two other
        possibilities of where the pairs can be: aba d b cdc abc b d adc It is
        easily checked that no other patterns are generated when you apply G or
        U to these 3 patterns. In particular, the mirror images of the last two
        patterns is not possible, nor can corners be opposite pairs and edges
        adjacent pairs (nor vice versa). Jaap

        Yeah, I'm old, and I have a job, so I can register on my own and buy my

        on this group, but not actually old. ;) BTW, you don't need to have mega
        fast times to compete. I was averaging over a minute leading up to
        Worlds. I got my first sub-1min average only about a week before Worlds
        and my best time at the competition was only 54 seconds. I knew my times
        were waaay too slow to be really competitive so I was just aiming to do
        times that were good times for me. For me, Worlds 2003 was primarily
        about meeting cubers from all around the world, and also getting some
        competition experience. My current average is about 35 seconds, which is
        still not internationally competitive, so my aim is just to beat my
        previous competition times. :) Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com

        to compete. I was &gt; averaging over a minute leading up to Worlds. I
        got my first sub-1min &gt; average only about a week before Worlds and
        my best time at the &gt; competition was only 54 seconds. I knew my
        times were waaay too slow &gt; to be really competitive so I was just
        aiming to do times that were &gt; good times for me. &gt; &gt; For me,
        Worlds 2003 was primarily about meeting cubers from all around &gt; the
        world, and also getting some competition experience. My current &gt;
        average is about 35 seconds, which is still not internationally &gt;
        competitive, so my aim is just to beat my previous competition times. :)

        &gt; &gt; Yah, I agree with everything you said...except that I have a
        job, not &gt; a great one, but it is a job...and I could pay for
        everything, but it &gt; would be a hefty chunk of money for me...and my
        parents are worried &gt; that I won't do anything except cube for the
        next two months... &gt; &gt; Craig &gt; &gt; --- In

        were &gt; &gt; good times for me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For me, Worlds
        2003 was primarily about meeting cubers from all around &gt; &gt; the
        world, and also getting some competition experience. My current &gt;
        &gt; average is about 35 seconds, which is still not internationally

        The point still being, what this guy claims to do is no trivial task. I

        using a 55113 &gt; juggle pattern (in siteswap notation), because then
        you have 2 beats &gt; in which to do a cube turn. Or even a 7711113

        across without it &gt; rotating in space. &gt; &gt; If I could juggle
        that pattern well enough to do this, I would still &gt; use a prepared
        scramble, and just memorize the colours of the faces &gt; that need to
        be turned. Probably just a repeated cycle of 6 colours. &gt; &gt; Jaap

        need an alg that changes this parity, both for edges and corners. But
        exactly this requirement makes a 3-cycle impossible. Right? Stefan

        PLL swaps UBR and URF: 12 03 the even-"parity", solved state becomes 13
        02 which has odd "parity". Now apply U to get 01 23 which still has odd
        "parity". Now apply the PLL again to get 03 21. The "parity" is still
        odd, so there has been no parity change this time. Mike

        work is that it would also prove that e.g. the PLL, its mirror and U
        together would also not be enough to create a 3-cycle... But there must
        be a fix, there must be a really short proof... Sigh... Stefan

        Hey everyone, I'm going to write a report on Dallas, and actually also
        on the Horace Mann tourny (though I'm almost done with that one) pretty
        soon, but I wanted to post about ZB. I did 6 ZB solves in Dallas, 4 of
        the first round solves (I got amnesia on the ZBF2L on one of the solves
        and used Fridrich), and the last two solves of the final round. Of those
        6 solves I got 2 ZBLL solves, 15.91 which was a PLL skip after COLL and
        17.52 which was the ZBLL case F' R' U' F2 U F2 R U' F' U' F2 U F2 U2
        which I do as y x (L' U') x' (U' L2) (U) ((L)2 F) (U') [L' U' (L)2 (U)
        (L')2] U2 I was definitely very nervous trying to recognize the ZBF2L
        case while being timed and if you watch my video of the 17.52 solve I
        have a very long delay in trying to recognize the ZBLL case. I knew by
        the COLL case that I knew the ZBLL one, but it took me a few seconds to
        fully recognize it. I still feel excited about ZB for competitions,
        though I agree with pretty much everyone who has posted that I think ZB
        will take a lot of work. My motivation comes from the fact that ZBF2L,
        though harder than F2L is still manageable in competition. Also, even
        with a slow recognition of one of my better practiced ZBLL cases I can
        still get 17.xx seconds. I don't expect to see any real results from ZB
        in competition for a long time, but after trying it in Dallas I
        definitely think it is a viable method for competitions, and this only
        motivated me even more to learn it. I hope people aren't sick of hearing
        about ZB, but I felt extremely excited to use it for the first time in
        competition and I wanted to post about it. Chris

        Hi! Yes it's a nice feeling when it's really new. But i guess u won't
        like it that much once u get faster;-) U will notice better that it's
        locking too much. And don't try to take it apart like u do with a normal
        3x3x3, popping an edge. That will get u into trouble reassembling it
        again ;-) U can take off the centercaps of a face to get access to a
        screw which will let u disassble it properly if u fancy. But i recommend
        never do that. The cube will get very loose after u do :-( Have fun!

        Hi Chris, First of all, congratulations on your results! There's
        something I'd like to ask about "ZB" (I already asked but I think the
        post didn't appear?!). I don't know if this technique is interesting for
        super-humans, but it is not for normal humans like me because of an
        important point that is rarely discussed: Case recognition time. For
        three years, I've been practicing CLL recognition, and I think I became
        rather good at it. In my opinion, being fast means: 1) Being able to
        recognize the case from the best angle immediately. But that's not
        enough. 2) Being able to recognize it from different point of views.
        Full identification or partial when this point of view (3 sides) is not
        enough. 3) Being able to anticipate as much as possible, *before the end
        of the previous step* (simple example: If you finish the F2L stage with
        an R turn, start analyzing the ULx corners before). (Tip: Practice Lars
        Petrus' fifth step if you want to master relative positioning of
        corners) 4) At any stage of the recognition process, ready your fingers.
        If there are 3 hypothesis left, your fingers must be ready for any of
        them, waiting for the last pieces of information. 5) In order to do 4)
        efficiently, the sequences must be carefully selected. It's useless to
        optimize a sequence for pure speed only if you need to adjust U or, more
        seriously, if you need to change your grip at the last moment because
        you are hesitating between 2 cases and the 2 solving sequences start
        with very different moves and grip. CLL == - 43 different cases - 24
        unique sequences --&gt; Years of optimizations and practice. Now for the
        question you can guess ;-) What's your estimation of the recognition
        time for "CLL + LL-edges position", or more precisely, the delay between
        the last F2L turn and the first move of the LL sequence? Gilles. --- In

        Dallas, and actually also on the Horace &gt; Mann tourny (though I'm
        almost done with that one) pretty soon, but I &gt; wanted to post about
        ZB. &gt; &gt; I did 6 ZB solves in Dallas, 4 of the first round solves
        (I got &gt; amnesia on the ZBF2L on one of the solves and used
        Fridrich), and the &gt; last two solves of the final round. &gt; &gt; Of
        those 6 solves I got 2 ZBLL solves, 15.91 which was a PLL skip &gt;
        after COLL and 17.52 which was the ZBLL case F' R' U' F2 U F2 R U' F'
        &gt; U' F2 U F2 U2 which I do as y x (L' U') x' (U' L2) (U) ((L)2 F)
        (U') &gt; [L' U' (L)2 (U) (L')2] U2 &gt; &gt; I was definitely very
        nervous trying to recognize the ZBF2L case while &gt; being timed and if
        you watch my video of the 17.52 solve I have a very &gt; long delay in
        trying to recognize the ZBLL case. I knew by the COLL &gt; case that I
        knew the ZBLL one, but it took me a few seconds to fully &gt; recognize
        it. &gt; &gt; I still feel excited about ZB for competitions, though I
        agree with &gt; pretty much everyone who has posted that I think ZB will
        take a lot of &gt; work. My motivation comes from the fact that ZBF2L,
        though harder &gt; than F2L is still manageable in competition. Also,
        even with a slow &gt; recognition of one of my better practiced ZBLL
        cases I can still get &gt; 17.xx seconds. &gt; &gt; I don't expect to
        see any real results from ZB in competition for a &gt; long time, but
        after trying it in Dallas I definitely think it is a &gt; viable method
        for competitions, and this only motivated me even more &gt; to learn it.
        &gt; &gt; I hope people aren't sick of hearing about ZB, but I felt
        extremely &gt; excited to use it for the first time in competition and I
        wanted to &gt; post about it. &gt; &gt; Chris

        Thanks all! &gt; Daniel The simplest way might be: Get a new Megaminx
        from mefferts.com ;-) No, seriously! I think they used much more glue a
        while ago and nowadays the caps come off easily. Also, they now have
        good long screws with large heads (and maybe only thread on the ends but
        I'm not sure). And they do have tiles which make them totally beautiful
        :-) Other than that, I'd suggest to use a thin rectangular blade like
        this: http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/images/Center_Remove.JPG Stick it
        under the cap from all five directions, I think you can go about 2mm
        deep without causing damage (other than cracking glue, which is what you
        want). Cheers! Stefan

        Would your recommend the same technique for getting the tiles off a
        Rubik's Game cube? I managed to get the centers caps off the adjust the

        glue a while ago and &gt; nowadays the caps come off easily. Also, they
        now have good long &gt; screws with large heads (and maybe only thread
        on the ends but I'm not &gt; sure). And they do have tiles which make
        them totally beautiful :-) &gt; &gt; Other than that, I'd suggest to use
        a thin rectangular blade like &gt; this: &gt;
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/images/Center_Remove.JPG &gt; Stick it
        under the cap from all five directions, I think you can go &gt; about
        2mm deep without causing damage (other than cracking glue, which &gt; is
        what you want). &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Thanks for the tips guys. I have two different megaminxes (megaminxi?)
        that I am working on. One is the stickered 6 color style (though the
        stickers have since been replaced) and the other is from the new run of
        12 color tiled minxes, both from mefferts. After trying every prying
        device known to man to get these center caps off, I went with drastic
        measures. I drilled a very small (1/16 inch) hole at the seem between
        the cap and the base and stuck a tiny nail in there. Then grabbed that
        nail with some pliers and pried them off. I got all but one to come up
        this way (and in fact, the one that won't come off bent the nail at a
        right angle!) I did that on my test megaminx to try it out before
        touching me speed minx, and I think it's going to work. However, the
        tile scheme is not to my liking on the tiled minx, so if anyone can dig
        up those tile removal tips, let me know! Thanks guys! Daniel (BTW, I
        need to swap 5 faces on the minx, I can post a picture of how if anyone
        would like to attempt to find the minimum number of tiles to pry off!)

        this, too? The new 12 color tiled one you have should have only very
        little glue and the caps should really come off easily just using a
        thing blade/knife. &gt; However, the tile scheme is not to my liking on
        the tiled minx, so if &gt; anyone can dig up those tile removal tips,
        let me know! My tip: Get used to the new color scheme and buy at least
        four of them so you're safe for the near future (that's what I did ;-).
        Or you can get just the tiles from mefferts.com and put them on a
        stickered Megaminx the way you like it. Cheers! Stefan

        &gt; OUCH!!! That hurt reading it, man :-) &gt; &gt; So which one did
        you do this, too? The new 12 color tiled one you have &gt; should have
        only very little glue and the caps should really come off &gt; easily
        just using a thing blade/knife. This was actually the new 12 color tiled
        minx. Only one cap came off when I tried to pry them. Having them off
        now, I can tell maybe 2 others that could have come off had I tried a
        bit harder, but there is so much residual glue on the others I'm
        surprised they ever came off! &gt; &gt; However, the tile scheme is not
        to my liking on the tiled minx, so &gt; if &gt; &gt; anyone can dig up
        those tile removal tips, let me know! &gt; &gt; My tip: Get used to the
        new color scheme and buy at least four of them &gt; so you're safe for
        the near future (that's what I did ;-). Or you can &gt; get just the
        tiles from mefferts.com and put them on a stickered &gt; Megaminx the
        way you like it. &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan You're probably right on this
        one :D ... Old habits though! I might just do the tile set from
        mefferts, I'd only have to learn two new colors this way (my gray and
        black would both become a shade of blue... I mean really, 3 shades of
        blue on one puzzle!?!). Those tiles do seem to be REALLY well stuck
        down. Also, does anyone know where I might score some shorter springs?
        Or at least less taught ones? I was thinking of checking out ACE or
        something like that, but I don't know if they carry too many kinds of
        springs. Thanks again! Daniel

        Well, I sent an e-mail to the organizers of WC2005, andthey told me that
        the Eastsheen cubes are not allowed at the competition because "They
        cannot be legally seen to endorse them." But whatever, guess no 2x2x2
        world records will be set at the Worlds if we have to use the Rubiks
        2x2x2... Craig

        if you need to see the e-mail he sent me I'll post it right here,
        although I believe the person who sent me the e-mail is part of the
        group, cuz he mentioned the gala thing...which I thought odd... Here it
        is: Dear Craig Eastsheen Cubes are not allowed, we do appreciate that a
        lot of speedcubers prefer their 2x2 and 4x4 but we cannot legally be
        seen to endorse them. I have copied this reply to our webmaster
        regarding your registration question. Looking forward to meeting you in
        November. Best wishes Dear Responder, Thank you very much for a fast
        reply, but I believe that only the 2x2x2 is better. The two world
        champions, Frank Morris and Chris Hardwick, both use Rubik's 4x4x4s and
        5x5x5s, it is just the 2x2x2 that is smoother. I got the answer to the
        registration question from the World Championships FAQ page. How do you
        tell if a cube is a rubik's or not? Because I have been trying to find
        the serial numbers on my cubes, but cannot tell. I know they all are
        because I bought them either at a store in the Rubik's packaging, or off
        of your website, but I do not know how you would tell the difference.
        Craig Hi Craig Size and quality and if in doubt the internal mechanism
        (so I'm told !) Dear Responder, I ordered 2 Eastsheens yesterday, and I
        am not sure when they will get here, but I am pretty sure they are the
        same size (5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm) but I should double check. As for
        quality, how can you tell??? Someone may have lubed up a Rubik's 2x2x2
        and made it seem like an Eastsheen, and the internal parts, how can they
        be different??? Whatever. I am not trying to argue with you, just trying
        to support speedcubers worldwide. Craig Hi Craig Yes it would be good if
        you can check. The point really is that people have to be taken on trust
        and everyone should be using the same cube. There is also the good point
        that the costs of these events (or Gala's!) is enormous so the Rubik's
        guys that pay for it (me) don't think we should support companies like
        East Sheen who trade off our efforts. Maybe you guys can make something
        of that...I don't know. I kinda figured he meant that, like Gilles said,
        they can't support another company...P.S. - Gilles, nice analogy...with
        the Beer...lol... Craig --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi, In order to clarify the situation, I wrote an email to Rubik's to
        know if we can compete with non-Rubik's stickers. Here is a copy of the
        e-mail : ----------------------------------------- Hello, My name is
        Gilles and I'm going to take part to the World Championship in November.
        I have a question about the regulations regarding the cubes. I'm aware
        that only Rubik's cubes will be allowed at the competition. But does
        that also include the stickers ? I'm afraid the Rubik's Stickers quality
        is not very good, and I had to change my stickers in order to cube in
        good conditions. I'd like to know if I'll be allowed to compete at the
        WC with Rubik's cubes but with other stickers (which do not show any
        brand, just plain stickers). I hope you anderstand my concerns and can
        give me a quick answer. Thank you, Kind regards, Gilles.
        ---------------------------------------- I'll forward the answer to you
        all so that everybody knows :-) (I hope I didn't shoked them when I told
        them their stickers quality was not very good :P)

        really good accuracy. If that was me, I would be hitting my cube on the
        computer a few times each average. I agree, the big mats are a lot of
        wasted space, but I would really need the mini mat to be about 4 inches
        bigger. I just have my mat sprawled across my whole computer desk, so my
        mouse works anywhere I need it to work. So when the first picture loaded
        I saw your monitor and I thought to myself, that is a really sharp
        looking desktop image. He must have a really good monitor and graphics
        card. Then I though, no! He must have a really good camera to capture
        the quality so vividly. Then I thought, no! I must have a good monitor
        and graphics card in order to see vividness. Then I thought, no! All
        three items must have come together in order for all of this to happen!
        Needless to say, I stopped thinking after that. -Dave

        50.14 ! One of them was on the sunday contest. I thought it was very

        http://www.gabbasoft.com and head to the downloads section (excuse the
        mess, the site is being re-designed). The demo app only supports
        cube-shaped puzzles but we are implementing other shapes and puzzle
        styles into the finished product. We would appreciate your feedback on
        the product. The demo is for PC only and requires DirectX9.0b or greater
        to run. Regards, Jamey Pittman President GabbaSoft, Inc. jpittman@...

        &gt; Greetings cube fans, &gt; &gt; We are working on some 3D puzzle
        software that should be of interest &gt; to this group in particular.
        Please drop over to &gt; http://www.gabbasoft.com and head to the
        downloads section (excuse &gt; the mess, the site is being re-designed).
        The demo app only supports &gt; cube-shaped puzzles but we are
        implementing other shapes and puzzle &gt; styles into the finished
        product. We would appreciate your feedback &gt; on the product. The demo
        is for PC only and requires DirectX9.0b or &gt; greater to run. What's
        this ? A 6 Mbytes Trojan ? :-) -- FD

        I'm actually thinking about that. It still needs some more polishing, a
        few obvious bugs need to be taken care of and an installation manual
        need to be done. It's gonna require a server with PHP and Mysql though.
        :/ I'll release it here as soon as it gets to a state where I think it's

        If anyone else is interested, I have uploaded the timer to the

        Hi :D They earn money from selling bad stickers. They know the vinyl is
        not good. It cracks easily and the glue is rather ridiculous. After some
        use the stickers feel like floating on the cubies :-P And also the
        corners are not rounded well so that also helps wearing them down really
        fast. A plus however is that the colors are not that bad at all ;-)

        Lube) and was wondering if you could check out the pictures of it and
        tell me if you think it would be ok to use on my cubes.

        stickers. &gt; &gt;&gt; Here is a copy of the e-mail : &gt; &gt;&gt;
        ----------------------------------------- &gt; &gt;&gt; Hello, &gt;
        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; My name is Gilles and I'm going to take part to
        the World Championship &gt; &gt;&gt; in November. &gt; &gt;&gt; I have a
        question about the regulations regarding the cubes. I'm &gt; &gt;&gt;
        aware that only Rubik's cubes will be allowed at the competition. But
        &gt; &gt;&gt; does that also include the stickers ? &gt; &gt;&gt; I'm
        afraid the Rubik's Stickers quality is not very good, and I had to &gt;
        &gt;&gt; change my stickers in order to cube in good conditions. &gt;
        &gt;&gt; I'd like to know if I'll be allowed to compete at the WC with
        Rubik's &gt; &gt;&gt; cubes but with other stickers (which do not show
        any brand, just plain &gt; &gt;&gt; stickers). &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; I hope you anderstand my concerns and can give me a quick

        C'mon people what's with the paranoia? I just downloaded it, scanned it
        for viruses and malware using Norton, and then ran it. Then it didn't

        No that's three.. :( The user interface/usability could use some work
        though (this is for you programmers at gabba): 1. Enable keyboard usage
        2. Make very clear visible help. I was fiddling for 5 minutes before I
        found out I could rotate the cube by dragging with the right mouse
        button down (which is quite awkward, but functional). Think of a future
        mac version people, they don't have a right mouse button. Most applets
        just use the left button on the outside of the cube for this. That's
        very natural. 3. Why not zoom even further. Look at how Werner
        Randelshofer really takes that to the max (www.randelshofer.de). You are
        obviously using OpenGL, so why the heck not? 4. Enable a few of our
        favourite things: scramble/alg edit, save session times, look at NetCube
        e.g. from strangepuzzle.com, or my very own RubikTimer at
        http://tinyurl.com/926l4 5. How about (going wild) saving the solve as a
        movie (AVI/SWF or whatever). Then you would finally have created
        something none of the applets has. 6. Oh, and make it possible to
        disable the animated background. I get dizzy looking at it. Michiel ---

        I saw this question by someone, don't remember it. Here's the answer: Go
        to http://www.putfile.com That's really easy, and totally free, provided
        you don't use disturbing language, like e.g. "I ain't cheating, you
        punks" at the end of your movie. Just make sure your video is below
        10MB. And that's also really easy. If you have Windows XP home you will
        find Windows Movie Maker on your system, which has the 'save movie
        wizard'. Then you can just select a size/quality, and bingo! Apple users
        should have it somewhere integrated into every program. Linux Users know
        Everything, so I won't give them any advice. Michiel

        I definately agree on the help front, took me a while to figure out how
        to efficiently see the other side of the cube. But since it's only an
        alpha release, my guess is that it's just not implemented yet. I
        DEFINATELY like the video idea. My tweak to it would be to have a twist
        recorder that plays back twists on a cube (twists saved in a file which
        can be shared) and then have an option to export the twists as a video.
        You'd lose the realtime aspect of the solve this way though... And
        lastly, who doesn't like to see a 9x9x9 with a cool spot pattern? ?

        saving the solve as a movie (AVI/SWF or &gt; whatever). Then you would

        Rubik's cubes will be allowed at the competition. But &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        does that also include the stickers ? &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I'm afraid the
        Rubik's Stickers quality is not very good, and I &gt; had to &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt;&gt; I'd like to know if I'll be allowed to compete at the WC

        Wow the magic is addicting! Before I went to Dallas, where Bob Burton
        and Doug Li showed me how to restring a magic, I broke one of my red
        magics so bad that a tile came out. Well tonight I completely
        disassembled that magic and put it back together. It was actually pretty
        cool! It was very time consuming, but in a way good since now I feel
        *very* comfortable replacing a string on a magic now. This actually was
        also practice for wanting to string a master magic from scratch. I
        actually disassembled two of my other magics as well to prepare for
        making a master magic, but I wanted to try a regular magic from scratch
        first. I also now realized that I don't know where to get the design for
        the master magic. I checked Jaap's page but he doesn't have printouts
        for the master magic design. The closest one I could find was the magic
        rings, but I would prefer to use the master magic sheets so I can solve
        in competitions. Does anyone know where I can get the graphics for a
        master magic to printout so I can build my own? Thanks, Chris

        The comments so far (onlist and e-mail) have been very productive - keep
        'em coming! The interface requests have been very informative in
        particular. Someone had mentioned enabling the keyboard. The question
        is: How does one enable keyboard input for a n-size cube. In other
        words, how should we implement keyboard controls that work on both a
        2x2x2 and a 9x9x9 cube? We will try to get a new release out in the next
        few days to address using the left mouse button to turn the cube. We
        will also include a readme.txt file in the next release that details the
        cube interface. For now, here are a few of the less-obvious controls: -
        The up/down arrows keys zoom the cube in/out (as does the mouse wheel. -
        You can produce a 180 degree twist of any face by holding down the left
        CTRL key down while turning the cube slice. - You can change the
        fullscreen resolution from the default of 1024x768 by editing the sys.rc
        file in the install directory with any text editor (notepad, for
        example) and changing the values on the "set mode 1024 768" line to any
        fullscreen mode supported by your video card (examples: "set mode 640
        480" or "set mode 1280 1024"). Thanks again for all the comments so far

        I loved the software. but the cube turning is a lil bit uncomfortable
        for me. I think i'll have to get used to it . And yes the music seems
        nice at first but it gets a lil monotonous later on. Ofcourse you could
        turn it off but it'll be nice to have many tunes and have them played

        Why not make it programmable so that one can grey out stickers not of
        interest and apply an algorithm to the setup. And also a way to export
        it for easy distribution on the web just like an applet or only as a
        screenshot. This way the program can be used educational not only for
        fun. Also, I would love to see other shapes as well, e.q. square1,
        pyraminx, megaminx etc. //Dennis On Fri, 19 Aug 2005 05:59 ,
        pyjamamitten &lt;jpittman2@...&gt; sent: &gt;The comments so far (onlist
        and e-mail) have been very productive - &gt;keep 'em coming! The
        interface requests have been very informative &gt;in particular. Someone
        had mentioned enabling the keyboard. The &gt;question is: How does one
        enable keyboard input for a n-size cube. &gt;In other words, how should
        we implement keyboard controls that work &gt;on both a 2x2x2 and a 9x9x9
        cube? We will try to get a new release &gt;out in the next few days to
        address using the left mouse button to &gt;turn the cube. We will also
        include a readme.txt file in the next &gt;release that details the cube
        interface. &gt; &gt;For now, here are a few of the less-obvious
        controls: &gt; &gt;- The up/down arrows keys zoom the cube in/out (as
        does the mouse &gt;wheel. &gt; &gt;- You can produce a 180 degree twist
        of any face by holding down the &gt;left CTRL key down while turning the
        cube slice. &gt; &gt;- You can change the fullscreen resolution from the
        default of &gt;1024x768 by editing the sys.rc file in the install

        Don't hesitate to lube A LOT. I bought once a cube from the 80s on ebay,

        Thanks for the kind words guys! I'm pretty sure that Grant and I have
        very very similar methods. I'm know we do the faces in the same general
        order, and we do the same OLLE, PLLE, OLLC, PLLC for the last layer.
        I'll have to try out his algorithms and see if there's any differences
        there (though at a glance it really only looks like the OLLE algs are
        different). Essentially the solutions look almost identical though. And
        I'll add a link to Grant's solution for sure! -Daniel --- In

        Cool, thanks everybody! I only have one more question though, I have the
        sheet printed out and the magic tiles and strings ready, but how do the
        tiles line up? The front side is obvious, but how do I place the back
        tiles in relation to the front tiles? The sheet makes it look like I
        flip the magic horizontally, so that the right end of the front side
        becomes the left end of the back side. Is that right? That's all I need

        That was an awesome solution guide. I've never gotten into the megaminx
        much, partly because I used to have a 6-color minx, and then with my new
        stickers the last layer always gave me problems. Your solution was very
        easy to follow, and the pictures were great. I just used it to solve
        mine (well, mostly just the last layer part). One thing that would help
        is having an index somewhere which lists all the moves you gave greek (I
        think greek) symbols for, and possibly having the index in a seperate
        file or something. I say this because it was only a very minor hassle to
        read the move, then go back and have to look for the different symbols
        to find the moves. Again, that was just a very tiny issue. Overall, I
        thought it was great, and maybe I'll start minxing more to put up some
        good times in Orlando. Thanks again. -Chris Parlette --- In

        &gt; I'm pretty sure that Grant and I have very very similar methods.
        I'm &gt; know we do the faces in the same general order, and we do the
        same &gt; OLLE, PLLE, OLLC, PLLC for the last layer. I'll have to try
        out his &gt; algorithms and see if there's any differences there (though
        at a &gt; glance it really only looks like the OLLE algs are different).
        &gt; Essentially the solutions look almost identical though. &gt; &gt;
        And I'll add a link to Grant's solution for sure! &gt; &gt; -Daniel &gt;

        &gt; Looks good, especially I like the pictures better than Grant's
        textual &gt; &gt; descriptions (though they're ok). And you've reminded
        me I might have &gt; &gt; to replace some of my LL algs with better
        ones... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are there real differences between your
        solution and Grant's? If so, &gt; &gt; maybe you could point them out so
        they're easier to see for someone &gt; &gt; knowing Grant's method

        came out. &gt; &gt; Well tonight I completely disassembled that magic
        and put it back &gt; together. It was actually pretty cool! It was very
        time consuming, &gt; but in a way good since now I feel *very*
        comfortable replacing a &gt; string on a magic now. &gt; &gt; This
        actually was also practice for wanting to string a master magic &gt;
        from scratch. I actually disassembled two of my other magics as well
        &gt; to prepare for making a master magic, but I wanted to try a regular
        &gt; magic from scratch first. &gt; &gt; I also now realized that I
        don't know where to get the design for the &gt; master magic. I checked
        Jaap's page but he doesn't have printouts for &gt; the master magic
        design. The closest one I could find was the magic &gt; rings, but I
        would prefer to use the master magic sheets so I can &gt; solve in
        competitions. &gt; &gt; Does anyone know where I can get the graphics
        for a master magic to &gt; printout so I can build my own? &gt; &gt;
        Thanks, &gt; Chris Hey Chris, Congrats on restringing your 2x4 magic. I
        just finished stringing my master magic, but it was a lot of work. I
        messed up quite a bit, but heres some tips that will save you time: The
        strings do NOT start at the top left corner of the tiles, they start at
        the bottom left corner. The loop that you will creat should work this
        way: Hold the MM with the linked rings facing you. Fold the top half
        onto the back of the bottom. This is important to get correct, or else
        the magic will be upside down, thus unsolvable. If you have anymore
        questions, feel free to email me: pjgat09@... Good luck!! Peter

        Hi Everyone, I was just thinking, right now, the Guinness Book of World
        Records recognizes 16.53 seconds as the fastest solve. If you've seen
        the Guinness Book's criteria for a Rubik's speed solve attempt, it's
        quite interesting. They require two cubes new from the package and a lot
        of other odd things. Anyway, if no one breaks 12.11 in Florida, well,
        they will have a difficult time ignoring the WCA. After all, you can't
        claim a 12.5x time is the world record when a 12.11 time was set on
        April 3, 2004. However, if someone does break 12.11, I foresee the
        slight issue. Guinness will recognize this record as the world record,
        which would undermine the authority of all of the other competitions
        taking place. It will propagate the standard that only records achieved
        in a world championship are valid. I'm most likely not going to be the
        one in contention to break 12.11 seconds, but there are some of you out
        there that just might do it. In the event that the single speed solve
        record is broken (and us speed cubers know that 12.11 isn't nearly as
        important as 14.52), my suggestion is to not accept the Guinness
        recognition of holding the world record. Accepting their recognition
        would undermine the authority of all the tournament work that has
        happened in the last two years. Until Guinness is ready to accept the
        WCA's records as the world records, we really shouldn't help them out.
        And anyway, what's important? Having a record in the book which no one
        of any authority or knowledge recognizes, or having a record that is
        respected by the community? Anyway, these are just my initial
        impressions. Obviously, the most likely candidate that would have to
        deal with something like this is Macky, but 12.11 can be broken by
        anyone. I really hope that this e-mail doesn't spark an outrage in the
        community, and I don't foresee a heated debate and many flames. If I'm
        out of line, please let me know, but I feel that Guinness' ignorance of
        12.11 seconds shows disrespect for the work that I have done these last
        two years and undermine the work that all competition organizers have
        put in and so I submit to you not to acknowledge the Guinness Book of
        Records. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology

        Hey! The Guiness requirements for setting speedcubing world records are
        just outrageous if u ask me. In which other sport or discipline do they
        require to use brand new equipment that has not been customised for the
        competitor. I would guess none. What if speeding with cars on a closed
        circuit should be done with a car straight from the factory, not tested
        or modified in any way whatsoever. Or shooting w guns that are not
        heavily prepared to fit the sportsman. No, this is really so stupid that
        i can't believe people with any sense at all has made it up. I also
        believe that WCA should contact Guiness and try to make them think
        logically about this, which they obviously haven't done until now. It's
        not a big deal for us speedcubers belonging to the community that the
        book of world records doesn't recognize all times recognized by the WCA.
        The ptoblem is that the rest of the people will seriously believe that
        faster than 16.53 hasn't been done in controlled environment. And that
        is really too stupid. Ok, cubing shouldn't be taken too seriously, but a
        time set in controlled environment by the sports recognized association
        should indeed be accepted by Guiness as well. Another serious
        implication of this is that the World Championships will moist likely
        always be sponsored by Seventowns. And we all know that they only
        acceopt their own branded cubes/puzzles where applicable. So they do
        allow of coz any kind of megaminx simply cause they don't produce thir
        own ones. But my point then is that Guiness in fact as a consequence
        only accept world records set with Rubiks.com branded products. Those
        who are fast with say Eastsheen 2x2x2/4x4x4/5x5x5 and solve faster than
        world record set with the mentioned branded products in competitions
        acknowledged by the WCA will automatically not be accepted. Adidas does
        indeed sponsor many events (not as sole sponsor of coz) but that doesn't
        mean tracking world records have to be set with Adidas shoes !!! Grrrrr
        ... Ok, that's enough emotions over this issue. I feel really sorry for
        those who won't have their achievements acknowledged, when it was truly
        deserved :-( -Per &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I was just thinking, right now, the Guinness Book of World Records &gt;
        &gt; recognizes 16.53 seconds as the fastest solve. If you've seen the
        &gt; &gt; Guinness Book's criteria for a Rubik's speed solve attempt,
        it's quite &gt; &gt; interesting. They require two cubes new from the
        package and a lot of &gt; &gt; other odd things. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Anyway, if no one breaks 12.11 in Florida, well, they will have a &gt;
        &gt; difficult time ignoring the WCA. After all, you can't claim a 12.5x
        &gt; &gt; time is the world record when a 12.11 time was set on April 3,
        2004. &gt; &gt; However, if someone does break 12.11, I foresee the
        slight issue. &gt; &gt; Guinness will recognize this record as the world
        record, which would &gt; &gt; undermine the authority of all of the
        other competitions taking place. &gt; &gt; It will propagate the
        standard that only records achieved in a world &gt; &gt; championship
        are valid. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm most likely not going to be the one
        in contention to break 12.11 &gt; &gt; seconds, but there are some of
        you out there that just might do it. In &gt; &gt; the event that the
        single speed solve record is broken (and us speed &gt; &gt; cubers know
        that 12.11 isn't nearly as important as 14.52), my &gt; &gt; suggestion
        is to not accept the Guinness recognition of holding the &gt; &gt; world
        record. Accepting their recognition would undermine the &gt; &gt;
        authority of all the tournament work that has happened in the last two
        &gt; &gt; years. Until Guinness is ready to accept the WCA's records as
        the &gt; &gt; world records, we really shouldn't help them out. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; And anyway, what's important? Having a record in the book
        which no one &gt; &gt; of any authority or knowledge recognizes, or
        having a record that is &gt; &gt; respected by the community? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Anyway, these are just my initial impressions. Obviously, the
        most &gt; &gt; likely candidate that would have to deal with something
        like this is &gt; &gt; Macky, but 12.11 can be broken by anyone. I
        really hope that this &gt; &gt; e-mail doesn't spark an outrage in the
        community, and I don't foresee a &gt; &gt; heated debate and many

        that Guinness' ignorance of 12.11 seconds shows disrespect &gt; &gt; for
        the work that I have done these last two years and undermine the &gt;
        &gt; work that all competition organizers have put in and so I submit to
        you &gt; &gt; not to acknowledge the Guinness Book of Records. &gt; &gt;

        Hey everyone, I just took an average for doing the magic harmonic. This
        is where you start with unlinked rings, solve to linked rings, then undo
        back to unlinked rings. So you start the timer and pick up the magic,
        solve then unsolve, then once the magic is solved again you stop the
        timer. I got the idea from cupstacking, since for the cycle you start
        and end in the same configuration. Anyway the times were: 3.77 3.34 3.28
        4.30 (3.11) (5.11) 3.20 4.35 3.50 3.54 4.13 4.42 = 3.78 Bob Burton and I
        were trying this out some too in Dallas. Anyway if you're a magic solver
        and haven't tried this it's pretty fun, give it a shot! I know sub-3
        will be possible with practice for a single time, though not sure of the
        limits for an average. Chris

        Cupstacking has the same problem, their official cycle record is 7.43 I
        think, but the Guinness record is only about 8.xx seconds. Emily holds

        think Guinness just isn't as interested in our "weird" or "off-beat"

        http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=505 Just a small
        addition: Between those first two pictures the puzzle was flipped
        left-right, i.e. not up-down. Of course for solving it doesn't matter.
        Btw, rubiks.com made a mistake, don't know whether they've fixed it now.
        The way it was you couldn't just print both sides on the same sheet.
        Just look at the twistypuzzles pictures how to arrange the tiles. Stefan

        I don't think this is really worth getting too worried about. Who really
        cares what's in Guinness anyway? We all know that speedcubing.com is the
        place to go for checking speedcubing records. I often cube on the train
        and people always ask me what the world record is, and of course I say
        12.11 seconds. If anyone did contradict me and say they read 16.53
        seconds in Guinness, they I'd tell them that the book is out of date and
        16.53 seconds has been broken many times in official competitions since
        Worlds 2003. BTW, http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/ also has a
        records section with cool filters so you can sort by puzzle, year and
        even by person to see all the official times set by particular solvers.
        Another cool thing which the WCA site has which speedcubing.com doesn't
        (but please correct me if I'm wrong) is a list of 3x3x3 official
        rankings combined across years - this is probably the list I'm most
        interested in because you can see where you rank relative to solves in
        all competitions across all years (including the 1982 championships!).
        BTW, it's actually not quite all years at the moment though because it
        hasn't yet been updated to include 2005 comps. Jasmine

        Bob you've also gotten me into one-handed magicing as well ;-) Here's my

        Could you give an option to keep just the clicking sound on and the
        music off. because i sometimes get bored by the music but i still like
        when the cube "clicks" when i turn it. Also one more thing. Could you
        keep a keyboard shortcut like the shift key or something for turning two
        layers at a time. I mean like when i prs shift and the right layer the
        rt layer plus the middle should turn simultaneously. This is more
        quicker than turning the left side in the opposite directn and then
        turning the whole cube again. Anyways the software is awesome! Sachin On

        Hi Jasmine :-) Yes i guess i was a bit wound up when i wrote my post.
        But the truth remains that many people do regard the Guiness book of
        world records as the De Facto reference for world records. And as such
        Guiness should have fair and reasonable regulations for accepting world
        records. Yes, we speedcubers know about all those useful resources on
        the net about cubing. I'm not worried about us. I'm worried about the
        99.9% of the rest of the ppl who will seriously believe that 16.53 is
        the best. And who knows, if they see better record somewehere they might
        think it's fake. I think it's actually a semi serious matter. Well,
        there are worse things happening in the world than this ;-) Cheers! -Per

        cool &gt; thing which the WCA site has which speedcubing.com doesn't
        (but please &gt; correct me if I'm wrong) is a list of 3x3x3 official

        interested in &gt; because you can see where you rank relative to solves
        in all &gt; competitions across all years (including the 1982

        moment though because it &gt; hasn't yet been updated to include 2005

        &gt; &gt; &gt; 12.11 is The Official World Record, it just isn't the

        Hi ! A _WILD_ guess (lol) is that all data presented is extracted from
        the same table in the database. So basically the number of moves is then
        treated like it was a time. Hence the 2 decimals in the listing on the
        webpage. Have fun! -Per PS! I haven't managed to use 23.9 or 23.97 moves

        I'm not sure &gt; why the fewest moves &gt; &gt; records need to be
        listed to 2 decimal places though! &gt; &gt; Maybe that's so I can end
        my solution with let's say "... R*0.8" &gt; because small misalignments
        are allowed and this way I could beat your &gt; 27 with my 26.8. But I
        could be wrong. &gt; &gt; Wait, actually why only save at the end? I
        could for example write &gt; "U*0.9 R*0.8" which works very well cause
        my cubes forgives some &gt; misalignments. Ok, now I'm sure that this is
        the reason. &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan

        WCA site has which speedcubing.com doesn't (but &gt;&gt; please
        &gt;&gt;&gt; correct me if I'm wrong) is a list of 3x3x3 official
        rankings &gt;&gt; combined &gt;&gt;&gt; across years - this is probably
        the list I'm most interested in &gt;&gt;&gt; because you can see where
        you rank relative to solves in all &gt;&gt;&gt; competitions across all
        years (including the 1982 championships!). &gt;&gt;&gt; BTW, it's
        actually not quite all years at the moment though &gt;&gt; because it
        &gt;&gt;&gt; hasn't yet been updated to include 2005 comps. &gt;&gt;&gt;

        Guinness Records &gt; &gt;I'm not worried about ourselves. Cubers are
        smart enough to know &gt;what's recognized by what and who has
        authority. However, think about &gt;the publicity during and after the
        WC 2005? Think about how many &gt;non-cubers will think, hmm... what's
        the world record? Where will they &gt;turn? Hey Tyson, Guinness is just
        nothing "professional", and I don't trust Guinness at all. This is not
        even official. Those are just people who try to make money by selling
        books. The only Guinness I would trust is beer, the rest is just "une
        grosse plaisanterie" as frenchies say. Would you trust Guinness for
        tracks and fields records ? You would be wrong. I just made a quick
        check on : http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com for WRs on 100m, 110m
        hurdles, and 5000m. They are ALL wrong : - WR on 100m has been beaten
        last june, this is not updated ; - 110m hurdle has been made again by a
        chinese during the last olympics in august 2004 : no mention about it,
        we still have Colin Powell only as the recordholder ; - the time for
        5000m is wrong again, despite the current record being 1 year and a half
        old. If I want to know the truth, I don't look into the guinness. I
        *drink* a Guinness, and click on http://www.athlerecords.net/ Actually,
        Guinness is full of mistakes, in many fields, some being rather funny
        like in mathematics. I would say that : - non-cubers who don't really
        care about cubing, *may* look in the Guinness and find the wrong rubik
        record... so what ? - non-cubers that may get interested into cubing
        will use Google and finally reach speedcubing.com. And they will just
        trust it and regard Guinness as b******t ; - cubers just look at SC.com
        and the site is just great. So I would just not bother with the Guinness
        book. This book is just not serious at all. In all sports, only the
        federations keep track of records. Guinness is to serious records what
        your local newspaper is to serious scientific publications. Just almost
        nothing. -- Francois. On Aug 20, 2005, at 11:32 AM, Jo√Ø¬ø¬Ωl van Noort

        &gt;&gt; I was just thinking, right now, the Guinness Book of World
        Records &gt;&gt; recognizes 16.53 seconds as the fastest solve. If
        you've seen the &gt;&gt; Guinness Book's criteria for a Rubik's speed
        solve attempt, it's &gt; quite &gt;&gt; interesting. They require two
        cubes new from the package and a &gt; lot of &gt;&gt; other odd things.
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway, if no one breaks 12.11 in Florida, well, they
        will have a &gt;&gt; difficult time ignoring the WCA. After all, you
        can't claim a &gt; 12.5x &gt;&gt; time is the world record when a 12.11
        time was set on April 3, &gt; 2004. &gt;&gt; However, if someone does
        break 12.11, I foresee the slight issue. &gt;&gt; Guinness will
        recognize this record as the world record, which &gt; would &gt;&gt;
        undermine the authority of all of the other competitions taking &gt;
        place. &gt;&gt; It will propagate the standard that only records
        achieved in a &gt; world &gt;&gt; championship are valid. &gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt; I'm most likely not going to be the one in contention to break
        &gt; 12.11 &gt;&gt; seconds, but there are some of you out there that
        just might do &gt; it. In &gt;&gt; the event that the single speed solve
        record is broken (and us &gt; speed &gt;&gt; cubers know that 12.11
        isn't nearly as important as 14.52), my &gt;&gt; suggestion is to not
        accept the Guinness recognition of holding &gt; the &gt;&gt; world
        record. Accepting their recognition would undermine the &gt;&gt;
        authority of all the tournament work that has happened in the last &gt;
        two &gt;&gt; years. Until Guinness is ready to accept the WCA's records
        as the &gt;&gt; world records, we really shouldn't help them out.
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; And anyway, what's important? Having a record in the
        book which &gt; no one &gt;&gt; of any authority or knowledge
        recognizes, or having a record that &gt; is &gt;&gt; respected by the
        community? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway, these are just my initial
        impressions. Obviously, the &gt; most &gt;&gt; likely candidate that
        would have to deal with something like this &gt; is &gt;&gt; Macky, but
        12.11 can be broken by anyone. I really hope that this &gt;&gt; e-mail
        doesn't spark an outrage in the community, and I don't &gt; foresee a
        &gt;&gt; heated debate and many flames. If I'm out of line, please let
        me &gt; know, &gt;&gt; but I feel that Guinness' ignorance of 12.11
        seconds shows &gt; disrespect &gt;&gt; for the work that I have done
        these last two years and undermine &gt; the &gt;&gt; work that all
        competition organizers have put in and so I submit &gt; to you &gt;&gt;
        not to acknowledge the Guinness Book of Records. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tyson

        I often cube on the train. Sometimes no one pays any attention, but
        sometimes they do. Tonight was definitely the later. A group of four
        girls sitting across from me let out audible gasps when I finished a
        solve. I like to take any opportunity to promote cubing, so if anyone
        shows any interest on the train (or anywhere!) I'll offer to do them
        another demo and ask them to do the scramble themselves (so they know it
        wasn't 'set up' and also to get them involved). I did a few more 3x3x3
        demos for them and they were very impressed. Then I whipped out the
        4x4x4 and got them to scramble that too. :) Later during the train trip,
        another group of people got on. They were pretty amazed ("Oh my
        goodness! Did you just solve that thing?!") and so I handed them my
        cube. I did several demos as various different people in train scrambled
        my cube. They timed one of the solves (32 seconds) and then I got an
        applause from half the train carriage. When the train was approaching
        the final stop, which was also my stop, there was one guy left from the
        group. He'd been further down the carriage and hadn't actually seen my
        solves, he'd just heard his friends talking ("Wow! She just solved that
        in 32 seconds!") So obviously I offered to do a demo for him. :) He was
        completely blown away and asked me what I did. He then asked me if I was
        looking for a job and gave me his contact details! BTW, I beat my PB
        single solve tonight too - 22.23 seconds. :) Jasmine

        I already have a very good job. We all know that anyone can learn to
        solve the cube if they have the patience and commitment, but it's cool
        that non-cubers assume that anyone who can solve the cube pretty quickly
        is obviously brilliant! I think we should use all use this to our

        Thanks for showing me the web page. I was just solving it with all

        have more fun playing with it:) Right now I would say if you are good at
        3-D seeing brainstring should be pretty easy. I'll try out the solutions
        on the page, where the strings touch each other and let you know, if

        Other thing I meant to say is that I definitely recommend cubing in
        public. It's valuable pre-competition preparation. I get nervous
        performing in competitions and my hands shake a bit and this has an
        adverse effect on my times. My best time at my last competition was 4-5
        seconds slower than my average at the time. :( I'm hoping that my public

        Five months ago I traveled to S√£o Paulo (I'm brazilian)and went to a
        wholesale store and, as we know, they sell only big quantities of one
        product. The problem was that I saw a very nice key chain cube and they
        wouldn't sell me one or two of it. They could only sell, imagine, at
        least 400 unities. I talked to the manager and told him how I would like
        to buy only one and that I use to solve the cube. You what? he said. I
        solve the cube, I answered. He scrambled one, hung it by the chain and
        challenging me said: As I never saw one solving this, if you do it it's
        yours. My wife started laughing and the cube is now mine. Good sunday to
        all.

        Hey everyone, I finished building my master magic last night, and wow
        this thing is cool! I took the tiles from a harry potter and a simpsons
        magic, printed out the sheets from rubiks.com and built one from scratch
        (thanks everyone for the help with orienting the tiles). My fastest time
        so far is 5.33 seconds :-D So I need more practice, but man this thing
        is cool! All told the cost of this magic was $10, the cost of the two
        magics I used, plus the time spent to string it. I hear that master
        magics cost $40 or so, so if you're like me and don't have $40 to spend,
        buy two magics and make one! Chris P.S. Hey Peter, did you also make one
        from scratch? Or were you stringing one you already had to make it move
        better? Let us know!

        Hey everyone, I finished building my master magic last night, and wow
        this thing is cool! I took the tiles from a harry potter and a simpsons
        magic, printed out the sheets from rubiks.com and built one from scratch
        (thanks everyone for the help with orienting the tiles). My fastest time
        so far is 5.33 seconds :-D So I need more practice, but man this thing
        is cool! All told the cost of this magic was $10, the cost of the two
        magics I used, plus the time spent to string it. I hear that master
        magics cost $40 or so, so if you're like me and don't have $40 to spend,
        buy two magics and make one! Chris P.S. Hey Peter, did you also make one
        from scratch? Or were you stringing one you already had to make it move
        better? Let us kno SPONSORED LINKS Puzzle games Free puzzle games Jigsaw

        I've got a master magic now, too. All of this talk about magic inspired
        me to pull my old master magic out of the box. I thought that it had
        broken about 7 years ago, and never knew how to fix it. After closer
        examination, I determined that some of the tiles had been twisted, but
        none of the strings were broken. I was able to reassemble it with the
        directions on Jaap's page. On 8/21/05, cmhardw

        I cube on the train all the time. Sometimes nobody cares just like you

        It has come to my attention that some of my recently sent out Tile sets
        did not have a white backing applied. If you received a set of my Tiles
        and they where not white on the back, under the liner where the adhesive
        is, then please contact me so I can send you a replacement set. I don't
        think that there are more that 20 sets that shipped like this, but I
        would rather replace them than have them being used like this. The
        colors on the tiles are not opaque by themselves and need that white
        coat in order to not seem transparent. Thanks, to Dan Harris

        addictive ;) Before i made my master magic from scratch too, but it took
        a long time cuz the only time i have ever played with on before was at
        HM. and even tht was for like 5 min. It took me several hours because i
        messed up quite a few times. First i had to figure out (by my self) how
        the tiles lined up. Then i started stringing, but i strung it the normal
        way, so of course it didnt work. After trying like 10 different ways to
        wire it, i just gave up. (it was like 5 am) The next day i re thought
        everything and finally put it together I agree, if you dont have $40 to
        spend, make one!! My PB is now 3.59, and its only like the 3-4 day ive
        had it!! (told you it was addictive) I hope to break 3 sec
        soon...(maybe) Good luck with your MM!! Hope you enjoy it! Peter

        This isn't about cubing, but it is about crazy obsessions, and there is
        a vague cube reference at the end. I'm currently watching a doco about
        the "sport" of competitive eating. It is hilarious. They were talking to
        the head PR guy from the Internation Federation of Competitive Eating
        (!) Yes, there really is an international association for competitive
        eating!! I googled and found it here: http://www.ifoce.com/ Anyway, the
        guy was saying that it really is a sport and they've been trying for
        ages to get it added as an Olympic sport!! He described the eaters as
        athletes. This is a much more crazy activity than speedcubing!! &lt;...
        a little while further into the show ...&gt; The PR guy just said that
        'hand speed' is one of the 3 important factors for a competitive
        eater?!?! Jasmine ttp://speedcuber.blogspot.com

        I tried that once but don't remember why it didn't work for me. I ended
        up with mencoder that comes with mplayer (Windows, Linux or Mac). It's

        Hi I have been hanging around this group for a few months, and this is
        my first posting I have been doing the cube for about 20 years now, and
        my best time is 72 secs, using only about five algs. Basicaly do First
        Layer, do Center Layer turn around allingn cross, orient cross, allign
        corners, orient corners. I went out, bought myself a new cube and some
        silicon spray and lubed my cube. Downloaded the Fridrich method and
        started learning, that was about a week ago. I have a question. How do
        you guys do it. Do you remember the sequencing i.e. R U R' d' etc or is
        it just part of your muscle memmory. I know from learning those five
        algs i currently do, that they form part of my muscle memmory, I cannot
        tell you what I do, but when I do them they just go. In order to build
        up the muscle memory, I need to repeat the alg. over and over again. In
        order to repeat the alg I think the best would be to do a certain case,
        then reverse the alg. and do again etc. etc. and in doing so, most
        propably know the reverse just as well as the forward alg? What would
        you guys suggest? Thanks Louis

        I often cube on the train. Sometimes no one pays any attention, but &gt;
        &gt; sometimes they do. Tonight was definitely the later. A group of
        four &gt; &gt; girls sitting across from me let out audible gasps when I
        finished a &gt; &gt; solve. I like to take any opportunity to promote
        cubing, so if anyone &gt; &gt; shows any interest on the train (or
        anywhere!) I'll offer to do them &gt; &gt; another demo and ask them to
        do the scramble themselves (so they know &gt; &gt; it wasn't 'set up'
        and also to get them involved). I did a few more &gt; &gt; 3x3x3 demos
        for them and they were very impressed. Then I whipped out &gt; &gt; the
        4x4x4 and got them to scramble that too. :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Later
        during the train trip, another group of people got on. They were &gt;
        &gt; pretty amazed ("Oh my goodness! Did you just solve that thing?!")
        and &gt; &gt; so I handed them my cube. I did several demos as various
        different &gt; &gt; people in train scrambled my cube. They timed one of
        the solves (32 &gt; &gt; seconds) and then I got an applause from half
        the train carriage. When &gt; &gt; the train was approaching the final
        stop, which was also my stop, &gt; &gt; there was one guy left from the
        group. He'd been further down the &gt; &gt; carriage and hadn't actually
        seen my solves, he'd just heard his &gt; &gt; friends talking ("Wow! She
        just solved that in 32 seconds!") So &gt; &gt; obviously I offered to do
        a demo for him. :) He was completely blown &gt; &gt; away and asked me
        what I did. He then asked me if I was looking for a &gt; &gt; job and
        gave me his contact details! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, I beat my PB
        single solve tonight too - 22.23 seconds. :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jasmine

        As far as F2L goes (Fridrich Method) my algs are less mechanical, and
        more intuitive. But for OLL and PLL it's all muscle memory - I have

        Hello goophy00! The way I remember the moves (algorithms) is by
        memorizing the moves but while doing that I see where the pieces go when
        I move them. Typically I find it easier to memorize when algorithms are
        given in triggers... for example: (R U' R' U) D (F R U). I just memorize
        the first part: RU'R'U as one move, then D as another and then FRU as
        one. Eventually after a while it will turn to muscle memory. But I don't
        keep repeating the algorithm. Try memorizing and soon you'll remember
        the feeling on your fingers. I hope this helps and good luck on the
        Fridrich method! --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        That's indeed muscle memory as you say. Even with the most simple ones I
        have trouble doing it slowly when teaching someone. When training any LL
        algs I start with a solved cube and execute it over and over again
        untill I have a solved cube again. This is very interesting (and pretty
        obvious if you think about it), some algs need to be executed only
        twice, others 8 times, if after any execution the F2L is messed up tou
        know you did something wrong ... It's part of the fun and it works with
        any LL alg. Cheers, Marco On 8/22/05, Bryan Mytko &lt;bmytko@...&gt;

        I think the problem is that behind the color, there is nothing.
        Therefore, when you put it on your cube, it is semi transparent (which
        looks awful since the cubies are black) Bryan Mytko bryanosaurus@... On

        Hi Louis, That's where I was around 12 months ago. I've been speedcubing
        for about a year now and I'm still learning OLL (I'm up to 23 at last
        count). I learnt PLL first though as there are fewer algs to learn. You
        might find that certain algs inverse others. I've found that it's easier
        to learn a new alg when there's only one case and it's mirror, eg. the
        "W" pattern OLL alg. But with other cases where there are more
        possibilities, eg.where two adjasent edges are to be oriented along with
        four corners (six all up which I'm still to learn), It's easier to learn
        two at a time then try a different case to save getting confused. For me
        personally it's easier to repeat a new alg as much as I can, I just need
        to remember that I've learnt the new alg for that case during a solve
        before doing the cross orientation that I would've automatically done
        before learning the new alg. Like someone else mentioned I too have
        trouble doing some algs slowly without messing them up. BTW, I recently
        did a new PB of 26.72 sec (WOO HOO!!), still average in the 40's though.

        Hello, i may be not the one in a position to give advice but i'll tell

        i try it on the cube and once that too is done i try to mentally imagine
        the whole algorithm and do it backwards. That i recommend to everyone
        because if u can do the alg backward by just imagining then you have

        It seems obvious to me that a just about everyone that's capable of
        speedcubing seems to be well educated and has done well with their
        schooling, especially with mathematics. Well, I'm completely the
        oppossite, I had trouble with learning difficulties at school and was
        put into a slow learners class. Obviously I can read and write well
        enough but I absolutly suck at maths, even basic stuff. I've done a bit
        of research into dyslexia and found that I possess a lot of the symptoms
        that describe the problems that dyslexics have. The most prominant one's
        being daydreaming and getting confused easily. I'm good with problem
        solving and being creative and I'm told I have a bit of a flair for
        writing. So you're probably reading this and thinking "but dylexics
        can't read or write" which is the common missconseption. What I really
        wanted to know is, are there any other speedcubers that have similar
        problems? Cheers, Keith.

        &gt; during a solve before doing the cross orientation that I would've
        &gt; &gt; automatically done before learning the new alg. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Like someone else mentioned I too have trouble doing some algs &gt;
        &gt; slowly without messing them up. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, I recently
        did a new PB of 26.72 sec (WOO HOO!!), still average &gt; &gt; in the
        40's though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers, Keith. &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; my first posting &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have been
        doing the cube for about 20 years now, and my best &gt; &gt; time is
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 72 secs, using only about five algs. Basicaly do First
        Layer, do &gt; &gt; &gt; Center Layer turn around allingn cross, orient
        cross, allign &gt; &gt; corners, &gt; &gt; &gt; orient corners. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I went out, bought myself a new cube and some
        silicon spray and &gt; &gt; lubed &gt; &gt; &gt; my cube. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Downloaded the Fridrich method and started learning, that was &gt; &gt;
        about a &gt; &gt; &gt; week ago. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a
        question. How do you guys do it. Do you remember the &gt; &gt; &gt;
        sequencing i.e. R U R' d' etc or is it just part of your muscle &gt;
        &gt; &gt; memmory. I know from learning those five algs i currently do,
        that &gt; &gt; &gt; they form part of my muscle memmory, I cannot tell
        you what I do, &gt; &gt; but &gt; &gt; &gt; when I do them they just go.
        In order to build up the muscle &gt; &gt; memory, I &gt; &gt; &gt; need
        to repeat the alg. over and over again. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In
        order to repeat the alg I think the best would be to do a &gt; &gt;
        certain &gt; &gt; &gt; case, then reverse the alg. and do again etc.
        etc. and in doing so, &gt; &gt; &gt; most propably know the reverse just
        as well as the forward alg? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What would you
        guys suggest? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks &gt; &gt; &gt; Louis

        So you can download the clips off of the website, but if you like what
        you see, you really should send Chris the ten happinesses because he put
        a lot of work into the DVD. The same also applies for Ian's DVD. It's
        not THAT much money and it's always nice to support other cubers. Tyson

        The moves are random, but the moves are restricted so that once a face
        is turned, it is not allowed to be turned again until an adjacent face
        is turned. Scrambling programs shouldn't create sequences like "U2 U'"
        or "U2 D U'". On 8/22/05, Sachin Shirwalkar &lt;sachinss@...&gt; wrote:

        Hi Gunnar! That can't possibly be right? Order 13? Every algorithm
        (sequence of moves) has a cyclic decomposition (corners and edges). U
        have to repeat an algorithm a number of times to yield the state u
        started from. This number is equal to the least common multiple of the
        orders of all the subcycles produced by this algorithm. Hence the
        overall order can't be a prime number (unless 2 or 3 or 5 or 7 or 11).
        The 7 and 11 could be corner cycles of those respective order. Im now
        talking general of coz, not necessarily restricted to LL. So i can't see
        how order 13 can be possible. Ok, i checked w FMC Companion now. Ur
        given algorithm has order 12. So probably just wrongly spelt from ur
        side ... ;-) Cheers, -Per &gt; --- In

        One problem I found with this method is too many slice moves. I Can't do
        fast slice moves for my life, but if you can do 'em it could be fast.
        Which commuter do you use for two edges left? For centers, r2b2r2b2,

        we can allow two turns at a time &gt; in the same plane! This is how it
        works: &gt; My description doesn't disallow sequences like "F B". My way
        of thinking it may be simpler or more complex depending on your point of
        view. The logic that you stated is one possible way of implementing my
        description. Here's another possible implementation. Keep track of the
        faces that can possibly be the next turn. Initially, all faces are in
        this set. Now repeat this 25 times: Pick a face randomly from the set to
        turn. Remove that face from the set. Place all of the faces that are
        adjacent to that face back in the set if they are not there already.
        Both implementations are equivalent. The method I desribed has the
        advantage that the rules for picking a face don't differ on the first,
        second and remaining steps. The method probably has other disadvantages,
        but that isn't my point. My point is that my description is perfectly
        correct (as far as I can tell).

        Hehe, I reinvented one of the algorithms... I mean the one to orient two
        adjacent corners (that you solve with the theta algorithm). I had seen
        yours and noticed it's shorter than mine but since I had the pc turned
        off I looked for a shorter one myself and found the same (well, somewhat
        mirrored, since I solve left-handed and your F is my U). And then today
        I got the same case for 3x3 cube OLL and used the new algorithm (cause I
        don't yet have a good alg for that) which resulted in a PLL skip. Proof
        enough that this alg is good, huh? Hey, try this 2-gen alg (for
        Megaminx, of course): R / F / R' / F / R / F'' / R'' / F'' / R / F / R'

        &gt; &gt; schooling, especially with mathematics. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Well, I'm completely the oppossite, I had trouble with
        learning &gt; &gt; &gt; difficulties at school and was put into a slow
        learners class. &gt; &gt; &gt; Obviously I can read and write well
        enough but I absolutly suck at &gt; &gt; &gt; maths, even basic stuff.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've done a bit of research into dyslexia
        and found that I possess &gt; &gt; a &gt; &gt; &gt; lot of the symptoms
        that describe the problems that dyslexics &gt; &gt; have. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        The most prominant one's being daydreaming and getting confused &gt;
        &gt; easily. &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm good with problem solving and being
        creative and I'm told I &gt; &gt; have a &gt; &gt; &gt; bit of a flair
        for writing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So you're probably reading
        this and thinking "but dylexics can't &gt; &gt; read &gt; &gt; &gt; or
        write" which is the common missconseption. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        What I really wanted to know is, are there any other speedcubers &gt;
        &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; have similar problems? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers, Keith. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        ADD and ADHD are forms of dyslexia in the way that the person
        experiences "disorientations" which is were some other symptoms kick in,
        like getting letters mixed up. One of my young nephews has been
        diagnosed with ADD and another (like myself) only began talking when he
        was 4 years old. Some people say that letters and words swim around or
        shimmer on the page. dyslexia.com is a very good source of information

        Thanks for all the good advice on starting speedcubing. On the topic of
        the Dyslexic cubers It will be interesting to know the average IQ of the
        group. Even if you are Dyslexic (Why is the word for people who can't
        spell such a difficult one to spell), or have ADD and do bad at math it
        doesnt mean that you have a low IQ. People with a High IQ have an
        affinity for problem solving, such as the rubicks cube. I am of the
        oppinion that the group average would be at least 125, where the general
        population average is 100. If you which to know your own IQ you could do
        an online test (Not very accurate) or go to your local MENSA and take a
        test for a fee. To find your local MENSA try Google. Louis

        All -- Long time cuber, first time poster. I'm looking to get faster,
        and thought I'd see what opinions this group has about the best approach
        to try next. First, my story. I first cubed back in high school in Texas
        (1980/1981) - I used a layer-by-layer method, turning with my whole
        hand, and got to the point where I could average about 1:10-1:15, which
        was decent back then and helped me do well in local competitions. This
        was back before the Internet, before anyone in my area knew of the
        Fridrich or finger tricks or any of that "new- fangled" cubing :-) Fast
        forward to November 2004, when I pick up a cube at Target. Looking for
        info on the web, I find the San Francisco competition in Jan 2005.
        Re-learned my old layer-by-layer method, went to SF and did alright
        (1:05-1:10). After being impressed by the incredible times at the
        competition, I wanted to get faster. My first step was to learn
        cross/F2L, which brought me to consistently to below a minute. Changing
        my LL approach from (permute corners, orient corners, permute edges,
        orient edges) to (orient edges, permute corners, orient corners, permute
        edges) took me to around 50-55 seconds. Lubing up the cube and a lot of
        practice took me to around a 50 second average, with a best of 47 second
        average (and occasional times below 41 seconds). Since I was still
        turning with my hands, with the cross on top, I realized it was probably
        time to start learning a better approach. I switched over to cross on
        bottom and started learning finger turning. That's where I was a couple
        months ago, and since then progress has been very slow. I'm just now
        getting back to 50 second averages, but not quite yet. I seem plagued by
        mistakes and brain stalls and the occasional jam or slip. At this point,
        I'm looking at various ideas on how to get faster, and I thought I'd run
        them by the group and see what thoughts people have. I'm also restricted
        by the fact that I've got a pretty busy life: work, family, kids, etc,
        so I don't have a lot of time to devote to cubing. So, I'm looking for
        the best "bang for the buck", in terms of effort - both short term (in
        prep for the Norcal tournament in a month) and longer term. Here's my
        ideas: - learn OLL/PLL. This seems like a lot of work, and while it
        would make me faster (due to cutting moves down to around 60 from my
        current 80) I'm not sure I can get through OLL/PLL in any time.
        Eventually, long term, I'll have to do this. - learn just PLL. I could
        switch my LL approach to (orient sides, orient corners, PLL). The PLL
        would be easier to learn (21? algs), but I'm not too sure about what the
        benefit would be (maybe cut out 10 moves?). - better cube. Not as sure
        about this one - my cubes seem pretty good (esp the 25th anniv ones), I
        could make them a little slicker but I'm not sure I could easily control
        them. I might get more jams and slips (this has happened in the past). -
        faster moves. I could work on making my sequences faster. I'm unsure
        about this one, since total time is (find sequence + perform sequence),
        faster sequences could help but there's still the "search" time. -
        practice "lookahead". I could work on being better about recognizing the
        next sequence, especially during F2L. This follows with the "F2L is
        everything" philosophy discussed in group. - practice technique. Work on
        being clean with my movements, with the hope of reducing jams and
        keeping movements clean. - slow down. Following with the "go slower to
        go faster" philosophy, I could slow down on sequences with the hope of
        finding the next sequence faster. This is an analog to the 'practice
        lookahead' above. So, what do you folks think? I've got some ideas, but
        I'd like to hear other's opinions as well - what could I tackle, both
        short-term (in the next month) and long term in order to get faster??
        Thanks for the help! yeff

        I was using the slice algs for edge 3-cycles since way before learning
        Fridrich, when I used to end with ELL (not necessarily 1 step, though).
        I just learned I guess 12 2-gen algs for edge 3-cycles today and I think
        I have gotten all of them faster than the slice ones I was using. I
        can't believe I wasn't using these sooner! What a difference it will

        &gt; On the topic of the Dyslexic cubers It will be interesting to know
        the &gt; average IQ of the group. Even if you are Dyslexic (Why is the
        word for &gt; people who can't spell such a difficult one to spell), or
        have ADD and &gt; do bad at math it doesnt mean that you have a low IQ.
        People with a &gt; High IQ have an affinity for problem solving, such as
        the rubicks &gt; cube. I am of the oppinion that the group average would
        be at least &gt; 125, where the general population average is 100. &gt;
        &gt; If you which to know your own IQ you could do an online test (Not

        I'm not even excited now - just fed up because it took me so long to do
        this! I beat my previous best of 10 average by 0.08 seconds to get
        29.96. Maybe now the barrier is down it won't be so hard the second
        time. Individual times: 28.39, 28.40, 26.62, 35.52, 28.38, 33.07, 27.46,
        23.44, 33.71, 34.56 (see the nerves kicking in at the end ;) )
        Incidentally I just bought a CD of Mike Oldfields Tubular bells for √Ø¬ø¬Ω1
        which I haven't listened to for about 25-30 years and did my average the
        first time I listened to it. Its going to be my favourite music for a
        while now :) Most of the solves were L2L1 method although the 23.44 was

        &lt;bbeer@...&gt;: &gt; Actually it is a normal distribution with a mean
        of 100 and a standard &gt; deviation of 15. This means that 90% of all
        people on earth score between 70 &gt; and 130 (mean + - 2x standard
        deviation). 2.5% of the world population has &gt; an IQ &lt; 70 and 2.5%
        has an IQ &gt; 130. &gt; If I count welll : 90 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 95 Where
        are the last 5% of the people ? They are aliens who can't take the test
        because it's too easy for them :D SPONSORED LINKS Computer

        It sounds like you have a good idea of what you need to do. The
        following tips are based on what people told me to do to get better: 1.
        Make sure you have a decent cube. It sounds like you do already. 2. Make
        sure you are doing the F2L properly. Rather than focusing on the clock
        for a while, focus on the number of turns that you are taking. You
        should be able to complete the first two layers in fewer than 35 turns
        consistently. 3. Learn the PLL. This will let you do a three step LL.
        I've heard that people can get to at least the low 20's with this
        method. And after you learn the PLL, you can start learning the OLL. 4.
        After you are comfortable with #2, practice solving the first two layers
        at a constant pace of one or two turns per second with no pauses. This
        excercise is useful for getting rid of pauses when you are going faster.

        seems like a lot of work, and while it would &gt; make me faster (due to
        cutting moves down to around 60 from my &gt; current 80) I'm not sure I
        can get through OLL/PLL in any time. &gt; Eventually, long term, I'll
        have to do this. &gt; &gt; - learn just PLL. I could switch my LL
        approach to (orient sides, &gt; orient corners, PLL). The PLL would be
        easier to learn (21? algs), &gt; but I'm not too sure about what the
        benefit would be (maybe cut out &gt; 10 moves?). &gt; &gt; - better
        cube. Not as sure about this one - my cubes seem pretty &gt; good (esp
        the 25th anniv ones), I could make them a little slicker &gt; but I'm
        not sure I could easily control them. I might get more jams &gt; and
        slips (this has happened in the past). &gt; &gt; - faster moves. I could
        work on making my sequences faster. I'm &gt; unsure about this one,
        since total time is (find sequence + perform &gt; sequence), faster
        sequences could help but there's still &gt; the "search" time. &gt; &gt;
        - practice "lookahead". I could work on being better about &gt;
        recognizing the next sequence, especially during F2L. This follows &gt;
        with the "F2L is everything" philosophy discussed in group. &gt; &gt; -
        practice technique. Work on being clean with my movements, with &gt; the
        hope of reducing jams and keeping movements clean. &gt; &gt; - slow
        down. Following with the "go slower to go faster" philosophy, &gt; I
        could slow down on sequences with the hope of finding the next &gt;
        sequence faster. This is an analog to the 'practice lookahead' above.
        &gt; &gt; So, what do you folks think? I've got some ideas, but I'd like
        to &gt; hear other's opinions as well - what could I tackle, both
        short-term &gt; (in the next month) and long term in order to get
        faster?? &gt; &gt; Thanks for the help! &gt; &gt; yeff &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hello, &gt; 3. Learn the PLL. This will let you do a three step LL. I've
        heard &gt; that people can get to at least the low 20's with this
        method. And &gt; after you learn the PLL, you can start learning the
        OLL. (my best average is 20.16 and I know 20/22 PLL and 32/57 OLL;-))
        so, F2L is really the main point to gain time at first, then try to
        accelerate your LL by switching from a 3-look to a 2-look method. Anoter
        important point is to train with some regularity (example : once a day),
        even if it's not for a long time. You could try to train in the public
        transportations because this will put you under stress (if people are
        looking at you), you'll have some disurbance (noise, unexpected
        shock,...) which is a good training for the competition. :-) Good luck

        the web address of where I got it, but if you search the group for that

        Jeff, I think looking ahead is the key. I just learned PLL since the
        last tournament, it only took a couple of weeks and I think it is
        totally worth it. If you can manage to come down to Oakland sometime,
        maybe I can get you rolling. I have kids too, maybe they could play and
        it would give you an excuse. Don't get discouraged, it seems like the

        At school last year, Joe Spadafora and I were in line for dinner. Joe
        was in the middle of doing a solve, and this kid in front of us turns
        around and says "If you can solve that in under 10 minutes I'll give you
        $5000." So Joe extended his hand and they shook on it. A few seconds
        later he finished his solve and the kid was pretty amazed. Unfortunately
        he didn't have $5000 cash on him to give so Joe didn't get it. It's
        funny though because to a non cuber, $5000 to solve in 10 minutes seems
        like a safe bet. Then there was another time that Joe and I were cubing
        in my dorm room. The guy that lived next to me had a bunch of people
        over and they were all REALLY wasted. He knocks on my door and asks us
        to cube for them in his room. We go over there, and they mix up our
        cubes, and then he says "the winner of this race gets a blowjob from his
        choice of girl in this room, and the loser gets kicked in the nuts by
        all of us." Of course, this was when Joe was still faster than me, so he
        won. :( Ahh... good times cubing with Joe.

        I had two rather inebriated patrons come into the gas station I was
        working at a while back. One of them saw the cube sitting on top of the
        register I was at and proceeded to tell me at length about how
        impossible they were. So, I nonchalantly picked it up and nodded
        politely as he was talking and solved it in about 25 seconds. He nearly
        wet himself. He excitedly explained to his friend that I had just solved
        it in slightly over 2 minutes. I was a tad miffed. I was no speed demon
        at the time, especially under no inspection circumstances, but two
        minutes hurt me deep. I corrected him, and he challenged me to a timed
        solve. I accepted, and solved in 24 seconds. I then performed two more
        sub 25 solves, which he witnessed and saw the stopwatch. I was feeling
        pretty good for no inspection. Then, the alcohol kicked in. He, after
        having seen me solve (with a timer) sub 25 three times, challenged me to
        solve it in under 30, to the tune of $3, which was all he had on him,
        sadly. I solved the cube in 21, dropped the stopwatch, picked it up and
        handed it to him, and he saw it at 24. I told him to keep his money,
        because it wasn't a fair bet. He mumbled in unintelligible drunk speak
        something about 'amazing' and 'circus', threw the money on the counter,
        and left, telling his disinterested friend about how I just blew his
        mind. I took the money, and those three dollars are still hiding in my
        dresser as a trophy. -Mike Bennett

        &gt; Non-cubers indeed assume that you are brilliant if you can solve
        the cube. Let's not tell them that anyone &gt; can learn it... :) Never
        had a job offer in the train though... just a funny encounter: Today in
        the bank was the second time I got the same reaction: "Are you a rocket
        scientist?". I simply replied: "no, but I am a computer scientist". Her:
        "Oh, thank God for you, now we have Dell computers. Now I still can't
        remember my password" Me: (no reply to that) --- Me moving into PLL just
        finishing up with last 3 moves "Can you actually solve that?" ---
        Solved. Me: "ehm yes, apparantly" Her: "Oh my God you solved it. How
        often have you solved it?" --- I really couldn't think of an answer that
        would be correct or something witty and I just didn't want to give her
        an approximation and have her fall off her chair or anything Me: I can
        just solve it Her: "How long does it take you" Me: "under 30 seconds"
        --- see I don't ever want people to be very disappointed. I once did a
        demo of 19 seconds, but that is not a very common time for me. Me:
        "actually most of us can solve it that fast, a lot of us even faster"
        Her: "You seriously mean there are more like you?" --- this was getting
        creapy. Are we some alien life form? Maybe to non-cubers it does seem
        like that anyway, still a nice conversation. I tend to get a lot more
        attention from the tourists then from the locals. I think people on
        vacation are not as worried with daily life and like the
        distraction/attraction. Michiel

        I had another 'cubing on the train' encounter yesterday. I was at the
        train station waiting for my train. As usual, I was cubing while
        waiting. A guy sat down about two seats away and after a few moments he
        said "Excuse me, did I see you in a magazine recently?" To which I
        replied "TNT Magazine? Yep, that was me." We proceeded to talk about
        cubing till the train arrived, and then as we were catching the same
        train we sat together and I explained my beginner method. He then asked
        me where he should go to buy cubes! :) Cubing moments like this on
        trains are cool. Sometimes people make really really lame comments
        though. The other day a guy said to me "Do you solve that often? Is that
        how you know how to do it?" What I was thinking, but didn't actually
        say, was "Yes, there are only 43+ quintillion configurations so I
        figured if I randomly work through them I'll eventually get there!"
        (Duh, obviously there's a system!) Then tonight I was out with some
        friends and, as usual, I had my cube out. When the waitress came by she
        commented on the cubes. My friends told her that I could solve it really
        quickly and so I offered to do a demo. I got her to scramble and then
        time me. After thousands and thousands of solves, I can generally make a
        pretty good estimate of the time of my solves and this one felt like low
        30s (my current avaerage). The waitress looked at her watch and said 3
        minutes!! I told her it definitely wasn't 3 mins and that it was much
        more like 30s and she didn't believe me. When she left, my friend said
        that he agreed she was definitely very wrong and you don't need to have
        a watch to know that the brief period of time that passed was no where
        near 3 minutes. Then my friend joked that we certainly wouldn't want her
        adjudicating at a competition! I'm not sure how she came up with 3
        minutes since she was the one who had the watch!! Jasmine

        not English. This doesn't necessarily mean they're tourists though as
        there are so many different people from everywhere who live in London.
        The other thing I've noticed is that it's pretty much always guys who'll
        come and talk to me about cubing. It's very rarely girls, and when it is
        a girl, she'll just make a brief comment ('wow, that's impressive!' or
        'you solved that thing so quickly!'). The girls are never interested in
        the actual solving or method or logic or anything like that. It's only
        the guys who ask me more detailed questions about the cube and how to
        solve it. This is not really that surprising though. I think we all know
        that any girl who is really interested in cubing is an anomaly!! :)

        &gt;3. Learn the PLL. This will let you do a three step LL. I've heard
        &gt;that people can get to at least the low 20's with this method. And
        &gt;after you learn the PLL, you can start learning the OLL. yea.. im in
        the low 20s and one of my friend's only knows half of the OLLs and is a
        sub-18 cuber. so pll definitely helps (though i think f2l makes much
        more of a difference) if you want to train for the norcal competition,
        get your f2l to be amazing. imo, it will help more. On 8/23/05,

        Jack, Well, there should only be 4 green corners and 4 green edges
        pieces. I counted 5 green edge pieces. There are 2 green/yellow edges.
        (Getting close...) The one on the left and far bottom faces of the cross
        diagram. Yet I don't know which one of those green edges should be
        orange. I suppose you could run a parity check on the edges and deduct
        that way which green should be orange. --- In

        Hi Bryan, I picked up a cube again in September 2003 after a 20 years
        lay off. Had to work out my new strategies and algorithms and have done
        a lot of one handed cubing in that time but for the last 6 months or so
        I've averaged under 35 seconds but never put in that extra effort to get
        under 30. Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From: "Bryan Mytko"

        make a brief comment ('wow, that's &gt; impressive!' or 'you solved that
        thing so quickly!'). The girls are &gt; never interested in the actual
        solving or method or logic or anything &gt; like that. It's only the
        guys who ask me more detailed questions about &gt; the cube and how to
        solve it. &gt; &gt; This is not really that surprising though. I think
        we all know that &gt; any girl who is really interested in cubing is an
        anomaly!! :) Of course the real reason is that there are far more
        heterosexual guys than lesbian girls, even in London. Stefan

        likes adult websites. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am I the only one
        thinking "Kids..."? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am I the only one who doesn't get it? &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; The only thing his/her profile tells me is that someone
        like adult &gt; &gt; websites. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And why are you
        thinking "Kids..."? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ??? &gt; &gt; -Ben &gt; &gt; Did
        you see the new world record posted on speedcubing.com earlier &gt;
        today? It's already gone, but John had posted an 18.xy onehanded &gt;
        solve. Did you see that one before it was removed again? And I thought
        &gt; "Kids" partly because I think he's around 17 years old. &gt; &gt;

        thinking "Kids..."? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ??? &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; -Ben &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did you see the new
        world record posted on &gt; &gt; speedcubing.com earlier &gt; &gt; &gt;
        today? It's already gone, but John had posted an &gt; &gt; 18.xy
        onehanded &gt; &gt; &gt; solve. Did you see that one before it was
        removed &gt; &gt; again? And I &gt; &gt; thought &gt; &gt; &gt; "Kids"
        partly because I think he's around 17 years &gt; &gt; old. &gt; &gt;

        Hey Gunnar, Yes Ron is on vacation and I am updating the records while
        he is gone. He will be back August 31. I'm sorry that something went
        weird with your record. Ron has backups of the records files on his
        computer, so we can check and see what went wrong when he gets back. As
        far as right now, go ahead and send in your 18.00 average again and I
        will post it the next time I update. Chris --- In

        Update: Ok, it looks like some of the tiles shipped between 7/24/05 and
        8/24/05 may have been bad. I've gone through all the orders that were
        placed between those dates and am resending all the tiles from those
        orders. I'd rather not wait for everyone to contact me so I'm going to
        just play it safe and resend them all. I'll send a confirmation to each
        person as I ship them. All the bad tiles that I had in stock have been
        found and tossed out, to prevent this from happening again. Thanks Chris

        I think that both of them (yellow-green edges) can be wrong. As you

        Update: &gt; &gt; Ok, it looks like some of the tiles shipped between
        7/24/05 and &gt; 8/24/05 may have been bad. I've gone through all the
        orders that were &gt; placed between those dates and am resending all
        the tiles from those &gt; orders. I'd rather not wait for everyone to
        contact me so I'm going &gt; to just play it safe and resend them all.
        &gt; I'll send a confirmation to each person as I ship them. All the bad
        &gt; tiles that I had in stock have been found and tossed out, to
        prevent &gt; this from happening again. &gt; &gt; Thanks &gt; Chris &gt;

        well just scrambling a cube and painting its portrait was the idea but
        i'm slightly colourblind and the shades of green and orange are very
        similar and so in transferring them to the sketch (which i posted) i
        made a mistake having further scrambled the cube in the meantime i could
        no longer work out where the mistake was it doesn't take a cuber to work
        out that ten green squares isn't right but it does take one to work out
        which one is the wrong one though i did consider painting the mistaken
        version i'm going to paint the corrected one which is why i asked i

        cube :-) Most artists never care about whether they get it right.
        Recently I saw a box that looked like a cube, it was large and stylish
        etc and the seller wanted lots of money for it. And it had two yellow
        centers :-(. When I asked about this he (or she?) got pretty angry at me
        ;-) Plus, not even on the official Rubik's boxes that the cubes are sold
        in, or on their booklets, did the artists get them right. The pictures
        on the Rubik's Magic box and in the booklet are also very wrong. Sigh.
        .. Cheers! Stefan

        I've been playing around with making my cube a 1x3x3. Just only allow
        F2,R2,B2,and L2. It's pretty cool cause it's only a few moves away from
        solved at any point. So far my best average is 2.82 and my best time

        Hey Jo√´l, The only thing I can think of is that the excel file Ron is
        using now has a macro to save the HTML file, which I had never used
        before (I stopped doing updates all the time a few months ago). It took
        me a while to figure out how to get the macro setup, so maybe something
        went weird when I tried to save the HTML file? I'll ask Ron when he gets
        back. If anyone did have a record go weird and revert back to an earlier
        one, just send it in again and put something in the post somewhere about
        how your old record got changed. I'll fix any stray ones that went
        weird, and then ask Ron what could have happened. Chris --- In

        Fridrich's page shows all the algs as if cross was on top, which I

        I had completely the opposite issue! I was still getting ID-ed at 27
        years old in Australia if I tried to buy alcohol. For my US friends, I
        should point out that the legal drinking age in Australia is 18 years,
        so getting ID-ed at 27 years is pretty funny. I'm about to turn 29 years
        old in 2 days and everyone always assumes I'm younger that this. In case
        you are curious, I have some pics of myself (with Dan Harris) from the

        Hmmm ... Jasmine, are you saying that Dan looks old? Just kidding. He
        hasn't even got beard or moustache ;-) I'm also having great fun letting
        girls who don't know me well guess my age. It's very nice when they
        guess i'm mid to late 20's or even early 30's. I turned 40 exactly 3
        weeks ago :D Maybe it's the cubing keeping us young ? :-P Maybe i should
        dress up like a girl and go on a train-trip there in UK and show off
        cubing in order to get a job offer ... hehe ;-) Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        Nah, Dan definitely does not look old! :) Recently, heaps more people
        have approached me while I've been cubing on the train or in other
        public places - it happens a couple of times a week now. I wondered why
        the sudden change and I came up with two ideas based on the timing of
        the change. My first thought was because there was a fair bit of
        publicity about the cube in the UK in July for the 25th anniversary of
        the cube. I wondered if maybe it got people reminicising about the cube
        they used to own adn therefore more likely to talk to someone they saw
        cubing. Another possibility, which someone else reminded me of, was that
        there were other significant events last month in London. It was
        suggested to me that after the train bombings last month, people are
        generally more observant about what's going on around them on the train
        and particularly things that are unusual. I like to think that it's the
        former - much happier to think about cube birthday celebrations! :) BTW,
        Per, I saw you in some pics on someones website from the Euros last year
        and I definitely didn't think you were almost 40 then! Jasmine

        are you saying that Dan looks old? Just kidding. He hasn't &gt; even got
        beard or moustache ;-) &gt; &gt; I'm also having great fun letting girls
        who don't know me well guess &gt; my age. It's very nice when they guess
        i'm mid to late 20's or even &gt; early 30's. I turned 40 exactly 3
        weeks ago :D Maybe it's the cubing &gt; keeping us young ? :-P &gt; &gt;
        Maybe i should dress up like a girl and go on a train-trip there in &gt;
        UK and show off cubing in order to get a job offer ... hehe ;-) &gt;

        I used to do *everything* with cross on top. It was such a crappy way to
        do things, but I until I found this group and everyone's website I
        didn't know any better. I found it *really* difficult to change after
        years of cross on top, so I highly recommend that people just learn it
        with cross on bottom to begin with. I have now moved to having the cross
        somewhere between top and left for forming the actual cross, then I have
        the cross on the left for most of the F2L, and I do most of the LL with
        cross on bottom. There's just one or two PLLs that I do with cross on

        Thanks for the news! At least now the people who buy the book will know
        the right time. Of course, this is still very stupid since the Guinness
        now contradicts the book on their site. I was amused by this, though:
        "Fastest 100m On A Unicycle Peter Rosendahl set a unicycle sprint record
        for 100 m from a standing start of 12.11 sec (29.72 km/h, or 18.47 mph)
        at Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, on March 25, 1994. His unicycle talents have

        group] wife? kids? what?!? I had completely the opposite issue! I was
        still getting ID-ed at 27 years old in Australia if I tried to buy
        alcohol. For my US friends, I should point out that the legal drinking
        age in Australia is 18 years, so getting ID-ed at 27 years is pretty
        funny. I'm about to turn 29 years old in 2 days and everyone always
        assumes I'm younger that this. In case you are curious, I have some pics
        of myself (with Dan Harris) from the 25th anniversary cube promo stuff
        we did last month:

        stick). I was just doing some algs, not even solving. Well, the window
        was open. I dropped the cube out the window as I turned at an

        I cube only at stop lights or when traffic comes to a complete stop.
        It's a great time killer at stop lights. I noticed I feel much less

        I just bought a couple 25th anniversary cubes today. The ones with the
        silver stickers instead of white. Does anyone know how to get to the
        screws? One cube was very tight and the other was very loose. You would
        think the factory would have standards concerning screw tension. It
        looks like the center piece caps are glued in. Why would they do that!?

        Hey everybody, Some company has asked me to help them with a promotional
        video or commercial... And I accepted, of course :). Pretty exited about
        this! The want me solve some cubes, and the video should express
        something like 'complex problems, short and fast solutions'. The goal is
        not to do it as fast as possible, but they want to close-up on my hands
        and see some cool and fluent finger-trick action. It's the first time I
        am actually going to earn a little money by solving cubes :). Not much
        probably, but I can use all little bits when I am in Florida!! The
        shooting of the video will take place next tuesday... They want me to
        come in a nice fancy suit :). Well.. Just wanted to share this with you

        Hey Bram, I am not sure if it's really a commercial that is meant to be
        broadcasted on national television. I think it might be something for a
        more specific group of people, maybe just to put it on a website or
        something. Anyway, I will try to ask them if they can send me a digital
        version of it, I am pretty sure that should be possible. - Joel. --- In

        sometimes. I noticed some of my cubes have quite sharp edges (not edge
        pieces, but internal edges of pieces) that lock up too often. So I
        rounded them more. Mainly the "cubic edges", though (Imagine the pieces
        as small perfect cubes and round the edges that are actually there, that
        is for 3x3, I round three edges of each corner piece and four 0.7 edges
        of each edge pieces). Another reason I got this idea was because the
        Deluxe/Game cubes pretty much never lock up and they're a bit more
        rounded than other cubes, I think. I'm gonna do it with an Eastsheen 5x5
        some (very long ;-) day, too. Cheers! Stefan

        I can't believe that would be the case - it sounds pretty unenforceable
        not mention completely mad! Also its arguable that anything that slows
        down your cube is a manufacturing defect. Having said that I've never
        sanded my "internals". Duncan (poking his nose into posts that have no
        relevance for him) &gt; I thought I had read it was not legal to sand

        nobody can verify that. Have a look at Article 3 of the rules, I guess
        that's what you meant:
        http://www.speedcubing.com/events/regulations_draft2005.html This is the
        new draft and explains with examples what's not allowed. So for example
        if you sand the internals so much that you can rotate the 9 centers of
        your 5x5 cube alone, that's not allowed. But if you sand them just so
        that the X-centers don't get accidentally rotated all the time thanks to
        locking up, that's ok. Cheers! Stefan

        &gt; Stefan Thanks, Stefan. I had been going on the pretence that it was
        not allowed. I was sure I had read that somewhere, so I did some quick
        searching and found the page (it is in the 5th paragraph after the
        section header "Rubik's.com cube speedcube"):
        http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/Speedcube/makinga.htm Since it was on the
        speedcubing.com site, I think I must have taken it as law. But I realize
        now that it is not an official document, like the one you provided. So I
        am glad this has been cleared up. -Dave

        Greetings, We want to thank everyone from the online cubing community
        who has been kind enough to send us their comments, ideas, and
        suggestions. Over the past week, we have accumulated some great ideas
        from you folks as to how we can make our product better! Please keep
        sending us feedback and continue to try out the new versions as we post
        them. The biggest change in the new version is related to the comments
        we've received about wanting an alternate method of orienting your view
        of the cube. So, without losing the existing freedom of rotation, we
        have added a secondary way to change your view of the cube. Holding down
        the left shift key while rotating a slice of the cube will turn the
        *entire* cube 90 degrees (or 180 if you also have the left CTRL key
        down) in the same axis/direction the single slice would have moved. This
        eases the ability to 'flip' the cube around and see the backside without
        losing your current perspective on the cube. Thanks to Jo√´l van Noort
        for this suggestion! An in-game help screen has been added that details
        all the available controls as well. The change log for the demo project
        is now posted on the downloads page of our website
        (http://www.gabbasoft.com) if anyone is interested in seeing everything
        that has been modified to date. Again, thanks so much for all of your
        input and we hope you will continue to send us your thoughts and ideas
        for making our product better. Regards, Jamey Pittman President
        GabbaSoft, Inc. jpittman@... http://www.gabbasoft.com

        think it's older than the WCA rules. Also, Dan Gosbee I think once came
        up with very strict rules for WC 2003. For example, I remember someone
        had the idea to glue very strong little magnets under the center caps
        instead of glueing them to the center piece, and Dan said that's not
        allowed (maybe even that you'd be disqualified). So that kind of rules
        might've been around earlier, but not anymore. Cheers! Stefan

        actually came mainly that way, I did round other edges but those
        circular parts had been that way already (the picture might give a too
        strong impression, btw, it's not that much different than a normal edge
        piece). First I thought it would be bad but surprisingly it isn't. With
        "0.7 edges" I meant the straight part, maybe it's closer to 0.6, anyway
        it's not a "whole" edge because of the circular cut (which I didn't sand
        except its edges a bit, i.e. I did sand the outer edge of the circular
        edge of the edge piece ;-). Stefan

        Take your cube to the beach. Try to avoid getting sand into your cube
        and some will still get in there but not very much. Then play with it in
        the sun (wear sunblock) for an hour or so then go home and clean your
        cube out really well and relube it. That gets cubes really smooth. ---

        I made a site last night about my first method for solving the 3x3x3
        blindfolded...I like to think it's something like my method: Macky's
        method :: layer by layer method : Fridrich method That is, it's a place
        to start...it is kind of tedious because it is so simplified...not much
        mental gymnastics. I am evolving past this method, but I thought I would
        share it. I keep finding bugs in the document, so I hope some people
        will not hesitate to send me things to correct. If anyone actually
        learns to solve blindfolded because of the site, let me know... that
        would be great. Thanks to all blindfold cubers for their inspiration and
        methods: Stefan Pochmann, who definitely gave me ideas for my method
        Shotaro, Leyan, Tyson, Chris Hardwick: You are all awesome Richard Carr

        I'm only about 90% sure (pretty sure) about this since I don't have one
        of those cubes myself, but since no one else is answering: The 25th
        anniversary cubes and generally any Rubik's cube you find in your
        average store do not have screws under the center caps. Instead, it has
        these annoying rivets that cannot be adjusted (except possibly to push
        them in further) to hold the centers in place. If you want to be able to
        adjust screw tension, the way to go is the DIY cube from the rubiks.com.
        You could also search around for a Rubik's Studio cube which also has
        screws, but those are harder to come by. Hope this helps, Scott p.s. If
        I'm wrong and they do have screws beneath the caps, someone correct me
        so I can feel quite dumb for not having purchased one. --- In

        I've been trying to teach my 7 year old sister (my father bet me $100
        she couldn't learn it - kinda like your bet Bob, only in my favor :) )
        She understands the cross, but has difficulties completing it. It's a
        very slow process. I think the intuitive stuff will be the most
        difficult, as children are usually very quick to memorize things,
        especially when it comes to games. I think a few algs will be easily
        handled. Bryan Mytko bryanosaurus@... On Aug 25, 2005, at 10:26 PM, Bob

        My wife and I (mostly my wife) recently taught my 10 year old sister-
        in-law to finish the f2l with a working corner method (cross/bottom
        corners/bottom edges/cross on top). My wife did have to explain a lot
        more details than you'd expect from an adult, but that's not a surprise.
        Also, a big help was that we were on a long, boring six hour car ride,
        so attention span wasn't an issue. Her choices were learn to cube or be
        completely bored. (hmm.... that sounds mean.) Scott --- In

        Hey everyone, I'm still working on my 4x4x4 tutorial, it's pretty long
        so far with lots of pictures and detailed explanations. Anyway I'm done
        with the centers page, my method for the edges, and now I'm working on a
        page with a detailed example solve of the 6 pair method. Again I
        wouldn't use that approach except for in very rare special cases for my
        method, but I've done a lot of practicing with it, so I want to include
        it to be fair to those who like it, especially since it can be VERY
        fast. So anyway I think I can finish either tomorrow (well Friday lol)
        or Saturday. I'll post the link once I'm finished with everything. So if
        you're looking for a really detailed explanation of a 4x4x4 speed solve
        method you don't have to wait long! Chris P.S. This entire page is only
        on how to transform your scrambled 4x4 into a scrambled 3x3 (with the
        potential for parities still). So your 4x4 times will still very much
        depend on your 3x3x3 times, but as I say on the page you might as well
        use a nice method for the transforming part to help your times. Anyway
        it'll be up soon!

        his massive contribution with videos and methodology, this site wouldn't
        be as good or nearly as accurate without his help. also chris hardwick
        for help with the 4x4 ideas and some proofreading. and last but not
        least lars petrus who's extremely badass applet filled 3x3 page inspired
        me to try and reach the same great level with page, and getting me to
        start speedsolving. many edits will be made i'm sure there's lots of
        spelling and other things, and i'm adding specific points of acheivement
        and other things to help people along. please email me via the group or

        bigcubes anyone? ok after about 2 months of hella work i'd like to
        unveil a pretty much completed www.bigcubes.com i hope this site will
        help with all the the ?'s i've seen lately on bigger cubes. i'd like to
        thank frank morris for his massive contribution with videos and
        methodology, this site wouldn't be as good or nearly as accurate without
        his help. also chris hardwick for help with the 4x4 ideas and some
        proofreading. and last but not least lars petrus who's extremely badass
        applet filled 3x3 page inspired me to try and reach the same great level
        with page, and getting me to start speedsolving. many edits will be made
        i'm sure there's lots of spelling and other things, and i'm adding
        specific points of acheivement and other things to help people along.
        please email me via the group or the link on the site for any ?s or
        comments. clancy __________________________________________________ Do

        Jo√´l, When I got my first 4x4x4 back around 1983 I almost solved it with
        just the 3x3x3 algorithms and some basic logic. I got stuck with the
        edge piece parity problem and how to permute center pieces. Since the
        parity problem comes around only 50 percent of the time I would just
        shuffle the edges up a bit and permute them again until the parity
        problem didn't appear. A book helped me with permuting center pieces. I
        now have a 15 move algorithm that permutes two edge pieces and solves
        the parity problem. If you can solve the 3x3x3 I'm sure you are close.
        How close can you get to solving the 4x4x4 now? --- In

        was 9 (or possibly 8), because she asked me to. The cube was tough for
        her, trying on her own, and she had got discouraged, even though she had
        already solved the pyraminx partly by herself. The cross was no problem
        for her, but placing 3 corners with the correct orientations was
        difficult for her to grasp. The first 3 middle layer edges were no
        problem. "Picking up the last edge with the last corner" was harder
        again. I encouraged her to practice F2L a lot before we went on to LL.
        She "got" the commutator principle surprisingly quickly. All of her LL
        methods are based on commutators. And no conjugates, I think. The whole
        process took several weeks, with a session every few days when she asked
        for one: we took it slowly, so she would understand what she was doing

        several thousand strangers if they can solve the cube. (If someone can
        solve the cube reliably, the chances are that they can do it in under 5
        minutes, wouldn't you think?) &gt; It seems we are few and far &gt;

        didn't give up. And you have to really /want/ to do it. ;) Of course, if
        more people around you are doing it, this will help generate the
        necessary interest: at university in the early 80s quite a lot of people
        I knew (male and female) could solve the Cube in a few minutes. But
        students of maths, science and engineering are not a typical subset of

        I've never made the custom stickers, but I did make up little flash
        cards of OLL where I tried to use the pictures in MS Word and I had the
        same problem. I never figured out how to move them, so I just e- mailed
        the pictures to myself, one by one, where they ended up in the middle of
        the page. I don't know how the sticker sheet is set up, but I'm thinking
        you could do it sort of the way I did my flash cards by first printing
        on paper your picture. You would then know just where your picture ends
        up, and tape the sticker sheet exactly over that, running it through the
        printer again. Like I said, I don't know what the sticker sheets look
        like, or if they're too thick for your printer to feed them with another
        sheet of paper. My printer wouldn't feed the card when it was on the
        left side of the page, but it could when it was in the middle. Matt ---

        but there's one comment I'd like to give already. You say: "This system,
        because it uses 2-cycles, will not allow you to break the world record
        for solving blindfolded." That is wrong. I'm using 2-cycles as well and
        I've solved the cube (just not blindfolded) under 1 minute this way.
        With more practice and some more algorithms I'm sure I can average 1
        minute. The unofficial world record might be harder to beat, but the
        official one stands at over 2 minutes so with fast memorization it's
        definitely possible to beat it. Cheers! Stefan

        Hello everyone here, I am J.bernett orlando.I AM 9 NOW. I learnt 3*3*3
        when I was 7 from my dad. He knows only LBL method even today. He is
        happy with his under 2 min solves. Mr.Stefan Pochmann then tutored me
        for blindfold. He really made me to think rather than just tutoring.
        Thanks to him. Then I learnt F2L I understood the theory behind these
        algm on my own. Now I know all 57 OLL and 21 PLL. by heart but can not
        explain the theory of these algms. I learnt 4*4*4 from chris hardwick
        page. I learnt 5*5*5 and megaminx myself. I am not sure what those
        methods are called. I have to improve my solving 5*5*5 and megaminx. I
        am still learning fingering from Bob Burtons video. Mr.Ron Van Bruchem,
        Mr. Tyson Mao are really encouraging me to come back fair and genuine
        after the biggest mistake I made 2 months ago. Thanks to both of them. I
        have successfully tutored few of my relatives and friends(not less than
        10 and all are below 13). I successfully taught my elder sister 3*3*3
        blindfolded. She is doing correctly!! J.Bernett Orlando turtleparadise

        Hey everyone, The page is finally done. It's huge, so don't expect to
        get through it quickly. I still need to add some more organization,
        break up the longer pages, and things like that, but all the content is
        already there. http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4speedsolve.html I did
        include a walk-through solve using the 6-pair method, but please keep in
        mind that in no way am I an expert in using the 6 pair method. So if you
        really want to learn that method well, then ask around. I did try to put
        in the tricks that I know for it though, which really isn't much. The 2
        pair method is extremely detailed with all the special case situations
        that I would recognize, so feel free to check that out too. Many thanks
        to Clancy, and Richard Patterson for helping me proofread and getting
        feedback on layout. Also the most thanks goes to Jon Morris for the
        great 4x4 template! The graphics look really nice, so Jon thanks a
        bunch! Let me know what you all think. Keep in mind, although the
        content is all there, it's still a work in progress. I just couldn't
        wait any longer to post it :-D Chris

        without taking the whole thing &gt; apart??? I wrote this guide as an
        e-mail to Dave Campbell a few weeks ago. I don't remember the details
        and I don't feel like re-reading them, so some of this stuff may not
        apply, but I believe it will give you enough information to do what you
        need: This explains how to (re)place a string. 1) Identify the location
        of where the string belongs. This part is simple. Look for the two gaps
        in which there are only two strings instead of four. It's quite easy to
        notice. The gaps will be diagonal from each other. The three tiles that
        "touch" those gaps are the ones that the missing string belongs on. If
        any of the gaps are above/below tiles instead of next to the tiles (ie -
        not all in the same row of tiles), then fold the magic, shift the magic
        so that the gaps will be in the same row, and then open it again. 2)
        Find the location of the missing metal bit. There are two main options:
        a) place it so that there are 2 metal bits on every other tile; or: b)
        place it so that there is 1 metal bit on every tile. Choose which
        pattern you wish to follow (or follow the existing pattern). This will
        determine where you will "start" in the string. 3) Place the string
        around the first corner (it will be diagonal and to the outside of
        either of the gaps that has fewer strings. Make sure you have an idea of
        where the metal bit will go when you put the string around the first
        corner. You will want to put the string behind the corner, not in front,
        so this will determine how you hold the puzzle. You have to follow the
        over-and-under pattern already existing on the puzzle. 4) String the
        puzzle. Follow the over-under pattern along the three tiles, wrap it
        around, and bring it back the other way. Make sure you place the strings
        properly into the gaps. You will want to achieve a "sandwich" of
        strings. This means that you will have one string going in a direction,
        two strings above it going in the perpendicular direction, and then a
        fourth string at the top going in the original direction. 5) Place the
        last loop of the string. This part is the most difficult, but becomes
        easy with practice. When you place the last loop of the string, you want
        to make sure you do this on an inside corner, so that there is an even
        distribution of tension. Try to flex the tiles to make this easier. You
        may want to use something to bring the string over the last corner. I
        used to use a pencap, but I have also used a pen/pencil for this (though
        this may put a nick in the string, I suspect). I believe Stefan Pochmann
        uses gift twine. Now, I just use my fingers. It will seem like it will
        not go, but if you force it (not too hard!) it will go over the corner.

        sorry if this is a repeat but a couple people said they didn't ever see
        this message for some reason.. ok after about 2 months of hella work i'd
        like to unveil a pretty much completed http://www.bigcubes.com i hope
        this site will help with all the the ?'s i've seen lately on bigger
        cubes. i'd like to thank frank morris for his massive contribution with
        videos and methodology, this site wouldn't be as good or nearly as
        accurate without his help. also chris hardwick for help with the 4x4
        ideas and some proofreading. and last but not least lars petrus who's
        extremely badass applet filled 3x3 page inspired me to try and reach the
        same great level with page, and getting me to start speedsolving. many
        edits will be made i'm sure there's lots of spelling and other things,
        and i'm adding specific points of acheivement and other things to help
        people along. please email me via the group or the link on the site for
        any ?s or comments.

        Cube Demo Updated For 20x20x20 Cube Support Greetings, I can't believe
        how many requests we've received about the desire for larger cubes! Of
        course, I should have known better after I saw that someone in Japan had
        solved the 9x9x9 in a little over 2 hours and posted the screenshots on
        his site. So, as of this release, we now support cube sizes up to
        20x20x20. I would certainly expect that performance will noticably
        degrade on slower/older systems when you get up to 15x15x15 and above
        but you are free to give `em a try. Ton from Speedcubing.com made the
        request for changing the timer behavior to wait until the first move is
        made after a scramble to start ¬ñ seemed to be a good idea to me so that
        has been added as well. We've also received enough comments about the
        moving background making people dizzy to change it and make it static ¬ñ
        we hope you like it better! You can get the latest version from our
        downloads page: http://www.gabbasoft.com/download.htm As always, thanks
        so much for all of your input and we hope you will continue to send us
        your thoughts and ideas for making our product better. Regards, Jamey

        Hey James, Thanks for pointing that out I totally missed that when I was
        writing. I just fixed it so the link works now. I'll check the rest of
        the page again tomorrow for structural errors. I spent some time tonight
        going over the solves and correcting typos and weird parts. Gotta still
        proofread the 6 pair page some more though. Thanks for the help though,
        I want this page to be nice so I need to fix any bugs in it :-D Chris

        The sad thing is, I don't think it genuinely broke. Just one of the edge
        cubies popped out and maybe a corner. When I brought it sadly to my
        stepdad to fix, we didn't have the Jim Nourse book and he had no idea
        that you had to turn it 45 degrees to put it back. I think he ended up
        with a cube without one corner piece, at which point he gave up and
        returned it to the toy store. In that short time, however, the store had
        switched from the cylinder cubes to the boxed ones, so I never got the
        cylinder cube back. :( --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I never would have survived that early moring drive to Chicago had I not
        cubed while driving. Cubing while driving a stick isn't that hard,

        I taught my younger brother (turned ten a few days ago) to solve the
        first two layers a couple of weeks ago, before I left the country.
        Depending on whether people have an easier time seeing corners or edges,
        I teach them a corners first approach or a layer one. He, like most,
        sees edges fairly easily, so that's the way we went. For most beginners,
        I try to remember the things that helped me when I was teaching myself,
        thinking back to the days of elation after ten or more minute solves. A
        good 'trick' is to get the pieces directly below where they need to end
        up. Then there are two simple cases: F2; or adjust D, RF'R or L'FL. Same
        for corners. Directly under where they should be, matching up the
        sticker colors to the center in front. (cross on white on top) 'If white
        is on the right, hold the white sticker on the right side; then, R'D'R.'
        If it's on the left, hold the white sticker on the left, then show them
        LDL'. The one that gives people the most trouble, in my experience, is
        the case where the white sticker is facing down. The most successful way
        to tackle this is to show them to solve it like either case, but make a
        D2 turn instead, to 'make it usable.' &gt;From there, I think using the
        algs FU2RUR'U2F' and FU2RU'R'U2F' are very easy to understand, because
        the target spot is always in the same place, and the algs differ only in
        the direction of a single turn. If they do well with this, working
        corners are next, using a similar approach to the corner pieces. For the
        LL, they always seem to do the best with a sheet of paper with the steps
        described clearly and with pictures. Some people get OeLL+PCLL+OCLL+PELL
        very easily, which can be very fast. Others have trouble recognizing the
        corner permutation cases, so I have them do OELL+OCLL+PCLL+PELL. This
        will probably be more conducive later to upgrading to full PLL, but I
        think is harder to learn at the outset. That's all the advice I have at
        the moment, and I may write more if I have time later. -Mike Bennett ---

        i to am stupid enough to cube while driving....its kind of dangerous in
        the bay area, i've restricted it to stoplights now because then the
        worst consequense is a honk, but as for mobile cubing i don't really
        recommend it, especially if u live in a heavy traffic area. its rather
        hard for me not to look every now and then, but if u can control ur

        Ok, I'll start, if you insist. :) Here's an adventure I had with the
        second cube I ever owned. As you may have noticed, the faces of the
        Rubik's Cube TURN. Therefore, said my flawless 8-year-old boyhood logic,
        I can stand on the cube, on one leg, and spin around like a ballarina.
        So I tried it and managed to spin about 1/8 turn. I tried it again and
        got up to a quarter turn. Then I really cranked it up and spun (span?)
        as hard and fast as I could. CRRUNCH Suddenly I was on the ground, with
        my cube in about a dozen pieces. One of the centers had completely come
        off, screw and all. I told my stepdad, "Uhh my cube broke again" and he
        replied, "I'm going to exchange this one more time. If you break it
        again, you will not get another one." Needless to say, that third cube
        was not used as a Stand-n-Spin. It lasted a LONG time.

        Wow, this is so much fun (not to mention ADDICTING!). Ian came over my
        house today and we did team blindfold for the 2nd time together (1st
        being last weekend). :) We got a best average of 44.72 seconds:

        just unde 4 MB. Our best single was a 33.98, though we did get a 29.80
        PLL skip early on. :) I believe we are both shocked at our average being
        14 seconds faster than last week. :D ~ Bob

        The file is just unde 4 MB. &gt; &gt; Our best single was a 33.98,
        though we did get a 29.80 PLL skip early &gt; on. :) &gt; &gt; I believe
        we are both shocked at our average being 14 seconds faster &gt; than
        last week. :D &gt; &gt; ~ Bob

        nice man. love that. same thing yesterday, in my neighborhood we had a
        summer jubilee. so i did some public cubing in front of soo many ppl i
        lost count. Then went to starbucks and did more cubing, suddenly this

      <div class="email-content">
        Some weeks ago I posted a very excited email detailing something like a
        plan for a method involving C(O)LL and (E)PLL. After much experimenting,
        a lot of number crunching, and more struggling than I care to put into
        words, I've decided against this for several reasons. Some people
        thought it would be too complicated, or that the benefits wouldn't be
        enough. To the former, I still think otherwise, especially after certain
        people named Chris successfully used large chunks of ZB in Dallas. To
        the latter, I think this now to be true. Instead, I now think cases 1
        and 2 of ZBF2L, along with COLL and EPLL will be a much better full time
        strategy entailing better rewards and fewer algs and decisions. However,
        I would like to go farther than that. Inspired both by Chris' recent
        performance, and by Bob's decision to persue ZB as a method, and after
        playing with ZBF2L a bit for my COLL, I think a modified COLL+some
        specialized ZB approach would be either a decent method in its own
        right, or at least a useful stepping stone to full ZB. For ZBF2L, I
        would pretty much learn it as is, or with a few added special cases for
        some corner orienting. Then, COLL+EPLL. I would also take advantage of
        OLL skips due to ZBF2L by employing PLL when applicable. The stats for
        this seem to me something like the following: Chance to skip EPLL step:
        1/12 OLL step: 1/8 LL entirely: 1/1944 Any other things I'm missing at
        the moment, which there seem to be, that I can't quite remember, and the
        less frequent COLL solves due to OLL skips leave us with the grand total
        at about a 20% chance of a skipped step during a solve. This is similar
        to Vandenbergh/Harris, I believe. Now, adding in the ZB cases only for
        correctly permuted corners, we get better odds for when we still do
        COLL. The odds to skip the PLL after COLL are 1/12. The odds for cases
        with correct corner permutation are something like 18% of COLL cases,
        meaning we have odds of 1/12 for 82% of cases, and odds of 100% for 18%
        of COLL cases. The total odds for PLL skip after our COLL would then be
        something like 25% or 1/4. Factoring in the reduced occasion for COLL
        because of OLL skips the stats begin to look more like... Chance to skip
        Step during COLL: 1/5 OLL step: 1/8 other special cases: x Total:
        ~32.5+% or a little over 3/10 I'm sure there are ways to add in special
        cases and tricks to further this, but even without any a 1/3 chance for
        a one step LL is very powerful, especially in comparison with standard
        OLL+PLL, with a chance to skip a step at about 1/8 with early edge
        orienting and almost neglibible without. The reason I'm considering
        cases with corners correctly permuted as opposed to learning specific
        orientation cases fully is that they're generally easier to recognize
        than other cases as a whole, and can often be completed by using
        Sune/Antisunes from different angles, making them fast, and easy to
        execute. Also, when I do get one of those cases, it feels almost lazy to
        just do a simple Sune/Antisune instead of a longer COLL alg. Of course,
        this leaves us with lots of cases to learn (158 for ZBF2L and about 75
        new cases for ZBLL, assuming you already know COLL, putting us at around
        380 new cases total with reflections), but I still think that's a
        managable number, considering simple reflections, the massive benefits,
        and the staggering abilities demonstrated by people who already know and
        use hundreds of algorithms. Since I'm writing this at 3:44 in the
        morning local time after a long day, I'm not entirely certain I've
        explained myself well, so feel free to comment/criticize as necessary.
        Any thoughts are much appreciated, especially from those of you using
        similar approaches. -Mike Bennett

        Hi ! Yes i agree that demanding DirectX 9.0b or whatever it was is a bit
        over the top. But that's typical. Those developers of coz have the
        latest software and hardware. A game like this would work perfectly with
        DirectX 6 or 7. And would then be compatible with windows98 as well as
        windows95 even. And older hardware. That said it's probably a minority
        who don't have at least windows 2000 professional today. The problem
        with DirectX 9.0b on old computers is not that it's impossible to
        install that DirectX version on the OS. The problem is that the graphics
        cards on old computers won't support it, more specifially won't support
        the instruction set (API) of the Direct X version. Actually installing
        DirectX 9 on systems with non- compatible graphics cards probably means
        that the OS needs to be reinstalled as there is no (easy) to uninstall
        it. This happened to me some yrs ago. The marvellous installtion CD
        coming with the screencard kindly installed DirectX 9 even my specific
        card didn't support it. Had i only installed it the manual way it would
        have been fine ... grrrr ... Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        start ¬ñ seemed to be a good idea to me so that has been added as &gt;
        well. We've also received enough comments about the moving &gt;
        background making people dizzy to change it and make it static ¬ñ we &gt;
        hope you like it better! You can get the latest version from our &gt;

        Hi all, Yesterday my Rubik's 2x2x2 fell apart and although I managed to
        reconstruct it, I cannot turn one of the directions. I assume this has
        to do with the different kind of quarter circular things that are in
        there. I just put them in arbitrarily, which was probably the wrong way
        to go. Can anyone tell me how I should have put them in? I hope somebody
        can help me. - Bram ================================================ De

        Bram, In the Photos section of this group, there is an album called "Fix
        your 2x2x2" where someone posted photos of the reassembly of a Rubik's
        2x2x2 with instructions. And you're right that you have to be more
        selective as to where you put the little wedges. Hope that helps, Scott

        Hi Stefan! Wow! What a hardcore scrambler ;-) No user options at all ...
        hehe ... Well that's what u wanted so im not gonna suggest u add options
        for scramble length and stuff like that :D But i have an idea anyway. I
        know u have just dumped the numbers from the main control loop, hence
        first scramble is number zero (0). How about letting it start from 1 and
        go up to 50? It's just that little bit more natural for ordinary deadly
        humans ... lol ... Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        nice. I personally do not public cube. In school i just take out the
        cube and casually solve it during lunch and stuff like that, making
        myself as unnoticable as possible. Because then everyone starts
        gathering and they're like "I can do that in 10 seconds" and tons of
        crap like that. gets annoying. feel like slapping them, but its still
        school. My science teacher managed to figure out that i could do it and
        he was impressed (but he was cool). So i usually stay away from public
        cubing. -parth

        Chris Hardwick is almost done updating a page with our F2L codes. Here
        are the first few codes. The F2L slot to be filled is always placed in
        the FR spot. A1 - edge is correctly placed, corner is in the top layer
        with white facing right A2 - same but white faces front A3 - same but
        white faces up C1 - edge is placed backwards, corner in the top layer

        white faces up In message 18337 I wrote up a detailed explanation of a

        rooms with 10 points each. I'd like the index of the point tell me both
        the room and the point inside the room, which is nicer if I have 00-99
        than if it's 01-100. Also, when memorizing digit sequences and
        memorizing two digits at a time, I get 00-99 anyway.

        Hello Bram, Even though its not complete yet, maybe my page can help?
        http://www.geocities.com/pjgat09/misc2a.html After you finish the steps
        on my page, find the UBR corner, and put the heart shaped piece into it
        facing the other square center, then put another rounded edge piece into
        the other side of it, then slide it into its correct place. Then take
        the UBL corner, and put a rounded edge piece into in, and slide it into
        place. Next, take the UFL corner, put the remaining squared edge piece
        into facing the other one and slide it on. Now heres the hard part: Take
        your selected corner, and slide it over the 2 squared edge pieces. Notw
        push and pull it over the heart shaped edge until it "pops" into place.
        You cube should now work fine!! Good luck! Tell me how it goes. Peter

        I think you're correct about that. Let's update the stats, then. Instead
        of 20% odds for the scenario with regular COLL, ZBF2L, and PLL when
        applicable, it's now more like 12%. And, instead of 33% odds for with
        the correct corners ZBLL cases, it's now more like 27.78%. Not great,
        but still much better. More than twice as good, in fact. It still means
        the odds for a 1 look LL are something greater than 1 out of 4, and when
        you don't skip, you've still only got an edge PLL case for the second
        one. So, pending further experimentation, this is now my new plan. I
        suppose I should finish learning the last few COLL's first... More

      <div class="email-content">
        Hey Mike, my comments below: &gt; Some weeks ago I posted a very excited
        email detailing something &gt; like a plan for a method involving C(O)LL
        and (E)PLL. After much &gt; experimenting, a lot of number crunching,
        and more struggling than I &gt; care to put into words, I've decided
        against this for several &gt; reasons. &gt; &gt; Some people thought it
        would be too complicated, or that the &gt; benefits wouldn't be enough.
        To the former, I still think &gt; otherwise, especially after certain
        people named Chris successfully &gt; used large chunks of ZB in Dallas.
        To the latter, I think this now &gt; to be true. I haven't done much
        experimenting with strictly COLL/(E)PLL, but it sounds like you put a
        lot of work into this and I trust your judgement. I had thought for a
        while that maybe the 1/12 chance for a PLL skip or the 1/27 chance for
        an OLL skip might add up to overcome the slower COLL, but if you don't
        think that does then I think that is good to know. &gt; &gt; Instead, I
        now think cases 1 and 2 of ZBF2L, along with COLL and &gt; EPLL will be
        a much better full time strategy entailing better &gt; rewards and fewer
        algs and decisions. Why not also add the ZBF2L with all LL edges either
        correctly oriented or all incorrectly oriented? Those are all, for the
        most part, some of the fastest ZBF2L algs. &gt; &gt; However, I would
        like to go farther than that. Inspired both by &gt; Chris' recent
        performance, and by Bob's decision to persue ZB as a &gt; method, and
        after playing with ZBF2L a bit for my COLL, I think a &gt; modified
        COLL+some specialized ZB approach would be either a decent &gt; method
        in its own right, or at least a useful stepping stone to full &gt; ZB.
        So far I think my LL skip count is up to 23.xx% maybe 24.xx% and I like
        this type of method so far. I have thought that maybe only know the "T"
        orientation, and the other orientation where two adjacent corners are
        twisted, but the other direction as the "T" ("H" orientation on Dan
        Harris' page) would be a good method just by itself. Those two OLL cases
        are some of the easiest to recognize, since two corners are twisted
        correctly and can be used as a "base". Also knowing those two cases and
        all COLL would give you a 1/27 + 8/27 + (18/27)*(1/12) = 38.89% chance
        of a 1 look LL. I think those two are the easiest ZBLL cases for
        recognition, and knowing just those two and COLL gives you a nearly 40%
        chance of a 1 look LL, which would be realyl powerful! In fact, after I
        finish with the "T" orientation I'm going to start learning the "H"
        orientation next for just the reason of using the two together for that
        nearly 40% chance of a 1 look. &gt; &gt; For ZBF2L, I would pretty much
        learn it as is, or with a few added &gt; special cases for some corner
        orienting. Then, COLL+EPLL. I would &gt; also take advantage of OLL
        skips due to ZBF2L by employing PLL when &gt; applicable. The stats for
        this seem to me something like the &gt; following: &gt; &gt; Chance to
        skip &gt; EPLL step: 1/12 &gt; OLL step: 1/8 &gt; LL entirely: 1/1944
        &gt; Any other things I'm missing at the moment, which there seem to be,
        &gt; that I can't quite remember, and the less frequent COLL solves due
        &gt; to OLL skips leave us with the grand total at about a 20% chance of
        &gt; a skipped step during a solve. This is similar to &gt;
        Vandenbergh/Harris, I believe. After trying ZB some in Dallas I've come
        to the conclusion that ZB2L is totally reasonable for competitive
        solving. Each fo the 23 F2L cases is broken down into 8 sub-cases, with
        lots of cool simplifications for symmetry. So your recognition has two
        phases, F2L case (by looking ahead you know this before finishing the
        3rd F2L pair) and LL edges case. You can recognize the LL edges case by
        looking at only the LL edges currently in the LL after solving the 3rd
        F2L pair, so even this is possible by looking ahead leaving no
        transition from 3rd to 4th pair. So I think your idea to learn ZBF2L is
        totally reasonable, even for competitions. It will take a lot of
        practice obviously, but I don't think it is too much to recall under
        pressure given enough practice. &gt; &gt; Now, adding in the ZB cases
        only for correctly permuted corners, we &gt; get &gt; better odds for
        when we still do COLL. The odds to skip the PLL &gt; after COLL are
        1/12. The odds for cases with correct corner &gt; permutation are
        something like 18% of COLL cases, meaning we have &gt; odds of 1/12 for
        82% of cases, and odds of 100% for 18% of COLL &gt; cases. The total
        odds for PLL skip after our COLL would then be &gt; something like 25%
        or 1/4. Factoring in the reduced occasion for &gt; COLL because of OLL
        skips the stats begin to look more like... &gt; &gt; Chance to skip &gt;
        Step during COLL: 1/5 &gt; OLL step: 1/8 &gt; other special cases: x
        &gt; Total: ~32.5+% or a little over 3/10 &gt; &gt; I'm sure there are
        ways to add in special cases and tricks to &gt; further this, but even
        without any a 1/3 chance for a one step LL is &gt; very powerful,
        especially in comparison with standard OLL+PLL, with &gt; a chance to
        skip a step at about 1/8 with early edge orienting and &gt; almost
        neglibible without. &gt; &gt; The reason I'm considering cases with
        corners correctly permuted as &gt; opposed to learning specific
        orientation cases fully is that they're &gt; generally easier to
        recognize than other cases as a whole, and can &gt; often be completed
        by using Sune/Antisunes from different angles, &gt; making them fast,
        and easy to execute. Also, when I do get one of &gt; those cases, it
        feels almost lazy to just do a simple Sune/Antisune &gt; instead of a
        longer COLL alg. I'm not sure whether or not I agree on the recognition
        for the corners correctly permuted ZBLL cases. I've found that the first
        thing my brain has to settle on for ZBLL recognition is always the COLL
        case. There are many examples of cases that look exactly the same for
        edges, but the COLL case is different. So for the reason of avoiding
        mis-reading the case I prefer to always look for the COLL case first.
        Maybe it wouldn't be bad, but personally I think it would be hard, since
        my brain always seems to settle on seeing the COLL case first, but it
        could also be that I've trained that way from the start. &gt; Of course,
        this leaves us with lots of cases to learn (158 for ZBF2L &gt; and about
        75 new cases for ZBLL, assuming you already know COLL, &gt; putting us
        at around 380 new cases total with reflections), but I &gt; still think
        that's a managable number, considering simple &gt; reflections, the
        massive benefits, and the staggering abilities &gt; demonstrated by
        people who already know and use hundreds of &gt; algorithms. &gt; I also
        agree to that being a manageable number. I think knowing 2-3 full OLL
        cases should be manageable for most people. I think that ZB is just a
        mental barrier right now. Once more people start to learn the algs I
        think that barrier will break down and people won't be afraid to learn
        so many algs. Right now it seems like a lot because most people only use
        around 100 or so algs (23+57+21=101 for Fridrich F2L + OLL + PLL). Most
        people wouldn't consider the 23 algs for F2L as "algs" per se but as
        intuition. That is my exact same feeling about a LOT of ZBF2L cases, so
        it's not 158 algs per se, because lots of cases are reductions to a few
        common recurring short cases. &gt; Since I'm writing this at 3:44 in the
        morning local time after a &gt; long day, I'm not entirely certain I've
        explained myself well, so &gt; feel free to comment/criticize as
        necessary. Any thoughts are much &gt; appreciated, especially from those
        of you using similar approaches. I tried to give my thoughts as best I
        could, and would also appreciate feedback, particularly about
        recognizing ZBLL differently from COLL then EPLL. I think that would be
        hard, but I would love to be proved wrong! &gt; &gt; -Mike Bennett Chris

        correctly &gt; oriented or all incorrectly oriented? Those are all, for
        the most &gt; part, some of the fastest ZBF2L algs. Sorry for the lack
        of clarity. I meant to say that I felt cases 1 and 2, along with COLL
        and EPLL will be faster than the method I previously suggested. I'm
        currently only using chunks of cases 1 and 2, and most of the COLL algs,
        but intend to use full ZBF2L eventually. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason
        I'm considering cases with corners correctly permuted &gt; as &gt; &gt;
        opposed to learning specific orientation cases fully is that &gt;
        they're &gt; &gt; generally easier to recognize than other cases as a
        whole, and can &gt; &gt; often be completed by using Sune/Antisunes from
        different angles, &gt; &gt; making them fast, and easy to execute. Also,
        when I do get one of &gt; &gt; those cases, it feels almost lazy to just

        &gt; thing my brain has to settle on for ZBLL recognition is always the

        seeing the COLL case first, &gt; but it could also be that I've trained
        that way from the start. Actually, I would really see the COLL case
        first, then the edges permutation. That's how it's going so far, at
        least. I know the 2 Z perms for the two cases with adjacent corners
        flipped. All you need to see is two adjacent edges to know the case.
        It's similar to recognizing the EPLL as a separate step. It may be less
        efficient to do it this way, but I think it will work for me, given my
        currently atrocious LL times at present. In fact, I think the longer
        recognition won't be a problem at all, because even when I perform a 3
        cycle to finish perfectly after COLL, it still takes over 1 second. This
        doesn't include any recognition. I think I can be competitive this way,
        but it may be too much for other cubers. &gt; Most people wouldn't
        consider the 23 algs for F2L as "algs" per se &gt; but as intuition.
        That is my exact same feeling about a LOT of &gt; ZBF2L cases, so it's
        not 158 algs per se, because lots of cases are &gt; reductions to a few
        common recurring short cases. Actually, I've never considered them algs,
        because I never learned them as such. I taught myself an intuitive F2L
        after Chicago, and edge orienting is really just a simple extension.
        Most of the ZB algs I know right now either involve pairing up, then
        inserting+flipping, or flipping, then pairing+inserting. Since this is
        the same as an intuitive approach, just slightly more concrete, the
        going is easy. The only cases giving me problems are the ones without
        clear pairing/flipping/inserting stages. These really aren't that bad,
        though, because they're generally simple and short. &gt; I tried to give
        my thoughts as best I could, and would also &gt; appreciate feedback,
        particularly about recognizing ZBLL differently &gt; from COLL then
        EPLL. I think that would be hard, but I would love &gt; to be proved
        wrong! Like I said, it's really not much different, except that you
        recognize the EPLL before you perform COLL. It's very simple for me,
        because I use the recognition method on Gilles' and Lars V's sites. The
        sticker method everyone else seems to use boggles my mind. Again, it may
        be less efficient because it would be harder to see the EPLL ahead of
        time, as you could with COLL, but I think it will balance in the end due
        to the effectiveness of the 1 look LL. Anywho, thanks for the feedback,
        and keep the ideas coming. -Mike Bennett P.S. I replied to this once,
        with a nicely planned out, long, fantastically well written email. Then,
        I hit 'Send' and waited. Yahoo decided to lose the post and give me an

        And, because I forgot to include it in the second go-round on the reply,
        here's an extra bit of fun: When I recognize the edge perm case on the
        two ZB cases I know some of, I nearly always seem to hold the cube so I
        can see the UF and UL edges. I often use the UR edge, instead, though,
        because sometimes I see that one first. I think, I will have to pick one
        side and stick to it, though, because recognizing from two different
        angles all the time would make twice as many cases to see. If I can
        train myself to always look to the UL and UF edges after I AUF for the
        COLL case, I think it will help. Since the cases I know now are rather
        symmetrical, it's not a problem, but I think could be very harmful in
        the end if not taken care of. Again, it differs very little from
        standard COLL+EPLL, except in the timing of the recognition steps. I
        think it will be very fast, once I get used to it, but for now it's
        still somewhat slow. Time will tell. And now, goodnight. -Mike Bennett

        I had been to our - tamil nadu capital city - Madras on saturday and

        train. I was cubing in the train. So many asked me to solve fast and
        BLD. I amazed everyone and taught the tricks of it to them. on sunday, I
        demonstrated for an hour solving all the cubes 2*2*2, 3*3*3, 3*3*3 BLD,
        4*4*4, 5*5*5 and megaminx for a gathering of 100 Rotarians(Rotary club)
        in a well organised show in a 5 star hotel in Madras. 3*3*3 BLD was the
        most attractive one for the audience. It was excellent and I had a nice
        time as well - very good food and a gift. This is my first public cubing

        I already put it back together. Just adding all the non-standard pieces
        to one corner piece and putting it between the non-turning core pieces
        seemed to work fine. Friction is still high, but that can be due to the
        fact that the cube is new. I will have a look at your page anyway.

        and slide it into place. Next, take the UFL corner, put the remaining
        squared edge piece into facing the other one and slide it on. Now heres
        the hard part: Take your selected corner, and slide it over the 2
        squared edge pieces. Notw push and pull it over the heart shaped edge
        until it "pops" into place. You cube should now work fine!! Good luck!
        Tell me how it goes. Peter Greenwood --- In

        take it you've already put in a 6 (that part is easy). To give you more

        Hey guys, I just got back from Hilversum, where I had to record that
        video. The cameraman and the director were very nice, so we had a good
        time shooting the video. I got there about an hour early, so got to meet
        some people who were working at the studio. After having a nice cup of
        coffee and doing a little chatting with those guys, I showed them a few
        nice and fluent sub17 solves. They all liked it very much. (And someone
        mentiond: "I used to peel of the stickers!!). After that they showed my
        around the studio, and told me a bit more about what the video should
        look like. It's gonna be just a small 1-minute video. The company is
        called 'Deloitte', and I understand that's it's a worldwide company,
        with people working in like... every country in the world :). The video
        is going to be shown on a big meeting/congress with shareholders. So,
        after doing a few warm up solves, we recorded some solves from different
        angle, while standing still, and a few while rotating around on a
        platform. We also did a lot of different other shots (close up on my
        eyes, showing off the solved cube, picking up the scrambled cube,
        putting down a solved cube etc.), it took about 1.5 hours I think. The
        director promised me they are gonna edit the whole thing until it looks
        perfect, so I expect it to look very cool.. They are gonna send me a DVD
        with the whole movie on it when they finish it, so I'll try to upload it
        to my site. They also gave me a brand new anniversery cube, because they
        didn't need that one anymore.. And they promised a nice 'payment', which
        I am gonna need if I want to have fun in Florida. AND... The director
        told me he could get me in touch with the marketing guys from Deloitte..
        If they like the video, maybe they want to sponser me for the WC..
        (Well, don't really expect that to happen, but it's worth a shot!). So..
        I'll tell you guys when I got the video, Cya! Jo√´l. --- In

        'Deloitte', and I understand that's it's a worldwide company, with
        people working in like... every country in the world :). The video is
        going to be shown on a big meeting/congress with shareholders. So, after
        doing a few warm up solves, we recorded some solves from different
        angle, while standing still, and a few while rotating around on a
        platform. We also did a lot of different other shots (close up on my
        eyes, showing off the solved cube, picking up the scrambled cube,
        putting down a solved cube etc.), it took about 1.5 hours I think. The
        director promised me they are gonna edit the whole thing until it looks
        perfect, so I expect it to look very cool.. They are gonna send me a DVD
        with the whole movie on it when they finish it, so I'll try to upload it
        to my site. They also gave me a brand new anniversery cube, because they
        didn't need that one anymore.. And they promised a nice 'payment', which
        I am gonna need if I want to have fun in Florida. AND... The director
        told me he could get me in touch with the marketing guys from Deloitte..
        If they like the video, maybe they want to sponser me for the WC..
        (Well, don't really expect that to happen, but it's worth a shot!). So..
        I'll tell you guys when I got the video, Cya! Jo√´l. --- In

        &gt; &gt; Hey guys, &gt; &gt; I just got back from Hilversum, where I
        had to record that video. &gt; The cameraman and the director were very
        nice, so we had a good time &gt; shooting the video. &gt; &gt; I got
        there about an hour early, so got to meet some people who were &gt;
        working at the studio. After having a nice cup of coffee and doing a
        &gt; little chatting with those guys, I showed them a few nice and
        fluent &gt; sub17 solves. They all liked it very much. (And someone
        mentiond: "I &gt; used to peel of the stickers!!). After that they
        showed my around &gt; the studio, and told me a bit more about what the
        video should look &gt; like. It's gonna be just a small 1-minute video.
        The company is &gt; called 'Deloitte', and I understand that's it's a

        The way to determine the needed scramble number would seem to be to
        determine the average number of moves required by a perfect solver for
        each number of scramble moves. That is, scramble 18 moves and solve it
        in Cube Explorer 20 times and compute the average solve length. Do the
        same for 19, 20 etc, until the average stops increasing. That is the
        number of NEEDED to do a full scramble. That would actually be
        interesting to see from 1 - 25 for other reasons. /Lars On Aug 30, 2005,

        gap of 3-4 days in between as i had gotten sick, and when today i took
        the cube again, i had a unseccusful solve for the first time but the
        second time when i opened my eyes there it was the solved cube...i was
        never so happy to see a solved cube before ! I made a mistaske in the
        last part doing a R while permuting the edges...then when i realised it
        i had to undo the moves and do it again, i was so tensed. Anyway i would
        like to say a lot of thanks to Tyson and Macky for their BLD tutorials.
        It was quite a journey learning the BLD solution(though typo errors in
        Tyson's document made it more like an adventure ;) ) Bye then. Happy
        (BLD) Cubing.

        number would seem to be to &gt; determine the average number of moves
        required by a perfect solver for &gt; each number of scramble moves.
        That's fine for the 3x3x3, Square-1, etc, where we have optimal solvers.
        Unfortunately, we do NOT have optimal solvers for 4x4x4, 5x5x5 and the
        megaminx, which is why I was wondering how you could estimate the
        necessary scramble lengths independently. Taking the 3x3x3 as an
        example, the minimum d from "my" criterion would be 18, which is
        comparable with the median number of turns (about 18) actually needed to
        solve random cubes optimally. Of course, you then have to add a few more
        turns to this d to stand a chance of sampling the "deepest"
        configurations... But my question is still: How were the WCA scramble
        lengths /actually/ determined? Mike

        &gt; &gt; Last week, this Sudoku was posted in this group: &gt; &gt; It

        [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] Hi Bram, I too
        have become interesting in sudoku lately, and have found this program:
        http://www.angusj.com/sudoku/index.php It is very handy if you get stuck
        on a puzzle. It will tell you what to do to solve it step by step. I
        have also saved you some time by making the file you need to open for
        that puzzle: http://www.geocities.com/pjgat09/bramsudoku.zip Install the
        program (you will like it alot), then unzip the file in the second link,
        and save it in a folder somewhere. Then open it with the program. When
        you have opened it, heres how it can show you how to solve it step by
        step: Click on View-Hint. It will show you a hint, and tell you at the
        bottom why it is. Then click View-Solve Next Step. This will use the
        hint to get the puzzle closer to solved. I hope this helped!! Peter

        in too many diagrams as it takes up a lot of space but here is the full
        solution - at least the one I came up with. Probably there are several.
        The crucial bit here wasdtep 27. I hadn't used anything like that
        before: basically if you get a pattern of possibilities ab ac ab bc as
        in this case (crucially, although they lie in 3 different columns they
        do lie in only 2 rows and in only 2 boxes) then because the two on the
        right lie in the same box they can't both be c. Thus the two on the left
        can't be a and b (a above b) so must be b and a (b above a). That allows
        for 1 and 3 to be determined and without guessing because they follow
        this logical pattern (above). Other than that the most difficult stages
        are probably 2 and 3 to get a start. 2. isn't really so bad - it's just
        observing that the triple 4,7,8 can only appear in 3 squares (so
        splitting C9 into 2 subsets) whence 7 can be placed straightaway (this
        step can be done first but is less obvious than step 1.). 3. is a bit
        technical too but I think 27. is the key stage. It relies on spotting a
        triple in 4 squares that do not lie all in the same column, row or box.
        NB You can also solve the same initial puzzle except with a 7 in the
        middle instead of a 4. It is quite similar. 1. The intersection of R1
        and C3 contains 6 (it is the only square in B1 that can contain a 6). 2.
        In C9, 4,7 and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9, leaving only the intersections
        with R1, R5 and R6. In particular, R5 already contains 4 and 8 so the
        intersection of C9 and R5 must contain 7. Initial Grid: *2*|***|***
        ***|6**|**3 *74|*8*|*** ------------------ ***|**3|**2 *8*|*4*|*1*
        6**|5**|*** ------------------ ***|*1*|78* 5**|**9|*** ***|***|*4* For
        convenience label rows R1 to R9 (downwards), columns C1-C9 (left to
        right), boxes B1-B9 (right then down). 1. The intersection of R1 and C3
        contains 6 (it is the only square in B1 that can contain a 6). 2. In C9,
        4,7 and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9, leaving only the intersections with
        R1, R5 and R6. In particular, R5 already contains 4 and 8 so the
        intersection of C9 and R5 must contain 7. 3. In B5, 1 and 8 must appear
        on the leading diagonal as they are already present in C5 and R5. Thus
        since 7 is in R5, 7 must occur in the intersection of B5 and C5. In
        particular in C5, 4,7 and 8 appear before B8. Thus in R8 4,7,8 must
        occur in C2-C4 and hence 4 lies in the intersection of C2 and R8. 4.
        Thus in B4, 4 goes in the intersection of R4 and C1. 5. Thus in C1, 7
        must go in R9. 6. Recalling that in R8, C2-C4 contain 4,7 and 8, 8 must
        go in C3 (because B7 contains 4,7) and so 7 in C4. *26|***|***
        ***|6**|**3 *74|*8*|*** ------------------ 4**|**3|**2 *8*|*4*|*17
        6**|5**|*** ------------------ ***|*1*|78* 548|7*9|*** 7**|***|*4* 7. In
        C1, neither 1 nor 8 can go in R5 or R7 (because they both appear
        elsewhere in R5 and R7) so both must appear in B1 and further 3 doesn't
        appear in the intersection of R2 and B1 so in B1 3 must be in C1. That
        leaves 5 and 9 in the intersection of B1 and R2 which means that
        (recalling 7 is in the intersection of B5 and C5) the intersection of R2
        and C5 must be a 2. 8. Thus 2 must appear in the intersection of B5 and
        R5 (since 1,8 are on the leading diagonal of that box) and 2 can't
        appear in the intersection of C1 and R5. Since the intersection of C1
        and B1 contains 1,3 and 8 it follows that 2 must appear in the
        intersection of C1 and R7 and 9 in the intersection of C1 and R5. 9. In
        B4, 2 must appear in C3 but neither in R4 nor (because 2 appears in the
        intersection of B5 and R5) in R5, so 2 must appear in the intersection
        of C3 and R6. 10. Therefore in B4, 7 appears in the intersection of R4
        and C3. 11. So in B5, recalling 7 is in C5, 7 must occur in R6. 12. Now
        9 already appearing in R5 and 1,8 being on the leading diagonal of B5, 9
        must appear in B5 at the intersection of R4 and C5. 13. Again, 6 being
        already in C4 and R6, 6 must be in B5 at the intersection of C6 and R5.
        14. 2s being in B4 and B6, the only remaining place in R5 for a 2 is the
        intersection with B5, i.e. in C4. 15. In B4, 1 must fall in C2, hence 1
        must fall in C3 in B7, but not in R7 as we already have a 1 in R7. So 1
        must fall in R9 and C3 in B9. 16. Moreover, in B8, 2 must lie in C6 but
        not in R7 (hence in R9). 17. Again in B8, 8 can't appear in R7 or C5 so
        it must be in the intersection of C4 and R9. 18. Thus in B5 we have that
        1 lies in R4 and 8 lies in R6. 19. Now in B4, 1 lies in R6, 5 lies in
        R4, leaving 3 in R5. 20. In R4 8 can't lie in C8 and so must lie in C7,
        leaving 6 in C8 to complete R4. Also 5 completes R5. 21. Way back in 2,
        we figured that in C9, 4, 7 and 8 could lie only in R1, R5 and R6. From
        B6, we conclude that 4 must lie in the intersection of C9 and R6 and so
        8 in the intersection of C9 and R1. 22. Now in B1, 8 must lie in R2 and
        C1. 23. From 7., in B1 5 and 9 are in R2. Since also 5 is in C2 and B4,
        5 must lie in the intersection of B1 and C3 and 9 in the intersection of
        B1 and C2. 24. In C3, 9 must go in R7 (as that is all that remains in
        C3). 25. In R2 only 1,4 and 7 remain but in C8 both 1 and 4 are placed,
        so 7 lies in the intersection of R2 and C8. 26. Hence the final 7 must
        go in B2 in the intersection of R1 and C6. *26|**7|**8 895|62*|*73
        *74|*8*|*** ------------------ 457|193|862 983|246|517 612|578|**4
        ------------------ 2*9|*1*|78* 548|7*9|*** 7*1|8*2|*4* 27. The
        intersection of C5 and R1 is either 3 or 5. Similarly the intersection
        of C6 and R3 is either 1 or 5. Also in B1 the remaining numbers are 1
        and 3. Since 5 cannot occupy two places in B2 either the intersection of
        C5 and R1 is 3 or the intersection of C6 and R3 is 1. In the first case
        3 can't go into the intersection of R1 with B1 (so 1 goes there and 3 in
        the remaining space of B1) and in the second 1 can't go in the
        intersection of R3 with B1 (so 3 goes there and 1 in the remaining space
        of B1). Either way 1 goes in the intersection of R1 with B1 and 3 in the
        intersection of R3 with B1. 126|**7|**8 895|62*|*73 374|*8*|***
        ------------------ 457|193|862 983|246|517 612|578|**4
        ------------------ 2*9|*1*|78* 548|7*9|*** 7*1|8*2|*4* 28. In C4, only
        3, 4 and 9 remain to be filled but R3 already contains 3 and 4, so the
        intersection of C4 with R3 contains 9. 29. Thus 9 is not in the
        intersection of R3 and C9, so it is in the intersection of C9 and B9 but
        it isn't in R7 or R8 so it is at the intersection of C9 and R9. 30. This
        implies that in R9 5 lies in C5. 31. Thus in B9, 5 must occur in R7 and
        hence also in C9 and also in B8 6 must lie in C5 and so in R8. 32. So in
        R7, 6 must lie in C2, then in C2, 3 must lie in R9 and in R9 6 must lie
        in C7 and 3 is the only remaining number to be filled in C5. 33. In B8,
        3 must lie in C4 leaving 4 in C6. 34. 4 is the only thing left to go in
        C4, so in R2 4 must go in C7 leaving 1 in C6 to complete R2 and thus 5
        in R3 to complete B2. 35. In R1 5 must go in C8 and hence 9 in C7 to
        complete. Thus in R6 9 must go in C8 and so 3 in C7 to complete. 36. In
        C8, 3 must go in R8 leaving 2 in R3 to complete. Thus in C7 2 must go in
        R8 leaving 1 in R3 to complete. Thus in C9 1 must go in R3 leaving 2 in
        C8 to complete the puzzle. 126|437|958 895|621|473 374|985|231

        Tyson, can we assemble the cube such that we can tell the orientation of
        a popped piece? Or is this "cheating"? I'm sure this has been asked
        before, but to be honest I forget what or if we came to a conclusion.

        You may assemble the cube so that you can tell orientation. In fact, I
        think everyone should always sticker their cube in this manner. However,
        the spirit of the law allows you to feel for orientation during a BLD
        solve if you pop. You can't pop pieces out on purpose, feel for which
        way they belong in, and then stick them in. If anyone wants to try that,
        I'd be happy to race them. I'll give you a minute head start too. (I
        think trying to tell orientation that way would slow you down like mad.)

        [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] Hi Bram, I too
        have become interesting in sudoku lately, and have found this program:
        http://www.angusj.com/sudoku/index.php
        &lt;http://www.angusj.com/sudoku/index.php&gt; It is very handy if you
        get stuck on a puzzle. It will tell you what to do to solve it step by
        step. I have also saved you some time by making the file you need to
        open for that puzzle: http://www.geocities.com/pjgat09/bramsudoku.zip
        &lt;http://www.geocities.com/pjgat09/bramsudoku.zip&gt; Install the
        program (you will like it alot), then unzip the file in the second link,
        and save it in a folder somewhere. Then open it with the program. When
        you have opened it, heres how it can show you how to solve it step by
        step: Click on View-Hint. It will show you a hint, and tell you at the
        bottom why it is. Then click View-Solve Next Step. This will use the
        hint to get the puzzle closer to solved. I hope this helped!! Peter

        Thanks for the solution. It helped a lot with understanding the
        difficulties I was having with the puzzle. Combined with the program I
        got from pjgat09, I fully understand what to look for in my next really
        difficult Sudoku. Unfortunately only simple Sudoku puzzles are published
        here... :( -----Oorspronkelijk bericht----- Van:

        solve it. Can you please post the solution with explanation. &gt; It is
        a really difficult one... &gt; R1-R9, C1-C9 will denote the rows and
        columns and B1-B9 the boxes (in the order 123 456 789 ). I will not put
        in too many diagrams as it takes up a lot of space but here is the full
        solution - at least the one I came up with. Probably there are several.
        The crucial bit here wasdtep 27. I hadn't used anything like that
        before: basically if you get a pattern of possibilities ab ac ab bc as
        in this case (crucially, although they lie in 3 different columns they
        do lie in only 2 rows and in only 2 boxes) then because the two on the
        right lie in the same box they can't both be c. Thus the two on the left
        can't be a and b (a above b) so must be b and a (b above a). That allows
        for 1 and 3 to be determined and without guessing because they follow
        this logical pattern (above). Other than that the most difficult stages
        are probably 2 and 3 to get a start. 2. isn't really so bad - it's just
        observing that the triple 4,7,8 can only appear in 3 squares (so
        splitting C9 into 2 subsets) whence 7 can be placed straightaway (this
        step can be done first but is less obvious than step 1.). 3. is a bit
        technical too but I think 27. is the key stage. It relies on spotting a
        triple in 4 squares that do not lie all in the same column, row or box.
        NB You can also solve the same initial puzzle except with a 7 in the
        middle instead of a 4. It is quite similar. 1. The intersection of R1
        and C3 contains 6 (it is the only square in B1 that can contain a 6). 2.
        In C9, 4,7 and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9, leaving only the intersections
        with R1, R5 and R6. In particular, R5 already contains 4 and 8 so the
        intersection of C9 and R5 must contain 7. Initial Grid: *2*|***|***
        ***|6**|**3 *74|*8*|*** ------------------ ***|**3|**2 *8*|*4*|*1*
        6**|5**|*** ------------------ ***|*1*|78* 5**|**9|*** ***|***|*4* For
        convenience label rows R1 to R9 (downwards), columns C1-C9 (left to
        right), boxes B1-B9 (right then down). 1. The intersection of R1 and C3
        contains 6 (it is the only square in B1 that can contain a 6). 2. In C9,
        4,7 and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9, leaving only the intersections with
        R1, R5 and R6. In particular, R5 already contains 4 and 8 so the
        intersection of C9 and R5 must contain 7. 3. In B5, 1 and 8 must appear
        on the leading diagonal as they are already present in C5 and R5. Thus
        since 7 is in R5, 7 must occur in the intersection of B5 and C5. In
        particular in C5, 4,7 and 8 appear before B8. Thus in R8 4,7,8 must
        occur in C2-C4 and hence 4 lies in the intersection of C2 and R8. 4.
        Thus in B4, 4 goes in the intersection of R4 and C1. 5. Thus in C1, 7
        must go in R9. 6. Recalling that in R8, C2-C4 contain 4,7 and 8, 8 must
        go in C3 (because B7 contains 4,7) and so 7 in C4. *26|***|***
        ***|6**|**3 *74|*8*|*** ------------------ 4**|**3|**2 *8*|*4*|*17
        6**|5**|*** ------------------ ***|*1*|78* 548|7*9|*** 7**|***|*4* 7. In
        C1, neither 1 nor 8 can go in R5 or R7 (because they both appear
        elsewhere in R5 and R7) so both must appear in B1 and further 3 doesn't
        appear in the intersection of R2 and B1 so in B1 3 must be in C1. That
        leaves 5 and 9 in the intersection of B1 and R2 which means that
        (recalling 7 is in the intersection of B5 and C5) the intersection of R2
        and C5 must be a 2. 8. Thus 2 must appear in the intersection of B5 and
        R5 (since 1,8 are on the leading diagonal of that box) and 2 can't
        appear in the intersection of C1 and R5. Since the intersection of C1
        and B1 contains 1,3 and 8 it follows that 2 must appear in the
        intersection of C1 and R7 and 9 in the intersection of C1 and R5. 9. In
        B4, 2 must appear in C3 but neither in R4 nor (because 2 appears in the
        intersection of B5 and R5) in R5, so 2 must appear in the intersection
        of C3 and R6. 10. Therefore in B4, 7 appears in the intersection of R4
        and C3. 11. So in B5, recalling 7 is in C5, 7 must occur in R6. 12. Now
        9 already appearing in R5 and 1,8 being on the leading diagonal of B5, 9
        must appear in B5 at the intersection of R4 and C5. 13. Again, 6 being
        already in C4 and R6, 6 must be in B5 at the intersection of C6 and R5.
        14. 2s being in B4 and B6, the only remaining place in R5 for a 2 is the
        intersection with B5, i.e. in C4. 15. In B4, 1 must fall in C2, hence 1
        must fall in C3 in B7, but not in R7 as we already have a 1 in R7. So 1
        must fall in R9 and C3 in B9. 16. Moreover, in B8, 2 must lie in C6 but
        not in R7 (hence in R9). 17. Again in B8, 8 can't appear in R7 or C5 so
        it must be in the intersection of C4 and R9. 18. Thus in B5 we have that
        1 lies in R4 and 8 lies in R6. 19. Now in B4, 1 lies in R6, 5 lies in
        R4, leaving 3 in R5. 20. In R4 8 can't lie in C8 and so must lie in C7,
        leaving 6 in C8 to complete R4. Also 5 completes R5. 21. Way back in 2,
        we figured that in C9, 4, 7 and 8 could lie only in R1, R5 and R6. From
        B6, we conclude that 4 must lie in the intersection of C9 and R6 and so
        8 in the intersection of C9 and R1. 22. Now in B1, 8 must lie in R2 and
        C1. 23. From 7., in B1 5 and 9 are in R2. Since also 5 is in C2 and B4,
        5 must lie in the intersection of B1 and C3 and 9 in the intersection of
        B1 and C2. 24. In C3, 9 must go in R7 (as that is all that remains in
        C3). 25. In R2 only 1,4 and 7 remain but in C8 both 1 and 4 are placed,
        so 7 lies in the intersection of R2 and C8. 26. Hence the final 7 must
        go in B2 in the intersection of R1 and C6. *26|**7|**8 895|62*|*73
        *74|*8*|*** ------------------ 457|193|862 983|246|517 612|578|**4
        ------------------ 2*9|*1*|78* 548|7*9|*** 7*1|8*2|*4* 27. The
        intersection of C5 and R1 is either 3 or 5. Similarly the intersection
        of C6 and R3 is either 1 or 5. Also in B1 the remaining numbers are 1
        and 3. Since 5 cannot occupy two places in B2 either the intersection of
        C5 and R1 is 3 or the intersection of C6 and R3 is 1. In the first case
        3 can't go into the intersection of R1 with B1 (so 1 goes there and 3 in
        the remaining space of B1) and in the second 1 can't go in the
        intersection of R3 with B1 (so 3 goes there and 1 in the remaining space
        of B1). Either way 1 goes in the intersection of R1 with B1 and 3 in the
        intersection of R3 with B1. 126|**7|**8 895|62*|*73 374|*8*|***
        ------------------ 457|193|862 983|246|517 612|578|**4
        ------------------ 2*9|*1*|78* 548|7*9|*** 7*1|8*2|*4* 28. In C4, only
        3, 4 and 9 remain to be filled but R3 already contains 3 and 4, so the
        intersection of C4 with R3 contains 9. 29. Thus 9 is not in the
        intersection of R3 and C9, so it is in the intersection of C9 and B9 but
        it isn't in R7 or R8 so it is at the intersection of C9 and R9. 30. This
        implies that in R9 5 lies in C5. 31. Thus in B9, 5 must occur in R7 and
        hence also in C9 and also in B8 6 must lie in C5 and so in R8. 32. So in
        R7, 6 must lie in C2, then in C2, 3 must lie in R9 and in R9 6 must lie
        in C7 and 3 is the only remaining number to be filled in C5. 33. In B8,
        3 must lie in C4 leaving 4 in C6. 34. 4 is the only thing left to go in
        C4, so in R2 4 must go in C7 leaving 1 in C6 to complete R2 and thus 5
        in R3 to complete B2. 35. In R1 5 must go in C8 and hence 9 in C7 to
        complete. Thus in R6 9 must go in C8 and so 3 in C7 to complete. 36. In
        C8, 3 must go in R8 leaving 2 in R3 to complete. Thus in C7 2 must go in
        R8 leaving 1 in R3 to complete. Thus in C9 1 must go in R3 leaving 2 in
        C8 to complete the puzzle. 126|437|958 895|621|473 374|985|231

        I have a couple knock-off cheap versions from Taiwan. My brother and I
        got into it awhile back but we could only judge 'speed' by the pitch
        that the powerball was making. I can totally see myself getting obsessed
        given that these models now give you actual rpm numbers. It's kinda like
        running or whatever... I dunno, maybe I think I've just got problems
        with being too competitive. If I go out for a normal run, it's all nice
        and happy. If I'm on a track, I have the sudden urge to time myself.

        about 6 days for me to learn it completely..there was a gap of &gt; 3-4
        days in between as i had gotten sick, and when today i took the &gt;

        second time when i opened my eyes there it was the solved cube...i was
        &gt; never so happy to see a solved cube before ! &gt; &gt; I made a

        again, i was so tensed. &gt; &gt; Anyway i would like to say a lot of
        thanks to Tyson and Macky for &gt; their BLD tutorials. It was quite a
        journey learning the BLD &gt; solution(though typo errors in Tyson's
        document made it more like an &gt; adventure ;) ) &gt; &gt; Bye then.
        &gt; Happy (BLD) Cubing. Congratz, Sachin! I'm learning BLD too, but I'm
        having some troubles with edge permutation...sometimes I flip the

        Hi Bram, If you look in the program that i showed you inder File-Creat
        New, you can make 5 different levels of difficult puzzles. Each is a few
        steps up from the previous one, with like 2-3 more techniques you will
        need. The methods are all included in the help file, so if you dont
        understand, you can just check there. Have fun and good luck! Peter

        &gt; Still did not solve it. Can you please post the solution with
        explanation. &gt; &gt; It is a really difficult one... &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; R1-R9, C1-C9 will denote the rows and columns and B1-B9 the boxes
        (in the &gt; order &gt; &gt; 123 &gt; 456 &gt; 789 &gt; ). &gt; &gt; I
        will not put in too many diagrams as it takes up a lot of space but here
        &gt; is the full solution &gt; - at least the one I came up with.
        Probably there are several. The crucial &gt; bit here wasdtep &gt; 27. I
        hadn't used anything like that before: &gt; &gt; basically if you get a
        pattern of possibilities &gt; &gt; ab ac &gt; &gt; ab bc &gt; &gt; as in
        this case (crucially, although they lie in 3 different columns they do
        &gt; lie in only 2 rows &gt; and in only 2 boxes) then because the two
        on the right lie in the same box &gt; they can't both &gt; be c. Thus
        the two on the left can't be a and b (a above b) so must be b and &gt; a
        (b above a). &gt; That allows for 1 and 3 to be determined and without
        guessing because they &gt; follow this &gt; logical pattern (above).
        Other than that the most difficult stages are &gt; probably 2 and 3 to
        &gt; get a start. 2. isn't really so bad - it's just observing that the
        triple &gt; 4,7,8 can only appear in &gt; 3 squares (so splitting C9
        into 2 subsets) whence 7 can be placed &gt; straightaway (this step &gt;
        can be done first but is less obvious than step 1.). &gt; 3. is a bit
        technical too but I think 27. is the key stage. It relies on &gt;
        spotting a triple in 4 &gt; squares that do not lie all in the same
        column, row or box. &gt; NB You can also solve the same initial puzzle
        except with a 7 in the middle &gt; instead of a 4. &gt; It is quite
        similar. &gt; &gt; 1. The intersection of R1 and C3 contains 6 (it is
        the only square in B1 &gt; that can contain a &gt; 6). &gt; 2. In C9,
        4,7 and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9, leaving only the intersections &gt;
        with R1, R5 and &gt; R6. In particular, R5 already contains 4 and 8 so
        the intersection of C9 and &gt; R5 must &gt; contain 7. &gt; Initial
        Grid: &gt; &gt; *2*|***|*** &gt; ***|6**|**3 &gt; *74|*8*|*** &gt;
        ------------------ &gt; ***|**3|**2 &gt; *8*|*4*|*1* &gt; 6**|5**|***
        &gt; ------------------ &gt; ***|*1*|78* &gt; 5**|**9|*** &gt;
        ***|***|*4* &gt; &gt; For convenience label rows R1 to R9 (downwards),
        columns C1-C9 (left to &gt; right), boxes &gt; B1-B9 (right then down).
        &gt; &gt; 1. The intersection of R1 and C3 contains 6 (it is the only
        square in B1 &gt; that can contain a &gt; 6). &gt; &gt; 2. In C9, 4,7
        and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9, leaving only the intersections &gt; with
        R1, R5 and &gt; R6. In particular, R5 already contains 4 and 8 so the
        intersection of C9 and &gt; R5 must &gt; contain 7. &gt; &gt; 3. In B5,
        1 and 8 must appear on the leading diagonal as they are already &gt;
        present in C5 &gt; and R5. Thus since 7 is in R5, 7 must occur in the
        intersection of B5 and &gt; C5. In particular &gt; in C5, 4,7 and 8
        appear before B8. Thus in R8 4,7,8 must occur in C2-C4 and &gt; hence 4
        lies &gt; in the intersection of C2 and R8. &gt; &gt; 4. Thus in B4, 4
        goes in the intersection of R4 and C1. &gt; &gt; 5. Thus in C1, 7 must
        go in R9. &gt; &gt; 6. Recalling that in R8, C2-C4 contain 4,7 and 8, 8
        must go in C3 (because &gt; B7 contains &gt; 4,7) and so 7 in C4. &gt;
        &gt; *26|***|*** &gt; ***|6**|**3 &gt; *74|*8*|*** &gt;
        ------------------ &gt; 4**|**3|**2 &gt; *8*|*4*|*17 &gt; 6**|5**|***
        &gt; ------------------ &gt; ***|*1*|78* &gt; 548|7*9|*** &gt;
        7**|***|*4* &gt; &gt; 7. In C1, neither 1 nor 8 can go in R5 or R7
        (because they both appear &gt; elsewhere in R5 and &gt; R7) so both must
        appear in B1 and further 3 doesn't appear in the &gt; intersection of R2
        and &gt; B1 so in B1 3 must be in C1. That leaves 5 and 9 in the
        intersection of B1 &gt; and R2 which &gt; means that (recalling 7 is in
        the intersection of B5 and C5) the &gt; intersection of R2 and C5 &gt;
        must be a 2. &gt; &gt; 8. Thus 2 must appear in the intersection of B5
        and R5 (since 1,8 are on the &gt; leading &gt; diagonal of that box) and
        2 can't appear in the intersection of C1 and R5. &gt; Since the &gt;
        intersection of C1 and B1 contains 1,3 and 8 it follows that 2 must
        appear &gt; in the &gt; intersection of C1 and R7 and 9 in the
        intersection of C1 and R5. &gt; &gt; 9. In B4, 2 must appear in C3 but
        neither in R4 nor (because 2 appears in &gt; the intersection &gt; of B5
        and R5) in R5, so 2 must appear in the intersection of C3 and R6. &gt;
        &gt; 10. Therefore in B4, 7 appears in the intersection of R4 and C3.
        &gt; &gt; 11. So in B5, recalling 7 is in C5, 7 must occur in R6. &gt;
        &gt; 12. Now 9 already appearing in R5 and 1,8 being on the leading
        diagonal of &gt; B5, 9 must &gt; appear in B5 at the intersection of R4
        and C5. &gt; &gt; 13. Again, 6 being already in C4 and R6, 6 must be in
        B5 at the intersection &gt; of C6 and R5. &gt; &gt; 14. 2s being in B4
        and B6, the only remaining place in R5 for a 2 is the &gt; intersection
        with &gt; B5, i.e. in C4. &gt; &gt; 15. In B4, 1 must fall in C2, hence
        1 must fall in C3 in B7, but not in R7 &gt; as we already have &gt; a 1
        in R7. So 1 must fall in R9 and C3 in B9. &gt; &gt; 16. Moreover, in B8,
        2 must lie in C6 but not in R7 (hence in R9). &gt; &gt; 17. Again in B8,
        8 can't appear in R7 or C5 so it must be in the &gt; intersection of C4
        and R9. &gt; &gt; 18. Thus in B5 we have that 1 lies in R4 and 8 lies in
        R6. &gt; &gt; 19. Now in B4, 1 lies in R6, 5 lies in R4, leaving 3 in
        R5. &gt; &gt; 20. In R4 8 can't lie in C8 and so must lie in C7, leaving
        6 in C8 to &gt; complete R4. Also 5 &gt; completes R5. &gt; &gt; 21. Way
        back in 2, we figured that in C9, 4, 7 and 8 could lie only in R1, &gt;
        R5 and R6. From &gt; B6, we conclude that 4 must lie in the intersection
        of C9 and R6 and so 8 in &gt; the &gt; intersection of C9 and R1. &gt;
        &gt; 22. Now in B1, 8 must lie in R2 and C1. &gt; &gt; 23. From 7., in
        B1 5 and 9 are in R2. Since also 5 is in C2 and B4, 5 must &gt; lie in
        the &gt; intersection of B1 and C3 and 9 in the intersection of B1 and
        C2. &gt; &gt; 24. In C3, 9 must go in R7 (as that is all that remains in
        C3). &gt; &gt; 25. In R2 only 1,4 and 7 remain but in C8 both 1 and 4
        are placed, so 7 lies &gt; in the &gt; intersection of R2 and C8. &gt;
        &gt; 26. Hence the final 7 must go in B2 in the intersection of R1 and
        C6. &gt; &gt; *26|**7|**8 &gt; 895|62*|*73 &gt; *74|*8*|*** &gt;
        ------------------ &gt; 457|193|862 &gt; 983|246|517 &gt; 612|578|**4
        &gt; ------------------ &gt; 2*9|*1*|78* &gt; 548|7*9|*** &gt;
        7*1|8*2|*4* &gt; &gt; 27. The intersection of C5 and R1 is either 3 or
        5. Similarly the &gt; intersection of C6 and R3 &gt; is either 1 or 5.
        Also in B1 the remaining numbers are 1 and 3. Since 5 &gt; cannot occupy
        two &gt; places in B2 either the intersection of C5 and R1 is 3 or the
        intersection &gt; of C6 and R3 is 1. &gt; In the first case 3 can't go
        into the intersection of R1 with B1 (so 1 goes &gt; there and 3 in the
        &gt; remaining space of B1) and in the second 1 can't go in the
        intersection of &gt; R3 with B1 (so 3 &gt; goes there and 1 in the
        remaining space of B1). Either way 1 goes in the &gt; intersection of R1
        &gt; with B1 and 3 in the intersection of R3 with B1. &gt; &gt;
        126|**7|**8 &gt; 895|62*|*73 &gt; 374|*8*|*** &gt; ------------------
        &gt; 457|193|862 &gt; 983|246|517 &gt; 612|578|**4 &gt;
        ------------------ &gt; 2*9|*1*|78* &gt; 548|7*9|*** &gt; 7*1|8*2|*4*
        &gt; &gt; 28. In C4, only 3, 4 and 9 remain to be filled but R3 already
        contains 3 and &gt; 4, so the &gt; intersection of C4 with R3 contains
        9. &gt; &gt; 29. Thus 9 is not in the intersection of R3 and C9, so it
        is in the &gt; intersection of C9 and B9 &gt; but it isn't in R7 or R8
        so it is at the intersection of C9 and R9. &gt; &gt; 30. This implies
        that in R9 5 lies in C5. &gt; &gt; 31. Thus in B9, 5 must occur in R7
        and hence also in C9 and also in B8 6 &gt; must lie in C5 &gt; and so in
        R8. &gt; &gt; 32. So in R7, 6 must lie in C2, then in C2, 3 must lie in
        R9 and in R9 6 &gt; must lie in C7 and 3 &gt; is the only remaining
        number to be filled in C5. &gt; &gt; 33. In B8, 3 must lie in C4 leaving
        4 in C6. &gt; &gt; 34. 4 is the only thing left to go in C4, so in R2 4
        must go in C7 leaving 1 &gt; in C6 to &gt; complete R2 and thus 5 in R3
        to complete B2. &gt; &gt; 35. In R1 5 must go in C8 and hence 9 in C7 to
        complete. Thus in R6 9 must &gt; go in C8 and &gt; so 3 in C7 to
        complete. &gt; &gt; 36. In C8, 3 must go in R8 leaving 2 in R3 to
        complete. Thus in C7 2 must go &gt; in R8 leaving &gt; 1 in R3 to
        complete. Thus in C9 1 must go in R3 leaving 2 in C8 to complete &gt;
        the puzzle. &gt; &gt; &gt; 126|437|958 &gt; 895|621|473 &gt; 374|985|231

        Greetings, Our newest cube demo (ver 0.03.0007) includes (among other
        changes) supercube versions for every puzzle size! It is available now
        on our website (http://www.gabbasoft.com). Although not originally
        something we had considered doing, you online cubers have been so
        wonderful about sharing your ideas and comments with us that we wanted
        to make something just for you: the only folks we know that might not
        cry at the thought of solving a 20x20x20 supercube. We also increased
        the range of the timer and move counters to accomodate the larger cube
        sizes. So enjoy and keep the suggestions coming!! Thanks again, Jamey

        I think I've found an error in the Posting about legal/illegal cubes. On
        the site that describes the tournament it says Rubik's 3x3x3, Rubik's
        4x4x4 and so on...but it does NOT say Rubik's 2x2x2 or Megaminx or
        Square-1, then it says "Only Rubik brand puzzles will be allowed for the
        Rubik's events." But it does not say the 2x2x2 is a Rubik's event, so
        therefore you can use an Eastsheen, according to those rules... Craig

        Hey guys, I did a lot of work today to improve my 'simple solution', the
        first tutorial on my site. A friend of mine solved it using that
        solution before, but he had some difficulties with some of the steps.
        Based on his comments, and also comments I got from other people, I
        rewrote the whole thing. It's still 'simple' (as in: it's does not
        require a lot of reading, centainly if you have a natural 'feeling' for
        cubing), but easier than before, IMHO. If you think I forgot to mention
        some tips, please give me feedback about that :). -Jo√´l.

        still swap some pieces, i think the colored band around the edge is the
        only way to make each piece unique, so there would be a box around every
        ever subsequent layer to the edge...or am i off my rocker ---

        Hi Jasmine, Wow, English train travellers are obviously nicer than Dutch
        commuters. When I cube in the train, most of the time people
        demonstratively move to a seat far away. Or they ask me to stop, because
        of the noise that cubing makes. Only once in a while people are
        interested or amazed. But then again, I am not a good looking lady like
        you. :-) Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message ----- From: jasmine_ellen

        2:20 AM Subject: [Speed cubing group] Cubing on the train I often cube
        on the train. Sometimes no one pays any attention, but sometimes they
        do. Tonight was definitely the later. A group of four girls sitting
        across from me let out audible gasps when I finished a solve. I like to
        take any opportunity to promote cubing, so if anyone shows any interest
        on the train (or anywhere!) I'll offer to do them another demo and ask
        them to do the scramble themselves (so they know it wasn't 'set up' and
        also to get them involved). I did a few more 3x3x3 demos for them and
        they were very impressed. Then I whipped out the 4x4x4 and got them to
        scramble that too. :) Later during the train trip, another group of
        people got on. They were pretty amazed ("Oh my goodness! Did you just
        solve that thing?!") and so I handed them my cube. I did several demos
        as various different people in train scrambled my cube. They timed one
        of the solves (32 seconds) and then I got an applause from half the
        train carriage. When the train was approaching the final stop, which was
        also my stop, there was one guy left from the group. He'd been further
        down the carriage and hadn't actually seen my solves, he'd just heard
        his friends talking ("Wow! She just solved that in 32 seconds!") So
        obviously I offered to do a demo for him. :) He was completely blown
        away and asked me what I did. He then asked me if I was looking for a
        job and gave me his contact details! BTW, I beat my PB single solve
        tonight too - 22.23 seconds. :) Jasmine http://speedcuber.blogspot.com

        European trains must be much quieter than the London Tube if the noise
        from a cube is disturbing people! The London Tube is very loud and bumpy
        - no one would ever even hear me cubing on the Tube. I was just in the
        US very briefly (flew back into London earlier today) and cubed on the
        train there too. One guy said he'd seen someone on TV do it blindfolded
        and behind their back and asked if I could do this. I said no, but that
        I knew people who could. I asked who he'd seen on TV doing this because
        I assumed it was probably someone from this group. He didn't remember
        the name though. Anyone done any blindfolded cubing on TV? Jasmine ---

        Cubing on the train &gt; &gt; &gt; I often cube on the train. Sometimes
        no one pays any attention, but &gt; sometimes they do. Tonight was
        definitely the later. A group of four &gt; girls sitting across from me
        let out audible gasps when I finished a &gt; solve. I like to take any
        opportunity to promote cubing, so if anyone &gt; shows any interest on
        the train (or anywhere!) I'll offer to do them &gt; another demo and ask
        them to do the scramble themselves (so they know &gt; it wasn't 'set up'
        and also to get them involved). I did a few more &gt; 3x3x3 demos for
        them and they were very impressed. Then I whipped out &gt; the 4x4x4 and
        got them to scramble that too. :) &gt; &gt; Later during the train trip,
        another group of people got on. They were &gt; pretty amazed ("Oh my
        goodness! Did you just solve that thing?!") and &gt; so I handed them my
        cube. I did several demos as various different &gt; people in train
        scrambled my cube. They timed one of the solves (32 &gt; seconds) and
        then I got an applause from half the train carriage. When &gt; the train
        was approaching the final stop, which was also my stop, &gt; there was
        one guy left from the group. He'd been further down the &gt; carriage
        and hadn't actually seen my solves, he'd just heard his &gt; friends
        talking ("Wow! She just solved that in 32 seconds!") So &gt; obviously I
        offered to do a demo for him. :) He was completely blown &gt; away and
        asked me what I did. He then asked me if I was looking for a &gt; job
        and gave me his contact details! &gt; &gt; BTW, I beat my PB single
        solve tonight too - 22.23 seconds. :) &gt; &gt; Jasmine &gt;

        Dan -- Great picture! and great concentration too - everyone else in the
        log looks very impressed. Perhaps it's time for "High-Profile Cubing" or
        "Extreme Cubing", where people share pictures of: - cubing with famous
        people (actors, politicians, sports figures, etc) Note that high-profile
        cubers don't count :-) - cubing in "extreme" places (landmarks,
        mountains, skydiving, rollercoasters, etc). See "Extreme Ironing"
        (www.extremeironing.com) for a comparison. Is the "photos" section of

        I used to use the Petrus Niklas and Sune to solve the 2x2x2. It works
        out okay because you don't have to worry about the edges permuting, of
        course. Since Petrus was the only method I knew to solve the 3x3x3 at
        the time, it was what I used. I recently learned the PLL algorithms so
        my approach to the 2x2x2 has changed to use those instead. A strict
        Petrus type approach to the 2x2x2 probably isn't ideal because a couple
        of the corner orientations require 2 Sunes or something in order to get
        the whole LL oriented. Probably faster to use a simple OLL algorithm and
        then a PLL. I suppose that you could learn the Sune orientations well
        enough to be able to do a 2 look LL on the 2x2x2 (1 for permutation, one
        for orientation) instead of the opposite approach. Still more turns
        though probably. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, Tyson

        Hey everyone, I have a question about sokoban puzzles (where you push
        boxes around into designated spots). My girlfriend recently gave me the
        link to this page http://www.addictinggames.com/ledix and of course I'm
        addicted to it :-) I'm almost done with it, there are 24 levels and I'm
        on #18. Anyway I had an idea, do they have team sokoban puzzles? Where
        you can control two characters to move the boxes around? It seems like
        you could make some really crazy puzzles like this. Like you could
        completely box in one guy to move boxes out of the way, then the boxed
        in guy would have to, at the right moment, start moving those 4 boxes
        around, stuff like that. Anyone know a simple way to make sokoban
        puzzles online? If no one has ever made pair sokoban puzzles then I'd
        love to try it and see if it works. Anyway, if there are any other
        sokoban fans, let me know if pair sokoban solving exists. I'm curious.

        this page &gt; http://www.addictinggames.com/ledix &gt; &gt; and of
        course I'm addicted to it :-) &gt; &gt; I'm almost done with it, there
        are 24 levels and I'm on #18. &gt; &gt; Anyway I had an idea, do they
        have team sokoban puzzles? Where you &gt; can control two characters to
        move the boxes around? &gt; &gt; It seems like you could make some
        really crazy puzzles like this. &gt; Like you could completely box in
        one guy to move boxes out of the way, &gt; then the boxed in guy would
        have to, at the right moment, start moving &gt; those 4 boxes around,
        stuff like that. &gt; &gt; Anyone know a simple way to make sokoban
        puzzles online? If no one &gt; has ever made pair sokoban puzzles then
        I'd love to try it and see if &gt; it works. &gt; &gt; Anyway, if there
        are any other sokoban fans, let me know if pair &gt; sokoban solving
        exists. I'm curious. &gt; &gt; Chris

        This happens to me too just about every time I have my 4x4x4 or 5x5x5
        out in public (which isn't as frequently as I have my 3x3x3 out!). It
        both astounds and annoys me that non-cubers have so much trouble telling
        the difference between a 5x5x5, a 4x4x4 and a 3x3x3. Until you put a
        3x3x3 next to it they don't even realise it's different puzzle! Grrr!
        Everyone notices that the 2x2x2 is a different puzzle though. People see
        the 2x2x2 and say "that looks easy, I reckon I can do that one!" To
        which I always reply "well, I challenge you then!" Of course, they NEVER
        can solve it. The 2x2x2 is only easy for a cuber. Jasmine

        As I mentioned in a recent post, I was in the US very briefly over the
        past few days. I met a guy from Dallas and he commented that there was
        'a big cube event' recently. This guy was not a cuber at all, so I asked
        him how he knew about this. He said it had been all over the news in
        Dallas! Just thought you'd be interested to know that the publicity for
        the Dallas event must have been pretty good as non-cubers knew about the

        But then he insisted it was a keychain one. Ever saw a keychain 4x4?

        I sat down earlier, just planning to do a couple of solves. I ended up
        doing an average of 100. The final average was 16.45 with a best rolling

        Hey everyone, I just did my second ever 50 cube average on the 4x4x4.
        The first time I was incredibly close to sub-1:10 and was kind of mad,
        so I did another one today and I made it! It was incredibly hard to stay
        concentrated. I was at about a 1:07.xx average after 30 solves, but
        after that point I totally lost my focus. I think with more practice
        sub-1:08 for 50 cubes should be possible. I thought about doing a 100
        cube average, but I think that would be a bit much for the 4x4, but
        maybe others have done it. Anyway I was very happy with this average and

        I remember quite a few years ago (maybe 3 or 4), I saw somebody doing
        the cube on one of the Network morning shows, like "Today". It seems
        like it was NBC, but I might be wrong. Anyone here know who it was? My
        guess would be Dan Knights, cause he was the only well known really fast
        cuber a few years ago, but I'm not sure. He got about a 20-24 second
        solve if I remember.

        I'm not really as fast as all of you guys, but I am always around 1
        minute for an average solve...The other day I was out golfing with my
        dad and his co-workers and after we had lunch and I pulled out my cube,
        which my mom once commented was like a soother cuz I never go anywheres
        without it, and then one guy was like, can you do it???Let me time you,
        and then he pulled out his watch and i went...and it was not the
        greatest solve of mine ever but it wasn't bad...and then when I was done
        he said it had taken me 3 minutes 21 seconds and I was
        like...no...that's not right...and he was like...yah...it is...and then
        he amazed me and solved it using a weird method, mainly intuitive...

        &gt; I just did my second ever 50 cube average on the 4x4x4. The first
        &gt; time I was incredibly close to sub-1:10 and was kind of mad, so I
        did &gt; another one today and I made it! &gt; &gt; It was incredibly
        hard to stay concentrated. I was at about a 1:07.xx &gt; average after
        30 solves, but after that point I totally lost my focus. &gt; I think
        with more practice sub-1:08 for 50 cubes should be possible. &gt; &gt; I
        thought about doing a 100 cube average, but I think that would be a &gt;
        bit much for the 4x4, but maybe others have done it. &gt; &gt; Anyway I

        I was at Dorney Park solving my cube and a guy decided to "time" me. He
        looked at his cell phone and it said 5:15 when I started. It said 5:16
        when I finished. His claim to his friends was "This guy can solve a cube
        in about a minute." The solve was probably closer to 1/3 of that. :( ~

        Well he *did* realize the difference, cause he insisted he had played
        with the 4x4, not the 3x3. But I'm quite sure he said so because the 4x4
        was the first he saw me with so he immediately thought that's what he
        had, too, and when I pulled out the 3x3 it looked different but at that
        point he was already convinced the 4x4 was what he had so he sticked to
        that. Stefan

        Puzzle question (sokoban) Hey everyone, I have a question about sokoban
        puzzles (where you push boxes around into designated spots). My
        girlfriend recently gave me the link to this page
        http://www.addictinggames.com/ledix
        &lt;http://www.addictinggames.com/ledix&gt; and of course I'm addicted
        to it :-) I'm almost done with it, there are 24 levels and I'm on #18.
        Anyway I had an idea, do they have team sokoban puzzles? Where you can
        control two characters to move the boxes around? It seems like you could
        make some really crazy puzzles like this. Like you could completely box
        in one guy to move boxes out of the way, then the boxed in guy would
        have to, at the right moment, start moving those 4 boxes around, stuff
        like that. Anyone know a simple way to make sokoban puzzles online? If
        no one has ever made pair sokoban puzzles then I'd love to try it and
        see if it works. Anyway, if there are any other sokoban fans, let me
        know if pair sokoban solving exists. I'm curious. Chris _____ YAHOO!

        Then again, your daughters also grew up around a cuber, as well as at a
        younger age, their thinking is more primitive so they go by Size and
        Weight, which there is a big difference in. Just my theory parth On

        Hi Tyson, You and/or Ron, in the role of representing WCA, need to take
        a professional stand on this: inform Guiness *formally* that they may no
        longer publish Rubik's cube records unless they adopt WCA standards and
        criteria. Do it politely but in an authoritative tone. Consider how the
        Olympic's governing body would write such a letter. Regards, David J
        I've been away for two weeks (and there have been 700 additional posts)
        and I've not read to the present time. Sorry if my suggestion is a
        repeat. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, Tyson Mao
        &lt;tmao@i...&gt; wrote: &gt; Hi Everyone, &gt; &gt; I was just
        thinking, right now, the Guinness Book of World Records &gt; recognizes
        16.53 seconds as the fastest solve. If you've seen the &gt; Guinness
        Book's criteria for a Rubik's speed solve attempt, it's quite &gt;
        interesting. They require two cubes new from the package and a lot of
        &gt; other odd things. &gt; &gt; Anyway, if no one breaks 12.11 in
        Florida, well, they will have a &gt; difficult time ignoring the WCA.
        After all, you can't claim a 12.5x &gt; time is the world record when a
        12.11 time was set on April 3, 2004. &gt; However, if someone does break
        12.11, I foresee the slight issue. &gt; Guinness will recognize this
        record as the world record, which would &gt; undermine the authority of
        all of the other competitions taking place. &gt; It will propagate the
        standard that only records achieved in a world &gt; championship are
        valid. &gt; &gt; I'm most likely not going to be the one in contention
        to break 12.11 &gt; seconds, but there are some of you out there that
        just might do it. In &gt; the event that the single speed solve record
        is broken (and us speed &gt; cubers know that 12.11 isn't nearly as
        important as 14.52), my &gt; suggestion is to not accept the Guinness
        recognition of holding the &gt; world record. Accepting their
        recognition would undermine the &gt; authority of all the tournament
        work that has happened in the last two &gt; years. Until Guinness is
        ready to accept the WCA's records as the &gt; world records, we really
        shouldn't help them out. &gt; &gt; And anyway, what's important? Having
        a record in the book which no one &gt; of any authority or knowledge
        recognizes, or having a record that is &gt; respected by the community?
        &gt; &gt; Anyway, these are just my initial impressions. Obviously, the
        most &gt; likely candidate that would have to deal with something like
        this is &gt; Macky, but 12.11 can be broken by anyone. I really hope
        that this &gt; e-mail doesn't spark an outrage in the community, and I
        don't foresee a &gt; heated debate and many flames. If I'm out of line,

        &gt; Thanks in advance, &gt; Chris I take them all out and hold them all
        as one ring with the metal parts on one place. Then I lube a towel piece
        and wipe along the strings, leaving out the metal parts. It also depends
        a lot on how you treat your Magic. Bob wrote he broke more than 60, I
        don't think I've broken more than 20 and not many in recent times. Ok,
        maybe he has practiced more. Also, I recently heard from Josef Jelinek
        (also very fast) that he only ever broke one string and another person
        was involved in that. So be nice to your Magic :-) Cheers! Stefan

        I was just thinking, right now, the Guinness Book &gt; of World Records
        &gt; &gt; recognizes 16.53 seconds as the fastest solve. If &gt; you've
        seen the &gt; &gt; Guinness Book's criteria for a Rubik's speed solve
        &gt; attempt, it's quite &gt; &gt; interesting. They require two cubes
        new from the &gt; package and a lot of &gt; &gt; other odd things. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, if no one breaks 12.11 in Florida, well, &gt;
        they will have a &gt; &gt; difficult time ignoring the WCA. After all,
        you &gt; can't claim a 12.5x &gt; &gt; time is the world record when a
        12.11 time was set &gt; on April 3, 2004. &gt; &gt; However, if someone
        does break 12.11, I foresee &gt; the slight issue. &gt; &gt; Guinness
        will recognize this record as the world &gt; record, which would &gt;
        &gt; undermine the authority of all of the other &gt; competitions
        taking place. &gt; &gt; It will propagate the standard that only records
        &gt; achieved in a world &gt; &gt; championship are valid. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I'm most likely not going to be the one in &gt; contention to
        break 12.11 &gt; &gt; seconds, but there are some of you out there that
        &gt; just might do it. In &gt; &gt; the event that the single speed
        solve record is &gt; broken (and us speed &gt; &gt; cubers know that
        12.11 isn't nearly as important &gt; as 14.52), my &gt; &gt; suggestion
        is to not accept the Guinness &gt; recognition of holding the &gt; &gt;
        world record. Accepting their recognition would &gt; undermine the &gt;
        &gt; authority of all the tournament work that has &gt; happened in the
        last two &gt; &gt; years. Until Guinness is ready to accept the &gt;
        WCA's records as the &gt; &gt; world records, we really shouldn't help
        them out. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And anyway, what's important? Having a
        record in &gt; the book which no one &gt; &gt; of any authority or
        knowledge recognizes, or &gt; having a record that is &gt; &gt;
        respected by the community? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, these are just
        my initial impressions. &gt; Obviously, the most &gt; &gt; likely
        candidate that would have to deal with &gt; something like this is &gt;
        &gt; Macky, but 12.11 can be broken by anyone. I &gt; really hope that
        this &gt; &gt; e-mail doesn't spark an outrage in the community, &gt;
        and I don't foresee a &gt; &gt; heated debate and many flames. If I'm
        out of &gt; line, please let me know, &gt; &gt; but I feel that
        Guinness' ignorance of 12.11 &gt; seconds shows disrespect &gt; &gt; for
        the work that I have done these last two years &gt; and undermine the
        &gt; &gt; work that all competition organizers have put in &gt; and so I
        submit to you &gt; &gt; not to acknowledge the Guinness Book of Records.

        Hi fellow cubers! It's been months since I've posted here or even read
        the messages. It's amazing to see how much the community has grown and
        how times have improved. The best average is now 13 seconds! and a sub20
        average would only place me 62 on the UWR list. I remember when I was
        36th(i think) with 20.96. Anyway, I've barely solved a cube in the last
        few months but I'm getting back into it now seeing that I only have 2
        months of practice left before the world championships. I took a couple
        averages. My first was 27.xx and my second 23.xx so I'm getting back to
        my old times but I still need to learn/relearn many algs and hopefully I
        will be sub20 before the champs. Just thought I'd drop by and say hi.
        I'm looking foward to finally meeting everyone in November. --barefoot

        and is there a particular place that people will be staying at in
        Florida? Hm..I see that someone changed my "major/interest" information

        I would definately say tiles - they never wear out and you have an
        advantage over stickers because tiles allow you to see the color around
        a corner easier. (e.g. if you look at a side square on, you will be able
        to see the 9 tiles around the edges since they have depth) Is there some
        place to get tiles that I don't know about??? Please do share.

        Yeah, I think it's really just a matter of personal preference. Myself,
        I like my cubesmith stickers and don't have any desire to change the
        feel of my cube. To barefoot Chris: As for durability, I've have had my
        stickers on my main speedcube for three months, and they show almost no
        signs of wear. Also, note that cubesmith tiles are very thin (.01") so
        the benefit of being able to see around corners would likely be minimal.

        Back to an old question - are tiles acceptable for competition solves?
        In particular are they allowed in the WC? I don't see why they shouldnt
        be but I'm very wary of the rules. Someone said they had asked whether
        non-official stickers could be used but I never saw the answer to that
        one. Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From: "Bryan Mytko"

        2005/9/3, Duncan Dicks &lt;duncan@...&gt;: &gt; Back to an old question
        - are tiles acceptable for competition solves? In &gt; particular are
        they allowed in the WC? &gt; I don't see why they shouldnt be but I'm
        very wary of the rules. Someone &gt; said they had asked whether
        non-official stickers could be used but I never &gt; saw the answer to
        that one. &gt; &gt; Duncan I asked that to Rubiks.com, they told me they
        would see with the WCA and then decide.Tyson and Ron (members of the
        WCA) told several tims here that unofficial stickers would be allowed.
        (I'm 99% sure of this, correct me if I'm wrong)

        Where are they chipping? Was that your cube I saw a picture of with the
        mini stackmat pad? It had my logo sticker in the middle but all the
        stickers around it were chipped up from the center cubie out. I'd be
        interested to find out why they're chipping. Chris www.cubesmith.com ---

        Hi Duncan, If you check the WCA regulations, you will find that there
        are regulations about the stickers, but none about the logos in the
        center or which trade mark. Competitions may have additional rules. For
        WC2005 the only additional rule is that the CUBES must be Rubik's. But
        the stickers don't need to be Rubik's. We are thinking about adding a
        sticker set to the WC2005 gift pack. Have fun, Ron ----- Original

        Stickers &gt; Hi Duncan, &gt; &gt; If you check the WCA regulations, you
        will find that there are regulations &gt; about the stickers, but none
        about the logos in the center or which trade &gt; mark. &gt; &gt;
        Competitions may have additional rules. For WC2005 the only additional
        &gt; rule is that the CUBES must be Rubik's. But the stickers don't need
        to be &gt; Rubik's. &gt; We are thinking about adding a sticker set to
        the WC2005 gift pack. &gt; &gt; Have fun, &gt; &gt; Ron &gt; &gt; -----

        Wow thanks a lot. Very thourgh explaination. #27 was the key for me,
        been stuck there for weeks. That type of logic seems to break a lot of
        solving programs or they'd have to resort to guessing. For the longest
        time I was convinced that it was not even possible to get pass this
        point without trial-and-error. -Doug --- In

        Still did not solve it. Can you please post the solution with
        explanation. &gt; &gt; It is a really difficult one... &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; R1-R9, C1-C9 will denote the rows and columns and B1-B9 the boxes
        (in the order &gt; &gt; 123 &gt; 456 &gt; 789 &gt; ). &gt; &gt; I will
        not put in too many diagrams as it takes up a lot of space but here is
        the full solution &gt; - at least the one I came up with. Probably there
        are several. The crucial bit here wasdtep &gt; 27. I hadn't used
        anything like that before: &gt; &gt; basically if you get a pattern of
        possibilities &gt; &gt; ab ac &gt; &gt; ab bc &gt; &gt; as in this case
        (crucially, although they lie in 3 different columns they do lie in only
        2 rows &gt; and in only 2 boxes) then because the two on the right lie
        in the same box they can't both &gt; be c. Thus the two on the left
        can't be a and b (a above b) so must be b and a (b above a). &gt; That
        allows for 1 and 3 to be determined and without guessing because they
        follow this &gt; logical pattern (above). Other than that the most
        difficult stages are probably 2 and 3 to &gt; get a start. 2. isn't
        really so bad - it's just observing that the triple 4,7,8 can only
        appear in &gt; 3 squares (so splitting C9 into 2 subsets) whence 7 can
        be placed straightaway (this step &gt; can be done first but is less
        obvious than step 1.). &gt; 3. is a bit technical too but I think 27. is
        the key stage. It relies on spotting a triple in 4 &gt; squares that do
        not lie all in the same column, row or box. &gt; NB You can also solve
        the same initial puzzle except with a 7 in the middle instead of a 4.
        &gt; It is quite similar. &gt; &gt; 1. The intersection of R1 and C3
        contains 6 (it is the only square in B1 that can contain a &gt; 6). &gt;
        2. In C9, 4,7 and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9, leaving only the
        intersections with R1, R5 and &gt; R6. In particular, R5 already
        contains 4 and 8 so the intersection of C9 and R5 must &gt; contain 7.
        &gt; Initial Grid: &gt; &gt; *2*|***|*** &gt; ***|6**|**3 &gt;
        *74|*8*|*** &gt; ------------------ &gt; ***|**3|**2 &gt; *8*|*4*|*1*
        &gt; 6**|5**|*** &gt; ------------------ &gt; ***|*1*|78* &gt;
        5**|**9|*** &gt; ***|***|*4* &gt; &gt; For convenience label rows R1 to
        R9 (downwards), columns C1-C9 (left to right), boxes &gt; B1-B9 (right
        then down). &gt; &gt; 1. The intersection of R1 and C3 contains 6 (it is
        the only square in B1 that can contain a &gt; 6). &gt; &gt; 2. In C9,
        4,7 and 8 cannot go into R3 or B9, leaving only the intersections with
        R1, R5 and &gt; R6. In particular, R5 already contains 4 and 8 so the
        intersection of C9 and R5 must &gt; contain 7. &gt; &gt; 3. In B5, 1 and
        8 must appear on the leading diagonal as they are already present in C5
        &gt; and R5. Thus since 7 is in R5, 7 must occur in the intersection of
        B5 and C5. In particular &gt; in C5, 4,7 and 8 appear before B8. Thus in
        R8 4,7,8 must occur in C2-C4 and hence 4 lies &gt; in the intersection
        of C2 and R8. &gt; &gt; 4. Thus in B4, 4 goes in the intersection of R4
        and C1. &gt; &gt; 5. Thus in C1, 7 must go in R9. &gt; &gt; 6. Recalling
        that in R8, C2-C4 contain 4,7 and 8, 8 must go in C3 (because B7
        contains &gt; 4,7) and so 7 in C4. &gt; &gt; *26|***|*** &gt;
        ***|6**|**3 &gt; *74|*8*|*** &gt; ------------------ &gt; 4**|**3|**2
        &gt; *8*|*4*|*17 &gt; 6**|5**|*** &gt; ------------------ &gt;
        ***|*1*|78* &gt; 548|7*9|*** &gt; 7**|***|*4* &gt; &gt; 7. In C1,
        neither 1 nor 8 can go in R5 or R7 (because they both appear elsewhere
        in R5 and &gt; R7) so both must appear in B1 and further 3 doesn't
        appear in the intersection of R2 and &gt; B1 so in B1 3 must be in C1.
        That leaves 5 and 9 in the intersection of B1 and R2 which &gt; means
        that (recalling 7 is in the intersection of B5 and C5) the intersection
        of R2 and C5 &gt; must be a 2. &gt; &gt; 8. Thus 2 must appear in the
        intersection of B5 and R5 (since 1,8 are on the leading &gt; diagonal of
        that box) and 2 can't appear in the intersection of C1 and R5. Since the
        &gt; intersection of C1 and B1 contains 1,3 and 8 it follows that 2 must
        appear in the &gt; intersection of C1 and R7 and 9 in the intersection
        of C1 and R5. &gt; &gt; 9. In B4, 2 must appear in C3 but neither in R4
        nor (because 2 appears in the intersection &gt; of B5 and R5) in R5, so
        2 must appear in the intersection of C3 and R6. &gt; &gt; 10. Therefore
        in B4, 7 appears in the intersection of R4 and C3. &gt; &gt; 11. So in
        B5, recalling 7 is in C5, 7 must occur in R6. &gt; &gt; 12. Now 9
        already appearing in R5 and 1,8 being on the leading diagonal of B5, 9
        must &gt; appear in B5 at the intersection of R4 and C5. &gt; &gt; 13.
        Again, 6 being already in C4 and R6, 6 must be in B5 at the intersection
        of C6 and R5. &gt; &gt; 14. 2s being in B4 and B6, the only remaining
        place in R5 for a 2 is the intersection with &gt; B5, i.e. in C4. &gt;
        &gt; 15. In B4, 1 must fall in C2, hence 1 must fall in C3 in B7, but
        not in R7 as we already have &gt; a 1 in R7. So 1 must fall in R9 and C3
        in B9. &gt; &gt; 16. Moreover, in B8, 2 must lie in C6 but not in R7
        (hence in R9). &gt; &gt; 17. Again in B8, 8 can't appear in R7 or C5 so
        it must be in the intersection of C4 and R9. &gt; &gt; 18. Thus in B5 we
        have that 1 lies in R4 and 8 lies in R6. &gt; &gt; 19. Now in B4, 1 lies
        in R6, 5 lies in R4, leaving 3 in R5. &gt; &gt; 20. In R4 8 can't lie in
        C8 and so must lie in C7, leaving 6 in C8 to complete R4. Also 5 &gt;
        completes R5. &gt; &gt; 21. Way back in 2, we figured that in C9, 4, 7
        and 8 could lie only in R1, R5 and R6. From &gt; B6, we conclude that 4
        must lie in the intersection of C9 and R6 and so 8 in the &gt;
        intersection of C9 and R1. &gt; &gt; 22. Now in B1, 8 must lie in R2 and
        C1. &gt; &gt; 23. From 7., in B1 5 and 9 are in R2. Since also 5 is in
        C2 and B4, 5 must lie in the &gt; intersection of B1 and C3 and 9 in the
        intersection of B1 and C2. &gt; &gt; 24. In C3, 9 must go in R7 (as that
        is all that remains in C3). &gt; &gt; 25. In R2 only 1,4 and 7 remain
        but in C8 both 1 and 4 are placed, so 7 lies in the &gt; intersection of
        R2 and C8. &gt; &gt; 26. Hence the final 7 must go in B2 in the
        intersection of R1 and C6. &gt; &gt; *26|**7|**8 &gt; 895|62*|*73 &gt;
        *74|*8*|*** &gt; ------------------ &gt; 457|193|862 &gt; 983|246|517
        &gt; 612|578|**4 &gt; ------------------ &gt; 2*9|*1*|78* &gt;
        548|7*9|*** &gt; 7*1|8*2|*4* &gt; &gt; 27. The intersection of C5 and R1
        is either 3 or 5. Similarly the intersection of C6 and R3 &gt; is either
        1 or 5. Also in B1 the remaining numbers are 1 and 3. Since 5 cannot
        occupy two &gt; places in B2 either the intersection of C5 and R1 is 3
        or the intersection of C6 and R3 is 1. &gt; In the first case 3 can't go
        into the intersection of R1 with B1 (so 1 goes there and 3 in the &gt;
        remaining space of B1) and in the second 1 can't go in the intersection
        of R3 with B1 (so 3 &gt; goes there and 1 in the remaining space of B1).
        Either way 1 goes in the intersection of R1 &gt; with B1 and 3 in the
        intersection of R3 with B1. &gt; &gt; 126|**7|**8 &gt; 895|62*|*73 &gt;
        374|*8*|*** &gt; ------------------ &gt; 457|193|862 &gt; 983|246|517
        &gt; 612|578|**4 &gt; ------------------ &gt; 2*9|*1*|78* &gt;
        548|7*9|*** &gt; 7*1|8*2|*4* &gt; &gt; 28. In C4, only 3, 4 and 9 remain
        to be filled but R3 already contains 3 and 4, so the &gt; intersection
        of C4 with R3 contains 9. &gt; &gt; 29. Thus 9 is not in the
        intersection of R3 and C9, so it is in the intersection of C9 and B9
        &gt; but it isn't in R7 or R8 so it is at the intersection of C9 and R9.
        &gt; &gt; 30. This implies that in R9 5 lies in C5. &gt; &gt; 31. Thus
        in B9, 5 must occur in R7 and hence also in C9 and also in B8 6 must lie
        in C5 &gt; and so in R8. &gt; &gt; 32. So in R7, 6 must lie in C2, then
        in C2, 3 must lie in R9 and in R9 6 must lie in C7 and 3 &gt; is the
        only remaining number to be filled in C5. &gt; &gt; 33. In B8, 3 must
        lie in C4 leaving 4 in C6. &gt; &gt; 34. 4 is the only thing left to go
        in C4, so in R2 4 must go in C7 leaving 1 in C6 to &gt; complete R2 and
        thus 5 in R3 to complete B2. &gt; &gt; 35. In R1 5 must go in C8 and
        hence 9 in C7 to complete. Thus in R6 9 must go in C8 and &gt; so 3 in
        C7 to complete. &gt; &gt; 36. In C8, 3 must go in R8 leaving 2 in R3 to
        complete. Thus in C7 2 must go in R8 leaving &gt; 1 in R3 to complete.
        Thus in C9 1 must go in R3 leaving 2 in C8 to complete the puzzle. &gt;

        Chris Hardwick is almost done updating a page with our F2L &gt; codes.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here are the first few codes. The F2L slot to
        be filled is &gt; always &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; placed in the FR spot.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is that page up yet, by any
        chance? I'm really interested in &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practicing with my
        friend, but we are terrible at the F2L, and &gt; I see &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; no reason to make up our own naming system, since you guys &gt;
        have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already done it. Who knows, maybe we'll get a
        chance to &gt; practice &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together sometime! &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; But I'll have to learn all the OLL algorithms first, &gt;

        I was noticing that the proliferation of posts to the group this weekend
        has not been as overwhelming as usual. Someone suggested to me that it
        might be because it's a long weekend in the US (Labor Day weekend?). If
        this is true then it means that &lt;shock! amazement!&gt; *sometimes*
        cubers might actually get out of the house and do other things! Surely
        not! :o Although, I guess that just because cubers aren't sitting in
        front of their computers doesn't mean they aren't cubing... Jasmine

        Hi there, I wanted to share my thoughts about the effect of public
        cubing. I'm "seriously" into speedcubing since late april (did BLD
        before). I'm usially averaging between 27 and 31 now, my personal best
        AVG10 being around 27.5. I'm mostly cubing in the metro, in Paris. This
        is the place where I make my best times. I'm 100% sure I am sub23 in the
        metro, where usually 2-3 people are glaring at the cube. I don't need to
        time myself : I KNOW that my F2L is way faster in the metro. Is that the
        effect of public cubing ? OK, then I'll talk about my times, in
        different contexts, in a decreasing order of efficiency. 1. REHEARSAL :
        I execute the same scrambling over and over. In that case, my times are
        between 17 and 20, depending on the OLL/PLL case mostly. It means that I
        lose about 10 secs on recognition. This is my "dexterity time". 2. METRO
        : I would say between 22 and 25 secs 3. BUS : between 27 and 31 4.
        TIMING MYSELF W/ NETCUBE : between 27 and 31 5. TAKING VIDEOS : between
        23 and 40 (!!!) 6. IN FRONT OF FRIENDS : between 28 and 38 (!!) There's
        something weird about the difference between "METRO" and "FRIENDS". I
        came up with this explanation : the parisian METRO is one of the MOST
        unpersonal place I know. People are never communicating. This is a DEAD
        place. So maybe, the only thing my brain can do is : "focus on the cube,
        and do nothing else". And it seems to work. The Bus is more convivial.
        You know that somebody may ask you questions about cubing. It happens
        often actually. It seems to disturb my concentration. Then "taking vids"
        or "timing" : I'm JUDGING MYSELF, so, I'm not 100% focused. Not to talk
        about friends... then if I run into a difficult case, it can become
        terrible. My (not so original) conclusion about this is : find a way to
        focus 100% on your cube, and forget about the environment. For some, it
        may help to train in their worst "conditions" (i.e. : in public). For
        others, it may help to change the conditions of performing, just in
        order to see how one can keep 100% of the concentrations on the moves
        and the anticipations. My best performances are in front of the DEAD
        public of the metro ;). I've never attended a competition so far. It
        might be my worst case scenario. See you in the next french open I
        hope... -- FD.

        I think I'd probably let a drunk competitor do a solve just so I could
        get it on video. It goes without saying, of course, that already, though
        it's not recommended, it's definitely not encouraged if you're under the
        age of 21. Now... with that said, trying to blindfold 5 cubes
        consecutively is MUCH easier if you haven't had anything. Tyson Mao MSC

        the effect of public &gt; cubing. &gt; &gt; I'm "seriously" into
        speedcubing since late april (did &gt; BLD before). I'm usially
        averaging between 27 and 31 now, &gt; my personal best AVG10 being
        around 27.5. &gt; &gt; I'm mostly cubing in the metro, in Paris. This is
        the place &gt; where I make my best times. I'm 100% sure I am sub23 in
        &gt; the metro, where usually 2-3 people are glaring at the &gt; cube. I
        don't need to time myself : I KNOW that my F2L is &gt; way faster in the
        metro. Is that the effect of public &gt; cubing ? &gt; &gt; OK, then
        I'll talk about my times, in different contexts, &gt; in a decreasing
        order of efficiency. &gt; &gt; 1. REHEARSAL : I execute the same
        scrambling over and over. &gt; In that case, my times are between 17 and
        20, depending &gt; on the OLL/PLL case mostly. It means that I lose
        about &gt; 10 secs on recognition. This is my "dexterity time". &gt;
        &gt; 2. METRO : I would say between 22 and 25 secs &gt; &gt; 3. BUS :
        between 27 and 31 &gt; &gt; 4. TIMING MYSELF W/ NETCUBE : between 27 and
        31 &gt; &gt; 5. TAKING VIDEOS : between 23 and 40 (!!!) &gt; &gt; 6. IN
        FRONT OF FRIENDS : between 28 and 38 (!!) &gt; &gt; There's something
        weird about the difference between "METRO" &gt; and "FRIENDS". I came up
        with this explanation : the parisian &gt; METRO is one of the MOST
        unpersonal place I know. People are &gt; never communicating. This is a
        DEAD place. So maybe, the only &gt; thing my brain can do is : "focus on
        the cube, and do nothing &gt; else". And it seems to work. &gt; &gt; The
        Bus is more convivial. You know that somebody may ask you &gt; questions
        about cubing. It happens often actually. It seems &gt; to disturb my
        concentration. &gt; &gt; Then "taking vids" or "timing" : I'm JUDGING
        MYSELF, so, I'm &gt; not 100% focused. Not to talk about friends... then
        if I run &gt; into a difficult case, it can become terrible. &gt; &gt;
        My (not so original) conclusion about this is : find a way &gt; to focus
        100% on your cube, and forget about the environment. &gt; For some, it
        may help to train in their worst "conditions" &gt; (i.e. : in public).
        &gt; For others, it may help to change the conditions of &gt;
        performing, just in order to see how one can keep 100% of &gt; the
        concentrations on the moves and the anticipations. &gt; &gt; My best
        performances are in front of the DEAD public of the &gt; metro ;). &gt;
        &gt; I've never attended a competition so far. It might be my &gt; worst
        case scenario. See you in the next french open I hope... &gt; -- &gt;

        yes that is the corrected version both me and Akimoto have been using
        this alg for several years, though I am faster with the inverse (both
        are needed in a more advanced CLL/ELL system) The reason why it appears
        wrong is probably because we both (I think, correct me if I'm wrong)
        execute it with LL on D, and so typing it out he must have accidently
        mirrored some of the turns instead of rotating them x2. It's done faster
        when LL is on D I think. I do it this way: FD'F'D'R2'U'LBL'UR2'
        Definately not one of my fastest CLL cases, but this is how I've been
        doing it: F (with right index downward) 4 quick progessions D' (with
        right thumb and middle finger) F' (with right thumb) D' (with right
        middle finger) R2' (sweep with many fingers on right hand) U' (right
        thumb) (rDr'U) (a quick trigger) R2' (sweep with many fingers on right
        hand) Thought I do it entirely as rapid progression of my right fingers,
        some might use their left index for U' turns, and I think I might have
        at some point changed to that and then reverted back (due to lack of
        practice). [I say rapid progression of turns because it's not something
        I would catergorize as a triggerable alg.] Hope that sheds some light on
        the mysterious land of CLL. -Doug (finally caught up on all the posts in

        I think most cubers don't understand the algorithms they use but just
        memorize them and execute them accordingly. But if you spend enough time
        thinking about an algorithm, then one may gain insite into how they
        actaully work, why they do what they do. Most algs we use are quite
        complicated and can't be disected into small parts that are
        understandable. Here is an example of one of the simplest PLL that I'm
        sure most ppl understand. The so-called "Allan" maneuver (old
        slice/non-2-gen version of the 3-edge cycle): R2 U F B' R2 F' B U R2 It
        can be understood as the sequence S' U2 S U2 conjugated with R2 U (or
        "conjugated by" in some literature). And it becomes the final alg with
        some cancellations. By conjugation I mean: if A=(R2 U) and B=(S' U2 S
        U2) then the final alg is A * B * A^(-1) after a bit of cancellation.
        Now the B in this case is easy enough to understand. B here is in fact
        in itself a commutator, and as we know from Group Theory, commutators
        tend to fix many indicies in subgroups of (finite) symmetric groups. A
        commutator is something of the form x*y*x^(-1)*y^(-1). It is easy to see
        why this reduces to the identity in commutative algebras (Abelian
        groups) and "does nothing". In "not-so-commutative groups" it is
        something that tends to be "close" to "doing nothing". A bit of trivia
        that even we as cubers typically don't know: Although there are
        12!*8!*2^11*3^7/2 possible positionsm, it is really 901083404981813616
        after modding out by rotational isomorphisms. (can be shown by the
        P√≥lya-Burnside lemma) The group is the semi-direct product of the
        orientation aspect of the cube and the permutation aspect. The
        orientations are isomorphic to the commutative group (Z_2)^11 "cross"
        (Z_3)^7. The permutation group is isomorphic to (A_8 cross A_12)
        semi-direct product with Z_2. (I have this memorized since I'm a math
        major and get asked this question A LOT.) To learn more about these more

        There are two ways of thinking about it. I for one learned the Fridrich
        method very early into my cubing career‚Äîabout 6 weeks after I first
        learned how to solve the cube. I didn't think the look at what the F2L
        algorithms did and so I executed the algorithms blindly. I knew if there
        was a case and I did a certain algorithm, I would get the result I
        wanted. Blind execution is the key for fast times. Understanding how the
        algorithms work can enhance what you can do to the cube, but being able
        to react to cases on a cube is necessary for very fast times. Tyson Mao

        &gt; Hey guys, &gt; &gt; So I got my first ever sub-30 average last
        night before going to &gt; sleep. It was amazing! I was looking ahead so
        much better than I &gt; normally do, and I'm not sure if it was because
        I was more tired than &gt; usual or not. &gt; &gt; I first solved a cube
        without any moves in front of me in May of 2002 &gt; (I have the exact
        date written somewhere), so this sub-30 average has &gt; taken me over 3
        years to accomplish. Hopefully I'll get some free &gt; time in the next
        few months to work on cubing, so my quest to sub-20 &gt; doesn't take as
        long as this did! &gt; &gt; Just thought I'd share :) &gt; &gt; -Chris

        If one memorizes the algorithms well enough, they would know it well
        enough to execute it one-handed. I know that for me, after spending so
        much time on algs... forgetting an alg and having to re-learn it
        repeatedly over the years, I can easily call out an alg letter-by-letter
        without touching the cube if I see a certain case for about 1/2 of my
        algs. I remember Ron was saying how he know's his algs so well that he
        doesn't get "one-handed amnesia" (as ChrisH calles it) as much as most
        of us do. So I don't think understanding algs would help with one-handed
        times either unfortunately. It's all down to practicing the same alg
        over and over one-handed until you can do most of your algs one-handed
        (nearly) as fluidly as with two hands. I just wanted to explain for
        people that haven't heard about how back in the old days before we could
        so readily plug cases into something like ACube, how cubist used to
        discover new algs for their systems. The use of commutators was
        something that JessicaF fondly remembers I'm sure (I think that's where
        I first read about it from). In fact I am currently up at 4:44am
        "understanding" various ZBF2L algs I have been learning. (After lying
        awake in bed for an hr... and realizing that today is going to be the
        first day of classes here.) Now, I believe that understanding algs is
        unavoidable as a cuber continues to learn new algs. This past few months
        I have begun to gain significant insight into the algs I use more so
        than ever before. It defiantely doesn't help my times of course;
        actually, it might have even hurt them, lol. After a certain point algs
        just "make sense". I'm talking about when a person learns hundreds of
        algs; probably around 2-3 times as many algs as in the basic Fridrich
        system (and now thanks the great devotion of cubers nowadays, messily
        even). Unless one has some super-human (long-term) memory going on, I
        don't see how to maintain all that information without
        realizing/understanding what's really going on amongst the algs... how
        they inter-relate to each other. I look at a new ZBLL and execute it a
        few times and think to myself how it's the first part of alg A (some
        irreducible alg I know) combined with the last part of alg B (another
        simple alg I already know). And this is how I remember it... and
        learning new algs just builds on top of older algs. For a lot of the
        simple algs I know, I understand how they work and so it is reasonable
        how combining one alg with another would behave. And after a while the
        pace of absorbing more algs becomes faster. A lot of us are very amazing
        and impressed with how many algs some of the cubers have learned I'm
        sure. But consider this. Isn't it now many times easier for them to
        learn one new alg in a given amount of time than for a cuber that only
        knows say the algs of the basic Fridrich system alone? Learning *and
        understanding* new algs is so fun! Right now I'm drawing a bunch of
        arrows on my ZBF2L diagram depicting how one cae reduces down to another
        after only a few turns (typically 3). (Imagine the sq-1 shapes diagram
        on Jaap's site, lol.) -Doug --- In

        Some algorithms are pretty basic and can be broken down into small
        simple steps. Understanding simple algs can help you learn them better
        and also helps you learn more of them. If you notice why some algs work,
        you can come up with more of them for similar cases. For example, a lot
        of OLL algs involve taking out a pair, flipping stuff, and putting the
        pair back differently in the same spot. Some of them hide a bunch of
        pieces, flip stuff, and then put the pieces back. I think this is what
        is meant by "understanding" algorithms. At least, it is how I interpret
        it. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Dwayne"

        &gt; Subject: Re: Understanding Algorithms &gt; &gt; I think most cubers
        don't understand the algorithms they use but just &gt; memorize them and
        execute them accordingly. &gt; &gt; But if you spend enough time
        thinking about an algorithm, then one may &gt; gain insite into how they
        actaully work, why they do what they do. &gt; &gt; Most algs we use are
        quite complicated and can't be disected into &gt; small parts that are
        understandable. &gt; &gt; Here is an example of one of the simplest PLL
        that I'm sure most ppl &gt; understand. The so-called "Allan" maneuver
        (old slice/non-2-gen &gt; version of the 3-edge cycle): &gt; &gt; R2 U F
        B' R2 F' B U R2 &gt; &gt; It can be understood as the sequence S' U2 S
        U2 conjugated with R2 U &gt; (or "conjugated with" in some literature).
        And it becomes the final &gt; alg with some cancellations. &gt; &gt; By
        conjugation I mean: if A=(R2 U) and B=(S' U2 S U2) then the final &gt;
        alg is A * B * A^(-1) after a bit of cancellation. &gt; &gt; Now the B
        in this case is easy enough to understand. B here is in fact &gt; in
        itself a commutator, and as we know from Group Theory, commutators &gt;
        tend to fix many indicies in subgroups of (finite) symmetric groups.
        &gt; &gt; A commutator is something of the form x*y*x^(-1)*y^(-1). It is
        easy to &gt; see why this reduces to the identity in commutative
        algebras (Abelian &gt; groups) and "does nothing". In
        "not-so-commutative groups" it is &gt; something that tends to be
        "close" to "doing nothing". &gt; &gt; A bit of trivia that even we as
        cubers typically don't know: &gt; &gt; Although there are
        12!*8!*2^11*3^7/2 possible positionsm, it is really &gt;
        901083404981813616 after modding out by rotational isomorphisms. (can
        &gt; be shown by the P√≥lya-Burnside lemma) &gt; &gt; The group is the
        semi-direct product of the orientation aspect of the &gt; cube and the
        permutation aspect. The orientations are isomorphic to &gt; the
        commutative group (Z_2)^11 "cross" (Z_3)^7. The permutation group &gt;
        is isomorphic to (A_8 cross A_12) semi-direct product with Z_2. &gt; (I
        have this memorized since I'm a math major and get asked this &gt;
        question A LOT.) &gt; &gt; To learn more about these more abstract
        idiosyncrasies of the cube &gt; check out

        Why, V and R are very much so my favorite algorithms (R then V) Followed

        almost the same thing twice in a row (doing that just looks impressive)

        1211 POLL the guy gives about 12 different algs for each of the PLL. If

        Except the H, U and A, I can't perform any of them under 2 seconds (most
        over 3 seconds). I wish I knew a super ZB system that has a full OLL-PLL
        algorithms. (wich doesn't require to have the top-cross oriented). But
        that looks like a damn lot of algorithms lol. Maybe I'll write those one
        day, it'll be known as the VDP system. (I'll tell you when I'll start
        :P) But for know, I have to work on those 21+57 algorithms to solve the
        LL under 5 seconds....

        Ok...today was the first day back at school...and after a summer of
        mainly cubing and seeing few of my fellow classmates, of course, I was
        obligated to do some solves for them. This morning on the school bus a
        kid was like...Can I scramble your 4x4??? I was like sure...go
        ahead...Then he was like...how fast can you do it??? And i was
        like...usually below 5 mintues...and I got a PB of 3:41.xx which is
        better than my previous of 3:58.07...then at school I did a bunch of
        solves...and then at lunch I went over to the Loblaws(a grocery store
        where they sell really good hot food...And I ran into some schoolmates
        and they were like...rumours are floating around you can solve a rubik's
        cube...and I was like...yah...so I did some solves for them...then the
        workers at Loblaws were like...can you do that???So I got one of them to
        scramble it...and she challenged me...If you can do it under 2 minutes
        (I am and average of approx. 60 solver...so I took the challenge...Got
        58.xx...lol free food...I'll take it...then on the bus ride home after
        volleyball practice I was riding the bus and scrambled all the cubes I
        had with me...i finally put together my black DIY with arched centers,
        and my dad glued the center caps on and i lubed it...then left it to dry
        about 24 hours...and my first solve i got a PB of 40.89...(ex-PB of
        43.30)...then I did a 4x4 solve and got a PB of 3:28.65...which I
        thought was cool...I didn't get any parity errors and I did centers in
        32 seconds...edges in about 1 minute 40 seconds and whatever else time

        The R perm is my favorite. I use the same alg Pedro gave. My fastest
        execution of this alg is 1.60, but it's usually under 2 unless it locks
        up. It's not my fastest PLL, but it's my favorite because it's so much

        Hey everyone, I'm very happy as now I am 100% convinced that sub-60 is
        possible for an average of 10 on the 4x4x4. Today I did an average and
        got two sub-60 parity times, with the OLL parity (the 15 move to fix
        one!). 63.92 (55.04) 66.58 65.54 62.02 67.21 67.78 56.47 (76.89) 70.04
        61.86 57.52 = 63.89 Both the 56.47 and the 57.52 were with the OLL
        parity, and I was still able to end with a sub-60 time. I've noticed
        that even though the 3x3x3 step is the most important, since it is after
        all the entire purpose of solving with centers first, that my fastest
        solves are when I really concentrate and blaze through the edges step. I
        think I am getting faster at my centers, but I know for a fact that I
        don't average as fast as Stefan Pochmann and his average for the 4x4
        centers on speedcubing.com. So I think I still need to improve my
        centers too. Anyway what I am trying to say is that even with a slower
        centers step, and a not the fastest 3x3x3 no-inspection step, I think
        sub-60 is possible. So I think this barrier is only in our heads, and
        that soon a LOT of people will break it. You don't need perfect steps to
        do it, just concentration and practice. Let's get past this stupid
        barrier and see what the limits are for the 4x4x4! Chris

        Hey everyone, I remember a while back Lars Vandenbergh did an analysis
        of all the possible cross solves for the 3x3x3 (or at least I think it
        was Lars) and found that no case takes more than 8 moves. I was
        wondering how can I go about doing the same type of analysis for solving
        the first two opposite centers of a 4x4x4? I'd like to know the maximum
        number of moves it takes to solve two opposite centers (I don't care
        about any other pieces), and also maybe an average # too. I guess my
        question is how exactly should I approach this problem? Chris

        This problem doesn't sound too difficult for a computer to run a brute
        force search for. Make a structure that only stores the center sticker
        colors and manipulates them accordingly; the key is to exploit as many
        of the cube symmetries as possible. As an experienced 4x4 solver
        yourself, you could probably provide a very reliable "branch and bound"
        for it. I must refine it to two different questions here: 1. Suppose we
        specify the opposite sides to be solved first. 2. We don't specify this
        and take the best possible opposite center pair. In the second question
        we would certainly get a smaller number (eh... or equal I guess). Oh and
        a third (dumber) question is if we specify one color *then* it's
        opposite. But this would create much bigger numbers, though I'm sure
        still better than humans who do not use any optimizations for
        symmutaneously achiving progrress on both sides. *Even I* can write a
        very quick and dirty program to give the answer to question 1 (if I had
        the time). Just to indicate how routine something like that would be for
        CS ppl. Now question 2 at first sight seems (at least to me) to be
        highly non-trivial, though I would assume to still be attainable using
        todays processor speeds. The more interesting number would be the answer
        to question 2, and the success of the program (running in reasonable
        time) I would think is totally reliant on exploiting cube symmetries.
        *By number I really mean numbers, since the program really would
        generate something like a chart for the number of positions at each
        "distance" to the identity. And though you would think there would be
        multiple identities, you would start by fixing one center as the piece
        that "never moves"... i.e. since doing (R) is some how the same as doing
        (Llr') for our purposes, it would suffice to have the mappings:
        &lt;L,r,R,B,f,F,u,d,D&gt; and fix the center piece on ULB quadrant that
        points up. -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, cmhardw

        convinced that sub-60 is possible &gt; for an average of 10 on the
        4x4x4. &gt; &gt; Today I did an average and got two sub-60 parity times,
        with the OLL &gt; parity (the 15 move to fix one!). &gt; &gt; 63.92
        (55.04) 66.58 65.54 62.02 67.21 67.78 56.47 (76.89) 70.04 &gt; 61.86
        57.52 = 63.89 &gt; &gt; Both the 56.47 and the 57.52 were with the OLL
        parity, and I was &gt; still able to end with a sub-60 time. &gt; &gt;
        I've noticed that even though the 3x3x3 step is the most important, &gt;
        since it is after all the entire purpose of solving with centers &gt;
        first, that my fastest solves are when I really concentrate and &gt;
        blaze through the edges step. &gt; &gt; I think I am getting faster at
        my centers, but I know for a fact &gt; that I don't average as fast as
        Stefan Pochmann and his average for &gt; the 4x4 centers on
        speedcubing.com. So I think I still need to &gt; improve my centers too.
        &gt; &gt; Anyway what I am trying to say is that even with a slower
        centers &gt; step, and a not the fastest 3x3x3 no-inspection step, I
        think sub- 60 &gt; is possible. &gt; &gt; So I think this barrier is
        only in our heads, and that soon a LOT of &gt; people will break it. You
        don't need perfect steps to do it, just &gt; concentration and practice.
        &gt; &gt; Let's get past this stupid barrier and see what the limits are
        for &gt; the 4x4x4! &gt; &gt; Chris

        a corner-piece that will break. I have never heard of centers between
        the middle center and a middle edge breaking. Of course this might
        happen, but never heard of it. If u are serious about 5x5x5 cubing you
        better have a spare cube u can take pieces from. One extra cube is 24 of
        those centers that are likely to break ;-) This should last a few yrs.

        Hello all: I am David Weinstein, and am heading up the Canadian PR
        initiative to promote the 25th Anniversary of the Cube, and the upcoming
        World Championships. As part of our promotion of the Championships, we
        are looking for Cube Enthusiasts who would be willing to demo their
        skills with the Canadian media (on TV Shows; with print journalists
        &amp; photographers; and even with radio hosts). Ideally we'd like to
        have Cubists from the following Canadian centers: 1. Halifax, NS 2.
        Montreal, QC 3. Ottawa, ON 4. Toronto, ON 5. London, ON 6. Winnipeg. MB
        7. Regina/Saskatoon, SK 8. Edmonton. AB 9. Calgary, AB 10. Vancouver, BC
        11. Other communities in BC If you can please reply and confirm your
        willingness to be profiled as a "local participant going the the
        championships" we will do our very best to secure some interviews for
        you, and ensure you are briefed prior to your interviews. Please let me
        be clear on one point: We are not asking you to be a spokesperson for
        the Cube - rather we'd like you to share your enthusiasm and cubing
        skills with the media - who will in turn profile you as a local resident
        who is going off the the Championships to represent your city/province/
        and our country. Typically these interviews happen in-studio (TV /
        Radio); in-person - meeting with either a TV/Radio or Print journalist
        at a coffee shop or wherever is mutually convenient; or over the phone.
        If you are interested in being profiled please reply to this email and
        let me know the following: 1. Who you are (Name) 2. Your phone and email
        address 3. What Canadian city you live in (or near) 4. Your experience
        level 5. Your area of cube expertise 6. and any confines that we might
        have to take into consideration to schedule your interviews We look
        forward to hearing from you, and making you famous in your community and

        Fellow Canadians, I just got off the phone with David Weinstein, and he
        is very enthusiastic about helping the cubing community. This is a great
        opportunity for us to have a shot at the Canadian Media to help promote
        our interest here in Canada. If you are skeptical about this, it is very
        legitimate and I encourage you to follow up. When he says reply, he

        riding the bus and &gt; scrambled all the cubes I had with me...i
        finally put together my &gt; black DIY with arched centers, and my dad
        glued the center caps on and &gt; i lubed it...then left it to dry about

        RUBIK'S Games Championships? Hello all: I am David Weinstein, and am
        heading up the Canadian PR initiative to promote the 25th Anniversary of
        the Cube, and the upcoming World Championships. As part of our promotion
        of the Championships, we are looking for Cube Enthusiasts who would be
        willing to demo their skills with the Canadian media (on TV Shows; with
        print journalists &amp; photographers; and even with radio hosts).
        Ideally we'd like to have Cubists from the following Canadian centers:
        1. Halifax, NS 2. Montreal, QC 3. Ottawa, ON 4. Toronto, ON 5. London,
        ON 6. Winnipeg. MB 7. Regina/Saskatoon, SK 8. Edmonton. AB 9. Calgary,
        AB 10. Vancouver, BC 11. Other communities in BC If you can please reply
        and confirm your willingness to be profiled as a "local participant
        going the the championships" we will do our very best to secure some
        interviews for you, and ensure you are briefed prior to your interviews.
        Please let me be clear on one point: We are not asking you to be a
        spokesperson for the Cube - rather we'd like you to share your
        enthusiasm and cubing skills with the media - who will in turn profile
        you as a local resident who is going off the the Championships to
        represent your city/province/ and our country. Typically these
        interviews happen in-studio (TV / Radio); in-person - meeting with
        either a TV/Radio or Print journalist at a coffee shop or wherever is
        mutually convenient; or over the phone. If you are interested in being
        profiled please reply to this email and let me know the following: 1.
        Who you are (Name) 2. Your phone and email address 3. What Canadian city
        you live in (or near) 4. Your experience level 5. Your area of cube
        expertise 6. and any confines that we might have to take into
        consideration to schedule your interviews We look forward to hearing
        from you, and making you famous in your community and across Canada!

        Cubing in front of non-cubers is always funny at the beginning, anbd
        then depending on the people, it can be very fun or very boring The
        worst people are the ones that either tell you to stop because of the
        noise, either they are like : you are stupid, I can do it faster than
        you. Have fun at your school with your new followers (disciples ?). :D

        Weird because on my cube the orange stickers is almost indestructible,
        the white is pretty good and all the other colors have been replaced.
        This is one of ton¬ís studio cubes. The orange seems to be of a different
        material than the others, and are very solid. Terje -----Opprinnelig

        scrambled all the cubes I had with me...i finally put together my &gt;
        &gt; black DIY with arched centers, and my dad glued the center caps on
        &gt; and &gt; &gt; i lubed it...then left it to dry about 24 hours...and
        my first &gt; solve i &gt; &gt; got a PB of 40.89...(ex-PB of
        43.30)...then I did a 4x4 solve and &gt; got &gt; &gt; a PB of
        3:28.65...which I thought was cool...I didn't get any &gt; parity &gt;
        &gt; errors and I did centers in 32 seconds...edges in about 1 minute 40
        &gt; &gt; seconds and whatever else time for the 3x3 part...I was happy
        for &gt; &gt; today...I'll shut up now... :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Craig

        Dear All. I can also verify that David is the PR guru for Canada, it was
        David and his team that managed to get the fantastic coverage in

        am David Weinstein, and am heading up the Canadian PR initiative to
        promote the 25th Anniversary of the Cube, and the upcoming World
        Championships. &gt; &gt; As part of our promotion of the Championships,
        we are looking for Cube Enthusiasts who would be willing to demo their
        skills with the Canadian media (on TV Shows; with print journalists
        &amp; photographers; and even with radio hosts). &gt; &gt; Ideally we'd
        like to have Cubists from the following Canadian centers: &gt; &gt; &gt;
        1. Halifax, NS &gt; 2. Montreal, QC &gt; 3. Ottawa, ON &gt; 4. Toronto,
        ON &gt; 5. London, ON &gt; 6. Winnipeg. MB &gt; 7. Regina/Saskatoon, SK
        &gt; 8. Edmonton. AB &gt; 9. Calgary, AB &gt; 10. Vancouver, BC &gt; 11.
        Other communities in BC &gt; &gt; If you can please reply and confirm
        your willingness to be profiled as a "local participant going the the
        championships" we will do our very best to secure some interviews for
        you, and ensure you are briefed prior to your interviews. &gt; &gt;
        Please let me be clear on one point: We are not asking you to be a
        spokesperson for the Cube - rather we'd like you to share your
        enthusiasm and cubing skills with the media - who will in turn profile
        you as a local resident who is going off the the Championships to
        represent your city/province/ and our country. &gt; &gt; Typically these
        interviews happen in-studio (TV / Radio); in- person - meeting with
        either a TV/Radio or Print journalist at a coffee shop or wherever is
        mutually convenient; or over the phone. &gt; &gt; If you are interested
        in being profiled please reply to this email and let me know the
        following: &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Who you are (Name) &gt; 2. Your phone and
        email address &gt; 3. What Canadian city you live in (or near) &gt; 4.
        Your experience level &gt; 5. Your area of cube expertise &gt; 6. and
        any confines that we might have to take into consideration to schedule
        your interviews &gt; &gt; We look forward to hearing from you, and
        making you famous in your community and across Canada! &gt; &gt;

        heading up the Canadian PR initiative to promote the 25th Anniversary of
        the Cube, and the upcoming World Championships. As part of our promotion
        of the Championships, we are looking for Cube Enthusiasts who would be
        willing to demo their skills with the Canadian media (on TV Shows; with
        print journalists &amp; photographers; and even with radio hosts).
        Ideally we'd like to have Cubists from the following Canadian centers:
        1. Halifax, NS 2. Montreal, QC 3. Ottawa, ON 4. Toronto, ON 5. London,
        ON 6. Winnipeg. MB 7. Regina/Saskatoon, SK 8. Edmonton. AB 9. Calgary,
        AB 10. Vancouver, BC 11. Other communities in BC If you can please reply
        and confirm your willingness to be profiled as a "local participant
        going the the championships" we will do our very best to secure some
        interviews for you, and ensure you are briefed prior to your interviews.
        Please let me be clear on one point: We are not asking you to be a
        spokesperson for the Cube - rather we'd like you to share your
        enthusiasm and cubing skills with the media - who will in turn profile
        you as a local resident who is going off the the Championships to
        represent your city/province/ and our country. Typically these
        interviews happen in-studio (TV / Radio); in-person - meeting with
        either a TV/Radio or Print journalist at a coffee shop or wherever is
        mutually convenient; or over the phone. If you are interested in being
        profiled please reply to this email and let me know the following: 1.

        Brothers and sisters! I just discovered why God can be a bit slow
        answering prayers right now. Apparently He has been swamped by
        grovelling e-mails addressed to god@.... If you need proof (shurely
        not), take a look at http://heaven.com/prayer/ You can send your e-mail
        to jesus@... if you prefer, or even use the on-line submission form.

        Hey guys, I just had my backup hard drive tank and I lost a ton of stuff
        (none of it important). One of the things I'm now looking for is a
        catchy little song about the cube. I've only ever heard of 3 songs
        specifically about the cube, and I can only remember the name and singer
        of one: Baron Knights - "Mr. Rubik" Luckily, I remember a lot of lyrics
        from the other two, so I'll post em and see if anyone else can tell me
        who sang them or where to find them. The first I stumbled across on the
        internet one day and goes something like: I've never peeled off the
        stickers, Taken apart the pieces, Or purchased any books with the
        solution. But I'm gonna get that bottom line If it takes all my time,
        Cause I don't want to add to next year's resolutions. Whether by skill
        or by luck, There's no choice but to mix it back up. Where will I be
        when old Rubik's stops challenging me. It's longer than that and maybe
        not in the right order, but you get the jist. Anyway, it was actually a
        catchy melody and I really liked it! So any help finding it would be
        greatly appreciated. The last song I first heard during Comedy Central's
        "Premium Blend" a few years back. I'm pretty sure he was the last
        performer to go on. It was more silly (like the Baron Knights song) but
        still not bad. Anyway, here's what I remember of it: Hello operator can
        you get me Hungry? I've got to talk to Erno Rubik 'bout this problem you
        see. ... (chorus) Rubik's cube, it's driving me crazy! I'm about to peal
        the stickers off 'Cause I'm too stupid and lazy. Sorry, that was a
        loooong time ago that I heard that so I don't remember very much of it.
        At any rate, those are the only cube songs I know about (though lots
        actually mention the cube without being about it!) So if you guys have
        any more or know which these are, I'd appreciate it! Thanks! Daniel

        There aren't any resources for this mysterious "Waterman" method. I have
        no idea who Mark Waterman is and the only thing I know about his method
        is that it has something to do with corner's first but it doesn't seem
        there is anything on the internet to teach these things. Can someone
        direct me to the "Waterman" method? I am relatively new to cubing so as
        far as I know, it's just a myth... kinda like Loch Ness and the Yeti.
        These legendary things but why should I believe it if I haven't seen it?

        One of the things I'm now looking for is a catchy &gt; little song about
        the cube. I've only ever heard of 3 songs &gt; specifically about the
        cube, and I can only remember the name and &gt; singer of one: &gt; &gt;
        Baron Knights - "Mr. Rubik" &gt; &gt; Luckily, I remember a lot of
        lyrics from the other two, so I'll post &gt; em and see if anyone else
        can tell me who sang them or where to find them. &gt; &gt; The first I
        stumbled across on the internet one day and goes something &gt; like:
        &gt; &gt; I've never peeled off the stickers, &gt; Taken apart the
        pieces, &gt; Or purchased any books with the solution. &gt; But I'm
        gonna get that bottom line &gt; If it takes all my time, &gt; Cause I
        don't want to add to next year's resolutions. &gt; Whether by skill or
        by luck, &gt; There's no choice but to mix it back up. &gt; &gt; Where
        will I be when old Rubik's stops challenging me. &gt; &gt; It's longer
        than that and maybe not in the right order, but you get &gt; the jist.
        Anyway, it was actually a catchy melody and I really liked &gt; it! So
        any help finding it would be greatly appreciated. &gt; &gt; The last
        song I first heard during Comedy Central's "Premium Blend" a &gt; few
        years back. I'm pretty sure he was the last performer to go on. &gt; It
        was more silly (like the Baron Knights song) but still not bad. &gt;
        Anyway, here's what I remember of it: &gt; &gt; Hello operator can you
        get me Hungry? &gt; I've got to talk to Erno Rubik 'bout this problem
        you see. &gt; ... &gt; (chorus) &gt; Rubik's cube, it's driving me
        crazy! &gt; I'm about to peal the stickers off &gt; 'Cause I'm too
        stupid and lazy. &gt; &gt; Sorry, that was a loooong time ago that I
        heard that so I don't &gt; remember very much of it. &gt; &gt; At any
        rate, those are the only cube songs I know about (though lots &gt;
        actually mention the cube without being about it!) So if you guys &gt;
        have any more or know which these are, I'd appreciate it! &gt; &gt;

        we nearly succeeded! In this period I met Anneke Treep and entered CFF
        (Cubism For Fun, the Dutch cube association). I did contests with Guus
        Razoux-Schultz at his home, and won most times. We practised together
        very often, we learned each others method. We even did contests, using
        each others method, and became as fast as 40 seconds!" 40 seconds was
        obviously a time to get excited about (even if it was a different method
        would they be so happy if they were much faster using their own methods)
        so a very good time for 41 cubes would be 41*40 seconds = 1640 seconds
        which is 27 minutes 20 seconds. Could it be that they tried to solve 41
        cubes between them (i.e. about 20.5 cubes each)? That would then be 13
        minutes 40 (on a very good time) so allowing for less good times and
        tiredness setting in 15 minutes could be still a good time. Or could it
        be that 40 seconds with a different method seemed extraordinary (in
        which case, what time would be realistic from their own methods)? It
        doesn't seem to add up to me.

        Progress! I have discovered that the third song I mention is called

        the alter ego of Eric Drysdale who write's for Comedy Central's "The

        and e-mailed him directly asking if I could have a copy of the song and
        if I could post it to the group. There is VERY little information about
        this song on the internet. I'm still hunting for the other song though,

        There are lots of other methods out there both discovered and
        undiscovered. I'm an old cuber which means I'm biased towards those who
        find there own way :) Waterman exists. Fridrich is fantastically clever
        and has been refined by so many people it probably is the best full
        method for becoming a top speedcuber but that doesn't mean it always
        will be. Go out and find your own way! Duncan

        The Waterman Method is not "mysterious" at all, and there are sources of
        it online. Josef Jelinek made a site that explicitly demonstrates the
        method in full detail and recently had Waterman's permission to have it
        fully published on the www.rubiks.info site. A few people I know in here
        are learning/use it (Josef himself, Mike Atkinson...). Not sure if some
        of them gave it up or not, but I think it has something to do with (or a
        variation of) David Allen's method back in wc2003. Might wanna check the
        forum database for this stuff... :) -Brent Morgan

        If you're serious about organizing one, you should recruit some help,
        decide some definite details about date and venue, and then talk to
        Tyson. That said, if there were to be a competition in Colorado Springs,
        I'd be there in a heartbeat. Well, about 12 hours, but you get the idea.

        OK, sorry to spam the boards guys but I this was driving me crazy. Last
        post on the subject, I promise! I've been searching all day and finally
        found out every thing I need to know. Song 1 - You folks were kind
        enough to point me to a download of "Mr. Rubik" By The Barron Knights.
        That was the easy one! Song 2 - After much searching, the secret lies in
        post number 2715 of our very own group. The song is "Rubik's Cube" by
        the Amateur Lovers off the 1997 album Virgin White Lies. I posted it on
        www.putfile.com , which I've never used before so let me know if it
        works: http://media.putfile.com/RubiksCube26 It's a fantastic song, and
        there were many responses to the original post about it. Odd that none
        of us remembered them. Song 3 - "This Rubik's Cube is Driving me Crazy!"
        - Eric Drysdale Originally aired on Comedy Central's Premium Blend
        episode 307 and (I think) can be found on Comic Remix episode 116. I'll
        have to keep an eye out on the comedy central tv listings, and see if
        Mr. Drysdale responds to my request. I'd like to have a copy of it.
        Other songs I found during the search: "Your Cat Can do the Cube" -
        Ronnie Allen &amp; the Missing Pieces from The Dr. Demento Show #82-41 -
        10/10/82 "I can't do The Cube" - Ronnie Allen &amp; the Missing Pieces
        "The Cube" - Bob Jenkins "Cubic Refugee" - Stevens &amp; Grdnic (not a
        typo) from The Dr. Demento Show #82-22 - May 30, 1982 I have been unable
        to find copies of any of these yet, though I do have partial lyrics for
        some. Thanks for the help, and I'm happy I can finally sleep! -Daniel

        Easiest way to solve the whitening orange stickers is just to take them
        off. Then you have black instead of orange, which works fine for me...

        With November rapidly approaching and in light of the recent achievments
        of some of the elite, I have some questions about what the possible
        limits of 4x4ing are. I know most of the top cubers feel that sub-60 is
        realistically achievable. I'm curious what they feel the fastest
        possible average will be. I'm also curious about the current average
        move counts of the faster solvers out there for centers first, but also
        for other systems. I've come up with an edges first method that works
        great for me, and I'm curious how it compares. With the method I use, a
        good solve without the hard parity generally runs about 130 moves. With
        the hard parity it's about 140. A good solve without either parity is
        around 120 to 125. Now, my times with this are still pretty high (2 min.
        on average), but that works out to a little over 1 move per second. I
        suspect the top solvers are moving at twice this speed. Because it's
        edges first, there are a lot of slice moves. Probably many more than a
        centers first method. This will perhaps make it slower overall than
        centers first, but I wonder how much. This method affords excellent look
        ahead, but is that enough to offset the possible extra moves and more
        slice turns? Currently, I'm averaging something like 49-50 seconds for
        the two 1x3x4 blocks on L and R, around 40-41 for the U layer corners
        and the edge pairing and placement, and 34-35 for the centers. I'm 100%
        certain these times could be much lower with more effort. I think more
        specialized algorithms would help for both the centers stage and for
        edge pairing. I also think I could benefit from learning more algs for
        the two centers I begin with. It often takes me 10 or more seconds for
        the first two centers alone. As I understand it, that's only a little
        less than it takes some people to solve all 6. Another area I think
        could stand some improvement is the final centers stage. I'm left with 4
        centers in the M slice. I really only use a few cases to solve
        everything. Once I get the hang of solving 3 cycles, though, it should
        go much faster. I can't seem to find the alg anywhere that swaps 3
        opposite center cubies, though. I know someone mentioned it in a post on
        here, but I can't find it. Based on how efficient my solving currently
        is, improvement to sub-30 for the first step, 25-30 for the second, and
        sub-25 for the third should be easily attainable. This still comes out
        to 80-85 seconds, but that's a far cry from my 150 pb with centers
        first. I know that if someone were to put as much effort into this
        method as some people are putting into centers first, this could be
        taken much farther than I am, but I suppose laziness strikes again...
        Anyway, I guess this wraps up my late night ramble. Thanks for reading
        if you made it this far. ;) Happy (big) cubing. -Mike Bennett

        I havent checked this out but it seems to me that the number of seconds
        to be really world class to solve a cube is around about (maybe a bit
        less than!) the number of cubies in that cube. That would mean under 20
        seconds for 3x3x3, 56 seconds for 4x4x4 and 1 minute 32 seconds for
        5x5x5. Just a rule of thumb and I dont actually know what good times for
        5x5x5 are - I suspect that they aren't quite that fast - yet! Anyway one
        cubie per second solving sounds like a reasonable goal. Maybe it gives
        us a target for the 6x6x6 too. Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From:

        Hey Gilles, I am nobody according to your opinion? :-) Well, I know all
        the algs of the method, however, I know just optimal ones (in UMR group,
        generated by ACube); the original method contains some algs that are
        longer (all found 'manually' by Marc, Daan, and some others). The point
        is that unlike Fridrich and similar methods, the sequences can be
        learned by understanding what is to be accomplished. Knowing background
        of the last step of the Gilles's method may help in this. I still have
        to improve a lot (I average low 20s now - even without fingertricks...).
        I agree with Gilles, that you can get 15s with this or similar method. I
        saw video of Marc doing 42 cubes bellow 17min with many mistakes and
        some pops and obviously crap stiff cubes. He used absolutely NO
        fingetricks and M, M', M2 doing always like r'R, rR', and r2R2... Josef

        Hi! I have been thinking about this for a while without posting about
        it. My cage method for 4x4x4 requires about 145-150 moves. And i have
        achieved averages of about 70 secs and lower for that. So that's slight
        above 2 moves/sec. The way i see it there are 2 aspects to how fast u
        can solve a twisty puzzle. One is og course the solution length. And the
        other is turning speed. Im a firm believer that eventually it's the
        method with higher turning speed that will be the best. In order to
        achieve high turning speed 2 things are required. Good lookahead and
        predictability of where cubies will end up after an algorithm (sequence
        of moves). Good lookahead leads to shorter delays between successive
        algorithms. Moving only a few pieces by each algorithm makes it easier
        to track cubies and hence makes it easier to prepare for next sequence
        of moves. I have strong doubts it will be possible to solve 1 cubie/sec
        for larger cubes than 5x5x5. Even for 5x5x5 im not really close to that
        on average. There is too large "search space" as the puzzles go larger
        (have more parts/cubies). Maybe others have an opinion about this ??

        &gt; solve without either parity is around 120 to 125. Now, my times
        with &gt; &gt; this are still pretty high (2 min. on average), but that
        works out to &gt; &gt; a little over 1 move per second. I suspect the
        top solvers are moving &gt; &gt; at twice this speed. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Because it's edges first, there are a lot of slice moves. Probably
        &gt; &gt; many more than a centers first method. This will perhaps make
        it &gt; &gt; slower overall than centers first, but I wonder how much.
        This method &gt; &gt; affords excellent look ahead, but is that enough
        to offset the &gt; &gt; possible extra moves and more slice turns? &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Currently, I'm averaging something like 49-50 seconds for
        the two &gt; &gt; 1x3x4 blocks on L and R, around 40-41 for the U layer
        corners and the &gt; &gt; edge pairing and placement, and 34-35 for the
        centers. I'm 100% &gt; &gt; certain these times could be much lower with
        more effort. I think &gt; &gt; more specialized algorithms would help
        for both the centers stage and &gt; &gt; for edge pairing. I also think
        I could benefit from learning more &gt; &gt; algs for the two centers I
        begin with. It often takes me 10 or more &gt; &gt; seconds for the first
        two centers alone. As I understand it, that's &gt; &gt; only a little
        less than it takes some people to solve all 6. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Another area I think could stand some improvement is the final centers
        &gt; &gt; stage. I'm left with 4 centers in the M slice. I really only
        use a &gt; &gt; few cases to solve everything. Once I get the hang of
        solving 3 &gt; &gt; cycles, though, it should go much faster. I can't
        seem to find the &gt; &gt; alg anywhere that swaps 3 opposite center
        cubies, though. I know &gt; &gt; someone mentioned it in a post on here,
        but I can't find it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Based on how efficient my
        solving currently is, improvement to sub-30 &gt; &gt; for the first
        step, 25-30 for the second, and sub-25 for the third &gt; &gt; should be
        easily attainable. This still comes out to 80-85 seconds, &gt; &gt; but
        that's a far cry from my 150 pb with centers first. I know that &gt;
        &gt; if someone were to put as much effort into this method as some
        people &gt; &gt; are putting into centers first, this could be taken
        much farther than &gt; &gt; I am, but I suppose laziness strikes
        again... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I guess this wraps up my late night
        ramble. Thanks for &gt; &gt; reading if you made it this far. ;) Happy
        (big) cubing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Mike Bennett &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi Josef, When you say 16 moves for one layer do you mean a complete
        layer oriented and positioned correctly - that would be a very useful
        start for my system! I will look around now but any chance of a link
        where I could find out how to do a layer in that few moves? I can do a
        layer and two middle edges in 22 - 24 but 16 sounds good and there may
        be some good tips for me there. Duncan ----- Original Message -----

        I just thought that I would pass this along to those who may be
        interested. Want to know how to solve the cube? Already know how to
        solve? Just want to watch (and be amazed)? Please feel free to join them
        no matter your skill level. Gather tips from some of the best
        speedcubers in the world. Some of the attendees are 5x5 unofficial world
        record holder Frank Morris, sub-20 solver Chris Hunt and many local
        cubers (range of solve times 30 secs to a min) and many other local
        people. Get information on the recent Cal-Tech Dallas Tournament, the
        upcoming World Championships in Orlando and much more. Prizes are
        supplied by 7 Towns and the competition is sponsored by the Idaho
        Speedcubing Club. For more information on cubing (and speedcubing)
        please see the following links isconline.tk www.speedcubing.com Please
        pass this along to friends, family, coworkers that may be interested or
        who can cube themselves. "Hope you have the time of your life" - GD

        I would definitely attend if there was a tournament in Denver. I'm
        looking for any excuse to go visit home. The springs are just so far
        from the city though. I think there would be a better turnout in Denver,

        enthusiastic cubers like Chris and Ron helped make it popular, and
        developed it more. Cheers, David J

        Hi! All the stuff i use for any size cube is all mine. I use a pretty
        basic LBL for 3x3x3 and average on average mid to low 20's. For larger
        cubes i use sorta LBL also. I call it the cage method: i build first
        layer complete, middle layers edges, last layer corners, last layer
        edges (and parity)and then finally all the remaining centers. If i
        switch to a better f2l or LL for 3x3x3 i will learn algs from sites or
        reinvent them somehow ;-) That would be my first "cube-cheating" ;-)

        Hello, I was about to make a post on a neat thread when I realized that
        it was a bit old, so here is just some thoughts on blind cubing that I
        was going to toss in. If any of you have gotten a cube (or megaminx or
        any other) from mefert's then youve probably seen the neat tiles that he
        uses instead of stickers. These have a bunch of little grooves that add
        a nice little texture. And, on a perfectly solved cube or minx ect. all
        the lines go in one direction (which adds a nice level of difficulty
        when you have to acount for center square orientation for all faces of a
        3x3x3). Draw a arrow on your centers and you'll get the idea. :)
        Any-whoo, Duct-tape, grip tape, vinyl tape, fine grit sanpaper, and your
        standard stickers would be all you would need to start getting used to
        blind, and maby start texturing 2 or more faces the same once you wanted
        to. Just some thoughts, happy cubing. Carter. I'd also LOVE to see some
        more thoughts on solving when you have to acount for center face
        orientation or if there are any cool observations already known about
        it. I got started looking into this when one of my cubes had the rubiks
        logo on the white center sticker... Have a good one.

        Hi Clancy, Many things were invented by more than one person
        independently. Same goes for cross/F2L/OLL/PLL system. Jessica was one
        of them, but she was the first who published the system on internet.
        Even the cube itself was invented by more than 1 person. And ZB system.
        Because of Jessica (and the fact that it is a very good system and that
        most people copy what is good) the cross/F2L/OLL/PLL system has become
        so popular. Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message ----- From: Clancy

        Hi, Just to clear up a few things. Bisqwit's site should not be taken
        seriously as an official world record video game site. The videos on
        Bisqwit's site were all done by manipulating emulators to play the game
        literally frame by frame, and re-records so that if you mess up you can
        just go back and fix it. Most of the videos on that site took literally
        tens of thousands of re-records while playing at super slow motion. The
        purpose of Bisqwit's site is to make videos showing a game being played
        theoretically to perfection. The official site for speed video game
        accomplishments is www.speeddemosarchive.com. www.twingalaxies.com is
        another one. The videos you see here are all 100% legit, played on a
        real console and all painstakingly verified as such. So, if you want to
        see the TRUE world records for speed video games,
        www.speeddemosarchive.com is the only place. If you want to see a bunch
        of low skilled gamers who make fake videos and try to pass them off as
        real, legit records, easily fooling the casual audience, then maybe
        Bisqwit's site is your place. I used to be really into speed running
        video games myself (hence my user name). There has long been animosity
        between Bisqwit's site and the real speed runners, if you couldn't tell
        from my last paragraph ;P. A run that I highly recommend watching on
        speeddemosarchive.com is the Super Mario World 96 exit run. ;)

        down and started getting a bunch of 24's. In the middle of the average I
        started getting nervous and got some 30's and 35's. And then I realized
        what had happened: Slowing down really did make go faster. By more than
        8 seconds.

        Hi all, I am interested in stats (using the Fridrich method) of people
        in this group: - how much time does it take you to solve F2L? - how much
        time does ik take you to solve the whole cube? Same goes for number of
        moves (when trying to go for speed, not for minimal number of moves): -
        how many moves does it take you to solve F2L? - how many moves does ik
        take you to solve the whole cube? Please take the average of many cubes
        (e.g., 30, 50, 100). To start, mine are: F2L 21.34 sec (61.5% of total)
        all 34.70 sec F2L 32.97 moves (56.0% of total) all 58.90 moves Dennis

        Sorry, didn't realize the auction rule. The gist of it is, both pics can
        be rotated so that red is on top and yellow is front-left. The first one
        shows white at front-right and the second shows blue at front- right.
        This isn't just a weird color scheme; it's impossible. By the way, I'm
        one of the few who prefers the Japanese, or white-blue color scheme. I
        guess that's b/c the very first cube I had (Ideal plastic cylinder no
        less!) was that way. But also, I tend to want what I can't have. Back in
        the 80's, virtually all cubes were white-blue. I wanted white-yellow to
        match the TV commercial. So I rearranged the stickers, ruining a few in
        the process. Now that white-yellow is all that's available in the US, I
        want white- blue. So I rearranged the stickers, ruining a few in the
        process...Wish they'd just offer both at the same time. Any other
        white-blue fans (outside Japan)? KK &gt; Please better no links to
        auctions that aren't over yet. &gt; The cube is perfectly alright,
        nothing unusual about it. Note there's &gt; one front and one back
        picture. &gt; &gt; Stefan

        "This Rubik's Cube is Driving me Crazy!" - Eric Drysdale &gt; Originally

        song is "Rubik's Cube" by the Amateur Lovers &gt; &gt; off the 1997
        album Virgin White Lies. I posted it on www.putfile.com &gt; &gt; ,
        which I've never used before so let me know if it works: &gt; &gt;
        http://media.putfile.com/RubiksCube26 It's a fantastic song, and &gt;
        &gt; there were many responses to the original post about it. Odd that
        &gt; &gt; none of us remembered them. &gt; &gt; here is a direct link :

        Very similar to my method. I do OC then OE...a throwback to James
        Nourse's "Simple Solution" book. I do know all the PLL's but I'm still
        slower than you! Which 3 have you yet to learn? The last and hardest one
        for me to learn was Fridrich's "G" which I like to call the "Flag".
        Anyways I don't have my precise stats but I'm probably about 40 moves
        for the F2L and 65 for the cube. My F2L is very high for two reasons, 1)
        I suck at the cross and 2) I cannot recognize F2L patterns to save my
        life, so I make a ton of extra U-turns. If I want to align the
        red-white-green corner and red-green edge, for example, I have to move
        that corner between the red and green sides or I cannot see how to do
        it. Timewise I'm averaging about 30-32s for the F2L and 50-52s for the
        whole cube. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, j3pinter

        Possibly old news by now but I learned a new algorithm for the Fridrich
        E permute from the Rubiks.com online cube. Maybe not as easy to execute
        as the Fridrich but I like it MUCH better because it's more symmetrical
        and provides more visual clues. When I'm doing the R B L... algorithm I
        get totally lost because I cannot see all the cubies lining up until the
        last couple of moves. Anyways it's L U' R D2 R' U L' R U' L D2 L' U R'
        which can be adapted three other ways depending on what your hands like.

        lots of ways there are a few solutions to the 20x20x20. The supercube

        Hi all, Today I completed the 20x20 super cube. Which was an ambitious
        attempt, considering; 1) the biggest super cube I've solved is a 3x3,
        and 2) the biggest normal cube I've solved is a 10x10. By far the most
        difficult thing for me was solving the 6th center. I didn't know how to
        3 cycle centers. With help from Chris and Per I was able to figure this
        out. Total solving time: 19 hours 37 minutes I lost a lot of time due to
        mistakes, but without errors I wouldn't have done much better than 10
        hours anyway. I had always wanted to solve the 20x20, so it just made
        sense to me to "go for the gold". Details and screenshots soon to come
        on my website! Keep an eye out :) www.geocities.com/rubiks_galaxia Happy

        Hey All, Alright, Well, let me bring you all up to speed. A supercube is
        a cube in which each piece must be properly oriented in its proper spot,
        not just any random spot for multiple pieces(such as on a 5x5 the X and
        + pieces can be switched around on a regular cube, but on a supercube
        they must be in a certain place) Before Gabbasoft, there was no computer
        software that would produce a 20x20x20 supercube, and few that would
        produce a regular. Chris Hardwick has only solved a regular 20x20x20,
        not the supercube, though I am sure that he will at some point attempt
        the supercube, the crazy monster that he is... There are only 7 people
        on speedcubing.com who have solved a 20x20x20. Richard Patterson has
        just become the first person to solve the 20x20x20 Supercube, with a
        time of 19 hours 37 minutes. I would like to congratulate him as this is
        an amazing feat...This was not done all in one sitting, but in
        total...If you want any details about the solve, please ask him, not me.

        Hem the rate of posts seem to have sped back up again. If anybody was
        going to ask this question, I thought it would be you (after reading so
        many posts, I get a good feel for who tends to post what types of
        questions :)). For those that don't know: I have my own system and
        started developing it about 6.5 years ago. I use it in combination with
        other methodology though. Depending on the inital preinspection I might
        use GuusR.S. (Fridrich but with CLL/ELL instead). I'll go for Petrus
        solves about 3% of the time, and a Gilles method solve about 5% of the
        time... approximately, I really should keep track. I incorporated some
        ZBF2L algs into my solving (as part of advancing the Petrus method). I
        know a lot of what I would now like to call "Akimoto algs" or "Akimoto
        CLL", it was something I started doing accidently, but was motivated
        when he pointed it out. It's when each CLL case becomes a category of up
        to 8 cases depending on edge flip... basically I flip edges while doing
        CLL. (I've killed off a few categories of cases.) I was doing pure
        CLL/ELL in the first couple years I was working on my system. I don't
        start with a cross NOR with corners NOR with a "layer". I am a bit
        ashamed that I have yet to publish it. The algorithms I found using a
        rather ancient version of ACube (in which I took the original C++ code
        and modifided it a bit). Then after I wanted shorter c/e pairing algs I
        used Ron's listing. (But my CLL,ELL,COLL are all found either by trial
        and error or ACube, or composing algs I know.) I guess I'm holding on to
        one of the last unpublished *un- catergorizable* methods... well if you
        can call the Gilles method and Petrus method "block methods" then
        perhaps so is mine. But is is definately not LBL or CF. Though my steps
        are *strictly* a bit "modular". (something I thought was kinda cool was
        the uniquneness of this, as far as I know) And I keep (as in actively
        use) the entire PLL set, 65% of OLLs, all the COLLs, ELLs, CLLs, and F2L
        paring algs a subset of the algs needed for this system as it currently
        stands. (It is)/(I am) currently moving it two directions, adding more
        of the Lars step 6+7 combinded and ZBF2L. (Though I have decient enough
        partial edge control to make use of the limited ZBLL algs I know.) It
        still really helps to have a complete ELL set for backup incase ZB stuff
        goes wrong though. -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I'm not so sure that it was slowing down that made me go so much faster.
        If it was, I should be able to keep going that fast, but now I can't get
        times that fast anymore. It can't be luck, cause I did almost 50 solves
        at this speed. And it can't be that I was "in the zone" because I got
        the same kind of times 2 hours later for the FC. And if it was going
        slow, I should be able to do it again. But I can't. So I don't know what
        it was making me so much faster, but it's really bugging me now. --- In

        Hey! There's nothing really magic about supercubing (solving
        supercubes). All there is to it is cycling pieces. Once the cube is
        solved as a normal cube then the rest can be done with cycling the
        centers using only 3-cycles. It's just that u need to do a heck of lot
        of them on the 20x20x20 cube. Even if u start cleverly by directly
        solving all centers correctly and then do edges and corners without
        destroying all ur centers work :-) The way to go about it is as i said
        3-cycles. U can use 3 cycles involving 3 centers on same face or cycles
        involving centers from 2 adjacent faces or even 3-cycles involving
        centers from 3 faces. It's not too hard work to come up wuth these once
        one understands the principles of commutators and setup moves. U might
        end up with having to swap 2 "similar" centers on a face. In this case u
        have the same problem on at least one other face (and always an even
        number of faces). So u only have to do 2 3-cycles involving these 2
        faces to get those 4 centers in their correct places :-) Repeat this
        approach if u have same problem on more faces or other centergroups
        (orbitals) :-) Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        Hey! There's at least ONE more song about the rubiks cube. Or at least i
        suppose it's about that since it's from mid 80's and has the following
        title : "May the Cube be with you". The song is by Thomas Dolby and
        George Clinton. It's from the album "Aliens ate my Buick". Umm ..
        actually it was released in 1988 ... hehe ;-) Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        &gt; Song 2 - After much searching, the secret lies in post number 2715
        &gt; of &gt; &gt; our very own group. The song is "Rubik's Cube" by the
        Amateur &gt; Lovers &gt; &gt; off the 1997 album Virgin White Lies. I
        posted it on &gt; www.putfile.com &gt; &gt; , which I've never used

        http://media.putfile.com/RubiksCube26 It's a fantastic song, and &gt;
        &gt; there were many responses to the original post about it. Odd that
        &gt; &gt; none of us remembered them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Song 3 - "This

        aired on Comedy Central's Premium Blend episode 307 and &gt; (I &gt;

        &gt; an &gt; &gt; eye out on the comedy central tv listings, and see if
        Mr. Drysdale &gt; &gt; responds to my request. I'd like to have a copy
        of it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Other songs I found during the search: &gt;
        &gt; "Your Cat Can do the Cube" - Ronnie Allen &amp; the Missing Pieces
        from &gt; &gt; The Dr. Demento Show #82-41 - 10/10/82 &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I grew up with, using my Ideal cubes. But, that's the only reason.
        White/yellow is a better all-around color scheme IMO. My fastest time
        ever was on a W/Y cube. And I like to play a weird game with my cube,
        where I first "half-solve" the cube (each side must consist entirely of
        either that center's color or the opposite center's color), and then I
        "full-solve" from that point. It is MUCH easier on the eyes to have
        sides consisting of W/Y and B/G, than the other scheme. Anyways you
        should try the weird game. It's fun. KK --- In

        yellow opposite white on my cube. I feel that it &gt; (in Fridrich style
        solving) helps first in f2l recognition (using &gt; white) and then in
        OLL recognition (using yellow) since those colors &gt; stand out the
        most from the others. I also like the idea of having &gt; similar colors

        Hey! Please explain what u mean by that:-) Give me an example of that on
        the 5x5x5 cube in the normal UDFBRLMES notation :-) Is it done like a

        same first then? Can't see that that is any faster ... umm ... -Per &gt;

        There's nothing really magic about supercubing (solving supercubes).
        &gt; &gt; All there is to it is cycling pieces. Once the cube is solved
        as a &gt; &gt; normal cube then the rest can be done with cycling the
        centers using &gt; &gt; only 3-cycles. It's just that u need to do a
        heck of lot of them on &gt; &gt; the 20x20x20 cube. Even if u start
        cleverly by directly solving all &gt; &gt; centers correctly and then do
        edges and corners without destroying all &gt; &gt; ur centers work :-)
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The way to go about it is as i said 3-cycles. U can
        use 3 cycles &gt; &gt; involving 3 centers on same face or cycles
        involving centers from 2 &gt; &gt; adjacent faces or even 3-cycles
        involving centers from 3 faces. It's &gt; &gt; not too hard work to come
        up wuth these once one understands the &gt; &gt; principles of
        commutators and setup moves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; U might end up with
        having to swap 2 "similar" centers on a face. In &gt; &gt; this case u
        have the same problem on at least one other face (and &gt; &gt; always
        an even number of faces). So u only have to do 2 3-cycles &gt; &gt;
        involving these 2 faces to get those 4 centers in their correct &gt;
        &gt; places :-) Repeat this approach if u have same problem on more
        faces &gt; &gt; or other centergroups (orbitals) :-) &gt; &gt; You could
        slice and use a doublr transpostion instead of 2 3- cycles. That would
        be faster. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Per

        I could solve one now as the strings are long to remember so I can't
        remember the algorithms mostly and I can't think of the way I meant to
        do the original problem. I don't think in terms of commutators (I've
        never consciously thought that I would use a commutator - Ron showed me
        some time at Schiphol but I couldn't get my head round it and I forgot
        about it before I had caught the plane - he was too fast!) and I
        certainly don't know the difference between M, E and S but for instance
        this conjugate of a commutator could be used to do 2 4-cycles (on the F
        and R faces). (That's not exactly what was required but the last time I
        looked at a 5x5x5 was August 2004 and so I can't remember all the
        techniques to solve the thing.) uF2u'FR

        Ummm ... I thought u had a general easy principle for easily exchanging
        2 centers on a face while also swapping 2 on another face. That should
        have worked also on the 5x5x5 cube... And now u come with something
        which is much longer than 2 3-cycles and also it's not doing what is
        should do ... :-? Ok, i will show how easily it's done with 2 3-cycles
        to achieve the dual swap ;-) Say u want to swap 1 and 2 on one face and
        3 and 4 on a second face. U simply make up the following 2 3-cycles :
        (1,2,3) and (1,4,3) Those are the cycles relative to locations. 1 1 2 2
        (faces) 1 2 3 4 (locations) ======= 2 1 4 3 &gt; do (1,2,3) 4 2 1 3 &gt;
        do (1,4,3) 1 2 3 4 &gt; done!! (matches locations!) After first 3-cycle
        one can see easily which to do next. One of the centers is already in
        it's correct location. Maybe i'll post a specific example and actual
        move sequences later. But htis should give the idea. This shouldn't
        require more than 16 moves in total. With possible move cancellation btw
        the 2 sequences :-) &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Please explain what u mean by that:-) Give me an example of that on &gt;

        &gt; &gt; a commutator? Swapping 2 at a time? Wouldn't u need move all 4
        &gt; &gt; centers to same first then? Can't see that that is any faster
        ... &gt; &gt; umm ... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's
        been a long time since I looked at a 5x5x5 - I'm not sure I could solve
        one &gt; now as the strings are long to remember so I can't remember the
        algorithms &gt; mostly and I can't think of the way I meant to do the
        original problem. &gt; &gt; I don't think in terms of commutators (I've
        never consciously thought that I &gt; would use a commutator - Ron
        showed me some time at Schiphol but I &gt; couldn't get my head round it
        and I forgot about it before I had caught the &gt; plane - he was too
        fast!) and I certainly don't know the difference between M, &gt; E and S
        but for instance this conjugate of a commutator could be used to do 2
        &gt; 4-cycles (on the F and R faces). (That's not exactly what was
        required but the &gt; last time I looked at a 5x5x5 was August 2004 and
        so I can't remember all the &gt; techniques to solve the thing.) &gt;

        Hey! That's beautiful for 5x5x5 of course, for some special cases. I can
        imagine some really horrible setup scenarios for the general case :- o
        And i can think of many more similar along ur lines of thought. But they
        won't really do the trick for the general case on an nxnxn cube. 2
        3-cycles still rocks IMHO ;-) OK, i will give 2 simple commutators that
        together interchange 2 x- centers on U face and similarly 2 on R face: (
        [P,Q]=P Q P'Q' as usual ) [r'u r,U'][R,u r'u'] (i would actually rotate
        the cube before the second commutator i guess) Easy as can be i think.
        Doing similar stuff to swap +-centers using U,R,E and M should be fairly
        easy :-) Have fun! -Per &gt; --- In

        Technically the term is best average of "5" but we all get what you
        mean. I think there is a wide range if differences in competitive times
        versus at home times. I've only competed in the speed solve twice but my
        most recent one was pretty good and I wasn't too nervous. Many people at
        the competitions get frustrated and nervous and their times become 15 to
        20% slower. However, there are a few freaks out there who do even better
        in the competition than they do while sitting in their dorm room next to
        their CobaltFlux Dance pad and computer. Sometimes, the pressure of
        competition can improve your times too. Perhaps it brings you to a new
        level of focus and gets you motivated. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        Hi all. Bob Burton has graciously agreed to let me put my 4x4 solution
        online as a part of his site. As I'm preparing material, I would greatly
        appreciate it if you guys could send me or reply to this post with any
        helpful 4x4 center mover algorithms you know. Moves that only rotate
        centers on their faces are unnecessary, but just about any other ones
        would be helpful, especially those involving 3 cycles and blocks. Also,
        because the L and R sides would be completed before this, moves
        involving three adjacent faces (U, F, and R, for example) would be
        unnecessary. Thanks ahead of time. (I'm looking at you, Per. =D ) -Mike

        I'd probably think of a commutator as [x,y] but to do the algorithm I'd
        need to expand that out which would be at odds with the shorter [x,y]
        and would make it harder to remember. But I don't cube these days so it
        doesn't matter anymore if I know any algorithms or not.

        If you are as old as the hills you might remember that supposedly Bert
        is Evil. Anyway, having discovered
        http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EvilNumber.html I decided to test if Bert
        was Evil in various bases (starting from base 30) using the digits 0-9,
        the letters A-T and other symbols. So in base 30, BERT represents the
        number which (in binary) is 1001011110010100111 so (at least in base 30)
        BERT is not evil. Similarly in base 36, BERT is not evil. I tried out
        bases 30 all the way up to 208. That's 179 tests of Bert being evil. I
        found Bert to be evil in 82 of the bases and odious in 97 of them. That
        makes Bert only 45.8% evil (approximately) - at least up to that stage.
        Of course, it would be better to figure out whether or not Bert was evil
        in liminf and limsup (or even in the limit if it exists) but the
        empirical evidence at least suggests that Bert is not evil - at least he
        appears to be less than 50% evil. Perhaps he'd only be not evil if the
        limsup was close to 0. If you stop at base 54, Bert is 56% evil. So far,
        the latest point at which Bert has been more than 50% evil is base 79
        and the latest point at which Bert was half evil (50%) was base 91. That
        means Bert has been less than 50% evil on average (for all bases from 30
        up to base n) for 117 consecutive bases.

        Hey, folks I just wanted to share with you my happiness. Today I made my
        first sub- 30 average! I'm very happy The times were: 28.67, 27.56,
        25.66, (25.59), 32.30, 32.83, (33.61), 31.84, 32.30, 26.84, 27.53,
        27.44. Average=29.30, SD=2.71 I was very concentrated, and managed to do
        7 sub-30 times. And the worst was 33.61. Man, this is very good to me!
        And earlier today, I made a very bad 35 average... I just have to stay
        calm and concentrate on fluency, more than turning speed. I know it is
        not such a thing, but, hey!, I've cubing for just 3 months! Thanks to
        all of you for algs and tips. I'm coming to sub-20 now... Wait for me...

        &gt; &gt; Tyson Mao &gt; MSC #631 &gt; California Institute of
        Technology Well, if it was in a set of 3 times then he's right. If it
        was in a set of 5 times with the best and worst times taken out I
        wouldn't say it was an average of 3 or 5. I wouldn't say it was
        technically an average of "5" though. I'd be more inclined to say it was
        an "average" of 5 (with the emphasis on average in that it was a
        truncated average rather than the mean that was being used). That may be
        because I'm a mathematician and not a cubist. In the other instance, I
        guess I could just solve it in under 12.11 minutes and let them think
        that I was the fastest in the world! &gt; &gt; On Sep 12, 2005, at 2:56

        Emphasis is not necessary in the cubing world. It's only necessary to
        people who don't know about cubing because an average with no times

        MSC #631 &gt;&gt; California Institute of Technology &gt; &gt; Well, if
        it was in a set of 3 times then he's right. If it was in a &gt; set of 5
        times with &gt; the best and worst times taken out I wouldn't say it was
        an average of &gt; 3 or 5. I &gt; wouldn't say it was technically an

        An average of 3 is technically termed an average of "5" because
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that's &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what we call it. You could go
        through all the technicalities in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything, but

        &gt;&gt;&gt; I just don't see why you'd complain that it was referred to
        as an &gt;&gt;&gt; average of 3, &gt;&gt;&gt; that's all. If you want to
        call it an average of "5", fair enough but &gt;&gt;&gt; complaining
        &gt;&gt;&gt; about it being called an average of 3 seems a bit over the

        also always been wondering why you click all your cubes together instead
        of writing a program that generates them... Here's a C++ program that
        aber about 1 second tells you that until base 100000 BERT is 50.25%
        evil: #include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; typedef long long

        while( n ){ n &amp;= n-1; evil = !evil; } evils += evil; } cout &lt;&lt;
        100.0 * evils / (last - first + 1); } Cheers! Stefan

        &gt;&gt;&gt; Well, if it was in a set of 3 times then he's right. If it
        was in a &gt;&gt;&gt; set of 5 times with &gt;&gt;&gt; the best and
        worst times taken out I wouldn't say it was an average &gt;&gt;&gt; of
        &gt;&gt;&gt; 3 or 5. I &gt;&gt;&gt; wouldn't say it was technically an
        average of "5" though. I'd be more &gt;&gt;&gt; inclined &gt;&gt;&gt; to
        say it was an "average" of 5 (with the emphasis on average in that
        &gt;&gt;&gt; it was a &gt;&gt;&gt; truncated average rather than the
        mean that was being used). That may &gt;&gt;&gt; be &gt;&gt;&gt; because
        I'm a mathematician and not a cubist. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In the
        other instance, I guess I could just solve it in under 12.11

        Technically the term is best average of "5" but we all get what
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        mean. I think there is a wide range if differences in
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; competitive
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times versus at home times. I've only
        competed in the speed &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solve
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; twice but my most recent one was pretty
        good and I wasn't too &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nervous.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many people at the competitions get
        frustrated and nervous and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times become 15 to 20% slower. However,
        there are a few freaks &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there who do even better in the
        competition than they do while &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sitting
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in their dorm room next to their
        CobaltFlux Dance pad and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; computer.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sometimes, the pressure of competition
        can improve your times &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; too.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps it brings you to a new level of
        focus and gets you &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; motivated.

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't make sense.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess you could rechnically call it a
        truncated average of 5 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (if
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there were 5 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        solves and the top and bottom times were dropped) because you'd
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; averaging a
        truncated set but an average of 3 can't be an average
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5.

        first = 30, last = 100000, evils = 0; &gt; for( Int b=first; b&lt;=last;
        b++ ){ &gt; char source[] = "BERT"; &gt; Int n = 0; &gt; for( int i=0;
        i&lt;4; i++ ) &gt; n = b * n + source[i] - 'A' + 10; I like that line
        Thats good. &gt; bool evil = true; &gt; while( n ){ &gt; n &amp;= n-1;
        OK that's very nice. &gt; evil = !evil; &gt; } &gt; evils += evil; &gt;
        } &gt; cout &lt;&lt; 100.0 * evils / (last - first + 1); &gt; } &gt;

        Well, if it was in a set of 3 times then he's right. If it was in a &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; set of 5 times with &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the best and worst
        times taken out I wouldn't say it was an average &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 3 or 5. I &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; wouldn't say it was
        technically an average of "5" though. I'd be more &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        inclined &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to say it was an "average" of 5 (with the

        Technically the term is best average of "5" but we all get what &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mean. I think there is a wide range if
        differences in &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; competitive &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times versus at home times. I've only
        competed in the speed &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solve &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; twice but my most recent one was pretty
        good and I wasn't too &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nervous.
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many people at the competitions
        get frustrated and nervous and &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        their &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times become 15 to 20%
        slower. However, there are a few freaks &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there who do even better in the
        competition than they do while &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        sitting &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in their dorm room next to
        their CobaltFlux Dance pad and &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        computer. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sometimes, the pressure
        of competition can improve your times &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; too. &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps it brings you to a new level of

        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't make sense. &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess you could rechnically call it a
        truncated average of 5 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (if &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there were 5 &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solves and the top and bottom times were
        dropped) because you'd &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; averaging a truncated set but an average of
        3 can't be an average &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;

        There is no WCA definition because the term "average" and "mean" has

        competitive &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times versus at

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; twice but my most recent one
        was pretty good and I wasn't too
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nervous.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many people at the competitions
        get frustrated and nervous and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        their &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; times become 15 to 20%
        slower. However, there are a few
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; freaks
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there who do even better in the
        competition than they do while &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        sitting &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in their dorm room next

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sometimes, the pressure of
        competition can improve your times
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; too.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps it brings you to a new

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How can an average of 3 be
        technically termed a best average of
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "5"?
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't make sense.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess you could rechnically call
        it a truncated average of 5 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (if
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there were 5
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solves and the top and bottom times
        were dropped) because you'd &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; averaging a truncated set but an
        average of 3 can't be an &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; average
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5.

        &gt; Because after that Excel started putting BERT in scientific
        notation &gt; &gt; and I got &gt; &gt; &gt; lazy. &gt; &gt; &gt; But
        spurred on by your message I have gone further - to base 8000 &gt; &gt;
        (no &gt; &gt; &gt; particular reason to stop there either except I don't
        want to &gt; &gt; overload the &gt; &gt; &gt; machine which is also
        solving cubes) and I found that up to that &gt; &gt; stage Bert &gt;
        &gt; &gt; was 51% evil! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Haha, you seriously need to
        learn a real programming language ;-) &gt; &gt; I can but I've not
        figured out how to do that on a Mac. I wouldn't have come up with as
        &gt; nice a solution as below though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've also
        always been wondering why you click all your cubes together &gt; &gt;
        instead of writing a program that generates them... &gt; &gt; Because
        I'm not good enough to write a cube solver - also, I am only solving
        specific cubes &gt; at the moment rather than generating a tree (if
        that's what you meant). &gt; At the moment, I'm only doing cube
        orientations. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here's a C++ program that aber
        about 1 second tells you that until &gt; &gt; base 100000 BERT is 50.25%
        evil: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #include &lt;iostream&gt; &gt; &gt; using
        namespace std; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; typedef long long Int; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; int main () { &gt; &gt; int first = 30, last = 100000, evils = 0;
        &gt; &gt; for( Int b=first; b&lt;=last; b++ ){ &gt; &gt; char source[] =
        "BERT"; &gt; &gt; Int n = 0; &gt; &gt; for( int i=0; i&lt;4; i++ ) &gt;
        &gt; n = b * n + source[i] - 'A' + 10; &gt; &gt; I like that line Thats
        good. &gt; &gt; &gt; bool evil = true; &gt; &gt; while( n ){ &gt; &gt; n
        &amp;= n-1; &gt; &gt; OK that's very nice. &gt; &gt; &gt; evil = !evil;
        &gt; &gt; } &gt; &gt; evils += evil; &gt; &gt; } &gt; &gt; cout &lt;&lt;
        100.0 * evils / (last - first + 1); &gt; &gt; } &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Actually, you can use Muppet Theory to prove Bert is evil. Definition. A
        lemon is a lemma. Lemon. RAD=1 Proof. Using chemical symbols NEON=NE,
        which means ON=1. BORON=B means ORON=1. Since ON=1, OR=1 also. XENON=XE
        means NON=1. Since ON=1, N=1 also. &gt;From ON=1 and N=1 we conclude
        O=1. &gt;From OR=1 and O=1 we conclude R=1. RADON=RN meaning ADO=1.
        Since O=1, AD=1 also. Thus R=1 and AD=1 so RAD=1. QED Theorem. BERT =
        EVIL Proof. RAD=1 from the lemon. IRAD=I EAD=I (Ohm's law E=IR) LEAD=LI
        PB=LI by chemical symbols. (It's nice to know that lead = lithium, but
        that is not what we want so let us continue.) In the proof of the lemon
        we showed N=1. Thus we can multiply by N on the right side only: PB=NIL
        PBRT=NRTIL The ideal gas law tells us PV=NRT. Thus PBRT=PVIL BRT=VIL and
        multiplying by E yields B E R T = E V I L Q.E.D.

        No seriously. I am also starting a Cube club in my institute and have
        started a yahoo group like this one and till now we have abt 30-35
        members. I recently got cubes for many of them so they'll atleast start
        cubing when the cube is in front of them. Only abt 3-4 ppl are really
        interested though. Anyone has any hints on how to make cubing popular?
        Ofcourse I boast abt my avg to everyone who cares to listen and I posted
        abt my blindfold cubing on our newsgroup and everyone was really
        excited. But that soon died down. :( Maybe i should start public cubing,
        but im a shy person and dont usually like to do this. Any other hints?

        I'm also planning on starting a cube club at my school (Liberty

        to class, sitting in class waiting for it to start, or sometimes during
        class. ;) So there are a lot of people that know me for my cubing and
        many people seem interested in a club. I've already taught 4 or 5 people
        there how to cube, and I know several more that want to learn. Bob, you
        have a cube club at your school, right? Any tips on making it a success?

        I haven't look at the booklet, but I know that corner flip method you
        mentioned works. Notice that (R' D' R D)x6 = I Also that move rotates
        UFR counterclockwise. So if you have three corners that need to go
        clockwise you do that move (R' D' R D)x4 on the first corner, then spin
        U, x4 for the second, spin U then x4 for the third. That's 12
        executions, so your bottom layer pieces will solve twice, and of course
        end solved. Three corners flipped counterclockwise will be 6 executions
        which is safe. Also 1 corner clockwise and one counterclockwise will
        likewise be 6 and so will 2 going each direction. Again I haven't look
        through the booklet, that would really stink if they've misprinted
        algorithms, but that corner flip method works. Though I think it
        wouldn't be too complicated to print the inverse rather than to say to
        do the alg 4 times (which is the equivalent of the inverse since it
        solves in 6 repetitions). Maybe they want to give the most basic
        solution possible to allow people room to think for themselves and come
        up with new things? Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,
