A very funny article, completely rubbish of course, who is this woman
anyway. I think she might be tracked down and taught a lesson or two.

    Gosh, I was so blind it's a pain in the brain...
Much better (cause pure):
(R U R' U') (l' U R U') (l r')

Similar situation, very fast:
(Rr) U R' U' (Rr)' R U R U' R'

I've recently seen someone solve the 4x4 by solving centers first, 
then pairing up edges and solving as 3x3 on the same time. But he had 
a hard time pairing the LL edges without breaking the "F2L"...

Cheers!

&gt; (Rr) U R' U' (Rr)'
&gt; That's very fast and pairs up all those edges. And if you follow it

 I can solve a 3*3*3 cube blindfolded. But, I do not know anything about 2*2*2 and 4*4*4. At last, I have a 4*4*4 cube in my hand after a year running after it.
Where can I get the notations and methods to solve it ?

    I need this info myself. My 2x2 has been in pieces for a month now,
and I can't work out how to put the damn thing together. Frankly, I
really don't like it much, but it's fun to show others, so having it

I'll write an article about it once someone teaches me - unless that

    Sounds like me. I have two broken cubes which I salvaged into one by 
using only the similar inner pieces.

Anyway, this question just came up yesterday among some of my cubing 
friends concerning their broken Bart Simpson 2x2x2 cube. I don't 
know how many of you have ever tried to assemble one, but all of the 
pieces are larger and each piece is the same. Theoretically, this 
should make it easier to assemble, since that's what I did to 
salvage one cube from my two. But I found it difficult to put 
together because of the size of the outer pieces, which restricted 
the movements of my fingers to snap the last piece in place. Has 
anyone tried this before and have any hints?

How about contacting Seventowns/whoever makes the cubes? They have 
to be assembled somehow without breaking.

Oh, and has anyone else noticed on the 2x2x2 that sometimes the side 
of an outer piece can come off? I think this might be the trick to 
assemble it, although I have yet to try it.

having a look.

So three of the sleeves are different, they are bigger.  Choose your
favorite cubie and put these three sleeves on that corner.  You will
notice that one of these three is slightly smaller, it goes on the
side that has a bump inside. (hope i'm making sense)

Now look at the axles, you will notice that three of them are fixed,
and cannot move.  These three go where the three big sleeves are on
your favorite cubie. Now add three more cubies with sleeves to
complete the bottome layer.  Keep adding cubies and sleeves until you
only have one cubie left.

Now for the hard part. Put the cubie over two sleeves, the third one
is difficult.  Turn the layer that you are putting the cubie on 45
degrees, just as when putting in the last edge peice on a 3x3x3.  Now
you have to push the peice rather hard, but also try to pull it up
over the sleeve, kind of coax it into place.

I hope that helps.

Good luck,
Evan

Until next time, Happy Cubing

&gt; know how many of you have ever tried to assemble one, but all of the 
&gt; pieces are larger and each piece is the same. Theoretically, this 
&gt; should make it easier to assemble, since that's what I did to

&gt; anyone tried this before and have any hints?
&gt; 
&gt; How about contacting Seventowns/whoever makes the cubes? They have 
&gt; to be assembled somehow without breaking.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, and has anyone else noticed on the 2x2x2 that sometimes the side 
&gt; of an outer piece can come off? I think this might be the trick to 
&gt; assemble it, although I have yet to try it.

    Hi,

my little brother and I got Rubik's cubes on xmas and I was able to 
solve it with a method I found online and my brother got so mad he 
smashed my cube against the wall and lots of pieces jumped out. Of 
course I took revenge and smashed his cube against the wall, too, but 
nothing happened, I needed a baseball bat to kill it. My cube is old 
(from my parents) and my brother got a new one, so now I'm wondering 
about the different cube quality. For this purpose, I ask all of you 
to smash a cube against a wall and tell me what happened and the type 
of cube. I will collect the data and publish the results soon.

Thank you,
John

    My cube contains something known as corbomite, which upon impact
transfers all energy back to wall leaving the cube unharmed and the

    Hi John,

   For Christmas I got a special DIY kit in a bag. Not only did it
have adjustable screws, it had plastic tiles instead of stickers. When
I threw it against the wall it assembled itself. The insert said that
Nanobots (TM) use the energy of an impact to assemble the cube. Pretty
neat! And sometimes when I yell at it loudly enough it solves itself.

    Hey dudes/guys/gals...,
This is just a suggestion, and I'm not accusing anyone or anything, but this is just for the good of the Professional Cubing community of the world.
I was considering if speedcubing.com received a record from an unknown person, then a slight 'something' of proof should be necessary.  (Unknown person would be someone that has not participated in any tournaments, and just "came out of nowhere", per se, or someone unfamiliar with the cubing community).  I just think keeping this as professional as possible will benefit everyone, since this is a sport of mastery and for some of us it isn't a mere game.  A 'something' of proof could be a simple video or something, I'm not sure.  But if "Joe Rookie" (a guy that has never been associated with and/or is unknown to the cubing community) said he did a 15 second average, that's intense information, and just posting the record on speedcubing.com out of blind faith is, in my opinion atleast, not enough.
Alot of the people are known on the speedcubing.com lists, and this post may not apply to most of us.
However, asking for a "something" of proof, will require more time and effort on the posting committee, which could be a problem, but solutions can be made about that.
Besides, the International Solitaire Ranking site requires a screenshot of the record you have made every time you post a record.
This is just a suggestion, any thoughts/plans?
Thanks, peace out :P.
-Brent

    I get the feeling you guys don't take this study very serious...

Anyway... my little brother got a new cube and also learned how to 
solve it (our parents made me show him the online solution). Today I 
took his solved cube and wrote this on it:

    !!I
    DIO
    T!!
TUR NTH ECE NTE
RSR IGH TYO UPA
THE TIC LOS ER!
    !!M
    ORO
    N!!

But I wrote the middle I of "IDIOT" rotated 90 degrees. Then I mixed 
the cube and gave it to my brother. He "solved" it and now he's been 
trying to get the centers right for several hours. He's getting more 
and more angry and frustrated. A lot of fun to watch.

    I think it's quite funny, actually. At first I thought you would pose us all
a little puzzle, but after closer reading I see that it is not.

 

Maybe someone could pose some cube puzzles in the group? For a bit of fun.
And perhaps make up a little story to go with them!

    Well it sure is a puzzle for my little brother. But here's one for 
you:

Solve THIS RANDOM SCRAMBLE to find out who stole my best cube, man!

I thought about writing it on a real cube but it didn't work well and 
it was hard enough to come up with already.

    Ahh... so that's what i've been doing wrong, the fixed ends point
towards those different slider pieces.  I never had a problem
reassembling the cube to begin with but i wasn't sure of those 3
different slider pieces and the direction of the middle piece and i
know that was why it locked up.  Well i reassembled the cube again and
so far it hasn't locked up so i'm happy and thanks Evan.  Perhaps i'll
make instruction guide in flash and post the link somewhere if
pictures and text don't seem to help anyone.

&gt; Ok, 2x2x2 assembly isntructions
&gt; a series of pictures is in the photos section somewhere.  If these
&gt; instructions aren't clear i would recomend finding those pictures and
&gt; having a look.
&gt; 
&gt; So three of the sleeves are different, they are bigger.  Choose your
&gt; favorite cubie and put these three sleeves on that corner.  You will
&gt; notice that one of these three is slightly smaller, it goes on the
&gt; side that has a bump inside. (hope i'm making sense)
&gt; 
&gt; Now look at the axles, you will notice that three of them are fixed,
&gt; and cannot move.  These three go where the three big sleeves are on
&gt; your favorite cubie. Now add three more cubies with sleeves to
&gt; complete the bottome layer.  Keep adding cubies and sleeves until you
&gt; only have one cubie left.
&gt; 
&gt; Now for the hard part. Put the cubie over two sleeves, the third one
&gt; is difficult.  Turn the layer that you are putting the cubie on 45
&gt; degrees, just as when putting in the last edge peice on a 3x3x3.  Now
&gt; you have to push the peice rather hard, but also try to pull it up
&gt; over the sleeve, kind of coax it into place.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope that helps.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,

&gt; &gt; Sounds like me. I have two broken cubes which I salvaged into one by 
&gt; &gt; using only the similar inner pieces.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway, this question just came up yesterday among some of my cubing 
&gt; &gt; friends concerning their broken Bart Simpson 2x2x2 cube. I don't 
&gt; &gt; know how many of you have ever tried to assemble one, but all of the 
&gt; &gt; pieces are larger and each piece is the same. Theoretically, this 
&gt; &gt; should make it easier to assemble, since that's what I did to 
&gt; &gt; salvage one cube from my two. But I found it difficult to put 
&gt; &gt; together because of the size of the outer pieces, which restricted 
&gt; &gt; the movements of my fingers to snap the last piece in place. Has 
&gt; &gt; anyone tried this before and have any hints?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How about contacting Seventowns/whoever makes the cubes? They have 
&gt; &gt; to be assembled somehow without breaking.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Oh, and has anyone else noticed on the 2x2x2 that sometimes the side 
&gt; &gt; of an outer piece can come off? I think this might be the trick to 
&gt; &gt; assemble it, although I have yet to try it.

    Hey everyone,

  I've been on &amp; off since the release of the cube, but only lately have I taken it more studiously. I don't consider myself a speedcuber yet. Although I've been in the process of learning the Fridrich Method (It seems to be the method of champions).
  I've memorized all the algs for the F2L and have recently started learning PLL algs. I used to average about 1:00 with my old method. I seem to be slowly reducing my times. Now I average around 55s with a hybrid Fridrich/Jasmine method.
  My question is how long should it normally take to memorize the Fridrich Method algs, and fully implement the Fridrich Method?

  My current goal would be to reduce my average to about 30s and maybe better. I know, I need to learn finger trick after the Fridrich Method. Any other advice, tricks or exercises would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks Dwayne

    Practice your F2L. If you can consistantly solve the F2L under 20
seconds, then solving under 30 seconds will be a piece of cake (even
when you have not learned all the OLL algs.)

    well dude,

first off, cool! :P your becoming a speedcuber.

next stop yeah, it will take you about 4 to 6 weeks to
fully implement and do f2l fast and also learn all pll
and at least about 7 or 9 out of the total of 57 oll
(the ones that have edge already oriented)

it takes time, but if you put in extreme dedication,
you can go from 1min to about 30sec in jsut 4 to 6
weeks, i know, i did it :P even failed one of my
college classes cos i spent more time cubing that
studying lol.

have fun.

    Ok i bought a 4x4x4 from Rubiks.com. I think it's fine. Just needs a little 
greasing. I tried solving it and i managed to finish matching all the edges. So 
when i start solving it like a 3x3x3, something is wrong when i get to OLL and 
PLL. I use the OLL algorithms which should have fixed up the LL but there is 
one corner twisted the wrong way. I notice that it is always twised the wrong 
direction in the OLL stage. So i looked the solution up online and ended up 
going to Chris Hardwick's page which had the solution and some very useful 
algorithms. The thing is, there is no algorithm to fix a messed up corner. He 
has one that fixes two corners when they are switched but the LL has to be 
finished for that. I cannot even finish the LL! 

Is it something wrong with my cube? Should i take that corner out and flip it 
and then try to solve it? Plz HELP!

    Welcome Dwayne,

It's always nice to see new cube adepts.
But sadly, everybody has only 1 idea in mind: Learn Fridrich's method,
and become a clone of the top speedcubers. Same sequences, same
fingertricks.
I'm *certain* it's possible to solve the cube in 15s with
significantly different systems.
Please, don't become a clone, there are already tons of them ;-)

    If a single corner is twisted, then you have to take it out and put it
in the right way.  It is impossible to have a single corner twisted.

    Maybe if we keep in mind that speedcubing.com is unofficial and based 
by just personal records.  The real list is the official rankings list

&gt; Hey dudes/guys/gals...,
&gt; This is just a suggestion, and I'm not accusing anyone or anything, 
&gt; but this is just for the good of the Professional Cubing community of 
&gt; the world.
&gt; I was considering if speedcubing.com received a record from an unknown 
&gt; person, then a slight 'something' of proof should be necessary.  
&gt; (Unknown person would be someone that has not participated in any 
&gt; tournaments, and just "came out of nowhere", per se, or someone 
&gt; unfamiliar with the cubing community).  I just think keeping this as 
&gt; professional as possible will benefit everyone, since this is a sport 
&gt; of mastery and for some of us it isn't a mere game.  A 'something' of 
&gt; proof could be a simple video or something, I'm not sure.  But if "Joe 
&gt; Rookie" (a guy that has never been associated with and/or is unknown 
&gt; to the cubing community) said he did a 15 second average, that's 
&gt; intense information, and just posting the record on speedcubing.com 
&gt; out of blind faith is, in my opinion atleast, not enough.
&gt; Alot of the people are known on the speedcubing.com lists, and this 
&gt; post may not apply to most of us.
&gt; However, asking for a "something" of proof, will require more time and 
&gt; effort on the posting committee, which could be a problem, but 
&gt; solutions can be made about that.
&gt; Besides, the International Solitaire Ranking site requires a 
&gt; screenshot of the record you have made every time you post a record.
&gt; This is just a suggestion, any thoughts/plans?
&gt; Thanks, peace out :P.

    hi all i know you will all get tired of hearing from me but i am 
happy i have been stuck at 45 second average for a very long time... 
but i got back into the cube and i am finally working on my f2l and 
in 2 weeks have  gotten my f2l down from 30 seconds to around 12-15 
second... on top of that i am looking at my solves and looking for 2 
oll's and one pll's that will help me every week... i'll work on 
those three maybe add a few more all week and practice them all week 
on saturday i will review and on sunday take averages... within 2 
week's i've dropped almost ten seconds and have regular sub 30 
solves...   my fastest still is only 25 seconds and my best average 
around 35 seconds but i think i'm doing pretty good....   oh yeah 
within 2 weeks i've changed from a 4 look ll to a 3 look ll   still 
working on it hopefully in a few more weeks i might be able to 
actually compete.....

    Hey guys.  Just as a warning, this topic isn't directly related to
cubing, but I don't think it'll be a problem.  I just found this site
at www.cardstacker.com where this guy named Bryan Berg makes
incredible designs with decks of cards.  This made me think of
cupstacking, which I know has been picked up by a few cubers (I hope
to try it out soon).  Maybe this is the next challenge for us cubers?

His store sells decks of cards designed for stacking, and Berg has
written a book about cardstacking.  The cards don't seem to be that
expensive, so maybe I'll give it a shot.  If anyone does try this, let
us know how it turns out.

    Hi Dwayne,
Simple shortcut methods that cut down the number of algorithms you need for
OLL and especially cna be found on
http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/cubertscubicle.  Even the simple L2L1
strategy cuts down the moves dramatically.  As well as making the number of
moves to memorise much smaller it also means that you cnas recognise the
positions much more quickly.  Its as few moves as Fridrich but just much
easier!  If you've already learned a lot of Fridrich then its even easier to
switch.

    There are a couple of different 5x5x5's you can buy on Mefferts.com.  
The mini-cube is very well made, but all of the layers have to be 
aligned near-perfect to get the darn thing to turn.  It's very easy to 
turn though, and a lot of people prefer these.  I don't know about the 
full-sized 5x5x5's at Mefferts.

The Rubiks.com 5x5x5's (from what I hear) tend to have very tight outer 
layers.  Personally I don't think they're as well made as the eastsheen 
5x5x5 cube (Mefferts mini-cube) but they're your best bet if you want 
one for legal tournament use.

I bought his book at the Toronto world championships. It is 
fascinating stuff. I was at a talk he gave (at the Gathering for 
Gardner 6 last year) about his cardstacking. It was highly 
entertaining, he was an unexpectedly good speaker.

He uses cheap cards, partly because he needs so many, but also 
because he found that they actually do work better than more 
expensive cards (not sure why, maybe because they are lighter). He 
chose the particular brand he sells because he liked the design.

    I also like to add this quote from the speedcubing.com rules-list:

"If we have serious doubts about record posts, then we may ask you 
to show some kind of proof of your abilities, before putting your 
record on the list." -  http://www.speedcubing.com/records/records-

So the suggested 'rule' already exists.

A 'something' of

if "Joe

speedcubing.com 
&gt; &gt; out of blind faith is, in my opinion atleast, not enough.
&gt; &gt; Alot of the people are known on the speedcubing.com lists, and 
this 
&gt; &gt; post may not apply to most of us.
&gt; &gt; However, asking for a "something" of proof, will require more 
time and 
&gt; &gt; effort on the posting committee, which could be a problem, but 
&gt; &gt; solutions can be made about that.
&gt; &gt; Besides, the International Solitaire Ranking site requires a

&gt; &gt; This is just a suggestion, any thoughts/plans?

    Hi everybody,

I have been practicing the 2x2 again lately, and I am wondering if I 
should also count lucky cases in my average, or what the definition 
of a lucky case on the 2x2 cube really is. I just took an average 5 
minutes ago: 12 solves, including 3 'lucky' cases (cases where I 
could skip one step). 

I use Geatan Guimonds method, which is basically a three-step 
solution. The first two steps are often just 3 moves, and I think 
the chances of skipping one step are much bigger than with the 
Fridrich method on the 3x3... So, what do you all think?

    Hi,

Are you sure the cube was solved when it came out of the package? I 
am not sure if really understand what you mean, but you really make 
it sound like you have a corner twist. If you can solve seven 
corners (their position and orientation), than the last corner is 
solved as well. If this is not the case, the cube is unsolvable. You 
can fix this by taking you cube apart, and putting it back together 
again.

    Hi Chris,

I would like to ask two questions about this video.

1)Did you skip PLL? The first time that i saw the top face oriented 
was at the very end. I think I also know the orientation that you 
applied, even though I don't know Fridrich :)

2)What was the piano music at the beginning and at the end? (bit of 
a strange question, isn't it?)

Sebastian

PS. I considered to skip the part where I say Wow! What a cool 
video! since I didn't have any good formulations for it. Sorry about 
that!

P.S. Or invent your own way. But it might help to know other 
solutions, partly because then you know you're doing something new... 
Should I ever finish learning full Fridrich, I'll probably learn 
Gilles' method next...

    People only cheat themselves if they lie on speedcubing.com.  When they 
get to a competition and they can't perform even remotely close to what 
they claim, we start to speculate and I think that's the worst feeling 
to have hanging over your head.  If someone has a sub-20 average and 
they can't manage to solve a cube under 30 seconds, well, that's a good 
clue that they aren't telling the truth.  Furthermore, if you lie, it 
makes it all together more difficult for you to go to a competition and 
you will be left out of all the fun that everyone else has been having.

Stefan :-) I don't need a mini-me (but if a younger and more talented
cuber wants to try it my way, I think it has some potential).
Of course learning Fridrich is not a crime. But there are different
methods that allow you to become sub-20. And how many top cubers are
using them?
Even before starting to think, people are taught to learn F2L+OLL+PLL.
Why not F2L+CLL+ELL? Has it really been proven to be much slower? Who
is using it except Masayuki and Guus? At least, this approach requires
fewer sequences, and many corner sequences can be used in different
solving methods.
And what about methods like Waterman's. Is Josef the only one who's
using it nowadays?
Corners-first is another option (Ron, are you still interested in
trying it for real?).  The problem of corners-first comes from edges,
but I feel there are still tricks to find out (inserting/adding slice
moves in corner sequences, or preserved pre-orientation, or...).

I can understand that people have more interesting things to do in
their lives than to look for original cube tricks, but I would prefer
to see 15 slightly different cubing styles and videos in the 15s-20s
range than 10 more sub-15 clones (by that time, Macky will be sub-13) ;-)

    Hi!

I also recieved my DIY cube-kit from Rubiks.com a few days ago. My 
core/axel was in white plastic. I didn't have any problems with the 
screw. They fit quite nicely into the core at the correct friction, 
so they won't unscrew themselves easily.

My only gripe with those DIY kits is that it is troublesome to fit 
the centercaps. What i did was to cut off the "feet". And also remove 
the extra "support bridge". Then i glued them to the centers after 
adjusting the cube tension carefully. I did this with all edges and 
corners removed, so as not to spill glue on them. Then i sanded, no i 
used a knife ... hehe ..., the edges of the caps cause some edges 
were slightly sticking out. Then i added the stickers to them.

The cube now turns beautifully, and it's as good as my normal racing 
cube even before breaking it in properly :-)

One suggestion though. My kit came with hollow corners. There is no 
need to glue on the caps that are suplied for them. If u glue them on 
it will only create more friction, besides making the cube heavier :-
P But from reading the posts here it seems that the kits vary somehow 
in content and quality ??

Kind regards,

-Per

PS! It seems that i got the real vinyl stickers too :-)
PPS! Some late nite practice yesterday gave me real good times :-)

those

&gt; 
&gt; I just got a DIY from Rubiks.com as well. I too recieved paper

&gt; convincing is needed. It took a little force to get screws in as 
well.
&gt; In the end, the finished cube was acceptable, but no better than the

    Hi everybody,

I think all post must mentionned all 12 times for the average, this 
is not the case for the moment.... And it will be good to send a 
screenshot of the timer (to moderators of speedcubing.com) to prove 
the credibility of the record.

Another thing:
Refresh the list all 3-4 month and deleted the records that haven't 
be updated. Some cubers have stop to cube and records are here again.

Are past glories not worth anything ?? Why on earth remove from list 
old records? I don't see the point. A simpler thing is to add a date 
field to the lists so u can work out urself how u compare with recent 
results. But anyway that would not be really meaningful. Cause most 
of those who have posted good times are still capable of good times 
that won't be posted.

Just my thoughts ...

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I also recieved my DIY cube-kit from Rubiks.com a few days ago. My 
&gt; core/axel was in white plastic. I didn't have any problems with the 
&gt; screw. They fit quite nicely into the core at the correct friction, 
&gt; so they won't unscrew themselves easily.
&gt; 
&gt; My only gripe with those DIY kits is that it is troublesome to fit 
&gt; the centercaps. What i did was to cut off the "feet". And also remove 
&gt; the extra "support bridge". Then i glued them to the centers after 
&gt; adjusting the cube tension carefully. I did this with all edges and 
&gt; corners removed, so as not to spill glue on them. Then i sanded, no i 
&gt; used a knife ... hehe ..., the edges of the caps cause some edges 
&gt; were slightly sticking out. Then i added the stickers to them.
&gt; 
&gt; The cube now turns beautifully, and it's as good as my normal racing 
&gt; cube even before breaking it in properly :-)
&gt; 
&gt; One suggestion though. My kit came with hollow corners. There is no 
&gt; need to glue on the caps that are suplied for them. If u glue them on 
&gt; it will only create more friction, besides making the cube heavier :-
&gt; P But from reading the posts here it seems that the kits vary somehow 
&gt; in content and quality ??
&gt; 

I put a picture of the kit on my site:
http://grrroux.free.fr/workshop/workshop.html
Other pictures on Jon Morris' site (different screws):
http://www.geocities.com/nascarjon2001/dyi.htm

It looks perfect. 15 minutes after assembling it (+sandpaper) I was
averaging 16s.
Don't know what's best. With or without corner caps? Sure there are
more contact surfaces, but flat ones, and with lubricant it's not a
problem. I'd like to test a cube with edge cubies that are not hollow.

&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; 
&gt; -Per
&gt; 
&gt; PS! It seems that i got the real vinyl stickers too :-)
&gt; PPS! Some late nite practice yesterday gave me real good times :-)

I don't really believe there are a lot of cheaters on the lists... 
Especially in the highest positions... I don't really understand 
what could be fun about cheating if you are a cuber anyway.

Like Tyson said, it is an unofficial list, and it will always be 
unofficial, simply because it's about records being set at peoples 
homes, and nobody can verify them.

12 times do not prove anything, nor screenshots, and make the tables
full of useless figures. Standard deviations are enough.

    About those corners,

I did glue those caps on them. They did not really 'fit like a 
glove', so I had to remove some rough edges with a knife.

Still have problems with those centre caps though. Maybe I'll try to 
do it your way when I have more time :).

It looks pretty nice! I really like to try it :)...

13 things you may not know about the puzzle.
1 - The Bedlam Cube has 19,186 different solutions!

Hmm.. That doesn't really sound like a Rubik's cube, does it? With 
so many solutions, it can't be that hard! :p

13 - The Bedlam Cube is the hardest &amp; most addictive 3-D Puzzle 
Ever...come and enter the world of Bedlam!

Most addictive? Probably not...

    I had trouble with the caps as well.  I found if I mixed and matched 
with various sides and tried different orientations, they seemed to 
fit better if you could find a good match.  Some caps worked better 
on different sides for some reason.

    I should fix those caps once and for all ...

I also glued the corner caps on. I like my cube to be 'complete' if
you know what I mean, and the extra friction is negligable. The cube
is not extremely good, it feels like I never have to fiddle with it
again. I love it... I even set a new avg-of-50 record with it
yesterday. Flat centers? Pfft... gimme my DIY, I say! :P

    Well, that was a bad typo. It was supposed to say: "the cube is _NOW_
extremely good."

As for other news, I made myself a cube case yesterday. Looks sort of
nice, though I will improve the thing. :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also recieved my DIY cube-kit from Rubiks.com a few days ago. 
&gt; &gt; My 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; core/axel was in white plastic. I didn't have any problems with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; screw. They fit quite nicely into the core at the correct 
&gt; &gt; &gt; friction, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so they won't unscrew themselves easily.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My only gripe with those DIY kits is that it is troublesome to 
&gt; &gt; fit 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the centercaps. What i did was to cut off the "feet". And also 
&gt; &gt; &gt; remove 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the extra "support bridge". Then i glued them to the centers 
&gt; &gt; after 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adjusting the cube tension carefully. I did this with all edges 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corners removed, so as not to spill glue on them. Then i sanded, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; no i 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used a knife ... hehe ..., the edges of the caps cause some edges 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were slightly sticking out. Then i added the stickers to them.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The cube now turns beautifully, and it's as good as my normal 
&gt; &gt; &gt; racing 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cube even before breaking it in properly :-)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One suggestion though. My kit came with hollow corners. There is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; no 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need to glue on the caps that are suplied for them. If u glue 
&gt; &gt; them 
&gt; &gt; &gt; on 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it will only create more friction, besides making the cube 
&gt; &gt; &gt; heavier :-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; P But from reading the posts here it seems that the kits vary

    It seems that they have changed the DIY kits slightly since I 
purchased mine.  Appears that the screws are different now and my 
corners were complete, no caps for them.  I also had trouble with 
the center caps and had to adjust them with an exacto knife to make 
them work.  As far as the sticker issue goes...  There are two kits 
available from rubiks.com: "Rubik's 3x3 Assembly Cube w/Lube" for 
$8.99, and "Rubik's 3x3 Assembly Cube w/Lube&amp;Stickers" for $10.99.  
The more expesive set comes with two sets of PVC stickers and it 
doesn't say, but I assume that the cheaper one comes with the paper 
stickers.  Maybe someone can verify this.  All in all I really like 
my DIY cubes too.

    I know, I know... that's why in my P.S. I mentioned he could invent 
his own method. But I think learning your method would be good, too. 
Not only for the person learning it but for the cubing community, 
because it could make the community (and especially newbies) more 
aware of different methods. Plus, I do think your method looks very 
nice. And it does include CLL, right? So to learn CLL+ELL I'd only 
need to add ELL...

Cheers!

&gt; 
&gt; Stefan :-) I don't need a mini-me (but if a younger and more 
talented
&gt; cuber wants to try it my way, I think it has some potential).
&gt; Of course learning Fridrich is not a crime. But there are different
&gt; methods that allow you to become sub-20. And how many top cubers are
&gt; using them?
&gt; Even before starting to think, people are taught to learn 
F2L+OLL+PLL.
&gt; Why not F2L+CLL+ELL? Has it really been proven to be much slower? 
Who
&gt; is using it except Masayuki and Guus? At least, this approach 
requires
&gt; fewer sequences, and many corner sequences can be used in different
&gt; solving methods.
&gt; And what about methods like Waterman's. Is Josef the only one who's
&gt; using it nowadays?
&gt; Corners-first is another option (Ron, are you still interested in
&gt; trying it for real?).  The problem of corners-first comes from 
edges,
&gt; but I feel there are still tricks to find out (inserting/adding 
slice
&gt; moves in corner sequences, or preserved pre-orientation, or...).
&gt; 
&gt; I can understand that people have more interesting things to do in
&gt; their lives than to look for original cube tricks, but I would 
prefer
&gt; to see 15 slightly different cubing styles and videos in the 15s-20s
&gt; range than 10 more sub-15 clones (by that time, Macky will be 
sub-13) ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Gilles.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers!
&gt; &gt; Stefan
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; P.S. Or invent your own way. But it might help to know other 
&gt; &gt; solutions, partly because then you know you're doing something 
new... 
&gt; &gt; Should I ever finish learning full Fridrich, I'll probably learn 
&gt; &gt; Gilles' method next...

&gt; &gt; &gt; But sadly, everybody has only 1 idea in mind: Learn Fridrich's

&gt; &gt; &gt; and become a clone of the top speedcubers. Same sequences, same

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm *certain* it's possible to solve the cube in 15s with
&gt; &gt; &gt; significantly different systems.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey everyone,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   I've been on &amp; off since the release of the cube, but only 
&gt; &gt; lately
&gt; &gt; &gt; have I taken it more studiously. I don't consider myself a 
&gt; &gt; speedcuber
&gt; &gt; &gt; yet. Although I've been in the process of learning the Fridrich 
&gt; &gt; Method
&gt; &gt; &gt; (It seems to be the method of champions).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   I've memorized all the algs for the F2L and have recently 
&gt; &gt; started
&gt; &gt; &gt; learning PLL algs. I used to average about 1:00 with my old 
method. 
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be slowly reducing my times. Now I average around 55s 
with a
&gt; &gt; &gt; hybrid Fridrich/Jasmine method.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   My question is how long should it normally take to memorize 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fridrich Method algs, and fully implement the Fridrich Method?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   My current goal would be to reduce my average to about 30s 
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; maybe better. I know, I need to learn finger trick after the 
&gt; &gt; Fridrich
&gt; &gt; &gt; Method. Any other advice, tricks or exercises would be greatly
&gt; &gt; &gt; appreciated.

*Certainly* not... it might be the most boring maybe... I mean, c'mon, 
it's not even a new idea and this kind of puzzle is so boring and 
making it bigger only makes it more boring.

    More like the worst way to solve it. Devil's algorithm is an imagined
algorithm that, by being applied over and over again, sorts through
every single possible position so that you are bound to solve it if
you keep at it long enough.

I've thought about it a little and may give it a shot.

    My opinion on the DIY kit I bought while ago. It came with the
greenish teal kernel and corner caps on. Yes, those center caps are
horrible. I'm not sure on this but it seems like those little support
triangles on the caps actually hit the circular plastic things that
sticks up in the center piece before the cap is on tight, thus making
it impossible to put them on without modifications! For the record, it
was the 10.99 kit. I also didn't like the fact that the yellow and
orange stickers were a bit transparent making them look darker and
dull. The cube was pretty good. Like all cubes with arched centers,
they lock up more frequently  wich prevents me from reaching my full
cubing potential, but the lack of popping associated with that is
nice. But then I dropped it on the floor from 4 feet high max and it
broke-The kernel actually split in half and now I have don't have a
good speedcube:(  Summaruy: center caps-bad. Cube-decent.
Stickers-okay. Durability-bad(at least in my experience).

    How about a devil's algorithm that cycles through every LL situation
while leaving the F2L intact. That would most likely be easier to find

    If you find it, please don't post it here. Assuming it looks random, 
it'd take a lot of memory:

M = 12!*2^12*8!*3^8/12/1260 = 3.43*10^16
That's the minimum number of moves it'd need.

B = M*log2(18)/8 = 1.789*10^16
That's the number of bytes.

B/2^50 = 15.89

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; B = M*log2(18)/8 = 1.789*10^16
&gt; &gt; &gt; That's the number of bytes.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; B/2^50 = 15.89
&gt; &gt; &gt; That's the number of petabytes. Btw, peta comes after tera, 
which 
&gt; &gt; &gt; comes after giga.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; B/(300*2^30) = 55546
&gt; &gt; &gt; The number of 300GB hard drives needed to store the algorithm.

    *Sigh*, always the assumptions ruin my hour of triumph! :)

CO stands for Corner Orientation. COC1 twists UFR clockwise and UBR
counterclockwise. COC2 does the same, but with UFL instead of UFR. The
idea is the same with COCs 2 to 7. They all twist one corner clockwise
and UBR counterclockwise. By applying COC1 three times (which is
COT1), we can iterate through the three possible orientations for the
first corner. By applying COC2 three times, with COT1 inbetween each
time, we iterate through all possible orientations for the first two
corners. And so on... up to seven. The last corner we can ignore since
its orientation is decided by the others. So, COT7, which I have
called CO, will cycle through all possible orientations of all the
corners.

The idea is similar with the EO algorithms, except that in EOT1, CO is
called. This means that EOT11 (which by now is getting freakishly
long, and I have called simply "O") cycles through all possible
orientations of all the pieces. So now, we only need to cycle through
all permutations, and apply O once for each of them.

The EP algorithms does that with the edges. EP (EPT12) is a 12 cycle
of edges (EPC12) done 12 times with EPT11 done once inbetween each.
EPT11 is an 11-cycle (EPC11) done 11 times with EPT10 done once
inbetween each... and so on. At the lowest level (EPT2), O is invoked.
For each even cycle, two corners are also swapped, but they're the
same two corners all the time. The edge that is left untouched by the
11-cycle is also left untouched by all the others, etc. (This is
important, I reckon.)

Now, EP is then an algorithm which, given a cube with correct corner
permutation, will eventually produce the solved cube. The CP
algorithms work excactly the same as the EP ones. At the lowest CP
level (CPT2), EP is invoked.

So.. there you go. I think it should work.

&gt; Of course learning Fridrich is not a crime. But there are different

   I'm not a top cuber yet, but I think my method can be quick.

&gt; Even before starting to think, people are taught to learn F2L+OLL+PLL.

   I think people should be encouraged to solve the cube on their own
before lerning omeone else's methods.

&gt; Why not F2L+CLL+ELL? Has it really been proven to be much slower? Who
&gt; is using it except Masayuki and Guus? 

   I do last level corners then edges. 

&gt; At least, this approach requires
&gt; fewer sequences, and many corner sequences can be used in different
&gt; solving methods.
&gt; And what about methods like Waterman's. Is Josef the only one who's
&gt; using it nowadays?
&gt; Corners-first is another option (Ron, are you still interested in
&gt; trying it for real?).  The problem of corners-first comes from edges,
&gt; but I feel there are still tricks to find out (inserting/adding slice
&gt; moves in corner sequences, or preserved pre-orientation, or...).
&gt; 
&gt; I can understand that people have more interesting things to do in
&gt; their lives than to look for original cube tricks, but I would prefer
&gt; to see 15 slightly different cubing styles and videos in the 15s-20s
&gt; range than 10 more sub-15 clones (by that time, Macky will be
sub-13) ;-)

   Ever try edges first?

    Ok, thanks a lot. Very very nice! Actually I've once done something 
quite similar a while ago, so I should've had that idea, too :-) Damn.
..

You've built it bottom-up... I think it's also a nice idea to look at 
it top-down. The algorithm first "chooses" a certain corner to place 
at some spot by cycling all corners through that spot. For each choice 
made, it chooses the next corner to place at the next spot. And so on. 
Same with edges (for each choice of all corners, choose all edges). 
And then deeper inside (or "later") "choose" the orientations of all 
pieces, one by one.

Hmm, do you remember that the cube group can be generated by just two 
different algorithms? I.e. two algorithms that you combine a lot to 
get to any state you want. I'm not sure I have an idea for a much 
shorter Devil's algorithm than yours, but maybe for one that can be 
described shorter. Based on those two algs.

I don't remember the exact two algs, but I think the idea was this: Do 
you know these sushi restaurants where lots of plates with some sushi 
run around in a long chain and people pick out what they want? Now 
imagine you're the only one sitting next to that cycle of plates and 
you already hold one in your hand. The plates are running around all 
the time and from time to time you pick one out and replace it with 
the one in your hand. This way you can easily create any order you 
want, it just may take a while. The two algs work just like that, but 
you have one cycle on your left with seven corners and one cycle on 
your right with eleven edges. And you hold one corner in your left 
hand and one edge in your right hand. Both cycles cycle with the same 
speed, and whenever you want, you replace both the corner and the edge 
currently next to you in the cycles with those in your hands. One of 
the two algs does the cycles (i.e. cycles seven corners and eleven 
edges). The other alg does the swaps, i.e. swaps the left out corner 
with a certain corner position in the cycle and same for edges. For 
example, this second alg could just be the T-permutation swapping (UL,
UR) and (URF,UBR) and the first alg could cycle all corners but URF 
and all edges but UR.

Why should this work? Let's talk about permutation only. It should be 
clear from the sushi example that you can get any order when you're 
just dealing with one cycle. But with the two cycles we can "simulate" 
that they move independently, even though they're not. Consider 
cycling both by one position, but do it 22 times. That will not change 
the edges (just cycle them completely two times) but it will cycle the 
corners completely three times and one more position. To cycle the 
edges one position forwards, move both cycles 56 forwards. Why does it 
work, why can we move them independently? Because 7 and 11 are 
relatively prime.

How about orientation? This is actually not covered yet. We need to 
modify the above construction. The algorithm that moves the cycles one 
step forward must also do some orientation. For the edges, imagine 
that they don't cycle on a "normal" strip, but on a Moebius strip 
(http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MoebiusStrip.html). That is, the cycle 
is not a normal 11-cycle, but at some point it twists 180 degrees. So 
after 11 iterations, the edges are in the original position but all 
flipped. After 22 iterations they're the same. For this to work we 
also need to flip the edge in your hand, though, i.e. the one at UR. 
For corners, we do the same, but we "open" the cycle somewhere to 
include a clockwise twist and twist the corner in our hand (i.e. at 
URF) counterclockwise.

The claim is that everything can be done independently:
1) Move edge cycle one forward without flipping edges, and leave 
corners completely intact.
2) Move corner cycle one forward.
3) Flip all edges.
4) Twist all corners.

This is how that's done:
3) Apply the alg 11*7*3 = 231 times. Thanks to factor 11, the edges 
will stay at their place. Thanks to 7, corners will stay. Thanks to 3, 
corners won't be twisted. Since 231 is odd, edges will be flipped.
4) Apply it 11*7*2 = 154 times.
1) Apply it 7*3*10 = 210 times. Thanks to 7*3, corners won't be 
changed. Since 210 is even, edges won't be flipped. Since 210=19*11+1, 
the edges will make 19 complete cycles plus one more step forwards.
2) Apply it 11*2*15 = 330 times. Since 330=47*7+1, corners will make 
47 complete cycles plus one more step.

And why does it work? Why is it all independent? Because 11, 7, 2 and 
3 are all relatively prime.

Ok, I think I'd better stop for a moment and continue with the 
original idea of using this for the Devil's algorithm in another post.
..

Cheers!
Stefan

    I would have thought that the "devil's algorithm" would be the 
shortest way to cycle through all N positions of the cube, i.e. a 
move sequence N-1 moves long that never repeats any position. (Here N 
is 43 quintillion and something.)

It has not been proven (im)possible as far as I know. For the

the cube.
One of these days I'll try to do one on a 2x2x2 cube.

Stefan: Nice... your's a bit more elegant :). The Pi idea might
actually  work, but good luck on proving it. ;)

    The cross, more than any other step, requires lots of "real" practice
to  get right. I.e. you can work on the LL without actually having
done the F2L first, but the best idea for cross + F2L is actually just
to mix up the cube and go at it. Remember that the cross is an
integral part of the F2L, they should never be separated. By
practicing your cross, you should also practice your F2L and vice versa.

In the beginning, spend more than 15 seconds preinspecting so that you
can start making out complete crosses before actually turning a side.
Your preinspection times will gradually improve. Look for ways to do
two things at once. Also, though you may do this already, it often
helps to put down the cross edges disregarding the middle layer
centers, and just putting the edges down relative to each other, and
finishing off with a turn of the D layer to line them up correctly.

Dan has a nice cross tutorial at:

A horrible (but trivial) alternative is just to simulate a depth-
first search: consider a sequence of identities, beginning with

E1 = F F F F U U U U R R R R B B B B L L L L D D D D 

which produces all states at depth 1. We might as well abbreviate it 
to

E1 = F4 U4 R4 B4 L4 D4

Then

E2 = (F E1)4 (U E1)4 (R E1)4 (B E1)4 (L E1)4 (D E1)4
E3 = (F E2)4 (U E2)4 (R E2)4 (B E2)4 (L E2)4 (D E2)4

...and so on, up to E29.  You can see that performing En will produce 
all the states at depths up to and including n.  Since we know (from 
Mike Reid's work) that the diameter of the Rubik's cube group is no 
more than 29 (HTM), applying E29 will solve any position at some 
point.

E29 is so long anyway that it is scarcely worth making the obvious 
modifications to account for commuting moves.

Question: Is there a neater way to specify a sequence that simulates 
a depth-first search?

Though I think in the recursion steps you should do all 18 
possibilities, not only six.

It gave me the idea of using this with my two algs:
Let AC be the algorithm for cycling.
Let AS be the algorithm for swapping.
Let A(0) be the empty algorithm.
Let A(n+1) = AC A(n) AC' AS A(n) AS'.
Find the maximum number N of applications needed to reach any state 
with combinations of AC and AS. It must exist because every state can 
be reached in a finite number of applications.
Let the Devil's algorithm be A(N).

Ok, I'm stupid. You already do all.

But you could write it a bit shorter using A(0), then A(1) can be

A(0) = empty algorithm

I have finally created some pages about advanced F2L stuff, for your
perusal. It is not quite complete yet, but since I have been working on it
quite a lot I think it is only fair to release what I have written for you
to work on!

 

I hope you all find it useful, please let me know what you think.

 

You can find it from my website www.cubestation.co.uk
&lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/&gt;  and click on the F2L link in the orange

Keep it fun!

    That's great work so far Dan. I have actually been awaiting these
articles for some time now. In particular I will be interested in
sections 4 and 5, most of the other stuff I already know. How
tragically ironic then, that these are the only ones you haven't
written yet. (Read: Get back to writing!) ;)

    Hi Dan,

thanks a lot for your effort, even though you're a bit too late for me 
with some of it ;-) Now my comments...

2. Empty Slots
--------------
I love (r' R U' R' F R U R' r), thanks a lot :-) Though I might prefer 
to pull M' with my left ring finger instead of doing (R' r). But only 
practice will show me what's better for me...

3. Solve from all angles
---------------------
You say "you must imagine the movement which your hands have to do". I 
think this is a bit misleading. What you should really know is how the 
pieces move and why they move that way. This does get clearer in the 
examples but I think your introduction is unnecessary confusing. Well, 
maybe I just think so because I didn't learn the F2L algs without 
understanding them. If someone does that and all he knows is what his 
hands do, then maybe your text is good.

How on earth do you execute (F' U F) ?!? That just feels wrong ;-) I 
mean, honestly, do you do that? How???

Also, FR-F3 might not be the best example, as I'm sure the 2nd and 4th 
angle cases should really be solved as (y' R' U R U' R' U' R) and (y 
R' U R U L' U' L) instead. But even Lars Petrus doesn't seem to like 
it ;-) See http://lar5.com/cube/fas4.html section "Advanced", first 
example on the left.

Similarly, I'm convinced the second angle for BL-R5 should be solved 
as (y' R' U' R L' U L).

General
-------
It would be nice to have some explicit examples to practice. I'm not 
asking you to describe more examples in the great detail you do, but 
just maybe provide "exercises", i.e. some cases we can try to solve 
ourselves and maybe including as a hint the number of moves we should 
try to achieve (or other goals like not rotating the cube)

All that said, thanks again for all your effort you put in your pages. 
I hope one day I'll master it all, too, currently my F2L is maybe 
around 16 seconds...

Cheers!
Stefan

    One more question. When you say the "fastest cubers can routinely 
solve the F2L in 8-10 seconds", does that include the time for the 
cross or not?

    Thanks. I just asked because Dan explicitly separates cross and F2L 
into two different chapters in his solution pages and the second 
chapter is called F2L so it looks a bit like F2L doesn't include the 
cross but is a separate step.

Cheers!

    Yes that's right, perhaps I should have made that clearer. but I was
including the cross also.

 

I like your ideas about the "exercises", I shall include them for each
section, especially the early ones.

 

*       I love (r' R U' R' F R U R' r), thanks a lot :-)

 

Yes, that's a cool algorithm, I only use it for the final pair however
because it doesn't give you a very good view of the pieces while you are
solving it. If the UL and UR edges are up, then that algorithm (or it's
equivalent into the FR slot) will orient all the edges.

 

*       3. Solve from all angles
---------------------
You say "you must imagine the movement which your hands have to do".

 

I did have trouble putting it into words! It's probably not the best
description, maybe I will find something better tomorrow.

 

*       Well, 
maybe I just think so because I didn't learn the F2L algs without 
understanding them.

 

That's very true. I can see how this wouldn't be relevant for someone who
learnt the algorithms like you, but for some poor cuber like me who just
blindly learnt the F2L algs from Peter Jansen it's definitely the way to go
:-)

 

F' U F is pretty awkward I know, but I was just trying to demonstrate the
point. In practice I would probably rotate slightly one way or the other,
and do it like that with cramped hands ;)

 

There's always tomorrow, I'm glad you liked them :D

 

Dan :-)

Hi Dan,

thanks for your answers, but this one still keeps me wondering. Do you 
do it as (F' U F) or rotate 90 degrees (what do you mean with 
"slightly"?) and then do it with L or R? I'm serious about this, I've 
been wondering whether people do this or not even before your new 
articles. It's horrible to do, but I don't need to rotate the cube 
(which takes time and may be bad because all pieces/slots move around 
with it) so maybe it's really an advantage?

Cheers!
Stefan

    I would turn the cube as I place it.  Turning the cube is alright, if 
it helps you to look ahead.  I can't vouch personally for that, but I

    nice page dan :P

about moving the cube around, yeah i do that a couple
of time especially if F' U F moves are suppose to be
done i turn the cube so i have to do R' U R, idk it
just seems faster to me hehe

&gt; &gt; Hi Dan,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; thanks for your answers, but this one still keeps
&gt; me wondering. Do 
&gt; you 
&gt; &gt; do it as (F' U F) or rotate 90 degrees (what do
&gt; you mean with 
&gt; &gt; "slightly"?) and then do it with L or R? I'm
&gt; serious about this, 
&gt; I've 
&gt; &gt; been wondering whether people do this or not even
&gt; before your new 
&gt; &gt; articles. It's horrible to do, but I don't need to
&gt; rotate the cube 
&gt; &gt; (which takes time and may be bad because all
&gt; pieces/slots move 
&gt; around 
&gt; &gt; with it) so maybe it's really an advantage?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers!
&gt; &gt; Stefan

    Hey Stefan

 

You know, it really depends on what moves come before something like F' U F.
If the move was say R F' U F, you wouldn't need to rotate at all, it is
quite natural to make R and then push F' with your thumb, and then follow
your thumb round and push U with your thumb again, and finally push F back
down with your right index finger. If the move was R' F U'. it's easy to do
also. The same applies for L F'. and L' F.

 

If I had to begin a trick with an F move though, most likely I would rotate
the cube very slightly, change grip to holding the B side (which is pointing
NE as you look at it) with my right hand, and perform the F moves with my
left hand. The advantage with this is the view of the cube doesn't change.
Although you have had to change grip, you would have to do this anyway if
you were to rotate and perform it on R or on L, and you have the small
advantage of keeping the same view.

 

Dan :-)

    Hey!

I haven't really been follwing this thread ;-) Has it been proven 
that this recurrence relation will end up with a scramble actually 
passing through all possible cube-states? It seems not trivial to 
prove that ... Or hmm ... just came to think of something.

A(0) is even.
A(1) is even. 64 quarterturns.
And likewise every A(n), n&gt;1 will also be even.

So it seems half the states ...

Ha, i'm stupid. It's not the ENDSTATE of each A(i) we are interested 
in. We will certainly pass through just as many odd states on our way 
towards the end of each A(i).

OK, so the problem still remains ...

Happy cubing (just don't cube the A(i)'s ... lol)

&gt;    It seems that they have changed the DIY kits slightly since I 
&gt; purchased mine.  Appears that the screws are different now and my 
&gt; corners were complete, no caps for them.  I also had trouble with 
&gt; the center caps and had to adjust them with an exacto knife to make 
&gt; them work.  As far as the sticker issue goes...  There are two kits 
&gt; available from rubiks.com: "Rubik's 3x3 Assembly Cube w/Lube" for 
&gt; $8.99, and "Rubik's 3x3 Assembly Cube w/Lube&amp;Stickers" for $10.99.  
&gt; The more expesive set comes with two sets of PVC stickers


I ordered some last month, and stickers are not PVC ones. It's still
the same old shit with a transparent film and a kind of colored paper
under!
(thin PVC stickers are no better - too thin, too dark)
(I don't know you, but before the cube the only problem I had in my
life with stickers was to remove them)


&gt; and it 
&gt; doesn't say, but I assume that the cheaper one comes with the paper 
&gt; stickers.


Don't assume too much, no sticker sets in the cheaper ones ;-)


&gt; Maybe someone can verify this.  All in all I really like 
&gt; my DIY cubes too.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also recieved my DIY cube-kit from Rubiks.com a few days 
&gt; ago. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; core/axel was in white plastic. I didn't have any problems 
&gt; with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; screw. They fit quite nicely into the core at the correct 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friction, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so they won't unscrew themselves easily.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My only gripe with those DIY kits is that it is 
&gt; troublesome to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fit 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the centercaps. What i did was to cut off the "feet". And 
&gt; also 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remove 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the extra "support bridge". Then i glued them to the 
&gt; centers 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adjusting the cube tension carefully. I did this with all 
&gt; edges 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corners removed, so as not to spill glue on them. Then i 
&gt; sanded, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no i 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used a knife ... hehe ..., the edges of the caps cause 
&gt; some edges 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were slightly sticking out. Then i added the stickers to 
&gt; them.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The cube now turns beautifully, and it's as good as my 
&gt; normal 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; racing 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cube even before breaking it in properly :-)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One suggestion though. My kit came with hollow corners. 
&gt; There is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need to glue on the caps that are suplied for them. If u 
&gt; glue 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it will only create more friction, besides making the cube 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heavier :-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; P But from reading the posts here it seems that the kits 
&gt; vary 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somehow 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in content and quality ??
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Hey everyone,

Does a two generator scramble generator exist?  I know I could just 
use a normal 3x3x3 scramble generator, start on R say, and use the 
turn sign of each move in the given alg and alternate faces U,R,U,R 
etc., but I think it would be cool if there was one that generated a 
scramble with just U's and R's.  I'd try to write one but my 
programming knowledge is dismal.

I guess it would also have to be length 25 or greater (I think I 
remember someone saying recently that the max depth of 2-gen was 25 
moves).

Anyway I just thought I would ask since there are some very good 
programmers among this group ;-)  It doesn't have to have any nice 
graphics or display, just as long as it can generate a bunch of 2-
gen algs that would be totally cool.  (hint hint, help!!) ;-)

Thanks,
Chris

I don't know of any. As a stopgap you could use my applet:
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cubie.htm

Choose the two-generator option, and click the 'solution' button at 
the bottom left to change it to 'generator'.

Now press mix, and press solve.

This will give a completely fair mix (all 2gen positions equally 
likely), but the generator will be optimal.

Yes, it is simply a depth-first search, 29 turns deep, to be 
performed by hand (see my first post in this thread). 29 is the 
current upper bound on the length of God's algorithm, so will improve 
with time -- not that that matters particularly! 

I guess, though, that that silly construction shows that the devil's 
algorithm is not so very interesting, unless you impose some 
additional constraint such as trying to minimize the number of turns, 
or making it look as simple as possible :)

    Hi Dan,

&gt; it is
&gt; quite natural to make R and then push F' with your thumb, and then 
follow
&gt; your thumb round and push U with your thumb again, and finally push 
F back
&gt; down with your right index finger.

This is sick! Thanks :-)

&gt; If I had to begin a trick with an F move though, most likely I would 
rotate
&gt; the cube very slightly, change grip to holding the B side (which is 
pointing
&gt; NE as you look at it) with my right hand, and perform the F moves 
with my
&gt; left hand.

Wow, now that you say it it looks so obvious. Can you believe I never 
even thought about turning the F's with my left hand? I only thought 
about doing them with my right hand (by rotating the cube slightly in 
the other direction and regripping with left hand) and of course also 
do the U with the right hand. If I do it your way it feels so much 
better!!!

    I think we should have nice command-line tools... Then it should look 
somewhat like this:
scramble -p 2gen3x3.def -n 60 -t100 | solve -p 2gen3x3.def | lpr
Which should send 60 random optimal scrambles to the printer.

Oh well, Jaap's program should be alright (plus, I *like* short

I have written pretty much everything about influencing the Last Layer in
the section on Advanced F2L techniques now, bar a few little bits I will
tinker with and aestheticy things. I think these pages would be extremely
useful for anyone hoping to learn ZB or are interested in knowing more about
VH, and extremely interesting to anyone else.

I hope you enjoy my work! You can find it on my site, and click the F2L link

    Hi,

I have completed two DIY kits recently, seen various
versions and gained some experience to share...

1. Stickers you can obtain can be of two different kinds
  - thin colored plastic ones (dull orange and yellow
    after applying to a cube).. relatively durable..
    I have a cube for about 2 years with these stickers
    and they are still ok (but glue went too soft
    and stickers move around a bit)
  - stickers covered by a thin transparent film.
    they are similar to paper stickers, but actually
    are even worse, because they are plastic, but just
    painted white plastic... the painted color is
    easy to remove after the transparent film is gone..
    and the film is even easier to remove from painted
    plastic than from paper...
    it takes few weeks to destroy them ... so if you
    want to use the cube more, try another alternative...
    (it is quite difficult to get rid of the glue if
    you remove the stickers...)
    The really bad thing is that rubiks.com can claim
    that the stickers are made of plastic, because they are...

2. Center caps are really bad. You often have to adjust them
in order to use them...
I played with them a little and now they hold well even
without glue. The first thing is to shorten that two juts
(may be longer than the center depth!!) by a half or so...
Remove also part of their support heels (often hit the ring
in the center!!). Now try to put the cap on the center and
incrementally sand the inner touching parts of the cap until
it creates not too big tension...
The last step I had to do was to reduce the size of the caps
so as they are not bigger that the center piece...
(if they are bigger they can be popped by adjacent moving pieces)
I hope, these modifications will not be supposed illegal,
because they do not provide me with any real advantage and
only makes the cube possible to assemble...

3. You can obtain 2 types of screws.
The small head (older) and large head (newer) ones.
If you have kit with small-head screws, you also have
metal washers. These metal washers are missing if you
have screws with a bigger head...
What a surprise, the screw and its head-ring may be
non-concentric, but it should not be a big problem and
IMHO affects only the cube life-time a little..
The smaller washers are plastic and quite easy to break,
so be careful if removing imperfections...
(Much better alternative would be metal 2mm washers with
an enlarged hole...)
The kit also contain rivets, but I see no point to use
them (buy a complete cube instead)..

Despite the necessary tuning of the center caps and bad
quality of the stickers provided, the cube have really
big advantages. It is very smooth from the beginning
and it can be adjusted to not pop pieces while beeing
very loose (it is nearly imposible to disassemble the
cube by removing an edge then!).
The disadvantage could be a different feeling compared to
flat-center cube and that the cube locks more when not
well alligned (but is not really a big problem compared to
springless cubes).

Just my two cents (why two?).

    I'll add two more cents :)

The vinyl on my Rubik's Studio cubes is very
thin and isn't all that durable so those stickers
get chewed up pretty easily.

There's no reason why the manufacturers or modders
couldn't use a thicker vinyl. They still make vinyl for
road signs and it's pretty tough. 

These DIY cubes sound like they are an improvement
but not perfect. I can't even remember how the centre
lids worked on the original Ideal Toy cubes but I seem
to recall drilling little holes in the lids so I could
get at the screws underneath.

In fact I recently drilled out the centres on one of my
Rubik's Game/Challenge cubes. My efforts on removing
lids on the Game were so horrific I'm not even going to
try it on the Deluxe cube. 

I'm curious though, is there any way to know by the
box if a new cube has the arched centre pieces? 
The lids of future cubes could have some sort of 
snap-on technology with a LCD move counter built 
into the white centre. Of course the plastic would
be some space-age super frictionless type.  And 
on future Deluxes picky cubists can easily remove
coloured plastic tiles so white is opposite yellow
or white is opposite blue.

Easily available replacement parts like spindles
would be nice. When the spindles go it's game 
over.

Ok I'm done.

Mark

    138. SpeedStacks timer 2nd generation review

   <div class="email-content">
    Hi all,

I have obtained the 2nd generation speedstacks timer with
minipad. So there may be some people interested in info here.

This combination is cheaper than the original timer and much
easier to transport, because timer is now separable from a
pad. Pictures are on http://speedstacks.com.
I will focus on issues important for cubers.

Since the timer is not part of pad, and buttons, LEDs, and
the LCD display is between two hand sensors, it is thicker.
The highest part is about 1.3cm above the pad, the sensors
are about 3-4mm above the pad (they are slanted toward the pad).
This is not a problem for cubing, however, for Rubik's magic
it can be a problem, because magic can hit the timer
and and/or be in illegal position when stopping the
timer (verified...).

The sensors probbably use the same technology as notebook's
touchpad, because they do not register pressure, but the
area of touching hands (so hard pressing of two fingers
does not work, light touch of palms does). This means
that they do not contain mechanical parts and are really
sensitive. This can increase durability (I hope so)
To avoid unwanted stopping of the timer,
the timer ignores the first 0.32s, so it cannot be used
to time anything shorter than 0.32s...

The timer can be split horizontally to two parts:
the top part contains all functionality, the bottom
part is used to attach a pad...
The top part contains two strong magnets to attach
the bottom part (the bottom part contains two steel
pieces). These magnets can be used to attach the timer
to ferromagnetic materials as an iron desk etc...

The timer uses one 3V thin battery and has a display port.
The tournament display port is not on a side as I would
expected, but in the middle, facing to a user (?).
It automatically tuns off after 5 minutes if stopped, and
10 minutes if running. The last time remains on the timer
even after turning off until the reset is pressed.
There are only "reset" and "power" buttons on it.
There are 2 LEDs (green, red) on the timer and they are
both flashing fast when the timer is running, which
can be disturbing, because they are between the sensors...
(But personally, I do not have any problem with this)...

I really like this version of timer. For home usage,
it is much better than the original timer.
You really can use only the top part of timer without
the pad if necessary...
However, in competitions, the original timer would be
still more appropriate (because of sensors in a pad and
separated controls to be used by judges(!))...

I hope, somebody will find this text useful.

    Hello all,

Here's some of my thinking on the Devil's algorithm.

Since the diametre of the Rubik's cube group is 29 moves, then we 
can get from a position to any other position in at most 29 moves. 
There are 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 distinct positions so a Devil's 
algorithm based on this idea would be at most 29*
(43,252,003,274,489,856,000-1)+1 moves long. It would be constructed 
by indexing in some way the posit√≠ons on the cube and then using the 
optimum way to get from one position to the next one, from the first 
to the last position.

Now we have to think of a smart way to index the positions so that 
the distance between one position and the next is the smallest 
possible, that is (hopefully) 1 move.

I haven't yet found such an indexing (not that i have thought too 
much on it), but I think it's quite easy to find one. I guess that 
there already exist such indexes based on computer solving, you 
surely know better.

The bad side of this algorithm is that it's not easy at all to write 
it down, if it is possible.

Good luck in optimising!
Sebastian

    Can¬ít there be a move that¬ís say, less that 50 moves long or something even
less? Surely that would be far more interesting that an algorithm that¬ís a

    Oh Dan... what shall we do with you... ;-)

Don't you remember that any algorithm applied over and over again will 
be the identity after at most 1260 times? That is, an alg with 50 
moves can produce at most 1260*50 different states. That's also why I 
immediately divided the 4*10^19 by 1260 in my computations...

Cheers!
Stefan

P.S. Sebastian, how come you know the diameter is 29? I thought it's 
proven to be *at most* 29. Wait, weren't you also the one who once 
claimed there are people using full ZB already (or was it full 1-look 
LL?)? Hehe.. ;-)

    I'll add two more cents :)

The vinyl on my Rubik's Studio cubes is very
thin and isn't all that durable so those stickers
get chewed up pretty easily.

There's no reason why the manufacturers or modders
couldn't use a thicker vinyl. They still make vinyl for
road signs and it's pretty tough.

These DIY cubes sound like they are an improvement
but not perfect. I can't even remember how the centre
lids worked on the original Ideal Toy cubes but I seem
to recall drilling little holes in the lids so I could
get at the screws underneath.

In fact I recently drilled out the centres on one of my
Rubik's Game/Challenge cubes. My efforts on removing
lids on the Game were so horrific I'm not even going to
try it on the Deluxe cube.

I'm curious though, is there any way to know by the
box if a new cube has the arched centre pieces?
The lids of future cubes could have some sort of
snap-on technology with a LCD move counter built
into the white centre. Of course the plastic would
be some space-age super frictionless type.  And
on future Deluxes picky cubists can easily remove
coloured plastic tiles so white is opposite yellow
or white is opposite blue.

Easily available replacement parts like spindles
would be nice. When the spindles go it's game
over.

Ok I'm done.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I have completed two DIY kits recently, seen various
&gt; versions and gained some experience to share...
&gt;
&gt; 1. Stickers you can obtain can be of two different kinds
&gt;   - thin colored plastic ones (dull orange and yellow
&gt;     after applying to a cube).. relatively durable..
&gt;     I have a cube for about 2 years with these stickers
&gt;     and they are still ok (but glue went too soft
&gt;     and stickers move around a bit)
&gt;   - stickers covered by a thin transparent film.
&gt;     they are similar to paper stickers, but actually
&gt;     are even worse, because they are plastic, but just
&gt;     painted white plastic... the painted color is
&gt;     easy to remove after the transparent film is gone..
&gt;     and the film is even easier to remove from painted
&gt;     plastic than from paper...
&gt;     it takes few weeks to destroy them ... so if you
&gt;     want to use the cube more, try another alternative...
&gt;     (it is quite difficult to get rid of the glue if
&gt;     you remove the stickers...)
&gt;     The really bad thing is that rubiks.com can claim
&gt;     that the stickers are made of plastic, because they are...
&gt;
&gt; 2. Center caps are really bad. You often have to adjust them
&gt; in order to use them...
&gt; I played with them a little and now they hold well even
&gt; without glue. The first thing is to shorten that two juts
&gt; (may be longer than the center depth!!) by a half or so...
&gt; Remove also part of their support heels (often hit the ring
&gt; in the center!!). Now try to put the cap on the center and
&gt; incrementally sand the inner touching parts of the cap until
&gt; it creates not too big tension...
&gt; The last step I had to do was to reduce the size of the caps
&gt; so as they are not bigger that the center piece...
&gt; (if they are bigger they can be popped by adjacent moving pieces)
&gt; I hope, these modifications will not be supposed illegal,
&gt; because they do not provide me with any real advantage and
&gt; only makes the cube possible to assemble...
&gt;
&gt; 3. You can obtain 2 types of screws.
&gt; The small head (older) and large head (newer) ones.
&gt; If you have kit with small-head screws, you also have
&gt; metal washers. These metal washers are missing if you
&gt; have screws with a bigger head...
&gt; What a surprise, the screw and its head-ring may be
&gt; non-concentric, but it should not be a big problem and
&gt; IMHO affects only the cube life-time a little..
&gt; The smaller washers are plastic and quite easy to break,
&gt; so be careful if removing imperfections...
&gt; (Much better alternative would be metal 2mm washers with
&gt; an enlarged hole...)
&gt; The kit also contain rivets, but I see no point to use
&gt; them (buy a complete cube instead)..
&gt;
&gt; Despite the necessary tuning of the center caps and bad
&gt; quality of the stickers provided, the cube have really
&gt; big advantages. It is very smooth from the beginning
&gt; and it can be adjusted to not pop pieces while beeing
&gt; very loose (it is nearly imposible to disassemble the
&gt; cube by removing an edge then!).
&gt; The disadvantage could be a different feeling compared to
&gt; flat-center cube and that the cube locks more when not
&gt; well alligned (but is not really a big problem compared to
&gt; springless cubes).
&gt;
&gt; Just my two cents (why two?).

    &gt; P.S. Sebastian, how come you know the diameter is 29? I thought 
it's 
&gt; proven to be *at most* 29.

Well that's what I meant, at most 29. I just read it from a message 
on this topic (Mike said that I think). First i thought it's much 
smaller, something like 20 moves.

Wait, weren't you also the one who once 
&gt; claimed there are people using full ZB already (or was it full 1-
look 
&gt; LL?)? Hehe.. ;-)

I didn't claim such a horrible thing. I myself use about 20 
algorithms, the fact is that using the Petrus method orients edges 
before getting to LL, and I also permute corners (since the two-
generator conservs the corner permutation as well as the edges 
orientation) so that it's quite easy to do the LL, or what's left of 
it, in only one step. More details on my web page

    Hi,

as some of you might have noticed my webpage has been unavailable for 
quite some time. I'm now in the process of building a new one at

http://www.cubezone.be/

This website is going to focus more on speedcubing methods and 
techniques as opposed to my old pages which mainly contained photo 
albums and video clips. At the moment everything is still pretty 
basic, but I already added my customized PLL algorithms since a lot of 
people have been asking me about them.

There will be more to follow!

Cheers,
LarsV

    Hi Sebastian,

   Is the devil's algorithm one long algorithm which is applied once
and hits everything, and never repeats movements (not positions), or
is it one which takes two or more cycles to reach that goal? I wonder
if it could be one, for example, which starts and ends with red facing
you and white up, and then you rotate the cube, and do it again,
eventually though 24 applications.

   If the devils alg is one which is allowed to be applied more than
once to reach all the positions then:
   
   Of the 43 quintillion possible positions only a small percentage
are at the maximum distance away from the solved state.
   There are probably a great number of positions which are halfway to
the maximum distance.
   Couldn't you have an algorithm which is only half as long as God's
algorithm? Applied twice it could reach one of the
furthest-away-from-solved positions.
   There are 18 positions which are one move away (within the half
turn metric) not only from the solved position, but from every other
position.

   For another question in this thread: If "a penny for your thoughts"
invites you to speak your mind, perhaps it takes your "two cents" to
be allowed to enter into an ongoing conversation.
   
   Regards,

David J

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; Here's some of my thinking on the Devil's algorithm.
&gt; 
&gt; Since the diametre of the Rubik's cube group is 29 moves, then we 
&gt; can get from a position to any other position in at most 29 moves. 
&gt; There are 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 distinct positions so a Devil's 
&gt; algorithm based on this idea would be at most 29*
&gt; (43,252,003,274,489,856,000-1)+1 moves long. It would be constructed 
&gt; by indexing in some way the posit√≠ons on the cube and then using the 
&gt; optimum way to get from one position to the next one, from the first 
&gt; to the last position.
&gt; 
&gt; Now we have to think of a smart way to index the positions so that 
&gt; the distance between one position and the next is the smallest 
&gt; possible, that is (hopefully) 1 move.
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't yet found such an indexing (not that i have thought too 
&gt; much on it), but I think it's quite easy to find one. I guess that 
&gt; there already exist such indexes based on computer solving, you 
&gt; surely know better.
&gt; 
&gt; The bad side of this algorithm is that it's not easy at all to write 
&gt; it down, if it is possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck in optimising!
&gt; Sebastian

&gt; Well that's what I meant, at most 29. I just read it from a message 
&gt; on this topic (Mike said that I think). First i thought it's much 
&gt; smaller, something like 20 moves.

Btw, how about using a similar construction as yours but shorter... my 
first idea would be to define a bijection between even and odd states 
(permutation I mean), for example the "partner" of an even state is 
the odd state you get by doing a U turn. Now we could just walk over 
all even states and at each even state interrupt the walk with (U U'). 
That is, we get all the odd states almost for free (guaranteed 2 moves 
instead of up to 29). That's a factor of almost 2 that we save (29+2 
instead of 29*2). The next idea is to walk over a certain subset of 
states using your way and at each state, interrupt the walk with (U4 
D4 L4 R4 F4 B4), i.e. visiting all 18 "neighbours" almost for free...

&gt; Wait, weren't you also the one who once 
&gt; &gt; claimed there are people using full ZB already (or was it full 1-
&gt; look 
&gt; &gt; LL?)? Hehe.. ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't claim such a horrible thing.

You're right, sorry. It was another user whose name starts with 'p':
http://games.groups.yahoo.
com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/11682
(and the claim was that some people are learning all 1211 LL algs)

    &gt;interrupt the walk with (U U'). 

Maybe we could interrupt it with U U, or F F, or any other face, and 
this gives me another idea. Say that we take a state, preferably an 
even state, preferably the solved position. Then we go to all 
positions that can be reached inside the U2 D2 R2 L2 F2 B2 group, 
meanwhile reaching the same number of odd positions. I just realized 
now that those odd states are not part of the same half-move group, 
so most probable is that we throw them away. But then, using this 
algorithm, we are sure to take care of every even position, so there 
might be a bijection betwen a set of even states inside the same 
half-move group and another set of odd states.

I'll try to find a Devil's algorithm for the half move group. It 
should be quite easy.

Any help would be appreciated.

    Hi!

I was just checking. It seems that www.puzzle-shop.de has the square-
1 in stock right now, so u are lucky.

They sell it under the name Cube-21. Unfortunately they don't seem to 
have the Megaminx. And i seem to recall other posts in the past that 
the megaminx is hard to find now, particularly the 12-color ones.

Hope this helps somewhat:-)

If u do purchase from puzzle-shop.de u will probably have to pay 
using PayPal.

Happy puzzling :-)

  Hi Dwayne,
  Simple shortcut methods that cut down the number of algorithms you need for
  OLL and especially cna be found on
  http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/cubertscubicle.  Even the simple L2L1
  strategy cuts down the moves dramatically.  As well as making the number of
  moves to memorise much smaller it also means that you cnas recognise the
  positions much more quickly.  Its as few moves as Fridrich but just much
  easier!  If you've already learned a lot of Fridrich then its even easier to
  switch.

    159. Recruiting more cubers

    I have been fairly successful in getting several people into cubing 
since moving here (London) a few weeks ago. There are two people 
who've solved it once or twice (with my beginner's guide: 
http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html) and 
three more who have expressed interest.

Once one or two people give it a go, it's easier to get others 
interested. They see the first person making progress and then 
realise that it isn't that difficult. I told them that being able to 
solve the cube in a few minutes is easy to learn. It only gets 
difficult when learning to solve it really quickly! :)

    Wow - sorry... That's pretty sad.  You see the site has apparently 
left my brain in quite a tangle... As such, the site can be found at

Now you can... Enjoy! :-)

    Yeah, I also got one of my class-mates into cubing... Although I 
must say, I didn't have to push him, use force, or torture him in 
any way... I just showed him how I solved the cube, and gave him 
some websites, and now he's even more addicted than I am. A lot of 
times, I am irritated, because he's cubing during lessons :).

i also got like 7 ppl into cubing, but only about 4 of them have 
actually learnt solving the whole thing, the rest are reluctant to 
learn the LL because they believe its too hard,they just do the f2l 
lol. but im hoping that this coming spring when my cube club starts 
on campus i can get more ppl into it. wish me luck :p

    i recently taught my girfriend how to cube and she's now officially an 
addict.  it took about 2 hours total to teach her a fridrich type system 
with a simple 4 look LL.  she got her own cube (it's one of the weird ones 
with the 25 years logo) and we sanded and lubed it yesterday.  she was

Until before Christmas break, only two of our ace quizbowlers could cube
(well, I couldn't till then also.)

 

Now, 6 people can, and we use our cubes as a means of threatening the other
team.

 

Laughs..

 

Happy cubing

    My Rubik's magic came today. Using online instruction, i managed to solve it. 
However while i was solving it, i think the chords got all tightened or 
something because now it isn't exactly flat. The squares are all messed up. 
They aren't in a straight line any more. They're all crooked. Is this normal? 
How do i fix it? 

Oh and wuts it supposed to look like when its solved? is only one side 
supposed to be done?

    Hi Jim,

 

Matthew Burns showed me this trick, and from what I know he either was
showed it by Jaap Scherphuis or discovered it independently. My magic gets
into these positions all the time ;)

 

Fold it long ways, and open it up so it forms a ring, one square wide and
eight squares long. Then put both arms a little way inside the ring, and
roll it around your wrists, very much like a boxer hitting a punchbag a
million times, and do it quite tight so the pieces stretch apart from each
other (but only a little way!). When you open your magic back out, it should
be nice and flat again :-)

 

Dan :-)

    Well Grant, you've officially got me hooked on this site.  I have been
on it at work for the past 2 days, doing all of the logic grid puzzles
and quite a few other assorted puzzles.  Not only that, but it has one
of my all time favorite BBS games, Food Fight.  It's a modified
version (for those of you who played the BBS version), but it is still
enjoyable to splat little first graders.

I even saw that you were logged on earlier, Grant.  I just happened to
look down at who was online and saw "GTregay".  Thanks for the link,
work goes by much faster now. ;)

    I seem to be the one with all the stupid questions. Just a newbie I guess; but what is it you sand on the cube? I'm guessing it must be something for speed.

    And to answer your other question, it has two solved positions

1. A 2x4 showing three unconnected ring on one side (the one with the Rubik's Magic Logo)
2. A Heart Shape (2x3x3 turned Diagonally) showing three connected rings

To get from 1 to 2 or vice-versa, you must perform a small algorithm.

  My Rubik's magic came today. Using online instruction, i managed to solve
  it. 
  However while i was solving it, i think the chords got all tightened or 
  something because now it isn't exactly flat. The squares are all messed up. 
  They aren't in a straight line any more. They're all crooked. Is this
  normal? 
  How do i fix it? 

  Oh and wuts it supposed to look like when its solved? is only one side 
  supposed to be done? 

  Thx.

    No, not quite. The algorithms I published solve the corners and also 
leave the orientation of the edges unaffected. So provided the edges 
are already oriented, these algorithms solve the corners _and_ orient 
the last layer in one go, which is way they are called COLL (Corners 
and Orientation Last Layer).

I know that the pages on my website don't offer a lot of explanation 
just yet, but I'll try to change that in the future so that everyone 
should be able to fully understand what everything means even if 
you're not an expert already.

    I've been thinking about this again. Actually, teaching noncubers how 
to solve the cube is a SIN at least as bad as peeling the stickers off 
for solving.

Well, maybe it's just me. But I regret a lot that I learned a solution 
from a book when I was a little kid. I'd like to know whether I 
would've been able to find a solution myself. But I'll never know. 
Teaching someone a solution takes that chance from him/her and it's 
mean.

A friend of mine saw me speedcubing a few months ago and decided to 
try it, too. He refused to look at any solutions and specifically 
asked me not to help him in any way, a request I very happily 
satisfied. He did find a solution (of course!) and it's much much 
cooler than learning it from someone else.

But yeah, maybe that's just me (and that friend of mine)...

&gt; Ok thx. My magic is working great. Just wondering, in tournaments, is the 
magic fully mixed up or do u always solve it from the same position? cuz i saw 
a video of someone solving it in 1 second and i dun understand how they can 
do everything that fast.

&gt;   Hi Jim,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   Matthew Burns showed me this trick, and from what I know he either was
&gt;   showed it by Jaap Scherphuis or discovered it independently. My magic 
gets
&gt;   into these positions all the time ;)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   Fold it long ways, and open it up so it forms a ring, one square wide and
&gt;   eight squares long. Then put both arms a little way inside the ring, and
&gt;   roll it around your wrists, very much like a boxer hitting a punchbag a
&gt;   million times, and do it quite tight so the pieces stretch apart from each
&gt;   other (but only a little way!). When you open your magic back out, it should

    I would say an extremely lower bound might be 100 people.  I base 
this off of the 95 people in the blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube Yahoo 
group.  Since probably not all (but most) of them can solve it blind 
folded, coupled with the fact that many people who CAN solve it 
blindfolded are likely not members of that group, I think 100 is a 
very low estimate.

I would _guess_ that in the entire would the actual number is in the 
thousands.

Having learned to do it myself, and realizing that it is not in fact 
as difficult as it sounds, I guess even that guess may be low.

Hope that helps,
Daniel

    Hi Tyson,
Commendably clear.  I don't think you have fully specified x, y and z in
that you dont specify the direction of the turn (e.g. moves with L or R in
the case of x).  A very minor point over the squared moves too - you don't
really need to specify counter-clockwise!

Hope thats helpful

If you don't want to solve a puzzle yourself, Jaap's site is always a 
good place to start:

www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/

His page on square-1 is particularly thorough, with descriptions of 
several different solution strategies and programs for generating 
your own sequences... he also has links to other solution pages.

    Thanks Duncan... it is unfortunate that I have printed out 10 copies

&gt; Is it all right if I say, "x goes in the same direction as R."  and U
&gt; for y and F for z?  Would that be clear enough?

&gt; &gt; Hi Tyson,
&gt; &gt; Commendably clear.  I don't think you have fully specified x, y and z
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; that you dont specify the direction of the turn (e.g. moves with L or
&gt; &gt; R in
&gt; &gt; the case of x).  A very minor point over the squared moves too - you
&gt; &gt; don't
&gt; &gt; really need to specify counter-clockwise!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hope thats helpful

It is far too late to change the conventions used by such a large 
community, but it would have been nice to use Rc, Uc, and Fc for the 
whole-cube moves, since that notation has some mnemonic content.  
Similarly Rm, Um and Fm for slice moves.  Stefan has made these (or 
similar) suggestions recently, and the notations were used earlier in 
Leinweber's program Hungarian Hexahedron.

Usually I keep out of notational disputes (so will try to keep fairly 
quiet from now on), but in this case a small but significant barrier 
to learning/understanding is being perpetuated.  Moreover, I still 
can't remember the dashed conventions ;)

&gt; If showing someone a solution keeps them

It's not the same anymore. I've solved many many other puzzles myself 
but it's not the same. Of course I can not really be sure, because I 
can't compare it because I don't know how it feels to solve your first 
puzzle yourself (or maybe I started with the 15-puzzle and I'm sure I 
solved that one myself but then again that one is so easy it doesn't 
count). It's not the same. You know some principles from your first 
puzzle so every other puzzle you solve subsequently you do *not* solve 
fully yourself. I'm assuming the satisfaction to solve your first 
puzzle (and possibly all subsequent) yourself without help is much 
bigger.

I had actually thought about teaching some non-cubers how to solve it. 
As an experiment to demonstrate it can be learned in less than one 
hour. I'm sure that's possible. But now I decided I will never do this 
because I won't do that to people. It's too mean.

&gt; Also, some people will be attracted by the sporting element alone -- 
&gt; and why not?

How do you (or they) know beforehand? I'm only sad about this issue 
*now*, long after I started solving. I wish I could forget everything 
and start on my own, but I can't. Plus, they can still learn tricks 
from others *after* they solved it themselves. That's what I do 
nowadays when I get a new puzzle. First I solve it myself (which is 
not completely true of course because I already know a lot of general 
tricks like even/odd permutations and commutators and how they're 
useful for solving puzzles) and then afterwards I try to become faster 
myself and then finally look what other people do. The 4x4 and 5x5 I 
found parity fixers myself and practised solving them until I was 
within 200% or the record times. Only then did I look at other 
people's algs.

Me guilty muchos grande.

&gt;   4.. Frustration at the stupid things people say when they find out

I'd say there must be a limit after which we're allowed to get 
frustrated. Cause some people get so unbelievably annoying.

&gt;   5.. Deliberately popping during a slow solve

Delete "slow". Why should it be allowed in fast solves? And what's 
slow/fast? The "during a solve" should remain, cause it's ok to pop 
just to show someone the mechanism of the cube.

&gt;   6.. Talking cube jargon to those who have no way of udnerstanding

It should be allowed after the same limit of #4 is reached.

And you forgot:
8.. Peeling stickers off in order to solve unless the cube is 
unsolvable without.

    I think I'll throw in my two cents as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh, I don't know about that. The 3x3x3 is rather a difficult 
puzzle 
&gt;&gt;&gt; to start on, and, left to themselves, many people would give up 
&gt;&gt;&gt; through frustration.
 
&gt; Then they're unmotivated losers that need not be worried about.

I do agree with Stefan, but I wouldn't call someone who tries and 
gives up an unmotivated loser.  I would just say they aren't 
interested in the cube, and there's nothing wrong with that.  If 
they were interested in really solving the puzzle as a puzzle they 
would try harder when they found it to be difficult.

I think we have to consider two groups of people, those who just 
want to solve the puzzle of Rubik's cube as a puzzle, and those who 
want to become speedcubers.

If someone just wants to learn how to solve it as a puzzle, then I 
agree - teaching them defeats their whole purpose.  If someone wants 
to know how to solve it every time then I would call that person a 
speedcuber, and that person would potentially want to work on an 
advanced system after learning their first introductory solution.

The way I see it, solving the cube once or twice is a puzzle that 
people should try to figure out on their own.  Speedcubing is more 
of an art.  So for speedcubing someone can either teach you the 
basics and you learn from there, or you can learn the basics 
yourself and move on.  I don't think it's bad to teach a potential 
speedcuber how to cube, but to teach someone who just wants to solve 
it once or twice to say they've done it, then yes I agree it is bad 
to teach them.

Just my opinion of course,
Chris

Hi Tyson,

In Wordpad the counterclockwise notation L' comes out L√≠.

Why add so many different letters when r, f, u, (and l, b, d) can be
used to denote slices, and QR QU and QB can be used to denote
rotations? I know some people already use the notation you printed
out, but it confuses a whole lot of people, especially newcomers.

I'm used to x and y coordinates being the lateral axis, like for map
making, with z added for the vertical axia. 

I don't know who came up with the notation you use, but except for
FLUBRD it seems to deliberately defy convention and simplicity.

Regards,

David J

    Hi Tyson,

 

I think your notation is perfect.

 

--&gt; Why add so many different letters when r, f, u, (and l, b, d) can be
used to denote slices, and QR QU and QB can be used to denote
rotations? &lt;-- 

 

r f u l b d are already defined tokens, they are the letters used for turns
of two layers.

 

--&gt; I know some people already use the notation you printed
out, but it confuses a whole lot of people, especially newcomers. &lt;--

 

They need to get used to it.

 

--&gt; I'm used to x and y coordinates being the lateral axis, like for map
making, with z added for the vertical axia. &lt;--

 

Get used to it.

    Hi Stefan,

   In the early 1980s I realised that those who believed that they
could solve the cube on their own solved it, and those who believed
that they couldn't handle something that complicated failed.

   Since joining this group I have been an advocate of people solving
it on their own the first time. 

   I also encouraging people to develop their own algoritms, but I
know that it's harder to do that. I wonder if there are other
speedcubers here who use only their own algoritms. Anyone?

   Anyway, I'm pretty sure that you could have solved it on your own.
If you want I'll give you a problem (not like a twist puzzle) that
takes a similar ability.

Regards,

David J

&gt; I've been thinking about this again. Actually, teaching noncubers how 
&gt; to solve the cube is a SIN at least as bad as peeling the stickers off 
&gt; for solving.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, maybe it's just me. But I regret a lot that I learned a solution 
&gt; from a book when I was a little kid. I'd like to know whether I 
&gt; would've been able to find a solution myself. But I'll never know. 
&gt; Teaching someone a solution takes that chance from him/her and it's 
&gt; mean.
&gt; 
&gt; A friend of mine saw me speedcubing a few months ago and decided to 
&gt; try it, too. He refused to look at any solutions and specifically 
&gt; asked me not to help him in any way, a request I very happily 
&gt; satisfied. He did find a solution (of course!) and it's much much 
&gt; cooler than learning it from someone else.
&gt; 
&gt; But yeah, maybe that's just me (and that friend of mine)...

&gt; 
&gt; I do agree with Stefan, but I wouldn't call someone who tries and 
&gt; gives up an unmotivated loser.  I would just say they aren't 
&gt; interested in the cube, and there's nothing wrong with that.

Yes, I exaggerated a bit. Actually I think the same as you, they're 
not interested and that's ok. But then again, why teach those who're 
not interested?

&gt; If someone wants 
&gt; to know how to solve it every time then I would call that person a 
&gt; speedcuber, and that person would potentially want to work on an 
&gt; advanced system after learning their first introductory solution.

Still, that's no reason to teach them their first solution. They can 
find a solution on their own first, and then learn better ways from 
others. Finding their own solution first will also give them the 
advantage of trust in themselves to develop something on their own. 
Which is good. And they gain a deeper understanding of what they're 
doing. Which is good. 

My claim: The people who want to become speedcubers are also 
interested/motivated enough to solve it on their own first.

Cheers!
Stefan

    Hi John,

sorry, I don't really know much about how it affects the brain. I'd 
guess it helps your "spatial intelligence". I once took a test for 
future medicine students (was mandatory in Germany) and in the spatial 
category I got full points. But that's no proof ;-). And no, I'm not a 
medicince student, I mainly took that test for fun (I like this kind 
of tests).

Don't know much about the history, either. Maybe someone else here 
knows a good webpage about this? I'm sure there must be one.

Cheers!

I totally believe that. Maybe those who thought it's too complex 
could've been told how easy it is and then they would've continued and

I think the 3x3 is easy enough for anyone to master who's sane, 
healthy, interested and has some time. I once came up with a 4x4 
algorithm (to solve the LL edges) on paper by writing down some 
"destroy-and-restore-F3L" algorithms and their effects, then combining 
them over and over again. I ended up with an algorithm of about 250 
moves that took me 5 minutes to execute, but it worked. And I was very 
very proud. Later I found better ways and eventually after getting 
good enough, I allowed myself to look at other people's ways.

I think I forgot to mention the "interested" criterion there. That's 
what rules out maybe 99.99999% of the people in this world. Ok, some 
of them might simply not even know about it. But you, just as almost 
everybody in this world, could easily solve the cube blindfolded if 
you just wanted to :-)

   Wait another second...if it airs at 4PM PST as per your earlier
post &gt; It will air on Friday, January 14, 2005 at 4 PM (Pacific
Standard Time)&lt; then everyone who tunes in a 4:30PM PST will miss it.

I'm new to the group, what are the rules of cube club that you refer to?

I've just about relearned how to solve the cube - I used to be able to do 
it in the 1980s in a minute and a half though I know that's slow by this 
group's standards.  I'm using my old Singmaster book from 1981 to re-learn 
the basics, and had to get a new cube from Ebay because the old ones I had 
were all sticky and horrible and had lost some of their stickers.

Got accused of cheating by someone at work today for using instructions 
just to add insult to injury!!

    Frankly im guilty of taking the cube to bed, and solving it as i fall
asleep :\, and also im guilty of cubing while im suppose to be doing
my homework, ahhhh!

even if i do start the club in my school, ill just give them an
appreciation for the cube, but its up to them to learn the stuff with
the bunch of algs available on the net.

i believe they will learn more if they they do it themselves.

hehe a few tips wont hurt. :P

    well i'm not going to comment on the actual notation, but since we now
have a WCA and the notation can be standardized, i personaly think
that we should try to make the notation as easy as possible to
understand, even if this means moving away from some of the older
standards.  so i wont propose anything notationwise, but i think that
the WCA should discuss it and decide, or if it comes to it, poll the
cubing community asking them to choose what they like best of a few
different standards.

until next time, happy cubing

Odd thing about it:
- wonder why they chose a 4x4 picture rather than a 3x3?
- the subtitle "54 multicoloured facets of hell" does however refer to a
3x3.

    Hey!

Here we go again! Notation debate ;-)

In principle i would like a notation where there is no existing 
ambiguity. Though x,y,x and likewise f,r,u,b,l,d and M,E,S have a 
meaning based on consensus, some ppl find those confusing. And also 
it seems that the f,r,u,b,l,d have 2 defined meanings: one for slices 
moves (middle layers) and one primarily for fingertricks (turning 2 
layers on 3x3x3 at a time). And apparently there is also different 
opinions about the x,y and z.

So i can repeat what i have suggested in past:

FRUBLD - already well defined, no ambiguity, the inverses and 
quarterturns are also cool deal ;-)

Fc - and so on for cube rotations. (To rotate about an axis other 
than a face one must need to do it in 2 steps)

Fm - for rotation the middle slice parallell to F. Fm will be 
equivalent to S. I personally dislike M,E and S even i have learnt 
them.

So this is what i suggest but i know it's hard to turn old rocks ;-) 
Ppl are mostly slaves to habits :D

Happy cubing :-)

I don't know why you're looking for trouble with slice moves notation.
The metric is HTM, slices are not considered as simple moves, so
there's just no need to give them a name.

No really, I'm serious, if someone wants to do weird things like slice
moves, it's always possible to use normal moves and cube rotations if
needed. This way you get fewer notational problems.

&gt; Hey!
&gt; 
&gt; Here we go again! Notation debate ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; In principle i would like a notation where there is no existing 
&gt; ambiguity. Though x,y,x and likewise f,r,u,b,l,d and M,E,S have a 
&gt; meaning based on consensus, some ppl find those confusing. And also 
&gt; it seems that the f,r,u,b,l,d have 2 defined meanings: one for slices 
&gt; moves (middle layers) and one primarily for fingertricks (turning 2 
&gt; layers on 3x3x3 at a time). And apparently there is also different 
&gt; opinions about the x,y and z.
&gt; 
&gt; So i can repeat what i have suggested in past:
&gt; 
&gt; FRUBLD - already well defined, no ambiguity, the inverses and 
&gt; quarterturns are also cool deal ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Fc - and so on for cube rotations. (To rotate about an axis other 
&gt; than a face one must need to do it in 2 steps)
&gt; 
&gt; Fm - for rotation the middle slice parallell to F. Fm will be 
&gt; equivalent to S. I personally dislike M,E and S even i have learnt 
&gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt; So this is what i suggest but i know it's hard to turn old rocks ;-) 
&gt; Ppl are mostly slaves to habits :D
&gt; 
&gt; Happy cubing :-)

    Actually you can solve the 4x4 pretty much exactly like you solve the 
5x5. If you understand what you're doing with the 4x4, the translation 
to 5x5 should be no problem. I will intentionally *not* give you any 
further advice, since I'm confident you can make it on your own and 
the satisfaction will be much greater this way.

Cheers!

    Yes you can do without but it's a pain for the brain. Simplicity is a 
measure not only for the language itself (then we would talk in 
Binary, not English) but also for its use.

Example:

U2 Rm U2 Rm'
This is how my brain thinks of the alg plus it looks nice.

U2 L R' F2 L' R
Actually less painful than I would've thought. My brain can think of 
the alg this way, too. But not as nice.

U2 L R' Rc U2 L' R Rc'
Painful.

    Hey!

That notation i mentioned is what i consider "ideal" if a cube move 
notation was to be completely reinvented so to speak. Im not 
suggesting to actually now go forward and make it official or widely 
used. Too many ppl are now used to other notations, so yes it would 
create even more confusion. But at least "my" notation doesn't 
conflict with any existing notations. And i thought u Gilles were one 
of those who campaign that slice moves be counted as 1 move? Not 
reflecting that in notation is then a bit odd to me :-) If we can all 
agree on the notation as explained on speedcubing.com then it's fine. 
When the larger olympic cubes are out (when in that actually???) we 
will have to decide on notation for them. Or even for huge computer 
cubes ... I'm mostly philosophical about this. Not a 
fundamentalist ...

Cheers :-)

That was only one example Stefan.

How about this one?

R'D'RL-U'R'UD-L'U'LR-D'L'DU or
R'D'Ra-D'L'Da-L'U'La-U'R'Ua (for those who know about antislices)

Which could be : (R'D'RL-Fc)*4

Sooooo much nicer ... anyway ...

    I know you know that I think that writing using slice notations is
much more simple and it corresponds to a simple way of thinking and
considering the cube. :-)

But let's be logical. You don't need extra notation that does not
correspond the very logic of the metric(*). Or else, you can decide to
label permutation sequences, for example. More logical, and less
confusion.

Gilles.


(*) Even for cube rotations, you could do without. I think David used
to write sequences based on turning colors (centers). This way, you
can look at the cube upside down, notation won't change.

&gt; 
&gt; Example:
&gt; 
&gt; U2 Rm U2 Rm'
&gt; This is how my brain thinks of the alg plus it looks nice.
&gt; 
&gt; U2 L R' F2 L' R
&gt; Actually less painful than I would've thought. My brain can think of

&gt; &gt; I don't know why you're looking for trouble with slice moves

&gt; &gt; The metric is HTM, slices are not considered as simple moves, so
&gt; &gt; there's just no need to give them a name.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; No really, I'm serious, if someone wants to do weird things like

&gt; &gt; needed. This way you get fewer notational problems.

    Hello fellow cubers, I ordered a blank pyraminx and the eastsheen 4x4 
from Mefferts and then a set of the stands from Rubik.com, both last 
Friday and I received the Mefferts order today !  Looks like the

    Hi Stefan, Gilles, Per, et al,

&gt; [SP]
&gt; Example:
&gt; 
&gt; U2 Rm U2 Rm'
&gt; This is how my brain thinks of the alg plus it looks nice.

  I use U2 r U2 r' [note the fewer letters needed]

&gt;  [SP]
&gt; U2 L R' F2 L' R
&gt; Actually less painful than I would've thought. My brain can think of 
&gt; the alg this way, too. But not as nice.

   For quarter turn metric that's fine. FLUBRD only. But people who
use a lot of slice moves tend to think in terms of a metric which
counts any move, including slice moves, as one move. Even in QTM a
quarter turn of a slice could be allowed. 

   Basically the notation I  recommend is the 4x4x4 notation applied
to the 3x3x3. I added "Q" for cube rotations because its easier to
remember.

   It's no big deal. If everyone doesn't want to unify notation that's
all right. I just wonder why those who will put out a lot of effort to
simplify everything else balk at simplifying notation. Perhaps, like
it was suggested, it is resistance to change.

Regards,

David J

I think we should all turn to the learned king of cubes himself. Ron. Let
him choose a notation, and everyone must stick by it. Failing that, lets
just accept that notations, like languages, will number many and varied, and
to understand each other we will have to become fluent in more than one.

    Hey everyone,
  I decided to type up the solution I've been using for my bandaged 
cube lately.  It uses pretty much the same algorithms as on Jaap's 
site, but the steps are different, as are some uses of the 
algorithms.  With such a confining puzzle though, I think it's about 
as different as it can be.

  It's still a bit of the work in progress, and the drawings are 
pretty poor, but it's up for public scrutiny.

In the files section it's "bandaged Solution.doc"

Link: http://tinyurl.com/5h775

Also hosted on my own webspace: 
http://members.cox.net/swedishlf/Bandaged%20Solution.doc

Let me know if you guys have any suggestions (step four was kind of 
difficult to communicate).

    Good thing you reminded me of this :-)

Maybe I should read yours and Jaap's solution first, but here's how my 
solution would work. Choose special positions X and Y, remaining are 
called A-E. The pieces that belong in those positions get the same 
names.

1. Get "home position" (correct "shape"), left to reader.
2. Look at position X. If you see piece A, apply algorithm #A. Same 
for B-E. If you see X or Y, pick a place from A-E that's unsolved and 
apply its alg. Repeat until solved.

The algorithms #A-#E would be 3-cycles, e.g. #D cycles (X-&gt;D-&gt;Y-&gt;X).

So you need to be able to reach home position and you need to learn 
five algorithms. Don't know how long these algs would be. Clearly the 
puzzle is solved after A-E are solved, and each of these take at most 
three alg applications, so 15 alg applications is an upper bound (but 
I'd assume a much lower average, probably below 10).

How many alg applications does your method need, do you know? Or, how 
many moves do you need to solve?

    I just wrote a program to analyze my method. Here are the results of 
solving a million bandaged cubes my way:

Average number of algorithms applied: 6.46907
 373 times it took 0 algorithm applications
2038 times it took 1 algorithm applications
9774 times it took 2 algorithm applications
35780 times it took 3 algorithm applications
95670 times it took 4 algorithm applications
190359 times it took 5 algorithm applications
222971 times it took 6 algorithm applications
165524 times it took 7 algorithm applications
114895 times it took 8 algorithm applications
80383 times it took 9 algorithm applications
47234 times it took 10 algorithm applications
25759 times it took 11 algorithm applications
9240 times it took 12 algorithm applications

So average is indeed less than 10, and worst case seems to be 12 :-)

Here's the code:
(Actually I just realized I'm pretty stupid. The million random tests 
should be replaced by 7!/2 tests, namely all possible scrambles. Oh 
well...)

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
using namespace std;

int p[7];

bool solved () {
  for( int i=0; i&lt;7; i++ )
    if( p[i] != i )
      return false;
  return true;
}

void show () {
  for( int i=0; i&lt;7; i++ )
    cout &lt;&lt; p[i] &lt;&lt; " ";
  cout &lt;&lt; endl;
}

int main () {

  //--- Prepare...
  for( int i=0; i&lt;7; i++ )
    p[i] = i;
  int n = 1000000;
  int sum = 0;
  int freq[100] = {};

  //--- Dance...
  for( int t=0; t&lt;n; t++ ){

    //--- Scramble.
    random_shuffle( p, p+7 );

    //--- Fix parity.
    int parity = 0;
    for( int i=0; i&lt;7; i++ )
      for( int j=i+1; j&lt;7; j++ )
        parity ^= (p[i] &gt; p[j]);
    swap( p[0], p[parity] );

    //--- Solve.
    //show();
    int steps = 0;
    while( !solved() ){
      int target = p[0];
      if( target &lt; 2 )
        for( int i=2; i&lt;7; i++ )
          if( p[i] != i )
            target = i;
      //cout &lt;&lt; "alg #" &lt;&lt; target &lt;&lt; endl;
      swap( p[0], p[target] );
      swap( p[0], p[1] );
      //show();
      steps++;
    }

    //--- Statistics.
    sum += steps;
    freq[steps]++;
  }

  //--- Display results.
  cout &lt;&lt; "Average number of algorithms applied: " &lt;&lt; 1.0 * sum / n &lt;&lt; 
endl;
  for( int i=0; i&lt;100; i++ ){
    if( freq[i] ){
      cout.width( 4 );
      cout &lt;&lt; freq[i] &lt;&lt; " times it took " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; " algorithm 
applications" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
  }

and

&gt; 
&gt; The algorithms #A-#E would be 3-cycles, e.g. #D cycles (X-&gt;D-&gt;Y-&gt;X).
&gt; 
&gt; So you need to be able to reach home position and you need to learn

the

most

(but

You're solution would use the 3-cycles (AXY), (BXY),..,(EXY). 
Unfortunately 3-cycles are not easy to find on the bandaged cube.

There is a short 3-cycle (9 moves), which I use in my solution. I 
chose to solve those three pieces last. Most other 3-cycles 
unfortunately have rather a lot of moves. There was one 3-cycle I 
wanted to have, but my computer couldn't find it (I think I broke it 
off after 25 moves or so).

In the end my first (computer-assisted) solution used a different set 
of movesequences for each piece. This means you only have to apply 5 
move sequences, but because of the missing 3-cycle case it can 
sometimes be 6.

On the other hand, 5-cycles are much easier to find. My second 
solution used one 5-cycle (applied in different ways), and the short 
3-cycle. I don't know how many applications of those sequences are 
needed.

Regardless, I can never remember either solution.

    My method uses a 3 cycle, a 5 cycle (and their mirrors) and one more 
5 cycle that's very intuitive and only used once.

After a quick look back at the solution, I think the worst case solve 
would apply 11 algorithms, but I could be wrong (I'll have to think 
about step 4 more).

    I was quite surprised to see the volume of discussion generated from 
my initial post about teaching some new cubers! :)

The only puzzle I worked out entirely by myself is the Rubik's 
Clock. My general approach with puzzles is to try and work out most 
of it myself but then not feel too guilty about reading a website 
when I get really stuck.

I don't regret not having worked out the whole cube myself, but I 
certainly do respect those who have (very impressed!!). I am, 
however, an advocate for working out the F2L on your own and solving 
it intuitively. But perhaps this is just because I found the F2L 
pairs to be pretty easy. I guess I'd feel the same way about the LL 
if I'd found it easy (but I didn't).

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Oh, I don't know about that. The 3x3x3 is rather a difficult 
&gt; puzzle 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to start on, and, left to themselves, many people would give 
up 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; through frustration.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; Then they're unmotivated losers that need not be worried about.
&gt; 
&gt; I do agree with Stefan, but I wouldn't call someone who tries and 
&gt; gives up an unmotivated loser.  I would just say they aren't 
&gt; interested in the cube, and there's nothing wrong with that.  If 
&gt; they were interested in really solving the puzzle as a puzzle they 
&gt; would try harder when they found it to be difficult.
&gt; 
&gt; I think we have to consider two groups of people, those who just 
&gt; want to solve the puzzle of Rubik's cube as a puzzle, and those 
who 
&gt; want to become speedcubers.
&gt; 
&gt; If someone just wants to learn how to solve it as a puzzle, then I 
&gt; agree - teaching them defeats their whole purpose.  If someone 
wants 
&gt; to know how to solve it every time then I would call that person a 
&gt; speedcuber, and that person would potentially want to work on an 
&gt; advanced system after learning their first introductory solution.
&gt; 
&gt; The way I see it, solving the cube once or twice is a puzzle that 
&gt; people should try to figure out on their own.  Speedcubing is more 
&gt; of an art.  So for speedcubing someone can either teach you the 
&gt; basics and you learn from there, or you can learn the basics 
&gt; yourself and move on.  I don't think it's bad to teach a potential 
&gt; speedcuber how to cube, but to teach someone who just wants to 
solve 
&gt; it once or twice to say they've done it, then yes I agree it is 
bad 
&gt; to teach them.
&gt; 
&gt; Just my opinion of course,

Yeah. I agree.

&gt; Fc - and so on for cube rotations. (To rotate about an axis other

I don't know about this, though... I would rather have a move like
vR, which would be to turn the cube so that you're now looking at the
R face. You could then also do vRU or vRB (different from vUB) also.

&gt; Fm - for rotation the middle slice parallell to F. Fm will be 
&gt; equivalent to S. I personally dislike M,E and S even i have learnt 
&gt; them.

I'd like to propose a different notation for these, one that I saw in
a book. They used the notation Fs and Fa: the s means 'slice' and Fs
would be F B', and the a means 'antislice' and Fa would be F B. I
can't stand the MES system myself, and I'd never use it on my site if
I was presenting a solution. Also, with my definitions the centers
will stay in the same position, there aren't any problems like
worrying which direction an E' turn is, and it's just shorthand for
something that would take longer to write.

    Well, as it happens I did experience a small "spike" on the 26th and 27th
December, also on the 31st  Dec and 1st Jan.

 

I am too tired to think of reasons why it might be, the Christmas rush is
one I guess, but you can also see that some days of the week are more
popular than others, and a big rush of hits coincided with my new F2L pages.

    Lars V and I would also like to propose a new notation, which we feel is
very intuitive and would be a useful standard. Whats more is its easy to
remember!

 

A = Above

B = Back

C = Counter-East

D = Down

E = East

F = Front

 

a, b, c, d, e, f = two layer turns

 

+ = clockwise

- = anticlockwise

2 = half turn

 

Rotation_A/A'/A2 = Rotation in the direction of A/A/A2

Same for B C D E F, use whichever is necessary.

Yeah. I agree.

&gt; Fc - and so on for cube rotations. (To rotate about an axis other 
&gt; than a face one must need to do it in 2 steps)

I don't know about this, though... I would rather have a move like
vR, which would be to turn the cube so that you're now looking at the
R face. You could then also do vRU or vRB (different from vUB) also.

&gt; Fm - for rotation the middle slice parallell to F. Fm will be 
&gt; equivalent to S. I personally dislike M,E and S even i have learnt 
&gt; them.

I'd like to propose a different notation for these, one that I saw in
a book. They used the notation Fs and Fa: the s means 'slice' and Fs
would be F B', and the a means 'antislice' and Fa would be F B. I
can't stand the MES system myself, and I'd never use it on my site if
I was presenting a solution. Also, with my definitions the centers
will stay in the same position, there aren't any problems like
worrying which direction an E' turn is, and it's just shorthand for
something that would take longer to write.

    I have a beginner solution on my website  http://www.deepcube.tk
I have taught many people, probably well over a hundred, how to solve
the cube using this method, but to my knowledge only one so far has
actualy learned from my site.  Although the method seems fairly good,
and the feedback from that one person was good, just a warning, the
website isnt tried and tested.  The method on my site (not by any
means my method, just a begginer one) also leads nicely to an
intermediate method and etc. right up to full Fridrich.  And i know
i'm going to get hammered for creating clones, but nothing says that
you can't learn another method or make up your own once you've
learned.

Another good beginner solution is Jasmine's, but i dont have a link to
her site right now.

Good luck,
Evan

Until next time, Happy Cubing

    If you can get the already popular sites to link to you and vice
versa, you're on a good way already, since Google will more often hit
you. And it also turns out having unique and good content always help.
Design is quite irrelevant.

There are many ways to popularize a website. Those are probably the
best. Don't expect your site to be a hit right away. Good sites have
returning visitors, and returning visitors always have to arrive a
first time, and then you need to have something there that makes them
come back.

    Hi John,

You can solve the 4x4 basically very similar to 3x3, but of course you 
need other algorithms. The way I would do it (I've never done a 4x4, 
only a 5x5) is in 3-cycles, i.e. solve 2 pieces at a time. The algs I 
used for the 5x5 that also work for the 4x4:

- centers: (l d l') U (l d' l') U'
- edges: (l D l') U (l D' l) U'
- corners: like 3x3

These algs for centers/edges are simple commutators and you can easily 
modify them, for example I'd also use this one:

U2 (l D l') U2 (l D' l)

Btw, for blindsolving discussions better go to the blindsolving group
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/blindfoldsolving-rubiks-cube/

Memorizing I do exactly the same way as 3x3.

Cheers!

Dan, Lars, this is very bad for me. I'm always confused by East/West. 
Therefore I suggest to swap and rename like this:

C = Communists
E = Europe

       Thank you very much. Let me give it a try. I do not have any idea about 2-cycle, 3- cycle etc. could you please explain me that ?

Hi John,

You can solve the 4x4 basically very similar to 3x3, but of course you 
need other algorithms. The way I would do it (I've never done a 4x4, 
only a 5x5) is in 3-cycles, i.e. solve 2 pieces at a time. The algs I 
used for the 5x5 that also work for the 4x4:

- centers: (l d l') U (l d' l') U'
- edges: (l D l') U (l D' l) U'
- corners: like 3x3

These algs for centers/edges are simple commutators and you can easily

You could have a litte fun and spend 10 minutes applying the algorithm
yourself. I just did it, and it doesn't take very long! I wish I would
have counted for you, but it's funner to discover things for yourself.

    well for beginners check out taka's page, his link is on macky's site.
the good thing about his method is, it gives a good transition into
speedcubing full fridrich system later on.

basically his method is solving the f2l using only of alg, then doing
sunes to orient LL, after which only the three cycle permutations are
used.

pretty neat :P

&gt; John Louis

If you use my 3x3 method (using the T-permutation to do almost all the 
work), then you're already working with 2-cycles, which are simple 
swaps (A&lt;-&gt;B) or write (A-&gt;B-&gt;A). And 3-cycles are (A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;A). 
They're easy to come up on the fly using commutators. And they're the 
same as two 2-cycles, so you solve 2 pieces at a time instead of just 
1.

If you have more questions about this, please ask in the blindsolving 
group.

Cheers!
Stefan

You could also break some interesting record and then you might get to

    Today, I tried out 3 cubes successively. Yes, I did them perfectly. I took 36 min to memorise. Revised 3 times to make sure my memorisation is perfect.And, I solved all the three perfectly in 54 min. Of course, all the 3 cubes are very rough. I had to fight with it to move!! More over I have not memorised the set up moves yet.
If I have a well lubed cube and memorise all the set up moves and reset up moves, I can improve my speed. I am planning to do 15 cubes very shortly to inspire my son BERNETT ORLANDO &amp; it may be a new record also, I believe.
In the coming week ends I will try out 5, 8, 12 &amp; 15 etc.

    You can do the following:

1: Go to speedcubing.com

2: Click where it says "Unofficial World Records"

3: click where it says "Post your record"

4: Fill out the form. it usually takes a couple of days for the guys to post
the record.

Hope this helps.

    A few of my cuber friends and I have decided that we should pool 
together our money and purchase a timer for when we hold meetings, 
so we don't have to rely on using a computer for timing. But, before 
we do, I'd like to know a few things:

First: Is there any major disadvantage to the new stackmats? I tried 
one out yesterday at the Exploratorium and it seemed much better 
than the original. But does it hold up, etc?

Second: The new Rubik's timer is coming out eventually. When it 
does, how likely is it that the timer will become the official timer 
of speedcubing? If it does, will the stackmat phase out of use? Or 
are stackmats likely to be the tournament timer for a long time?
We're also considering holding a tournament at some point, so the 
timer would be used for that.

I would really appreciate feedback before we sink $60 into a timer 
that becomes obsolete...

    The stackmat will never become obsolete to cup stackers, so you could 
always sell it to them on ebay if cubers start using something else.

In the tournament yesterday it happened twice that a solved cube became 
unsolved when hitting the table after being dropped.

I'm not complaining about the rules, and neither were those affected, 
but I think it shows that a specific cube timer would be better.

Did this happen on the new one and was it because of the new design? 
I.e. would the old stackmat have resulted in the same problem?

    Hi

I got a present which Santa brought a little too late: sport stacking cups ( the new name of speed stacking cups). 

I have tried the 3-6-3 and am now down to 5.83 (after one day). I wonder if people here have some tips. Also, is there a yahoo group on this topic?

The CD that came with the package was damaged. And on the net there is hardly any material about cup stacking! 

I would like to know how to perform the 1-10-1 and also a complete description of the cycle.

I should have been more specific: The new stackmat was Mike 
Grimsley's and was not used in the tournament. However, the pad is 
thicker, and the controls seem better, but nothing else was changed 
on it. I think the problem would be the same on either timer, due to 
the need to drop the cube quickly for that extra 0.5s or so.

Seems clear to me, but can someone please clarify for me from where do I
reference the axis (x y z). I'm asking this cause on some sites I've been to
the axis is refered from the top looking down and some refer to it from the
front... so I'm kinda lost, for a while at least, when I see "x",  "y" or
"z" on some notations.

    Hi.  It seems to me that the vast majority of cubing competitions in the U.S. are held on the west coast.  I live in New Jersey and was wondering if there are/will be any competitions in my general vicinity (i.e., the Northeastern U.S. in general).  Thanks.

    I see that Master Katsu reached sub-6 for the 2x2x2 cube
(congratulations, by the way ;-) I'm feel that you can be faster, but
it depends on the quality of your cube).

I know people who spend 10 seconds looking for the easiest set of
colors to begin with. Saving 5 moves for such a puzzle is a huge
advantage, it's almost more important than the effective solving phase.

What are the exact rules for such a fast puzzle? (*)

Gilles.

    Hi Gilles,

Yes, congratz to Katsu... I am not sure if I can ever do that 
without learning CLL :). I don't know if there are any special rules 
for the 2x2, but I always use 15 seconds preinspection time... And 
indeed, it really helps to start with an easy color. I never really 
gave the inspection time any thought, because I am just used to 
those 15 seconds so much.

I'm only wondering what method S√©bastien Felix uses to average 4.24

    Hi Lars,

I think competitors should realize that the WCA tournaments all use 
Stackmats and practice starting and stopping with a Stackmat.  It is 
true that a cube can become unsolved but that just means the competitor 
needs to place the cube down more slowly.  In a competition, we are not 
measuring how fast you can solve a cube but we are measuring how fast 
you can solve the cube in a competition.  This means pressure and 
certain standards.  The time of course isn't the time it takes to solve 
a cube either.  It's the time to pick up the cube and put it back down. 
  I'm sure I've said this before, but the 100 meter race doesn't measure 
how fast you run 100 meters.  It measure how fast you run 100 meters 
and your ability to react to the sound of the gun.

I feel the new timer introduces many problems into the competition 
regulations so we will be sticking with the Stackmat even when the new 
timer comes out.  The Stackmat ensures that you can't make a move until 
you start the time and also ensures that you can't make a move after 
you stop the time.

&gt; The stackmat will never become obsolete to cup stackers, so you could

&gt; In the tournament yesterday it happened twice that a solved cube became
&gt; unsolved when hitting the table after being dropped.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not complaining about the rules, and neither were those affected,
&gt; but I think it shows that a specific cube timer would be better.

    Are you saying that we should have a much smaller inspection time for 
the 2x2x2?  The main problem with short inspection times is that it 
becomes harder and harder to actually give them that time.  Imagine you 
give someone 1 second of inspection time.  Well, they already have 3 
seconds of leeway in terms of starting and stopping.  Basically, the 
error of the inspection time because larger than the inspection time 
itself.

    The usual way to attack this is to swap two edge groups using this

    What's the quickest algorithm to correct the orientation parity?  I 
know Chris has one on his website that corrects the orientation parity 
and doesn't disturb anything else but is there one that corrects it and 
just retains the 3x3x3 status of the 4x4x4 cube?

    Thank you everybody a lot. 

I am really glad to achieve first sub6. ;)
However, I have been practicing 2x2x2 only for a short term.

And, I apply and am using the method on the following page. 
http://cube.misto.cz/ortegas.html
So, I am using only very few algorithms.

In addition, I am studying making the following page.
It connects with page 3 from the link under the page. 
http://www.planet-puzzle.com/2x2x2.html
(I'm sorry only in Japanese.)

About pre inspection time:
I also am spending 15 seconds. 
One example, http://www.planet-puzzle.com/a_cube_video.html
I want the extension of five seconds!!! (haha...)


&gt; I'm only wondering what method S√©bastien Felix uses to average 
4.24 
&gt; seconds for solving the corners of a 3x3. And what his times with 
a 
&gt; 2x2 would be...

I also feel the same mystery...
Does anyone know the method that he is using?

1) Orientation.
2) Separation (U/D).
3) Permutation.

The third step is the same as yours.
With a lot practice, it seems that S√©bastien knows how to anticipate
2) from start, when possible.
And he uses very fast fingertricks of course :-)

I like the method you are using too, because it's *very easy* to learn
and powerful.

I think it's possible to reach very good times using a layer-by-layer
strategy too. Get used to solve the easiest layer, and then it's just
a matter of 2.5s thanks to optimized sequences.

&gt; Are you saying that we should have a much smaller inspection time for

&gt; give someone 1 second of inspection time.  Well, they already have 3 
&gt; seconds of leeway in terms of starting and stopping.  Basically, the 
&gt; error of the inspection time because larger than the inspection time 
&gt; itself.
&gt; 


If you plan most of your solution before, you're only timing pure
dexterity (including picking up the cube and stopping the timer), it's
not the art of puzzle solving.

But I know there's no practical way of timing a "no inspection" solve.
 :-(

PS: Oh! I just had an idea for a new brilliant patent: The "no
inspection" speedcubing competition room...
- The competitor enters a dark room.
- The timer starts when the judge switches the light on.
- Judges equiped with infra-red goggles.
Ok, ok... Forget it.

    Whahaha.. That video is really cool :). I also had a 1.74 case like 
that once. It took me longer to see the cube was actually solved, 
than the total solving time. :)

Your method looks a bit like Geatan's method. Last permutation step 
(of both layers) is the same... Maybe you should take a look at his 
algorithms. I think it won't be that hard to combine both methods.

    Hi Jo√´l,

You can use the same algorithms for the 4x4 case, where one edge-
group is 'flipped' (2 edge pieces a swapped).

I use:

(R2 r2) B2 U2 (L l) U2 (R' r ') U2 (R r) U2 F2 (R r) F2 (L ' l ') B2 
(R2 r2).

Hope it helps :).

The shortest one isn't long... there's one with some 6-8 moves.

they show all six sides of a scrambled cube with some stickers 
missing. There's more to it, but I figure you can find the article 
on your own if you're interested.

One of their "Difficult" questions: "Suppose you are trying to twist 
a mixed-up cube back to its original position. How can you tell 
which face should be which color?"

Just thought you might be interested...

&gt; - Judges equiped with infra-red goggles.
&gt; Ok, ok... Forget it.

Hey wait, I like it! But I'd suggest this improvement: Timer *and* 
light are both triggered by the solver picking up the cube from the 
surface of the timer. That way we don't have to search for the cube 
first.

    Ok for Magic it's a joke, but for Clock I'm almost that bad. In 
competitions, pretty much the *only* thing I look for is the first 
move I'll do on the backside so that after flipping the clock I can 
continue smoothly. But I always do this and then realize I've looked 
at the wrong side, because of how clocks are scrambled and given to us 
in competitions, which differs from my practice (where I start with 
pins in random state rather than all up). And then I get angry at 
myself and do it again, this time using the other side :-)

&gt; What's the quickest algorithm to correct the orientation parity?  I

and 
&gt; just retains the 3x3x3 status of the 4x4x4 cube?

The one I came up with for the UuRr-4x4 is quite fast:
http://games.groups.yahoo.
com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/13698
(also have a look at the replies to that message).

In QTM it wins 24 to 25 against Chris's alg. Also, the second part in 
the "mirrored" (or whatever) version I mentioned is one long very fast 
finger trick:

First half:
(Rr)' U R U
[(Rr)' U2] * 3

Second half:
(Rr)2 U R' U' (Rr)2 U' R' U (Rr)'

What exactly do you mean with "quickest"? Btw, my alg was build around 
[(Rr)' U2]*4.5 but only allowing UuRr moves, so maybe something even 
better could be found allowing other moves as well.

And before I forget: Why do you ask? Any specific usage in mind?

    Hey Everyone,

I was walking next door to turn in a homework set and on the way, I got 
the idea of having a tournament in New York.  This would be in March, 
about March 20th.  Either on a Saturday evening or Sunday.  Anyway, if 
you are not subscribed to the Caltech yahoo groups:  
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/caltechrubiks/

I would suggest you sign-up because the organization and ideas will be 
in there and it's your chance, if you plan to attend, to help work out 
the details.

    I like the picture in the logo a lot, and perhaps this is a personal 
preference, but it would look more professional if the colors in the 
words were the same...or only varied per word, and not per letter.  
That's just my opinion though, you don't have to agree with it.

I really like the picture though, it's much more creative than what i 
was thinking of.  I was just kind of thinking of a hand with a cube

    I also eventually intend to include a rubik's logo on the center white piece eventually, as soon as I figure out which one they would prefer.  I can also change the text in any way they see fit.  that was the first thing that came to mind and I didn't play with it much before I was done.  thanks for the comments and please keep the suggestions coming.

    Hey!

It's just a cool subtlety if the logo shows an impossible state of 
the cube. What's so cool about that is that u probably need to be a 
cuber to understand that the state is impossible ;-)

I also agree that the text should preferably be so that each word has 
one color. And if alternating the color for each letter there should 
be 6 colors used, not 4. That's because a normal cube has 6 colors :-)

Happy cubing!!

    Hey, I had the same exact idea except I concluded that making letters
with the cube would be too hard to read so I changed my thoughts to
doing actual solid lettering over a faded cube with the yellow, red,
and blue faces showing and maybe a horizontal bar/streak through the
botton with "World Cubing Association" in it. I also think some sort
of element that makes it feel speedy or sporty would be good kind of
like the speed stacks logo.
I dont know if a rubik's logo would be good idea since I don't believe
 the WCA is affiliated with Rubik's at all(correct me if I'm wrong).
I'd make one myself, but I found my first attempts using photoshop
rather frustrating and unprofessional so i'll leave it to the pros.

    I was solving the 5x5x5 and unexpectedly I came upon a case where the
FRu and FRd edges were flipped. I couldn't get it to solve, so I
figured it must be some kind of parity error thing and so I took the
cube apart and put it back together.

However, if this happens again I'd like to know: Is this really a
parity error? Can this be solved without taking the cube apart? If so,
what is a good algorithm to use?

I haven't found any half-decent sites for 5x5x5 solving; it's not like
I can't do it on my own, but when this comes up I'm totally lost.

    if you dont wanna take it apart, go get silicon oil or
spray, the ones that have a spray straw included, and
jamm it b/n the pieces and spray!

it gets really stiff right after spraying, but you can
put on a hair dryer and keep twisting it while you
blow  warm air onto it, its what i do :P

    The way the cube is looks very unprofessional, as does the fact that
there's just a plain white background. I like the idea of having a WCA
on the cube, though.

As the WCA includes 5x5x5s, I think it would be cool to take a picture
of a hand with the WCA logo on a 5x5x5 - which would make the letters
look more realistic - and then use the Photoshop function that changes
the picture to a few different tones. The hand and cube might look
cartoonish enough and yet real enough to look nice for a logo. Maybe.

    Hey,

My Eastsheen 5x5x5 cube was fairly stiff before I lubed it, but
afterwards it was very, very slick.  The best way to go about it is to
pop off one of the center caps (mine weren't glued down very well at
all) and unscrew it.  Then you have to CAREFULLY lift up either the top
layer or the top two layers at once.  

I don't remember exactly, but it might be best to have an empty cup
standing up right next to your cube to rest the top two layers on.
You'll know what I mean when you get the top layer off.  If you try to
set it on your desk, or try to take out one piece at a time, you're
probably going to end up with a bunch of seemingly random pieces that
will give you trouble when you try to put them back together.  If you
hold them together, they should stay together and after you lube it you
can just set the top layer(s) back ontop and put the screw back in.

Hope it helps,
Doug

    Personally, I think the best way to lube a cube is as described on 
gilles site.  You take it apart, clean it, line up the pieces in 
gruops of four (look at the picture),then i wipe it off and wait for 
it to dry.  Put it back together, and voila!

I've found that if the cube sticks to itself, like...if you just 
spray into it, then the cube does not work as well.  A light coating 
that dries before you put it back together has worked much better for 
me.

    I also uploaded an idea, but it's in "Photos/stefan". After finally 
understanding how "WCA" is written on Mike's cube (took me maybe 
reading 5 replies and 10 minutes) I think though that his is already 
much better (at least the cube part).

Btw, "Association" is a very very bad word. Very long and you have to 
be careful to not let the reader notice the first three letters 
separated from the rest (in my picture I tried to write two letters of 
"Association" on each sticker, so on top it'd start with "A" and "ss". 
Brilliant word!).

    Hey!

&gt;From my experience it matters little how u actually apply the 
silicone spray. What i have found is that the eastsheen varieties 
only need a very small amount of the silicone to turn nicely. 
However, what matters most for them is which type of silicone u use. 
I have bad experience with petroleum based silicone spray on them. 
Petroleum based silicone spray is however excellent on the rubiks.com 
cube varieties. I'm not sure why it is like like this, but i suppose 
it's just different kinds of plastic being used. There has been lots 
of posts in the past about this, so just do a search and u will find 
lots of good info, also with particular brands of silicone spray 
mentioned :-)

Best of luck :-)

-Per

PS! Other stuff that has been recommended as lubricants are vaseline 
and olive oil (extra virgin? ... probably not). Some also claim that 
the plastic is somewhat self lubricating due to fine dust being 
formed. I don't think that this is the case for the eastsheen cubes 
though. Getting a good non-petroleum based silicone is ur best option.

PPS! Don't disassemble the eastsheen cubes too many times. Only do 
this when u have to lube them. Otherwise they become too loose and 
will start popping annoyingly :-S

&gt; Personally, I think the best way to lube a cube is as described on 
&gt; gilles site.  You take it apart, clean it, line up the pieces in 
&gt; gruops of four (look at the picture),then i wipe it off and wait 
for 
&gt; it to dry.  Put it back together, and voila!
&gt; 
&gt; I've found that if the cube sticks to itself, like...if you just 
&gt; spray into it, then the cube does not work as well.  A light 
coating 
&gt; that dries before you put it back together has worked much better 
for 
&gt; me.

&gt; However, if this happens again I'd like to know: Is this really a

Well, it is a problem involving permutation parity... you've reached 
a state of odd parity (for those "wing" pieces).  Perhaps you do most 
of your solving using 3-cycles (I know I do), but 3-cycles are even 
permutations, so they can't be combined to make a swap of a single 
pair of pieces.

For a good introduction to permutation parity (and a lot of other 
useful ideas), see Jaap's Puzzle Page:

http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/theory.htm

&gt; Can this be solved without taking the cube apart?

Yes, since you scrambled the cube without taking it apart ;)

If you'd like to solve this problem yourself (sounds as if you might 
want to), have a think about each of the possible kinds of moves you 
can make on the 5x5x5 and see which kind is an odd perm of the "wing" 
pieces. Apply a move of this kind, and fix the mess (it isn't a 
serious mess), by using the even permutations you already know. Then 
maybe try to optimize the procedure.

Have fun!
Mike

Btw, a bit more searching of the web (even this forum?) will turn up 
some reasonably short readymade sequences to do the job.

Just a smear on the curved internal surfaces will do: putting it on 
the flat surfaces may gum it up. I think the difference compared with 
Rubiks/Mefferts is that the pieces are more accurately molded, so 
that there are large areas in contact (rather than just contact at 
the "high" points) and less room for excess lubricant to escape to.

&gt; PS! Other stuff that has been recommended as lubricants are 
vaseline 

No, no! That's another Deadly Sin.  And the wages of Sin are Puzzle 
Death.  Don't risk it, unless (as suggested by Josef) you need to 
break in a puzzle quickly; that shouldn't be needed here.

&gt; PPS! Don't disassemble the eastsheen cubes too many times. Only do

It shouldn't get loose if you dismantle it by unscrewing a centre 
piece.

    Hey!

If u clean all the cubies before lubing it with silicone, then i 
guess the silicone "film" will prevent the self-dusting to happen to 
a large extent. So i guess it's not really a big problem. But the 
silicone "film" does wear off and/or mixes with dirt. That's why u 
need reapply the silicone every now and then.

    Hello all,

Since I didn't get any further with this, I will post it here until 
it gets too old (maybe it already is too old, let's just hope...).

I managed to find a Devil's Algorithm for the sub-group R2U2L2D2 
(yeah, it's not even the half-move group...), and I'm going to 
explain here how I found it. For those of you less patient, the alg 
is at the bottom of the post. 

Let's start with the simplest possible subgroup, that is R2U2. It is 
pretty obviuous that the Devil's algorithm for it is just (R2 U2)*5 
R2, that is 11 moves (there are 12 possible position on the whole, 
and no position repeats in the algorithm I just gave, so it works.) 
After I got here, I tried to expand it to a larger group, it being 
for the moment R2U2L2. Since this subgroup already has many more 
possible positions, let's do some important notices:

1)There are certain groups of pieces which never break up, for 
example the "column" made of the UFR, UR and UBR pieces. The other 
kind of piece consists of two opposite edges on the same face 
together with the center between them (we can for the moment regard 
them as a whole), for example the three pieces UF, U and UB. So 
we'll call these two kinds of "blocks" "column" and "oppedge" 
(coming from opposite edges, please suggest a better name if you 
find one).

2)Columns never change orientation, and oppedges never change 
position, i.e. they don't permute. So all we got to worry about is 
the permutation of columns and the orientation of oppedges.

Let's calculate the number of possible positions in this subgroup. 
There are 4 columns which can permute in 4!=24 ways, and three 
oppedges which can have 2^3=8 orientations, on the whole 24*8=192, 
but we have to divide by 2 because the orientation of oppedges + the 
permutation of columns must be even, so on the whole we have 96 
possible positions. Our Devil's algorithm for this subgroup must be 
95 moves long.

My idea was to use the Devil's algorithm for the R2U2 subgroup, 
combining it with all the possible positions for the pieces at the L 
oppedge (orientation of L oppedge) and the LD column. So if
(D)(R2U2) = the Devil's algorithm for the subgroup R2U2, then (D)
(R2U2L2) would be the form ((D)(R2U2))A((D)(R2U2))A......A((D)
(R2U2)), with (D)(R2U2) appearing 8 times and A standing for a move 
sequence which changes the position of the L oppedge and LB column. 
If we want our final algorithm to be optimal, we have to take A only 
one move long, and since we have no other option to change the 
position of the above mentioned oppedge and column than to turn the 
face L, then, A=L2.

This obviously doesn't work. Why? (D)(R2U2) has the effect of U2, so 
a sequence of alternating U2 and L2 moves would lead to the solved 
state sooner than needed. But we can still use this, and then insert 
somehow the moves needed to add the extra positions needed. These 
positions (two in number) are the ones where we have the RD column 
in LD, with the L oppedge being oriented either way. Now let's see 
what the incompleted Devil's Algorithm looks like.

((D)(R2U2))L2((D)(R2U2))L2((D)(R2U2))L2((D)(R2U2))L2((D)(R2U2))L2((D)
(R2U2)) = (((D)(R2U2))L2)*5 ((D)(R2U2))

It is 6*11+5=71 moves long. We need to insert 24 more moves to 
account for the missing positions. Now let's break it so that we can 
see where we insert the two other positions.

First 12 moves are

R2 U2 [R2] U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 L2

This has the same effect as

R2 U2 L2. [R2] L2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 L2

only that it gets two more positions. At the dot after the first L2 
the RD column is in LD. So we can insert here (D)(R2U2) for getting 
12 more positions. We can put U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 
instead of the R2 in square brackets, and so we get 12 more 
positions. Convince yourselves with the following alg:

R2 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*5 U2 L2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 L2

which is 24 moves long instead of the original 12, so we have 12 
positions left. Notice that after these 24 moves the L oppedge is 
orientated the other way than at the very beginning, so that we can 
repeat the maneuver to get the 12 positions left. So the first 24 
moves of the original incomplete algorithm were

((R2 U2)*5 R2 L2)*2

and now they are

R2 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*5 U2 L2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 L2

which is the same as

(R2 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*5 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*4 L2)*2

The new sequence is 48 moves long instead of the original 24, so 
exactly 24 new positions have been added. The devils's algorithm for 
the subgroup R2U2L2 is

(R2 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*5 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*4 L2)*2 ((R2 U2)*5 R2 L2)*3 (R2 U2)
*5 R2

I must now confess that I was thrilled when I found it. I had found 
an optimal Devil's algorithm 95 moves long! But now, it's so easy to 
make it twice as long, by finding the Devil's algorithm for the 
subgroup R2U2L2D2, which brings us to the second part of this post.


You probably have noticed that the trick for inserting additional 
positions in the middle of an already existing Devil's algorithm was 
to add two L2 moves before and after a R2 move, so that nothing 
messed up really. We are going to do same thing here. But first, the 
basics.

The subgroup R2U2L2D2 has twice as many positions as the R2U2L2 one, 
since we add the possible orientation of the D oppedge. On the whole 
192 positions, so the Devil's algorithm must be 191 moves long.

I'm now going to mention an important property of any Devil's 
algorithm: A Devil's algorithm is said to be cyclic, if after you 
apply it to a certain position, you are only one move away from that 
same position. In the case of (D)(R2U2L2), that move is L2.

Now, since we want to move the D oppedge too for getting (D)
(R2U2L2D2), we want to insert two D2 moves before and after a U2 
move, and then applying the whole (D)(R2U2L2) in between, so that we 
double the number of positions and hence we get the desired (D)
(R2U2L2D2). Since the (D)(R2U2L2) is completed by the move L2, and 
not U2, we cannot insert it at the end. Now we'll make use of the 
propoerty that this Devil's algorithm is cyclic, and we are going to 
write

(R2 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*5 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*4 L2)*2 ((R2 U2)*5 R2 L2)*3 (R2 U2)
*5 R2 L2

which gets us into the same position i.e. the solved position. Now, 
if we start from another point inside this alg, we can still get a 
Devil's algorithm if we cut the last move down. If this move is U2, 
then we can safely insert the whole algorithm at the new end , and 
we'll get the (D)(R2U2L2D2). So we can for instance have

(R2 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*5 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*4 L2)*2 ((R2 U2)*5 R2 L2)*3 (R2 U2)
*5 R2 L2

=

R2 L2 (R2 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*5 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*4 L2)*2 ((R2 U2)*5 R2 L2)*3 
(R2 U2)*5

=

R2 L2 (R2 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*5 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*4 L2)*2 ((R2 U2)*5 R2 L2)*3 
(R2 U2)*4 R2 U2

so now it ends in U2. Take it out, and the new (D)(R2U2L2) is

R2 L2 (R2 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*5 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*4 L2)*2 ((R2 U2)*5 R2 L2)*3 
(R2 U2)*4 R2

Now we can safely add the D2 moves, so that (D)(R2U2L2D2) is

(D)(R2U2L2) D2 (D)(R2U2L2) D2

This obviously gets back to the solved position, but it's anyway 192 
moves long, so tripping the last D2 would be just good. So there we 
go:

(D)(R2U2L2D2)=

R2 L2 (R2 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*5 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*4 L2)*2 ((R2 U2)*5 R2 L2)*3 
(R2 U2)*4 R2 D2 R2 L2 (R2 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*5 U2 L2 (U2 R2)*4 L2)*2 ((R2 
U2)*5 R2 L2)*3 (R2 U2)*4 R2

    Hello Everyone.

I know that the World Rubik's Games Championship 2005 will be held on
November 5th and 6th in Orlando, Florida at Disney World.

Is there any information available regarding hotels? I think I heard
somewhere that there was a 'Rubik's Cube' hotel or something like that
at/or close to Disney World. Will there be any discounts available at
any local hotels? Where will most of you guys be staying?

I was just trying to make my travel plans a little more concrete so I
could save some cash on the plane tickets and rooms. Please let me
know if you have anymore information.

    Hi Everyone,

The Caltech Rubik's Cube Club will be accepting designs for the spring 
tournament on April 16.  The front side will have the WCA logo on it so 
the design is for the back side.  One color... should have the 
information Caltech, Spring Tournament, April 16, 2005, and whatever 
else you think is necessary.  I mean, it can be Caltech or California 
Institute of Technology or whatever...

Anyway, submit your designs in the Caltech Rubik's Cube group and the 
selected designer will receive a free t-shirt or a few.

I was just wondering how many of you cubers are musicians?  A few of 
you guys seem to be at music conservatories as well... I was just 
curious.  Music seems to go with math and the cube seems to go with 
math as well.

How funny would it be to form a quartet at the WC 2005?!?

I've been playing violin for 9 years and clarinet for 2 years. I 
also play some piano, but I only took lessons for two, years, now I 
play on my own. And I want to go to a conservatory. I'm now 15 and 
I'm in the 10th grade, so after 2 years I'll know.

But I don't think I'm coming to the WC 2005 :(, it's too far away...

    Hey!

I don't use ur method, but from what i heard in the past i estimate 
that the breakdown is approximately like this :

centers : 20% of the time
pairing up edges : 40% of the time
solve as 3x3x3+parity fix : 40% of the time

So from ur 30 secs doing centers u should be around 2:30 in total. 
But as i said it's just an estimate. U might have a particularly 
slow or fast stage :-)

Good luck getting faster :-)

what's waiting for you to be checked out:

* My personal/official records
* My tournament record
* The return of ImageCube
* 114 F2L algorithms for the ZB system
* 5 speedcubing videos including 3 exclusive first releases ;)

Of course, all to be found at:

    Hi friends,

There is so much talent in this group!
So there must be some guys able and willing to design the WCA 
website: http://www.worldcubeassociation.org

Required: creativity, time, dedication and some technical experience.

Offered: being part of a team of fools who love cubing and do 
everything for free. :-)

Maintaining speedcubing.com is taking a lot of time already, so we 
really need help.

Basically what we need is:
= a site that looks like what you would expect from an official 
organization: professional and interesting
= loads fast
= simple, not too much technique behind it (we prefer: (X)HTML, CSS, 
PHP, ECMAScript, MySQL, but no extensive content management system 
like Mambo)

The site will offer all official stuff and the rest will be a 
slightly interactive site with interesting functionality.
Ideas:
= organization information (board, reports and so on)
= regulations (including tournament information sets)
= events (past and upcoming)
= records and rankings
= profiles (interactive stuff)
= news
= contact information
and so on.

Examples:
 http://www.iaaf.org/
 http://www.uefa.com/
 http://www.fina.org/
but feel free to post ideas!

Applications:
Make an example website (very rough design).
Send us an e-mail.

We are looking forward to hear from you.

Have fun,

Ron

    The other day at school, one of my friends managed to break off one 
of the face pieces on my rubiks revenge.  As I was supergluing it 
back into place, the warning about speedcubing on the revenge came to 
mind.  I realize that this cube will probably never be fit for 
speedcubing, but where can I get a sturdy 4x4x4, or how do I get a 
regular one up for the challenge?

    Hello everybody!

I¬¥m new to this group and quite new to speedcubing. I am very
determined to become fast (sub-20 or close to it) and have been
training and searching the web for different tips and advices. One
page if often find refeneces to is Dan Knight¬¥s page but all the links
return me with a message that the page isn¬¥t found on the server.
Could someone tell me the new URL of the page or does the page not
exist any more (or am I just too stupid to open it)?

    I heard he moved to North Carolina.  Back in September of 2003 after I 
had just started cubing, I e-mailed him asking if he would autograph a 
cube for me.  (I think I was at 90 seconds average back then)  He said 
he was going on vacation but he would be happy to meet me at a BART 
(subway) station in the Bay Area the week afterwards.  I never got 
another e-mail response after that...

    Yeah, I'd totally be up for the dinner!  So the class meets on Mondays 
from 4 to 5 PM.  Maybe they would be interested in having some guests 
go and give a talk or whatever?  I doubt the class facilitators 
(students teaching the class) can average faster than 45 seconds... 
otherwise there's a good chance we would have heard of them.  How can 
you study the Fridrich method's websites (as advertised on the 
syllabus) without coming across speedcubing.com?  And how can you get 
faster than 45 seconds without succumbing to the obsession which is 
this yahoo group?  I guess it is possible... in my experience, there 
are only a handful of cubers out there that would be considered "speed 
cubers" who have no knowledge of this cubing community.

Sounds like we almost have an band! :) I think we're still missing

    Does anyone have any good patterns for the Professor Cube (5x5x5),
other than Randelshofer (whose site I've already seen)? Where are they?

By the way, I found that if you apply the superflip to the (1 3 1)
cube (using only moves turning one layer) and then to the (2 1 2) cube
(using only moves turning two layers) on the same 5x5x5 you get a
really nice pattern which drapes over to the sides. Try it! It's cool!

    Although I'm not really answering your question, my
suggestion for anyone solving larger cubes is to solve
 the centers last. You for all practical purposes
eliminate all the parity problems I always here people
talk about. I solve the larger cubes in this order.
First the centers on two opposite sides. Second the
eight corner pieces. Third all the edge pieces. Fourth
the center pieces on the four remaining centers. Just
my thought on the subject.

Sorry if I go on for a while, but I'm studying Computer Graphics as a

The first one was simpler and made a pretty good impression, but the

were better

The second one, I think, has a better final screen, but the animation
into it is not well lit.  Plus the cube growing into the the world

I would personally suggest the first one, minus the W and A as a

Or perhaps because the cube is such a geometrical entity would a flash

    Hello,

Thanks for commenting.
My submissions are just ideas, they're the result of a 2 hour work of
a beginner in CG. Trajectories are not what they should, and the earth
should morph into the cube.
The important thing is to propose a logo, and I thought it could be
interesting to show it in 3D.
I like the idea of a cube as a globe. 'Worldwide'. But a thinner stand
would be better.
I like some other submissions too (http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/).

I'm sure you can produce much better animations and lighting. If you
have time, maybe you could try?

Gilles.

   <div class="email-content">
    After 40 years (at the age of 71) I've finally solved the cube using
the instructions at:

http://www.olympus.net/personal/prmhem/default.htm

This solution is simple, and involves hardly any memorisation, which
suits me at my age.

My problem is that there are about 25% of all cubes that I can't
solve, because I don't understand the instructions that relate to that
25%.

Perhaps one of the experienced cubists out there could help me to
understand the instructions - even if they don't use that specific
method.

The instructions relate to "Step Three: Top Edge Pieces", which is on
the page:

http://www.olympus.net/personal/prmhem/step_three.htm

About half-way down the page, there's a group of three consecutive
paragraphs. The first paragraph begins:

"In the fourth case all three top edge pieces on the top face are in
their proper position relative to each other."

The third paragraph of the group ends:

"Continue in this fashion until, in the fourth turn of the green face
the last white edge piece (in this case the white/orange piece)
returns to the top face of the cube and the fourth center section edge
piece moves into place at front/right."

In fact, this last sentence is the only sentence in the whole page
that I don't understand. I don't know what the author means by
"Continue in this fashion"  :-)

Could some kind person please give the actual sequence of moves. They
can use text instructions (as in the web page), or they can use things
like RL'U''L, or whatever.

Alan

OK, at this point (fig 6h) the green face has been moved twice... it 
needs to move twice more: once to put the white-green piece into 
position, displacing white-orange to the middle layer; and once more 
to move white-orange into position.  

So the sequence is U' R U' R'

The thing, though, is to figure out why you are doing this: the nice 
thing about Philip Marshall's solution is that it proceeds by 
understanding, rather than blind application of hard-to-remember 
sequences (and still doesn't take very many turns).

Hope this helps :)

...except that you need a final U in this case, if you want the U

    Hi Mike,

Thanks for your solution. Now I can solve all the cubes  :-)

I entirely agree with your comment that Philip Marshall's solution
"proceeds by understanding, rather than blind application of
hard-to-remember sequences".

There's no way (at my age) that I could memorize, for example, the
solution that I was experimenting with just before I stumbled across
Philip Marshall's solution:

http://puzzlesolver.com/puzzle.php?id=29

My grandchildren understood Marshall's solution without difficulty
(apart from the missing info that you have just provided).

Regards,
Alan

it

    I really like idea of the cube in a globe stand... doubles as the C
and everything... very interesting.
In max, there is a deformer called "spherify" I think that should
morph the globe into the cube.  Also,  if you make 2 maps and use a
mix map (can't remember the real name) you can animate the change
between them.
put in a backlight so we can see the back of the globe, or if you're
going for a more planetary feel,  change the background to black.

About Flash, as far as I know, you need a program called Macromedia
Flash to make animations. You can convert AVI to swf files,  but they
end up BIG.  Flash is a vector tool, this means that everything is
stored as a math formula rather than a dot on screen (Which is why you
can scale them indefinitely)  much like the spline in MAX.

This is your idea, and I'm just trying to help you make it excellent.
 It's the teacher in me.

&gt; My submissions are just ideas, they're the result of a 2 hour work of

&gt; The important thing is to propose a logo, and I thought it could be

&gt; &gt; Sorry if I go on for a while, but I'm studying Computer Graphics as a

&gt; &gt; The first one was simpler and made a pretty good impression, but the

&gt; &gt; were better
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The second one, I think, has a better final screen, but the animation

&gt; &gt; seems a bit awkward. if you want to keep that idea, perhaps a
&gt; &gt; different way to get the cube into the stand would help(but bomb
&gt; &gt; routines are bad)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would personally suggest the first one, minus the W and A as a

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Or perhaps because the cube is such a geometrical entity would a flash

    Hey all,

 Does anyone have any suggestions for recognizing the first pair after the cross is done when completing F2L? I seem to be taking the longest time, on average with the first pair then my wasted time seems to get better as I move onto next pair.
i.e.

- 1st pair longest
- 2nd pair not as long as 1st pair
- 3rd pair not as long as 2nd pair
- 4th pair not as long as 3rd pair


Thanks Dwayne

    Hi Esad,

   Very interesting. I solve the 4-by the same way. For step three, 
in what order do you do the edge pieces? I pair up the middle edge 
pairs and put them in place first.

    On Jessica Fridrich's website, Guus Razoux Schultz states that there 
are 21 distinct algorithms for CLL and 17 for ELL.  I recently tried 
to verify this, but found 23 for CLL. (I agree with 17 for the ELL 
case, which is much easier to check.)

Can anyone here confirm that 21 is correct for CLL? 

Note that for these purposes, 2 algorithms are "distinct" if they are 
not related by rotation (naturally), reflection, or "time-reversal": 
i.e., inversion of the algorithm -- which may also be combined with 
the spatial symmetry operations.

It wouldn't be hard to write a program to do the check, but probably 
it is not worth doing it for just one problem :)

    Hey!

My steps for the larger cubes are like this:

1) First layer - intuitive

2) Middle layer edges
U only need as many algs as the number of middle layers, and those 
algs only differ with 2 moves (the layer specific ones).

3) Last layer corners
Only a few basic algs are needed for positioning and orientation

4) Last layer edges
A few basic commutator 3-cycles that u do fast when u know how they 
work. It takes some practice to see how to set them up though. There 
is only 1 parity fix which is quite easy.

5) All remaining centers.

As u can see from the records at www.speedcubing.com im pretty fast 
with it. What times do u achieve w ur method Esad? (and David).

    Hey Dwayne,

This same situation used to haunt me every time I solved the cube.  I
would often find a good or decent cross, but lose time trying to find
the first pair and end up wasting my good cross solve.

At least for me, having been cubing for a while, I can now look back
and say that I was going WAY too fast on the cross.

I have also had the opportunity of teaching a lot of people in person.
   Every time I had someone say they were having the same problem of
trying to find the first pair after the cross, whenever I watched them
solve they too were solving the cross WAY too quickly.

The best thing to realize is that for the F2L you don't really need to
go quickly, just smoothly.  The F2L (optimally) should take 32 moves
on average, based on Ron's 100 average on speedcubing.com.  If you do
only two moves per second, but smoothly, you will solve the F2L in 16
seconds, which is pretty good despite turning so slowly.

Here are the best tips I've heard and/or used myself for improving this.

1) Use all 15 seconds of the inspection and make sure you know the
cross so well that even after having put the cube down to start the
timer, you can jump right into solving it.  I've heard people suggest
practicing just doing the cross blindfolded.  So examine for 15
seconds, then solve the cross with your eyes closed and see if it worked.

2) If you have an easy cross, and you are able to see it in less than
15 seconds, then spend the remainder of your inspection time looking
for the general area of where some other pieces might end up.  You
don't need to know exactly that the red/blue/yellow corner will end up
in UFR and be rotated clockwise, just get a general idea.  It is
enough to know that one of the corners for a CE pair MIGHT be on the
left side rather than the right, things like that.

3) When actually solving the cross, go actually slow.  Not slow-fast
or smoothly fast, but actually slow.  This may seem like you are
wasting time by not going quickly, but you will be able to track that
corner that you thought MIGHT end up on the left side of the cube.  If
you go actually slow (again not slow-fast, smoothly fast, or anything
like that) then I guarantee that every single time you will have
hardly any delay at all from the cross to the first pair.

4) When solving the first pair, speed up to about 50-70% speed and try
to look around for other pieces.  Now this time you actually want to
be going slow-fast, not actually slow.  You should be moving along
fairly quickly during the first pair, but still nowhere near full speed.

5) When solving the third pair speed up very slightly again to maybe
70%-80% speed.  Again try to look around to get the general idea of
where those last pair pieces are going to be.

6) On the last pair go as fast as your hands will allow you to turn
the faces without popping.  You are going to jump into the last layer
steps (whether OLL or a 3 look LL) randomly anyway, so you might as
well save some time by going absolutely break neck speed on the last
F2L pair.

Again, that is what helped me, but everyone has their own style.  I
would experiment with the stuff above, and see how it works for you.

I think you forget the "sleepers", i.e. the people who were fast in 
the early 80s, gave up in the meantime because everybody around them 
stopped it and who just haven't come across our community. I think 
there are *lots* of unknown people out there who could solve the cube

I guess you'll contact the organizers of the course, can you also ask

Actually, I've just found that the "distinct" ELL cases are listed at 

http://rokumentai.akimoto3.com/GRSM-e4.htm

and that there are 18 (I'd missed one), so perhaps GRS's numbers 
shouldn't be taken seriously.  Nor mine :(

Unfortunately, the CLL cases at

http://rokumentai.akimoto3.com/GRSM-e3.htm

have not been reduced in the same way. (Why not?)

    Hi Per,

   Nice variation. What is your sequence for doing the corners center 
and edges for
first layer? 

   I haven't tried to become fast on the 4-by or the 5-by, the cubes 
I have (so far) simply will not turn fast at all.

&gt; Hey!
&gt; 
&gt; My steps for the larger cubes are like this:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) First layer - intuitive
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Middle layer edges
&gt; U only need as many algs as the number of middle layers, and those 
&gt; algs only differ with 2 moves (the layer specific ones).
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Last layer corners
&gt; Only a few basic algs are needed for positioning and orientation
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Last layer edges
&gt; A few basic commutator 3-cycles that u do fast when u know how they 
&gt; work. It takes some practice to see how to set them up though. 
There 
&gt; is only 1 parity fix which is quite easy.
&gt; 
&gt; 5) All remaining centers.
&gt; 
&gt; As u can see from the records at www.speedcubing.com im pretty fast 
&gt; with it. What times do u achieve w ur method Esad? (and David).
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers!

&gt; &gt; Although I'm not really answering your question, my

&gt; &gt; eliminate all the parity problems I always here people
&gt; &gt; talk about. I solve the larger cubes in this order.
&gt; &gt; First the centers on two opposite sides. Second the
&gt; &gt; eight corner pieces. Third all the edge pieces. Fourth
&gt; &gt; the center pieces on the four remaining centers. Just
&gt; &gt; my thought on the subject.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I was solving the 5x5x5 and unexpectedly I came upon
&gt; &gt; &gt; a case where the
&gt; &gt; &gt; FRu and FRd edges were flipped. I couldn't get it to
&gt; &gt; &gt; solve, so I
&gt; &gt; &gt; figured it must be some kind of parity error thing
&gt; &gt; &gt; and so I took the
&gt; &gt; &gt; cube apart and put it back together.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; However, if this happens again I'd like to know: Is
&gt; &gt; &gt; this really a
&gt; &gt; &gt; parity error? Can this be solved without taking the
&gt; &gt; &gt; cube apart? If so,
&gt; &gt; &gt; what is a good algorithm to use?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't found any half-decent sites for 5x5x5
&gt; &gt; &gt; solving; it's not like

I don't understand how he can get 21 distinct sequences. In my

    There an alg on the 3-by for flipping over two opposite edges on 
the Last Level: R' u R2 u2 R' U2 R u2 R2 u' R U2 (small case letters 
mean the middle slices only).

   Essentially you are doing something to one piece which messes up 
part of the cube, then doing the reverse to the other piece - undoing 
the mess.

   If I understand your 5-by problem right, rotate your cube (QR) to 
put the flipped edges on Last Level. Make the move f' then do the alg 
shown above: R' u R2 u2 R' U2 R u2 R2 u' R U2 then move f. 

   Should I call you "double q double u" for short?

Regards,

David J

When I do f'R'uR2u2R'U2Ru2R2u'RU2f like you suggested, two edges are flipped. Unfortunately, I can do that,
but I need to keep the edges unflipped but flip the pieces between the edges and the corners.

I realized, though, that actually the parity move used in the 4^3 to flip a single edge would work for this situation.
It looks like it only comes up 10% of the time, oddly enough, but when it does I'll just do the extra 15 moves.

You can call me "double q double u" if you want, but I'd prefer mzrg or qq.

    Hi Mike, 

I am glad you are interested in CLL&gt;ELL approach. 

http://rokumentai.akimoto3.com/GRSM-e4.htm
My ELL page is one of my oldest pages from my 25-year-old memmory. 

http://rokumentai.akimoto3.com/GRSM-e3.htm
CLL page was made from Ron's site with some modification. 

I initially made these pages to learn CLL&gt;ELL system for myself. 
Since ELL recognition is much easier than CLL, and 
reverse and mirror movements are also not difficult, 
I didn't add those reverse and mirros. 

I was new for CLL when I made this page. 
My purpose was not categorization but easy recognition, 
so I included reverse and mirrors as different algorithms.
As you see in my another page, you can find more algorithms for ELL. 

To answer your question, I checked all reverse and mirror cases. 
21 for CLL seems correct. 

&gt;From my site, 
http://rokumentai.akimoto3.com/GRSM-e3.htm
I can reduce the number as follow if I count reverse and mirrors in 
one group. 
4 corners oriented: 2 cases from 2. 
2 corners oriented: 9 cases from 18. 
1 corner oriented: 3 cases from 12.
no corner oriented: 7 cases from 10. 
Total: 21 cases.

    cool! :)

there are some serious cubers here, for real. cubing
to the extreme such that nothing matters.

take me for instance, cubed till i drop and nose bleed
and fail my finals lol :(

got a friend into cubing and now he average 35~ in
just a month, not to mention failing his finals in ths
semester cos he cubed too much :(

oh well, i will like to meet you too, hopefully tyson
will be free soon, then we can hang out at his place.

    Hi Masayuki,

&gt; [...]
&gt; To answer your question, I checked all reverse and mirror cases. 
&gt; 21 for CLL seems correct. 

Wow, you confirm it's 21??!!?!?

&gt; From my site, 
&gt; http://rokumentai.akimoto3.com/GRSM-e3.htm
&gt; I can reduce the number as follow if I count reverse and mirrors in 
&gt; one group. 
&gt; 4 corners oriented: 2 cases from 2. 
&gt; 2 corners oriented: 9 cases from 18. 
&gt; 1 corner oriented: 3 cases from 12.
&gt; no corner oriented: 7 cases from 10. 
&gt; Total: 21 cases. 

I must be blind, I can't see how you can compute 21. For example, with
1 corner oriented, I agree with the total of 12 cases (rotations
excluded). But take these 5 sequences (from your page):
- R'U2RUR'UR
- B'U2BL'BLB'UB'UB
- RB'R'BU2BU2B'
- R'FU2F'RFR'U2RF'
- BU'F'UB'U'F

How can you reduce them to only 3?


Gilles.

    Hi all!

The fact that there is some dispute does suggest that the problem 
isn't completely trivial ;)

Thanks, Gilles, for pointing me to Helmstetter's tables -- the 
website address I had for these was dead.  I've checked and found 
that I made an error on Helmstetter's cases 20 and 21, which had made 
me think they were equivalent.

So there do seem to be 24 nontrivial, "distinct" patterns.

Masayuki: thanks for explaining why you didn't reduce the corners 
cases -- recognition does seem difficult to me (perhaps _too_ 
difficult), so your table should be helpful, if I start using this 
technique for LL.

Ryan: the CLL table at www.speedcubing.com doesn't take account of 
reflection/inversion, so it has the same 42 cases that Masayuki 
lists.

    Hi Dwayne,

I recognize this problem from when I began cubing. After the cross, 
I would sometimes freeze for a couple of seconds. The transition 
between cross and first CE-pair is really crucial. I think Chris' 
tips, and a lot of practice will really help you out with that.

I general, you should remember that, even though we call 
it 'speedcubing', turning speed is not the most important. There 
should be a balance between your turning speed and smoothness/being 
relaxed.

Good luck,

Joel.

    Hey all!

I have been cubing since May last year and quite quickly got into 
speedcubing. I found Lars Petrus site and liked the idea  (and his 
javacubes =D ) so I started using his method.

I¬¥m still using his method and for the moment I average around 35 
seconds with my best times a little under 30. I have now started to 
train on different things I know I need to improve on. My biggest 
problem is to be able to stay one step ahead all the time. For the 
moment it feels a bit frustruating because I feel that I¬¥m not 
improving at all.

So how long did it take for you to reach sub-30 and sub-20 averages? 
And every advice on how to practice is also more than welcome.

    nice man :)

i originally used lars method too.
but the trouble i had was that i could not find the
pieces for the 2x2 block fast enough :(

i switched to fridrich system and have been using it
ever since,

took me 4 weeks learn everything, f2l,oll and pll
and about another 4 weeks to master it (frankly you
start forgeting oll :D )

yeah takes about 2 months of extreme dedication to
achieve sub-30 with sacrifices of course,

in all you will need about half a year or a full year
if you cube "normally" to get under 20, personally my
average is 26.78, and my best single solves were
18.17, 19.23. 18.40

:P

remember looking ahead really, no two ways about that
and plz go slow on the f2l

laterz!

practice practice!

I tried the version in the Files section and was having some 
trouble. As suggested in a previous post, I created a run.bat file 
with java -jar JNetCube.jar but couldn't get it running. I'm sure 
there's a very simple answer to this. I've probably just got some

I'm definitely keen to sort this out on my machine because JNetCube

I have no problems finding the 2x2x2 fast enough but until reacently I 
have had a hard time finding the cubies for the 2x2x3 but I think I 
have found a good method to keep track of (some of) them now. I¬¥m 
trying to go slow on F2L but some times I¬¥m just carried away and then 
it hits me back hard :)

This is currently the method I am using:

My question is what algorithms do the quickest speed cubers learn?

I was look at some of the algorithms out there for solving the F2L, 
like the ones at speedcubing.com. Then I ran across Nathan Christie's 
Optimized F2L algorithms in which each case is solved by a series of 
triggers. This method seems much superior to me. Not only are you 
able to execute the triggers very quickly, but they also seem easier 
to memorize. Most cases are solved with one of five triggers on 
either the R or F sides with a couple of U turns thrown in.

Any opinions either way?

You can download the latest version of JNetCube here:

http://www.plu.edu/~huntca/jnetcube.html

The link to the latest Java Runtime Environment is on that page too,
so you can grab that if you need it.

If you are running Windows, then you can execute JNetCube by just
double-clicking the JNetCube.jar (after you have installed the latest
JRE).

Hi Jasmine, if you have Windows XP you will need to install Java in order 
to get the applet to run.

You can download Java here -

    Hi,

 

If you solve with the cross on bottom, then I personally believe that the
quickest algorithms are those that involve R, U and F only.

Maybe some fast cubers would look at and use my algorithms (although I
cannot really take credit for them as I initially learnt how to solve the
F2L using Peter Jansen's pages at
http://www.speedcubing.com/peter/AllesFastTwoLayer.html ), I am quite fast
myself and I have had a lot of positive feedback. You can find my F2L pages
at www.cubestation.co.uk &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/&gt;  and look at the
algorithm section in the orange panel.

 

Also Lars Vandenbergh has a great set of algorithms for the Last Layer, his
page is at www.cubezone.be &lt;http://www.cubezone.be/&gt; 

 

Dan Harris :-)

    Hey there,

Nathan Christies algorithms look nice, but they are definitely not 
superiour to other F2L algorithms. In fact, I think the algorithms 
are really the same, but his notations shows that a lot of algoritms 
are 'macros' of 'triggers' or elementary moves. You also mentioned 
that it can be favourable to execute the algrithms really fast, but 
for the F2L (especially the first two CE pairs), that doesn't sound 
like a very good idea to me, because I usually get better times if I 
go a little slower during F2L.

I started learning the F2L algorithms on Jessica Fridrich's page, 
but I think speedcubing.com or cubestation.co.uk would not be a very 
bad choice. On Dan's website, look at the applets to see what's 
happening to the pieces. Learning the F2L alg's without 
understanding them won't do you much good.

Oh yeah, I don't really know you need to learn extra algoritms to 
get to 25-30 seconds. I know a speedcuber who uses your method, and 
averages in the lower 20's. All it takes is a good cube and lot's of 
practice ;). (But should also mention that the cuber I am talking 
about has a lot of cubing experience).

Good luck,

Joel.

&gt; &gt; version in the Files section of this group the latest version? I 
&gt; &gt; vaguely remember something about there being a standalone version 
&gt; &gt; and a connected version? Is this correct? I'm actually after a 
&gt; &gt; standalone version.
&gt; 
&gt; You can download the latest version of JNetCube here:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.plu.edu/~huntca/jnetcube.html
&gt; 
&gt; The link to the latest Java Runtime Environment is on that page too,
&gt; so you can grab that if you need it.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are running Windows, then you can execute JNetCube by just
&gt; double-clicking the JNetCube.jar (after you have installed the latest
&gt; JRE).

    I have added a set of algs to the files section to go along with this
description.  I made the document on Open Office.  Hopefully it works
ok if opened with MS Word, or whatever you happen to use.  The file is
called WinterVariation.

The algs come into play after you have completed step 3 in Lars
Petrus's method (twisting the edges).  http://www.lar5.com/cube/index.html

So at this point, you have a 2x2x3 block, and all the remaining edges
are properly oriented.  

Next, solve the RD edge along with the RDB+RB corner-edge pair, using
R and U moves only, as per the Petrus Method.  

Pair up the RDF+RF corner edge pair in the U layer, but DO NOT SOLVE.
 Park it in the LUF+FU position. Again, U and R moves only. 

Look for U facelets (i.e., U color) on the RFD, RFU, RBU corners.  You
don't have to peek at the D facelet of RFD or the B facelet of RBU. 
Find the corresponding pattern in the Alg list and do that alg. 1 of
27 algs, average of 8.6 moves. 

If you have done this correctly, You will have solved the RFD corner
edge pair, as well as Orientating the Last Layer, leaving only PLL to
complete.

I don't know how well this variation performs, as I solve using a
Corners First method, so I don't know any PLL algs.  A few of the
cases are marked with a *, which means that there might be a shorter
alg out there for that case.  

Hopefully, this will be of some use to someone, or at the very least,
of mild interest.

    Hello,

For the F2L algs, I would recomend trying to figure most of them out
on your own.  Try to figure out most of the cases, and understand what
is happening.  For ones you can't figure out, find an alg online, but
don't just choose the first one you see.  Try a couple different ones
to find the one that works the best with your hands.  And of course,
when you learn a F2L alg, make sure you understand how it works, and
then you can apply those tactics to other positions as well.  After
figuring out the F2L, then you can go back and learn algs to replace
ones that you find are awkward, or too slow.  F2L, in my opinion, is
the hardest step of the Fridrich system.  So be patient, learn the
algs well, and just keep practicing.

Until next time, Happy Cubing

&gt; Hey there,
&gt; 
&gt; Nathan Christies algorithms look nice, but they are definitely not 
&gt; superiour to other F2L algorithms. In fact, I think the algorithms 
&gt; are really the same, but his notations shows that a lot of algoritms 
&gt; are 'macros' of 'triggers' or elementary moves. You also mentioned 
&gt; that it can be favourable to execute the algrithms really fast, but 
&gt; for the F2L (especially the first two CE pairs), that doesn't sound 
&gt; like a very good idea to me, because I usually get better times if I 
&gt; go a little slower during F2L.
&gt; 
&gt; I started learning the F2L algorithms on Jessica Fridrich's page, 
&gt; but I think speedcubing.com or cubestation.co.uk would not be a very 
&gt; bad choice. On Dan's website, look at the applets to see what's 
&gt; happening to the pieces. Learning the F2L alg's without 
&gt; understanding them won't do you much good.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh yeah, I don't really know you need to learn extra algoritms to 
&gt; get to 25-30 seconds. I know a speedcuber who uses your method, and 
&gt; averages in the lower 20's. All it takes is a good cube and lot's of 
&gt; practice ;). (But should also mention that the cuber I am talking 
&gt; about has a lot of cubing experience).
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,
&gt; 
&gt; Joel.

&gt; &gt; Hey all. Just like to mention how thrilled I am that I found a 
&gt; &gt; speedcubing community out there. Hopefully I can get good enough 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; at least compete in a tournament one day. It would be fun.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is currently the method I am using:
&gt; &gt; 1. Cross
&gt; &gt; 2. 3 Corners
&gt; &gt; 3. 3 Edges
&gt; &gt; 4. Final Corner
&gt; &gt; 5. Final Edge
&gt; &gt; 6. Orient Edges
&gt; &gt; 7. Orient Corners
&gt; &gt; 8. Permute All
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have pretty much plateaued at about 40-41 seconds for an average 
&gt; &gt; solve time. I now want to start learning solving the F2L in corner-
&gt; &gt; edge pairs.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My question is what algorithms do the quickest speed cubers learn?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was look at some of the algorithms out there for solving the 
&gt; F2L, 
&gt; &gt; like the ones at speedcubing.com. Then I ran across Nathan 
&gt; Christie's 
&gt; &gt; Optimized F2L algorithms in which each case is solved by a series 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; triggers. This method seems much superior to me. Not only are you 
&gt; &gt; able to execute the triggers very quickly, but they also seem 
&gt; easier 
&gt; &gt; to memorize. Most cases are solved with one of five triggers on 
&gt; &gt; either the R or F sides with a couple of U turns thrown in.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any opinions either way?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks.

Hi Lucas,

When I was using Petrus + orient corners + PLL, I considered orienting
the corners this way, but it was too many sequences for too little
improvement (and you have to learn symetrical sequences when finishing
with RDB+RB).

(Solve RDF+RF) + (orient corners) = ?1 + 7.7 moves (including many
suprafast Sunes).
(Position RDF+RF at LUF+FU) + (insert + orient corners) = ?2 + 8.6 moves.

?1 &lt;= ?2 + (RU'R'). I would be surprised if we can save more than 2 moves.

Anyway, thanks for the document, even if Word can't read it :-)

Working with corners in different layers is *very* interesting, even
if not always useful in speedcubing, because there so many powerful
corner sequences based on a very simple move like RU'R'U that changes
4 corners (and swaps 3 edges). Such a macromove is a cornerstone of
corner management:

(RU2R')  RU'R'U (RU2R')' --&gt; RUR'URU2R' (Sune)
(RU2R') R'FRF' (RU2R')' --&gt; RU2R2FRF'RU2R (another well known one)
...and so many other more or less obvious combinations that can
explain obscure CLL given by ACube...

Gilles.

    I guess that, to average in the low 20s, the cubist Joel knows must 
be doing F2L in about 15sec (or even less?) using the working corner 
method. This seems remarkable. It would be interesting to know how 
fast other users of this method are, on the F2L stage. There must be 
a few, or others who have tried it as a variation. 

After a few hours' practice, I find that the F2L alone averages in 
the high 20s for me.  Pretty awful (the cross is not the problem, 
btw), but will persevere with this for a while...

    Thanks to everyone's replies.

I agree with taking time to understand how the F2L algorithms work. 
My learning process, since first learning to solve the cube on my 
own, until the stage I'm at now, has been pretty organic. I find the 
more intuitive it is, the more I'm likely to go quicker.

Averaging in the low 20's using the working corner method for the F2L 
is impressive if true. I doubt very much I will ever be able to do 
that. If you count every little twist while doing this, it comes out 
to 4 twists a second. It takes me on average 85ish twists to solve 
the cube.

Um... your last 3 steps should average around 26-27 total using 
optimal sequences (please correct me if I'm wrong -- maybe you count 
a half-turn as 2 "twists" instead?).  So F2L with working corner is 
taking 58-59 turns on average.  Seems high :s

I'll try counting the turns this evening...

Just one tiny comment...

When will people finally realize that numbers are just as abstract as

    I agree with Stefan on this particular point, though I haven't heard
the interview yet (downloading as I type).

I try to memorize in such a way that during the solving phase I have
as few "conversions" as possible.  What I mean by a conversion is say
having to convert the numbers 3 4 5 into the cycle UR-&gt;UF-&gt;DB etc..

I just try to memorize the cycle UR-&gt;UF-&gt;DB since that is direct
memorization, whereas memorizing as a cycle (345) means I have to
later convert those numbers into an actual cycle on the cube.

Personally it helped my success rate and times both to memorize such
that there are as few conversions as possible during the solving
phase.

Again that is just my two cents,

    Last spring, I had the chance to do some (more or less) public 
cubing.  A company that exhibits at the PLRB/LIRB Claims Conference 
(see http://www.claimsconf.org/ for more conference details) had 
promotional (picture) cubes made that they were handing out to those 
that visited their booth.  I was there as their "cube expert", and 
got paid to sit around solving my cube all day.  Dan Knights did this 
for them previously, when the conference was in his area.

If you are in the San Antonio, Texas area, and would be interested in 
participating in this years conferences (being held April 17-20), 
send me a private e-mail (preferably, since I don't tend to keep up 
with this group right now) so I can put you in touch with the person 
who organized it all for me last year.  When I did it, I was at the 
conference for two days, about 5-6 hours each day, and it paid pretty 
well :-)

Seems odd that only a few people in the group are getting these - if it was 
someone's contact list being used to send the mail to the speed cubing 
group as a whole wouldn't it go to everyone on the list?

Maybe it's someone who has you in their contacts but who is not on the list 
- remember e-mail viruses spoof both subject line and e-mail address.

This is happening on other groups I'm on and is causing a lot of trouble 
with people unsubbing because they think the group is infected when it isn't.

Anyway the advice is correct - delete without opening.  Set your e-mail 
client to read as text only and that will give added protection because 
scripts can't run in a text only environment.

Moderators please tell me if this posting is not OK, I'm new to the group 
but I'm something of an expert in virus security because I help out at an 
antivirus software forum elsewhere and have also taken a full course in 
computer security (in the autumn of last year) at one of the web schools.

Must get my cube out this weekend and play with it:) need to practise.

&gt; Um... your last 3 steps should average around 26-27 total using 
&gt; optimal sequences (please correct me if I'm wrong -- maybe you 
count 
&gt; a half-turn as 2 "twists" instead?).  So F2L with working corner is 
&gt; taking 58-59 turns on average.  Seems high :s
&gt; 
&gt; I'll try counting the turns this evening...
&gt; 
&gt; Mike

Tried counting turns for working corner F2L, but going slowly to 
avoid mistakes such as removing edges that have accidentally become 
correctly placed. There were a few lucky (?) cases and no awkward 
ones in this series: 40 38 31 36 28 44 28 25 43 39 29 34 28 34 38 22 
40 47 30 30, average 34.2

Also, corner placements were chosen to keep middle layer edges out of 
the middle layer, or to remove incorrectly placed ones. So this is 
not representative of what I usually manage to do -- I'd guess that 
it normally takes about 45+ turns on average, which wouldn't make 
15sec unreasonable for F2L even so.  My slow time is probably just 
from pauses (slow recognition) and low turning speed.

It would be interesting to know what an expert could do.

    In my defense, converting into numbers helps memorizing EP _so much_ 
(no need to "tap" the pieces to make sure I haven't missed anything), 
at least for me. Converting numbers back is not a problem for me 
since I can normally do this for the next cycle while performing 
one...kind of like "looking ahead" for blindfold.

The only times that I don't use numbers is when the cycles are very 
symmetrical and easy to remember. Even then, I find that it's faster 
to memorize the first or the last few using numbers.

...and when I say numbers, I mean Japanese! =)

&gt; &gt; I just try to memorize the cycle UR-&gt;UF-&gt;DB since that is direct
&gt; &gt; memorization, whereas memorizing as a cycle (345) means I have to
&gt; &gt; later convert those numbers into an actual cycle on the cube.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Personally it helped my success rate and times both to memorize 
such
&gt; &gt; that there are as few conversions as possible during the solving
&gt; &gt; phase.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Again that is just my two cents,

    For what it's worth I have no problem at all 'converting' the 
numbers into pieces.

Actually I use a four-part memorization system:
- Corner Orientation visually, 
- edge orientation either visually or numerically
- corner permutation I memorize by numbers and 
- edge perumtation I memorize by letters.

I start memorizing with corner perm because it is the fastest way 
(for me) to establish the parity question.  If supersolving blind 
then I start with center orientation for the same reason.

I use a tweaked form of the Major system (which Lucas directed me to 
a while back on this forum - thanks).

1 - d
2 - n
3 - m
4 - r

5 - l
6 - sh
7 - k
8 - f

9 - p
(10 - g)
(11 - t)
(12 - w-z)

The last three are in brackets because they are my own code.  With 
just a little practise I got used to "reading" the UF piece 
(white/blue for me) as "d".  There is thus no need for me 
to 'convert' from d to UF / White/Blue because for me it is a simple 
identification - 'd' and 'd' always goes into UF.  I memorize the 
edges by cycles and always as pairs since I solve exclusively by 
three cycles - thus memorizing in pairs gives me all the info I need 
for any one element of my solution.

Hope this makes a little sense - I am in a hurry so I am just typing 
off the top of my head.

My main point is that I memorize by numbers AND letters, but have no 
problems at all with conversions (because I don't convert - I 
identify).  It also helps prevent cross-contamination of memorizaion 
between corner cycles and edge cycles.  Also, to look beyond the 
3x3x3, memorization by letters - and then converting letters into 
strange stories is very helpful for remembering the info for bigger 
cubes.

There is no one way of memorizing.  Figure out what works best for 
you.

    I can actually do this in an average of 1 minute and 30 seconds now.  
I will be making a website soon with my method. Stay tuned; 
memorization is not bad at all!

But for that method, I found that memorizing shapes was much easier 
than doing numbers.  Or, if you're a number person, find some sort of 
pattern that you can remember.  For example, if I see the 
string "486" I will think of a computer (a 486) or like a "236" I

    My fastest time with this method is 23 seconds. If I had to guess what my 
average was, I would guess 28 to 30 seconds. I'm sure I would be faster if I 
practiced it all the time, but I use the Fridrich method in practice.

    hmmm

nice site man :) i love the java applet.

one thing though, maybe the orient last layer might be
a little difficult for newbies :\

for oll cross, its reasonably easy, but then to orient
the corners seems "dodgy". you could teach how to
orient the last layer corners using only a sune.

and as for last layer pll, only three cycle edge or
three cycle corner will do. after all you can keep
cycleing corners and edges till you get it right :)

later,

    Hi John,

Thanks for taking a look at it, and for your comments.

I agree that the methods I present on my page are not really 
straightforward, and kinda tricky for beginners, but I did that on 
purpose. Like I said, there are a lot of websites that just give 
algorithms that can easiliy be memorized. But the moves on my page 
are more a 'system' rather than just algorithms. They really require 
the reader to actively think about what's happening... In one way, 
that is a disadvantage, because a newbie may be looking for 
something easy. But there a lots of websites that just give 
algorithms, so making another one is not really original. I did not 
see that many websites that really explain to a beginner what the 
moves are really doing to the pieces, so that's why I made this 
page. I am planning to make another section with some more efficient 
algorithms for the last layer, though :). And maybe something about 
working corners. But that would take me some time.

Happy cubing, 

Joel.

    &gt; WHAT? I just had a session of about 2:10 average with a very low 
&gt; success rate a few days ago. My fastest single is only 1:40. ^^; 
&gt; What's your success rate at this speed?

It's pretty consistent I think... it's no different from speedcubing 
in terms of time thresholds, like sometimes you get an "easy" case 
which might be a few seconds less, and sometimes you get a "hard" 
case which may take anywhere from 10 to even 40 seconds longer.

I don't have a place to upload it but I have a video of me AAAing 
Quasar on keyboard at a really high speed and another one of Paranoia 
Survivor Max Oni 1.5x rate 2x speed AAA score.

    On my site ( http://www.deepcube.tk ) I have a beginner solution as
well (although it doesn't look nearly as nice as yours).  The method
for orienting the last layer though I feel is well explained and easy
for new commers. Although I only know of one person who has learned
from my website, I have personaly taught somewhere in the range of 100
people, and the method is a mixture of a beginner method that Tyson
was teaching people, and a few changes here and there that I feel make
it easier to learn.  Feel free to use any ideas or parts of the
solution that you feel would help with yours.

Hope it helps

    A very nice site! I like the idea of explaining what moves do and how 
they work, good job on that.

I¬¥m sure this will sound very negative but I firmly belive that 
constructive critcism is far better than just saying everything is 
good.

First of all I think you should devide the beginners solution in 
smaller parts (on sub-section / step). This would make it faster to 
load and might make it easier to follow, also give the solution more 
structure.

You do have a good explanation about your move notation but I couldn¬¥t 
find an explanation to the positioning notation (UF,ULF etc.)

Well I think those were the major things I noticed, then there were a 
few smaller things. First you have a typo in the last line of step 6 " 
you should study the moves fist:" I¬¥m sure you mean first ;)

In the video section I would like some kind of highlighting on the 
download-button. Also the videos didn¬¥t work on my computer (I got 
sound but no picture) but that could be just me.

In the links section maybe you¬¥d like to add Lars Petrus site as you 
make a reference to it in your solution.


But all in all one of the better sites for beginners I¬¥ve come across!

    Hi Mikael,

Thanks for your response. It doesn't really sound negative, in fact, 
I agree with you on most things. I am not really sure about how to 
devide it in parts. But I can imagine that the solution looks more 
friendly to beginners if I do it in parts, so I'll work on that.

I only mention the UL ULF etc. notations very briefly, so maybe I 
could explain them more clearly, you're probably right on that too.

If you see any more typo's, I want to hear about them.

The links section can be expanded, but I am not planning to collect 
all speedcubing links there, I don't want that section to grow 
large. But indeed, a link to Lars Petrus' site would fit in 
perfectly.

Really, constructive criticism is welcome. (although I must admit, 
it feels a bit bad to find out I did something 'wrong', I do believe 
that this type of criticism is usefull, as it can really improve my 
site :)).

Bye,

Joel.

    Hi Joel,

I like it very much, it's close to the method I've been thinking of 
that I think could be taught to non-cubers in an hour or so.

For edge permutation, you could add that not only you can use corners 
as reference (you already say that), but you can see the color of the 
edge to solve next on the FD sticker. Also, I've thought about turning 
the top *two* layers between the basic moves instead of just the U 
layer, i.e. not the goal place comes above the piece, but the piece 
comes below the goal place. Well, even though I like it as well, it 
doesn't work for corners and thus it's not very good...

Cheers!
Stefan

    About the movies, they require Xvid. I added a link to a place where 
you can download that codec.

However, you can also try a different player. On my fathers

Marcus, I would assume that you use something close to Richard Carr's 
not-even intermediate method (but maybe reduced number of algs by 
using setup moves), but with very optimized algorithms. Is this 
correct? I just counted 125 moves using only 3-cycles on a solve with 
a fairly easy corner orientation. If you can do 3/sec, that's 41 sec 
for resolution. 35 is probably close to the lower limit for any 
memorization technique with consistant accuracy, so that gives me  
1:16 total on average as the lower limit with the algorithms I know. 
Except, I can never quite memorize in 35 sec.... 
Would you also mind telling us what speedcubing method you are using?

Thanks, that's helpful -- probably low 20s for F2L alone... will keep 
trying. For many years I used a free-for-all "system": no cross, just 
place anything that looked easy; then finish off remaining edges and 
any convenient mismatched CE pairs. It wasn't fast, of course :)

    Hi Per,
yeah it took me a while to figure too... it's not a very well-known game in Europe, at least it's not in France. DDR is short for Dance Dance Revolution, a stupid flash game (well I figure there are other versions of it, but I only tried the flash one) where you have to tap the arrows of your keyboard following the rythm of a song, and the computer tells you which arrow you have to tap. There are different songs, different difficulties, sometimes it gets really hard. I bet someone here will know a URL, so you get the idea.
Fran√ßois
PS. I really suck at that game...

Not Anymore! After reading this guide:
√ò You WILL be able to solve the cube, GUARANTEED!
 
Yes, one thing that I didn't say was the ENORMOUS REACTIONS RECEIVED 
WITH EVERY SOLVE!!!
Yes, in fact, it is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to not notice

They WILL see you solve it.
They WILL get a shock of their life.

    Joel, you missed the funniest part, which is even highlighted:

"less than 1% of the people who have ever owned a Rubik's Cube have 
never been able to solve it!"

That means almost everyone did solve it, right? I don't like people 
who don't understand negation ;-)

And why does he not simply show a picture instead of just writing "And

Why do I get the feeling that he will still use the algs R2 D' R' L F2
R L' U2 D R2 and R2 D2 B2 D L2 F2 L2 F2 L2 F2 D' B2 D2 R2 in the

I never expected to read anything like that about the cube.

    The sad thing is that people who just got a cube might even fall for 
this, because he's unfortunately right in saying that the solution 
that comes in the booklet with the cube is indeed awful (at least I 
think in mine even the single turning symbols were unreadable thanks 
to a bad font or maybe textual symbols where images were intended to 
be?)...

&gt; &gt; "less than 1% of the people who have ever owned a Rubik's Cube 
have 
&gt; &gt; never been able to solve it!"
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That means almost everyone did solve it, right? I don't like 
people 
&gt; &gt; who don't understand negation ;-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And why does he not simply show a picture instead of just writing 
"And 
&gt; &gt; just in case you didn't know what a Rubik's Cube is, it's the six 
&gt; &gt; sided cube [blah]" ???
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers!

I'd instead suggest to *remove* that solution.

    In the defense of the solution that comes in the booklet, it is not 
overly terrible.  It is inefficient, but it requires very little

    Does anyone have an original 1982 revenge?

I got what i thought was one on ebay, but on close
inspection the white sticker with the name and the
blue sticker that says I.T.C 1982 made in hong kong
are placed over blank stickers of the same color.  I
think i have been frauded.  It did look in abnormally
good condition, and was cheap.  

If anyone has a revenge they know is from 1982, could
you look and see if the stickers with text are placed
over others?  i suppose its possible thats just how
they were made.  

thanks

Andrew

    Hey Andrew,
I'm not totally sure about that, cuz I don't have one myself, but I used to borrow one from a friend, and noticed the same thing. So I figure that's just the way they were done, at least the Hong Kong ones. You may want a Hungarian one, because they're known to be a lot better, although I never owned one either, so... Well. The Rubiksdotcom ones are also ok.

Quite apart from anything else I don't know if you realise that that web 
site is a copy of some of the stuff people put up to get you to buy e-books 
software - and those web sites are usually complete cons.  You know the 
sort of thing - "you too can make ¬£40,000 a year if you buy this software 
to make e-books and use viral marketing to sell them" type of stuff.  In 
fact I'm sure I've seen that particular page up somewhere but worded and 
styled just like that (apart from the badly coded background image) to sell 
the e-book software.

    No, definitely not. 

Original Ideal Toy Rubik's Revenge had an
extra blue sticker and an extra white sticker with
printing on it. 

You can also tell by the thickness of the vinyl.
Original Revenge had thicker vinyl than the more
modern version.

    Hey!

Unless u are some sort of collector does it matter if it's an 
original 1982 Revenge cube as long as the cube is reasonably good. 
In fact i find that newer 4x4x4 cubes are better than the old 1982. 
The center cubies are stronger on recent ones. And also can be more 
easily repaired/glued. For most speedcubers anyway it matters most 
what color-arrangement the stickers are. Most prefer the "BOY" color 
scheme. Blue opposite green, orange opposite red and yellow opposite 
white. And with blue, orange, yellow in clockwise order around a

One way to be sure to get a real 1982 Revenge cube is to order one 
from Ton Dennenbroek (www.speedcubing.com/ton). Hmm ... it seems he 
no longer sells them. But u can contact him anyway :-)

&gt; Original Ideal Toy Rubik's Revenge had an
&gt; extra blue sticker and an extra white sticker with
&gt; printing on it. 
&gt; 
&gt; You can also tell by the thickness of the vinyl.
&gt; Original Revenge had thicker vinyl than the more
&gt; modern version.

&gt; &gt; I got what i thought was one on ebay, but on close
&gt; &gt; inspection the white sticker with the name and the
&gt; &gt; blue sticker that says I.T.C 1982 made in hong kong
&gt; &gt; are placed over blank stickers of the same color.  I
&gt; &gt; think i have been frauded.  It did look in abnormally
&gt; &gt; good condition, and was cheap.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If anyone has a revenge they know is from 1982, could
&gt; &gt; you look and see if the stickers with text are placed
&gt; &gt; over others?  i suppose its possible thats just how
&gt; &gt; they were made.
&gt; &gt;

You should be able to get them on German Ebay from the inventor 
himself for about 25 Euros:
http://search.ebay.de/_W0QQsassZveroccio

A while back a friend of mine and I bought two and since we live close 
to him, we even got to meet him, which was quite nice, we talked for a 
while in a cafe. You'll also get a copy of an old document (see the 
pics) which says his name (Peter Sebesteny) as inventor. And a sticker 
with a greeting and signed by him, which you can put on the box or 
whatever if you want to.

Cheers!
Stefan

    Hi All, is there anyone here who is at or near sub-20 using a corners 
method.  I can get to about 23-24 sec using an accelerated corner 
starter but I have to do the slice moves at blinding speed while I 
can get the same result with F2L going much slower.  I've seen a 
David Allen video made during the Toronto WC and can't imagine how 
anyone could get a sub-17 time using a corner method like he did.

Yeah, the housevalues ad has been running for a few weeks. I saw it a

&gt; Hi All, is there anyone here who is at or near sub-20 using a 
corners 
&gt; method.  I can get to about 23-24 sec using an accelerated corner 
&gt; starter but I have to do the slice moves at blinding speed while I 
&gt; can get the same result with F2L going much slower.  I've seen a 
&gt; David Allen video made during the Toronto WC and can't imagine how 
&gt; anyone could get a sub-17 time using a corner method like he did.
&gt; 
&gt; Wayne

Well, I don't exactly know the details of the method he (David 
Allen) uses. But I heard that he can make pretty cool slice moves, 
yes. But there are other cubers who use corners first methods, and 
get sub-20 times. Marc Waterman used his corners first method to 
average around 16 seconds. And Gilles also averages around 16 
seconds, although I am not sure if that is really a CF method...

    Hey all,

    Is the BOY scheme the most popular? I have purchased a "Rubik's Cube" (has logo as shown below) and a "Rubik's Revenge" (also has logo below). 

I have read on this web page: 
http://www.foxtechcomputers.com/me/rubiks/cubebuyingguide.html 
that the 'white-yellow' and 'green-blue' scheme, in his opinion, constitutes about 70% of cubes. Although the 'white-blue' and 'green-yellow' constitutes only about 25% of the cubes. Why does my Rubik's Cube with the official www.rubik.com have the latter scheme (WB &amp; GY), although my Rubik's Revenge has the BOY scheme?



The following cube simulator has the latter scheme as its default http://www.puzzlingaddiction.com/Cube/applet/. 

Although it seems that most speedcubers websites have the BOY scheme.


Thanks for feedback on the weird cubing habit.
Dwayne

    Chris,

It's Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene or ABS plastic. If you google for it
you will find that the first electronic calculators had molded ABS 
housings. I've heard that some of the transparent spindles made  from 
polycarbonate. 

ABS cubes parts are very tough. Early modders tried polyester resin, which is 
far more brittle, but it's very cheap. Next we tried polyurethane
resin, which works better. It's actually pretty strong when the
pieces are solid.

Polymer chemicals can be rather nasty to work with. Eye protection
and gloves and even a good breathing mask is recommended. 
Also good vents as the fumes will stink up the place. Not very
environmentality friendly. I can see why some puzzle makers prefer
working with wood.

    I'm waiting for someone to make Teflon cube. It seems like it would be 
the ideal material.

Don't let your frying pan fool you. Solid Teflon is hard and durable. 
It's a bit expensive for plastics, but material for a cube should just 
be around $2.

    Hey!

If $2 is needed for the teflon for one cube, then a teflon cube 
should in theory cost maximum $2 more than current ones. Except if 
the molding is that much harder. And maybe parts need to be glued? 
Is teflon hard to glue? I have no idea about that. And if the 
plastic is too tough will it be less ideal. What i mean is: will a 
teflon cube ever break-in in that case? Is teflon more toxic than 
ABS? Does silicone work as lubricant on teflon? Will silicone be 
needed at all on teflon? There are many things to consider. And yes, 
why not titan instead of teflon? Or use a metal like aluminium or 
magnesium or some other ceramic material ...

I have always dreamt of cubes with fused tiles. The tiles could be 
like on the impossiball so that u can rearrange the colors ;-)

Cheers!

    Hey guys/girls,
     I'm interested in purchasing a bunch of cubes (like 30 or so).  I was wondering if I could get a discount from rubiks.com or some other seller in the world?  I know a few people have done this before, so I was just if anyone knew.  You can email me personally or in the group.  Thanks

&gt; Hey!
&gt;
&gt; If $2 is needed for the teflon for one cube, then a teflon cube
&gt; should in theory cost maximum $2 more than current ones. Except if
&gt; the molding is that much harder. And maybe parts need to be glued?
&gt; Is teflon hard to glue? I have no idea about that. And if the
&gt; plastic is too tough will it be less ideal. What i mean is: will a
&gt; teflon cube ever break-in in that case? Is teflon more toxic than
&gt; ABS? Does silicone work as lubricant on teflon? Will silicone be
&gt; needed at all on teflon? There are many things to consider. And yes,
&gt; why not titan instead of teflon? Or use a metal like aluminium or
&gt; magnesium or some other ceramic material ...
&gt;
&gt; I have always dreamt of cubes with fused tiles. The tiles could be
&gt; like on the impossiball so that u can rearrange the colors ;-)

    Hi Dwayne,

   Inconsistancy has been part and parcel of cube making since it
began. At first, on the Polytechnica cubes, there was no "official
color scheme." They were all over the map, trying out different
colors. I like the purple they tried, and the original yellow. 

   When Ideal started making Rubik's Cubes, the color scheme was RBG,
that is, Red opposite Orange, Blue opposite White, and Green opposite
Yellow, with one corner Red Blue and Green clockwise (hence the RBG).

   Of the estimated two or three *hundred million* cubes Ideal made
beginning in 1980, most of the cubes were this RBG or Red Blue Green
color scheme. All of the Ideal 2x2x2 cubes, 4x4x4 cubes, Deluxe cubes,
Rubik's Game/Rubik's Challenge cubes, and all of the C*4 cubes were
made with RBG, *not* "BOY" color scheme. RBG is the scheme on the
cardboard tube which was used in Britain. At the time that the C*4
cube was introduced Erno Rubik announced that RBG was the official
color scheme. 

  Sometimes Ideal had quality control problems, so some of their cubes
switched Red and Orange. Ideal cubes made with other schemes were in
the minority, like "BYO" and "BOY" schemes, and Orange next to Red (a
beautiful cube, see:
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2011%20Ideal%20US%20red%20next%20to%20organe%201980.htm)
 

   Seven Towns bought the rights from Ideal, and they make the Hasbro,
Winning Moves, Rubiks.com and Oddzon cubes. Something like three years
ago Seven Towns changed the "Official" Colors from the RBG scheme to
the BOY scheme. Why they did this I don't know. I asked, but got no
answer.

   I believe that fewer than 10 million cubes have been made since the
change over. I think that some cubes made before that by Seven Towns
had other color schemes, like the 3x3x3 which you have.
  
Regards,

David J

    usually the cubes from rubiksdotcom are BOY. recently, though, I
purchased a cube from there and it was RGB. I don't know why they made
it like that, and it totally screwed with my mind for a while until I
restickered it.

heeeey, I gotta good idea.... Rubiksdotcom should have an option for
what color scheme you want!! there should be an option for BOY, RGB,
and if you pay a bit extra they'll make it custom.... man, I'm a genius.

    Hey Jeremy,

You live near Sacramento?  Yeah, I'm curious.  You should go there, ask 
them to teach you, and then not be able to learn it.  You'd want to 
practice sucking though.  It's kind of hard to act confused when you

This is a discussion we had on cube-lovers years ago. The "differing by
Yellow" scheme was dominant in Europe and in North America &amp; UK it
was RGB as you call it. Differing by Yellow (BOY) had a certain logic to it
but RGB cubes had better contrast. And of course there is Bela's LGI cubes
which on the one I have is:

Top = Black
Down = Yellow
Front = Green
Back = Blue
Left = Red
Right = Orange

So I guess this is a BRY cube.

Maybe because the original Hungarian cubes had the BOY scheme. 
It's not that big of a difference, just Blue and Yellow have been
transposed. I don't see any reason for just one colour scheme. 

Which reminds me, were the Rubik's Deluxe cube ever officially approved
for cube tournaments?

&gt;
&gt;    I believe that fewer than 10 million cubes have been made since the

    Hey!

I think any cube which is not eastsheen and does not resemble an 
eastsheen cube would be approved by a SevenTowns sponsored event ;-)

These cubes seem to be a torn in their eyes, mostly out of political 
reasons. The eastsheens are still sold (legally?). So it's mostly 
just to demonstrate their power that they ban eastsheen cubes from 
competitions.

And back to ur question. I know that Ron has used the Deluxe Cube in 
competitions. Or at least the very similar Game Cube. This probably 
means that they had accepted it i guess ...

Happy cubing! (whichever cube :-P )

&gt; So it's mostly

That sounds like they're just mean. They do make business and they do 
have rights, so I think it's understandable if they don't want clones 
at their competitions (I'd like to have Megaminx&amp;Co there, though, 
which are not clones, at Euro2004 it was only Rubik stuff). I recently 
saw a tv interview (cause rubik patented his cube 30 years ago) with a 
guy who once worked with rubik and he had lots of eastsheen cubes in 
front of him which I think is not very nice...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;    When Ideal started making Rubik's Cubes, the color scheme was RBG,
&gt; &gt; that is, Red opposite Orange, Blue opposite White, and Green opposite
&gt; &gt; Yellow, with one corner Red Blue and Green clockwise (hence the RBG).
&gt; 
&gt; I like the short form of RGB, that's a term I can remember.

   Yeah, I sometimes write RGB when I mean RBG. :)
 
&gt; &gt;    Of the estimated two or three *hundred million* cubes Ideal made
&gt; &gt; beginning in 1980, most of the cubes were this RBG or Red Blue Green
&gt; &gt; color scheme. All of the Ideal 2x2x2 cubes, 4x4x4 cubes, Deluxe cubes,
&gt; &gt; Rubik's Game/Rubik's Challenge cubes, and all of the C*4 cubes were
&gt; &gt; made with RBG, *not* "BOY" color scheme. RBG is the scheme on the
&gt; &gt; cardboard tube which was used in Britain. At the time that the C*4
&gt; &gt; cube was introduced Erno Rubik announced that RBG was the official
&gt; &gt; color scheme.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a discussion we had on cube-lovers years ago. The "differing by
&gt; Yellow" scheme was dominant in Europe and in North America &amp; UK it
&gt; was RGB as you call it. 

   Yes the "BOY" scheme tended to turn up in Europe, but I'm not at
all sure it was dominant. I have seen several "Made in Hungary" cubes
which are not "BOY." RBG was also the dominant scheme in Japan. 

&gt; Differing by Yellow (BOY) had a certain logic to it

   Yes it does. And both schemes have the primary colors on one
corner. COunterclockwise on BOY and clockwise on RBG.

&gt; but RGB cubes had better contrast. 

&gt; And of course there is Bela's LGI cubes
&gt; which on the one I have is:
&gt; 
&gt; Top = Black
&gt; Down = Yellow
&gt; Front = Green
&gt; Back = Blue
&gt; Left = Red
&gt; Right = Orange
&gt; 
&gt; So I guess this is a BRY cube.

   You could call it that but there is a BRY Corner on the RBG cubes,
since Orange, Red, Blue and Yellow are in the same place on both
cubes. How about BBO for the Black Blue and Orange (clockwise) corner?
  
&gt; &gt;   Sometimes Ideal had quality control problems, so some of their cubes
&gt; &gt; switched Red and Orange. Ideal cubes made with other schemes were in
&gt; &gt; the minority, like "BYO" and "BOY" schemes, and Orange next to Red (a
&gt; &gt; beautiful cube, see:
&gt; &gt;
http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2011%20Ideal%20US%20red%20ne
&gt; &gt;xt%20to%20organe%201980.htm)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    Seven Towns bought the rights from Ideal, and they make the Hasbro,
&gt; &gt; Winning Moves, Rubiks.com and Oddzon cubes. Something like three years
&gt; &gt; ago Seven Towns changed the "Official" Colors from the RBG scheme to
&gt; &gt; the BOY scheme. Why they did this I don't know. I asked, but got no
&gt; &gt; answer.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe because the original Hungarian cubes had the BOY scheme.

   But they didn't. I have one of the original cubes from Hungary
(circa 1977-1978) with the square cut stickers and it is BRY, not BOY.
 
&gt; It's not that big of a difference, just Blue and Yellow have been
&gt; transposed. I don't see any reason for just one colour scheme. 
&gt; 
&gt; Which reminds me, were the Rubik's Deluxe cube ever officially approved
&gt; for cube tournaments?

   Yes. Any cube which was liscensed to Rubik has been allowed so far.
Technically that should include Bela's cubes. Speaking of white
plastic cubes...too bad that Seven Towns has no interest in producing
the white plastic cubes with arches and screws. That plastic is nearly
as slick as teflon-impregnated plastic. I'd love to see the beauties
which you sell in tournaments. Hmmm, I may bring mine to the next one
at Caltech.

Regards,

David J
 

&gt; &gt;    I believe that fewer than 10 million cubes have been made since the
&gt; &gt; change over. I think that some cubes made before that by Seven Towns
&gt; &gt; had other color schemes, like the 3x3x3 which you have.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey all,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;     Is the BOY scheme the most popular? I have purchased a "Rubik's

&gt; &gt; Cube" (has logo as shown below) and a "Rubik's Revenge" (also has logo
&gt; &gt; below).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have read on this web page:
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.foxtechcomputers.com/me/rubiks/cubebuyingguide.html
&gt; &gt; &gt; that the 'white-yellow' and 'green-blue' scheme, in his opinion,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; constitutes about 70% of cubes. Although the 'white-blue' and
&gt; &gt; 'green-yellow' constitutes only about 25% of the cubes. Why does my
&gt; &gt; Rubik's Cube with the official www.rubik.com have the latter scheme
&gt; &gt; (WB &amp; GY), although my Rubik's Revenge has the BOY scheme?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The following cube simulator has the latter scheme as its default
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://www.puzzlingaddiction.com/Cube/applet/.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Although it seems that most speedcubers websites have the BOY
scheme.

    Hi all, 

I thought maybe we could start posting some cube 
jokes. So here's one I wrote. It was inspired by
Stefan Sch√∂nw√§lder in the German speedcuber group. 

------------------------------------------------
Cube Joke: 


Two women have a chat.

"What kind of man do you prefer?
A mathematician or a speedcuber?"

"A speedcuber of course."

"Why?"

"Well, he'd know all these moves,
the RUR'...how do they call it...
fingertricks?"

"ooooh"

Then a third woman, who has listened
to their conversation says:

"You know what, my boyfriend rather
solves the cube slowly and even blindfolded."

"Ooooooh" the two other women say.

A fourth woman, who has also listened
says:

"Hah, that's nothing. My boyfriend
solves the cube slowly, blindfolded
and with his TONGUE!"

"(o_O)"

    It seems that I'm stuck and am not sure how to best speed up my 
times. I'm averaging about 75 seconds to solve the cube using Lars 
Petus method (slightly modified):
 25 seconds for 2x2x2
 25 seconds to finish off F2L
 25 seconds for LL

Maybe just writing this will help, but I've been at the same times 
for about a month.

I think there are three main reasons for my times.
 1. Inability to look ahead. Even during a 15 second head start I'm 
only able to "see" the placement of two cubicles.

 2. Cube over turning or locking. Maybe I'm trying too hard, but I 
routinely performing a D2 instead of a D or trying to execute a R 
followed by a D and having cubicals bump into each other. I have 
several cubes. One of the store bought ones turns a but stiff, which 
makes tuning a bit harder, but I rarely have lockups with it. The DIY 
cube I bought turns really nice, but locks up when I turn too fast. :(

 3. Having a hard time finding a particular cubical even when it's 
right in front of me. After doing a 2x2x2 I usually look for the GR 
cubical to see if I need to flip it. I sometimes wast 2-3 seconds 
just looking around the cube for it.

Maybe I just need more time practicing, though any assistance would 
be great.

    I spent the week in an hospital and had nothing to do but cubing!!!
It was quite odd. A drip tube stuck in my hand, breathing carbon

I was thinking, just imagine a competition with a competitor using
such an equipment. That would boost media coverage!

Yes, sub-16 with "lucky" averages (statistically speaking) but 18.5 on
bad days, and that's a huge difference :-(
I'd like to lower my averages *consistently* to sub-16, but I still
need more practice.

It's incredible when you look at Macky!
Hey Macky, are you going to hit sub-15 every time in championships?

Tell us what your worse average look like! (*)

    Hey!

Yes they would say nothing about westsheen, northsheen, southsheen 
if they don't look like eastsheen. Of that i'm 100% certain.

My point is that ppl should be allowed any kind of cube that is not 
made in any way made for cheating. Ppl have different preferences 
and should use the cube they are comfortable with. Olivier Gaucher 
might for instance have beaten Lars on the 5x5x5 if he was allowed 
to use his Eastsheen cube.

I seriously believe that any sponsor who will restrict the brands of 
cube used we shouldn't use for our competitions. In fact i was about 
to not come to Amsterdam cause of this issue. But having cubed since 
1981 and missing out the big opportunity of a championship was too 
sad so i changed my mind thanx to Ron.

We live in a free world (for the most part). Let noone decide what 
brands of cubes to use and not to use in competitions. That is my 
very simple message. Seventowns are not losing a single penny or 
cent by allowing eastsheens, so my opinion is that banning those is 
stupidity. And it's not disrespect of Ern√∂ Rubik either. Most ppl 
who are not cubists (whatever that is) still would call the 
Eastsheen a Rubik's cube. That shows how well associated the Rubik 
name is with cubic/twisting puzzles. And why not call the 4x4x4 
Sebesteny cube and the 5x5x5 Krell cube. That would be equally well 
deserved.

Cheers! (hmm Stefan did u copyright that greeting yet? ;-)  )

-Per

PS! I do indeed prefer Rubiks.com cubes personally but that is 
beside my point ...

    Anyone know the algs to orient all of the last layer and permute the
corners? I think there are 280 individual algs?? Then the last layer could
be finished off with an edge cycle, and you wouldn't have to learn ZB or VH
f2l algs. Recognition would be just like COLL, only then you'd have to see
which edges are flipped. I'm working on finding these and it'd be nice if
someone already had them, or what it would average. Thanks!

    Hi Per,

   One of the things that bothers me about the "no eastsheen 2x2x2"
rule is that the 2x2x2 was invented (and patented) by Larry Nichols
long before Rubik invented the 3x3x3.

&gt; if they don't look like eastsheen. Of that i'm 100% certain.
&gt; 
&gt; My point is that ppl should be allowed any kind of cube that is not 
&gt; made in any way made for cheating. Ppl have different preferences 
&gt; and should use the cube they are comfortable with. Olivier Gaucher 
&gt; might for instance have beaten Lars on the 5x5x5 if he was allowed 
&gt; to use his Eastsheen cube.
&gt; 
&gt; I seriously believe that any sponsor who will restrict the brands of 
&gt; cube used we shouldn't use for our competitions. In fact i was about 
&gt; to not come to Amsterdam cause of this issue. But having cubed since 
&gt; 1981 and missing out the big opportunity of a championship was too 
&gt; sad so i changed my mind thanx to Ron.
&gt; 
&gt; We live in a free world (for the most part). Let noone decide what 
&gt; brands of cubes to use and not to use in competitions. That is my 
&gt; very simple message. Seventowns are not losing a single penny or 
&gt; cent by allowing eastsheens, so my opinion is that banning those is 
&gt; stupidity. And it's not disrespect of Ern√∂ Rubik either. Most ppl 
&gt; who are not cubists (whatever that is) still would call the 
&gt; Eastsheen a Rubik's cube. That shows how well associated the Rubik 
&gt; name is with cubic/twisting puzzles. And why not call the 4x4x4 
&gt; Sebesteny cube and the 5x5x5 Krell cube. That would be equally well 
&gt; deserved.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers! (hmm Stefan did u copyright that greeting yet? ;-)  )

&gt; 
&gt; PS! I do indeed prefer Rubiks.com cubes personally but that is 
&gt; beside my point ...

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So you say I'd be allowed to use my westsheen cubes, right?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; So it's mostly

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That sounds like they're just mean. They do make business and they

&gt; &gt; which are not clones, at Euro2004 it was only Rubik stuff). I 
&gt; recently 
&gt; &gt; saw a tv interview (cause rubik patented his cube 30 years ago) 
&gt; with a 
&gt; &gt; guy who once worked with rubik and he had lots of eastsheen cubes

    I'm not saying your wrong. Nichols was the first to make a 
cubical 2x2x2, but Ideal Toy turned Nichols down.

If Larry Nichols had an effective mechanism instead of one
based on magnets I don't think Ideal Toy (itself an American company)
would have passed on it. To be fair I've no first hand information about his 
2x2x2 but I don't see how a magnet-based 2x2x2 could work except
by forcing it apart and then letting it pull itself back together.

I'm not personally against the idea of allowing eastsheen or other
types of cubes in tournaments. In bowling tournaments you're not
constrained to use a particular make of bowling ball. In tennis
tournaments I'm pretty sure the players don't use only one
manufacturer of tennis racket.

    This is a duplicate of my post to the midwestcubeclub group...  I 
thought there may be people that are part of one group or the other, 
but not both...

- G

I wrote the following in that group (URL's been modified for this 
group):

I don't know how many people will really find this useful, but Rommy 
saw me using a timer on my iPAQ and asked for it while we were at the 
competition.  I figured I'd just upload it to the files section on 
here.  It's pretty limited in it's functionality right now, and while 
I have many ideas for future improvements, I unfortunately haven't 
had time to change it since original development well over 6 months 
ago, so who knows when it'll happen.

It provides good scrambles for 2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, and 5x5x5 cubes.  
Click start, you get a 15 second countdown (no sound to indicate your 
start time, though) and then time starts.  Stop and accept/discard 
your time (or indicate a pop), and it will show you your times, most 
recent at the top, along with a running average of 12.  Additionally, 
you can elect to look at your best, worst or current average, or 
best/worst single time.

The file name is CubeTimes2Go.exe, and it can be found in the files 
section of this group, which is at 
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/files/ .

Hi James,

it should be 603 algs.

  3  swap corners

 66  swap+twist corners
 19  swap corners / flip edges
 47  twist corners / flip edges

    Hi James, 

&gt;Anyone know the algs to orient all of the last layer and permute the
&gt;corners? I think there are 280 individual algs?? Then the last layer 
could
&gt;be finished off with an edge cycle, and you wouldn't have to learn 
ZB or VH
&gt;f2l algs. 
I can't answer to your question "how many algs?" exactly. 
But this is something what I have been working. 

I already knew more than 100 but less than 140. 
To my experinece, it pays a little bit but not much. 
Of course, to expand the number of algs should help your skills. 

For example, if you see just one corner is oriented in LL and 
correctly placed, Sune or its variation is too easy to perform. 
If you want to orient four edges, it takes twice as much as Sune. 

If you are interested in, I can give you some optimized algs I use. 
The only problem is I am too lazy to descibe those algs in text. 
I wish I could have a set of small videos instead. 

&gt;Recognition would be just like COLL, only then you'd have to see
&gt;which edges are flipped. I'm working on finding these and it'd be 
nice if
&gt;someone already had them, or what it would average. Thanks!

&gt;-James
&gt;
&gt;http://www.stubers.org/jamesstuff/jamesstuff.htm


Macky, Lars, Ron, or someone who use COLL...
Could you give an idea to distingish CLL without edge-flipping and 
CLL with OLL?
The naming of COLL, which you use, sounds like OLL with corner 
permution, or CLL with OLL simultaneously, whatever.... 
Sometimes, it is confusing. 

I would suggest eoCLL (edge-oriented) or eCLL for CLL without edge-
flipping.

Hi!

Ton used to have pictures, but I cannot find them right now. 

With the original Czech version, Cube 21, it should be relatively 
easy to remove the plate with the logo on it. (At least, mine was 
fairly easy.) This reveals a screw which holds the 2 halves of the 
puzzle together.

Loosen the screw to help remove the pieces -- the screw may be very 
stiff.  Only remove the screw if the spring/washer are incorrectly 
placed (the washer should be between the spring and the plastic).  

Warning: If you remove the screw completely, you may have to remove 
the opposite face plate to get access to the little plastic block 
that the screw screws into.

Irwin Toys Square-1 (I have too many of these): Sometimes a lot of 
glue has been used and you cannot remove the face plates.  In this 
case I have had to drill a 6mm hole in the face plate to get access 
to the screw.  But you have to know exactly where the screwhead is 
under the face plate -- let me know if you need to do this...

Alternatively, partially twist the middle layer, then try to turn a 
face so that an edge pops out.  Warning: doing this may loosen the 
screw, so you end up drilling a hole anyway...

Mike

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; Ton used to have pictures, but I cannot find them right now. 
&gt; 
&gt; With the original Czech version, Cube 21, it should be relatively 
&gt; easy to remove the plate with the logo on it. (At least, mine was 
&gt; fairly easy.) This reveals a screw which holds the 2 halves of the 
&gt; puzzle together.
&gt; 
&gt; Loosen the screw to help remove the pieces -- the screw may be 
very 
&gt; stiff.  Only remove the screw if the spring/washer are incorrectly 
&gt; placed (the washer should be between the spring and the plastic).  
&gt; 
&gt; Warning: If you remove the screw completely, you may have to 
remove 
&gt; the opposite face plate to get access to the little plastic block 
&gt; that the screw screws into.
&gt; 
&gt; Irwin Toys Square-1 (I have too many of these): Sometimes a lot of 
&gt; glue has been used and you cannot remove the face plates.  In this 
&gt; case I have had to drill a 6mm hole in the face plate to get 
access 
&gt; to the screw.  But you have to know exactly where the screwhead is 
&gt; under the face plate -- let me know if you need to do this...
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, partially twist the middle layer, then try to turn 
a 
&gt; face so that an edge pops out.  Warning: doing this may loosen the 
&gt; screw, so you end up drilling a hole anyway...

    &gt; Macky, Lars, Ron, or someone who use COLL...
&gt; Could you give an idea to distingish CLL without edge-flipping and 
&gt; CLL with OLL?
&gt; The naming of COLL, which you use, sounds like OLL with corner 
&gt; permution, or CLL with OLL simultaneously, whatever.... 
&gt; Sometimes, it is confusing. 
&gt; 
&gt; I would suggest eoCLL (edge-oriented) or eCLL for CLL without edge-
&gt; flipping. 
&gt; 
&gt; Masayuki Akimoto

Yes, we definitely need better names. eCLL looks nice enough to me.

What I would rather see is a good system for naming, though. Even the 
acronyms in common use--OLL, PLL, CLL, and ELL--don't clearly show 
what they mean. We call OLL "orientation of last layer," but can 
permutation be disturbed (yes)? PLL is "permutation of last layer," 
but can orientation be disturbed (this time, no!)?

We could, for example, use capital letters to mean fixing that part 
with any side effects, then list the preserved portion in lowercase 
letters later. The problem with this is that you have to write PLLo 
to mean PLL.

...yeah, that's kind of stupid. I would rather use RH, ZBLL, whatever 
crazy acronyms we'll think of in the future, than precisely write out 
their effect every time.

Me neither.

&gt; In bowling tournaments you're not
&gt; constrained to use a particular make of bowling ball.

That might be because they're not organized/sponsored by the "Bowling" 
company, though.

&gt; In tennis
&gt; tournaments I'm pretty sure the players don't use only one
&gt; manufacturer of tennis racket.

That might be because they're not organized/sponsored by the "Tennis"

The best way to learn all the OLL and PLL is first learn a 3 look
LL. That means first you orient the last layer edges(make a cross on
the LL) then you orient the LL corners then you permute them all.
This is how first learned how, and after i learned all the algorithms
to do it this way, i just slowly started added more OLLs until i knew 
them all

    I really want to buy a 4x4x4 cube. After I bought a 2x2x2 Rubik's cube
from rubiks.com, I was really disappointed. It was really bad at
turning. Then I heard that "Eastsheen" 2x2x2s are a lot better, so I
went out on a search. (I also heard that their 4x4x4s are the best too).
Finally, I found the eastsheen website. It was hard for me to find for
2 reasons:
1) It is actually "East Sheen" NOT "Eastsheen"
2) The website has a typo in the header of the main frame making the
title "ESAT SHEEN" instead of "EAST SHEEN&gt;"

I found the site (link here: http://www.eastsheen.com.tw/ ) and
discovered that I want to buy their cubes. So, I sent them an e-mail
saying that:
1) I want to buy their cubes, and I wanted to know where I could get
them (or if I could get them straight from them).
2) To tell them about the typo

I got a response in about a DAY! Isn't that good customer service? 
It read:

"Dear Sir,

It is a pity that we don't accept retail due to we are manufactory of

So then I e-mailed Meffert's to ask which cubes they had are East
Sheeen cubes. I never got a reply.

So my question to you all is:
Which cubes on http://www.mefferts.com/ are in fact East Sheen cubes?


Thanks a ton, and I hope some of the information in this post helped.

    jason,
u go into merfferts's puzzles.  and the eastsheen 2x2x2, 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 will be like half way down the page i think.  it should say the 2x2x2 is 5x5x5cm, 4x4x4 is 6x6x6cm and for 5x5x5 is also 6x6x6cm.  those 3 are the eastsheens.  and i am not sure if they can be used in competitions, which is something i wanna know too.

    from what i gather, they can be used in competitions that are not 
officially sponsored by seven towns.  seven towns does not permit 
non-rubik's brand puzzles in competitions that they sponsor.  
however, if they are not sponsoring an event, then the east sheen

    Dear James,

You can also use a 4-step last layer.

1. Orient the edges.
2. Position/permute the corners.
3. Orient the corners.
4. Position/permute the edges.

Very technically, you only need to memorize 4 algorithms for this 4-step last layer.

  do i really need to memorize all the OLL and PLL
  algorithms????, i've just finished learning all the
  F2L, and my average time is 40 seconds, what should i
  do??? or what is a better way to learn all the OLL and
  PLL algorithms???

    Hi

I found another mistake
The second alg on your OLL1 page couldn't possible be correct, it messes up
the cube. I don't know which alg you actually meant to put there.

    I know there have been a lot of favorite PLL posts, but what about 
OLL? Just out of curiousity, do most of you prefer short OLL 
algorithms or ones that feel nice to perform? If so, which ones?

Personally, I like L'U2L2F'L'FL'U2L and LULF'L'FU'L' the best for 
the speed and the way they feel, although I don't mind getting some 
of the shorter cases (especially the Sune). What about the rest of 
you?

    James,
If you want to cut down the numnebr of alforithms you needfor a 2-look last
layer dramatically then you can try my site
http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/cubertscubicle.  It is pretty easy to
build on your F2L and avoid most of the OLL algorithms by using the L2L1a
method.  You only need the few (6) corner orientations which is so much
easier to learn and to recognise.  It gives you the option later of either
learning the full OLL set or trying some of the other L2L strategies which
are more efficient.

    I use Petrus method myself so I¬¥ll try to give you a few tips. Most of 
them are tips for speedcubing in general. 

1.Go SLOW on F2L this is the same tip everybody gives you and the best 
you¬¥ll ever get. During whole F2L don¬¥t even try to speed up, just 
make slow turns and try to find the next cubies while doing this. It 
takes a time to learn to do it but going really slow helps. Actually I 
think it¬¥s the only way to learn looking ahead. This also prevents 
cube lockups and POPs.
It¬¥s faster to go slow with no delays than to go fast with lots of 
delays ;)

2. Take more than 15 seconds to examine the cube, take as long as you 
need. Try to see the whole 2x2x2 solution before starting. When you do 
this long enough you¬¥ll be able to see it during the 15 sec you get in 
competition.

3. Try to make clear what you need for the next step. Make rules on 
how to look for and recognize cubies you need. One good trick is to 
repeat the colors of the cubie in your head while looking for it.

4. For LL learn to recognize patterns fast and understand what the 
algorithms you use do (how the cubies move and turn). Here you want to 
use speed, so learn the algs by heart. Fingertricks and triggers are 
the keys to fastness When you start feeling LL goes without bigger 
delays learn a few new algs and start slowly with them until you can 
do the in full speed.

5. Don¬¥t only practice speedsolving. As Lars Petrus adviced me: "Half 
the training should be "thinking solves" where you go slow and learn 
how cubies move when you do different things".

6. Practice, without it you won¬¥t become faster.

Hope that gave you some pointers,
Mikael

    My favourite OLL is still the Sune,
because it is the first algorithm for LL that I learned.
It's also the first move that showed me what a fingertrick is 
(Lars Petrus shows on his site how fingertricks work by performing the
Sune). 

It's fast, easy, and I get no lockups with this alg. 

If I had to choose another one, I would take Case #57 from 
Dan Harris's site 
http://www.necrophagous.co.uk/cubestation/orientations/ollprintablepage.html
I sometimes get lockups with it but I like the way I use my thumb
in this alg.

That's exactly what I do. Or at least did when I learned it, don't 
think I do it consciously now.

The other thing is to realize that there only are at most 8 or 12 
places the cubie can be. As you complete more of the cube, those 
numbers shrink.

The wrong, but very natural,  way to try to find it is to look at the 
whole cube and hope it will "pop out" and show itself for you. We've 
all kept staring aimlessly, with rapidly increasing panic, for a piece 
that refuses to be found. Instead I scan each of the positions it can 
be in, one by one. You can do this very fast with practice.

The next level is when you can be confident enough that if it can be in 
7 spots, and you've checked that it isn't in 5-6 of them, you can start 
acting on the fact that it has to be in the 1 or 2 you can't see 
without actually looking.

Of course, better than looking is to already know where the piece is. 
To me, the ideal solve is when I can find the pieces for a step while 
I'm performing the previous step. I suspect that is the essence of the 
"go slow" advice. You need to go so slow that you can do that, but no 
slower. Like most things, it's something you can practice. And you need 
to know how to do it slowly before you can do it fast.

    one annoyiing thing is when the corner edge pair is in

you  can consider that as a free slot, so that you can
bring it out while filling in another f2l slot.

DanH has some good advice on that check out his site.

This is something that I do a lot with the 4x4 edges step as well.  It
isn't typical 3x3 speedcubing, but it is still a useful technique for
larger puzzles.

I have a certain order in which I always examine the edge groups on
the 4x4 while pairing edge groups.  If I have examined 10 edge groups
and still haven't found my piece then I automatically know exactly
where the edge is without having to look (I know some information
about two of the edge groups at all times).

This is also a prinicple part of my startegy in that at certain points
in the step I need to make sure that an edge isn't located in one of
two specific edge groups of the 12.  If I can be sure of this fact,
then it makes it much easier to find the piece, knowing that now I
only have to search 8 locations instead of 10.

I think the strategy Lars mentioned about narrowing down the locations
that a piece can be in, and acting on that "process of elimination"
without ever having actually seen the piece is very important.  For
larger cubes too.

    Hey!

The most efficient way to get a good lookahead is to minimize ur 
number of algorithms. Then u subconsciously learn how the pieces are 
moving, where they are landing so to speak, and u also 
subconsciously use that to plan ur next step. In extreme cases u can 
then not only plan next step but maybe also 2 steps ahead. It also 
helps if ur algs move only a few pieces. I utlilise this to an 
extreme in how i solve the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes. Mostly using 3-
cycles on edges or corners i by and large always know where the 
pieces will be. There's no "panic" after an alg to start searching 
for cubies. I know that minimising ur number of algs is maybe not a 
good approach if u wanna be among the fastest cubers on 3x3x3. But 
it sure helps on u lookahead and flow. I average about 27 secs now 
on the 3x3x3 using a minimum of algs and having a 4-look last layer. 
I can live with that ;-)

Happy cubing!

Hi,

I have a small website with a beginners solution, where I explain in 
detail how to solve the cube. It's: www.solvethecube.co.uk. From 
what I understand, the edges of the last layer are orientated, but 
not the corners. I think that would be step 5 of my solution. The 
solution on my website only uses moves that are pretty intuitive, 
and it is therefore a little inefficient. For a more straightforward 
solution of the last layer, check: 
http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html.

P.S. What does X2 or X4 mean? It looks like R'D'RD X2 is not really 
an algorithm, but more like a part of a 'system'. Where did you find 
this?

Joel.

Hi Luke,

   I'm surprised that your algorithms don't all begin R2D2! 

   All you need for the Last Level is 4 algs.

   We call movement, or a swap, "permutation," and we call rotating
and flipping "orientation", so 
1. orients corners, 
2. permutes corners, 
3. orients edges and 
4. permutes edges.

Do each of these three times and you return to the beginning state.
Such are called "three cycles."

1.   R U R' U R U2 R' U2 (rotates three corners clockwise and moves
three edges clockwise) 
2.   R U' L' U R' U' L U (rotates three corners clockwise and moves
them counterclockwise, leaves edges alone)  In truth this swaps two
corners.
3.   r U' r' U2 r U' r' (flips two edges moves three counterclockwise)
4.   R2 U b U2 b' U R2 (moves three edges clockwise without affecting
corners) 

   You may need to apply an alg more than once.

   Tell Han he still owes me.

Regards,

David J

I see that chess and other tournaments (competitions in science, math, etc.) give out loads of cash...  How hard will it be in making that come through for Rubik's organization?  The probable problem is that there isn't any sponsors...  But maybe this could help the Rubik's organization/community?  Maybe we could do something to get some sponsors.

    Hello!

 

You can also (if you wish) follow the progress of my ¬ìstudents¬î who I am
currently teaching to solve the Cube as part of our ¬ìSociety activities¬î.
Each week we are meeting, (this week was the first time), and we are
building up a layer by layer solution to the Cube.

 

Each week I will put the contents from the workshops onto my website, -
www.cubestation.co.uk &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/&gt;  ¬ñ and eventually this
will grow into a full, easy to understand solution for beginners. Just go to
my site and click on the ¬ìUEA Cube Club¬î link which is in the red menu
panel.

 

I hope some of you will find this useful!

 

Dan Harris :-)

Hi,

I have a small website with a beginners solution, where I explain in 
detail how to solve the cube. It's: www.solvethecube.co.uk. From 
what I understand, the edges of the last layer are orientated, but 
not the corners. I think that would be step 5 of my solution. The 
solution on my website only uses moves that are pretty intuitive, 
and it is therefore a little inefficient. For a more straightforward 
solution of the last layer, check: 
http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html.

P.S. What does X2 or X4 mean? It looks like R'D'RD X2 is not really 
an algorithm, but more like a part of a 'system'. Where did you find 
this?

Joel.

    I believe you are using the new solution booklet. R'D'RD does mess it up.
However, I think x2 or x4 means to actually do R'D'RD twice, not do that and
rotate around the x axis. You have to do R'D'RD until the corner you were
working on is oriented correctly, regardless of how messed up everything
else is. Then do U until you find another corner that is messed up, and do
R'D'RD until that corner is oriented correctly. Keep turning U to an
un-oriented corner and doing R'D'RD  twice or four times until the cube is
solved. I hope that helps.

    Hi all,
after my last post I wrote yesterday, I got a message from Chris Hardwick saying that someone here was being badly concerned by the last sentence (I don't know who, but at least one person was). I'm ok, it was actually supposed to be a joke, but since someone misunderstood it, I had to make it clear. I deleted the mail anyway, so there won't be any problem anymore... Sorry about having to write this too. I apologize very sincerely for that sentence.

    Most chess tournaments that I have played in make money from the entry fees

tournaments to help boost their annual funds (and still give out some prize

    Hey Duncan,

What did you compete in in 1983?!?

I charge a minimal amount at my tournaments.  Usually just enough to 
break even so about $3 per person.  Definitely not enough to give out a 
cash prize.  Whereas a cash prize is cool, I mean... I think it would 
be an issue if the same person kept winning the competition over and 
over again with no one even close to beating him.  Sure it's fine, but 
I worry that a cash prize might discourage people when this is the 
case.  I try to keep entry fees to a minimum so that everyone will 
enter... especially those who learned how to solve the cube the day 
before or those that need some coaxing to compete.

    Hi Tyson,
There was a team tournament held in Birmingham, England in 1983.  I was at
Warwick University at the time and we sent a team.  I think we came second
but I don't remember the details.  I think it was five people per team and
held on a head to head basis - teams moved around the room and competed
against each other over a number of solves.  I seem to remember being
surprised at the numbers - probably around ten teams (including some
reserves).  It was at this tournament that I broke the onehanded record
(with around 53 seconds) after the original holder had reduced his record
down to around 80 seconds - it all sounds quite quaint now in the light of
Chris' fantastic records!  I think it was at the same tournament that
another of our team John White broke the blindfold record (it was of the
order or 20 minutes I think!).
I guess chess has the advantage of being able to award grading prizes or
hold limited grade tournaments (thats certainly very common over here in the
UK anyway).  Or maybe less experienced speedcubers could be enticed with
prizes for those with best times over 20, 30, 40 seconds etc.
I think these days I'd expect to pay ~ √Ø¬ø¬Ω10 to enter a chess tournament -
over $20!  Speedcubing is cheap!

Duncan

    Hi Duncan,

I've always thought about that.  People ask me if there are divisions?  
Like... sub-20 cubers vs. non-sub 20 cubers?  Unfortunately, how can 
you say that someone is sub-20?  "I've only done a sub-20 average once 
and that was lucky."  Then watch them as they try to hit 20.01 every 
time on the pad.  Any ideas?

&gt; over $20!  Speedcubing is cheap!

I remember someone appearing on TV on the News in around 1981 or 1982,
solving the cube in 45 seconds which was an incredible speed for the time
- could that have been you?

    Hi Gillian,
Sadly not - I had offers to go on TV but had the sense to realise I would
have been too nervous to be any good.  John White the "behind-the-back"
cuber did appear - probably on "Nationwide" or something like that - in
about 1982/83.

I only remember one other fast UK solver from the time and he was Tony
Willets (I think!).  he was at the Birmingham tournament and he was very
fast - sub 25 which was quick then.

    Hi Tyson,
Apart from only allowing averages or times set in official tournaments I
dont see what you can do about it other than trust.  And with money on the
line maybe people can't be trusted.  In chess, gradings come from tournament
and match play but there are many more opportunities to get an offical
grading than there are with speedcubing.  Still someone who has never been
in a tournament but practiced hard at home maybe should be eligible for
"grading" prizes.  In Chess Open Tournaments players of all grades are mixed
but those of lower grades - say below 2000 or below 1800 USCF - are eligible
for more prizes - the highest score of anyone in their rating category as
well as the usual prizes.  They are only allowed to win one prize of course!

How many entrants do you tend to get in tournaments?

    Hi All,

This topic has come up in the past, and while I see the reasoning
behind giving prizes to different levels of times, I don't agree with
it.  For one, as Tyson said, what's to stop someone from slowing down
just a bit in order to get the prize?

Even if everyone tried their best on every solve based on the honor
system, there's still a flaw.  Say competitor A averages 20.53, and
competitor B gets 19.24.  A gets rewarded for their time, yet they did
worse than B, who got nothing?  The only way to be fair to those just
under each "cut" for prizes is to not have different levels of time.

    Hi Chris,
It works just fine in chess as an incentive for everyone to improve.  It
doesn't quite work as you have in your example.  The over-20 second
category, for example, is available for those who have never broken 20
seconds in a tournament before.  The chances are that the prize for those in
the over-20 second category would be won by someone who breaks 20 seconds
for the first time - and thus is not eleigible for that category the next
tournament that he or she enters.  The time category prizes like this should
never be as lucrative as the main prizes for the "open" winner so there is
incentive to keep improving in addition.

I'm not saying it is the way to go - but it should encourage younger and
newer speedcubers to participate.

    I think it would be much better to give prizes to like top 3-5 or so 
than different time groups.  This way, it gives people more 
incentive to improve, but it does not mean that you have to be the 
fastest person to win prize money.  Breaking it up into time 
categories doesn't really make much sense.  Somebody who solves in 
19 seconds is not much better than somebody who solves it in 21, so 
they should not be placed into different categories.

    Well setting up tournaments in one place every time can lead to the issue of someone winning every time....
However if there was national professional regulation on this (as chess does; there's a HUGE chess tournament in Minneapolis this May) throughout the country/world etc., of course that would be more efficient in keeping variety of times, and growth of the community.  It's something we could consider for the cubing community; economists feel free to reply.
People may feel declined to pay large entry fees (leading to cash prizes) because they might not be "good" enough, especially if they know who's gonig to "win" the prizes.  But if there's a large variety of areas to win in some way, (different categories, etc.), or "top 15 get prizes", etc. is a possiblity.  In either case, if people feel they aren't going to win something, most won't be willing to pay large amounts or be affiliated with tournaments...

Hi Gillian,
Sadly not - I had offers to go on TV but had the sense to realise I would
have been too nervous to be any good.  John White the "behind-the-back"
cuber did appear - probably on "Nationwide" or something like that - in
about 1982/83.

I only remember one other fast UK solver from the time and he was Tony
Willets (I think!).  he was at the Birmingham tournament and he was very
fast - sub 25 which was quick then.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi Tyson,
&gt; &gt; There was a team tournament held in Birmingham, England in 1983.  I was
&gt; &gt; at Warwick University at the time and we sent a team.  I think we came
&gt; &gt; second but I don't remember the details.  I think it was five people per
&gt; &gt; team and held on a head to head basis - teams moved around the room and
&gt; &gt; competed against each other
&gt;
&gt; I remember someone appearing on TV on the News in around 1981 or 1982,
&gt; solving the cube in 45 seconds which was an incredible speed for the time
&gt; - could that have been you?

    Hey everyone,

 

Although I don't posess Gilles' remarkable video editing talents, I did
enjoy making a little video of Ron solving the cube in 17 something seconds.
Complete with very apt music! Those of you in the UK should recognise it
instantly, those of you who are not should know that it is probably the most
famous piece of game show music in existence.

    Just an idea that popped into my head after all the comparison with
chess.  How about races?  Much like chess matches, have people race
eachother, best out of three or somethign like that.  I know that
actualy having two people solving at the same time head to head isn't
much different than just solving, but the idea sounds cooler i think,
and would be more "intense"(if cubing can be considered intense ;-)
i dont know exactly how it would work or anything, i just thought it
sounded cool

Until next time, Happy Cubing

    Hi Duncan,

We get maybe 30 competitors for each tournament.  Larger and better 
publicized tournaments such as US Nationals and the Winter 2005 at the 
Exploratorium received between 40 and 50 competitors.

&gt; Hi Tyson,
&gt; Apart from only allowing averages or times set in official tournaments 
&gt; I
&gt; dont see what you can do about it other than trust.  And with money on 
&gt; the
&gt; line maybe people can't be trusted.  In chess, gradings come from 
&gt; tournament
&gt; and match play but there are many more opportunities to get an offical
&gt; grading than there are with speedcubing.  Still someone who has never 
&gt; been
&gt; in a tournament but practiced hard at home maybe should be eligible for
&gt; "grading" prizes.  In Chess Open Tournaments players of all grades are 
&gt; mixed
&gt; but those of lower grades - say below 2000 or below 1800 USCF - are 
&gt; eligible
&gt; for more prizes - the highest score of anyone in their rating category 
&gt; as
&gt; well as the usual prizes.  They are only allowed to win one prize of 
&gt; course!
&gt;
&gt; How many entrants do you tend to get in tournaments?

    Dan Knights uses a standard Fridrich method.  Nothing special.  I 
really wish he would keep in contact with the community a little bit 
more.  Just a hint of life would be nice.

I also think many cubers have gotten to much higher strengths since WC 
2003.  The standards for "one of the best" are now much higher.

    I've been thinking about the same thing. It's a whole different kind of 
competition where good nerves are even more important than for regular 
cubing, and where a lot more people can win. Also, it can be done quite 
fast, even with a large number of people.

I suggest best of three, since I think is the most nerve wrecking 
format.

Ideally, it would NOT be done using timers, but with a simultaneous 
start, where the first on to place his solved cube on some surface 
wins. You'd have to prevent violent contention for it.

    I've been in contact with Dan sparsely via e-mail over the past months
since he moved to NC.  From what I hear he is still practicing a lot,
but is busy at his job teaching high school now.

Also, as a side note, some of my friends from Duke University were
chaperoning (I know I butchered the spelling of that word) some people
for a large high school math competition for our state, and Dan
Knights happened to be there chaperoning his group as well.

The friends I knew from Duke said that Dan had a cube with him and was

    Hi Evan,
Yeah that thought crossed my mind too when I was posting yesterday and I
agree it would make for an exciting event.  I am pretty sure that the team
event that I competed in back in the 80's was raced head to head between
teams but I can't remember how we scored it.

Just an idea that popped into my head after all the comparison with

eachother, best out of three or somethign like that.  I know that
actualy having two people solving at the same time head to head isn't

&gt; People may feel declined to pay large entry fees (leading to cash prizes)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Tyson,
&gt; &gt; &gt; There was a team tournament held in Birmingham, England in 1983.  I
was
&gt; &gt; &gt; at Warwick University at the time and we sent a team.  I think we came
&gt; &gt; &gt; second but I don't remember the details.  I think it was five people
per
&gt; &gt; &gt; team and held on a head to head basis - teams moved around the room
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; competed against each other
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I remember someone appearing on TV on the News in around 1981 or 1982,
&gt; &gt; solving the cube in 45 seconds which was an incredible speed for the
time
&gt; &gt; - could that have been you?

    Hey Chris :-)

That is all well and fine about Dan Knights. Another top cubist who 
has little or no contact with the online cubing community is Jess 
Bonde. I'm particularly interested in knowing when he plans to 
reopen his excellent site www.rubiks.dk ;-) I really love his online 
timer. His offline timer is not so great since it uses cookies and 
not a database (for obvious reasons of coz). Another great "lost" 
cubist is of coz Dan Gosbee. Is he still cubing? And what happened 
to the cornersfirst group?

Happy cubing!!

    I think that might be because it dries slowly. On the Spanish group, 
someone recently said it keeps dripping out.

But I don't have a problem with that. I think I should modify my 
question: I'm painting the insides of my cubes with it. Yes, using a 
paintbrush. I apply about one big drop per cubie and then keep 
"painting" it until it's dry. Took me about 30 minutes for the whole 
cube I think.

So my new question is: Does it *damage* the cube somehow? Or is the 
only negative effect that it might not last long in which case I could 
still change to silicon spray?

Cheers!
Stefan

    Hey Stefan !

My simple advice is this: don't use the rubiks.com tube-lube. It's 
messy to apply, dries painfully slow and wears out really fast. 
Stick to silicone spray lubricant. Well, if u happen to have some 
left of it it shouldn't damage ur cube. But don't buy more of the 
stuff ... hehe ;-) For cubes other than eastsheen ones any silicone 
spray should work. Petroleum-based or not. The plastic on eastsheens 
doesn't like the petroleum-based silicone much (or at least not 
mine).

I have spilt the damn tube-lube over a keyboard, my pants etc. I got 
it with my diy cube. Switching to normal silicone spray lowered my 
average by 2 secs !!! So forget the silly tube-lube whatever others 
might say :D

Happy cubing,

-Per

PS! Hmm maybe the tube-lube paradoxically works nicely on the 
eastsheens? Haven't tried that yet ;-)

a 
&gt; paintbrush. I apply about one big drop per cubie and then keep 
&gt; "painting" it until it's dry. Took me about 30 minutes for the 
whole 
&gt; cube I think.
&gt; 
&gt; So my new question is: Does it *damage* the cube somehow? Or is

    Hi Per,

it's not messy the way I use it and it's dry after those 30 minutes. 
So that's not a big problem. Also, I don't use much to paint an entire 
cube, so I guess I can lube one cube maybe 5-10 times with one tube. I 
just do have 30 tubes and I don't like to think of it as waste :-(

I did prepare one of my DIYs with it already and I think it's not bad, 
so far I like it. I'll lube it again and see how well it turns. And 
then I'll prepare another one with silicone spray and compare them. I 
was mainly worried about damaging my cubes but if the worst case is 
just that they could be better then that's ok. Also, since I want to 
use them mainly for blindsolving it might actually be bad if they're 
too smooth (cause that could lead to accidental unwanted twists which 
are deadly in blindfolding ;-).

Oh, and if you come to GCD2 I'll show you my cube lube tube prepared 
cube and you tell me how you like it :-) I think it is a bit better to 
apply it the way I do than just to squirt it inside and twist it...

Thanks and Cheers!
Stefan

    I've been advocating such kind of Cube Duels earlier. I have 
perfomed it in the simple way that one scambles the others cube and 
with simultaneous start, the first to solve wins. Very easy when 
meeting other Cubists at pubs etc. A developed version would be to 
have ten scrambed cubes each and the first who solves all ten wins. 
Or maybe one 2x2x2, one 3x3x3, one 4x4x4 and finally one 5x5x5. Or 
weight the number of cubes to the time it takes to solve, something 
like: one 5x5x5, two 4x4x4 and ten 3x3x3. One may include one-
handed, blindfolded, feet,...  And combined with relay teams. 
Endless possibilites!

&gt; 
&gt; I suggest best of three, since I think is the most nerve wrecking 
&gt; format.
&gt; 
&gt; Ideally, it would NOT be done using timers, but with a 
simultaneous 
&gt; start, where the first on to place his solved cube on some surface 
&gt; wins. You'd have to prevent violent contention for it.

&gt; &gt; Like a single elimination tournament?  We could do that in April 
if you
&gt; &gt; wanted.  It might be fun.  I was also thinking relay teams or
&gt; &gt; something.

&gt; &gt;&gt; eachother, best out of three or somethign like that.  I know 
that
&gt; &gt;&gt; actualy having two people solving at the same time head to head 
isn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; much different than just solving, but the idea sounds cooler i 
think,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and would be more "intense"(if cubing can be considered 
intense ;-)
&gt; &gt;&gt; i dont know exactly how it would work or anything, i just 
thought it

    In my opinion the best way to do the tournaments is they way they 
have been doing them.  If they section poeple into different groups 
and give the winner of each group a prize, then what is to keep a 
really faster cuber from trying to get into a bad division so they 
know they can win. If you make the entry fees to high it will 
dicourage people don't think they can win.  I don't think chess can 
be compared to speed cubing because there is no ratings in 
speedcubing. chess is a one on one compitition and that is why they 
are able to have a rating system.

    Hey Bob,

You do some pretty mean finger tricks there!  You should switch to 
cross-on-bottom or something.  Just learn to use your same method with 
the cross on the bottom.  You'll be really bad at first but it'll be 
worth it.  It will be training for when you learn the full Fridrich and 
then everything will be much easier to adjust.

    i started to make the switch last week.  it's pretty awkward, and my 
times are now around 2 minutes, but i'm sure it will pay off in the 
end.  i'm now doing cross on bottom and can do f2l moves that 
involve either only the edge or only the corner, and a few that 
place both.  it's  more than i knew before, so it's a start. :D  i 
just wish i didn't have so much school work so i could practice more.

&gt; Hey Bob,
&gt; 
&gt; You do some pretty mean finger tricks there!  You should switch to 
&gt; cross-on-bottom or something.  Just learn to use your same method 
with 
&gt; the cross on the bottom.  You'll be really bad at first but it'll 
be 
&gt; worth it.  It will be training for when you learn the full 
Fridrich and 
&gt; then everything will be much easier to adjust.

    Hi Dan,

I didn't know there was a version of that video with such a high 
quality...

Now everybody is posting new speedcubing videos, so I might post 
mine as well:

create a

    One problem if you did the races without timers, are races that are
too close to call.  I remember at the summer camp thing at stanford,
two guys were racing, and they put the cube down at what seemed to be
exactly the same time.  Because they were on a stackmat we found out
that one of them won by somewhere around 0.1 seconds or something like
that.  I guess if we did it without timers we could jsut redo ties? 
And also, pops.  My thought on pops would just be, you pop, you keep
going.  No redoes because of pops.  Just my ideas on this subject.

&gt; I've been advocating such kind of Cube Duels earlier. I have 
&gt; perfomed it in the simple way that one scambles the others cube and 
&gt; with simultaneous start, the first to solve wins. Very easy when 
&gt; meeting other Cubists at pubs etc. A developed version would be to 
&gt; have ten scrambed cubes each and the first who solves all ten wins. 
&gt; Or maybe one 2x2x2, one 3x3x3, one 4x4x4 and finally one 5x5x5. Or 
&gt; weight the number of cubes to the time it takes to solve, something 
&gt; like: one 5x5x5, two 4x4x4 and ten 3x3x3. One may include one-
&gt; handed, blindfolded, feet,...  And combined with relay teams. 
&gt; Endless possibilites!

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I suggest best of three, since I think is the most nerve wrecking 
&gt; &gt; format.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ideally, it would NOT be done using timers, but with a 
&gt; simultaneous 
&gt; &gt; start, where the first on to place his solved cube on some surface 
&gt; &gt; wins. You'd have to prevent violent contention for it.

    Ouch, I deserved that.  I should confess.  The 12.05 second solve was 
kind of prepared.  I had solved that cube in 13.98 seconds and it is my 
current personal best so I rescrambled it and gave it a few tries and 
then taped it so... yeah.  I lose.

&gt; &gt;&gt; That's a modification of an old video, right? You should create a
&gt; &gt; new
&gt; &gt;&gt; one of you rather than use an old one of Ron. Or aren't you capable
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; solving in 17s? ;-)

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Complete with very apt music! Those of you in the UK should

I know this isn't exactly cube related, but I wanted to share some
news with you all.  Last week, I asked my girlfriend Christy to
marry me, and I'm glad to say that she said yes.  Just wanted to let
you all know that now there will be another cube couple in a few
months to join the others...  (Jon and Jean, Grant and Betty, Dan
and Brittany)

Yes, analazing different cubing styles could be interesting!

&gt; but I think I have much "larger" motions. Something to 
&gt; analyze...
&gt; 

Try to solve a cube with only 4 moves: L/M/R + U. You'll notice that
your hands (wrists) don't move a lot. And most of the insertions of U
turns between L/M/R moves can be considered as fingertricks.

    Grant,

Thanks so much for this. I've been looking for a cube timer for the 
iPAQ!!

FYI, I've just installed it on my HP hx4705 (WM2003SE, VGA screen) 
and it seems to run/display fine. I particularly like the very large 
start/stop buttons. Small start/stop buttons were things that 
bothered me on other general iPAQ timers I had installed.

It's very helpful that so many cubers are software engineers and can 
build these apps. I've been using Chris' JNetCube for standalone 
timing on my laptop, Jess' timer for when I'm online, and now I have 
Grant's iPAQ cube timer. Thanks guys -- you're awesome!! :)

&gt; Click start, you get a 15 second countdown (no sound to indicate

most

Additionally,

    Hi everyone,

I'm beginning to speed up now - in the last few days I've gone from around 
5 minutes with instructions to around 2 minutes 10-15 seconds with my 
hybrid solution plus a cheat sheet from the jeays.net site.

What I'm doing is this:-

I'm using the 3 layer solution incorporating a couple of methods I 
developed when I reached around a minute and a quarter in the early 80s and 
which I've never really forgotten.

I don't form either the cross or position the four corners but I do both at 
once, putting each cubie into place in order - side, corner, side, corner, 
keeping an eye out for where the next piece is so that I can anticipate and 
get other pieces into position.

I'm trying to move 180 degree turns as one move rather than stopping half 
way through the turn, and I'm solving the middle layer my own way.

I look to see if there are any pieces the right way round and incorrectly 
positioned and position as many as possible with variations of F2 U2 D2 
B2.  I avoid getting incorrectly orientated pieces into the correct 
position where possible especially if there are bottom layer pieces in the 
middle layer.  Then I position the remaining side pieces by positioning the 
correct pieces where there are wrong pieces first then filling in the 
gaps.  That can get pretty fast because with it it's possible to position 
two or three middle layer cubies at once with one algorithm of just four or 
five moves.

The final layer I use the algorithms from the jeays.net site - I am 
beginning to get more of it to memory now so I'm speeding up.

What I'm wondering is should I move on now and change to a different 
solution such as the LL or PLL to get faster, or should I concentrate on 
getting this method as fast as possible by learning it thoroughly and then 
adapt it further?  I'm still making mistakes with some moves particularly 
getting the middle layer cubies into place but that will come with practice.

I'm also wondering about the best way to move the middle slices, I do RL, 
FB, UD as necessary in the various formats but should I be moving the 
middle slice as one as opposed to the two slices on either side?

I'm one of the people who would never have solved the cube in the early 80s 
without using the Singmaster solution so I am quite prepared to use a 
solution now and adapt it to speed up again.  At the moment I'm using 
between 80 and 100 moves to solve the 3x3x3 cube so will appreciate any 
advice on speeding up:)

I could use some help answering the following questions:

What is the cubing subculture like?

As for the quirkiness of cubers - speed cubers especially - can you 
characterize them?

    cool

if you have a unique system that you think might be
something you feel like developing nothing is stopping
you.

sure the fridrich is fast, but maybe you could be up
to some new method :)

try to improve upon it and see if you can go sub 1min
that will be really cool, a new method weeeeeee.

many speedcubers are doing fridrich, idk but i think
we are becoming clones :\, cant help it hehe.

so yeah try some improvements. if things dont go well,
there is always the fridrich ;-)

    Ha, this sounds almost like an anthropology assignment. I did an
ethnography on the "International Rubik's Cube Community" a few months
back for an assignment.

&gt; What is the cubing subculture like?

It's like a giant cookie. Only there are about 300 chocolate chips and
maybe 10 caramel chips. The chocolate chips are those using Fridrich
and everyone else is caramel. Together we taste delicious, but just a
little too chocolaty. The bond between the chips is enormous and we
share one thing in common, we all are made of sugar.

&gt; As for the quirkiness of cubers - speed cubers especially - can you
&gt; characterize them?

Obsessive-compulsive individuals who love turning plastic at blazing
speeds and often suffer a dramatic GPA drop when they first discover
the Rubik's Cube.

Sorry, I suck.

Don't intend to hijack the thread here, but my girlfriend is a grad 
student in comm and would really like to get her hands on a copy of 
that ethnography if you still have it.  
  She's a casual cuber, solving in a few minutes on average.

As for the questions at hand, I can't say much about the subculture 
as the only interaction I have with other cubers is through this 
message board.  I've met 2 guys on campus who can do it too, but 
we're all so busy all the time we've never gotten together.

But the quirkiness... I'm rife with it.  I would say for some (myself 
included) part of the allure is doing something very well that not 
many people can do at all, and of course challenging yourself to do 
better each time.  Nothing quite feels like beating your best 
time/average.  Didn't really answer the question, just shared some 
thoughts...

    I was thinking about all the discussion on the boards regarding 
divisions and things.. and I wanted to input on an idea I had.

Is there any way there could be a head to head tourney like the way 
Tennis is set up?  I think in order for something like that to 
happen, people need to be ranked and only the top 100 can compete 
(with the occasional non-ranked players allowed to enter).

I am not sure how the tennis world comes up with rankings but i am 
assuming that its based on number of tourney wins.  For a system like 
this to be effective, there would have to be multiple tourneys a 
year.  

Anyways just a thought.. head to head tourneys are fun because its 
sometimes unpredictable.. Like the Sweet 16 for basketball, the ones 
slated to win dont nessessary win.. :)

    Oh this just occurred to me as a followup idea..

Purhaps have ranked players automatically allowed to enter the 
tourney and nonranked player compete in a qualifying round.. I think 
this is the way Tennis does it.. taht way nonranked players can still 
participate in the tournments.

Yes I'd agree with that one - from what I've seen on this board we tend to 
have a range of interests which are not shared by the vast majority of the 
population and at which we excel, a lot of cubers seem to be musicians as 
well and yes as I saw in another posting today a lot of cubers are also 
programmers of one kind or another.  And a lot of cubers also seem to have 
strong mathematical leanings with good memories and strong spatial 
development in objects such as puzzles where you have to be able to see at 
a glance where things are and where they will move to when you do certain 
things.

    I think that is typical. Most people on this list probably still 
haven't met any of the others.

Or in other words, cubing is an internet subculture, where people 
communicate with email and home made movies.

An odd feature is that almost everyone is either around 40 or 20.

    Hi Gillian,
It sounds like you do something similar to what I used to do in the early
80's.  I got to around 30-35 seconds with it.  The main problem is probably
the number of moves - 80-100 is quite a lot.  Most systems used now are
under 60.

If you want to try something different to Fridrich, with fewer moves to
learn, fewer moves to solve and therefore potentially somewhat faster I
believe, try my page
http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/cubertscubicle
If you haven't yet learned the Fridrich F2L then the systems on this site
offer an alternative where putting in middle edges with different moves is
the main approach.

Good look with whatever methods you use.

Duncan

    Some common characteristics:
There seem to be a surprising number of musicians in the community - I guess
creativity, nimble fingers and pattern recognition are common to both.
I agree that there are a lot of programmers - way back it used to be all
mathematicians and there are still a few of us about.
Hate to open this can of worms again but - mostly male!
Clearly fascinated by games and puzzles of all sorts - we've had a lot of
side discussions on other internet games and postings of fun puzzle sites.
I get the impression that the average age is fairly low although there are a
fair sprinkling of us older speedcubers.
Competitive.

    Well, we could do simultaneous starts with timers.  Then there's the 
nerve wracking part of actually competing against the other person in

    Indeed, mostly males and mostly programmers, or some other similar 
field.  Myself, I am am math major, and when people at school ask me 
my major after I solve it, they never seem surprised.  I think the 
reason for the age gap is because it seems that most people started

    Hello all, 

the first speedcubing video I saw was Dan Knights's.
When I saw his video I just couldn't believe it. 
The music was so awesome and his time of 18 seconds impressed 
me so much. I watched his video maybe 12 times a day and everytime
I got goose bumps. 
I think he inspired me the most. 

My favourite video is Macky's 19.83s solve with a pop.
http://www.henage.net/dan/cube/caltechspring.htm
Have a look at the guy who is watching Macky solving. 
He starts to smile after the solve and must have thought: 
"Uhh...wow...pop, and still faster than anyone else here?!"

By whom were you inspired the most, and what is your favourite 
speedcubing video?

    Two questions:

1) Do you know any site that shows on how to perform
fingertricks (basic ones like RUR')? I am searching for something
like Dan Knights's videos. 

2) Have you also noticed that people have different styles 
on how to perfom fingertricks?
 
Examples: 

-Burntbizzkit, Macky, Tyson: They seem to have their
index fingers rather stretched, while I personally bend it
when doing a U-turn.
An extreme example is Stefan Pochmann's solve
http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/other_stuff/videos/Cube15.wmv
Look at timeindex 11seconds, where he uses his index finger to 
perform U2.
Furthermore, the cube's position somehow seems
static, they dont tilt the cube.

-Zbigniew Zborowski and Chris Hardwick: They seem to turn the layers
by rather turning their wrist. And also in Chris's video the cube
doesn't seem static, he tilts the cube the whole time to look ahead. 

-And then Dan Knights: He uses his thumb a lot has his own cubing style.

I personally like Burntbizzkit's style. It looks so cool.

    Hi all, 

1) I wondered who of you can do extended crosses. And even
double-extended cross sounds incredible. 

2) Those of you who can do (double) extended cross, would it be easy
for you to switch to Gilles Roux's method, where you build a 1x2x3
block (especially Chris, the inventor of double extended cross)?
http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Step_1.html 

Quote from Gilles's site: 
"But methods that begin with a cross or a 2x2x2 block have a too easy
first step with only four corners or edges. Maybe five would be more
interesting, but you must be able to anticipate almost ten moves and
their effects on the five cubies."

&gt; 
&gt; 1) Do you know any site that shows on how to perform
&gt; fingertricks (basic ones like RUR')? I am searching for something
&gt; like Dan Knights's videos. 
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Have you also noticed that people have different styles 
&gt; on how to perfom fingertricks?
&gt;  
&gt; Examples: 
&gt; 
&gt; -Burntbizzkit, Macky, Tyson: They seem to have their
&gt; index fingers rather stretched, while I personally bend it
&gt; when doing a U-turn.
&gt; An extreme example is Stefan Pochmann's solve
&gt; http://www.stefan-pochmann.de/spocc/other_stuff/videos/Cube15.wmv
&gt; Look at timeindex 11seconds, where he uses his index finger to 
&gt; perform U2.
&gt; Furthermore, the cube's position somehow seems
&gt; static, they dont tilt the cube.
&gt; 
&gt; -Zbigniew Zborowski and Chris Hardwick: They seem to turn the 
layers
&gt; by rather turning their wrist. And also in Chris's video the cube
&gt; doesn't seem static, he tilts the cube the whole time to look 
ahead. 
&gt; 
&gt; -And then Dan Knights: He uses his thumb a lot has his own cubing 
style.
&gt; 
&gt; I personally like Burntbizzkit's style. It looks so cool.
&gt;

    Hey Edgardo,

I really need to overalhaul the introduction to my page to better
reflect my strategy on the extend cross as it is now.

I don't think it is a good idea now to use the extended cross startegy
every time, lots of times full cross solves flow much better and make
better use of RLUD moves than an extended cross solve would.  An
Xcross solve would be shorter, but a cross solve would be faster
(which is of course the most important to me).

I do, however, still use an extended cross or also even Petrich style
start quite often (2x2x2 as a sub-step, then solve the other 2 edges).

At some point I want to take a 100 average and see how often I
actually use a "non-cross" start, but I think it would be around
10-15% or so, so not as much as I mention on my page when I first
thought about converting to Xcross 100%.

As far as double extended cross solves, they are quite rare.  They
usually are the ones where I can form a 1x1x3 block out of 2 corners
and an edge, and can easily place the other egdges so as to form a
2x2x3.  If I can see this in 15 seconds, then I also make sure that
during those moves the last edge of the first layer doesn't end up
flipped (i.e. a "bad" position that takes more moves to solve after
the 2x2x3).

However there are also times where I can form an extended cross and
also preserve a c/e pair that I can see will be placed together.  So I
will do an extended cross solve, then follow with an easy 3 move c/e
insert.  These are not as rare as they would seem, and can often
provide good F2L times.

As far as Gilles' method, I've never really tried it to be honest, but
I have a rough method of estimating for other setups of pieces for the
starting step.

An extended cross (double extended crosses happen too infrequently, or
are too infrequently noticable to really count here as a basis) has 1
corner and 5 edges.  Every piece has a position and an orientation (2
for each edge and 3 for the corner) adding all that up I would "rate"
it at 19 (add up 1 for each position and 2 for each edge orientation
and 3 for the corner orientation).

A 1x2x3 has 2 corners and 3 edges, so by the same rating system it is
at 17, so I would call it easier to solve.  Again this is just my
crude rating system for figuring out very roughly how difficult a
beginning step would be.  Again I don't have experience with Gilles'
method so I can't compare it to an Xcross to say more concretely if it
is easier, but it seems there is less you have to solve for.

Also the double Xcross has a 25 rating by my system, which would also
explain why it is so hard and so rare to actually see a direct solve
double Xcross.

As a comparison a 2x2x2 has rating 13 and the cross has rating 12.

&gt; Hi all, 
&gt; 
&gt; 1) I wondered who of you can do extended crosses. And even
&gt; double-extended cross sounds incredible. 
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Those of you who can do (double) extended cross, would it be easy
&gt; for you to switch to Gilles Roux's method, where you build a 1x2x3
&gt; block (especially Chris, the inventor of double extended cross)?
&gt; http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Step_1.html 
&gt; 
&gt; Quote from Gilles's site: 
&gt; "But methods that begin with a cross or a 2x2x2 block have a too easy
&gt; first step with only four corners or edges. Maybe five would be more
&gt; interesting, but you must be able to anticipate almost ten moves and
&gt; their effects on the five cubies."

&gt; &gt; fast, even with a large number of people.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I suggest best of three, since I think is the most nerve wrecking

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ideally, it would NOT be done using timers, but with a simultaneous

&gt; &gt; wins. You'd have to prevent violent contention for it.

    The punch line then is Arthur saying "I always thought there was  
something fundamentally wrong with the universe".

But a cube marathon is 42 cubes because of the 42 kilometers, which is  
26 miles here. Maybe an American cube marathon would be 26 4x4x4's.

So for the 42 cube marathon do you need to use 42 different cubes, or do 
you use a single cube and scramble it with scrambles set by the marathon 
organiser?  That could make a difference in solution times if you're 
practising at home and don't have 42 cubes to hand!

Mind you maybe we could do that in this group, somebody set up 42 
scrambling algorithms that we're all to use then we have a marathon with 
each person using a single cube... would be fun anyway.

Interestingly, it works in base-13.  Thought to this fact DNA has 
retorted "No one writes jokes in base-13..."

And I for one am glad that we figured out why the pot of petunia's 
said "Oh no not again" before it plummeted to its death.

On an ACTUAL cube related noted, there is a handy cube reference in 
_Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency_, about trying to maneuver a 
sofa through an impossible small stairwell.  Douglas Adams was my 
hero!

Yet another proof it's good I always read all new posts before

Take away one or two assumptions, and clearly 6*9 = 42.

    Hey people, I've just signed up. I'm Keith, a 36 year old cuber from 
Australia. My best time so far is a lucky 29 sec. but I'm usually in 
the 40/50 second range. 

I learned to solve the cube just after I left school in '84, I could 
only do the first 2 layers so I bought a solution book to learn the 
last layer. 

I always kept a cube handy after the big craze died off and got into 
speedcubing about 6 months ago.

Unfortunately there aren't any competetitions that I know of over 
here but I'd like to see that change in the future.

Just out of curiosity, what kind of cube do you guys (and girls) 
favour?

    I agree with Tyson. I tried a Studio and some other random cubes and
always fall back to my trusty Rubiks.com cube. I like the arched
centers on the newer cubes. I wish that I didn't loose mine a week ago :(

The cube I'm using now is a Rubiks.com cube and, after about a week,
it works great. It was horrible at first, but turns like a champ now.

me, it is also a speedsolving video that inspired mi
to be a speedcuber, when i saw the first speedsolving
video of my life, it was chris hardwick's speedsolving
video, solving it for 17.88 seconds, with a matrix
background music, it was really cool!!!! i watch it
for i don't know  how many times already, and also the
video of macky's 12.11 seconds world record..........

    Hey!"

I again have a Rubiks Studio cube and really like. I like to be able 
to adjust the screw tention to get the sides to turn equally. I also 
have a rubiks.com cube but it¬¥s one of the bad ones so I don¬¥t like it 
one bit (and now that my girlfriend started cubing she uses it).

I also have my beloved first cube (a -81 Ideal), it¬¥s so worn out the 
corners sometime turn (so that the cube becomes unsolvable) without 
poping and it sounds like a rattlesnake =D

    Hi

&gt; 2) Have you also noticed that people have different styles 
&gt; on how to perfom fingertricks?

I think it's very interesting to compare styles. A large fraction of 
speedcubers use more or less the same system (Fridrich or variant) but 
the way people put it into practice is unique and it can be 
fascinating to watch.

What always strikes me when I compare my style to others, is that I 
barely use my left hand. Just have a look at some of my videos on this 
page:

http://www.cubezone.be/videos.html

Especially the 13.09s solve is a good example. 95% of the movements is 
done with my right hand and my left hand is just supporting the cube 
and doing the occasional U' move. It's something I've been wanting to 
change because I'm sure I can benefit from developping the dexterity 
my left hand much more.

    759. 4x4x4 method

    I have had a 4x4x4 for some time now and have lately started to think 
about getting in to speedsolving it.

My current method is this:

1. Make 3 centers and the three edge groups that go with them, thereby 
forming a 3x3x3.
2. Make a forth center and the two edge groups that I need to extend 
to a 3x3x4.
3. Form the two remainging centers and the three edge groups to form a 
3x4x4 block (F3L)
4. Solve the LL edge groups and do normal 3x3x3 LL to solve LL.

This is my adaption of the Petrus method to the 4x4x4 cube. The only 
thing I don¬¥t do is to orientate all corners after finnishing the 
3x3x4.
Does anyone else use a modified or standard Petrus for the 4x4x4?

For those who already are fast on the 4x4x4 how does this method sound 
to you in means of speed, recognition and number of moves?

For the moment I average about 150-200 moves but I use my own 
(inefficient ways) of pairing up the edge groups. My times are around 
3 minutes mostly because it still takes lots of time to find the 
cubies I need.

Is this something worth trying to improve and become fast at or is it 
just better to switch to an other method (I know it¬¥s a short step to 
the method Chris uses)?

    There has been a lot of talk about all kinds of cubing videos lately 
and most of us like to watch them. When I first started cubing I 
searched the web for speedcubing videos and found it quite difficult 
to find any.

The one thing I noticed that I never found a video archive with loads 
of vidoes. Only a few vidoes here and there on different sites 
(usually of the one hosting the site). I think it would be really cool 
to have a big archive (on speedcubing.com maybe?) where everybody 
could post their own vidoes. The archice could be divided in different 
categories like 2x2x2, 3x3x3, fingertricks, LL algs etc. and 
subcategories (normal, onehanded, blindfolded etc.) and then arranged 
by performer or time. The archive could also contain links to pages 
with videos.

Now I don¬¥t know anything about these kinds of things but if someone 
would make the effort to put an archive that ppl can submit their 
videos to by filling in some kind of form I can¬¥t imaging the whole 
thing to be too much work. Or am I completly wrong?

This is something I¬¥ve been missing!

Just an idea,
Mikael

&gt; There has been a lot of talk about all kinds of cubing videos 
lately 
&gt; and most of us like to watch them. When I first started cubing I 
&gt; searched the web for speedcubing videos and found it quite 
difficult 
&gt; to find any.
&gt; 
&gt; The one thing I noticed that I never found a video archive with 
loads 
&gt; of vidoes. Only a few vidoes here and there on different sites 
&gt; (usually of the one hosting the site). I think it would be really 
cool 
&gt; to have a big archive (on speedcubing.com maybe?) where everybody 
&gt; could post their own vidoes. The archice could be divided in 
different 
&gt; categories like 2x2x2, 3x3x3, fingertricks, LL algs etc. and 
&gt; subcategories (normal, onehanded, blindfolded etc.) and then 
arranged 
&gt; by performer or time. The archive could also contain links to 
pages 
&gt; with videos.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I don¬¥t know anything about these kinds of things but if 
someone 
&gt; would make the effort to put an archive that ppl can submit their 
&gt; videos to by filling in some kind of form I can¬¥t imaging the 
whole 
&gt; thing to be too much work. Or am I completly wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; This is something I¬¥ve been missing!
&gt; 
&gt; Just an idea,

It would require an enormous amount of space if you planned on
actually HOSTING all those videos. I think it would be better you
created a database that people could just send links to their videos.
Hosting of the videos would need to be done by the cubers.

    Hi Keith,

Welcome.

For speedcubing I rate the cubes:

1. Ideal Tiled Deluxe Edition
Best all around, no other cube comes close. It has adjusting screws
and is arched underneath the centers - the hard, slick plastic is
thicker than others and is faster unlubed than all the other cubes
lubed. It is a bit heavier than other cubes. Rarely pops or locks up.

The Rubik's Game/Challenge has Deluxe cubes with peg holes. I takes
about 5 minutes to get used to the peg holes which make for better grip.

2. The new cubes from Seven Towns (Rubiks.com, Hasbro, Winning Moves
and Hessport)
Comes with arched centers, can be ordered with screws. These never
pop. Lighter than the Deluxe, it takes lube well. Tends to lock up
more than the Deluxe. Averages 1 1/2 seconds slower than Deluxe for 30
second solve. The paper stickers wear out quickly because the sticker
edges catch on fingertips. If you can avoid touching the edges of the
stickers they will last longer. The "self colored plastic" stickers
wear well but don't look as good. The blue and green are easy to
confuse in low light.

3. Ideal cubes circa 1980-1983.
The ones made in Hungary, England, and Hong Kong are the best. Avoid
the Taiwan-made cubes. Has adjustable screws. Very few have arches,
but the arched version is the lightest official cube. Tends to pop
instead of locking up. Averages 2 1/2 second slower than the Deluxe
for a 30 second solve.

4. Rubik's studio cubes. The ones made in Hungary are have the best
plastic of cubes made nowadays. Comes with screws but not arches. Pops
quite a lot. Averages nearly three seconds slower than the Deluxe for
a 30 second solve. The ones made in Russia are not as good. I don't
know about the ones made in China.

5. Older Hasbro (etc) cube (before 2000) had screws, but not arches. A
friends older Hasbro speedcube is fairly quick, but I have little
experience with this one.

6. Wonderful Puzzler.
Well made, comes with arches. Never tried to make one into a
speedcube. I don't know if they have screws.

7. C*4 cube
Made by Matchbox in the late 80s, with Rubik's silkouette and
signature. Lousy plastic. Not a very good cube.

8. Mefferts
Decent plastic, but no springs or screws. Not good for speedcubing
because they have no pressure and you must stop a turn with effort.
Constantly locks up. 

9. "Old Brand Magic Square" Terrible cube, avoid it. These are made of
cheap thin plastic which breaks very easily. Some people use the tiles
one better cubes.

David J

&gt; Hey people, I've just signed up. I'm Keith, a 36 year old cuber from 
&gt; Australia. My best time so far is a lucky 29 sec. but I'm usually in 
&gt; the 40/50 second range. 
&gt; 
&gt; I learned to solve the cube just after I left school in '84, I could 
&gt; only do the first 2 layers so I bought a solution book to learn the 
&gt; last layer. 
&gt; 
&gt; I always kept a cube handy after the big craze died off and got into 
&gt; speedcubing about 6 months ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately there aren't any competetitions that I know of over 
&gt; here but I'd like to see that change in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; Just out of curiosity, what kind of cube do you guys (and girls) 
&gt; favour?
&gt; 
&gt;

    Yes, that is a very good idea. Like have a screen shot of the video,
with a discription and so on, but only a link. That way we could
devide up the bandwidth.

Or, we could use something like bittorrent to host all of the videos.
I would be willing to seed them.

    www.rubiks.dk had a huge archive of vids before the revamp.  I think

After the revamping he did have a page dedicated to video links.  
Anyone who was registered could link to their solving video on their

Hi Mikael,

I'd say it's definitely worth trying. I've been playing with some 
ideas to solve the 4x4 differently than I do so far (which is 
centers/edges/3x3). I think it will be good for recognition to do "3x3 
solving parts" not at the very end but instead earlier (e.g. like you 
do) because this limits the number of possible places that you have to 
look at to find pieces.

So try it and don't give up too easily! At the very least you'll learn 
something and you'll create something on your own, which is very good 
in my opinion.

Cheers!
Stefan

    I think you and I cube with very similar styles.  I also do almost all 
of my movements with my right hand while using only the left index 
finger to do a U'.  It's the product of the cross-on-left cuber.  I've 
been meaning to build ambidexterity though.  I think it'll help... and 
it can't hurt.

&gt;
&gt; I think it's very interesting to compare styles. A large fraction of
&gt; speedcubers use more or less the same system (Fridrich or variant) but
&gt; the way people put it into practice is unique and it can be
&gt; fascinating to watch.
&gt;
&gt; What always strikes me when I compare my style to others, is that I
&gt; barely use my left hand. Just have a look at some of my videos on this
&gt; page:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.cubezone.be/videos.html
&gt;
&gt; Especially the 13.09s solve is a good example. 95% of the movements is
&gt; done with my right hand and my left hand is just supporting the cube
&gt; and doing the occasional U' move. It's something I've been wanting to
&gt; change because I'm sure I can benefit from developping the dexterity
&gt; my left hand much more.

    I too have quite a few videos, about 1.75gigs of them.  Like Stefan
said, the EC2004 video is very large.  One of the things I'd like to
mention that whether someone hosts a video archive or not, a naming
scheme for videos needs to be set.  I have been naming the videos I
have as "Category Time NameOfPerson.avi" (or wmv, etc.).  So for
instance, I have "3x3x3 17'88 Chris Hardwick.mpeg".  This makes it
convenient, since all vids of the same puzzle are grouped, then listed
in order of speed.  It makes it a lot better than downloading
"cubefast.wmv" or "chris3.mpeg".

Also, I share all the vids I have on the campus network here at the
University of Maryland, and have had quite a few people download them
from me.  I get messages ranging from "wow thats cool!" to "is that
for real?" to "i hate that freaking toy".

    Another one of my hobbies is unicycling, and I know of a website that
hosts hundreds (thousands?) of unicycling movies and pictures here:
gallery.unicyclist.com
I don't know how much space that takes up, probably a lot, but he did
it somehow. So it must be possible....

&gt; There has been a lot of talk about all kinds of cubing videos lately 
&gt; and most of us like to watch them. When I first started cubing I 
&gt; searched the web for speedcubing videos and found it quite difficult 
&gt; to find any.
&gt; 
&gt; The one thing I noticed that I never found a video archive with loads 
&gt; of vidoes. Only a few vidoes here and there on different sites 
&gt; (usually of the one hosting the site). I think it would be really cool 
&gt; to have a big archive (on speedcubing.com maybe?) where everybody 
&gt; could post their own vidoes. The archice could be divided in different 
&gt; categories like 2x2x2, 3x3x3, fingertricks, LL algs etc. and 
&gt; subcategories (normal, onehanded, blindfolded etc.) and then arranged 
&gt; by performer or time. The archive could also contain links to pages 
&gt; with videos.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I don¬¥t know anything about these kinds of things but if someone 
&gt; would make the effort to put an archive that ppl can submit their 
&gt; videos to by filling in some kind of form I can¬¥t imaging the whole 
&gt; thing to be too much work. Or am I completly wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; This is something I¬¥ve been missing!
&gt; 
&gt; Just an idea,

&gt; I'd say it's definitely worth trying. I've been
&gt; playing with some 
&gt; ideas to solve the 4x4 differently than I do so far
&gt; (which is 
&gt; centers/edges/3x3). I think it will be good for
&gt; recognition to do "3x3 
&gt; solving parts" not at the very end but instead
&gt; earlier (e.g. like you 
&gt; do) because this limits the number of possible
&gt; places that you have to 
&gt; look at to find pieces.
&gt; 
&gt; So try it and don't give up too easily! At the very
&gt; least you'll learn 
&gt; something and you'll create something on your own,
&gt; which is very good 
&gt; in my opinion.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers!

    Just to make things perfectly clear for those who
haven't read the books, heard the radio series, seen
the TV show, or fell into the future through a hole in
the space-time continuum to May 6th (my birthday,
woohoo!) and seen the movie..... 







***SPOILER ALERT***







The Earth was actually a giant computer built for the
sole purpose of discovering the Ultimate Question of
Life, the Universe, and Everything. But when Arthur
Dent and Ford Prefect arrived on prehistoric Earth
with the Golgafrinchams, the program was disrupted.
Therefore the question "What do you get when you
multiply six by nine?" (which came from Arthur's brain
as a result of him being part of the penultimate
configuration of the computer program) is actually NOT
the correct Ultimate Question, and Arthur's lament
about always thinking that there was something
fundamentally wrong with the universe was merely born
of the fact that he had finally discovered the purpose
of his entire planet, only to realize at the same
moment that there was indeed something that had gone
fundamentally wrong with it, and that he was part of
the cause.

Ok, so maybe that did the opposite of making it
perfectly clear, but though it may be hard to tell
without knowing the rest of the story, you can believe
Tyson when he says it is "the most brilliantly crafted
line in all of nerd literature." To me, the subtlety
and various layers of humor and emotion that can be
extracted from what at first glance appears to be a
simple quip is what made Douglas Adams a true genius.
To quote DNA himself (speaking of a line by a
different author), "There is not much in the isolated
line to tell you that when you read it in context you
are at the pinnacle of one of the most sublime moments
in all English literature."

Anyhow, I hope I have managed to inspire at least one
of you to go and introduce yourself to these marvelous
books, and to anyone planning on seeing the movie, I
would recommend reading at least the first two books
("The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and "The
Restaurant at the End of the Universe").

Don't Panic!
Ben B.

P.S. Anyone who would like a copy of the original
radio series, the TV show, or any of the books-on-tape
(read by the author) including the Dirk Gently books,
please let me know.

    Getting back to a more cube-related topic, I recently
finished converting a 12-color tiled Megaminx into a
Super-Megaminx. I have not heard any discussion of
such a puzzle before, at least as more than just a
concept, and I can find no pictures of one. Has anyone
else made one of these?

My best time so far is 9:08.68, as compared to my best
time for a regular Megaminx of 5:05.24, but I'm
improving rapidly, besides which I haven't adjusted
the screws or lubed it yet.

An interesting fact about the Super-Megaminx (at least
to those interested in such things), is that while the
regular Megaminx has fewer possible positions
(1.007*10^68) than the 5x5x5 cube (2.829*10^74), the
Super-Megaminx has more (2.458*10^76), but still less
than the Super-5x5x5 (2.116*10^94), that is if I've
done my math correctly...

Also, I was happy to discover that the simple
Super-3x3x3 alg (FRFR')*5, which leaves the cube
solved except for a half turn of the F center, can be
applied to the Super-Megaminx: (FRFR')*12, which
leaves the Megaminx solved except for a
counter-clockwise 1/5 turn of the F center.

I'm very proud of my creation and how well it turned
out for a first attempt. I'll post some pictures of it
soon.

    Hey Ben,

That sounds like a very fun puzzle!  I'm curious what method you used
for the centers, to know when they are correctly oriented?  Did you
have to take some time to memorize which centers are oriented which
way before starting the solve?  Or do you use colors on each center so
you just have to line up the colors with the adjacent faces?

Also about your number of combinations, I get different numbers for
the cube puzzles.

For the 5x5 I get (2.8287 * 10^74), the super 5x5 I get (5.2892 *
10^93), which is exactly 1/4 your number btw.

I agree on the super megaminx number though, I also got (2.458*10^76).

As for the cube numbers, the method I used to get those figures is on
my page at http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/cubecombos.html

For the super 5x5 I think you didn't take into consideration that the
parity of both the center piece orbits is fixed once you have permuted
the 24-piece edge orbit and the 8 corners.  So you get the (24!)^3
term, but you have to divide by 4 to account for both center piece
obits having to have fixed parity based on the parities of the corners
and the 24-piece edge orbit.

By the way, you should do a super-megaminx no inspection solve too,
since that would be the purest form of timed megaminx solving that you
can do :)

It sounds in theory like a good idea to share the videos by 
something like BitTorrent. But im afraid of diverging availability. 
So i would still prefer that they be put on a dedicated server.

Another important thing is to standardise on the codec used for 
compression of the vids. I suggest using either windows media format 
(wmv) or divx (avi). 386 kbps should be good enough in most 
circumstances and would assure that those with limited bandwidth can 
also downloads vids for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cube (or megaminx or 
whatever).

Most videos can be uncompressed to raw avi and then be recompressed 
to the desired compressed format. (Virtual Dub or similar).

There will still be problems with larger tournaments vids like the 
swedish video from Amsterdam which is over 700 MB if i remember 
correctly. Thos vids will in reality still only be available for 
download for those with a good bandwidth. How about distributing 
those on cd/dvd? And pay via PayPal or something (symbolic amount to 
cover just the media cost + shipping).

Happy cubewatching ;-)

&gt; 
&gt; The one thing I noticed that I never found a video archive with 
loads

cool 
&gt; to have a big archive (on speedcubing.com maybe?) where everybody 
&gt; could post their own vidoes. The archice could be divided in 
different

&gt; subcategories (normal, onehanded, blindfolded etc.) and then 
arranged 
&gt; by performer or time. The archive could also contain links to 
pages 
&gt; with videos.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I don¬¥t know anything about these kinds of things but if 
someone 
&gt; would make the effort to put an archive that ppl can submit their

    Hey!

Cool that it works to "generalise" the (FRF'R)*5 on cubes to (FRF'R)
*12 on the megaminx. In terms of moves it's not short but probably 
as short as it goes?

Anyway it doesn't seem very productive to supersolve the megaminx by 
normal solve then orienting the centers like this. U would have to 
use that rather long alg something like (2*18)/5 + 2*(2*18)/5 times 
on average. This equals (36+72)/5 or approx 21 to 22 times. About 
1000 moves just for the center orientations :-P The lack of pure 
slice moves on the megaminx is the reason why we are not likely to 
find many short supergroup algs, i meanmore specifically algs only 
turning centers. Such algs are easily found on the 3x3x3 cube.

Therefore i believe it's most productive to orient all centers and 
then solve puzzle more or less exclusively with center-preserving 
commutators.. It should add something like 1:30 or 2:00 only to ur 
normal times. But it's only a rough estimate anyway.

I hate my megaminx cause it's bl**** 6-color version. With nasty 
parity issue and also recognition obscurities. I need to look at 
color-arrangement on the corners as well, when looking for the next. 
It' not enough simply to have the correct colors on that corner ... 
arrghhh ... And there are only 15 different edges, 2 of each. 2 of 
each is why we might end up w parity. The cure is to set up an edge 
3-cycle where two of the edges are of the same colors ;-)

If i resticker my megaminx to 12-color version i might as well make 
a super megaminx also ;-)

&gt; Getting back to a more cube-related topic, I recently
&gt; finished converting a 12-color tiled Megaminx into a
&gt; Super-Megaminx. I have not heard any discussion of
&gt; such a puzzle before, at least as more than just a
&gt; concept, and I can find no pictures of one. Has anyone
&gt; else made one of these?
&gt; 
&gt; My best time so far is 9:08.68, as compared to my best
&gt; time for a regular Megaminx of 5:05.24, but I'm
&gt; improving rapidly, besides which I haven't adjusted
&gt; the screws or lubed it yet.
&gt; 
&gt; An interesting fact about the Super-Megaminx (at least
&gt; to those interested in such things), is that while the
&gt; regular Megaminx has fewer possible positions
&gt; (1.007*10^68) than the 5x5x5 cube (2.829*10^74), the
&gt; Super-Megaminx has more (2.458*10^76), but still less
&gt; than the Super-5x5x5 (2.116*10^94), that is if I've
&gt; done my math correctly...
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I was happy to discover that the simple
&gt; Super-3x3x3 alg (FRFR')*5, which leaves the cube
&gt; solved except for a half turn of the F center, can be
&gt; applied to the Super-Megaminx: (FRFR')*12, which
&gt; leaves the Megaminx solved except for a
&gt; counter-clockwise 1/5 turn of the F center.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm very proud of my creation and how well it turned
&gt; out for a first attempt. I'll post some pictures of it
&gt; soon.

Hi Bob,

I think most speedcubers use their thumb for doing U' in most cases 
(depends on the situation.. In some cases you can pull it with you 
left index, or even push it with you right index, but I don't like 
to do that very much). Same thing for U with right index finger. You 
should search for some slow video's that illustrate how to do 
certain algorithms, and you'll see how cubers perform 'standard' 
triggers like RUR'U', RUR'U, RU2 etc. 

http://www.speedcubing.com/peter/AllesFastPermute.html has some slow 
videos, and I know you will find more of them. Here's anohter adres: 
http://puzzlingaddiction.com/vids/.

Good luck,

Jo√´l.

Umm, yes it's easy to remember and only half length of the other

Yes, that is what i meant actually. I expressed myself poorly. I

corner. More or less exclusively means that u can use free faces to 
transport pieces to good positions for commutator ;-)

How's it going with ur UuRr solving. I didn't do it much and now not

    To answer Chris's question, I used actual colors on
the centers for quick and easy orientation
recognition. I took each center tile and chopped five
trapezoidal pieces off the outside edges, leaving a
smaller pentagon in the middle, then swapped the
pieces around (very much like the center pieces on
Stefan's Super-5x5x5).

(R' d' R Ux R' d R Ux)*3 is a very cool alg, exactly
half the length of (FRFR')*12 and can fix any center
with only a single application, where (FRFR')*12 takes
two applications 50% of the time. However, to make it
truly SUPEReasy to understand, I would write it as (F'
U' R Ux R' U F Ux)*3. Is that easier? Maybe it's just
me...

In any case, I don't use such long algs when actually
solving it, instead I use a layered approach, for both
regular and super-megaminx solving, with the layers
all parallel to two opposite faces. To explain my
method, I'll refer to the layers thusly, from the top
and bottom in towards the middle:
1. U edges and corners, and D edges and corners
2. UA and DA edges (adjacent to the U and D faces,
respectively)
3. UA and DA corners(adjacent to the UA and DA edges,
respectively)
4. M edges (the ring of 10 edges in the middle)

1: The cross (pentagram?). Made with the D edges,
obviously. The D center and the 5 adjacent centers can
all be correctly oriented here with a minimum of extra
turns.

2: Insert the D corners and DA edges. Usually I insert
4 D corners and then use a working corner for the DA
edges, but I'm working on using CE pairs instead
(which are easier to do intuitively on the megaminx
given the greater free space you have to work with).

3. Insert the DA corners and M edges. This can be done
one piece at a time, or as a combination of 5 single
edges and 5 CE pairs. During this stage, the 5 centers
adjacent to the U face are oriented.

4. Insert 4 of the UA corner and UA edge pairs. Once
again these can be done individually or in CE pairs,
although doing the pairs intuitively at this stage is
harder because space is more limited.

5. Use the last UA slot and the U face to complete the
six remaining edges with edge 3-cycles. Usually takes
an average of about 3 cycles, but more like 4 if the U
center has to be oriented as well.

6. Complete the six remaining corners with corner
3-cycles. Obviously this would take 4 cycles if the
first three corners were done one at a time, but with
practice it can almost always be done with just 2.

So that's my method. There are so few Megaminx methods
out there, the more the better, I say. When I post
pictures of my Super Megaminx, I'll post some pictures
showing each stage of a solve. Who knows, perhaps when
I get some free time, I'll turn it into an actual
website with actual details!

    I would certainly like that!!

But I am afraid you can expect that there will not be that many 
events, because it will take very long, since there will be a lot of 
participants.. However, a 2x2 is not very hard to scramble, and 
solving is even faster, so maybe this one has a chance.

&gt; &gt; How's it going with ur UuRr solving. I didn't do it much and now not

&gt; 
&gt; Did that only very seldomly recently. I think after a few warmup

&gt; because I was the only one who seriously did it and competition is

I've been trying to figure out how you did the UuRr solving - looks
like you did centers, some edges, and then some other algorithms to
fix the thing, but I have absolutely no idea. How do you do that?

&gt; I'm not saying your wrong. Nichols was the first to make a

&gt; If Larry Nichols had an effective mechanism instead of one
&gt; based on magnets I don't think Ideal Toy (itself an American company)
&gt; would have passed on it. 

   It's hard to say what they were open to back then, but I think you
might be right.

&gt; To be fair I've no first hand information about his 
&gt; 2x2x2 but I don't see how a magnet-based 2x2x2 could work except
&gt; by forcing it apart and then letting it pull itself back together.

   I never tried one though I saw a magnet version for sale recently.

   I read that he first came up with it in 1957. Too bad that he
didn't come up with another mechanism.  Suppose a 2x2x2 had been
marketed back then, do you think others would have been inspired to
develop a 3x3x3 before 1974?

   Anyway, since Eastsheen's mechanism is different from Rubik's, the
mechanism isn't the issue. 
 
&gt; I'm not personally against the idea of allowing eastsheen or other
&gt; types of cubes in tournaments. 

  Neither am I.

   I think that there would be a better market for 2x2x2s if someone
made a decent one. Rubik's 3.75 milliimeter one is too small to
handle, and their 2 inch version is impossible to turn, and while
Eastsheen's is way too loose, at least it is halfway workable. So far
I've wasted a whole lot of time, energy and money trying for a good one. 

   Not letting other brands into the tournaments is fine if their
version is the original, like with the 3x3x3, when they are protecting
their idea and patents, and most knock-offs are bad, but I don't agree
with their not allowing the 2x2x2, when their version is not good, and
they didn't originate it.

&gt; In bowling tournaments you're not
&gt; constrained to use a particular make of bowling ball. In tennis
&gt; tournaments I'm pretty sure the players don't use only one
&gt; manufacturer of tennis racket.

   Players get paid for endorsing a brand. The manufacturers realise
is that if the good players prefer their brand, it will outsell their
competitors. Better product is what real open-market competition is
all about. I don't know what it will take to get someone to make an
good, adjustable 2x2x2, but I think it begins with letting them know
we want one.

David J

    I can do the Megaminx [except for the last layer. can't find any algs.
grr.] using what I call the "wimpy Petrus" method. Do a cross on the
bottom, then keep pairing up an edge and a corner (or sometimes just
an edge if you're starting on to a new face) and putting it in, then
when you have 2 faces left flip all the edges correctly, and on the
last side use some Sune equivalents to orient the corners. I have no
idea for PLL, though.

    So I was in lab and I came back to my room and it was on my desk.  I 
actually didn't notice it at first because Macky was in my room using 
the computer but then suddenly, we realized it was a cube.  Then, we 
realized it wasn't just a cube, but it was actually a solve state on 
the cube.

The hand writing is definitely from a girl but it could easily have 
been a guy's idea and they asked a girl to write it.  Still no idea who 
did it.  When I find out, I'll put a mug shot of them up or something.

    I practice my one-handed cubing while driving a lot. I have a 300 
mile round trip every weekend, so it gives me something to do on the 
road. People think I'm crazy, but it's not really that dangerous

    Yeah, it would be nice wouldn't it?  To have someone in love with me 
like that?  I went around doing some handwriting analysis.  My friend 
has a burned CD with a message written on it by a girl who lives very

    I do speedcubing while driving too but that is when at the traffic 
light stop. I scramble it and solve it before the traffic light 
turns green. It's a good practice for speed cubing...

the

Have you studied different algs for solving that state? Maybe there is

    Haha, that's brilliant! I love it!

I think the handwriting is definitely from a girl and the text is from 
a serious speedcuber. I don't want to insult the girls but experience 
shows that these don't go together very often. Also, in "i yearn for 
you like you a sub-fifteen" I think the second "you" is too much, 
right? That makes me think even more that the person inventing the 
text and the person just writing it weren't the same...

But even if it's a prank, don't give up hope! Maybe a girl is in love 
with you and asked a speedcuber to help her write a nice text for you 
and then she wrote it :-)

Hmm, but is that chocolate around the cube? Then you can eliminate 
most people who'd rather eat it than give it away.

Awaiting the conclusion... Cheers!

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The friends I knew from Duke said that Dan had a cube with him 
and

Hi Stefan, 

  The sentence form used by the writer is correct.

  English is structured where sometimes there are parts missing from a
text which are "understood" to be there. If you remove the second
"you" the sentence reads, "i yearn for you like a sub-fifteen" which
has a different meaning from, "i yearn for you like you [yearn for] a
sub-fifteen."

    Hmm!

So do SevenTowns decide what events there will be? I think WCA 
should decide that. Well, it's gonna be tricky to have events for 
puzzles that are not really "Rubiks" puzzles, like Megaminx or 
Square-1. But ideally we should also have those at WC 2005. 2x2x2 is 
also an official "Rubiks" puzzle. So that should not be a 
hindrance ...

Happy cubing ...

    Hey!

Im not really a "Fridrich" person so my opinion doens't count for 
much ;-) But the way i see it one should be equally comfortable with 
both. It's good to know ur algs from all angles so to speak, in 
order to minimise rotating the cube physically too much. Obviously 
there will be exceptions to this, like algs with lots of B turns. 
But most algs should be using U,R,F and L only, with a few D turns 
(when last layer is at top).

On 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 i try to minimise turning the whole cube. And 
when i do it's mostly to get a better lookahead.

    Hello everyone,

 

I have almost written all the notes for my Beginners Tutorial on solving
Rubik's Cube. While there are many decent webpages detailing expert
solutions, there are none which really give a detailed account for beginners
(apart from Jasmine's wonderful beginner page which was the inspiration for
this tutorial).

 

I would love it if a few of you could pretend to be beginners, or maybe some
real beginners will have a go too, and go through my solution and see if it
is readable. It was a lot of work making these notes, but I hope that they
will prove to be useful for beginners in the years to come :-) 

 

Like I said, they are almost complete, I have to add the finishing touches
still (there are always little things to change!)

 

You can find the notes at http://www.cubestation.co.uk

which says UEA Cube Club.

 

Cheers!

Ouch, I deserved that.  I should confess.  The 12.05 second solve was 
kind of prepared.  I had solved that cube in 13.98 seconds and it is my 
current personal best so I rescrambled it and gave it a few tries and 
then taped it so... yeah.  I lose.

Hello everyone,

 

I have almost written all the notes for my Beginners Tutorial on solving
Rubik's Cube. While there are many decent webpages detailing expert
solutions, there are none which really give a detailed account for beginners
(apart from Jasmine's wonderful beginner page which was the inspiration for
this tutorial).

 

I would love it if a few of you could pretend to be beginners, or maybe some
real beginners will have a go too, and go through my solution and see if it
is readable. It was a lot of work making these notes, but I hope that they
will prove to be useful for beginners in the years to come :-) 

 

Like I said, they are almost complete, I have to add the finishing touches
still (there are always little things to change!)

 

You can find the notes at http://www.cubestation.co.uk
&lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/&gt;  and click on the Link in the red panel
which says UEA Cube Club.

 

Cheers!

    In case anyone hasn't noticed, www.rubiks.dk is back up, though still 
under construction. Unfortunately one is not able to compare their 
times with other cubers any more due to having to clean up all the 
false entries from the old one. But once the new one is up it looks 
like it'll keep a more detailed cubelog for you. It's a great site, 
and I for one am very happy to see it back up.

Thanks Jess!

    In reality, since all the faces are just what we term them, any face 
turn is merely going to be preference, and not intrinsically what is 
easier.  For example, left-handed people tend to prefer algorithms 
with lots of Ls, where as righties prefer R moves.  For example, most 
of my solutions contain only R r U M moves, and only lefts when I 
need them, lefts are truly only (RM') or vice versa, so it all really 
depends on the frame of reference, and how you hold the cube.  An 
awkward turn often can be fixed, and be great, if you hold the cube 
from a slightly different angle.

I guess the point I'm getting at is that it is all very personal, and 
that everyone will have their own opinion of what is best.  And some 
algorithms work better for some people better than others.

Is there a cuber out there who wrote that they learned the Rubik's Cube 
at summer camp and that their roommate taught them and that they were 
really happy to get a time of 1 minute 39 seconds?  If you wrote that 
on a college application essay, I heard some good news about you.

&gt;
&gt; But even if it's a prank, don't give up hope! Maybe a girl is in love

&gt;
&gt; Hmm, but is that chocolate around the cube? Then you can eliminate

    Hi Eric and Marcia,

Please let me know if you have any questions about holding such an 
event.  If you would like, feel free to contact the Exploratorium 
Museum in San Francisco about their experience with us and the 
tournament on January 15, 2005.  I do not believe hosting an event like 
this would cost your museum any significant amount of money at all.  If 
you have a publicity department, a little bit of money into advertising 
the event would easily attract enough visitors to cover that cost.  
After the Exploratorium sent out a news letter, every local television 
news station aired information about the tournament and aired a few 
interviews with some of the competitors.  I am quite convinced that the 
increase in attendance from this event will easily pay for your 
expenses in advertising.  Furthermore, their gift shop easily sold out 
of Rubik's Cubes.  I myself was able to sell about $1000 worth of cube 
items at the tournament and I actually ran out of cubes to sell.

As for time, if your museum is able to handle the publicity and 
advertising, our club would virtually take care of everything else.  
Our only supplies needed for the tournament would be a few tables and 
outlets.  A form of amplified sound would be very helpful but is not 
necessary.  We would provide all the timers and other such supplies.

If you have any questions, please contact me.  If you would like 
another museum's point of view on this, please contact the 
Exploratorium in San Francisco.  Also, please keep me updated on the 
progress of this.  I had not received a reply in awhile and I thought 
that the idea had died and was starting to look at venues in Texas.

If you would like to see a Rubik's Cube tournament in action, we are 
hosting another one on April 16, 2005 at Caltech in Pasadena, 
California.  I doubt that you guys would have the time to come visit 
but I thought I would put the idea on the table.  Another tournament is 
currently in the works and is being planned for May 28th at the Horace 
Mann School.  Also, if you would like to speak to some experienced 
speed cubers in the area, I know a few people in New York who may be 
able to meet with you in person and show you exactly what things would 
look like.

ESPN also contacted me last July.  I think it may be possible to get 
the involved with a Rubik's Cube tournament if we had your museum as a 
venue.  The main contribution we would ask of the museum is just 
publicity.  Our club would be able to take care of virtually everything 
else.

&gt; &gt; you like you a sub-fifteen" I think the second "you" is too much,
&gt; &gt; right? That makes me think even more that the person inventing the
&gt; &gt; text and the person just writing it weren't the same...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But even if it's a prank, don't give up hope! Maybe a girl is in 
love
&gt; &gt; with you and asked a speedcuber to help her write a nice text for 
you
&gt; &gt; and then she wrote it :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hmm, but is that chocolate around the cube? Then you can eliminate
&gt; &gt; most people who'd rather eat it than give it away.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Awaiting the conclusion... Cheers!

    So... I actually borrowed a webcam but I have a mac... and it doesn't 
have the right driver.  Oh well.

Yeah, shortest orientation algorithm from that state to get to a 
z-permutation anyway?  I doubt the culprit put THAT much thought into 
it... it's already a very elaborate scheme.

&gt; Ouch, I deserved that.  I should confess.  The 12.05 second solve 
was 
&gt; kind of prepared.  I had solved that cube in 13.98 seconds and it 
is my

    Hey Wayne!

I think the "back up but under construction" means that now Jesse has 
his site up again but some parts, like the online timer aren¬¥t up and 
running yet. Still yesterday he only had a gray screen saying "come 
back later" ;)

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have almost written all the notes for my Beginners Tutorial on
solving
&gt; &gt; Rubik's Cube. While there are many decent webpages detailing expert
&gt; &gt; solutions, there are none which really give a detailed account for
beginners
&gt; &gt; (apart from Jasmine's wonderful beginner page which was the
inspiration for
&gt; &gt; this tutorial).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would love it if a few of you could pretend to be beginners, or
maybe some
&gt; &gt; real beginners will have a go too, and go through my solution and
see if it
&gt; &gt; is readable. It was a lot of work making these notes, but I hope
that they
&gt; &gt; will prove to be useful for beginners in the years to come :-) 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Like I said, they are almost complete, I have to add the finishing
touches
&gt; &gt; still (there are always little things to change!)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can find the notes at http://www.cubestation.co.uk

panel
&gt; &gt; which says UEA Cube Club.

    In an ideal world (sometimes in the future?), WCA will be a strong 
orgaisation which organises tournaments. However, as I understand 
it, WCA is at present only Tyson, Ron and Chris, and the main 
activities is to establish tournament rules and to maintain official 
world records and ranking lists.

It seems that it is SevenTowns that will organise WC2005, and take 
care of the costs... However, I am convinsed that they will listen 
to the Cube society. Is there any dialogue between WCA and 
SevenTowns about WC2005?

&gt; 
&gt; So do SevenTowns decide what events there will be? I think WCA 
&gt; should decide that. Well, it's gonna be tricky to have events for 
&gt; puzzles that are not really "Rubiks" puzzles, like Megaminx or 
&gt; Square-1. But ideally we should also have those at WC 2005. 2x2x2 
is 
&gt; also an official "Rubiks" puzzle. So that should not be a

    I believe our main activity is also to host tournaments.  I actually 
would like it very much of SevenTowns would let us handle the 
tournament competition details.  I haven't heard anything from them yet 
unfortunately.  I'm sure the WCA and SevenTowns could mutually come up 
with something that would promote and publicize the cube while 
maintaining the competition standards which we are all used to.

    Hi everyone,

I'm just catching up on the last couple of weeks of posts after a
mega-busy time at work. Looks like I've been missing lots of
interesting discussion about the meaning of life (42, obviously),
super-megaminxing, subculture, and eating dust!! ;)

A thread that I found particularly interesting is the one about
Tyson's secret admirer!! I gather this remains a mystery?? Maybe
speedcubing is a way to get a girl's attention?

This reminds me, I recently watched the first episode of Matt
LeBlanc's new show, Joey (it's just started airing in the UK where
I've recently moved). I wasn't planning to watch it, but after someone
in this group said there was a speedcubing reference, I knew I had
too. It cracked me up. Maybe Joey is wrong and in fact speedcubing can
be an interesting topic to talk to girls about!

And speaking of cubing and romance, congrats to Frank and Christy on
their engagment! :) Maybe one day my fiance Peter will learn the cube.
BTW, yes, it's still 'fiance' as we still haven't managed to organise
to get married yet. It's been a very long engagement!

than if you're looking for a really good speedcube.  If you want a

    Yes, okay, and the plot thickens.  Okay, so to recap to everyone...

Monday (Valentine's Day):  Chocolate tiled cube with dirty 
cube-innuendo sonnet is left on my desk.

Tuesday:  I step out of my room for 10 minutes and walk two doors down 
the hall to do some homework.  I left the door open and when I came 
back, a yellow rose was left on my desk.

Wednesday morning:  I was up until about 5 AM doing work and when I 
woke up, a neat pile of four chocolates (the same chocolates that were 
used as tiles) was placed outside of my door under a piece of paper 
with the word "Tyson" printed on it.  Also there was another pile of 
four chocolates under a piece of paper that said "Macky".  Mark 
Polinkovsky who lives next to me was also hit with a pile of four 
chocolates and so was Jordan, the guy who lives two doors down and 
who's room I was in on Tuesday.

Also hit with chocolates were Leyan Lo (current American blindfold and 
3x3x3 single solve record holder).  That was amazing because he lives 
actually quite far away in relation to the main student housing 
complex.  Also Mithun Diwakar (frequent cube judge), and three other 
people that I can think of right now.

I'm a bit creeped out.

    Just thought I'd say hi all.  I'm new around here, but not to cubing-
-been doing it since I was a kid in the 80s [I'm 35 now].  Great to 
see so many others out there--I thought it had totally died; but 
there seems to be a strong resurgence in interest.  I hadn't picked 
one up in years, but we moved to Idaho from California a couple of 
years ago and stumbled across on old cube unpacking, and i'm 
addicted again.  

My times are about a minute now, so I'm not going to break anyone's 
records soon, but I've only memorized about half of the Fridrich 
method algs.  Hopefully I can get it down under 30 seconds this 
year.  My old method was pretty simple to learn but took about 150 
moves [I used to do it top corners first, then top edges, middle 
layer edges, permute bottom corners, orient bottom corners, permute 
&amp; orient bottom edges.]  

I definitely cube while driving [only at stop lights, of course], 
and while flying or waiting at airports or talking on the phone.  
Anyone got suggestions on how to dampen the noise?  will good lube 
help?  I've used some silicon spray, but I'm probably not applying 
it right or not enough...

Never thought of doing it in the shower--won't the stickers peel off?

I'm also in the market for a new cube--any other comments on where 
to get good cubes?

Tyson's valentine's gift/poem was about the funniest thing cube 
related I've ever read.  The author should definitely fess up, 
whoever it was.

best regards, 
Kirk

    I use a DIY from Rubiks.com ...it's really great.  I have never had 
a pop with it (yet) and it moves faster than any other cube I've

&gt; im currently looking to buy a Studio Rubik's cube...but i have no

&gt; on how to get my hands on it. my friend sent an enamil to Ton (from

&gt; anything back from him yet. does anyone have any info on how to 
buy a
&gt; Studio Rubik's cube without using ebay?? (i already tried ebay but
&gt; none available!!)
&gt; *im currently planning to attend the April competition at Caltech
&gt; (hope this info helps..because i was wondering if i could buy one 
at
&gt; the competition..lol)
&gt; 
&gt; if its impossible for me to get the studio cube i was thinking 
about
&gt; buying one off ebay that was made in  hungary durring the 1980s by
&gt; ideal. but most of the cubes on sale are used and are in bad
&gt; condition...soo i dont want to take any chances of spending more 
money
&gt; on a bad cube that i cant speedcube with.
&gt; 
&gt; if anyone has a better suggestion for buying the "perfect"
&gt; cube...please reply here
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance!~
&gt; 
&gt; p.s. i dont want to spend over 40-50 dollars on it :P

    Hey everyone,

I've been wanting to make a site like this for quite some time.  I
still have a lot more work to do on it, but I have graphics and things
ready for the 3 main types of algorithm conversions.

http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/algconversion.html

Basically this site is just a couple tutorials on how to reflect
algorithms, invert and also reflect, etc. in your head without writing
anything down.

When learning new algs I personally don't consider the reflections of
algorithms as separate cases, as I'm used to doing this type of alg
transposing in my head.

So anyway those of you who are musicians can treat this site like a
tutorial on how to transpose, only for the cube.  Those who aren't
musicians can use this tutorial to make learning new algs easier,
especially reflections.

Like I said I've been wanting to make a site like this for a long
time, so there is still a lot more to come.  Also if anyone actually
uses and/or finds these tutorials interesting, please let me know.

I personally do these types of conversions all the time, and thought
it would be useful to make an easy tutorial on how to do it.

Let me know what you think,
Chris

Thanks a lot for that one Chris! I¬¥m using the Petrus method but I 
have the cube orientated in a different way than Lars has and I¬¥ve had 
a hard time to convert the algs sometime. And now when I read it from 
your tutorial it¬¥s all so easy and obvious.

Your site will make my life a bit easier =D

&gt; 
&gt; Tuesday:  I step out of my room for 10 minutes and walk two doors 
down

came

I 
&gt; woke up, a neat pile of four chocolates (the same chocolates that 
were

paper 
&gt; with the word "Tyson" printed on it.  Also there was another pile 
of 
&gt; four chocolates under a piece of paper that said "Macky".  Mark

&gt; chocolates and so was Jordan, the guy who lives two doors down and 
&gt; who's room I was in on Tuesday.
&gt; 
&gt; Also hit with chocolates were Leyan Lo (current American blindfold 
and

lives

    I'm trying to lower my solve times and am currently focusing on the 
number of moves I'm performing while solving. Currently I'm averaging 
75 moves (44 moves for F2L and 31 moves for LL). I know that 
memorizing more of the LL algorithms could lower my LL moves from 30 
down to around 18 or so, but am having a hard time lowing my moves on 
the F2Ls.

My current goal is to average 30 seconds a solve and am currently 
averaging 60 seconds.

The method I currently use constists of 10 steps
1. create 1x1x3 (~4 moves)
2. expand to 1x2x3 (~6 moves)
3. expand to 2x2x3 (~7 moves)
4. Orient and position one edge and corner (~7 moves)
5. Orient and position one edge (~7 moves)
6. Flip bad edges (~6 moves)
7. Orient and position one edge and corner (~7 moves) [finishing F2L]
8. Position corners (~7 moves)
9. Orient corners (~15 moves)
10. Position and Place edges (~9 moves)

Also, any tips on learning finger tricks to speed up moves/seconds 
would be apprecieated as well.

swapping step 8 and 9 would give two moves less.

    Hey Everyone,

The Science Place in Dallas, Texas wants to host our tournament!

http://www.scienceplace.org/

If you live in Texas or think you might want to attend this tournament, 
I would recommend joining the Caltech Rubik's Yahoo group at this link 
here:

http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/caltechrubiks/

It's where we do our discussion.  Also, if you live in Texas, I will 
need one or two people to nobly sacrifice themselves.  I need one or 
two people who lives near Dallas... I need someone who is willing to 
attend the tournament, not compete, and help me completely in running 
the tournament.  We were short staffed in San Francisco with 4 
full-time tournament staff so please let me know if you're willing to 
help me out.

I need people to understand that these tournaments are possible because 
many of my friends at Caltech are not very competitive speed cubers and 
are willing to sacrifice a competition experience in order to host and 
run the tournament for your competition experience.  I just need a few 
people to help out this time as I don't believe I can take another team 
of 5 down to Dallas as I did to San Francisco.

on the cube as you are looking for three groups of two peices. 
usually in 8-12 moves a 2x2x2 is made and the rest of the cube can be 
veiwed from one angle. imho

    Thanks for the response.

I think I made a mistake in my original post. It looks like I do 
place the corners on the LL before I orient them.

Guess I'll practice a bit more until I can solve smoothly, then look 
into other solving methods.

One thing I did notices that struck me as odd... When I'm scrambling 
the cube I'm prerforming finger tricks I never knew I could do. Now 
if I can only integrate them into my solves I'll be a happy camper.

    Hi everybody,

I gave my website a pretty big update a few minutes ago. It's 
the 'Part 2' of the beginners solution. The beginners solution 
wasn't build for speed, so this new section explains some moves to 
speed up the solution, without memorzing too much algs. Can some of 
you take a look at it and give me feedback about this? The last time 
I asked this, I got some pretty usefull reactions.

Thanks!

&gt; Personally i aim for a 2x2x2 this is easy to loacte in you scan 
time 
&gt; on the cube as you are looking for three groups of two peices. 
&gt; usually in 8-12 moves a 2x2x2 is made and the rest of the cube can 
be 
&gt; veiwed from one angle. imho

You could be right. I originally used a corners first method and the 
1x1x3 was an easier way to start then forming a 2x2x2. Looking at 
Lar's site, forming a 2x2x2 usually takes 10-14 moves, while I'm 
averaging 18. 

Hmm...

I also don't look for the most advantages color combinations. :( 
Guess I need to learn my cube better.

    Hi Folks,
On Sunday morning (February 20th), two of my students will be
featured on a news show (called CBS 2 News Sunday) here in the US.
The segment will be on at about 7:55AM (Eastern Standard Time) on
CBS. I believe the show is broadcast nationally. The students'
names are Krishanu Sankar and Kamran Jehle. I'll be on the program
as well.

    Hey, I just got my cube on Sunday and can solve it in about two and a
half minutes in a layer-by-layer method.  I recently got the hang of
the F2L method and am looking into memorizing those LL Algorithms...

But how?

What is the best way, from your experiences?  Do you use flashcards? 
Nicknaming methods (which worked for F2L)?

Is there any site?

Keep in mind that I am a quick memorizer, but I just need a methid. 
What is a good one to use to memorize those LL Fridrich Algorithms?

    Welcome to the group! I'm a speedcuber from northern Idaho, and Frank
Morris who also posts here lives in Boise (I think).
A lubrication will help the noise, and make it easier to turn. I (and
most people in this group) recommend silicon spray, you can get it at
Wal*Mart or any auto supplies store. I use the SNAP brand, and it
works well.
I wouldn't recommend using the cube in the shower, unless you have a
cube devoted to it. it'll wash off any lube that you have on it, and
make the stickers peel a little bit.
You can order a quality speedcube from Rubiks.com, or you can get a
Studio Cube which is often said to be the best for speedcubing from
Ton Dennenbroek: speedcubing.com/ton
but they take quite some work to get them into top condition, and are
more expensive. I'd recommend a Rubiks.com cube.

&gt; Just thought I'd say hi all.  I'm new around here, but not to cubing-
&gt; -been doing it since I was a kid in the 80s [I'm 35 now].  Great to 
&gt; see so many others out there--I thought it had totally died; but 
&gt; there seems to be a strong resurgence in interest.  I hadn't picked 
&gt; one up in years, but we moved to Idaho from California a couple of 
&gt; years ago and stumbled across on old cube unpacking, and i'm 
&gt; addicted again.  
&gt; 
&gt; My times are about a minute now, so I'm not going to break anyone's 
&gt; records soon, but I've only memorized about half of the Fridrich 
&gt; method algs.  Hopefully I can get it down under 30 seconds this 
&gt; year.  My old method was pretty simple to learn but took about 150 
&gt; moves [I used to do it top corners first, then top edges, middle 
&gt; layer edges, permute bottom corners, orient bottom corners, permute 
&gt; &amp; orient bottom edges.]  
&gt; 
&gt; I definitely cube while driving [only at stop lights, of course], 
&gt; and while flying or waiting at airports or talking on the phone.  
&gt; Anyone got suggestions on how to dampen the noise?  will good lube 
&gt; help?  I've used some silicon spray, but I'm probably not applying 
&gt; it right or not enough...
&gt; 
&gt; Never thought of doing it in the shower--won't the stickers peel off?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm also in the market for a new cube--any other comments on where 
&gt; to get good cubes?
&gt; 
&gt; Tyson's valentine's gift/poem was about the funniest thing cube 
&gt; related I've ever read.  The author should definitely fess up, 
&gt; whoever it was.

    I noticed that it really peels on the side where you do your initial

Eh...I just got my cube a few days ago and the white side is already
completely off :(

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm just catching up on the last couple of weeks of posts after a
&gt; mega-busy time at work. Looks like I've been missing lots of
&gt; interesting discussion about the meaning of life (42, obviously),
&gt; super-megaminxing, subculture, and eating dust!! ;)
&gt; 
&gt; A thread that I found particularly interesting is the one about
&gt; Tyson's secret admirer!! I gather this remains a mystery?? Maybe
&gt; speedcubing is a way to get a girl's attention?
&gt; 
&gt; This reminds me, I recently watched the first episode of Matt
&gt; LeBlanc's new show, Joey (it's just started airing in the UK where
&gt; I've recently moved). I wasn't planning to watch it, but after someone
&gt; in this group said there was a speedcubing reference, I knew I had
&gt; too. It cracked me up. Maybe Joey is wrong and in fact speedcubing can
&gt; be an interesting topic to talk to girls about!
&gt; 
&gt; And speaking of cubing and romance, congrats to Frank and Christy on
&gt; their engagment! :) Maybe one day my fiance Peter will learn the cube.
&gt; BTW, yes, it's still 'fiance' as we still haven't managed to organise
&gt; to get married yet. It's been a very long engagement!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything back from him yet. does anyone have any info on how 
&gt; &gt; to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; buy a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Studio Rubik's cube without using ebay?? (i already tried 
&gt; ebay 
&gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; none available!!)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *im currently planning to attend the April competition at

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if its impossible for me to get the studio cube i was

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about

&gt; &gt; 1980s by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ideal. but most of the cubes on sale are used and are in bad
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; condition...soo i dont want to take any chances of spending 
&gt; &gt; more 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; money
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on a bad cube that i cant speedcube with.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if anyone has a better suggestion for buying the "perfect"

    hey again
i would love to get my hands on the "famous" timer that all the
hardcore cubers use! the one that could be seen used by Jessica
Fridrich, Tyson Mao...and the rest of the gang. hopefully thats enough
info..(if thats not enough... the timer has a countdown with sound and
to stop it you press the press bar..and it also has the algorithms for
scrambling)

Thanks in advance!~

p.s-in one of the Tyson Mao's videos i tried to zoom in on the timer's
name but it was too blurry..lol!

    I made of practice sheet of the inverse of all of the LL algorithms 
that will create each orientation and permutation.  I numbered them 
and did them over and over until I learned each one.  I would mark 
them off after I had learned one. Hope this helps.

    Hey there!

This is how i memorized the LL algs. First, i think that someone
should learn first PLL then OLL.

For memorizing PLL/OLL as a whole, i would recomend doing it one alg
at a time. Start with case #1, and learn it. Then, when you have
succesfully added it to your archive of algs (when you can recognise
it and perform it at full speed from a random solve) then add another
alg to the archive, un till you have all the algs.

Now, for memorising the individual algs, I find the Java applets
spread on the web to be very usefull. I follow along one move at a
time, and watch the video for finger ticks. Then, i get to wherei can
do it without looking, and i just keep on doing it over and over again.

I would be interested in learning how other people do it!

    The best way for me to learn them was to just try to figure all of the 
F2L algs out for myself.  Not only is it easier to learn all 40+ algs, 
you don't have to bother with learning them from different sides of the 
cube.  Most algorithms are only a few moves different anyway, generally 
a few setup moves, and a 3-move alg to put the pair into place (R Ux R' 
and its mirror).

    Whenever I get a cube, before I start speedcubing on it, I always put regular permanent scotch tape over all the facelets - that is, 54 pieces of tape over the 54 facelets.  The pieces of tape don't have to be perfectly square because any excess that hangs over is trimmed off by speedcubing.  The tape really does a good job in protecting the colors, and for all the cubes I've done this to, all of the stickers have remained intact.  And I've never had to reapply the tape either.

been kind of a quirky thing I do, and I have rarely actually met 
someone else who can do it at all, certainly never actually met 
anyone faster than me [though I've seen plenty of videos to convince 
me I'm pretty slow at roughly a minute, but I'm working on that...]  
I can count on one hand the number of people I've ever met who can 
actually do it.  That's why I was surprised to see so many and such 
an active online community.  Guess I've been living under a rock in 
that regard.

Speaking of other Idaho cubers, I saw Frank Morris on the news a 
couple of months ago.  Also read on speedcubing.com he just set a 
new unofficial record on the 5x5x5 with an ave. time of 2 min 17 
secs.  Truly impressive.  So I knew there was at least one other in 
the state.  glad to know there are a few more.

btw, I saw some posts about what cubers have in common, and gather 
most or at least a large percentage are in programming.  I started 
college as a math/science geek, but ended up majoring in ancient 
Greek and Latin, which is about as far removed from programming as 
you can get. (Of course that degree provided rather limited job 
opportunities, so I went to law school and now run a fee-only 
comprehensive wealth management firm).  Curious if many other non-
math/science majors are into cubing?

thanks for the welcome.
best regards, 
Kirk

Just broke down and bought a new cube at the store as my stickers on 
the old one are totally peeling off.  I'll give the lube another try 
on this one.  thanks for the tips.  What I have is probably not the 
best, but it will have to do until I can get a better one...

&gt; A lubrication will help the noise, and make it easier to turn. I

at
&gt; Wal*Mart or any auto supplies store. I use the SNAP brand, and it

&gt; I wouldn't recommend using the cube in the shower, unless you have 
a

&gt; You can order a quality speedcube from Rubiks.com, or you can get a
&gt; Studio Cube which is often said to be the best for speedcubing from
&gt; Ton Dennenbroek: speedcubing.com/ton
&gt; but they take quite some work to get them into top condition, and 
are
&gt; more expensive. I'd recommend a Rubiks.com cube.

&gt; &gt; there seems to be a strong resurgence in interest.  I hadn't

&gt; &gt; My times are about a minute now, so I'm not going to break 
anyone's 
&gt; &gt; records soon, but I've only memorized about half of the Fridrich 
&gt; &gt; method algs.  Hopefully I can get it down under 30 seconds this 
&gt; &gt; year.  My old method was pretty simple to learn but took about 
150 
&gt; &gt; moves [I used to do it top corners first, then top edges, middle 
&gt; &gt; layer edges, permute bottom corners, orient bottom corners, 
permute 
&gt; &gt; &amp; orient bottom edges.]  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I definitely cube while driving [only at stop lights, of 
course], 
&gt; &gt; and while flying or waiting at airports or talking on the 
phone.  
&gt; &gt; Anyone got suggestions on how to dampen the noise?  will good 
lube 
&gt; &gt; help?  I've used some silicon spray, but I'm probably not 
applying 
&gt; &gt; it right or not enough...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Never thought of doing it in the shower--won't the stickers peel

    Hehe

personally, i think a good method is to do the f2l
intuitively after you get the hang of the algs for
f2l.

for last layer OLL i just learn the ones that seems to
occur often when i solve. maybe its just me but i get
more of the L shaped olls most of the time.

so the thing is i learn the oll "as they occur". if
they keep coming back i make up my mind to learn it
anyways.

happy cubing!

    I'm still learning some of the algs myself--haven't seen the java 
applets, but that sounds like it would help a lot.  I've seen some 
sites with videos showing slowly how to do some of the PLL or OLL 
algs, and that's helped me quite a bit.  It's not just knowing which 
face to turn, but which moves to blend together to make it faster 
and which fingers to use, etc.  that kind of thing speeds up the 
learning process for me.  

I've also printed out a cheat sheet and check them off as I learn 
them.  To make sure I can remember them, I start with a solved cube, 
then do each alg several times.  works great during commercials... 
Actually, i have 2 cheat sheets--a short one with just one version 
of each alg, another with inverses and from different angles.  I'll 
try to learn one of each first.  And now when I solve the cube, if I 
don't know an alg for a situtation, I either look at my cheat sheet 
or more often just practice 2 of the ones I do know.

&gt; Hey there!
&gt; 
&gt; This is how i memorized the LL algs. First, i think that someone
&gt; should learn first PLL then OLL.
&gt; 
&gt; For memorizing PLL/OLL as a whole, i would recomend doing it one 
alg
&gt; at a time. Start with case #1, and learn it. Then, when you have
&gt; succesfully added it to your archive of algs (when you can 
recognise
&gt; it and perform it at full speed from a random solve) then add 
another
&gt; alg to the archive, un till you have all the algs.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, for memorising the individual algs, I find the Java applets
&gt; spread on the web to be very usefull. I follow along one move at a
&gt; time, and watch the video for finger ticks. Then, i get to wherei 
can
&gt; do it without looking, and i just keep on doing it over and over 
again.
&gt; 
&gt; I would be interested in learning how other people do it!

    Yeah, has anyone noticed that the new cubes have a more "fast" design?
 It's as if they were lighter, or already come partly lubricated.  I
think that the pieces are made out of some lighter plastic or something.

    Hey,

One thing that helps me when learning new algs is never to time
myself.  I personally really enjoy taking averages, so when I'm
learning new algs I force myself to not time myself at all.  This
helps motivate me to learn the algs quickly and not beat around the
bush and take my time.  If you enjoy cubing and timing yourself I
would recommend this strategy.  It stinks while you're learning, but
trust me - it is much more fun to speedsolve using a 3-look or 2-look
last layer than it is to solve with a 4-look.  The payoff will be
worth the time spent learning and not speedcubing.

Also by not timing I mean only that.  It helps to constantly practice
speedcubing, to make sure you can recognize the new algs quickly. 
Only don't time yourself when you do.

    Oh, yeah. I am not a fan of using Algorithms when "common sense" can
take care of it.  I don't ever use Algorithms for the F2L, except for
the ones I aptly name, ie "R2D2" (two connected corner/middle edge
with aligning sides upwards) and "Cycle" (It's basically R'B'L', and
it's really fun to do :) )

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;What is the best way, from your experiences?  Do
&gt; &gt; you use 
&gt; &gt; flashcards? 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Nicknaming methods (which worked for F2L)?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Is there any site?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Keep in mind that I am a quick memorizer, but I
&gt; &gt; just need a 
&gt; &gt; methid. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;What is a good one to use to memorize those LL
&gt; &gt; Fridrich 
&gt; &gt; Algorithms?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

    Yeah, I really hate it when the cube gets "stuck" when I try to turn
it.  But I think that after lubricating it or stretching out the edge
pieces enough it goes away.

    Hey Kirk. I was wondering the same thing about the major issue. I 
currently go to school at the University of Minnesota, Duluth branch. 
Looks like I did pretty much the same thing as you so far. I was a 
math major, but that didn't pan out for me too well once I reached 
upper level classes... I've since bumped mathematics down to a minor 
and will graduate with a lowly, ancient History major :) I love it, 
but yeah, not a lot of job opportunities.

I haven't any cubers around here either. I don't recall seeing any 
other Minnesota cubers in Dan Harris's profile section. I average in 
around 41, 42 seconds. Any other Minnesota cubers out there?


&gt; Hey Crispy, 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in Eagle [suburban Boise].  where are you?  do any of the Idaho 
&gt; cubers ever get together?  I know my times could probably benefit 
&gt; from some live tips and tricks, and it would be interesting to 
&gt; actually meet someone else who is into cubing.  Cubing has always 
&gt; been kind of a quirky thing I do, and I have rarely actually met 
&gt; someone else who can do it at all, certainly never actually met 
&gt; anyone faster than me [though I've seen plenty of videos to 
convince 
&gt; me I'm pretty slow at roughly a minute, but I'm working on 
that...]  
&gt; I can count on one hand the number of people I've ever met who can 
&gt; actually do it.  That's why I was surprised to see so many and such 
&gt; an active online community.  Guess I've been living under a rock in 
&gt; that regard.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of other Idaho cubers, I saw Frank Morris on the news a 
&gt; couple of months ago.  Also read on speedcubing.com he just set a 
&gt; new unofficial record on the 5x5x5 with an ave. time of 2 min 17 
&gt; secs.  Truly impressive.  So I knew there was at least one other in 
&gt; the state.  glad to know there are a few more.
&gt; 
&gt; btw, I saw some posts about what cubers have in common, and gather 
&gt; most or at least a large percentage are in programming.  I started 
&gt; college as a math/science geek, but ended up majoring in ancient 
&gt; Greek and Latin, which is about as far removed from programming as 
&gt; you can get. (Of course that degree provided rather limited job 
&gt; opportunities, so I went to law school and now run a fee-only 
&gt; comprehensive wealth management firm).  Curious if many other non-
&gt; math/science majors are into cubing?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for the welcome.
&gt; best regards, 
&gt; Kirk

I currently use Chris Hunt's Java NetCube Timer.  In some of Jessica's 
videos, she's using Jess Bonde's Internet Explorer Timer.  Chris Hunt's 
timer has more options and plus, you can do net cube!

    Yeah, I took O-chem as a freshman and it was probably too much for 
me at that age, and definitely too much lab work for my taste.  Math 
always interested me, but not enough to major.  Ancient studies and 
languages, though, were as addictive as the cube for me.  I first 
took a Latin class on a whim, thought I might go to medical school 
and perhaps the language would come in handy there, and after one 
semester basically dropped all the other stuff and focused on 
classics.  Ironically, those classes were harder for me than my 
math/science classes.  But I knew by doing that I'd have to look 
into law school or business school after undergrad--there definitely 
were no job opportunities for me anyway, other than in acadamia.  
I've found a great niche in the financial services industry that 
fits my personality and skill set.  Helping people with taxes, 
investments, retirement planning, estate planning, etc. is very much 
a puzzle.  anyway, it's another area to look into as you figure out 
where to go after U of M.

    Technically, I'm not a Minnesotan, as I live in Iowa, but I make it up to the Twin Cities most weekends.  My girlfriend, whom I taugh and who is now starting a cube craze at her school, lives in a suburb.  There are probably upwards of 15 people cubing at her school, all but 2 or 3 who have started in the past two weeks.  I know Rommy Barghout (sp?) is from the cities, too, and we met at the Midwest competition.  Hopefully we can convince the wonderful Mr. Rueth to organize a tournament up there soon.

&gt; &gt; from some live tips and tricks, and it would be interesting to 
&gt; &gt; actually meet someone else who is into cubing.  Cubing has 
always 
&gt; &gt; been kind of a quirky thing I do, and I have rarely actually met 
&gt; &gt; someone else who can do it at all, certainly never actually met 
&gt; &gt; anyone faster than me [though I've seen plenty of videos to 
&gt; convince 
&gt; &gt; me I'm pretty slow at roughly a minute, but I'm working on 
&gt; that...]  
&gt; &gt; I can count on one hand the number of people I've ever met who 
can 
&gt; &gt; actually do it.  That's why I was surprised to see so many and 
such 
&gt; &gt; an active online community.  Guess I've been living under a rock 
in 
&gt; &gt; that regard.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Speaking of other Idaho cubers, I saw Frank Morris on the news a 
&gt; &gt; couple of months ago.  Also read on speedcubing.com he just set 
a 
&gt; &gt; new unofficial record on the 5x5x5 with an ave. time of 2 min 17 
&gt; &gt; secs.  Truly impressive.  So I knew there was at least one other 
in 
&gt; &gt; the state.  glad to know there are a few more.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; btw, I saw some posts about what cubers have in common, and 
gather 
&gt; &gt; most or at least a large percentage are in programming.  I 
started 
&gt; &gt; college as a math/science geek, but ended up majoring in ancient 
&gt; &gt; Greek and Latin, which is about as far removed from programming 
as 
&gt; &gt; you can get. (Of course that degree provided rather limited job 
&gt; &gt; opportunities, so I went to law school and now run a fee-only 
&gt; &gt; comprehensive wealth management firm).  Curious if many other 
non-
&gt; &gt; math/science majors are into cubing?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; thanks for the welcome.
&gt; &gt; best regards, 
&gt; &gt; Kirk

Great to hear of cubers who share in my other passions: I study 
Latin, ancient Greek and ancient philosophy (Epicureanism).  Though 
doubtless programming is MUCH more commmon among cubers I feel that 
the analytical side of philosophy and Latin syntax is a skill which 
directly transfers over to cubing - both blind and speed.

Now if you guys also play rugby that would be a real trifecta!

I am currently teaching at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg so 
I would probably be able to make it down to Minnesota if there were 
to be a cuber gathering there.

    Hi :-)

Yes it's allowed to have customised colors on each face. Each face 
must have a distinct color different from the colors on the other 
faces. That's all!

    Hey everyone,

All this talk about university majors, careers, programming, etc. got
me curious.

We seem to think that "a majority" of cubers are programmers, that we
are "predominantly" math minded, etc..

However I don't think there has ever been a study.

Anyway, I started a new table in the "database" section on the menu on
your left.  The list contains an entry for your university major(s) as
well as your career if you are post university study.

If you aren't yet at university there is also a field for area(s) of
academic interest, as well as a potential or proposed major field.

Again this is partly for my own curiosity, and partly for the fact
that I don't think a study has ever been done.

So would everyone please take a moment to fill out the table?  It
would only take a few seconds, maybe a minute at most.  You don't have
to give your name or e-mail or anything, just your
major/career/academic interests/ etc..

Thanks,
Chris

    Having said that we had a discussion last year on a ruling that painted
cubes would not automatically be allowed - the local tournament director
would rule on each individual case.  For those who still have problems with
stickers, coloured nail varnish is a fantastic substitute which is very
durable and comes in lots of different colours!

The reason for the ruling on painted cubes was that "badly" painted cubes
can give an advantage to the solver (which makes more sense that it seems at
first sight)!  Problem is that if your cube is ruled illegal and you have to
switch to another cube it may have a different colour scheme.  Disaster!

    Ok, I added a name field as well.

So far the fields are

Name
University major
potential major if unsure
career if post university
academic interests (if not at university or also in general)
other interests

If there are more that people would like to see let me know and I can
add those too.

    Hi Chris,

This will be interesting!

I just had a look at the database and so far there are *zero* entries
which do not contain the words 'maths', 'engineering', 'computer' or
'IT'. What a surprise!! :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; well as your career if you are post university study.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you aren't yet at university there is also a field for area(s) of
&gt; &gt; &gt; academic interest, as well as a potential or proposed major field.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Again this is partly for my own curiosity, and partly for the fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; that I don't think a study has ever been done.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; So would everyone please take a moment to fill out the table?  It
&gt; &gt; &gt; would only take a few seconds, maybe a minute at most.  You
don't have
&gt; &gt; &gt; to give your name or e-mail or anything, just your
&gt; &gt; &gt; major/career/academic interests/ etc..
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,

    This is cool, thank you everyone for posting on the database!  Also,
if you haven't posted yet, please post your information!  Afterward we
can run some numbers on it and figure out more concretely what cubers
are like in terms of some of the claims we've heard.

Remember, your name isn't required if you don't want to list it.  I'm
just curious of the percentages that are interested in certain things,
like computer programming, engineering, math, etc..

Of course this won't be a very significant sample out of all the
cubers, but it will be interesting nonetheless to see what comes of it.

Jasmine, I'm also somewhat surprised, I didn't think every single
entry would have at least one of the main things that people say are
"typical" of cubers.  It's still early though, and hopefully we'll see
some of the variety present in the cubing community.

That's because these things make you use the internet in general and 
this forum in particular more often. Also, you're more likely to

Just thought I'd say hi all.  I'm new around here, but not to cubing-

see so many others out there--I thought it had totally died; but 
there seems to be a strong resurgence in interest.  I hadn't picked 
one up in years, but we moved to Idaho from California a couple of 
years ago and stumbled across on old cube unpacking, and i'm 
addicted again.  

My times are about a minute now, so I'm not going to break anyone's 
records soon, but I've only memorized about half of the Fridrich 
method algs.  Hopefully I can get it down under 30 seconds this 
year.  My old method was pretty simple to learn but took about 150 
moves [I used to do it top corners first, then top edges, middle 
layer edges, permute bottom corners, orient bottom corners, permute 
&amp; orient bottom edges.]  

I definitely cube while driving [only at stop lights, of course], 
and while flying or waiting at airports or talking on the phone.  
Anyone got suggestions on how to dampen the noise?  will good lube 
help?  I've used some silicon spray, but I'm probably not applying 
it right or not enough...

Never thought of doing it in the shower--won't the stickers peel off?

I'm also in the market for a new cube--any other comments on where 
to get good cubes?

Tyson's valentine's gift/poem was about the funniest thing cube 
related I've ever read.  The author should definitely fess up, 
whoever it was.

    922. Unexpected competition tonight!

   <div class="email-content">
    So I'm sitting in my french class and this guy whom I hardly know 
says "You know they're having a rubik's cube competition tonight..."  
My backpack is covered in cube paraphernalia, and he's seen me do it 
a few times so no surprise he thought of me.  What shocked me was 
that my own college was putting on a Rubik's Cube tourny and I hadn't 
heard of it!  So I go to the website and the story is this.  The main 
thing tonight is called the B-cubed LAN party (lanparty.ou.edu). They 
had (and are still having) competitions in Counter-Strike, various 
Deathmatch games, etc.  But this one featured their first ever 
rubik's cube tournament!

Since the lan party (by definition) goes from evening to morning the 
next day, the cube competition was scheduled for midnight.  I showed 
up around 10:30 and milled about.  Having never been to a LAN party 
before, I was kind of at a loss, so I thought I'd cloister myself and 
warm up a bit.  One guy sees me and comes over.  He whips out his 
cube and we start talking.  Then the camera crew (two guys with a 
digicam) came and asked to interview the two of us.  It was pretty 
cool.

When the competition started, there were 5 people signed up.  They 
did took the average of your best 3 solves out of 4.  The timer was a 
stopwatch that the cuber had to start and stop on his own, no 
inspection time and the cubes were randomly scrambled by some guy to 
the left ;).  We had quite a crowd gather around, and a good natured 
competition ensued.  Three of the guys were doing times in the 1:00-
1:30 range, and one fellow steps up with times floating around 40s.  
When it gets to be my turn, I'm shaking quite a bit.  I've never 
competed, and I've never cubed in front of such a big time.  I was 
petrified of the "no inspection time" rule.  My first time was 
24.13s, but I when the cube hit the table, it rotated a quarter turn -
- my "bad" solve that wouldn't be averaged.  The next two times were 
between 24 and 24.5 and my final solve was 25.xx.  Sitting at home a 
25s average is really pretty good for me, but I was amazed that I got 
such awesome times (for me) with all the pressure.

All said, I won myself a 64MB MP3 player/flash drive, a cd case, and 
a bag full of stickers/pens/etc.  Not bad for the $10 entry fee (with 
free pizza and coke inside)!  More importantly I met 3 guys who 
really want to get together and cube.  We may have the formings of an 
OU rubik's cube club!

Anyway, I'm totally stoked and I had to share.  I gave the guys this 
website along with quite a few others, so maybe we'll see them on 
here sometime soon.  Can't wait for the Dallas tourney now!

I'm going to bed.
Daniel

It will be biased, because you address the cubers who have a computer,
who know the existence of this group, and who also have the will
to put their names in the database (i.e. they are interested in the
results of this). What would be the results of a poll on the right
margin of your website for which the question is :
"do you sometimes answer to polls on the right margins of websites ?"
(yeah I know, paradoxal people will click on 'no')

Well, if you had a column "knows the existence of the speed cubing
group" you would have 100% match.

Anyway, biased or not, this is an interesting database :-)

a great WC. Thus, I recommend that WCA contacts SevenTowns about 
tournament details.

    Would it be possible for the WCA to publish a standard for labelling cases
for OLL + PLL, so that everyone would use the same label each time for each
case?

 

Of course I am only asking for cases in the Fridrich system for now, but I
think a standard should be made for all systems, but Fridrich would be more
useful to me in the long-term. The reason for asking this is that when
people search for algorithms from different websites, Case (eg 14) on one
person's PLL webpage may be Case (eg 19) on someone elses. It would be
easier for anyone in the long run if everyone used the same labels for
particular cases. I realise that for some people this would mean that some
work would have to be put in to change webpages and so forth, but I really
do think it is worth it.

 

If this means that you would come up with a standard, or I would come up
with a standard, or even if you say we should use the labelling system used
on a particular site, as long as everyone ends up using the same thing, I
wouldn't mind.

    I've been learning the Petrus method and am not sure what the 
differences are between his and the Fridrich method when it comes 
the the last layer. Both methods seem to focus on doing F2L then LL. 

Are the PLL and OLL algorithms different between the two systems and 
if so why?

    I just realized this would only apply to the PLL cases.  True, we do
still need a standard way to talk about the OLL's as well.

    The only problem I have with this is that Jessica doesn't give all the
cases, she gives all the "distinct" OLL and PLL cases, so there would still
be no way to label the mirrored cases. I know you also don't give the
mirrors on your page, it always used to confuse me why some people would say
there are 57 OLL and others would say 40 odd :)

 

But if there was some way of including all 57 + 21 cases, then I would be
happy to go with it.

great to see another classicist.  couldn't agree more about 
similarity between skills needed in classics and the cube.  My wife 
was also a classicist and musician, but she's never been able to do 
the cube [hasn't tried too much, though].  I'm afraid I don't play

cubing-
&gt; -been doing it since I was a kid in the 80s [I'm 35 now].  Great 
to 
&gt; see so many others out there--I thought it had totally died; but 
&gt; there seems to be a strong resurgence in interest.  I hadn't 
picked 
&gt; one up in years, but we moved to Idaho from California a couple of 
&gt; years ago and stumbled across on old cube unpacking, and i'm 
&gt; addicted again.  
&gt; 
&gt; My times are about a minute now, so I'm not going to break 
anyone's 
&gt; records soon, but I've only memorized about half of the Fridrich 
&gt; method algs.  Hopefully I can get it down under 30 seconds this 
&gt; year.  My old method was pretty simple to learn but took about 150 
&gt; moves [I used to do it top corners first, then top edges, middle 
&gt; layer edges, permute bottom corners, orient bottom corners, 
permute 
&gt; &amp; orient bottom edges.]  
&gt; 
&gt; I definitely cube while driving [only at stop lights, of course], 
&gt; and while flying or waiting at airports or talking on the phone.  
&gt; Anyone got suggestions on how to dampen the noise?  will good lube 
&gt; help?  I've used some silicon spray, but I'm probably not applying 
&gt; it right or not enough...
&gt; 
&gt; Never thought of doing it in the shower--won't the stickers peel 
off?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm also in the market for a new cube--any other comments on where 
&gt; to get good cubes?
&gt; 
&gt; Tyson's valentine's gift/poem was about the funniest thing cube 
&gt; related I've ever read.  The author should definitely fess up,

&gt; A also agree with this, and as a standard for the
&gt; Fridrich method I
&gt; suggest Jessica Fridrich's labelling system.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think there should be any contest about
&gt; this, she *is* the one
&gt; who inveneted the method.
&gt; 
&gt; I can start re-labelling the cases on my page to
&gt; match hers, assuming
&gt; there is no disagreement over the labelling system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; case?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course I am only asking for cases in the
&gt; Fridrich system for now, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; but I
&gt; &gt; &gt; think a standard should be made for all systems,
&gt; but Fridrich
&gt; would be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; more
&gt; &gt; &gt; useful to me in the long-term. The reason for
&gt; asking this is that when
&gt; &gt; &gt; people search for algorithms from different
&gt; websites, Case (eg 14) on 
&gt; &gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; person's PLL webpage may be Case (eg 19) on
&gt; someone elses. It would be
&gt; &gt; &gt; easier for anyone in the long run if everyone
&gt; used the same labels for
&gt; &gt; &gt; particular cases. I realise that for some people
&gt; this would mean that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; some
&gt; &gt; &gt; work would have to be put in to change webpages
&gt; and so forth, but I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; really
&gt; &gt; &gt; do think it is worth it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If this means that you would come up with a
&gt; standard, or I would come 
&gt; &gt; &gt; up
&gt; &gt; &gt; with a standard, or even if you say we should
&gt; use the labelling
&gt; system 
&gt; &gt; &gt; used
&gt; &gt; &gt; on a particular site, as long as everyone ends
&gt; up using the same 
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn't mind.

    Hi all. I'm Jane and I've recently become addicted to the cube. :)

One major problem I have encountered is pieces popping from the 
cube. This is way too common for me so I'd like to know how I can 
fix this problem.

I used DIY kits from rubik's. If I tighten the cube anymore, it will 
defeat the purpose of a "speedcube." But regardless of how much I 
tighten it, it still pops frequently. I have lubed my cube with 
silicone.

Sorry for explaining my situation very vaguely, but can anyone just 
give me a few general tips on how I can treat this problem?

Thanks

    Jane,
  Welcome to the group!  And may your newfound addiction be an 
asset... because addiction is the right word.
  I use a studio cube, and when I first got it it popped all the 
time.  Honestly, all I did was keep using it.  I eventually got to 
the point where I could turn it and have maybe 1 pop in 20 solves.  
My girlfriend, on the other hand, looks at it from across the room 
and it explodes.  Working with it and knowing when you can turn what 
will help a lot.  Beyond that, I don't have much advice and will 
defer to the various spin doctors (I made a pun) on the boards.

Great to have you with us!

Hi and welcome Jane!

You did something wrong :-) These cube are pretty much impossible to 
pop. We're speaking about the ones with the arched centers (i.e. 
round, not flat bottoms of the center cubies), right?

Can you take out all edges and corners and pull on each center as much 
as possible and tell us how far each center can be pulled away? It 
should be about 1-1.5mm, not more. And they should all be as equal as 
possible. How about your centers?

Cheers!
Stefan

    How about using the letters for PLL that I already have on the page? 
If you need to distinguish between mirror and inverse algorithms, 
why not appending a symbol to the letter, such as "m" and "i"?

As far as the OLL is concerned, we can go a similar way. I think 
that we should somehow use visual clues so that it is easier to 
remember. For example, we can have OLL named C, H, I, T, O, L, S, V, 
etc., again with appropriate "m" for mirror positions. Of course, 
there would be four I's that we would have to somehow distinguish,

    I use Jessica's letter to denote the pattern (with m and ') and Peter J. (at
speedcubing.com) to denote the number for the PLL case. I think that would
pretty much be the standard...

For the OLL, hmm, I have no specific standard to propose; maybe Lars Petrus
cases for all the edges oriented correctly should be set. Or Dan Harris way
to represent the patterns like for instance "T-shapes" T1, T2, "Fish-shape",
F1-F4 etc should be set. I like both but they interfere...

    &gt; i would love to get my hands on the "famous" timer that all the
&gt; hardcore cubers use! the one that could be seen used by Jessica
&gt; Fridrich, Tyson Mao...and the rest of the gang. hopefully thats enough
&gt; info..(if thats not enough... the timer has a countdown with sound and
&gt; to stop it you press the press bar..and it also has the algorithms for
&gt; scrambling)
I don't know what famous timer is used by them. All I know is that you're
describing almost every rubiks timer existing. Chris', Jess' and my rubik
timer all have sound, countdown and scrambling algs, so you'd have to be
more specific. I think Jess Bonde's timer is the oldest and probably the
most (in)famous. So go to http://rubiks.dk and see for yourself. Or go to
the files section to get Chris' NetCube and if you don't like anything
that's Java or JavaScript download my rubiktimer from the files section or
from http://rubiktimer.tk.

Here's a comparison analysis:

NetCube: online, offline, multiplayer, file log, session avg, countdown,
created with Java or VB (older version)
Rubiks.dk: online, offline, singleplayer, online log, session avg,
countdown, created with JavaScript or ASP (online version)
RubikTimerTalks: offline, singleplayer, file log, online log, day avg,
countdown, voice timer, created with VB and ASP (for logging)

BTW: Ron and Dan also wrote timers. They're probably in the files section
too.

Michiel


&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!~
&gt;
&gt; p.s-in one of the Tyson Mao's videos i tried to zoom in on the timer's
&gt; name but it was too blurry..lol!

&gt; &gt; Hi Mikael,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'd say it's definitely worth trying. I've been
&gt; &gt; playing with some 
&gt; &gt; ideas to solve the 4x4 differently than I do so
&gt; far
&gt; &gt; (which is 
&gt; &gt; centers/edges/3x3). I think it will be good for
&gt; &gt; recognition to do "3x3 
&gt; &gt; solving parts" not at the very end but instead
&gt; &gt; earlier (e.g. like you 
&gt; &gt; do) because this limits the number of possible
&gt; &gt; places that you have to 
&gt; &gt; look at to find pieces.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So try it and don't give up too easily! At the
&gt; very
&gt; &gt; least you'll learn 
&gt; &gt; something and you'll create something on your own,
&gt; &gt; which is very good 
&gt; &gt; in my opinion.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers!
&gt; &gt; Stefan

    Tyson, all I found in the official rules is this:

&lt;quote&gt;
Competitors can use any normal 6 color sticker scheme for cubes, as 
long as the cubes show 1 color per face in solved position. The colors 
of the cube must be solid and clearly distinct from one another. The 
cube must either have colored stickers or colored tiles.
&lt;/quote&gt;

What you just wrote looks a lot stricter than those rules. If it's 
supposed to be meant by "normal 6 color scheme" then I must say that's 
totally not clear. So far I was convinced any 6 colors are ok as long 
as they look different enough. 

Cheers!

    Hey!

I also use the Petrus method. Yes there is a differnce between the two 
methods LL. First of all with the Petrus method you always have the 
edges orientated right so you don¬¥t have to worry about them. If you 
follow the steps on Lars site you will use a 3-look LL, first you 
permute corners, then you orientate corners and last you permute 
edges.
Fridrich uses a 2-look LL. First you orientate all LL cubies, then you 
permute all. 

The Fridrich method might by a bit more effective but you need to 
memorize 57+21 algorithms to cover all possible situation whereas with 
Petrus method you can do with 3 to start with and by learning the 19 
(I think) algs he has named you can do LL with two looks.

    Hey Richard!

That seems almost exactly like the method I¬¥ve been thinking of! My 
two biggest problem is how to tackle the problem of keeping track of 
the cubies in the beginning and my very unefficient pair-up methods 
after finnishing the 3x4x3. I¬¥d love to hear how you pair up the last 
edgepairs.

    More to come, but here are my notes for trying to learn the method. 
So far I don't have very much, but of course the page just started.  I
have pictures and the algs I use listed for 2 additional ZBF2L cases
on there.  I highly recommend starting with the 9 on Lars' site first
http://www.cubezone.be/zbf2l.html since the algs he chose go together
extremely well.

Anyway, for those curious and/or learning:

    Hey Stefan,

Thanks a lot.  I forgot what I wrote as the official rules.  Well, I 
wrote, "We request." as in  I REALLY WOULD LIKE if you used official 
colors but I'll probably let it slide if you don't.

&gt; Tyson, all I found in the official rules is this:
&gt;
&gt; &lt;quote&gt;
&gt; Competitors can use any normal 6 color sticker scheme for cubes, as
&gt; long as the cubes show 1 color per face in solved position. The colors
&gt; of the cube must be solid and clearly distinct from one another. The
&gt; cube must either have colored stickers or colored tiles.
&gt; &lt;/quote&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What you just wrote looks a lot stricter than those rules. If it's
&gt; supposed to be meant by "normal 6 color scheme" then I must say that's
&gt; totally not clear. So far I was convinced any 6 colors are ok as long
&gt; as they look different enough.

bad

    As far as keeping track of all the cubies in the
beginning, this is a problem for me also.  After
finishing the 3x4x3, you can pair up at least two edge
pairs (sometimes 3 edge pairs) with a few setup moves
and one sequence.  When I find some extra time, I'll
write up some more detailed sequences I use in my
method.

    Yes, so I understand that there is a problem that if your cube is ruled 
illegal, then it would be devastating to your cubing time.  That's why 
if you're really concerned and you really want to be sure, then you 
should go with a cube with good solid stickers.  If you decide to show 
up with a painted cube or a shabby stickered cube, you run your own 
risk of not being able to use that cube.

    I use a DIY from rubiks.com and it is the fastest thing I've ever 
held.  It has yet to pop (though I only built it 8 weeks ago) and 
it's really really fast.  I would not want to use any other cube.  
As for lubricant, I use FTP Multi-purpose Silicone Lube.  I'm pretty 
sure it's pure silicone spray.  Bad stickers can slow down 
recognition, so once the color starts to fade away or it gets hard 
to distinguish colors, I replace my stickers.  I've never tried KY  
on my cube, but I would imagine you want to use liquid, not jelly.  
The jelly would probably just make a mess.  If you try it, let me 
know how well it works.

&gt; Yes, so I understand that there is a problem that if your cube is ruled
&gt; illegal, then it would be devastating to your cubing time.  That's why
&gt; if you're really concerned and you really want to be sure, then you
&gt; should go with a cube with good solid stickers.  If you decide to show
&gt; up with a painted cube or a shabby stickered cube, you run your own
&gt; risk of not being able to use that cube.

    Hey Mikael, Richard,

I saw Richard's new 4x4 method a while ago, and messed around some
with the 3x3x4 method as well.  I too had a hard time finding
efficient ways to pair up the edges after making the 3x3x4.  I think
the method is very promising, though I haven't practiced it much. 
Obviously I am being closed minded and biased, but I prefer my version
of the centers-first method :) just since I've used it for so long. 
That doesn't mean though that I don't think the 3x3x4 method would be
a good speedsolve method - I think it easily could be.

I'm sure with lots of specific edge pairing sequences (though probably
not too many) and commutaters and the like, that the edge pairing step
after the 3x3x4 would be a fast step (maybe 2 looks with some setup
moves and commutaters as well??)

As far as keeping track of pieces, it all comes down to knowing all
the spots where your piece can be.  I know that sounds obvious, but
you have to just have a general idea of where it could be at all times.

Also, hard to see locations (the BR and BL edge locations for edge
pieces) should be avoided as much as possible.  I try as hard as I can
during a solution to keep edge pieces I need out of BR and BL, so that
I can see them without rotating the cube.  For the 3x3x4 method, all
the edges are visible on two faces after building the 3x3x4, so
visibility shouldn't be much of a problem.

As for the beginning, with the 3x3x4 itself (I gather this is what you
meant about keeping track of the pieces), I don't have much advice
other than to break it up into easy to handle substeps.  The 3x3x4 has
LOTS of pieces for a direct solve type of step, so it would be better
to break it up into smaller, easier to magane sections.  I think with
lots of practice that it would be managable to solve this step quickly.

I took a month off from the cube (got an XBOX for Christmas) and when

I've learned. 

I notice in my guitar playing if I take a break everynow and then when
I start backup I seem to pickup new momentium. Anyone else no what im

Anyway I guess it will be a few months before I break one minute.

    I also get some of my best times after taking a week long break from
the cube. What you should do is practice a lot, learn a whole bunch of
new algorithms/fingertricks or something really well, then take off
from the cube for a week or so. Then your mind will kind of organize
all of this new information, and when you pick it up again, it'll be
second nature to you and much easier.
I hope that paragraph made sense, not sure though....

    Hmm I think there's nothing wrong with it. There are normal perfect 
cubes which can obviously be used and there are cubes with all six 
sides having the same color which can obviously not be used. Somewhere 
in between a line has to be drawn and I think the competition 
organizers are the people who should draw it. Don't you think so?

Yes I've been unwell from a viral infection for the last week or so and 
unable to do anything, even cubing.  Then at the weekend I was able to 
concentrate again and I've gone down to times under 1 1/2 minutes.  I had a 
hospital appointment this morning and had an hour to wait for the 
appointment, so I practised cubing for a bit - and had quite an audience 
from some junior doctors from the ENT department who were at the table next 
to me in the coffee shop and suddenly realised what I was doing!

Anyone know where in the UK you can get silicone spray, my cube has 
loosened up nicely with use and turns reasonably smoothly but could do with 
a little further work because some of the edges are catching slightly from 
time to time.  Unfortunately we don't have places like Walmart here, but 
would I get it in a painter/decorator type shop or is it more an artist's 
or craft shop material?

I've started learning the Fridrich system too but that will take time.

    Whatever you do, do NOT use KY jelly.  It is my understanding that it's a petroleum product, like WD-40, and will eat the plastic that makes up your beloved cube.  KY liquid is a reasonable alternative, and because it's water based, will not destroy plastic.  Unfortunately, it wears off fairly quickly, is messy to apply, and makes the cube stick sometimes.  My girlfriend and I have both attempted to lube our cubes with the liquid and have decided silicon is a much better alternative.  On top of that, silicon is far less awkward to obtain, especially if you're a minor.  That being said, it does make for much better stories.  =)

  I use a DIY from rubiks.com and it is the fastest thing I've ever 
  held.  It has yet to pop (though I only built it 8 weeks ago) and 
  it's really really fast.  I would not want to use any other cube.  
  As for lubricant, I use FTP Multi-purpose Silicone Lube.  I'm pretty 
  sure it's pure silicone spray.  Bad stickers can slow down 
  recognition, so once the color starts to fade away or it gets hard 
  to distinguish colors, I replace my stickers.  I've never tried KY  
  on my cube, but I would imagine you want to use liquid, not jelly.  
  The jelly would probably just make a mess.  If you try it, let me 
  know how well it works.

    Actually, you'd be much more likely to find it in a hardware store or an auto parts shop.  It's a lubricant, and those are the two best places to find similar materials.  Happy cubing. =)

    What's wrong with that?  What are you to do when someone comes up to 
you with a cube that's absolutely so shaggy that it takes you 10 
seconds of studying before you realize which color sticker is which?  
What's the quote... "Oh... that one is green." referring to a white 
sticker on the cube.  The thing about that cube though was that every 
single sticker was white with a miniscule dot of green in the center.

Then, there was the nail polish cube of the winter 2004 tournament 
using glitter polish with colors so close to each other that yes, I had 
to study the cube for quite some time before I realized which slight 
shade of blue was different from which slight shade of green.  They all 
looked like brown muck to me.

If you're upset with it, suggest something new.

    But whoever did it would basically ruin their chances at the tournament 
wouldn't they?  I mean... competing on after staying up for 24-straight

I have a simple test for "color distinctiveness". Try scan in the 
solved state using a webcam and the Cube Explorer. If it accepts the 
cube then it's fine ... ;-)

Judges could in fact do that if in doubt about the suitability of 
the colors ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if you're really concerned and you really want to be sure,
&gt; then
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should go with a cube with good solid stickers.  If you decide
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; show
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up with a painted cube or a shabby stickered cube, you run
&gt; your
&gt;&gt; own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; risk of not being able to use that cube.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Having said that we had a discussion last year on a ruling

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; director
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would rule on each individual case.  For those who still

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stickers, coloured nail varnish is a fantastic substitute

&gt;&gt; is very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; durable and comes in lots of different colours!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason for the ruling on painted cubes was that "badly"
&gt;&gt; painted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cubes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can give an advantage to the solver (which makes more sense
&gt; that
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seems at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first sight)!  Problem is that if your cube is ruled illegal
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; switch to another cube it may have a different colour scheme.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Disaster!

&gt; &gt;   English is structured where sometimes there are parts missing from

Hi Stefan,

   That simile *is* written in "clean" Engish; in fact that usage
dates back to a time between Chaucer and Shakespeare.

   Believe it or not, some Americans speak English well.

As an alternative to auto/hardware shops in the UK, try Maplin if you 
have one nearby. Be warned that they might try to sell you heatsink

    Convenience for the administrators and not the competitors?  Think 
about it this way.  I'm asking you as an individual to help me out a 
little bit so I can handle 40 people coming to a tournament.  Many 
times, my staff is just a few of my close friends and they have to take 
time out of their schedule to come and make things work.  The fact is I 
can't go ahead and tailor the tournament to every single person's 
individual needs.  Some people can't make a Saturday because of 
orchestra rehearsal.  Okay... what about the guy who can't make it at 
10:30 and wants the tournament to start at 11:30 AM so he can go to 
Chinese school?

If 39 people can come to the tournament with good cubes, I'm sure you 
can to.

    Someone could just hold a cube gathering this summer
for a 24 hour marathon.  Of course it would be great
to assemble this and have guinness recognize the
effort.  Just some food for thought...

    So just to clarify... Is this an attempt to have the most humber of 
cubes solved in 24 hours at one location? If so, that would be great 
if it was possible to get an entry in the Guiness Book for doing that.

&gt; &gt; hour for me, never mind 24! lol
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would like to try this over the summer, though. 
&gt; &gt; I'm sure I can 
&gt; &gt; con sombody into helping me by then.  Plus,
&gt; &gt; hopefully I'll have OLL 
&gt; &gt; and PLL learned my then. :)

    This is the method I use.   Thanks Lars Petrus.   It is somewhat 
similar to the method you are using. The advantage to the petrus 
method for the f2l is you can solve the first two layers(f2l) without 
destroying anything you have done already. After you get used to 
using this you can start looking ahead for your next peices to solve. 
This is also true for Fridrich's system and several others. checkout

    I also oppose Guinness, especially since they have already said that
they are "not interested" in Rubik's records because they are too out
there so to speak.

I was told that Guinness doesn't like too many records for a certain
type of category (so other than fastest time and blindfolded, they
just dont' care).

Also, they've already told Jess Bonde that they "aren't interested" in
his 2000 cube attempt.

I support you guys trying to set a new cube marathon record, that's
all well and good.  However give up your hopes on Guinness, they've
already said that they don't care.

Guinness sucks, WCA recognized records are the way to go.

    So I've been solving my rainbow cube a lot recently, as I'm trying to
see how fast I can really get it.  I've noticed that on some of my
solves, I can set the rainbow cube up in such a way that I can do the
first few moves without picking up the puzzle.  I was wondering if
this would be considered legal in an official tournament.  I looked up
the WCA rules (found the workman's compensation administration when I
first googled "WCA rules"), and it says for the 3x3x3 speedsolve:

"The competitor will have 3 seconds to begin his solve after the judge
removes his hand."

and also

"In the Rubik's 3x3x3 Cube ¬ñ Speed Solve Competition, the
competitor
may return the cube to the solved state by any means."

Now I know these only apply to the 3x3x3, and that rules for other
puzzles aren't written.  I was just curious if there would be any
problem with doing this.  The rules for the 3x3x3 seem to indicate you
don't really have to pick it up if you don't want to.  If this is a
problem, I'd like to know now so I stop doing it.

    As far as I remember it was

1) The cube must be new and taken out of its original packaging for
the first time before being used for the attempt.

2) Scramble provided by a computer (not sure if there was a move #
specification), done by a third party and not seen by the competitor.

3) Competitor given 15 seconds inspection, after which the cube is
covered.

4) Countdown or some other start signal given, and the cube is solved
and placed back on the table.

Basically the solving format of the first world competition.

They would have had to have changed this since the 2003 WC however,
since I'm sure Jess was using a rather nicely prepared speedcube
rather than a cube right out of the box :)

I guess the current rules are the above rules, but in place of 1) is a
new 1) the time must be achieved in an official world competition
(since it is the title of the record)

Again that is my answer working from memory from a year ago.

    Ok Guys - really sorry and to some extent I regret my posting.  As I said it
was not at all personal and I appreciate all the hard work done by those who
organise and run tournaments.  I still feel pretty strongly that a cube with
6 clearly distinct colours - any colours - whether painted on or stickers or
tiles or whatever should be equally acceptable and my understanding is that
the rules do allow this at the organisers discretion.

I also accept that some effort has to be made to make tournaments run
smoothly and making things easier for the administrators is not in itself a
bad thing!

I guess it bothers me that I can't find stickers that last a decent amount
of time, that I don't like the most normal colour scheme because I "grew up"
with the original Ideal one and that my beautifully nail-varnished cube may
not be acceptable in tournaments even though it confers no advantage!

Having said that the rules are the rules and should I ever find the time to
make the trip to take part in a tournament then I shall abide!

Sorry if I got you worked up Tyson - all your efforts and your many helpful
postings are much appreciated.

Duncan

    Hey Duncan,

Yeah sorry.  I shouldn't have gotten so worked out.  If you give me a 
mailing address, I'll mail you some amazing stickers by Adam Zamora.

&gt; Ok Guys - really sorry and to some extent I regret my posting.  As I 
&gt; said it
&gt; was not at all personal and I appreciate all the hard work done by 
&gt; those who
&gt; organise and run tournaments.  I still feel pretty strongly that a 
&gt; cube with
&gt; 6 clearly distinct colours - any colours - whether painted on or 
&gt; stickers or
&gt; tiles or whatever should be equally acceptable and my understanding is 
&gt; that
&gt; the rules do allow this at the organisers discretion.
&gt;
&gt; I also accept that some effort has to be made to make tournaments run
&gt; smoothly and making things easier for the administrators is not in 
&gt; itself a
&gt; bad thing!
&gt;
&gt; I guess it bothers me that I can't find stickers that last a decent 
&gt; amount
&gt; of time, that I don't like the most normal colour scheme because I 
&gt; "grew up"
&gt; with the original Ideal one and that my beautifully nail-varnished 
&gt; cube may
&gt; not be acceptable in tournaments even though it confers no advantage!
&gt;
&gt; Having said that the rules are the rules and should I ever find the 
&gt; time to
&gt; make the trip to take part in a tournament then I shall abide!
&gt;
&gt; Sorry if I got you worked up Tyson - all your efforts and your many 
&gt; helpful

    I am also using the Gilles Roux Method...I'm working on learning the 
corner algorithms, and I currently average about 28-30.  I originally 
started with the petrus method, learned PLL sequences, then learned a 
few F2L algorithms, and now i am working at this method.  The best 
thing to do is just keep working.  Work on getting the solution down, 
moves-wise and all.  Try to get few moves, and then try to slowly 
build up your speed.  Lube will probably get in the way at first

    Hey Everyone,

Are you a cuber in college?  Is anyone interested in a college vs. 
college match?  I think it might be fun.  You know... 5 cubers from 
each school.  There are a variety of ways of doing this.  It could be 
first team to solve 100 cubes or something.  Or we could have the top 
cubers vs. the top cuber and the 2nd vs. the 2nd and so on and see 
which school wins more.  Anyway, I think it might be fun.

    Beware: I'm not WCA, this is just my personal guess/opinion.

I think as long as we use stackmats (and I'd like to keep using them) 
there shouldn't be a problem with that. Using the stackmat starts the 
timer when your hands take off so the time is running when you do 
moves like that. Also I know at least one person who does the second 
half of the Magic solve with the Magic lying on the mat and there's no 
problem with that either (that's not a complaint, I agree that's ok). 
And I do much of the Master Magic solve with it lying on the mat.

I thought about the same for the Megaminx, but I guess since that 
puzzle takes a lot longer anyway it doesn't really matter to me that 
much ;-)

    Hi Chris,

That's why the WCA uses the StackMat as the official timing device.  It 
starts the timer once you lift off a hand meaning there is no possible 
way you can make a move before starting the timer.  Beautiful isn't it? 
  That is one of the main reasons the WCA will not be using the new 
optical sensor timer.  I understand there are issues with the StackMat 
and if anyone wants to have a discussion about it, please do so.  
However, I believe the StackMat satisfies all of our needs and 
accommodates basically every puzzle and allows for easy judging, little 
discrepancy, and yes, it works well.  The argument that "it times the 
time it takes you to pick up the puzzle as well which is not fair" is 
not a very good one because practically, there is no way to time purely 
the solve.  100-meter dash runners have to react to a gun and if you 
fall asleep, well, that's your fault.

As for returning the cube to its solved state by any means possible, 
when I have time, and that probably means a spring break or summer 
break, I will revisit all of the rules and revise them.  You should 
really be following the spirit of the law there and I will change the 
letter of the law to reflect the spirit of the law.  One example of 
something which would be dishonorable would be twisting two corners 
really quickly to solve your cube when you could perform an OLL.  
That's cheap... Doug Li brought it up, and I'll revise that rule 
sometime.

Again, to answer your question, you can't touch the puzzle while your 
hands are on the timer and there's no way for you to lift up a hand 
without starting the timer unless you have jedi-powers or unless you 
use your feet.  Speaking of feet, then that means your feet would have 
to be on the timing pad as well.  Okay, something else to revise but 
you get the point.  The rules have been written in such a manner that 
takes away any unfair advantage or loop holes or whatever so if there 
are loop holes or things you can kind of squeeze around, let us know so 
we can improve on them.

    So... my thoughts on the 24-hour cube marathon.  I myself really do 
want to make an attempt at this and I'll do it when I have time and 
when I can find a good venue with some publicity.  If there is someone 
out there who wants to try it and you're really serious about it, I'd 
like to propose some audition criteria.  I'm not going to gather a team 
to scramble cubes for you for 24 hours if you don't have a reasonable 
chance of breaking that record.  Therefore, I really recommend that you 
solve 120 cubes in an hour before you even think about anything else.

Sure, 120 cubes in an hour is well over the pace necessary to do 2000 
in 24 but when you count in fatigue, yeah, you'll be "crawling" at hour 
18.  Not to mention bathroom breaks.

    The StackMat prevents people from exploiting the ability of making a 
turn or any type of puzzle manipulation before the timer is started.  I 
pretty much don't see a way of getting around this unless you use 
another part of your body but the rules should say you aren't allowed 
to touch the puzzle until the time has started and, well, if it's not 
there, it can be written in.  Sure, some of you may say that you should 
be allowed to touch the puzzle as the time starts but then you risk 
starting the time after you've touched the puzzle and any physicist out 
there knows that theoretical problems never work in the real world.  
Now, about that frictionless swivel chair... whee!

&gt; I think as long as we use stackmats (and I'd like to keep using them)
&gt; there shouldn't be a problem with that. Using the stackmat starts the
&gt; timer when your hands take off so the time is running when you do
&gt; moves like that. Also I know at least one person who does the second
&gt; half of the Magic solve with the Magic lying on the mat and there's no
&gt; problem with that either (that's not a complaint, I agree that's ok).
&gt; And I do much of the Master Magic solve with it lying on the mat.
&gt;
&gt; I thought about the same for the Megaminx, but I guess since that
&gt; puzzle takes a lot longer anyway it doesn't really matter to me that
&gt; much ;-)

&gt; Whatever you do, do NOT use KY jelly.  It is my understanding that

&gt; and because it's water based, will not destroy plastic.  
&gt; Unfortunately, it wears off fairly quickly, is messy to apply, and

    Funny story time.  A few months ago, myself and a female cohort were planning a night of movies, video games, and eating junk food.  Being the addict I am, I also brought my cube, which was sorely in need of a lubing.  We needed supplies from Wal-Mart anyway, so we decided to just kill two birds with one stone.  I read on someone's site that KY Liquid worked extremely well, so I found some to buy.  We pulled up to the register and plopped on the counter: 1 YM magazine, 6 rolls of colored duct tape (we made fantastic wallets and a messenger bag), 1 20 oz. bottle of 7up, a massive log of cookie dough, and a bottle of KY Liquid.  The attendant took one look and asked us 'Fun night planned?'

    It's actually quite easy to keep your palms on the timer and solve the 
entire cube without starting it, alternately stopping it early and keep 
solving.

You'd need a rule saying that the cube needs to be put down a certain 
distance from the sensors, both before and after the solve, to make 
sure it can't happen.

If a moderately talented illusionist practiced it, I expect they could 
trim a second or two off on a way that most judges wouldn't notice.

&gt; That's why the WCA uses the StackMat as the official timing device.  It

I am also using the Gilles Roux Method...I'm working on learning the 
corner algorithms, and I currently average about 28-30.  I originally 
started with the petrus method, learned PLL sequences, then learned a 
few F2L algorithms, and now i am working at this method.  The best 
thing to do is just keep working.  Work on getting the solution down, 
moves-wise and all.  Try to get few moves, and then try to slowly 
build up your speed.  Lube will probably get in the way at first 
until you adjust to having it on your cube, but in the end, it is a 
huge help.  If you want to talk to me about tips or whatever, my e-

That geek-test is bullshit. What kind of geek test is it that doesn't

Needless to say I'm proud to apparently not be a geek, they call me

    They're solid vinyl and they're the standard colors.  No peeling and 
the chip much less than the Rubiks.com stickers.  The red is also a 
slightly darker read which makes it very distinguishable from the

they have listed Chun Hei as being from China instead of being from

He bought a sticker machine for several hundred $$$ and produces 
stickers himself. About a month ago he sent a mail to I think 10-20 
people who want stickers saying he's busy at the moment and will get 
back to us. I'm on that list and I can let you know once I hear from 
him again. Here's his thread over at twistypuzzles:

Hmm, you make it sound like they just copied the WCA lists, I don't 
think that's the case. Notice that this page has been around for quite 
some time, maybe even before we had our own nice lists. And it has 
been frequently updated after each tournament, taking them time to

I'm sure that's just a mistake. I think Ralf Laue probably maintains

That would be a blast Tyson.  I've got maybe 4 other guys here at OU 
that would probably be up for it if we could manage travel 
arrangements.  Maybe if the guys at my school got together and all 
pushed, we could form an official OU Cube club, with some kind of 
school sponsering for tourneys!

I like the college vs. college idea very much!

    Hi Stefan,

I did know the page and I did know Ralf Laue was involved though I only 
know Ralf Laue by name and I've never spoken to him.  It's not that 
they "copied" the WCA list because they didn't.  They have records on 
there which the WCA does have.  However, the Chun Hei Wong record does 
belong to the WCA and we recognize it as Hong Kong.  I'm upset because 
they took our record and modified it.

It would be really nice of you to contact Ralf Laue for me and ask him 
about it.  I personally am not from Hong Kong but I understand that 
Hong Kong people would be insulted to be called Chinese.  There are 
many political issues out there right now and it is of my opinion that 
we recognize Hong Kong.  I'm sure Chun Hei will agree with me and if 
there is any person out there who feels differently, I ask them the 
question, what right do you have to say what nationality Chun Hei is 
from?  What right do you have to say he is not from Hong Kong but he is 
from China?

During our spring break, I will be flying to Mississippi to help a

Pasadena.  On the way, on Wednesday, March 23, 2005, Mark and I will be 
stopping by "The Science Place" in Dallas, Texas to meet with the 
museum administrators to discuss issues about the tournament.  If any 
cubers would like to attend, please let me know and let's work 
something out.

Also, if there any any cubers on the way from Mississippi to Pasadena, 
so if you're near Interstate-20 or Interstate-10, let me know.  Maybe 
we can drop by and have a few races?

    Hmm.. 

I don't really know much about the relationship between Hong Kong 
and China, but I do know that it's not really the same as 'two 
different countries', like Spain and Mexico or something. But I 
could be wrong about this... :)..

&gt; Hi Stefan,

&gt; I did know the page and I did know Ralf Laue was involved though I 
only 
&gt; know Ralf Laue by name and I've never spoken to him.  It's not 
that 
&gt; they "copied" the WCA list because they didn't.  They have records 
on 
&gt; there which the WCA does have.  However, the Chun Hei Wong record 
does 
&gt; belong to the WCA and we recognize it as Hong Kong.  I'm upset 
because 
&gt; they took our record and modified it.
&gt; 
&gt; It would be really nice of you to contact Ralf Laue for me and ask 
him 
&gt; about it.  I personally am not from Hong Kong but I understand 
that 
&gt; Hong Kong people would be insulted to be called Chinese.  There 
are 
&gt; many political issues out there right now and it is of my opinion 
that 
&gt; we recognize Hong Kong.  I'm sure Chun Hei will agree with me and 
if 
&gt; there is any person out there who feels differently, I ask them 
the 
&gt; question, what right do you have to say what nationality Chun Hei 
is 
&gt; from?  What right do you have to say he is not from Hong Kong but 
he is 
&gt; from China?

&gt; &gt; Hmm, you make it sound like they just copied the WCA lists, I 
don't
&gt; &gt; think that's the case. Notice that this page has been around for 
quite
&gt; &gt; some time, maybe even before we had our own nice lists. And it 
has
&gt; &gt; been frequently updated after each tournament, taking them time 
to
&gt; &gt; collect the data. I like their effort.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm sure that's just a mistake. I think Ralf Laue probably 
maintains
&gt; &gt; it and I'm currently in contact with him anyway so I'll tell him 
about
&gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Btw, what's the big deal about Hong Kong vs China? Are Hong Kong
&gt; &gt; people insulted when someone thinks they're Chinese?

    The issues start to become a lot more sensitive if you want to really 
get into it.  Hong Kong was... now, correct my history lesson if I'm 
wrong, part of the British territories.  China gave up Hong Kong to 
Britain for 99 years after the "Opium Wars" right?  and it was in 1999 
when Hong Kong was returned to China.  In those 99 years, Hong Kong and 
China developed very differently.  Now, technically they are "one 
country" but people from Hong Kong still identify themselves as from 
Hong Kong rather than from China.

Some one better acquainted with this subject might want to jump in 
here.  It is of my opinion that if someone says they are from Hong 
Kong, then I will honor that request.  Does anyone know if the Hong 
Kong passport is different than the China passport?

    Hi Folks,

On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, I helped showcase the Rubik's Cube 
at the Winning Moves booth at the annual toy fair at the Jacob 
Javits Center in New York.  Basically I just solved the cube for 
anyone who walked by the booth.  I had some TV stints on CBS, NBC, 
and a local station called New York 1.  One of the clips is 
available at http://www.ny1.com/Living/home.html

Right now the toy fair is the lead story...just click the video link 
below the title.  The video requires Real Media Player.  My part of 
the video is about 55 seconds in.  I'll try to get copies of the 
other clips and post them someplace.

I got to meet Dave Jones from Seventowns and he was really cool.  I 
also met the world record holder for the Bedlam Cube.  He puts it 
together in about 12 seconds.  I think Macky (on the cube) could 
give him a run for his money.

Here are some stats:

# of 3x3x3s solved ~300
# of 4x4x4s solved ~10
# of 5x5x5s solved ~5
# of 5x5x5s popped  1
# of minutes to fix the pop ~20
# of people who claimed they used to be able to do the cube ~20
# of people who could actually solve the cube for me  2
# of people who told me that their method of solving was to peel the 
stickers off ~43 quintillion

So my fingers hurt from cubing and the colors on the cube all blend 
together for me now so I thought I might take a good long cube 
break.  For the record, I almost made it the whole subway ride home 
tonight without playing with the cube :)

    Is it ok I dislike the way she says "how impressive" even more than 
her "secret"? Non-cubing girls. Pah. Can't get any worse ;-)

Nice solve, though, yes, especially since you're talking at the same 
time and it's in front of a camera. But admit it, the cross had 
already been solved, right? :-)

&gt; give him a run for his money.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some stats:
&gt; 
&gt; # of 3x3x3s solved ~300
&gt; # of 4x4x4s solved ~10
&gt; # of 5x5x5s solved ~5
&gt; # of 5x5x5s popped  1
&gt; # of minutes to fix the pop ~20
&gt; # of people who claimed they used to be able to do the cube ~20
&gt; # of people who could actually solve the cube for me  2
&gt; # of people who told me that their method of solving was to peel the 
&gt; stickers off ~43 quintillion
&gt; 
&gt; So my fingers hurt from cubing and the colors on the cube all blend 
&gt; together for me now so I thought I might take a good long cube 
&gt; break.  For the record, I almost made it the whole subway ride home 
&gt; tonight without playing with the cube :)

&gt; &gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, I helped showcase the Rubik's Cube 
&gt; &gt; at the Winning Moves booth at the annual toy fair at the Jacob 
&gt; &gt; Javits Center in New York.  Basically I just solved the cube for 
&gt; &gt; anyone who walked by the booth.  I had some TV stints on CBS, NBC, 
&gt; &gt; and a local station called New York 1.  One of the clips is 
&gt; &gt; available at http://www.ny1.com/Living/home.html
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Right now the toy fair is the lead story...just click the video link 
&gt; &gt; below the title.  The video requires Real Media Player.  My part of 
&gt; &gt; the video is about 55 seconds in.  I'll try to get copies of the 
&gt; &gt; other clips and post them someplace.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I got to meet Dave Jones from Seventowns and he was really cool.  I 
&gt; &gt; also met the world record holder for the Bedlam Cube.  He puts it 
&gt; &gt; together in about 12 seconds.  I think Macky (on the cube) could

    Hello,

I am new to this group as well as speed cubing, but I have made my 
own sets of stickers in sizes for all cubes.  They are solid viynl 
and computer plotted.  I originaly made them for myself, but would 
make more if there is interest.  I have contacted Tyson to send him 
a set to try out and give feedback.

    i think it is an excellent idea, also.  however, i doubt there are 
many speedcubers here at rutgers (i believe i am the fastest, and i 
average upper 30s...i only know of one other guy under 60s)...also, 
rutgers and caltech are a bit spread apart. :P  however, i am hoping 
that a rubik's club here will generate further interest in 
speedcubing, so hopefully within a few months, there will be some 
speed demons here :D

&gt; &gt; Are you a cuber in college?  Is anyone interested in a college 
vs. 
&gt; &gt; college match?  I think it might be fun.  You know... 5 cubers 
from 
&gt; &gt; each school.  There are a variety of ways of doing this.  It 
could 
&gt; be 
&gt; &gt; first team to solve 100 cubes or something.  Or we could have 
the 
&gt; top 
&gt; &gt; cubers vs. the top cuber and the 2nd vs. the 2nd and so on and 
see 
&gt; &gt; which school wins more.  Anyway, I think it might be fun.

&gt; That would be a blast Tyson.  I've got maybe 4 other guys here at 
OU 
&gt; that would probably be up for it if we could manage travel 
&gt; arrangements.  Maybe if the guys at my school got together and all 
&gt; pushed, we could form an official OU Cube club, with some kind of 
&gt; school sponsering for tourneys!

&gt; I like the college vs. college idea very much!

    I think I could find some other cubers from Maryland.  I know of at
least 2 from thefacebook, and a handful of others who put "rubik's
cube" somewhere in their profile.

I think it would be awesome if there were a few from each group of 5
that weren't very fast.  I think it would show the not-as-fast people
that not everyone on the yahoo group is sub-30, but also show them
that there is plenty of room to improve, and it would give them
incentive to improve to help their school team.

In other words, I think it would be a blast.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you a cuber in college?  Is anyone interested in a college 
&gt; vs. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; college match?  I think it might be fun.  You know... 5 cubers 
&gt; from 
&gt; &gt; &gt; each school.  There are a variety of ways of doing this.  It 
&gt; could 
&gt; &gt; be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; first team to solve 100 cubes or something.  Or we could have 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; top 
&gt; &gt; &gt; cubers vs. the top cuber and the 2nd vs. the 2nd and so on and 
&gt; see 
&gt; &gt; &gt; which school wins more.  Anyway, I think it might be fun.

&gt; &gt; That would be a blast Tyson.  I've got maybe 4 other guys here at 
&gt; OU 
&gt; &gt; that would probably be up for it if we could manage travel 
&gt; &gt; arrangements.  Maybe if the guys at my school got together and all 
&gt; &gt; pushed, we could form an official OU Cube club, with some kind of 
&gt; &gt; school sponsering for tourneys!

&gt; &gt; I like the college vs. college idea very much!

some corners first methods are very ineffective, others are very 
effective.  To be effective, like in any other method, a corners 
first method has to cover many different possibilities and fit the 
person.  I have a corners first method that I do, but its never been 
my fastest method.  One thing i was wanting to work on, but never 
got around to doing it, is combining my method with corners first, 
using the idea to solve with which ever method best fits, and be 
able to combine both methods all the way through the solution.......

It was a beautiful job though.  Like, you didn't really even see the

    LOL, I guess I have a weird story to tell (It's true). After I read 
the site on KY Lubricant being a good cube lube (I Think Thomas?), I 
asked my parents to take me to K-Mart (I've seen it there before) 
the next time we pass by. Well, I didn't exactly do much "research" 
before looking for it, and when I asked an employee to help me open 
the "cage" to the lubricant, and the employee stares at me and asks 
me what I'm using it for. It ended up being embarassing since the 
guy thought I was messing with him so I can use the lubricant 
for "real use." So I didn't buy any. I learned something from the 
experience...........Never buy anything that isn't normally used for 
your age group ;)~

    we may be talking about the same thing; but I wouldn't know as I 
have limited experience with the nuances of nail polish.  I know 
clear nail polish is available but have never used it; wondered if 
it would work to help keep the stickers from peeling so quickly.  
sounds like from your experience it wouldn't help...

anyone know of anything else that can work, or do you all just buy a

    Just for those who don't know.  Hong Kong was leased from China to the UK on
a 100 year lease and during this period had a British Governor and british
passports.  This expired in around 1999 I believe and the island  was
ceremoniously handed back to China. Given the very different cultures and
socio-economic setups in mainland China and Hong Kong the Chinese gave
certain assurances to Hong Kong that their more democratic way of life would
be maintained although changes are/were inevitable.

Many Hong Kong Chinese still have British passports but I'm not sure whether
they are eligible to play sport for Britain - I guess they probably are!

&gt; &gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, I helped showcase the Rubik's 
Cube 
&gt; &gt; at the Winning Moves booth at the annual toy fair at the Jacob 
&gt; &gt; Javits Center in New York.  Basically I just solved the cube for 
&gt; &gt; anyone who walked by the booth.  I had some TV stints on CBS, 
NBC, 
&gt; &gt; and a local station called New York 1.  One of the clips is 
&gt; &gt; available at http://www.ny1.com/Living/home.html
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Right now the toy fair is the lead story...just click the video 
link 
&gt; &gt; below the title.  The video requires Real Media Player.  My part 
of 
&gt; &gt; the video is about 55 seconds in.  I'll try to get copies of the 
&gt; &gt; other clips and post them someplace.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I got to meet Dave Jones from Seventowns and he was really 
cool.  I 
&gt; &gt; also met the world record holder for the Bedlam Cube.  He puts 
it 
&gt; &gt; together in about 12 seconds.  I think Macky (on the cube) could 
&gt; &gt; give him a run for his money.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here are some stats:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; # of 3x3x3s solved ~300
&gt; &gt; # of 4x4x4s solved ~10
&gt; &gt; # of 5x5x5s solved ~5
&gt; &gt; # of 5x5x5s popped  1
&gt; &gt; # of minutes to fix the pop ~20
&gt; &gt; # of people who claimed they used to be able to do the cube ~20
&gt; &gt; # of people who could actually solve the cube for me  2
&gt; &gt; # of people who told me that their method of solving was to peel 
the 
&gt; &gt; stickers off ~43 quintillion
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So my fingers hurt from cubing and the colors on the cube all 
blend 
&gt; &gt; together for me now so I thought I might take a good long cube 
&gt; &gt; break.  For the record, I almost made it the whole subway ride 
home 
&gt; &gt; tonight without playing with the cube :)

    Hey bro,

I'm a total beginner.  I can only solve one side.  That's it.  It's 
been that way for about 18 years.  3.5 years ago I suddenly got cube 
crazy.  My roommates friend was visiting and solved the cube I had on 
the shelf.  It took him about 3 minutes.  I almost shit my pants. He 
gave me 2 minutes worth of instructions.  I couldn't remember it so 
he wrote down all this code on a piece of paper.  Didn't help.
So I said screw it.  Bout 2 years ago I decided I was gonna learn how 
to solve this S.O.B.  Went on the internet.  Went to all the sites, 
none of them helped.  I read the instructions slowly.  I still was 
blown away.

I'm convinced that the only way to solve the cube is to have somebody 
actually show you in person.  Like a Rubik's Cube coach or teacher.

I challenge you and your tutorial.  You can experiment on me.  I have 
a college degree and am stumped by the rubik's cube.  I'll go check 
out your website.  If it doesn't help then I'm gonna hire someone, 
actually pay someone to teach me how to solve it.  I'm tired of only 
being able to do one side.

    Yes, clear nail polish will prolong the life of the stickes as it 
keeps the edges from peeling up. It does flake and rub off so you'll 
need to keep applying it on a weekly basis.

    Hi B,

  There's only one thing that you need to know to solve the cube from
that point. To make a change - you take something out of place one
way, and put it back in place another way. Of course you need to pay
attention to what happens to the remaining pieces when you do that.

  You might want to write down what you do as you go along.

  If you make a mistake and get lost - don't get discouraged, just try
again.

Regards,

David J

   Your style of solving looks very clean and efficient. ITs similar
to Gilles second half. Very nice.

   Are your finger tricks your own? Can you describe your style?

&gt; I got to meet Dave Jones from Seventowns and he was really cool.  I 
&gt; also met the world record holder for the Bedlam Cube.  He puts it

&gt; give him a run for his money.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some stats:
&gt;

&gt; # of 4x4x4s solved ~10
&gt; # of 5x5x5s solved ~5
&gt; # of 5x5x5s popped  1
&gt; # of minutes to fix the pop ~20
&gt; # of people who claimed they used to be able to do the cube ~20
&gt; # of people who could actually solve the cube for me  2
&gt; # of people who told me that their method of solving was to peel the 
&gt; stickers off ~43 quintillion
&gt; 
&gt; So my fingers hurt from cubing and the colors on the cube all blend 
&gt; together for me now so I thought I might take a good long cube 
&gt; break.  For the record, I almost made it the whole subway ride home 
&gt; tonight without playing with the cube :)

    Hello!

I¬¥ve been looking fore those two puzzles for some time now and have 
come to the conclusion that I can¬¥t find them anywhere in Finland so 
I¬¥ll have to order the from abroad. I have checked mefferts.com and 
they have both puzzles in stock.

I¬¥m thinking of getting mine from there but I¬¥d hate to put my money 
on something that ain¬¥t good. So I have a lot of questions...
1. Has anyone else bought their 5x5x5¬¥s or Megaminx from mefferts?
2. They both come tiled, good or bad?
3. Is the 5x5x5 an eastsheen, what about the Megaminx?
4. Is the prize okey (28$ and free shipping)?

Thanks,
Mikael

    Tyson's right.  anyone can figure it out how to solve it with enough 
time.  I figured it out as well--it took patience, and a notebook, 
and i took my cube apart and put it back together many times when it 
got too messed up for me to figure out [now i hear you can go on the 
net and color a cube with your current position and it will show you 
how to solve it].  It took most of the summer between the 6th and 
7th grades for me to learn to solve it and get down to about 2 
minutes.

I'm sure there are great beginner sites out there
my quick tips--do one side first, but make sure the side stickers 
match up with the center squares they're touching.  that's something 
a lot of beginners don't get that you can have a solid color on one 
side but still not have it correct.  Learning that is a solid first 
step.

then learn a simple sequence for inserting a side edge piece into 
the second layer.

Practice those steps until you feel comfortable with them.  then go 
on and learn some sequences for flipping the final corners to the 
right direction then place them in the right spot, and flipping the 
final edge pieces and placing them in the right spot.

You can do that with only a few algorithms to learn.

keep it up, you'll figure it out, and when you do, it's pretty 
amazing.  [ of course then you'll just be back here trying to learn 
how to do it in under 20 seconds...]
good luck

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Folks,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, I helped
&gt; showcase the Rubik's 
&gt; Cube 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the Winning Moves booth at the annual toy
&gt; fair at the Jacob 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Javits Center in New York.  Basically I just
&gt; solved the cube 
&gt; for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyone who walked by the booth.  I had some TV
&gt; stints on CBS, 
&gt; NBC, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and a local station called New York 1.  One of
&gt; the clips is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; available at
&gt; http://www.ny1.com/Living/home.html
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right now the toy fair is the lead
&gt; story...just click the video 
&gt; link 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; below the title.  The video requires Real
&gt; Media Player.  My 
&gt; part of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the video is about 55 seconds in.  I'll try to

    Ok...time to fess up.  Not that I wasn't expecting you guys to catch me.  Before 
they started filming, I told Jill it would take me about 25 seconds.  She said 
she needed it in 15.  No problem for Macky but I decided to start with the cross 
and first F2L pair done.  Outside of that "minor" cheating, the solve was real.  
The OLL wasn't skipped, Tyson...it was the one where all pieces need to be 
flipped up and there are two solid bars (of yellow) on opposite sides of the last 
layer.

We actually filmed two solves...I think the other one was a bit faster.  The witty 
repartee between us was identical for both clips.

I also showed her how to do the first layer of a 2x2.  She was really into it and I 
was thinking of asking for her number but I thought my wife might 
protest...especially since it was on tape.

I wasn't nervous but I did do the OLL slowly to make sure I didn't mess it up.

I heard that MSNBC did a 3 second clip last night where it was me solving the 
cube and Keith Oberman calling cubers a bunch of nerds.  I haven't seen it 
but I'm still offended.  Don't we prefer the term 'geeks'?

David:  Thanks for the compliment.  I'm trying to emulate Ron's style in terms 
of solving slowly but fluidly.  I'm not sure where my finger tricks came 
from...partly from Dan Harris, Chris Hardwick, and Ron.  I'll start speeding up 
once my mind becomes better at following the pieces but for now I'm content 
to turn the faces slowly while trying to minimize delays.

    How about opening this college competition to high school groups as well?  
I've got at least 5 kids here who would participate.  Maybe it could be run

that thing get finished?

&gt; 1. Has anyone else bought their 5x5x5¬¥s or Megaminx from mefferts?

Yes. I got two tiled 5x5 (one a few months back, the other three days 
ago), one tiled megaminx and two stickered megaminxs (though I bought 
them in stores in England last year but they're meffert). Two more 
tiled megaminx are on the way.

The stickered megaminxs are perfectly ok, too. The only thing I didn't 
like was that they were 6-colored only, so I made them 12-colored 
myself.

I simply love my tiled megaminx, though I replaced its springs first. 
See also this thread over at twistypuzzles:
http://www.twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3488

&gt; 2. They both come tiled, good or bad?

Good. Of course that's my personal opinion. I like the look, I like 
the feel, and I think it's good for looking ahead because you can 
slightly look "around" edges. Lots of the tiles on my first 5x5 though 
weren't glued good enough and fell off so I had to glue them back on. 
But the new one seems very good and not have this problem.

&gt; 3. Is the 5x5x5 an eastsheen, what about the Megaminx?

The tiled 5x5 are *not* eastsheen, the smaller stickered 5x5 are. The 
tiled ones actually use the same mechanism as the Rubik ones and they 
have the additional advantage of having screws so you can adjust the 
tension. Megaminx has nothing to do with eastsheen. I think Meffert 
has the exclusive rights to the Megaminx and is the only producer.

&gt; 4. Is the prize okey (28$ and free shipping)?

It is *very* ok.

Cheers!

Can you tell what's so bad about the non-tiled megaminx? A friend of

&gt; From that site, looks like you were experimenting last summer.  are 
&gt; you still using that cyanacrylat-based superglue, and is it still 
&gt; working ok?

It is still working perfectly, though I haven't played with my super 
5x5 so much. But I've also protected a normal 5x5 like this and used 
it quite a bit and it's still perfectly sealed.

But I admit it's also quite a bit of work to do this so I haven't done 
it with other cubes yet. I planned to do it with several more 5x5s but 
if I can get good vinyl sticker sets for $1 or so then I'll prefer 
those. Also, I don't think I'd use it for normal sized 3x3 because it 
seems harder to get right the bigger the to-be-protected stickers are.

Bottom line - I love it (perfect protection, nice touch/look), but 
it's not worth it for normal puzzles. However I would certainly do it 
again if I made another "super" puzzle like that, in order to protect 
the then very little sticker parts.

Cheers!

Wow, I never even thought about that possibility. But looking at it 
from a non-cuber point-of-view, it may be very reasonably to think 
it's funny and even pretend to be that "cool". Well, since the 
majority of viewers are probably non-cubers, maybe this is actually 
positive advertisement for our sport. It's a strange world, out there.

1) you dont have to pay anyone, if you just came to one of the events,
im sure someone would love to teach you, i know i like teaching as
many people as i can, i'd gladly teach you if you came to an event

2) yes it helps alot to have someone teach you, but it deffinately
isnt necisary(sp).
Although i didnt figure out how to solve it on my own :-( i did read a
website or two and i could figure it out, the hardest part, for me at
least, was understanding what an edge was, what a corner was, what it
means to turn a specified face. I tried to fix that in my beginner
solution(at http://www.deepcube.tk ), and put what i beleive to be a

&gt;

    i can actually speed solve (30-40 seconds) using the method i

&gt; &gt; final edge pieces and placing them in the right spot.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can do that with only a few algorithms to learn.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; keep it up, you'll figure it out, and when you do, it's pretty 
&gt; &gt; amazing.  [ of course then you'll just be back here trying to 
learn

    I coded it mostly using the BigInteger feature of Java.  I used a 
variation of Richard Carr's and Chris Hardwick's formulae, modified 
to make the coding more efficient.

The code for the program was pretty simple and straight-forward, 
though:-

import java.math.BigInteger;
public class Cube {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = IO.readInteger();
        if (x &lt; 2 || x &gt; 100) {
            System.out.println("Be realistic!");
        } else {
            BigInteger n = new BigInteger(String.valueOf(x));
            BigInteger odd1 = new BigInteger("282526639718400");
            BigInteger odd = odd1.pow(x%2);
            BigInteger a = odd.multiply(new BigInteger("3674160"));
            BigInteger b = new BigInteger
("620448401733239439360000");
            BigInteger c = b.pow((x*x-2*x)/4);
            BigInteger num = a.multiply(c);
            BigInteger fourfact = new BigInteger("24");
            BigInteger denom = fourfact.pow(6*((x-2)*(x-2))/4);
            BigInteger result = num.divide(denom);
            if (x == 2) {
                System.out.println("There are "+result+" 
combinations.");
            } else {
                String big = ""+result;
                String first = big.substring(0,1);
                String second = big.substring(1);
                int digits = second.length();
                second = big.substring(1,5);
                String small = first+"."+second+" x 10^"+digits;
                System.out.println("There are 
approximately "+small+" combinations.");
            }
        }
    }
}

I used an IO module from lecture to receive the input because I 
don't know how to code that part myself.

I hope it's clear what's going on. You can obviously do the same thing
in a less demonstrative way. If anyone could seriously pull it off in
a competition is of course an other question, but it wouldn't surprise
me at all. Cubers can be very capable with their hands.

You need to start with the palms flat on the sensors.  In order to get 
that position from a palms-down starting position, it would be 
necessary to do a weird sliding of the hands...

I'll see if I can pull that off.  Let me know if you guys can pull it

I just did a whole solve and placed my hands flat again without

With palms flat and the cube placed at least say 20 cm away from the 
sensors i can't see how it's possible to make any turns on the cube. 
Unless using ur nose or something. Which could also be explicitly 
forbidden ;-)

    this is a reply to the entire thread

Are that many people trying to cheat the system? I have not been to 
a tourny yet so I guess it is possible that many people try to 
cheat??

if so just make one simple rules. The judges rules are above all 
else. From an illusionist stand point this cheat will not work 
without being seen unless absolutely no one is paying attention to 
the fact that the timer isn't moving. To do the move for this cheat 
would require alot of foresight and practice. most of which we all 
do practicing cubing.

    Hey everyone,

I just worked out a proof by induction to the least clear exponent of
my formula for the number of combinations to the nxnxn
super-supercube.  The exponent is the one to the term (24!/2).  I
realized that I never really explained what that exponent counts, or
even that it is accurate, so here is the proof.

For those math people out there, do you think this is
interesting/important enough to include on combinations page?  I'm
thinking about putting it in just for completeness.

Anyway, just in case anyone is interested here is the proof.
---------
I'll do this in 2 cases, the first where n is odd, and the second
where n is even.

Case 1:  Let n only be an odd number (so I'm only dealing with odd
sized super-supercubes)

The exponent of (24!/2) on my page for odd cubes is (n^3-13n+12)/24 
This counts the total number of 24 piece center and edge piece orbits
(including all levels inside the cube as well).

So first we have to see that it is true for some case, let's do n=5

(5^3-13*5+12)/24 = 3 and there are 2 24 piece center orbits and 1 24
piece edge orbit on the 5x5x5 supercube (none on the 3x3 obviously) so
this is right.

So assuming (n^3-13n+12)/24 is true for some case n, we add the number
of 24 piece orbits on the next level (n+2) odd cube and see if we can
reconcile this to ((n+2)^3-13(n+2)+12)/24

number of oribts (centers and edges) on an odd degree cube (not
super-supercube):
(n^2-2n-3)/4

And now here's the proof:
(n^3-13n+12)/24 + [(n+2)^2-2(n+2)-3]/4
[n^3-13n+12+6((n+2)^2-2n-7)]/24
(n^3-13n+12+6n^2+12n-18)/24
[(n^3+6n^2+12n+8)-13n-14)]/24
[(n+2)^3-13(n+2)+12]/24

And so by induction this counts the total number of 24 piece center
and edge orbits on an odd nxnxn super-supercube.

Also for the verifying case right at the beginning you can start with
n=3 (the smallest possible) and the exponent will be 0, which is
correct.  And by induction the formula works from n=3,5,7,9,...

----

Case 2: Let n be even (so we're dealing only with even super-supercube).

The exponent of (24!/2) on my page for even cubes is (n^3-4n)/24  This
counts the total number of 24 piece center and edge piece orbits
(including all levels inside the cube).

So first we have to see that it is true for some case, let's do n=4

(4^3-4*4)/24 = 2

So assuming (n^3-4n)/24 is true for some case n, we add the number of
24 piece oribts on the next level (n+2) even cube and see if we can
reconcile this to ((n+2)^3-4(n+2))/24

number of oribts on an odd degree cube (not the super-supercube):
(n^2-2n)/4

And now here's the proof:
(n^3-4n)/24 + [(n+2)^2-2(n+2)]/4
[n^3-4n+6((n+2)^2-2n-4)]/24
(n^3-4n+6n^2+12n)/24
[(n^3+6n^2+12n+8)-4n-8]/24
[(n+2)^3-4(n+2)]/24

And so by induction this counts the total number of 24 piece center
and edge orbits on an even nxnxn super-supercube.

Also for the first test case we can use n=2 instead of n=4, and we get
0 (which is correct) and thus this exponent counts the number of
oribts for the super-supercubes n=2,4,6,8,...

-------------------------

Also the formula on my page is written (n^3-4n+(n mod 2)(-9n+12))/24
which is easy to see is just a combination of the two to make it
easier to write both.

So in case anyone was curious where that came from, or whether it was
correct or not, there's the proof for why I use that particular exponent.

For you math people, do you think it's necessary to include this proof
on the page with the formulas?  Does it seem like something that would
be worth reading?

I would rather try "telekine-not-letting-the-timer-start-and-solve-with-my-hands-free". Sounds easier that way. Or, just try to be the best anyway so it doesn't make sense to cheat. Or just try to have fun, meet other cubers and do what you can. I would rather go the last way...

&gt; 
&gt; With palms flat and the cube placed at least say 20 cm away from the

&gt; Unless using ur nose or something. Which could also be explicitly

&gt; &gt; Hi Lars,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You need to start with the palms flat on the sensors.  In order to 
&gt; get 
&gt; &gt; that position from a palms-down starting position, it would be 
&gt; &gt; necessary to do a weird sliding of the hands...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'll see if I can pull that off.  Let me know if you guys can pull 
&gt; it 
&gt; &gt; off as well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope it's clear what's going on. You can obviously do the same

&gt; &gt; &gt; in a less demonstrative way. If anyone could seriously pull it

&gt; &gt; &gt; a competition is of course an other question, but it wouldn't

    I originaly learned to solve the cube from the solution in the 
booklet that came with it. (BTW i recently bought a new cube, last 
summer, the new booklets are different, i tried the solution and 
could not get it to work) If you would like, i could get the booklet 
and scan the pages and send them to you. Or better yet, give me a 
couple of days, and i can write you a tutorial from these moves that 
will have you solving your cube easy. With the old booklet and a lot 
of practice, it could solve the cube in under 3 min on average, but i 
wanted to be faster, so i found a speedcubing solution. It took about 
4 hours the first time, but i got it. I currently average aroung 77 
sec on this method (a thank you to Gilles Roux). 

Give me about 4-5 days and it will create an html file w/ pics that 
will show you a very easy way to solve the cube.

&gt; Hey bro,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a total beginner.  I can only solve one side.  That's it.  It's 
&gt; been that way for about 18 years.  3.5 years ago I suddenly got 
cube 
&gt; crazy.  My roommates friend was visiting and solved the cube I had 
on 
&gt; the shelf.  It took him about 3 minutes.  I almost shit my pants. 
He 
&gt; gave me 2 minutes worth of instructions.  I couldn't remember it so 
&gt; he wrote down all this code on a piece of paper.  Didn't help.
&gt; So I said screw it.  Bout 2 years ago I decided I was gonna learn 
how 
&gt; to solve this S.O.B.  Went on the internet.  Went to all the sites, 
&gt; none of them helped.  I read the instructions slowly.  I still was 
&gt; blown away.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm convinced that the only way to solve the cube is to have 
somebody 
&gt; actually show you in person.  Like a Rubik's Cube coach or teacher.
&gt; 
&gt; I challenge you and your tutorial.  You can experiment on me.  I 
have 
&gt; a college degree and am stumped by the rubik's cube.  I'll go check 
&gt; out your website.  If it doesn't help then I'm gonna hire someone, 
&gt; actually pay someone to teach me how to solve it.  I'm tired of 
only 
&gt; being able to do one side.

&gt; &gt; Hello everyone,

&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have almost written all the notes for my Beginners Tutorial on 
&gt; solving
&gt; &gt; Rubik's Cube. While there are many decent webpages detailing 
expert
&gt; &gt; solutions, there are none which really give a detailed account 
for 
&gt; beginners
&gt; &gt; (apart from Jasmine's wonderful beginner page which was the 
&gt; inspiration for
&gt; &gt; this tutorial).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would love it if a few of you could pretend to be beginners, or 
&gt; maybe some
&gt; &gt; real beginners will have a go too, and go through my solution and 
&gt; see if it
&gt; &gt; is readable. It was a lot of work making these notes, but I hope 
&gt; that they
&gt; &gt; will prove to be useful for beginners in the years to come :-) 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Like I said, they are almost complete, I have to add the 
finishing 
&gt; touches
&gt; &gt; still (there are always little things to change!)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can find the notes at http://www.cubestation.co.uk

    I agree.  Some sort of criteria should be set.  I
figured this comfortable pace for myself:

100 cubes in 50 minutes, and a 10 minute break on
every hour.  And then perhaps a few 20-30 minute
breaks for lunch and dinner.  

Just my 2 cents

&gt; So... my thoughts on the 24-hour cube marathon.  I
&gt; myself really do 
&gt; want to make an attempt at this and I'll do it when
&gt; I have time and 
&gt; when I can find a good venue with some publicity. 
&gt; If there is someone 
&gt; out there who wants to try it and you're really
&gt; serious about it, I'd 
&gt; like to propose some audition criteria.  I'm not
&gt; going to gather a team 
&gt; to scramble cubes for you for 24 hours if you don't
&gt; have a reasonable 
&gt; chance of breaking that record.  Therefore, I really
&gt; recommend that you 
&gt; solve 120 cubes in an hour before you even think
&gt; about anything else.
&gt; 
&gt; Sure, 120 cubes in an hour is well over the pace
&gt; necessary to do 2000 
&gt; in 24 but when you count in fatigue, yeah, you'll be
&gt; "crawling" at hour 
&gt; 18.  Not to mention bathroom breaks.

&gt; &gt; Yeah, I agree too :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Though I'd like to mention this page which also
&gt; collects/summarizes
&gt; &gt; our official records:
&gt; &gt; http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/rubik.html
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think at least many of those records also made
&gt; it into this "book of
&gt; &gt; alternative records":
&gt; &gt; http://www.alternativerecords.co.uk/
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think Ralf Laue is involved in both the webpage
&gt; and the book and
&gt; &gt; he's a cuber himself, which is obviously a good
&gt; sign :-)

&gt; What's going on here?  There's this site and they're posting up the 
&gt; WCA's recognized records, and what are they doing?  I'm upset because 
&gt; they have listed Chun Hei as being from China instead of being from 
&gt; Hong Kong. 

Dear Tyson,

as you certainly know, Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of
the People's Republic of China.

I have changed the entry in the list anyway, because in other sports
Hong Kong did also compete as a separate team. (In the 2004 Olympics
the team was called "Hong Kong, China").

In general, I believe that it is the best policy to associate the name
of the country as recognized by the UN. (Hong Kong may be a special
case, I agree that it is a good idea to follow the policy of the IOC).
In another e-mail you write: "It is of my opinion that if someone says
they are from Hong Kong, then I will honor that request."
My advice is to be careful with this. What will be your decision if
someone says:
- I want to represent Montenegro, not "Serbia and Montenegro"
- I want to represent Quebec, not Canada
etc.?

&gt;   My feeling is if you're going to post our records, you need to post 
&gt; our records without altering them.

I do not post "your records", I post the best results reported from
Rubik's cube events. I did so long before WCA existed.

Well, I think that I will stop updating the "sub-20" list somewhen in
the future and just publish record progress lists, because all the
information is available at speedcubing.com as well. (It would be a
good idea to include a all-time ranking there.)

Final remark:
If you are upset about something on a web site, it is usually a good
idea to contact the maintainer of this site instead of complaining in
a mailing list.

    Dear Ralf,

I understand I should be careful and I said that we should honor the 
request for Hong Kong because it is Hong Kong and not just any area in 
the world.  Hong Kong, as you said, has its own sports team in the 
Olympics.  Not that the IOC is what we base things on, but it gives us 
an idea that even though Hong Kong is now a part of China, there are 
other organizations in this world which believes it still warrants its 
own team.

My main issue with this is that whereas it is true you are posting 
sub-20 times achieved in Rubik's Cube events and you have done so 
before the WCA was created, records obtained at WCA tournaments should 
be on some level considered property of the WCA.  Changing what we list 
as a 'country' or 'representative region' is no different than changing 
the time itself.  It is misrepresenting the nature of the record 
itself.  Of course, more people would complain if the time were 
changed, but I feel the need that what we write is not altered.  It 
would have been nice for someone to tell us that they were going to 
list it as "China" before doing so.  You raise a very sensitive issue 
by changing "Hong Kong" to "China" and to disagree with what was 
originally set can only bring about political conflict which has no 
place in the cubing world.

I want to represent Quebec and not Canada is not the same type of 
argument as Hong Kong vs. China.  It is necessary to consider the 
viewpoints and political situations of the parts of the world which we 
deal with, and in the case of the WCA, it is an international 
phenomenon.  Tensions are very high between different places in certain 
parts of the world.  It is very difficult to keep everyone happy and by 
no means possible.  However, by changing "Hong Kong" to "China", you 
risk insulting many people who have strong political beliefs about the 
subject.  We, of course, entertain the possibility of keeping it as 
"China" as opposed to "Hong Kong".  However, this issue was not raised 
to us prior to the posting on your website.

I believe that we have the foremost authority in the events we hold.  
Unfortunately, this is not obvious to the world currently because we 
lack certain resources to manage everything.  Therefore, in order to 
preserve the unity of the cubing community, I ask that information that 
we post is kept as it is for consistency and uniformity.  If we had a 
professional website, which I know we will soon, I would not care as 
much.  People would go around to various websites, look, and they would 
see ours and know its the official one.  We are not there today so I 
plead for your cooperation.

Perhaps writing what I wrote before was not the most tactful thing and 
I apologize for that.  However, it is vital that the issue I present, 
because of the possibility of future occurrences, be heard by everyone 
in the community.  We all come from different backgrounds and are 
generally disinterested in the politics of people far removed from 
ourselves.  However, we are now an international community and we must 
exercise sensitivity in these issues.  A member of the United States 
media bowed to the queen of England in during a visit.  This act 
angered many Americans because the country was founded on the principal 
that the United States does not recognize democracy.  Such a simple 
act, and such a hostile response.  I hope in the future you take into 
consideration that a few characters on a flashing CRT screen can cause 
international uproar.

I hadn't heard about the bowing to the queen thing.  Of course here in
England we risk beheading if we don't but I would have thought an American
journalist would know better!

I won't comment on the HK/China thing.  Sounds to me like you're both

&gt; &gt; In general, I believe that it is the best policy to associate the name
&gt; &gt; of the country as recognized by the UN. (Hong Kong may be a special
&gt; &gt; case, I agree that it is a good idea to follow the policy of the IOC).
&gt; &gt; In another e-mail you write: "It is of my opinion that if someone says
&gt; &gt; they are from Hong Kong, then I will honor that request."
&gt; &gt; My advice is to be careful with this. What will be your decision if
&gt; &gt; someone says:
&gt; &gt; - I want to represent Montenegro, not "Serbia and Montenegro"
&gt; &gt; - I want to represent Quebec, not Canada
&gt; &gt; etc.?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I do not post "your records", I post the best results reported from
&gt; &gt; Rubik's cube events. I did so long before WCA existed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, I think that I will stop updating the "sub-20" list somewhen in
&gt; &gt; the future and just publish record progress lists, because all the
&gt; &gt; information is available at speedcubing.com as well. (It would be a
&gt; &gt; good idea to include a all-time ranking there.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Final remark:
&gt; &gt; If you are upset about something on a web site, it is usually a good
&gt; &gt; idea to contact the maintainer of this site instead of complaining in
&gt; &gt; a mailing list.

    Recently on this group, questions about color schemes appeared again.
I have one that is related to scrambles, sorry if an answer has
already been written somewhere.

In competitions, scrambles are generated by a computer.
It gives a sequence of moves that reaches a certain cube configuration.
-----&gt; Should this sequence be applied starting always with the same
cube orientation (same colors)?

Of course, God (the guy/girl who solves cubes optimally) does not care
about it.
But I think it's a good thing, because of two reasons:
- If competitors use the same technique (if they start with a white
cross for example), they should have the same chances.
- It makes easier for judges to check for the validity of the scrambling.

An official color scheme would become mandatory.

&gt; Hey bro,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a total beginner.  I can only solve one side.  That's it.  It's 
&gt; been that way for about 18 years.  3.5 years ago I suddenly got 
cube 
&gt; crazy.  My roommates friend was visiting and solved the cube I had 
on 
&gt; the shelf.  It took him about 3 minutes.  I almost shit my pants. 
He 
&gt; gave me 2 minutes worth of instructions.  I couldn't remember it so 
&gt; he wrote down all this code on a piece of paper.  Didn't help.
&gt; So I said screw it.  Bout 2 years ago I decided I was gonna learn 
how 
&gt; to solve this S.O.B.  Went on the internet.  Went to all the sites, 
&gt; none of them helped.  I read the instructions slowly.  I still was 
&gt; blown away.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm convinced that the only way to solve the cube is to have 
somebody 
&gt; actually show you in person.  Like a Rubik's Cube coach or teacher.
&gt; 
&gt; I challenge you and your tutorial.  You can experiment on me.  I 
have 
&gt; a college degree and am stumped by the rubik's cube.  I'll go check 
&gt; out your website.  If it doesn't help then I'm gonna hire someone, 
&gt; actually pay someone to teach me how to solve it.  I'm tired of 
only 
&gt; being able to do one side.

&gt; &gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have almost written all the notes for my Beginners Tutorial on 
&gt; solving
&gt; &gt; Rubik's Cube. While there are many decent webpages detailing 
expert
&gt; &gt; solutions, there are none which really give a detailed account 
for 
&gt; beginners
&gt; &gt; (apart from Jasmine's wonderful beginner page which was the 
&gt; inspiration for
&gt; &gt; this tutorial).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would love it if a few of you could pretend to be beginners, or 
&gt; maybe some
&gt; &gt; real beginners will have a go too, and go through my solution and 
&gt; see if it
&gt; &gt; is readable. It was a lot of work making these notes, but I hope 
&gt; that they
&gt; &gt; will prove to be useful for beginners in the years to come :-) 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Like I said, they are almost complete, I have to add the 
finishing 
&gt; touches
&gt; &gt; still (there are always little things to change!)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can find the notes at http://www.cubestation.co.uk
&gt; &gt; &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/&gt;  and click on the Link in the red 
&gt; panel
&gt; &gt; which says UEA Cube Club.

Does anyone have a good way of recognizing COLL or is there a good

    It's very easy, just compare the colours on the corner stickers (not your
top layer colour), for the positions shown at
www.cubestation.co.uk/coll/coll.html

 

If you see a pair of stickers, call that colour the front colour, and relate
all the other colours to it. That's what the 4 letter code means. Also check
out Lars' COLL page which has colours to go with the letters, so you can see
which patterns have adjacently coloured pairs and oppositely coloured pairs
and similarly coloured pairs.

 

It's very easy :)

    Hey Tyson,

I definitely do the COLL recognition a different way from the standard
method.

A good example is the alg: U' L' R U R' U' L U2' R U2 R'

On Dan's site it's listed as 
RB
FF

where this points to the stickers (the first letter denotes the
particular sticker on that piece) 
UFL UBR
FUL UFR

but the way I recognize this is by a name.  I call it "vertical same".

This comes from the stickers (again the first letter is the particular
sticker on that piece)

LBU &lt;-&gt; UFL are opposite colors (a vertical row as I see it)
UBR &lt;-&gt; UFR are opposite colors (also a vertical row as I see it)
FUL &lt;-&gt; UFR are the same color (hence the "same" part of "vertical same")

Again I'm sure all the other COLL users would argue that my system is
much slower and requires more recognition, but I have become quite
comfortable in using it and can identify the cases very quickly.

Basically for the cases I look at all the stickers on the FUL corner
(ignoring the top color really) and the two visible stickers on the
BUL corner as well as the UFR corner.  Also you can see one sticker of
UBR.  I use all that to identify the case.

After reading Dan's statement, I'm sure most would think my way is
slower :-D but I like it.

Also one pro for this recognition method is that I can also recognize
most all of the cases with the cube rotated by U' or U (still working
on U2, I can only do that on very few of the cases).

Just my humble two cents of course,
Chris

    Sorry, I haven't really put this into words before.

I just thought of a better way to describe what I do.  Using all the
stickers I can see I look only for opposite colored groups (of two
stickers) and same colored groups (again of two stickers) and how they
are arranged.  I find this helps for solving on another cross color
too, since I don't know what is to the right or left of certain colors
for half of the orientations of the cube.

So basically look only for pairs of opposite and like colored
stickers, all the patterns are very distinct from eachother and I gave
them names to help recall them when speedsolving.

Hope that makes things clearer,
Chris

    I might be able to make it to Michigan in the summer, since my
girlfriend is from Michigan.  Depending on the circumstances, I might
be able to make it.  I would definitly try.

Also, the last time I was up there visiting my gf's mother, she said
she had a newspaper article about you Jon.  She couldn't find it at
the time, but I figured I had already read it on your page.  She
thought it was funny that I had read an article from a Michigan paper
probably before she did.  I told her the cube isn't a toy, its a
lifestyle.  :)

    Hey Chris,

 

Although you say your way may be slower, I think that you still use the same
tricks as me to recognise the case. 

 

When you are first learning the cases, you have to have a way to uniquely
and easily identify each case, this is where the 4 letter codes come in. But
once you become fluent, like you are, then you can start to see shortcuts in
the recognition step, like just seeing where the same coloured stickers are
in the pattern of four, or whether there is something like an "opposite X"
(where you might have Blue - Blue from top left to bottom right, and Green -
Green from top right to bottom left). This is by far (in my opinion) the
quickest way to recognise these sorts of cases :) but you can only really
start to implement it once you have gotten a complete hang of the COLL, and
to get this you must first be able to use something like the 4 letter code!

 

Dan :)

Hey Tyson,

I definitely do the COLL recognition a different way from the standard
method.

A good example is the alg: U' L' R U R' U' L U2' R U2 R'

On Dan's site it's listed as 
RB
FF

where this points to the stickers (the first letter denotes the
particular sticker on that piece) 
UFL UBR
FUL UFR

but the way I recognize this is by a name.  I call it "vertical same".

This comes from the stickers (again the first letter is the particular
sticker on that piece)

LBU &lt;-&gt; UFL are opposite colors (a vertical row as I see it)
UBR &lt;-&gt; UFR are opposite colors (also a vertical row as I see it)
FUL &lt;-&gt; UFR are the same color (hence the "same" part of "vertical same")

Again I'm sure all the other COLL users would argue that my system is
much slower and requires more recognition, but I have become quite
comfortable in using it and can identify the cases very quickly.

Basically for the cases I look at all the stickers on the FUL corner
(ignoring the top color really) and the two visible stickers on the
BUL corner as well as the UFR corner.  Also you can see one sticker of
UBR.  I use all that to identify the case.

After reading Dan's statement, I'm sure most would think my way is
slower :-D but I like it.

Also one pro for this recognition method is that I can also recognize
most all of the cases with the cube rotated by U' or U (still working
on U2, I can only do that on very few of the cases).

Chris

    ...actually, I compiled it that way and got a runtime error.  
Perhaps you could explain why?...  I decided to use the code from

    public static int readInteger() {

		return Integer.parseInt(s);
            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
		System.out.print("That is not an integer.  Enter 
again: ");
            } catch (IOException e) {
		// should never happen
            }
	}
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = readInteger();

    Hi Gilles,

It is something that we have discussed for quite a bit actually.  If 
competitors do use the same technique, then they should have the same 
chances.  This is of course correct.  Currently, the procedure that we 
follow is that we ask the competitor for their "top" color.  We don't 
say anything else.  We do not say "cross" or anything because that 
would bias one method or another.  If a competitor asks, "Well, do you 
mean cross?" I just say, "Whatever you want."  It's up to the 
competitor to decide what they want their top color to be.

If the competitor requests a front color, we honor that request.  This 
request is definitely made in blindfold cubing when competitors are 
used to solving the cube with certain colors in front of them.

The idea of giving people "same chances" is only loosely followed.  We 
know that when people make cross differently, even from the same 
starting position, it can totally change the rest of the solve.  As for 
the judges to check the validity of the scrambling, it is not the 
judge's job to check the validity of the scrambling.  It is the 
scrambler's job to check the validity of the scrambling.  I must stress 
the fact that the "top" color varies though because it would not be 
fair for competitors to be biased with one type of "top" color.  
Scramblers should be able to check the validity of the scrambling by 
translating the colors if necessary.

Official color schemes are not mandatory because we would never be able 
to consolidate the Japanese color scheme and the other color scheme.  
Furthermore, we would have to ask the manufacturers to unify their 
color scheme as well which really isn't in our control.

&gt; I have one that is related to scrambles, sorry if an answer has

&gt;
&gt; In competitions, scrambles are generated by a computer.
&gt; It gives a sequence of moves that reaches a certain cube configuration.
&gt; -----&gt; Should this sequence be applied starting always with the same
&gt; cube orientation (same colors)?
&gt;
&gt; Of course, God (the guy/girl who solves cubes optimally) does not care
&gt; about it.
&gt; But I think it's a good thing, because of two reasons:
&gt; - If competitors use the same technique (if they start with a white
&gt; cross for example), they should have the same chances.
&gt; - It makes easier for judges to check for the validity of the 
&gt; scrambling.
&gt;
&gt; An official color scheme would become mandatory.

    Hi everyone,

First, thanks to everyone here for all the valuable feedback during 
the last few months of design and construction of the Rubik's timer.  
As everyone knows, there is a valid debate on whether to keep using 
the SpeedStacks timer in official competitions, or to switch over to 
the new timer for official competitions, when it becomes available.  
Both sides of this debate have merit.

Whether or not the new timer is accepted in official tournaments is 
of course not up to me.  Rather, it is up to everyone here in the 
speedcubing community.  In all probability, SevenTowns will be 
persuaded to go along with whatever the majority of speedcubers on 
this Yahoo message board want.  I encourage everyone to give careful 
thought to the subject, because I believe the people here will 
ultimately be the deciding factor.

I would like to speak about the possibility that a competitor 
might "cheat" by making a "U" move before lifting the cube, or after 
stopping the timer.  This is a valid argument and there is no perfect 
solution to this problem.  Many people will no doubt disagree 
completely with my thoughts below, but I offer them more as a 
possibility to open more discussion and ideas.

I feel the most certain way to eliminate making a "U" move before 
timing starts is to rule that if a competitor makes his first move 
within 10 centimeters of the puzzle pad, then his first move cannot 
be parallel to the horizontal plane.  That is, after pre-inspection, 
it is up to the competitor to place the cube on the puzzle-pad in 
such an orientation that his first move is not horizontal.  A non-
horizontal move will force the cube off the puzzle pad before the 
move is barely begun.  A judge can easily determine if the first move 
is horizontal if the first move is made within 10 cm of the pad.

As for making a "U", "M", or "D" move *after* the cube is back on the 
pad and timing has stopped, I think this is very difficult, if not 
impossible, to do when making moves at high speed.  I encourage 
everyone to try the following experiment:  Do the moves U' R on a 
solved cube, so that the finger-trick R' U will solve the cube¬óthis 
is the ideal finish that might allow the competitor to "cheat" on the 
last U move.  Now hold the cube about 1 cm above a table, and try to 
perform R' U, while simultaneously making the "D" face completely 
rest on the table after R' but before U.  As you attempt this at top 
speed, it becomes nearly impossible to make the entire "D" face rest 
on the table before performing the U move.

Obviously, the possibilities that I describe above are not perfect; 
they are flawed.  I do not believe a perfect solution exists.  The 
SpeedStacks timer itself is flawed, and its flaws are currently 
accepted as a part of speed-cubing.  In the end, I hope the 
speedcubing community as a whole will decide which timing method has 
fewer flaws with the lowest impact on tournament competition.

Thanks again for everyone's support,
-eric

    Hi Eric,

I feel that such a rule would be infringing on the competitor's freedom 
to solve the cube.  Furthermore, judging 10 cm would be very difficult. 
  From a tournament organizer's standpoint, it would be a nightmare to 
put these regulations into effect.

Why wasn't the timer built with hand pads like the StackMat?  Why did 
you decide to use an optical sensor?

    To make things equal for everybody, you could put some sort of 
square, outlined in tape or something on the mat for the puzzle to 
be placed in before the solve.  This would ensure that the puzzle is 
the same distance from every competitor at the start of the time.

Furthermore, I also like the idea of using hand pads over an optical 
sensor.  I am also opposed to restricting the first move on the 
puzzle.  I don't believe cheating is a major problem.  It should be 
pretty clear whether or not time has started when the competitor 
begins solving the puzzle.  After all, there is somebody watching 
him, and that judge is responsible for paying attention to only that 
competitor.  So, the judge can focus completely on the hands of the 
competitor, and since the Stackmat has the blinking lights feature, 
it should be relatively easy to see whether or not the lights are 
blinking during the competitor's first move.

    That's what I've been thinking. To take it a bit further you could put 
a sensor  in the area, very much like the Rubiks Timer and combine both 
approaches. That way you know the cube and the hands are in different 
places both when the timer stops and when it starts.

It's probably not necessary, but if you want something that's above 
every suspicion, it's the way to go.

    There was a consensus in 2003 that StackMats were unnatural for
speedcubing. In particular, it is unnatural for a cubist to not be
holding onto the cube at the beginning of the solve, and it is unnatural
to have to drop the cube at the end of the solve to get the fastest
time. Not to mention that the StackMat measures the time it takes to
move your hands to and from the cube, which is not really a part of the
activity of speedcubing.

The fact that you can get used to using a StackMat still does not make
the StackMat natural for speedcubing. I would like something that
allowed me to hold onto the cube at the beginning and not drop it at the
end.

Eric, I like the timing device you have designed. It is more natural for
speedcubing than the StackMat is, and will also measure faster and more
accurate times. However, as others have pointed out, it is possible to
cheat with your device, by performing untimed U-turns and D-turns for
free at the end. When you place your cube against one flat surface at
the end of the solve, this prevents you from turning only 4 of the 6
sides of the cube. However, if you place your cube against two
perpendicular flat surfaces at the end of the solve, this prevents you
from turning all 6 sides of the cube.

Is it possible to incorporate a second perpendicular surface into your
design? This surface could stand behind the cube should be less than the
width of the cube so that your fingers can grip the rear side of the
cube when picking it up and placing it down. The sensor can be placed at
the edge between the two surfaces.

On second thought, this standing surface need not be flat. It can curve
away from the cube on the left and right sides, leaving room for the
fingers. For example, it could be a standing cylinder. This has the
additional benefit of providing no sharp edges to hurt your fingers on.

&gt; I would like to speak about the possibility that a competitor

Just a thought... Would it be hard to add a sensor on a second flat
surface? Look at the picture: http://grrroux.free.fr/2flat.jpg

I understand that the enclosure would become rather thick, but this
would solve 2 problems:
- The U/E/D turn before/after.
- It ensures the cube really is a cube, the problem with "2 sec"
penalties disappears.

Such a device would work with big cubes too, but not with some other
exotic puzzle.
I think you still can pick up the cube rather naturally.

    Hi Ryan,

I do not agree with you on this one. There has never been a consensus that 
StackMats were unnatural for speedcubing. At least I wasn't part of that 
consensus. :-)
In fact I would dare to claim that without StackMat there wouldn't have been 
as many tourmanents as there have been recently.
I also dare to claim that more than half of the competitors don't bother 
much about the timers, as long as the competition is fair. It is only a few 
people (some of them have never been to a tournament, some have never 
touched a StackMat!) who are discussing this subject. During Euro2004 we did 
not have a single complaint about the timers. There was one case where the 
timer didn't stop because the competitor didn't touch both pads at the same 
time.

I would like to compare this discussion to the 100 meter dash. We all start 
after the gun shot. But reaction time is included and also the acceleration 
time. There are much better ways to measure the true 100 meter dash running 
time. I think StackMat gives us better time measurement than athletics 
timers.

My main problems with StackMat are the price and the ugly mat. The old 
version also has problems with durability (dropping gives pits).
The new version can have a separate mat, so that we can also make a mat 
specifically for speedcubing (nice WCA logo maybe?).
The price of StackMat will drop once speedstacks.com doesn't have a monopoly 
anymore.
Although StackMat also lacks functionality (like generating scrambles or 
taking averages), I do not think this is an issue for competitions until all 
timing devices are connected to a central computer. In which case the 
central computer could also provide that functionality.
For home use StackMat indeed lacks that functionality. But at home anyone 
can decide what timer he/she uses. (Who has an official athletics timer at 
home?)

The device you propose is an interesting one, but even such a device has 
some awkward issues.
If picking up the cube is a problem for StackMat, then picking will also be 
a problem for the new timer. Same goes for stopping it.

No, I do not have Speedstacks.com shares. I am just conservative and proud 
of it. :-)
StackMat has been the recent standard for competitions. It works great!
We have a great timer to compare competitors. The extra time for picking up 
and putting down the cube is very low.
People are enjoying speedcubing. Speedcubing meetings have been full of 
friendship and fun. And a great timer for the official stuff.
Even though there may be better ways to measure the times, I think there are 
hardly better ways to minimize cheating or at least avoid discussions 
afterwards.

Have fun,

Ron

&gt; Hi Gilles,
&gt; 
&gt; It is something that we have discussed for quite a bit actually.  If 
&gt; competitors do use the same technique, then they should have the same 
&gt; chances.  This is of course correct.  Currently, the procedure that we 
&gt; follow is that we ask the competitor for their "top" color.  We don't 
&gt; say anything else.  We do not say "cross" or anything because that 
&gt; would bias one method or another.  If a competitor asks, "Well, do you 
&gt; mean cross?" I just say, "Whatever you want."  It's up to the 
&gt; competitor to decide what they want their top color to be.
&gt; 
&gt; If the competitor requests a front color, we honor that request.  This 
&gt; request is definitely made in blindfold cubing when competitors are 
&gt; used to solving the cube with certain colors in front of them.
&gt; 

I'm reading your comment for the third time, but I still can't imagine
why someone would tell the scramblers to choose a given color or
another, unless he knows what the scrambling sequence does(!).
The only thing that matters is what centers will be on top/front when
the inspection begins (and in my opinion these centers should not be
decided by anyone, only by a computer, scrambling sequences could
include slice moves). By the way, I know that some record breakers in
the "no inspection" category use this cheat. Of course they don't see
it as a cheat, they think that a 3x3x3 has no centers because they're
considered fixed in the scrambling sequence and in their way of solving.
With a 15-sec long inspection, it does not matter.

&gt; The idea of giving people "same chances" is only loosely followed.  We 
&gt; know that when people make cross differently, even from the same 
&gt; starting position, it can totally change the rest of the solve.

If an Extended Cross (TM) based on white can be reached within 3
moves, I bet most of good F2L cubers starting with white (i.e. most of
top speedcubers) will choose it.

&gt; As for 
&gt; the judges to check the validity of the scrambling, it is not the 
&gt; judge's job to check the validity of the scrambling.  It is the 
&gt; scrambler's job to check the validity of the scrambling.

Ok, the scrambler judges the validity of the scrambling, so he/she is
another judge.

&gt; I must stress 
&gt; the fact that the "top" color varies though because it would not be 
&gt; fair for competitors to be biased with one type of "top" color.  
&gt; Scramblers should be able to check the validity of the scrambling by 
&gt; translating the colors if necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; Official color schemes are not mandatory because we would never be able 
&gt; to consolidate the Japanese color scheme and the other color scheme.  
&gt; Furthermore, we would have to ask the manufacturers to unify their 
&gt; color scheme as well which really isn't in our control.
&gt; 

Of course, I'm not asking you for miracles.

I just wanted to raise a problem that has a significant importance
when choosing a winner with only 5 times (not the winner, sorry, the
one who comes after SuperMacky).
It's like a changing wind during a long jump competition. But there
are still jumpers who have fun practicing their sport :-)

    Hey Ryan,

.....
&gt; and it is unnatural
&gt; to have to drop the cube at the end of the solve to get the fastest
&gt; time.
...

With a little practice you can avoid having to drop the cube, yet 
still stop the timer quickly.  I even asked Tyson about my technique 
(I'm sure others do the same thing too) at the 2004 US competition 
and he said there was no problem with it.

What I do is to continue holding the cube as I move my hands to the 
timer.  That way the cube hits the table just as your hands hit the 
timer pads, so it satisfies the WCA rules in that the cube is on the 
table as your hands stop the timter, however your hands bring the 
cube to the table (which is faster than gravity alone btw, so it is 
even faster than dropping).

I just wanted to mention that this flaw in the stackmat can be 
overcome with practice on a stackmat.  This has its own problem in 
that people who can't afford stackmats can't practice this.

Maybe just before the rounds start at a competition, when stackmats 
are provided for people to practice, this technique should be shown 
by the judges to those who aren't used to the mat?  I think that 
could help with people who are afraid of dropping.

Just a thought,
Chris

    Hi friends,

I would like to add to this discussion that already in Toronto, people could 
tell which color they wanted to use.
Since the first round took a looong time (there was even a break of one 
night!), people heard from other competitors whether cube x had a tough 
cross when using your normal color. In fact I heard Janosz say that he 
figured out some extra hard scrambles (no random scrambles???).
Anyways, there were a lot of competitors not choosing their normal starting 
color, because that would mean a tough cross for some cubes.

To prevent this you have to choose the color BEFORE the competition starts. 
That said, it is still possible to choose a different color than your normal 
color. Not to mention that different systems means different scrambles being 
easier or not.

My conclusion is:
= we must have the same scrambles
= we must have the color chosen before the competition
But only to have good scrambles and no discussion like "his/her scramble was 
easier than mine".
Not to have the same difficulty for all competitors and all systems.

Have fun,

Ron

&gt;&gt; Hi Gilles,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is something that we have discussed for quite a bit actually.  If
&gt;&gt; competitors do use the same technique, then they should have the same
&gt;&gt; chances.  This is of course correct.  Currently, the procedure that we
&gt;&gt; follow is that we ask the competitor for their "top" color.  We don't
&gt;&gt; say anything else.  We do not say "cross" or anything because that
&gt;&gt; would bias one method or another.  If a competitor asks, "Well, do you
&gt;&gt; mean cross?" I just say, "Whatever you want."  It's up to the
&gt;&gt; competitor to decide what they want their top color to be.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If the competitor requests a front color, we honor that request.  This
&gt;&gt; request is definitely made in blindfold cubing when competitors are
&gt;&gt; used to solving the cube with certain colors in front of them.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'm reading your comment for the third time, but I still can't imagine
&gt; why someone would tell the scramblers to choose a given color or
&gt; another, unless he knows what the scrambling sequence does(!).
&gt; The only thing that matters is what centers will be on top/front when
&gt; the inspection begins (and in my opinion these centers should not be
&gt; decided by anyone, only by a computer, scrambling sequences could
&gt; include slice moves). By the way, I know that some record breakers in
&gt; the "no inspection" category use this cheat. Of course they don't see
&gt; it as a cheat, they think that a 3x3x3 has no centers because they're
&gt; considered fixed in the scrambling sequence and in their way of solving.
&gt; With a 15-sec long inspection, it does not matter.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The idea of giving people "same chances" is only loosely followed.  We
&gt;&gt; know that when people make cross differently, even from the same
&gt;&gt; starting position, it can totally change the rest of the solve.
&gt;
&gt; If an Extended Cross (TM) based on white can be reached within 3
&gt; moves, I bet most of good F2L cubers starting with white (i.e. most of
&gt; top speedcubers) will choose it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; As for
&gt;&gt; the judges to check the validity of the scrambling, it is not the
&gt;&gt; judge's job to check the validity of the scrambling.  It is the
&gt;&gt; scrambler's job to check the validity of the scrambling.
&gt;
&gt; Ok, the scrambler judges the validity of the scrambling, so he/she is
&gt; another judge.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I must stress
&gt;&gt; the fact that the "top" color varies though because it would not be
&gt;&gt; fair for competitors to be biased with one type of "top" color.
&gt;&gt; Scramblers should be able to check the validity of the scrambling by
&gt;&gt; translating the colors if necessary.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Official color schemes are not mandatory because we would never be able
&gt;&gt; to consolidate the Japanese color scheme and the other color scheme.
&gt;&gt; Furthermore, we would have to ask the manufacturers to unify their
&gt;&gt; color scheme as well which really isn't in our control.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Of course, I'm not asking you for miracles.
&gt;
&gt; I just wanted to raise a problem that has a significant importance
&gt; when choosing a winner with only 5 times (not the winner, sorry, the
&gt; one who comes after SuperMacky).
&gt; It's like a changing wind during a long jump competition. But there
&gt; are still jumpers who have fun practicing their sport :-)

    Good points Ron. I sceamble the cube with white on top and red in 
front. but you probably scramble differently.  Of course even I find 
that different scrambles harder then some others. I think this would 
be true of anyone. That being said I agree that a starting top color 
has to be decided before any competition, and to make it even more 
fair to everyone, a different color be used for every scramble. Of 
course these would never be given to the competitors. I think this 
would make it fair for all concerned.

    Hi Everyone,

Just to clarify what I do at my tournaments:

The scrambles are pre-generated using a computer.  They come with 
little diagrams that allow you to check the states of the scramble cube 
but I do not look at them until the day of the tournament.  If one of 
the scrambles is "easy" for anyone, oh well, I do not do anything about 
it.  You guys got lucky, it was random, and fine, that's the end of it.

At the beginning of the tournament, you mark down what your top and 
front (if desired) colors are and that remains throughout the entire 
tournament.

All of this is done to put some control into the fairness of the 
scramble without taking into any consideration of method or anything.  
We all know that there's no such thing as an easy "case" unless you 
have a bunch of pieces solved because every method is different and you 
will have different sets of cases depending on how you approach the 
cube given the same method.

Here's a funny story you might like to hear.  I was discussing records 
for the April 2004 tournament and I told one person that "a single 
solve record is meaningless because eventually someone is going to get 
lucky and they'll set the record at 8 seconds and no one will be able 
to break it in ages!"  This guy's response to me was, "Nonsense!  The 
scrambles at the [tournament] were all calculated so that there would 
be no lucky cases!"

I mean... seriously... that just shows complete and utter lack of 
everything true and beautiful to the cube... but anyway, on a random 
note, waking up at 2:30 PM is divine.

&gt; I would like to add to this discussion that already in Toronto, people 
&gt; could
&gt; tell which color they wanted to use.
&gt; Since the first round took a looong time (there was even a break of one
&gt; night!), people heard from other competitors whether cube x had a tough
&gt; cross when using your normal color. In fact I heard Janosz say that he
&gt; figured out some extra hard scrambles (no random scrambles???).
&gt; Anyways, there were a lot of competitors not choosing their normal 
&gt; starting
&gt; color, because that would mean a tough cross for some cubes.
&gt;
&gt; To prevent this you have to choose the color BEFORE the competition 
&gt; starts.
&gt; That said, it is still possible to choose a different color than your 
&gt; normal
&gt; color. Not to mention that different systems means different scrambles 
&gt; being
&gt; easier or not.
&gt;
&gt; My conclusion is:
&gt; = we must have the same scrambles
&gt; = we must have the color chosen before the competition
&gt; But only to have good scrambles and no discussion like "his/her 
&gt; scramble was
&gt; easier than mine".
&gt; Not to have the same difficulty for all competitors and all systems.
&gt;
&gt; Have fun,
&gt;
&gt; Ron

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Gilles,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is something that we have discussed for quite a bit actually.  If
&gt;&gt;&gt; competitors do use the same technique, then they should have the same
&gt;&gt;&gt; chances.  This is of course correct.  Currently, the procedure that 
&gt;&gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt;&gt; follow is that we ask the competitor for their "top" color.  We don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; say anything else.  We do not say "cross" or anything because that
&gt;&gt;&gt; would bias one method or another.  If a competitor asks, "Well, do 
&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; mean cross?" I just say, "Whatever you want."  It's up to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; competitor to decide what they want their top color to be.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If the competitor requests a front color, we honor that request.  
&gt;&gt;&gt; This
&gt;&gt;&gt; request is definitely made in blindfold cubing when competitors are
&gt;&gt;&gt; used to solving the cube with certain colors in front of them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm reading your comment for the third time, but I still can't imagine
&gt;&gt; why someone would tell the scramblers to choose a given color or
&gt;&gt; another, unless he knows what the scrambling sequence does(!).
&gt;&gt; The only thing that matters is what centers will be on top/front when
&gt;&gt; the inspection begins (and in my opinion these centers should not be
&gt;&gt; decided by anyone, only by a computer, scrambling sequences could
&gt;&gt; include slice moves). By the way, I know that some record breakers in
&gt;&gt; the "no inspection" category use this cheat. Of course they don't see
&gt;&gt; it as a cheat, they think that a 3x3x3 has no centers because they're
&gt;&gt; considered fixed in the scrambling sequence and in their way of 
&gt;&gt; solving.
&gt;&gt; With a 15-sec long inspection, it does not matter.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The idea of giving people "same chances" is only loosely followed.  
&gt;&gt;&gt; We
&gt;&gt;&gt; know that when people make cross differently, even from the same
&gt;&gt;&gt; starting position, it can totally change the rest of the solve.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If an Extended Cross (TM) based on white can be reached within 3
&gt;&gt; moves, I bet most of good F2L cubers starting with white (i.e. most of
&gt;&gt; top speedcubers) will choose it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; As for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the judges to check the validity of the scrambling, it is not the
&gt;&gt;&gt; judge's job to check the validity of the scrambling.  It is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; scrambler's job to check the validity of the scrambling.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ok, the scrambler judges the validity of the scrambling, so he/she is
&gt;&gt; another judge.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I must stress
&gt;&gt;&gt; the fact that the "top" color varies though because it would not be
&gt;&gt;&gt; fair for competitors to be biased with one type of "top" color.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Scramblers should be able to check the validity of the scrambling by
&gt;&gt;&gt; translating the colors if necessary.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Official color schemes are not mandatory because we would never be 
&gt;&gt;&gt; able
&gt;&gt;&gt; to consolidate the Japanese color scheme and the other color scheme.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Furthermore, we would have to ask the manufacturers to unify their
&gt;&gt;&gt; color scheme as well which really isn't in our control.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Of course, I'm not asking you for miracles.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to raise a problem that has a significant importance
&gt;&gt; when choosing a winner with only 5 times (not the winner, sorry, the
&gt;&gt; one who comes after SuperMacky).
&gt;&gt; It's like a changing wind during a long jump competition. But there
&gt;&gt; are still jumpers who have fun practicing their sport :-)

    It's a formality issue.  Because in blindfold cubing, the competitor 
himself has defined a top and a front throughout the entire solve.  I 
mean, when I scramble a cube, I scramble it with yellow on top and 
green in the front.  If I were blindfolding cubing, that's how I would 
want the cube placed in front of me.

If you were to go back and redo your solve, it also makes things easier 
because the scramble orientation would be the same as your solve 
orientation.  It definitely matters very little for the solve but the 
principle of the whole thing... you're given a scramble algorithm and 
if the competitor is going to define things, there's no reason you 
shouldn't do it the same way especially since it won't make a 
difference in the solve.

    Hi Everyone,

We've been using this 100 meter dash example forever by now.  I do not 
believe that the time it takes you to solve a cube is from when you 
first move the cube to when you stop moving the cube.  It's just too 
hard to measure something like that.

I also do not have any shares in StackMat either.  I don't have any 
shares in anything at all.

&gt; Hi Ryan,
&gt;
&gt; I do not agree with you on this one. There has never been a consensus 
&gt; that
&gt; StackMats were unnatural for speedcubing. At least I wasn't part of 
&gt; that
&gt; consensus. :-)
&gt; In fact I would dare to claim that without StackMat there wouldn't 
&gt; have been
&gt; as many tourmanents as there have been recently.
&gt; I also dare to claim that more than half of the competitors don't 
&gt; bother
&gt; much about the timers, as long as the competition is fair. It is only 
&gt; a few
&gt; people (some of them have never been to a tournament, some have never
&gt; touched a StackMat!) who are discussing this subject. During Euro2004 
&gt; we did
&gt; not have a single complaint about the timers. There was one case where 
&gt; the
&gt; timer didn't stop because the competitor didn't touch both pads at the 
&gt; same
&gt; time.
&gt;
&gt; I would like to compare this discussion to the 100 meter dash. We all 
&gt; start
&gt; after the gun shot. But reaction time is included and also the 
&gt; acceleration
&gt; time. There are much better ways to measure the true 100 meter dash 
&gt; running
&gt; time. I think StackMat gives us better time measurement than athletics
&gt; timers.
&gt;
&gt; My main problems with StackMat are the price and the ugly mat. The old
&gt; version also has problems with durability (dropping gives pits).
&gt; The new version can have a separate mat, so that we can also make a mat
&gt; specifically for speedcubing (nice WCA logo maybe?).
&gt; The price of StackMat will drop once speedstacks.com doesn't have a 
&gt; monopoly
&gt; anymore.
&gt; Although StackMat also lacks functionality (like generating scrambles 
&gt; or
&gt; taking averages), I do not think this is an issue for competitions 
&gt; until all
&gt; timing devices are connected to a central computer. In which case the
&gt; central computer could also provide that functionality.
&gt; For home use StackMat indeed lacks that functionality. But at home 
&gt; anyone
&gt; can decide what timer he/she uses. (Who has an official athletics 
&gt; timer at
&gt; home?)
&gt;
&gt; The device you propose is an interesting one, but even such a device 
&gt; has
&gt; some awkward issues.
&gt; If picking up the cube is a problem for StackMat, then picking will 
&gt; also be
&gt; a problem for the new timer. Same goes for stopping it.
&gt;
&gt; No, I do not have Speedstacks.com shares. I am just conservative and 
&gt; proud
&gt; of it. :-)
&gt; StackMat has been the recent standard for competitions. It works great!
&gt; We have a great timer to compare competitors. The extra time for 
&gt; picking up
&gt; and putting down the cube is very low.
&gt; People are enjoying speedcubing. Speedcubing meetings have been full of
&gt; friendship and fun. And a great timer for the official stuff.
&gt; Even though there may be better ways to measure the times, I think 
&gt; there are
&gt; hardly better ways to minimize cheating or at least avoid discussions
&gt; afterwards.
&gt;

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There was a consensus in 2003 that StackMats were unnatural for
&gt;&gt; speedcubing. In particular, it is unnatural for a cubist to not be
&gt;&gt; holding onto the cube at the beginning of the solve, and it is 
&gt;&gt; unnatural
&gt;&gt; to have to drop the cube at the end of the solve to get the fastest
&gt;&gt; time. Not to mention that the StackMat measures the time it takes to
&gt;&gt; move your hands to and from the cube, which is not really a part of 
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; activity of speedcubing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The fact that you can get used to using a StackMat still does not make
&gt;&gt; the StackMat natural for speedcubing. I would like something that
&gt;&gt; allowed me to hold onto the cube at the beginning and not drop it at 
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; end.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Eric, I like the timing device you have designed. It is more natural 
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; speedcubing than the StackMat is, and will also measure faster and 
&gt;&gt; more
&gt;&gt; accurate times. However, as others have pointed out, it is possible to
&gt;&gt; cheat with your device, by performing untimed U-turns and D-turns for
&gt;&gt; free at the end. When you place your cube against one flat surface at
&gt;&gt; the end of the solve, this prevents you from turning only 4 of the 6
&gt;&gt; sides of the cube. However, if you place your cube against two
&gt;&gt; perpendicular flat surfaces at the end of the solve, this prevents you
&gt;&gt; from turning all 6 sides of the cube.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is it possible to incorporate a second perpendicular surface into your
&gt;&gt; design? This surface could stand behind the cube should be less than 
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; width of the cube so that your fingers can grip the rear side of the
&gt;&gt; cube when picking it up and placing it down. The sensor can be placed 
&gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt; the edge between the two surfaces.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; On second thought, this standing surface need not be flat. It can 
&gt;&gt; curve
&gt;&gt; away from the cube on the left and right sides, leaving room for the
&gt;&gt; fingers. For example, it could be a standing cylinder. This has the
&gt;&gt; additional benefit of providing no sharp edges to hurt your fingers 
&gt;&gt; on.

    Hi Gilles,

The person doesn't know what the scrambling sequence is.  It is only 
used as one facet of implementing fairness of the scramble.

Yes, every speed cuber would choose it but none of them would know 
which color it's on (including me) and even if they did know, they 
would have already said which color they wanted and it would be too 
late unless they were willing to risk using a different color which 
usually results and disaster and furthermore, they would be cheating.

The competitors are not allowed to be judges!  Judges need to be 
impartial observes to the competition... it is inappropriate that 
someone involved with a solve judges the solve at the same time.  
There's a reason why I haven't been competing ever and that's part of 
it.

    In short, it all boils down to this.  In a competition, we are not 
looking for the fastest cuber.  In a competition, we are seeing who can 
solve the cube fastest in a competition setting with competition 
pressure under the competition regulations and using the competition 
equipment.

People here say that dropping the cube might cause it to turn once so 
they don't want to use the StackMat.  My suggestion to all of you is to 
buy a StackMat and practice.  If not, during all of the competitions, 
at least the ones I run, the timers are open for people to practice on.

It's the same pretty much for everything.  The 100-meter dash doesn't 
find the fastest runner.  It finds the person able to get from here to 
there given the procedures of the race, the gun shot, the chest pump to 
kill off .01 of a second, and the track, and the shoes.  It would be 
unreasonable for someone to complain that they didn't have a track or a 
gun to practice with.  Get someone to stand there and fire blanks into 
the air so you can practice your reaction time.  Also, go find a track. 
  If it were up to me, fine, I'd love everyone to have a StackMat.  I 
can't provide this to you as the olympic committee can't give their 
runners 100-meters of red track running surface.

&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; With a little practice you can avoid having to drop the cube, yet
&gt; still stop the timer quickly.  I even asked Tyson about my technique
&gt; (I'm sure others do the same thing too) at the 2004 US competition
&gt; and he said there was no problem with it.
&gt;
&gt; What I do is to continue holding the cube as I move my hands to the
&gt; timer.  That way the cube hits the table just as your hands hit the
&gt; timer pads, so it satisfies the WCA rules in that the cube is on the
&gt; table as your hands stop the timter, however your hands bring the
&gt; cube to the table (which is faster than gravity alone btw, so it is
&gt; even faster than dropping).
&gt;
&gt; I just wanted to mention that this flaw in the stackmat can be
&gt; overcome with practice on a stackmat.  This has its own problem in
&gt; that people who can't afford stackmats can't practice this.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe just before the rounds start at a competition, when stackmats
&gt; are provided for people to practice, this technique should be shown
&gt; by the judges to those who aren't used to the mat?  I think that
&gt; could help with people who are afraid of dropping.
&gt;
&gt; Just a thought,

&gt; I would like to speak about the possibility that a competitor 
&gt; might "cheat" by making a "U" move before lifting the cube, or after 
&gt; stopping the timer.

General question: Is this timer intended for cubes only? There's some 
reason to make moves with the puzzle on the surface for example with 
Magic, Megaminx, Rainbow Cube.

&gt; That is, after pre-inspection, 
&gt; it is up to the competitor to place the cube on the puzzle-pad in 
&gt; such an orientation that his first move is not horizontal.

I'd prefer more freedom...

&gt; As you attempt this at top 
&gt; speed, it becomes nearly impossible to make the entire "D" face rest 
&gt; on the table before performing the U move.

Depends a little on the size of your hands. Damn, another advantage of 
young cubers! ;-)

&gt; The 
&gt; SpeedStacks timer itself is flawed, and its flaws are currently 
&gt; accepted as a part of speed-cubing.

I guess I belong to those who'd say that's a bit exaggerated...

I think the only way to perfectly measure the time is video analysis 
or puzzles that measure the time themselves, but both ways must be 
combined with the solver somehow clearly stating that he/she thinks 
the cube is solved. Hmm, actually even that is still a little 
problematic. Not to mention it probably won't be very practical in the 
near future.

Hey btw, I'm among those who should complain loudest about stackmats, 
since I'm among the serious Rubik's magic solvers. My stackmat record 
is an awful 38% slower than my video analysis record ;-) But for 
competition it still gives a good comparison which is why I like it 
nevertheless. Well, the main problem is picking up the magic which 
would still be a problem with the new timer (which has the end-problem 
with it, too). On stackmat it could be improved by putting the magic 
on a CD case, on the new timer maybe by cutting the sides off so that 
the actual surface area is even smaller ;-)

    The amount of time it takes to pick up a cube and begin is 
miniscule, and the same goes for placing it back on the mat.  It 
almost takes no time at all, and the difference in times between 
different competitors for these things is even much smaller.  I 
would imagine it makes a difference of less than .1 second in most 
cases (or even smaller).  I think the Stackmat is an excellent 
timing device, though a bit expensive.  I see no reason to replace 
it (other than its high price).

&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; We've been using this 100 meter dash example forever by now.  I do 
not 
&gt; believe that the time it takes you to solve a cube is from when 
you 
&gt; first move the cube to when you stop moving the cube.  It's just 
too 
&gt; hard to measure something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; I also do not have any shares in StackMat either.  I don't have 
any 
&gt; shares in anything at all.

&gt; &gt; Hi Ryan,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I do not agree with you on this one. There has never been a 
consensus 
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; StackMats were unnatural for speedcubing. At least I wasn't part 
of 
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; consensus. :-)
&gt; &gt; In fact I would dare to claim that without StackMat there 
wouldn't 
&gt; &gt; have been
&gt; &gt; as many tourmanents as there have been recently.
&gt; &gt; I also dare to claim that more than half of the competitors 
don't 
&gt; &gt; bother
&gt; &gt; much about the timers, as long as the competition is fair. It is 
only 
&gt; &gt; a few
&gt; &gt; people (some of them have never been to a tournament, some have 
never
&gt; &gt; touched a StackMat!) who are discussing this subject. During 
Euro2004 
&gt; &gt; we did
&gt; &gt; not have a single complaint about the timers. There was one case 
where 
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; timer didn't stop because the competitor didn't touch both pads 
at the 
&gt; &gt; same
&gt; &gt; time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would like to compare this discussion to the 100 meter dash. 
We all 
&gt; &gt; start
&gt; &gt; after the gun shot. But reaction time is included and also the 
&gt; &gt; acceleration
&gt; &gt; time. There are much better ways to measure the true 100 meter 
dash 
&gt; &gt; running
&gt; &gt; time. I think StackMat gives us better time measurement than 
athletics
&gt; &gt; timers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My main problems with StackMat are the price and the ugly mat. 
The old
&gt; &gt; version also has problems with durability (dropping gives pits).
&gt; &gt; The new version can have a separate mat, so that we can also 
make a mat
&gt; &gt; specifically for speedcubing (nice WCA logo maybe?).
&gt; &gt; The price of StackMat will drop once speedstacks.com doesn't 
have a 
&gt; &gt; monopoly
&gt; &gt; anymore.
&gt; &gt; Although StackMat also lacks functionality (like generating 
scrambles 
&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; taking averages), I do not think this is an issue for 
competitions 
&gt; &gt; until all
&gt; &gt; timing devices are connected to a central computer. In which 
case the
&gt; &gt; central computer could also provide that functionality.
&gt; &gt; For home use StackMat indeed lacks that functionality. But at 
home 
&gt; &gt; anyone
&gt; &gt; can decide what timer he/she uses. (Who has an official 
athletics 
&gt; &gt; timer at
&gt; &gt; home?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The device you propose is an interesting one, but even such a 
device 
&gt; &gt; has
&gt; &gt; some awkward issues.
&gt; &gt; If picking up the cube is a problem for StackMat, then picking 
will 
&gt; &gt; also be
&gt; &gt; a problem for the new timer. Same goes for stopping it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No, I do not have Speedstacks.com shares. I am just conservative 
and 
&gt; &gt; proud
&gt; &gt; of it. :-)
&gt; &gt; StackMat has been the recent standard for competitions. It works 
great!
&gt; &gt; We have a great timer to compare competitors. The extra time for 
&gt; &gt; picking up
&gt; &gt; and putting down the cube is very low.
&gt; &gt; People are enjoying speedcubing. Speedcubing meetings have been 
full of
&gt; &gt; friendship and fun. And a great timer for the official stuff.
&gt; &gt; Even though there may be better ways to measure the times, I 
think 
&gt; &gt; there are
&gt; &gt; hardly better ways to minimize cheating or at least avoid 
discussions
&gt; &gt; afterwards.

Protocol
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; There was a consensus in 2003 that StackMats were unnatural for
&gt; &gt;&gt; speedcubing. In particular, it is unnatural for a cubist to not 
be
&gt; &gt;&gt; holding onto the cube at the beginning of the solve, and it is 
&gt; &gt;&gt; unnatural
&gt; &gt;&gt; to have to drop the cube at the end of the solve to get the 
fastest
&gt; &gt;&gt; time. Not to mention that the StackMat measures the time it 
takes to
&gt; &gt;&gt; move your hands to and from the cube, which is not really a 
part of 
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; activity of speedcubing.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; The fact that you can get used to using a StackMat still does 
not make
&gt; &gt;&gt; the StackMat natural for speedcubing. I would like something 
that
&gt; &gt;&gt; allowed me to hold onto the cube at the beginning and not drop 
it at 
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; end.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Eric, I like the timing device you have designed. It is more 
natural 
&gt; &gt;&gt; for
&gt; &gt;&gt; speedcubing than the StackMat is, and will also measure faster 
and 
&gt; &gt;&gt; more
&gt; &gt;&gt; accurate times. However, as others have pointed out, it is 
possible to
&gt; &gt;&gt; cheat with your device, by performing untimed U-turns and D-
turns for
&gt; &gt;&gt; free at the end. When you place your cube against one flat 
surface at
&gt; &gt;&gt; the end of the solve, this prevents you from turning only 4 of 
the 6
&gt; &gt;&gt; sides of the cube. However, if you place your cube against two
&gt; &gt;&gt; perpendicular flat surfaces at the end of the solve, this 
prevents you
&gt; &gt;&gt; from turning all 6 sides of the cube.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Is it possible to incorporate a second perpendicular surface 
into your
&gt; &gt;&gt; design? This surface could stand behind the cube should be less 
than 
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; width of the cube so that your fingers can grip the rear side 
of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; cube when picking it up and placing it down. The sensor can be 
placed 
&gt; &gt;&gt; at
&gt; &gt;&gt; the edge between the two surfaces.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; On second thought, this standing surface need not be flat. It 
can 
&gt; &gt;&gt; curve
&gt; &gt;&gt; away from the cube on the left and right sides, leaving room 
for the
&gt; &gt;&gt; fingers. For example, it could be a standing cylinder. This has 
the
&gt; &gt;&gt; additional benefit of providing no sharp edges to hurt your 
fingers 
&gt; &gt;&gt; on.

&gt; Hi Ryan,

Hi Ron. Before I begin to respond, I will make some claims:

- StackMats are unnatural for speedcubing
- The fact that you can get used to using a StackMat still does not make
  the StackMat natural for speedcubing.
- Eric's timing device is more natural for speedcubing than the StackMat
  is, and will also measure faster and more accurate times.

Since you disagree with me, I will now gather your claims:

&gt; In fact I would dare to claim that without StackMat there wouldn't have been 
&gt; as many tourmanents as there have been recently.

I cannot conclude from this that StackMats are natural for speedcubing.

&gt; I also dare to claim that more than half of the competitors don't bother 
&gt; much about the timers, as long as the competition is fair.

I cannot conclude from this that StackMats are natural for speedcubing.

&gt; It is only a few people (some of them have never been to a tournament,
&gt; some have never touched a StackMat!) who are discussing this subject.

Again, I cannot reach any conclusion. Most people have not touched
Eric's timer device either.

&gt; During Euro2004 we did not have a single complaint about the timers.
&gt; There was one case where the timer didn't stop because the competitor
&gt; didn't touch both pads at the same time.

&gt;From this, I can conclude that people can get used to StackMats, but not
that StackMats are natural for speedcubing.



Now for the arguments:

&gt; I would like to compare this discussion to the 100 meter dash. We all start 
&gt; after the gun shot. But reaction time is included and also the acceleration 
&gt; time. There are much better ways to measure the true 100 meter dash running 
&gt; time. I think StackMat gives us better time measurement than athletics 
&gt; timers.

I put it to you that the 100 metre dash is not a mere "measurement of
speed", but a specific activity that starts from "GO" and ends at the
finish line. Naturally it includes acceleration. The "GO" part has been
implemented in different ways, of course.

What is important is that their feet are on the ground when they start
the race, right?




&gt; My main problems with StackMat are the price and the ugly mat. The old 
&gt; version also has problems with durability (dropping gives pits).
&gt; The new version can have a separate mat, so that we can also make a mat 
&gt; specifically for speedcubing (nice WCA logo maybe?).
&gt; The price of StackMat will drop once speedstacks.com doesn't have a monopoly

&gt; Although StackMat also lacks functionality (like generating scrambles or

&gt; For home use StackMat indeed lacks that functionality. But at home anyone 
&gt; can decide what timer he/she uses. (Who has an official athletics timer at 
&gt; home?)

No comment...

&gt; The device you propose is an interesting one, but even such a device has 
&gt; some awkward issues.
&gt; If picking up the cube is a problem for StackMat, then picking will also be 
&gt; a problem for the new timer. Same goes for stopping it.

I would like to make a distinction: picking up the cube is less of a
problem for the new timer timer. Same goes for stopping it.

My claim is that Eric's timing device (with or without my extension) is
"more natural" for speedcubing than the StackMat is.


To summarise, you claim:

- people can get used to StackMats (I agree)
- the availability of StackMats has allowed for tournaments (I agree)
- people enjoy tournaments with StackMats (I agree)

I'm making a different, but very narrow claim:

- StackMats are unnatural for speedcubing.

Or to put it in another way:

- StackMats are unnatural for speedcubing, but they work well enough
  that many people don't mind.

I prefer the original, and more direct, claim.



Just one more small comment:

(Hi Chris)

This is an example of what I consider unnatural. Sure, people can learn
this technique, and eventually be happy doing it. But my point is only
to say that it is unnatural. Furthermore, starting and stopping with
Eric's timer is more natural than this.

    Hi Ryan,

You keep saying the word "unnatural for cubing" but you really don't 
say anything about what unnatural and natural are.  Without putting in 
any arguments, I do not believe you can claim that one is more 
"natural" than the other.  It is of my understanding that you have not 
tried Eric's timer.

Furthermore, I could take every single claim you have here, and reverse 
it in favor of the StackMat saying that it does not conclude that the 
StackMat is unnatural for speedcubing.

You attempt to define natural and unnatural only for yourself.  In 
order to actually claim that the StackMat is unnatural for cubing, 
you're going to have to give arguments and not just state the fact that 
it is unnatural for cubing.  I for one feel that the StackMat is very 
natural for cubing.

The StackMat is natural for cubing.

The StackMat is natural for cubing.

The StackMat is natural for cubing.

Oh, and by the way:

The StackMat is natural for cubing.

&gt;&gt; Hi Ryan,
&gt;
&gt; Hi Ron. Before I begin to respond, I will make some claims:
&gt;
&gt; - StackMats are unnatural for speedcubing
&gt; - The fact that you can get used to using a StackMat still does not 
&gt; make
&gt;   the StackMat natural for speedcubing.
&gt; - Eric's timing device is more natural for speedcubing than the 
&gt; StackMat
&gt;   is, and will also measure faster and more accurate times.
&gt;
&gt; Since you disagree with me, I will now gather your claims:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; In fact I would dare to claim that without StackMat there wouldn't 
&gt;&gt; have been
&gt;&gt; as many tourmanents as there have been recently.
&gt;
&gt; I cannot conclude from this that StackMats are natural for speedcubing.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I also dare to claim that more than half of the competitors don't 
&gt;&gt; bother
&gt;&gt; much about the timers, as long as the competition is fair.
&gt;
&gt; I cannot conclude from this that StackMats are natural for speedcubing.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is only a few people (some of them have never been to a tournament,
&gt;&gt; some have never touched a StackMat!) who are discussing this subject.
&gt;
&gt; Again, I cannot reach any conclusion. Most people have not touched
&gt; Eric's timer device either.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; During Euro2004 we did not have a single complaint about the timers.
&gt;&gt; There was one case where the timer didn't stop because the competitor
&gt;&gt; didn't touch both pads at the same time.
&gt;
&gt; From this, I can conclude that people can get used to StackMats, but 
&gt; not
&gt; that StackMats are natural for speedcubing.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Now for the arguments:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would like to compare this discussion to the 100 meter dash. We all 
&gt;&gt; start
&gt;&gt; after the gun shot. But reaction time is included and also the 
&gt;&gt; acceleration
&gt;&gt; time. There are much better ways to measure the true 100 meter dash 
&gt;&gt; running
&gt;&gt; time. I think StackMat gives us better time measurement than athletics
&gt;&gt; timers.
&gt;
&gt; I put it to you that the 100 metre dash is not a mere "measurement of
&gt; speed", but a specific activity that starts from "GO" and ends at the
&gt; finish line. Naturally it includes acceleration. The "GO" part has been
&gt; implemented in different ways, of course.
&gt;
&gt; What is important is that their feet are on the ground when they start
&gt; the race, right?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; My main problems with StackMat are the price and the ugly mat. The old
&gt;&gt; version also has problems with durability (dropping gives pits).
&gt;&gt; The new version can have a separate mat, so that we can also make a 
&gt;&gt; mat
&gt;&gt; specifically for speedcubing (nice WCA logo maybe?).
&gt;&gt; The price of StackMat will drop once speedstacks.com doesn't have a 
&gt;&gt; monopoly
&gt;&gt; anymore.
&gt;&gt; Although StackMat also lacks functionality (like generating scrambles 
&gt;&gt; or
&gt;&gt; taking averages), I do not think this is an issue for competitions 
&gt;&gt; until all
&gt;&gt; timing devices are connected to a central computer. In which case the
&gt;&gt; central computer could also provide that functionality.
&gt;&gt; For home use StackMat indeed lacks that functionality. But at home

    There was a brief exchange between Dror and me about this at WC2003. 
Because we always memorize and solve with a fixed orientation of the 
centers (so that permutation is easy to memorize), while the 
permutation is virtually not affected, orientation can be very 
different when scrambled from a different direction.

Take this scramble: R2

I always memorize my cubes with blue on top and green in front 
(Japanese color scheme...haha). If the cube is scramble with blue on 
top and green in front, corner orientation is already done (from my 
perspective). Meanwhile, if it is scrambled after doing x, I am left 
with 8 incorrectly oriented corners. Of course, I could turn the cube 
so that all corners are correctly oriented, but this would make 
memorization of permutation very hard since I wouldn't be used to 
this new ordering of the centers.

p.s. I could even use the identity scramble for an example, but just 
to make a point, R2 was easier =)

    Sorry, I was being dumb. That's a very bad scramble for this example,

Better scramble: U' R' F2 L D F L2 U L' U2 R2 L' F2 R' L2 B U2 B
Holding your cube the way you do to memorize it and scramble. 
Orientation is done. Now, holding your cube the way you do to 
memorize, do x and then scramble. Now do x', and you see that now you 
have four corners to orient. You _could_ start with all corners 
oriented correctly by not doing that x', but it would be very hard to 
memorize the permutation this way.

The arguments have already been put forward. Please refer to 2003/2004.

I do not recall any arguments to support the claim that StackMats are
natural for speedcubing. There are comments along the lines of
"StackMats are not perfect for speedcubing, but the problems are
relatively small. You can get used to using them, and after you do, they
work quite well. We also need a standard timer for tournaments and
StackMats have filled that role quite well. Maybe there exist better
speedcubing timers than the StackMat, but it is unclear whether they
increase the risk of cheating. We already know the StackMats work quite
well so there's no reason to change."

If you have found something about StackMats that are more natural for
speedcubing than Eric's timer, please tell me.

- They prevent cheating better (including unintentional).

I won't say they're "natural" (because I don't know what that is) but

    I think you really really ought to mention the context. If someone 
defines orientation different from you (e.g. rotated by x) then for 
him that very same scramble is awful, while the one that's awful for 
you is perfect for him.

I'd say it doesn't matter at all if you look at one solve unless the 
scrambler knows you and intentionally wants to give you a hard 
scramble. But with random scrambles it is no issue.

It doesn't even matter to compare different people solving the same 
scramble. The only context I agree it does matter is when you want to 
solve the same scramble twice, like Tyson mentioned, since then you'd 
want to use the *same* cube orientation, but only the same, and it 
doesn't matter which one.

But I'd like to add I think it's important that the scrambles are 
executed correctly, especially in blindsolving. That will at least 
guarantee that the same number of pieces are already solved, or at the 
right position but badly oriented, and that the "parities" are the 
same for everyone. Though I know different people have different 
amount of trouble with these things, too (e.g. I hate 
goodPerm+badOrient but parity is nothing).

    Hey guys,

Here's the clip from MSNBC (I'm national!!).  You can briefly see 
two of my students (Kamran Jehle and Krishanu Sankar) and myself.

1.  Click on the link below to go to the "Countdown with Keith 
Olbermann" show page. 

2.  Scroll down about 1/4 of the page to the section 
called "ODDBALL" 

3.  Click on "Feb. 22: Elks on the run"  This should automatically 
launch the MSN video player (RealPlayer or Windows Media Player) 
(speed depends on your connection). 

4.  You'll have to sit through a commercial.  Once the Countdown 
section begins, you can scroll to about 1:04 to see my segment.

Correction: Those are reasons why I think they're "better".

    It's nice that all of you are posting your scores. A few things:

(1) Per: how can you know 1/3 of Erno?

(2) Why are people taking the effort to know how to solve it
blindfolded but not to be able to solve it over their head?

(3) There isn't a standardized ruler stick, just compare against each
other.

(4) Add more things, if you think of them! Don't just take it as a
final version! If there's something cool you can do with the Cube
(like solve it looking in a mirror, or do it in a really hard/obscure
way like top and bottom first then middle, or have actually finished a
cube of size &gt; 9x9x9, or do it without using your thumbs) then just
make a suggestion to add it!

(5) Just for curiosity's sake, I'm posting a revised version with the
proper indentation (apparently Yahoo doesn't take kindly to multiple
spaces) and also the scores I'd get:

    The 4D cube deserves a place. Also, mirror solving is extremely fun
and challenging. I also tried solving without the thumbs (without
fingers at all actually), so ... yeah.

    I assure you, in the blindfold rounds, we (usually I) check the 
scramble state of the cubes quite carefully.  I mean, for me, it could 
be kind of bad if someone set a world record (which is always a 
possibility with Macky) and then went back and wanted to recreate the 
solve and then realized I had scrambled the cube wrong.

http://cubing.blogspot.com

i put two algs up there on how to make an oll cross.

from that, then you can do OLL with edges already
flipped forming a cross, like the sune. double sune
,bruno and the others.

that is how i got started, and i learnt the rest of
the OLL on how often they occur.

good luck

    Start with all the algs with the cross in place, and then all the ones
with no edges oriented because those are a pain.  Fill in the rest as
you go.  Learn the algorithm's inverse at the same time so you can
practice.  Solved cube -&gt; apply inverse alg -&gt; OLL state -&gt; apply alg

down four algorithms at the same time this way, by learning the
inverse, mirror, and mirror inverse.  this is not always the case, as
there are some algorithms that are symmetric and have no mirrors, and
some that are their own inverses.

    Until we all have timers directly built into our Rubik's cubes...and 
until those timers can wirelessly transmit the solving times, and 
scramble themselves...perhaps we will have to use the stackmats...  
They prevent unintentional forms of cheating, and have worked for a 
while already.  That having been said, I still plan on purchasing a 
rubik's timer...I think that would be a great travel/college dorm

&gt; I think you really really ought to mention the context. If someone 
&gt; defines orientation different from you (e.g. rotated by x) then for 
&gt; him that very same scramble is awful, while the one that's awful 
for 
&gt; you is perfect for him.

Right. And to avoid this difference, each competitor picks in advance 
his top color and front color (or at least this was what I thought to 
be the reason).

&gt; I'd say it doesn't matter at all if you look at one solve unless 
the 
&gt; scrambler knows you and intentionally wants to give you a hard 
&gt; scramble. But with random scrambles it is no issue.

It matters because you only get a few attempts, and so having an 
easier orientation on one of the solves can dramatically change the 
outcome of the competition?

&gt; It doesn't even matter to compare different people solving the same 
&gt; scramble. The only context I agree it does matter is when you want 
to 
&gt; solve the same scramble twice, like Tyson mentioned, since then 
you'd 
&gt; want to use the *same* cube orientation, but only the same, and it 
&gt; doesn't matter which one.
&gt; 
&gt; But I'd like to add I think it's important that the scrambles are 
&gt; executed correctly, especially in blindsolving. That will at least 
&gt; guarantee that the same number of pieces are already solved, or at 
the 
&gt; right position but badly oriented, and that the "parities" are the

I am asking for positional arguments. Not arguments that everyone agrees
with. You're right, not everyone will agree with what is natural or well
suited for speedcubing. Please add your own position to the list (if you
have any).

The list will be useful because such a list doesn't already exist.

&gt; &gt; I'd say it doesn't matter at all if you look at one solve unless 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; scrambler knows you and intentionally wants to give you a hard 
&gt; &gt; scramble. But with random scrambles it is no issue.
&gt; 
&gt; It matters because you only get a few attempts, and so having an 
&gt; easier orientation on one of the solves can dramatically change the 
&gt; outcome of the competition?

Think of it this way: Let there be a "standard orientation" for 
everyone, let's say "brightest" color on top and brightest adjacent to 
it at front. The cube orientation you choose is nothing else than a 
cube rotation, let's say (x z'). Then the random scramble RS is 
applied. But the whole thing together is nothing but the algorithm (x 
z' RS), which is also a random scramble.

By choosing an orientation you don't win anything. You seem to say 
it's good to choose because it can give you an easy scramble. But it 
can just as well give you a hard scramble and then you'll wish you 
hadn't made your choice.

If it's random, it's random. Whether you rotate the cube before the 
scramble (e.g. x z' RS) or after it (e.g. RS x z') doesn't matter. 
Yes, it will give different results, but you can't say the first way 
is generally better for you.

Cheers!
Stefan

    Hi Everyone,

I'm writing this e-mail just to invite you all to this weekends 
concerts performed by the Caltech/Occidental Symphony orchestra.  The 
performances will be on Saturday March 5 at Thorne Hall at Occidental 
College and on Sunday March 6 at Ramo Audiotirum at Caltech.  Both 
performances will begin at 7:30 PM.

The concert will actually be pretty special for me as I will be the 
soloist with the orchestra performing Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante 
with Colette Salyk, a 2nd year grad student in GPS on viola.  Anyway, I 
hope some of you can make it and I hope to see you guys there!

True. But I think if you can learn to speedsolve a cube, you can also 
learn to use a stackmat ;-)

Cheers!

P.S. My opinion has changed, now I think the worst thing about the 
stackmat is not the price but its name. I wish they had called it 
timermat... I truly believe we'd have less discussion about its 
"unnaturalness" then.

    I must agree with both of those statements.  Certainly using the 
Stackmat is easier than speedsolving.  :)  I have a question:  has 
there been any problem with using the Stackmats that we need to 
change our timer?  It seems to me that they are (almost) optimal for 
ensuring fair competitions, preventing cheating, and recording 
accurate times.

&gt; there, I'd definitely be there too. :)  Good luck Tyson.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm writing this e-mail just to invite you all to this weekends 
&gt; &gt; concerts performed by the Caltech/Occidental Symphony 
orchestra.  
&gt; The 
&gt; &gt; performances will be on Saturday March 5 at Thorne Hall at 
&gt; Occidental 
&gt; &gt; College and on Sunday March 6 at Ramo Audiotirum at Caltech.  
Both 
&gt; &gt; performances will begin at 7:30 PM.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The concert will actually be pretty special for me as I will be 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; soloist with the orchestra performing Mozart's Sinfonia 
&gt; Concertante 
&gt; &gt; with Colette Salyk, a 2nd year grad student in GPS on viola.  
&gt; Anyway, I 
&gt; &gt; hope some of you can make it and I hope to see you guys there!

    (See comments below, these are from two different previous posts).  
This message is long, but I don't feel that there has been any 
objective debate about this issue yet.  Everyone is either for or 
against the timer(s) of their choice right from the start of their 
messages and, frankly, it is getting annoying and I find the 
arguments childish.

Here is my attempt at the first objective argument.

--------------------

&gt; I think in favor of the Rubikstimer that it is more intuitive to
&gt; use for someone who has never used a stackmat or a the new 
&gt; timer. Just pick it up and put it down.

-----------------

&gt; ... has there been any problem with using the Stackmats that we 
&gt; need to change our timer?  It seems to me that they are (almost) 
&gt; optimal for ensuring fair competitions, preventing cheating, and 
&gt; recording accurate times.

-----------------

(end replies from other messages)

It seems that everyone has already made their decision as to which 
timer they like, and no one seems willing to compromise.  Well here 
is my attempt to try to list pros and cons and lets decide this.  
Obviously a lot of money and time is being spent in developing this 
new Rubik's timer, so let's not bash it down before even trying it 
just because the stackmat has worked so far.

----

Stackmat pros:
1) Timer cannot start before hands touch the cube.  Simply specify a 
rough distance that is further than fingers can reach for the intial 
start position of the cube and all these problems about manipulating 
before starting the timer dissapear.

2) It is *very* difficult to simultaneously stop the timer and 
continue doing a move.  The cube has to end up on the table, and 
bringing it down to the mat and trying to do a move all very quickly 
and all at the same time is very hard.  This is not a likely option 
for a common "cheat"

Stackmat cons:
1) If you are not used to the distance between the hand pads, you 
can think you've stopped the timer, but not applied enough pressure 
to the pads correctly and it won't stop.

2) If you haven't practiced bringing your cube to the timer along 
with your hands, it seems the only reasonable way to stop it quickly 
is to drop your cube.  This leads to misaligned faces and damage to 
larger/more fragile cubes/puzzles.

3) The final time is how long it takes to pick up the cube from 
hands flat on the table, solve it, bring the cube back down to the 
table and place your hands in their original start positions.

4) High cost makes it difficult for most to buy one to practice and 
get used to it before competitions.

---------

Rubik's Timer pros:
1) Assuming someone doesn't cheat, you could lift the cube from the 
optical sensor and start solving more fluidly and quickly than from 
the start pads of a stackmat.

2) Nearing the end of the solve you could "hover" over the timer, 
close to the table, for the last few moves and lightly set down your 
cube to stop it rather than practicing the "bring your cube to the 
table" stackmat manuever.

3) The final time is how long it takes to pick up the cube (not from 
hands flat on the table, regardless of whether this is required as 
procedure or not for the start); plus solve the cube, plus set the 
cube back down.

Rubik's Timer cons:
1) It is possible to misalign the U layer from the scramble before 
even starting the timer.

2) It is possible to set the cube down, thus stopping the timer, and 
finishing the final portion of a U turn (even if this is 
unintentional).

3) If trying to go quickly, you may slam your cube down too hard, 
causing damage (this can easily be fixed with padding).

------------------

I don't know how much the Rubik's timer will cost, but that is 
obviously going to be either a pro or con.  Notice I haven't 
included anything about the Rubik's timer's ability to provide 
scrambles, do averages etc..  I think this is totally and wholly 
irrelevant to the issue of which timer to use in competitions, 
though I think it is an interesting and useful addition to the timer 
itself.

My objective consensus on this issue is that the cons of the Rubik's 
timer will likely lead to video analysis for potential new records 
to see if any sort of U turn was down before or after the timer was 
started/stopped.  The pros of the Rubik timer are nice, in that it 
times a closer margin around just the solve than the stackmat does.  
Also the fact that it is easy to learn how to efficiently use a 
Rubik's timer is a big pro in my opinion.

Subjectively, the cons for the Rubik timer, to me, heavily outweigh 
the pros in that I don't want to lose a fast solve becuase, on 
watching the video analysis of a fast solve, I hit the U layer as my 
hands grabbed the cube and before I picked it up.  I would be very 
frustrated by the potential time disqualifications this timer would 
bring to competitions.

Objectively looking at the stackmat it has about as many cons as the 
rubik timer, but it doesn't include the likelihood of a bad turn 
before starting the solve, as the rubik timer does.

Disturbing for me about the stackmat is that it times a larger 
margin around the solve than the Rubik's timer, and that it takes 
lots of practice and familiarity with a Stackmat to use it 
efficiently in a competition.

Personally I think both timers are bad, but both are also good.  
Subjectively now, I think the cons of the rubik's timer are pretty 
large.  I wouldn't want to use one in a competition as the timer is 
designed right now, with the likelihood of disqualified records and 
fast solves because of this "U-face problem".

I also don't like the stackmat because it times a larger margin of 
the solve that we are interested in.  However this may be necessary 
to ensure good flow and ease of timing in a competition.

Personally I think both timers suck and we should all go to video 
analysis for it's purity sake.  However this too has huge problems 
with money and supplies.

I say that last unreasonable option (and it is most unreasonable, I 
would never campaing in favor of completely video analysis 
tournaments) only to say that I think both timers suck, I am not in 
either camp.  However, based on the qualifications  of the Rubik's 
timer and my opinions as a competitor, I right now prefer the 
stackmat simply as a lesser of two evils.

If the "U-face problem" could be fixed with the start and stop of 
the solve on the Rubik's timer, I would greatly prefer the Rubik's 
timer over the stackmat as it has better pros and (with the absence 
of those two huge cons on my list), not so many cons left.

Come one guys, stop being so subjective and partial and not even 
giving valid arguments.  We're all smarter and better than that.  
Just because the Stackmat has worked before doesn't mean it's a 
great timer and we need to accept everything status quo.  Also, just 
because the Rubik's timer has so many great pros doesn't make it a 
great timer either, as a competitor I am VERY nervous about this 
problem with U face turns on the start and stop.

**Both timer have big downfalls**  So don't get all high and mighty 
in supporting your favorite.

Both timer suck, but in my opinion with all the information on both 
timers, I would prefer to have a stackmat in front of me in a 
competition over a Rubik's timer until this "U-face problem" is 
fixed on the Rubik's timer.

If and when the U-face problem is fixed, I would much rather have a 
Rubik's timer in front of me during a competition.

My two (and hopefully sufficiently objective) cents,
Chris

P.S.  Please let's continue this discussion with arguments about the 
pros and cons of these timers, and not advertisements about how your 
favorite time is the √ºbertimer and all other ones are crap.

    In the interest of being objective I just realized one more con I
forgot to include about the Stackmat2 that I think is definitely worth
mentioning.

The reset button is very close the base next to the right hand pad. 
If you bring your right hand down too close to the upraised middle
portion, the fleshy part of your thumb will hit the reset button and
you will lose the time before even seeing what it was.

I discovered this when practicing some blindfolded solves, and I think
it could also happen to those who are unfamiliar and/or using the
stackmat for the first time.

Simply that the possibility is there is a con, and worth considering.
 Though I said in my last message that I prefer the stackmat given all
the current information, this con make me even more willing to go over
to the rubik timer if that U-face problem can be fixed.

    Lots of good points Chris.  Since I havent used either I won't comment.
Although I've ordered a stackmat for my birthday!
When I broke the world record for one hand it was timed by a guy holding a
stop watch - is that so terrible!  It also has pros and cons of course but
possibly no more than the two options already under discussion.  Higher
technology isn't always better (although may well be in this case).

&gt; This message is long, but I don't feel that there has been any
&gt; objective debate about this issue yet.  Everyone is either for or
&gt; against the timer(s) of their choice right from the start of their
&gt; messages and, frankly, it is getting annoying and I find the
&gt; arguments childish.
&gt;
&gt; Here is my attempt at the first objective argument.
&gt;
&gt; --------------------
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I think in favor of the Rubikstimer that it is more intuitive to
&gt; &gt; use for someone who has never used a stackmat or a the new
&gt; &gt; timer. Just pick it up and put it down.
&gt;
&gt; -----------------
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ... has there been any problem with using the Stackmats that we
&gt; &gt; need to change our timer?  It seems to me that they are (almost)
&gt; &gt; optimal for ensuring fair competitions, preventing cheating, and
&gt; &gt; recording accurate times.
&gt;
&gt; -----------------
&gt;
&gt; (end replies from other messages)
&gt;
&gt; It seems that everyone has already made their decision as to which
&gt; timer they like, and no one seems willing to compromise.  Well here
&gt; is my attempt to try to list pros and cons and lets decide this.
&gt; Obviously a lot of money and time is being spent in developing this
&gt; new Rubik's timer, so let's not bash it down before even trying it
&gt; just because the stackmat has worked so far.
&gt;
&gt; ----
&gt;
&gt; Stackmat pros:
&gt; 1) Timer cannot start before hands touch the cube.  Simply specify a
&gt; rough distance that is further than fingers can reach for the intial
&gt; start position of the cube and all these problems about manipulating
&gt; before starting the timer dissapear.
&gt;
&gt; 2) It is *very* difficult to simultaneously stop the timer and
&gt; continue doing a move.  The cube has to end up on the table, and
&gt; bringing it down to the mat and trying to do a move all very quickly
&gt; and all at the same time is very hard.  This is not a likely option
&gt; for a common "cheat"
&gt;
&gt; Stackmat cons:
&gt; 1) If you are not used to the distance between the hand pads, you
&gt; can think you've stopped the timer, but not applied enough pressure
&gt; to the pads correctly and it won't stop.
&gt;
&gt; 2) If you haven't practiced bringing your cube to the timer along
&gt; with your hands, it seems the only reasonable way to stop it quickly
&gt; is to drop your cube.  This leads to misaligned faces and damage to
&gt; larger/more fragile cubes/puzzles.
&gt;
&gt; 3) The final time is how long it takes to pick up the cube from
&gt; hands flat on the table, solve it, bring the cube back down to the
&gt; table and place your hands in their original start positions.
&gt;
&gt; 4) High cost makes it difficult for most to buy one to practice and
&gt; get used to it before competitions.
&gt;
&gt; ---------
&gt;
&gt; Rubik's Timer pros:
&gt; 1) Assuming someone doesn't cheat, you could lift the cube from the
&gt; optical sensor and start solving more fluidly and quickly than from
&gt; the start pads of a stackmat.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Nearing the end of the solve you could "hover" over the timer,
&gt; close to the table, for the last few moves and lightly set down your
&gt; cube to stop it rather than practicing the "bring your cube to the
&gt; table" stackmat manuever.
&gt;
&gt; 3) The final time is how long it takes to pick up the cube (not from
&gt; hands flat on the table, regardless of whether this is required as
&gt; procedure or not for the start); plus solve the cube, plus set the
&gt; cube back down.
&gt;
&gt; Rubik's Timer cons:
&gt; 1) It is possible to misalign the U layer from the scramble before
&gt; even starting the timer.
&gt;
&gt; 2) It is possible to set the cube down, thus stopping the timer, and
&gt; finishing the final portion of a U turn (even if this is
&gt; unintentional).
&gt;
&gt; 3) If trying to go quickly, you may slam your cube down too hard,
&gt; causing damage (this can easily be fixed with padding).
&gt;
&gt; ------------------
&gt;
&gt; I don't know how much the Rubik's timer will cost, but that is
&gt; obviously going to be either a pro or con.  Notice I haven't
&gt; included anything about the Rubik's timer's ability to provide
&gt; scrambles, do averages etc..  I think this is totally and wholly
&gt; irrelevant to the issue of which timer to use in competitions,
&gt; though I think it is an interesting and useful addition to the timer
&gt; itself.
&gt;
&gt; My objective consensus on this issue is that the cons of the Rubik's
&gt; timer will likely lead to video analysis for potential new records
&gt; to see if any sort of U turn was down before or after the timer was
&gt; started/stopped.  The pros of the Rubik timer are nice, in that it
&gt; times a closer margin around just the solve than the stackmat does.
&gt; Also the fact that it is easy to learn how to efficiently use a
&gt; Rubik's timer is a big pro in my opinion.
&gt;
&gt; Subjectively, the cons for the Rubik timer, to me, heavily outweigh
&gt; the pros in that I don't want to lose a fast solve becuase, on
&gt; watching the video analysis of a fast solve, I hit the U layer as my
&gt; hands grabbed the cube and before I picked it up.  I would be very
&gt; frustrated by the potential time disqualifications this timer would
&gt; bring to competitions.
&gt;
&gt; Objectively looking at the stackmat it has about as many cons as the
&gt; rubik timer, but it doesn't include the likelihood of a bad turn
&gt; before starting the solve, as the rubik timer does.
&gt;
&gt; Disturbing for me about the stackmat is that it times a larger
&gt; margin around the solve than the Rubik's timer, and that it takes
&gt; lots of practice and familiarity with a Stackmat to use it
&gt; efficiently in a competition.
&gt;
&gt; Personally I think both timers are bad, but both are also good.
&gt; Subjectively now, I think the cons of the rubik's timer are pretty
&gt; large.  I wouldn't want to use one in a competition as the timer is
&gt; designed right now, with the likelihood of disqualified records and
&gt; fast solves because of this "U-face problem".
&gt;
&gt; I also don't like the stackmat because it times a larger margin of
&gt; the solve that we are interested in.  However this may be necessary
&gt; to ensure good flow and ease of timing in a competition.
&gt;
&gt; Personally I think both timers suck and we should all go to video
&gt; analysis for it's purity sake.  However this too has huge problems
&gt; with money and supplies.
&gt;
&gt; I say that last unreasonable option (and it is most unreasonable, I
&gt; would never campaing in favor of completely video analysis
&gt; tournaments) only to say that I think both timers suck, I am not in
&gt; either camp.  However, based on the qualifications  of the Rubik's
&gt; timer and my opinions as a competitor, I right now prefer the
&gt; stackmat simply as a lesser of two evils.
&gt;
&gt; If the "U-face problem" could be fixed with the start and stop of
&gt; the solve on the Rubik's timer, I would greatly prefer the Rubik's
&gt; timer over the stackmat as it has better pros and (with the absence
&gt; of those two huge cons on my list), not so many cons left.
&gt;
&gt; Come one guys, stop being so subjective and partial and not even
&gt; giving valid arguments.  We're all smarter and better than that.
&gt; Just because the Stackmat has worked before doesn't mean it's a
&gt; great timer and we need to accept everything status quo.  Also, just
&gt; because the Rubik's timer has so many great pros doesn't make it a
&gt; great timer either, as a competitor I am VERY nervous about this
&gt; problem with U face turns on the start and stop.
&gt;
&gt; **Both timer have big downfalls**  So don't get all high and mighty
&gt; in supporting your favorite.
&gt;
&gt; Both timer suck, but in my opinion with all the information on both
&gt; timers, I would prefer to have a stackmat in front of me in a
&gt; competition over a Rubik's timer until this "U-face problem" is
&gt; fixed on the Rubik's timer.
&gt;
&gt; If and when the U-face problem is fixed, I would much rather have a
&gt; Rubik's timer in front of me during a competition.
&gt;
&gt; My two (and hopefully sufficiently objective) cents,
&gt; Chris
&gt;
&gt; P.S.  Please let's continue this discussion with arguments about the
&gt; pros and cons of these timers, and not advertisements about how your
&gt; favorite time is the √Ø¬ø¬Ωbertimer and all other ones are crap.

I was just wondering about this.  I know there has been discussion on 4x4 programs, and how they really can't be valid because of the _needed_ computer power.  Well what exactly would be needed for there to be a "cube explorer" for the 4x4? or the 5x5?

I can solve the cube...

[X] in front of a crowd

Surely, that's what one does with blindfold cubing.
[X] to any possible pattern

the full group - which is in fact a 2-generator group - then I can

(probably, but I haven't thought about it)
[] in the antislice subgroup
(probably, but I haven't thought about it)

I've solved it in a plane - does that count?

I'm claiming 42 but that could be up or down some depending on 
interpretation.

Can I get a point for inventing a method?
Can I get a point for obtaining an optimization result? (Diameter of 
the orientation subgroup.)

I don't know about the programming side of things but I can say that 
one difficulty would be that the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 aren't like the 
3x3x3 in the sense that unless you label the centres they don't have 
a group structure (under the usual generators). (There are moves 
that appear to do nothing in some situations that obviously do do 
things in other situations - e.g. a 3 cycle of centres.) What you 
could do (supposing the goal was the centre) is for each possible 
permutation X of the centres of the solved cube that leaves the cube 
solved (but possibly would change the supercube) obtain one fixed 
solution and then a solution optimal for that fixed solution 
concatenated with X for each X and then minimize over all such X.
But that involves a lot of extra work - plus there are more standard 
generators.

    My question concerns the Fridrich F2L.

I'm in the middle of learning all those algorithms right now and I'm 
trying to implement the ones I know into my current solution, but it 
seems that quite often, I find that the edge piece that goes with the 
corner I'm looking at isn't on the bottom layer (I solve the cross on 
the top).  I spend quite a bit of time looking before I realize that 
I have to move on.

Are there any special tricks for doing the F2L without any of those 
delays?

&gt; for the above 2: I know how to do so but I can't do so (in the sense 
&gt; that I know the sort of thing I would need to learn (algorithms, 
&gt; dexterity, mental speed, recognition etc.) but I that doesn't mean I 
&gt; am able to do all that stuff)

Me too. Tough.

&gt; &gt; [X] what BLD stands for
&gt; (assuming it's a particular piece/corner of the cube)

I realized I overlooked that and that BLD has two different meanings.
I propose to replace it with BRD to eliminate all possible confusion.
 
&gt; &gt; [X] a 4x4x4
&gt; &gt; [X] .. and can solve it
&gt; (not the physical one, but the computer one for sure)

That doesn't count, though; everybody 'has' a computer one (unless you
programmed it yourself, in which case you can give yourself an
auxiliary point or something). You can check off "and can solve it",
though, even if you don't have one, as long as you can restore it to a
proper solved state.

&gt; &gt; [ ] other Rubik non-twisting merchandise 
&gt; I didn't even know there was any.

Oh, there's plenty. Rubik's Eclipse, Rubik's Infinity, and Rubik's Tac
Toe are out now, and there are a lot of older ones like Rubik's ZigZaw.

&gt; &gt; [ ] knockoff Cubes
&gt; Not sure what you mean - he didn't patent it, right?

That's the thing - he does have a patent. Any cube made for profit
without his permission or his company's permission is a knockoff Cube.
Note that I use Cube with a capital C - a Rubik's Cube, just maybe not
by Rubik, not anything cube-shaped.

&gt; &gt; [X] a website on Rubik's Cube-related puzzles
&gt; &gt; [X] .. which is famous
&gt; (Kind of, but it's hosted at Jessica's page and I haven't updated it 
&gt; in a while.)

It doesn't matter if you update it or not. Although what site is it?
How famous is it?

&gt; &gt; [ ] a WR
&gt; I've got more than unofficial world record for the computer cubes up 
&gt; at oinkleburger/puzzlingaddiction. Do they count?

Meh, sure. Unless somebody beats you. :)

&gt; &gt; [ ] .. .. including an Eastsheen 2x2x2
&gt; (No, that one's broken!)

I put that one on because Eastsheen 2x2x2s are notoriously difficult
to disassemble. I'm surprised Macky knows how.

&gt; &gt; [X] how to solve the Rubik's Magic
&gt; &gt; [X] .. in less than three seconds

Teach me how! Please!

&gt; &gt; [X] what the Superflip is
&gt; &gt; [X] .. an optimal solution
&gt; (to the superflip, or just any optimal solution?)
&gt; (I'm going to cheat here by specifying a long set of generators so 
&gt; that I am bound to be optimal! But off the top of my head I don't 
&gt; know an optimal solution to superflip in any of the standard metrics)

An optimal solution specifically for the superflip. That's what the
indentation is for. The point here is to have memorized an optimal
solution to the superflip. For the "all optimal solutions" I'm looking
for the ones in quarter- and face-turn notation, any others are extra
credit (like slice notation, axis notation, Fxyz notation, clockwise
turn notation, whatever).

&gt; &gt; [ ] with thick gloves
&gt; (probably, but I haven't tried)

You should. It's easy.

&gt; &gt; [ ] on a keychain cube
&gt; (with thick gloves on a keychain cube? or just solve a keychain 
&gt; cube? The latter yes probably, the former probably not.)

Just solve a keychain cube. On the newer version it isn't indented.
Extra credit for both, though. Maybe I'll add it next version.

&gt; &gt; [X] in front of a crowd
&gt; (at least if I am the only cubist there)

Does that really make a difference?

&gt; &gt; [X] and teach others to solve it
&gt; I taught some people to solve blindfolded.

I'd like to learn, myself. I can't stand all the "imagine labeling
your cube, spend the next ten minutes figuring out the notation, then
group everything together, etc etc" stuff.

&gt; &gt; [ ] and do so more than a hundred times a day
&gt; (Is that teach others to solve it more than 100 times a day?)

Heh, no. I'd be surprised if anyone converted 100 non-cubists in a month.

&gt; &gt; [ ] but I don't want to open any of my MIB cubes
&gt; (No idea what that means - MIB never appeared as an acronym above.)

Sorry. Mint In Box. That is - do you have unopened cubes with mint
packaging that you would use except that you don't want to open them?

&gt; [ ] on a "flat cube" on the computer
&gt; (Don't know what that is.)

This is a slightly more difficult computer cube where no perspective
is even attempted and all stickers are laid as flat, parallel squares
on the screen. Extra points if you can do it when the stickers are
arranged in a weird pattern.

&gt; &gt; [X] in my head
&gt; Surely, that's what one does with blindfold cubing.

I should remove this, unless I can think of some gibberish like "but
you have to visualize it!"

&gt; &gt; [X] to any possible pattern
&gt; It's basically the same problem

As what? I mean, if you're into an advanced method you might have
conceptual problems with solving to a Giant Meson or a 6-H pattern.

&gt; &gt; [X] by telling someone what moves to make
&gt; Same again

Except when they can't see the cube. They do the moves you tell them
to, and when they remove the blindfold they've solved it.

&gt; &gt; [ ] by doing the moves someone tells me to make
&gt; Whether I can do that depends entirely on whether I have competent 
&gt; instruction on what moves to make!

True. Should be on the "to remove" list.

&gt; &gt; [X] with one hand
&gt; (Blindfolded too)

Heh. Nice.

&gt; &gt; [ ] with one in each hand simultaneously

Errata: You don't actually have to be able to concentrate on both
cubes at once, although that would be cool.

&gt; &gt; [X] choosing one side to never twist
&gt; (I guess so, but not the supercube generally because then it may not 
&gt; be possible.)

Of course not. Just on a normal cube. It's a fun excercise to turn the
D face and then solve it without turning the D face again.

&gt; &gt; [X] in the 2-generator subgroup
&gt; (which one, if you mean &lt;U,R&gt;, I think I probably can. If you mean 
&gt; the full group - which is in fact a 2-generator group - then I can 
&gt; do that too, but it takes a long time.)

What do you mean, the full group is in fact a 2-generator group? I
mean the &lt;U,R&gt; group thing.

&gt; &gt; [ ] while drunk (or high)
&gt; I've solved it in a plane - does that count?

Heh. That's a good idea to add. I haven't done it in a plane, but I'm
traveling to France in three weeks and I'm definately bringing along
my Eastsheen 5-by.

&gt; Can I get a point for inventing a method?

Not in this version, but in the next version definately.

&gt; Can I get a point for obtaining an optimization result? (Diameter of 
&gt; the orientation subgroup.)

What do you mean exactly by the diameter of the orientation subgroup?

    Oh yeah, I had a lot of problems with that.  Hmmm... okay, take your 
solved cube and do the following:

F U' F2 U F

Okay, so let's say you do a white cross and you scramble with yellow on 
top and green in front.  Ignore the orange/green pair for now.  Let's 
say that was was in the red/green slot and was unavailable.  Let's do 
the green red pair.  Well... notice you have the corner free but the 
edge is in the wrong place.

No problem, do U'.  This move lines up the red/green corner with the 
red/green edge.

Now, if this pair were in the right slot, we'd do the full algorithm.  
It's not though, so we're going to do half of the algorithm, then 
adjust the U, and then put it in.  Here's what I'm talking about.

Do:  U F' U' F

Notice now, the green/red pair is that position where it only takes a 3 
move algorithm to put that slot in.  Well, go ahead and do that.  
Sometimes, you might have to do a U turn to AUF (adjust U face... 
whoa... I never thought I'd use that) before putting in the pair.

Finish off with:  F U' F'.

on 4x4 programs, and how they really can't be valid because of the 
_needed_ computer power.  Well what exactly would be needed for there 
to be a "cube explorer" for the 4x4? or the 5x5?

A clever idea. Cube Explorer isn't so fast because it brutally 
explores the full cube state in some efficient way, but because it 
does it in two nicely separated steps, combining the first two and the 
last two steps of the 4-step Thistlethwaite algorithm. Each of the 2 
steps does use brute force, though. Think about normal speedsolving. 
The bigger the puzzle gets, the more steps you need. For a 4x4 or 5x5 
Cube Explorer I guess you'd need a few more steps, since each step can 
be just so complex. But finding nice steps would be the first goal...

    Yeah but I'm sure Macky uses a lot of stuff to influence the last 
layer with the last c/e pair.  This still counts as Fridrich of 
course, but a sort of easier Fridrich since the odds for the OLLs 
change.  Also, in a significant portion of the videos I've seen of 
Macky he ends with an edge three cycle, which implies liberal use of 
COLL, at least for video solves :-D

I've also wondered that.  What is the limit of Fridrich assuming 
just OLL/PLL without influencing the LL?  (Of course allowing as 
many F2L tricks as you can manage.)

Btw, I'm almost done learning the ZBF2L, I will be finished learning 
in about 2 weeks at my current pace, and after that I will start 
working on improving recognition on the newest cases of course.  In 
about a month I will try doing an average and see how it affects my 
times.  I'm very optimistic that recognition time will be 
insignificantly slower than normal F2L with practice (though still 
slower of course since the last slot of the F2L becomes a "look"

Macky doesn't use ZBF2L tricks or even straight up algs, but then

    Hi all, 

Today I went to a store to buy a Rubik's cube. 
So I opened the package and played a little bit with three
cubes, but they were all stiff, so I ended up not buying one.
I am not sure if that is the case for all new cubes, 
but I remember someone here in the group saying that 
he has bought a cube from Walmart and it went smooth right 
from the beginning. 

Now my question:
If you buy a new cube, how do you know that it is a good speedcube?
(I tried to open the cube by a pop to see if it had arched centers but
the cube was still too stiff)

Have you ever encountered a case where the layers were easy
turn right from the beginning?

    I prefer the Rubiks.com DIY cubes.  If you prepare them right, they 
are smooth right from the beginning.  All cubes I've ever bought at 
a store have been stiff, though some can be lubed and prepared to be 
excellent for speedcubing.

    Yeah I have.

Actually, my best speedcubes were all great to turn from the beginning. 
  I mean, they weren't absolutely fabulous, but I could do pretty decent 
times with those cubes.  Back when I bought my cube no. 2 and cube no. 
3, I was averaging about 35 to 40 seconds and I could solve the cube at 
about the same times.

Maybe ask a store if you can open the boxes up and test them out?

    Thanks chris for putting this in a much better light than previously 
what was being done. 

I posted this question before and would really like an answer. Are 
there that many people trying to cheat and does not the judge have 
final say. I ask because I have never been to competition. While 
having never been I still get a feeling of honesty that pervades us. 
The honor system used on jess' site for the longest time worked quit 
well save the fact that some inet posers would arrive now and again 
or we would make a mistake. So he had to keep cleaning the times. 

I have yet to use either timer. I like the ideas of both and feel 
that they, while stronger each in specific areas, are basically on 
equal footing from my stand point. I want them both and I would not 
feel mistreated in the least were I to go to competition and see that 
either one was in use. So long as all people at that competition are 
using the same thing I would feel things are being handled fairly. 

I really like the Idea of having scrambles and other options. When I 
mix my cube I usually end with one of the hardest possible solves at 
least for me to do. When I do use algs for mixing provided by pc the 
mixes are more consistent. This would make my practice different. I 
have actually considered making some device to give me scrambles and 
for me that would be a large plus to the rubiks. Realistically I will 
buy both because I like options. 

Here area couple of solutions for one of the issues for each timer. 

Stackmat issue: reset button is easily pressed while finishing solve. 
    This could be handled by using something to build a wall around 
the reset button thus recessing it. There are several things that 
could be used. 

Rubik's issue: possible cheat of U or D either blatantly or 
unintentionally. 

     Put a wall on the timer that will be perpendicular. The whole 
timer could then be placed on a 45 degree angle like Gilles suggested 
on this page http://grrroux.free.fr/2flat.jpg. This makes it fair for 
left or right hands still and stops the cheat factor. It also reduces 
the chance of misalignment were someone to drop it into the v shape.

&gt; Although I've ordered a stackmat for my birthday!
&gt; When I broke the world record for one hand it was timed by a guy 
holding a
&gt; stop watch - is that so terrible!  It also has pros and cons of 
course but
&gt; possibly no more than the two options already under discussion.  
Higher

&gt; In the interest of being objective I just realized one more con I
&gt; forgot to include about the Stackmat2 that I think is definitely 
worth
&gt; mentioning.
&gt; 
&gt; The reset button is very close the base next to the right hand pad.
&gt; If you bring your right hand down too close to the upraised middle
&gt; portion, the fleshy part of your thumb will hit the reset button and
&gt; you will lose the time before even seeing what it was.
&gt; 
&gt; I discovered this when practicing some blindfolded solves, and I 
think
&gt; it could also happen to those who are unfamiliar and/or using the
&gt; stackmat for the first time.
&gt; 
&gt; Simply that the possibility is there is a con, and worth 
considering.
&gt;  Though I said in my last message that I prefer the stackmat given 
all
&gt; the current information, this con make me even more willing to go 
over
&gt; to the rubik timer if that U-face problem can be fixed.

&gt; &gt; This message is long, but I don't feel that there has been any
&gt; &gt; objective debate about this issue yet.  Everyone is either for or
&gt; &gt; against the timer(s) of their choice right from the start of their
&gt; &gt; messages and, frankly, it is getting annoying and I find the
&gt; &gt; arguments childish.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here is my attempt at the first objective argument.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; --------------------
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think in favor of the Rubikstimer that it is more intuitive to
&gt; &gt; &gt; use for someone who has never used a stackmat or a the new
&gt; &gt; &gt; timer. Just pick it up and put it down.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -----------------
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ... has there been any problem with using the Stackmats that we
&gt; &gt; &gt; need to change our timer?  It seems to me that they are (almost)
&gt; &gt; &gt; optimal for ensuring fair competitions, preventing cheating, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; recording accurate times.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -----------------
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (end replies from other messages)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems that everyone has already made their decision as to which
&gt; &gt; timer they like, and no one seems willing to compromise.  Well 
here
&gt; &gt; is my attempt to try to list pros and cons and lets decide this.
&gt; &gt; Obviously a lot of money and time is being spent in developing 
this
&gt; &gt; new Rubik's timer, so let's not bash it down before even trying it
&gt; &gt; just because the stackmat has worked so far.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ----
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Stackmat pros:
&gt; &gt; 1) Timer cannot start before hands touch the cube.  Simply 
specify a
&gt; &gt; rough distance that is further than fingers can reach for the 
intial
&gt; &gt; start position of the cube and all these problems about 
manipulating
&gt; &gt; before starting the timer dissapear.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2) It is *very* difficult to simultaneously stop the timer and
&gt; &gt; continue doing a move.  The cube has to end up on the table, and
&gt; &gt; bringing it down to the mat and trying to do a move all very 
quickly
&gt; &gt; and all at the same time is very hard.  This is not a likely 
option
&gt; &gt; for a common "cheat"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Stackmat cons:
&gt; &gt; 1) If you are not used to the distance between the hand pads, you
&gt; &gt; can think you've stopped the timer, but not applied enough 
pressure
&gt; &gt; to the pads correctly and it won't stop.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2) If you haven't practiced bringing your cube to the timer along
&gt; &gt; with your hands, it seems the only reasonable way to stop it 
quickly
&gt; &gt; is to drop your cube.  This leads to misaligned faces and damage 
to
&gt; &gt; larger/more fragile cubes/puzzles.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3) The final time is how long it takes to pick up the cube from
&gt; &gt; hands flat on the table, solve it, bring the cube back down to the
&gt; &gt; table and place your hands in their original start positions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4) High cost makes it difficult for most to buy one to practice 
and
&gt; &gt; get used to it before competitions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ---------
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Rubik's Timer pros:
&gt; &gt; 1) Assuming someone doesn't cheat, you could lift the cube from 
the
&gt; &gt; optical sensor and start solving more fluidly and quickly than 
from
&gt; &gt; the start pads of a stackmat.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2) Nearing the end of the solve you could "hover" over the timer,
&gt; &gt; close to the table, for the last few moves and lightly set down 
your
&gt; &gt; cube to stop it rather than practicing the "bring your cube to the
&gt; &gt; table" stackmat manuever.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3) The final time is how long it takes to pick up the cube (not 
from
&gt; &gt; hands flat on the table, regardless of whether this is required as
&gt; &gt; procedure or not for the start); plus solve the cube, plus set the
&gt; &gt; cube back down.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Rubik's Timer cons:
&gt; &gt; 1) It is possible to misalign the U layer from the scramble before
&gt; &gt; even starting the timer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2) It is possible to set the cube down, thus stopping the timer, 
and
&gt; &gt; finishing the final portion of a U turn (even if this is
&gt; &gt; unintentional).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3) If trying to go quickly, you may slam your cube down too hard,
&gt; &gt; causing damage (this can easily be fixed with padding).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ------------------
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't know how much the Rubik's timer will cost, but that is
&gt; &gt; obviously going to be either a pro or con.  Notice I haven't
&gt; &gt; included anything about the Rubik's timer's ability to provide
&gt; &gt; scrambles, do averages etc..  I think this is totally and wholly
&gt; &gt; irrelevant to the issue of which timer to use in competitions,
&gt; &gt; though I think it is an interesting and useful addition to the 
timer
&gt; &gt; itself.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My objective consensus on this issue is that the cons of the 
Rubik's
&gt; &gt; timer will likely lead to video analysis for potential new records
&gt; &gt; to see if any sort of U turn was down before or after the timer 
was
&gt; &gt; started/stopped.  The pros of the Rubik timer are nice, in that it
&gt; &gt; times a closer margin around just the solve than the stackmat 
does.
&gt; &gt; Also the fact that it is easy to learn how to efficiently use a
&gt; &gt; Rubik's timer is a big pro in my opinion.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Subjectively, the cons for the Rubik timer, to me, heavily 
outweigh
&gt; &gt; the pros in that I don't want to lose a fast solve becuase, on
&gt; &gt; watching the video analysis of a fast solve, I hit the U layer as 
my
&gt; &gt; hands grabbed the cube and before I picked it up.  I would be very
&gt; &gt; frustrated by the potential time disqualifications this timer 
would
&gt; &gt; bring to competitions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Objectively looking at the stackmat it has about as many cons as 
the
&gt; &gt; rubik timer, but it doesn't include the likelihood of a bad turn
&gt; &gt; before starting the solve, as the rubik timer does.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Disturbing for me about the stackmat is that it times a larger
&gt; &gt; margin around the solve than the Rubik's timer, and that it takes
&gt; &gt; lots of practice and familiarity with a Stackmat to use it
&gt; &gt; efficiently in a competition.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Personally I think both timers are bad, but both are also good.
&gt; &gt; Subjectively now, I think the cons of the rubik's timer are pretty
&gt; &gt; large.  I wouldn't want to use one in a competition as the timer 
is
&gt; &gt; designed right now, with the likelihood of disqualified records 
and
&gt; &gt; fast solves because of this "U-face problem".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I also don't like the stackmat because it times a larger margin of
&gt; &gt; the solve that we are interested in.  However this may be 
necessary
&gt; &gt; to ensure good flow and ease of timing in a competition.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Personally I think both timers suck and we should all go to video
&gt; &gt; analysis for it's purity sake.  However this too has huge problems
&gt; &gt; with money and supplies.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I say that last unreasonable option (and it is most unreasonable, 
I
&gt; &gt; would never campaing in favor of completely video analysis
&gt; &gt; tournaments) only to say that I think both timers suck, I am not 
in
&gt; &gt; either camp.  However, based on the qualifications  of the Rubik's
&gt; &gt; timer and my opinions as a competitor, I right now prefer the
&gt; &gt; stackmat simply as a lesser of two evils.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If the "U-face problem" could be fixed with the start and stop of
&gt; &gt; the solve on the Rubik's timer, I would greatly prefer the Rubik's
&gt; &gt; timer over the stackmat as it has better pros and (with the 
absence
&gt; &gt; of those two huge cons on my list), not so many cons left.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Come one guys, stop being so subjective and partial and not even
&gt; &gt; giving valid arguments.  We're all smarter and better than that.
&gt; &gt; Just because the Stackmat has worked before doesn't mean it's a
&gt; &gt; great timer and we need to accept everything status quo.  Also, 
just
&gt; &gt; because the Rubik's timer has so many great pros doesn't make it a
&gt; &gt; great timer either, as a competitor I am VERY nervous about this
&gt; &gt; problem with U face turns on the start and stop.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; **Both timer have big downfalls**  So don't get all high and 
mighty
&gt; &gt; in supporting your favorite.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Both timer suck, but in my opinion with all the information on 
both
&gt; &gt; timers, I would prefer to have a stackmat in front of me in a
&gt; &gt; competition over a Rubik's timer until this "U-face problem" is
&gt; &gt; fixed on the Rubik's timer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If and when the U-face problem is fixed, I would much rather have 
a
&gt; &gt; Rubik's timer in front of me during a competition.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My two (and hopefully sufficiently objective) cents,
&gt; &gt; Chris
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; P.S.  Please let's continue this discussion with arguments about 
the
&gt; &gt; pros and cons of these timers, and not advertisements about how 
your
&gt; &gt; favorite time is the √ºbertimer and all other ones are crap.

    I have bought most of my cubes at toy r' us and walmart. The thing i 
have found best is to have an old cube you can still solve with you. 
go in and open the boxes. test them. you may have to try a few cubes 
but you should find one that is relatively equal on all sides and 
fairly loose. Then just spray prestone silicone high viscosity 
formula in and mix cube until it gets hard to turn on all sides. This 
means the liquid(you don't have to use alot at all) is spread. Let 
dry and you should have a good turing cube that will do nothing but 
get faster as you use it. 

I have noticed that on the new cubes with the stand included. They 
are taping he sides of this container making it harder to check. I 
don't like that and have started buying diy's.

    &gt; How long did it take you to learn the ZBF2L?

Hi,

I haven't finished yet, I'm actually still working on it.  So far I
know a little over 100 of the ZBF2L cases (each one has a reflection
as well, so a little over 200 if you count reflections as separate
algs).  I still have about 44 cases left to learn (88 if you count
reflections).  I started Jan 27, so I've been learning for 33 days.

I took an average just now using the VH system (so ZBF2L followed by
COLL followed by PLL, 3 looks total) with (13.5/19) + (5/19)*(1/8) =
74.34% of ZBF2L.  Again I'm still learning the cases and I often have
to take several seconds to recognize the case I do have.  However, I
am getting excited, I'm already almost sub-20 again!  I haven't taken
many averages since I started learning, but this is my fastest yet so far.

18.05 17.02 21.13 (15.58) 24.95 (26.32) 21.20 23.01 26.14 21.87 19.07
16.93 = 20.94

If you are interested in learning ZBF2L, you should!  I think it has
lots of benefits and helps your times a lot, though I don't have any
evidence of this yet.  If anyone else uses ZBF2L please post an
average!  I know Dan H, Lars V. and I are vocal about learning the
method, as well as Ron and Zbigniew obviously.  Ron, Zbigniew, how
much of the system do you guys use by now?  I think cubers should help
others cubers learn.  I know for a fact that I am not the person who
uses the most ZBF2L algs out there.  So please, if you use ZBF2L speak up!

    Hello fellow speedcubers! :)

I am having some difficulty finding the right lubricant for my Rubik's
cube. I know it should be silicon based but I was wondering if anyone
could suggest the brand name of the lubricant that could be found in
southern California. (Around L.A.)Name of the department store would
be very helpful!

I recently bought one from home depot called, Gunk 12 Oz. Gunk Heavy
Duty Silicone Spray Lubricant.

When I applied this on my cube, it made it worse and made it so much
louder. The smell was unbearable too. Can anyone help me please???!!

    go to walmart and get preston silicone lubricant from the car section.  it is cheap i think i got them for less than $2.  ppl say that the lub u are using, gunk, doesn't work on cubes.  well i personally use gunk on my japanese packaging cube, it works well with those plastic.

    by what i understand the ZB method actually cuts your 1look solve in 1/4 because when you finishing off your LL you are orienting crosses and it cuts the LL cases from 1211 down to around 300


 

If you already know the entire fridrich system, how many algorithms

    Not to imply that cheating is a big problem or anything, but since 
we're talking about it, I don't think anyone has mentioned the perhaps 
most practical and serious form.

Since ever competitor gets the same mix, I can look at those solving 
before me and study the position for much longer than 15 seconds. Well, 
personally I can't do much with it, but with blindfolders being able to 
memorize the entire cube in around a minute, I have to think others 
could. And even I could take a few pictures with a digital camera and 
reconstruct the entire position in a few minutes.

One way to fix that would be to not let competitors see previous 
attempt in the same round, as was done in Budapest 1982, but that makes 
it a lot less fun and requires more organizing resources. And to stop 
cooperating competitors you'd have to take away people's cell phones.

The rounds go by pretty quickly in the Caltech tournaments, and that 
does minimize the risk, but the only real way to remove this problem 
seems to be to have a unique random mix for each individual solve. That 
would take away a bit of the fun, but I don''t think that would make 
the competitions any less fair.


/Lars
PS. I *really* like the two plane version of the rubik timer that 
several people suggested. It's much simpler than my suggestion, and 
solves both the U problem and the 2 second problem.

&gt; I realized I overlooked that and that BLD has two different

&gt; I propose to replace it with BRD to eliminate all possible 
confusion.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; [X] a 4x4x4
&gt; &gt; &gt; [X] .. and can solve it
&gt; &gt; (not the physical one, but the computer one for sure)
&gt; 
&gt; That doesn't count, though; everybody 'has' a computer one (unless 
you
&gt; programmed it yourself, in which case you can give yourself an
&gt; auxiliary point or something). You can check off "and can solve 
it",
&gt; though, even if you don't have one, as long as you can restore it 
to a
&gt; proper solved state.

No, I have a real-life one - but I can only solve it in under 2 
minutes on a computer cube (like oinkleburger). Similarly, I have a 
real 5x5x5 one but I can only solve it in under 2 minutes on 
oinkleburger.

&gt; Not sure what you mean - he didn't patent it, right?

&gt;That's the thing - he does have a patent. Any cube made for profit
&gt;without his permission or his company's permission is a knockoff 
&gt;Cube.

Are you sure he does? I thought he had one on all his subsequent 
puzzles (like magic and so on) but not on the original cube.

&gt; &gt; [X] in front of a crowd
&gt; (at least if I am the only cubist there)

&gt;Does that really make a difference?

Yes - it's very hard to concentrate if there's other clicking in the 
background (as I found out last August).

&gt; &gt; [ ] but I don't want to open any of my MIB cubes
&gt; (No idea what that means - MIB never appeared as an acronym above.)

&gt;Sorry. Mint In Box. That is - do you have unopened cubes with mint
&gt;packaging that you would use except that you don't want to open 
&gt;them?

And here's me thinking it might be a Men In Black Cube (like a 
Simpsons cube only with Will Smith and that they might be hyper-
rare).

&gt; &gt; [X] in my head
&gt; Surely, that's what one does with blindfold cubing.

&gt;I should remove this, unless I can think of some gibberish like "but
&gt;you have to visualize it!"

But I don't visualize it.

&gt; &gt; [X] to any possible pattern
&gt; It's basically the same problem

&gt;As what? I mean, if you're into an advanced method you might have
&gt;conceptual problems with solving to a Giant Meson or a 6-H pattern.

As solving to any other state without looking/in one's head.

&gt; &gt; [X] by telling someone what moves to make
&gt; Same again

&gt;Except when they can't see the cube. They do the moves you tell them
&gt;to, and when they remove the blindfold they've solved it.

Oh, I thought you meant I can't see it and tell someone what to do 
and they follow the instructions and it ends up solved. I'm not sure 
it makes a difference if they can't see it.

&gt;What do you mean, the full group is in fact a 2-generator group? I
&gt;mean the &lt;U,R&gt; group thing.

I mean there are moves X, Y such that the cube group is just &lt;X,Y&gt; - 
that is any move can be done using just X and Y.

&gt;What do you mean exactly by the diameter of the orientation 
&gt;subgroup?

The superflip takes 20 moves (HTM, a QTM result would be better) - 
that's well known. Any other move that just involves flipping 
edges/twisting corners in place can also be done in 20 or fewer 
moves (HTM) so 20 is the diameter of the orientation subgroup in the 
HTM. There are several positions requiring 20 moves (of the 66 
classes which superflip the edges, 10 require 20 moves), but of the 
94,518 classes I've recently got to the point where less than 20,000 
require 20 moves and I'm sure that I can knock that down a fair bit 
more.

    As you might have guessed I'm in the process of learning the L2L4. I'm
going really slow at the moment though as my cubing interest really
have it's ups and downs. 

I'm also doing everything with the first layer down and finding and

As for now I only know the algs for step 3, but all of them can pretty

    Hi Gustav
Step 3 is a good place to start!  How fast are you with this.  I'm not super
fast with any method (yet!) - I have got down to averaging around 30 seconds
with step 3 - which is faster than I have been with any other method so its
certainly not slowing me down.

Thanks for the reply

I'm sure he did. On January 30, 1975. That's why I was interviewed for

Please say "Stackmat 2". The first version doesn't have that problem. 
Also I prefer it for Magic solves because it's flat.

&gt;      Put a wall on the timer that will be perpendicular. The whole 
&gt; timer could then be placed on a 45 degree angle like Gilles 
suggested 
&gt; on this page http://grrroux.free.fr/2flat.jpg.

We should do tests then what's the easier way to stop the timer, put 
your hands down or put the cube against two walls.

Cheers!

&gt; I have bought most of my cubes at toy r' us and walmart. The thing i 
&gt; have found best is to have an old cube you can still solve with you. 
&gt; go in and open the boxes. test them. you may have to try a few cubes 
&gt; but you should find one that is relatively equal on all sides and 
&gt; fairly loose. Then just spray prestone silicone high viscosity 
&gt; formula in and mix cube until it gets hard to turn on all sides. 

You don't mention it but I hope between trying cubes and spraying into 
one you've paid for it? ;-)

    Hi,

I'd like to add that up until now, I haven't used anything more than 
the basic set of Fridrich algorithms for speedsolving and I've set 
numerous averages under 16 seconds with it in practice. So the "old" 
17 second limit has certainly been surpassed now due to the increasing 
standard of speedcubers we have nowadays. Just have a look at the 
unofficial 3x3x3 rankings on speedcubing.com.

&gt; I started Jan 27, so I've been learning for 33 days.
&gt; 
&gt; I took an average just now using the VH system (so ZBF2L followed by
&gt; COLL followed by PLL, 3 looks total) with (13.5/19) + (5/19)*(1/8) =
&gt; 74.34% of ZBF2L. 

Chris, I'm so amazed at how fast you go about learning all this. It's 
been an inspiration to me. I also know about 1/3 of the ZBF2L system 
now and I'm making fast progress. I'm convinced that you can become a 
bit faster using VH if you master the complete ZBF2L. As you said the 
final pair will be just as fast with practice, COLL is only slightly 
slower than OLL but you always get a fast finish (mostly 3-cycle 
edges). I'm thinking about learning one additional set of 40 COLL 
algorithms (1 for each corner case) after I've finished learning the 
complete F2L so I can always finish with 3-cycle edges. That would 
reduce the final step to close to one second.

But the most important thing to me is that learning ZBF2L is a lot of 
fun! And you don't _really_ have to learn 305 distinct algorithms. You 
can go a long way by just experimenting with breaking up pairs, 
putting them back together and moving empty slots. I figured out over 
160 cases myself just using pencil, paper and a cube. After that, it 
all made much more sense to me.

Have fun,

    This is my next version of the Rubik's Cube Test. It includes a few
other things and some notes.

Notes and Errata:

1. Indentation indicates that something is a subcategory of or is
based on a previous thing - it isn't there for ornamentation only. In
certain purposes, you may check it if you haven't checked its
category, but that's rare.

2. A cube is an object in the shape of a cube. A Cube is a Rubik's
Cube, either official or knockoff (i.e. not authorized by Rubik).

3. If there are more than one box near a clue, and it applies to you,
check both or all of those boxes. Note that indentation will go as it
usually is:

    I think 109 or so... I did mark some things I think I can do though 
haven't actually done yet, like solving above my head or solve any 
MxNxP cube (gave myself a half point since I'd *assume* understanding 
permutation parities and commutators helps you solve all of those).

   Would you consider adding the following?

[ ] 500 algorithms

by the "Own Method" checkbox
[ ] solved the cube myself, the first time

[ ] 60 % of the algorithms I use are my own

(for example, if you do 100% you check all the boxes)

I have bought most of my cubes at toy r' us and walmart. The thing i
have found best is to have an old cube you can still solve with you.
go in and open the boxes. test them. you may have to try a few cubes
but you should find one that is relatively equal on all sides and
fairly loose. Then just spray prestone silicone high viscosity
formula in and mix cube until it gets hard to turn on all sides. This
means the liquid(you don't have to use alot at all) is spread. Let
dry and you should have a good turning cube that will do nothing but
get faster as you use it. it drys in one hour at most

    I found that pledge works really well. Just spray it in, let it dry,
and it is super slick. Make sure that you use the lemon one though. It
smells better. =)

    I have a friend that also bought the "gunk heavy silicon spray". he 
used it on his cube and says that it got stuck.. and smells horribly 
bad. even after he washed off the lubricant... its was getting 
pretty stiff. I would recomend using a silcion based spray with VERY 
VERY HIGH viscosity.. it will make that cube spin! But What lube DO 
people like Fridrich or Lars Use or other world champions???

&gt; This is my next version of the Rubik's Cube Test. It includes a few
&gt; other things and some notes.
&gt; 
&gt; Notes and Errata:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Indentation indicates that something is a subcategory of or is
&gt; based on a previous thing - it isn't there for ornamentation only. 
In
&gt; certain purposes, you may check it if you haven't checked its
&gt; category, but that's rare.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. A cube is an object in the shape of a cube. A Cube is a Rubik's
&gt; Cube, either official or knockoff (i.e. not authorized by Rubik).
&gt; 
&gt; 3. If there are more than one box near a clue, and it applies to 
you,
&gt; check both or all of those boxes. Note that indentation will go as 
it
&gt; usually is:
&gt; [ ][ ] have met him

Maybe the test should be put in the file or database sections after a

&gt; 
&gt; Notes and Errata:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Indentation indicates that something is a subcategory of or is
&gt; based on a previous thing - it isn't there for ornamentation only. 
In
&gt; certain purposes, you may check it if you haven't checked its
&gt; category, but that's rare.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. A cube is an object in the shape of a cube. A Cube is a Rubik's
&gt; Cube, either official or knockoff (i.e. not authorized by Rubik).
&gt; 
&gt; 3. If there are more than one box near a clue, and it applies to 
you,
&gt; check both or all of those boxes. Note that indentation will go as 
it
&gt; usually is:
&gt; [ ][ ] have met him

    Lars,

I'm absolutely amazed at how you can get sub-16 averages with only
Fridrich.  I was able to get sub-18 using just Fridrich but I had to
learn all of COLL before I ever started getting sub-17 averages.  I
still have never even gotten sub-16.  I'm hoping these new algs will
help me with that though.

Lars that's quite impressive in my opinion.  I can't imagine the times
you'll will get when you know ZB in full.

&gt; &gt; I took an average just now using the VH system (so ZBF2L followed by
&gt; &gt; COLL followed by PLL, 3 looks total) with (13.5/19) + (5/19)*(1/8) =
&gt; &gt; 74.34% of ZBF2L. 
&gt; 
&gt; Chris, I'm so amazed at how fast you go about learning all this. It's 
&gt; been an inspiration to me. I also know about 1/3 of the ZBF2L system 
&gt; now and I'm making fast progress.

It turns out I did my calculations incorrectly.  I don't in fact know
74.34% of ZBF2L.  I miscalculated the number of total cases and so
that number is wrong.  I just went through and looked more thoroughly
and there are 157 total ZBF2L cases, and I know 101 so far.  So that's
64.33% not 74.34%  So I know almost 2/3 so far.

Wow, so yeah I think I can have the rest of it learned in a little
over three weeks from now based on my previous progress, not two.

Sorry for the misstatement, I wanted to post again to clear that up.

So I think it will be possible to have learned all the algs in a
little over two months total.

    The ZB method is great, because learning the most
basic cases can benefit your time.  After learning
40-50 (including inverses) of the most basic cases
shaved about a second off my average.  iThis happened
most because I knew what to expect for my LL case. 
Instead of anticipating 57 cases, I only had to
anticipate 7.  Not only that, sometimes it is possible
to know the orientation case before you even complete
your f2l algorithm.

ZB algs are incredibly easy to memorize.  I can
comfortably learn 10 or more in a week and recall them
easily.  It is not a matter of learning algoritms, but
developing a greater intuitive sense.  I noticed after
a few weeks of fooling around with the ZB method, I'm
able to figure out nearly optimal sequences with no
outside assistance.  Of course this information is
already familiar with many people.

Also, out of curiousity, what are the number of algs
for learning this system:

insert c/e pair+ orient corners

I know this is many more cases, and likely more
difficult in recognition, but if anyone wants to flex
their math muscles, feel free.

I think it should be 527 cases for last c/e pair + orient corners.

17 of the F2L cases are asymmetrical and allow all 27 different corner
orientation states.

4 of the cases have the F2L pieces already in their slot so they only
allow the 7 corner orientation cases due to symmetry.

2 of the cases are symmetrical across a line from BUL to FDR and so
each case only allows 20 possibly different corner orientations giving
40 for both of those together.

so 17*27 + 4*7 + 2*20 = 527

It's early in the morning and I only tried to do this in my head so
I'm going to call this an estimate just in case it comes out wrong.  I
think it will be at least fairly close to the actual number if it is
wrong though.  I'll do a more thorough count later (have to get to
class soon).

&gt; Yeah but I'm sure Macky uses a lot of stuff to influence the last

&gt; course, but a sort of easier Fridrich since the odds for the OLLs 
&gt; change.  Also, in a significant portion of the videos I've seen of 
&gt; Macky he ends with an edge three cycle, which implies liberal use 
of 
&gt; COLL, at least for video solves :-D
&gt; 
&gt; I've also wondered that.  What is the limit of Fridrich assuming 
&gt; just OLL/PLL without influencing the LL?  (Of course allowing as 
&gt; many F2L tricks as you can manage.)
&gt; 
&gt; Btw, I'm almost done learning the ZBF2L, I will be finished 
learning 
&gt; in about 2 weeks at my current pace, and after that I will start 
&gt; working on improving recognition on the newest cases of course.  
In 
&gt; about a month I will try doing an average and see how it affects 
my 
&gt; times.  I'm very optimistic that recognition time will be 
&gt; insignificantly slower than normal F2L with practice (though still 
&gt; slower of course since the last slot of the F2L becomes a "look" 
&gt; instead of just plain intuition).  I find it hard to believe that 
&gt; Macky doesn't use ZBF2L tricks or even straight up algs, but then 
&gt; again I do admit that it is possible.  Opinion and hearsay :-D

&gt; &gt; What I'm trying to say is, Macky averages sub-15 doing mostly 
just 
&gt; the

    Hi Guys,

There's a 2x2x2 cube for sale at Rubiks.com:

https://secure.rubiks.com/lvl3/index_lvl3.cfm?lan=eng&amp;lvl1=produc&amp;lvl2=rubbrn&amp;lvl3=clasic&amp;lvl4=cubmni
 
  Rubiks.com gives the dimensions as 4 x 4 x 4 cm or 1-5/8 x 1-5/8 x
1-5/8 inches, but all the ones I've seen, including 4 that I have
bought are smaller than this.

  Has anyone bought this mini 2x2x2 cube? I'd like an accurate
measurement of it.

TIA,

David J

I e-mailed him too about ten days ago, I haven't had a reply either.  The 
people who posted about him did say he sometimes takes a while to reply so 
I'd give it time yet.

Ebay quite often has 80s cubes but you have to be quite careful what you 
buy.  The sellers often are not very clear about what it is exactly that 
they're selling though you can get lucky.

    I am going to start making sticker sets for 3x3x3's. Standard colors.
They are a hair smaller than the original stickers and have more
rounded corners for longer life. They are self-sticking vinyl that
will last a very long time. The price is looking like $1 a set. I am
trying to see how many I should make for this first run off which I
will hopefully start sending out next week. If you are interested in
buying a set, please email me at J2005D@... with the amount of
sets you would like to buy in the subject line.
Thank You
Jeremy

Note that I am just trying to get a count on how many I should make
right now, but when I am ready to start selling them, I will go in the
order of who emailed me first.
What it is looking like right now is that I will give you my address
and you can mail me the amount and I will mail you back the stickers.
For 1-4 set, you will need to include a stamp in the envelope to cover
the shipping, and for 5+ set, the shipping will be free.

    I'd like to say that there aren't any defined standards for how many
you need to check to be a cube fanatic. Just compare scores and wait
for the final version (or a more final one, at any rate).

Some extra notes and clarifications:

1. Most important of all - I put the spaces in there so the stuff
would be all nice and aligned. Don't go [x ] or something, that looks
ugly and is not how I intended it at all.

2. Don't mark something you haven't already done unless you're
absolutely, 100% sure you can do it. For example, Steven Pochmann gave
himself a half-point for solving the MxNxP cube because he knows
commutators and permutation stuff. If you just assume you'd be able to
solve it but don't know how hard it actually is, don't go ahead and
say you can.

3. David J asked if I would be willing to include knowing 200, 300,
400, 500 algorithms (and another thing like that). My answer is no. I
think that as you get farther in things get more specialized and
giving points out for each step of the way unnecessarily lowers the
score of beginners who haven't even got 50 algorithms down. I make an
exception for stuff like Blindfold solving because it's such an
important jump. I would, however, add "solved the cube myself" and
"use some of my own algorithms" (but not all or a big list). If I did
that, people who (for example) use optimum F2L algs found by someone
else with a cube program would be cheated of lots of points.

4. A few things from GameofDeath2:
&gt; (Assuming it refers to a particular position on the cube.)
Yes, it does. To everyone, though: if you know one Cube-related
meaning of an abbreviation, you know the abbreviation.
&gt; (I'm guessing one with flags of countries on counts?)
Well, I'd characterize something like that as a different pattern.
&gt; (Allowing for the discrete metric!)
What's that? Counting all moves as one in total? I was thinking more
like slice metric, axial metric (all turns on an axis is one move,
e.g. LR2), something like that.
&gt; (I can, I'm sure, though I haven't tried it)
It's not so bad, but just try on an East Sheen.
&gt; (Well, behind my back, so above my head is a similar problem, I
&gt; think)
No, actually it's rather different. Above the head is a perspective
shift, the point is the change in the view of the cube.
&gt; (I think so.)
Remember, you must solve using only U and R turns.
&gt; (In the sense of in a plane, but I don't think that's what you mean)
No, it's not. Solving in a plane doesn't demonstrate a real
accomplishment any more than doing it at the dentist's waiting room
does. And besides, you could annoy people doing it, which is bad.
&gt; (What happened to Macky?)
0_o I forgot.
&gt; (for reference, a non-cubical Cuboid would be the appropriate
&gt; terminology, but I haven't seen them - except pictures of them)
Or just a cuboid. There are some important ones (3x3x2, 2x2x3, 4x4x5,
2x2x4, 2x2x6) but some people find a way to do it on the computer.
&gt; (in most cases, where applicable, rarely)
Once is enough. Note that "rather than eat" means to skip a meal
because of cubing, "rather than sleep" means to skip a large amount of
sleep (a few hours or the entire night) because of cubing, etc.
&gt; (31x31x31 cube took almost 8 hours and was non-stop *)
Sounds fun and hard. Cool.
&gt; (but not continuously - I had more than a decade off)
That's OK. I don't mind.
&gt; (if you count solving on the web!)
No, actually I don't. The idea is to be so into cubing that you do it
while you're on the web even.


5. I'm sort of surprised at you cubists, some of you can't even
recognize Rubik's face! Or pronounce his name... Some reverence. (Not
that I can pronounce his name either. But go look up WC2003 for a
piccy of him.) By the way, Zauberwurfel and Buvos Kocka are names for
the Cube in German and Hungarian (correct me if I'm wrong) and are
pretty common to see if you go looking around the 'web.

6. Is there an actual WCA that you can join yet?, because if there
isn't, I'm going to delete that [ ].

    IMHO, the best cube mod to start off with is a Siamese Cube order 1, 2, 3 (look it up if you don't know what it means) where you cut some corners and edges in half and glue them back together to make what has the appearance of two cubes fused together, and my next choice would be the Siamese Cube order 8 where a 2x2x2 block is shared - this is made by gluing the spindles together.

    Hi friends,

German Open on April 23, 2005! Your chance to meet other cubers!

So if you are in Europe, then please drop me a line if you are 
interested in coming over. Maybe we can arrange something for you.

You could fly to Amsterdam (on wednesday 20 or thursday 21), stay at 
another cuber's place, then drive with us to Germany on friday 22.
We drive back on saturday night after dinner. Then again you could 
stay at another cuber's place and fly back on sunday 24.

Just think of it. I am sure we can help you out, if you have:
= money for a ticket to Amsterdam (or boat if you are in UK) (I may 
help you to find cheap ones)
= 25 euros for 1 night in a hotel
= 10 euros for entrance fee German Cube Day
= a lot of money to buy a lot of puzzles :-)

German Open is a very nice tournament, with a great atmosphere.

Have fun,

Ron

Well, just lie down flat and solve it as normal. Similarly, if you 
want to solve a cube under water, put a glass of water on the table 
and solve the cube under the table (and under the water).


&gt; 5. I'm sort of surprised at you cubists, some of you can't even

Waaaiiit. I think the question explicitly asked whether I'm "sure" I

    Hello!

Last night I was solving the cube and came up with (for me) a new way 
to slove the F2L. I¬¥m sure someone has already tried this or is using 
it but I haven¬¥t seen it on any sites.
This is some kind of a crossing between Petrus and Fridrich methods.

Step 1: Make a "T" (as making the cross but leaving one edge out)

Step 2: Make a 2x2x3 block (insert the first c/e pair to form a 2x2x2 
then the second pair to finnish the 2x2x3)

Step 3: Oreintate all edges (exactly as Step 3 in the Petrus method)

Step 4: Finnish F2L (using Petrus or Fridirch)

I have played around a bit with this and think it works quite well for 
me. I have been using Petrus method until now and I really like having 
the edges orientated when I finnish F2L so thats why I do step 3.

I¬¥d really like to hear your opinions on this as a speedsolving method 
or even better your own experiences if you have used it already. All 
suggestions to improve it is more than welcome.

Just an idea that I wanted to share,
Mikael

    ooohhhhhh, ok, my bad
but yeah, in my personal opinion, i think the one i made is probably
easier.  all it requires is taking out two corners and an edge from
each cube, and gluing the two cubes together in the right place.  I
still haven't made any other mods, but I really want to, just have to
get to it.

and also, i would recomend looking at ton's puzzle buidling page, the
one he gave a link to, lots of cool mods, and instructions for them i

    I, too, would be quite interested. But I would also need a visual 
representation of the quality.

I still don't understand why they don't just print the color into 
the plastic?

&gt; What it is looking like right now is that I will give you my 
address
&gt; and you can mail me the amount and I will mail you back the

&gt; For 1-4 set, you will need to include a stamp in the envelope to 
cover

[snip] 
&gt; 3. David J asked if I would be willing to include knowing 200, 300,
&gt; 400, 500 algorithms (and another thing like that). My answer is no. I
&gt; think that as you get farther in things get more specialized and
&gt; giving points out for each step of the way unnecessarily lowers the
&gt; score of beginners who haven't even got 50 algorithms down.

   Unneccesarily? I did it that way so that someone who knows more
algs gets more points.  So you want the freshmen to score the same as
the seniors, but without doing the work? 

   What then is the point? I thought the test was to assess skill.
Among other things this leaves the freshman with nothing to work towards.

   Oh, I get it you want everyone to score the same, no wait, there's
"world record" - boy that lowers the score of all but, a handful of
people.

&gt; I make an
&gt; exception for stuff like Blindfold solving because it's such an
&gt; important jump. I would, however, add "solved the cube myself" and
&gt; "use some of my own algorithms" (but not all or a big list).

   Why not all? You include trivia, like knowing a few abreviations,
but not important things?
 
There are two basic ways to solve the cube:
1. Figure it out yourself.
2. Memorise how someone else solved it.
   Most people are somewhere between these two, and this marks the
main difference between people's approaches. I thought that one of the
purposes of this test was to be able to see how different people are
approaching the same task.

   I, for one, would like to know of others who only use their own
algorithms.

&gt; If I did
&gt; that, people who (for example) use optimum F2L algs found by someone
&gt; else with a cube program would be cheated of lots of points.
 
   Cheated? Since when is earning a higher score cheating? 

   In some places people equate a good memory with the ability to
think. If I were you I wouldn't expect too many people to accept that.

David J

Urgh. I should have explained myself better. The thing is that the
test isn't entertaining if you have all of the steps for something.
Sure, learning the next 100 algorithms is a wonderful barrier, and
assessing skill is the meaning of the thing, but if you have so many
steps then everything else of comparable difficulty (blindfold
solving, for example, or lowering your time, or learning to do it in
fewer moves) has to have a lot of steps, and that transforms the test
into a sluggish mess rather than a fun quiz.

If you look at the Geek Test, for example, they don't have boxes for
"Have seen 20 Star Trek episodes", "Have seen 40 Star Trek episodes",
"Have seen 60 Star Trek episodes", etc. all the way down the line.
They only dwell on one thing if there's a good reason - the questions
are different enough that they are enjoyable.

Would you rather that I had "can solve it in 40 seconds", "can solve
it in 30 seconds", "can solve it in 25 seconds", "can solve it in 18
seconds", "can solve it in 17 seconds" all on the test? I sure
wouldn't. I mean sure, they're good milestones for cubers, but they're
not interesting to people who can't already do them. If you don't know
100 algorithms (or even if you do) having those separate steps is
tedious and not fun. Maybe I'll change the algorithms to "1 look LL"
or something rather than "full ZB".

My point isn't that I want everyone's score to be the same, I just
don't want people who aren't already at the highest rungs of the
ladder to get pathetically low scores all the time. If you have more
questions in the middle range of difficulty (solving a 4-by, 100 algs,
with one hand, in front of a crowd) the test is more exciting.

Also, if you want to use the test to see what someone's done and can
do, you probably won't care if they know 300 algs or 400, but you
probably will care if they know what BYO stands for or if they can do
the 5-by.

What exactly do you consider important? The difference between 200 and
300 algorithms? That may be a difficult step, but I don't think it's
interesting. If you think something is interesting other than what
you've said so far, just tell us.

&gt; There are two basic ways to solve the cube:
&gt; 1. Figure it out yourself.
&gt; 2. Memorise how someone else solved it.
&gt;    Most people are somewhere between these two, and this marks the
&gt; main difference between people's approaches. I thought that one of
&gt; the purposes of this test was to be able to see how different people
&gt; are approaching the same task.
&gt;    I, for one, would like to know of others who only use their own
&gt; algorithms.

Here's the dilemma - I see your reasoning that knowing your own
algoritms is good, but there are other factors that would prevent all
except the most reclusive cuber from getting a higher score. I don't
doubt that using some of your own algorithms is good, but at about 40%
I draw the line - on the next version I do plan to put in a box that
says "some of the algorithms I use are my own". If you go above that
40% you run the danger of not being efficient because you haven't
optimized your LL as much as others have. While it is a good
characteristic of cubers to be able to be self-independent and figure
things out for themselves, it isn't a good characteristic to not take
help and tips from others - in the form of algorithms, or in the form
of something else.

&gt; &gt; If I did that, people who (for example) use optimum F2L algs found
&gt; &gt; by someone else with a cube program would be cheated of lots of
&gt; &gt; points.
&gt;    Cheated? Since when is earning a higher score cheating?

I don't think you understood what I was saying there. What I was
saying was this: Suppose Person A uses a computer program or an
exhaustive search by hand to determine optimal algorithms for, say,
the Fridrich F2L, and posts them on his website. Then say Person B,
learning to speedsolve, comes across Person A's website and commits to
memory his optimal algorithms. Even if Person B made his own LL
algorithms, he would lose points (to be cheated of = to lose unfairly)
on the test and, even if he became a famous and well-known cuber, he
would virtually never be able to regain those points.

&gt;    In some places people equate a good memory with the ability to
&gt; think. If I were you I wouldn't expect too many people to accept
&gt; that.

So, I shouldn't expect people to accept that having a good memory
gives you the ability to think? I don't accept it and I'm not trying
to expect people to, so why the comment?

&gt;

Well, I have a 2-by that came from that kind of box, so I guess that's
it. Comparing it to my standard Rubik's it looks like it's the size of
2/3 of the cube plus 2 mm or so, and on my Eastsheen 5-by it's very
slightly more than 2/3 of the cube, so I'd say 40 mm or very slightly

    &gt; ooohhhhhh, ok, my bad

Yeah, I know, the ones where you take stuff out and glue the cubes
together are always easier. I tend not to like them because I don't

    It seems from the picture that orange is extremely difficult to

    Sorry about another message, but looking back on the pictures, the
green also looks messed up. It is darker in person. The colors are
nearly exactly the same color as the Rubiks.com stickers. Except they
are vinyl and the color dose not wear off.

Oh well, at least you have an excuse. My name is Michael, and I must have had at least ten people spell it "Micheal." What's up with that? It's one of the five most common names over here!

    I know we tried the WCC (World Cube Cup)

What about a NCC in the States?  Regional qualifiers are established 
in different regions, and complete teams would compete with each 
other in a national even.  At this time the idea may be horribly 
ambitious, but I feel it's something we should look forward to.

Of course this idea of regional qualifiers and national tournaments, 
is great for any country.

    Having been inspired from the pictures on Stefan's site, I have 
collected the materials and set aside this evening (my wife does not 
yet know) to replicating his Super 5X5. I've used the algorithms on 
Jaap's site for solving the centers on the Rubik World and wonder if 
I'd be going in the right direction by using this for the other 
centers on the 5X5, just adjusting the algs slightly. I worry that 
I'll be spending hours to create something I can't solve for the 
next week or longer.

    I felt like that when I was learning Petrus.  It worked well, and I 
got into the low 20s.  It's those last seconds that are the hardest.  
I've gone to the gilles roux method, and i've been working on it.  I 
got a new PB last night, 24.97 average, and 16.47 Single solve, non-
lucky.  On the other hand though, i feel that when I can see ahead, I 
easily get sub-20 solves. if you work hard enough at it, you'll get 
to be sub-20.  At this point, it's a mental block.

Nice, pictures please :-)

If you can solve the 4x4 or the 5x5 you shouldn't have trouble solving 
the super 5x5. It's not really much harder (for blindsolving it's 
actually easier for me than normal 5x5), it's mainly just more work. 
But man, try to figure it out yourself first ;-)

Cheers!

P.S. If you have too much time, consider swapping pieces of all 25 
stickers on each side, not only the middle 9. Technically it doesn't 
matter but I could imagine it looks even better cause it seems more 
consistent...

I find that it's easy to solve the 3-by with centers oriented using just
one algorithm (although it takes a bit longer to solve because there's
aligning involved in the F2L) which rotates the top center 180 degrees.
If I was doing the 5-by supercube, I'd be more careful when aligning the
centers in the center-matching step, and then I'd just solve like the
center-orientation 3-by.

&gt; P.S. If you have too much time, consider swapping pieces of all 25 
&gt; stickers on each side, not only the middle 9. Technically it doesn't 
&gt; matter but I could imagine it looks even better cause it seems more 
&gt; consistent...

Actually, if I made my own 5-by supercube (which I might do if my East
Sheen's stickers wear off) I would do this. Not only does it look better
(which is usually a plus) but it is easier to tell when centers are
rotated.

Hmm... actually, it might help to do this on the edges and corners of a
3-by - it would probably make it easier to do stuff like PLL.

I like websites where you can see a person :-) Suggestion: Describe 
the videos a bit instead of just saying "Video 3".

Also, you need to learn how to write "Orientation" ;-) Some place you 
have "Orination" which reminds me of...

    Hey!

U can use the algorithms for 3x3x3 supercube on the fixed centers on 
the 5x5x5 also of course :-) For the outer centers u have 2 kinds:

Those btw the fixed center and the middle edges (+ centers)

Those btw the fixed center and the corners (x centers)

And of coz those 2 centergroups are kinda independent. A + center 
can never go into the slot of an x center (and vice versa). However 
some slice moves do change both types of centers.

The way to solve these centers will be to permute them. If u are 
lucky u can solve the 4 centers on a face (x centers or + centers) 
independently of the other faces (a 3-cycle or 2 2-cycles, which u 
simulate by 2 3-cycles actually). Or in some cases u will need to 
interoperate with centers on another face also, say if u have a 2-
cycle (swap) on one face and same on another face. Then u perform 2 
3-cycles involving those 2 faces. Im not gonna tell u how u do that.

All this of coz if u do the centers as the last step. There are 
faster ways if u do the centers first.

Best of luck with 5x5x5 supersolving :-)

   No. That first try was unsatifactory, that is, they couldn't get
orange, so it was not pursued. There have been other attempts.

I think that this silk screening went well:

http://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=1305


&gt; I can't help but be skeptical at the theory of it not being 
&gt; feasible. 

   It was tried recently, but I think that again they didn't like the
resulting "palette:"

&gt; Plastic gets colored successfully all the time; just walk

   I wish they'd put out an assembly cube using white plastic. They do
make white plastic cubes, but only for corporations...and that's a
shame since the white plastic is slicker than the black.

   Here are two examples from other companies, of painting on the
cubes; one of them is white:

Well, for one thing, being able to change the color scheme is good,
seeing that some cubers like me use the original "official" color
scheme, and are put off by the new standard. 

They do put out more colors than just the standard colors, but I wish
the present day stickers were as good as on the 1980 era Ideal cubes.

They could also make tiles, but that's another story...

    There are two ways to go with coloured plastic.

You can buy white or some light coloured plastic and paint
it or you can add pigment to plastic pellets then mold it
or extrude it.

But if you look at multi-coloured plastic puzzles you will
probably see that there are seams where the different 
colours fit together. Now try to apply that to the Rubik's
Cube pieces and you can see why it's easier to use 
tiles. 

Now the big question in my mind is "What happened to the
tooling for the deluxe Rubik's Cube"? The engineer who 
worked on it is no longer with us. Believe or not it's even
possible that tooling was _destroyed_. 

Nevertheless, I believe we will see an ersatz deluxe in
the near future. But to recreate the original deluxe with
the recessed tiles and tapered tiles is going to take 
major $$$. Given the effort necessary to make the deluxe
in the first place I'm kind of surprised Ideal Toy didn't
make more of them.

&gt; Hey all, 
&gt;      22.95s - not too exciting if you're a fast guy but I was 
&gt; stoked.  First average under 23s (even if just barely).  It's 
&gt; frustrating to have an average in the low 20's and still hardly 
ever 
&gt; get sub 20 solves.  I've rededicated myself to learning the rest of 
&gt; the OLL's, when I can find time in between classes.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, thought I'd share.

    Thank you. I've only completed making three sides so far, it's 
taking much longer than I thought to make and I took Stefan's 
suggestion of bordering the edges and corners.  I couldn't wait last 
night to start solving though, even with three sides suped up.

&gt; Hey!
&gt; 
&gt; U can use the algorithms for 3x3x3 supercube on the fixed centers 
on 
&gt; the 5x5x5 also of course :-) For the outer centers u have 2 kinds:
&gt; 
&gt; Those btw the fixed center and the middle edges (+ centers)
&gt; 
&gt; Those btw the fixed center and the corners (x centers)
&gt; 
&gt; And of coz those 2 centergroups are kinda independent. A + center 
&gt; can never go into the slot of an x center (and vice versa). 
However 
&gt; some slice moves do change both types of centers.
&gt; 
&gt; The way to solve these centers will be to permute them. If u are 
&gt; lucky u can solve the 4 centers on a face (x centers or + centers) 
&gt; independently of the other faces (a 3-cycle or 2 2-cycles, which u 
&gt; simulate by 2 3-cycles actually). Or in some cases u will need to 
&gt; interoperate with centers on another face also, say if u have a 2-
&gt; cycle (swap) on one face and same on another face. Then u perform 
2 
&gt; 3-cycles involving those 2 faces. Im not gonna tell u how u do 
that.
&gt; 
&gt; All this of coz if u do the centers as the last step. There are 
&gt; faster ways if u do the centers first.
&gt; 
&gt; Best of luck with 5x5x5 supersolving :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I, too, would be quite interested. But I would also need a 
&gt; &gt; visual 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; representation of the quality.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I still don't understand why they don't just print the color 
&gt; &gt; into 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the plastic?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -DWC
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's been done a few times. The first time was this cube:
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=590
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; DJ
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That is quite interesting, thank you for providing me with that 
bit 
&gt; &gt; of information.  Does this mean that no attempt to print the 
color 
&gt; &gt; into the plastic, according to standard colors, has been 
successful?
&gt; 
&gt;    No. That first try was unsatifactory, that is, they couldn't get
&gt; orange, so it was not pursued. There have been other attempts.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that this silk screening went well:
&gt; 
&gt; http://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=1305
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I can't help but be skeptical at the theory of it not being 
&gt; &gt; feasible. 
&gt; 
&gt;    It was tried recently, but I think that again they didn't like 
the
&gt; resulting "palette:"
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2027%20SevenTowns%
20prototype%20fused%20stickers.htm
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Plastic gets colored successfully all the time; just walk 
&gt; &gt; down any isle at Toys R Us.  What if instead of black plastic, 
they 
&gt; &gt; used white?
&gt; 
&gt;    I wish they'd put out an assembly cube using white plastic. 
They do
&gt; make white plastic cubes, but only for corporations...and that's a
&gt; shame since the white plastic is slicker than the black.
&gt; 
&gt;    Here are two examples from other companies, of painting on the
&gt; cubes; one of them is white:
&gt; 
&gt; http://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=792
&gt; 
&gt; http://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=845
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; Not that anyone here has a say in this, I am just curious as to 
the 
&gt; &gt; limitations and possible reasons for never implementing what 
would 
&gt; &gt; seem to be an obvious solution to the sticker problem.  Or is it 
&gt; &gt; simply that Rubik's wants people to keep buying new stickers 
from 
&gt; &gt; them?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, for one thing, being able to change the color scheme is good,
&gt; seeing that some cubers like me use the original "official" color
&gt; scheme, and are put off by the new standard. 
&gt; 
&gt; They do put out more colors than just the standard colors, but I 
wish
&gt; the present day stickers were as good as on the 1980 era Ideal 
cubes.
&gt; 
&gt; They could also make tiles, but that's another story...

First off, let me thank you for being so informative, and receptive 
to my questions.  I am new here, and you have made me feel quite 
welcome. 

The silk screening looks nice. Of course, I would require it to be 
an actual color (yes, I am stating the obvious).  I like the idea of 
the plastic tiles.  Does this add additional weight to the cube?  
The white cube looks nice, though I can see it shows the grime on 
the cube a lot more. It would mean you would have to keep it a lot 
cleaner.  But I suppose that is a good thing.

I completely understand the concept of needing a different color 
scheme. But that could easily be solved by manufacturing two color 
schemes, and the user buys their own preference.  Out of curiosity, 
what was the original official color scheme? Today, I am assuming, 
it is White -&gt; Yellow, Blue -&gt; Green, and Red -&gt; Orange.

While we are on the conversation of making the cube better, why not 
make the entire cubie smooth, like their faces, instead of the clip-
in piece of plastic on the corners? Is there an obvious reason for 
having this that I am overlooking?

Mark, forgive me for my ignorance, but could you expand more on your 
message? Of what exactly does "an ersatz deluxe" cube
consist, and 
how were they tooling the deluxe cube before?

    Just a quick question about alg1 'T' in the PLL of Fridrich Method. 

Why is the first move an U3 and not U' ??

Noticed that there are other U3 references such as alg3 in 'Y' and alg2 in 'F'.
There must be some sort of hidden advantage to performing U3.

    That's really quite impressive.  I've been at it for like 3-4 years

    As it stands I have all of the OLL algorithms for when the edges are 
all oriented correctly or all flipped wrongly.  Maybe two or three 
others.  So I still have quite a ways to go before I have the OLL 
memorized.

Any tips on what sequence to memorize them in?

    Hello All,

I am a silkscreen printer, and while I have yet to try printing 
directly on a cube, I do print on lots of different kinds of plactic 
regularly.  I can tell you that the process for screening the cubes 
colors would be intensive.  To do it right all the colors would need 
to be backed up with white first to avoid the colors being washed 
out by the black behind them.  Also, any type of screen printing 
will scratch if handled roughly.  

In the past few weeks I have been working on a couple of ideas for 
the cube stickers.  I have made viynl labels which look very good 
and don't wear off, but my latest idea is closer to "tiles".  I have 
sub-surface printed some thin clear lexan, backed it up with white 
and then applied addhesive to the backside.  The results are a 
plastic "tile" witch can't be scratched.  The adhesive I've used is 
an aircraft grade glue which sticks great without leaving behind a 
residue when removed, and seems to not be bothered by the spraying 
of silicone lube.  I am just finishing up the first trial run of 
these tiles, and have made them in 2 different thicknesses.  

I will try and get these all done and applied to some cubes to post 
some pictures by this weekend.  I will also be sending out a couple 
of sample sets to people who will hopefully post some feedback.  

Thanks
Chris L

&gt; &gt; Hi wet dog.&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I, too, would be quite interested. But I would also need a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; visual 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; representation of the quality.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I still don't understand why they don't just print the 
color 
&gt; &gt; &gt; into 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the plastic?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -DWC
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's been done a few times. The first time was this cube:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=590
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DJ
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is quite interesting, thank you for providing me with 
that 
&gt; bit 
&gt; &gt; &gt; of information.  Does this mean that no attempt to print the 
&gt; color 
&gt; &gt; &gt; into the plastic, according to standard colors, has been 
&gt; successful?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    No. That first try was unsatifactory, that is, they couldn't 
get
&gt; &gt; orange, so it was not pursued. There have been other attempts.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think that this silk screening went well:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; http://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=1305
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I can't help but be skeptical at the theory of it not being 
&gt; &gt; &gt; feasible. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    It was tried recently, but I think that again they didn't 
like 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; resulting "palette:"
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; http://www.speedcubing.com/ton/pages/Rubik%27s%2027%20SevenTowns%
&gt; 20prototype%20fused%20stickers.htm
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Plastic gets colored successfully all the time; just walk 
&gt; &gt; &gt; down any isle at Toys R Us.  What if instead of black plastic, 
&gt; they 
&gt; &gt; &gt; used white?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    I wish they'd put out an assembly cube using white plastic. 
&gt; They do
&gt; &gt; make white plastic cubes, but only for corporations...and that's 
a
&gt; &gt; shame since the white plastic is slicker than the black.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    Here are two examples from other companies, of painting on the
&gt; &gt; cubes; one of them is white:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; http://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=792
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; http://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=845
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not that anyone here has a say in this, I am just curious as 
to 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; limitations and possible reasons for never implementing what 
&gt; would 
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be an obvious solution to the sticker problem.  Or is 
it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; simply that Rubik's wants people to keep buying new stickers 
&gt; from 
&gt; &gt; &gt; them?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, for one thing, being able to change the color scheme is 
good,
&gt; &gt; seeing that some cubers like me use the original "official" color
&gt; &gt; scheme, and are put off by the new standard. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; They do put out more colors than just the standard colors, but I 
&gt; wish
&gt; &gt; the present day stickers were as good as on the 1980 era Ideal 
&gt; cubes.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; They could also make tiles, but that's another story...

&gt; 
&gt; First off, let me thank you for being so informative, and 
receptive 
&gt; to my questions.  I am new here, and you have made me feel quite 
&gt; welcome. 
&gt; 
&gt; The silk screening looks nice. Of course, I would require it to be 
&gt; an actual color (yes, I am stating the obvious).  I like the idea 
of 
&gt; the plastic tiles.  Does this add additional weight to the cube?  
&gt; The white cube looks nice, though I can see it shows the grime on 
&gt; the cube a lot more. It would mean you would have to keep it a lot 
&gt; cleaner.  But I suppose that is a good thing.
&gt; 
&gt; I completely understand the concept of needing a different color 
&gt; scheme. But that could easily be solved by manufacturing two color 
&gt; schemes, and the user buys their own preference.  Out of 
curiosity, 
&gt; what was the original official color scheme? Today, I am assuming, 
&gt; it is White -&gt; Yellow, Blue -&gt; Green, and Red -&gt; Orange.
&gt; 
&gt; While we are on the conversation of making the cube better, why 
not 
&gt; make the entire cubie smooth, like their faces, instead of the 
clip-
&gt; in piece of plastic on the corners? Is there an obvious reason for 
&gt; having this that I am overlooking?
&gt; 
&gt; Mark, forgive me for my ignorance, but could you expand more on 
your 
&gt; message? Of what exactly does "an ersatz deluxe" cube
&gt; consist, and 
&gt; how were they tooling the deluxe cube before?

It would have been good to know that it was in the last 5 mins of the

    Hey!

If u bought from Mefferts then u are lucky to have screws inside the 
middle centers (fixing them to the core/spindle inside). U might be 
lucky to get one of the centercaps off using a sharp knife to break 
the gluing. If u do then u can loosen up the screw which would make 
disassembling a few pieces much easier.

But actually i recommend to struggle with it for a few weeks 
to "break it in" a little before lubing with silicone spray. One 
brand which is good and hopefully worldwide available is the CRC 
silicone spray. It comes in a 200 ml can with a handy small tube for 
accurate spraying. When the cube is relatively new u can spray a 
little every few weeks. Use a soft cloth to wipe off silicone from 
outside of the cube. Those very thin synthetic fibre kitchen cloths 
will do nicely.

Other than lubing, since u have a mefferts cube, u can play around 
with adjusting all those screws. U might find that u have to use a 
little superglue on the tip of the screws to make them stay put 
where u want. How loose/tight u want ur cube is a personal matter 
only. But too loose and u will have trouble with some of the centers 
rotating and locking the cube.

Happy 5x5x5-ing ;-)

    I solve my edges first and my centers last, so I don't have this, 
but couldn't you fix this in the same manner you fix the 4X4 edge 
parity? You would use all the same moves and disregard the middle 
slices, but maybe my way for the 4X4 is different from yours, too. 
Good luck.

First we should ask what type of cube it is ;-) If it's an Eastsheen 
then it's way easier and I'd suggest a small screwdriver instead of a 
sharp knife to pop off a centercap (since there are nice holes around 
it).

&gt; U might find that u have to use a 
&gt; little superglue on the tip of the screws to make them stay put

You could also use the hammer-method or make a few scratches or put a 
square piece of paper between cap and piece. Oh, and never ever play 
above a floor with holes :-(

    Hi DWC,

   Do tiles add weight to the cube? Depends on how they are done and
the plastic used. I think they could be done like the center caps on a
regular cube and weigh no more.

   The clip in piece is thre because they use a very thin plastic - if
it wasn't there it would catch and the cube would lock up too much.
The Deluxe cubes used a lighter plastic and so the sides could be
thicker - more than twice as thick as the regular cubes - so there was
no need for a clip in piece. 

   The original color scheme was Blue Opposite White, Red opposite
Orange, Green opposite Yellow with one corner RBG.

Cheers,

David J

&gt; First off, let me thank you for being so informative, and receptive 
&gt; to my questions.  I am new here, and you have made me feel quite 
&gt; welcome. 
&gt; 
&gt; The silk screening looks nice. Of course, I would require it to be 
&gt; an actual color (yes, I am stating the obvious).  I like the idea of 
&gt; the plastic tiles.  Does this add additional weight to the cube?  
&gt; The white cube looks nice, though I can see it shows the grime on 
&gt; the cube a lot more. It would mean you would have to keep it a lot 
&gt; cleaner.  But I suppose that is a good thing.
&gt; 
&gt; I completely understand the concept of needing a different color 
&gt; scheme. But that could easily be solved by manufacturing two color 
&gt; schemes, and the user buys their own preference.  Out of curiosity, 
&gt; what was the original official color scheme? Today, I am assuming, 
&gt; it is White -&gt; Yellow, Blue -&gt; Green, and Red -&gt; Orange.
&gt; 
&gt; While we are on the conversation of making the cube better, why not 
&gt; make the entire cubie smooth, like their faces, instead of the clip-
&gt; in piece of plastic on the corners? Is there an obvious reason for 
&gt; having this that I am overlooking?
&gt; 
&gt; Mark, forgive me for my ignorance, but could you expand more on your 
&gt; message? Of what exactly does "an ersatz deluxe" cube
&gt; consist, and 
&gt; how were they tooling the deluxe cube before?

    5x5x5 cubes are easy to dissasemble. NOTE: Try this, but your cube 
may be different. Also, my directions for putting it back together 
probably will not make any sence, but try them.
You are going to pop 18 pieces out all at the same time. Turn tow 
layers 1/2 turn so that the edge piece is centered above the corner. 
Put your thumb under the edge and the piece below it and pull gently 
up. If your cube is like mine, your cube will litteraly fall apart. 
&gt;From there, i think you are capable of taking it apart. 

To put it back together, it is a little more difficult. I hope to 
have a rough website up by sunday describing the process.Here is what 
it is going to basicly tell you: Put the bottom layer together, put 
the bottom three layers together, put the four corners in place on 
the top layer, put the main edge pieces in place, finish a 2X3X5 
block on the top layer, solve the left 2x2x2 block with out the X 
piece, solve the right 2x2x2 block without the X piece, put in the 
three pieces and put it in place. Keep an eye on my website. It 
should be ready by saturday night, but things can change:
www.geocities.com/pjgat09/
it is on the "miscellaneous" page.

&gt; &gt;    Unneccesarily? I did it that way so that someone who knows more
&gt; &gt; algs gets more points.  So you want the freshmen to score the same
&gt; &gt; as the seniors, but without doing the work? 
&gt; &gt;    What then is the point? I thought the test was to assess skill.
&gt; &gt; Among other things this leaves the freshman with nothing to work
&gt; &gt; towards.
&gt; &gt;    Oh, I get it you want everyone to score the same, no wait,
&gt; &gt; there's "world record" - boy that lowers the score of all but, a
&gt; &gt; handful of people.
&gt; &gt;    Why not all? You include trivia, like knowing a few abreviations,
&gt; &gt; but not important things?
&gt; 
&gt; Urgh. I should have explained myself better. The thing is that the
&gt; test isn't entertaining if you have all of the steps for something.
&gt; Sure, learning the next 100 algorithms is a wonderful barrier, and
&gt; assessing skill is the meaning of the thing, but if you have so many
&gt; steps then everything else of comparable difficulty (blindfold
&gt; solving, for example, or lowering your time, or learning to do it in
&gt; fewer moves) has to have a lot of steps, and that transforms the test
&gt; into a sluggish mess rather than a fun quiz.

   I thought the test might be interesting if I could see in detail
how someone is progressing. 
 
&gt; If you look at the Geek Test, for example, they don't have boxes for
&gt; "Have seen 20 Star Trek episodes", "Have seen 40 Star Trek episodes",
&gt; "Have seen 60 Star Trek episodes", etc. all the way down the line.
&gt; They only dwell on one thing if there's a good reason - the questions
&gt; are different enough that they are enjoyable.

   You put multiple check boxes by Erno Rubik as a progression. I
thought you could do the same elsewhere.
 
&gt; Would you rather that I had "can solve it in 40 seconds", "can solve
&gt; it in 30 seconds", "can solve it in 25 seconds", "can solve it in 18
&gt; seconds", "can solve it in 17 seconds" all on the test? I sure
&gt; wouldn't. I mean sure, they're good milestones for cubers, but they're
&gt; not interesting to people who can't already do them. If you don't know
&gt; 100 algorithms (or even if you do) having those separate steps is
&gt; tedious and not fun. Maybe I'll change the algorithms to "1 look LL"
&gt; or something rather than "full ZB".
&gt; 
&gt; My point isn't that I want everyone's score to be the same, I just
&gt; don't want people who aren't already at the highest rungs of the
&gt; ladder to get pathetically low scores all the time. If you have more
&gt; questions in the middle range of difficulty (solving a 4-by, 100 algs,
&gt; with one hand, in front of a crowd) the test is more exciting.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, if you want to use the test to see what someone's done and can
&gt; do, you probably won't care if they know 300 algs or 400, but you
&gt; probably will care if they know what BYO stands for or if they can do
&gt; the 5-by.
 
&gt; What exactly do you consider important? The difference between 200 and
&gt; 300 algorithms? That may be a difficult step, but I don't think it's
&gt; interesting. If you think something is interesting other than what
&gt; you've said so far, just tell us.

   Well for one thing, the questions that I might ask someone who has
developed over a hundred of their own algorithms would be different
from questions I might ask someone who only knows what others have done.
 
&gt; &gt; There are two basic ways to solve the cube:
&gt; &gt; 1. Figure it out yourself.
&gt; &gt; 2. Memorise how someone else solved it.
&gt; &gt;    Most people are somewhere between these two, and this marks the
&gt; &gt; main difference between people's approaches. I thought that one of
&gt; &gt; the purposes of this test was to be able to see how different people
&gt; &gt; are approaching the same task.
&gt; &gt;    I, for one, would like to know of others who only use their own
&gt; &gt; algorithms.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the dilemma - I see your reasoning that knowing your own
&gt; algoritms is good, but there are other factors that would prevent all
&gt; except the most reclusive cuber from getting a higher score. I don't
&gt; doubt that using some of your own algorithms is good, but at about 40%
&gt; I draw the line - on the next version I do plan to put in a box that
&gt; says "some of the algorithms I use are my own". If you go above that
&gt; 40% you run the danger of not being efficient because you haven't
&gt; optimized your LL as much as others have. 

   While I am willing to look at this being true for you, where did
you get the idea that this is true for others?

&gt; While it is a good
&gt; characteristic of cubers to be able to be self-independent and figure
&gt; things out for themselves, it isn't a good characteristic to not take
&gt; help and tips from others - in the form of algorithms, or in the form
&gt; of something else.

   If you are working on the same project I agree that it is good to
be open to others - which is part of why I'm looking for people who
approach the cube the way I do. 
 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If I did that, people who (for example) use optimum F2L algs found
&gt; &gt; &gt; by someone else with a cube program would be cheated of lots of
&gt; &gt; &gt; points.
&gt; &gt;    Cheated? Since when is earning a higher score cheating?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think you understood what I was saying there. What I was
&gt; saying was this: Suppose Person A uses a computer program or an
&gt; exhaustive search by hand to determine optimal algorithms for, say,
&gt; the Fridrich F2L, and posts them on his website. Then say Person B,
&gt; learning to speedsolve, comes across Person A's website and commits to
&gt; memory his optimal algorithms. Even if Person B made his own LL
&gt; algorithms, he would lose points (to be cheated of = to lose unfairly)
&gt; on the test and, even if he became a famous and well-known cuber, he
&gt; would virtually never be able to regain those points.

   Not at all. Following my suggestions that person would get credit
for whatever algs he or she developed, and besides it sounds like that
person was cheating him or herself.

   There is nothing unfair in my suggestions.

   I really don't care whether you include my suggestions or not. I
tacked on what I would be interested in, if it doesn't interest you,
that's fine.

    Hi Chris,

I had my friend Mark Sullivan try your stickers and he brought the cube 
by today.  The stickers are excellent.  We used the brighter orange 
color with the slightly different texture and it really sticks out from 
the red a lot.  The green is also lighter than the traditional green 
and looks a bit like Lars Petrus' green.  I've been cubing my whole 
life with rubiks.com stickers so I wasn't used to it at first but I'm 
sure that about after a day of cubing, I would be easily adjusted to 
the slightly different colors.  The stickers are very bright and it's 
very easy and perhaps even more distinctive to tell the colors apart.  
Also, they stick well, don't leave a residue, and provide for a good 
feel of the cube.  It'll be awhile before we see how the stickers wear 
down though but I suspect they are quite durable and definitely more 
durable than the rubiks.com stickers.

Let me know if you'd be interested in selling them at our tournament.  
I'll take a picture... oh wait, no, I lost my digital camera.  Anyway, 
I'll try to get a picture up but the stickers look really good.  Thanks 
for the sample!

&gt;
&gt; I made another type of sticker that I am sending to you tomorrow.  It 
&gt; is a plastic overlay with the colors subsurface printed.  I think they 
&gt; came out really nice.  It is like a thin tile.  The adhesive on them

    I solve the 5-by centers-first as well. The basic reason this parity error happens is because one of the semi-middle layers (like u or r) is rotated 90 degrees. I use this alg: u (R2 u' R2 u) (F2 u' F2 u) (L2 u' L2 u), which isn't very efficient (it mixes up some edges) but it works, sort of. There are way more efficient ones, but I seriously doubt you'll find one that's easier to remember.

    &gt;    I thought the test might be interesting if I could see in detail
  &gt; how someone is progressing.

  I see your point. You can always make a separate test with lots of levels
  if you want, but as for me, I'm not going to change unless some other
  people ask (so I know that's what everyone wants). It's a big change.

  &gt;    You put multiple check boxes by Erno Rubik as a progression. I
  &gt; thought you could do the same elsewhere.

  Actually, that was because knowing Erno Rubik and knowing about Erno
  Rubik are sort of semi-important things in cubing (if I like juggling -
  which I do - I want to know about its history) and I feel that it should
  be worth a lot of points. Like bonus. I don't expect anyone to ever get
  100%.

  &gt;    Well for one thing, the questions that I might ask someone who has
  &gt; developed over a hundred of their own algorithms would be different
  &gt; from questions I might ask someone who only knows what others have done.
Yeah, that's true. It would probably be a good idea to have "I have
developed x of my own algorithms" and "I regularly use my own algorithms"
on there. 

&gt;    While I am willing to look at this being true for you, where did
&gt; you get the idea that this is true for others?

Just the idea that there are only so many algorithms to be created. I
suppose you're right.

&gt;    Not at all. Following my suggestions that person would get credit
&gt; for whatever algs he or she developed, and besides it sounds like that
&gt; person was cheating him or herself.

My point was just that you can't get near the "100% of my own algorithms"
thing if you have learned a lot of someone else's algorithms.


&gt;    I really don't care whether you include my suggestions or not. I
&gt; tacked on what I would be interested in, if it doesn't interest you,
&gt; that's fine.

It's not really that it doesn't interest me, I'm just not sure how it
would work out in the test.

&gt; &gt; lucky to get one of the centercaps off using a sharp knife to 
break

&gt; 
&gt; First we should ask what type of cube it is ;-) 

Hmmm. He stated that he bought from Mefferts. Mefferts sell the 
original Professor cube and the spinoff Eastsheen 5x5x5, which some 
prefer (but that's a different discussion). I have never heard of 
anyone getting sore hands from Eastsheens ;-) So it gotta be the 
original Professor cube design. And those do have screws for the 
middle centers. And so do indeed the Eastsheens also in fact :D Like 
i have stated before a petroleum-based silicone works fine on cubes 
that are not eastsheen. Eastsheens seem more fuzzy bout the 
silicone, most likely cause it's a different kind of plastic used in 
molding the cubies.

If it's an Eastsheen 
&gt; then it's way easier and I'd suggest a small screwdriver instead 
of a 
&gt; sharp knife to pop off a centercap (since there are nice holes 
around 
&gt; it).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; U might find that u have to use a 
&gt; &gt; little superglue on the tip of the screws to make them stay put 
&gt; &gt; where u want.
&gt; 
&gt; You could also use the hammer-method or make a few scratches or 
put a 
&gt; square piece of paper between cap and piece. 

Right, that works for holding in place the centercaps. I was talking 
about maing sure the screws don't "unscrew" themselves too easily :-)

Oh, and never ever play 
&gt; above a floor with holes :-(

Without lubing, my new large professor cube turns much easier than the 
Eastsheens so I'd say it might actually be easier to get sore hands 
from the Eastsheen :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; U might find that u have to use a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; little superglue on the tip of the screws to make them stay put 
&gt; &gt; &gt; where u want.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You could also use the hammer-method or make a few scratches or 
&gt; put a 
&gt; &gt; square piece of paper between cap and piece. 
&gt; 
&gt; Right, that works for holding in place the centercaps. I was talking 
&gt; about maing sure the screws don't "unscrew" themselves too easily :
-)

Right, my mistake, I misread. I've almost never had the "unscrewing" 
problem but often that of loose centercaps ;-) Well, my Megaminx had 
the unscrewing problem but that was because of way too strong/long 
springs and I fixed it by replacing the springs.

    I think true speedcubing, so Fridrich, ZBLL etc. is a mix of
no-brainer memorized algs and intuition.

Ideally you would have all 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 God's algorithms
memorized with finger tricks etc..

However since that is absolutely impossible it is better to use logic
and intuition to get the cube to a point where you *can* have all
possible positions memorized and just apply memorized algorithms as
fast as your hands can possibly move.

I agree that this isn't truly solving the puzzle via logic alone, but
that's not what speedcubing is about - it's about solving as quickly
as possible.  Someone who avergages 15 seconds who has no idea why
their sequences work is indeed a better speedcuber than someone who
uses their own algorithms, all of which they understand perfectly, but
averages 16-17 seconds.  In speedcubing only the time matters, I mean
look at how we rank ourselves in competitions.

Now in terms of gernal puzzling I would say that the 15 second
averager who doesn't understand exactly how their algorithms work is a
much worse puzzler than the person who uses their own method.

It's a question a semantics to me.  Would you rather be a good puzzler
or a good speedcuber?  Or both?  If you want to be a good puzzler
(which I imagine is how that one person who you met thinks) then yes
speedcubers as a general rule are poor puzzlers (who knows the
commutater notation/entire logic behind all their OLL and PLL algs?).
 If you want to be a good speedcuber, then memorizing lots of cases is
the way to go.

Sorry to get on my soap box but I've thought about this a lot too.

Personally I consider myself a much better speedcuber than puzzler.  I
understand the F2L pretty well, and I can figure out most any
rubik-like puzzle since I understand how commutaters work.  However I
still use lots of algorithms that I don't understand at all.

I guess I am more interested in being a speedcuber than a puzzler. 
But again that is just a personal choice.  I think there are lots of
people who are good speedcubers and good puzzlers, some that are good
puzzlers but who maybe aren't as interested in speedcubing.  It all
depends, and it's all based on semantics.

Definitely both.
In competitions, there could be a combined ranking that would mix
speedcubing and FMC results.

    Nice way in putting this down...  I thought about this and I think it's more than "just memorization"; however particular logic can lead to faster times (f2l, etc.).  I can solve it using techniques I can understand by logic but it will be over a minute...but for sub-20 i have to use fridrich oll/pll, etc.  Interesting.

Hi Brent,

   Solving Rubik's Cube can be a mindless memory-based action.
Consider Evans cube-solving robot "deep cube": the robot has nothing
approaching comprehension.
   However, this doesn't mean that all of it is a mindless
memory-based action.

   Memorization and applying what is memorized within an integrated
system involves brain activity, though in the robot's case the brain
activity is Evan's. Remember the computer didn't program itself.

   I think that comprehension beats mimicry hands down, but I also
appreciate discipline. There is the real possibility that memorisation
can lead to comprehension. This is the (understood) basis of our
schooling systems, even though there are, and have been, few signs
that many people do comprehend what they learn in schools. 

   Then there are the people who develop their own ways of solving the
cube and don't rely at all on the methods and algorithms of others.
Your friend cannot lump all solving under such a stereotypical
description as "no brain activity and it's just memorization."

   Regards,

David J

It's even worse than that. It's not just "out of stock" like the DIY 
3x3. It's not even produced anymore (if I understood the mail from 
rubiks.com correctly).

&gt; anybody 
&gt; know any alternative places to get one?

One possibility is Ebay. For example, you could've gotten one from the 
80s together with two cubes two days ago:
http://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=5171416353
Went for a quite cheap price, though. Usually it's two or three times 
that much.

Also, try flea markets. I only started visiting them last summer, and 
I found a 4x2 magic almost every week the first few weeks (well, four 
overall). Now in winter I haven't found one in quite a while, though, 
but I hope it gets better again next summer. And maybe I'll eventually 
find a Master Magic, too... Anyway, *if* you find something at a flea 
market, then you'll almost always get an awesome cheap price, because 
people have no clue what treasures they have there.

    I have never tried a new Master Magic, but the old and new 4x2 magic 
feel pretty much the same (if played with the same amount).

The big difference is the wiring, it's upside down I think. Though 
actually it should be possible to just take out all strings and put 
them in the other way, no?

I bought a couple of the DIY magics from rubiks.com a couple months 
ago before they disappeared from the site so I could make a master 
magic, but you don't even need the kits to make one. They have the 
Harry Potter and Simpsons magics for five bucks each right now.  You 
can buy two of those and take them apart and then go to the free 
downloads on rubiks.com to get the how-to video to make it,  and the 
templates for the master magic.  The template isn't the silver one,  
but black just like the original magic.  It took me a full week 
(even with the video) of trial and error until I could get it 
together right, but for only ten dollars it may be a worthwhile, 
inexpensive option.

&gt; Hi Brent,
&gt; 
&gt;    Solving Rubik's Cube can be a mindless memory-based action.
&gt; Consider Evans cube-solving robot "deep cube": the robot has nothing
&gt; approaching comprehension.
&gt;    However, this doesn't mean that all of it is a mindless
&gt; memory-based action.
&gt; 
&gt;    Memorization and applying what is memorized within an integrated
&gt; system involves brain activity, though in the robot's case the brain
&gt; activity is Evan's. Remember the computer didn't program itself.
&gt; 
&gt;    I think that comprehension beats mimicry hands down, but I also
&gt; appreciate discipline. There is the real possibility that memorisation
&gt; can lead to comprehension. This is the (understood) basis of our
&gt; schooling systems, even though there are, and have been, few signs
&gt; that many people do comprehend what they learn in schools. 
&gt; 
&gt;    Then there are the people who develop their own ways of solving the
&gt; cube and don't rely at all on the methods and algorithms of others.
&gt; Your friend cannot lump all solving under such a stereotypical
&gt; description as "no brain activity and it's just memorization."
&gt; 
&gt;    Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; David J

One other thing to point out to your friend: speedcubng, however you
go about it, develops pattern recognition.

Right, that's probably the best way (other than being lucky on the

any Magic and twistypuzzles.com has some articles, too (though I 
prefer Jaap's description). Damn, why didn't I think of this last time 
 I ordered something from rubiks.com...

    Hey everyone,

I just wanted to post a note on my experience with buying a new store
cube recently.

I've had heard a lot of good comments about the new DIY cubes from
rubiks.com, which are currently out of stock. Well, while I was
waiting for them to come back into stock I went down to Wal-mart today
and bought one of the main rubiks brand cubes that you buy in a store.
In the past these cubes have always been fairly nice and break in
pretty well.

Well this cube is absolutely terrible. My main complaints with this
cube are that:

1) The tension of the different faces is radically different. In
particular one face is about three timers looser than any of the
others and turns constantly, even when I don't mean it to. One of the
other faces is a bit tigher than the incredibly loose one but still
very loose for a brand new cube. The other 4 have decently uniform
tension, and require a nice normal turning pressure.

2) Also the cube does not feel tight/stable. Right out of the box
all 8 corners rattle very audibly when I shake the cube. This cube
has no sense of stability like you get on a studio cube.

I hope this cube is just a fluke, seeing as how I met with Chris
Brownlee a week or so ago and tried his new store bought cube and it
was fairly nice.

I know some of the people from Seven Towns are members of this board,
and I would like to ask when the DIY cubes will be available again. I
very much want to get a hold of a good cube with screws again.

Seriously though this cube is such a terrible cube that I am going to
go back to Wal-mart tomorrow and return it. There's no way I am going
to keep this thing.

Chris

    Hey Chris,

I can relate with this situation.  I bought a Rubik's
brand cube from wal-mart as well, and found out it had
a monsterous defect on the axel, which prevented any
possibility of comfortable turning.  

I did the WRONG thing though and tried fixing it
myself...After some sanding and lubing the puzzle was
still horrible.  I contacted David Jones in regards to
this problem, and provided a serial number in case the
problem could be tracked down.  Four months later I am
still waiting for further information.  

Buying a cube 'feels' like too much of a gamble for me
now, because I haven't the means to purchase many
cubes until I find one that's decent.

Have you tried pushing the rivets deeper into the cube? I admit it, 
for the past 30-60 minutes I have tried *very* hard to get a rivet 
*out*, but maybe it's a bit easier to take a hammer and push it in 
deeper (I can't try that right now since my parents are sleeping).

I should add that I completely failed. It didn't come out the tiniest

    Thanks to the cube i get more attention that usual :)

my name is all over campus.

By teaching others to cube, especially those classified as "loners" in
school, i have raised their self confidence and they feel more
belonging now.

Ahh. i feel relieved, i feel i have achieved something if i can teach
someone to cube to become a better person.


PS: dont cube and drive

Have fun!

    It seems to me that even those who have memorised lots of algorithms without
comprehension carry out at least 3 steps at each stage of solving a cube.

The first is, as someone posted earlier, pattern recognition.  This requires
an understanding of the sort of pattern to be looking for which depends on
the stage of solving (obvious examples would be searching for an F2L pair or
the difference between OLL and PPL in a 2 look LL).

The second is the call up from memory of the algorithm required for this
particular pattern.  This is the real memory element.

Third is carrying out that algorithm on the cube itself.  This is brain/hand
coordination - a complex mix of left and right brained activity I would have
thought.

As Chris pointed out in his excellent post speedcubing is different to
problem solving.  I would think that speed in the first and third steps are
extremely important for speedcubers although the third step would hardly
register on a list of skills required for general puzzle and problem solving
I suspect.

The first step is critical to most puzzles and is required regardless of how
much memorisation has taken place.

While I've been writing this I can't helping comparing it to chess.  Chess
performance relies very heavily on the first and second of these skills.
Pattern recognition cuts down enormously the amount of calculation required.
In the Kasparov era (had to get a mention in now he has announced his
retirement!) memory of concrete lines has become one of the major factors in
taking the game to new levels (supported very much by the huge databases of
games that are now available).

&gt; I think solving the cube requires thinking but it is more of a

    &gt; Hey everyone,
&gt; Someone mentioned the cube is "no brain activity and it's just 
memorization" to know how to solve the cube (his time was 4 minutes or 
so- rookie).  But do we really understand zbll and oll/pll?  f2l I 
think we understand, but is it just memorization, or is it more?  I 
beg to differ that it is just memorization...  
&gt; bm


Before you can even think about starting to memorize algorithms you 
have to understand how the cube is built and how the cubies move 
relative to each other, that takes brain activity for sure.
I don¬¥t believe you can become really fast at F2L by only learning 
algs without understanding how they work and what they do, that too 
takes brain activity. And at some point most of F2L will be mostly 
intuitive because of this understanding. The LL might be more 
memorizing but as people have pointed out, it also takes quick pattern 
recognition and understanding commutators and conjugates makes it 
easier to understand.
And now that was only speedsolving which maybe takes less brain 
activity of the different types of solving. To be able to solve the 
cube blindfolded or with a little less than 30 moves can¬¥t be done 
without lots of brain activity.

Just my two cents,
Mikael

I've had this theory too. One of the warmup exersices i do is repeat 
RUR'U' five times ad it is solved. Another one i tried was RU. I had 
to repeat this 105 times. I think that it is possible that repeating 
the same moves over and over from a solve cube to a solved cube is 
possible. BTW, if your hands are becoming tired of performing those 
moves above, use the proffesor cube applet.

    It is 80 repetitions of R'Lf on a 5x5x5 till the cube solves again, 
or 240 moves total.

1) corners and inner edges: each group on the L and R faces are in a 
4 cycle and thus solve every four repetitions

2) edge orbit :  These are in a complete 16 cycle and thus solve 
every 16 repetitions.

3) + centers: These are in a complete 10 cycle, and thus solve every 
10 repetitions.

4) x centers: 8 of the pieces are in an 8 cycle and the other 4 are 
in a 4 cycle.  So these solve every 8 repetitions.

LCM(4,16,10,8)=80

and 80*3=240 moves total.

The new Master's Magic wiring is in fact "upside-down." I personally 
don't like this. Stefan Pochmann's method is very hard to do with 
the newer Magic because you need to flip the dang thing after the 
first two steps, then you have to flip it back! I use a newer Magic, 
and my own method, but I know Stefan's method is much faster. Sub-5s 
is much easier with Stefan's method (I can proudly say I did a sub-
5..like 2 times :( )

If you're looking for a Master's Magic on eBay, if possible, try to 
get one of the older ones. They really are better for speed-Magic-

Probably a better explanation would be to move the middle three layers

I made a program to do it, and it turns out it's what I had thought

8 reps fix the edges
8*5 reps fix the center corners
8*5*7 reps fix the right center
8*5*11 reps fix the left center
8*5*7*11 reps fix all centers.

    Oh yeah, and I just tried out R'Lf.

After 20, you get a pretty regular pattern that seems to take 6 moves
to finish, but actually doing it that total of 120 times (I did) gives
three corners a twist, so you have to do it a total of 360 times. I
don't know what you did with your math, but, especially with 5-bys, it
seems to be really difficult if not impossible to accurately do
something like this.

I'm going to spiff up my program so you can put in a set of

    Sorry, I misread your explanation of the alg and thought it was just
R'Lf.  I just looked at R'Lfx which is the move you gave where you
also twist the cube at the end.  If you do this four times, the cube
comes back to the same original orientation.  Also it solves all the
corners and edges and just moves around 10 of those 3x1 rows of centers.

If you look at the centers specifically (doing the move on a supercube
makes it easier to see which row goes where) then you see that they
are in a 10 cycle.

So you have to do four times the move ten times.  So I agree with your
original answer that 40 repetitions of R'Lfx solves the cube again.

Of course 3080 is divisible by 40, so I agree that the cube solves in
3080 repetitions as well, but your original answer of 40 was correct,
and is the fewest number of repetitions needed to solve the cube.

    R'Lf doesn't twist the corners.  Do it four times to see that it
solves all the corners and central edges again.

I too did R'Lf on my cube and it solved in 80 repetitions, which is
exactly what the math predicted.

Doing R'Lf 120 times will mean that the corners and central edges will
be solved (both orientation and permutation) and not twisted.  This is
because 120 is divisible evenly by 4.  You can see that the f turn in
R'Lf does not affect the orientations of the corners, and the R'L
turns just cycle the corners around like just doing R'L (which solves
in 4 reps).  So this algorithm in a way doesn't affect corner
orientation at all, other than to cycle them around exactly like doing
R'L.

I don't agree that doing this kind of stuff is really difficult or
nearly impossible to do on the 5x5.  It just takes some practice, and
a supercube helps too for tracking the centers :)  Try looking at R'Lf
again.  It does indeed solve the cube again every 80 reps, there is no
error in the math, and I also tested it on my 5x5 and it worked in
practice.

Cool! I have always liked those "the incredible machine" kinda things. 
If you watch the unedited version of the video you will also notice 
that the paper in the last step (22) is pulled down by a falling cube. 
And don¬¥t miss the funny text at the end of the edited video.

Yesterday when I was watching evil woman I spoted a cube in the quite 
beginning (during the school lunch scene). I can¬¥t remember if this 
movie was listed last time this subject was discussed.

If you're not going to link to the full-size pictures then I'd suggest 
shrinking them (even Windows Paint does a quite good job at that). Not 
only will it reduce the size and thus the loading time of your page 
but it will also look better because browsers have poor on-the-fly 
shrinking capabilities.

Now about the content :-) I personally prefer to build the cube 
bottom-up, building the top layer upside-down on a large adhesive 
strip and then putting this last layer on top of the bottom four as 
one big block. This of course requires that you open and unscrew at 
least the top center piece but you'll want to do that anyway, right? 
Uh, unless you have rivets...

    Any news? Btw, I just noticed there had probably been a nice super 5x5 
before:
http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=1241
Using four colors you can have 6 different stickers (take one color as 
"reference", then you can have 3! permutations of the other three). So 
that's one sticker design for each face. Also, the 
orientation/position of a sticker on the correct face is forced. So 
this is a very nice (and probably ultimately confusing) super cube.

Cheers!

&gt; &gt; Hey!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; U can use the algorithms for 3x3x3 supercube on the fixed centers 
&gt; on 
&gt; &gt; the 5x5x5 also of course :-) For the outer centers u have 2 kinds:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Those btw the fixed center and the middle edges (+ centers)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Those btw the fixed center and the corners (x centers)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And of coz those 2 centergroups are kinda independent. A + center 
&gt; &gt; can never go into the slot of an x center (and vice versa). 
&gt; However 
&gt; &gt; some slice moves do change both types of centers.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The way to solve these centers will be to permute them. If u are 
&gt; &gt; lucky u can solve the 4 centers on a face (x centers or + centers) 
&gt; &gt; independently of the other faces (a 3-cycle or 2 2-cycles, which u 
&gt; &gt; simulate by 2 3-cycles actually). Or in some cases u will need to 
&gt; &gt; interoperate with centers on another face also, say if u have a 2-
&gt; &gt; cycle (swap) on one face and same on another face. Then u perform 
&gt; 2 
&gt; &gt; 3-cycles involving those 2 faces. Im not gonna tell u how u do 
&gt; that.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; All this of coz if u do the centers as the last step. There are 
&gt; &gt; faster ways if u do the centers first.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Best of luck with 5x5x5 supersolving :-)

    I'll post my solution to the one-handed 23.38 I did. I cube cross on 
left, so I'll try to note all the rotations I did. The cross on the 
solve was practically done except for 1 edge. Then many edges were 
correctly oriented so the F2L were a breeze. OLL was not so bad but 
he PLL was awesome. A cycle of 3 edges!

(s) it belongs to. OMG. That seems so horrible. If ever i make 
myself a super-5x5x5 (or super-4x4x4) i will never have several 
colors on a "sticker". I will simply cut small arrows on each of the 
stickers on the centers and on one edgetriplet (or -pair) on each 
face. That is just my personal preference of course ;-)

Happy super-cubing ;-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; U can use the algorithms for 3x3x3 supercube on the fixed 
centers 
&gt; &gt; on 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the 5x5x5 also of course :-) For the outer centers u have 2 
kinds:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Those btw the fixed center and the middle edges (+ centers)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Those btw the fixed center and the corners (x centers)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; And of coz those 2 centergroups are kinda independent. A + 
center 
&gt; &gt; &gt; can never go into the slot of an x center (and vice versa). 
&gt; &gt; However 
&gt; &gt; &gt; some slice moves do change both types of centers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The way to solve these centers will be to permute them. If u 
are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; lucky u can solve the 4 centers on a face (x centers or + 
centers) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; independently of the other faces (a 3-cycle or 2 2-cycles, 
which u 
&gt; &gt; &gt; simulate by 2 3-cycles actually). Or in some cases u will need 
to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; interoperate with centers on another face also, say if u have 
a 2-
&gt; &gt; &gt; cycle (swap) on one face and same on another face. Then u 
perform 
&gt; &gt; 2 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3-cycles involving those 2 faces. Im not gonna tell u how u do

Hmm ... that sounds like it might have been a possible sub-10 normal 
solve. Which is very close to lucky at least :-)

Those who want can of coz practice it since the scramble is given.

    Hey!

I accidentally did R'L'f many times over...

I found that after 12 repetitions it twists 6 corners clockwise. So 
obviously repeating 36 times and u are back to solved (same) state.

But!! Four of the centers will be rotated 180 degrees (U, R, D and 
L). So to come to supersolved (super same) state we need to repeat 
72 times.

So how many repetitions are needed to twist those same corners while 
preserving the center-orientations? Doing it forwards one will need 
repeat 12 + 36 = 48 times. But applied backwards it will be enough 
with 2 * 12 = 24 repetitions ;-) In fact doing it forward one will 
reach counterclockwise rotation of those 6 corners while preserving 
the center-orientations after 24 repetitions.

I wonder if any of this is good for blindfold solving?

As sidenote there is a very easy way to twist 3 corners in 4 
repetitions : ((R'D'RL) Fc)*4  

(Fc denotes cube rotation.)

Have fun!!

&gt; R'Lf doesn't twist the corners.  Do it four times to see that it
&gt; solves all the corners and central edges again.
&gt; 
&gt; I too did R'Lf on my cube and it solved in 80 repetitions, which is
&gt; exactly what the math predicted.
&gt; 
&gt; Doing R'Lf 120 times will mean that the corners and central edges 
will
&gt; be solved (both orientation and permutation) and not twisted.  
This is
&gt; because 120 is divisible evenly by 4.  You can see that the f turn 
in
&gt; R'Lf does not affect the orientations of the corners, and the R'L
&gt; turns just cycle the corners around like just doing R'L (which 
solves
&gt; in 4 reps).  So this algorithm in a way doesn't affect corner
&gt; orientation at all, other than to cycle them around exactly like 
doing
&gt; R'L.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't agree that doing this kind of stuff is really difficult or
&gt; nearly impossible to do on the 5x5.  It just takes some practice, 
and
&gt; a supercube helps too for tracking the centers :)  Try looking at 
R'Lf
&gt; again.  It does indeed solve the cube again every 80 reps, there 
is no
&gt; error in the math, and I also tested it on my 5x5 and it worked in
&gt; practice.

&gt; &gt; Oh yeah, and I just tried out R'Lf.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; After 20, you get a pretty regular pattern that seems to take 6 
moves
&gt; &gt; to finish, but actually doing it that total of 120 times (I did) 
gives
&gt; &gt; three corners a twist, so you have to do it a total of 360 
times. I
&gt; &gt; don't know what you did with your math, but, especially with 5-
bys, it
&gt; &gt; seems to be really difficult if not impossible to accurately do
&gt; &gt; something like this.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm going to spiff up my program so you can put in a set of
&gt; &gt; instructions and tell it how many times to do it.

&gt; &gt; Hmm .... :-0
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Solving that cube would give me long lasting headaches for sure. 
&gt; It 
&gt; &gt; looks even more evil than 6-color megaminx:-P U will have to look 
&gt; at 
&gt; &gt; the cycleic structure of each 4-colored sticker to know which layer
&gt; &gt; (s) it belongs to. OMG. That seems so horrible. If ever i make 
&gt; &gt; myself a super-5x5x5 (or super-4x4x4) i will never have several 
&gt; &gt; colors on a "sticker". I will simply cut small arrows on each of 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; stickers on the centers and on one edgetriplet (or -pair) on each 
&gt; &gt; face. That is just my personal preference of course ;-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Happy super-cubing ;-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Any news? Btw, I just noticed there had probably been a nice 
&gt; super 
&gt; &gt; 5x5 
&gt; &gt; &gt; before:
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=1241
&gt; &gt; &gt; Using four colors you can have 6 different stickers (take one 
&gt; &gt; color as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; "reference", then you can have 3! permutations of the other 
&gt; &gt; three). So 
&gt; &gt; &gt; that's one sticker design for each face. Also, the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; orientation/position of a sticker on the correct face is forced. 
&gt; &gt; So 
&gt; &gt; &gt; this is a very nice (and probably ultimately confusing) super 
&gt; cube.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; U can use the algorithms for 3x3x3 supercube on the fixed 
&gt; &gt; centers 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the 5x5x5 also of course :-) For the outer centers u have 2 
&gt; &gt; kinds:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those btw the fixed center and the middle edges (+ centers)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those btw the fixed center and the corners (x centers)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And of coz those 2 centergroups are kinda independent. A + 
&gt; &gt; center 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can never go into the slot of an x center (and vice versa). 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some slice moves do change both types of centers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The way to solve these centers will be to permute them. If u 
&gt; &gt; are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lucky u can solve the 4 centers on a face (x centers or + 
&gt; &gt; centers) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; independently of the other faces (a 3-cycle or 2 2-cycles, 
&gt; &gt; which u 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simulate by 2 3-cycles actually). Or in some cases u will 
&gt; need 
&gt; &gt; to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interoperate with centers on another face also, say if u 
&gt; have 
&gt; &gt; a 2-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cycle (swap) on one face and same on another face. Then u 
&gt; &gt; perform 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3-cycles involving those 2 faces. Im not gonna tell u how u 
&gt; do 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All this of coz if u do the centers as the last step. There 
&gt; &gt; are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; faster ways if u do the centers first.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best of luck with 5x5x5 supersolving :-)

Yes, you must hypnotize the cube.

Now seriously... what kind of 4x4 do you have? Rubik? Eastsheen? 
Eastsheen shouldn't need to be glued I think. If it's a Rubik, then 
you might want to disassemble the cube so that you can properly fix 
the piece that broke.

However, solving fast has not much to do with (not) breaking the cube. 
It's the technique that matters and elimination of breaks, which is 
even more important and harder than for 3x3. I doubt any of the top 
4x4 solvers take special care about not breaking the cube. Just twist 
nicely. And own a good cube. Preferably one that's not broken already 
;-) Or own two and fix one with pieces from the other...

Cheers!
Stefan

    Five dollars at rubiks.com will get you two corner, edge, and center

    I thought I would post the rest of what happened with my bad Wal-mart
cube.

I took back the cube I bought and exchanged it for another one.  This
time though in the store I tried out the cubes on the shelf instead of
just picking one of them up.  I was able to find one that had uniform
turning for the faces, but it is still surprisingly loose for a new cube.

I imagine as a speedcube this cube will wear out pretty quickly, but
if it does I guess I'll just try to break it in further for a
one-handed cube.

Just curious, but what happened to the manufacturing of the general
store version cubes?  When did it change and what did they do?

One suggestion I have would be to use silicone spray inside the center 
pieces as well. Since those rivets are impossible to get out, there's 
no danger. But it might make it turn a bit easier and protect the 
plastic a bit better so that it doesn't get so loose so fast. With 
screws, nowadays I take them out, sand the spring ends flat and use 
silicone spray almost everywhere. It does help a lot. I'd imagine just 
spraying helps already, too.

&gt; Just curious, but what happened to the manufacturing of the general
&gt; store version cubes?  When did it change and what did they do?

When was the last time you bought one? Did you buy an arched-center 
cube before? My impression is that the change came with the arched 
centers. When stores still had both versions I could usually tell 
whether they have arched centers just by testing the tension.

Cheers!

&gt; Now about the content :-) I personally prefer to build the cube 
&gt; bottom-up, building the top layer upside-down on a large adhesive 
&gt; strip and then putting this last layer on top of the bottom four as 
&gt; one big block. This of course requires that you open and unscrew at 
&gt; least the top center piece but you'll want to do that anyway, right? 
&gt; Uh, unless you have rivets...

Hmm, I found a disadvantage of my way. My last action (well, before 
adding the centercap) is to tighten the screw of the U center. But 
then I can't control the tension nicely anymore because the view is 
blocked by then. So next time I'll perfectly adjust the tension of all 
six centers and assemble my cube your way.

Thanks and Cheers!

Hi Dwayne,

   Most often in the very first attempts at notation, people began
using a single letter and a number to mark a turn. They labeled turns
with the colors of the sides, and 1, 2 or 3 for how much to turn. Thus
turns were labeled, for example, R1 for a clockwise turn of Red, B2
for 180 degree turn of Blue, and O3 for a counterclockwise turn of
Orange. This, of course, worked fairly well until you met up with
someone with a different color scheme.  
   Then there was a lot of variation, like T for Top or U for Upper, B
for Bottom or Back, R for Rear or Right, and it wasn't until David
Singmaster's work got around that cubists generally began using the
same letters and the single apostrophe ' for 3.

   I used the colors to start with. I wonder what other early cubists
used at first. 

Regards,

David J

    I can't speak for everyone but I can say why I used U3.
In the days of early dot matrix printers the ' symbol was
so slight it was rather hard to read so 3 was used instead.

In my earliest notes
I wrote down U- instead of U3. It was only when I started
to use the computer that I used U3 and the like.

To this day I still used a single letter suffixed by a number.
By May 1982 I was a Singmaster notation user. If you
scan through the old cube-lovers lists you can see some
alternatives, like using A B C D E F instead of Befuddler
notation. 

After I saw Minh Thai's book I started to use pictographs
as well as Befuddler. 

But with puzzles like the megaminx U3 for U- becomes
problematic. I guess pictographs are best for the megaminx
although I  never had a good algebraic system I'd be
curious to hear about one.

I do not work for Seven Towns, but I did contact Rubik's to inquire 
about the availability of the DIY cubes.  This is the response I 
received:

"The DIY 3x3 assembly kits were ordered at the beginning of 
February. The estimated time for the manufacturer to fill the order, 
travel time and clearing customs is usually 8-12 weeks."

I currently use a DIY cube, and found it to be very good.

Hope that helps.

&gt; &gt; I have a 4x4x4, but due to my attempts at speedcubing, one of the

&gt; &gt; every third time.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Are there any special ways that you can get under three minutes 
&gt; &gt; without breaking the cube?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, you must hypnotize the cube.
&gt; 
&gt; Now seriously... what kind of 4x4 do you have? Rubik? Eastsheen? 
&gt; Eastsheen shouldn't need to be glued I think. If it's a Rubik, then 
&gt; you might want to disassemble the cube so that you can properly fix 
&gt; the piece that broke.
&gt; 
&gt; However, solving fast has not much to do with (not) breaking the cube. 
&gt; It's the technique that matters and elimination of breaks, which is 
&gt; even more important and harder than for 3x3. I doubt any of the top 
&gt; 4x4 solvers take special care about not breaking the cube. Just twist 
&gt; nicely. And own a good cube. Preferably one that's not broken already 
&gt; ;-) Or own two and fix one with pieces from the other...
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers!
&gt; Stefan

Thanks Stefan,

I think I finally found something that's going to hold it together.  I
used an epoxy and let it dry overnight.  I've solved it a couple times
now and it's not loose yet.

    Just got my first 4x4x4 cube. I am using a modified 5x5x5 method. In 
this method, i solve centers, then i pair the edges, then i solve 
like a 3x3x3. But it is not that easy. I have two problems which come 
up. One is where two edges are fliped incorrectly. Another is where 
(talking in terms of a 3x3x3, meaning two edges of a 4x4x4= one edge 
of a 3x3x3) two edge pieces need to be switched which is impossible 
on the 3x3x3 so i do not know anymoves that will fix it. What algs 
can i use to fix these two problems?

    I think that might be a little extreme...

At the RWC 03' only 5 competitors advanced to the
semi-finals with a best time under 20 seconds. 

Of course everyone has improved a lot since then, but
I think the cut-off will be around 23-24 seconds to
reach the semi-finals.

    Ahh yes,  the yo-yo

I pull a few strings myself.  More than 5 years ago,  I saved for
almost 6 months and bought myslef the Pro-Yo Cold Fusion (at that
time, it held the world record for sleep time)for $150. I worked with
it and got pretty good.

I'm doing a little yo practicing right now. Over spring break, I help
my mother teach her 6th grade science students a bit about yo-yo
physics. Fun stuff.

My fav trick is Boing-y-Boing where the yo is bounced back and forth
between 2 strings. It's really neat.

    I recently switched over one of these algs to one of the ones on
Stefan Pochmann's site.  Instead of r2 U2 r2 U2 u2 r2 u2 I now do
Stefan's move:

(Uu)2 (Ll)2 U2 l2 U2 (Ll)2 (Uu)2

It is one move shorter in big cube turning metric (I don't think it
has a name yet) but it is the metric I always use for the 4x4 and 5x5.

I'm going to switch it over on my site soon, or at least include both
moves.

    It actually happened to me last week.  Granted, I did a little bit during the F2L in order to make sure I didn't wind up with all of my edges needing oriented, but it was still a heck of a lot more done than I had intended.  I was so surprised I forgot to stop the timer, though.  For shame, I know.  I've also had a incredible amount of lucky step skipping solves since Monday when I started toying around (hooray for puns!) with Gilles' method.

And for some strange reason, after I've been using Gilles' method and I solve using my layer-by-layer solution, my times are always fantastic.  I'm averaging about 33 seconds for solves that way, and about 38 or 39 for layer-by-layer solves when that's all I use.  I'm currently averaging just under 55 seconds with Gilles' method, but I'm improving quickly.  The hardest part is assembling that cursed second block.  Oh well.  I shall perservere.

    It's happened to me twice. Unfortunately I didn't time either of those solves, because I 
didn't expect it to happen! It first happened to me when I was averaging about 25 seconds

    I used to be kinda into Yo Yo's, since it could be counted as a type
of juggling, and I do like juggling. I never got tremendously good at
yoyoing, though.
not trying to threadjack here, but are any other speedcuber's jugglers
as well? or maybe unicyclists, too.... I'm both, and I know Macky is a
good juggler and Ross Palmer is a good unicyclist and decent juggler,
I think. but he doesn't post here much anymore, soo....

Here's some fun websites for yo-yo tricks . . . Many of them are
really advanced,  but look awesome.

However, to top it all off,  Sector Y has a video section with some
AMAZING videos. Definitely check them out.

    I'm not really much of a speedcuber, but I can juggle a bit (although I'm not much of a juggler either now). Still remember how to do Mill's Mess and some stuff, but I haven't done any real practicing in a year or so.

    I'm making a really basic flatcube program for an nxnxn cube - the
idea is that you have a set of predefined moves, e.g. (Ll)', which are
done by parsing the input (or maybe something else), but you can also
make a queue of moves which the program will find how many moves it
takes to solve.

Does anyone have a use for such a program?
What would you want to see in a flatcube program?

PS. I'm not at all fond of drag-drop on flatcubes, but I may implement
it if I can figure out how I'd like it to be...

Hmm... I'll need a scrambler... should I just do n^3 random moves or what?

Wow, do you play the lottery? ;)

 

This is one of my favourite cubing stories that I like to get out from time
to time.

 

The first time this happened to me was when I was in Toronto for the World
Championships of 2003. At this point I was averaging around 25-30 seconds
probably, I'm not exactly sure. I was waiting in the lobby of the hotel for
some familiar faces to come along so I could join them, and I was just
practicing solving a few cubes. In the second cube I solved of the day,
insert final F2L pair, make a U2, cube is solved! It was an incredible
feeling, probably part disbelief, and part the feeling you get when you
solve the cube for the first time. I had always wondered when it would
happen to me. If only it had happened a day later at the actual
championships, the time was around 16 seconds or so! Ah well.

 

Since 2003 it has only happened to me once more, at Christmas time last
year. The time was 11.79s, but so incredibly lucky of course!

    This has happened to me 3 times that I can remember. 
Two of those three happened in the same month.  One of
the solves was sub11!

    Back when I was using petrus, it happened to me somewhere between 4-6 
times in a session...where I got really lucky cases, and skipped 
stuff.  Of twelve solves, I had maybe 1 PLL OLL skip, and 5 PLL 
skips.  I was almost convinced that i was subconsciously fixing 
everything.  It was really weird.

That is certainly the easiest way, though you must weed out trivial 
simplifications such as LRL. This is done by insisting that if the 
next move lies on the same axis as the previous one, it must be 
closer to the Left, Back, or Down face (if not, it is rejected and a 
new random move tried instead).

If you have solved more than 3!.4!.3^3.2^3/2=15552 cubes, then you're
an unlucky guy. Something must be wrong with your date of birth or
stars positions.
Of course, statistics for people who try to do more during the F2L
stage are different. When I was using Lars' approach, I got many cubes
automagically solved. But in this case (LL edges oriented), chances
increase to 1/1944.

    &gt; What do you mean by that last part?  That you give it a scramble and 
&gt; it gives you the number of moves it takes to solve using some 
&gt; straightforward solving method?

Actually, the idea is that you give it a set of moves and it will tell
you how many times, from the solved state, you have to do that to get
back to a solved state.

&gt; That is certainly the easiest way, though you must weed out trivial 
&gt; simplifications such as LRL. This is done by insisting that if the 
&gt; next move lies on the same axis as the previous one, it must be 
&gt; closer to the Left, Back, or Down face (if not, it is rejected and a 
&gt; new random move tried instead).

What I will probably do is since I have three functions (for example,
turn_F(3,-1) would turn the 3rd face from F 1 turn ccw - in effect,
a B on a 3-by) is just not do two in a row.

Although I might have some trouble getting it to do a thousand of those
(10-by) because I can't program anything but Visual Basic, which is one
of the slowest programming languages in existance.

Are you using a 20 years old computer?!? Or are you planning to 
generate a high-resolution raytraced video?!? These are the first two 
reasons I could imagine that make you think it'll be that slow...

    I just timed it, it takes ~6 sec for 10,000 moves.

If I have 1000 moves, it will take .6 seconds, and that's quite a
noticeable lag. It might not be so bad, but if your computer is
moderately old it might get up to a few seconds, in which case it
would be quite a problem.

I don't have the stuff stored as numbers, I have it stored as colors.
Reflecting on that, I see it's a really bad decision, but I guess it
will work for now.

    Hey!

Yes i agree that Visual Basic is a poor language for algorithmic 
stuff (and most other stuff too). It shouldn't be hard for u to 
switch to programming in Delphi instead. Then u get much faster 
code, and not least real standalone executables. U won't need 
Delphi70run.dll or anything to run the code ;-)

But yes, what are u actually planning to make? A visualisation 
program, a basic solver, something similar to ACube for larger 
cubes ... ??

Anyway, good luck with it :-)

I'm not really a fan of micro$oft and haven't hear much good about VB, 
but it's not that slow. If the program is that much too slow then I 
claim it's the fault of the programmer!

I did a little test. The same code fragment in three different 
languages. Here are the results:

VB: 6.02 seconds
C++: 6.06 seconds
Java: 6.66 seconds

So think again!

Here's the code:

--------------------------------------------------------
Public Class HowEasy
	Function pointVal ( ByVal myStr As String ) As Integer
		Dim i As Integer
		Dim sum As Integer
		i = 0
		sum = 0
		While i &lt; 100000000
			sum = (sum + i) Mod 5214247
			i = i + 1
		End While
		Return sum
	End Function
End Class
--------------------------------------------------------
public class HowEasy {
	public int pointVal ( String s ) {
		int i = 0;
		int sum = 0;
		while( i &lt; 100000000 ){
			sum = (sum + i) % 5214247;
			i = i + 1;
		}
		return sum;			
	}
}
--------------------------------------------------------
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;
struct HowEasy {
	int pointVal ( string s ) {
		int i = 0;
		int sum = 0;
		while( i &lt; 100000000 ){
			sum = (sum + i) % 5214247;
			i = i + 1;
		}
		return sum;			
	}
};

    Sorry about the bad (= non-existing) indenting. Btw, the "Mod" 
operation takes a lot of time. If I do "sum = sum + 1" instead, then 
the VB program runs in 0.57 seconds. So 100 million of my loop 
iterations in about the time the cube program does 1000 cube twists. 
So 1 cube twist is 100,000 of my loop iterations. Hard to believe 
unless you have a really huge cube.

used were probably a bit different...

    Recently I came to the LL of my Megaminx and all I had to do was a 
3-cycle of corners I think. Edges were completely solved, corners were 
all oriented. Megaminx LL has (4!/2)*(3^4)*(5!/2)*(2^4)=933120 
possibilities. There are 5*4*3=60 ones with just a corner 3-cycle. So 
60/933120=1/15552 chance to get that, almost the same as complete 3x3 
LL. But if I ever get complete Megaminx LL for free...

    Well, what I'm basically doing is sending it to a function which swaps colors four at a time. What I *should* be doing is storing it as numbers, but (1) I'm lazy and (2) I'm going to be in France for two weeks and then I have school again.

The point of the program was to make a program to tell for sure how many times you have to do a certain move, although I do agree it will probably be faster if I store the whole thing as a number array.

Actually, I'm learning how to do good drawing in C++ right about now, maybe version 0.0.0.0.0.2 won't stay in VB.

    Quite literally one in a million, I think!

    Scramble with (L U L') y (L' U2 L). Now there should be a pair at FL 
that belongs into RB. Until now I would've solved this with the 
inverse of the above (i.e. with (L' U2 L y' L U' L')).

Yesterday I had the idea to rethink my 3x3 algorithms (because it has 
helped me for megaminx, too) and now I see two more ways which I might 
like better: (R' F U' F' R) and (L' U L x' U' R U [Ll]'). How do you 
solve this case?

    Hmm, maybe that's not true, since he solves edges first. But he 
explains corner permutation, so only edge permutation is missing. I'd 
have two suggestions for methods like the one for corners. Both can be 
used for 3x3 as well.

One way would be like:
(L' R F L R') U (L' R F' L R') U (L' R F L R') U2 (L' R F' L R')

The second idea (lowercase = double layer turn):
(L d L') U (L d' L') U (L d L') U2 (L d' L')

However, I believe that edges first is better for the megaminx, since 
corners are much easier to move around without destroying other 
things. Without knowing any real algorithms (just understandable 
beginners methods like those above, also for orientation) I got a sub2 
average recently (by now I've learned a few algorithms, though).

    Hey!

Ok, i might have a been a bit premature with judging VB as very 
slow. it seems later versions of VB have gotten up to speed,unlike 
the early versions ... If the shapes work in VB as they do in Delphi 
then for sure u are not going the best way about it. What u need is 
a color-array

clrArray= array[0..5] of color -&gt; 6 different colors

Now have the facelets of the cube assigned a color by simply 
assigning a number 0-&gt;5. This converts to a color by looking up in 
the clrArray. Only look this up when u do drawing, not when doing 
behind the scenes calculations (like when scrambling the cube with 
umpteen moves). The way u do it i think ur shapes has no choice but 
to repaint themselves each time u change the colour. So when doing a 
scrambling with ur basic method one would see lots of flickering on 
the screen until the scrambling is done.

This leads me to another point. Look up how u can do double 
buffering technique. It's really worth checking out since u get a 
much more pleasant visual experience with it. Setting up double 
buffering in delphi is a breeze actually. If u put an image on a 
panel, then simple setting the panel doublebuffered will make ur 
image doublebuffered. In fact i recommend not using shapes. Make ur 
own methods for showing cubies, using simple line graphics or 
polygons. As an alternative make ur own transparent graphics 
(sprites) that u copy to the basic image when updating the display.

Yet another hint. Find some components that support DirectX if u 
wanna code it solely for Windows. U will get much faster graphics 
code than using the basic GDI, which is what u use with default 
images.

I guess that's it for now ...

Cheers!

Listen to what you say, man!

Visual Basic is not slow. The way you're using it is slow. Of course I 
agree with what you say, that C++ with simple arrays will speed it up 
dramatically. But that's not because of C++ but because of the simple 
arrays. You could do the same thing in VB and also get a dramatic 
speed up. It's not the fault of the language.

Sorry about that. I meant to say that I have been using all three of those solutions( (L' U2 L 
y' L U' L'), (R' F U' F' R), and (L' U L x' U' R U l') ) for over a year. I usually choose which one 
to use randomly or how the cube is oriented in my hands (so I don't have to do any x, y, or 
z setup moves). Or sometimes there is another c/e pair that I could preserve for later if I 
use a certain sequence.

I hope that cleared things up for you.

Scramble with (L U L') y (L' U2 L). Now there should be a pair at FL 
that belongs into RB. Until now I would've solved this with the 
inverse of the above (i.e. with (L' U2 L y' L U' L')).

Yesterday I had the idea to rethink my 3x3 algorithms (because it has 
helped me for megaminx, too) and now I see two more ways which I might 
like better: (R' F U' F' R) and (L' U L x' U' R U [Ll]'). How do you 
solve this case?

    Haha.  I have often skipped the PLL and the OLL, but never both 
simultaneously (that I remember)...well, it may have happened, but I 
probably just didn't consider it as a real solve and insisted that I 
failed to properly mix the cube or something.

    Me too, though not nearly as fast.  Yesterday, I took my first

    It cannot be true.  A 3x3 actually has a 2x2 built into it (ignoring

That's pretty much what I said when I asked why the 2x2 should be 
harder. The answer I got was that the 3x3 offers more possibilities to 
twist.

That was a new reason to me. And I'm not making fun. I do believe he 
believes it. In the past I've read a few times from people who can 
solve the 3x3 that they have trouble with the 2x2. My guess was that 
the main reason for it is the missing "color reference" (the centers), 
and a lack of understanding their 3x3 solution. So I was a bit 
surprised when I heard this new reason. Sometimes I do want to 
understand how non-cubers think ;-)

In a general sense, the more moves are possible, the easier it gets, 
because you have more 'degrees of freedom'. Think of the Rubik's 
shells for example. That one also has to do with how many pieces are 
affected by a single move - the more piece affected by a single move, 
the harder it gets.

Anyway, the number of positions is not always a good indicator of how 
difficult a puzzle really is. It can be a lot easier than that number

- there are many moves are available
- the moves affect only a few pieces
- there are two moves that both affect a small number of pieces.

The last point is because that would make commutators (ABA'B' for 
moves A and B) have small and frequently useful effects.

As for the 2x2x2 cube, it not only has so few positions compared to 
the 3x3x3, two of the three criteria show that it should be even more 
easy than that.

    Nothing much to add.  This just reminded me of all those maths results that
are proven for dimensions 5 (sometimes 6) and higher but either require much
harder proofs or remain unproven in 3 and 4 dimensions.  Geometrically and

    Hahahahaha ... good one Stefan ;-) The missing moves on a 2x2x2 wrt 
3x3x3 are not needed. Missing color reference is understandable. 

About reference, i find it much easier to solve larger cubes layer 
by layer than edge-pairing/3x3x3 reduction. This is simply cause 
it's much easier to have the "whole cube" as reference, compared 
with having to find 2 (or 3) matching edges to pair up. Those could 
be scattered wherever on the cube. Better reference -&gt; better 
lookahead -&gt; faster solving !!! Even i probably use more moves, the 
better lookahead makes up for that :-)

Cheers!

that

centers),

Especially when you consider that all the "center" pieces you add have
only 1 facelet (no orientation). I never tried supercubing with a big
cube. Is it more interesting, or just even longer to solve than a
normal one?

If I remember correctly, last year you were thinking about a software
cube with nxnxn real cubies. I'm curious about the difficulty of such
a beast...

    Traditionally we do it across daylight savings.  That's because we only 
have one time to do it each year.  If you do it across time zones, you 
would have more opportunities up to the point where it wasn't anything 
special.

I tried it a while. It was interesting and I'd like to one day return 
to it and beat Chris but since nobody else does it it became a bit 
boring. It's not much more difficult, a few simple things help. But it 
just does take longer.

Another reason I've just heard: The 3x3 makes it easier to achieve

F2L for example) so it's easier to find the necessary motivation to 
stick with it. Psychology, yam yam.

    Hi Everyone,

Those of you in the Caltech Rubik's Cube Group already know of this 
plan pretty well by now.

We are planning a tournament for August 13, 2005 in Dallas, Texas.  It 
will be held at a museum called The Science Place and you can easily 
look them up online.  (http://www.scienceplace.org/)  We, Mark Sullivan 
and I, will be meeting with museum staff on Wednesday to discuss the 
tournament.

As with any tournament, our success depends on the number of 
participants.  I have created a table in the database section of the 
Caltech Rubik's yahoo groups.  The yahoo groups can be accessed here:  
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/caltechrubiks/ .

Just enter in your name and what city you're from.  The goal for me is 
to see that at least 20 people from this online community are 
interested in this tournament.  Sign up please if you think you can 
possibly go.

If I feel the interest in sufficient (so sign up...), we will 
officially announce this tournament after the meeting with the museum.  
For those of you where at the tournament in San Francisco, this one 
promises to be at least as good.  Our club has learned from our 
mistakes the changes that are necessary in order to run a tournament in 
a museum so it should run much more smoothly.

Anyway, I can do only so much.  Without you guys, the tournament 
doesn't happen so if you live around the Dallas area or you think you'd 
be willing to fly there for an ultimate cube experience, sign up!

    Poincare is certainly one.  I used to work in Algebraic Geometry where
results for surfaces and 3-folds also suffer from this lack of degrees of
freedom.  I have a vague memory that there are lots of other problems in
topology, knot theory, geometry etc that have the same issues.  At the very
least the the proofs are substantially more difficult and often of an
entirely different nature in lower dimensions.  I wish I remembered enough
to give even one good example!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, at a certain point adding more pieces does not make it

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's pretty much what I said when I asked why the 2x2 should

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; harder. The answer I got was that the 3x3 offers more
&gt; possibilities
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to twist.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; In a general sense, the more moves are possible, the easier it
&gt; gets,
&gt; &gt; &gt; because you have more 'degrees of freedom'. Think of the Rubik's
&gt; &gt; &gt; shells for example. That one also has to do with how many pieces
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; affected by a single move - the more piece affected by a single
&gt; move,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the harder it gets.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, the number of positions is not always a good indicator
&gt; of how
&gt; &gt; &gt; difficult a puzzle really is. It can be a lot easier than that
&gt; number
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggests if:
&gt; &gt; &gt; - there are many moves are available
&gt; &gt; &gt; - the moves affect only a few pieces
&gt; &gt; &gt; - there are two moves that both affect a small number of pieces.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The last point is because that would make commutators (ABA'B' for
&gt; &gt; &gt; moves A and B) have small and frequently useful effects.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As for the 2x2x2 cube, it not only has so few positions compared
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the 3x3x3, two of the three criteria show that it should be even
&gt; more
&gt; &gt; &gt; easy than that.

    Hi,

I've really started working on learning the L2L4 algorithms now although my
time constraints mean that it will take a while before I get there.

As I have got into them I realised that it wouldnt be too hard to combine
the 2nd and 3rd steps.  Even if the average number of moves for the
algorithms for this combined step was as high as 12 this should still
represent a saving of around 5 moves in total.  As I currently think L2L4
should give an average of 55 moves or less for the solve then this compacted
form should come out less than 50.

Two downsides at first glance:
1.  Instead of 6 + 8 = 14 algorithms for steps 2 and 3 you would need to
learn ~48 for the combination (this brings the total up to 80 something
algorithms).
2.  I think the recognition aspect of this new step would be tricky - you
have to position the corners (which are already oriented) and orient the
edges at the same time.

Any views?

    Hi everyone,

For a long time I've been interested in organizing a monthly cube 
newsletter.  I want to make this a reality, but I just don't have the 
time (or the patience for that matter) to do it all myself.  

I'm looking for fellow cubers who are interested in helping out with 
this.  I need people for editing, writing articles, etc.  

A lot of fantastic ideas have been tossed around, but I'd like 
everyone's feedback on what exactly this newsletter should include.  
Post any ideas you have on the group, so that everyone else can build 
on it.  Anyone who is interested in helping with the paper directly, 
please contact me personally: richy_jr_2000@...

I hope to hear from all of you!  Happy cubing!

    Hi Per, Doug, Richard, anyone,

   I don't think that any part of that rotates like a Rubik's cube.
It's only a magic trick, and I don't think whoever designed it paid
any attention to the color distribution beyond it *looking* mixed up.

Yes, Happy Easter. Anyone doing any eggs like a cube?

    I read on speedcubing.com under algorithms that with the advantanges 
of COLL are 

- in 1 out of 12 cases you can solve the LL in one algorithm!
- in 8 out of 12 cases you leave an easy 3-cycle of edges
- in 2 out of 12 cases you leave the edges zigzag permutation
- in 1 out of 12 cases you leave the edges cross permutation 

&gt;From my own experience, I'd say that the 8/12 to get a 3 cycle is 
right, but the 1/12 you are supposed to solve the LL in 1 alg, i 
think it is more like 1/25.  I did the cube 50 times with COLL and I 
got 35 3-edgecycles, 7 zigzags, 6 cross, and only 2 solves.

    - You can see any cubie as a 6-color little cube.
- When the whole big 3x3x3 cube is solved, all the cubies have the
same orientation.
- A cubie can have 24 orientations.
- At a corner position, a given corner cubie can have only 3 orientations.
- At an edge position, a given edge cubie can have only 2 orientations.
- At a center position, a given center cubie can have only 4 orientations.
- Have a thought for the 27th cubie inside if you want.
- At any position, two different cubies can't share the same orientation.

With fixed centers, you've got:
(24x21x18x15x12x9x6x3) [corners]
x (24x22x20x18x16x14x12x10x8x6x4x2) [edges]
/ 3 / 2 / 2 [don't forget the well known parity constraints]
= 43,252,003,274,489,856,000

Think of it this way. There are 24 possible orientations for the first
corner position, but only 21 for the second position, because it lacks
the 3 orientations that only the previous cubie could have displayed
here, and so on.
There's nothing new, of course,  (24x21x18x15x12x9x6x3) = 8!
[permutations] x 3^8 [orientations].
But it comes from a different point of view. All cubies are born
equal, but in different places.

Gilles.


PS: Don't worry for my mental health, it's because of the new glue I
bought. It makes me want to dream about finding an optimal algorithm :-)

I like it :-) Maybe for other puzzles this kind of view (or even more 
others) can be helpful to compute the number of positions? I vaguely 
remember that for example the number of positions for Square-1 for 
example was harder to determine...

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I've really started working on learning the L2L4 algorithms now 
although my
&gt; time constraints mean that it will take a while before I get there.
&gt; 
&gt; As I have got into them I realised that it wouldnt be too hard to 
combine
&gt; the 2nd and 3rd steps.  Even if the average number of moves for the
&gt; algorithms for this combined step was as high as 12 this should 
still
&gt; represent a saving of around 5 moves in total.  As I currently 
think L2L4
&gt; should give an average of 55 moves or less for the solve then this 
compacted
&gt; form should come out less than 50.
&gt; 
&gt; Two downsides at first glance:
&gt; 1.  Instead of 6 + 8 = 14 algorithms for steps 2 and 3 you would 
need to
&gt; learn ~48 for the combination (this brings the total up to 80 
something
&gt; algorithms).
&gt; 2.  I think the recognition aspect of this new step would be 
tricky - you
&gt; have to position the corners (which are already oriented) and 
orient the
&gt; edges at the same time.
&gt; 
&gt; Any views?

    The chance of getting only 2 out of 50 COLL solves with no PLL alg 
needed is 25*49*(1/12)^2*(11/12)^48 = 0.1306

I don't think a 13.06% chance of getting that particular setup is 
anything unreasonably small or anything.  Unlikely maybe, but 
nothing crazy.

Also the odds are definitely not going to be anything different from 
1/12 for getting the solved PLL case, just look at all the possible 
permutations of the 4 LL edges given the rest of the cube solved.

Interestingly the chances of doing 50 COLL solves and never seeing 
the solved PLL case is (11/12)^50=0.0129 or 1.29% which doesn't seem 
like that unlikely of an occurence either.

Hi Stefan

With square-1, you do need to decide which configurations are 
counted: i.e., whether you are going to ignore rotations of the u and 
d layers, or whether the shape is to be twistable (no corner bridging 
the seam). But the counting is straightforward, regardless of the 
choice you make.

One approach is to use products of binomial coefficients to count the
layer-shapes (or half-layer shapes) for each of the possible
distributions of corners &amp; edges between the 2 layers (or between the
4 half-layers). For example, a half layer containing 2C and 2E has
binomial(4,2) possible shapes, and there will be similar factors for
each of the other 3 half-layers. Then add up these products for each
possible corner/edge distributions (among the half-layers, in this 
case). Although this sounds messy, it really needs only a few lines 
of arithmetic in practice.

One funny thing is that if you ignore the u and d rotations, the
total number of configurations (which includes the perms of corners &amp;
edges within the shape, and the orientation of the centre slice) 
comes out to be very simple: 15!/3. [Generalizations are on Jaap's 
square-1 page.] To see why the result is so simple, it turns out to 
be better to do the calculation quite differently... but let's not 
get into that right now!

The tricky thing, though, is to be sure that all these shapes (and
permutations) that have been counted are actually achievable by
twisting the puzzle. I don't know any way (for the shapes) apart
from mindless, exhaustive checking :(

Yeah but I think it's still kinda messy. I'd probably write it like 
this:

sum(i=0..3) :
sum(j=max(0,2-i)..3) :
sum(k=max(0,5-i-j)..min(3,8-i-j)) :
(6-2i)Ci * (6-2j)Cj * (6-2k)Ck * (6-2(8-i-j-k))C(8-i-j-k) * 2

That looks a lot more difficult than 8!*12!*3^8*2^12/12 ;-)

Can you write it significantly better?

&gt; total number of configurations (which includes the perms of corners

Yep, that's where I read your name the first time :-) A very nice 
result. And as you say, it's better to look at it a different way, 
which is what Gilles did, too (probably still different, since we're 
talking about different puzzles ;-).

&gt; The tricky thing, though, is to be sure that all these shapes (and
&gt; permutations) that have been counted are actually achievable by
&gt; twisting the puzzle. I don't know any way (for the shapes) apart
&gt; from mindless, exhaustive checking :(

That's the tough part. For the 3x3 it's very easy to prove what you 
can and can't do, i.e. prove the factor 12 that we lose.

Btw, a while ago I analyzed the "2-generator for Square-1", i.e. take 
a solved one and only twist U and L (for example). It's still possible 
to actually reach all shapes you could imagine with the pieces. And 
it's not even much slower. So I have this idea to get a normally 
scrambled Square-1 to cube shape by building a half square (often 
there's one already) and then twist only U and L. Oh well... maybe 
when I finally decide to focus on this puzzle ;-)

Cheers!

&gt; Can you write it significantly better?

Not really, but there are, in fact, only 4 distinct terms to
calculate here. If the numbers of corners in the half-layers are
abcd, you have

case, multiplicity, product of binomial factors:
3320  (4;2,1,1)=12. 1x1x6x1=6
3311  (4;2,2)=6.... 1x1x5x5=25
3221  (4;2,1,1)=12. 1x6x6x5=180
2222  (4;4)=1...... 6x6x6x6=1296

where e.g. (4;2,1,1) is the multinomial coefficient 4!/(2!1!1!).
This gives the total number of twistable shapes as

12x6 + 6x25 + 12x180 + 1x1296 = 3678.

&gt; Btw, a while ago I analyzed the "2-generator for Square-1", i.e.
take
&gt; a solved one and only twist U and L (for example). It's still
possible
&gt; to actually reach all shapes you could imagine with the pieces. And
&gt; it's not even much slower.

Your proposed method is certainly interesting. When I heard about
this last Oct, I modified my own solver to allow 2-generator solving
as an option. Some sequences were usable, but most just seemed too
long (e.g., I think it took 36 turns to swap 2 adjacent edges in the
U layer, compared with 27 turns for an unrestricted solve).

It's a question of whether these restricted moves are fast enough to
compensate for the extra length. I'd be interested to hear how you 
get on with it.

&gt; &gt; when I finally decide to focus on this puzzle ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Stefan,
&gt; 
&gt; Looking at this, I think I must have misunderstood your proposal!  
&gt; You are proposing only to do the SHAPES this way? :S

Well, I'm not sure. I'm proposing to do *at least* the shapes that way 
:-) That's all I've analyzed completely and it looked nice. I've also 
analyzed 2-piece-swaps and 3-piece-cycles and that looked somehow ok. 
But I haven't thought about the "middle of the solve" in 2gen at all, 
so I won't propose that yet.

Here's a nice alg I found a while ago. Hold the solved Square-1 so 
that the middle layer has the front gap at the right. A "/" means 
twist left half 180 degrees and a number means twist the U layer that 
many 1/12.

/ -3 / -1 / -2 / 4 / -4 / 4 / 4 / -4 / 4 / 4 / 2 / -5 / 3 /

It should swap two corners. And it has 27 moves. Here's another one 
with 25 moves that swaps two corners in different layers:

/ -3 / -3 / 4 / -4 / 4 / 4 / -4 / 4 / 4 / -4 / -5 / 3 /

It also flips the left middle layer piece, though.

How do you like these?

Cheers!
Stefan

Mmm... that could be useful: it is 5 turns over the optimal, but the 
unrestricted optimal sequence is slightly awkward (however, the 
reflected version is no harder).

But it is rarely necessary to swap a single pair of corners; you'd 
usually want to do other things at the same time. By far the most 
useful odd perm for me is (with your conventions)
/ -3/ -3/ 2/ 2/ -4/ 4/ 2/ -5/ 3/
which does a 3 cycle on the U layer corners as well as a swap of the 
2 D corners. This one is optimal, even if you remove the "&lt;u,/&gt;" 
restriction.

Mmh, I like that one. Hey, did you notice the start and especially the 
end looks very similar to mine?

I guess I'm not that advanced yet, though. I don't even know a handful 
of algorithms. I solve one layer pretty much intuitively and then try 
to solve the other layer by repeatedly applying these algs (now with 
(u,d) notation meaning clockwise 1/12 turns):

A = / (0,-3) / (3,-3) / (0,-3) / (0,3) / (-3,0) / (0,3)
(the last turn (0,3) isn't necessary all the time)

B = (-1,0) / (-3,0) / (1,1) / (2,-1) / (1,0)

Actually I found the first alg (A) using ACube restricted to an &lt;U,D,
L2&gt; 2x2 cube :-) Try this to a 2x2 cube: (L2 D' L2 U D' L2 D' L2 D L2 
U' L2 D).

I might for example do this combination which results in a 3-cycle of 
U-corners:
A (2,0) A (-2,0)

I'd use B for edge permutations in U, e.g.:
B (3,0) B (-3,0)

Recently "discovered" that I don't *actively* use very many, either.  
Need to spend some time learning the most frequent cases for the 
final permutation... knowing about 10 more of them could help 
significantly, though eliminating the gaps between algs might help 
more.

&gt; A = / (0,-3) / (3,-3) / (0,-3) / (0,3) / (-3,0) / (0,3)

I originally found this (and some others) using Ron's cube solver, 
though they could easily be got by the "method" of "take the top 
layer apart and put it back together another way." I use the 
combination you describe for 3-cycles, though it is quite inefficient 
for one of the double 3-cycles.

Lazy, lazy, lazy :(

&gt; Not really, but there are, in fact, only 4 distinct terms to

&gt; abcd, you have
&gt; 
&gt; case, multiplicity, product of binomial factors:
&gt; 3320  (4;2,1,1)=12. 1x1x6x1=6
&gt; 3311  (4;2,2)=6.... 1x1x5x5=25
&gt; 3221  (4;2,1,1)=12. 1x6x6x5=180
&gt; 2222  (4;4)=1...... 6x6x6x6=1296
&gt; 
&gt; where e.g. (4;2,1,1) is the multinomial coefficient 4!/(2!1!1!).
&gt; This gives the total number of twistable shapes as
&gt; 
&gt; 12x6 + 6x25 + 12x180 + 1x1296 = 3678.

Ok, I finally dared to look at this again ;-) It's of course much 
easier than I thought, but all the numbers and the new notation had 
scared me...

My own formula was slightly wrong, it should be
(6-i)Ci * (6-j)Cj * (6-k)Ck * (6-(8-i-j-k))C(8-i-j-k) * 2
instead of
(6-2i)Ci * (6-2j)Cj * (6-2k)Ck * (6-2(8-i-j-k))C(8-i-j-k) * 2.
Found it out the hard way when my program crashed ;-)

But now I get 7356, exactly twice as much as yours, which is not 
surprising since I multiply with 2 (because of the middle layer).

Yes. It means the cube shape is in the dark backyard, a few steps away 
from where all the fun is :-) We should really "solve" to a certain 
state that is actually a bit away from the real solution, and then 
finish with a few steps. The nice intermediate shape could be the 
"Barrel-Barrel" one, for example (I think that's what Jaap said when 
we talked about it a while ago). And then at the very end, finish with 
(0,-3)/(3,3)/.

    Hi Vangie and Evan,

I'm in Midland, Texas right now.  The radiator hose on the car actually 
came off when we were in Abilene so we had to stop and get it fixed 
this morning.

Anyway, Evan, I was wondering if you would be willing to discuss the 
possibility of turning your robot into a museum exhibit.  Basically, 
I'm thinking that you have some type of user interface with the robot 
that would allow someone not only to tell the robot to make certain 
moves, but also to solve the cube, scramble the cube, and also perform 
certain algorithms so the user could see what happens to certain piece. 
  It'll look much cooler because it's a robot.

As part of the exhibit, we would also have cubes around for people to 
play with of course.  I will speak to some mathematicians about writing 
some simple mathematical explanations on group theory and everything.

One question I think is what resources does the museum have?  I think 
we can do quite a bit but again, we're just students and I think we 
would need some of the museum's help in setting up the exhibit to 
actually turn this project into a museum quality exhibit.

Actually, I'll talk to Mark about the writing about the group theory 
and mathematics behind the Rubik's Cube

This e-mail is also being sent to the international Rubik's Cube forum. 
  If anyone has idea for a Rubik's Cube exhibit for a museum, we would 
greatly appreciate any suggestions.  If there are people out there who 
feel they could write an exhibit explanation on the mathematics and 
group theory behind a Rubik's Cube, I'd love to hear from you.  The key 
is "simple"... there'll be six year old playing with the exhibit.

Mark thinks we could write something about how the Rubik's Cube isn't 
commutative in such a manner that would be understood by most people.

&gt; Hi Vangie,
&gt;
&gt; While we were driving away, I remembered that a high school student in
&gt; Southern California has built a Rubik's Cube solving robot.  My idea
&gt; right now is that you have this robot on display and you can tell it to
&gt; do certain moves or you can have it do algorithms to see what it does
&gt; to small sections of the cube.  Should I put him in contact with you?

Do you find any information wrong?

More?

Nice website. The page at the beginning is cool. I find the small 
window for the pages a little hard to use. Also, the slider bar for 
the window is very hard to see. The content of the pages is very 
nice. You describe the 3x3x3 solutions well. Over all, you have a 
very nice website.


&gt; 
&gt; Isn't your site in my cube link area (maybe it is, then you could

Nope, didn't see my webiste in your lust, but i'll put a link to

Turning my cube photo into a binary cube was a clever idea. How did 
you do this?

I like the design of your site. The matrix-style falling letters on 
the right of the main panel are very cool, as are the rotating times

    pjgat09, thank you for the comments. Maybe your screen resolution is to low,
making the "main" window to small, I have developed the page in 1280x960 and
only check it for larger resolutions. Also, I have only checked it in IE6. I
will take the slider colour into consideration.

Did you look really carefully in the links area? Your site is at the end of

    Hey all,

 Just wondering if there is any validate in the thought of preparing for only for certain PLL algs when performing certain OLL algs using the Fridrich or any other Layer by Layer Method.

   For example, if it comes up that (let's say) we need to perform case# 27 to complete PLL, will the OLL cases be (let's say) case V, T and E only.

   Does anyone think that this is a valid theory which could be used to reduce times?

PB (ave) - 40.0s (reduced by 37s since Dec03)
Thanks
Dwayne

    After putting a little more thought into the definition of PLL &amp; OLL, I 
realized that there is no direct correlation between the two.

OLL is the correct orientation of the 8 cubies and
PLL is the correct placement of the 8 cubies.

(i.e. the PLL cannot be pre-determined (or only certain ones) dependent on 
the OLL used)

    Right.  A quick check to this would be as follows:

Say you wanted to prove that performing a certain orientation would 
eliminate the possibility of getting a specific permutation.  
Perform the inverse of that permutation and follow it with the 
inverse of that orientation.  After orienting, of course, you get 
that same permutation.  Hence, any orientation can lead to any 
permutation.

    It seems to simple to us, but one of the most impressive things you can 
do with a cube to regular people is to take it apart.

An exhibit with a partially taken apart cube and some text and/or 
diagram explaining the mechanics would be a sure hit, and very simple 
and cheap. You can do this for all sizes.

    I think a while ago someone asked how to swap two corners at the end 
and we suggested he should swap two deges instead and then do a PLL.

I can't say I've found something better but I've tried again. Basis 
was this 3x3 alg:
U R2 U' R2 D B2 L2 U L2 D' B2

It has the nice property of being a Domino alg. So for the 4x4 we can 
do this:
U . (Rr)2 U' (Rr)2 D (Bb)2 (Ll)2 U (Ll)2 D' (Bb)2

Now at the '.' insert this:
R (r U R' U') (r' U R U') R'
R (U' R' U r') (U' R U r) R'

Written nicely it's:
U
(Rr) U R' U' r' U R U2
(R' U r' U' R U (Rr)' R2
U' (Rr)2 D (Bb)2 (Ll)2 U (Ll)2 D' (Bb)2

Still way too slow to beat T-perm + dedge-swap of course...

Cheers!

    Hi everyone!

 

I am soon going to make an update to my links page, and I would love to be
able to link to your website. 

 

I have set up a Link Exchange form on my homepage - www.cubestation.co.uk
&lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/&gt;  which makes it very easy to submit your
link. Soon I hope to have a much more comprehensive set of links than I do
currently. So if you have a website and would like a link from
www.cubestation.co.uk &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/&gt;  then please send me
your link! All I ask is that you could link to my site also :)

 

Cheers,

 

Dan Harris :)

    Hey Chris,

how far are you with learning the 1211 algs?
Digging out very old posts is fun ;-)

Cheers!

&gt; I've decided to try and learn all the moves
&gt; necessary to do the 3rd layer in one algorithm. There are
&gt; 1211 total, and seeing as I already know 53 of those
&gt; moves (each move from the two algorithm method can be
&gt; used) so I need to learn 1158 more moves. I figured I'm
&gt; going to learn these in steps. First I'm going to learn
&gt; all the moves where all four edges need to be
&gt; flipped, around 150 or so, then I want to learn all the
&gt; ones where all the edges are fine, and corners need to
&gt; be flipped. Then I'm going to learn the rest, with
&gt; two edges, in groups, like C's and L' and all. I was
&gt; curious if anyone knew of anyone else who's ever tried to
&gt; do this. I know that it's going to take literally
&gt; years to learn all the moves, but I'm going to try to
&gt; incorporate the moves I know into my solution method so that
&gt; I can start to learn them really well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The
&gt; reason I wanted to switch is that I'm using the Cube
&gt; Explorer and Cube Optimizer program at
&gt;
    <a href="http://home.t-online.de/home/Kociemba/cube.htm" target="new">
     http://home.t-online.de/home/Kociemba/cube.htm
    </a>
    to find 
all the moves and they all seem to be
&gt; between 11 and 16 moves. I figured if I can on average
&gt; cut almost 10 moves off my solution, and work on the
&gt; first two layers, I finally figured out what you all
&gt; meant about taking advantage of empty slots during the
&gt; first part. For example I see how to put a corner or
&gt; edge in using only 5 moves instead of 7 or 8. I
&gt; figured that I could do the cube in 13 or 14 seconds on a
&gt; good time and under 20 pretty much every time. If
&gt; anyone has any info on this then I'd be glad to hear it.
&gt; I figured if I memorize the moves right, in groups,
&gt; then I won't forget them as I'll know to practice each
&gt; group, and it should also be relatively easy to
&gt; recognize the positions. I tried just recognizing the
&gt; positions (position and orientation of the pieces) of the
&gt; third layer after solving the first two and it usually
&gt; takes around 2 seconds, so I figure with practice I
&gt; might be able to cut that to under 2 seconds. Anyway if
&gt; anyone is interested I can give you the moves I know so
&gt; far, or you can download the Cube Explorer and
&gt; Optimizer program to find them. Or if anyone would also
&gt; like to try this then let me know. It would be cool to
&gt; be able to learn the moves with someone. I'll post a
&gt; message on here if I recognize a position and am able to
&gt; do the 3rd layer in one move when I speed solve, and
&gt; how much time it takes. I don't know very many moves
&gt; but when I see one I know I'll let you all know how
&gt; it went. Anyway if anyone has any info on this
&gt; please let me know, I'd be interested in hearing
&gt; it.

    I have the Harry Potter Magic. It's not bad on its own, but the 
strings break very easily. In the first couple weeks of having mine, I 
broke two strings, but that could have been from misuse more than

    Nice, thanks! Now what's my excuse again why I'm not learning the 
remaining 3 PLLs? Especially the list of pages should be useful. But 
why does Lars link to Macky?

You might want to try Peter's 12-1 algorithm:
(R'U¬≤)(RU¬≤)(R'FRUR'U')(R'F'R¬≤)U'

It's one of your "&lt;3s" cases but one of my fastest (about 2.25). The 
two U2 at the start aren't completely fluid but the rest is pretty 
much one very long finger trick.

    Stefan,
They are identical in quality to the new Magics being sold. I have yet 
to notice any differece, however one of my Harry Potter's has one tile 
that doesn't sit right, the same as one my OddzOn Magics. I've been 
buying them up them up the past month to use them for some sort of 
project I haven't thought of yet.  I do want to  make a Create the 
Cube Magic, but I can't figure out why I can't print the template on 
Jaap's page to the right size. One last thing, the Harry Potter 
pictures are just a little creepy.  Something about him...

    The comparison is from memory. I played with mine a lot when I got 
it, and then a while later I tried solving Mike Grimsley's original 
one. So the difference could easily have been due to wear, 
stiffness, or simple mistake of memory. But I remember the two 
feeling very different.

    Hi all,

Here's an interesting problem I came across while playing with my 
keychain cube:

Is it possible to solve a keychain 3x3x3 cube by turning the faces 
only with the help of the keychain? (and holding the cube with the 
other hand :-) )

In other words, there has to exist a specific corner piece which is 
moved all the time. Or in other words, solve the cube using f, u, r 
moves only.

I managed to solve the F2L intuitively, and also found some nice LL 
algs. The shortest I found is F' U' F R U' B U B' R' (corner is 
first in UFR position). I also found an edge 3-cycle using 
repetitions and insertions of this alg.

A solution exists, I'm sure. But I didn't yet find a strict 
demonstration.

Three of the four in the second row from bottom:

It's not that bad, they now take me about 4s because I do T-perm + 
edge 3-cycle. But it's still frustrating every time I have to do it 
(and since I only know half the OLL, I still often have a 4-look LL 
which is extremely frustrating, especially one-handed or with 4x4 and

    Man, is this hard... I was able to do the cross, then an F2L corner 
was correct already and I wasn't even able to insert the edge. Ok, I 
only tried a few minutes... :-)

Intuitively I'd say it should be possible to reach any position, but I 
can't think of a proof yet. Maybe something like:

"Here's how I do an edge 3-cyle. With setup moves I can use it to 
cycle any 3 edges and also to flip any two. Similar for corners. And a 
quarter turn handles the parity. Bingo."

Or alternatively:

"Here's how I simulate an F turn in &lt;f,u,r&gt;. Similar for U and R, so I 
can do all six turns. Bingo."

But that's very rough, I know...

Ah, ok. Yeah, I have a very similar feeling when I compare the old 
(black) and new (red) normal magics. The old ones feel somehow 
heavier/smoother but I guess that's because they're played with a lot 
more. When I compare them visually there's no difference but the 
picture. Maybe I should weigh them :-)

MGW, thanks a lot for your comparison, too! Gives me more confidence 
to buy a few...

    that's funny--I've just been learning those these past 2 weeks and 
they were the last PLLs I needed to learn, and they were driving me 
nuts until this weekend (thanks for the tips, Frank and Duane).  It 
was taking me way too long to distinguish between those 4, and the 
algs weren't the easiest or most intuitive for me to pick up.  

Now, I line up the 2 corners that are correct on their correct side 
which I make the Left side, which leaves the corner/middle connected 
pair in one of 4 positions near my right hand.  that helps me 
quickly identify which of the 4 algs to do.  I know one alg for each 
from that position, and although they're not my fastest, it's a lot 
faster [for me] than the 2 PLLs that I used to do.  

The other identifier that helps me distinguish between those 4 cases 
is if the corner/middle connected pair has the middle on the front 
or back, the alg starts with a R2 then u or u' [whichever moves that 
middle to my L side]; the other 2 have that middle piece on the R 
side with either the corner at top or bottom, if it's at the top, I 
start my alg with R'U'R with my thumb on that top corner, then a 
double turn of the face where that corner used to be [the Back 
face], but if that corner/middle pair has the corner in the front 
position, the alg starts with a quick RUR' trigger followed by a 
double turn of the face where that corner used to be [the Front].  
for me, once I get my fingers started, they can do the rest. the 
hard part was just remembering which alg went with which situation, 
and remembering how that alg started.

don't know if that's clear, but hope it helps...

I do that, too :-) Then I can solve it with TPerm + y/y' + edge3cycle. 
The way I recognize the case is to look whether the UF and UR edges 
belong to their opposite places. Currently I only know the UR=yes 
UF=no which I solve with (R2(U'E)RU')(RU)(R'(UE')R2)y(RU'R'U)

    You can distinguis all PLL cases by just seeing two sides of course, first determine how the corners are swapped, and then determine the relative positions of the edge pieces (eg opposite to the corners, or adjacnet to the corners etc).

I do it after I analyzed the corner permutation. I rotate the U layer

Well, some permutations are easy to fully recognize because they're

When do you do it? Do you know about other top cubers?

    I think what I do is adjust the U-layer to match up any adjacent 
corners &amp; edges and then perform the algorithm.. The exception to 
this is that when there are no adjacent corner/edges solved so I 
match up either all corners or all edges.  Then I perform the alg.

    I solved the F2L by the Lars Petrus method, which I think is easier 
for this problem because the pieces stay packed and you can move that 
corner around without moving any already solved pieces in more ways 
than with cross.

Since I already found an edge 3-cycle and two PLL's (which switch two 
corners and two edges) I can get any possible PLL. I also have two 
OLL's, and I that's enough for getting every possible OLL (both of 
them flip edges, so by doing one and then the other to flip back the 
edges, we get a certain corner twist. By repeating this corner twist 
we can get any corner position). It is noticeable though that you have 
to be careful how the algs have to be applied with respect to the 
keychain corner, since the same alg can start in different places 
which are not symmetrical as on the normal 3x3x3. But still I think 
it's possible.

    Well, I can't really say for "top cubers", but personally I do not consider the other two layers at all during the recognition stage of the LL permutation. I see the permutation, I do the set-up move to get it to the correct angle for me to execute the move, and then execute, no matter how the LL is aligned with the other layers.

Following Ron's advice, I also have a place during every PLL algorithm where I can then recognise how I will have to align the U layer to solve the cube entirely. This saves maybe 0.5 seconds, since if you did not have this trick up your sleeve you would waste a little time trying to see how to turn the LL at the end of the algorithm (although U2 is easier to see than U or U')

So summary, I recognise the permutation, execute the alg whilst recognising how the U layer is aligned, then do the necessary U move at the end of the permutation.

    Hmm, very interesting. So you align the U face twice, once before and 
once after the algorithm, right? It makes it a lot easier for me to 
recognize if I align it completely and rotate the cube before 
analyzing the edges, but I guess it costs valuable time. I haven't put 
much thought into recognizing the LL without the F2L as reference. How 
hard would you say is that?

Oh boy... see, this is one of the reasons I'll never be a very fast 
3x3 solver. All these details and algorithms... too much for me ;-)

    Hey everyone,

I know I've mentioned that I am working on ZBF2L, and I've recently
made an improvement to my PLL because of it that I wanted to share.

Since ZBF2L is followed by COLL, 2/3 of your solves end up in a 3
cycle of edges.  Also, 1/6 of your solves end up in the zig zag
pattern.  Since these come up _so_ often I have revised me way of
executing these algs.

I now use what I consider 12 algs for the edge 3-cycle (including
reflections) and what I consider 6 algs for the zig-zag patter also
including reflections.  I also use my alg for the plus permutation
where opposite pairs of edges swap in addition to its reflection, so
what I consider to be two algs.

I want to soon work on my permutations page to include all the algs I
use now as well as finger tricks, but since that may take a while I
wanted to post about these new algs here.

Obviously this approach is good (IMHO) for people who orient the edges
of their LL, then do COLL and then do the edge PLL.  However, even if
you are just using OLL and PLL, these algs make the edge cycle
permutations very, very fast.

Here are all the algs I use for all the edge permutations, in addition
to how I view them.  What is most important here is which hand is
gripping the cube after finishing the alg just before PLL.  So I not
only pay attention to what case it is, but which hand is gripping the
cube.

---------------

Edge 3-cycles:

1) Right hand is gripping the cube

 a) the solved edge is on the F face
  - edges go clockwise: ((L')2 U) (L U L' U') (L' U') (L' U L')
  - edges go counter-clockwise: (L U' L) (U) (L U) (L U') (L' U' L2)

 b) the solved edge is on the back face
  - edges go clockwise: (L' U L') (U') (L' U') (L' U) (L U L2)
  - edges go counter-clockwise: ((L)2 U' L') (U' L U) (L U) (L U' L)

 c) the solved edge is on the right face
  - egdge go clockwise: (L' U2 L') (U') (L' U' (L)2) (U) (L U L2)
  - edges go counter-clockwise: ((L)2 U') (L' U' (L)2) (U) (L U) (L U2 L)

 d) the solved edge is on the left face
  - regrip the cube with the left hand and do 2d)

2) Left hand is gripping the cube

 a) the solved edge is on the F face
  - edges go clockwise: (R' U R') (U') (R' U') (R' U) (R U (R')2)
  - edges go counter-clockwise: ((R)2 U') (R' U' R) (U) (R U) (R U' R)

 b) the solved edge is on the back face
  - edges go clockwise: ((R')2 U R) (U R' U') (R' U') (R' U R')
  - edges go counter-clockwise: (R U' R) (U) (R U) (R U') (R' U' (R)2)

 c) the solved edge is on the right face
  - regrip the cube with the right hand and do 1c)

 d) the solved edge is on the left face
  - edges go clockwise: ((R')2 U) (R U (R')2) (U') (R' U') (R' U2 R')
  - edge go counter-clockwise: (R U2 R) (U) (R U (R')2) (U') (R' U' (R)2)

I consider each of these a separate case and as you can see the only
time you ever have to regrip the cube is for 1d and 2c.  This is a
fast regrip since it only goes from right to left or vice versa and
there is no cube rotation.

As you can see I only really use 2 algorithms, but I do the inverse of
one of them as well as the inverse and rotation of one of the others.
 It helps to think of them as really 12 different cases though instead
of 2 algs applied 12 different ways.

--------

I also use 6 algs for the zig-zag case.  It really is only one
algorithm, similar to the above.  However, when you view it as 6
different cases the solves always go quickly and you don't have to
think about which way to turn the U layer when you're done.

If you would like an explanation of the cube rotation notation I'm
using see http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/3-orientations.html and
read the info at the top.

1) Algs done right handed:
 a) x' (R U') (R' U) [(D R' D) (U')] (R' U R) z' x' (l2 U)
  - without finger trick notation this alg is R B' R' B F R' F B' R' B
R F2 U
 b) x' (R U') (R' U) [(D R' D) (U')] (R' U R) z' x' (l2 U')
  - without finger trick notation this alg is R B' R' B F R' F B' R' B
R F2 U'
 c) x' (R U') (R' U) [(D R' D) (U')] (R' U R) z' x' (l2)
  - without finger trick notation this alg is R B' R' B F R' F B' R' B
R F2

Do the inverse of each alg to get to the situation.  As you can see
the only thing that changes is the U turn at the end.  It either goes
one way or the other, or isn't there at all.

2) Algs done left handed:
 a) x' (L' U) (L U') [(D' L D') (U)] (L U' L') z x' (r2 U')
  - without finger trick notation this alg is L' B L B' F' L F' B L B'
L' F2 U'
 b) x' (L' U) (L U') [(D' L D') (U)] (L U' L') z x' (r2 U)
  - without finger trick notation this alg is L' B L B' F' L F' B L B'
L' F2 U
 c) x' (L' U) (L U') [(D' L D') (U)] (L U' L') z x' (r2)
  - without finger trick notation this alg is L' B L B' F' L F' B L B'
L' F2
 
Again this is always the same alg with a different U move at the end,
or even no U move.  It is better to view this as 6 different cases
than to think of which way the U face is turned when solving.

-----------

Lastly the edge perm where both pairs of opposite centers switch.  I
use the same alg for each case, but I would do either the alg or its
reflections depending on the last face turned and which hand is
gripping the cube before I start.

1) right hand is gripping the cube
 a) L' (R' U2 R) L y' R (L U2 L') R'

2) left hand is gripping the cube
 b) R (L U2 L') R' y L' (R' U2 R) L

------------

Especially for when you always end with one of these permutations I
find it is better to expand to using more algs than to rotate the cube
and/or the U layer to get it to an angle that you know.

I think this would also be helpful for a 2,3, or 4 look approach.  You
have to work more to learn lots of cases where previously there were
only two, but you can almost always do the edge permutations from the
angle you encounter them.  You will have to rotate the cube and/or
regrip sometimes using these algs, but much less often than normal.

Again I find this helpful for VH solving, but I think it would apply
to solving in general which is why I posted.  Obviously I think this
approach is very worthwhile for those using some sort of ZBF2L style
solving and always (or often) ending with an edge permutation.

    Come on... only 3 people have signed up saying they would be interested 
in the tournament at The Science Place.  Check out 
http://www.scienceplace.org/ .  The museum staff is absolutely thrilled 
to be hosting the event and the venue is just spectacular.  I am also 
currently in contact with ESPN and I'm working on getting them to tape 
us.

Please sign up in our groups 
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/caltechrubiks/ and go into the 
database section and put down your name.  I'm in a lot of trouble if 
only 5 people go to this tournament.

Now, this part is for all you Texans out there.  I drove through Texas, 
sure, your state is very big.  However, if you live in Texas, please 
please PLEASE come to this tournament.  I'm going through a lot of 
effort to hold this tournament which is approximately 1200 miles away 
from my home!  If I can travel that far to do you guys a favor, you 
should consider doing me a favor by showing up.  Houston and San 
Antonio are only like, 6 hour drives away.  You should realize it's 
like a 20 hour drive for me so if I can make it, so can you.  If 
there's a tournament you want to invest money in, you should really 
consider buying yourself a plane ticket for this one.  ESPN!  Just 
think about it... ESPN!

All of you Texas with your "Don't Mess With Texas" t-shirts... well, 
yeah, you should... eh, whatever.  Come to this tournament please!  I'm 
putting a lot of time and energy into this and I don't get paid 
anything.

I must doubt this now. I spent maybe 2 hours on it only to realize 
that I was very blind. Notice that in order to be solved, the keychain 
corner must travel an even number of quarter turns. Since we're only 
allowed to make turns including that corner, we're restricted to an 
even number of quarter turns overall. Thus, we have the parity 
problem. I don't think you can switch two corners and two edges unless 
one of them is the keychain corner. Or am I making another mistake 
(actually it would be the first then ;-) and you can do this?

    I just realized something I had never thought of.  Winning moves
doesn't produce true general cubes where the orientations of the
centers doesn't matter.  The white sticker always has a design on it,
so in competitions your cube is only solved 1/4 the time, yet we still
consider it solved.

So we've all been frequently (75% of the time actually) counting cubes
as solved that never were in fact solved.  There has been rampant
cheating in the cubing community for almost 2 years :)

Perhaps we should memorize which way the design of the white sticker
is oriented when we buy our cubes to make sure we don't cheat and just
half solve it :)

Logos on stickers should be forbidden in competitions. At least, it

    Ok guys, I am an better-than-newbie at cubing right
now. I can solve the cube in about 2 mins but my
method is really very sloggy and it consumes a lot of
steps. So I was thinking of shifting to some another
method. I found that there are mainly two widespread
methods - the Lars Petrus's Corner method and the
cross method(I am not thinking about the Fridrich
method right now). So can you guys suggest which
method to use considering the documentation available
of the method and the number of steps achieved by each
method. 
Currently the Lars Petrus's method is on top of  my
list since it has some nice Java cubes alongwith the
explanation. I havent found such a site for the cross
method. 
Please reply!

    Hmmm ...

So confusing ... they have not only changed the layout of the groups 
but also the way to present messages. _Next_ now means going 
backwards in time. And on a single page the most recent post is on 
top and not at bottom. This feels a bit like cubing in front of a 
mirror ... Humans are slaves to their habits. Take the cube for 
instance ... hehehe ...

Great to see that im on top 10 in posting messages last year. I need 
to keep posting to make it to the alltime list :-P

I don't think any normal individual will ever learn the full 1211 LL 
cases. But statistically there should be many non-normal cubers :D 
So who knows ... If someone can finish off the 700 zb algs, yes then 
why not the 1211 Helmstadter algs ( or eqvivalent ones ... )

As u have noticed (or not) im reading up now after coming back from 
easter holiday.

If someone has noticed Dan has posted my PuzzleScrambler at his 
cubestation site (www.cubestation.co.uk) I have to let u all know 
that there is still a minor bug in it. There might be redundant 
moves in the repeating parts. But i'll fix it soon and i hope Dan 
will then post the corrected version. Anyway i'll post it to the 
file section of this group also in due time :-)

    I'd say there are actually three main methods: Fridrich method
(cross), Petrus method (which is not a corners first method) and
corners first.  All three methods are comparable in the number of
steps and required memorization.  I think that the Fridrich method is
best.  It is certainly the most popular among the top speedcubers and
there are plenty of websites describing all aspects of the method.

Ok, Gilles Roux's method might not be main(stream) (yet?) but is also 
very good and differs enough from the above that I'd like to add it...

    &gt; the keychain

&gt; Stefan

You are absolutely right. First I tried by all means to prove you 
wrong, because then the keychain cube problem would have had a sad 
end. But after that it became obvious that parity is a restriction.

That means that if you scramble a cube so that there is an even number 
of quarter turns which do not move the keychain corner, then the cube 
is keychain-solvable. Otherwise, not.

How long would an optimal solution be??

Hehe, no idea :-) I still haven't solved it completely even once. I 
have managed to solve F2L, though. I can intuitively solve a middle 
layer edge and then to insert the corner I repeat (R'FRF'U2)*5 until 
it's solved. This is of course very slow (it has length 25 and order 
9). And I haven't really put much effort into solving the last layer..
.

Question: Assuming Fridrich or Petrus method, should the keychain 
corner be in the last layer or not? What's better?

This has changed. Now I want to solve the last layer, too.

&gt; Question: Assuming Fridrich or Petrus method, should the keychain 
&gt; corner be in the last layer or not? What's better?

I think it should *not* be in the last layer, because this way we get 
rotations for free. Now I'm searching for nice short algs that only 
change the U layer and keep the F2L including the keychain corner 
intact. Here's one I found so far:

(R U2) (B' R B R2) (F' U F) (R U R')

Do you have more? I could of course combine it with 
inverse/rotation/mirror of itself in order to achieve only little 
effects. But that will result in very long algs (this way I once built 
an alg for a 4x4 parity problem using 250 moves which took me 5 
minutes to execute). I'd rather combine really different algs that 
compose more nicely. Do you (or anyone else?) have more algs like 
this?

Cheers!

WCA rules say things like:
"Competitors can use any normal 6 color sticker scheme for cubes, as
long as the cubes show 1 color per face in solved position."
"Puzzles may not have any textures or markings that distinguish one
piece from another."

With a logo on the white center piece. I see 2 possibilities for cheating:
- It helps you see centers faster.
- If the logo is asymetrical, maybe, it helps you count the number of
quarter turns of the white side...
(4x4x4?...)

I agree that it does not seem to be a big problem. But, can I put the
white sticker with the logo on another piece?
On one of my cube, it put it on a corner piece. It's cool, makes it
look different. But this way, I can identify this corner piece more
fficiently.
And if logos are allowed, may I put more than one? (if I find many
sponsors ;-) )

---&gt; No logo.
(but okay, we can tolerate one on a 3x3x3 center piece, because it
does not really matter and Mr Rubik would not be happy)

    Hrmm... I distinctly remember having to resticker my cube because the 
logo had worn off.  I was told that it was not necessary to resticker 
the entire cube, but the white center sticker had to be replaced with 
one that had the logo.  It was for this reason that there was a 
(almost endless) supply of stickers on the table when I walked in.  
This is what I was told when I first entered the science center, but 
it is possible that it was not enforced as much as it was supposed to 
be.  Does anybody else remember this?

Yes. Its structure is exactly like the 3x3. Just more of everything.

1. Take it apart.
2. Open the centers.
3. Replace the springs with softer ones with ends sanded flat

4. Lube it. Including inside the centers.

A fellow puzzler used his Dremel-clone to polish each piece with the

Oh, and...

http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/4419

The extra parity restriction is the only one, i.e. any position which 
can be solved normally by an even number of quarter turns can also be 
solved using the chain.

    Hi,

 

Far from it to continually plug my website :-S but I feel that I have
documented the Fridrich method of solving very comprehensively.

Since you are a "better-than-newbie" cuber, and are looking to improve your
method, you may find my cross page very helpful to start with.

 

www.cubestation.co.uk &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/&gt;  - click the "Solving
the Cross" link in the Orange panel on the left.

 

Good Luck :)

 

Dan :)

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Corner or cross?

 

Ok guys, I am an better-than-newbie at cubing right
now. I can solve the cube in about 2 mins but my
method is really very sloggy and it consumes a lot of
steps. So I was thinking of shifting to some another
method. I found that there are mainly two widespread
methods - the Lars Petrus's Corner method and the
cross method(I am not thinking about the Fridrich
method right now). So can you guys suggest which
method to use considering the documentation available
of the method and the number of steps achieved by each
method. 
Currently the Lars Petrus's method is on top of  my
list since it has some nice Java cubes alongwith the
explanation. I havent found such a site for the cross
method. 
Please reply!

    Hi,

I also have some tutorials available on my website. The method on my 
website does not require too much memorization, but it's good enough 
to solve the cube in less than 30 seconds (with a lot of practice, 
that is). You might want to take a look at that: 
www.solvethecube.co.uk.

Good luck,

Jo√´l.

    Hey!

Well then im one of those weird cubers :D I do centers last on the 
4x4x4 and 5x5x5. And as u can see from the unofficial world records 
im quite fast with it too ;-) The benefit of doing centers last (for 
me anyway) is that the rest of the solve speeds up. Doing the 
centers on the last 5 faces last is a bit slower than doing centers 
first. But at least by now the rest of the cube is solves and u have 
easier recognition. Easy recognition is the way to success on the 
larger cubes. many (including me) find that pairing up is too 
awkward since ur only ppoint of reference is one (or two) other edge
(s) only. The pairing up stage is what most ppl struggle to speed 
up. I know of good cubers who spend more time on the pairing-up 
stage than on one of my complete solves. So the normal 3x3x3 
reduction "regime" is not the salvation for everyone :-)

I would call my method the cage method. It's somewhat similar to 
columns first method.

First layer (top)
Middle layers edges (hold solved layer to the left)
Last layer corners then edges (and parity)
Final centers

Happy cubing !!

    Congratulations Per, your times with such a method are impressive!

My method is different, it looks a bit like my 3x3x3 technique:
- 1x3x4 block on a side
- 1x3x4 block on the opposite side
- U corners
- 12 remaining edges
- last 4 centers
I can't reach good times (about 1:50 on average), perhaps because I
rarely practice.

I would be interested in looking at a video of you solving the last
centers. In my case there are only 4 centers (not 5), but I need
almost 30 seconds on average. How long do you think it should take?

Gilles.

    Go to a dollar store, get two clones like

and rip out their springs. That's what I did with my current main

Is it a new Megaminx from Meffert? With very strong springs? Does it 
have plastic washers and how many?

    Hmmm ....

Centers on 4 faces. I reckon it should take maybe 20 secs or so. Do 
u cycle blocks of centers also? Or always just 3-cycling center 
cubies? U can cycle blocks similar to this :

&lt;r'(ud')r,U2&gt; - commutator

I think i already showed u some algs for opposite faces, like :

(r2 u2)*2

(r2 E2)*2 (on 5x5x5 cube)

There is more to commutators than meets the eye ... hehe ...

&lt;(r'l)d2(rl'),U&gt; (mostly on 4x4x4, 5 cycle)

Yes practice practice should help u alot of coz ;-)

Have fun!!

    &gt; any position which

Can we extend that to say this as well? ---&gt;

1) Pick any combination for the cube that requires an odd number of
quarter turns to solve.  Pick any of the 8 corners to be the keychain
corner.

2) Do one of the 6 allowable quarter turns using the keychain corner.

3) Now we have a position of even parity and thus the keychain corner
can be used to solve it.

If I am understanding this correctly, it should be possible to solve
any position using the keychain corner.  If any position with even
parity can be solved, then simply do a quarter turn if you have odd
parity and use your normal strategy for solving even positions.

That works for the permutations of the pieces, but can every position
in the cube orientation group be solved when any corner is the
keychain corner?  If that is true than any combination of the cube,
with any corner as the keychain corner is solvable.

WRONG! Hahaha ;-)

You made the same mistake I made first. Consider the scramble (L R) 
which is a clear counter-example. But Sebastian (and you yourself in 
the old thread) said it the right way: The restriction is to do an 
even number of quarter turns not including the keychain corner.

At least the old thread didn't show a solution. Now I have one. F2L is 
indeed not too hard so I'll only show LL.

Hold LL as U. Let the keychain be on DFR. This way the algs can be 
applied at any angle by doing a u-turn setup move. You'll likely have 
to use them several times and their inverses, too. The parentheses 
don't group finger tricks but group "steps". I provide 1 algorithm for 
each phase but for clarity it might be spread over several lines.

I'm particularly proud of the corner permutation alg since it nicely 
uses the "F2L slot change" technique (or however you call it) and gave 
me some new insights there.

-------------------
Orient Corners:

(R U2) (B' R B R2) (F' U F) (R U R')

-------------------
Orient Edges:

(R U2) (B' R B R2) (F' U F) (R U R')
D'
(L' U L) (F U F') (L2 B L B') (U2 L)
D

-------------------
Permute Corners:

(R U' B L) (U L' B' U R') (U' R B U' B' U R')

-------------------
Permute Edges:

(R U' B L) (U L' B' U R') (U' R B U' B' U R')
(F' U L' B') (U' B L U' F) (U F' L' U L U' F)

I know all these sequences and commutators.
Yes, practice is the key, that's why I was asking for a video of
someone who practiced a lot, to see what it looks like ;-) 

Usually, I separate center pieces and move them to their final side,
or to the opposite side. And when it's possible, I try to build 1x1x2
blocks, because finishing with (u2r2)^2 is much faster.

But sequences like (ur2u'r2) that can change 4 sides at a time thanks
to a *very* simple move look interesting...

&gt; &gt; - 1x3x4 block on a side

&gt; &gt; - U corners

    Oops!

I should of course have said something like this:
Any even permutation with the keychain corner in its correct location 
can be solved.
If the keychain corner is not at its home location, you have to add 
the number of quarter turns it takes to get it to its home to the 
number of quarter turns it took to mix.

It's just like the old 15 sliding tile puzzle. Any even permutation 
is possible amongst the tiles, even though you can swap the space 
with any adjacent tile (which seems to be an odd permutation).

Allowing a choice of corner to which you attach the chain after you 
have seen the scramble, will no necessarily make it solvable. If all 
corners are correct apart form two diagonally swap ones, then it will 
not be solvable whatever corner you chain up.

    Here's a keychain alg that flips three corners.  If we can prove that
you can make any setup moves necessary, this should be sufficient to
prove that any position for the corner orientation group can be solved.

(R U' R' F' U' F)x15  key chain corner: DFR

It's 90 moves long, but it flips FUL, BUL, BUR all clockwise leaving
everything else untouched.

Also, here is an algorithm that flips two edges and leaves everything
else untouched.

(R U' B U')x70  key chain corner: DFR

It is 280 moves but it does what we need it to do.

Again if we can prove that any setup move is possible for getting the
 two necessary edges to flip then we can show that any position in the
edge orientation group can be solved.

Now that we know of useful flip algs, maybe the setup moves part won't
be so hard (I hope).

&gt; If I am understanding this correctly, it should be possible to solve
&gt; any position using the keychain corner.  If any position with even
&gt; parity can be solved, then simply do a quarter turn if you have odd
&gt; parity and use your normal strategy for solving even positions.
&gt; 
&gt; That works for the permutations of the pieces, but can every position
&gt; in the cube orientation group be solved when any corner is the
&gt; keychain corner?  If that is true than any combination of the cube,
&gt; with any corner as the keychain corner is solvable.

Mmh... what do you mean with "diagonally"? I first thought you meant 
diagonally across the cube, in which case I simply chain up one of the 
two swapped corners and then I *can* solve it. It does work though if 
you mean diagonally across one face. Proof of both claims is left as 
exercise to Chris ;-)

I'd suggest the (L R) scramble, I think it's even easier to prove 
being impossible to solve: As soon as you place your chain, you can 
undo one of L or R but the other screws you.

Just two edges? Are you sure? I haven't tried it physically but here:
http://thearufam.brinkster.net/cube/wrapplet.asp
(enter "(R U' B U' F2)*42", i.e. with '*')

Btw, how do you come up with these algs? I guess you don't make up a

    Hey!

I been reading all this keychain cube solving with some interest. 
What i understand is that one always has to move the layer that 
contains the corner with the chain attached. That's the only 
constraint, right ?

While i was on easter holiday i thought of a similar problem. Im not 
sure whether it's much tougher or not. Let's imagine that only 
clockwise turns of faces are allowed. Ie we disallow any double turn 
or counterclockwise turn. When we have moved one face 1 step 
clockwise we have to move another face clockwise. And so on ... How 
hard is it to solve like this? Is every state of the cube still 
possible?

Jaap, u have any idea about this? 

Anyone who can come up with some nice flipping and/or twisting 
algorithms? What is devillish is of course that even if we come up 
with this. Setup moves won't work. Cause the "un-setup" moves will 
not be possible (would necessarily have had to be counterclockwise 
turns).

Hmmm ...

Have fun figure this one out :-)

    Yeah my second alg doesn't work either, I just double checked it an I
messed it up.

My idea for the edges is to form an edge cycle such that two pieces
swap and one gets flipped.  Then I check to make sure I can solve
everything else in a number that is congruent to 2 (mod 4).  Thus
flipping the edges.

The move R U' B U' swaps UL and UR and flips one of the edges.  THe
last move F2 returns the keychain corner, the largest edge cycle then
solves in 12, thus always congruent to 0 (mod 4).

I'm still working on finding one that works, but that is my strategy.

lol no I didn't just apply useful moves over an over, I have somewhat
of a system to the madness :)

One step ahead of you :)

(DR)*35 RU'R' (F D' F' R' D' R)*15 RUR'
key-chain corner: DFR

I found (DR)x35 which flips 6 corners in the 2-generator case earlier
when working on a 3 corner flipper, and I just used my non-keychain
corner flipper to flix 3 of them.

166 moves, but it proves it is possible.

    Even if the rules are,

1) You may only do a single clockwise quarter turn when turing a face
2) After turning a face you may only turn one of its 4 adjacent faces.

You could do U (RBLF)*315 U to still get everything.

&gt; &gt; Hey!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I been reading all this keychain cube solving with some interest. 
&gt; &gt; What i understand is that one always has to move the layer that

&gt; &gt; constraint, right ?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; While i was on easter holiday i thought of a similar problem. Im not 
&gt; &gt; sure whether it's much tougher or not. Let's imagine that only 
&gt; &gt; clockwise turns of faces are allowed. Ie we disallow any double turn 
&gt; &gt; or counterclockwise turn. When we have moved one face 1 step 
&gt; &gt; clockwise we have to move another face clockwise. And so on ... How 
&gt; &gt; hard is it to solve like this? Is every state of the cube still 
&gt; &gt; possible?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Jaap, u have any idea about this? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyone who can come up with some nice flipping and/or twisting 
&gt; &gt; algorithms? What is devillish is of course that even if we come up 
&gt; &gt; with this. Setup moves won't work. Cause the "un-setup" moves will 
&gt; &gt; not be possible (would necessarily have had to be counterclockwise 
&gt; &gt; turns).

    Wow, this is harder.  We've already proven that solving is possible so
the strategy is a bit different.

I found 
(RBLF)x105 to flip three corners, DLF, DBL, DBR all counter-clockwise.

I had already studied the cycles for RBLF for the keychain problem so
that one was easy.

That's probably a terrible strategy, I think a fewest moves strategy
would work better.  I think 3 cycles of pieces would be more useful
for this type of solving.  I don't have any right now, but I want to
think about that.

I wonder what the upper limit of moves is for an efficient method of
this type.

    True, and since we both had the goal of proving that it was solvable I
think you beat me pretty soundly :-P

Chris

P.S.  For the method for the edge flippers the "getting the other
stuff to solve in some number congruent to 2 mod 4 is the trial and
error part, so it isn't even that efficient.  I suppose with more
thought you could find a setup move that does this, but then again
maybe following the corner cycles (with orientations) would be hard to
do intuitively.

    I suggest going with my addition to the rules of,

 2) after turning any face you may only turn one of its four adjacent
faces.

To do U2 when trying to solve with a shorter efficient approach it
doesn't take much time to do U (FB)x4 U, and in fact that is probably
how I would do it and use my usual speed solve approach.  As long as
you use other shortcuts to avoid doing counter-clockwise turns when
possible during the F2L it isn't that inefficient.  The LL would be a
different story.  Perhaps we should just analyze the LL if we allow
turning of opposite faces.

It's a lot harder though in general if you can only do adjacent face
turns, since your shortest option is the (RU)x105 for the same trick
as Stefan said.

Well, the shortest we know until now ;-) I'm sure there must be a much 
shorter one.

And here's my first alg for this version that I'm a little proud of:
(RFU LBU)*15

It flips two edges in 90 moves. Per, maybe you'll not only like it 
because it's much shorter than what we've had before, but also because 
I constructed it thinking about commutators :-) The idea was to 
combine two relatively independent sequences (RF and LB). Of course I 
had to insert something in between to connect them, so I chose U.

Hmm, wait a moment. What if I simply combine R and L that way? Yes,
(RULU)*45 is identity! The record is thus 180 moves now ;-)

And if I try to combine L and R not always with U but instead with the 
same face relative to the R center? Results in a 4-edge flipper in 
just 36 moves: (RL U RL B RL D RL F)*3

    &gt; At least the old thread didn't show a solution. Now I have one. 
&gt;F2L is 
&gt; indeed not too hard so I'll only show LL.
&gt; 
&gt; Hold LL as U. Let the keychain be on DFR. This way the algs can be 
&gt; applied at any angle by doing a u-turn setup move. You'll likely 
&gt;have 
&gt; to use them several times and their inverses, too. The parentheses 
&gt; don't group finger tricks but group "steps". I provide 1 algorithm 
&gt;for 
&gt; each phase but for clarity it might be spread over several lines.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm particularly proud of the corner permutation alg since it 
nicely 
&gt; uses the "F2L slot change" technique (or however you call it) and 
gave 
&gt; me some new insights there.
&gt; 
&gt; -------------------
&gt; Orient Corners:
&gt; 
&gt; (R U2) (B' R B R2) (F' U F) (R U R')
&gt; 
&gt; -------------------
&gt; Orient Edges:
&gt; 
&gt; (R U2) (B' R B R2) (F' U F) (R U R')
&gt; D'
&gt; (L' U L) (F U F') (L2 B L B') (U2 L)
&gt; D
&gt; 
&gt; -------------------
&gt; Permute Corners:
&gt; 
&gt; (R U' B L) (U L' B' U R') (U' R B U' B' U R')
&gt; 
&gt; -------------------
&gt; Permute Edges:
&gt; 
&gt; (R U' B L) (U L' B' U R') (U' R B U' B' U R')
&gt; (F' U L' B') (U' B L U' F) (U F' L' U L U' F)
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers!

Nice... You indeed solved the problem. Now to find all the 1211 
optimal LL algorithms :)

The keychain-corner-in-F2L idea is very good, and I think that the 
best place for the keychain corner is in the last F2L slot, that is, 
last solved piece before LL. I have only solved with the keychain 
corner in LL because I use fixed colours and it happenned that it 
was in LL.

Hey, but that means that the same position will need more than one 
alg, because the position of the keychain corner matters. Anyway, 
let me show what I got by myself. Here's my first PLL (keychain 
corner UFR i.e. in the last layer):

(F' U' F R) (F' U' F R) U' (B U B' R') U (R' F' U F)

18 moves: it's longer than Stefan's. The edge 3-cycle was this alg 
applied twice. Exactly like Stefan has it. The 9-move alg

(F' U' F R) U' (B U B' R')

could be used for the orient corners part, since edges are solved 
afterwards. Nothing else for now.

    A few months ago, I was about where you are.  I opted to try to 
learn the Fridrich method first since it's so widely used, but I 
plan on learning Petrus and a corners first method eventually [and 
now maybe the Gilles method, though not sure I even know what that 
is].  And I still use some moves from my old method.

With my old method, my times were about 1.5 - 2.5 minutes.  When I 
started to learn Fridrich on my own, I was able to drop to about a 
minute rather quickly [couple of weeks practice].  Switching to 
cross first and doing it on the bottom was the first major 
adjustment [my old method did the top corners first, then the top 
edges].  then learing how to insert the corner/edge pairs was the 
second big adjustment for me, and I still don't know all of those 
[old method was get top layer all done, then insert each middle 
layer edge].  last big adjustmetn I made was to learn some of the 
PLL algs.  With that, I was at a minute to 1:15 within a couple of 
weeks.

I've only this week learned the final 4 of the PLL algs, and I still 
know only 3 OLL algs [the ones from my old method], and my times 
have steadily dropped.  My best is now 38.9, and I consistently get 
in the 40s and 50s.  

I got to the minute mark mostly by studying/practicing the sequences 
I printed off various sites.  I didn't look at too many videos at 
first because I wanted to try the moves on my own.  Later, I studied 
lots of videos to watch hand technique, and that really helped.  
There are lots of good sites out there [Dan plugged his, and 
frankly, it was indeed extremely helpful].  Finally, getting 
together with a couple of cubers who are much faster than me helped 
with the last 15-20 seconds of progress.

anyway, that's my story.  hope it's helpful.

    Obviously I needed a little break.

&gt; Hmm, wait a moment. What if I simply combine R and L that way? Yes,
&gt; (RULU)*45 is identity! The record is thus 180 moves now ;-)

Not at all better than 2*90 (twice my 2-edge-flip).

&gt; Results in a 4-edge flipper in 
&gt; just 36 moves: (RL U RL B RL D RL F)*3

Not even allowed.

But here's a nice one orienting 3 corners in 60 moves:
(RULU)*15

To find my above identity (*45) I had started with *1 and looked at 
the cycle of the UFR corner. It had length 3, so I tried *3 next. Of 
course UFR was now at the correct place but it was oriented wrong. So 
I added another factor 3 and tried *9. Then I saw there was a 5-corner 
cycle left so I added factor 5 and tried *45 which resulted in 
identity. So I tried only *1, *3, *9 and *45 and missed *15 which is 
very nice...

What can I learn from this? Find the order (*45) and then try to take 
out any one prime factor. If it still looks interesting, continue. If 
I take 5 out of 45 and try *9 then both edges and corners look ugly. 
So that's bad and I stop. If instead I take 3 out of 45 and try *15 
then that looks nice. I continue by taking out another 3 and try 5:
(RULU)*5
Bingo, another nice one! It leaves all edges intact.

Sadly it permutes/orients all 8 corners, though. But wait! Actually 
only 3 corners are permuted, the other 5 are just oriented. And all in 
the same direction! Which means I should try a rotation and do it 
twice. There are four possibilities:
(RULU)*5 (RULU)*10 - orients 3, permutes 0
(RULU)*5 (FUBU)*10 - orients 4, permutes 3
(RULU)*5 (LURU)*10 - orients 3, permutes 4
(RULU)*5 (BUFU)*10 - orients 2, permutes 3

This is fun now :-)

I also tried rotating the alg around x (i.e. with RULU, RBLB, RDLD and 
RFRF as second part) but that leads to larger effects.

Cheers!

Hello all,

This will probably be my only post ever on your board.

I know Sandy Becker personally and we were having a conversation about
subcultures when this message board came up. Sandy is one of the
nicest, most considerate, honest, and genuine people that I've ever
had the pleasure of knowing. Thus, I was a bit surprised to hear that
people on here were being so critical.

The response to her article is, in my opinion, unwarranted and a bit
narrow. The article appeard in a publication that highlights activity
and people at the University of Michigan. It was not intended to be of
interest to the "hardcore speedcubing" community. The facts that are
important in this article are those facts that relate to Sandy Becker,
her employment at U of M, her academic background, and her interests,
not, as some people seem to think, "speedcubing". 

Further, the article was not written because Sandy solves the cube in
two minutes, frankly, she even points out in the article that her
speed is quite slow relative to others. Rather, the article was
written because Sandy is an employee of the University of Michigan who
wrote her Master's Thesis on Group Theory of the Rubix Cube.

Perhaps the number of people who can solve the cube in a few minutes
is quite large. Certainly at the time I write this it is at least 750
people based on the unnoficial lists. However, the number of people
who can solve it in a few minutes, who have written a graduate thesis
on the mathematics of the cube, who also work at the University of
Michigan, and who haven't already been spotlighted in the university's
magazine is substantially smaller. I might be wrong, but I suspect
that number was one, and is now zero.

Sandy's reported time came from her one officially timed event. The
video was part of the annual pi day celebration, so, in a sense, it
was just for fun. Sandy's interest lies in mathematics and group
theory, and in particular, symmetries and permutation groups. I'm
quite sure she'd be interested in discussing such topics whith those
of you who have a similar background. Her contact information is
readily available from the University's web site. So "tracking her
down", is quite unnecesary.

    I picked up a cube for the first serious time last May and have been thoroughly hooked since.  My initial method was similar to Kirk's in that it involved the first layer on top, corners before edges, then inserted each middle layer edge afterward.  I've since upgraded to cross on bottom, followed by the corner/edge pairs (which I've learned how to do on my own).  I use a 4 look last layer with a little bit of partial edge control, several special cases, and a few extra tricks.  With this method I am able to average around 35 seconds with my best times hovering a tad under 24 seconds.

A few weeks ago, I decided to try my hand at the Roux method.  It requires fewer moves, on average, so, theoretically, I have the potential to be faster with it.  Using his system with two 1x2x3 blocks and minimal step 3 and 4 algorithms, I am able to average consistently under 39 seconds, with a pair of best times fractions of a second slower than my best fridrich times.  I'm incredibly pleased with my progress, despite minimal learning.  I use this new method exclusively in practice now, and hope to have my times greatly improved by the summer when I'm able to attend another competition.  I've decided to commit to learning more algorithms for the last layer corners and some of the 26 special cases for the last layer over the next few weeks.

Basically, toying around with other methods is a fantastic way to improve your times, even if you stick with your old method.  They can be invaluable for providing you with easy to recognize special cases you would otherwise never have learned.  Also, meeting with other cubers is immensely helpful.  They can teach you things you thought previously impossible to understand.  I hope I've helped.

Happy cubing,

&gt; 

I had to go back nearly three months to January 1st to find the 
original post referred to in this one!

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; This will probably be my only post ever on your board.
&gt; 
&gt; I know Sandy Becker personally and we were having a conversation 
about
&gt; subcultures when this message board came up. Sandy is one of the

Becker,
&gt; her employment at U of M, her academic background, and her 
interests,
&gt; not, as some people seem to think, "speedcubing". 

I don't recall anything negative directed specifically at her.  From 
what I can see, there were three responses to the article.  The 
first was about the title of the article, and the other two were 
criticizing the accuracy of the article with reference to the 
official record and winner of the WC2003.

&gt; 
&gt; Further, the article was not written because Sandy solves the cube 
in
&gt; two minutes, frankly, she even points out in the article that her
&gt; speed is quite slow relative to others.

I will quote the article:

"Becker is no ordinary player. She was pretty quick two decades ago, 
but now she's lightning fast. Her personal best time for solving the 
cube is 2 minutes and 46 seconds, no easy feat when you consider 
that the cube has 43 quintillion permutations."

I don't even consider myself to be "lightning fast" with a personal 
best of 20.12...

&gt; Rather, the article was
&gt; written because Sandy is an employee of the University of Michigan 
who
&gt; wrote her Master's Thesis on Group Theory of the Rubix Cube.
&gt; 

I don't think there is such thing as a "Rubix Cube."  In fact, I 
think that Mr. Rubik would find this remark more offensive than any 
of the responses to the article were. :P

&gt; Perhaps the number of people who can solve the cube in a few 
minutes
&gt; is quite large.  Certainly at the time I write this it is at least 
750
&gt; people based on the unnoficial lists.

Plus the countless more that aren't even on the lists! :)

&gt; However, the number of people
&gt; who can solve it in a few minutes, who have written a graduate 
thesis
&gt; on the mathematics of the cube, who also work at the University of
&gt; Michigan, and who haven't already been spotlighted in the 
university's
&gt; magazine is substantially smaller. I might be wrong, but I suspect
&gt; that number was one, and is now zero.
&gt; 

I would agree that this is probably correct.

&gt; Sandy's reported time came from her one officially timed event. The
&gt; video was part of the annual pi day celebration, so, in a sense, it
&gt; was just for fun. Sandy's interest lies in mathematics and group
&gt; theory, and in particular, symmetries and permutation groups. I'm
&gt; quite sure she'd be interested in discussing such topics whith 
those
&gt; of you who have a similar background. Her contact information is
&gt; readily available from the University's web site. So "tracking her
&gt; down", is quite unnecesary.
&gt; 

I feel that you may have looked into the responses waaay too much.  
I don't think that anybody meant anything offensive toward Sandy and 
I'm sure she's a very nice person.  I doubt anybody in the cubing 
community has anything personally against her.  I don't think 
anybody actually intended on "tracking her down."

The article is about her, not speedcubing, and as quoted above is
called "complete rubbish", and suggests that she needs "lessons".

You aren't the intended reader, Sandy did not write the article. Thus,
your criticism is unfounded. Who really cares how fast you are, or
what your definition of "lightning fast" is. It is an non-specific
relative measure of time in this context. To interpret it literally is
nonsense. Anything less than five minutes in comparison to people who
aren't "cubers", would most likely be considered lightning fast. 

&gt; I don't think anybody actually intended on "tracking her down."

Well, then if something isn't intended, don't say it. However, my
point was that it's not like this is some big mystery. She's easy to
contact if you have questions or comments.

    Hello speedcubing friends,

This is just a proposal, to see if anyone agrees with me. Most 
conversations between speedcubers are probably done online. That's 
why a discussion group or forum is very valueable for the 
speedcubing community. However, I must say, I don't really enjoy 
posting on this yahoo group. It's not very organized, the replies on 
one specific topic are hard to find, there are too many ads etc. I 
also heard another cuber say he would post more if there was a 
better forum. I think I would also have a lot more fun posting on a 
speedcubing forum if we just had a good looking, organized forum. 
For an example, take a look at this forum: 
http://www.phpbb.com/styles/demo.php.

As an example of what I have in mind, I have been fooling around 
with this free forum today: http://speedcubing.proboards20.com/.

DON'T get me wrong! I don't want everybody to agree with me, of 
course. If you really like this yahoo group, that's fine with me... 
I am just interested in your opinion! Am I the only one used to nice 
forums? :)

I am also not saying that the example I made is perfect, but it's 
just an example.

Happy cubing,

Jo√´l.

I totally agree with you, a forum based on PHPBB (for example) is
3x3x3 times better than these Yahoo groups (even worse to read since
they changed the layout).
Categories are more than useful. Fingertricks, blindfold techniques,
F2L, corners-first, ..., and "general chat" for messages with a short
lifespan.
Three things are needed. A stable webserver, moderators mature enough
and a willing community.
Hey! Just add a "Forum" area to speedcubing.com's menus! ;-)

    I agree with you too.

Previously, this was the only forum I followed, so I didn't know what
the other options were. Then I became interested in iPAQs and so
started occasionally reading the Pocket PC Thoughts forum
(http://www.pocketpcthoughts.com/forums/index.php) and saw how .php
discussion forums were organised.

I am very happy to go with the majority view on this issue, however,
since we are expressing preferences here... I do prefer the .php style
discussion forums and would be happy to move to one. :)

    I think that a forum is a great idea. 

The Swedish cubers have a quite active forum at the site of SweCube 
(the Swedish Cube Association) &lt;www.svekub.se&gt;. Earlier we had a 
yahoo group (rubikskub) but since we started the forum, the yahoo 
group has been deserted. One good thing with our forum is that it is 
connected to our website, and thereby a bit easier for a newcomber 
to find compared to an yahoo e-mail list.

I'm mainly lurking here. Personally, I would probably be more active 
on a forum.

Enjoy,

    Hi Chris,

It seems to me that you take way too many moves.

I approach grip as something I can see coming so that I can do any
facing at pretty much the same speed.

You may already know these, but I find them very quick.

(Q means rotate the whole cube and lower case letters move just the
slice) 
One in three out:
F2 U r U2 r' U F2 and it's reverse F2 U' r U2 r' U' F2
Z pattern (swap edge pairs adjacent)
r2 D b2 D' b r2 b' and it's reverse r2 D' b2 D b r2 b'
Cross pattern (Swap edge pairs across)
r2 U r2 U2 r2 U r2
If I want I can do (R' L' D2 R L U) 2 :)

Happy cubing!

&gt; Hey everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I know I've mentioned that I am working on ZBF2L, and I've recently
&gt; made an improvement to my PLL because of it that I wanted to share.
&gt; 
&gt; Since ZBF2L is followed by COLL, 2/3 of your solves end up in a 3
&gt; cycle of edges.  Also, 1/6 of your solves end up in the zig zag
&gt; pattern.  Since these come up _so_ often I have revised me way of
&gt; executing these algs.
&gt; 
&gt; I now use what I consider 12 algs for the edge 3-cycle (including
&gt; reflections) and what I consider 6 algs for the zig-zag patter also
&gt; including reflections.  I also use my alg for the plus permutation
&gt; where opposite pairs of edges swap in addition to its reflection, so
&gt; what I consider to be two algs.
&gt; 
&gt; I want to soon work on my permutations page to include all the algs I
&gt; use now as well as finger tricks, but since that may take a while I
&gt; wanted to post about these new algs here.
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously this approach is good (IMHO) for people who orient the edges
&gt; of their LL, then do COLL and then do the edge PLL.  However, even if
&gt; you are just using OLL and PLL, these algs make the edge cycle
&gt; permutations very, very fast.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are all the algs I use for all the edge permutations, in addition
&gt; to how I view them.  What is most important here is which hand is
&gt; gripping the cube after finishing the alg just before PLL.  So I not
&gt; only pay attention to what case it is, but which hand is gripping the
&gt; cube.
&gt; 
&gt; ---------------
&gt; 
&gt; Edge 3-cycles:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Right hand is gripping the cube
&gt; 
&gt;  a) the solved edge is on the F face
&gt;   - edges go clockwise: ((L')2 U) (L U L' U') (L' U') (L' U L')
&gt;   - edges go counter-clockwise: (L U' L) (U) (L U) (L U') (L' U' L2)
&gt; 
&gt;  b) the solved edge is on the back face
&gt;   - edges go clockwise: (L' U L') (U') (L' U') (L' U) (L U L2)
&gt;   - edges go counter-clockwise: ((L)2 U' L') (U' L U) (L U) (L U' L)
&gt; 
&gt;  c) the solved edge is on the right face
&gt;   - egdge go clockwise: (L' U2 L') (U') (L' U' (L)2) (U) (L U L2)
&gt;   - edges go counter-clockwise: ((L)2 U') (L' U' (L)2) (U) (L U) (L
U2 L)
&gt; 
&gt;  d) the solved edge is on the left face
&gt;   - regrip the cube with the left hand and do 2d)
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Left hand is gripping the cube
&gt; 
&gt;  a) the solved edge is on the F face
&gt;   - edges go clockwise: (R' U R') (U') (R' U') (R' U) (R U (R')2)
&gt;   - edges go counter-clockwise: ((R)2 U') (R' U' R) (U) (R U) (R U' R)
&gt; 
&gt;  b) the solved edge is on the back face
&gt;   - edges go clockwise: ((R')2 U R) (U R' U') (R' U') (R' U R')
&gt;   - edges go counter-clockwise: (R U' R) (U) (R U) (R U') (R' U' (R)2)
&gt; 
&gt;  c) the solved edge is on the right face
&gt;   - regrip the cube with the right hand and do 1c)
&gt; 
&gt;  d) the solved edge is on the left face
&gt;   - edges go clockwise: ((R')2 U) (R U (R')2) (U') (R' U') (R' U2 R')
&gt;   - edge go counter-clockwise: (R U2 R) (U) (R U (R')2) (U') (R' U'
(R)2)
&gt; 
&gt; I consider each of these a separate case and as you can see the only
&gt; time you ever have to regrip the cube is for 1d and 2c.  This is a
&gt; fast regrip since it only goes from right to left or vice versa and
&gt; there is no cube rotation.
&gt; 
&gt; As you can see I only really use 2 algorithms, but I do the inverse of
&gt; one of them as well as the inverse and rotation of one of the others.
&gt;  It helps to think of them as really 12 different cases though instead
&gt; of 2 algs applied 12 different ways.
&gt; 
&gt; --------
&gt; 
&gt; I also use 6 algs for the zig-zag case.  It really is only one
&gt; algorithm, similar to the above.  However, when you view it as 6
&gt; different cases the solves always go quickly and you don't have to
&gt; think about which way to turn the U layer when you're done.
&gt; 
&gt; If you would like an explanation of the cube rotation notation I'm
&gt; using see http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/3-orientations.html and
&gt; read the info at the top.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Algs done right handed:
&gt;  a) x' (R U') (R' U) [(D R' D) (U')] (R' U R) z' x' (l2 U)
&gt;   - without finger trick notation this alg is R B' R' B F R' F B' R' B
&gt; R F2 U
&gt;  b) x' (R U') (R' U) [(D R' D) (U')] (R' U R) z' x' (l2 U')
&gt;   - without finger trick notation this alg is R B' R' B F R' F B' R' B
&gt; R F2 U'
&gt;  c) x' (R U') (R' U) [(D R' D) (U')] (R' U R) z' x' (l2)
&gt;   - without finger trick notation this alg is R B' R' B F R' F B' R' B
&gt; R F2
&gt; 
&gt; Do the inverse of each alg to get to the situation.  As you can see
&gt; the only thing that changes is the U turn at the end.  It either goes
&gt; one way or the other, or isn't there at all.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Algs done left handed:
&gt;  a) x' (L' U) (L U') [(D' L D') (U)] (L U' L') z x' (r2 U')
&gt;   - without finger trick notation this alg is L' B L B' F' L F' B L B'
&gt; L' F2 U'
&gt;  b) x' (L' U) (L U') [(D' L D') (U)] (L U' L') z x' (r2 U)
&gt;   - without finger trick notation this alg is L' B L B' F' L F' B L B'
&gt; L' F2 U
&gt;  c) x' (L' U) (L U') [(D' L D') (U)] (L U' L') z x' (r2)
&gt;   - without finger trick notation this alg is L' B L B' F' L F' B L B'
&gt; L' F2
&gt;  
&gt; Again this is always the same alg with a different U move at the end,
&gt; or even no U move.  It is better to view this as 6 different cases
&gt; than to think of which way the U face is turned when solving.
&gt; 
&gt; -----------
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly the edge perm where both pairs of opposite centers switch.  I
&gt; use the same alg for each case, but I would do either the alg or its
&gt; reflections depending on the last face turned and which hand is
&gt; gripping the cube before I start.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) right hand is gripping the cube
&gt;  a) L' (R' U2 R) L y' R (L U2 L') R'
&gt; 
&gt; 2) left hand is gripping the cube
&gt;  b) R (L U2 L') R' y L' (R' U2 R) L
&gt; 
&gt; ------------
&gt; 
&gt; Especially for when you always end with one of these permutations I
&gt; find it is better to expand to using more algs than to rotate the cube
&gt; and/or the U layer to get it to an angle that you know.
&gt; 
&gt; I think this would also be helpful for a 2,3, or 4 look approach.  You
&gt; have to work more to learn lots of cases where previously there were
&gt; only two, but you can almost always do the edge permutations from the
&gt; angle you encounter them.  You will have to rotate the cube and/or
&gt; regrip sometimes using these algs, but much less often than normal.
&gt; 
&gt; Again I find this helpful for VH solving, but I think it would apply
&gt; to solving in general which is why I posted.  Obviously I think this
&gt; approach is very worthwhile for those using some sort of ZBF2L style
&gt; solving and always (or often) ending with an edge permutation.

    Before the layout change this forum was ok, but now i find it very 
hard to read with the new colors, the previews of the messages in the

    Hi Per, Gilles, et al,

   I also do centers last. I think that there's much greater freedom
of movement, and if you learn to spot it you can solve parity with a
single half turn.

I do:
1 Eight corners  
2 two opposing centers "middle level" 

At this point there is a center column of 4 centers all the way around
the cube and the top and bottom levels may be rotated at will, so
there is lots of flexibility. 

The front and back sides may be rotated followed by center moves, and
rotated back to place the first.

3 all four "middle level" edge pairs

You lose the front and back turns but that's no handicap.

4 two FL edge pairs (on the already-solved centers) 

Now all the changes happen using the top level and the four unsolved
centers. 

5 two LL edge pairs (on the already-solved centers)

At this point you have the left and right side solved, and the
remaining edges can be lined up easily. 

6 pair up the remaining edges 
This is really easy, and it only takes a moment to see if you need to 

6a solve parity 

Done now this only takes one move. You will need to pair up the
remaining edges again without undoing parity. 

Two sets of algs can be used if you spot whether you need to solve
parity or not after step 5.

8 place the four remaining edge pairs 
9 fix the four remaining centers  

I hope my description makes sense.

Regards,

David J

&gt; 
&gt; Well then im one of those weird cubers :D I do centers last on the 
&gt; 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. And as u can see from the unofficial world records 
&gt; im quite fast with it too ;-) The benefit of doing centers last (for 
&gt; me anyway) is that the rest of the solve speeds up. Doing the 
&gt; centers on the last 5 faces last is a bit slower than doing centers 
&gt; first. But at least by now the rest of the cube is solves and u have 
&gt; easier recognition. Easy recognition is the way to success on the 
&gt; larger cubes. many (including me) find that pairing up is too 
&gt; awkward since ur only ppoint of reference is one (or two) other edge
&gt; (s) only. The pairing up stage is what most ppl struggle to speed 
&gt; up. I know of good cubers who spend more time on the pairing-up 
&gt; stage than on one of my complete solves. So the normal 3x3x3 
&gt; reduction "regime" is not the salvation for everyone :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I would call my method the cage method. It's somewhat similar to 
&gt; columns first method.
&gt; 
&gt; First layer (top)
&gt; Middle layers edges (hold solved layer to the left)
&gt; Last layer corners then edges (and parity)
&gt; Final centers

&gt; Happy cubing !!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't produce true general cubes where the orientations of 
&gt; the

&gt; &gt; on it,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so in competitions your cube is only solved 1/4 the time, yet 
&gt; we 
&gt; &gt; still
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consider it solved.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So we've all been frequently (75% of the time actually) 
&gt; counting 
&gt; &gt; cubes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as solved that never were in fact solved.  There has been 
&gt; rampant
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cheating in the cubing community for almost 2 years :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps we should memorize which way the design of the white 
&gt; &gt; sticker
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is oriented when we buy our cubes to make sure we don't cheat 
&gt; &gt; and just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; half solve it :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; This is just a proposal, to see if anyone agrees with me. Most 
&gt; conversations between speedcubers are probably done online. That's 
&gt; why a discussion group or forum is very valueable for the 
&gt; speedcubing community. However, I must say, I don't really enjoy 
&gt; posting on this yahoo group. It's not very organized, the replies 
on 
&gt; one specific topic are hard to find, there are too many ads etc. I 
&gt; also heard another cuber say he would post more if there was a 
&gt; better forum. I think I would also have a lot more fun posting on 
a 
&gt; speedcubing forum if we just had a good looking, organized forum. 
&gt; For an example, take a look at this forum: 
&gt; http://www.phpbb.com/styles/demo.php.
&gt; 
&gt; As an example of what I have in mind, I have been fooling around 
&gt; with this free forum today: http://speedcubing.proboards20.com/.
&gt; 
&gt; DON'T get me wrong! I don't want everybody to agree with me, of 
&gt; course. If you really like this yahoo group, that's fine with 
me... 
&gt; I am just interested in your opinion! Am I the only one used to 
nice 
&gt; forums? :)
&gt; 
&gt; I am also not saying that the example I made is perfect, but it's 
&gt; just an example.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy cubing,
&gt; 
&gt; Jo√´l.




I am new here, so I can't say I am attached to this current medium 
in the least. However, I am much more familiar with the message 
board approach than this style presented here at Yahoo.  I like 
things to be neatly organized.   My only suggestion for a new board 
would be to keep the white background (like it is here on Yahoo). It 
is so much easier to read, especially when reading a long post about 
something with great detail.

But the added abilities you get in the message board environment, 
like the one you presented, are very advantageous.  Plus, I wouldn't 
have to quote the entire message when I replied!!  *looks up at the 
top of the screen*

If you need any assistance, I am a software developer, so I may be 
able to point you in the right direction. PHP is not my specialty, 
but coding is coding, the only major differences are syntax.

Hey Joel, you should've used this one as an example:
http://www.twistypuzzles.com/forum/

I must admit I feel a little scared thinking about leaving the yahoo 
group. I got used to it and have no problem with it (other than people 
who quote quoted quotes for no reason ;-). A new board should also be 
trustworthy and to be honest I don't trust free webspace. I've already 
had trouble with webspace that was only cheap. Ok ok, I know, yahoo is 
free, too. But still... it's a large company and it's one system 
managed by one source and I'd assume they have professionals running 
it and maybe backups and whatever.

I do like (and use) the above TwistyPuzzles forum a lot, though. It's 
not like I'm generally against that type of forum.

Cheers!

    Hi Stefan,

That's a very good example!! :)

I also don't exactly 'trust' free webspace, but I think the webspace 
provided by my university for example is pretty reliable.. I also 
use it for my website, and I have only seen it offline once, so far. 
I am not sure yet if it's possible (or allowed) to get a forum 
running there, though.. I am working on that right now..

And yes, I know you can get used to this yahoo group when you're 
using it 24/7 ;).

    I generally like participating in groups like this through e-mail.  I
currently have all of the Yahoo messages forwarded over to a Gmail
account, and it is very easy to use.  It is simple to view all new
messages across all topics grouped by thread.

One of the e-mail lists that I'm on (work related) has recently moved
to PHPBB.  I don't like it.  They don't allow me to receive the entire
messages via e-mail.  Trying to look at new messages means I need to
click through lots of different forums rather than looking at a list
of message subjects for the entire board.

If the new forum can deal with these issues, then I wouldn't mind
moving.  But I'm pretty happy with the group as it is now.

    I think this is a great idea, for example, i usually just scroll 
through all the messages one at a time, and skip the ones i don't 
want to read.  For example, there are times when people talk about 
like...group theory or things that are beyond my comprehension, it 
would make for a more organized experience.  I think the idea of a 
newbie area would be a good idea.  If you look on yahoo, there are a 
ton of speedcubing groups, we could make it so that there would be a 
more unified presence in the cubing community.  We could set it up 
with announcements from different organizations, and have areas set 
up for tournaments.

Great idea.
Happy Cubing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Categories are more than useful. Fingertricks, blindfold

&gt; &gt; &gt; F2L, corners-first, ..., and "general chat" for messages with a

&gt; &gt; &gt; Three things are needed. A stable webserver, moderators mature

    Hey David,

The reason I use those longer moves is that, for me, the longer algs
are much faster to perform than R2 U F B' R2 F' B U R2 or the
equivalent with slice moves.

I like the longer ones since your grip hand never moves and you never
have to rotate the cube.

I know that there are shorter and more efficient algs for swapping the
edges, but I listed the particular ones I did since for me they are
all faster to perform and thus more of what I am looking for.

I'm not being weird just to be weird, there is a method to my madness :-)

&gt; Hi Chris,
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that you take way too many moves.
&gt; 
&gt; I approach grip as something I can see coming so that I can do any
&gt; facing at pretty much the same speed.
&gt; 
&gt; You may already know these, but I find them very quick.
&gt; 
&gt; (Q means rotate the whole cube and lower case letters move just the
&gt; slice) 
&gt; One in three out:
&gt; F2 U r U2 r' U F2 and it's reverse F2 U' r U2 r' U' F2
&gt; Z pattern (swap edge pairs adjacent)
&gt; r2 D b2 D' b r2 b' and it's reverse r2 D' b2 D b r2 b'
&gt; Cross pattern (Swap edge pairs across)
&gt; r2 U r2 U2 r2 U r2
&gt; If I want I can do (R' L' D2 R L U) 2 :)

the second one has a lot more moves....17 as opposed to 7, but i can 
perform the 2nd one a lot faster.

Just something to think about...in my opinion, speedcubing is finding 
the best algorithms for yourself, so...whichever you can perfrom the 
quickest, is the best.  Of course the best option are those you can 
perform quickly, and are the shortest moves...for example the Sune...

R U R' U R U2 R'...less than one second.

although, some prefer the "Niklas".

R U' L U R' U' L

....It depends on the cuber.

&gt; &gt; Hi Chris,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that you take way too many moves.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I approach grip as something I can see coming so that I can do any
&gt; &gt; facing at pretty much the same speed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You may already know these, but I find them very quick.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (Q means rotate the whole cube and lower case letters move just 
the
&gt; &gt; slice) 
&gt; &gt; One in three out:
&gt; &gt; F2 U r U2 r' U F2 and it's reverse F2 U' r U2 r' U' F2
&gt; &gt; Z pattern (swap edge pairs adjacent)
&gt; &gt; r2 D b2 D' b r2 b' and it's reverse r2 D' b2 D b r2 b'
&gt; &gt; Cross pattern (Swap edge pairs across)
&gt; &gt; r2 U r2 U2 r2 U r2
&gt; &gt; If I want I can do (R' L' D2 R L U) 2 :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Happy cubing!

    I definately agree.  I started with the petrus method, after playing 
around self teaching myself the LBL method, but not really 
suceeding.  I learned some F2l algorithms,  and how to do a basic 
corners first method, all of which have helped me in using the Roux 
method (avg ~24.8)  The beauty is that speedcubing is less reliant on 
the method, and more about looking ahead.  The more you know and 
practice, the better you get.

&gt; I picked up a cube for the first serious time last May and have 
been thoroughly hooked since.  My initial method was similar to 
Kirk's in that it involved the first layer on top, corners before 
edges, then inserted each middle layer edge afterward.  I've since 
upgraded to cross on bottom, followed by the corner/edge pairs (which 
I've learned how to do on my own).  I use a 4 look last layer with a 
little bit of partial edge control, several special cases, and a few 
extra tricks.  With this method I am able to average around 35 
seconds with my best times hovering a tad under 24 seconds.
&gt; 
&gt; A few weeks ago, I decided to try my hand at the Roux method.  It 
requires fewer moves, on average, so, theoretically, I have the 
potential to be faster with it.  Using his system with two 1x2x3 
blocks and minimal step 3 and 4 algorithms, I am able to average 
consistently under 39 seconds, with a pair of best times fractions of 
a second slower than my best fridrich times.  I'm incredibly pleased 
with my progress, despite minimal learning.  I use this new method 
exclusively in practice now, and hope to have my times greatly 
improved by the summer when I'm able to attend another competition.  
I've decided to commit to learning more algorithms for the last layer 
corners and some of the 26 special cases for the last layer over the 
next few weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, toying around with other methods is a fantastic way to 
improve your times, even if you stick with your old method.  They can 
be invaluable for providing you with easy to recognize special cases 
you would otherwise never have learned.  Also, meeting with other 
cubers is immensely helpful.  They can teach you things you thought 
previously impossible to understand.  I hope I've helped.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   A few months ago, I was about where you are.  I opted to try to 
&gt;   learn the Fridrich method first since it's so widely used, but I 
&gt;   plan on learning Petrus and a corners first method eventually 
[and 
&gt;   now maybe the Gilles method, though not sure I even know what 
that 
&gt;   is].  And I still use some moves from my old method.
&gt; 
&gt;   With my old method, my times were about 1.5 - 2.5 minutes.  When 
I 
&gt;   started to learn Fridrich on my own, I was able to drop to about 
a 
&gt;   minute rather quickly [couple of weeks practice].  Switching to 
&gt;   cross first and doing it on the bottom was the first major 
&gt;   adjustment [my old method did the top corners first, then the top 
&gt;   edges].  then learing how to insert the corner/edge pairs was the 
&gt;   second big adjustment for me, and I still don't know all of those 
&gt;   [old method was get top layer all done, then insert each middle 
&gt;   layer edge].  last big adjustmetn I made was to learn some of the 
&gt;   PLL algs.  With that, I was at a minute to 1:15 within a couple 
of 
&gt;   weeks.
&gt; 
&gt;   I've only this week learned the final 4 of the PLL algs, and I 
still 
&gt;   know only 3 OLL algs [the ones from my old method], and my times 
&gt;   have steadily dropped.  My best is now 38.9, and I consistently 
get 
&gt;   in the 40s and 50s.  
&gt; 
&gt;   I got to the minute mark mostly by studying/practicing the 
sequences 
&gt;   I printed off various sites.  I didn't look at too many videos at 
&gt;   first because I wanted to try the moves on my own.  Later, I 
studied 
&gt;   lots of videos to watch hand technique, and that really helped.  
&gt;   There are lots of good sites out there [Dan plugged his, and 
&gt;   frankly, it was indeed extremely helpful].  Finally, getting 
&gt;   together with a couple of cubers who are much faster than me 
helped 
&gt;   with the last 15-20 seconds of progress.
&gt; 
&gt;   anyway, that's my story.  hope it's helpful.
&gt;   best regards, 
&gt;   Kirk

&gt;   &gt; Ok guys, I am an better-than-newbie at cubing right
&gt;   &gt; now. I can solve the cube in about 2 mins but my
&gt;   &gt; method is really very sloggy and it consumes a lot of
&gt;   &gt; steps. So I was thinking of shifting to some another
&gt;   &gt; method. I found that there are mainly two widespread
&gt;   &gt; methods - the Lars Petrus's Corner method and the
&gt;   &gt; cross method(I am not thinking about the Fridrich
&gt;   &gt; method right now). So can you guys suggest which
&gt;   &gt; method to use considering the documentation available
&gt;   &gt; of the method and the number of steps achieved by each
&gt;   &gt; method. 
&gt;   &gt; Currently the Lars Petrus's method is on top of  my
&gt;   &gt; list since it has some nice Java cubes alongwith the
&gt;   &gt; explanation. I havent found such a site for the cross
&gt;   &gt; method.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I like the longer ones since your grip hand never moves and you

    Hey everyone,

I am very happy, I finished learning all 158 ZBF2L cases today!  It
took me a little over 2 months to do it, which worked out to about 2.5
cases per day.  I now solve exclusively using the VH method (F2L w/
orienting LL edges, COLL, PLL) and average 19-23 seconds using it.  I
still need to work on my recognition time and moving algs to my
subconscious, particularly with the ones I have learned more recently.
 The algs I started with two months ago I can recognize very quickly,
and I don't think recognition for all 158 cases will be hard with lots
of pratice.

I'm going to take about 2-3 weeks off from learning to really cement
all these algs in my head very well.  After that I'll move on to the
ZBLL and start learning those too.

For those who thought ZBF2L might be too unreasonable because of the
number of algs I can say that I don't think it will be at all.  I
think it will take a lot of practice, but for about half the algs (the
ones I learned 1 month ago or more) I have very quick recognition and
execution.  I imagine in another month I will be comfortable with all
the cases.

http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zb.html

See my site for the algs I use for ZBF2L as well as what I consider to
be a useful order for which cases to learn first.

So far I only know for certain of 4 other people learning ZB right
now, but I would like to wish everyone that is (including those I
don't know about) lots of luck and fun by learning!

    2 months?  Yeah, that's dedication.  It took me about a year to do all 
of Fridrich... but then again, I didn't memorize algorithms every day.  
Great job!  I have no doubt you'll be executing those seamlessly.

    I think the thing that would worry me about such a method, would be 
the threat of algorithm amnesia....happened to me only when i knew

    Hi,

 

I have a spanish webpage about the rubik cube and it have a spanish forum
and an english forum. The forums use php. The english forum has not many
posts (my page have about 250 hits a day but it is a spanish page), but the
spanish forum works very well.

 

You can use this forum (if you want of course...).

 

The link of the english forum:

Well, my page has an english version but the spanish version is better.

 

Ah, sorry for my poor english.......

&gt; &gt; Hello speedcubing friends,

&gt; &gt; 

&gt; &gt; This is just a proposal, to see if anyone agrees with me. Most 

&gt; &gt; conversations between speedcubers are probably done online. 

That's 

&gt; &gt; why a discussion group or forum is very valueable for the 

&gt; &gt; speedcubing community. However, I must say, I don't really enjoy 

&gt; &gt; posting on this yahoo group. It's not very organized, the 

replies on 

&gt; &gt; one specific topic are hard to find, there are too many ads etc. 

I 

&gt; &gt; also heard another cuber say he would post more if there was a 

&gt; &gt; better forum. I think I would also have a lot more fun posting 

on a 

&gt; &gt; speedcubing forum if we just had a good looking, organized 

forum. 

&gt; &gt; For an example, take a look at this forum: 

&gt; &gt; http://www.phpbb.com/styles/demo.php.

&gt; &gt; 

&gt; &gt; As an example of what I have in mind, I have been fooling around 

&gt; &gt; with this free forum today: http://speedcubing.proboards20.com/.

&gt; &gt; 

&gt; &gt; DON'T get me wrong! I don't want everybody to agree with me, of 

&gt; &gt; course. If you really like this yahoo group, that's fine with 

me... 

&gt; &gt; I am just interested in your opinion! Am I the only one used to 

nice 

&gt; &gt; forums? :)

&gt; &gt; 

&gt; &gt; I am also not saying that the example I made is perfect, but 

it's 

&gt; &gt; just an example.

&gt; &gt; 

&gt; &gt; Happy cubing,

&gt; &gt; 

&gt; &gt; Jo√Ø¬ø¬Ωl.

&gt; 

&gt; 

&gt; I totally agree with you, a forum based on PHPBB (for example) is

&gt; 3x3x3 times better than these Yahoo groups (even worse to read 

since

&gt; they changed the layout).

&gt; Categories are more than useful. Fingertricks, blindfold 

techniques,

&gt; F2L, corners-first, ..., and "general chat" for messages with a 

short

&gt; lifespan.

&gt; Three things are needed. A stable webserver, moderators mature 

enough

&gt; and a willing community.

&gt; Hey! Just add a "Forum" area to speedcubing.com's menus! ;-)

&gt; 

&gt; Gilles.

Here's an example of a phpBB forum. I just became a member of it, and

That's a great price! Maybe it's because Irwin Toy is back in town and

Since I'm from Germany, too, I have the same "problem". Well, you can 
certainly at least get used ones at the German Cube Day (I hope you'll 
be there?). They'll probably be around 4 Euros and you can try them 
before buying :-)

    Hi, 

I am recently working on the web site of my office. 
(Sorry this is not disclosed yet. )
I really love CMS and want to change my cubing site into CMS managed 
one. 

PhPBB must be a great CMS. 
But there are many good free CMSs. 
http://www.opensourcecms.com/index.php

I tested a few of them and chose XOOPS. 
http://www.xoops.org

It is partly because there are many ehthusiastic developers in Japan. 
But this is not the only reason. 
You can easily create not only forums but also movie albums, 
calendar, headline news, poll, etc. 

XOOPS also offers great multilanguage support including two byte code 
languages.(Of course, it can'T translate contents just header and 
bottuns. ) What you need is just multilanguage module and language 
fiels. 

examples of multilanguage support
http://www.peak.ne.jp/xoops/?easiestml_lang=xlang:en

http://demo.smartfactory.ca/

This must be great advantage for everybody accessing from different 
countries. 

&gt;Before the layout change this forum was ok, but now i find it very 
&gt;hard to read with the new colors, the previews of the messages in 
the 
&gt;message board and and the ads.
Every visitor can choose background and layout from provided list if 
theme changer is installed. 

Japanese example
Try to click titles in the middle column. Theme will change. 
http://hello.oceannet.jp/ 

&gt;messages via e-mail.  Trying to look at new messages means I need to
&gt;click through lots of different forums rather than looking at a list
&gt;of message subjects for the entire board.
&gt;If the new forum can deal with these issues, then I wouldn't mind
&gt;moving.  But I'm pretty happy with the group as it is now.
XOOPS offers your choices to recieve notification with or without 
text. 
But you have to set these options by yourself. 

just my 2 cents.

    Hey,

I don't really understand what you mean by CMS... Anyway, I found a 
free way to host a phpBB forum, just to get a general idea of what 
it would look like... 

http://www.5wwwww5.com/forum/index.php?mforum=speedcubing

And I know Stefan, it's free... I don't know if a free host like 
this is reliable.

I should also confess that I don't know the first thing about PHP, 
MySQL or PostgreSQL. Are there any cubers around who know more about 
this?

Joel.

    Hey Chris!

*Respect* :D. I don't know if I'll ever try to learn that many algs. 

btw, didn't you ever think of orientating the edges before making 
the cross? It's maybe a little hard to master that, but if it's 
possible, you would not have to memorize all those ZB f2l algs :).

&gt; 
&gt; Hey everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I am very happy, I finished learning all 158 ZBF2L cases today!  It
&gt; took me a little over 2 months to do it, which worked out to about 
2.5
&gt; cases per day.  I now solve exclusively using the VH method (F2L w/
&gt; orienting LL edges, COLL, PLL) and average 19-23 seconds using 
it.  I
&gt; still need to work on my recognition time and moving algs to my
&gt; subconscious, particularly with the ones I have learned more 
recently.
&gt;  The algs I started with two months ago I can recognize very 
quickly,
&gt; and I don't think recognition for all 158 cases will be hard with 
lots
&gt; of pratice.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to take about 2-3 weeks off from learning to really 
cement
&gt; all these algs in my head very well.  After that I'll move on to 
the
&gt; ZBLL and start learning those too.
&gt; 
&gt; For those who thought ZBF2L might be too unreasonable because of 
the
&gt; number of algs I can say that I don't think it will be at all.  I
&gt; think it will take a lot of practice, but for about half the algs 
(the
&gt; ones I learned 1 month ago or more) I have very quick recognition 
and
&gt; execution.  I imagine in another month I will be comfortable with 
all
&gt; the cases.
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zb.html
&gt; 
&gt; See my site for the algs I use for ZBF2L as well as what I 
consider to
&gt; be a useful order for which cases to learn first.
&gt; 
&gt; So far I only know for certain of 4 other people learning ZB right
&gt; now, but I would like to wish everyone that is (including those I
&gt; don't know about) lots of luck and fun by learning!

You could try to use Gilles' tip about making stickers yourself, 
though :):

(Goto 'workshop'). I haven't tried this myself yet... I did buy all 
the materials to do it, though :).

&gt; Middle layers edges (hold solved layer to the left)

Please tell us how many moves are needed to build the cage.

I'm a rookie, but my first stats look like:

- R-edges: ?

You must have found some ways of shortening the process, because much
more than 100 moves is too much (I need about 90 moves to solve this
"cage" + R-centers using my technique).
Any tips?

this message several months after it has been posted, just go to the
"4x4x4" section. In this group, it's gonna be burried and forgotten in

&gt; Hey guys, I've got an official Rubik's cube, and I am trying to get

You should be able to get them from Mark Longridge.  I picked up a 
bunch from him, and I see he offers shipping outside of North 
America. He is a nice guy. I am sure if he can, he will help you 
out. Here is the link to the details about contacting him and the 
stickers.

I don't know where to figure out when it was produced (it was 
probably on the box), but it arrived yesterday, and I really like 
it.  It's definitely the real thing, well constructed, stickers on 
straight, real logo, etc...


Okay, I just looked at the box.  Copyright date is '99. Made in

No, you are correct. Cutting the quote away is possible, hence my

not force me to quote¬Ö".  It is just good practice to do so incase 
someone enters the topic at a point below the originating post.  
That way people that are reading my entry know to which part I am

    update: I just tried out restickering my cube using robust plastic

    Hey!

Im on my way home now. Short reply only now ...

90-100 moves sounds reasonable. 2 moves/sec and u are at 45/50 secs 
before the centers. Im nearer to 55 when at full speed. And then 25 
secs to finish off the centers.

Better reply tomorrow :-)

   Sorry, this should have read "quarter turn." I know that Yahoo is

that Yahoo put back the "post number search," but I dislike that the
"edit your own post" feature is gone now.

&gt; &gt; 9 fix the four remaining centers  
&gt; 
&gt; After all this detail (not at all a complaint ;-) something's still 
&gt; missing: What are your times with this method?

   I only just got a cube that might be good for speedcubing, so all
my times are are on cubes which cannot be turned quickly. 

I did calculate the number of turns I take, though:

12 (12)
6 + 4 + 8 + 5 (35)
5 + 7 (47)
8 + 8 (63)
5 (68)
14 + 14 (96)
1 (97)
7 (104)
9 + 21 (134)

Is this comparable to others?

Actually the first step is really 11, but I don't know the all 11 move
 algs.

Hi howru2day, :) Stefan,

At the US Nationals last year Ton was selling "Cube 21" the European
version of Square 1. It has the best movement I have ever felt in a
puzzle; if only Seven Towns would twig to it.

Anyway they are available in Germany:

    Hey Chris,

I understand. I just optimized what my hands do. You've probably spent
a lot of time getting those quick, but it may only be a different
style/technique. I'd probable have as much trouble switching to your
algs, as you would switching to mine.

I know there's method to your madness, it's just a different method... :)

&gt; Hey David,
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I use those longer moves is that, for me, the longer algs
&gt; are much faster to perform than R2 U F B' R2 F' B U R2 or the
&gt; equivalent with slice moves.
&gt; 
&gt; I like the longer ones since your grip hand never moves and you never
&gt; have to rotate the cube.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that there are shorter and more efficient algs for swapping the
&gt; edges, but I listed the particular ones I did since for me they are
&gt; all faster to perform and thus more of what I am looking for.

    Very similar to 3x3x3.  Rotate one face  by about 45 degrees so that
an edge cubie is lined up with the corner.  Stick your finger or a
screwdriver under the edge and pop it out (as gently as possible).  Be
careful, because the center pieces are prone to breaking.  After the
first piece is out, the rest of them should come out (and go back in)
without the need for force.

These instructions are for the Rubik's brand 4x4x4.  I've never taken
apart an Eastsheen cube, and they may be constructed a little
differently.

    I also agree that this new layout sucks!
The old one wasn¬¥t better in terms of order but atleast it was 
readable.
I would be a lot more active on a forum, also then all this different 
groups (speedsolving, FMC, blindofolded, Caltech etc.) could all be 
"under one roof" so to say.
The only down side I can think of is that the commuinty will split in

&gt; version of Square 1. It has the best movement I have ever felt in a
&gt; puzzle; if only Seven Towns would twig to it.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway they are available in Germany:

    Do you line up the pieces about the same to spray them?  After you take 
it apart, are there any surprise pieces?  When I lube my 3x3x3, I take

Now maybe you could give me some motivation to carry on with ZB, I am
falling behind. :(

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Done!

 


Hey everyone,

I am very happy, I finished learning all 158 ZBF2L cases today!  It
took me a little over 2 months to do it, which worked out to about 2.5
cases per day.  I now solve exclusively using the VH method (F2L w/
orienting LL edges, COLL, PLL) and average 19-23 seconds using it.  I
still need to work on my recognition time and moving algs to my
subconscious, particularly with the ones I have learned more recently.
The algs I started with two months ago I can recognize very quickly,
and I don't think recognition for all 158 cases will be hard with lots
of pratice.

I'm going to take about 2-3 weeks off from learning to really cement
all these algs in my head very well.  After that I'll move on to the
ZBLL and start learning those too.

For those who thought ZBF2L might be too unreasonable because of the
number of algs I can say that I don't think it will be at all.  I
think it will take a lot of practice, but for about half the algs (the
ones I learned 1 month ago or more) I have very quick recognition and
execution.  I imagine in another month I will be comfortable with all
the cases.

http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zb.html

See my site for the algs I use for ZBF2L as well as what I consider to
be a useful order for which cases to learn first.

So far I only know for certain of 4 other people learning ZB right
now, but I would like to wish everyone that is (including those I
don't know about) lots of luck and fun by learning!

Chris

    Hey!

I have another suggestion also.

Use the VirtualDub to make an uncompressed .avi file first. Then use 
the STOIK video converter to make a compressed video. It's much 
easier to use that program than the cumbersome VirtualDub. Esp when 
working w multiple files. The advantage of uncompressing w 
VirtualDub is that is supports many more fileformats. The STOIK can 
output divx or .wmv as useful compressed formats.

Link to the STOIK : http://www.stoik.com/products/svc/

Choose the free version ;-)

Have fun!!

-Per

PS! And use VLC for viewing files that the windows mediaplayer 
struggles with ;-) The GUI is not so nice but the playback is very 
good :-) VLC is free :-) (Link : http://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

&gt; No, you are correct. Cutting the quote away is possible, hence my 
&gt; phrasing it that "I wouldn't have to quote¬Ö" instead of "it would 
&gt; not force me to quote¬Ö".

Hmm, I don't really see the difference... Is there any?

&gt; It is just good practice to do so incase 
&gt; someone enters the topic at a point below the originating post.

If I want to know the *whole* previous message(s in case of quoted 
quotes etc) then I click on "Up Thread".

&gt; That way people that are reading my entry know to which part I am 
&gt; referring.

No they don't. Unless you quote and reply to pieces. Oh wait, you 
don't mean part of message but part of thread? Use "Up Thread".

&gt; But in a message board environment, it is always 
&gt; visible on the page, so the need is omitted.

There's no need here, either. Use "Up Thread".

Usually though I think it's best to indeed use quotes. But don't quote 
the whole message including all previously quoted quotes, that's just 
stupid waste (I don't want to offend anyone, but it's the truth). I 
try to always quote the name of the poster and then only selected 
quotes. So that readers actually know what you reply to. And the same 
is true for message boards.

Cheers!

Haha, so that was indeed a mistake? After thinking about it, I thought 
you had meant turn half of the cube by a quarter turn ;-)

Did we ever have one? I thought we didn't! Damn... could've used that 
quite a few times...

&gt; I did calculate the number of turns I take, though:

Hmm, not bad. I haven't really counted myself yet but your 134 might

&gt; &gt; No, you are correct. Cutting the quote away is possible, hence 
my 
&gt; &gt; phrasing it that "I wouldn't have to quote¬Ö" instead of "it 
would 
&gt; &gt; not force me to quote¬Ö".
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm, I don't really see the difference... Is there any?

Indeed there is a difference, and an important one at that. The 
difference is the freedom of choice. 

&gt; &gt; It is just good practice to do so incase 
&gt; &gt; someone enters the topic at a point below the originating post.
&gt; 
&gt; If I want to know the *whole* previous message(s in case of quoted 
&gt; quotes etc) then I click on "Up Thread".

Fair enough, but as it was discovered quite recently, not everyone 
is aware of this feature. Also, it only brings you to the message 
immediately above the current one in the thread.  It can be time 
consuming for someone to click through posts, reading them all 
looking for one single reference.  It is just easier, and more 
efficient to include it in your post. 

&gt; &gt; But in a message board environment, it is always 
&gt; &gt; visible on the page, so the need is omitted.
&gt; 
&gt; There's no need here, either. Use "Up Thread".

If you are hoping for people to navigate through many pages just to 
understand which part you are taking about,  it is probably not 
going to happen as often as you may think.  There doesn't seem to be 
much harm in quoting a message to which you are replying.  I only 
quoted the *entire* message the first time because I wasn't 
responding to a specific part, but rather a response on the post in 
general.  It seems valid to me, but apparently you have your own 
opinions on the subject. 

&gt; Usually though I think it's best to indeed use quotes. But don't 
quote 
&gt; the whole message including all previously quoted quotes, that's 
just 
&gt; stupid waste (I don't want to offend anyone, but it's the truth). 

It isn't a waste of time in the true sense of the term, because 
yahoo automatically includes it for you in your post.  Thereby 
eliminating any "time" required to perform the aforementioned 
action.  However, I agree, I wouldn't do that unless it was relevant 
to what I was posting about.

&gt; I try to always quote the name of the poster and then only 
selected 
&gt; quotes. So that readers actually know what you reply to. And the 
same 
&gt; is true for message boards.

I agree with you, and I do the same thing. 

You seem to be rather passionate about the structure in which people 
participate on these types of forums.  That is great; having a 
passion for just about anything is admirable. Perhaps you should 
write up a guide for new, and veteran, people so that no one else 
comes along and puts your knickers in a knot.

"having to quote" is more freedom than "being forced to quote"? I 
still don't see the difference.

&gt;  There doesn't seem to be 
&gt; much harm in quoting a message to which you are replying.  I only 
&gt; quoted the *entire* message the first time because I wasn't 
&gt; responding to a specific part, but rather a response on the post in 
&gt; general.

Let me clarify one thing: I didn't really complain about yours. I only 
commented it because it sounded like you had no choice.

I remember a few posts a while ago where several people quoted and 
quoted again and in the end we had several posts of up to 19 screen 
pages each. Yes, 19 pages! Each post! But only a few lines of actually 
new text! *That* is what I really consider to be unnecessary waste.

&gt; It isn't a waste of time in the true sense of the term, because 
&gt; yahoo automatically includes it for you in your post.

Hello?! Don't you *read* messages, too? Don't you have to download 
them from the web? If you use the "expanded" view, don't you have to 
scroll over quotes? Doesn't that all cost time? And how about 
bandwith? If I take a few seconds to cut quotes than it will 
potentially save *hundreds* of other people some time! Which makes it 
worth it I think.

&gt; You seem to be rather passionate about the structure in which people 
&gt; participate on these types of forums.

Again, I'm mainly against completely unnecessary and huge repeated 
quoting. Sorry if I sounded harsh.

Cheers!
Stefan

Btw, I have a very similar problem using phpBB boards. I have to

    Rubiks.com is of course the most obvious choice (they have 2x2, 3x3, 
4x4, &amp; 5x5 (i don't remember if they still carry the keychain).  there 
was a recent thread about purchasing square-1.

    You can get the 3x3x3 at pretty much any big one-stop-shop type store 
(i.e. Wal Mart) or toy store.  Barnes and Noble has started to carry 
4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes.  I've found 3x3x3 Keychain cubes at a local

    Hola Pablo, 

I bought CRC Heavy Duty Silicone Spray multi purpose libricant at a 
True Value hardware store.  I looked at Home Depot and they didn't 
have anything.  I know a lot of people like the Prestone brand too, 
but what I have works great for me.   Just stay away from petroleum 
based.

there was a post to link where you can order Square-1 on the 
internet:
Direct link to the offer Ben mentioned:
http://dealsafari.com/dsWebproductdetail.aspx?ID=1202

That's a bit harder to find in stores.

Good Luck!

Great, thanks! Will use that from now on.

Of course all it does is automatically hitting the "end" key for me at 
the right point of time ;-) It still downloads the whole thread page 
including all those avatar pictures and some posted pictures. And I 
still have to scroll up to the oldest unread post (I think?).

    Strange....DuPoint Teflon Silicone (From lowe's as well) works awesome 
on my cubes. This is how I decide what kind of lube to use for cubes:

~First Time (When it's sealed): Use WD-40 if the cube seriously sucks 
so that it will eat away the plastic. If it's just brand new and 
average, I just use SNAP, and leave it there overnight and the cube 
becomes "loose" the next day.
~3 Days after playing:The SNAP will wear out because the pieces 
compress together more, which makes it rub against each other and 
makes it "go away" (sorry for my non-scientific explanation, spring 
break has gotten to my head already -_-"). I then spray a little bit 
of Pledge (wood polisher) and play with it.
~A week after the 3 days: I use DU-Point Teflon Silicone. It makes the 
cube feel "slower" but ALOT smoother. By this time, the cube should be 
good enough a speedcube.
~After the cube is almost worn out: Use silicone wax or cube lube and 
then the cube will probably become your best speedcube (at least for 
me)

Hope that helps~

    Hello all. I live in India, and am hooked to cubes.
But the problem is that there are almost no decent
cubes out here. Even when I am willing to spend out
money, the quality of cubes is extremely bad. So
speedcubing is out of my limit now. i average around 1
and half minute but if i try to do any faster the cube
wont allow it. I have greased the cube and it has
gotten a lil better but still not of the quality i
seee in the speedcubing videos. 
My question is that is there a way to import good
cubes like Oddzone or something into India. I checked
Amazon but they provide only books overseas.

    Yes, when I was a newbie, I started using teflon spray as lubricant. 
It does not work that good on every cube; it depends on the cube. I 
would not recommend using teflon spray in an Arxon cube, but on my old 
cube, it worked pretty good. But I would also advise you not to try 
this with your favorite cube... You never know what will happen.

    Yeah, I know his auctions... he also has a website. I'm convinced he 
doesn't even have any of the puzzles but let's rubiks and meffert

Look at his other auctions:
http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQsassZvolorubik

Someone already bid on the Skewb Ultimate, for $50 + $15 shipping. 
Pretty sad this works sometimes.

But can it beat this guy?

Tries to sell a used cube (though 80s) without box for 50 Euros 
buy-it-now. Actually he has tried it three times now. The first time 
his buy-it now was 99 Euros! Maybe it's special, he calls it "Kubik" ;

12 but now it is 15. I will not be buying anything until he becomes

    Hey Everyone,

In order to try and encourage people to attend the tournament in 
Dallas, Texas, the Caltech Rubik's Cube Club is offering this cube 
selling promotion.  If you sell 100 cubes, we'll send you to Dallas for 
free!  E-mail me at tmao at its dot caltech dot edu for more details.  
Basically, you find 100 people to buy cubes, we'll send you 100 cubes, 
and that plane ticket to Dallas.  How does one go about selling 100 
cubes?  Easy!  Just start teaching people... find that club fair at 
your school, etc.  Just cube in public, have a supply of cubes on hand, 
and just trade a cube for a $10 bill and you're all set.

Either that, or if you buy 100 cubes from us, we'll send you to Dallas 
for free as well!  Actually, we'll throw in 8 cubes just for free 
because that makes it divisible by 12.

Other free plane tickets to Dallas deals can be worked out.  I just 
really want people to go to the tournament in Dallas... so go sign up 
on our yahoo database.  We have 5 people right now.  5.  It would be 
nice if it were 50.

    Been on holiday so I'm way behing with this thread.  Also I'd like to catch
my nunber of posts up with the top ten posters so ...

I never log into the forum itself but just get all the posts directly
forwarded to my e-mail.

Am I missing out by doing this?  Is there more to be gained by actually
logging on?  This is the only group I use so I don't know much about groups
and really would like some constructive answers (if there are any)!

All the posts get automatically saved in my e-mail too so I can always find
old ones easily.

Great, thanks! Will use that from now on.

Of course all it does is automatically hitting the "end" key for me at
the right point of time ;-) It still downloads the whole thread page
including all those avatar pictures and some posted pictures. And I
still have to scroll up to the oldest unread post (I think?).

    I don't see much advantage to logging in to read posts.  I prefer the
Gmail user interface to the Yahoo message board interface.

The group has things other than messages (files, chat, member list)
that you can access via the website.

Setting up e-mail delivery is more complicated than logging in to the
forum (no setup).  If you want to be able to post through e-mail, you
have make sure that the e-mail address that you give to the group
matches the sender address that your e-mail program puts on the
messages.  If you use an e-mail forwarding service, this may not be
the case.

If you are searching for old messages, the group has messages going
back to 6/18/2000, and your e-mail only has messages going back to
when you signed up for e-mail delivery.

    No, that can't be right.  For a given F2L case, you already limit the 
corner orientation and edge orientation.  Isn't the number around 700?

    Ok.. I'll just try to roughly estimate this..

If there are 42 F2L cases, there are 4! permutations for the 
corners, and 4! for the edges.. There are 3^3 corner orientations, 
and 2^3edge orientations.. I also multiply by (1/2) to deal with the 
parity...

42*4!*4!*3^3*2^3  *(1/2)= 2612736

So that's about 2.6 million possibilities.. Can anyone confirm this?

I'll try again.. Assuming there are 42 F2L cases, there are about:

42*3^3*2^3 = 9072 possibilities (I think).

    Well recently I'v started learning the zb f2l, and I know all the
cases where you already have the corner edge pair already paired up
and I know a few others but when I do these cases I orient the last
layer by finishing the f2l a lot more often than when I just used
fridrich f2l.  I'd estimate using the zb f2l I skip the OLL about 1/50

    &gt; I consider the 4x4x4 more difficult than the 5x5x5, since the parity 
&gt; problems are visible on the 5x5x5 but not on the 4x4x4.
&gt; Also, at a certain point adding more pieces does not make it harder, 
&gt; just longer to solve.
&gt; Other than that, I definitely agree with you.

There's an interesting change there. On the 5-by, there's one parity error you need to know, and it's obvious to detect if you go the 3-by reduction method, but on the 4-by there are three possible parity problems and they don't show themselves until you are almost on top of them in some situations.

Using that list, people can try several of the algs and choose the alg wich they consider to be the easiest they personally feel.
 
I am writing 2 seperate lists; one that only uses the basic notation  ( F L' U2 F B etc.)  and another one that uses speedcuber notations  ( x'  F2 r [L B2] x' r' [U2 L2] d  etc. )
 
If anyone has any algs they would like to contribute, or any websites that have several algs listed on them, send me feedback at:

    Sorry about my previous messages, I screwed up all the math in each post.

That's awesome that you're learning ZBF2L, I hope more people will get
interested and start learning it.  So far I know that Lars and I are
working very hard on it, and that Ron and Zbigniew have worked on it a
lot too.

It seems a lot of people do this intuitively, and I have no idea
whether it is better to learn the computer optimized cases first and
then try to understand them, or just do it intuitively from the start.

I can say that there are lots of patterns that come up a lot in the
ZBF2L algs, and those patterns are easy to understand.  You can tell
that most of the algs trasform the case you have into one of those new
patterns and then solves from there.

Anyway good luck with ZBF2L,
Chris

    Hey!

Well then im one of those weird cubers :D I do centers last on the 
4x4x4 and 5x5x5. And as u can see from the unofficial world records 
im quite fast with it too ;-) The benefit of doing centers last (for 
me anyway) is that the rest of the solve speeds up. Doing the 
centers on the last 5 faces last is a bit slower than doing centers 
first. But at least by now the rest of the cube is solves and u have 
easier recognition. Easy recognition is the way to success on the 
larger cubes. many (including me) find that pairing up is too 
awkward since ur only ppoint of reference is one (or two) other edge
(s) only. The pairing up stage is what most ppl struggle to speed 
up. I know of good cubers who spend more time on the pairing-up 
stage than on one of my complete solves. So the normal 3x3x3 
reduction "regime" is not the salvation for everyone :-)

I would call my method the cage method. It's somewhat similar to 
columns first method.

First layer (top)
Middle layers edges (hold solved layer to the left)
Last layer corners then edges (and parity)
Final centers

Happy cubing !!

-Per




I'm still learning to do the 4-by and 5-by cubes (takes me five minutes for the 5-by using the reduction thing) and I'd really like to learn your method, as I think it might help me - especially when I'm doing patterns, where often I have to move some centers around. What kind of algorithms do you use for the centers?

given algorithm and can be used for PLL, ZBF2l, etc.  Here's the 
website:

It takes a few minutes to set up but check it out if you're interested 
and let me know what you think!

PS  The program crashes once in a while for some unknown reason.  If 
he knows people are using it, Jason might be motivated to try to fix 
the bug.

    It looks like the original quote of $50 for the 'official' timing pad
will retail for closer to twice that:

"...it turns out that in order to sell these timers on

It generates scrambles for 3x3 -&gt; 5x5 cubes, but I think that the
light sensors will work with almost any puzzle. The puzzle just needs
to block light when placed back on the pad :)

    Nice work.. The interface looks very nice. I am not sure if I'll 
ever use a program like that to learn algorithms though. But one 
little advantage could be, that you can choose to enable the algs 
you already know... I'll keep it, anyway :).

    Hey Chris!!

A few suggestions:

1) Ditch the Rubik name from the product. Call it Cube Timer or 
Puzzle Timer or something like that.

2) Don't sell it through rubiks.com. Advertise it from private 
webpages like speedcubing.com, cubestation.co.uk and so on. It's 
also possible for u to set up an ebay shop, and organise payment 
through PayPal.

However, just don't give it up yet. It's possible u have already 
committed urself to those tradenames (a shame). Think of every 
possible option to sell it cheaper before u give up :-)

Kind regards,

Per

Actually the original price hope was $80, not $50. Click on the link 
"concept proposal document" right behind the "$50" and you'll land 
here:

    Just a quick update.

Spent the last week learning these 26 algorithms and now have them.  As I
already know and use the edge orientation algorithms I only have 17 more to
learn to do the whole L2L4 strategy.  I am averaging around 55 moves with
what I already know.  Not too fast yet - around 40 seconds average.

Its really great not having to do the OLL step though!

    1854. Solving Layer 1

    I've spent some time on ways of solving layer 1 - which is step 1 of the L2L
strategies.

My favourite method of the moment is to put in one edge piece and then add
in layer 1 corner-edge pairs (average ~moves each) until I have a 3x2x1
rectangle on the top layer - this takes 10 moves in total.  Then either put
in one more corner-ege pair and a corner separate or try to build the final
edge and two corners and put in.  Either way theoretically its still 18-19
moves.

The annoying thing is that going slow in practice I can usually do the 15-16
moves.

Using just corner and edge orientation steps of the L2L strategies the 3x2x1
block approach is great.  10 moves plus 2 for the last edge.  Then use
Fridrich pairs to finish the last two corners with two middel edges - total
so far 12+7+7 = 26.  Then use the two L2L steps and PLL to finish.  Its
coming out at 55 in practice - I think 55-56 in theory.

Looking through posts yesterday I saw mention of a 3x2x1 block method (maybe
Gilles method?).  I'll look it up to see if it helps but if anyone has any
helpful suggestions I'd love to hear.

    G'day fellow cubers, I'm Keith, a new member from Australia. I'm 36 
and I've been into cubing since around August '04. I was in high 
school during the big cube craze in the early eighties but I could 
only do the first 2 layers back then.

When I left school I bought a solution book and learnt to do the LL.
I always kept a cube handy and would solve it occasionally just to 
keep in my mind how to do it. I often wondered if (and hoped) the 
cube would make a comeback.

One day at the local library on the internet I thought I'd do a 
search for rubiks cubes, not really expecting to find much and to my 
surprise there was a lot more than I anticipated, and the rest as 
they say, is history!


I'm currently using the usual F2L and 3 look LL, I have learnt some 
OLL algs but there's still for me a lot to learn yet. At the moment 
my times are in the 40/50 sec range though I have managed some low 
30's and two in the 20's, a 29- and 28.84 or something.

    Hey everyone,

I have a question about a particular COLL case for those who use it. 
Does anyone have a fast alg for this case, or a fast trigger for one
of these two algs?

1) BL'U2LB'L'BU2B'L
2) R'DR2DL2D'R2DL2D2R

Both algs are the solving algorithm for the same COLL case, so do the
inverse to set it up.

I currently use the first alg and I do it like this to average 3-3.5
seconds each execution.

(B) y2 (R' U2 R) y L' F' (L U2 L') (F)

This is probably my slowest COLL case, or at least one of my slowest.

If anyone has any tips for this case it would be very much appreciated :-)

    I just found this trick which seems to go fast as well, maybe this is
also an option for making that case faster.

Alg) BL'U2LB'L'BU2B'L
Alg with trick) (B) (L' U2) x' [(L U') (L' U)] y' R2 (U') (F)
do the (U') and (F) with your left and right index fingers respectively.

    Hello everyone,

The 3x3 has become 'cool' at my school again. Almost everyone has one 
of them these a days, and one isn't really 'hot' if he/she can solve 
it. Being a highly regarded cubist at school, although I average only 
about 55 secs, I want to pwn the 5x5s, which I have played with the 
5x5 before. I was almost able to get it in the 3x3 form (and later 
trying to solve it). However, the cube wasn't mine, and my friend 
messed the whole thing up.

Hence, I want to buy a 5x5 and be able to solve it peacefully, 
without any disruption. Now, as I haven't much knowledge about them, 
I want someone to help with buying one of them. I have come across 3 
kinds: 

A Tiled "Limited Edition Professor Cube" on Mefferts - 
http://sites.webec.com.hk/meffert/index.cfm?
fuseaction=detail&amp;id=74322&amp;product=123

A Tiled, Regular Professor Cube also on Mefferts - 
http://sites.webec.com.hk/meffert/index.cfm?
fuseaction=detail&amp;id=74322&amp;product=10

A Stickered Regular Professor Cube on Rubiks.com - 
https://secure.rubiks.com/lvl3/index_lvl3.cfm?
lan=eng&amp;lvl1=produc&amp;lvl2=rubbrn&amp;lvl3=clasic&amp;lvl4=cubprf

A DIY East Sheen cube - http://www.eastsheen.com.tw/a5.htm

These are all the various 5x5s i could find on the net. Which one is 
best among these? Are there any others out there that are better? Are 
tiled ones better than stickered ones? I know that stickers may peel 
off, but are replacement tiles available anywhere?

I know these are too many questions, but I will be glad if you can 
answer my questions and help me in purchasing a 5x5. 

Thanks,

Gautam

    It's the accuracy of the stackmat that makes it so expensive.  It's not 
just a button that stops the timer.  It operates by using capacitance 
so that it can be very accurate.

    The name my friend the name. Any time you put a name on something, the cost increases by a factor of at leats three. Look at the new cube timer, just because the names have to appear on it, doubled the cost.

    It is the official timing device for cup stacking, so if you would be 
at a serious cupstacking disadvantage if you didn't have one to 
practice with.  hence, it is crucial to cupstackers to buy stackmats 
rather than using other timing devices.  this certainly adds to the 
cost of the product.

If I can do this, anyone can!  It took me a year to get from ~20

    Nice!
And be optimistic, you may become much faster in the next months
without any good reason :-)

By the way, is there a record for the number of consecutive sub-20
solves? Mine is now 56. I think it's a good measure of consistency and
endurance. People who did cube marathons should be good at this.

    My Rubiks.com 5x5 was very stiff when I first got it.  My thumbs hurt
after playing with it for a while.  After about 24 hours of use
though, it is quite loose.  The outside RUFBUD faces are harder to
turn than the rufbud faces though.  I also have lubed it and it has
helped a lot.

I just recently saw 5x5's at Barnes and Noble for sale for $30.  If
your like me, you would rather get one on the spot than wait on mail

    Actually, I started learning recently from your site.  I haven't worked on it very much, so I can't solve a whole cube yet.  I've been so busy learning different methods I've been neglecting to fulfill any of my plans for blindsolving.  On the upside, though, I've managed to get sub 50 averages with 4 separate methods.  I learned a layer by layer solution, originally.  I can average slightly sub 30 with my 4 look LL.  A month ago I switched to the Roux method, with which I'm averaging around 35.  I got my best time with that, a 22.86.  I recently developed a corners first method that I'm using to teach friends how to solve the cube.  It's pretty simple and averages between 75 and 85 moves, but it works.  Yesterday I decided to learn the Petrus method.  I like the approach, and with it I managed to average under 45 after only an hour of practice.  Anywho, I hope to have more time to work on blindsolving tonight.  Any extra advice will still be welcome, though.

    Yes that was interesting...

It jogged my memory of "That's Incredible" as one guy
back in 1981 also dyed his hair like Pete did (I can't
remember which one).

I assume that was the "Very Small Films" version.

One if these days I'll try and transfer the old 1982 Beta
tape to digital and then you can see some old school
cubing.

    I'd like to ask all you guys what is a good way to think of x, y, z as. I know it's whole cube rotations, but just as with E, M, and the other middle thingy I tend to get confused no matter how many explanations I read. I'd love to use my old vX/mX system, but since none of you use that...

I think we should totally revamp the system for compatibility on higher-order cubes (and, of course, efficiency)... But how? What symbol would you use for turning the right 3 layers of a 5-by? If you accept Us on the 3-by, would you accept it on the 4-by? Would you accept "us"? How about (Uu)s? Is there a symbol for {X Y X' Y'}? What would Megaminx, Skewb, Pyraminx, Alexander's Star notation look like? What do you use for {X X X X}?

How do you keep track of it all?

    I have been wanting to try a blindfold solve for a while, but just 
never really thought I could memorize the state of the cube.  I proved 
myself wrong, but I still failed in solving.  Close only counts in 
horse shoes and hand grenades, as they say. :\

Anybody who would like to read about my first blindsolve attempt can

    so you first think of your xyz axes.  x points to the right, y points 
up, z points at you.  now to perform x, y, or z, you just rotate the 
cube about that axis.  let's take for example x (which points to the 
right).  what i do to keep from getting confused is to hold the R 
face with my right hand.  then i rotate the cube in the direction of 
my thumb (clockwise).  i should end up with the D face facing me

Nice -- someone here who uses a transparent notation! :)

Some of us use Rc Uc' Fc2 for these same rotations.  For M, E and S, 
I prefer Lm (or Rm'), Dm and Fm.  Probably there are others who do 
the same.

For the 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 notations, I use the "standard" ones, even 
though that forces you to write things like (R r) for a move that is 
easier to do than r alone -- and the symbol r has a totally different 
meaning here from the 2-layer move on the 3x3x3.

However, if you don't mind numerical subscripts (and they *are* 
inconvenient for typing), one possibility would be to use R_n for a 
turn of the rightmost n+1 layers and r_n for a turn of the n-th slice 
alone (i.e., the (n+1)-th layer) counted from the right.  Or some 
other, similar counting convention.

It's not a very serious suggestion ;)

    Hey!!!

Seriously, x y z notation is really confusing. This has been 
discussed many times before. Ppl have different notions about what 
they are supposed to mean. So it does indeed create confusion. For 
the official meaning of x y z check this link : 

http://www.speedcubing.com/moves.html

I prefer personally to use Rc = x, Lc = x', Uc = y, Dc = y', Fc = z, 
Bc = z' This is because everyone already knows the basic faceturns. 
For a halfturn of the cube use either R2c or (better) (Rc)2 ... and 
so on ...

Cheers!!

Hehe, I like the stories you made up for memorizing :-) I think it's 
good that you have many persons as objects. I have too much food and 
other non-living items. I'm in the process of expanding my collection 
of objects, so that for each color pair I have two possible encodings, 
one living person and one dead object. I already memorize in pairs, 
and when I have to memorize a tomato and an orange it's hard to 
remember which one came first. I try to make the first one active, so 
for example a giant killer tomato squeezes the orange flat. But if I 
encode RG with a person instead of tomato, then it's much easier. The 
person always comes first, doing something with the second (dead) 
object.

Good luck for your next attempts!

Cheers!
Stefan

I assume you are referring to an H pattern?  (orients UF and UB)
How about this:  (R U R' U' r) (R' U) (R U' r')

&gt; 2) LL Algorithm that re-orients all of the edge pieces on the LL,

I assume you are referring to an X pattern? (orients all four edges)
I use this:  (r' R U) (R U R' U') (r2 R2' U) (R U' r')

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] A bit of algorithm help



  'Does anybody have any algorithms that can help me in this situation? 
  I've managed to come up with my own, but these I can't figure out.

  1) LL Algorithm that re-orients two incorrectly oriented edge pieces
  opposite eachother on the LL, preserving LL corners' orientations.'

  I don't know any nice fast ones, but this is what I use.  It had the added bonus of not shuffling anything around, just fixing the two pieces' orientations.
  (M U M U M) U2 (M' U M' U M') U2

  '2) LL Algorithm that re-orients all of the edge pieces on the LL,
  preserving corners' orientations.'

  To orient 2 of them UF and UR) as is, and not shuffle anything:
  (M U M') U2 (M U M U M) U2 (M' U M2)

  Or, to orient 2 of them (UF and UR) while 3 cycling edges clockwise (UR-&gt;UF, UF-&gt;UL, UL-&gt;UR)
  (M U M') U2 (M U M) [possible U]
   Perform that last one twice and the corners stay put, but your edges are oriented and have gone through the z permutation (UL&lt;-&gt;UF and UB&lt;-&gt;UR).  I hope this helps.

  'What is "M"?'

  M is when you turn the slice in between L and R what would be clockwise for the L face.  In other words, it's like turning l and then turning L' (or r' followed by R like I do).  Good luck.

  Happy cubing,

    I personaly like the idea of using somehthing along the lines of C
followed by the face, so you turn the entire cube as if you were
turning that face.
so CR and CL' would be the same for example
and CR would be the equivilent of x
etc.

just my opinion

I'll second that.  It's simple, easy to understand, and best of all, it makes sense.

    Hey everyone,

I know this is a touchy subject since people prefer different things.

Personally I greatly prefer M,E,S,x,y,z to all other notations since
it is one letter that stands for either a face turn or cube rotation
and once learned is easy to understand.

The catch is the "once learned."  What I want to propose is making the
basis for M,E,S turns, namely the LDF definition, and the basis for
x,y,z, turns, namely the RUF definition the same.

Right now, to know the direction of MES turns you have to know that it
lines up with LDF and to know the direction of xyz rotations you have
to know that they line up with RUF.  Why don't we change the notation
so that both line up with LDF?

This would make it easier to learn MESxyz notation since you could
learn the basis LDF and know how both work.

Of course it seems that all of us MESxyz supporters go by the
speedcubing.com definitions of moves.  I propose changing the bases of
these moves to be the same.  This would make it easier for newer
people to learn and for us people already used to it, I doubt it would
take long to relearn.

Obviously if you don't support MESxyz notation don't feel that you
need to respond.  If you do support this notation please comment.

I think we will all use our different forms of notation, and as long
as you define it on any site where you use it there should be no problem.

I greatly prefer MESxyz notation and will continue to use it on my
site, however I would prefer making the RUF basis for xyz the same as
the LDF basis for MES.

I used to use this alg but now I'm switching. I liked the alg in 
itself, but I can't fit it nicely into the solve. Actually I executed 
it more like this:

x (L' l U R' U' r) (R' U R U') x'

So I started with x and ended with x'. I love what's between them but 
those cube rotations suck. Can you do it without?

    I don't have a problem with the notation because I already know it,
but i do believe it is very counterintuitive.  Maybe the WCA can
decide on and come up with a complete guide to notation?  It would be
nice to be completely standardized, having everyone using the same
notation, no matter what it ends up being.

I can live with MESxyz and use it myself, but yeah, the two different 
bases have been bugging me. But why oh why, do you want LDF and not 
RUF? ;-) For 3x3 two-handed I'm righthanded, thus RUF are my "main" 
faces to turn. We could also use "mes" instead of "xyz" :-)

But I don't mind how things are or how things might change, so don't 
take this too serious...

    a y rotation is a rotation about the vertical axis.  an x rotation is a

    If we use a notation that uses a letter to denominate a certain type
of move, such as C for cube, w is used for two layers, etc. then that
is the only thing which must be defined.

so say we made M followed by a face mean the layer next to that face
turned as if you were turning that face.  So ML is the same as the M
we use now, which is the same as MR',  and MD is the same as the E we
use now, which is the same as MU'.  I know that it adds up to more
letters, but I believe that it is easier to understand.

Likewise, if C were for a cube rotation, CU would be the same as y and etc.

I know I just said pretty much the same thing in another thread, but
it seems to fit here better.

    Personally, I agree with some things that have been said, namely 
relating everything back to the 6 fundamental letters, RUFBDL.  
Although different solutions have different needs.  For example, 
having a definition of M makes a lot of sense to me, since i use the 
Roux Method and lots of Rs rs Ms and Us.  I think for cube turns, CR, 
CR' CR2 makes a lot more sense, and is less counter-intuitive.  From 
a mathematical point of view, it makes less sense, but for a new 
learner, it is a lot easier.

    The one of getting the centers wrong is probably the one you aren't thinking of. I consider that a parity error because, although most good solvers intuitively check for it, it can sometimes rear its ugly head when you start the 3-by F2L (if you go by that method).

    If you're going to keep using MESxyz, I agree it should be standardized, although I myself prefer my own notation. (I'm sure none of you will agree with vR, but hey... I like it.)

    I was just wondering if anyone out there uses Ryan Heise's method for speedcubing, or if anyone uses it, or a similar approach for fewest moves.  I started learning it last evening in an effort to better understand commutators and how my cube works.  As it turns out, I'm having a bit of trouble during the second step.  I can solve all of the edges, but I don't quite understand how to make sure all of the edges are correct while still making sure two of the LL corners are.  It leaves me with 4 incorrect corners in several cases, and 5 incorrect corners in most cases.  I have difficulty with doing the corners in two steps.  If anyone (Ryan included) has any advice to offer, it would be greatly appreciated.  Here's hoping.

    I think that it should all be standardized to be based on RUF.  It 
is easy to see and easy to understand.  I like M,E,S,x,y,z.  I am 
probably one of few that uses m,e, and s to represent things like 
(FB') and similar moves, but it is for that reason that I do not 
agree with making m,e,s the cube rotations.  I believe it would be a 
great idea to come to some sort of standard that is consistent.

&gt; 
&gt; Right now, to know the direction of MES turns you have to know 
that it

have

&gt; so that both line up with LDF?
&gt; 
&gt; This would make it easier to learn MESxyz notation since you could

&gt; 
&gt; Of course it seems that all of us MESxyz supporters go by the

    I continue to agree with evan, using the letter of a face to 
represent turns is much more intuitive that renaming it...but, 
notation also has a lot to do with what metric you solve in, and what 
twisting style you use.  Truly the best thing to have, would just be 
a definition of people's notation, and a universal converter...then 
you could take other people's notation, and put it into your own.  I 
would assume this wouldn't be a challenging program to make.

    Hello!

I use a method similar to Ryan Heise¬¥s for FMC (I use Petrus for 
speedcubing). I looked at his method when I started to learn how to 
solve in few moves. The first step was easy for me as I was used to 
the Petrus-method.

The second step was really hard for me to understand (as Ryan¬¥s site 
is still under construction and no explanations are given). One 
approach that I use is to build a 2x2x1 block in the U-face thus 
leaving you with 3 edges and 4 corners left to solve. Then I solve the 
edges and hope that one corner will solve as well. If not I¬¥m left 
with a corner 4-cycle that I solve with two 3-cycles. Some times I 
just use a LL alg that leaves me with a 3-cycle to finnish with.

I think Ryan explains how to use commuters and conjugates very nicely. 
I also learned from his site. And something that really helped me to 
faster see how to cycle is a trick often used in FMC. Put little 
numbered stickers on the corners that need cycling to better see how 
they need to be cycled. For a good explanation check: http://games.
groups.yahoo.com/group/fewestmoveschallenge/message/403 

Using that same sticker trick it¬¥s easier to cycle 4 or 5 corners 
around. For 4-cycle only 1-&gt;2 or 2-&gt;3 etc. is needed (in other words 
you only have to place on corner in its right position) and for 
5-cycles any 3-cycle is good (2-&gt;3-&gt;4 or 5-&gt;1-&gt;2 etc.)
And if you happened to get all corners but have edges to cycle there 
are similar commutators that work with edges.

I hope I make any sence,
Mikael

    I dunno, to me Gosbee was making it look like there is this division 
in cubing, the OS vs. NS, and that the OS is concentrated more on 
God's algorithm, while the NS is the devious youth that rips off of 
the OS just to be apart of the rekindled fad.  In all honesty, there 
really isn't a division at all in this community.  Sure we have 
people who have been cubing in the early 80's but the ultimate goals 
are still the same.  Yes the methods have changed, the alg generation 
has changed, but we all are focused on becoming faster, and the hunt 
for gods algorithm is still being searched.  

I guess thats the glory of film in the editing room.

    Hello Michael,

I keep telling the speedcubers here that x,y,z and MES confuse people
but few people seem willing to acknowledge that.

I use the same notation on the 3x3x3 as the one commonly accepted for
the 4x4x4, that is, lower case letters r, l, f, b, u and d are for
slices. 

To this I add "Q" for cube rotatations, so QR means rotate the entire
cube clockwise 90 degrees like you would turn the right side clockwise.

Even though most speedcubers will spend incredible amounts of time and
energy  simplifing every other aspect of cubing, most will not budge
on notation - go figure.

Regards,

David J

&gt; Does anybody have any algorithms that can help me in this situation? 
&gt; I've managed to come up with my own, but these I can't figure out.

These algs leave the edges where they are.
 
&gt; 1) LL Algorithm that re-orients two incorrectly oriented edge pieces
&gt; opposite eachother on the LL, preserving LL corners' orientations.

Flipping over two edges can be done several ways.

I use lower case letters to mean slices only.

An easy way for two edges flipped (across) is the old r U r U r D2d2 r
U r U r U2.

There's a general idea that what you do to one piece you undo to the
other:
1. R' d' R2 d2 R' flips over one edge without changing anything on the
Last Level. 
2. then you put any of the other LL edes where the newly flipped ege
is: U U2 OR U'
3. then flip over the second edge by undoing the first part: R d2 R2 d R 
4. then put the first edge back in place U' U2 OR U.

&gt; 2) LL Algorithm that re-orients all of the edge pieces on the LL,
&gt; preserving corners' orientations.

r U2 r' U2 r U r' U2 r U2 r' U'

I hope that helps.

Regards,

David J

    I started learning the 5 position corners algorithms yesterday.  They are
much easier to learn than I expected.  Also I realised that on my site I
don't show the positions in the easiest to recognise way.  Each of the
possible positions is just a swap of a pair of corners.  Which means that if
a pair of adjacent corners are correctly placed then its the other two
corners that need swapping.  If no two adjacent corners are correctly placed
then its diagonal corners that need swapping.  Its so easy to recognise.  I
had been messing about trying to recognise 3-cycles of corners which is just
that bit more painful (and time consuming).

I'm discounting the trivial case (corners already correctly positioned) in
the above when you just pass straight through to step 3.

This easy-to-recognise-ness means that my concern about combining steps 2
and 3, namely that the positions would be hard to recognise, will definitely
not be a problem (as someone already pointed out I seem to remember!).

    Hey Chris.. I really agree with you that M,E,S would make more sense 
if you define them by the RUF defenition.. But that's also just 
because I never really learned the M E S moves, because they are so 
confusing.. I think I would learn them if they were defined by the R 
U F :). However, it will probably be very hard to standardize this 
notation, because a lot of people out there are totaly used to M E S 
moves.

Just wanted to let you know, I agree with you..

&gt; Hey everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I know this is a touchy subject since people prefer different 
things.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally I greatly prefer M,E,S,x,y,z to all other notations 
since
&gt; it is one letter that stands for either a face turn or cube 
rotation
&gt; and once learned is easy to understand.
&gt; 
&gt; The catch is the "once learned."  What I want to propose is making 
the
&gt; basis for M,E,S turns, namely the LDF definition, and the basis for
&gt; x,y,z, turns, namely the RUF definition the same.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now, to know the direction of MES turns you have to know 
that it
&gt; lines up with LDF and to know the direction of xyz rotations you 
have
&gt; to know that they line up with RUF.  Why don't we change the 
notation
&gt; so that both line up with LDF?
&gt; 
&gt; This would make it easier to learn MESxyz notation since you could
&gt; learn the basis LDF and know how both work.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course it seems that all of us MESxyz supporters go by the
&gt; speedcubing.com definitions of moves.  I propose changing the 
bases of
&gt; these moves to be the same.  This would make it easier for newer
&gt; people to learn and for us people already used to it, I doubt it 
would
&gt; take long to relearn.
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously if you don't support MESxyz notation don't feel that you
&gt; need to respond.  If you do support this notation please comment.
&gt; 
&gt; I think we will all use our different forms of notation, and as 
long
&gt; as you define it on any site where you use it there should be no 
problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I greatly prefer MESxyz notation and will continue to use it on my
&gt; site, however I would prefer making the RUF basis for xyz the same 
as
&gt; the LDF basis for MES.

Don't forget me!
I'm left-handed not only in cubing, but in about all other activities 
which concern assimmetry: writing, eating etc.

But I one-handed cube better with the right hand. Actually I'm not any 
better at one-handed cubing that any other cuber, so that probably 
doesn't count.

I'm definitely for R U F. NOt only that 90% right-handed make a clear 
majority, but I'm accustomed to seeing a cube from the RUF 
perspective, not LUF. And anyway the three most used faces are in my 
opinion R U L, so the true argument for R U F is that we see them.

Hi Chris,

It's nice to see that you're willing to change to lessen the
confusion, but why not go all the way with it? I have to ask, other
than being used to it, why do you want a system which isn't intuitive
and requires learning new letters?

Even if you switch xyz to mean different axes you still aren't using
the coordinates the way they have been used traditionally.

I know that trades have historically hidden their knowledge behind
lingo, deliberately making things hard to learn for newcomers, but
does speedcubing have to be that way?

    The Meffert's Limited Edition Professort Cube for me it's the best..I've got 
mine about one year ago, and since then, it is with me wherever I go..It's 
true that it's a lot hard to move in the very beggining, but with some lub 
it become perfect..but that's just my opinion.. 

www.mefferts.com 

The delivery is very fast. I live in Brazil, outside U.S. and it came to me 
in 10 days..look for yourself!

any more suggestions/recommendations, anyone? 

again, I want to know which is a good 5x5 cube to buy. I played with 
the Rubiks.com one a few days ago, and It was stiff.... any better 
ones out there? 

and how do I buy an east sheen cube? do they have a website for the 
transactions? 

Thanks, 

Gautam

&gt; I just recently saw 5x5's at Barnes and Noble for sale for $30.  If

    I wouldn't mind learning this new notation, but i have found one 
problem. There are many websites out there that use these moves. Lets 
say we change their meaning. How will someone know if the webpage

&gt; Hey everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I know this is a touchy subject since people prefer different 
things.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally I greatly prefer M,E,S,x,y,z to all other notations since
&gt; it is one letter that stands for either a face turn or cube rotation
&gt; and once learned is easy to understand.
&gt; 
&gt; The catch is the "once learned."  What I want to propose is making 
the
&gt; basis for M,E,S turns, namely the LDF definition, and the basis for
&gt; x,y,z, turns, namely the RUF definition the same.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now, to know the direction of MES turns you have to know that 
it
&gt; lines up with LDF and to know the direction of xyz rotations you 
have
&gt; to know that they line up with RUF.  Why don't we change the 
notation
&gt; so that both line up with LDF?
&gt; 
&gt; This would make it easier to learn MESxyz notation since you could
&gt; learn the basis LDF and know how both work.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course it seems that all of us MESxyz supporters go by the
&gt; speedcubing.com definitions of moves.  I propose changing the bases 
of
&gt; these moves to be the same.  This would make it easier for newer
&gt; people to learn and for us people already used to it, I doubt it 
would
&gt; take long to relearn.
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously if you don't support MESxyz notation don't feel that you
&gt; need to respond.  If you do support this notation please comment.
&gt; 
&gt; I think we will all use our different forms of notation, and as long
&gt; as you define it on any site where you use it there should be no 
problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I greatly prefer MESxyz notation and will continue to use it on my
&gt; site, however I would prefer making the RUF basis for xyz the same 
as
&gt; the LDF basis for MES.

    Hopefully it would be possible to send them emails and get them to
change it (yeah right).  If that doesn't work then hopefully they have
a deffinition on their site (rare).  Other than that, you pretty much
have to know, or figure it out (eek).  So yeah, transitioning wouldn't
be easy, then again transition to the metric system, or to euros, etc.
probably wasn't easy either (parentheses).  I wonder if we will ever
come up with something or if it will just stay this way and we will
argue over it forever (this is probably one of the hotter threads ever
in the group).

I'm not too picky what it ends up being (although I do prefer the way
that I have stated in previous messages), I would just like a
standard.

    Hi Duncan,

As always my interest in the cube is a roller coaster, but at the moment 
this interest seems to begin turning upwards again.

I'm still dealing with step 3 and unlike you I'm doing it with the FL 
down. I've also tried to do some right hand optimizations and these are 
the algs I like best for step 3 at the moment:

UUU - R' U' R' U' R U R U R
UFU - (U) r R' U R U' r' R U R'
UUF - (U) r U' r' U' r R' U R U r'
UFF - (U2) r' U' R' U' R' U R U r
FUU - r U' r' R U2 r R' U' r'
FFU - r' U' R' U' R U R U r
FUF - (U) F U' r U' r' R U R' U F'
FFF - R2 U' f R' F f' R F' U R2

Most of them feels awesome to execute.

Step 1 still feels like the real bottleneck in this but I haven't 
practiced it much to be honest (if at all).

When thinking of combining steps 2 and 3 I guess you assume both edges 
being the LL right? Having edges out of the LL is of course a problem in 
all but step 1 and I wonder how you deal with this. Do you avoid this in 
some clever way?

Maybe I could run some calculations with ACube for combining steps 2 and 
3 and see what the result is. It is a pretty tedious job to write down 
the setup positions though so it might not happen any time soon (if at all).

I'm still very much in love with this method and I think it could be 
really awesome if step 1 could be mastered. I hope I pull myself 
together and try to learn it more seriously :)

&gt;I started learning the 5 position corners algorithms yesterday.  They are
&gt;much easier to learn than I expected.  Also I realised that on my site I
&gt;don't show the positions in the easiest to recognise way.  Each of the
&gt;possible positions is just a swap of a pair of corners.  Which means that if
&gt;a pair of adjacent corners are correctly placed then its the other two
&gt;corners that need swapping.  If no two adjacent corners are correctly placed
&gt;then its diagonal corners that need swapping.  Its so easy to recognise.  I
&gt;had been messing about trying to recognise 3-cycles of corners which is just
&gt;that bit more painful (and time consuming).
&gt;
&gt;I'm discounting the trivial case (corners already correctly positioned) in
&gt;the above when you just pass straight through to step 3.
&gt;
&gt;This easy-to-recognise-ness means that my concern about combining steps 2
&gt;and 3, namely that the positions would be hard to recognise, will definitely
&gt;not be a problem (as someone already pointed out I seem to remember!).

    Oh... one more thing. How sure are you about that combining steps 2 and 
3 gives about 48 cases? Are you taking into considerations the many 
combinations the edges can be placed in the middle layer? If not, there 
will probably be lots more combinations (thinking ZB). I'm to tired to 
do any actual calculations right now but I might look into it more in 
the morning.

    Hi Gustav,
By combining steps 2 and 3 I mean having a single step where you put in one
middle edge but position LL corners and orient LL edges at the same time.
So altogether there would only be three middle edge/LL steps.  I guess you
would do the first middle edge as a Fridrich F2L pair.
You lose a whole step (about 10 moves) but have to add back in the
gains/losses from doing that Fridrich pair as opposed to doing a corner as
part of the first layer.  I believe a total improvement of maybe 6 moves.
It would be great if we could get together to work out some of the missing
algorithms for this.

I think it is too hard to try to put two middle edges in at the same time -
too many cases for me to learn anyway!

Once I sat down and seriously startede to learn Step 1 it was easier than I
expected.  I learned 3-6 algorithms a day.  I go through them in my head
when I wake up every morning!

I'm thinking of improving the site a bit soon.

Good luck.

Duncan

&gt; Oh... one more thing. How sure are you about that combining steps 2 and
&gt; 3 gives about 48 cases? Are you taking into considerations the many
&gt; combinations the edges can be placed in the middle layer? If not, there
&gt; will probably be lots more combinations (thinking ZB). I'm to tired to

I¬¥ve seen L2L mentioned a few times but this thread has made me

this method though, is there any sites about L2L?

    Hi Duncan,

Yeah i understod that as soon as I had gone to bed. But by then it was 
too great of an effort to get up, turn on the computer, and correct my 
mistake :) Thats what you get for staying up too late :)

I will look more into setting up ACube in a few hours. Maybe it's not 
that tedious after all (things allways seem easier when your mind is 
rested). I'll get back to you.

&gt;Hi Gustav,
&gt;By combining steps 2 and 3 I mean having a single step where you put in one
&gt;middle edge but position LL corners and orient LL edges at the same time.
&gt;So altogether there would only be three middle edge/LL steps.  I guess you
&gt;would do the first middle edge as a Fridrich F2L pair.
&gt;You lose a whole step (about 10 moves) but have to add back in the
&gt;gains/losses from doing that Fridrich pair as opposed to doing a corner as
&gt;part of the first layer.  I believe a total improvement of maybe 6 moves.
&gt;It would be great if we could get together to work out some of the missing
&gt;algorithms for this.
&gt;
&gt;I think it is too hard to try to put two middle edges in at the same time -
&gt;too many cases for me to learn anyway!
&gt;
&gt;Once I sat down and seriously startede to learn Step 1 it was easier than I
&gt;expected.  I learned 3-6 algorithms a day.  I go through them in my head
&gt;when I wake up every morning!
&gt;
&gt;I'm thinking of improving the site a bit soon.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck.

    Hi Mikael,

The only complete description I know of is on Duncans site: 
http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/cubertscubicle . The method we are 
currently discussing is L2L4 and combining steps 2 and 3 of it. Maybe a 
new name Duncan? Duncan's site seems to be invisible to google so it's 
not that easy to find :) I'll probably put up information of it on 
www.svekub.se (home of the Swedish Cube Association), but I wan't to 
learn more algs first.

What I mainly like about this method is the small number of steps, and 
the fairly small amount of moves is a bonus too. Not too much algs to 
learn, but I'm not too happy wth step 1 being relatively big and 
intuitive. But hey... you can't have them all :)

Yeah, after Chris's recent offer to delete our posts if we tell him, I

worthwhile to mention it again :-)

Btw, I just realized there are people out there reading as mails, not

could've both been deleted on the web subsequently).

You could break it in half a few times. Well, a saw might be better. 
Destroy the cube kernel inside so you can can transfer not only the 
edges and corners but also the centers to a new kernel with screws. 
Ok, I'm not that serious, but I am indeed thinking of trying it. I 
might use a cheap clone cube to steal the kernel (and its 
screws/springs) from...

Hey Chris, I had a closer look at the rivets that came with the DIY. 
It's built so that it's probably impossible to pull them out but it's 
possible to push them in (what a surprise, how would they get it in in 
the first place otherwise?) so if your cube is too loose you should 
indeed be able to tighten them by pushing the rivets in deeper.

Cheers!

    Hi Mikael,
L2L (Last 2 Layers) is a strategy I developed last year.  Gustav and others
have helped with producing the algorithms needed to make it work but none of
us have learned all of them well enough to speedcube with it yet (not that
there are many - we just don't have that much time!).

I think my site is the only one (see Gustav's link).  I haven't registered
it with any search engines but after some success registering another site I
will get round to it eventually!

Gustav - I had thought of calling it L2L compact or something like.  Open to
any suggestions for a cool name though!

    Hey!

IMHO the Rubiks.com 5x5x5 are the best. Particularly if ur style is 
more wrist action than fingertricks. If ur style is mostly 
fingertricks and outer slice turns mostly i guess the eastsheen is 
maybe better.

But !!! It takes a few months to break in a Rubiks.com 5x5x5. So 
don't give up just because it's really stiff initially. It could be 
a dream cube if u are patient with it (and expose ur wrists to some 
pain while breaking it in ;-) ). Also i think the eastsheens are 
much more prone to popping when they become too loose ... On the 
other hand the cubies on easteheens never break. On Rubiks.com once 
a while a centercubie might snap. But it's not too difficult to glue 
with superglue either ...

Some say the mefferts cubes are better cause the tension is 
adjustable. On Rubiks.com the middle centers are attaced to the core 
with rivets, not screws like on the mefferts ones. But those cubes 
on the other hand are tiled. So if u don't like the tiles or the 
colorscheme used u have quite a job ... *sigh*

It's truelly not too easy to decide. Try all of them ... lol :D

    I don't know about the name yet. L2L4 sounds a bit technical and not 
very fun. And adding compact doesn't make it much better :) I'll think 
about it.

Doing the setups for the combining steps 2 and 3 were not at all as 
tedious as I first imagined. I simply combined my previous setups into 
48 new lines and it was made in less than 10 minutes. Calculating it all 
took about half an hour (poor computer is all hot now).

If I've done it all correctly, the average number of moves is (in 
HTM)... *drumroll* : ~11.04

So it means cutting moves about 8.5 moves in average. But then of course 
some moves will be added for the extended first layer. Total moves for 
L2L4 compact is then about 30 + "number of moves to complete first layer 
+ 1 edge".

    Hi Gustav,
That was quick!  Fantastic.  My estimates have been based on the 30 moves
plus first layer plus one edge.
Any chance you could send me your results (e-mail on the website)?
Any format you like.  If you're not using my orientation I will translate
them.

Best wishes

    I'll send them over soon. I'm doing a new search at the moment, not just 
finding one optimal solution, but several. Will take a bit more time

&gt;
&gt;&gt;I don't know about the name yet. L2L4 sounds a bit technical and not
&gt;&gt;very fun. And adding compact doesn't make it much better :) I'll think
&gt;&gt;about it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Doing the setups for the combining steps 2 and 3 were not at all as
&gt;&gt;tedious as I first imagined. I simply combined my previous setups into
&gt;&gt;48 new lines and it was made in less than 10 minutes. Calculating it all
&gt;&gt;took about half an hour (poor computer is all hot now).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If I've done it all correctly, the average number of moves is (in
&gt;&gt;HTM)... *drumroll* : ~11.04
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So it means cutting moves about 8.5 moves in average. But then of course
&gt;&gt;some moves will be added for the extended first layer. Total moves for
&gt;&gt;L2L4 compact is then about 30 + "number of moves to complete first layer
&gt;&gt;+ 1 edge".
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;/Gustav Fredell

&gt; colorscheme used u have quite a job ... *sigh*

Aren't tiles an advantage because you can look around edges? And 
aren't they a lot more beautiful, too? And to switch to the normal 
Rubik colorscheme you only need to swap two adjacent colors, that is 
only 15 tiles (actually only 13 because you can swap the center caps 
when you open the centers for adjusting the screws). I think I can do 
that faster than you can wear in your Rubik 5x5 (what did you say? 
months? ;-).

found only the dan harris's video on his site. Does
anyone know of anyplace where i can get such videos?
the official site also dosent seem to have it.

    Hi there

I am looking for a few good algs to shuffle center cubies on a 4x4x4 cube.

The method I use is based on the corners first method listed on Jaap's
site:  http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cube4.htm#corner

1.  Solve 2 opposite centers (which will be L and R centers in step 3).

2.  Solve the corners.

3.  Solve all the L edges, Solve all R edges.

4.  Solve 3 l edges, then last l edge.

5.  Solve the 4 r edges.

6.  Separate remaining centers into groups of opposite faces( eg, if
solving the green, blue white and yellow centers, group center
facelets so that blue and green go together, white and yellow go together)

7.  Solve centers.

At this point, for step 6, I use 1 alg to move one center cubie from
the U face to the F face to eventually separate the blue/green group
from the white/yellow group.  This process can get pretty tedious.

for step 7, I solve opposite centers by swaping cubies as outlined in
 Jaaps solution.  This involves applying a single alg repeatedly.

In step 6, I used to ensure that as I separated the groups, that each
 group ended up in the correct face, so that blue or green cubies get
sent to either the blue or green face.  Now, I am incorporating algs
that swap whole center groups (from the pretty patterns section on
Jaap's pages) to the process.  That way, if I have 3 blue or green
center cubies in the white face, and one blue cubie in a blue or green
face, I can complete the blue green group with one cubie swap, and
eventually do an appropriate center group swap later, rather than 
doing 3 cubie swaps to get those 3 blue greens from the white face to
 the blue or green face.

At this point, the whole center cubie separation process is still a
bit tricky, and could be a bit more efficient.  

I am wondering if anyone knows of some algs that will swap multiple
center cubies between 2 faces?  for example, swap Fur + Fdr with Ubl +
Ufr.  In other words, algs that swap more than one but less than four
center cubies between adjacent or opposite faces.

    Not that big, but over 200KB and some mail systems seems to object to 
that. Sent the mail yesterday afternoon but now I've put it up on 
http://www.svekub.se/L2L4c.txt instead. Below is the the test from the mail:

Hi Duncan,

Calculations are finished now and attached are a lot of algorithms. The 
file also contains a lot of "junk"-algorithms and may well contain a lot 
of duplicates. There should be at least one optimal (in HTM) algoritm 
for each case though.

The numbering is like this: First number is the step 3 pattern and the 
second is the step 2 pattern. 2.3 is then UUF and switching the two 
right corners. They should also hopefully be converted to your solving 
preferences. (edit: this might not be entirely accurate since I might be 
confused because we use a different setup. But there should be some 
system to it :))

Please let me know of any errors or so and keep me updated on your 
thougts, progress and ideas.

any signifigent advantages for any given starting
color.  Eventually we're familiar enough with our own
starting to color, that the color sticks out to us.  

Just my 2 cents,

    Honestly, I don't think there are major advantages, but white is so
glaringly different from the rest that it is easier to spot out, in my
opinion.

However, I am colorblind, so picking white may save me a second or two.

&gt; Not that big, but over 200KB and some mail systems seems to object to
&gt; that. Sent the mail yesterday afternoon but now I've put it up on

mail:
&gt;
&gt; Hi Duncan,
&gt;
&gt; Calculations are finished now and attached are a lot of algorithms. The
&gt; file also contains a lot of "junk"-algorithms and may well contain a lot
&gt; of duplicates. There should be at least one optimal (in HTM) algoritm
&gt; for each case though.
&gt;
&gt; The numbering is like this: First number is the step 3 pattern and the
&gt; second is the step 2 pattern. 2.3 is then UUF and switching the two
&gt; right corners. They should also hopefully be converted to your solving
&gt; preferences. (edit: this might not be entirely accurate since I might be
&gt; confused because we use a different setup. But there should be some
&gt; system to it :))
&gt;
&gt; Please let me know of any errors or so and keep me updated on your
&gt; thougts, progress and ideas.

    I start with a white cross in Fridrich, white on bottom with Petrus, white on bottom with red and orange as left and right for Roux and either white or yellow on bottom with corners first, depending on which looks easier.  When I solve for few moves with Ryan Heise's method, though, I do try to be completely color neutral and go with what has the most that looks easy at the beginning, though I'm still usually able to see white or yellow on bottom easiest.

    I always start with white, but the color white isn't as important to
me, it's more important that I end with yellow.  If I cube with a
different color scheme (white opposite blue), then I always start with
green so that I can still end with yellow.

So I guess ending with yellow is more how I view it, rather than
starting with white.

    I posted earlier that I start with blue.  If I see a
very obvious/simple cross or xCross for green, I'll
solve for green.  Since the edge pair colors are
somewhat similiar if I hyperfocus I can keep on top of
things :P

    'You + the cube = never.'

Alternately, you could mention something about the number of combinations, divided by the number of times people tell you that is something similar to 1.  I'm bad at math, but those are a few ideas.  I'll keep working on it.

  Hey,

  Does anybody have a good response for when they are asked:

  "I know there is a mathematical equation that solves the cube.  What is 
  it?"

  I get asked this on a regular basis and I haven't been able to come up 
  with any clever reply for it.

    Ya i also have the same question. One day i was cubing
in the train and a person next to me claimed that he
knew how to solve it because someone had told him "a"
trick. Now i dont know what is that single trick to
solve the cube, considering that we have so many OLL
and PLL algs!Anyway still what could be a nice answer
for these pestering ppl? F**k off?

&gt; Just curious, what color do most of you do the cross with, I used
&gt; green, from watching solving videos it seems like most people do white.

I start with blue and end with green. I think the very first method I
learned way back when used blue as the starting color.

    With fridrich, i start with a white cross, with petrus, i am color

    Well, it all depends on what method you use, for the petrus method, 
you work in very small intuitive steps through the whole solution, 
and you adapt on the fly, but with fridrich, i've found that it's a 
lot harder to be color neutral with the fridrich method and with the 
roux method...it just doesn't work as well, but i have no problems 
being color neutral with your method.  There aren't any truly hard 
looks in your method, and with the fridrich method, it makes it a lot 
easier to identify cases throughout the entire solve, i would imagine 
especially the OLL section.

    Off the top of my head, you might claim that "it has been shown that 
a proof of the Reimann-Zeta Hypothesis [or some equally difficult math 
problem] would necessarily have 'God's Algorithm' as a 
consequence..."  That would shush all bu the most persistant.  
  You could also do a preemtive strike: "I dunno, I just got tired of
