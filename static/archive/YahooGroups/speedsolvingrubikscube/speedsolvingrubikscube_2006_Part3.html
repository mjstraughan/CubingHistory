  Hi Rune<br>
<br>
  For comparison (and because I don&#x27;t orient the cross myself), I also <br>
  found the distributions for the case of an unoriented cross (4 solved <br>
  positions):<br>
<br>
  SHTM, unoriented<br>
  0: 4<br>
  1: 72<br>
  2: 812<br>

<br>
  HTM, unoriented<br>
  0: 4<br>
  1: 48<br>

Hey Frank,

will you please bring 6x6 cubes for all of us? :-)

Cheers!

It was only a few minutes&#x27; extra &quot;work&quot; (and a few seconds&#x27; CPU time) 
to get them.  I haven&#x27;t really thought about the results yet.

          <div class="email-content">Nah, why should I be afraid? Maybe your famous early philosophers and 
mathematicians distort my picture of today&#x27;s Greece but I thought it&#x27;s 
a quite peaceful and safe country :-). I was just kidding cause Frank 
said he&#x27;ll do a little business over there and he&#x27;s into large cubes 
(doesn&#x27;t he even have a 6x6 of you already?). Don&#x27;t have enough money 
to visit Greece or buy one of your prototypes, I&#x27;m just hoping your 
regular production and sales will start soon so I can finally 
blindsolve the thing. Any new estimations about when they&#x27;ll be ready? 
Does Meffert&#x27;s announcement have something to do with your cubes?

Cheers!
Stefan

I recently got myself a 4x4x4 cube and now I&#x27;m trying to find a way to <br>

However - and if I understand correctly - there exist those &quot;colour neutral&quot; ones (Chris H e.g.?), who does the easiest cross and at the end relates it to the middle. In that case a possible slice move is very frequent and the difference between averages in HTM and STM ought to be about one move. Or?

  It was only a few minutes&#x27; extra &quot;work&quot; (and a few seconds&#x27; CPU time) 
  to get them.  I haven&#x27;t really thought about the results yet.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Kenneth :-)

I did some counting in the past and i was around 150-160 moves on 
avg as far as i can recall it. The problem with counting is that u 
are tempted to do clever moves and now ur normal routine. But i was 
counting while solving reasonably fast so it shouldn&#x27;t be very 
biased. I seem to recall that Chris Hardwick did some counting in 
the past too and had about 125-130 moves or so on average.

I compensate for my high number of moves with a higher turn rate. I 
have much easier recognition with my cage method than with pairing-
up edges. So don&#x27;t be focused solely on number of moves though it&#x27;s 
an ok measure for what speed u are likely to achieve :-)

Cheers!

For a cross on the D face, I simply mean that one further D move may be 
needed to get the RFLB colours of the cross to line up with their 
respective centres.

I use &quot;working corner&quot;, so the cross orientation is unimportant to me.

> &lt;versus> the easiest cross

That&#x27;s a more interesting (and harder) problem.  I&#x27;ll think about it, 
but I suspect that the calculation would take a lot of computer time.

You are doing either, for orient and orientate have the same meaning in non-technical senses. 

These two verbs, drawn from the same base (French orienter &#x27;to place facing the east&#x27;, originally used of the placement of churches) have developed the same extended sense &#x27;to familiarize with or adjust to new surroundings or circumstances&#x27;. The shorter form arose in the eighteenth century, the longer in the nineteenth. Orientate is sometimes criticized, but it is fully standard and has been used by a variety of major authors, including W.H. Auden, Margret Mead, Tennessee Williams, and Aldous Huxley. It is probably more common in England, while orient seems to be the preferred form in the United States. 

Robert Burchfield, for many years the Chief Editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, has written that &quot;I have decided to use the shorter form myself in all contexts, but the saving is not great. And one can have no fundamental quarrel with anyone who decides to use the longer of the two words.&quot;

  Yes, that must be a tuff job. The choice of &quot;the easiest cross&quot; is a capricious, human choice, not so easy (impossible?) to define in a program. Don´t overstrain yorself!

If &quot;easiest&quot; = &quot;the cross that takes the fewest moves&quot;, it is well 
defined.  For choosing between a named pair of crosses (which I think 
is what Chris does: yellow/white), the number of states involved is only

(12!/4!) * 2^8 = 5.1e9

For each of these you&#x27;d look up the number of turns needed to solve the 
2 crosses, and take the smaller value as being the distance 
from &quot;solved&quot;.  Memory requirements are negligible (just the look-up 
table).

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris!

Well, at least u could save some moves if u knew all the OLL cases 
so that u reduce that to one single step :-)

Actually i believe that a turn rate of about 3 move/sec should be 
possible somehow with lots of practice on a good cube. Main obstacle 
here i guess is slow recognition for pairing up edges. A high 
turnrate is a bit easier on the other steps. Looking for next (2) 
edges to pair up while working on the current pairing is a good 
strategy. Generally, better lookahead means higher speed :-) 
Sometimes it&#x27;s worth practicing solely on the lookahead and not 
worry about the time ;-)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Mike, Rune,

Yes I do always look at yellow and white and choose the best cross 
of the two.

My choice of cross pretty much always follows this line of thinking:

1) If one side has an extended cross solution I will always choose 
that side.  If both sides have an extended cross I choose the one 
with the fewer moves (or the faster one, if one involves a good 
finger trick in the middle, even if this one is longer in moves).

2) If I don&#x27;t see an extended cross for either side, I choose the 
side with the least number of flipped edges.  A flipped edge is 
defined as an edge that requires at a minimum two moves to be placed 
onto the cross face correctly oriented.

3) If both sides have an equal (or roughly equal) number of flipped 
edges, I choose the side that has the highest number of cross pieces 
already placed correctly oriented on the cross face (even if they 
are not in the correct positions in relation to eachother).  If both 
sides have some number of flipped edges, and neither side has any 
correctly oriented cross pieces on the cross face, I would always 
choose the side with the fewer number of flipped edges.  If both 
have the same number of flipped edges at this point I try to get a 
feel for which cross is faster or easier, or will have a corner or 
an edge both from the same pair end up in the U layer (I do cross on 
bottom).

That&#x27;s pretty much it.  I mean you can intuit this during inspection 
as a cross just feels &quot;easier&quot; then the other.  But if I had to 
describe to a computer program what I look for, those steps are what 
I would say.

Maybe do a search on each cross that is maximum 8-9 moves deep to 
look for an extended cross.  If that fails on both sides count the 
flipped edges.  If one side has 2 or more flipped edges than the 
other side choose the side with the fewest number of flipped edges.  
If both sides are equal, or if one side only has 1 more flipped edge 
than the other, then look into the number of correctly oriented 
cross edges on the cross face to help with that decision.  If that 
number is equal choose the side with the fewest flipped edges.  If 
THAT number is also equal then choose the side with the shorter 
cross solution.  If THAT numbe is still equal choose the side that 
uses the msot parallel layer turns.  So stuff like R&#x27; L U F2 B2 
would be better than B2 R&#x27; U L F2 because the other move uses 
parallel layer turns rather than alternating on all axes.  You could 
do this on computer by using the cross with the shortest STM count.

Just my two cents,
Chris

Yes, though it would take a lot longer.  There are approximately 9.8e11 
states.  Admittedly, you could reduce that by a factor of nearly 48 
(for symmetry)...

ChrisH: Thanks for expanding on your method -- I think I&#x27;d just have to 
go by the STM distance, as you suggest.  Different people will probably 
have different heuristics for deciding which cross to do. ;)

any problem because it keeps all the other pieces aligned and they do not

Si if you intend to keep it good, I suggest you to leave the inside piece

So special thanks to Chris Pelley, we&#x27;ve got a website for US Nationals 
2006:

http://www.chrisandkori.us/fw/main/U_S_Nationals_2006-1504.html

Go ahead and register online.  The website should contain all the 
information for everything.  I&#x27;m still working on competitor discounts 
for museum admission.  We&#x27;ll update that information on the website as 
it develops.

          <div class="email-content">I actually hadn&#x27;t thought about it.  I think different scrambles are  
fine.  The reason is if you&#x27;re going to make the finals, you&#x27;ll  
definitely make the second round.  The only people who it would affect  
are the people on the borderline of making it into the semifinal round,  
and those people generally have no chance of placing in the competition  
so it will not affect the results of the competition.

I like to compare everything to running.  They have the 100 meter  
sprint finals in a bunch of heats.  But the wind isn&#x27;t consistent  
everywhere.  In any case, the fastest runners will easily advance in  
the worst of conditions.

More importantly, what if Saturday gets incredibly easy scrambles 
while Friday gets &quot;unlucky&quot; scrambles?

I am curious to know the answer, but I think it will be close to 1/(10^10)

    Btw. You can easily calculate the probabilities. For 1-, 2-, 6- and 7-move cross the probabilities are 0.0000789, 0.0008312, 0.511648 and 0.183954 resp.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Unless u intend to tell judges that one of ur corners is broken u 
won&#x27;t run into any problem! Even if u do tell it&#x27;s broken i can&#x27;t 
see u getting into trouble with it. Just say it&#x27;s a modification to 
make it turn faster. Modified cubes are allowed :-) It must look 
like the normal cube and have 6 colors and so on. If that is ok then 
the cube is fine for competitions.

If someone seriously thinks a 5x5x5 with broken corner is not 
allowed then let me know what rule(s) in the regulations say(s) so :D

Cheers!

      What is the probability to have 5 very easy scrambles (assuming everyone<br>
      uses the Fridrich Method and that an easy scramble is defined by a &quot;2-move<br>
      cross&quot;) while 5 other scrambles will have very bad crosses (6-move cross<br>
      let&#x27;s say).<br>
      Gilles.<br>
<br>
      Is a 6-move cross really that bad?<br>
      Btw. You can easily calculate the probabilities. For 1-, 2-, 6- and 7-move cross the probabilities are 0.0000789, 0.0008312, 0.511648 and 0.183954 resp.<br>
     Ergo: The probability (two moves or less)  (0.0000789+0.0008312)^5=6.24x10^-16<br>
              The probability (six moves or more) (0.511648+0.183954)^5=1.62x10^-1<br>
   Proportion roughly 4x10^15   (Which relevance does Fridrich have here?).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

Let&#x27;s say it does happen... is it anyone&#x27;s fault?  No one can predict 
the scrambles for Friday or Saturday.  So right now, at this very 
moment, the scrambles for Friday and Saturday are both easy and hard.  
Furthermore, the difficulty of Saturday&#x27;s scrambles are independent of 
Friday&#x27;s scrambles.

It would be very unfortunate if Leyan fails to advance to the final 
round because he competed on Friday instead of Saturday.  But I believe 
it&#x27;s fair.  No one did anything intentionally.  Consider the scrambles 
like the weather.

  I will not compete, but I think that different scrambles are not a big problem, if they&#x27;re all random.

  All I have done to the cube is lube it, but for some reason it won&#x27;t stay together. Today I had to take off the center pieces and tighten the cube TWICE because just using it for 20 minutes causes it to get looser (ie the screws loosen up, i guess?).<br>
   <br>
  If I don&#x27;t keep tightening it, it gets so loose that it can&#x27;t really be used. Just now the cube literally FELL APART and I had to reconstruct the upper half of it and tighten all of the screws. <br>
   <br>
  The thing is, though, it doesn&#x27;t even seem like the amount that the screws loosen is compareable to how loose the cube gets. It seems that the cube gets looser than it should be given the amount that the screws come out. Or maybe I&#x27;m wrong about that.<br>
  <br>
Has anyone had any problems like this? I dont even enjoy solving the 4x4 beacuse I have to be constantly fixing it.<br>

          <div class="email-content">If advancement to second round was based on average or mean and if the 
top 36 out of all results advanced, then I would say you need the same 
scrambles from Friday to Saturday.

However, since advancement is based on single fastest time, then 
different scrambles seems non-problematic. It also helps avoid the 
temptation to cheat that Lars mentioned (videotape Friday, analyze, 
memorize for Saturday).

I&#x27;m not quite sure the 100-meter analogy holds up. Different solves 
will have different path lengths depending on how one solves it. If I 
get a lucky solve, it increases my chance of advancing. However, that 
can happen in the different Friday scrambles as much as between Friday 
or Saturday. (&quot;Hey, I got a lucky solve on #2). 

So, it&#x27;s more like I only have to run 90 meters in heat #1 versus 100 
meters if I had been in heat #2. Yes, wind/heat have an effect in 
racing but not the 10-20% effect that a lucky solve can have. 

It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m advancing to the second round anyway, but it&#x27;s an 
interesting question.

Quick confirmation: advancement to second round will be top 36 overall 
from both days (not 36 from each day or 18 from each day)??

involved two rubik&#x27;s cubes. The magician handed one to a celebrity and<br>
the both mixed them up behind their backs and afterwards they were<br>

I guess he means one of following 3 :

- megaminx (dodecahedron puzzle)

- pyraminx (tetrahedron/pyramid puzzle)

- tetraminx (like pyraminx without the corners)

If by instructions u mean a method of solving it, u better just 
search using a search engine. Just search rubiks 4x4x4 solution or 
rubiks revenge solution. U should find plenty :-)

A few starters though:

- www.bigcubes.com
- www.speedcubing.com/chris/4-solution.html

Hope this helps !

Yes I know all these EP-algorithms, but for some EP-cases I listed two
(or more) algs, then I (usually) only know one of this. For the
cubeshapes algs: sometimes I just learn the beginposition and then
perform the alg I learned, othertimes I do it more on intuition.
(Probably I will forget some algs (again), because I don&#x27;t have the
intention to play with my square-1 in the coming weeks :p)

          <div class="email-content">I suppose it depends on where you are in the US. It took around 4 days I think (California --> Ohio) from the day he told me he sent it.
   
  However there was a freak incident once where it took over 2 weeks to ship.. we thought it had gotten lost. I have ordered from him several times though, and usually it&#x27;s pretty fast.

  Hello,

I was wondering, for those people who use cubesmith stickers, how 
quickly does it ship within the US? I plan on getting some for all my 
puzzles this summer.

          <div class="email-content">Hmm so nobody has any ideas on how to fix my crappy cube? I put a lot of lube in it when I first got it..  I was thinking maybe lube soaked into the screws and the area around the screws, causing them to unscrew with use. You guys think I should take it apart and clean out those areas?

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

 

A brand new FMC, #106, will open at midnight tonight.

 

I am currently working on redesigning my web pages, so currently the FMC
page is just the bare bones, there is a challenge, and a link to a
submission form which works correctly, when all the data is added into it :)

 

You can access the new competition by clicking on the Fewest Moves Challenge
link at www.cubestation.co.uk &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/> , or by
accessing it directly via
http://www.cubestation.co.uk/cs2/index.php?page=fmc/fmc 

 

Good Luck everybody! Deadline is 12pm next Sunday :)

 

Keep on cubing, hope that you enjoy the challenge

 

DanH :)

          <div class="email-content">Here is the workaround for IE. Click the applet once, or twice, make 
sure it has focus. After that all works as it should. The solution 
to this is a little javascript. Give the applet an id like 
id=&quot;cubeapplet&quot; and add

    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>
      window.onload=function(){document.getElementById
(&#x27;cubeapplet&#x27;).focus();};
    &lt;/script>

Something like that should do it.

          <div class="email-content">Excellent!  After 10 minutes of practice, it seems very intuitive.

My only suggestion would be adding B and B&#x27;... perhaps above D and D&#x27;.
 I use the back face quite a bit... especially since I can the back
face through your applet.

Just got a 1:14.33 with my tenth attempt, slowly but surely getting 
better. Could you add a records list?

The key has a mistake though.  Both &quot;E&quot; and &quot;D&quot; do the move &quot;L&#x27;&quot;

For the past 18 months or so I&#x27;ve been cubing for about 5-7 hours per 
week, so I&#x27;m just treating it as a bit of fun.  Initial progress was 
rapid (starting at around 70-75s), but progress has been poor over 
the past year.  On good days I&#x27;ve averaged around 40s, but 43s is 
typical.

In my own case the main problems are &quot;old age&quot; and lack of talent, 
but also I haven&#x27;t spent enough time identifying (and working out 
strategies for) the situations that most often cause trouble.  The 
early progress was due to working quite a lot on those.  The more 
recent, and smaller, progress is due mainly to improved look-ahead 
during F2L.

OK, I should never use old age as an excuse around here. :D
Middle age, maybe.

The standard notation has r representing the r slice only.  However, 
for competition purposes the WCA has changed the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 
scrambles to only use double-face turns (no slices).  This makes it 
easier to train people as scramblers and is faster, too.  So in that 
case r represents (Rr) in standard notation.

I&#x27;ve written a scrambler for the 4x4x4 and the 5x5x5, and I can tell
you that it makes a difference what &quot;r&quot; means when you are scrambling.
 If you want to be fair, you need to use the same system when
scrambling as was used when the scrambling program was designed.  If
&quot;r&quot; means two slices to WCA scramblers, we need to make sure that the
scrambling program they use is updated to match this notation.

Scrambling programs take steps to insure that consecutive turns of
parallel slices in the scrambling algorithm do not cancel each other
out.  As a simple example, lets say that the WCA scrambling program
included &quot;R&#x27;r&quot; in its output.  If the WCA official only made a single
slice turn based on this notation, he has effectively decreased the
length of the scramble by one turn.  Another example (for a 4x4x4)
would be &quot;r&#x27;l&quot;.  The WCA scrambling program could generate this
sequence because it means to make two slice turns by its notation.
For the WCA official, these turns would cancel each other out.

I took another look at the WCA scrambling program.  It has a checkbox
called &quot;multi&quot;.  This controls what the notation means when the
scrambles are generated.  If you are running a tournament, and you are
telling your scrambling officials that &quot;r&quot; means multiple slices, make
sure that this box is checked when you print out your scrambles for
the tournament, otherwise you will run into the problems that I
described in my previous post.

          <div class="email-content">I guess some are a lot more talented than others, it took me 8 months

I just noticed that during my one week holidays (I practiced 2-3

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys, I recently ran out of cube lube, so I picked up my usual at<br>
the hardware store: CRC Heavy Duty Silicone Multi-Use Lubricant.  It<br>
comes in a red bottle with a black cap.  I&#x27;ve used it for 4-5 years<br>
now and it&#x27;s always worked great.<br>
  However, when I lubed up a cube with it this time it became much<br>
much worse than it was before.  I checked to make sure I had the right<br>
stuff and noticed that label was slightly different.  I checked the<br>
warnings and sure enough, the NEW CRC multi use lubricant has ACETONE<br>
in it!  I checked this against my other (older, empty) bottle and it<br>
makes no mention of acetone.<br>
  So not only am I looking for a new spray (reccomendations welcome),<br>
but I may be out one decent speed-cube.  Just a heads up to you guys<br>
on this one! Always check your bottle even if you&#x27;ve used the product<br>
before!<br>

100% pure silicone oil

As for your cube, if you clean thoroughly, it should be okay.

way is to be able to perform alg&#x27;s very fluent and a bit quick. Find
alg&#x27;s that are good for yourself was very important to me. F2L is
indeed the part which is most important, the biggest lesson I ever got
for solving F2L was from Ron, he said that I had to try to solve more
fluently and only finish a corner-edge pair if you have seen the next.
By the way: my training time is 2 hours a day, sometimes more
sometimes less.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I was just browsing the official world records list and thought these<br>
two were really cool.<br>
<br>
The oldest world record now is Kenneth Brandon on the Siamese cube at<br>
70.96 seconds from the 2003 World Championships 2003.  The next oldest<br>
record is Lars Vandenbergh&#x27;s Square-1 mean of 3 of 33.21 from the 2004<br>
Dutch Open.<br>
<br>
I just thought it was cool to see how those two records had endured<br>
for so long, seeing as how all the other ones are much more recent.<br>
<br>
I know people are still very active in the Square-1 but does anyone<br>
practice the Siamese cube still?  Have many people since the 2003<br>
World Competition even attempted the Siamese cube in competition?<br>
<br>
Just wanted to make the observation.<br>

As for the siamese cube, I don&#x27;t think there was another competition with

Nah, next oldest is Dror&#x27;s 4x4 BLD from Euro2004, isn&#x27;t it?

couldn&#x27;t find it. I thought to myself that there are only four places
it could be. It could have fallen out of my backpack at work or maybe
at starbucks while I was waiting for the bus. The last two places it
could have been were on the first or second bus I rode home in which
case I would need to buy a new cube. Early the next morning I arived
at work and looked around the lunch room and failled to see my cube
anywhere. Four hours later its coffee time and I ask the guy who gave
me a lift to starbucks if my cube fell onto the floor of his car. No
luck there either. So I go upstairs to the lunch room and this is what
I find:

Everone laughed at that one and it isnt much worse for wear (maybe a
tad looser). And trust me, thats alot better then their other idea....
running it over with a forklift.... >.&lt;
Moral of the story, Always know where your cubes are!

PS: Yes, i know, pairity error, thats the last alg i need to memorise.

2x2: &quot;Junior cube&quot; at mefferts.com.  They&#x27;re the eastsheen brand and 
are quite good.  Problem is, to lubricate them is quite hard since 
you gotta disassemble it, and that&#x27;s kinda hard.

3x3: Rubiks.com DIY kit.  It&#x27;s like $10 or something.  Quite good as 
well.  Cubesmith stickers are good, but I prefer Cubesmith tiles :)

4x4: Go with Rubiks.com if you want a new one.

5x5: I really can&#x27;t comment.  I have right now an eastsheen and a 
rubiks.com one.  Eastsheen&#x27;s decent, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan.  A bit 
too loose/fragile at times.  My rubiks.com one is the completely 
opposite end of the spectrum, as in I think I&#x27;m going to break my 
hand if I ever attempt another solve on it.

Hope this helps!

\<br>
It took me 3 solid months...I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the secret to it, I guess <br>
it&#x27;s because I talked to those cubers on the chatroom? And they helped <br>
me along. And browsing around for a good websites with nice algos and <br>
explaination/tips. It&#x27;s all about the mind, whether you can recongnize <br>
what you&#x27;re doing &quot;wrong&quot; or just basically what you need to improve <br>
on--then improve it! <br>
<br>
Also, sub 20 doesn&#x27;t require full Fridrich, or other advance system. <br>
When  I sub 20, I was using 3 look LL, although I know some other OLL <br>
cases, but not many. I actually went through the OLL cases and in a way <br>
memorize what corner OLL I&#x27;m going to get after the EOLL (and I tried <br>
to experiment with different angles and edge orientation algos, so that <br>
the cases I usually get is Sune or anti Sune etc.), therefore there was <br>
not much delays between the 2 oll algos. All this isn&#x27;t suppose to be <br>
directly done, but it&#x27;s sort of like subconsciously aware of.<br>
<br>
Right....I hope it make sense because right now I&#x27;m tired and suppose <br>
to be at bed LOL<br>

  If you use partial edge control (making sure you never end up with all <br>
  edges incorrectly flipped in the LL after F2L) then your odds are:<br>
<br>
  OLL skip - 1/189<br>
  PLL skip - 1/72<br>
  LL skip - 1/(189*72) = 1/13608<br>

Potentionally, But a problem lies with the corners at the end. Since
their permutation is already correct, you only have to orientate them.
This gives quicker analysis of them, but the algs for just orientation
I use are slower than a lot of the other ones.

30 seconds would be a good target, I&#x27;ll have to get myself a siamese
cube :)

As with B and B&#x27;, I have thought long and hard about this also.<br>
<br>
The simulator is based on a finger model that attempts to emulate how<br>
fingers interact with a real cube. Every finger press on the keyboard<br>
corresponds to what can be achieved by a single finger press on a<br>
physical cube, where the other hand may or may not be holding one part<br>
of the cube fixed in space.<br>
<br>
On a real cube, a move such as U involves -- while holding the bottom<br>
two layers steady with the left hand -- pressing one finger on the top<br>
layer with the right hand. It is performed &quot;J&quot; on my simulator.<br>
<br>
On a real cube, a move such as M involves -- while holding the left<br>
layer fixed with the left hand -- pushing down with one finger on the<br>
middle layer, while simultaneously pushing up with one finger (or thumb)<br>
on the right layer. It is performed &quot;M + I&quot; (pressing both keys<br>
simultaneously) on my simulator.<br>
<br>
If, on a real cube, you only push down with one finger on the middle<br>
layer, while holding the left layer fixed with the left hand, then the<br>
result is that both of the right two layers will move. In my simulator,<br>
this also happens and is performed &quot;M&quot;.<br>
<br>
The physics model of my simulator also allows any arbitrary rotations to<br>
happen simultaneously, provided that they happen around the same axis.<br>
When two rotations happen simultaneously, they take the same time as a<br>
single primitive move.<br>

Not many people actually posted in it and posting a thread generates

<br>
Hey Rune,<br>
<br>
I think the average number of moves using partial edge control would <br>
have to be more than without at least for F2L.<br>
<br>
As for the OLL cases, it seems the all edges flipped cases are some <br>
of the longest ones in terms of number of moves.  Also they tend to <br>
be the slowest.<br>
<br>
I would argue that doing a time analysis might be a little bit <br>
better.  The extra time spent actually making sure you have partial <br>
edge control during F2L would be outweighed I think by avoiding the <br>
longer time it takes to execute the, usually, more awkward OLL cases <br>
with all edges flipped.<br>
<br>
As far as I know though, no one has actually done the analysis with <br>
the time or the number of moves.  I think people just assume the <br>
result would be better, either intuitively or maybe from experience.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s just my guess though, maybe someone already has looked into <br>
this.<br>
<br>
I like it for the sole reason that your odds to skip OLL with <br>
partial edge control are 1/189 instead of 1/216.  I mean that&#x27;s a <br>
small change, but every bit counts.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris, Rune,

Although I do F2L with a different method from most I do use partial
edge control in placing the last edge(s) of the FL. (Lower case letter
means slice alone.)

For example, if the last edge on the First Level in in place but
flipped over and there are 3 edges flipped over on the LL. 
a. If they face me r U r&#x27; U&#x27; r U2 r ends with all 4 LL edges upright.
b. If they face away r U r&#x27; U&#x27; r U2 r ends with 2 adjacent edges flipped. 
c. If they face right r U r&#x27; U&#x27; r U2 r ends with two non-adjacent
edges flipped.
Thus the same algorithm has three different results.

In this case and many others PEC doesn&#x27;t have to cost any moves other
than an alignment of the LL.

In my method there&#x27;s no reason to get to the LL with all four edges
flipped.

Cheers,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hej Chris,<br>
I am asking, since long, long ago I had a similar idea. (I play FL+CLL+the rest). I thougt I had found something - if not fantastic - so very good. I found that I, putting in the last corner in FL in a certain way, could correctly orient one corner in LL. Fantastic!  Instead of 1/162 I get the CLL skip 1/54. But... there are five other cases, where the corners are all correctly orientated, which also became three times more frequent and which cases I definitely didn´t like. I don´t remember (it was in the mid 80ies) but the number of algs ought to have been reduced to one third. But I do remember that I had the impression that the worst algs were left. In short, I had the impression that the average number of moves for CLL had increased. But that´s not all!  A skip always (at least for me) leads to some confusion and the gain is less that it should be theoretically. (Somebody wrote that a skip can even have an absolutely negative effect). To that came that I often lost one move (two times of three?) in FL to fix that corner in LL. And sometimes I missed a &quot;combination&quot; for the two last corners in FL.<br>
In all, I was mistaken and I hope, Chris, that you are not mistaken in the same way.<br>

  Hey Rune,<br>
<br>
  I think the average number of moves using partial edge control would <br>
  have to be more than without at least for F2L.<br>
<br>
  As for the OLL cases, it seems the all edges flipped cases are some <br>
  of the longest ones in terms of number of moves.  Also they tend to <br>
  be the slowest.<br>
<br>
  I would argue that doing a time analysis might be a little bit <br>
  better.  The extra time spent actually making sure you have partial <br>
  edge control during F2L would be outweighed I think by avoiding the <br>
  longer time it takes to execute the, usually, more awkward OLL cases <br>
  with all edges flipped.<br>
<br>
  As far as I know though, no one has actually done the analysis with <br>
  the time or the number of moves.  I think people just assume the <br>
  result would be better, either intuitively or maybe from experience.<br>
<br>
  That&#x27;s just my guess though, maybe someone already has looked into <br>
  this.<br>
<br>
  I like it for the sole reason that your odds to skip OLL with <br>
  partial edge control are 1/189 instead of 1/216.  I mean that&#x27;s a <br>
  small change, but every bit counts.<br>

Hi Rune,

Where do you get those odds? There are only 45 CLL positions, and one
of them is solved.

I found this on rubiks.com quite a while ago...

Don&#x27;t think it is still on their site so I uploaded it to the files 
section of the group.  Hope it helps.

Thanks, Rune I get the general idea.

Corners Oriented: number of occurrances
All up: 1
3 down (clockwise): 4
3 down (counter clockwise): 4
Headlights: 4
Sidelights: 4
Oddlights: 4
Wheels: 4
Barrow: 4

That looks like 29 to me, not 27. 

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Your method of approach is very different.  First of all, it&#x27;s hard to 
comment because I don&#x27;t know the positions to which these names are 
associated with.

In any case, what&#x27;s likely wrong is that not all of these occur with 
the same probability, so you can&#x27;t just say the probability is 1 over 
the number of cases.

A similar example would be what is the probability of getting two heads.

You can&#x27;t say, well, you can get two heads, you can get two tails, or 
you can get one head and one tail, so the probability is 1/3.

  Hi Rune,<br>
<br>
  Where do you get those odds? There are only 45 CLL positions, and one<br>
  of them is solved. <br>
<br>
  David J<br>
<br>
  From where that number 45? I count and count but find only 43 distinct CLL positions (of which one is solved).<br>
  39 of them are found in 4 different shapes (4 colours), 2 of them in 2 different shapes (2 complement colours) and 2 unique cases (the solved case and the &quot;diagonal&quot; case).<br>
  Hence: 39x4+2x2+2x1=162<br>
  Is something wrong?<br>

Nothing.
- A2=A3=A4=A5
- H2=H4
- H3=H5
6x8 - 5 clones = 43

The cases have been available on many sites for many years
(speedcubing.com for example), why are we still counting them? :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Tyson,

The nicknames and their meanings:
All up: the color of the Up side of all the corners is the same as the
center of the Up side.

3 down (clockwise): One corner is upright and the other three corners
are rotated clockwise from upright.

3 down (counterclockwise): One corner is up and the other three
corners are rotated counterclockwise from upright.

Headlights: two adjacent corners are upright and the other two are
rotated to face the same way, like headlights on a car.

Sidelights: two adjacent corners are upright and the other two are
rotated to face the opposite way, like sidelights on some cars.

Oddlights: two non-adjacent corners are upright and the other two are
rotated to face one direction, kind of like a fish, but named to keep
with the &quot;lights&quot; theme. 

Wheels: Four corners are rotated so that the two pair of asjacent
corners face away from each other like the wheels on a car.

Barrow: Four corners are rotated and it reminds me of a wheel barrow
the two corners facing away from each other are the wheels and the two
facing the same direction are the handles.

***

By counting as I did I&#x27;m raising a question.

I had questions about how to count the symetrical case, wheels, (and
others) but I thought that its occurrance might be at the same
frequency, that is, the way the other occurrances of rotated corners
are counted. What I mean to say is that it makes sense to treat all of
those occurance equally.

In &quot;3 down&quot; you turn three corners clockwise and you count the
position, you turn them again you count the position. 

In &quot;headlights&quot; you turn two corners in opposite directions and you
count it as a position, you turn them again they become &quot;sidelights&quot;
and you count them again.

In &quot;oddlights&quot; you rotate two corners and count it, rotate them again
and don&#x27;t count it.

In wheels you rotate four corners, you count the position (and cut in
in half) rotate the corners again and don&#x27;t count the position.

So it seems to me that though symetries exist such that even though a
position is repeated, that repetition occurs mathematically. It&#x27;s as
though a census taker counted twins as one person.

Regards,

David J

as you can see its the single parity + the r2 on the 4th move<br>

Apparently I run the risk of miscounting no matter how I do it! :p

I never thought of simply combing them like that. Then again, i 
never use them anyway cause i use a different method. Only have a 
single parity w my method on 4x4x4. U should look into combining 
permutation parity fix with Fredericks orientation parity fix 
because it avoids using B-moves, which i think is good for 
speeding :-)

Have fun!

U joker! U know the answer to this ;-) The 2 puzzles don&#x27;t &quot;connect

I&#x27;d like to keep the number of keys at the bare minimum, and you can
already do this with: Dc&#x27; &quot;F+;&quot; and Dc is &quot;J+A&quot;. (Hit the keys
simultaneously, and they&#x27;ll be performed at the same time).

Have fun :-)

Yeah doing &quot;F+;&quot; and &quot;J+A&quot; works perfectly well for double layer d<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Yeah doing &quot;F+;&quot; and &quot;J+A&quot; works perfectly well for double layer d<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Also how do you guys get so fast?  I must have done 20-25 solves so<br>
&gt; far and my best is 1:14.xx.  How the heck do you do this applet in<br>
&gt; under 20 seconds?  That&#x27;s just incredible.  Did you guys just do 100<br>

But this find its explanation in the fact that the megaminx last layer 
has 5 sides whereas the cube has only 4.

Everything changes in the U2 move (I do not advise you to do U&#x27; U&#x27;, but 
do U U :D).
That&#x27;s all I can think of for the reason at this point.

I will keep this algorithm in mind, it might help some day :D

Not at all. If you mistake it for U2&#x27; or U3, that&#x27;s clearly *your*

Ok, since not everybody has a megaminx, I&#x27;ll just say it. Both puzzles 
are very similar, in terms of mechanism as well as how to solve it. 
Many useful algorithms work on both puzzles and have the same effect.

This algorithm, however, is special. On both puzzles, it&#x27;s a pure 
3-cycle of pieces. But while it cycles three *edges* for the 3x3, it 
cycles three *corners* for the megaminx. I had never seen something 
like this and I&#x27;m quite surprised.

Btw it&#x27;s easy to remember written as four standard fingertricks:
(R U R&#x27; U&#x27;) (L&#x27; U&#x27; L U) (U R U&#x27; R&#x27;) (U&#x27; L&#x27; U L)

Still doesn&#x27;t explain it to me, though. I&#x27;d like to understand how it 
works and explain why it cycles edges on one puzzle and corners on the 
other.

Cheers!
Stefan

Ok, for Megaminx it&#x27;s not so hard to see now. It&#x27;s an unusual 
commutator PQP&#x27;Q&#x27; with P=RUR&#x27;U&#x27; and Q=L&#x27;U&#x27;LU. Their effects only 
overlap at a single corner at the back of the U layer, which you can 
see if you only do P. This corner has the &quot;correct orientation&quot; after 
P, i.e. U sticker on U face, which is important because otherwise the 
corners would end up disoriented.

On the 3x3 it&#x27;s harder, the overlap is larger. Well, the corner that P 
brings to the back of U is actually a corner/edge *pair*. The edge of 
the pair isn&#x27;t reached by Q on the Megaminx, but it is on the 3x3. And 
this creates the edge 3-cycle on the 3x3 for the same explanation the 
corner 3-cycle was created on the Megaminx. However, the effects 
overlap for 3x3 is more than just that edge. Two corners are involved, 
too, UBL and UBR are swapped and disoriented. Clearly after four swaps 
they&#x27;re at the correct position again, actually already after two of 
course. They&#x27;re also oriented correctly after PQ, because P preserves 
the orientation of UBR while it moves to UBL, and UBL is oriented 
counterclockwise. Mirrorly Q preserves orientation of UBL while it 
moves back to UBR and orients UBR on its way back to UBL. So one 
corner has its orientation preserved both ways and the other gets 
oriented and back.

The key observation and thus explanation for me now is that two CEC 
triples overlap and on the megaminx they&#x27;re adjacent ones (which 
overlap at one corner) and on the 3x3 they&#x27;re the same (overlap at one 
edge, with side effect overlap of two corners) because of the one 
fewer side around U.

Cheers!
Stefan

Hey Joël,
I have hesitated very long before deciding to comment on this post.
Firstly, me giving advice to a sub15ie can easily be understood as 
some form of hypocrisy. Secondly, I play in princip CLL+ELL. I 
say &quot;in princip&quot;, for after CLL I do not do ELL, but the analyze of 
the U layer must be about the same.
But as I understand, the very idea in my case must - at least 
theoretically - be applicable in your case.
Before executing the appropriate Cll alg (I have only a dozen), I 
observe, which edge will go to UR and with which orientation. I also 
observe the coming colour of URF and URB though not so important. 
(Once you have learnt which edge goes to UR, the recognition will 
soon be unconscious and take no time).
Now, I have arranged all my Cll algs so, that the last move of the 
alg is always some R move. It means that under executing this last 
move, I can &quot;quietly&quot; read the picture(UF,UL,UB) and when the R move 
is done, I should be ready to execute the appropriate ELL.
That´s all.
Rune

  Apparently Lars V. is a badass at solving it, so naturally I went to his site and found his proposed solution. However, I have no concept of the different &quot;levels&quot; of methods for solving square one, and his site seemed to recommend memorizing a lot of algorithms. Obviously there are different &quot;tiers&quot; of systems for all puzzles, such as a beginner method vs. a 4LLL vs a 2LLL, etc.<br>
   <br>
  I know I saw a square-one solution somewhere which said it required only 3 algorithms. I forget where it was, but I think I want to learn more a slightly better system than this, because I would be willing to put some time into memorization and practice.<br>
   <br>
  What system do you guys recommend in terms of a basic but GOOD way to solve the square-one? please provide links.<br>
   <br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, <br>
Start not to look at the pieces you are solving, i.e. target the next<br>
corner/edge pieces to solve WHILE your hands are solving the current<br>
corner/edge pieces. Since you know all the standard algorithms and some<br>
shortcuts you will be able to do this. I start looking at the next pair as<br>
soon as I see the pair I&#x27;m currently is solving since my finger already know<br>
what to do. <br>
<br>
Next step may be to know how your F2L algs affect certain corners and edges<br>
or learn to look on only one (or two) colors on a cubie to determine which<br>
on it is.<br>
<br>
But I&#x27;m no expert, me as well need some more hints and tricks!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Ok...  I&#x27;m starting to get frustrated.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m on an adventure hunt to find some silicone spray, since I lost <br>
my last can somewhere and now don&#x27;t have any.<br>
<br>
I also can&#x27;t find Prestone brand silicone anymore.  I called up the <br>
Prestone company&#x27;s customer service line but it was after hours.  <br>
I&#x27;ll call back again when they are working and ask if it can be <br>
ordered over the phone.<br>
<br>
I went to two different Walmart stores, a Target, Lowes Home <br>
Improvement, Advance auto parts, and Pep Boys Auto and was not able <br>
to find a silicone spray that did not contain either Acetone or <br>
Petroleum Distillates.  I was also able to find a silcone goop used <br>
for plumbing, but I would much rather have an aerosol spray than a <br>
gel.<br>
<br>
Some of the brands I saw listed the specific petroleum distillate in <br>
the mix, and I was wondering if all petroleum distillates have a <br>
tendency to eat the plastic of the cube, or only some?  If only <br>
some, which ones specifically?<br>
<br>
Also, is the teflon/silicone spray ok to use on a cube, or does it <br>
also eat the plastic?<br>
<br>
My only option if petroleum distillates are not ok for using on the <br>
cube is to either order 12 cans of Snap spray online, but it appears <br>
that I have to order in bulk (12 cans), or to ask if anyone on this <br>
group has some silicone I can buy.  And I really am serious about <br>
that, my area appears to not have snap or prestone silicone <br>
anywhere, and I don&#x27;t want to use anything that could damage my <br>
cubes (petroleum distillates and/or acetone).<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help,<br>

That is so weird to see someone else write this, I&#x27;ve gotten this a
couple of times too.  I get it whenever I get &quot;cube high&quot;.  I wrote
about it on my site a long time ago.

Sometimes when I am especially in the zone, and am getting really good
times (for me), I will see the cube slanted also.

The cube slants vertically for me, so it appears to be wider left to
right and shorter back to front.

How does it slant for you?

Chris

P.S.  No you&#x27;re not weird in my opinion, I&#x27;ve had that too.  But maybe
you and I are weird in others&#x27; opinions ;-)

          <div class="email-content">oh, phew.
okay well when it first slanted it, the top and front face kind of
tilted to the left. so kinda like
____
\   \
 \___\ except not as badly

but not i&#x27;m starting to get this thing where the edges kind of curl
out. like, it&#x27;s like a square with circular curves on all the sides,
so the corners of each face look more pointed than normal. less than
90 degree angles. it&#x27;s so weird...

i&#x27;m glad i&#x27;m not alone heh...

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tony,

wow this is really cool.  For me it was like I had done a quarter turn
of the cube counterclockwise (so that the cube is sort of diagonal
with the front face on the right and the left face on the left side of
the dividing line facing me (the FL edge line of the cube).  From this
point it was like I had taken the BR edge of the cube and squished it
towards the FL edge, so that the cube ended up diamond shaped.  That
was the part that weirded me out when you wrote your message, because
I also thought of the cube as being suddenly &quot;diamond shaped&quot; also. 
For me the feeling that the cube was somehow rotated counterclockwise
just the tiniest bit was also very strong too, like I was holding the
cube on a weird tilt, in addition to it appearing diamond shaped. 
Even though in reality I was holding the cube perfectly normal. 

I have never had the thing where the corners looked overly pointed,
but that sounds cool too.  Yeah the diamond thing for me is actually a
good sign, it so far has only come when I was in a weirdly heightened
state of concentration (much more than my normal).

Now that this has been brought up I wonder if others have felt/had this?

the cube just warped in shape for a few minutes instead

Hey Rune,<br>
<br>
No I asked Ron to remove all of my records related to official<br>
categories - Richard Patterson also did the same.<br>
<br>
I did this for a number of reasons, but mainly I wanted to try to help<br>
take the focus off the unofficial records and put it more on the<br>
official records.<br>
<br>
Also I found that in training for the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 unofficial<br>
blindfolded records I was severely handicapping myself for solving<br>
those cubes blindfolded in competition.  I felt that maybe training<br>
speedsolving averages of 10 for all cube sizes was doing the same for<br>
speedsolving to some extent as well.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t expect everyone to agree with my reasons, but it is something<br>
I wanted to do.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I am back to cubing almost after a month. I really enjoyed my vacation.
  Even I felt like chris hardwick sometime. But, I was not disturbed by any sound like you mentioned. Instead, Whenever I realise I am slower than my normal speed during any stage of solve, I am Shocked. Then suddenly, I am able to focus very well and get very good timings.

  Hey everyone I had something kinda interesting happen while I was
practicing tonight.  I was doing the 4x4x4 and unknowingly had my
sound on my computer speakers turned up pretty loud.  Then one of the
programs on my computer, during a solve, made a loud sound and it
really freaked me out for a second.  I was in the middle of the solve
and literally jumped in my chair.  Then when I realized that it was
just the computer, I had the sort of rush of adrenaleine, rapid heart
beat, etc.  I noticed that right at that point all of a sudden I sort
of went into a heightened focus on my solve.  I was about half way
through the solve and noticed that I sped up a really good bit from
the speed I was going and finished strong with a really fast time.

Anyway it was just cool how being really startled enough that I jumped
made me really focus on that cube and actually speed up a lot and
finish really strong.

I had never had anything like that happen to me during a solve, it was
really kinda cool!

  Hey Rune,<br>

  No I asked Ron to remove all of my records related to official<br>

  I did this for a number of reasons, but mainly I wanted to try to help<br>
  take the focus off the unofficial records and put it more on the<br>

  I see your point. Maybe your &quot;hidden&quot; gesture didn´t get the attention it deserved.<br>

          <div class="email-content">If you see petroleum distillates (specifically hexanes and heptanes)
or acetone in the ingredient list of silicon spray, they&#x27;re just used
as the solvent so that the silicon can be applied in aerosol form. If
you check the ingredients of SNAP silicon spray you&#x27;ll see it contains
petroleum distillates too. After you spray it on your cube, they
evaporate, leaving the silicon lubricant behind.

When you&#x27;re advised not to use petroleum based stuff on your cube,
that just refers to petroleum based lubricants like WD-40. In this
case the lubricant itself is silicon, so you should be ok.

I ordered 3M spray from Parts Express before:

http://tinyurl.com/eu95c

Kinda pricey but it&#x27;s 100% pure silicone.  As you know I switched to 
oil after discovering Shock Oil (much cheaper and works better I 
think).  I have a spare can of the 3M if you don&#x27;t find anything.

Hey Andy,

i also thought of a fund raising event by doing rubik&#x27;s cube in 
Singapore. ( i have been cubing like less than 2 months getting 
times like 1:16 - 1:30) but the idea of the event is to let the 
general public bring their cubes to us and we solve it for them and 
they can make a donation kinda thing. haha.,. wat do u think?

Jeremy

<br>
Does anybody know if the standard 3x3x3 cubes from rubiks.com have<br>
flat centers or arched centers?  I really prefer flat centers but<br>
they&#x27;re so hard to find anymore.<br>
<br>
By the way, I haven&#x27;t posted here in a while, hopefully some of you<br>
remember me.  I&#x27;ve been pretty inactive in terms of my cubing for a<br>
few months, but seeing some of the great times being posted has<br>
motivated me to drop my average to sub 15.  Hopefully I can achieve<br>
this before US Nationals!<br>

Great idea! I&#x27;m from Sweden, but I&#x27;m going to Singapore sometime
between July 20 and Aug 3 this summer, to visit a friend of mine. Any
chance the event could be held sometime during this period? I&#x27;m a
pretty new cuber too, with averages in the 40s and a PB (from
yesterday!) of 35.86, but I should be able to get some cubes &quot;sold&quot; ;)

Best regards,
Aron Stansvik

If you get very stuck, try Jaap&#x27;s page for a variety of approaches:

http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/square1.htm

There are a couple that should be suitable for speed solving.  But 
you don&#x27;t need to learn many sequences to average below 1min; just 
build up complex cases from the few that you&#x27;ve learnt sequences 
for.

It will help the charity and also will help increase the awareness about cubing.

To my knowledge, the cubes on sale at Rubiksdotcom are all arched. The
only official Rubik&#x27;s brand cubes made today without arches are the
Rubik&#x27;s Studio cubes. You need to work on them a little so that the
caps don&#x27;t fall off and the screws don&#x27;t unscrew while you&#x27;re solving.
The plastic is excellent.

Older cubes from Ideal are mostly flat under the centers. Some of the
ones with the square white logo sticker on top of the center white
sticker are arched.

Maybe you simply never had a good arched cube. 

Cheers,

David J

The first time I looked online for how many cases there were the page
said 25; that was a few years ago. The second page said 25 the third
had 30-some the fourth had more. More recently I ran across page
reading 43 cases. Who to trust? I asked a few times and was either
ignored shown the 25 cases page. 
All that I do on the cube I work out myself. This means I wan&#x27;t
checking other people&#x27;s algorithms until I had a full set.

When I wrote mine down I made sure that I had all the cases, I wasn&#x27;t
looking for accidental duplication. I showed the page to several
people before making it public and they didn&#x27;t catch it either. Oh,
well...

Anyway, that&#x27;s why I was still counting them.

Cheers,

David J

- An exhaustive list obviously contains 4!.3^3 cases.
- If adjustments of U (before and after the sequence) are free, the
list is much shorter (43).
- If you forget about symmetrical cases, it&#x27;s even less.
- And the shortest list of cases that includes only perfectly unique
unsolved cases (removing cases identical through U adjustments,
symmetries, and reversed sequences) has only 24 cases (see
Helmstetter&#x27;s for example).

--> I know some sites have mistakes, but it depends on what you&#x27;re
looking for too.

          <div class="email-content">Hello 4x and 5x solvers --<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m working on where to concentrate to improve my 4x and 5x times, <br>
and wondering how others who use the same approach end up in terms <br>
of time for various steps.<br>
<br>
I do both as: group centers, match edges, solve like a 3x, fix any <br>
parity.<br>
<br>
For 4x, I&#x27;m at:<br>
<br>
Group Centers: 30 seconds<br>
Match Edges: 1 minute 15 seconds<br>
Solve like 3x: 1 minute<br>
Fix Parity: 10-15 seconds<br>
<br>
This leaves me right around 3 minute range, depending on brain <br>
awareness and if any step goes faster. It feels like the slow step <br>
is edge matching - I used to do one edge pair at a time (averaging <br>
about 2:45 for overall solve) and am now working on doing 2 edge <br>
pairs at a time (so overall time hasn&#x27;t changed much).<br>
<br>
For 5x, I&#x27;m at:<br>
<br>
Group Centers: 3 minutes<br>
Match Edges: 3 minutes<br>
Solve like 3x: 90 seconds<br>
Fix any Parity: 15 seconds<br>
<br>
Total time just about 8 minutes. Center matching feels like the slow <br>
step here.<br>
<br>
So, how does your 4x and 5x time break down? I&#x27;m especially <br>
interested in hearing from top solvers (like 4x in 1:15 or less and <br>
5x in 4 minutes or less).<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

4x4:

Centers: 25-30
Edges: 30-40?
3x3: 30-40
Parities: 10ish
My times range from 1:30 to 2:00

5x5:
Centers: 55-60
Edges: 1:30 - 1:50 (this includes paritites and solving all edges)
3x3: 40-55
My PB is 2:50, so that would be like 50 centers, 1:30 edges, 40 3x3? ish

But yah, thats just me, my 4x4 centers need to be better...

Also, the schedule has been updated. <br>

The biggest update is the break for lunch. You have an hour for lunch,<br>

the schedule a bit. If you have any questions or comments email me<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes I agree. I made up my own method for solving 5x5 centers. It&#x27;s 
really slow, yet I&#x27;m sub 2:30 at it. http://www.bigcubes.com has a 
good centers tut, but I&#x27;m not going to use it until I get some lube. :
P Where I die is steps 2 and 3; 7:30 on it put together. (commuters 
and keyhole) And I don&#x27;t own a 4x4 yet.

Everyone knows it&#x27;s a serious offense to be speed-cubing with long 
fingernails. So blame urselves if u hurt urselves or damage ur tiles

          <div class="email-content">I see two points of interest... every face has all 6 colors on it and
no two adjacent cubie faces are the same color.  It is a nice
algorithm for creating a very &quot;scrambled-looking&quot; cube.  I suppose
this could be used for a speedsolving trick to entertain non-cubers,
but ultimately I just like it for aesthetic reasons.

I will only be judging after my solves.  It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m going to 
scramble my own cube and then judge myself. :P

          <div class="email-content">Oh man!  I&#x27;ve been reading about blindfold solving for a few weeks<br>
now, and trying out the moves and methods without actually doing it<br>
fully.  Well, this morning I decided to just go for it and see what<br>
happens.  I was so nervous when I put it down, because I had 2 pairs<br>
of corners, and I had screwed that up the other day when I was trying<br>
things out.  But lo, did my eyes witness a beautiful sight indeed when<br>
I stopped the timer!  Not only that, but my time was 13:17.75, with<br>
about 6:40 or so to memorize and about 6:40 to solve.  I&#x27;m very happy<br>
that not only was it successful, but it was well below my aim of 20<br>
minutes.<br>
<br>
Much thanks to Macky, whose page about blindfold solving was the one I<br>
read the most thoroughly and helped the most.  Also, to anyone who<br>
attempted blindfold solving at the Horace Mann competition last year,<br>
because that was where I first saw blindfolding, and it definitly<br>
inspired me even though it took me a year to get around to trying it.<br>

That&#x27;s odd. After playing with it for a few mins and inserting things
like &lt;noframes> it eventually began to parse the HTML O_o.

Or, use http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?alg=LR2B2F2D&#x27;U&#x27;L&#x27;
which also explains itself.

Agreed, your method is suitable for putting up lightweight images on a
website, but for learning purposes I always enjoy applets.

Oh, and:

          <div class="email-content">There is a very simple rule to actually solve that limit. It&#x27;s called<br>
the &quot;Hospital&#x27;s Rule&quot;<br>
(http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LHospitalsRule.html) and it goes as<br>
follow in our case:<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s put f(t) = sin(pi*t) - sin(pi*x) and g(t) = t-x<br>
Then lim_{t-&gt;x} f(x)/g(x) = lim_{t-&gt;x} f&#x27;(x)/g&#x27;(x) = lim_{t-&gt;x}<br>
pi*cos(pi*t) = pi*cos(pi*x)<br>
<br>
Proving the &quot;Hospital&#x27;s Rule&quot; is also very simple:<br>
<br>
if lim_{x-&gt;c} f(x) = 0 and lim_{x-&gt;c} g(x) = 0, then<br>
<br>
f(x)/g(x) = f(x)-f(c) / g(x)-g(c) = (f(x)-f(c))/(x-c) / (g(x)-g(c))/(x-c)<br>
<br>
Taking the limit:<br>
<br>
lim_{x-&gt;c} f(x)/g(x) = lim_{x-&gt;c} (f(x)-f(c))/(x-c) / (g(x)-g(c))/(x-c)<br>
 = lim_{x-&gt;c} f&#x27;(x)/g&#x27;(x) as lim_{x-&gt;c} (f(x)-f(c))/(x-c) is the<br>
definition of the derivative at c of f(x).<br>

I guess it is pretty much complete...<br>

What do you mean?

F stands for front if I`m not mistaking. At least on the sits that

So, you think you like l&#x27;Hopital&#x27;s rule?  Try using it on this problem:

Evaluate lim(x->0) of f(x)/g(x) where

f(x) = arcsin[arctan(x)] - arctan[arcsin(x)]
g(x) = sin[tan(x)] - tan[sin(x)]

Yes, there is an easier way than using l&#x27;Hopital&#x27;s rule to find the 
limit in this case.  I&#x27;ll leave that as a puzzle. :D

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I would do it the same way as Daniel.
Since you&#x27;ve already proven the derivative with h->0 I would use that:

lim(h->0) [(sin(pi*(x+h))-sin(pi*x)]/(h) = pi*cos(pi*x)


Step 1: Let h =t-x, so
lim{(t-x)->0}[(sin(pi*t)-sin(pi*x)]/(t-x) = pi*cos(pi*x)

Step 2: Show that
lim{ (t-x)->0}[(sin(pi*t)-sin(pi*x)]/(t-x) is the same as
   lim (t->x)    [(sin(pi*t)-sin(pi*x)]/(t-x),

For step 2 I used the definition for a limit of a function:
Let B be the limit of f(x):
B = lim(x-x0) f(x) &lt;=>
{ |x-x0| &lt; Delta  =>  |f(x)-f(x0)| &lt; Epsilon}

See also here for the definition:
http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~kouba/CalcOneDIRECTORY/preciselimdirectory/PreciseL\
imit.html
http://library.thinkquest.org/C006002/Pages/Defining_a_Limit.htm

I hope that makes sense.

Glad you like it, though I can&#x27;t claim originality.  It was reported to 
me verbally that this example was used in a (somewhat polemical) talk 
by V.I. Arnol&#x27;d.  Another gem from him was: &quot;Bourbaki is used as a text 
by those who don&#x27;t understand calculus to teach students who will also 
never understand it&quot; (or similar).

L&#x27;Hopital&#x27;s Rule and Chain Rule was what I was thinking when I read 
it, but since it&#x27;s solved, whatever. (No I&#x27;m not in calculus, but next 
year)

Yes, you /could/ do that, but you need a surprisingly large number of 
iterations to get it out, and the chance of making an error is high (at 
least, it would be for me).

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

Thanks for the help, I think I will go with the variable 
substitution for h=t-x and use the limit as h->0 which I&#x27;ve already 
got a proof for.

Is it possible using lim(t->x) with a trig identity?  Or maybe you 
would need either of lim(t->x) sin(t-x)/(t-x) = 1 or (1-cos(t-x))/(t-
x) = 0?

Chris

P.S.  If you want a fun puzzle try this beast:

Do as an indefinite integral

integral[(x*e^(2*x))/(2x+1)^2]dx

How much do you think they&#x27;ll cost?? I&#x27;m willing to pay quite a lot to
get a 6x6x6, anyway!

  &gt; BTW, lim(x-&gt;0) of f(x)/g(x) &lt;...&gt; is 1, right?<br>
<br>
  Right indeed!<br>
<br>
  I would also have answered &quot;1&quot;.  (Intuitively. Based on the behavour of sin(x) and tg(x) around zero).<br>

I am not real familiar with the larger competition
setups but how does this work.  If there are 100 3x3
people are only 50 going to do the preliminary one day
and the next 50 the second day?  How does this work? 
Or if all 100 people do it the first day what it is
the point of having the second day preliminarys?  Can
someone explain this to me?

          <div class="email-content">Hem there&#x27;s something fishy about this. I checked to see if anyone <br>
flaged you out on this first, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to be the first <br>
to point out that the proof is flawed.<br>
<br>
Accepting L&#x27;Hospital&#x27;s Rule, we still cannot do this:<br>
<br>
&gt; Let&#x27;s put f(t) = sin(pi*t) - sin(pi*x) and g(t) = t-x<br>
&gt; Then lim_{t-&gt;x} f(x)/g(x) = lim_{t-&gt;x} f&#x27;(x)/g&#x27;(x) = lim_{t-&gt;x}<br>
&gt; pi*cos(pi*t) = pi*cos(pi*x)<br>
<br>
because here you used the thing you are trying to show. Thus it is <br>
circular logic.<br>
<br>
Since I&#x27;m at it, the more plausible solution using more traditional <br>
tools would be simply to first prove the chain rule. But just <br>
hacking though it, lets see what can happen:<br>
<br>
<br>
   lim_{t-&gt;x} ((sin(pi*t)-sin(pi*x))/(t-x)<br>
== lim_{t-&gt;x} (2 sin((pi*t-pi*x)/2) cos((pi*t+pi*x)/2))/(t-x)<br>
== lim_{t-&gt;x} (2 sin((pi/2)(t-x)) cos((pi/2)(t+x))/(t-x)<br>
== 2 * [lim_{t-&gt;x} cos((pi/2)(t+x))/(t-x)] * [lim_{t-&gt;x} sin((pi/2)<br>
(t-x))/(t-x)]<br>
== 2 * cos(pi*x) * lim_{t-&gt;x} [sin((pi/2)(t-x))/(t-x)]<br>
== 2 * cos(pi*x) * lim_{a-&gt;0} [sin((pi/2)a)/a]<br>
== 2 * cos(pi*x) * (pi/2)<br>
== pi*cos(pi*x)<br>
<br>
The last limit is a common lemma, though I&#x27;m not sure how to give a <br>
simple proof (I&#x27;d go into epsilons and deltas here, hehe). The key <br>
was to use the &quot;difference of sines&quot; trig identity.<br>
<br>
Hem... I guess to be rigorous one should show that the function is <br>
differentiable in the first place, or give a reason why it would be <br>
before proceeding.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, I was confused at first as well about that schedule.

It says:
&quot;For the main events, you may attend and compete either Friday or 
Saturday. You may not compete on both days in these events, but you 
are welcome and encouraged to participate as a spectator.&quot;

So I&#x27;m guessing we are to compete on which ever day we feel most 
convient and/or most ready to set a good qualifing times.

I believe that the goal of this format is primarily to allow ppl 
that want to do several events, not get overwhelmed, and be able to 
do some of their events one day, and the rest the next day. Then the 
secondary reason is to accomadate such a high turn-out (well we  
anticipate 50 ppl I&#x27;m sure).

I think that it is best to do as much as you can on the first day, 
as to ensure that everybody gets a Round 1 opportunity. That is if 
you arrive on/before Friday. Presumably, there will be those few ppl 
that will unavoidably arrive Saturday.


-Doug

p.s. I think I&#x27;ll arrive Tuesday and leave Tuesday. I so rarely get 
to be free from school and work and be so far away from home. At 
some point we all need to coordinate something. Has anyone picked a 
hotel(s) yet? I guess I really should be reading this forum more 
often :/.

          <div class="email-content">I just watched the three videos very carefully, as well as read over 
Frank&#x27;s thought&#x27;s on the puzzles.

I&#x27;m very excited to try one at some point in the future. Definately 
getting some priority in the list of things I must do in life.

However, I have a few curiosities. Will the puzzles be produced in a 
black plastic? Are there copyrights against doing so? THe white would 
totally throw me off. Would it be illegal to sell them with one/both 
of the standard color scheme(s). Either way I bet Cubesmith will have 
something ready for us in no time, once it is released.

This may have already been asked a few times, but is there an 
estimated release date? And how fast are they planning on punching 
these badboys out? From Frank&#x27;s impressions of it, I trust that they 
will quickly run out of stock. Hem, I should pre-order one if that is 
even possible right now.

I&#x27;d also like to see the insides of those puzzles. At this point it 
seems to be a closely gaurded secret still. Just to see a stand-alone 
corner piece (or edge piece) of the 6x6 would rock!

MAN! I&#x27;m so jealous... :).

My explanation is this:

On any given puzzle like this in which no pieces can turn all by 
themselves, that, according to mathematical logic, must have a total 
of 0mod(number of possibilities). For example, there are always an 
even number of twisted edges: [even number] mod [number of 
possibilities = 2] = 0. Check.

Now, onto the 4x4. Two corners swapped is the same as two edge-pairs 
swapped.

Permutation Parity: The &quot;two-cycle&quot; is actually a double swap. The UFl 
switches with UBr, and UFr with UBl. You can always do two swaps since 
 2 swaps MOD 2C1 = 0. 

Orientation Parity: It&#x27;s not one twisted edge pair, but two twisted 
edges. Same thing again 2 twisted edge MOD 2 possible ways = 0.

Hopefully I made that understandable. :x

First of all, that&#x27;s not really parity because you haven&#x27;t completed 
the edges. Second of all, to solve that particular pair, do F U&#x27; R U z 
y (Dd)&#x27; F U F&#x27; L F&#x27; L&#x27; F (Dd). (Thanks a lot, bigcubes.com) Also, I 
know probably less than you about the 4x4. :)

&gt; P.S.  If you want a fun puzzle try this beast:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Do as an indefinite integral<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; integral[(x*e^(2*x))/(2x+1)^2]dx<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
[(1/4)e^(2x)]/(2x+1)+C<br>
<br>
The answer has to be of the form ye^(2x). Differentiating that gives<br>
the diffy q: y&#x27;+2y=x/(2x+1)^2. From there I could easily guess that<br>
y=c/(2x+1) for some constant c, which turned out to be 1/4.<br>

My explanation is this:

On any given puzzle like this in which no pieces can turn all by 
themselves, that, according to mathematical logic, must have a total 
of 0mod(number of possibilities). For example, there are always an 
even number of twisted edges: [even number] mod [number of 
possibilities = 2] = 0. Check.

Now, onto the 4x4. Two corners swapped is the same as two edge-pairs 
swapped.

Permutation Parity: The &quot;two-cycle&quot; is actually a double swap. The UFl 
switches with UBr, and UFr with UBl. You can always do two swaps since 
2 swaps MOD 2C1 = 0. 

Orientation Parity: It&#x27;s not one twisted edge pair, but two twisted 
edges. Same thing again 2 twisted edge MOD 2 possible ways = 0.

Hopefully I made that understandable. :x

&gt; However, I have a few curiosities. Will the puzzles be produced in a <br>
&gt; black plastic? Are there copyrights against doing so? THe white would <br>
&gt; totally throw me off. Would it be illegal to sell them with one/both <br>
&gt; of the standard color scheme(s). Either way I bet Cubesmith will have <br>
&gt; something ready for us in no time, once it is released.<br>
<br>
Hey Doug,<br>
<br>
As someone who used a white plastic cube for quite a while, I hope I<br>
can calm your fears about the white throwing you off too badly.  It<br>
might be a minor annoyance at first, but you&#x27;ll quickly get used to<br>
it.  I&#x27;m thinking the change from white stickers to black will take<br>
more getting used to, since white is my first side that I solve, but<br>
even that shouldn&#x27;t be too bad to get used to.<br>

There is only one preliminary round, so it doesn&#x27;t matter which day you 
compete.

If you can compete on Friday, it&#x27;s probably best to show up on Friday.  
If we run overtime on Friday or it&#x27;s busy, then you can compete on 
Saturday.

This format is to accommodate an estimated of 120 competitors while 
still allowing everyone to have 5 solves in the first round.

Michael, your r&#x27; U2 r&#x27; U2 B2 r&#x27; B2 l U2 l&#x27; U2 r2 in practice makes it

I take that as evidence that it is not possible to enforce this rule<br>

Oh, I didn&#x27;t need to slow it down. Neither did I need to zoom in or 
sharpen it. And I noticed it the first time I watched it since it was 
rather obvious.

Had I been the judge, standing right next to him, I&#x27;m quite sure I 
would&#x27;ve noticed it. But it&#x27;s not because I have good eyes, but 
because I know the rule.

> I think it&#x27;s a bad rule, and that this video is evidence of that.

Uh... I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s evidence the rule is *unknown*, not that it&#x27;s bad.

I did watch it framewise now in order to get the durations. At the 
stop the far heels of the hands rest on the sensors for about 0.30 
seconds and at start he holds his position for more than two seconds. 
And his judge is sitting right on the side of him. Don&#x27;t tell me she 
couldn&#x27;t see it! She just didn&#x27;t even try to!

Actually I don&#x27;t find it surprising the judges don&#x27;t know the rules. 
After all, many aren&#x27;t even cubers. But what really makes me wonder is 
how even elite cubers don&#x27;t know them (right now Thibaut is 
unofficially the world&#x27;s #2 both for average of 10 and 100).

          <div class="email-content">I agree that the rule is largely unknown, and it is unknown because it
has *never* *been* *enforced*.

Also, please someone explain to me, because it has never been
satisfactorily explained to me, why stopping with the palms is so bad
that it requires the disqualification of the entire solve?  What
situation is being prevented here?  This situation is clearly so bad
that it is considered complete and utter cheating, and its result is
that the entire solve is completely invalid.

For the life of me I can&#x27;t think of anything that is possible to do in
the 0.10-0.30 second it can require to stop the timer that is so bad
it means everything for the solve done up to that point is completely
invalid.

As to the argument about starting with the palms, I can see how the
worry is that the cuber could do a move on the cube before starting
the timer.

Well I offer this solution.  Is it even physically possible to
manipulate the cube before removing your hand from the contact pads if
the cube is 2cm away from any part of either hand?  If it is, what if
you try 3cm?

Say we discover the number where no matter what your hand size, it is
physically impossible to manuever your hand in such a way as to do a
move on the cube without it being glaringly obvious to the judge, or
without it starting the timer.

Now take this distance and draw a V on the timer pad (I will mark this
out with tape of my timer and take a picture if you are confused on
what I mean).  The cube will be placed inside this V at the end of the
inspection and the width of the V is such that no hand size can reach
the cube without leaving the timer pad.

If you don&#x27;t see what I mean please say so and I will take a picture
of this done on my timer.  I can&#x27;t see any way it is possible to
manipulate the cube before starting the timer even if you start with
the palms right where they meet the wrist.

And I really am serious, can anyone describe to me a situation where
the stopping of the timer with the palms allows you to cheat in such a
way that is so immoral to the spirit of solving the cube in
competition that the entire solve must be thrown out?  Please, just
put it into simple words, because I can&#x27;t think of anything at all.  I
have been cubing for 8 years and I cannot think of a single thing that
can be done in 0.10-0.30 seconds when you stop the timer that is
*this* bad and is *cheating on this scale*.

And yes if you haven&#x27;t noticed I think this rule is absolutely
completely and utterly retarded.  I am using offensive language
because this rule offends me that much.  I don&#x27;t mean any offense to
any person in particular here, I am just angry in general that this
rule continues to exist when I think it is such a terrible and
horrible rule to have.

All cube manipulations are completely finished and contact with the

That, to me, is the purpose of the rule.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tyson,

Thanks for your response, I am glad that this issue is being brought
up again.

I want to ask another question though.  If touching the cube at the
same time you stop the timer (not even doing a move, but having it
rest against your hand) is cheating so badly that your entire solve is
disqualified, then why is it even allowed that putting the cube down
one move away from solved is not a DNF?  Adding 2 seconds to a cube
that is not solved, and disqualifying someone for simply *touching*
the cube as they put down the timer seems a little weird to me.

If I were to follow a bit of proportional thinking to punish these two
problems a bit more equally, then why don&#x27;t we consider any cube not
completely solved (up to the allowable misalignment) to be a DNF?  Or
to me it seems that putting down an unsolved cube is worse than
putting down a solved cube but touching it accidently, say by
proportional thinking if touching the cube diqualifies the solve,
maybe putting down an unsolved cube should disqualify the cuber from
that round entirely?

Clearly that is ridiculous, but you see what I mean in that this
situation doesn&#x27;t seem to make much sense?

Why punish an unsolved cube so lightly, and someone who ccorrectly and
fully solved the cube but *simply touched it* at the wrong time with a
diqualification of that solve?

Again I don&#x27;t mean any disrespect to you, I am asking this question to
the community in general.  How is touching the cube as you put down
the timer cheating so badly that the time is completely invalid, but
putting down a cube that is *not even solved* can be accepted as a
valid time with a penalty?  Can someone film themselves using this to
their advantage in such a way that is so immoral to the spirit of
cubing that it is even worse than putting down a cube that is not
solved?  In my eyes, not fully solving your cube is a big problem, and
should be penalized like it is.  But how is touching the cube, by
accident or on purpose, vastly more immoral than not even solving the
cube?  Clearly we view touching the cube as immeasurably worse than
putting down an unsolved cube, because it is punished so much more
harshly (or I should say, were the rule enforced at all, it would be
much more harsh).

My recommendation would be to either also disqualify solves where the
cube is not solved within the allowable limit, or to add a 2 second
penalty to a palm stop.

Sport stacking throws out an attempt if you are even touching a cup as
you stop the timer.  So to be in line with them (which we have done on
a number of cases) that would say that the +2 penalty needs to be
removed a those solves need to be disqualified completely.  I mean
they are not cheating any worse than accidently touching the cube as
you stop the timer.  

They had the brazen audacity to try to put the cube down a bit too
soon.  Or maybe it was an accident.

Someone who has the cube resting against their hand either had the
brazen audacity to try to cheat.  Or maybe it was an accident.

These situations seem similar to me, so let&#x27;s handle them similarly is
all I&#x27;m saying.

          <div class="email-content">Let me sum up the most important request I wanted to address in my<br>
last post, so it isn&#x27;t buried in other thoughts.  I see 2 issues here:<br>
<br>
Issue #1) If stopping with the palms is so bad (I still don&#x27;t see why)<br>
then maybe we should outright define speedcubing as: a) &quot;solving a<br>
Rubik&#x27;s cube on a stackmat such that the start at stopping of the<br>
timer must be done with fingers&quot;.  Therefore what is so bad about<br>
stopping with the palms is that it is not speedcubing.  Speedcubing<br>
has for years meant solving a cube as fast as possible, but now we<br>
have to solve on a timer.  So I say if this is the option taken, then<br>
speedcubing must be defined as solving on a stackmat while starting<br>
and stopping with the fingers.  *ANY* deviation from that is not<br>
speedcubing, and is completely unacceptable in competition.  If this<br>
route is taken, judge training must be more strict and this rule *has<br>
to be enforced*  Also I would highly recommend video review to be able<br>
to handle the really hard to make judgement calls.  If this is the<br>
option taken, I would think that video analysis should be a<br>
requirement for running a tournament.  All tournament directors would<br>
then have to provide their own camera equipment and the footage sent<br>
to a review board to check each solve for any potential new world or<br>
national record to make sure no palm starts or stops were made, since<br>
that is not speedcubing.<br>
<br>
Issue #2) The rules of putting down an unsolved cube and touching the<br>
cube as you stop are both cheating, so why is the worse one (not even<br>
solving your cube) the lightest punishment?  Either disqualify the<br>
unsolved cube case, or add a time penalty to the touching the cube as<br>
the timer stops rather than a DQ.  The two rules are essentially in<br>
the same vein, but one is punished so much more harshly than the other.<br>
<br>
------------<br>
<br>
If both of these issue are addressed then I promise I will not make<br>
any more of an issue with this.  These two things are what bug me the<br>
most about these rules.  Please let us at least discuss both issues here.<br>

Chris,

1) Rule enforcement (general)

A rule that is not enforced is a bad rule. But the equation is more
complex. When a rule is a bit tricky, or not well known because
applying to rare cases, you need trained people who can instantly
judge the right way.

2) Starting the timer

I thought about standardizing the puzzle-fingers distance, because
size of hands may differ, because the puzzle is not everytime at the
same place, because some puzzles are bigger, etc.
After all, &quot;fingers on the pad, and puzzle anywhere&quot; is not so bad:
a) You make sure the timer starts before the competitor manipulates
the puzzle.
b) It&#x27;s very simple, isn&#x27;t it? A minimum distance may cause more disputes.
It&#x27;s more natural to seize the puzzle when starting with the palms,
but it&#x27;s the same conditions for every competitor, and if you want my
opinion, it&#x27;s even more natural to cube without having to trigger a
timer :-)
I don&#x27;t get why you feel so bad about it.

3) Stopping the timer

We talked about it last time. The spirit of the rule is &quot;no physical
contact with the puzzle when stopping the timer&quot;, and you can&#x27;t be
wrong if you stop it with the fingers.
This unenforced rule should be rewritten. Maybe to &quot;no physical
contact with the puzzle when stopping the timer&quot; or simply &quot;no move
performed while stopping the timer&quot;?

4) &quot;Stopping when touching&quot; Vs &quot;Penalties&quot;

Excellent point!
Leading to the following options:
a) +2 penalty for &quot;stopping when touching&quot; (and DNF when the
competitor is obviously cheating). But what to do when the competitor
stops while *possibly* doing a move, and the puzzle is still one move
away from the solves state? Could be DNF.
b) The end of penalties.
If I remember correctly, you like penalties. I tend not to like them,
for the same reasons I&#x27;m happy the &quot;extra solve for POP&quot; disappeared.
Here&#x27;s my point.
Top speedcubers are incredibly talented. Taking the right amount of
risks should be one of their skills. I don&#x27;t know, it seems so obvious
to me. While solving (to prevent a lock up or anticipation errors) and
when finishing the solve before dropping a fully solved puzzle. When
you stop the timer, you physically validate you have finished your
solve. If you&#x27;re not sure of it, don&#x27;t validate. If you&#x27;re not sure
and you still validate, you have taken too much risk.
And if slower cubers sometimes lose 0.3 second making sure their solve
is okay, no bid deal.
But it&#x27;s a different topic.
c) +2 penalty at the judge&#x27;s discretion, when (s)he can&#x27;t tell for
sure the competitor stopped the timer before finishing.

No need to shout, we hear you, let&#x27;s find the best solution. The best
means the most simple and easy to enforce, without making speedcubing
a different sport. And it&#x27;s difficult in such grey zones, where you
have to rely on human judging.

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ll let Tyson give the definitive answer, but I assume the 
registration is to help accurately gauge the number of competitors.  
So if you register and intend to come, but later realize you can&#x27;t 
make it, you could always e-mail and notify the organizer(s) to that 
effect.

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s best to register only if you feel that there is a good chance to 
go.  If you aren&#x27;t sure if you can make it, feel free to register.  
Just don&#x27;t register if most likely, you can&#x27;t make it.

So yeah, go ahead and register if there if you think you can go.

That&#x27;s a point.

Would you be able to have a black DIY with white pieces for the cross
pieces for better recognition/faster inspection/resolution of the
cross? Or for the blocks in roux so that you effectivly ignore teh
rest of the cube at first.

I dunno if the rules say anything about it.

Categories planned cover the mein events 3x3x3 speedsolving, 3x3x3 <br>
blindfold, and additional events Square-1, 4x4x4, Magics, and depending <br>
on participants and their preferences there may be other ones...<br>
<br>
There will be one of the two inventors of Square-1 (Cube 21) Karel <br>
Hrsel at the competition, so you can meet him and get some puzzles <br>
signed :-).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris, Tyson, et al, (him again!)

If I may make a suggestion.

Since people&#x27;s hands come in different sizes:
When the contestant approaches the timer to solve, in a competition,
they lay the heel of a hand just beyond the foward edge of the touch
pads. The judge then places a strip, maybe tape, at the fingertips of
the contestant&#x27;s hand. The cube must then be placed on or beyond that
strip, with no part of the cube off the strip toward the contestant,
both before and after the solve. Then it doesn&#x27;t matter what part of
the contestants hands are used to start and stop the timer.

If a cube lands off to the side the same distance, that is, beyond the
hand&#x27;s length, then it is still fair.

Anyway, this would make it impossible to touch the cube with the hands
if the hands are on the touch pads.

Wouldn&#x27;t this be fair no matter the size of someone&#x27;s hands? 

Regards,

David J

A quick clarifying question on format, because information in a couple postings is 
contradictory:

Is the preliminary round of 3x3x3 going to be:
- Three solves, rank by best time of those three solves, or
- Five solves, rank by average (using middle three)

We&#x27;ve got both mentioned in the below thread, so I thought I&#x27;d check. The official website 
says &quot;Best of 3 solves. 36 advance.&quot;.

Followup question: the &quot;36 advance&quot; means you take results from both days (Fri and Sat), 
combine them, and the top 36 overall advance. Correct?

Thank you sir!

An-nyong haseyo. I&#x27;m not even going to attempt to continue in Korean but anyway...

In a 3x3x3 cube, turning a face involves turning 4 edges and 4 corners. 
A 4-cycle is an odd permutation (more generally an n-cycle is an odd permutation if n is 
even and an even permutation if n is odd) - that is to say, it is a product of an odd number 
of 2-cycles. (Any permutation can be broken down into a product of 2-cycles. For a given 
permutation the breakdown will either always involve an odd number of 2-cycles or will 
always involve an even number of 2-cycles. This can be proven using determinants of 
matrices.) 

(a b c d)=(a b)(a c)(a d) or (a d)(a c)(a b) depending on which way you prefer to read 
permutations (some read left to right, some read right to left). 

In particular any quarter turn can be written as a product of 3 2-cycles of corners and 3 2-
cycles of edges. 
So a sequence of n quarter turns amounts to a product of 3n 2-cycles of corners and 3n 
2-cycles of edges. 
If n is even then both the corner and edge permutation will be even. 
If n is odd then both the corner and edge permutation will be odd. 
They will both be odd or they will both be even. 
Switching 2 corners only (and no edges) is an odd permutation of corners and an even 
permutation of edges, so it isn&#x27;t possible. 
Switching 2 edges only (and no corners) is an odd permutation of edges and an even 
permutation of corners, so it isn&#x27;t possible. 

On a 4x4x4, turning a face moves 8 edges and 4 corners (and 4 centres). 
The edge permutation for a quarter turn is a product of 2 4-cycles, and so of 6 2-cycles, 
so it is even, but the permutation of corners is a 4-cycle and so is odd. It is possible to 
have an even permutation of one and an odd permutation of the other. 
To create an odd permuation of edges, one cannot use only face turns (one must slice - a 
quarter slice gives a double 4-cycles of centres (even) and a single 4-cycle of edges (odd) 
and doesn&#x27;t affect the corners (even).) 
The corner and centre permutations are thus both odd or both even (quarter slicing is 
even for centres and corners, quarter face turns is odd for centres and corners). 
It is possible to use slice moves to create an odd permutation of edges whilst not changing 
the corners (or indeed the centres). 
It is equally possible to create an odd permutation of corners (and centres) whilst not 
changing edges. 
An odd permutation of corners, of necessity, creates an odd permutation of centres. A 
pure switch (leaving centres, edges unchanged) is not possible. A pure switch of edges is 
possible.

Ok, you get a relative standard fingers-puzzle distance. It&#x27;s fair. I
like the idea, theoretically. 
But I think the main problem is at the end of the solve. Unless
someone explains me why starting with fingers flat on the pads is so
wrong.

Yes, of course, if you make sure the cube and the hands are in
different locations when stopping, the problem disappears.
Judging becomes easy, very objective, because you put an additional
clear physical constraint.

But what kind of constraint is acceptable?
Some cubers want to stop the timer so fast, they don&#x27;t have time to
think about finishing their last move, or they stop the timer with the
cube in their hand. If you are the man who has to tell them they must
drop the cube beyond a line, hire bodyguards before!

I have the same issue.

So special thanks to Chris Pelley, we&#x27;ve got a website for US Nationals 
2006:

http://www.chrisandkori.us/fw/main/U_S_Nationals_2006-1504.html

Go ahead and register online.  The website should contain all the 
information for everything.  I&#x27;m still working on competitor discounts 
for museum admission.  We&#x27;ll update that information on the website as 
it develops.

If the side it turned past a certain point, you will get +2. It is
defined here: http://www.speedcubing.com/events/regulations.html
The best way I have seen to influence the cube can be found here:
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/competitiontutorial.html
Scroll down to &quot;Putting the cube down after you&#x27;re done solving&quot;. His
videos are great for showing this. Just note, he is not touching the
cube when the timer is stoped. This is very important!

Good luck!

rotates while putting him down( throwing him down) and then he is
unsolved again. Does anyone know what effect this has in competition?
Is this + 2 seconds or disqualification? And does anyone see a way to
change this fluency of my cube?

You need very little information about how those functions behave near 
zero, so it may be possible to explain the result by drawing a simple 
diagram.

In my question was a mild reproach hidden. You put forward a very intriguing problem, someone guesses the answer and you hurry to say &quot;correct&quot;. And with that the motivation had gone for those, who would like to try to solve the problem. I myself was fascinated by such problems for more than a half century ago and was going to try. But now..
On the other hand you probably saved me from a total failure.

          <div class="email-content">This IS parity I believe. With regard to the edgeies, there remains a 
2-cycle, and a single 2-cycle is parity according to any applicable 
mathematical definition I can think of.

I use (l&#x27;U2l&#x27;U2)(F2l&#x27;F2)(rU2r&#x27;)(U2l2), but really the z2 conjugate to 
it...

I&#x27;ve only recently changed to this alg in the past few months.

It&#x27;s actaully not that uncommon of a problem, you *should* run into it 
one-half of the time, if you don&#x27;t pair edges first. Sometimes I don&#x27;t.

Also on the 4x4, the location of a piece determines/forces its 
orientation. Thus it was redundant to state taht they need to 
be &quot;exchanged and then oriented.&quot; (Well the &quot;then&quot; is wrong too, 
becasue you can&#x27;t do one and not the other.)

Well, it would be insulting to write &quot;Correct! Did you guess -- or 
use Mathematica -- or laboriously manipulate the series expansions -- 
or what?&quot;  

However:

Mmm... the very next reply was from someone saying &quot;oh, the problem 
is solved now&quot; (or similar).  The defeatism surprised me.

The interest, if any, isn&#x27;t in the &quot;answer&quot; of 1.

I incorrectly referred to Cory&#x27;s 27.80-second one-handed solve as a
&quot;winning&quot; solve. The solve was the fastest at the competition in that
event, and Cory did win that event, but his winning was based on the
average of his middle three solves, to my understanding.

I know not everybody likes the rules they way they are, but do you 
think it&#x27;s a good idea to encourage people to violate the rules??

I don&#x27;t see why someone who was sufficiently interested (and expert) 
shouldn&#x27;t try to find a simpler proof of it.  Preferably one that 
could be explained to me.  ;)

In the limit problem, we know before we start that

(1) the &quot;answer&quot; (a number) could always be found by straightforward 
(but laborious) methods of hand calculation; e.g., l&#x27;Hopital&#x27;s rule, 
or series expansion.

(2) this &quot;answer&quot; could be found (more easily and reliably) by using 
a standard maths package such as Mathematica, without the user ever 
knowing the method.

So the challenge is not simply to find the answer, but to find a 
method that you can feel happy about afterwards.

Rubik&#x27;s cube was first solved in the 1970s, and solution manuals have 
been available for many years.  There are even computer programs that 
will do it for you.  Why would anyone in 2006 want to sit down and 
work out a solution for themselves?

Indeed, that was my first official blindfolded solve.  I think I had

          <div class="email-content">I have an NTSC video camera where the frame rate is supposed to be
29.97 frames per second, and it seems to work fine. I have only been
to two competitions, and both of those competitions used the same
displays, to my understanding.  I notice in looking at my videos frame
by frame, that the Stackmat display seems to be updating the number
displayed about every .12 or .13 second or so, so that the same number
is displayed in three or four consecutive frames, and then skips ahead
to a different number. I may get an image that is a combination of
both numbers in a frame where the number is changing. I haven&#x27;t seen
any cases in my video where a digit that should be active is blank.

I know that manufacturers of electronic/electrical equipment may have
slightly different models for use in different countries, because of
language, line voltage, and  line frequency issues. So I don&#x27;t know if
the Stackmat displays in my videos are just like the one you&#x27;re using,
Gilles.

Also, the shutter speed of the camera may make a difference as well as
the frame rate. A short shutter speed could be part of the problem
you&#x27;re seeing.

I think b4 competitions, both judges and competitors should have very 
clear instructions about this...

Maybe it&#x27;s that, when he goes to pick up the cube, his wrist is 
hitting the Stackmat.  Still hard to tell, though.

As for the framerate, we can see that the timer first displays at 
0.09, then around every 0.10 to 0.15 seconds.  Just out of 
comparison, if you look at http://tinyurl.com/rqndl, the image for 
Macky&#x27;s 12.11 second world record shows his hands stopping the timer 
when it says 11.95 on the timer.  That means there was a delay of 
0.16 seconds (possibly more) on either the first generation timer or 
the first generation display.

I don&#x27;t really mind that judges are not too strict about this, or 
that competitors don&#x27;t know all the rules (I also don&#x27;t know 
everything perfectly), but we could at least try to instruct people 
about the rules properly. I think the only time i&#x27;ve seen 
instructions for competitors was at EC &#x27;04... they should do it more 
often.

Yes, just like when you take a plane. It&#x27;s only a matter of 1 minute<br>
or 2 for everybody to remember perfectly the basic rules for timing,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Yes, theres that problem too...No, before I was referring to the
problem of the timer skipping a second.  It happened to Bob at Dutch
Cube Day, and happened to me on the weekend.  Though the problem you
mentioned has happened to me quite a few times now, but only ever on
my newer of 2 timers...

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
We want the WCA website to be cool and up-to-date.<br>
Currently the website www.worldcubeassociation.org is &quot;ugly&quot;, lacks <br>
some important features and is hardly updated.<br>
<br>
So we need one or two (serious!) people who make a new design and <br>
implementation of the website.<br>
<br>
We have tried this before but found out that it takes dedication <br>
from people to make it happen. This is not something that you do in <br>
1 day and then you are ready. It takes some creativity, design <br>
skills, good knowledge of a popular web content management system <br>
and a lot of time!<br>
<br>
We want a site that:<br>
= looks like what you would expect from an official <br>
organization: professional and interesting<br>
= loads fast<br>
= simple to update by non-technical people<br>
= uses a popular CMS (see http://www.opensourcecms.com ) with PHP <br>
and MySQL<br>
<br>
The site will offer all official stuff and the rest will be a <br>
slightly interactive site with interesting functionality.<br>
Ideas:<br>
= organization information (board, reports and so on)<br>
= regulations (including tournament information sets)<br>
= events (past and upcoming)<br>
= records and rankings<br>
= profiles (interactive stuff)<br>
= news<br>
= contact information<br>
= your ideas...<br>
For the world rankings we need to finalize the competition pages so <br>
that we can put all official results on the WCA site. Josef Jelinek <br>
is doing that part of the site.<br>
<br>
Example websites:<br>
= http://www.iaaf.org/<br>
= http://www.uefa.com/<br>
= http://www.fina.org/<br>
<br>
If you are interested, serious, are willing to spend the required <br>
time and know what it takes to make the WCA site a big success, then <br>
please send me an e-mail.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

All of you solving 4x4 and cubes of higher order, why not try to find 
corresponding &quot;algs&quot; for those to be used as a standard &quot;prescrambling&quot;?

Sorry, I forgot about that. I think a few people got it pretty much
right in that there was no more than two of each colour on each side.
There were no adjacent matching colours, and you could see all six
colours on each side.

Ah, thanks. I saw those responses, but wondered if you were quietly 
chuckling while everyone was barking up the wrong tree. Misery ended. :)

Is that the shortest sequence that creates these conditions?

I assume so. The nearest I&#x27;ve seen to this is 9 moves.

I am a serious web developer with serious skills and also a serious 
lack of free time, and I believe I am not the only one. That&#x27;s why I 
cannot offer to create a website, but why not try the open source 
idea of lots of people doing small amounts of work? I am willing to 
give advice and occasionally do a little programming or styling.

Ron, I&#x27;m Drei harte on the forums. WHile I might not have perfect website 
crafting skills, I certainly can keep the forums up and running, even take 
the place of updating. I mean, If I had some time, I could figure out how to 
make the site more Appealing.  Maybe I can get a chance? Sorry for just

make sure it was solvable but I didn&#x27;t managed to do the moves correctly so
I just worked on it.

I still think that my method has a very impressive start  : double
transformation + first flip = 2/3 of the tiles aligned correctly.
But 4 or 5 of them are just on the other side of where they are supposed to
go so it takes a little time :-(

Thanks for the slow video :-)

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Starting from next week the FMC at Dan&#x27;s CubeStation will undergo some big<br>
changes.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The system will be much more automatic compared to the current system, and<br>
has one or two nifty featues.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You now need an FMC Account to submit solutions to the FMC. If you have<br>
participated in the FMC before, then if I have an email address for you, I<br>
will send you your username and password. Sometime after 12pm on Sunday, I<br>
shall launch the new FMC pages, and once they are online, you will be able<br>
to update your user details by logging onto your account via the FMC control<br>
panel. I recommend that you check your details carefully and make any<br>
corrections if I entered anything in wrong. If you have participated in the<br>
FMC before, and haven&#x27;t received details of your account, then please send<br>
me an email at fmc@... <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
If you&#x27;ve never participated in the FMC before, then you can easily create<br>
an account to allow you to submit your entries,<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The new system will automatically check and validate your solution, and<br>
either prevent you from submitting if your solution is invalid, or count up<br>
all the necessary move counts so all you need to enter is your user/pass and<br>
a quote if you want to. I have to approve solutions before they will be<br>
displayed on the results page after the challenge deadline expires.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Only your most recent solution up until the deadline will count.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I am not expecting the transition to be smooth, I am sure there will be some<br>
glitches along the way, but please bear with me and I am sure that we will<br>
be able to sort them out as they appear. If you find any bugs, please report<br>
them to me on fmc@... <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
If anything major happens, then I will revert back to the old system, and<br>
try to fix it offline :) <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I really hope that you will enjoy the new system, thank you for making the<br>
FMC a great competition to run. Many many thanks to Charlie Tsai and Craig<br>
Vincent, without who the new system would not be possible, I am forever<br>
indebted to you guys.<br>

But there is a very little problem : I cannot perform the very first flips.
As you can see here : 
http://www.belgiancubes.be/videos/MagicBalls-Problem.wmv

Do I have problems with my eyes or is there a problem with my puzzle ? :p

Thanx :p

I will tell you if I find anything for the final steps.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Gilles,

I think I am the best to answer your question, as I restrung the full
thing 2-3 times, half 3-4 times, and just a few pieces 1-2 times...You
have the strings on backwards, happened to me my first try.  I was
quite bothered, and I still have to fix my puzzle again, as one of the
inserts got twisted 90 degrees on one side...So...yah...I&#x27;ve gotten a
lot better at restringing now tho :):)

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

Well the main thing is that you have to know your color scheme.
With white on the bottome, you have blue -> red -> green -> orange -> blue
.....
(I have a cube with 5 sides lol :D)

Plus with training you will be able to generate the entire sequence of moves
to solve the cross during pre-inspection. (Cases are quite similar even
though there are lots of them.)

So I just recommend you to take some time and just train on it. You will get
used to it if you want to use this technique.

An advantage of this technique is that it allows you to foresee some F2L
pieces and of course you do not have to rotate the cube. But everyone
remembers Jean Pons&#x27; 11.75 second solve at the Dutch Open 2005....

Have fun !
Gilles.

Well we can&#x27;t put the pads further apart, can we? 

Or have the touch pads up instead of down? That would have to adjustable.

The spirit of any rule there would be that the cube is no longer
deliberately changed after the timer is stopped. 

Conceivably someone could stop the timer with both palms and still be
holding the cube which was solved. Is seeing this clearly beyond the
ken of judges? 

Could there be a video camera placed for when there is a need for a
judgment call?

Could we be allowed to stop the timer with one hand on one pad and the
press the other pad with the cube itself? 

The idea I like best: how about something like a small sticker on the
cube, which if someone is touching the cube and the pad, a connection
is made which will prevent the timer from stopping. Then the
contestant must make sure that he&#x27;s not touching the cube. Can that be
done?

Cheers,

David J

By the way, I got 8.18 the day after making it and haven&#x27;t improved 
since...well, I haven&#x27;t really been able to practice since.

I definately need to make the transform that changes shape to a huge 
rectangle and back better, but my main point I need to work on is 
the end, specifically the transform on the right arm.  Bob, your 
videos will be a tremendous help.

Well, I&#x27;m exhausted from ARML, so I&#x27;ll shut up before I become 
completely incoherent.

<br>
Thanks for the responses I got from people about silicone.  I had an <br>
offer to mail some to me, but I checked the post office restrictions <br>
on hazardous items in the mail, and it looks like you can&#x27;t mail <br>
flammable liquids (silicone is highly flammable).  However, I&#x27;m <br>
confused because there is a site online where I can order silicone to <br>
have it shipped to my house (but I have to order minimum 12 cans at <br>
$48) :-(<br>
<br>
Is it ok to mail silicone via the post office?  If so, I&#x27;m going to <br>
respond to the offer I got.  Because I cannot find a safe silicone to <br>
use for cubing anywhere in my area, and my cubes badly need to be <br>
lubed!! :&#x27;-(<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hahaha. Just great. I had some friends that were (ironically
naturally) celebrating the end of the world (06/06/06 == 666) tonight.
But then I read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/616_%28number%29.
A 6x6x6 cube would be a much better reason for celebration. Today I
got a look at a 4x4x4 for the first time in my life (got my rubiks.com
delivery).

Happy cubing everyone, here at the end of the world.

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve done this,  but I know it&#x27;s possible to
ship flammable and hazardous materials through USPS and UPS.  The
restrictions come down from DOT on what items can be shipped based on
how the materials are classified.  They also restrict on how it&#x27;s
packaged and labeled,  and if it can be transported by air,  ground, 
or rail.  If it&#x27;s still the same as it was eight or nine years ago,  I
think UPS only ships hazardous materials from a contracted business. 
You really just need to visit a Post Office with a can and ask them if
it can be shipped because everything is classified somewhere in the
huge library of CFR manuals.  I would guess you could probably get it
through,  but you&#x27;d have to talk to the Post Office guys to get the
final say and the labels anyway.

          <div class="email-content">Dear Cubers,<br>
          I am very glad to share my experience with ZEE TV. Zee tv is producing a new episode called &quot;SHABASH INDIA&quot; means WELL DONE INDIA. I am lucky to have been selected for my cubing. Cubing is a alien sport in India. I know only 3 cubers in entire India.<br>
          They(Zee tv crews) came home in dec-2005 and filmed me cubing fast and blindfolded. They also interviewed my parents, friends, school teachers and principal etc. They filmed me in the park also.<br>
           They invited me to Bombay(more than 2000 km from my home town) for studio interview on 27th may 2006. They welcomed me to the studio amidst young girls dancing around me. They asked me how I learnt it. As I do not know HINDI, there was a interpretor for me. One of the audiences was called upon to scramble a 3*3*3 cube and I was asked to solve blindfolded. I did it perfectly. The anchor Mr.Hussain, a Bollywood actor was very friendly and jovial. Then he questioned my dad who was sitting in the audience - how do you feel about your son&#x27;s achievement, how you trained him, how he got interest in it, what is the history behind the invention of the cube etc. Then he asked me how I memorised the cube, but failed to ask me how to solve a cube!!!!<br>
            All the other cubes 4*4*4, 5*5*5, 2*2*2, megaminx and square-1 were also available on the stage. But he never asked me anything about them for want of time.<br>
           My episode is number 3 and will be telecast in the last week of june-2006. The duration is 30 min and I shall let you know the exact date and time of telecast as soon as I am intimated.<br>
           Hope my cubing show in ZEE TV might inspire many youngsters in India and other countries to learn cubing. <br>
           I watched many other people performing different items. It was all fun. My dad performed 2 items - human calendar(1600 to 9999) and a deck of 52 cards. His episode is number 22 and will be telecast in august-2006.<br>

Do you receive emails in plain text or html? I receive them in plain text
and the formatting is pretty bad. The messages are still perfectly readable,
so I don&#x27;t mind...the new email format is just weird.

          <div class="email-content">I have uploaded some more videos from the Trumbull competition.

Craig&#x27;s 5x5x5 solves for a Canadian record average:
http://tinyurl.com/zocyn

Matt&#x27;s Canadian record single 5x5x5 solve:
http://tinyurl.com/zh2av

I believe this record was broken a number of times that day by Matt
and Craig, with Matt ending up with the record when it was over.

Three of Anthony&#x27;s 2x2x2 solves where he set the American record
average time.
http://tinyurl.com/f232o

Anthony&#x27;s 14.00-second solve:
http://tinyurl.com/kjf2m

Three of Matt&#x27;s 3x3x3 solves for a Canadian record average time, and
Matt after finishing his 13.94-second solve.
http://tinyurl.com/zg57w

Craig&#x27;s 10.71-second 2x2x2 solve, part of his Canadian record for
average time.
http://tinyurl.com/kl98k

I had also recorded his 22.74-second solve, but a judge was blocking
the view for most of the solve. (And anyway, even I can usually solve
a 2x2x2 in less time than that.) So I didn&#x27;t upload that one.

Four of Matt&#x27;s 4x4x4 solves for a Canadian record average time.
http://tinyurl.com/gwuck

Craig&#x27;s winning BLD solve for a Canadian record:

I&#x27;ll also note here that these links will not work forever. The files
may disappear after not being downloaded during a period of 30 days or
so. Enjoy!

bit, then a perpendicular outermost layer just a  little bit. You
know, get it so the thing isn&#x27;t blowing up, but where there&#x27;s a little
hole in between 4 of the little facelets. Spray some silicon in each
of the little holes on your cube (there&#x27;s 54 holes possible on a
revenge and 96 holes possible on a professor). That way, you don&#x27;t
have to deal with assembly.

  Nobody else has replied to this but I think it would be cool if you could get your program 
  to keep track of rolling averages!

I&#x27;m certainly not the best sq1 solver in the group, but my

David; email me directly and I will reply with all the algs you need

the Square1 is dreadfully unexplored.  It&#x27;s good to see at least one

          <div class="email-content">For me, not lubing was not even an option.  Even a single solve on
either the revenge or the professor left my hands aching.  Playing
with either for an extended amount of time (more than 1/2 hour) caused
pain that I could still feel the next day.

If you can comfortably play with your puzzles without hurting your
hands/wrists, then I guess lubing is up to you.  After I took apart
and lubed my revenge and prof, they became completely different
puzzles.  They&#x27;re now both very easy to turn, and neither one has ever
popped on me.

Does anybody have any stories about lubing their cubes and making them
too loose?  I can&#x27;t imagine this happening after just lubing the
puzzle once.

          <div class="email-content">Okay. Yes I can actually feel some pain after the 3-4 solves I did
yesterday, so I guess that settles it.

I forgot to ask another thing; how do I disassemble the Revenge from
rubiks.com? I read in another old thread that there&#x27;s supposed to be a
screw of some kind behind one of the center stickers, but I can&#x27;t
figure out which one (I don&#x27;t want to needlessly remove a sticker). Am
I supposed to feel this screw underneath the sticker? Is it behind the
white center piece with the Rubik&#x27;s logo on it?

Elvis

You should contact http://rubicscube.com to get imformation about this.
http://seventowns.com owns the copyright on the image. I did this to get the
permission to use their image on my cube webpage. They are protective of
their symbol and I was told by someone there to use the official Rubic&#x27;s
color scheme in images and to show a link to their websites. Since you are a
company, there may be more involved.

          <div class="email-content">Hey elvstone, it&#x27;s Swordsman_Kirby. :P And uh, it&#x27;s a VERY good idea 
to lube your 4x4. I got my hands on an Eastsheen 4x4 that my friend 
has, and it&#x27;s just about impossible to turn since it&#x27;s unlubed. Use 
your cube for another day, turning it a lot to break it in, then 
lube it.

          <div class="email-content">The one problem with lubed big cubes is that when you &quot;speedbuild&quot; them,
then your hands are really dirty.
I speedbuilded my 5x5 earlier today and got 13 minutes and 57 seconds but I
had a lot of problems. Sub10 is really possible. :p

          <div class="email-content">Hey Swordsman_Kirby! Yep that&#x27;s just what I did and now it&#x27;s much
better. I&#x27;m still reaaaaally slow with the 4x, but that&#x27;s just because
I do each edge pair one by one, and I only know the most basic parity
fixes.. I&#x27;ll work on that though!

I did a PB on the 3x today too, 35.39 ;)

Elvis

          <div class="email-content">Yea I found Chris Hardwick&#x27;s chained 2-pair thingie. It&#x27;s the first
thing I&#x27;ll look at to better my times.

I&#x27;ve only done maybe 5 solves so far, I&#x27;ve been busy working. The
first time I solved it I wanted to see if I could solve it without
looking at any solutions, and I did the entire cube but hit one LL
parity with no chance of just figuring it out by myself, bummer! ;)

I timed myself just with the clock on the wall twice today. The first
solve I got confused, or well I actually forgot an edge pair and
didn&#x27;t realize it until late into F2L ;) It took me maybe 7-8 minutes.
The second solve went better and was right below 5 minutes.

So you see I have some work to do!

Elvis

          <div class="email-content">Hello,
  I am fairly new to this whole speedcubing deal as well.  I solved my
first cube in late February, and within a few weeks, Ill have all the
F2L (one slot) algs, PLL algs, and OLL algs down. After that, I&#x27;ll
work on multislotting the F2L and that will get me sub-20 easily.  I
never thought I would be able to pull off finger tricks, but now I can
fairly well.  I think it is just practice, practice, and more
practice.  Watch some videos of the sub-20 solves, and then that will
inspire you to just go at it.  You want to learn algs so that when you
see which alg you need to perform, your fingers just snap at it,
without having to think, or even look at the cube.  Good luck.

          <div class="email-content">Thank you very much. It was just a perfect average. None of the times
were lucky, but they were all very fluid. I was very nervous after
three solves because I knew that one good solve more would give me the
WR. I&#x27;m very hppy that I did 5 excellent solves. It&#x27;s not easy when
you&#x27;re as nervous as I was.

It was nice to meet David Wesley too. He had been practicing for a
week before the contest, so his times were really great.

David wanted to participate in the bigger cubes too. But he had to
leave for a birthday party (I think it was his own).

While Gunnar have broken the national records for 3x3 and 4x4, David&#x27;s
5x5 times from Toronto still stands. And I am sure he still can make
impressive times.

It is intended to be a database of move sequences for different<br>

will only input valid and serious move sequences for each case. I<br>
expect there to be bugs, so please let me know if something weird<br>
happens.<br>
<br>
To input a new move sequence, you use the same keyboard control as<br>
with the Rubik&#x27;s Cube Simulator. Try to input sequences close to the<br>
way in which you would perform them on a real physical cube, as the<br>
idea is to present alternative ways of performing the same sequence,<br>
or alternative sequences for the same case.<br>
<br>
One caveat: when inputting a sequence, it will not be accepted until<br>
the cube is returned to its home orientation. That is, you must return<br>
the cube to the position with red on top and blue on front.<br>

Jessica Fridrich and Lars Petrus are to thank for publishing two of the<br>

shows how to move the sides of the cube; Dan Knights for his video<br>
database showing how to perform sequences with the hands; Doug Li for<br>

Mine is yet another one, but its goals are to show how to perform the<br>
sequences with the hands, as best as is possible through computer<br>

something I am planning to do.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I know this is very off topic, so I invite any responses to my e-mail<br>
rather than on the group if you would rather not clutter up the group.<br>
<br>
I have been doing sudoku&#x27;s on and off, and am currently in an on<br>
craze, and doing them a lot.  I have a book with a lot of sudokus, and<br>
one of those hand held sudoku generators.  I try to only do the<br>
hardest ones from the book, and the highest level on the hand held game.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not fast at all, but I consider myself halfway decent because I<br>
haven&#x27;t yet found one I can&#x27;t solve.<br>
<br>
My question is about a certain strategy I have been using, I wonder if<br>
there are other (i.e. more efficient) ones.  When I get to the point<br>
where I can&#x27;t look at all the rows and columns and see if I can find<br>
that it&#x27;s only possible for one space in that row or column to be a<br>
certain number, or to use the same idea with each square in a box,<br>
then I call this &quot;the wall&quot;.  It&#x27;s the point where even looking at<br>
every square and seeing which numbers are allowed to fit there and not<br>
finding a new number anywhere doesn&#x27;t give you a new number to place.<br>
<br>
Whenever I get here I look for any situation where there are only two<br>
possibilities.  Say a pair of squares can be either (1,4) or the<br>
reverse (4,1).  I then mentally place one of the options (say 4,1) and<br>
see what happens.  I mentally make a bunch of moves on the board<br>
(having two new squares usually makes finding others easy) and see if<br>
I can run into a contradiction (placing two of the same number in some<br>
box, row or column, or having one square required to be two different<br>
numbers).<br>
<br>
If I run into a contradiction, I can move forward by placing the other<br>
pair.  If I make a lot of moves and don&#x27;t run into a contradiction I<br>
try the other pair and see if I get a contradction that way.  Every<br>
time I have tried this and the first pair led to no contradiction, the<br>
second try (the reverse order) always did.<br>
<br>
I never write down my test moves, I always just memorize where I am<br>
placing new numbers.  I tend to do about 5-15 moves when doing this<br>
before either trying the other pair (maybe there is no contradiction<br>
the way I am trying) or finding one if it is there.  Sometimes this<br>
can be a very time consuming process (I&#x27;m not fast at all at solving a<br>
Sudoku).<br>
<br>
Is there a better strategy than to search for a contradiction?  I mean<br>
specifically for when you hit that point where even doing an<br>
exhaustive search of each square/cell does not lead to any new<br>
information.  By exhaustive search I mean looking at what can fit in<br>
all cells, and using information and tricks like some row of 3 cells<br>
in a box must contain a 4, so even though a 4 is not there, use the<br>
information that one will have to be there to see if that effects<br>
other boxes/rows/columns.<br>
<br>
So far I am sticking with this &quot;try to achieve a contradiction&quot;<br>
approach, even if it is very slow.  I tend to use this contradiction<br>
approach once every puzzle (I try to only do the hardest any time I<br>
have a choice).  I just finished a sudoku that was literally the<br>
hardest one I have ever done.  It took me 3.5 hours to do in three<br>
sittings about 1 hour each.  I had to use the contradiction approach<br>
three times, and on one of those tries I made 15 mental moves before<br>
finding the contradiction (all done with memory, no writing down). <br>
That puzzle prompted me to ask this question, since this approach is<br>
so time consuming.  It absolutely works, but it&#x27;s slow.<br>
<br>
Is there an easier way, or should I stick with this one?<br>
<br>

The contradiction approach is pretty much a standard technique at that point so far as I know.  Being you I guess you&#x27;ve picked up pretty much all of the little tricks etc that you can use before you get to that point (sounds like it).  I don&#x27;t know of anything any cleverer anyway!  by the way have you tried Kakuro - that seems to be the second biggest &#x27;seller&#x27; of that type of puzzle and I think has more scope and depth than Sudoku.  Both great fun though!<br>

This is a very nice applet, but the only problem is that it is hard to 
read what is on the buttons (solutions and post a new solution).
Otherwise it is kinda nice, but it would be good to have the algorithm too.

What do you think ?

He had to leave, so there was no time for him to compete in the bigger

<br>
The second is an attempt to make black text on grey background.<br>

I&#x27;d prefer the first if it works, but if not, I&#x27;ll make it the second.<br>

The problem is that there isn&#x27;t yet any notation to describe the kinds<br>
of move that my applet supports (or moves that my applet may support<br>

hope to get around to. What I need to do is compile a list of all of<br>
the finger tricks that are presently known, and build them into the<br>
notation. That way, I can also accurately animate how the hands<br>
perform a sequence.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Duncan,

Thanks for the help.  That&#x27;s good to know that this is a standard 
approach.  I&#x27;ve never read any strategy books on sudoku, I just 
started with the really really easy ones in the book I have and worked 
up from there.

I was mostly worried that I was missing some number somewhere whenever 
I get to that point and decide to use the contradiction approach.  It 
seems like maybe it&#x27;s always possible at that point to find a number 
somewhere using some clever trick, but sometimes no matter how hard I 
look I can&#x27;t find one.  At that point I figure it would be better to 
just to find a contradiction.

The only problem with that, is that apparently it&#x27;s possible to have a 
puzzle where that approach is needed more than once (unless I just 
missed some number somewhere).  I do try to go slowly and carefully, 
rather than quickly, but I can still see how maybe a clue was hidden 
somewhere and I didn&#x27;t find it.

Thanks for the help, I&#x27;ll also give Kakuro a shot.  I&#x27;ve never heard 
of it to be honest, but I think google can quickly fix that for me ;-)

Thanks for the help!
Chris

get to that point (sounds like it).  I don&#x27;t know of anything any 
cleverer anyway!  by the way have you tried Kakuro - that seems to be 
the second biggest &#x27;seller&#x27; of that type of puzzle and I think has 
more scope and depth than Sudoku.  Both great fun though!

          <div class="email-content">Hey David,

I feel pretty comfortable with most of those strategies, and I think I
already use almost all of them to at least some extent.

However, I had never really thought about that &quot;swordfish&quot; one, that&#x27;s
something that I want to try to use!  I had never thought to do that.

I think I often use the advanced techniques to find my options for
Nishio if I am getting stuck and no other strategy works.  I have also
used the &quot;X-wing&quot; and &quot;forcing chains&quot; options a lot.  I&#x27;m surprised I
never thought of the swordfish, which is just a more general type of
X-wing idea, but I&#x27;m glad I know about it now!

The swordfish thing is probably one that could save me from doing
Nishio when I get stuck and nothing else seems to work.  Nishio works,
but it&#x27;s very, very time consuming!

I also seem to be one of the weirdos, I enjoy doing the puzzles where
I only write down the final numbers in the cells, and try to remember
all the pairs, and Xwings and other options in my head.  The downside
is that it takes me some time to come back into a half finished puzzle
if I put it down for a while.  I like it though, it&#x27;s a brain workout,
but that probably explains why I&#x27;m very slow at these.  10-20 minutes
for a harder puzzle is awesome!  I average about 90 minutes for the
hardest level puzzles, but my record is 25 minutes on one from one of
my books.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cheating to write the information you find out
down, it seems like it would be much more efficient.  I just like the
memory test of doing it without writing anything down but the final
numbers.  I often have to spend some time just memorizing the
information I&#x27;ve found out (usually pairs where I have 2 options to go
from there, and I may use it for a Nishio attempt later).  It&#x27;s fun,
but I&#x27;ll never win any contest for speed sudoku lol.

Have there been dry spells before leading up to the release of a new

Both are test versions which try to fix the bug in different ways (and<br>
did not exist yesterday, so that&#x27;s not so weird). I&#x27;m glad they work,<br>
but I&#x27;m confused that they both show black text for you. In<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,

I&#x27;ve also been wondering about this, but I think there are a few reasons.

1) The rubiks forum is a very nice forum, and is doing very well.  If
you haven&#x27;t tried it, give it a shot!  http://rubiks.has.it
2) People seem to be busy even on other groups, maybe because it&#x27;s
summer?  I&#x27;m a member of a few different yahoo groups and they&#x27;ve all
been very slow lately.  Even the rubiks forum has been slow lately.

The 6x6x6 is also keeping me in suspense, but I want to post too! ;-)

Andy, Harris, and I have done 9.xx, 11.xx, and 12.xx respectively with
skips. We&#x27;re not posting &quot;lucky&quot; times. That said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s
possible to go much faster without a very easy case.

Ryan, what&#x27;s the limit for number of moves per second on this applet?
Sometimes I type the moves for PLL and have to wait for the cubes to
finish turning after I stop typing.

Consider that if I let you perform moves as fast as you can type them,<br>
you could probably achieve 7 second non-lucky solves(*). That would be<br>
an interesting game, but a different one (that I might set up one<br>
day). The grand plan includes actually having different divisions for<br>
different values of the maximum rotation speed constant.<br>

(*) How fast can you perform the sequence R&#x27;ULU&#x27;RUL&#x27;U&#x27; on my applet?<br>

I did it perfectly. The anchor Mr.Hussain, a Bollywood actor was very friendly and jovial. Then he questioned my dad who was sitting in the audience - how do you feel about your son&#x27;s achievement, how you trained him, how he got interest in it, what is the history behind the invention of the cube etc. Then he asked me how I memorised the cube, but failed to ask me how to solve a cube!!!!

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

There should be an option to turn off the animation or alternatively 
option for animation speed. This can be done with a screen before 
the &quot;cube screen&quot; so that the parameters for the applet can be 
scripted with the desired animation settings.

Cheers!

Hi Per, there is a &quot;grand plan&quot; which goes as follows: a multi-player<br>
Rubik&#x27;s Cube game server, where you can login and compete against<br>
other cubists in real time, or against yourself, either in<br>
asynchronous head-to-head battles, or turn based synchronous battles,<br>
and either for speed or few moves, and for either seeing or<br>
blindfolded solving, and for 3 different settings of the maximum<br>
rotation speed constant (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;slow&quot;). Spectators will be<br>
able to login anonymously and watch realtime battles. Members will<br>
have statistics including their overall rankings.<br>
<br>
For the current game, the goal is to set the rotation speed limit<br>
close to the apparent physical speed limit. I suspect the current<br>
limit of 6.25 moves per second needs to be at 9 moves per second, but<br>
I don&#x27;t have enough data to go and changes things -- and invalidate<br>
the current list of records -- yet.<br>
<br>
The order of tasks on my todo list goes something like this:<br>
<br>
- add a &quot;lucky solve&quot; checkbox for submitting lucky solves<br>
- add a &quot;rolling average&quot; records list on the left side of the page<br>
- allow simultaneous rotations on different axes<br>
- make 180 degree turns faster<br>
- begin work on the grand plan<br>
<br>
The &quot;rolling average&quot; feature will give me a better indication of what<br>
the rotation speed limit should be for emulating physical cubing.<br>
<br>
There are, however, at the moment, I am busy building some new<br>
features for the cube database:<br>
<br>
- Allow individual cubists to mark which sequences they personally use<br>
- Use this data to sort solutions according to their popularity, and<br>
also allow users to view the set of solutions preferred by a<br>
particular cubist<br>
- Sort solutions by cube rotation<br>
- ... and some other features which overlap with the speed simulator<br>

This behaviour is now implemented in the Cube Database and shows up in<br>
many of the PLL sequences:<br>
<br>
    http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/database/<br>
<br>
I will transfer this behaviour over to the speed version of the applet<br>
at some point, except that: the speed version will execute any move<br>
more quickly (not just 180 degree turns) if there is a backlog of<br>
moves waiting to be animated.<br>

<br>
  Hey guys,<br>
<br>
  I haven&#x27;t been posting in this group much anymore... Actually I <br>
  haven&#x27;t been able to do serious training on the cube for a little <br>
  while, because of other work I have to do. But today I ran into a <br>
  game, and I think a lot of people here will like it:<br>
<br>
  http://www.microgames.info/game_info.php?products_id=205<br>
<br>
  enjoy ;)<br>

          Is there a way to resume the game ?
I&#x27;m stuck at the level 16 (poor, I know) but I kinda have to go now, too 
bad :-(

That game is really nice, but too simple. Took me around 1½ hours, I
think. If more faces of the cube were used, it would be harder. 23 was
definately my favourite, it&#x27;s really beautiful :)

That&#x27;s great!  I actually witnessed this going on in one of the 1982 
competitions (Chicago Cube-a-Thon).  Back then the judging was not one-
on-one, so more shenanigans went on.  Fortunately the people that had 
to resort to this kind of trickery were slow enough not to advance to 
finals.

But what&#x27;s the deal with the F2L video?

Note that he turns the front face 180 degrees, then the left side 90 
degrees clockwise.  In standard notation, the first turn would be F2 
and the second would be L.  So, putting them together, we get...F2 L 
[F2L]

Took me two viewings to get it.  I groaned out loud when I figured 
it out :)

There are 30 levels. I just finished level 30, it took me about an 
hour and a half to do all the levels also. That was a very cool 
game, but some of the levels were very easy I thought.

23 and 27 were my favorites, both had very cool solutions.

30 was kind of interesting too, but not as hard as 23 or 27 for me.

Very cool game, are there more like it?

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been working on the 3x3x3 a lot lately, and have noticed that I<br>
get better averages when I am very, very, very careful and hardly ever<br>
take risks.<br>
<br>
I do extended cross a lot, with dual solving I should theoretically do<br>
it a little over 50% of the time, but I don&#x27;t quite do it 50-50.  I&#x27;d<br>
say closer to 40% of the time.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve noticed that I often do the extended cross only when I&#x27;ve spotted<br>
the 2x2x2 and have a rough idea of where the other two cross edges<br>
will be as I solve the 2x2x2.  Sometimes this ends up being fast, as I<br>
can track the other cross edges while solving the 2x2x2.  Other times<br>
though the other cross pieces are out of sight, or blocked by my hand,<br>
and I usually end up having a delay to find them later.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve noticed that I get better averages when I only do extended cross<br>
when I am certain that I will never have pieces out of sight, or when<br>
I can track all of them during inspection.  Sometimes I can just see<br>
the Xcross, so no big deal.  Other times, if I only see the 2x2x2, I<br>
used to always do Xcross.  Now I only do Xcross when I am certain that<br>
I can track the other two cross edges.  I&#x27;ve even done just cross when<br>
my brain was screaming at me to do Xcross, but I still got a fast<br>
solve in the end.<br>
<br>
It just seems that by not taking any risks, or any gambles, that I<br>
seem to be able to get better averages.<br>
<br>
Does anyone else notice they do better when they aren&#x27;t taking risks?<br>
 I&#x27;ve always heard that better people take risks, and in competitions<br>
they are meant to force you to be a little more careful.  Well I think<br>
maybe I&#x27;m weird or something, but I&#x27;ve noticed that by hardly ever<br>
taking risks I tend to do better.<br>
<br>
How can I take &quot;good&quot; risks?  That seems to be the key to getting<br>
faster averages.<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help,<br>

<br>
My take is that speedsolving is not the time to take risks.<br>
<br>
Always going for simple and stupid things is not the ideal either.<br>
<br>
I think the best is if you find an interesting situation like this  <br>
while speed practicing, stop the timer, and try to think it through,  <br>
learn what&#x27;s interesting about the situation and how to handle it.  <br>
Perhaps try speed solving it several times.<br>
<br>
Then, the NEXT time to encounter a similar position, it will not be a  <br>
risky gamble, but a well known situation that you know how to handle  <br>
at full speed.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s of course a lot of work, and I haven&#x27;t personally done it much  <br>
the last 25 years. But back then I spent half my time trying to solve  <br>
for fewest moves, which teaches you a LOT that you can never learn  <br>
while speeding, and that over time translates into speed cubing.<br>

          Hi everyone,

I&#x27;ve been working on the 3x3x3 a lot lately, and have noticed that I
get better averages when I am very, very, very careful and hardly ever
take risks.

I do extended cross a lot, with dual solving I should theoretically do
it a little over 50% of the time, but I don&#x27;t quite do it 50-50. I&#x27;d
say closer to 40% of the time.

I&#x27;ve noticed that I often do the extended cross only when I&#x27;ve spotted
the 2x2x2 and have a rough idea of where the other two cross edges
will be as I solve the 2x2x2. Sometimes this ends up being fast, as I
can track the other cross edges while solving the 2x2x2. Other times
though the other cross pieces are out of sight, or blocked by my hand,
and I usually end up having a delay to find them later.

I&#x27;ve noticed that I get better averages when I only do extended cross
when I am certain that I will never have pieces out of sight, or when
I can track all of them during inspection. Sometimes I can just see
the Xcross, so no big deal. Other times, if I only see the 2x2x2, I
used to always do Xcross. Now I only do Xcross when I am certain that
I can track the other two cross edges. I&#x27;ve even done just cross when
my brain was screaming at me to do Xcross, but I still got a fast
solve in the end.

It just seems that by not taking any risks, or any gambles, that I
seem to be able to get better averages.

Does anyone else notice they do better when they aren&#x27;t taking risks?
I&#x27;ve always heard that better people take risks, and in competitions
they are meant to force you to be a little more careful. Well I think
maybe I&#x27;m weird or something, but I&#x27;ve noticed that by hardly ever
taking risks I tend to do better.

How can I take &quot;good&quot; risks? That seems to be the key to getting
faster averages.

Thanks for any help,
Chris

My take is that speedsolving is not the time to take risks.

Always going for simple and stupid things is not the ideal either.

I think the best is if you find an interesting situation like this 
while speed practicing, stop the timer, and try to think it through, 
learn what&#x27;s interesting about the situation and how to handle it. 
Perhaps try speed solving it several times.

Then, the NEXT time to encounter a similar position, it will not be a 
risky gamble, but a well known situation that you know how to handle 
at full speed.

That&#x27;s of course a lot of work, and I haven&#x27;t personally done it much 
the last 25 years. But back then I spent half my time trying to solve 
for fewest moves, which teaches you a LOT that you can never learn 
while speeding, and that over time translates into speed cubing.

I wish u good luck with your appearance on Zee TV.

But i think u have made enough announcements about it here already. 
Also u have sent out email about this to my email. I do not want to 
receive &quot;personal mails&quot; targeted for this group as i have 
specifically opted out of having message for this group delivered to 
my mail :-)

Best of luck!

If you want to look at just pair-building, go to 
http://www.lar5.com/cube There&#x27;s quite a few hints there, just when 
making the first block, don&#x27;t do it by pairs, but two mini-blocks 
that are 1x1x3. Those would be Edge-Center-Edge and Corner-Edge-
Corner.

          <div class="email-content">The commutator subgroup has been shown to contain half of the elements
of the whole cube group - that half for which the corner permutation
is an even permutation (ignoring orientation). (Since the edge
permutation and corner permutation must have the same parity, the same
could be said with regards to the edge permutation.) It is easy to
show that if the corner permutation of an element of the cube group is
odd, then it is not an element of the commutator subgroup, since all
commutators must consist of an even number of quarter turns, and any
position reached by an even number of quarter turns must be contain an
even permutation of the corners.

Since the commutator subgroup is half the size of G, G/[G,G] has two
elements, and so it must be isormorphic to the cyclic group of 2,
since any group of order 2 is isormphic to that group.

Many times, I thought about writing more about block building for this
method. But it&#x27;s difficult.
It&#x27;s like for F2L cases. Only the basic ones (the ones with the pieces
not in unwanted slot) are not enough if you want to master the
technique, you need intuition (i.e. a huge personal practical
experience) to find the shortcuts and anticipation possibilities that
make you fast.

I may upload a series of examples like this one:

Maybe it wants you to try to discover things! (Also [G,G] is called the derived subgroup.)

>

> What is the abelianization of the Cube Group? 

It&#x27;s pretty clear you can do a three cycle as a commutator.
e.g. (a b)(e f)(a c d)(a b)(e f)(a d c)=(a d b) (if you read your permutations left to right, or (a 
b c) if you read right to left). OK, I didn&#x27;t need the (e f) here, but read on and you&#x27;ll see why 
I stuck it in.
Similarly you can flip twist 2 pieces:
flip/twist a,b (a b c) flip/twist^{-1} a,b (a c b)

A_n is generated by 3-cycles and the orientation group by flipping/twisting 2 pieces. 
Hence any such product of moves is in [G,G].
But if H is the subgroup generated by such moves (3-cycles and orientations), then 
G=&lt;H,{U}>=H U H*{U} and H&lt;=[G,G].
Now U isn&#x27;t in H as it induces an odd permutation on corners (and on edges) whereas any 
element of H of necessity induces an even permutation.
So G:H=2 and since U isn&#x27;t in [G,G] either (because elements of [G,G]] also induce even 
permutations) then H&lt;=[G,G]&lt;G.
So also [G:G]=2 and H={G,G].
Whence G:[G,G]=2 (so, if you didn&#x27;t already know it, [G,G] is necessarily normal in G as any 
subgroup of index 2 is normal.

(Of course [G,G] is always normal, for any group G which i a simple consequence of 
xaba^{-1}b^{-1}x^{-1}=(xax^{-1})(xbx^{-1})(xax^{-1})^{-1}(xbx^{-1})^{-1}) but the above 
is a different proof for the present group. In fact, [G,G] is )

So G/[G:G] is isomorphic to C_2.

OK. So what can we take from this in the cube group.
Well, above we in fact also showed G&#x27;=[G,G] satisfies G&#x27;=[G&#x27;,G&#x27;] (that&#x27;s why I stuck the (e f) 
in because (a b)(e f) is in G&#x27;). So G&#x27; is its own derived subgroup.
So G is not a soluble group - of course, this is obvious since S_5 is (isomorphic to) a 
subgroup of G.

Ok, that makes sense. And all elements with even permutation can 
be written as a product of 3-cycles and 2-piece orientations, both 
of which are commutators (as shown in GoD2&#x27;s reply).

I&#x27;m a bit lost on the notation here. What is H*? In the second line
from bottom, what is meant by [G:G]=2? Is this essentially the same 
as the following argument? If we define f from [G,G] into G-[G,G] by
f(x)=xU, then f is bijective, so [G,G] and G-[G,G] are of the same
order. Hence G:[G,G]=2.

I&#x27;ve seen that proved by 
xaba^{-1}b^{-1}x^{-1}=[(xa)b(xa)^{-1}b^{-1}][bxb^{-1}x^{-1}],
but I didn&#x27;t know that it could be shown to equal a commutator 
rather than a product of commutators. Cool.

I don&#x27;t know what a soluble group is yet. I guess I&#x27;ll keep on reading.

Thanks so much for your help!

I was using * for the group operation. I could equally well have written H{U}, i.e. {hU:h in H} 
- it&#x27;s just a coset of H.
Given a group G and a subgroup H of G, G is a union of disjoint cosets of H. The cosets are 
all of the same cardinality. The index of H in G is the number of disjoint cosets. 
In this case, G is a union of the cosets H and H{U}. Then I go on to say that U isn&#x27;t in H so 
in fact these are the disjoint cosets. Thus G:H=2.

>In the second line

I meant to write G:[G,G]=2 and H=[G,G]. I guess I didn&#x27;t really need to write &quot;Whence G:
[G,G]=2&quot; since I&#x27;d already shown this.

Essentially I guess you showed this. If G=G:H and h is in H, g in G then either g is in H so 
ghg^{-1} is in H or else g is not in H. In that case G=H U H{g^{-1}}. If ghg^{-1} is not in H 
then for some h&#x27; in H, ghg^{-1}=h&#x27;g^{-1} so g=hh&#x27;^{-1} is in H after all (thus actually 
ghg^{-1} must be in H).

Moreover for any endomorphism of G, f, f(aba^{-1}b^{-1})=f(a)f(b)f(a)^{-1}f(b)^{-1} is a 
commutator. So [G,G] is a fully characteristic subgroup.

In the US its called a solvable group. Such a group is a group having a composition series 
whose factors are Abelian. A polynomial f over a field K is soluble by radicals iff the Galois 
group of f over K is soluble. I guess it&#x27;s not really interesting here though, as the fact that 
G has a subgroup isomorphic to S_5 already shows this.
Nonetheless, the fact that [G,G]=[[G,G],[G,G]] is interesting I guess.

So how did you eat the cake? Corners first or layer by layer? :P

          <div class="email-content">-Dear Gaetan,
 
First of all, I would like to thank u for your interesting.
We invented not only a 6x6x6 cube but we invented the NxNxN cube as 
u can see in our web page www.olympicube.com
We promise that soon enough all the puzzle fans will have the 
opportynity to play with our cubes.
Can u please explain me why do i have to communicate with your 
friend?
If u have any thoughts i would like to discuss them with u directly.
Hope to hear from u soon.
 
With respect
Konstantinos Verdes

Hi Konstantinos,
 
My poor english!!!
 
Are you  inventor of a cube 6x6x6?  Your system or mechanics seems 
new for me.  Does your cube is realized?   he is smooth and stable?  
Give me a photo color of you and your cube.  Amazing!!! I&#x27;m ok for 
your announce at the present but step 1 contact my friend inventor 
Gaston St-Pierre on my web site!:))

The first picture is a photo of our patent as it published in the

http://www.obi.gr/online/edbi.asp
and he has a good knowledge of Greek language.
The second one is the translation of our patent summary as it is

if you loosen the cube even without lube it turns pretty well. and it
doesn&#x27;t catch very much when you&#x27;re moving it.

Hello,

With Petrus you can definately get sub-30. Just practice F2L and learn
3-look LL, and later maybe 2-look. It&#x27;s hard to say which method is
easier, but I would say it&#x27;s better for you to continue using Petrus
because you already know it. I think Petrus should be faster (but a
lot harder) for F2L, but I don&#x27;t know.

          <div class="email-content">I find what works the best in the end is just good old fashion breaking in.
Just continue using the cube, preferably without lube, and it will
eventually become a very good cube.  Yes it can be a long and tedious
process, but I generally find that it is worth it.

i think one day i just got the urge to buy one because i had one when 
i was younger, i wanted to put my genius to the test because i had 
bought brain age the game for nintendo ds, and i think thats what did 
it, i solved it a couple times then i just got better and better, 
when it would usually take my about 15 minutes, by then i was 
absorbed by the cube and i looked online just to do general research, 
i say speed videos and instantly knew i wanted to be at that point, 
and i was then a speed cuber.

          <div class="email-content"> I got a cube as part of an anniversary present from my girlfriend, because I had always wanted to use hers. Then we broke up 2 weeks later (go figure), so I didn&#x27;t end up using the cube too much.
   
  My brother was incredibly bored at 2AM when he was home on fall break, so he looked it up online and became &quot;good&quot; at it (avg 3 minutes). I was impressed, so he decided to teach me on Christmas Day, when we were in the car driving to Ann Arbor to visit our relatives.
   
  I was fascinated by it and wanted to get faster... I looked it up online, ended up here, and now I average 45 seconds instead of 3 minutes... though I haven&#x27;t been cubing much lately.
   
  Btw I got a new and much better girlfriend now, who coincidentially already knew how to solve a cube.

          <div class="email-content">For me it was when I was reading a book on 4D theory that happened to<br>
mention a 4D Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  I though to myself &quot;I&#x27;ve never solved a<br>
Rubik&#x27;s cube, I should do that!&quot;  Went out and bought one, battled<br>
with it for about 7 hours straight and finally got it.  Then I though<br>
to myself &quot;There&#x27;s got to be people who can do this in like under an<br>
hour somewhere.&quot;  I looked it up on the internet and found Dan<br>
Knights&#x27;s and Chris Hardwick&#x27;s videos and immediately decided I HAD to<br>
learn to do that.<br>
<br>
As an interesting side note, about a year after I started speedcubing,<br>
I came across the 4D cube in the book and subsequently solved that,<br>
coming full circle.  Google &quot;Magic Cube 4D&quot; to find it, they also now<br>
have a fully functional 5D cube I think.<br>

          <div class="email-content">As a child, I had played with the Rubik&#x27;s Cube, but the best I could do was solve one face.  Once, while I was playing with it, a piece popped out, and I disassembled the whole thing, realizing how the mechanism worked.  For some time afterwards, the way I would solve the cube would be to disassemble it and then reassemble it.<br>
<br>
One day in April 2004, when I was an 8th grader, I decided that I really wanted to learn how to solve a Rubik&#x27;s Cube without disassembling it.  So that night, I went on Google, and I typed in &quot;Rubik&#x27;s cube solution&quot; into the search box.  The first link returned was of course Lars Petrus&#x27;s website.  I read about the 1982 world championships, and I could not believe people could solve a Rubik&#x27;s Cube so fast.  So I read the terminology and basic concepts of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube and then proceeded to spend half the night trying to follow along the explanations for each step and solve the cube.  Many hours later, when I finally looked up at the clock and it read 4:00 AM, I was still stuck on step 4.  Of course, that same day, I had school starting in about 4 hours, so I finally decided to call it a night and get some rest.<br>
<br>
When the weekend came, and upon revisiting Lars&#x27;s site, I was finally able to get past step 4 and eventually solve the entire cube.  I believe my first solve without looking at the solution guide was 15 minutes!  I was so proud :).  From then on, I have always been trying to improve my times, and the Petrus Method has become a part of me.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I remember when I was three years old (this was, if I recall <br>
correctly, May 1995) and I saw a Rubik&#x27;s Cube in my parents&#x27; room. At <br>
that time, I luckily got one face, not seeing that there <br>
were &quot;corners&quot; and &quot;edges&quot; instead of just the colored squares. <br>
Accidentally popped it, end of that story.<br>
<br>
Then, in September of last year, my friend started cubing, and I <br>
decided I&#x27;d give it a shot. He let me borrow his cube overnight and I <br>
wasn&#x27;t content with solving two layers (which I figured out in about <br>
two weeks). Last layer I just used a 4LLL that took me two months <br>
(yes, bad long algorithms) to memorize. About after a week after that <br>
my dad got me my own cube. Then I started going for a faster method, <br>
like Petrus. Now I&#x27;m at my own variant of it averaging 30sec.<br>

          <div class="email-content">A few months ago I was living in Michigan with my friend, who learned how to
solve a Rubik&#x27;s cube a while before and, at the time, I was very impressed
with his sub-5 minute solve time. I made him teach me, he was a horrible
teacher(as am I) and I just ended up asking him where he learned and he
pointed me to lar5.org/cube which was my main focus of attention for the
next 2 days. When I finally gave up on the site I could do it as fast as
him. At this point I had no clue about speedcubing or anything. I moved away
and didn&#x27;t have a Rubik&#x27;s Cube anymore. I was in walmart about a month ago
and saw one, I had to get it. My first solve out of the package was under 4
minutes which was my fastest time to date. After that I got more into the
whole speedcubing thing and checked out some stuff online, found this site.
I am currently trying to get a decent speedcubing cube, mine is horrible, it
sticks and doesn&#x27;t turn well. I still have a problem with the sides catching
when I turn it, but I blame that more on myself that the cube :-P My best
time to date is 1:51 with my crappy cube, but I am on my way!

          <div class="email-content">Long story short, I broke my foot and couldn&#x27;t play football for the rest of
the season, so I picked up a cube.  It ended up making a good college
entrance essay, which is below if you would like to read it.




                                                      (Life Lessons)^3


The following began on the night of October 19th 2003. I was at my
grandmother&#x27;s house for my cousin&#x27;s 17th birthday.  The atmosphere was
cheery, and the room was loud, as it often is when the whole family is
together.  Getting distracted from the event at hand, I decided to take part
in a little sibling rivalry.  My brother and I took turns on my
grandmother&#x27;s stationary bike, watching the RPM, seeing who could go faster.
The bike had moving handlebars which could be used in place of the pedals,
which of course led to a hands only competition. My brother pushed and
pulled his way to 73 RPM; then it was my turn.  I hopped on and started up.
As my arms pumped like pistons, the RPM meter rose.  The speed shot up to
20, 30, 40, 50 RPM and continued to rise up past 60, 70, 80 RPM.  At 93 RPM,
disaster struck.  Due to the torque of my upper body as I fought with the
handles, my bare right foot slipped, and fell into the path of the pedal.  The
pedal struck my heel and violently jammed my toes into the foot peg.

            A trip to the emergency room revealed a broken foot and broken
hopes of playing football any more that season.  To the untrained observer,
this event may seem to be an act of stupidity followed by the deserved
punishment.  But Winston Churchill said, &quot;The pessimist sees difficulty in
every opportunity. The optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.&quot;  And
perhaps Dale Carnegie put it better in his well known quotation &quot;When fate
hands you a lemon, make lemonade.&quot;  In actuality, this event started me on
my most intriguing journey to date.

            A day or two later, while surfing the web and chatting with
friends, I came across a video of someone not only solving the Rubik&#x27;s cube,
but doing so in under 20 seconds.  I have a profound interest in mathematics
and computer science, so the idea of the world&#x27;s greatest puzzle intrigued
me, and I followed up by getting a Rubik&#x27;s cube of my own.  Sadly, I
followed the path of most first time cubists, and got fed up with the cube
after a couple of days.  After a quick search on Google, I found a few
simple and a few not-so-simple solutions to the Rubik&#x27;s cube online.  I
added the sites to my favorites, and then went to sleep for the night.

            The next day was a school football game.  Because I was confined
to the bench for the rest of the season, I brought my cube along for the
twelve hour journey.  During this time I began to understand the basics of
the Rubik&#x27;s cube.  I became highly proficient at following the directions on
how to solve the cube.  After a day or two more, I was solving the cube
without the aid of an instruction sheet, taking about three minutes to do
so.  The addiction had begun.

            From that day until the present I have been on a never ending
quest for speed, learning more algorithms (sets of moves which produce a
desired effect on the Rubik&#x27;s cube) and different solutions, working my way
up.  I have attended several official Rubik&#x27;s cube competitions, including
the 2004 US national championships, in which I placed 15th out of the 47
cubists who attended.  Currently my personal best time is 17.63 seconds.

            Now as if one time and life consuming hobby isn&#x27;t enough fun,
try combining it with another.  This was the basic theory behind my 2004
science project.  I&#x27;m fanatical about the Rubik&#x27;s cube, passionate about
programming, and fervent about robotics.  So what type of diabolical scheme
can you come up with that combines all three?  That&#x27;s right, the world&#x27;s
fastest Rubik&#x27;s cube solving robot.  My inspiration came from another video
I had recently seen.  Originally, I was planning on building a robot with
the same basic design as in the video, but I wasn&#x27;t content with the speed,
or lack thereof, at which this design solved the Rubik&#x27;s cube, and I didn&#x27;t
want to be able to beat my own robot.  So I went about designing something
radically different and ended up with an 18 inch Plexiglas cube that looks
like something out of Star Trek.  The robot controlled my life for about two
months, over the course of which I wrote the code for it, built it, and
tuned it into a lean mean cube solving machine.  It can now beat the current
world record holder and averages only 11.46 seconds per solve.  The robot
took me to the California State Science Fair and led me to create my own
website (www.deepcube.net).  It is also unofficially the fastest cube
solving robot in the world, as there has not yet been an official event for
robots.

            In the end, I was able to turn a negative experience into a
positive one.  I set a goal for myself, pursued it, and enjoyed the journey
as well as the destination.  Although I have not become the fastest in the
world, my robot has, and I can solve the Rubik&#x27;s cube more quickly than I
ever thought possible.  Although Churchill and Carnegie provide timeless
words of wisdom, perhaps the most memorable are the immortal words of my
mother who has repeated time and time again, &quot;Always wear shoes while using
gym equipment.&quot;





And there you have it.



Until next time, Happy Cubing

-Evan

          <div class="email-content">THAT ESSAY IS AMAZING!!! LOVE IT!!!

Ok, well...for me...Its been 1 year, 25 days since I bought my first
Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  First time I saw one was on the school bus about 4-5
days prior.  These 2 girls were racing, and of course, as most people
are, they were slow.  And I was like, pssh, I can beat them.  Then I
asked one of them to teach me.  So the one girl that lived near me
agreed, and she taught me LBL.  She was acutally REALLY good at
teaching, and I guess I was a really good learner, because after about
15 minutes I could do Cross, corners, and I knew the alg to put in the
edge pieces.  This is when I realized I had a knack for this type of
stuff.  She only taught me a little bit more after this, so I went at
lunch one day and bought my own cube.  Everyone in my family still
believes that my best friend gave it to me for my birthday, but no one
needs to know that :)  Let the addiction...BEGIN!!!  So, once I
learned how to solve it, and because of my competitive attitude (I&#x27;m
really competitive) we had races on the bus.  I quickly surpassed
them, and I was on vacation at the end of July, and got my second
sub-60 time, and then on August 9 I was surfing the internet and came
across Dan Harris&#x27; Site.  From there I was linked to all sorts of
other peoples sites, and to here.  Let the explosion...BEGIN!!!  I
looked at Fridrich and was like, ok, well, NOT learning that.  So I
stuck with my method, analyzing everything there was to analyze, and I
became really efficient with that method, considering it was really
slow.  I knew all the tricks and everything to go as fast as I could,
but I was just like, I want to average faster, because if people can
do it in under 20, I know I can do that too, so that became my goal. 
Seeing as I am a HUGE procrastinator, I didn&#x27;t learn any Fridrich for
a while, until one day I decided to learn the algs for F2L.  I only
learned a few, that would work with my idea for a modified method. 
Basically, you solve cross, insert a corner in any way you want, then
solve the corner and edge in one go, then do LL.  At this point I
still hadn&#x27;t learned all of the 17 algs for 4LLL.  So I was still
slow, but once I learned those algs, my average dropped RAPIDLY
(Withing about a week, maybe less) from 60ish to 40-43.  I just kept
practicing with this method.  I got it into the mid-30s at one point,
but I knew it couldn&#x27;t get any faster, even with the cube I had, and
my hand speed.  The solution was taking 80+ moves on average.  By this
time I had been to WC, I had talked to everyone out there that there
was to talk to, and I sat myself down and learned the 17 algs for
4LLL.  And I switched to cross on bottom.  I&#x27;d say now, my cross is
the strongest point of my solve, partially thanks to Chris Hardwick
for being my F2L mentor, but also thanks to Dan Harris&#x27; site.  In
mid-December, I asked Chris Hardwick if he would teach me Intuitive
F2L (because enough people had yelled at me to not learn the algs) and
so he agreed, and I learned SOOO Much from him.  I learned F2L
intuitively, and efficiently, in about 2 weeks.  It took a little
longer to perfect it, but in a little over a month, I was back to
averaging what I used to, and not long afterwards, I was sub-30.  So
I&#x27;m sitting here wondering.  How can I get faster?  And then I decide,
PLL.  So, during my spare at school, I dub it my &quot;Cubing Period&quot; and
that is when I am going to learn all things cubing, well, to say the
least, didn&#x27;t happen, I just cubed for over an hour :S.  But I learned
all 21 PLLs, and a few OLLs for cases that came up a lot, and brought
my average slowly down.  I hit a wall at about 22 seconds, but that
first time you get sub-20 single solve is one of the best feelings
ever, and when you hit the average, well, I think that IS the best
feeling ever.  So currently, I use Pure Fridrich, Intuitive F2L + 26
OLLs + 21 PLLs, and I am about to learn these OLLs, and that is where
I stand today.  Of course, as anyone I had my influences too, but they
will remain anonymous :P

If you read this, wow...:) Thanks,

Craig

          <div class="email-content">Well, I guess my addiction started when I was in 7th grade. My grandfather
had a rubik&#x27;s cube which he used to solve in india (never for speed, just
for fun) and he started showing me a couple things. I didn&#x27;t know much, so I
just messed around with it for a long time. I ended up figuring out the
first two layers without too much help. Then later I saw one of my friends
doing it and asked him to show me how to solve it. By this time, being a
carefree and absent-minded 7th grader, I had forgotten most of what I had
learned, so I had to learn it all again. I learned a lot of it pretty fast,
but my friend kept holding me back and kept teaching me this convoluted
method which was, in hindsight, not really easy to understand. But after a
couple of days, I could solve it no sweat. Of course, back then I was using
a cheap dollar cube, and my best times were just under 2 minutes, which was
pretty good for us back then (since no one in my school had ever even heard
of speedcubing). I continued to solve it off and on until the end of the 8th
grade, when unfortunately I had to move all the way across town, leaving
everything.

In my new school, things were totally different. My old school was very
uncompetitive, and in fact in a pretty bad area in Houston. But my new
school was in a more affluent and competitive area. So it was a complete
change for me, going from a school where I never even had to try to get the
best grades to a school where I had to actually pay attention to do okay.
Anyways, during second semester in Geometry class, there was this one girl
(who wasn&#x27;t really that bright, no offense) who had a Rubik&#x27;s cube. She
showed the teacher who was really impressed and asked her to do it for the
class. It took her about 100 seconds or so, and everyone was really, really
impressed. Of course, I still knew how to do it, but wasn&#x27;t that fast at the
time. 10 minutes later I asked if I could give it a shot, since I used to
know how to do it. So I was working on it, trying to remember how to do it,
when after about 2 minutes she just grabbed it from me and said, &quot;Here, let
me finish it. You don&#x27;t really know how to do it anyways.&quot;

Now if you know me, you know that that will piss me off beyond a reasonable
doubt. I was insanely pissed off that she thought I was incapable of doing
it. Add to it the fact that I felt uncomfortable by the fact that I was in a
new environment, and you have me ready to really show her up. So I went home
and searched online for a fast cube solution. I finally found the Jeay&#x27;s
solutions, which ended up working pretty well for me. I relearned how to
solve the cube, and was doing okay for a while. Then a couple days later, my
dad showed me a video he found online.

It was Chris Hardwick&#x27;s 17.88 seconds solve. After seeing that, there was no
turning back. My dad got me a real Rubik&#x27;s cube (not the crappy Walgreens
ones) and my addiction started. In about a month, I was around 40 seconds,
having learned f2l and 4look.

I have been cubing ever since (I&#x27;m about to go to college, do the math).
Unfortunately, my progress has been abysmal. Since I really didn&#x27;t have much
time during school to cube (due to orchestra, schoolwork, and various other
committments), I have only progressed to about 22 seconds. I would probably
say that 10th grade onwards, I have only cubed for about 2 or 3 months
seriously. I would do it randomly, but I never really had enough free time
that I could just sit down and cube for hours on end (as I&#x27;d like to do).
But I have found time to teach other people and have taught about 30 people
to date (unfortunately, only a couple remember how to do it and even few
have gone for speed). And it also did make for a great college essay (if
you&#x27;re interested, email me personally and I&#x27;ll send it to you).

Anyways, thanks for reading, and happy cubing.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m floating on cloud 9 right now, and wanted to post about something<br>
that I&#x27;ve been doing that seems to work.<br>
<br>
Ever since I started, my predominant way to practice the cube is with<br>
the evolution algorithm.  I get a stable way of solving, then I change<br>
one small thing and try it for a while and see what happens.  If that<br>
small change works, I keep doing whatever it is I changed.  If it<br>
doesn&#x27;t work I stop doing it, and don&#x27;t ever do it again.<br>
<br>
Well anyway, this is the main way I practice, and has been ever since<br>
I started cubing.  What has me on cloud 9 is that I finally got sub-15<br>
on average, and I did it using this practice method!<br>
<br>
I know sub-15 has been done many times, by many people.  I also know<br>
that with sub-13 averages out now, sub-15 is not that great of a mile<br>
marker any more.  Still I don&#x27;t care, I never thought I would even<br>
make it this far!<br>
<br>
The small change I made to go from 15 to 14 was deep breathing.<br>
<br>
I figured that thinking this quickly would require your brain to be<br>
functioning at pretty high above normal.  So what I did was to breath<br>
very deeply, and throughout the whole average I was hovering on the<br>
line between being dizzy from too much air, and just regular deep<br>
breathing.  Well, it sounds weird, but it worked.  I found myself able<br>
to focus just that little bit extra, eliminate some pauses between OLL<br>
and PLL, and just generally not lock up as much.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know if anyone here does deep breathing (think almost dizzy<br>
the whole time), but it worked for me, and I plan on keeping it by my<br>
whole evolution algorithm thing.<br>
<br>
I thought sub-15 was impossible, unless you were superhuman or a<br>
cubing robot, but apparently even a regular joe like me can get there.<br>
<br>
If you thought sub-15 was impossible, please trust me, if I can make<br>
it you certainly can.  It took me 8 years to get here, but I finally<br>
did it!<br>
<br>
Here was the average, and no it was not a rolling average either:<br>
13.93, (12.04), 15.04, 16.35, (17.30), 14.10, 16.64, 15.27, 14.44,<br>
16.88, 13.33, 12.10 = 14.81<br>
<br>
Thanks for listening to my rambling, and I really mean what I said -<br>
if I can do this anyone can, all it takes is practice.  If you think<br>
it&#x27;s impossible you&#x27;ll never make it, which is what I think happened<br>
to me.  Tell yourself you can do it, and you will.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll get off my soapbox now, and as always happy cubing everyone!<br>
Chris<br>

Haha, or maybe its just the fact that you put speedsolving on the top
shelp for a while, and now that you brought it back down you look at
it differently :p Haha, Ian...

First off, DIY kits can be bought from Rubiks.com.  Here&#x27;s a link:
http://tinyurl.com/pv52z

Secondly, LL.  I&#x27;d recommend Jasmine&#x27;s beginner solution at
http://tinyurl.com/4owc9  That&#x27;s a good place to get started.

Hope this helps,
Tim Reynolds

I think there should be 576 total cases.  4!*4!
At least that&#x27;s what I got.

          <div class="email-content">It is all much simpler than that:

Solved case = 1/n
H-perm = 1/n
Z-perm = 2/n
3-cycle CW = 4/n
3-cycle CCW = 4/n

Opposite swap = 2/n
Diagonal swap = 4/n
4-cycle CW = 1/n
4-cycle CCW = 1/n
4-cycle Crazy = 2/n

Total = 22/n = 1 so n = 22.

You can have any case in the top or bottom layer, so to know a
particular case, it is just prob(top) * prob(bottom).

ie - H-perm top with Opposite swap bottom = 1/22 * 2/22 = 2/484.

Ben: the 576 does not take into account the symmetries, I believe.

I just got done being taken to school by Michael Fung about this on

Spend some time studying the first-two-layer algorithms.  They&#x27;re
simple enough to understand how they work without just &quot;memorizing&quot;
them.  Speed doesn&#x27;t just come from memorizing algorithms, it comes
from understanding what you&#x27;re doing, being able to plan ahead, and
developing dexterity in your fingers.

You can do all of that without memorizing anything, if you want.  You
should easily be able to solve the cube in under a minute even with
your basic solution.

But by then you&#x27;ll be addicted, and you&#x27;ll decide it&#x27;s worth it to
memorize 70 algorithms. :-)

Hi, a good understanding of the cube can save you from memorisation.<br>
The solving strategy is an important factor, however. A method such as<br>
Fridrich puts the cube in highly symetric positions in the last stages,<br>
which lends itself well to memorisation but not understanding. If you<br>
would like to apply understanding, then you will want to avoid those<br>
symetric positions.<br>

and arguing about the total number of perms:

I agree that there is only one of the crazy 4 cycles, but since it&#x27;s 
only rotational symmetry is at 360 degrees, then it should be four 
times more likely to occur than a pattern that has symmetry at 
90,180,270, and 360.

And if that&#x27;s true, the total probabilites add up to 24 possible 
cases, which is 4!.

  It actually isn&#x27;t all that bad.  I solved my very first cube in late
February of this year.  The first solve probably took me around 5
hours total (on and off for about a day and a half).  After that, I
wrote up my own little algorithms that I pulled off certain pages. 
There were 13 in total.  I just started practicing them whenever I had
a chance.  It took me 1-2 weeks to memorize all 13, and I wasn&#x27;t
really trying to memorize, they just came to fit my hands.  My goal
was to get below 1 minute.  I reached my goal fairly quickly.  Now, I
can average under 30 seconds.  I typed up a guide that I felt was
really easy to understand and would help newer people learn to solve.
 Check it out here:
http://www40.brinkster.com/patjk/beginners.html

Towards the bottom I provided an example solve using that method. 
Once you have that method mastered, its time to move onto Fridrich. 
Check out my speedcubing page at:
http://www40.brinkster.com/patjk/fast.html

I also provided an example solve using pure Fridrich towards the
bottom there.  Learning all the algorithms sounds tough, but it isn&#x27;t.
 When you get time, just sit down, and learn maybe 1-2 algorithms each
day.  The F2L is mostly intiution, so you actually see more about what
is happening, and not really learning an algorithm.  I have most F2L
cases down, all PLL cases, and I need maybe 30 more OLL algorithms to
memorize.  Once I get all the OLLs, I am going to go back and learn
new tricks for the F2L, and that should take my time don 7-10 seconds.
 Just practice, practice, practice.  Don&#x27;t give up.  Find a friend to
get interested in the cube with so you can compete against eachother.
 Good luck,
Patrick

          <div class="email-content">Hi Anand,

It is possible to average under 20 seconds with 4 look last layer.
For that you need to learn:
EO) Edge orientation (3 cases)
CO) Corner orientation (7 cases)
CP) Corner permutation (2 cases)
EP) Edge permutation (4 cases)
Total of 16 cases.

This will be the first step towards learning all 78 cases.
After that you can combine CP and EP (15 more cases).
And slowly combine EO and CO. Like first learn all cases with 4 flipped 
edges.

F2L is mainly intuitive, although for some tougher cases most of the guys 
here use algorithms.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

About 4-look last layer (LL). I use that for my 3x3x3 speedsolving. 
In terms of number of moves it&#x27;s not very efficient at all (the way 
i do it at least). There are at least a few reasonable scenarios for 
a 4-step LL.

- position corners (PC), orient corners (OC), orient edges (OE) and 
finally position edges (PE)

This is what i do basically, but there are some bad cases for 
orienting edges after solving the corners so i sometimes divert and 
do 2 edge 3-cycle instead of OE + PE. Or i may do the edge 4-flip in 
just 1 alg.

A better scenario is probably:

- OE then OC then finally PE and PC in any order.

Going that route leads naturally to the standard 2-look LL: orient 
all (OLL) and permute all (PLL). The first 2 steps combine to OLL 
and the last 2 combine to the PLL step.

My best average with my rather poor 4-look LL strategy is 20.57 
secs. My normal avg&#x27;s are in the range 24-26 secs. Im lazy to change 
my 25 yr old ways of spedsolving, and im more interested in the 
larger cubes for speeding :-)

Best of luck!

Yes, there are several scenarios for 4 look last layer.
But EO, CO, CP, EP is bringing you closer to CFOP.

Instead of timing with a stopwatch, you could use a countdown timer.<br>
Set it to X seconds, you win if your attempt is faster than X seconds.<br>
<br>
You&#x27;d have a competition just like high jump or pole vault. A limited<br>
number of attempts/competitor, challenges of increasing difficulty.<br>
Take risks, but not too much.<br>
<br>
That could be a fun and interesting unofficial event, with competitors<br>
racing for the same challenge solving at the same time under a common<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

That&#x27;s what i said also. But i Used OE, OC, PC, PE ;-)

(! EO/CO/EP/CP)

Learning 4-look LL in this way is a good way to go. Then learn how 
to combine PC and PE into 1 step >> PLL (13 algs). This leads to a 3-
look LL. Then when mastering this learn the OLL algs in small steps 
until all cases are mastered. Learning just the algs is not 
sufficient though. I mean just learning those algs and not how to 
use them (recognition of the cases) is rather meaningless :-) When 
all OLL is fully mastered u have a true 2-look LL.

Other 2-step LL scenarios possible are CLL(COLL) then ELL(PE).

Or like Mirek: make a 2x2x1 block on last layer and then learn all 
the algs for the last 5 cubies. I don&#x27;t see a good step-up path to 
this approach however ;-)

Cheers!

That&#x27;s what I do, basically. See:
http://www.speedcubing.com/DavidJSalvia.html

>From there I went a different direction: Position and orient corners
in one go, solve edges in one go. CLL ELL.

I started to control the LL edge orientation when placing the 4 FL
edges, so I never end up with all four flipped unless I want them
flipped. I did that when I started to develop: position and orient
corners and flip 2 edges over in one go, and position edges.

people go at once and first x Done move on...The way you explained it
is faster of 2 moves on.  The way he explains it, You have to do it
under a specific time.  If you do it, you can move on.  There wouldn&#x27;t
 be rounds.  I guess technically there would be rounds but not in the
way you mean.

<br>
Do you like head-to-head with one battle/round, or average/round?<br>
The reason why I think it&#x27;s a bad idea is that in cubing, you compete<br>
against yourself, more than against others, so it&#x27;s not really a<br>
battle. It&#x27;s very different than races, where there&#x27;s much more<br>
strategy involved.<br>
The &quot;pole vault&quot; competition format gives more strategy, and it would<br>
be the only way for me to beat Anssi, if he decides to start his<br>
competition at sub-12 and fails :-)<br>
<br>
&gt; A match could just be one head-to-head battle, or a series.<br>
<br>
A head-to-head tournament style with each round based on the &quot;pole<br>
vault&quot; format is a possibility.<br>

&gt; The reason why I think it&#x27;s a bad idea is that in cubing, you compete<br>

<br>
Maybe we liked different things about your idea? One of the things I<br>
really liked was this bit:<br>
<br>
&gt; competitors racing for the same challenge solving at the same time<br>
&gt; under a common timer.<br>
<br>
Now, it is true, there is a fundamental problem with speedcubing as a<br>
&quot;sport&quot;, which is the element of chance. And it really affects competing<br>
of both kinds, whether it be competing against yourself, or against<br>
others. In both cases, chance can make it difficult to tell whether you<br>
were actually better or worse. It also means speedcubing isn&#x27;t<br>
inherently better suited to one form or the other, and really depends on<br>
what whether the individual thinks is &quot;fun&quot;.<br>
<br>
(When I was a student, I found Doom boring, but multiplayer Doom fun :-)<br>
<br>
&gt; Do you like head-to-head with one battle/round, or average/round?<br>
<br>
I think both can be fun. The average/round or best-of-set/round can<br>
account for chance to some extent, but would also slow things down.<br>
<br>
Another thought is that maybe in the far distant future, speedcubists<br>
will be so advanced that they will eliminate the element of chance all<br>
by themselves :-) Supposing everyone is given the same scramble,<br>
everyone is an expert in the cube and doesn&#x27;t rely on luck, and everyone<br>
has the same opportunities to take advantage of.<br>

San Francisco is a surprisingly small city with pretty good public  <br>
transport.<br>
<br>
If you&#x27;ll spend 2 weeks doing California, you&#x27;ll want to rent a car,  <br>
but in The City it&#x27;s mostly a pain having a car.<br>

My personal preference is that it should be held in the east coast; 
the last two were held in the west. I feel that way probably because 
I&#x27;m from the east coast. :P

I have a question for all you programmers out there.  I have a need<br>
for a really simple program that will help me practice one of the<br>
things that makes up a fairly large portion of my DNFs on the bigger<br>
cubes.<br>
<br>
I need a tool that will generate 4 random letters, with no repeat<br>
letters, and never using the letters Y or Z.<br>
<br>
So for example, I could press a key or do some input command and then<br>
it would display something like:<br>
RNWX<br>
ABCD<br>
QLIJ<br>
NMJE<br>
<br>
etc..<br>
<br>
But it would never display something like<br>
AECE<br>
YDER<br>
ZBDU<br>
<br>
etc..<br>
<br>
I have no knowledge of how to do this, and wanted to humbly ask if<br>
anyone would be able to write something real simple that would do<br>
this.  It doesn&#x27;t need to look fancy, or pretty, or do anything other<br>

Hi,
This is a very simple script that hopefully will be useful:
http://koti.mbnet.fi/~stini/bld.php

I didn&#x27;t do much testing, so say if there is anything to be fixed.

Hi Chris, just copy and paste this into an html file and open it in
your web browser:


&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>

// Generate a bag of letters from &#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;X&#x27;
var bag = new Array();
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 24; i++)
{
        bag[i] = String.fromCharCode(65 + i);
}

// Now randomly pull characters out of the bag
for (var i = 24; i > 0; i--)
{
        var randomPosition = Math.floor(Math.random()*i);
        var letter = bag[randomPosition];
        bag.splice(randomPosition, 1);

        document.write(letter);
        document.write(&#x27; &#x27;);
        if (i % 4 == 1) document.write(&#x27;<br>&#x27;);
}

Hi Chris, just copy and paste this into an html file and open it in
your web browser:

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>

// Generate a bag of letters from &#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;X&#x27;
var bag = new Array();
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 24; i++)
{
bag[i] = String.fromCharCode(65 + i);
}

// Now randomly pull characters out of the bag
for (var i = 24; i > 0; i--)
{
var randomPosition = Math.floor(Math.random()*i);
var letter = bag[randomPosition];
bag.splice(randomPosition, 1);

document.write(letter);
document.write(&#x27; &#x27;);
if (i % 4 == 1) document.write(&#x27;<br>&#x27;);
}

&lt;/script>

<br>
You can never believe what just happened... Matt Walter is visiting <br>
Holland right now, and this morning, I picked him up from the airport, <br>
and went to do some cool stuff in Amsterdam... We were taking a little <br>
tour around the city with a boat, and during that, we also solved a <br>
few cubes.. Suddenly, a guy comes up to me and asks me: &#x27;How fast do <br>
you solve the 3x3?&#x27;. I said &#x27;about 15 seconds&#x27;. Then, I suddenly <br>
realised how strange his question was. I mean, most ppl would call <br>
it &#x27;that thing&#x27;, or maybe &#x27;that cube&#x27;. But this sounded like a guy who <br>
knew more about cubing... And it turned out his best friend is a <br>
speedcuber (David Bergman, some of you might know him).<br>

Hi Per, for in-page regeneration, add this:


&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>

function generateLetters()

    }

    // Now randomly pull characters out of the bag
    var html = &#x27;&#x27;;
    for (var i = 24; i > 0; i--)
    {
        var randomPosition = Math.floor(Math.random()*i);
        var letter = bag[randomPosition];
        bag.splice(randomPosition, 1);

        html += letter;
        html += &#x27; &#x27;;
        if (i % 4 == 1) html += &#x27;<br>&#x27;;
    }
    document.getElementById(&#x27;output&#x27;).innerHTML = html;
}

&lt;/script>

&lt;div id=&quot;output&quot;>&lt;/div>
&lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;generate&quot; onClick=&quot;generateLetters();&quot;>

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>
generateLetters();

That keeps it purely client-side. If i had changed the filename 
from .php to .htm(l) my code runs purely clientside too, but would 
indeed refresh the whole window not just the content inside it. I 
did like i did to keep the code short ;-)

I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a fake. Or at least that crazy average, the others look

competition it never actually happened, then you&#x27;re blatently
presuming that people are lying when they post their records. How
about saying that official records are more respectable?

I see people saying unofficial records don&#x27;t mean anything and the
don&#x27;t matter any more, but surly you don&#x27;t think everyone is making up
their own personal records? Maybe one or two, but not too many to
compare yourself to other people with. I&#x27;ve enjoyed being able to
compare my times with other people online and dislike the fact that my
times &#x27;don&#x27;t matter&#x27; because I&#x27;ve not been to an official competion.


Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool to have an unofficial &#x27;video&#x27; world records? Then
people wouldn&#x27;t be lying (on the whole) and we&#x27;d see some fantastic
things. I&#x27;m not looking for a replacement, just something to look into
aswell. The idea I had was to have a community with users who post
their videos and they get meta-moderated, kinda like slashdot, with
ratings. If a video requires removal the community will meta-mod it
down and the moderators will remove it. It&#x27;d be nice to have comments
on the video&#x27;s that people could write. Then you get a records list
with proof to back it up that&#x27;s approved by the majority of people.
The good thing with ratings, is people who get rated high, get their
own personal rating  changed higher so they get credability. (For
example, when posting a crazy record) Oh, and have videos in flash
format, like youtube. That&#x27;s always fun, gotta think web 2.0.

What do you think?

If you look at the link i sent, there is actually made a malbolge

considering the spec of that language. Just creating a compiler should

          <div class="email-content">Hey, yeah, I think I spelt it wrong.

The malbolge version of 99 bottle is actually just a hello world
application generated by a computer. It contains no loop function or
decriment statement, and just prints the text as a single block. In
this sense it it just another printf &quot;Hello World&quot; application. That
said, I&#x27;ve not looked at the site recently, so the version might have
changed. I&#x27;ll look later.

It&#x27;s still pretty amazing though. To work on malbolge, you think of it
as an encryption challenge, rather than a programming exercise.

People can lie with videos.  You can practice the same scramble over

Not everyone has the means to make a video.

People don&#x27;t film every single solve they do, so chances are, your PB

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I dredged up this older topic because I finally gave the sudokube a <br>
shot.<br>
<br>
My dad saw one in a Walmart and got it for me to try, and it took me <br>
about an hour of fiddling with it to finally get it.<br>
<br>
The sudokube was actually a good bit harder than I expected it to <br>
be, and there were definitely moments of purely sudoku logic while <br>
solving it.  I found the solution where all the numbers are all <br>
correctly oriented with respect to all the other numbers on each <br>
face.<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t yet tried to find solutions allowing the numbers to be <br>
misaligned on each face, but I&#x27;ll see if I can find any.<br>
<br>
Anyway, not sure if anyone else has tried this, but it sure stumped <br>
me for an hour until I finally saw a way to get it.<br>
<br>
Also, who is the puzzle marketed to?  First off to solve it you need <br>
to be able to solve the super cube 3x3x3, and second off, because of <br>
the moments of sudoku logic, you need to be comfortable with doing 3 <br>
cycles that preserve *everything* but the three pieces you move.  Is <br>
this puzzle targeted towards cubers?  Same as the 4x4 is targeted <br>
towards cubing fans?  I can&#x27;t see a non-cuber figuring this thing <br>
out to be honest, I found it fairly difficult even already being <br>
comfortable with commutators and supercubes!<br>

I know not everyone can video, even I can&#x27;t. But it&#x27;d be a good thing
to have. And people don&#x27;t video every solve aswell, that&#x27;s fine. But
having a video records page is still a plus. So, you think I should
start making it? :)

<br>
The first time I solved this one I first checked which sides where bottom/top before scrambling it. That makes a big difference.<br>
I then solved it in 10 minutes, using blindfolded tricks after solving first layer.<br>
After some practice 5 minutes should be easy.<br>

You can use my script freely. I can give you the source code so that
you can put it on your server if you want (and possibly modify it).

  Hi guys,<br>
<br>
  The first time I solved this one I first checked which sides where bottom/top before scrambling it. That makes a big difference.<br>
  I then solved it in 10 minutes, using blindfolded tricks after solving first layer.<br>
  After some practice 5 minutes should be easy.<br>

  Have fun,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)<br>
<br>
I was having a nice chat w Chris Hardwick the other day. I asked him <br>
to prove that only 4 layers is not enough to generate the cube-group <br>
for the 3x3x3 group. The proof is quite easy. There&#x27;s only 2 cases <br>
possible: leaving out 2 opposite layers or leaving out 2 adjacent <br>
layers. The first option makes it impossible to flip edges. While <br>
the second option leaves one edge out of reach :-o<br>
<br>
So, now the interesting question. How many layers are needed to <br>
generate the full cube-group on an nxnxn cube? And what layers <br>
should they be? I have a few ideas already but i&#x27;d like some input / <br>
discussion about this :-)<br>
<br>
Im not asking how to solve _optimally_ with a minimal number of <br>
generators, though that&#x27;s another interesting topic in itself :D<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,

Yeah I enjoyed the puzzle a lot.  When my dad gave it to me it was
already scrambled, and I had never really payed attention to what the
solves state looked like before when I saw them in a store so I didn&#x27;t
even get the part about lining the numbers up in the same orienation
until I had been fiddling with it a while.  Before that I had all the
faces with a single 1,2,3,4 but I had many of them misaligned.  I then
noticed the orienation of the numbers of the corners, and it clearly
gave two faces as &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; so I solved all the corners, then
was able to line up the U and D layers into the only correct rotation
they could have of the possible 4.

I then figured out (sudoku logic here) that two of the centers had to
be on either R or L, and that left the other 4 in the M slice with
only 4 possible rotations because of the sudoku rules (because I could
switch the R and L centers legally, effectively changing the parity of
the M slice centers).

I was then able to place the E layer edges, which gave me enough
information (all sudoku logic here) to place all 6 centers.  At this
point I had been orienting the ones I knew to be solved so I could
remember not to mess those ones up.

After that I had to place the S layer and M layer edges.  I was able
to place all the S layer edges really easily after I had the middle
layer edges (sudoku here too), and then that made it easy to finish
off the M layer and solve it (also sudoku here).

I&#x27;d say knowing the cube, and knowing what orientation a piece would
be in if I moved it to another spot sometimes made it easy to &quot;cheat&quot;
a little and just orient the numbers correctly rather than think
through the sudoku logic of how to get that piece where it needed to
go.  Sometimes though there were multiple options of a piece to use
for a location and you had to use sudoku to figure out which one went
there.

Overall a very awesome puzzle!  I only wish I could do it again, but
after staring at it for an hour I already have the centers, corners,
and most of the edges memorized lol.  I guess I could try to speed
solve it, but the cube is fairly low quality.  I figure I&#x27;ll try my
first approach again and see if there is a solution allowing the
numbers to be misaligned with respect to the other numbers on that face.

Overall this puzzle rocked, I enjoyed it very much, and it was
definitely much harder than I expected it to be!

Ron, I still think you&#x27;re a puzzling genius, or a cube robot and can
just figure out any cube puzzle too quickly ;-)  Much respect to you,
I certainly took way longer than 10 minutes to solve mine, but it was
still fun to try!

Duncan, Ron, what approach did you guys take to figuring your cube out?

          <div class="email-content">First of all, one must understand what you mean when you say the &quot;full
cube-group on an nxnxn cube.&quot; Generally, the positions of an nxnxn
cube do not form a group, unless you mean the nxnxn super-cube. The
ordinary nxnxn cubes (n larger than 3) because of indistinguishable
cubies. I believe the set of positions of one of these cubes is a
coset of the corresponding super-cube group. With GAP, it seems to be
easier to look at the super-cube group.

Even-size cubes have the issue that there are no fixed centers to use
as reference points for your generators. Odd size cubes can use the
fixed centers as references for the various generators, but only if
you wish to exclude central layer moves as generators. If we have a
case where we do not have fixed centers, then it appears to me we have
at least three cases to consider. I&#x27;ll use the 4x4x4 as an example.

1. We could consider that whole cube rotations (the set { (U u d&#x27; D&#x27;),
(L l r&#x27; R&#x27;) } is sufficient if regarded as generators) to be implicit
generators, with the argument that such actions do not change the
state of the cube, only its orientation. With the 4x4x4, the entire
super-cube group can be generated by U, u, and whole cube rotations.

2. We could consider that the cube has some absolute reference at the
start, no whole cube rotations are allowed at any time, and that the
orientation of the end result does not matter. (Equivalently, we allow
one arbitrary whole cube rotation at the end instead of saying the
orientation does not matter.) Clearly, the generators U, u, d, L, l,
r, F, f, and b allow all the legal positions of the 4x4x4 super-cube
to be reached, if we consider that the orientation of cube at the end
does not matter. But we know that these generators do not allow the
DRB corner cubie to be moved from its initial position and orientation
with respect to the absolute reference established. So these
generators do not generate the whole 4x4x4 super-cube group where
orientation of the cube is considered to matter (see case 3 below).

3. We could consider that the cube has some absolute reference at the
start, no whole cube rotations are allowed at any time, and the
orientation of the cube for the end result matters. This is a group 24
times larger than the group for case 2. While &lt;U, u, d, L, l, r, F, f,
b> does not generate this group, I have found that this group can
still be generated with only six generators (for the 4x4x4
super-cube): &lt;U, u, D, d, L, f>. I used GAP to show this is the case.
With generators being restricted to single-layer moves, I don&#x27;t think
any combination of five generators is sufficient to generate this
group for the 4x4x4 super-cube.

<br>
There is a draft version available of the WCA regulations 2006 v2. <br>
<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/events/regulations_draft_2006v2.html <br>
<br>
Your feedback is very welcome in the WCA forum: <br>
http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum <br>
<br>
The deadline for this new version is July 22, 2006, so that the <br>
regulations can be used starting with the competitions end of July. <br>
<br>
The focus areas for this new version are based on the feedback we had <br>
from our community: <br>
1) no extra attempts anymore for puzzle defects <br>
2) improvements for ending the solve (penalties instead of DNF, <br>
stopping with hands not specifically with fingers) <br>
3) regulations on the number of rounds and people progressing to next <br>
round <br>
4) No Inspection events not official anymore (focus on one main <br>
event) <br>
5) simpler text where possible <br>
<br>
The full list of changes can be found here: <br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/events/regulations_history_draft_2006v2.htm<br>
l <br>
<br>
It is never possible to make everyone happy. Still we aim that the <br>
WCA regulations are fair and accepted, based on a majority view of <br>
our community. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

I&#x27;ve seen the picture at the start of this thread with the white
sudokube, mine was not the same.  Mine is a black cube of extremely
cheap quality and the tiniest bit smaller than the regular 3x3 (maybe
2.0-2.5mm)

The centers on my cube are 1,1,4,5,6,7 so only one is a 5, unlike the
white cube where all are 5&#x27;s.

The number stickers are on pieces like below:
1: 2 centers, 1 edge, 3 corners
2: 4 edges, 2 corners
3: 4 edges, 2 corners
4: 1 center, 2 edges, 3 corners
5: 1 center, 2 edges, 3 corners
6: 1 center, 2 edges, 3 corners
7: 1 center, 2 edges, 3 corners
8: 4 edges, 2 corners
9: 3 edges, 3 corners

I agree that white sudokube I think would be fairly easy to solve
because the solved state is in the pattern where read from left to
right and top to bottom the numbers are in order.  When the cube I
have is solved the numbers are all scrambled on every face, though
they are all aligned correctly with respect to each other.  For
example read from left to right and top to bottom one of my E layer or
side faces is

971
248
536

I think there would be a huge number of ways to arrange stickers on a
sudokube so that you would have a solvable puzzle.  As an upper bound
obviously there can&#x27;t be more than (9!)^6 * 4.  The factor of 4 comes
from the ability to rotate all the stickers on U and D 90 degrees, 180
degrees, or 270 degrees but leave them in the same order with respect
to each other on each face.  Due to symmetry the actual number would
be less though.  Also for a different, and harder, problem you could
allow faces to be misaligned, unlike this cube which has 4 adjacent
faces on the E ring all oriented the same way, leaving the U and D
layers oriented a different way, but the same as each other.  You
could have the orientations all different too, giving an upper bound
of (4 * 9!)^6, and again both of these actual counts should be less
because of certain symmetrical positions.

perfectly lined up.  For Roux,  U adjustments dont matter.<br>
<br>
2. Is there any way I can input the corners with a U2 adjustment?<br>
   Would that be any different than inputting it without the U2?<br>
<br>
3. Can I input it so that the Top corners end up just fixed, but not<br>
aligned?  Can acube ignore adjustments<br>
<br>
4.  How do I input corners in general?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for any help<br>

Maybe not the help you need, but here are ACube3 settings for all my
corner cases.

Or if you prefer written out: U2 R2 F2 R2 F2 R2 F2 U2 R2 F2 R2 F2 R2 
F2 U2 R2 F2 R2 F2 R2 F2 U2

I would certainly hope that is not an optimal way to do this, but it 
is the first I was able to find after fiddling with it.  I&#x27;ll try to 
find a shorter way.

I think it&#x27;s a good site to have, it even shows where country you from 
and for the record lists, well the one that should benifit most is the 
user for tracking his/her records. I logged there and share it with 
cuber&#x27;s in my country and hopefully they will be posting soon.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

The half turn group can be completely solved turning only 5 of the 
layers !! D2 can be simulated like so : F2 R2 L2 B2 U2 F2 R2 L2 B2.

It&#x27;s not too hard to see how this works. First 4 moves moves the D 
layer onto the U layer ...

Now, who likes to speed this &quot;reduced&quot; half turn group?

Cheers!

Yes it&#x27;s possible to simulate D with the following :

R L F2 B2 R&#x27; L&#x27;.U.R L F2 B2 R&#x27; L&#x27; or
R L&#x27; F2 B2 R L&#x27;.U.R&#x27; L F2 B2 R&#x27; L (7-stm)

Im not sure what u mean by without _u_ however ?? Im talking about 
the cube group where the centers are fixed :-)

Allowing physically turning the 3x3x3 cube, only 3 &quot;moves&quot; are 
needed : x,y and F .. hehehe :D

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">There are several establish CLL alg sets out there if you want to 
spare yourself the trouble.

Basically, you can start off with a &quot;~U&quot; switch to have it treat all 
the algs that start and/or end with some sort of U turn as equal 
length.

In reference to Gilles post, starting off with &quot;@? @? @? @?&quot; tells 
it that you care/know nothing at all about the 4 U-edges.

He wrote:
> # A2
> @? @? @? @? @? ! @? ! ! ! ! ! ! UBL URB ! ! ! ! !
It is best to use the &quot;!!&quot; notation to be able to more clearly see 
the break between edge specification and corner specification. Thus 
I&#x27;d have done:
@? @? @? @? @? ! @? !! ! UBL URB !!
or in your case:
~U @? @? @? @? @? ! @? !! ! UBL URB !!

Upon closer examination of the character sequence, &quot;! UBL URB !!&quot; 
defines the corner configuration. The first &#x27;!&#x27; indicates that UFR 
is correctly placed. The &#x27;!!&#x27; indicates that the last 5 corners are 
also correct (or more precisely stated &quot;to be left fixed&quot;), where by 
last 5, I mean in regards to the given ordering in the program.

The &quot;UBL&quot; means that: in the URB-slot, there currently lies the UBL-
corner, and that it is positioned there in such a manner that the U-
color sticker is on the U-face, B-colored sticker on the R-face, and 
L-color sticker on the B-face.

Furthermore, do note that Gilles also used the &quot;#&quot; commenting that 
ACube understands, and that it is possible to do things like &quot;face 
masking&quot;. For example, if you use the &quot;431&quot; switch then it will look 
only in the restricted &lt;L,U,R> subgroup (a preference of some of the 
fastest cubers).

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

I thought the documentary was very good, and I green lighted it, so I
hope it shows up on TV.

My only comment is that the number of unsolved combinations for the
3x3x3 given is incorrect.

The number listed is 43,252,274,489,855,999 when it is in fact
43,252,003,274,489,855,999

The number given is off by almost a factor of 1,000.  And yes I am a
total nerd for having that number memorized, I admit it.

Overall I thought the video was very good, and I hope it is able to
appear on TV.  Everyone keep green lighting it!

Chris

confused when i read this at first lol...
it was so annoying... half the underclassmen at my high school who saw
me doing a rubik&#x27;s cube for the first time mentioned this show, and
this episode... and i was like uh okay sure (i never saw it). and i
was REALLY confused by this email, and then i took the effort to look
it up and it was you who was on the show! lol! that&#x27;s pretty cool,
actually. congratulations (several months late or whatever, guess i
missed out on that one) that was an amusing discovery for me...

Thom Barlow won the 3x3x3 event by 0.07 seconds over an average of 12,<br>
with 18.52 seconds. Dan Harris came second, and Paul Nixon third.<br>
<br>
There were lots of good times set on the various puzzles, and I for<br>

time, and also to see the others, Jasmine, Paul, Sean, and to meet<br>
Paul&#x27;s wife who was exceptionally nice.<br>

I will post a short report and some pictures and results when I get<br>
time, probaly in the next week or two :)<br>

HELLo 

THIs is very similar to the way I start.  

 I do 4x3x1 Block, 5 centers, pair up 6 edges, pair up remaining 3 edges, (B2, CMLL, Last 6 
edges).   I thought that I would be able to get to 90 sec fairly easily, but I can only average 
about 105 sec right now.  I still think that it has great potential to be a fast system.  But 
I&#x27;m not that fast of a cuber.

MY Questions to you;  HOw do you do Stefans method with the block there?
                                 How long does B1 take you?
                                 How fast can you do the 5 centers?
                                 How fast have you gotten with ROUX by the way?

          <div class="email-content">Hello

Thank you for the help.  I have trouble understanding things of this nature.  

So !! means five !&#x27;s really.  
CORNERs are input by their stickers, starting with the U sticker, and rotating 
Counterclockwise for the last 2.  UFL ULB UBR URF  is that right?

so that much I understand,

But How do I start the program off with the ~U ?

And how do you set it up to get as many sequences as possible?

Thanks again

Jason

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, Gilles told me about that method, but I think after a while on
mine I go off at a tangent :)

Really, I only do four centres now without using pochmann&#x27;s method
(read the optimizations part).

B1, you mean Sune?

Here is my latest average with roux; 

Average: 15.73 seconds
Individual Times: 15.50, (13.89), 15.12, 15.86, 17.45, 16.31, 14.77,
15.28, 17.08, 15.05, (19.45), 14.92

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d help that much because you have to solve them
anyway, I much prefer the idea of solving the pieces directly to
where they&#x27;re suppost to go.

The last step here is a bit complicated, is my explanation alright, it
wasn&#x27;t too clear I donm&#x27;t think. Usually I solve it in 1-3 algs.

&gt; So !! means five !&#x27;s really.  <br>
<br>
it means the rest of the pieces of that type are correct (or to be <br>
left untouched), however many it is, so in this case that case it <br>
was 5. But for example, a completely solved cube can be entered in <br>
as &quot;!! !!&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt; But How do I start the program off with the ~U ?<br>
<br>
before typing the rest of the sequence, just start by typing &quot;~U &quot; <br>
in its command line.<br>
<br>
&gt; And how do you set it up to get as many sequences as possible?<br>
<br>
I run it with the folloing command from DOS (actually I made an icon <br>
for it):<br>
&quot;java -cp ACube3.jar ACube f a o&quot;<br>
this optimizes in face turn metrics and gives only optimal sequences <br>
in that turn count, as well as all of them<br>
<br>
Replace &#x27;f&#x27; with &#x27;q&#x27; for quarter turn optimization, or &#x27;s&#x27; for slice <br>
turn optimization.<br>

to show how the edges are shuffled around? Don&#x27;t u understand the 
concept of orbitals?

Cheers!

For the people that will be arriving early and want to get in touch, <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I would simply vote for Olympicube or maybe Olympic Cube? This is 
because it is most likely to be the first of the greek Olympicubes 
to hit the market. And it&#x27;s an easy nice name. Im not sure what i 
would call the larger Olympicubes though. Maybe just append the 
number/size to the Olympicube name (just like their own naming 
convention ... ) ??

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Well you asked for it...

First off, it&#x27;s usually not a good sign to blame the cube. 
Experienced cubers will be able to tell (combination of accelaration 
and sound), if a cube is reasonably smooth. It is clear that that 
cube is still a bit new. It is true that your recogntion can be 
improved, but you are still new at it, so that really isn&#x27;t your 
main concern as I believe that will naturally develop as you 
practice. It is more important to track down bad habits at this 
point, as well as things that can be seriusly improved upon.

First of all, you&#x27;re right-handed it seems. After you can cube 
without much delays and lockups, consciously focus on becoming more 
ambidexterous, that will help in the long run.

Your right middle finger is LAZY! I feel that the most popular way 
of doing U2 is U with right index and then U with right middle in 
rapid succession. Another way of doing U2 is how DanK wraps around 
it like loosening a jar lid (I forget which hand, maybe either). The 
way I sometimes do it, is U&#x27; with right thumb followed by U&#x27; with 
left index in rapid succession. By the strictest of cubers, it is 
probably categorized as bad form or inefficent to do index-index or 
thumb-thumb way of turning (with the exception of rare cases, say 
that having to do with rapidly altenating hands).

You are not very smooth, an no don&#x27;t blame the cube here. Many 
cubers will practice with less than perfect cubes to develop a sort 
of tolorance. I have even practiced with special &quot;weighted&quot; cubes to 
increase finger strength. &quot;Accuracy&quot; is a popular concept among 
certain cubers. With correct usage of &quot;underturning&quot; 
and &quot;overturning&quot;, transitions can become lock-less.

BTW, you slipped a few times during that solve, the major one was at 
the end. A good cuber will foresee that and compensate accordingly. 
For instance it is a common error for a person new at the DanK/Mirek 
Z-Perm to slip on the last trigger (D2&#x27; F), instead doing (D&#x27; R - R&#x27;-
 D&#x27; F).

Slipping can be easily compensated by thrusting your grip (left 
hand) accordingly.

Again, it is good to note that a more experienced cuber, such as 
Macky would still be fast with your cube (once acclimated to it).

Thinking addtional turns ahead will allow for better transitions...

On the upside, I did notice that your RAW turning speed is quite 
good. Now throw some techno into your next vid :)!

          Hi,

Well you asked for it...

First off, it&#x27;s usually not a good sign to blame the cube. 
Experienced cubers will be able to tell (combination of accelaration 
and sound), if a cube is reasonably smooth. It is clear that that 
cube is still a bit new. It is true that your recogntion can be 
improved, but you are still new at it, so that really isn&#x27;t your 
main concern as I believe that will naturally develop as you 
practice. It is more important to track down bad habits at this 
point, as well as things that can be seriusly improved upon.

First of all, you&#x27;re right-handed it seems. After you can cube 
without much delays and lockups, consciously focus on becoming more 
ambidexterous, that will help in the long run.

Your right middle finger is LAZY! I feel that the most popular way 
of doing U2 is U with right index and then U with right middle in 
rapid succession. Another way of doing U2 is how DanK wraps around 
it like loosening a jar lid (I forget which hand, maybe either). The 
way I sometimes do it, is U&#x27; with right thumb followed by U&#x27; with 
left index in rapid succession. By the strictest of cubers, it is 
probably categorized as bad form or inefficent to do index-index or 
thumb-thumb way of turning (with the exception of rare cases, say 
that having to do with rapidly altenating hands).

You are not very smooth, an no don&#x27;t blame the cube here. Many 
cubers will practice with less than perfect cubes to develop a sort 
of tolorance. I have even practiced with special &quot;weighted&quot; cubes to 
increase finger strength. &quot;Accuracy&quot; is a popular concept among 
certain cubers. With correct usage of &quot;underturning&quot;

Very helpful info
And thanks to Gilles for the list of inputs.

But how do I set Acube up to get as many sequences as possible?  Without DOS?  With a

It&#x27;s not really any more difficult than a revenge so, to me, a superlative doesn&#x27;t really seem 
in order (and besides, if they do intend to bring out larger and larger cubes where does 
one go next?).
Beast is most logical of the above options in the sense of the number of the beast - but 
the beast is a lot worse than a puzzle.
Chuck Norris? It&#x27;s hardly a lethal weapon!
On the other hand, I haven&#x27;t any decent suggestions. :  )
Depending on its stability, maybe it could be called the Collapse. After all, even the 4x4x4 
is prone to breaking up if twisted fast...

Seriously though, I like the name Olympic Cube.  I don&#x27;t think you

Eventually there will  be a 7x7x7, then an 8x8x8, and we&#x27;ll have this

          <div class="email-content">That is all some really great tips, thanks =)

Doug: You&#x27;re absolutely right, I shouldn&#x27;t blame the cube. I wasn&#x27;t really
placing blame, but I do think it is part of the reason I was a bit slow on
it, as you said because I don&#x27;t know how to play the stiff cube very well.
Which is something I am working on. That middle finger trick is very cool. I
was never really good with the finger tricks as most of my fingers are
pretty weak. It takes a pretty strong flick to get it all the way around,
sometimes to the point of me losing my grip. But I suppose they aren&#x27;t going
to get any stronger by me not using them. I am definitely pretty sloppy with
the cube, I have found accuracy to be one of the harder parts of
speedcubing, but I think will come with practice as well. My time has
actually dropped from an average of between 2 and 2.5 minutes in the last 3
weeks with the aid of a properly lubed cube and lots of free time to
practice. And thank you for the compliment on my turning speed, I thought it
was actually rather slow heh, good to know it&#x27;s not.

Pedro: Those algs do seem alot faster, just reading through them I do them
almost as fast as Alan that I have been practicing for almost 3 months now.

Johannes: I have been doing that alot lately. I was trying to go as fast as
possible with what I knew when making the video though =)

Marcus: Thats also something I have been trying to do, shouldn&#x27;t be a
problem once my brain gets that CPU upgrade it has been asking for :-P

Again, thank you all for the advice and hopefully the next video will take
less time to download :-P

Subject: Raise Money for UCP Simply by Searching the Web!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
As many of you know, Iâm the Board President of the Sacramento<br>
affiliate of United Cerebral Palsy.  If youâd like to support us in a<br>
rather painless fashion, read below and switch your default search<br>
engine to GoodSearch.  UCP gets a small amount with each search, but<br>
if enough of you sign up, and forward this note on to others that sign<br>
up, etc., etc.  Thanks and âGoodâ searching!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
p.s. itâs powered by Yahoo search, so itâs no different than if youâre<br>
used to Yahoo!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
<br>
Andy Minden<br>
<br>
CEMA Solutions, Inc.<br>
<br>
Consulting, Engineering &amp; Market Analysis<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Picture this: Every time you search for information on the web,<br>
whether for information on cerebral palsy, a new cheesecake recipe, or<br>
reviews on the latest gadget, you earn money for United Cerebral Palsy<br>
of Greater Sacramento.<br>
<br>
With GoodSearch.com, you can do just that. Each search generates about<br>
a penny for UCP. And since GoodSearch is powered by Yahoo!, you will<br>
get relevant, high-quality search results.<br>
<br>
If 1,000 supporters, volunteers or employees search twice a day<br>
through GoodSearch.com, United Cerebral Palsy would receive an<br>
estimated $7,300 a year to help advocate for the rights of persons<br>
with disabilities. When you select UCP of Greater Sacramento as your<br>
charity all the proceeds generated go directly to support programs in<br>
Sacramento and the 5 county region. The earning potential is without<br>
limits!<br>
<br>
To use the service, open GoodSearch.com, type in &quot;United Cerebral<br>
Palsy&quot; or &quot;UCP&quot; in the &quot;I&#x27;m Supporting&quot; textbox, and click &quot;Verify&quot;.<br>
Choose &quot;UCP of Greater Sacramento.&quot; Then simply search as you would<br>
with any other popular search engine. The next time you go to<br>
GoodSearch.com, the last charity you picked (hopefully UCP) will<br>
already be selected.<br>
<br>
Last year, search engines raked in almost $6 billion from advertising.<br>
Help United Cerebral Palsy of Greater Sacramento harness some of that<br>
cash by using GoodSearch!<br>
<br>
We hope that you will use GoodSearch as your main search engine from<br>
now on and will also pass this message on to your friends and family.<br>
The more people who use this, the more money will go to United<br>
Cerebral Palsy to help advocate for the rights of persons with<br>
disabilities.<br>

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s not a myth--you can see the video on their website. 

In response to those who are critical of the amount of time it has 
taken to bring the 6x6x6 to market, can I just say let&#x27;s give 
Olympic cubes credit for doing what they&#x27;re doing?  it&#x27;s in their 
interest to get a quality cube to market as soon as possible--they 
have invested a lot of time, energy and money.  anyone out there who 
can build a better one, and get it done faster, go for it.  with any 
project of this nature, there are going to be snags and 
unanticipated problems that need to be addressed, but based on what 
I&#x27;ve heard from people who&#x27;ve handled them first hand, they&#x27;re 
making marvelous progress and the existing models are good right now 
(looks encouraging on the videos).  

I say give them the time they need to make the product right so it 
will do what we all want it to do--turn smoothly, not lock up, not 
wear out quickly and not break.  I&#x27;d rather they do it right than 
produce something sub-standard that&#x27;s no real use to anyone.

That is me performing Bob Burton&#x27;s alg for orienting four edges with M
and U. I&#x27;m not that good with slice moves, so I perform it in a
different way.

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys - being from a country where cubing hasn&#x27;t really taken off, <br>
people are usually astounded when they see me solving one (usually the <br>
first time they&#x27;ve ever seen one solved!), and occasionally, I get a <br>
nice guy who will give me a nice freebie =). I&#x27;ve gotten two <br>
complimentary tickets to an Ice Skating rink ($26) and two coffees <br>
($6), so, to this date, I have been able to offset the original costs <br>
of the cube =)<br>
<br>
The majority of the people on this site are MUCH faster than me -- so, <br>
what freebies have you guys managed to rake up? =)<br>
<br>

On a side note, for fun, I made this little spoof (for the end of year <br>
slideshow presentation for grade 12)<br>

Hi,

For the people that will be arriving early and want to get in touch, 
we need a game plan. It also seems that not everybody will be 
staying at the same hotel (it wasn&#x27;t feasible this time).

I know that Clancy is *just* south of SFO, which is very convienent. 
Maybe we could get someone local to help cooridnate something.

First of all, who&#x27;s planning on arriving early? (For this purpose, 
early is before Thursday night.) I will be there Monday night 
(31st). I am especially interested in getting together with those 
traveling alone, perhaps do some sight-seeing? Let&#x27;s check out grad 
schools! :) j/k

I also would like to know where those people are staying.

Is it possible to meet up at the Exploratorium sometime Thursday?

I would like to remind those people: &quot;Entry ... half-price with a 
printed copy of your e-mail confirmation. &quot;

I&#x27;m sure the organizers have to be there early to set-up, when will 
this take place if you don&#x27;t mind me asking? And is there anything 
we early ppl could do to help?

Feel free to email me for private things like cell number. But fyi, 
I am set for hotel. I&#x27;ll rent a car, so if anyone will desperately 
need a ride...

-Doug

I managed a 30s on average with this method, and this without too <br>

1) orient the cross and one corner<br>
2) save oriented corner and permut the cross <br>
3) finish permut and orient last 3 (or 2) corners<br>
This method only use about 30 algorithms insteas of near 70 for the <br>

Matt is on vacation here in Europe.
He visited several countries and travelled with us to Czech Republic.

It is extremely hot here in Europe at the moment.
And so was the venue.

Matt did great.

Have fun,

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Im not really experienced with pairing-up method for 4x4x4 or 5x5x5. 
But i do understand the concepts well enough. 

The advantage of pairing up more than 2 edges at a time is basically 
to save moves (and hence time). One pairs up 2 or 3 edges when 
moving an inner layer (normally) 1 step one way. And same number of 
pairs are paired up on moving that inner layer back the other way. 

There are a couple of problems with this however:

- recognition (finding the pieces) can be slow
- the piece8s) u want may be already sitting (locked) on another 
dedge involved in the pairing process.

For these reasons simply pairing up only 2 edges (dedges) at a time 
can give much better flow (better recognition) when solving and also 
u avoid those possible locking situations. So even if it takes more 
moves u save time by doing few edges &quot;at the same time&quot; ...

I know that some people will pair up first 6 edges, then 4 and 
finally the last 2. Actually when u have only 2 &quot;pairs&quot; left u deal 
with all the special cases, and possibly (somehow) one could deal 
with orientation here also. Lars Vandenbergh uses to do this. I&#x27;m 
not sure whether he still does. Ron van Bruchem can switch between 
double-pairing and higher order of pairing more or less at will (and 
mood?).

Hope this answer is of some help :-)

Cheers!

- Per

PS! Most cubers find the pairing-up stage to be the most crucial 
step because it is usually the most time-consuming :-o

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve scored a few things thanks to cubing. The most exciting thing was a
trip to Budapest! It happened through an amazing coincidence. The night
before flying out to Florida for RWC2005, Dan Harris and I were having
dinner and cubing together at a restaurant in London. We were spotted by
some other diners who came over for a speedcubing demonstration. Turned
out that these people were the organisers of the Hungarian Nationals!
They were so impressed that they invited Dan and I to join Stefan and do
a &#x27;cube show&#x27; as part of the championships in Budapest!

Other than this I&#x27;ve also scored a t-shirt, drinks, puzzles, and an
offer of a job interview.

          <div class="email-content">I used to use that mIRC chatroom, but stopped about a year ago, 
becasue I couldn&#x27;t get on and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why. I feel like 
I&#x27;ve tried everything. I cold never get on using the java applet. I 
use the mIRC program. I think somehow I have a few layers of 
hard/soft firewalls to get through and have to do some sort of port 
forwarding things to get though my router.

If anybody here is experienced in that sort of thing (and using 
mIRC), I would really appriciate some help.

          <div class="email-content">I highly recommend reading Hardwick&#x27;s take on this here:
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4speedsolve2.html

He does 2 at a time usually and believes that to be the fastest for 
him, he is also one of the worlds fastest at 4x4 edges.

I am only around 1:45 total on 4x4, but personally, I just do 
whatever I feel like at the time. Starting out with doing 6 is a 
good way of cleaning everything up to make searching for the remaing 
edge pieces much easier/faster. But I&#x27;m not yet convinced either way.

I am fairly proficent at 5x5 edges however. There&#x27;s much more 
freedom in edge solving methods there.

          <div class="email-content">I meant to write a post a couple weeks ago about how my cube got me my
new job.  In reality, I got this new job because my father worked for
this company for a few years before he moved on, but I met the CEO
because my father was showing off my cubing skills around the office.
 His first impression of me was my quick explanation of how I solve
it, and as I was leaving the room he offered me a job.  Now my parents
are ok with the fact that I spent 4 years playing with this thing, so
if your parents ever ask where the cube will get you in life, point
them to the things in this thread.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,
I prefer the 6-pairs method, because I think it have the potenty to be
faster (and also I really don&#x27;t like the 2-pairs method). People who
prefer the 2-pairs method use this method because of the &#x27;locking
situations&#x27; that can happen during the 6-pairs method. But I don&#x27;t see
this &#x27;locking situations&#x27; as a problem, because I (often) know exactly
how to handle with this situations, sothat I can fix it fast enough.
   After the first 6 pairs I usually use 4-pairs, unless I see that it
wiser to continue with 2-pairs (for example if there only three pairs
left or if I don&#x27;t thrust the situation at that moment).
   I think my big secret to be very fast with 6-pairs is that I only
use R&#x27;U&#x27;R and L&#x27;UL to put an edge from the U-layer to the E-layers (I
don&#x27;t want to make the execution of the 6-pairs method to
complicated). Further I simply rotate my cube 180 degrees if an edge
that I need is in the D-layer, sothat it will be in the U-layer.
   Btw, I don&#x27;t understand why you can&#x27;t have &#x27;locking situations&#x27;
during the 2-pairs. I tried the 2-pairs a few times and sometimes the
edge I need is at the BL or BR slots (the working slots to pair up are
FL and FR). If this happen than I will always be very confused (this
is the main reason I really don&#x27;t like the 2-pairs method).

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m just an intern right now, until I graduate college this December,
but the position is a Systems Engineer doing data storage and
Microsoft/Citrix integration.  I think he was more impressed with my
poise and confidence when talking to a CEO than the actual cubing. 
Also, as I said, he&#x27;s known my father for a long time, and they were
looking for &quot;fresh meat&quot; out of college.  But the cube definitly
didn&#x27;t hurt in that it was a way for me to meet new people and leave
an impression.

          <div class="email-content">My main college essay was also about the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  I also brought
the cube itself to my college interviews and did it blindfolded for
the alumni after the main course of the given interview finished up
(~5 minutes a solve, taking time to make sure there were no DNF&#x27;s).  I
don&#x27;t know how much it helped (my interviewer for Tufts did not want
to see me solve the cube at all... very awkward interview, but that
was the only bad interview and it didn&#x27;t seem to affect admission
negatively), but I got into all my colleges but one (damn you to Hell,
Princeton).  I found the Cube to be a great icebreaker and it allowed
for some really fun discussions and transitions into deeper
discussions pertaining to mathematics/science/art/thought processes/etc.  

It also got me ~$200 over time from various bets with classmates, and
recently a $20 gain from some coworkers, haha.  And, delving into the
too-much-information zone, it also worked magic that I myself cannot
believe :P.  Although I worry in general about being labeled as &quot;that
guy who does the Rubik&#x27;s Cube,&quot; because there are many other
hobbies/traits that are a bit more prominent in my case, and I think
it can hurt one in the female department if you get too into it
publicly, so be careful there.  Although, there are many girls who
find it genuinely interesting and not so much nerdy, who are
themselves really cool people.  A sort of guilty pleasure.

The Cube&#x27;s great! Very fun and interesting to many.  You&#x27;ll find the
Cube does wonders for your spatial reasoning abilities in general :)

By not listing it as a tie, they seem to imply the world record was

Tying a world record is still a very worthy accomplishment, so my
congrats to Milán Baticz, too.

I&#x27;ll just note that Bob&#x27;s record is the only WR that I&#x27;ve personally
captured on video. Now it appears to me to be a shared world record.
(If anyone wants to see it, I&#x27;ll probably have to upload it again.)

I programmed in C for the most part.  The GUI was programmed in visual
studio, so C++.  The solving algorithm itself is Mike Reid&#x27;s implementation
of the Kociemba algorithm, slightly modified to fit the robot.  A copy of my
report, with source code in the appendix is available at
http://www.deepcube.net/reports/rubiks_project_2.pdf or you can get to it by
clicking on the deepcube button and then the report link.  If you need any
help understanding it just let me know, you can shoot me an email at

Until next time, Happy Cubing

          <div class="email-content">Hi Bruce,

The reason why it does not say that it was a tie, is that at that moment I
did not know whether I had to write &#x27;equalled&#x27; or &#x27;equaled&#x27;. I did not
have time to check because I was very busy with several competition
results and a big backlog of e-mails.
Really! :-)

On the world record page it does show that Bob and Milï¿½n share the record.

Magic is a hard puzzle in a competition...

Have fun,

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
So I&#x27;m working at Stanford right now as a counselor, and there was some <br>
interest in an unofficial informal competition.  I have all the <br>
StackMat equipment of course.  There are two possible dates we&#x27;re <br>
looking at for hosting an unofficial competition at Stanford:  Saturday <br>
evening around 7:30 PM, or Monday at 4:00 PM.  We could do during the <br>
week as well, like Tuesday or Wednesday, but I&#x27;d prefer to do it <br>
earlier so I can focus more on organizing for nationals.  This <br>
unofficial competition would be basically within the next week.<br>
<br>
Come by if you&#x27;d like some unofficial practice before US Nationals.  <br>
I&#x27;ll send another e-mail once the day is confirmed.  I&#x27;ll buy dinner <br>
for anyone who beat me in the unofficial blindfold competition.  <br>
Shelley is of course quite eligible.  I think dinner is also warranted <br>
for anyone who beats me in the speed solve competition as long as they <br>
don&#x27;t share my DNA.<br>
<br>
Or... just come by and meet some other cubers before US Nationals and <br>
make fun of my students.  Boo yow.<br>
<br>
(It seems like Saturday would be more desirable.)<br>

<br>
I have now read the above mentioned article. It&#x27;s great! I have a<br>
few questions:<br>
<br>
- how did u come up with those 5 stages?<br>
- how do u make sure u have no &quot;parity&quot; before the last stage? (for<br>
instance UFr and UBl swapped is impossible in the half turn subgroup)<br>
- are u going to make the solver available for the cubing community?<br>
- now how about an analysis for the 5x5x5?<br>
- and finally, how about doing a similar analysis for one of the<br>
frequently used common methods (centers-first -&gt; pairing-up -&gt;<br>
3x3x3+parity)on the 4x4x4?<br>
<br>
For the latter u probably have to divide the steps into substeps to<br>
make the state space small enough for full analysis :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Maximizing the universal utility function? Are you Utilitarian? Hehe,
maximizing that function can be dangerous if you examine how it can be
achieved.  Anyways, I do agree that it is important to ask why you do
something and who it is for.  A parent does not have to drill a child
in order to get something done, but the environment and interest can
be provided and nurtured -- facilitated, if you will.  It&#x27;s probably
the best way for a parent to go about raising an
intelligent/mature/well-rounded child without becoming overbearing.  

You simply provide the means and give a push in the right direction
until their inherent curiosity drives them to learn more about what
you have provided.  Natural curiosity is perhaps the strongest and
most powerful sense you can fuel in a young child, but it&#x27;s not
something you can force.  It&#x27;s a simple concept of association. 
Surround yourself with dedicated people and you&#x27;re more likely to
excel more than the person who is not surrounded by such people.  I
advocate not forcing a passion, but rather finding that passion and
fostering intellectual curiosity and progress.  Especially at a young
age, the marginal benefit from gaining those traits are enormous. 
Regardless, forcing your kid to perform some task hours upon hours a
day is NOT the answer.   True achievement and passion is something
that can only come from within -- it can only derive from one&#x27;s
natural passions.

maximizing that function can be dangerous if you examine how it can be
achieved. Anyways, I do agree that it is important to ask why you do
something and who it is for. A parent does not have to drill a child
in order to get something done, but the environment and interest can
be provided and nurtured -- facilitated, if you will. It&#x27;s probably
the best way for a parent to go about raising an
intelligent/mature/well-rounded child without becoming overbearing. 

You simply provide the means and give a push in the right direction
until their inherent curiosity drives them to learn more about what
you have provided. Natural curiosity is perhaps the strongest and
most powerful sense you can fuel in a young child, but it&#x27;s not
something you can force. It&#x27;s a simple concept of association. 
Surround yourself with dedicated people and you&#x27;re more likely to
excel more than the person who is not surrounded by such people. I
advocate not forcing a passion, but rather finding that passion and
fostering intellectual curiosity and progress. Especially at a young
age, the marginal benefit from gaining those traits are enormous.

&quot;When Talent meets passion, wonders will happen, but when passion
meets skill, all you&#x27;ll get is a thrill.&quot;

Talent and Skill are two completely different things.  Passion adds
another level to each.  That is why (in my opinion) some people are
better at cubing.  If you want to talk to me more about my random
philosophical beliefs and that nonsense, hit me up on IM or an e-mail,
I&#x27;ve been known to ramble a lot...

This is pretty incredible. Though, I hate to be the skeptic and bring

nonetheless. Though I guess the impressiveness of the solve varies

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
Just to let you know that I got a confirmation today of her age and background.<br>
She started learning how to solve 9 months ago.<br>
The video was recorded on July 23, when she was 3 years 4 months and 2 days old.<br>
Her first solve was on July 16, when she was 3 years, 3 months and 25 days old.<br>
Her parents are both school teacher.<br>
It looks like she is a happy child. :-)<br>
<br>
This weekend we will see a 4 year old compete in Tokyo, to become the youngest to have solved a cube in an official competition.<br>
Also a happy child!<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>
<br>
Ron<br>

I programmed in C for the most part. The GUI was programmed in visual

of the Kociemba algorithm, slightly modified to fit the robot. A copy of my
report, with source code in the appendix is available at
http://www.deepcube.net/reports/rubiks_project_2.pdf or you can get to it by

Just to let you know that I got a confirmation today of her age and background.
She started learning how to solve 9 months ago.
The video was recorded on July 23, when she was 3 years 4 months and 2 days old.
Her first solve was on July 16, when she was 3 years, 3 months and 25 days old.
Her parents are both school teacher.
It looks like she is a happy child. :-)

This weekend we will see a 4 year old compete in Tokyo, to become the youngest to have solved a cube in an official competition.
Also a happy child!

Have fun,

Ron

Hmm... can anyone understand the language in the background?

This is pretty incredible. Though, I hate to be the skeptic and bring 
up the easy fact that the birth date could be wrong. The solver could 
easily be born be four years old... still an impressive feat 
nonetheless. Though I guess the impressiveness of the solve varies 
inverse exponentially with the solver&#x27;s age.

Though, on the other hand, and this is a result of my being raised in 
the United States, I&#x27;ve never been too fond of children being drilled 
and forced to learn things. If the kid enjoys solving the cube, then 
fantastic, but I seriously wouldn&#x27;t encourage parents to drill cube 
algorithms into the brain of a two year old.

It&#x27;s one of those things I&#x27;ve seen a bit with the olympics. China is 
preparing for the 2008 Olympics, and it&#x27;s very clear that the country 
is doing a lot of preparation in an attempt to beat the United States 
in the medal count. There is certainly much pride and propaganda at 
stake. I&#x27;ve never felt that the gold medal means as much to an athlete 
who was sent away from home at the age of five to a government 
sponsored training facility, and then performs the sport or athletic 
skill for the mere pursuit of the country&#x27;s political glory in the 
Olympic Games. Carly Patterson, the all-around gold medalist from 2004 
leads a teenage life. Perhaps not the most normal teenage life, but 
she only practices gymnastics five hours a day. That leaves enough 
time (not much) to have friends, go to school, watch movies, and have 
crushes on Michael Phelps.

Our existence in this world I think benefits from the overall picture. 
Maximizing the utility function for happiness and overall world 
happiness is tricky business. In the end, it&#x27;s always important to ask 
why you do what you do, and who is it really for?

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

As i understand it, u are going to use an intuitive first layer? In 
that case all u need is to learn CLL. The last layer has only 
corners ;-)

When u have gathered all CLL algs u can play around with transforming 
all the algs to variants that suit u better. U can always transform to 
for instance only U,R,F moves by:

L->R (+ cube rotation)
B->F (+ cube rotation)
D->U (+ cube rotation)

Alternatively use ACube together with the -a switch to show all 
optimal algs!

Have fun!

          <div class="email-content">I assume you just want to take your 3x3 cube apart? (and it&#x27;s a normal 
rubik&#x27;s brand)

I was looking for images or something more helpful instead of giving a 
discription myself, but this is a quote I found from 
http://jeays.net/rubiks.htm#disassembly
that might help:


&quot;So you want/need to take your cube apart. Turn a face 45 degrees. 
Obtain a fairly flat key or screwdriver. Gently lift the edge piece in 
the middle of the rotated face with your thumb, while gently inserting 
the screwdriver. Slowly prise the piece out. Do not force it. After 
one piece is out the rest come out fairly easily. You might want to 
take a good look at the mechanism that holds the cube together; it&#x27;s 
quite interesting. If you were unclear before about how the centers 
always have the same relative position, it should be very clear now.&quot;


The only thing is that I don&#x27;t personally recommend using a 
screwdriver or anything metal to life the edge piece. The important 
thing is to turn a single face 45 degrees. I&#x27;d say that >95% of cubes 
out of the box can be dissasembled without using any tools, just might 
take some force.

Ah, Enchanted Broccoli Forest. My last year of grad school I rented a room in the building 
that is now EBF. In those days, it was the home of the Alpha Delts fraternity (aka &quot;Alpha 
Drugs&quot;).

I had a room off the &quot;Black Hole&quot;, a hallway where the walls were entirely black then had 
constellations, comets, supernovas, etc painted on them in glow in the dark paint. Many 
were the nights I stepped around or over wasted partygoers who were tripping out to the 
sights of the Black Hole while listening to some strain of &quot;space music&quot; (Grateful Dead, 
Pink Floyd, etc).

I&#x27;d love to go to the contest, just for old time&#x27;s sake, but will be busy with a kid birthday 
party.

For those who do go, if you could see if the &quot;Black Hole&quot; still exists and let me know I&#x27;d 
appreciate it.

Thanks and have fun!

  Just to let you know that I got a confirmation today of her age and background.
  She started learning how to solve 9 months ago.
  The video was recorded on July 23, when she was 3 years 4 months and 2 days old.
  Her first solve was on July 16, when she was 3 years, 3 months and 25 days old.
  Her parents are both school teacher.
  It looks like she is a happy child. :-)

  This weekend we will see a 4 year old compete in Tokyo, to become the youngest to have solved a cube in an official competition.
  Also a happy child!

  Have fun,

  Hmm... can anyone understand the language in the background?

  This is pretty incredible. Though, I hate to be the skeptic and bring 
  up the easy fact that the birth date could be wrong. The solver could 
  easily be born be four years old... still an impressive feat 
  nonetheless. Though I guess the impressiveness of the solve varies 
  inverse exponentially with the solver&#x27;s age.

  Though, on the other hand, and this is a result of my being raised in 
  the United States, I&#x27;ve never been too fond of children being drilled 
  and forced to learn things. If the kid enjoys solving the cube, then 
  fantastic, but I seriously wouldn&#x27;t encourage parents to drill cube 
  algorithms into the brain of a two year old.

  It&#x27;s one of those things I&#x27;ve seen a bit with the olympics. China is 
  preparing for the 2008 Olympics, and it&#x27;s very clear that the country 
  is doing a lot of preparation in an attempt to beat the United States 
  in the medal count. There is certainly much pride and propaganda at 
  stake. I&#x27;ve never felt that the gold medal means as much to an athlete 
  who was sent away from home at the age of five to a government 
  sponsored training facility, and then performs the sport or athletic 
  skill for the mere pursuit of the country&#x27;s political glory in the 
  Olympic Games. Carly Patterson, the all-around gold medalist from 2004 
  leads a teenage life. Perhaps not the most normal teenage life, but 
  she only practices gymnastics five hours a day. That leaves enough 
  time (not much) to have friends, go to school, watch movies, and have 
  crushes on Michael Phelps.

  Our existence in this world I think benefits from the overall picture. 
  Maximizing the utility function for happiness and overall world 
  happiness is tricky business. In the end, it&#x27;s always important to ask 
  why you do what you do, and who is it really for?

          <div class="email-content">Hi Evan --

Nice work on deepcube! Does it travel? I&#x27;m sure if you could get it installed at the 
Exploratorium during US Nationals, it would be quite a hit with audience and cubers alike 
(and fit in well with the Exploratorium &quot;theme&quot;).

I thought I&#x27;d toss you an idea that you might consider for a future project. I&#x27;ve been 
interested in an &quot;instrumented&quot; Rubik&#x27;s cube, one equipped with internal sensors and a 
wireless transmitter. The sensor data would be sent wirelessly to a computer that could 
use the data to display the current cube configuration on a simulated cube.

Thus, while someone solved the cube you could be showing their solution in progress, in 
real-time, on a simulated and animated cube (jcube, etc). 

One could even add a gyro so you could even track the orientation of the cube itself (ie, I 
tilt the cube, the animation tilts).

I always thought that would be an interesting and fun project - maybe you&#x27;d like to give it 
a shot (you mention on your website somehow &quot;turning the project inside out&quot;).

again, nice work on deepcube!

<br>
i took a cheapy dollar store cube, and removed the coloured plastic squares (used instead of stickers), and sanded them. then i took what was left of the original stickers off my cube and then cleaned it. i sanded the cube and cleaned it again. this was to ensure a good bond between the cube an plastic bits. and then glued the plastic on the cube. <br>
<br>
this brings up two obvoius issues, wich i noted right away.<br>
1. the cube was heavier, seemingly, alot heavier. probably because i was still so used to my normal cube. i got used to this in about 30 mins of solving.<br>
<br>
2. the cube is bigger. true, but only by about, 1/8 of an inch, wich i got fully used to in about an hour or so.<br>

Ur best bet for an &quot;Über method&quot; is maybe simply like this :

- orient all
- permute all

There&#x27;s already methods doing that, but i think the orient all is 2 
steps. I do believe it&#x27;s feasible to do that in one step only!

Good luck :-)

          <div class="email-content">Both suggestions (tiles and using nail polish) are fairly common. If 
you&#x27;ve been cubing for at least a few years it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ve 
tried things like that.

Let&#x27;s see... I&#x27;ve tried nail polish, certain enamels, things that 
required some oven-time..., using textured tiles from a Mefferts 
assembly cube, tiles from a cheap knock off cube, the stickers from 
rubiks.com. All of which I know find pretty tiresome. Similar 
stories from other longtime cubers.

I must admit though, using colored electrical tape for a couple 
years did start to look really good though. But again, not very 
convienent, especially with my high standards for how rounded the 
corners should be, and the exact sizing, despite having fortitude 
for precision use of sissors.

Don&#x27;t sacrifice convienence for price. I recommend going with 
**CUBESMITH** sticker sets. Buy 8 standard sets for just $10, no 
shipping and occasionally $1/set at tournaments if you are lucky 
enough. Just be sure to get a consistancy with their blue, green, 
and yellow (there are at least two variations of those 
unfortunately). Those actually last pretty long, plus look amazing.

Another point. Do not support knock-off cubes from say... a dollor 
store. Those are technically illigal. Only support true rubik&#x27;s 
brand puzzles, Mefferts, and/or Eastsheen. Educate peeps that don&#x27;t 
know better.

I thought of the method a step after that today. Get pieces in their

Actually, Rune, I talked a little with Thom about this method on the
Rubik&#x27;s chat yesterday. I started learning this method a few months
ago, but by some reason I quit. I will start it up eventually. I only
learned 15-20 algs, but these you guys can see here:

http://www.student.itn.liu.se/~gunkr520/222_avancerad.txt

The algs are numbered like on Bob Burton&#x27;s COLL-site (except the &quot;1&quot;
in the start).

Just to let you know that I got a confirmation today of her age and background.
She started learning how to solve 9 months ago.
The video was recorded on July 23, when she was 3 years 4 months and 2 days old.
Her first solve was on July 16, when she was 3 years, 3 months and 25 days old.
Her parents are both school teacher.
It looks like she is a happy child. :-)

This weekend we will see a 4 year old compete in Tokyo, to become the youngest to have solved a cube in an official competition.
Also a happy child!

Have fun,

Hmm... can anyone understand the language in the background?

This is pretty incredible. Though, I hate to be the skeptic and bring 
up the easy fact that the birth date could be wrong. The solver could 
easily be born be four years old... still an impressive feat 
nonetheless. Though I guess the impressiveness of the solve varies 
inverse exponentially with the solver&#x27;s age.

Though, on the other hand, and this is a result of my being raised in 
the United States, I&#x27;ve never been too fond of children being drilled 
and forced to learn things. If the kid enjoys solving the cube, then 
fantastic, but I seriously wouldn&#x27;t encourage parents to drill cube 
algorithms into the brain of a two year old.

It&#x27;s one of those things I&#x27;ve seen a bit with the olympics. China is 
preparing for the 2008 Olympics, and it&#x27;s very clear that the country 
is doing a lot of preparation in an attempt to beat the United States 
in the medal count. There is certainly much pride and propaganda at 
stake. I&#x27;ve never felt that the gold medal means as much to an athlete 
who was sent away from home at the age of five to a government 
sponsored training facility, and then performs the sport or athletic 
skill for the mere pursuit of the country&#x27;s political glory in the 
Olympic Games. Carly Patterson, the all-around gold medalist from 2004 
leads a teenage life. Perhaps not the most normal teenage life, but 
she only practices gymnastics five hours a day. That leaves enough 
time (not much) to have friends, go to school, watch movies, and have 
crushes on Michael Phelps.

Our existence in this world I think benefits from the overall picture. 
Maximizing the utility function for happiness and overall world 
happiness is tricky business. In the end, it&#x27;s always important to ask 
why you do what you do, and who is it really for?

          <div class="email-content">Only the polypropylene stickers that come with most cubes will peel 
that easily. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC/polychloroethene) stickers from 
rubiks.com will not peel. (Although their corners do occasionally 
fold if very careless.) I do not recommend purchasing the 
polypropylene stickers from rubiks.com, they are basically laminated 
paper with a dye in between.

So why do they sell both sticker types? The ones that last longer 
are muted in brightness and the ones that peel easily are quite 
bright and cheerful.

The solution: make thicker PVC stickers!

In general, due to their pricing and failure to make PVC stickers 
thick enough, I personally boycott them. Instead I opt to buy from 
cubesmith.com, which offers superior service and stickers of amazing 
quality and lifespan.

Also, do note that cubesmith sets are somewhat &quot;soft,&quot; and 
rubiks.com&#x27;s PVC ones are rather &quot;hard.&quot; This has trade-offs as well 
which is probably beyond the scope of this topic.

The problem with painting your cube in anyway, is that it&#x27;s going to 
end up looking terrible. Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried everyting. Besides, it 
somehow violates an intrinsic nature of the pop icon itself. And for 
the same reason I don&#x27;t use tiled cubes. So unless you are going for 
a special look... I see no reason why any passionate cuber would 
want to do that to their cubes, let alone their main speedcube.

On the other hand, is it really not alllowed in competitions? I was 
not aware of this. Plus, I&#x27;m sure that some one was using a painted 
cube at Nationals 04... o_O?? When was this rule added and why? 
(Just curious, doesn&#x27;t really concern me.)

Oh, I almost forgot to mention... rubiks.com has rather crappy 
service IMHO, but I&#x27;ve hear varing things from other buyers.

I was thinking the same thing the first time I watched it... I think <br>
that is a bit unnecessary though. At her hand size/turning speed, it <br>
would have been faster for her to do the slice/Allan version. <br>
Learning that version first is helpful to really understanding algs. <br>
I don&#x27;t know of any cuber that &quot;understands&quot; the 2-gen version.<br>

I&#x27;m not a big supporter of applying algs blindly, I think it is <br>
important to have a solid comprehension of what an alg is doing, to <br>
be able to come up with commutators yourself, and even make up <br>
algorithms on-the-fly like the most expert cubists. But then again, <br>
I&#x27;m quite slow at solving, so it appears that applying algs blindly <br>

Two main reasons.  People who have colors that &quot;bleed&quot; might be able to 
use it to their advantage.

As every other sport has standards regarding their equipment, we want 
some standard of decency on your cube as well.

Do you mean that bright colors (which tend to &quot;bleed&quot;, i.e. bright<br>
orange from cubesmith) are not allowed or just that &quot;not using<br>

<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

No, it doesn&#x27;t travel very well.  I would love to bring it to the nationals,
but sadly my parents planned a family vacation that starts the day before
:-(  It&#x27;s been so long since I have been able to go to a competition.

Yeah, I had thought of a cube like that too, but I was thinking of using it
has a remote control for the robot.  Why push buttons to scramble it when
you can just scramble a real cube and watch it happen.  Although I was
thinking that instead of wireless maybe just have a wire coming out of a
single side back to the computer.  I&#x27;ll see what I can do.  I start school
at Carnegie Mellon in the fall, what better place to make robots, gadgets,
and other unnecessary cool engineering stuff than there?  If I do anything
cube related it will be posted, so we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see.

Until next time, Happy Cubing

The wording &quot;normal 6 colour scheme&quot; is used to encourage people to use <br>
the six standard colors that come on a Rubik&#x27;s Cube, also gives the <br>
competition organizer and WCA delegate the option of disallowing cubes <br>
with odd color schemes.  In particular, we would be a bit worried about <br>
a cube that has six sides of varying shades of gray which would be very <br>
difficult to distinguish from one another.  Determining when the cube <br>
is solved shouldn&#x27;t take more than a mere glance and that wording <br>
protects against that.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been working on this method for a while.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been making breakthoughs daily.<br>
I think I have found the best approach to this method.<br>
<br>
Why take on something new?<br>
<br>
Here are the reason that I believe you should be interested in<br>
learning Simulatenous Block, SB for short, or as Kyuubree suggested,<br>
The Shotgun Method.<br>
<br>
Here is what this method offers<br>
-- 12 New Algorithms to simultaneously permute a corner and an edge.<br>
-- 2 moves per set<br>
-- No annoying parity<br>
-- The full method uses 18 Algs Total to solve the cube<br>
-- Can be done using 10 Algs, setups aren&#x27;t as easy, an extra move maybe<br>
-- To solve the cube, only need to execute 13 algs ... max!<br>
-- A Memorization System, that you can  build to suit you<br>
<br>
The method is prescribed as this.<br>
<br>
Solve the F and B face + 1 S slice edge<br>
Roux Cycle<br>
Parity Fix -- Yea, there is a parity ... no big deal.<br>
<br>
I figured I&#x27;d whet your appetites, while Marcus and I work on the method.<br>

          <div class="email-content">May I make a note?  This is a new parity.  Some may not consider it a<br>
parity.  Because most BLDers deal with it all the time, it&#x27;s something<br>
that you encounter at the end of the solve.  But don&#x27;t worry,  it&#x27;s no<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello Per! Here are my answers to the questions you asked.

> - how did u come up with those 5 stages?

I used the program called GAP to look at the sizes of various
subgroups (based upon slice turn generators) of the 4x4x4 supercube
group. I looked for nested groups for which the quotient of the
respective sizes was less than 1E+13, preferably less than 1E+12.
Based on this, it looked to me that it was within the realm of
possibility to analyze the 4x4x4 supercube using the 5 stages that I
chose. Of course, it made sense to me to limit my actual analysis to
the &quot;ordinary&quot; 4x4x4, since that would be far easier to do and
probably of more general interest.

> - how do u make sure u have no &quot;parity&quot; before the last stage? (for
> instance UFr and UBl swapped is impossible in the half turn subgroup)

As for the specific case you mention, in stage 3, I make sure that the
edges end up in an even permutation (at the completion of that stage).
The restricted set of moves of the later stages do not permit the
parity of the edges to change. If UFr and UBl are swapped (and all
other edges are in place), you have an odd permutation of edges, so
that case is not possible when you get to stage 5. (In fact, I missed
the fact that this parity constraint needed to be part of stage 3 when
I initially attempted to do the stage 3 analysis.)

In general, the half-turn subgroup of the 4x4x4 supercube allows
certain mutually exclusive sets of eight cubies to be permuted among
themselves. Each of these sets of eight can be further divided into
two sets of four that are permuted among themselves. Of these 576
permutations, only 96 are reachable with half turns only. For the
ordinary 4x4x4, the 96 permutations of the centers reduce to 12
distinguishable configurations. So there are 96^3 configurations of
edge cubies, 96 configurations of the corner cubies, and 12^3
configurations of the center cubies that are reachable with half turns
only. It turns out that all combinations (96^3 * 96 * 12^3) of these
configurations are reachable with half turns. (A side note: for the
4x4x4 supercube, only 1/8 of the 96^3 * 96 * 96^3 positions are
reachable with half turns.) So I have to make sure that each of the
seven sets of eight cubies get put into one of the allowable
configurations by the end of stage 4.

> - are u going to make the solver available for the cubing community?

I&#x27;ll comment on this in a separate post later.

> - now how about an analysis for the 5x5x5?

Well, I would say I won&#x27;t be tackling that immediately. I am thinking
of doing all five stages of my 4x4x4 analysis in terms of &quot;twist
turns&quot; as opposed to slice turns. (I&#x27;ve done this for two of the
stages only, so far.) I&#x27;ve also thought about doing the same five
stages for the 4x4x4 supercube.

> - and finally, how about doing a similar analysis for one of the

> 3x3x3+parity)on the 4x4x4?

Jaap Scherphuis has done a 2-stage analysis of the centers-first part
(see message 20514). His analysis assumes doing two opposite centers
first.

Pairing edges and fixing edge parities involve temporarily breaking up
the solved centers, so the analysis would have to allow for that in
some way. This adds some complexity to the analysis, but I imagine
that such an analysis could be carried out.

Perhaps after U.S. Nationals I&#x27;ll at least give a closer look at the
feasibility of these last two suggestions.

I just wanted to explain that I didn&#x27;t think the world records
page had been updated yet, but I think my browser kept showing me
a cached old version, instead of checking if a new version was out
there. I should have tried the reload button. Anyway, I blame myself
for not seeing the updated WR page, and I&#x27;ve changed my browser
settings to be more aggressive about checking for updated pages.

          <div class="email-content">What if there is absolutely no polish bleedover? Assume that the exact
area covered by a sticker is then replaced by nail polish -- no
difference in area covered.  Are white plastic cubes allowed even
though the way the colors interact with the eyes may differ? What
about differing color schemes? I mean any such things can technically
provide an &quot;advantage&quot; for certain people -- as long as there is no
difference in area of visibility or the nature of the visibility
itself (ie. from any given angle it is no easier or harder to
determine a predefined color on either a stickered or polished
edge/corner).  Would this be an unfair request in terms of a
modification of the rules? Polish stays so much easier than stickers
and doesn&#x27;t mess up when you apply silicone to the cube.  Furthermore,
stickers for the bigger cubes are just not up to snuff (I mean
technically any peeling of a sticker on a 5x5x5 cube, for instance,
may give a BLD cuber a tactile advantage, etc).

          <div class="email-content">I painted my revenge cube. I took off the stickers and painte with little jars of model paint, which has an acrylic-like toughness. I see what you mean about it not looking very good. I guess if I had put thin tape along all the edges it would have looked fine, as the paint would form squares much like stickers, rather than covering pretty much the whole face of the cubie.<br>
<br>
As for solving the pocket cube, I found from the &quot;Jeff Conquers the Cube in 45 Seconds&quot; book about what he calls &quot;correct edges&quot;. It is a clever visual shortcut for corner placement (so that the four sides of the layer are solid, i.e. correct edges). You have either no correct edges, one correct edge, or all correct edges. If you have none, just swap two diagonal corners. If you have one correct edge, swap the two adjacent corners across from it. That&#x27;s it. By the way, when doing the second layer the same way, remember that in 2*2*2 speak, a double parallel swap is equivalent in effect to a diagonal swap, and a 3-cycle is equivalent to an adjacent swap.<br>

have a gift for spacial thinking. He might have intuitively stumbled 
upon commutators. It doesn&#x27;t seem too far fetched at all.

          <div class="email-content">Hem, Jon was into painting his cubes a whle back, I was hoping for 
input from him.

I can understand how you feel. I&#x27;ve argued for as many non-standard 
things as any cuber has. It dates back to me wanting to use a 
different color scheme in the Toronto Chamionship.

However, in this case I agree with the rules as stated. It&#x27;s much 
easier to police stickers than any sort of paint. Besides, any paint 
I&#x27;ve used chips away and quickly looks aweful... Assuming you cube 
as much as I do, then it would be cheaper in the long run to buy 
stickers. Stronger, longer lasting paints would cost much more than 
stickers and if you factor in the life of the cube than it still is 
not worth it. (I did the math.)

Then again it might not chip off so much if I wasn&#x27;t solving my cube 
>300 times daily, hehe.

          <div class="email-content">I wasn&#x27;t aware they started doing this. Pretty cool though. I would go 
for the assembly version. They end up being the same though, same 
price too. it does say that for the assembly one: &quot;can not be

and the only benefit to getting it dissassembled is so that you can 
look at their mechanism, which I would love to, since they can&#x27;t 
normally be disassembled (with the exception of 1 interesting claim I 
heard from one Japanese cube site).

BTW, I don&#x27;t think that either version comes with Lube. Also this type 
of plastic does not benefit as much from lubrication as normal cube 
plastics.

So in conlusion, it matters very little. It is good to have one of 
those though. I still use mine a little bit every now and then, 
Cubesmith stickers though, cuz the included ones will peel.

How about asking him, can&#x27;t he speak? That is, how he solved it. Or

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

And now I&#x27;ll talk about making my solver available to others.

Yes, I intend to make my five-stage available to people who would like
to try it. There are a number of issues to take care of first, though.

First, the program uses huge data files. In its current form, the
files take up  a little over 4.7 gigabytes or about 1.4 gigabytes
compressed. So it seems rather large for downloading. It seems more
convenient to put on a DVD data disc. It would be possible to
convert the files to pack 5 values per byte, to reduce the total file
size to around 2.7 gigabytes. I&#x27;m not sure about the memory
requirements at this point, but I expect at least a 512 MB system
would be required.

Second, I&#x27;ll note the program uses a very simple algorithm right now.
It simply looks for a  move that will get it one move closer to a
distance-0 position of the current stage. It repeats that until it
reaches a distance-0 position, and then repeats for the next stage,
and so on through all five stages. There may often be multiple such
moves that will work, and depending on what path is picked to solve
one stage may affect how many moves will be required at the next
stage. So what I&#x27;m trying to say is that it could be modified to try 
multiple paths in the first four stages in order to find shorter
overall solutions than what it currently produces, at some cost in
extra time required. At present, it also doesn&#x27;t even simplify
redundant moves that may occur across stage boundaries. I&#x27;m also
thinking of modifying it so the boundaries for the five stages are
clearly indicated (if the user desires that).

Algorithms that use an iterative deepening search with pruning tables
should be able to provide even shorter solutions, if what you really
want is near optimal solutions.  I wrote my solver to validate my
five-stage method. The goal of the solver has not been to generate
near-optimal solutions.

Third, it initially just created random cubes to solve. I&#x27;ve added an
ability to parse a scramble string, but I assume an input format based
upon facelet pattern is desirable, or better, a GUI interface that
lets you modify facelets, rotate slices, and so on. Right now, the
program is designed for use in a command window.

Fourth, my program currently uses an absolute path for where to look
for the data files. That needs to be changed.

Currently I have been using a Visual Studio .NET compiler, so I
believe it requires .NET runtime software even though I do not really
use any .NET features. I am not clear if that&#x27;s much of a problem for
Windows users. I am thinking porting it to Java may make it generally
useful on more platforms.

Finally, I want to do some generally cleaning up of the code. The
current program outputs some rather meaningless text that I want to
eliminate, for example.

I am planning on being at the U.S. Nationals, so I will try to have
some DVD data discs available at that time. I will try to have a
usable version of the solver and the data on the disc. I would like
to be be given a nominal amount of money for each disc to cover media
cost and the time I spend making them. After U.S. Nationals, I will
try to figure out what to do for people who can&#x27;t make it there.

I assume the data was computed? Can&#x27;t it be computed again on another

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan :-)

That&#x27;s what im thinking also. For example for Kociemba&#x27;s Cube Explorer 
the pruning tables are computed first time u run the program. Then 
simply read from disk into memory on successive runs. Same goes the 
huge optimal solver that generates even larger pruning tables. So, yes 
it must be possible to generate the data on another computer. 
Technically there might be some issuse though, when RAM is limited 
below the size for the file(s) generated. Many i/o operations might 
make the calculations painfully slow ??

          <div class="email-content">Well, I thought about distributing programs for generating the files,
but here is why I thought otherwise.

First, my code for generating the files assume 1 GB of RAM. So this
would mean the user would definitely need 1 GB of RAM unless I made
major changes to the code.

Second, the runtime to generate the files is huge. I was thinking it
might be days, but in checking my log files, it looks like the runtime
for all five stages combined was about 21 hours. This was on a 2.4GHz P4.

Third, due to the way my algorithms squeezed the data into 1 GB, it
was necessary to write disk files after each &quot;step&quot; of processing.
Afterwards, the files from the various steps may have been needed to
be merged into a single file, or for some of the stages, just the last 
file would be needed. This created a lot more in the way of disk files
than what was ultimately needed for the solver program. In some cases,
extra file processing steps were performed to convert the files into a
more convenient format. To have the user generate the files, This
process really needs some redesign to make it more automated and
convenient for the user. However, it would take some time for me to do
this and test it.

Perhaps sometime after U.S. Nationals, I&#x27;ll look into doing this, if
people are interested in generating the files themselves after knowing
what the memory requirements are and how much runtime is involved.

          <div class="email-content">Yes and no.... it depends on how proficent you are at using things 
like a computer algebra proogram like GAP, the Burnside Counting

you suprise, it might even be something previously answered.

In most cases, I just count them using pencil and paper because I&#x27;ve 
done that sort of thing so much.

Instead of saying &quot;amount of algorithms,&quot; something like &quot;number of

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m ready to post the idea yet...I will anyway so 
that I can make my decision for what direction I should take.

Alright, what would be the number of distinct cases for a step like 
this:

Permute U corners while bringing E edges to E layer and keeping the 
orientation of all edges on the cube.  All edges on the cube are 
already oriented before going to this step.  The 4 E-edges may be at 
UF, UR, UB, UL, DF, DR, FR, BR, BL, and FL.  The algorithm must not 
mess up UFL, DL, DBL, DB, DBR, or DFR.  The E edges do not have to be 
placed in their right places in this step, they only have to be in 
the layer somewhere, oriented.  The U and D edges do not have to be 
placed in their right spots either.  The U edges can be at DF, DR, or 
anywhere in U, it doesn&#x27;t matter, as long as they are oriented...same 
goes for the 2 D edges.  The 4 U corners don&#x27;t have to be lined up 
with the centers once the algorithm is done.  E layer doesn&#x27;t have to 
be lined up either

That is all of the disclaimers I could think about.  I don&#x27;t know how 
to do this because I don&#x27;t know what is possible on the cube except 
the basic stuff like there are always an even number of oriented 
edges or none at all.  I went over every case I could think of 2 
nights ago and I got 97 cases, today I counted 80 something.  I&#x27;m not 
sure which of those cases aren&#x27;t possible though.  Kind of like how 
you can&#x27;t have 2 edges in U un-permuted when the rest of the cube is 
solved.

Also, what about this:

Permute 6 edges.  The edges are at UF, UR, UB, UL, DF, and DR.  The 
rest of the cube must not be affected at all.

I really would be surprised if either of those have been answered 
before.

There&#x27;s no general definition for orientation so you need to provide 
one.

L and R as flipping 4 edges.

Also, could you double check this: &quot;The algorithm must not
mess up UFL, DL, DBL, DB, DBR, or DFR.&quot; It doesn&#x27;t feel right. Are 
you sure you don&#x27;t mean &#x27;DFL&#x27; there? Also what would you count as a 
distinct case? I could group diagonally-symmetric cases as one. I 
could even group cases that use inverse algorithms together. If U 
layer is not free for the first turn, than you could get what I like 
to think of as a single case counted 4 times.

This question sounds familiar, like I&#x27;ve already heard something 
similar before, but it is definately a hard one and may take some 
time.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, it was supposed to say &quot;DFL&quot;.

I don&#x27;t really understand or know anything about inverses and mirrors 
and symmetry and all of that crazy stuff but hopefully this helps:

-Add in the inverses the stuff like that but tell me how many 
distinct cases there are with those included and without.

-Don&#x27;t count U adjustments.  I don&#x27;t mind having to adjust U before 
doing an algorithm.

So far I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s around 102.  If so, no way.  I&#x27;m going with 
my other option.  This is what I&#x27;ve been counting:

Already permuted: 17 cases
Diagonal swap: 18 cases (1 for E edges already in E)
Adjacent swap: 69 cases (same as above)

Is there a site that describes these kinds of things?

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

>From what I understand, you have 4 corner cubies in the U layer to be
put into correct relative order (orientation doesn&#x27;t matter). You have
10 edges that can be permuted around without changing orientation. Of
those 10 edges, 4 are E-layer edges which can be considered
indistinguishable from each other. These E-layer edges are all
required to end up in the E layer. The other set of 6 edges can also
be considered to be indistinguishable from each other. The U layer can
be rotated before (and after, if you want the corners correctly placed
relative to the center) the algorithm. Likewise, the E layer can be
rotated before and after the algorithm. (Rotating after to get the
E-layer centers back into correct position, if needed.)

So to count the different cases you can have, consider the different
cases of where the E-layer edges can be, and count the cases for each
of the possible corner permutation situations (no swap, swap 2
adjacent, swap to diagonally opposite). First break down the edge
cases by how many might be in each layer. For each possible number of
E-layer edges in each of the layers, determine the number of cases
possible for each of the corner permutation situations.

Then build a table of all the possibilities:

(best viewed using fixed-width font)

U-E-D      no swap      adj. swap    diag. swap
-----      -------      ---------    ----------
4 0 0      1*1*1 =  1   1*1*1 =  1   1*1*1 =  1
3 1 0      1*1*1 =  1   4*1*1 =  4   2*1*1 =  2
3 0 1      1*1*2 =  2   4*1*2 =  8   2*1*2 =  4
2 2 0      2*2*1 =  4   6*2*1 = 12   4*2*1 =  8
2 1 1      2*1*2 =  4   6*1*2 = 12   4*1*2 =  8
2 0 2      2*1*1 =  2   6*1*1 =  6   4*1*1 =  4
1 3 0      1*1*1 =  1   4*1*1 =  4   2*1*1 =  2
1 2 1      1*2*2 =  4   4*2*2 = 16   2*2*2 =  8
1 1 2      1*1*1 =  1   4*1*1 =  4   2*1*1 =  2
0 4 0      1*1*1 = (1)  1*1*1 =  1   1*1*1 =  1
0 3 1      1*1*2 =  2   1*1*2 =  2   1*1*2 =  2
0 2 2      1*2*1 =  2   1*2*1 =  2   1*2*1 =  2
                  ---          ---          ---
                   25           72           44

So I get 25+72+44 = 141 cases. The 1 in parentheses in the table
indicates the case where no algorithm needs to be performed. So if you
don&#x27;t count that case, then I get 140.

I have not considered the diagonal symmetry in the above, but then, I
understand you were not asking for that to be taken into consideration.

I just thought I would add my own comments about the edge orientation
issue.

I agree with Doug in that the key in what you said was that F and B
moves flip four edges.

>From that I assume you mean, that to be oriented:
 - an edge cubie that belongs in the M or S slice, and is currently
located in one of those slices,  must have its U or D facelet aligned
with the U or D center
 - an edge cubie that belongs in the M or S slice, and is located in
the E slice, must have it U or D facelet aligned with the F or B center.
 - an edge cubie that belongs in the E slice, and is located in the E
slice, must have its F or B facelet aligned with the F or B center (or
equivalently, its R or L face aligned with the R or L center)
 - an edge cubie that belongs in the E slice, and is located in the M
or S slice, must have its F or B face aligned with the U or D center.

When an edge is in the inner slice that it belongs to, its usually
assumed that the edge would be oriented if each of its facelets is
aligned with the same color center, or the center that is opposite
that center. (Someone could define edge orientation in a way such that
the above would not be the case, but I would say this is rare.) But
when an edge is moved to a different inner slice than the one it
belongs in, it is not generally as clear what it means to be oriented.

Doug mentioned a way of defining edge orientation such that moving L
or R a quarter-turn flips four edges. There is yet another way of
defining edge orientation that I have used in computer analyses of the
cube. You can define edge orientation such that moving any of the
layers U, D, L, R, F, or B a quarter-turn flips all four edges moved.
This is the most symmetrical way of defining edge orientation. But
define edge orientation in the way that makes the most sense for your
situation. With your way, you can keep all edges oriented simply by
avoiding F, F&#x27;, B, and B&#x27; moves (F2 and B2 okay, of course).

          <div class="email-content">Thanks.  All of what you said sounds right.  But there is one thing 
I&#x27;m not sure if you considered that I may have looked over in your 
post.

What about the &quot;empty spaces&quot; available in E for the cases where 2 E 
edges need to be placed?  Like, if you have an empty space at FR and 
BR or you can have the spaces at FR and BL (although you could do 
R2ER2 before the algorithm).

If it really is 140 cases then that is WAY too many for me to make 
and learn.  I&#x27;m definitly going with my other option.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Yes, you&#x27;re right. I considered rotations of the E layer, but not more
complicated adjustment moves like R2 E R2. If you allow that, then the
middle multipliers in my table all become 1, and you can just multiply
the first and third number. With that, my 140 cases (excluding the
do-nothing case) get reduced to 111 cases. (I think I did the
arithmetic correctly.) Again, I haven&#x27;t looked at using mirrors and
inverses to reduce the number of algorithms further.

Sorry, it looks like my table&#x27;s formatting wasn&#x27;t preserved, at least
if viewed from the Yahoo web site. You would think the Preview button
would actually show you what your post was going to look like,
wouldn&#x27;t you? In Preview, it looked fine, but the actual post appears
to have all &quot;redundant&quot; space characters stripped out.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks, 111 is better than 140, but not much.

If you could reduce the number using mirrors and inverses, how much 
would it be?  If you don&#x27;t mind.  I&#x27;ve been working hard for a month 
trying to perfect everything so I can get to work on finding the 
algorithms for the idea I choose.

Inverse = backwards
Mirror = LUL&#x27;ULU2L&#x27; is the mirror of R&#x27;U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2R

Correct?

Not quite.

Yes, inverses means execute the algorithm backwards, so L U F2 R&#x27;
would become R F2 U&#x27; L&#x27;, for example. Note the moves themselves are
done backwards, not just the order of the moves.

Since your only symmetry axis is diagonal (BL-FR), the usual way of
mirroring will (generally speaking) not work. Think of it as if you
are looking at the FR corner of the cube instead of looking at the F face.

So you get the following pairs of moves and their mirror counterparts.

F R&#x27;
F&#x27; R
F2 R2
L B&#x27;
L&#x27; B
L2 B2
U U&#x27;
D D&#x27;
U2 U2
D2 D2

This type of mirroring may not be as intuitive to most people and may
take some getting used to.

However, if you have an algorithm that does not have an effect on the
edge in the DR position, then it appears to me that such an algorithm
could be mirrored in the &quot;usual&quot; way. 

Note that an algorithm that moves the DR cubie would move the DL cubie
if you mirrored the algorithm in the usual left-right fashion. But you
don&#x27;t allow the DL cubie to be affected, so that mirror algorithm
could not be used. If you do mirroring about the BL-FR axis, however,
an algorithm that moves the DR cubie will move the DF cubie, and that
cubie is allowed to move.

Your example LUL&#x27;ULU2L&#x27; becomes B&#x27;U&#x27;BU&#x27;B&#x27;U2B. Since that alg only
affects the U layer (and specifically not the DR position), your
mirror version could also be used. I&#x27;ll note that this alg (a version
of Sune) does not affect the order of the U corners or move anything
into the E layer, so it isn&#x27;t useful for the particular method step
you&#x27;re talking about, though. (Of course, I know you never claimed
that it would be.)

Hope this helps.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been cubing for a long time and doing algorithms backwards since 
I started, I just never knew the name.

Mirroring is confusing.  Looks like I&#x27;ve got to learn how to do it 
though.

I guess I&#x27;ll go with my other idea since this one has so many 
algorithms.  But before I completely switch, I can mirror algorithms 
that would place the DR edge to be able to place DF edges and it 
would affect the same pieces that the DR placing algorithm would, 
right?

If I didn&#x27;t explain that well enough, I&#x27;ll email you about it.

Thanks for helping me make my decision Bruce :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

I have booked at Good Nite Inn SFO. I figure I can bart into the city.
The Exploratorium web site suggests taking bart to Montgomery Street
station, then catch the #30 bus at Market and 3rd Streets.

I arrive at SFO at 4:45 on Thursday. (Maybe I&#x27;ll see Craig there.)

I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do the rest of the day/evening. I may just stay
out at the hotel and practice, unless I meet up with others.

Minor correction (spurred on by Tyson&#x27;s &quot;Black Hole&quot;? question, I 
checked my facts).

The area with dark walls and stars was called &quot;Deep Space&quot;, 
not &quot;Black Hole&quot;. Hey, it was almost 20 years and many parties ago - 
my memory can be a little faulty.

Information about EBF (including Deep Space) at: 
www.stanford.edu/group/EBF

see you in SF next week!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ron,

I had no time to take part in the recent discussions, but I would like
to mention two things for the future.

1.) Have a standard for difficulty.
I suggest that once scrambles are randomly generated for a tournament
that they be run through a few cube solvers. This would allow you to
eliminate those scrambles which are too easy.

2.) Please reconsider and change the rule counting slice turns as two
moves. I request that this be changed to counting slice turns as one
move. 

I&#x27;ve always seen each layer as equals, even though a slice turn
doesn&#x27;t move corners. As it is now you are penalising corners first
solvers and others like me who use a lot of slice moves. 

Cheers,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi David,

Thanks for the feedback.
It is better to post your feedback on the WCA forum, because there we can have a better overview of the discussions.

I will put your suggestions on the TODO list for version 2007.

For your suggestion of difficulty it is hard to define difficulty.
If your suggestion is to check for in general at least 18 (or x) moves optimal solution, then this is something we could do. Given a majority.
If your suggestion is to check for easy solutions in CFOP system, then I think it is not a good idea. In that case you are influencing randomness for a specific system.

We have had several discussions about HTM and STM, but there was never a conclusion. Therefore we kept it the way it is now.

Have fun,

Ron

  Hi Ron,

  I had no time to take part in the recent discussions, but I would like
  to mention two things for the future.

  1.) Have a standard for difficulty.
  I suggest that once scrambles are randomly generated for a tournament
  that they be run through a few cube solvers. This would allow you to
  eliminate those scrambles which are too easy.

  2.) Please reconsider and change the rule counting slice turns as two
  moves. I request that this be changed to counting slice turns as one
  move. 

  I&#x27;ve always seen each layer as equals, even though a slice turn
  doesn&#x27;t move corners. As it is now you are penalising corners first
  solvers and others like me who use a lot of slice moves. 

  Cheers,

  David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

On the practical side, it does take at least 30 minutes (depending 
on the computer) to find optimal solution for a given scramble with 
Cube Explorer. It quickly finds 20 or 19 move solution(s) but to 
really find the shortest proven solution takes a good while. So i 
don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s feasible to do this for a high number of scrambles. 
And then again why check this only for 3x3x3? We could check also 
for 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 or square-1 or megaminx ... I think it can be 
seen where im going with this. Im not worried about getting easy 
scrambles at competitions. I do want everyone to get same scrambles 
(possibly with random orientations). That&#x27;s the most feasible option 
as i see it.

(Has anyone really studied how optimal solution length compares 
version scramble length for a large number of random scrambles of 
different lenghths ?? Where do we stop getting &quot;harder&quot; scrambles by 
making them longer?)

About move metric,this is only really interesting for fewest moves. 
And fewest movers have been dictated by Dan Harris (:-P) to follow 
htm for a good while already. I don&#x27;t see any problem with that. 
Those who use inner slice turns heavily will feel punsihed by htm 
andvice versa those who are used to thinking in outer turns only 
will feel that those using inner slice turns a lot are favored by 
stm. So we can&#x27;t satisfy everyone either way.

I see 3 options :
htm - because it&#x27;s simply most common andmaybe the least 
controversial,mathematical basis

stm - from a practical point of view maybe the most correct metric, 
a layer is a layer whether it&#x27;s internal or external

combined metric - a salomonic solution, noone should feel heavily 
favoured or dis-favoured

The latter does most likely require a computer to determine the 
metric,and as discussed in another yahoo group it&#x27;s not immune to 
ambiguity ;-)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,
       It is now official: I can&#x27;t make it to Nationals this year.  Though I really want to, some financial issues are eating me alive this summer...  I can&#x27;t even get a loan to go, since I&#x27;m a full-time student (lame banks).  I&#x27;m still cubing, but I simply don&#x27;t have the transportation/funds.  I considered hitchhiking/bus routes, but I also have classes for the summer at the university, and it would take days for that type of transportation.
       I&#x27;m definately not walking out on the cubing thing.  &quot;I&#x27;ll be back.&quot;
  good luck everyone.  cuberz for life.

          <div class="email-content">No, in some cases (I think yours would apply), you should look 
for &quot;diagonal mirroring&quot;. Although the simple mirroring plus U 
rotations *might* be enough/analgous/equivalent, but I have put 
little thought into this as I am currently on vacation!

As a long time member of this fourm, I&#x27;d like to say that it is very 
good to see another hardcore math/cs person like Bruce here! I&#x27;ve 
been keeping up with his posts on this other fourm he uses too. Very 
techincal stuff that I once wanted to see here, but after further 
thought, it just wouldn&#x27;t fit here. I was always the one rushing to 
answer math questions, but I wasn&#x27;t particularly patient in the past :
(.

I can try a verification of his computation when I get the chance. It 
is most challenging :).

          <div class="email-content">Good tip, but failing that, do bring a print out of your e-mail 
registration confirmation in order to exploit their half price 
admission offer. I made a reminder a few weeks ago, but even I nearly 
forgot about it when I was packing.

Anyhow, SanF is *amazing*. It&#x27;s my first time here. However, it&#x27;s 
rather crowded downtown between 11am to 7pm for my taste. I guess I 
don&#x27;t look forward to a dense city as much as I would if I wasn&#x27;t 
from a dense city myself. Still the archetcture, landscape, and 
diversity here is great. Just becareful of getting mugged (this 
comming form a person who frequents downtowns of Toronto, Detroit, 
and New York). I really didn&#x27;t think it would be as bad, but I was 
walking around at 1-2am and it got a bit scary. Do avoid Civc Center 
area, as I was later warned by hotel front desk, lol.

Also if you are a big academic freak, then do visit BerkeleyU. It&#x27;s 
one of the top 3 when it comes to most branches of mathematics. The 
nieghborhod is reminicent of AA, so it was right up my alley; felt at 
home :). Hem, makes me want to plaster that campus with tournament 
flyers, cuz I bet we could&#x27;ve gotten +20 audience that way.

Have a safe trip. BTW, your ears might pop riding the subway here... 
BART takes you everywhere, it&#x27;s very convienient. Well the 
Exploratorium is requires a 15 minute cab ride though (form the 
hotels I suspect you will likely be at).

Also, when/where will Mr. Cubesmith be?

Hem, Atante has several computers for internet access, but they 
charge me a little... o_O

          <div class="email-content">Thanks, I&#x27;m sure the number that he got is correct or at least very 
close and I&#x27;m sure that the amount of cases is at least 100.  I can&#x27;t 
learn that many because the other steps in what I&#x27;m doing require 
algorithms to be learned.

I&#x27;m glad you and Bruce are around.  It has made things a lot easier.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug,

The problem with the bright stickers the cubes come with is the edges
are cut at 90 degrees vertically. If they were cut at an angle then
they wouldn&#x27;t catch fingertips like they do now. 

I changed how I handled a cube so that my fingertips didn&#x27;t catch the
edges and even with daily usage the stickers lasted a little over a
year before they began to look raggedy.

Cheers,

David J

If your suggestion is to check for in general at least 18 (or x) moves
optimal solution, then this is something we could do. 

That&#x27;s what I meant. 

I mislaid the URL for the WCA.

Concerning HTM and STM, Please reach a conclusion in favor of STM. :)

Thanks,

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

Thanks for the info, as I am unfamiliar with Cube explorer.

I think that you don&#x27;t have to start the night before the contest to
test scrambles, couldn&#x27;t this be started months in advance. 

You don&#x27;t have to only use one computer to test scrambles.

If Cube Explorer can quickly come up with a ballpark figure for
difficulty then that might be adequate. Can it? I mean if the optimum
solution is 18 moves, would the &quot;quick and dirty&quot; solution be 20
moves? If the optimum solution is 12 moves would the quick and dirty
sollution be 15 or 16? So my question is how consistent is the program?

Perhaps Cube explorer could be used to determine wheter a particular
scramble would favor HTM or STM.

Cheers,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

This is about my 4x4x4 solver program that determines a solution for a
scrambled cube in no more than 79 slice turns.

Thanks to David for being willing to help. I haven&#x27;t used Bittorrent
myself. In saying that you would host a tracker file, does that mean
you would store the files somewhere that would allow Bittorrent
to be transfer the files to others, or are you assuming they would be
stored by some other file hosting site (that your &quot;tracker file&quot; would
merely be referencing)? 

I now have a version of the solver that may be usable by others. I
added the ability to specify facelet pattern and to specify the
location of the data files. I also eliminated a couple of large arrays
to reduce the amount of memory it uses. Its arrays now use up about
225 megabytes.

Anyways my plan at the moment is to make a few copies on DVD discs
tonight, and bring them to U.S. Nationals for people who will be there
and are interested in it. I may only have about a half-dozen copies
with me. If someone is there who is willing to host the files, that
would be great. Otherwise, I will probably figure out some way to make
them downloadable after returning from U.S. Nationals. If people out
there do not feel downloading is reasonable, I guess they can email me
and we can work something out. I also may create programs allowing the
user to generate the files, if I feel there is sufficient interest in
that alternative.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

While optimal solvers (for 3x3x3) can take a long time to find the
solution for a deep position, they can determine if a position is
within 15 moves (HTM, aka FTM) of solved pretty fast, I believe. That
may be good enough. As they are, they won&#x27;t automatically stop after a
certain depth, as far as I know. By the way, I believe Cube Explorer
only does HTM metric (but I don&#x27;t have the latest version).  Mike
Reid&#x27;s optimal solver can be compiled to do either QTM or HTM. It&#x27;s
not clear to me if you can estimate the optimal length very well based
on a sub-optimal solver&#x27;s solution length.

I think the issue of &quot;scramble quality&quot; is more important on the
2x2x2. With less than 4 million positions, I think easy scrambles are
likely to come up once in awhile, if there isn&#x27;t something in place to
prevent them. There is almost a third of one percent chance of a
randomly chosen position to be depth five or less (HTM). I was in the
room when the current WR 2x2x2 solve occurred. I don&#x27;t know what the
scramble was for that solve, though, although I assume I also had to
solve the same scramble.

  One-handed cubing is a lot of fun
   
  my best avg is 26.07s, with a PB of 20.37s (almost sub-20 : ) )
   
  my next goal is to make a sub-26 avg, but that is very hard...still don&#x27;t know how Ryan does 24.xx avgs...haha

the layer are solid, i.e. correct edges). You have either no correct 
edges, one correct edge, or all correct edges. If you have none, just 
swap two diagonal corners. If you have one correct edge, swap the two 
adjacent corners across from it. That&#x27;s it. By the way, when doing the 
second layer the same way, remember that in 2*2*2 speak, a double 
parallel swap is equivalent in effect to a diagonal swap, and a 3-
cycle is equivalent to an adjacent swap.

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys, I was wondering if it would be possible to create a cube 
explorer like program that will solve cubes with undefined points in 
the configuration, yet it can still identify isomorphic combinations!

That would be awsome.

Also, If you create a static reference, the cases are reduced 
significantly, I just compiled 132 roux 2nd Block cases.  Yes, roux 
is supposed to be intuitive.  But, there are just hard cases, 
especially to do using the URM subset.  All the cases I generated 
did this, =D very nice.

Anyway, Figure out what is isomorphic (any cube state with the same 
moves whether inversed, reflected, or applied from a different angle)
Since we don&#x27;t have a good hybrid of ACube and CubeExplorer, just go 
over the tables you&#x27;ve generated and recognize the cases for 
yourself.

Btw, the benifit to 2-gen F2B in roux is that you can identify the 
CMLL permutation case while permuting the last C/E pair.

Also I&#x27;m curious what is your method for?  What do the steps involve?

I&#x27;ve worked with the Acube a lot lately, generating everything from 
my new BLD algs for a new method, getting faster btw at execution.  
Not too far from my goal.  Anyway, BLD algs, Roux F2B algs, a set of 
24 algs that would permute the corners and orient edges on 4th c/e 
pair insertion.

The roux algs are by far the biggest group, my BLD algs are the 
deepest, and the C/E pair (Permute/Orient) algs.

Like I said have a reference point, such as in F2L algs, you align 
the Corner above the C/E slot to recognize the case.

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s aal about practice, is everthing else. Right now I&#x27;m timing 30-50
OH solves per day and do some more without timing. I pracice only LL
quite a lot to get the triggers faster. A have averaged LL in 11.75
seconds one-handed, which I think is quite good. Now I have to imporve
F2L to get even better times.

Your average is so great. How fast is your F2L and LL on  average for
OH solving?

My best time so far is 23.94 (the 22.81 in my avg. was with a
PLL-skip). I&#x27;m hoping to get more times around 25 seconds in a near
future, and hopefully lowering my single record a few seconds.

I&#x27;m also on my way to sub30...I averaged around 31 (using only my watch as
timer) today.
There will be some nice competition at the European Championship :-)

See you !

I&#x27;m looking forward to the one-handed event at EC. There are so many
great OH solvers in Europe now.  Me, You, Marc van Beest, Anssi
Vanhala, Joël van Noort and more. Some people may be training secretly
too, so we don&#x27;t now how good they are. 

I want it to be EC now, I can&#x27;t wait two months!!!!! :-)

Thom didn&#x27;t believe me when I said God&#x27;s Algorithm for 4x4 should be 
around 60 moves. It&#x27;s probably even less.

          <div class="email-content">Yea, understanding recognition gave me some problems, I&#x27;m actually 
going to look into recognizing by configuration case of the L/R 
faces, as suggested on Gilles Roux&#x27;s site.

I&#x27;m taking on learning a large system for roux, I&#x27;m so sick of my 
horrible last layer, and roux has been a big inerest to me.

Good luck in learning C*LL, if I can get CMLL fast, I may go back to 
learning COLL.

An intersting thing is that my algs that I&#x27;m generating for roux are 
2-gen, which can possibly allow you to recognize the permutaiton 
case for C*LL while solving the last C/E pair, the great thing about 
roux, is that with each step you are able to look ahead to the next!
Block 2 - CMLL using 2 gen, you can recognize the Perm case
CMLL - LSE you can recognize orienation

Sorry, to hear the you have preblems with your hands. Can&#x27;t you cube
att all with your hands or is it just one-handed that is the problem??
I hope you will be able to start cubing again, you have such a great
talent for cubing. Your times with feet are goetting even crazier I
see. :-)

I think you should take a rest.
That&#x27;s what I did last week, I just stopped speedcubing because I had a very
hard cubing month of July (if I can say so :p). However I learned a few
algorithms for blindfolded and one-handed.
But nothing that requires more than 10 solves a day.

You could also try some cream for your mussles and/or articulations.
It helps !

As for my training for one handed (I want to be the EC too :p), I made a
full table of all cases for LL (OLL and PLL, not LL in one alg :D - I am not
yet that crazy) and I work on every single case to be able to solve it sub5.
(I realized that I could solve F2L in 15 seconds on average, but then a 15
or even 20 seconds LL just killed all my times. So a 10 second last layer is
a totally reachable goal.)

Anyway, the Polish Open will be a good test just one-week before the EC to
determine how my level will be (there will be less pressure though).

Cube well !
Gilles.

It seems like a good technique to try to get all cases below a certain
limit. I now some of my LL moves are very slow one-handed while some I
can do in three seconds. I&#x27;m gonna do that myself, in continue to also
take averages of LL. For now my goal is to get sub-11 on average for
LL, but it is F2L I have to work on the most.

What do you mean?  All I&#x27;ve seen on the site is pictures showing that 
a certain side needs to be switched.  How is that a way to recognize 
the algorithm needed?  When you first look at the cube when you have 
that case you don&#x27;t see that a side needs to be switched so what do 
you do?  Sorry, someone else told me that they do it the way on the 
site, I just don&#x27;t see any description on his site of how to do it, 
just pictures.

I was using Roux a month ago.  I got down to 22 seconds but I&#x27;ve 
stopped to work on something of my own.  His method is a very good 
one so stick with it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

on my site i&#x27;ve written all COLL for the roux method. There you will see,
which peace of the corner i look for to take the right COLL.

You will find it on: Gilles Roux method, at the bottom there is a link for
the CMLL.

The notation i take is described on &quot;NOTATION&quot;, first have a look there.

Hope you &#x27;ll understand it (its in german)

What do you mean? All I&#x27;ve seen on the site is pictures showing that 
a certain side needs to be switched. How is that a way to recognize 
the algorithm needed? When you first look at the cube when you have 
that case you don&#x27;t see that a side needs to be switched so what do 
you do? Sorry, someone else told me that they do it the way on the 
site, I just don&#x27;t see any description on his site of how to do it, 
just pictures.

I was using Roux a month ago. I got down to 22 seconds but I&#x27;ve 
stopped to work on something of my own. His method is a very good 
one so stick with it.

Yesterday I sent a 31.40 average to speedcubing.com but then I worked on a
few OLL cases and today I did a magical 30.58 average.

Average: 30.58 seconds
Individual Times: 32.95, 28.22, (26.94), 33.87, (40.62), 30.52, 27.56, 31.43,
29.15, 32.59, 31.67, 27.83

There are now 29 / 57 OLL cases I can solve sub5.
I haven&#x27;t timed my PLLs yet but I know all my G-Perms, 3 corners/edges cyles
and N, L and J perms are quite fast.

If you want I can post my pages of OLL and PLL cases so that when you can
solve one at your desired speed, you can make a cross on it. :D (It is very
motivating to see the number of cases you do not know diminishing day after
day.)

Would you like it ?

Bye bye !
Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Hi, Gilles!!

Congratulations for your nice average. You&#x27;ll get a sub-30 average any
day now.

I started taking averages for every OLL- and PLL-case yesterday, and I
sort them in excel, to see which cases I need to work on. My fastest
PLL-case so far is the counter-clockwise corner 3-cycle, on which I
have averaged 3.57 OH. My fastest attempt was 2.87.

I already have pages with OLL- abd PLL-cases to fill in times in, but
thanks anyway.

/Gunnar

Bad bad bad news ... My 2 best 5x5x5 cubes are broken. On one <br>

snapped and the cube literally exploded in my face. This is so sad :-o <br>
I soon need to start practising seriously for Paris and a 5x5x5 takes <br>
almost forever to break in. Im not sure what to do now. I have one <br>
more 5x5x5 i might try to fix by tightening the rivets. I also have <br>
really bad 4x4x4&#x27;s that are far too loose. My only good cube is my diy <br>

          <div class="email-content">Since competitive cubing is not so big in Australia and some other parts<br>
of the world, I decided to write this cube battle game. It allows you to<br>
have head-to-head cube battles with other people using 3D virtual cubes<br>
across the Internet.<br>
<br>
It has a rating system similar to online chess servers, and keeps track<br>
of other statistics such as your running average and your best time.<br>
<br>
It also allows you to watch other head-to-head battles currently being<br>
played:<br>
<br>
    http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/speed/<br>
<br>
There are currently 46 registered uses with 2632 battles played so far,<br>
for the two weeks that it has been running.<br>
<br>
The keyboard control is the same as the Rubik&#x27;s Cube Simulator:<br>
<br>
    http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/speed.html<br>
<br>
The underlying cube applet is the same, except that the multiplayer<br>
version allows you to save your preferred colour scheme.<br>
<br>
Note that it&#x27;s still BETA software and still has bugs :-) Sometimes it<br>
fails to detect when your opponent finishes solving and will wait<br>
forever, unless you reload the page. But for the most part, it seems to<br>
work quite well.<br>

U didn&#x27;t read properly what was broken on my 2 cubes ;-) In both 
cases it is parts of the core that is broken. I actually have plenty 
of normal spare parts both for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes :-) If 
cubesmith really is selling 5x5x5 cores that&#x27;s new information for 
me.

Hmm ...

Actually I have a spare-parts 5x5x5 cube.
Maybe I could sell you the core center if you are interested.
But I have no idea of the shipping costs.

Would you like me to take some information ?

          <div class="email-content">So, there were 8 WRs broken OFFICIALLY and about 50 unofficial ones<br>
were broken  over the weekend.  There are only 7 on speedcubing.com<br>
and one of them is wrong too.  The WRs are:<br>
<br>
Toby Mao 3x3x3 10.48 - 56 Moves, about 5.5 moves per second, he<br>
remembers the solution, and they have the scramble<br>
<br>
Ryan Patricio 3x3x3 OH Average of 5 24.03 - 27.09 23.17	24.81 21.19 24.11<br>
<br>
Frank Morris 5x5x5 Average of 5 1:58.66 - 2:00.23 1:47.40 2:10.01<br>
1:59.53 1:56.23    He is amazing to watch, and was .07 off the world<br>
record with the 1:47.40<br>
<br>
Chris Hardwick 5x5x5 BLD 28:28.22 - This is amazing to watch<br>
<br>
Chris Hardwick 4x4x4 BLD 12:11.xx (not posted anywhere yet)<br>
<br>
Craig Bouchard Magic Single Solve 1.07 - I was mad, because both<br>
rounds I could have easily had the average WR but I threw it away.<br>
<br>
Bob Burton Magic Average of 5 1.34 - 1.42 1.21 1.35 1.81 1.26<br>
<br>
Craig Bouchard Master Magic Single Solve 2.73 - Again, could have had<br>
the average WR in the first round, but I completely blew the last solve.<br>
<br>
Someone has each of these records on video somewhere.  A lot of people<br>
were recording throughout the weekend.<br>
<br>
Also, something that made this event really interesting was Tyson&#x27;s<br>
idea of the &quot;Mystery Puzzles&quot;  Tyson (maybe) will explain more if<br>
everyone is interested on how all the technicallities of it worked. <br>
Basically, if your name was called, you&#x27;d go up on stage and compete<br>
against the other teams, and depending who won, different things would<br>
happen.  They made up the most random things, but they were very fun.<br>
 I also found out that no one on the Caltech Crew has any respect for<br>
the magic, AT ALL.  Anyways, I am thinking of writing my first report<br>
ever, because this competition was AWESOME.  As I told Tyson last<br>
night at Clancy&#x27;s, I think the competition went really smoothly and<br>
effectively, and I had a lot of fun, and it appeared as though<br>
everyone else did too.<br>
<br>
Alright peace,<br>

It is posted on the results page as of this morning.  My bad, I didn&#x27;t 
catch it, I was already impressed with the first attempt.  Chris H. 
definitely rocked!  Anyway, all 8 records are shown on the results 
page now.

I have been working on my new website however, which I made public<br>

would check it out, and sign my guestbook if you want to :)<br>

I promise to be around more in the future, I miss you all!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

I loaded my solver program and data files (uncompressing them) onto
Bob Burton&#x27;s laptop. Doug Li also got one of my DVD&#x27;s and said he
could host the files. But I am not sure when he returns home. I think
he was staying at least an extra day.

I also gave it to someone else named Bill who told me he tried it, but
had trouble inputting a facelet pattern correctly. I tried to explain
to him what the program expected for the input, so hopefully he now
has successfully run it. I&#x27;ll have to write up some more documentation
on how to run the program. BTW, the program also accepts a scramble
string, or can do randomly generated scrambles.

In Opera and Firefox the video gets displayed very small (like 
150x106), can you fix this? Only after downloading it I saw it&#x27;s 
actually 640x480.

          <div class="email-content">Yes I noticed that, too.  I will check into that.  It does render 
correctly in Internet Explorer.  The size is actually not specified 
anywhere in the HTML.  Instead it is relying on the &quot;AutoSize&quot; 
parameter being set to 1.  So for whatever reason Firefox is not 
respecting that parameter.

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

I am sorry about people apparently getting a virus infection from
attempting to download my video.  I will say that I tried the link
myself just to test the link before posting my message, and I have not
seen any symptoms of virus infection on my computer. As far as I know,
MPEG files are considered &quot;safe&quot; and so it sounds to me like this
virus infection is related to a script on the web site, not my file,
and must have occurred after I posted my message. It may be useful to
know what virus this is, or what malicious files or processes may be
created.

In any case, I have generated a different MPEG file using a different
program from my same video tape.
This is an MPEG1 rather than MPEG2. I have uploaded to a different
file-hosting site. I guess I will stop using ez-files.net, as this is
the 2nd time I have had issues with this site, though the other time
it was not virus related. For those who are daring enough to try this
copy, the link is:

http://tinyurl.com/z577o

I could delete my old file from ez-files.net, but I don&#x27;t know if that
would protect users using that link from the other post.

No, I usually do them in a row, only interrupted by writing down the 
result and scrambling again. Except for DNF, then I try to analyze 
what went wrong. But after a success, I just continue.

PDF is good (or not?). And it was the easiest way for me to get two 
pages. I really wanted two because that saves trees. Plus I have a 
printing quota and our printers can&#x27;t count pages correctly so 1 page 
costs the same as 2 pages on one sheet.

Also, I was interested how to generate PDF with PHP. I used FPDF:
http://www.fpdf.org/

  I think it&#x27;s important to let your mind &quot;take a little rest&quot; before another attempt
   
  one thing I like to do is practice OH and BLD at the same time...like...I do 2 or 3 one-handed solves, then a BLD one, then more oh, then more BLD...

You do realize you&#x27;re like twice as fast as me, right?
So maybe *I* am doing it wrong...

I am sorry about people apparently getting a virus infection from
attempting to download my video.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Bruce  it&#x27;s ok, I don&#x27;t blame you. I guess we&#x27;ve all just learned a lesson about the internet. 
My experience was exactly like that described by CornMeow in another message.  I was 
anxious to see the video. At about the time it finished downloading, my screen exploded 
with pop-ups, dialogue boxes, and MS-DOS commandline windows. My taskbar 
disappeared too. I quickly turned my computer off. On restarting my computer, it would 
no longer boot up. I did some research and learned how to repair the master boot record. 
It would now boot up, but was getting pop-up ads and other random slowness every few 
minutes.

I&#x27;ve gone through several rounds of running Symantec Anti-Virus, Spybot, and MS 
Windows Defender beta. All of these programs find and destroy a variety of things 
identified as &quot;viruses&quot; and &quot;trojan horses&quot;.  But somehow, the pop-ups seem to keep 
coming and new viruses/trojans  make their way onto the computer. There have been 
MANY of these identified and include names such as Tagasaurs, Webhancer, and Project1. 
This is on a computer that has run for nearly 2 years in which I&#x27;ve never caught any viruses 
or adware yet. I keep up with Windows updates and scan frequently with Spybot and 
Symantec. This really bothers me because I had thought I had been doing all of the right 
things to avoid this sort of problem in the first place.  (Except I now wish I had been using 
Firefox.)

CornMeow  
I have been fighting this thing all day, and still haven&#x27;t defeated it. Do you have any advice 
on what you managed to do to remove this thing?

          <div class="email-content">I second that &quot;no worries Bruce&quot; as no one could have possibly 
guessed that ezfiles was a virus hotel.  I&#x27;m sure this was just a 
stroke of very bad luck.

Ryan: here&#x27;s what I did.  unfortunately it is kind of long and random 
but I hope some of it will help.  It assumes you have a spare 
workstation to connect to the internet (since you&#x27;re posting, that&#x27;s 
a good sign) and a CD writer or flash drive to transfer files.

- start windows in safe mode + command prompt
- hit ctrl-alt-del and open task manager
- go to file, run and then &quot;msconfig&quot;
- look at the startup tab and note all the garbage that is in there.  
uncheck what you can, although this may not make a difference.
- keep the msconfig open
- now, go to task manager again, file-run.  you can now start 
browsing directories that appear to contain spyware files, using the 
msconfig list as a guide.  then you can select and delete them.
- still using taskmanager-file-run, try to go into your windows and 
windows\system32 directories.  delete as much as you can that looks 
suspicious.  on your spare workstation, google as many weird 
sounding .exe files as you can find, and delete anything that you 
know is bad.
- try running spybot and adaware from task manager.  unfortunately 
you won&#x27;t be able to update since your pc won&#x27;t be connected.  let 
them do their thing.
- try to restart as normal.  you may have to shut your pc off 
manually, I did.
- hopefully by now you will be able to run spybot normally and maybe 
even update.  do so.  you might still get some popups, ugh
- there are two tricky ones that don&#x27;t quite go away.
* one is &quot;smitfraud.c&quot; for which you need something called 
smitfraudfix - check google for it
* the other is webhancer.  if you find you can&#x27;t connect to internet 
from your main pc, you may have to track down something 
called &quot;webhancer companion,&quot; install it on your pc and then 
uninstall using control panel.  pain
- so from here, just keep running spybot &amp; adaware until things come 
out clean.  you may have to keep googling to research any weird ones 
that just keep coming back.

Good luck, and let me know if you need any more tips.

Well, the book is published near the beginning of the year, then, 
because it must be in between the caltech competition and svekub one.
They should have the 24hr marathon in there, though.

     Firstly, I&#x27;d like to congradulate all of the world record
breakers and winners at US nationals.  It seems that at every
competition, there is a higher standard than before.  Does anyone know
if the 3x3x3 speedsolving WR was a PLL or OLL skip?  It didn&#x27;t seem
like it based on the videos, but still, 10.48 seconds...  Also, does
anyone have a video of when my 4x4x4 exploded in a solve.  It was on
Saturday, in the 4x4x4 preliminary event.  Anyway, the event was a lot
of fun and went very very smoothly with very few if any mishaps.  Hats
off to the Caltech crew.

The exploratorium didn&#x27;t want to go too media crazy on this one because 
they wanted to preserve their January event for the media hype.  Oh 
well... it&#x27;s better in their interest, but not in ours.  Obviously, the 
US National competition is a bigger deal to us.

  I can explain the lack of media.<br>
<br>
  The exploratorium didn&#x27;t want to go too media crazy on this one because <br>
  they wanted to preserve their January event for the media hype. Oh <br>
  well... it&#x27;s better in their interest, but not in ours. Obviously, the <br>
  US National competition is a bigger deal to us.<br>

                           So, in US champinoship 29.78 solve was enough for semifinal and 19.37
 average for final and 15.50 for winning. Will that be enough in EC? At
 least I don&#x27;t think so. Hopefully I don&#x27;t get french nerves there...

forget Thom Barlow. (You are coming to Paris, right?) Then there are
the french guys and Anssi has a great average too. I&#x27;m really looking
forward to this competition. It will be my first big championship and
the competition will be harder then ever, which only makes it more fun.

During the US Nationals, several of us were predicting what we thought 
the cut-off times would be to advance in each round of the 3x3x3. 

The consensus was 25 seconds to advance from qualifying to semifinal 
round, and 19-20 seconds to advance from semfinal to finals.

That was pretty much the result, and with a few more high-profile 
people that were missing it would have definitely been the result. Out 
of the 36 that advanced to semifinals, 33 were at 25 seconds or less.

At EC, I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;d be about the same, if EC has a similar turnout 
and format. It will be interesting to see.

Good luck to all!

          <div class="email-content">Yes, that was the actual solution as recalled from memory by Toby.  
Sorry if I didn&#x27;t make that more clear on the video.

I tried the scramble at home before I had Toby&#x27;s solution, and later 
learned he did the same cross as me (I guess it was fairly 
straightforward).  However, the solution was quite different from 
there since he does cross on left.  And his U-perm at the end is so 
fast!  I can&#x27;t begin to do one that quickly (even though I use the 
same alg).  How in the world is that accomplished?

          <div class="email-content">CornMeow 

I cannot thank you enough for taking the time to type up the 
detailed instructions that you did. I too had been performing 
similar repeated research and actions  only to have problems keep 
reappearing. I followed your steps and that seems to have done the 
trick. (Particularly the &quot;Webhancer&quot; part.)  I learned a lot from 
your advice. I&#x27;m a computer programmer, but I&#x27;ve never really been a 
Windows troubleshooting guy. Whatever got on my machine seemed to 
take a brute force approach of repeatedly installing MANY unique 
viruses/adware all over the place. I cannot imagine what a non-techy 
would have done if their machine had been infected with this. 
Luckily I had another workstation available nearby to research with 
and download things. Ultimately I blew an incredible amount of time 
tackling this  probably 6 to 8 hours. After this, I am DONE with 
Microsoft Windows. My next computer will be a Mac.

Thanks again -

          <div class="email-content">man i am tired of hearing about this.  i don&#x27;t think it will be any different than the us nationals, because guess what, euro cubers are not better than american cubers, we are all the same.  u have your key players and some people that arent as fast, so i think getting up on a pedestal and talking about how the ec&#x27;s are going to be sooo much harder is a bunch of narcissistic bs.  when i look at the 2004 stats they are very close to each other, within a second or 2 of each other for each round&#x27;s advancement. and while i&#x27;m ranting i also think its crap that ec&#x27;s are closed.  we over here were nice enough to allow anyone to compete in the US nationals, so i don&#x27;t know why the euro&#x27;s and some other events over there have to be closed, seems kind of selfish to me.  maybe some are just scared an american will come win 1st place or something.  so in conclusion, quiet with the euro cubers are better crap, and let&#x27;s try and be fair to each other with open tournaments for all.

          <div class="email-content">Hi there,<br>
<br>
Questions, questions, questions....<br>
How easy (or difficult) is to find studio cubes in Hungary? I know someone<br>
that&#x27;s going to Hungary this weekend and I would like to take the<br>
opportunity to order some stuff.<br>
Does anybody know any stores where she can find studio cubes?<br>
Do they still come in those blue paper boxes?<br>
<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

          <div class="email-content">I tink you&#x27;re right. I said that i expect a very fast time at the ec but i didn&#x27;t say that Euro cubers are faster then US cubers. And you&#x27;re also right about the closed Championships. I think it&#x27;s a pitty that you don&#x27;t support people who are motivated enough to travel all the way to paris from who knows where. And it&#x27;s also more amusing to meet as many cubers possible. For europian cubers and vice versa, the word champs are almost the only possiblility to meet other then europina cubers. Thats to bad. I&#x27;d really love to see those worldrecord holders of the US cube. It must be cool.

So I think, listening to this complain, the EC organisation has to improve his format before the next (2008?) is held.

 With same format it could be something like 21-23 for semifinal, 16-17
  for final and sub-15 for winning.

Congratulations on the World Record.  Not to detract from the record
itself, but my favorite part of the video has to be at the very end
when you totally hip check an innocent bystander during your
celebration.  It is priceless; I keep watching that part in slow
motion. It is like a car accident. Leave it to a Canadian to
incorporate body contact into a World Record celebration.  I guess we
should just be glad he didn&#x27;t have a hockey stick in his hand.

<br>
I took the liberty to make an excel document which gives the people<br>
from 1st-8th points based on rank, and then whoever has the highest<br>
total points is the winner.<br>
<br>
I split it up into 3 different categories.<br>
<br>
Speedcubing - 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5 <br>
<br>
Cubing - Above + 3x3 OH, 3x3 BLD, 4x4 BLD and 5x5 BLD<br>
<br>
Puzzler - All of the above + Magic, Master Magic, Megaminx, and Square-1<br>
<br>
1st place got 8 points, 2nd 7 points, and so on until 8th place got 1<br>
point.  If you are interested check it out.<br>
<br>
Chris Hardwick ended up being Top Puzzler, coming top 6 in all of the<br>
events he competed in, earning him a total of 61 points.<br>

I was recording Chris Hardwick&#x27;s WR 5x5x5 BLD during the Preliminary
Master Magic competition, so I didn&#x27;t get any video of that round,
except I did get one attempt by Tim Reynolds. I was recording when the
announcer announced Bob Burton got an American record.

I do have some video of the Finals of the Master Magic, and also of
the regular Magic Preliminary on Friday.

as for me, ive bought a total of three cubes two of them costing 5 <br>
dollars each at the store and one DIY cube from the Rubiks website <br>
costing around 18 dollars (including shipping) if i recall. so for me <br>
i&#x27;ve only spent about a total of 28 bucks but how much have you guys <br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve given this a fair amount of thought.  They make tiny LED&#x27;s that 
have the three colors.  You could drill small holes in the center of 
each square and put the LED there, covered by a white translucent 
tile.  That way the LED would illuminate the whole tile.  The main 
problem is powering everything.  Putting a battery inside each cubie 
would make the cube very heavy and a pain to turn on/off or change 
batteries.  A battery inside each center seems more logical, but 
finding a way to distribute that power to adjacent cubies is tricky.  
You want the cube to stay illuminated even in mid-twist (for cubing in 
the dark!)  This project might be easier with a jumbo cube, bud I&#x27;d 
like to have a standard-sized one.

          <div class="email-content">preach on, maybe a little more eloquent than my statement but true none the less.  i think its ridiculous to not allow anyone and everyone that wants to compete in a competition, espeicially based on stuff stuff as geographical location.  if we base stuff on geographical location how different is that then segregation by race, age, sex, etc....
i guess i just feel stronger about this issue than most, but it does really bug me.  if i was in europe and there was a competition, i would be most upset if i wasn&#x27;t allowed to compete, the format here was titles were only open to us residents, but all were allowed to compete and place, and that&#x27;s about as far as you can be keeping the &#x27;national&#x27; aspect alive.

Yeah, and it&#x27;s even worse. To be a little more precise, it&#x27;s more like 
your geographical location AT THE TIME OF YOUR BIRTH.

Imagine an American citizen living in Paris right next to the Euro2006 
venue... can&#x27;t compete. But the French citizen living in USA? Sure he 
can.

Why Israel, and not the US for example? Israel&#x27;s part of Asia. Which 
reminds me, we should have an open Asian championship.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah there are messages dating back to 1981 on the old cube-lovers 
mailing list talking about this stuff.  Obviously it&#x27;s not too easy 
since the concept has been around that long yet we haven&#x27;t seen it 
come to fruition.

I too have the electronic Platypus (originally Jackpot, also known 
as Tripod) that lights up when you solve it.  I haven&#x27;t taken it 
apart to replace the batteries yet but I&#x27;ll study the circuitry when 
I do.

For starters, I&#x27;d just be happy with a regular-size 3x3x3 cube that 
was LED-illuminated and remained continuously illuminated as you 
twist it.  Once that has been achieved, then the next step would be 
to add the fancy stuff like instant solve/scramble, etc. (things 
requiring actual logic circuits and sensors).

Is it a coincidence you mention this song a few days after I learned 
about it or do you read SWIFT, too?

http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-07/072806academic.html#i5

Went to youtube and of course found it:
http://youtube.com/watch?v=zj8LR25HeJA

I did know the song but not the lyrics (have a hard enough time caring 
for lyrics of German songs). Yes, immediately became one of my 
favourite songs now.

Cheers!
Stefan

Hmm, thought I wrote something about this on the WCA forum but can&#x27;t 
find it. Anyway... I think that&#x27;s very different.

I do *somewhat* understand *some* closed competitions, like if you 
have a cube club in your school and you want to have a competition 
among members only. I do see that you&#x27;d want to match with those 
people you&#x27;re meeting in the club all the time. So that&#x27;s what makes 
it more &quot;natural&quot;, somehow an extended sibling rivalry.

National competitions however do not have this property. Whether I 
compete in the German Nationals against a German cuber nobody ever 
heard of before or a non-German cuber nobody ever heard of before, 
doesn&#x27;t matter I think.

How large is your village?

Uh, and I still think it would be nice to let everyone compete even in 
your cube club competition. If another cuber is living nearby, why not 
let him join the fun? After all, how many elite cubers do you expect 
to live nearby? And how many from far away... well if your club has 
very good cubers, then there&#x27;s no need to fear others and it could 
make it more interesting. And if your club has no good cubers, why 
would an elite cuber from far away bother to travel to you anyway?

How about making all closed competitions non-official?

Cheers!

Oh yes yes yes, please Germany, too. I&#x27;d have the Hessian 3x3 record 
and thus could finally feel like I&#x27;ve achieved something (in that 
category). Hey why not go further and have town records, then almost

  How large is your village?

  It consists of 17 houses. My toughest rival is one year older than me and dying in lung emphysema (smoking). The youngsters here know only war games on internet. 

  Just now  the EC in athletics is going on in Gothenburg. Could you guess how many participants there are from USA? And some time ago there was EC in swimming. The same question there. UEFA and others arrange all these cups in soccer. They don´t invite e.g. Brazilian teams to participate. USA arranges there nationals in athletcis (or how it´s called) and so on and and I hardly believe that a German - even living in New York - has the right to participate. But correct me, correct me, I may be wrong!

  Now, if such established associations can - and apparently, without disgrace - arrange such great closed tournaments, why then can´t a tiny little cube society follow there example without being met with derisive comments?




  How about making all closed competitions non-official?

  It´s a way to punish them. Cubists (maybe not you) are spurred by the chance of setting (official) records and go that chance, the motivation to participate will fall.

Anssi you solve faster with your feet than most do here (Shanghai) 
with their hands... Then again, none of them use a speedsolve method 
like Fridrich, Petrus, or Roux; they all use a very bland LBL...

Yes, and them being &quot;established&quot; is exactly their problem. But we as 
a relatively new community have the chance to do things better. Just 
because people commonly thought for quite a while that slavery is ok, 
was it wrong for some to disagree and do something against it?

Also, maybe they´re doing it for practicality reasons, maybe an open 
swimming competition would be too big for them to handle. They´d maybe 
have to say something like &quot;we accept 32 fastest who register&quot; and 
then that´s only &quot;nonlocal&quot; swimmers and they don´t like that and 
instead of some artificial quota even I would prefer to say &quot;all or 
none&quot; which leaves only &quot;none&quot;. Anyway, we´re still small and that 
doesn´t seem to be a problem for us yet.

Well yeah, so just make the competition open. Seriously, what cubing 
competition benefits from being closed?

No, you&#x27;re not the only one, but would a 6x6x6 be powerful enough for 
a name like Chuck Norris? I&#x27;m sure that even with a 6x6x6, he could 
eat a scambled one and crap it out solved in less than an hour. If 
you&#x27;re going to name a cube after him, you should give him something 
that he&#x27;ll find a REAL challenge. ;-) OK... assuming that these things 
are indeed real, and assuming that these things are indeed going to be 
released at some as yet unknown time, I&#x27;d say that the 11x11x11 would 
have to be called Olympus Mons... home of the ancient gods, and 
currently the highest known peak in the solar system, unless there&#x27;s 
been a recent change that I&#x27;m unaware of (eg. the discovery of at 
least 14 new planets, including Quaoar, Sedna and Xena). L8r.

          <div class="email-content">A few days after Nationals, I was in my hotel room practicing with the <br>
stackmat, and I ran into a bit of trouble with my Stackmat (Gen 2).  <br>
Usually when I&#x27;m about to solve, I hold my hands on the timer longer <br>
than needed, just to get my head in the zone and whatnot.  My <br>
Stackmat&#x27;s not letting me do that--about a second after the green <br>
light goes on, it goes crazy.  It displays &quot;000000&quot; then &quot;111111&quot; <br>
then &quot;222222&quot; etc., then &quot;------&quot; then &quot;______&quot; and so on, and then <br>
goes back to &quot;000000&quot; and repeats indefinately.  While it&#x27;s doing <br>
this, you can&#x27;t turn it off or stop it with the handpads, you can <br>
reset it though.  After playing with it for a while (taking batteries <br>
out for a while, leaving off for a while, etc.), I figured I should <br>
just buy a new one.<br>
<br>
Problem.  It seems that now you can only buy stackmats as a set, and <br>
that includes timer, mat, cups, cup bag, and DVD.  I already have cups <br>
and really don&#x27;t need a second set since I barely use the first.  I <br>
really just want a timer, and I don&#x27;t want to pay $40 so I can get a <br>
whole new set of stuff!  Is there any known way to either fix my <br>
stackmat&#x27;s problem or just buy a timer?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Tim,

I&#x27;ve got worse troubles :)  I had one stackmat, and I was gunna send
it back to get fixed, but they just sent me a new one.  On both
timers, both reset buttons are now busted.  They are still usable, but
the cover that says &quot;reset&quot; is now ripped and I can see the actual
button you are pressing.  On one of my mats I have experienced the
same problem as you, and it just means that the battery is loose.  The
best way to fix it is to take it out and put it back in.  Maybe you
could try buying a new battery? I don&#x27;t know.  But everytime it
happens to me I just take it out fiddle with it a bit, and stick it
back in, and it works.

  Yes, and them being &quot;established&quot; is exactly their problem. But we as 
  a relatively new community have the chance to do things better. 

  Funny enough, I anticipated just that comment, but I am too lazy to find out how to get around it. Maybe many of us have something of a Caesar in us: &quot; ...I am rather the first here than the second in Rome&quot;. That´s why all those closed competitions. A concrete illustration: a Swedish closed will surely be won by a Swede, an open almost surely by a Finn.

  There is always a slighly better chance for publicity, if a Swede wins. After all the newspapers are very patriotic or rather, they know that the readers are. And more than that; this closed case is cheaper for the Finn!

Yeah ok. That&#x27;s the one reason I understand, being recognized by 
people who don&#x27;t know about cubing. For me, the 20s cuber who&#x27;s not a 
national champion is better than the 30s cuber who is. But I guess if 
you want to get into TV or a job or impress a girl or whatever by 
mentioning your cubing skills then it can be an advantage to say 
you&#x27;re a national champion even if you suck worldwide.

But back to your scenario: if it&#x27;s a problem a Finn might win, do it 
like US nationals, foreigners can compete but don&#x27;t count for the 
title. Also, what does it help patriotism if a Swede wins a 
competition where only Swedes are allowed to participate in the first 
place?

> And more than that; this closed case is cheaper for the Finn!

Well, nobody forces him to compete, right? But a closed competition 
forces him to not compete.

          <div class="email-content">Nice arguments, Stefan
   
  I agree with you on this topic
   
  I&#x27;d be very sad if I was travelling by Europe and there was a competition that I couldn&#x27;t go...even if I&#x27;m probably not going to win (well, maybe next Euro will be open and I&#x27;ll be faster by there )
   
  I like the US nationals format...foreigners are allowed to compete and set records, but they don&#x27;t take the &quot;US champion&quot; title

I&#x27;m going to have to send them an e-mail if this is the case.

Anyhow, I recommend contacting Speedstacks if you haven&#x27;t already. 
I&#x27;ve found that they are pretty nice about these things.

Curious though..., how long have you had the timer?

That Reminds me. A couple of the gen 2 timers at Nationals 
where &quot;peeling&quot; at the pads. I kept avoiding those. Has anyone else 
expereienced similar problems. I&#x27;m starting to think that I don&#x27;t 
use mine very much, because mine is still in mint condition 
practically.

I&#x27;m checking the past month or so of news since I&#x27;ve been away for a while, and I&#x27;m around 30 messages from being done, so someone has probably already answered this one. Anyway, I was watching the European Championships from Göteborg in Sweden, and during the 3000m Steeple Men I believe there was an Israeli, so they explained that traditionally, everything that&#x27;s &quot;European&quot; is open to all countries beetwen Portugal or Island and Ukraine or Finland or whatever and Israel. That&#x27;s probably a result of the old days when Israel was created 50 years ago and recognized by the UN and such. Everyone (well... probably not everyone, but a significant percentage of the population) in this part of the world that was to become Israel (1947 I think? would have to check) had then a passport from a strictly European country (France, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, etc.). Not a happy time anyway. But still, that&#x27;s the reason why European Championships are always open to any European country
 AND Israel. No other reason than that.
That or I&#x27;m totally wrong and then please someone correct me. But I think that should be it.

Please be more specific? What kind of method did they come up with? 
I can see how to solve a cube of infinite side length assuming the side length has certain 
order types (e.g. alpha*+n+alpha, for some ordinal alpha) - in fact, one can easily come 
up with a canonical method to do so in type &lt;=max(omega,alpha) but what about cubes 
with side lengths that can&#x27;t be well-ordered (or maybe can&#x27;t even be linearly ordered) or 
infinite Dedekind finite cubes? It&#x27;d be pretty impresive if someone could come up with a 
way to solve a cube whose side lengths were indexed by sets that couldn&#x27;t be linearly 
ordered.

Of course, on an infinite cube if the scramble were finite then one could probably project 
the cube onto some nxnxn cube and solve (assuming one could figure out which slices 
had been involved). The infinite cube problem is more of interest only if a) the scramble is 
also allowed to be of non-finite length or b) it turns out to be a difficult problem to reduce 
the solution to tht of a finite cube if the scramble were finite.

          <div class="email-content">I find any sized cube easy to solve... let&#x27;s go through a 7x7 solve:

Universal Centers Method:

-First, there are only three &quot;types&quot; of pieces. These would be, on a 
7x7, edges (E) centers (O, for origin) corners (C):

CEEEC
ECECE
EEOEE
ECECE
CEEEC

Now, you solve all the corners. http://bigcubes.com/4x4x4/centers.html 
look at how to swap just two corners, and apply a similar method on 
the 7x7 centers. Edges all revolve around an algorithm similar to the 
edge swap on the last two centers: http://bigcubes.com/5x5x5/centers.
html If you see how that algorithm works, then you can use something 
similar on any edge on any center.

Universal Edge Grouping:

Use any method you like for the first 10 edges. 

Last Two Edge Grouping:

1  1
2  2
3  3
4  4 
5  5

First, use a normal 5x5 last two edges algorithm to solve 2, 3, and 4 
pieces. Then treat 2 3 and 4 as the middle edge of a 5x5 (similar to 
how we treat the last step as just a 3x3) so it will look like:

1  1
2  2
2  2
2  2
5  5

Now solve 1, 2, and 5 as a normal 5x5 edges.

Final solve:

Use any 3x3 method you like. On even cubes, remember your parity 
fixes.

This isn&#x27;t so hard. ;)

I&#x27;m about 3/4 done with the results page, and I should hopefully have<br>
it up very soon - sorry for the long wait.  This update will also<br>
include updated National and World records for all categories, and I&#x27;m<br>
trying to wait until everything is ready and just do it all at once<br>

After thinking about this some more, I was thinking perhaps Chronos 
Cube, after the father of Zeus, Titan of Time, because of how long it&#x27;s 
been since the 5x5x5 was originally released, and how long it&#x27;s been to 
get them to release this since they first announced it, apparently back 
on July 8th, 2003 (message 5194 is the first reference I see to it 
here). I thought the TwistyPuzzles people had it bad, but it was 
actually announced/discovered here almost a full year before them even. 
For those of you who were here all that time and waiting since the 
beginning, you have my sincere sympathies/condolences. Waiting for 2 
years for the release is bad enough, but 3!... Another name I came up 
with for the 6x6x6 is the Tantalus Cube, as that&#x27;s effectively how I 
feel we&#x27;ve been treated by the Olympicubes bunch. For those not up on 
the mythology, Tantalus was a human who did something to anger Zeus and 
all the other gods (what it was depends on which version of the myth 
you subscribe to). As punishment, he was cast down into Tartarus with a 
never ending hunger and unquenchable thirst. He was forced to stand for 
all eternity in a pool of water below a fruit bearing tree. When he 
reached up to grab the fruit, it would raise up out of his reach, and 
the water would recede away whenever he bent over to take a drink. I&#x27;m

<br>
I have decided to start learning to do the cube blindfolded.  It was<br>
very motivating to see Chris Hardwicks 12 min 4x4 solve at nationals.<br>
Im  just gonna learn the 3x3 though...<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve decided to learn how to solve all of the edges first.  SO i solve<br>
the corners and then fx the centers, and THEN look at the edges. <br>
Which method should i use?  What&#x27;s the best way to memorize edges?<br>
<br>
I already know lots of edge orientation algs, so maybe i should learn<br>
the OE/PE numbers method.  I like the idea of Stephan&#x27;s method, but I<br>
can&#x27;t figure out how to actually do it.  With either method, I dont<br>
know how to permute the edges.<br>
<br>
Maybe I can orient all edges, and then use Stepans method to permute?<br>
<br>
I have looked at Cubefreak and Stephans site.<br>
are there a lot of pages on blindfolding?<br>

&gt; You can&#x27;t just upload them to YouTube? Its far more convenient.<br>
<br>
And have any random person stumble on to it and be able to view it, <br>
while you are not able to save a local copy... I think not. YouTube is <br>
pretty horrible for this sort of thing. It&#x27;s &quot;stream-based,&quot; I <br>
believe, so not very desirable.<br>
<br>
Speaking of which... I kinda want a download of the MathCamp video <br>
with Macky in it. I used to be able to download streaming media (much <br>
more illegal than regular piracy mind you), with certain tools, but I <br>
just want it legit. Is it availible somewhere else? Is it actually <br>
possible to save a local video off YouTube that I don&#x27;t know about?<br>
<br>
Thirdly, did anyone catch a video of any of my solves (for any puzzle)?<br>

  Yeah ok. That&#x27;s the one reason I understand, being recognized by 
  people who don&#x27;t know about cubing. For me, the 20s cuber who&#x27;s not a 
  national champion is better than the 30s cuber who is. But I guess if 
  you want to get into TV or a job or impress a girl or whatever by 
  mentioning your cubing skills then it can be an advantage to say 
  you&#x27;re a national champion even if you suck worldwide.

   Also, what does it help patriotism if a Swede wins a 
  competition where only Swedes are allowed to participate in the first 
  place?

  It helps, but don´t ask me why!

  > And more than that; this closed case is cheaper for the Finn!

  Well, nobody forces him to compete, right? But a closed competition 
  forces him to not compete.

  Don´t say. Every Finn has an inherent, irresistible wish to beat any Swede. Be the money there, he is forced to go.

  Rune 

  Cheers!

Sure, it&#x27;s not so hard to solve a 7x7x7 - but Doug was talking about solving infinite cubes 
and 7 is most definitely finite.
I was asking Doug because he&#x27;d mentioned that a few years back someone had come up 
with  legitimate method of solving infinite cubes and I was enquiring as to this because it 
seems to be easier in certain cases than others, particularly whether the lengths of the 
sides can be well-ordered.

  Sure, it&#x27;s not so hard to solve a 7x7x7 - but Doug was talking about solving infinite cubes <br>
<br>
  Sounds tough. Can you even in infinite time find the first corner? (With the probability one there is always an edge lying before it).<br>

  another BLDer
   
  well...I&#x27;m using orient/permute system for some time now...and I like it
  I&#x27;d recommend you to practice the separate stages (OC, OE, PC, PE) alone firstly, if you&#x27;re going with this system...was what I did when I started
   
  and Craig is right. If you&#x27;re going to orient the edges, so don&#x27;t use Stefan&#x27;s system...use either the &quot;normal&quot; 3-cycly one or Stefan&#x27;s M2 method
   
  or just use Stefan&#x27;s method, without orienting anything...
   
  good luck

          Hello Everyone

I have decided to start learning to do the cube blindfolded. It was
very motivating to see Chris Hardwicks 12 min 4x4 solve at nationals.
Im just gonna learn the 3x3 though...

I&#x27;ve decided to learn how to solve all of the edges first. SO i solve
the corners and then fx the centers, and THEN look at the edges. 
Which method should i use? What&#x27;s the best way to memorize edges?

I already know lots of edge orientation algs, so maybe i should learn
the OE/PE numbers method. I like the idea of Stephan&#x27;s method, but I
can&#x27;t figure out how to actually do it. With either method, I dont
know how to permute the edges.

Maybe I can orient all edges, and then use Stepans method to permute?

I have looked at Cubefreak and Stephans site.
are there a lot of pages on blindfolding?

Why do you want to switch?
Is Stephan&#x27;s method too slow, too hard, not hard enough?

I could go either way, because i know EO algs and I know the PLL algs
already.  but Setup moves seem hard for both systems...

If i do choose Macky&#x27;s method, I want to change the defenition of edge
orientation so that you can turn L and R with quarter turns.  then F
and B must only experience half turns, instead of L and R.  will this
still work?

what about memorization?
Should I memorize numbers, or should i make a story in my head?

What&#x27;s the best way to do corners?

any help is greatly appreciated

          <div class="email-content">Stefan&#x27;s method is great -- very easy execution, and very few setup
moves.  It does have its limit though as it solves one piece at a
time, and so it uses more moves overall.  The other approach uses more
mental power but fewer moves.  And yes, making F and B your full-turn
faces is perfectly fine.  

Our brains are not built well for numbers normally, so it helps to
make up memory systems for the different steps of your approach.  As
for corners, many people do different things here.  People like Tyson,
for instance, memorize the flip-sequences that need to be done (like
-+- or +++, etc).  It&#x27;s really whatever works best for you.  Some
people do better with rote, while others would prefer a system.

          <div class="email-content">I use L and R quarter turns instead of F and B in my BLD solving and it&#x27;s
just fine.

As for memorization; do whatever you find works best. I&#x27;m not anywhere near
the top blindfolded cubers, but I visualize a path that the pieces need to
follow (I use cycle method), and visualize which pieces need to be oriented
which direction. I think its quicker to use such a direct method of
memorization, but its harder to retain the information.

          <div class="email-content">GameOfDeath2: I think that was *you* that mentioned it way back. It 
was highly technical so I never really tried to grasp it. Maybe it 
wasn&#x27;t a full solution.

BTW, who are you? You are a long time poster whose identity I have 
been wondering about for a 3 years. In light of the anonymity the 
internet provides, as a moderator, I&#x27;d like to know who you are. 
Besides it is nice to leave a name at the end of a post.

As a long time reader of your post I wonder if you have a good math 
background, like a PhD maybe. (optional, but I have bets on it :) )

<br>
Oh and congragulations to FrankM, Chris, Leyan, Toby, Ryan, Ravi, <br>
Craig, and Bob for their exemplary performance at this year&#x27;s <br>
Nationals. If you have been cubing in a cave for the past 2 weeks:<br>
***TOBY MAO sets the NEW WORLD RECORD of 10.48 seconds.***,<br>
piety it&#x27;s not in the media as strong as we&#x27;d expect.<br>
<br>
==================================================<br>
mrrubik67: your message 29990 has been deleted for inappropriate <br>
personal attack towards another member (2 strikes). Do watch what <br>
you say, this will not be tolorated. In slightly related news..., <br>
try to respect various countries and their cubers.<br>
<br>
It should be made fairly clear if a person is just joking around, or <br>
being sarcastic.<br>
<br>
Other things I must point out:<br>
* Every post should have a decent subject line (you know who you are <br>
o_O). (And change it when a thread drifts too much.)<br>
* No spam, soliciting, or other propaganda... duh.<br>
* No links to auctions before they are closed, unless of course you <br>
are the seller (to honor twistyfourm&#x27;s policy).<br>
* Do not directly quote information you have received in a private <br>
communication without the expressed permission of the other party(s).<br>
* No swear words, threats, racism, sexism, and the like... use your <br>
best judgement noting that there are people that read from a great <br>
range of age and ethnicity.<br>
* off-topic posts are welcome (more or less), but should be labeled <br>
as such<br>
* Due to the huge delay in posts showing up, many have been <br>
double/multi- posting. This is okay, the second post will usually be <br>
deleted by a moderator momentarily (yes, someone checks every half <br>
hour becasue I have no life), unless it was meant as an edit or has <br>
extra material. Thus, try to reply to the first post only. Also, due <br>
to it&#x27;s unreliablity, you might want to save what you post to a text <br>
file just as a temporary backup.<br>
* Posts &lt;= 4 chracters are automatically deleted.<br>
* Posts that don&#x27;t really add anything to a topic will be deleted at <br>
our discretion. (The younger members here should note this, seeing <br>
as a majority of this infraction seems to be made by minors - by <br>
leaving quick remarks.)<br>
* Three infractions and you will be banned (though not set in stone).<br>
* &quot;Double Posts&quot; - posting more than once at a time. Many other <br>
fourms frown on this. However this is actually a good thing here. If <br>
you have things to say in multiple threads, it is best to post <br>
replys to each separately even if they looked closely stacked <br>
together in time.<br>
* Have a standard &quot;is of a graphic nature&quot; warning/disclaimer before <br>
posting [links to] pictures of not yet healed tattos...<br>
* Side-note: if you&#x27;ve been posting here for over 3 years and we <br>
still aren&#x27;t entirely sure your real identity, that is bad (actually <br>
there is nothing we can do about it, lol).<br>
<br>
(this list is subject to changes from Chris of course)<br>
<br>
That is all I can think of off the top of my head, I&#x27;m sure Chris <br>
can make a *more offical* listing. In general, just try to respect <br>
other members.<br>
<br>
BTW, Chris and I love seeing how activity here seems to be <br>
rebounding lately.<br>

I don&#x27;t know anything about the way you solve or your 
times/background, but I&#x27;m guessing that many people will recommend 
learning a 2-step Orientation followed by PLL (permute all, ~13 cases) 
in order to head towards the mainstream. Personally, I also offer the 
route of learning CLL/ELL (all corners, then all edges), but it&#x27;s much 
more exotic these days.

Cubing in an public place

So I punched him right in the face.

The Rubik&#x27;s Cube&#x27;s an addiction,
The source of much spousal friction.
I&#x27;ve been practicing plenty.

Perhaps that would end this affliction!

Can&#x27;t have been me. I posted something on infinite cubes but it was earlier this year, not 
years ago. My post only looked at infinire cubes with side length of a certain order type, 
but it was a full solution for those order types.

I&#x27;m not really a cubist - I&#x27;m just  a mathematician - at least I used to be.

Just out of curiousity, could one nickname for the 6x6x6 cube <br>
be &quot;Devil Cube&quot;? Seems obvious, given the 6-6-6 symbolism.<br>

I&#x27;d bet this has been mentioned before. I&#x27;d also bet many folks of a <br>

<br>
Okay so I know this is a total shoot in the dark, but:<br>
<br>
Going through my stuff again, I am now pretty sure that I lost my <br>
main speed-Magic. It is a Harry Potter magic in relatively good <br>
condition. I have now started to place logo stickers on my magic-<br>
inserts to identify them in competitions, but this one doesn&#x27;t have <br>

(for those of you that string).<br>
<br>
I have no idea what happened to it. I know I had it Sunday <br>
afternoon, and didn&#x27;t have it Tuesday.<br>
<br>
Likely candidates are that I left it at one of the local&#x27;s place, or <br>
that Craig or Bob ininvertantly took it (things shuffling around in <br>
the trunk perhaps?). I suppose I could have left it in the <br>
competition area... that would suck, because it would then be <br>
practically untraceable.<br>
<br>
Looking at the bigger picture, I have 5 brand new magics that I <br>

<br>
 first of all<br>
thank you to those who responded to my blindfold/help wanted post.<br>
<br>
After 2 days i have decided to definitely use Stephan&#x27;s method for<br>
blind folding.  I like the idea of 24 objects for the edges, and using<br>
a story instead of numbers.  When I have to remember numbers, i<br>
usually need to come up with a story anyway. <br>
<br>
I want to use a different edge for buffering (same 2 corners).  <br>
I&#x27;m experimenting with using different slots on the top slice.  Setup<br>
moves are easier for some pieces, but harder for others.  I don&#x27;t know<br>
why i feel the need to differ. <br>
<br>
WHAT is a good PLL for switching URF/URB, and UF/UB?<br>
<br>
I have found some online for URB/ULB and UR/UL, but I would like to<br>
have no set up moves.  (I don&#x27;t use PLLs; This is for Blindfolding)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong with just using the PLL, it&#x27;s pretty fast.

This probably won&#x27;t help you much, but I would just do:

y&#x27; ((R&#x27;URU&#x27;)R2) y&#x27; (R&#x27;U&#x27;RU) z&#x27;y (RUR&#x27;U&#x27;) (Rld&#x27;)

Oh and for the record, I don&#x27;t use PLL in my nomral speedsolving 
much either, but I do like to use this for BLD. Although I prefer to 
setup into either T-Perm, Y-Perm, N-Perm, or one of the J/L&#x27;s (in 
that order of preference). I am less prone to mistakes with those.

I can&#x27;t remember that much information at once, about the 24 edge 
stickers. It&#x27;s just so convienent with things like hex-flips to get 
rid of EO in the first 5s after donning the bld. But I want to point 
out that I no longer use numbers either. I stopped using them for CP 
a while ago, and have been trying to not use them for EP either not. 
For both cO and EO I plan out all the turns in advanced and try to 
get that out of the way as fast as possible.

Well I use numbers for 4x4 edges :), and stores for the centers I 
guess.

          <div class="email-content">I had the same thing at the Czech Open : television wanted me to make a
blindfold solve because they couldn&#x27;t wait until the afternoon for the BLD
event.

So to make it short they agreed that I do a fake solve (anyway they were not
going to show it completely on TV). All they wanted to have was some
guy wearing a blindfold solving a rubik&#x27;s cube. So I made one corner cycle
and one edge cycle (with some setup moves so that it looked a bit scrambled)
so that they were happy.

Hopefully you cannot see the time on the timer (I think it was 1:12). (If
you want a real TV BLD solve of mine, look at the TV apperance for the
Belgian Open, that one was a successful official solve.)

But I completely agree with Tyson&#x27;s point of view.
Otherwise we will bump with other&#x27;s people saying &quot;I saw some guy doing much
faster than you.&quot; And how would you expect them to react if you tell them
that what they saw was fake ?

          <div class="email-content">I think I&#x27;ve seen this guy on Youtube before -- I recognize the face
and his cube. I do believe it&#x27;s his method (speedblindsolving, similar
to one of Hardwick&#x27;s videos).  On the video he solves it blind in like
18 seconds using speedsolve approaches. I could be incorrect, but
regardles I&#x27;ll try to get that link later to doublecheck.

Edit: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38TfwmxClR4

Hahahha just thought this was pretty funny :P

Couldn&#x27;t find the other videos but I know they&#x27;re on there somewhere
-- they&#x27;re all sitting like at a public restaurant (maybe a McDonalds

GOOD job..

and good job on a 16 sec avg.  Its good to see another 15s cuber using
ROUX (besides Gilles i mean).  I will be there soon enough...  once i
actually finish learning CMLL

We use a lot of the same algs, but you definetely have a couple i
haven&#x27;t seen before.  I use a U&#x27; adjustment for D and G.  ANd a U2
adjustment for E and F.  WIerd, but it helps me see the corners better.

Its my goal to have all CMLL cases end in R/r.  Im tring to eliminate
anything that ends with F or B.  I like not having to align centers
during F2B, and just doing it at the end of my CMLL Alg.

Sure it exists. Which edges do ou want to flip though? If it is also the ones you are 
switching then
U L2 B2 U F2 U&#x27; B2 F2 U&#x27; B F&#x27; L F2 L B&#x27; F&quot; U&#x27; L2
works -this might not be optimal.

          <div class="email-content">Problem.<br>
<br>
So I was fiddling around with my newly made MM. I assembled it so that <br>
there would be exactly one clip per tile side and hence evenly <br>
distributed. I just noticed that now that half the clips have shifted <br>
over on both sides! I didn&#x27;t know this would even be possible using <br>
nomral flips, but appearntly I did some sort of &quot;double <br>
inversion/convolution&quot; in the same direction or something (actually I <br>
just made up those words, I&#x27;m not sure what it would be called).<br>
<br>
I have half the tiles without clips and half with two clips - on the <br>
front and then also on the back (except for the 4 corner tiles on the <br>
back that have 1 each).<br>
<br>
I managed this, by doing a full scramble on it and trying to get back <br>
to starting-state. (I didn&#x27;t make an observation at that point.) Then <br>
I tried to get to the end-state without using a &quot;method&quot;, but rather <br>
just playing around with it and using a few &quot;magic algs&quot; I know.<br>
<br>
Can someone plz offer a suggestion to help me out??? *looks at Jaap, <br>
Bob, and Craig*<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m tempted to restring it and never again mixing it up, seeing as how <br>
I didn&#x27;t do a perfect job in the first place and that I&#x27;m quite fast <br>
at stringing.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
BTW, I can see how that alg Thomkirjava posted above is full of <br>
triggers, I kinda like it. Good work on the CMLL page btw, I went <br>
through and tried every alg. It might not be completely typo-free <br>
though. I&#x27;ll go though it again if I get the chance.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
The results page is posted to speedcubing.com and also the world<br>
records page and former world records page have been updated.  I don&#x27;t<br>
have time today to finish the national records and personal best times<br>
update, but I will try to either finish them or at least have them<br>
mostly finished before Ron gets back on the 19th.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the delay, I&#x27;ve been working long hours lately and finally<br>
had a break to work on this stuff again today.  I&#x27;ll try to finish the<br>
national records and any new personal best times for all categories<br>
ASAP, or at least have them most of the way done before Ron gets back.<br>

Next time write LU&lt;=>UR.

I use these:
LU: (l2 F&#x27; l&#x27; U l&#x27;) (F&#x27; U&#x27;) (F R U R&#x27; U&#x27;)
LF: (l F&#x27; l&#x27; U l&#x27;) (F&#x27; U&#x27;) (F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; l)
LD: (F&#x27; l&#x27; U l&#x27;) (F&#x27; U&#x27;) (F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; l2)
LB: (l&#x27; F&#x27; l&#x27; U l&#x27;) (F&#x27; U&#x27;) (F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; l&#x27;)

Btw, that does *not* flip 2 edges, it just swaps them. At least that&#x27;s 
my view.

You can find this algorithm on my page here:

http://puzzlingaddiction.com/Cube/ll-algs/

Click on row 4, column 6:

http://puzzlingaddiction.com/Cube/ll-algs/index2.cgi?oll=0101,0000

Click on the second picture:

http://puzzlingaddiction.com/Cube/ll-algs/index2.cgi?coll=0101,0000,0132

The case you are looking for is row 1, column 3:

(U) R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; U F R B&#x27; R B R2

All of the algorithms from these pages are from Bernard&#x27;s list,
although I&#x27;m thinking of adding more algorithms to the pages that have
more finger tricks.

          <div class="email-content">In that case it should have been UFR&lt;=&gt;URB as well as LU&lt;=UR. But <br>
yes I agree with Stefan.<br>
<br>
I also agree with the wording that it does *not* flip them. But this <br>
is more the thinking of someone that uses the bld method you and <br>
Stefan are using, that is &quot;sticker-based&quot;. I guess techincally you <br>
could say &quot;swap edges while changing their orientation. In every <br>
definition of EO, I can think of, it is changed. Moreover, it takes <br>
an odd number of quarter turns in this case to move the edge itself <br>

I know 1024 EO definitions where it does *not* change.

A BIG &#x27;THank you&#x27; to all who responded
I didn&#x27;t expect so many responses

I&#x27;ve decided to go with (R2 B&#x27;)(R&#x27;BR&#x27;)(F&#x27;U&#x27;F)(RURU&#x27;)
It&#x27;s the same one thom suggested, and it was in Doug&#x27;s list too.
Craig uses it and so does Stefan, so I guess I will too.
(I&#x27;m still gonna use R2U&#x27;R2UR2yR2UR2u&#x27;R2D for T perms though).

Thanks for the help (everyone)

I decided to go with the 2nd from the last.  
R2 B&#x27;(R&#x27;BR&#x27;)(F&#x27;U&#x27;F)(RURU&#x27;)
 its also the one thom gave me.

GOOD news is that by using this alg, the avg # of setup moves for
Stephan&#x27;s method is 1.05, compared to the original 1.36.

I need another alg 


A PERM that switches URF&lt;=>URB and RU&lt;=>RF  
with this, the setup avg will be 0.86 moves

Good stuff....

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
Just thought I would let you know about a new cube tool that I wrote<br>
over the past few days, called Cube Log.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s a good way to practice your speedsolving, at the moment it only<br>
handles 3x3x3 solves but can be extended when I have the time. You ask<br>
it to generate a number of scrambles, and then you input your solve<br>
times in the boxes provided. You can then see a record of your<br>
average, and it will calculate your average time for you. Finally, you<br>
can decide whether or not to save it to your own personal Log.<br>
<br>
You can also choose to view your Log, sorted either by Date or by<br>
Average Time.<br>
<br>
To use it you have to register for a Cube Station Account, if you take<br>
part in the FMC you will already have one of these, if not<br>
registration is very quick and simple to do, and free of course! :)<br>
You need to register so a personal log file can be created.<br>
<br>
I hope that you find the Cube Log useful :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">That happens a lot around here. Thanks for pointing it out though. 
It gets even worst when schoool starts up in September. Usually 
September, November, and January are still good months though since 
there are big tournaments usually around then. Summer it is usually 
busy, but not this summer for some reason. I also think that a lot 
of cubers are &quot;all cubed out&quot; after WC2005. People are mostly 
prepeing quietly for EC05, of the ones that are cubing actively 
lately. Americans just got a big competition, thus it is expected 
that we won&#x27;t post much. Although it is expected htat a few of us 
(myself included) will post personal reports and/or picture sets as 
soon as we have time. But that will be the extent of it.

A few ppl I talked to also complained about being bored with cubing 
at the moment. This is also understandable. But as you know cubing 
is so addictive that they will always come back, surely enough.

Anyhow some random thoughts of mine today:

This is a funny cube-related video where no one solves a cube and 
it&#x27;s in a language I don&#x27;t understand but still funny: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqByknKOSbM&amp;search=rubik%27s%20cube

I stumbled upon a vid of Shelley BLD solving in just under 2 minutes.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZs-Gr6Vcsk
I showed it to a few of my friends today who where throughly 
impressed.

And slightly off-topic is the video that inspired the one of Macky 
at MathCamp recently. It is called &quot;Yellow Fever&quot; and about Asian 
males and dating done by a group of pretty impressive UCSD film 
students, whose works can be found here: www.wongfuproductions.com

I just lubed a new keychain I got. The mechanism is just a miniture 
form of the regular mechanism now. The older one I got from 5 years 
ago is of a slightly different mechanism oddly enough (both rubiks 
made). I would love to see them make keychain 4x4s and 5x5s!

I wonder if I can do a keychain cube one-handed while blindfolded in 
under 30 minutes? Okay one of you guys try and report a time here :0.

I suspect that Will S. can solve a cube in 40s by the finger tricks 
he is using in that Happiness(sp) movie trailer. Does anyone know?
I thought this was a funny article about that upcomming movie where 
the writer gets completely trashed in the comments by making a bad 
assumption: http://www.ciwww.cinematical.com/2006/07/26/happyness-
trailer-released-title-still-spelled-wrong/#comments

Oh and in case anyone cares, I did go though and fully restring my 
MM last night (in reference to an earliy post). I&#x27;m not sure why I 
am so obsessed with having good clip distribution. It only took 
about 1hr this time. I really love stringing magics, MM and up 
especially. I have access to a photo quality printer and can make 
silver version MMs for ppl. If anyone is interested e-mail me. (3 HP 
or Homer magics -> 2 MMs, kinda nifty, my copied inserts are not 
double sided but look very convincing on high quality paper.)

This reminds me, the next time you magic-ers crack open your 
magic/MM, place a logo sticker inside if you have one. This tip 
should save us confusion at gatherings.

I like DanH&#x27;s new site layout and can&#x27;t wait for it to be filled 
with material.

I am still looking for someone to do teamBLD with, using full out ZB 
codes. This might be too evil for everybody I guess, but still worth 
asking.

BTW, a *really* terrific trophy for Leyan would have been a hugh 
6x6... *fully functional*! I bet I wasn&#x27;t the only person thinking 
that though.

p.s. I know about tinyurl, and I still prefer to give links this way.

          <div class="email-content">This is well known alg by ZB solvers. You will love me for this... 
(if I understand your question that is)

If this does what you want, then look no further because this is 
as &quot;fundemental and irreducible&quot; as a simple Sune. A classic alg.

          <a class="header-link" href="#msg-1322"><strong>1322. Some info on the scrambles for US Nationals</strong></a><br>
          <em>From:</em> &quot;Bruce Norskog&quot; &lt;brnorsk@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Fri, 18 Aug 2006 04:14:45 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">Before U.S. Nationals, I mentioned that there was a reasonable<br>
possibility that random scrambles for the 2x2x2 may have optimal<br>
solutions of five moves or less (half-turn metric). I looked at the<br>
published scrambles from U.S. Nationals, and the number of moves<br>
required to solve them are listed below (for the 2x2x2 competition):<br>
<br>
Preliminary:<br>
HTM: 9, 9, 10, 7, 9<br>
QTM: 11, 11, 11, 9, 12<br>
<br>
Final:<br>
HTM: 8, 7, 9, 9, 9<br>
QTM: 10, 8, 11, 11, 12<br>
<br>
So none of the scrambles were within five, or even six moves from the<br>
solved position. One scramble in the preliminary and one in the final<br>
could be solved in 7 moves. A slight majority of positions of the<br>
2x2x2 are solved optimally in 9 moves (HTM) and 11 moves (HTM) is the<br>
maximum. So in summary, I would say that the 2x2x2 scrambles were of<br>
reasonable quality, based upon the criterion of optimal solution length.<br>
<br>
An optimal solution for each scramble is given below. These sequences<br>
assume the whole cube is oriented first so that the DBL cubie is in<br>
its solved position.<br>
<br>
Preliminary:<br>
 F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R U2 R F&#x27; R&#x27; F2<br>
 F U&#x27; R2 F2 R&#x27; F U R&#x27; U<br>
 U F&#x27; U F U&#x27; R2 F U&#x27; F U&#x27;<br>
 R&#x27; F&#x27; U2 R2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;<br>
 U2 R&#x27; F U&#x27; R F U R2 F2<br>
<br>
Final:<br>
 U2 R&#x27; F U&#x27; R F2 U F<br>
 R&#x27; F&#x27; R2 F&#x27; R U F<br>
 F U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; R2 U&#x27; R U2 F&#x27;<br>
 R F&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; R U2 R F2 R&#x27;<br>
 F&#x27; R2 F R U&#x27; F R&#x27; U2 F2<br>
<br>
And, for those who might be wondering about the scramble for the WR<br>
3x3x3 solve by Toby Mao, I have this information.<br>
<br>
That scramble is solved optimally in 18 moves in the face-turn metric<br>
(or half-turn metric), and 21 moves in the quarter-turn metric. So<br>
that scramble can be considered to be a typical cube position as far<br>
as how many moves are required to solve it. (A majority of positions<br>
of the 3x3x3 cube are 18f*.)<br>
<br>
Scramble:<br>
 B U B2 U&#x27; L2 F&#x27; U B U2 L&#x27; B2 D R&#x27; D2 U2 L&#x27; R2 B R2 U2 R2 F&#x27; D2 F2 L&#x27;<br>
<br>
Examples of optimal solutions are:<br>
 F D&#x27; B L U2 F D R2 D&#x27; L B2 D&#x27; R&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; B2 R2 U&#x27;  (18f*)<br>
<br>
 F R&#x27; L&#x27; U F2 R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; L U&#x27; D&#x27; F B&#x27; U D&#x27; L&#x27; B U R&#x27; L   (21q*)<br>
<br>
These were determined using Cube Explorer (ver. 3.67) and Michael<br>
Reid&#x27;s optimal solver, respectively.<br>

I knew it was a ZB case (from the right side).
I actually looked on Lars&#x27; site, but i couldn&#x27;t find the Full LL index

I like this alg.
I converted it to R2F&#x27;RB&#x27;R&#x27;BFR2B&#x27;R&#x27;B, so that there is no need to
regrip (messes me up).  

thanks

          <div class="email-content">Ya, I knew you&#x27;d try to convert it. One place to look for such algs 
is on Hardwick&#x27;s ZB pages. (Which are no longer being maintained and 
I might want to take over them.) Another is something recent that 
LarsP put together and it is currently hidden on his site. You have 
to type something like ../cube/270/ for the address. It&#x27;s actually 
pretty cool and I learned a bunch of algs from there recently.

This URL took me a while to hunt down. Easy for me to remember 
though, it&#x27;s the course number of the lab instructor job I had last 
year.

I posted a much more extensive ZB listing... pretty much exhaustive 
listing of all the optimals (FTM and LRU restrict) for many of the 
hundreds of cases, into the zb fourm, which is no longer active for 
many months now. I should make a site out of it so it&#x27;d be useful to 
ppl.

I&#x27;ll probably end up taking over the ZBLL portion of 
speedcubing.com, now that it has been offered to me a few times. And 
make those additions when I have some serious time. Chris really 
dropped everything else to sharpen his big cube BLD mad skillz. It&#x27;s 
understandable.

I like these questions of yours!

          <div class="email-content">Thank you very much for doing this for us. Definately appriciate it.

I suspect, I did an optimal for my 4.17 solve (it was the fastest 
2x2 solve in the entire competition). I think Tim R. might have done 
it too. It was #4 scramble in the prelim. I just noticed this fact 
looking over the results page. I&#x27;m actually pretty happy about 
this... I guess you could say it was a fluke though :/.

No, but mine (4.33) was a PLL skip (I do one side-OLL-PLL).  I&#x27;m 
pretty sure Hardwick did it the same way I did in 5.64:

Scramble: 
F2 L2 D&#x27; F D&#x27; F2 U L&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; L D2 F&#x27; L2 D2 L2 U2 R F L&#x27; F D2 F&#x27; U2 B
(white on top, green on front)

Solve (solve orange first):
x y&#x27; L U L y R U R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; F R F&#x27; U2 (12 moves)

Optimal was 7 moves, mine was 12.  Not quite optimal, but not too 
far from it!

I think I&#x27;d like &quot;The Beast&quot; more.. hm.

I&#x27;m not sure everyone is content with using a nick name that is

Israel is usually competing in European competitions.
Organising an Asian competition is quite hard because they do not have a common language like we have English, German, Spanish or French.

Have fun,

Ron

  &quot;Euro 2006 is open to citizens of the European countries and Israel.&quot;

  Why Israel, and not the US for example? Israel&#x27;s part of Asia. Which 
  reminds me, we should have an open Asian championship.

          <div class="email-content">Well, I see that there are these major languages in Asia (excluding 
Russia): Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and English... In 
Chinese schools, every Chinese person speaks English in one way or 
another. Southeast Asians mostly know how to speak English (singlish, 
as Singaporeans call it), but Koreans and the Japanese? I&#x27;m not so 
sure about them... My school, which is international, also faces this 
problem. Parents come from all over the world; the school&#x27;s job is to 
print out a copy of whatever handout (for example student information) 
in Chinese, Korean, Japanese, English, French, etc. Maybe something 
similar?

You can find a bit about the original methods on some odd sites around

I&#x27;ll check out the site later. I&#x27;m on an age old computer and I assume
this is a java-happy page :)

          <div class="email-content">Not that it counts, but my personal opinion is that the core of a 5x5 defines how nice it is.  
You can have the nicest pieces, but if the core sux, the puzzle sux.  I have found 1/4 cores 
that I bought to be good enough to use, and have not tried substituting pieces onto it, but 
I have thought about it.  My suggestion is a new core, and a good new core is as hard to 
find as a good new 5x5.

          <div class="email-content">Per recently broke two of his 5x5 cores too. I think you should 
start off by contacting Cubesmith, he should have some spares since 
ppl like me keep ordering a down x-centers from him at a time.

If you break a lot of x-centers your self, or have a lot of other 
broken pieces, than the most economic approach, may be to just buy a 
brand new 5x5 yourself. Try to get one for less than $30. Then sub 
in the mech. I am getting close to doing this, my 5x5 mech. is 
becoming much too loose after a few years of wear.

I am actually not too familiar with the mech. itself. Where are the 
screws located? Is it just one axle? If it is just one axle, it 
might be worth working on. You can try to slice off the center cap 
in order to get access to the screw.

I would then use something to make the screw hole a bit smaller. I 
remember reading somewhere (probably on Ton&#x27;s pages) that it helps 
to use glue (he uses superglue, but I&#x27;m not sure if this matters 
much). He places some ont eh tip of the screw, and screws it in 
before it drys, than removes the screw after it drys and 
reassembles. The trick here, is to guage the screw depth without the 
center piece.

It&#x27;s also a good idea to clean the screw of any oily residue.

When you are satisfied, glue the center cap back in place and 
perhaps do a bit of sanding on it.

Again, I wnat to point out, I&#x27;ve never taken a 5x5 mechanism apart. 
so I really don&#x27;t know for sure, but this is how I imagine it is 
like. (Anyone want to second my recommendations?)

A 5x5 core shouldn&#x27;t cost more than $4, I hope. I hope that 
rubiks.com sells x-center replacements sometime in the future to 
balence out all the partial cubes out there.

Didn&#x27;t he say tightening the screws didn&#x27;t help?

My guess: no new core needed. Clean screw and where it goes into and 
use a little bit superglue. Also: what type do you have? Meffert or 
Eastsheen? If Meffert, you can sand the ends of the springs flat which 
should help.

          <div class="email-content">Sand the springs? I wouldn&#x27;t have thought of that. I have to try.
Btw, how can I clean where the screw goes? And should I put the 
superglue there?
Probably the screw comes out easily now because a bit of silicone 
fell into the screw place.
I changed the screw putting another one with a less oblique threading 
to prevent the sudden coming out.
The situation got a little better, but it&#x27;s only a matter of some 
more face turns. It won&#x27;t last one solve.
I wonder, if that is the cause, could the core get back to normal as 
before?
How much time does it take to get dry (or how can I dry it)?
Actually, I don&#x27;t know which type of 5x5 it is, because it&#x27;s a gift.
The thing I know is that it didn&#x27;t have any logo, but the pieces are 
identical to my original Rubik&#x27;s (that I haven&#x27;t taken apart yet). 
The stickers are different (good quality) with the old style orange, 
I think. Maybe an old 5x5, I don&#x27;t know.

          <div class="email-content">I think it&#x27;s probably an older 5x5. Although, you might be able to 
tell from the plastic and the molding, if it&#x27;s a more recent knock 
off brand.

Sanding the springs will reduce noise, but I&#x27;m not sure how much 
that will really help.

I always keep a certain product called &quot;Goo Gone&quot; that removes any 
greasy residue, sticker gunk, or other adhesives. I do a lot of cube 
preparations, so it is worth it for me to have this. This would get 
rid of any oil/lube in the screw hole, not sure if it&#x27;d be worth it 
for you though.

If you plan on doing 5x5 a lot, I do recommend using your second 5x5 
and using this one as for pieces. I break 2 x-centers every week.

I don&#x27;t understand the situation. Will rubiks.com not ship to that 
country or something? It is still possible to purchese cubes off 
Amazon.com. Just make sure that you don&#x27;t get the one in 
the &quot;plastic shell packaging&quot;. The ones that are in the Hexagonal 
prisms are the best I think. It might even be possible to find ones 
in cardboard box pckagaing too. Those should also be okay.

www.edsthinkshop.com offers pretty competitive pricing I think.

We might be able to help if you explain your situation further.

I think what you&#x27;re doing here belongs either in a wiki or an a more 
general domain name like speedcubing.com or rubiks.com. It&#x27;s not 
really your own. Besides, we have nice wikis for this:

http://www.snkenjoi.com/wikicube/index.php?title=List_of_methods

and

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing

as we say in programming: let&#x27;s not reinvent the wheel. But anyway, 
if you feel you can make this work, go ahead. Just allow the wiki 
makers to include your content.

          <div class="email-content">I agree that L2L1-4 stuff is missing and that that one is used by 
more than one person. I am honored that you mentioned me.

I was sort of thinking that my method would be overlooked. I think 
I&#x27;ll document it someday, but no one ever wanted to see it published 
so I never bothered.

Just to give a quick summary though. When I first started cubing, 
1998-1999, I was using a system where I would solve the top corners, 
then the E edges, then the top edges, permute D corners, orient D 
corners, orient D edges, permute D edges. This quickly evolved to 
full CLL/ELL, where some of the tougher ELL algs where found using 
ACube (whatever version it was at the time). My CLL algs where found 
by trial and error, and I still use many of them today.

I got to about 1:10 that way in 1999. I then started doing F2L this 
way, and it&#x27;s become my system since:

1. FL and BL edges
2. UFL and UBL corners
3. UF and UB edges
4. One of the two 2x2 blocks, either (ufR) or (ubR)
5. Solve the rest of the 2x3 on the right by adding the c/e pair 
using standard c/e-pairing algs.
6. Solve the UL edge while flipping the D edges correctly.
7. COLL
8. Edge Perm

It&#x27;s been this way since summer of 2002 I think. It was when I 
started using COLL, which only required learning about 8 more corner 
algs in place of my normal CLLs. At the time I was averaging 
*nearly* sub-20 solving this way.

Whenever it was not possible to do EO early, I would do my normal 
CLL in place of the COLL and then do ELL, with full ELL knowledge. 
Steps 5 and 6 are very interchangable, I do about half and half now. 
When I do the UL edge first (which in many cases I might do UL and 
UR edges together), I would do zbf2l for the F2L finish and then 
proceed.

Step 6 requrires knowing all the algs to insert and edge while 
flipping the other 4 edges, an alg set of about 14 cases that I know.

Another alternative is that if the UL edge is done and I have a 
2x2x3 block, I will likely do a &quot;Petrus orient all edges&quot; step to 
make things easier later. Alternatively, if I find a c/e pair is 
done on the right, I will finish the F2l minus the UL and UR edges 
then do a cube rotation and proceed like Gilles&#x27; method.

Thus, it is not always the case that I finish F2L before doing CLL.

Sometimes in place of step 2, I will also &quot;sneak in&quot; the UL edge. 
Many times steps 2+3 are done fluidly together. But step 3 alone 
does require the build up of many &quot;short algs&quot;. Or I guess you could 
say that it is intuitive.

Another improvement I have is that I will do the UL edge and an ER 
edge at the same time if all the U coerns are in place early.

Only in the past year have I started holding LL on U most of the 
time. in the past two years I have learned much more ZBLL so that 
has helped. I started learning all the ZBLL cases that don&#x27;t involve 
CP about 4 years ago, so I&#x27;ve been at it for a while. I haven&#x27;t been 
learning anymore ZBLL now that I have realized I greatly lack ZBF2L 
algs.

In addition, when I do not have EO for LL, I have an expanded CLL 
set that will flip the proper edges so that I &quot;catch up to&quot; ZB 
solving, and will typically just have a 3-cycle.

Moreover, I learn ZBLL algs sporatically so that I can cover all the 
categories in such a way that I will rarely end with H-Perm or Z-
Perm.

Try solving *modularly* with this method, it&#x27;s fun. Don&#x27;t cosider it 
a serious speedsolving method though, because it is probably quite 
worthless to anyone besides me. I use it at competitions and it even 
got me a sub-20 ave in the TN tournament, but it took a lot of work 
(especially to figure out most of the algs myself). Not for the 
faint of heart.


-Doug

p.s. Oh, I mastered PLL, but I still don&#x27;t know a third of the OLL. 
Luckily I don&#x27;t really need it for anything besides teamBLD. 5% of 
the time I also start off with a 2x2x2 block... so basically I don&#x27;t 
really have a method, I just go with the flow. It&#x27;s a *non-method* 
really, lol.

I disagree with this on so many levels. Firstly, it is usual, legal and<br>
even right for different authors to write different books or articles on<br>
the same topic, in different prose, with different illustrations, and<br>
with different emphasis or different analysis. It is not the information<br>
that belongs to these different authors, but their expressions of it.<br>
Secondly, I am the proud author of my articles, and so I will publish<br>
them on my own website :-) Neither rubiks.com nor speedcubing.com have<br>
any sort of automatic ownership over other authors&#x27; articles, and so my<br>
article does not inherently belong to either of their domains.<br>
<br>
Finally, the world would be a far less interesting place if different<br>
authors were not permitted to write different articles on the same<br>
topic, and if the only articles in existence were published by some<br>
central organisation.<br>
<br>
While on this point, please do a google search on<br>
<br>
    http://www.google.com/search?q=history+of+programming+languages<br>
<br>
and appreciate the range of different articles available on the topic.<br>
<br>
P.S. Aren&#x27;t you the same guy who objected to my graphical cube database,<br>
which I also put a lot of effort into? We are all free to contribute in<br>
our own way. If you think otherwise, then don&#x27;t just pick on me, but<br>
also pick on all of the people who have written their own pages about<br>
&quot;cube notation&quot;, &quot;cube terminology&quot;, or the &quot;Fridrich system&quot;.<br>

Doug, your F2L appoach is really crazy and really effective, too :-)<br>
Thanks for sharing! Now that it is in the open, I hope you don&#x27;t mind if<br>
I describe what I remember of the video you used to have on your page.<br>
<br>
You started with a 3x2x1 block and the opposite edge, so that it looked<br>
like a T-shape. Imagine the 3x2x1 block at the rear and the<br>
opposite edge at the front. The next steps were then very interesting.<br>
You inserted a corner/edge pair on the left side of the T, not a<br>
vertical pair but instead a flat horizontally lying pair. You inserted<br>
it with BL&#x27;B&#x27; with the pair landing at DL+DLF. Then on the right side of<br>
the T, there was already an edge stored in the DR position (which you<br>
probably put there) that belonged in the FR position. You then found the<br>
other edge that was to take the place of DR and inserted it from above<br>
with something like B&#x27;RB, both solving it and pushing the stored edge to<br>
its correct place.<br>
<br>
Now you were left with only the FL edge and the FRD corner to solve.<br>
You adjusted D with &quot;D&#x27;&quot;, and solved them both together with a F2L<br>
pairing algorithm.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s my recollection of the solve, anyway. I had never seen anything<br>
so strange in my life, yet it appeared to be a very efficient :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Thank you, that means a lot comming from you! I still don&#x27;t like 
your cube simulator program :), my best time on it is still 46s, no 
MINUTES.

My method does work exceptionaly well against certain cases. For 
instance I just had a solve where I did BRB&#x27;D&#x27;BRB&#x27; (inverse to 
setup) followed by a 7-turn (non-zb) LL. A Fridrich solver or even 
Petrus solver would have missed out on this opportunity.

I forgot to mention something very important though. Many times I 
solve the F2L &quot;slant&quot;, that is... I solve F2L so that in the end 
some U-turn solves F2L. This is makes step 2 strong, and means that 
I often see &quot;slant 2x2x3 blocks. It is also useful to do this when I 
have something like a 2x2x3 block on the left, the UR edge in place 
and a discontiguous corner and edge on the right. I guess it matters 
not if the UL edge is in place either.

To be clear, note that in all my explainations LL is D.

So to address what you saw, or think you saw (it was confusing, I 
know). Your observation was a bit confusing too, since I&#x27;m not sure 
if you meant your left/right or my left/right. Firstly, that solve 
was &quot;slant.&quot; The T-shape is not terribly common in my solving but is 
done with having the FL, BL, UFL, UBL, and UR pieces. I would then 
go for a &quot;sideways pair&quot; to fill UF and UFR (or UB and UBR, I love 
to F&lt;->B mirror). This gives me some further options and an 
oportunity to seek later pieces, but in most cases I will *at the 
same time* place UB edge (or resp UF edge). This is where I might do 
another slant (U turn to line up unsolved slots).

BTW, I tried your method for a while, Ryan, but couldn&#x27;t learn all 
the algs for it and was never under 30s with it.


Hem I think I need to coin a new term. A 2x2x3 block minus the 
intermost edge will henceforth be known as a &quot;Doug Block&quot;. How do 
you like that! I have thought about that for a few years but I&#x27;m not 
serious, well unless you all accept it... Everybody says &quot;Petrus 
Block,&quot; but of course he&#x27;s been around for 25+ years. In contrast 
I&#x27;ve only been cubing for 10 and speedcubing for 8.

Just too keep everybody entertained... This is a very Java-heavy 
page (makes you wish you had broadband if you didn&#x27;t) that showcases 
my last F2L step: inserting the UL edge while flipping the LL edges. 
It&#x27;s always been on Chris&#x27;s to-do list to learn these. I think it 
would be great if someone else could beat him to it for me, lol.

I did this over a year ago; done upon the request of RichardP so he 
deserves some credit in nudging me. (Bookmark it and don&#x27;t snoop 
around my non-existant site.)

Speaking of which, congratulations to Harris Chan for his new #1 average<br>
of 10 record of 13.18 seconds!<br>

    http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/speed.html<br>
<br>
He has taken the #1 spot from Anthony Hsu who previously held the spot<br>
for a very long time (using Petrus). I&#x27;m sure he is working hard as we<br>
speak to reclaim his spot :-)<br>
<br>
We had a good time on the cube battle game recently. For those who are<br>
curious as to what it looks like when people are actually online, here<br>
is a screenshot:<br>
<br>
    http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/speed/screenshot.png<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; So to address what you saw, or think you saw (it was confusing, I <br>
&gt; know). Your observation was a bit confusing too, since I&#x27;m not sure <br>
&gt; if you meant your left/right or my left/right. Firstly, that solve <br>
&gt; was &quot;slant.&quot; The T-shape is not terribly common in my solving but is <br>
&gt; done with having the FL, BL, UFL, UBL, and UR pieces. I would then <br>
&gt; go for a &quot;sideways pair&quot; to fill UF and UFR (or UB and UBR, I love <br>
&gt; to F&lt;-&gt;B mirror). This gives me some further options and an <br>
&gt; oportunity to seek later pieces, but in most cases I will *at the <br>
&gt; same time* place UB edge (or resp UF edge). This is where I might do <br>
&gt; another slant (U turn to line up unsolved slots).<br>
<br>
I can see it will be difficult to write about all of the techniques in<br>
your method because there are so many of them! One thing I liked about<br>
your solve is how you stored an edge in a 1-off position, and then<br>
bumped it to its correct position while solving another piece.<br>
<br>
Zbigniew also uses something like the slant technique, I think, or at<br>
least to the extent that in the F2L he always pairs any corner with any<br>
edge, not just the ones that have matching colours, and will align the<br>
two layers first so that the two non-matching pieces can be solved at<br>
the same time.<br>
<br>
This is different again from the idea of non-matching pairs which I<br>
should also add to the page.<br>
<br>
&gt; BTW, I tried your method for a while, Ryan, but couldn&#x27;t learn all <br>
&gt; the algs for it and was never under 30s with it.<br>
<br>
I long ago abandoned the idea of &quot;algs&quot;.<br>
<br>
The secret is to solve in less symmetric stages. This means that there<br>
are too many cases to memorise (no symmetry to take advantage of), but<br>
it also means that you don&#x27;t need to memorise because those cases are<br>
easier to solve by intuition.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s something I also want to write more about...<br>
<br>
There is a long way to go before solving in &quot;real time&quot; with no<br>
pre-calculated algorithms can be demonstrated to be an effective<br>
speedcubing method, but that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m trying to head. (For some<br>
example solves, view my average of 10 record on the cube simulator.)<br>

Oh my, please tell me the numbers behind the names stand for something 
other than number of cubes solved.

About corners first methods: Josef Jelinek has described a few on his 
site (at least the Waterman page also contains some history) and I 
think he has good knowledge about corners first in general, so you 
could ask him:

It&#x27;s ELO, a rating system used in chess and some other games. It goes
down if you lose and up if you win. Here it starts at 1500. Hmm, I
wonder how many times I&#x27;ve solved this one...

Uh ok, didn&#x27;t see that coming. Same advice as Meffert then...

Yes, it&#x27;s probably the springs that push/turn the screws out so that&#x27;s 
why flat ends should help (slightly reduced pushing and much reduced 
turning friction).

You could try some wet thin &quot;fluffy&quot; but stiff stick if you have. And 
yes, what I meant was clean away lube if it got there (which it never 
should). Superglue in there or on the screw, yes, like Doug/Ton 
described. But only a little. You can always go back and use more if 
needed. Another idea I just had is powder. Hold the hole vertically, 
put a little powder in it, then put the screw in it. Never tried that 
yet but I think it could work and be less &quot;dangerous&quot; than glue.

          <div class="email-content">At Nationals 06 it was half and half (they set them up alternating 
and with 3 or 4 table hieghts, I tried for the tallest gen 2), but 
at least two gen 2 ones where peeling. I didn&#x27;t trust those. I 
really wish they would make gen 1 ones still, in addition to gen 2 
ones. They both have advantages and drawbacks.

I think the gen 2 ones last longer in general and are more 
convienent, for say plane seatback trays. If you can get used to the 
location of the reset button, than gen 2 ones give less chance of 
timer failures/faults as well as make it faster to go though more 
solves on it, since you don&#x27;t have to take the time to reach all the 
way over.

There really is multiple versions of the gen 2 itself. Someone at 
Nationals showed me this by testing the minimum stop time. From that 
I conclude that hte newer gen2 ones are also more accurate in timing.

Those ones that are endorsed by Rubiks.com do do the 
typical &quot;trimmed averages&quot; we all known and love as well as connect 
tot he large tournament displays from stackmat (interesting 
tradmarking issue there) but are too expensive for my hopes and are 
not yet sanctioned by WCA as we all know.

It&#x27;s also good to note that they tend to mix the two large LED 
audience displays now. The newer one is circular and slightly more 
colorful. I&#x27;m not sure why they did this, but they all use like 8 D 
cell batteries, it&#x27;s quite aweful really.

Well, using ACube, I generated many algs like that.  I feel more 
comfortable with Regular T perm and Edge Flip alg.  But, you know I 
hope you like the alg that they gave you, it looks very nice.

I generated dozens of algs in attempt to perfect my alg system for 
my BLD method.  I&#x27;m getting back into BLD, I&#x27;ve just been busy with 
2 jobs and now I&#x27;m going full time college!  Oh well.  Good luck 
with that, that algorithm is very handy for tageting the L face of 
the UL.

comfortable the way I solve the F2L. For my last layer, I solve ALL of<br>

flipped the correct way, my problem is the corners. I&#x27;m looking for<br>

          <div class="email-content">Welcome to the forum. You want to do ELL/CLL it seems.

This is a most interesting way to solve. I don&#x27;t think many cubers 
would recommend this approach though. It&#x27;s almost unheard of. It is a 
common thing to orient edges first in most beginner LL methods. But 
unless you can do a single step edges, I think that proceeding along 
this path may be difficult.

If you really want to do this though, I recommend learning all the 
algs for cycling 3-corners while preserving edges. There are about 13 
cases or so (just a rough estimate off the top of my head). It is a 
very useful set of algs to know and is a subset of ZBLL. I know them, 
they are pretty short actually.

I was reading Ryan Heise&#x27;s site last night and it seems he uses 
commutators for doing that sort of thing, which is very interesting.

The way you solve LL corners now is actually the way I solve my last 
few corners on the megaminx. This technique you use is useful for 
other puzzles, so it was a good thing you have practiced it.

To move on to more mainstream methods though, you might want to 
consider Orienting Edges, Orienting Corners (7 cases), then PLL, which 
is an alg set with only 13 cases. This makes for an elegant 3-look LL 
approach that leads well into speedsolving due to it&#x27;s established 
recognition speeds.

Later when you are comfortable with this most cubers would recommend 
doing OLL/PLL. Personally I like CLL/ELL but I&#x27;m wierd.

To get you started in learning corner algs, you might wnat to try 
LarsPetrus&#x27;s site and learn the &quot;Nikalas&quot; and how to compose Sunes to 
get corner twisting effects that do not disturb the edges.

I have looked at this page extensively, because I love Corners First.

The basic cf method is similar to the first method i learned, from
Jeff Varasano. Jeff did not include algs to insert redge and orient
the midges though.  I call them waterman algs.  
I like corners first because its a very direct method.  Minh Thai did
something similar to the 3rd method, but with red and orange. And
don&#x27;t forget YOU CAN DO THE CUBE, selling 1.5 million copies in the
80&#x27;s.  I believe that was also a Corners First solution.  
In my opinion ROUX is also a corners first method.  

 
VARASANO METHOD
Orient W Corners 
Orient Y Corners 
Permute all corners. 
3 Ledges 
3 Redges
Last Ledge/Redge
Permute Midges
Orient Midges


WATERMAN METHOD
Solve White Corners
Solve 4 Ledges
CLL Yellow corners
Solve 3 Redges
Solve last redge and Orient Midges
Permute Midges

WATERMAN REVISITED
Solve white Corners
Solve 3 Ledges
CLL yellow Corners
Solve 3 Redges
Solve last Ledge/Redge and Orient Midges
Permute Midges

And then there&#x27;s AKimoto&#x27;s method

Ok, I just booked a room. You might save a bit if you book a room 
here:
http://www.ibishotel.com/ibis/fichehotel/gb/ibi/1401/fiche_hotel.shtml

They offer a special rate there, we now pay 146.91 Euros for three 
nights and two persons, 30 Euros less than the normal price.

          <div class="email-content">Very nice read Doug!

If I could find an alg that rotates three edges, keeping one edge I
already have solved corectly, I would be happy. Basically I ALWAYS
have everything in the right places, just not flipped correctly. I
average about 1 min like this, but if theres an alg I could find that
rotates three edges one time counter-clockwise, while keeping one of
the four edges in its original spot, then i&#x27;ve acomplished all of my
rubik cube goals.

Any one else experience sleeping problems when cubing too much? On

few hours ago.

I&#x27;m still really perplexed about what method I&#x27;ll want to use for 
6x6 centers. I think I know how to do the edges fast and what to do 
about parities. SOmething makes me think that centers will take a 
really long time to figure out for me. I do hope it will be 
availible within the year. In the timescale of the cubing world, 1 
year is not that long folks, so don&#x27;t lose hope!

Not everything needs to be inside the cube: new batteries can be
shaped in many ways, and could be made into tiles. 

Scenario:
Press opposite tiles twice and the cube receives a signal from a unit
and the colors swap around to a specified scramble. Solve it and it
sends a signal to the timing unit. The turns you use to solve it are
displayed as you make them. 

Cheers,

David J

          <div class="email-content">That sounds really cool. I wouldn&#x27;t choose to use custom shaped 
batteries though; that costs A LOT. For a project like that I would 
be best to use the budget for other things. To have many Lithium 
batteries in each cubie would be enough to spread the power 
requirements I think.

I would reserve the space in the tiles for other things, such as 
making them translucent and embedding different colored LEDs 
underneath... 6 perhaps. The only problem with that is that 6 
per &quot;sticker&quot; would mean 18 for a single corner piece and that would 
certainly not fit with regular sizes. I guess the use of the mini 
LEDs would work, they are pretty bright if you run even 3.3V through 
them.

Making buttons out of the tiles would be a tricky matter, but I&#x27;m 
sure someone would be resourceful enough to come up with an idea.

Should this cube physically turn? Or would tapping the buttons be 
enough to cause a &quot;turn&quot;?

If we don&#x27;t allow for physical turns, than I see more freedom in the 
internal wiring and having a centralized battery cell, as well as 
easy 6 identical boards to do soldering with, not counting the 
control logic.

I guess there would even be enough room for a pico-processor running 
assembled C code.

Definitely a &quot;Senior Design Project&quot; idea for EvanG I think. Or 
anybody else here who does embedded systems design sorta stuff.

I&#x27;m not sure where to place a display though, and generally displays 
are hard to interface with.

Either way, this project would cost about $500 to do an initial 
prototype for a conservative estimate due to the extreme price of 
true white LEDs. It would require plastic molding which I have no 
idea how to do. Any well-defined logic circuitry I could build for 
you though :).

I guess if I found the right ppl, I could make one of these next 
semester with all the stuff I&#x27;ll be learning taking a class in how 
to use Intel embedded design packages (8-bit things with built-in 
Operating Systems). This would allow it to easily demonstrate on 
it&#x27;s own various speedsolving sytems as well as run a version of the 
MikeReid code to find an optimal path when requested.

<br>
Most people will say to learn and memorise many algorithms, so I&#x27;ll be<br>
different and try to give some hints on how you can solve this with<br>
intuition.<br>
<br>
For the edges (with F2L on bottom): just pull out a F2L corner/edge pair<br>
onto the top layer with RUR&#x27;, then turn U by any amount, then insert the<br>
corner/edge pair back in to the F2L. You will have cycled 3 edges in the<br>
process.<br>
<br>
For the corners, you can cycle 3 corners (and preserve the edges) like<br>
this: pull out a bottom layer corner (corner #1) onto the top layer with<br>
RUR&#x27; (in the process, some corner #2 from the top layer will take the<br>
place of the old position of corner #1), then turn D by any amount<br>
replacing corner #2 by yet some other corner #3, then reinsert corner #1<br>
with the reverse operation RU&#x27;R&#x27;. That&#x27;s A 3-cycle. Oh, and then reverse<br>
the D operation that you did, also.<br>
<br>
More about both of the above techniques is explained on my page:<br>
<br>
    http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/method/<br>
<br>
<br>
(FYI, all corner 3 cycles can be optimally solved by this technique,<br>
except for one case for which there is another technique that manages to<br>
solve it in one less move. Cases where the corners need to be twisted in<br>
place (with no cycle) can be solved with two cycles: a forward and a<br>
reverse one, quite efficiently. Most cases with 4 corners can also be<br>
solved efficiently with two successive 3 cycles. The exceptions being<br>
when the 4 corners are in place and twisted. Then other techniques are<br>
more appropriate. I don&#x27;t describe those techniques because my method<br>
always finishes with 3 corners.)<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I disagree with this on so many levels.<br>
Let me start by apologizing for my tone, which was probably more rude<br>
than I actually meant it to be. I applaud all initiatives that bring<br>
the cube to the community. I especially applaud your programming,<br>
which I think is mere genious, seriously.<br>
<br>
What I&#x27;m trying to point out, if you are not aware of it, is that<br>
there are projects that get significantly more internet traffic than<br>
your site and are therefor a good place for (part of) the topics on<br>
your site. Also, I believe we could accomplish much more as a<br>
community than as a collection of single-website-creators. It doesn&#x27;t<br>
mean that all of us should not be allowed to have a website, of course<br>
not! And I looked at the history page, and I know that applets are not<br>
accepted in wikipedia, which I think is too bad... <br>
<br>
After reading your reply I did realize that it was complete nonsense<br>
to deny anyone to create a web page. So to re-word my intentions:<br>
&quot;would you be willing to let us use this content as a basis for<br>
wikipedia, and/or the cube wiki, where links will of course be made to<br>
the relevant content&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt; P.S. Aren&#x27;t you the same guy who objected to my graphical cube<br>
database[..]<br>
Well no, I never objected. In my post I did take more caution in the<br>
word used. I said: &#x27;..or use the already existing..&#x27;. So no, I don&#x27;t<br>
object. <br>
<br>
The fact remains that I really like the idea of the community working<br>
together and I don&#x27;t see that alot (besides of course in organizing<br>
competitions, hurray!). I&#x27;m incredibly thankful for the existence of<br>
wikipedia and hope we could have more of that.<br>
<br>
If you would program a feature where we could all add to the database<br>
then I&#x27;d really appreciate that.<br>
<br>
For the rest, never mind my ramblings and please do continue creating.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Now that sounds like fun.  The idea of a cube that doesn&#x27;t actually rotate
seems interesting. Defining how moves are made would be tricky though.  For
instance, pushing on the BUR sticker could mean U or R&#x27;.  If they were
pressure sensitive in such a way that you could tell which direction it was
being pushed, it might be possible.  And another idea that just popped into
my head, no idea how practical or possible it is, but have each layer such
that it rotates a small amount when pressed, then springs back to it&#x27;s home
position.  In such a way the ambiguity of which side to rotate will go away,
but I don&#x27;t know if that would be possible while keeping the inside open for
electronics.

Going back to the idea of just buttons, and the example of pressing the BUR
sticker, there seems to be a problem because when holding the cube, the
buttons under your grip would be depressed.  But this could also be used to
figure out which turn is intended.  Assume a somewhat standard right hand
grip (a cube may be helpful to visualize this).  Left thumb on F sticker,
left index on BL, left middle on B, left ring on BD, left pinky on DB or
just kinda floating.  Right thumb FR, right index BUR, right middle BR,
right ring BDR, right pinky just kinda floating, being useless like pinkies
normally are.  Now a push on BUR would mean U, because it is not being
hindered.  For it to mean R&#x27; there would also have to be pressure on FDR.
Ok, so I know that isn&#x27;t true in general...  Maybe pressure sensitive
buttons? Set a threshold for amount of force needed to turn a side, add up
pressure (positive for clockwise negative for ccw) on all stickers around
the outside of a layer to figure out whether or not to turn it.

Well if I do end up doing this as a senior project (which would be freaking
awesome) I have four years to work out the kinks.  That is if Doug doesn&#x27;t
beat me to it ;-)

Until next time, Happy Cubing

The trainer shows an &quot;un-permuted&quot; LL and you need to enter the correct

options from a list.

                           Hi all,
 
 I have created a simple program (sort of, it&#x27;s an Excel document) to
 train recognizing the PLL pattern by looking at two sides of the LL.
 
 The trainer shows an &quot;un-permuted&quot; LL and you need to enter the correct
 permutation in the form of cycles in numpad notation, or by selecting
 options from a list.

          <div class="email-content">Oh great, find all the bugs in my ideas why don&#x27;t you...

Hem, I like the idea of having a mechanism that twists slightly and 
rebounds. So two taps for a 180, OR make it pressure sensitive to 
detect the difference between wanting to do a 90 and a 180.

Just to give us designers a bit more freedom, the inital prototype 
can be twice the size of a nomral cube, lol. I have no clue how to 
create such a mechanism though except to find inspiration in similar 
things. I don&#x27;t know where I sould find translucent tiles, but to 
ask for them on the twistyfourm.

Each corner could be self-contained in such a way that you only need 
to send it a number between 0-23 (so only 5 wires, if going 
digital). Each edge piece would need a number between 0-23, so also 
5 wires. Centers should always be lit a single color, so that 
requires just Vcc/Gnd. By bundling the wires, it would be neccessary 
to have (20 pieces)*(5 output wires + Vcc + Gnd) + (5 centers)*(2) = 
150 major wires.

This doesn&#x27;t even include the input signals. An excellent place to 
install that would be the centers. If we go for a simple non-
pressure mech. Than each face can be in one of 3 states. I&#x27;m 
figuring 4 wires times 6 faces for input signals.

There would also be an on-off button I guess (a small one somewhere, 
buttons save room over switches). There could be more buttons, but 
that is the minimum, plus it should probably have auto-shutoff.

Anyhow the way I described above, with every piece a bit self-
contained, should mke the central logic stuff easy to handle.

I still think it&#x27;s do-able, especially given twice the size of a 
normal cube to work with. And Going with a nice steady 3.3 volts or 
even less would be enough since there are no motors/acuators 
invovled.

          <div class="email-content">Since I learned the Varasano method from his book back in the 80&#x27;s, I
just thought I would comment on how I would describe his method, as
the description given was slightly inaccurate, in my opinion. At least
I will consider Varasano&#x27;s method to be the method as described in his
book. I suspect that in actuality, he used a number of techniques that
are not mentioned in his book. I believe nobody learning his method
would follow the method exactly as described in the book, at least not
for very long, I would assume.

His book talks in terms of solving UP and DOWN layers, not left and
right layers. People adapting his method may decide to orient the cube
differently, of course. And his book doesn&#x27;t use any funny made-up
words, but I guess that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t describe his method
with funny made-up words if you want to. 

His book also talks about beginner techniques (used when first
learning the method) and advanced techniques (used to solve the cube
faster than when only using the beginner techniques). The basic
sequence of steps doesn&#x27;t really change between the beginner and
advanced variations.

I will use the same Roman numerals used in the book, making the method
five steps, but some of his steps are made up of sub-steps that could
be considered separate steps.

I. Put the UP corners in the UP layer, properly oriented (forming an
&quot;X&quot;). This, of course, also implies that the DOWN corners will end up
in the DOWN layer.

(I note here that most people consider that corners in the wrong layer
can be &quot;oriented.&quot; So simply saying &quot;Orient the W corners&quot; is, in my
view, an incomplete description. W also refers to &quot;white&quot; but
Varasano&#x27;s book does not talk in terms of colors, except in some cases
referring to them as &quot;Color 1,&quot; &quot;Color 2,&quot; etc.)

II. Orient the DOWN corners.

(This step may permute the UP corners in some arbitrary way, as long
as they stay oriented. The DOWN corners can also be permuted in some
arbitrary way.)

III. Permute the UP corners while simultaneously permuting the DOWN
corners.

(Yes, it&#x27;s not incorrect to say that all corners are permuted, but
that is an overly general description of this step, since the corners
had already been put into the proper layer. This step puts the up
layer corners in correct relative placement, and the bottom corners in
correct relative placement, but does not necessarily align the layers
with the middle layer, now generally called the E slice. That
alignment takes place in step V.)

IV. Place three UP edges, then four DOWN edges, then the final UP edge.

(Even before buying the book, I think I would try to place an UP and
DOWN edge at the same time as much as I could. This seemed to really
help speed up the solve. But Varasano&#x27;s book does not talk about doing
two at a time at all, not even for the final DOWN edge and final UP
edge. He also talks about inverting the cube to do the bottom edges,
and rotating the UP layer so that you&#x27;re always inserting into the UR
position. I suspect he described his method this way to make the
description simple, and is probably not what he actually did.)

V. Align the three layers. Then permute the &quot;E&quot; layer edges. Then
orient these edges.

(I&#x27;ve always done these sub-steps of step V in the opposite order:
orient, permute, align. The &quot;align&quot; step was not explicitly mentioned
in kovacic81&#x27;s message. Of course, it is a very minor step, at most
two moves (2f, 4q). It might be thought of as part of the permuting
step, but I think of it as affecting the outer layers while permuting
affects the inner layer.)

Question, Did anything happen in the &#x27;90s ?<br>
<br>
Ah, I can at least mention Herbert Kociemba&#x27;s 2 phase algorithm which<br>
was developed in 1992. Then Mike Reid&#x27;s optimal solver in 1997. Although<br>
they are computer algorithms and not quite techniques that humans use. I<br>
could make them a separate page.<br>
<br>
But were there any developments in human methods during the &#x27;90s?<br>

the entire puzzle? I was thinking along the lines of a fire alarm
system with addressable devices. These can be paralleled on the same 2
wire circuit I think up to 99 addresses per loop.

          <div class="email-content">Anybody else than me who cubes with his right hand while being right-handed
? (algorithms are a bit different, but usually they are just mirrors than
other ones.)

Seriously, how come most ne-handed cubers choose to use their other hand ?
(left when they are fight-handed or right and they are left-handed)

OK I see one reason, let&#x27;s assume you are a right handed cuber. Then you
usually hold the cube with your left hand and turn the faces with your right
hand. Then, when you switch to onehanded, you want to use the same
algorithms, which are really hard to perform with your right hand. So you
switch to your left hand.
At the beginning you need to get used to use your left hand and then you are
just fine.

As for me, the biggest problem was to mirror all my algorithms, but I didn&#x27;t
have to get used to use my other hand.

So I guess I answered my own question, both hands are equivalent but steps
to be able to use it fastly are different.

Any comment ?

          <div class="email-content">Marc van Beest uses his right hand and I believe he is right-handed. I
use my right hand, too, because it&#x27;s much stronger so I can practise
more. Yesterday, for example, I solved around 150 cubes without any
problems.

I didn&#x27;t mirror my algs, but I&#x27;m just lazy. When I get better at Heise
method I&#x27;ll use it for one-handed anyway so I&#x27;m not going to practise
LL too much.

I am mostly left-handed but a little right-handed too. When I cube
normally I use my right hand to the great majority, but I use my left
hand when I do one-handed solving. For my it&#x27;s easier to do UR-moves
with my left hand and since most of my algs is based on UR-moves it
felt best to use left hand.

          Hi!!

I am mostly left-handed but a little right-handed too. When I cube
normally I use my right hand to the great majority, but I use my left
hand when I do one-handed solving. For my it&#x27;s easier to do UR-moves
with my left hand and since most of my algs is based on UR-moves it
felt best to use left hand.

If all of the random scrambles chosen for a competition were reduced
to  an 18 move form, couldn&#x27;t they be used that way, and thus reduce
the wear and tear on the scramblers, and the time taken to scramble
lots of cubes?

They have a number of colors in transparent and translucent. Their
thinnest colored acrylic is 1/8&quot;.

Maybe you could try an led cube prototype on a 2x2x2 first. The
Eastsheen jumbo 2x2x2 seems to have a little more room to work with
internally than a 3x3x3. You might find easier solutions to problems
you would encounter building a 3x version by building a 2x version but
without the extra 3x pieces complicating matters (if that makes any
sense).

If you&#x27;re so good at this stuff then why didn&#x27;t you acknowledge that
you were wrong about it, when using &quot;one&quot; as the unit of infinity was

The problem with those is that they&#x27;re opaque.  I&#x27;m looking for 
something more like this:

http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4203

So when the LED&#x27;s are illuminated they will show through and 
illuminate the whole tile in the desired color.  I&#x27;m thinking that a 
plastic Tupperware piece or similar product could be cut into 
squares and work well.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I find it&#x27;s faster if you do everything the following way:

http://www.snkenjoi.com/k4

Although I have made some major improvments to it recently.

Averaging about 1:30

It&#x27;s quicker to do finish the centres if you leave part of the first
face un-done.

Also, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re thinking of attacking the last layer in the
wrong way, as the pieces don&#x27;t even have orientation. I think you just
mean putting them into their correct orbitals, which i find makes the
algorithms to permutate them to their correct position arkward. Why
not just directly permutate them two at a time?

On a side note, does anyone else have a better method than this for
doing it? I&#x27;m currently hovering around 3-4 look.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t use this method but I found some commutators that might help 
steps 5 and 6...

to flip ULf and UFl (ie the 2 edges next to the UFL corners) you can 
do f2 U&#x27; l D&#x27; l&#x27; U l D l&#x27; f2 = f2 [U&#x27;, l D&#x27; l&#x27;] f2
to flip both left edges do the inverse of the above algorithm (f2 l 
D&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27; l D l&#x27; U f2) = f2 [l D&#x27; l&#x27;, U&#x27;] f2

to do a 3-cycle of edges (URb->ULf->UFr) do f&#x27; r&#x27; D r U r&#x27; D&#x27; r U&#x27; f 
= f&#x27; [r&#x27; D r, U] f

Play around with commutators like the last one to get more useful 3-
cycles.  Or, for a 3-cycle, you could do something like r&#x27; D&#x27; r U r&#x27; 
D r U r&#x27; D&#x27; r U2 r&#x27; D r, manually inserting each piece.  This works 
for doing other even permutations as well.  If you need to swap two 
edge pieces then you can do a setup move of B2 r&#x27; D2 r U r&#x27; D2 r U&#x27; 
B2, do an OLL parity (r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2) 
then undo your setup move.  That swaps UFl and UBr, though it is a 
lot of moves.  Good luck!

I didn&#x27;t acknowledge I was wrong because I wasn&#x27;t wrong. 
You weren&#x27;t able to communicate mathematically with any level of sophistication.
I didn&#x27;t want to get into a James S Harris (of sci.math notoriety) type of argument. The fact 
that I didn&#x27;t want to pursue a dialogue that was half gibberish doesn&#x27; mean I was wrong.

What is supposed to be meant by &#x27;using &quot;one&quot; as the unit of infinity&#x27;? You didn&#x27;t try to 
explain what you meant.

You wrote:

&quot;I know this is a common misunderstanding. All infinities are not the same size. Those 
who claim they are have not thought it through.&quot;

yet you didn&#x27;t reply at all to the fact that all infinite subsets of the natural numbers are 
(they even have the same order type) and both the primes and the natural number are 
subsets of the natural numbers. If you deny that the number of even natural numbers 
equals the number of natural numbers then you either don&#x27;t know or else don&#x27;t 
understand the definition of equality of infinite cardinals. If you don&#x27;t understand even this 
it is difficult to discuss concepts of infinity.

Given a subset A of N, n in N, let A(n)={k in A:k&lt;=n}. Then let d(n)=|A(n)|/n (for n>0). The 
density is then the limit of the sequence (d(n)) if such limit exists. If A is the set of primes 
then this density exists and is 0. For the set of even numbers (or of odd numbers) then the 
density is 1/2. For the set of multiples of k (k>0) the density is 1/k. (All as expected.)
For other sets the density may not exist. You can always form liminf and limsup of (d(n)) 
though. The liminf>=0 and the limsup&lt;=1, of course.

That said, you can also consider the rate at which the density (if it exists) is approached. 
For instance the primes and squares each have density 0, but the sequence for the squares 
tends to zero much faster than that for the primes. If P(n) is the set of primes&lt;=n, then 
pi(n)=|P(n)| and S(n) the set of squares&lt;=n then |S(n)|/pi(n) converges to 0. Of course, for 
other sequences, A(n), B(n), even if |A(n)|/n and |B(n)|/n both converge to 0, it may not be 
the case that |A(n)|/|B(n)| converges.

The Riemann hypothesis, if ture, would give information on the distribution of primes by 
virtue of giving an improved estimate in the prime number theorem.

The problem with those is that they&#x27;re opaque. I&#x27;m looking for 
something more like this:

http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4203

So when the LED&#x27;s are illuminated they will show through and 
illuminate the whole tile in the desired color. I&#x27;m thinking that a 
plastic Tupperware piece or similar product could be cut into 
squares and work well.

          <div class="email-content">Another possibility, have sliders instead of buttons.  If you have seen a
psp, it has a small joystick thingy (very technical term) that is barely
raised and can move in any direction.  Now imagine one of these on the BUR
sticker.  If you intend to perform U, the slider would slide towards the
right side, whereas if you intend to do R&#x27;, the slider would move up.  Now
use this idea and combine information from all sliders to determine which
turn to do.  This also has a slight resemblance to a side that turns
slightly then returns to where it was.  The sliders would probably need to
have enough resistance to not move when you are just holding the cube.  And
the centers might not have to have sliders on them, which would help with
the moving while holding problem too.

Now how cool would it be to create something like this, and be able to hook
it up to the computer for online cube battles?  Or us it as a remote control
for a cube robot.  If you could put a sensor in each center of a fully
functional cube (not a solid state one) such that you could tell when a side
is rotated, then transmit this back to the computer (even through a wire
from a single center at first), you could control a virtual cube.  And in
this case you wouldn&#x27;t need stickers, or color changing stickers, you could
just look at the cube on the screen.  Now if an accelerometer were included
(don&#x27;t ask how) and you could watch the cube being rotated on the screen as
it is in your hands, that would be pretty awesome too, and once again you
don&#x27;t need stickers.

Just tossing around ideas...

Until next time, Happy Cubing

Your steps 5 and 6 really could be combined into one, Eric. Nowhere <br>

good idea to CLL it... learn a bunch of new algs that would help in <br>
3x3 solving.<br>
<br>
5,6,7 can be done together if you want to preserve corners and all <br>
you have left are those 8 edgies. I recommend using commutators like <br>
Chris does for 4x4 blindfold. Thos are pretty short sequences that <br>
can be generated on the fly with some experience. There is an alg I <br>
do recommend learning though for starters.<br>
<br>
(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;)r(URU&#x27;R&#x27;)r&#x27;<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s a a simple (the move) commutation with (r) that I used to use <br>
for the entirety of 4x4 edges bld. Well I also used the inverse and <br>
mirrors, and another alg for permuting 3 edges within the <br>
same &quot;orbital&quot; (i.e. all &quot;oriented&quot; already).<br>

I explained it in English and I demonstrated its usage mathematically.

There was nothing gibberish about it.

There are different parts to infinities. Take positive integers: the
number one is the beginning, if this is an infinite series of numbers
then there is no other end, it continues on. Like a rope with one end,
the beginning is a finite entity.
The numbers themselves are finite. Take all the even numbers separate
from the odd numbers - that&#x27;s imposing a limit on them- another finite
aspect.

If at any point you dip into the series to check a number to see if it
is even or odd you are limiting it. You can see that the number beside
it is different. All the odd numbers plus all the even numbers include
all the positive integers. The subsets cannot be the same size as the
whole because at any point you check you are invoking a finite measure.

That is to say - no matter what point you choose the odd integers and
even integers *add* to the total to that point - there is no point at
which even or odd numbers stand in equal numbers to positive integers.

I tried to tell you that I used the term &quot;density&quot; differently. What
percentage of numbers from 1 to 10 are prime? What percentage of
numbers from 1 to 100 are prime. That is the density I&#x27;m talking about.

I&#x27;m not here to impress onlookers with terms they don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m
trying to express this stuff in English. I did post the math.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m just going to make the point that when you talk about &quot;orienting&quot;
edges on a 4x4x4, you are really permuting them. You can&#x27;t change the
orientation of an edge without moving it some place else.

The eight edges of the U layer of a solved 4x4x4 can be divided into
two sets by alternately assigning the edges to the two sets as you go
around the U layer. For simplicity, I&#x27;ll call these sets the
left-handed edges and right-handed edges. &quot;Orienting&quot; the edges
amounts to permuting the edges so that the left-handed edges are in
the left-handed positions, and the right-handed edges are in the
right-handed positions.

So if you have two adjacent edges where only one of the edges is
&quot;oriented wrong,&quot; you have either two right-handed edges or two
left-handed edges together. If you have two left-handed edges, you
will also somewhere have a pair of two right-handed edges. To &quot;orient&quot;
them you need to do a swap or 3-cycle so that the edges in the
&quot;opposite-handed&quot; positions are moved into &quot;correct-handed&quot; positions.
If you&#x27;re going to use three-cycling, it seems to me to make sense to
go directly to forming the pairs, rather than simply trying to orient
everything first.

          <div class="email-content">I will first say that I believe it took at least a couple of hours of
my computer&#x27;s time to come up with the optimal solution for the &quot;Toby
scramble.&quot; Sub-optimal solvers can usually come up with 20-move
solutions within seconds, though. So for 3x3x3, it would make sense to
settle for a 20-move solution. (Note, we don&#x27;t actually know if every
position has a 20-move solution.) Optimal algorithms for 2x2x2 can be
generated essentially instantly, while (usable) optimal solvers for
4x4x4 are non-existent, I believe.

The scramble length for 4x4x4 at U.S. Nationals was 40 (which I assume
to be a WCA standard). In short, I don&#x27;t believe such scrambles could
get reduced by very much by a good 4x4x4 solver program. So basically,
this idea would not really make sense for 4x4x4 and larger cubes.

I think one danger of trying to make the scrambles short is the
possibility of (unethical) contestants trying to gain an advantage by
getting a peek at the scramble algs. If short scrambles are used, more
attention may need to be paid to hiding the scramblers from the
competitors, like having them in a separate room or inside a curtained
off area.

I will also note that these 18 or 20 move shortcut scrambles for 3x3x3
would not give the same positions in terms of a 3x3x3 supercube.
Shorter scrambles mean fewer turns of the faces, and perhaps less
&quot;randomizing&quot; of the center orientations. While the orientations of
the centers are not supposed to be detectable, except for one that may
have a logo on it, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible to prevent
contestants from using subtle markings that may enable them to detect
center orientation changes. It&#x27;s perhaps far-fetched that a competitor
could and would gain some advantage through knowing the resulting
orientation changes of the centers for short scrambles, but I just
thought I would point out that there is this subtle difference between
what the original scramble would produce, and what the shortened
scramble would produce.

          <div class="email-content">I was thinking that, at least for an LED cube with moving cubies, that
making reliable electrical contacts between all the cubies could be
rather problematic. I was thinking that RFID technology might be used
for the cubies to communicate with a central processor inside the
cube. I am not sure about the current feasibility of doing this in
terms of size and cost of available RFID devices. To be able to figure
out location of each cubie may still require some sort of sensors,
though. A cube could scramble itself by having the central processor
tell all the cubies what color each of their facelets should be. Even
though it doesn&#x27;t know where each cubie is, the cube is still
scrambled relative to the position that the cubies have been
mechanically scrambled to. To create &quot;absolute&quot; scrambles, or to have
the cube instantly electronically solve itself, it would need to know
how the cubies have been mechanically moved relative to their &quot;home&quot;
positions.

I was also thinking that infrared transmitters/receivers could be
used. Cubies could &quot;beam&quot; who they are to their neighboring cubies
through holes in the sides of their internal facelets. The information
could be passed from cubie to cubie and eventually work its way to a
central processor connected to one of the center cubies. So no
mechanical sensors are needed for figuring out where the cubies are.
Perhaps an infrared transmitter and receive could be placed on the
outside of a center cubie to allow the central processor to
communicate with an external computer or remote control device. This
would eliminate the need for mechanical switches to control the cube.

These ideas seem to require a certain amount of smarts in each cubie,
so it seems that microcontrollers would be needed in each cubie. I
understand that there are existing RFID modules that have
microcontrollers built in. I think each cubie would have its own
&quot;button&quot; type battery. But with a microcontroller and all the LEDs
(tri-color ones &amp; possibly infrared ones) to power, how long can a
button battery last?

          <div class="email-content">Is there any way that you could attach a rheostat to each center so
that when a face is turned, the resistance of the circuit (and the
amperage which is constant in the circuit) would change which could
signal to the cpu that a face has been turned? The cpu could keep
track of which pieces went where during that turn.

It sounds like theres a few different ideas here for different
electronic cubes. I would like to try to help any way possible, I&#x27;m
not sure exactly what the goal is though.....

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I&#x27;m in the same boat as Chris, although I&#x27;ve not given it up by
choice. I hate getting older, you seem to have less and less time for
fun stuff!

I still know a lot of the T cases, and I really want to make an effort
to know all the T&#x27;s again and the U cases. But at the moment, I am
just practicing the basic speedsolve for the Europeans! I am really
looking forward to the competition :)

I&#x27;m fairly certain that Sune/A-Sune + PLL will prove to be just as
fast as a ZB alg, for the majority of cases. Also, I only execute the
Sune COLL cases now when I know for a fact that it&#x27;s the 1/12 chance
that the edges will solve too.

Ok, clarification/correction:

To see the offer, click on &quot;Reservation&quot; in the top right corner, fill
out the form and submit it (this is not yet a reservation). Then it
should show you the different rates, one of them being a special
cheaper one.

But a moment ago (because someone else had trouble finding it) I tried
it with several arrive/leave dates and it seems to only work from Sep
22 to 25, it&#x27;s called &quot;3 night offer&quot;, though it doesn&#x27;t work for Sep
21 to 24 so maybe it requires to stay the whole weekend? Anyway,
that&#x27;s what I know.

Neither am I. I had stopped talking about this. You called me on it to start discussing it 
again by suggesting that I was wrong and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about. If you want 
me to show you that I do know what I&#x27;m talking about but then try to restrict what I am 
talking about because it might confuse people it&#x27;s hardly a fair challenge. Besides, my post 
was not for the benefit of other people - it was a direct response to you. If you don&#x27;t know 
the terms then it suggests, rather, that you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about. That is 
my point, so I&#x27;m not going to shy away from that. I&#x27;m not forcing others to read this. It&#x27;s 
not really the correct forum but equally I didn&#x27;t want to discuss it again. You brought it up 
and then complained that I replied!

You may think you did but that&#x27;s not quite the same.

Please define this limit. Mathematics is very precise. This seems quite woolly. You aren&#x27;t 
using limit in the usual sense.

If, as it seems, you are taking a subset of an inital segment then obviously not because 
finite sets are not infinite (by definition of infinite), but the set of even numbers is not 
truncated and neither is the set of odd numbers. The word limit has quite a precise 
mathematical meaning - it&#x27;s not to do with truncating or taking initial segments which is 
what you seem to be suggesting.

Do you even know what the definition is?

In ZF, you can define sets A and B to be equinumerous if there is a bijection from A to B 
and the cardinality of A, |A| is defined to be either the least ordinal equinumerous with A 
(in the case that A is well-orderable) or (if A is not well-orderable) the set of all sets in 
bijection with A and having minimal rank (it&#x27;s a subset of V_{rank(A)+1}.

Please tell me where the flaw in either definition is.

To show that any infinite subset A of the natural numbers is equinumerous to the whole 
set of natural numbers one can proceed as follows:

1. first observe that such a set is unbounded. It is easy to show that any bounded subset 
of the natural numbers is finite (that is to say, in bijection with some natural number). 
2. then define by recursion a function f:

f(0) is the least element of A.
f(n+1) is the least element of A greater than f(n)

Since the set of natural numbers is well-ordered, any non-empty subset has a unique least 
element.
As A is infinite it is certainly not empty so f(0) is well-defined.
Since A is unbounded, {m in A:m>=f(n)} is also a non-empty set of natural numbers and 
so has a least element and f(n+1) is well-defined.

Then the function f is defined by recursion (if you need me to I can prove the recursion 
theorem for you (that shows you can define f in this way) and its domain is the set of 
natural numbers. Further f(n)>=n and f:N->A. 
We can show f is injective by showing that for each m and n in the natural numbers with 
m&lt;n we have f(m)&lt;f(n). We can do this by induction. Fix m and prove by induction that 
f(m)&lt;f(m+r+1) for each r. Basically, f(m)&lt;f(m+1) and f(m+r+1)&lt;f(m+(r+1)+1).
If you need me to, I can also prove the induction theorem for you. It&#x27;s a fairly simple 
consequence of the definition of the set of natural numbers.
To show that f is surjective you could at this point use the inclusion map i:A->N and 
invoke the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem. Alternatively, you could argue by 
reductio ad absurdum as follows.
Suppose that f is not surjective. Then for some a in A, there is no n in N with f(n)=a. Now 
f(a)>=a so f(a)>a. Let m be least such that f(m)>a. (m is the least element of the non-
empty set of natural numbers {k:f(k)>a}.)
Since f(0)&lt;=a, m is not 0, so m=r+1 for some r. Then f(r)&lt;=a and f(r)&lt;a. Thus by 
definition f(r+1) is the least element of A greater than f(r) (and hence is &lt;=a). So 
a&lt;=f(m)&lt;a. By reductio ad absurdum f is surjective.
Thus f is a bijection.

So essentially you&#x27;re looking at terms of the sequence pi(n)/n. That&#x27;s the density of primes 
&lt;=n (in {1,..,n}. It&#x27;s not the same as the density of the set of prime numbers. Perhaps 
ultimately you are trying to find an approximation for the asymptotic density.

Neither am I. You called on me to enter this discussion again. I had dropped it as not 
worth continuing. I still don&#x27;t believe it is, but you seem to believe that my reason not to 
continue is that I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about. I do know.
The fact is that the Riemann Hypothesis is relatively sophisticated. It requires some 
mathematical background (although this conversation seems more about the distribution 
of primes than the Riemann Hypothesis).
Since you don&#x27;t even understand concepts of infinity it is difficult to really have  proper 
discussion on these matters.

I can&#x27;t see this is of much interest to other people here (and it&#x27;s not even about the 
Riemann hypothesis anyway - more about the distribution of primes, which the Riemann 
Hypothesis, if true, would give better information on. So again, I am going to drop the 
matter; anyway, it&#x27;s not possible to hold a proper discussion on mathematics with 
someone who doesn&#x27;t accept standard mathematical definitions as making sense.

          <div class="email-content">This is an interesting turn of events... I woke up to an e-mail 
saying that I got an $800 grant for the Fall semester to pursue a 
robotics project of my choosing (if I can get a few other students 
involved here). I&#x27;d have to deliver by the end of December and I 
could get an additional $1000.

This means that the likelyhood of this happening among all this 
speculation just quadrupled.

Ah yes..., the wonders of taking multiple senior design project 
classes. (Engineering students here only need 1 to graduate.) Last 
term I got to design and synthesize a 155Mhz 64-bit processsor, with 
a superscalar 14-stage pipeline, *yikes*.

<br>
I didn&#x27;t complain that you replied. I am complaining that you aren&#x27;t<br>
listening. The math I posted fulfilled your demands at that time, and<br>
made plain what I meant, yet you did not acknowledge it. <br>
<br>
I was graphing the precentage of remaining numbers (from a given prime<br>
number) which aren&#x27;t prime, and the extent to which a percentage of<br>
remaining numbers are prime. The y axis is &quot;one&quot; the x axis takes the<br>
rpimes a step at a time. This is how one stands for infinity - in a<br>
process.<br>
<br>
I also explained to you that I was speaking English. &quot;Finite&quot; and<br>
&quot;infinite&quot; and &quot;limit&quot; have English definitions.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; The numbers themselves are finite. Take all the even numbers separate<br>
&gt; &gt; from the odd numbers - that&#x27;s imposing a limit on them- another finite<br>
&gt; &gt; aspect.<br>
<br>
&gt; Please define this limit. Mathematics is very precise. This seems<br>
quite woolly.<br>
&gt; You aren&#x27;t using limit in the usual sense.<br>
 <br>
It&#x27;s English. I&#x27;m using limit in an English language sense. For<br>
example, the number 1 is a finite unit, the number 2 is a finite unit.<br>
Placing any limitation on an infinite series is adding a finite<br>
element. Cutting something in half is placing a limit on it. There is<br>
no place you can dip into the infinite series of numbers without<br>
calling upon something that is finite.<br>
<br>
Yes, I do understand what you are saying. In this case I am insisting<br>
that infinites come in different sizes. What you are playing with is a<br>
fiction.<br>
<br>
Let A be the odd positive integers, let B be the even positive<br>
integers, let C equal all of the positive integers. A + B = C. Even<br>
numbers + odd numbers equals all of the numbers. C &gt; A; C &gt; B. These<br>
are things that are taught in college math. In this case A is a subset<br>
of C, A is not equal to C.<br>
<br>
To the extent that you would insist that A and B are both the the same<br>
size as C you are mistaken (in this case both A and B &gt; 0). You cut<br>
something in half and say that it&#x27;s not in half, claiming an<br>
overriding ascendency for the concept of infinity. The one to one<br>
correspondence required for a proper subset like A to equal the whole,<br>
C, is missing because A already has a one to one relationship with<br>
itself. <br>
<br>
I made an example make my point: In part you&#x27;ve made it: namely that<br>
this is a number *series*, that is, (for simplicity&#x27;s sake) for every<br>
even number there is an odd number, where one goes the other goes,<br>
too. They stand as equals. (Outside of simplicity this isn&#x27;t strictly<br>
true - sometimes during the series there is one more odd number. This<br>
is another agrument against subset A having a one to one relationship<br>
with C, but I digress)<br>
<br>
Suppose there were a pair of rods in space. Suppose that these rods<br>
are bounded in the y- and z-axes, basically cylindrical, but the<br>
x-axes of the rods are infinite, that is, they stretch without end to<br>
the right and to the left. One of these rods has, say, four times the<br>
diameter of the other rod. The rods are fairly transparent. One rod is<br>
visible inside the other. Where one goes so does the other. <br>
One rod a subset of the other. Even though both rods are infinite in<br>
length, one rod is larger than the other. No matter where you go to<br>
look at these rods, one infinity is larger than the other, even though<br>
there is a one to one correspondence.<br>

quickly.<br>

it was sune :D)<br>

If anyone is interested in how I do this, please let me know. This<br>
solve I actually looked at each F2L pair as a possibility to execute<br>
at any given time. The memo took forever on PLL because I was looking<br>
at the edges all wrong. In the scramble (after I did the y&#x27; at the<br>
beginning) the colours were RED ORANGE on F AND B and Blue and Green<br>
on L and R the OLL had Red and Orange on F and B and Green and Blue on<br>
L and R. So I kept looking at it wrong and the corners for some<br>
reason I kept telling myself was a 2 cycle, duh I&#x27;m stupid :D<br>
<br>
Anyways, I will go again, hopefully get a sub-50 memo time, and a<br>
successful solve, because it bothers me that I&#x27;ve done it right each<br>
time, except not. This one I actually don&#x27;t know what I did wrong, it<br>
may have been that on Pair 2 I did an extra set of R U&#x27; R&#x27; U but I<br>
have no idea.<br>

The point of disagreement is not that different sizes of infinity<br>
exist, just that yours is not an example of it.<br>
<br>
The view most widely accepted by mathematicians is that all infinite<br>
sets that can be mapped onto the set of natural numbers have the same<br>
size of infinity. They therefore view the set of all natural numbers<br>
as having the same infinite size as the set of all odd natural<br>
numbers.<br>
<br>
This view is also the predominant one on Google:<br>
<br>
http://www.google.com/search?q=different+sizes+of+infinity<br>
<br>
I have never heard of your notion of infinity before, and unless you<br>
can explain it with the sort of mathematical rigour that can avoid<br>
ambiguities, it might help if you can instead provide a reference to<br>
some respected webpage that describes your notion.<br>

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s really cool, but could you explain how to do speedBLD?

I&#x27;m not sure if anybody has published any webpage on this feat. I am 
really curious on how this is done. You guys better not be doing 
what I think you are doing and following all the turns *yikes*.

I kinda want to try it. (Might be beyond my ability though.)

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
So since it is highly unlikely that my average will get posted on <br>
UWR listing on speedcubing.com since there is not category for that <br>
yet, I thought I&#x27;d share this with you all. (Anyone else attempt <br>
this yet btw?)<br>
<br>
I normally solve about 25 a day and sometimes 50, so I thought, why <br>
not 100? I did many solves to warm up before doing this and a bunch <br>
afterwards to try to &quot;roll&quot; the average, but my speed declined <br>
severely. It was probably about 150-200 solves consecutively in one <br>
sitting with the exception of a 4hr nap.<br>
<br>
I am trying to train for a 24hr marathon of 500 5x5 solves. No plans <br>
for that happening anytime soon though, just something to look <br>
forward to.<br>
<br>
This was done from 8-21-06 to 8-23-06 (just before midnight on the <br>
21st and after midnight after the 22nd I guess). I have a strange <br>
nocturnal sleep cycle lately...<br>
<br>
My hands felt like they where about to fall off and I was <br>
temporarily blind from doing all that!<br>
<br>
The average turned out to be 2:36.95 for the 100, and I consider it <br>
a non-RA. Among those was a regular average of 2:24.61 so now I&#x27;m in <br>
the illusive 150-club as Clancy puts it. I finally broke the 2:30 <br>
average barrier!!! There was also a 2:06.28 and 2:08.62 as well as <br>
two times over 3-min in the 100.<br>
<br>
Here are the times:<br>
2:33.78 2:48.06 2:59.29 2:34.43 2:36.71 2:31.87 2:35.28 2:34.03 <br>

2:55.03 2:41.46 2:40.54 2:28.99 2:44.21 2:36.74 2:52.21 2:21.30 <br>
2:12.05 2:44.17 2:32.00 2:20.55 2:57.65 2:39.47 2:27.24 2:35.30 <br>
2:26.59 2:40.94 2:22.26 2:30.03 2:27.10 2:34.65 2:25.87 2:39.93 <br>
2:34.29 2:34.59 2:59.34 2:46.69 2:31.56 3:13.75 2:33.10 2:26.95 <br>
2:49.01 2:23.94 2:27.75 2:24.02 2:54.81 2:32.80 2:32.12 2:52.36 <br>

2:46.19 2:35.77 2:20.59 2:38.04<br>
<br>
Pretty much anything goes... I was using ZB, ELL, and a bunch of <br>
crazy stuff. On one solve I saw a 2x2x2 block right after edges for <br>
3 turns and proceeded that way. The 2:12.05 was with parity, the <br>
2:27.75 was with doing a parity alg twice (lol), there where a few <br>
pops I didn&#x27;t record. I had a pop during LL when it was only 2:03 or <br>
so, which would have been a great time. The 2:25.57 was with a <br>
massive pop *AND* parity :).<br>

          <div class="email-content">My brother and I are both right handed and we use our right hands for
one handed cubing.  I dont know why but from the start I felt that it
was better.  Some people I cube with say that the first time they
tried one handed cubing, their left just immediately felt more
dexterous than their right even though they were right handed. 
Another started with his left because &quot;all the fast people did it&quot; and
another friend started with his left because he thought it would
improve his left hand speed which in turn would improve his 2 hand
speed.  I don&#x27;t know why everyone else does it but these may be a few
reasons.

<br>
I have it on video, will post it tomorrow sometime...I&#x27;m a little bit<br>
on Cloud 9 right now...<br>
<br>
Memo time: 37/38 minutes<br>
Solve time: 18.45 seconds<br>
<br>
Ok, so, yah, hyper, me, now, calming down...<br>
<br>
This was surprisingly easy solve.  Just opened Jnet and used the first<br>
scramble that was there.  I smiled when I saw it :D  Tim Reynolds was<br>
talking with me right before I started.  Why is it that you can never<br>
remember the good solves, but you can remember everything about the<br>
bad solves?<br>
<br>
anyways...<br>

Scramble: U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; L&#x27; B2 D2 B&#x27; D&#x27; L&#x27; B D2 U2 B U&#x27; D2 R F2 R2 F&#x27; D&#x27;<br>

That really should be mapped bijectively to the set of natural numbers - because any 
Dedekind infinite set can be mapped onto the set of natural numbers (e.g. the set of real 
numbers) but there are more real numbers than natural numbers (the mapping can never 
be injective).

Can you give an example as to what you mean - because it still isn&#x27;t particularly clear.
For instance, from the given prime 13, can you give me some points on your graph.

Then please can you define what they are. I am primarily a mathematician and to me these 
words may not mean the same as to you.

You appear to be talking subsets, not sizes and union not addition. These things are 
taught way before college maths. These are taught to pre-teens. Cardinality and formal 
definitions of infinity seem to be lacking from your mathematics.

No, I&#x27;m not - it&#x27;s easy to map the set of natural numbers into the set of odd natural 
numbers and leave an infinite amount of numbers over.

You can map the &quot;larger&quot; one into the &quot;smaller&quot; one.

Yep, I thought you might pick me up on that :-)

Please include me in the discussion, and I&#x27;d like to hear more about
infinite cubes after that (which is how this relates back to cubing).

          <div class="email-content">Congratulations Craig :-)

As Geir Ugelstad explained to me and others a few things about
speedblindfold after the Czech Open, I realize how hard this is.

But I have never tried it though, I should...
(Technically you can solve it the way you like, you could use Stefan&#x27;s
blindfold method to solve it but then you get a very bad time ;-). So it is
better to use your speedcubing method because you have a lot less moves.)

Maybe I will give it a go at the Dutch Open later this year... (ok I&#x27;m also
doing multiple blindfolded, my mind will go crazy that day :D)

Congratulations again Craig :-)

Gilles.

why he takes 3+ hours to memorise, and 30+ seconds to solve.  I really
want to do this in competition now...but Where am i going to find a
competition in this half of the world that will let me, and let me
compete in everything else too!!!

I remember doing some move counts for the whole solves back before I
made it more efficient, and it was around 140. Now with improvments
I&#x27;m gonna have to check. I really need to update my website about it :)

I never timed my LL or F3L. I will and I&#x27;ll let you know :)

Just incredible...

Hey, could you also show the number of moves somewhere, too? I know 
the page is quite packed already, so maybe a separate page just for 
results (could open the applet in another window when needed). 
Including number of moves, scramble, solution, exact times, etc. In 
other words, the data that you do have but that is currently hard to 
access for viewers of the page.

<br>
It&#x27;s on my todo list, but I&#x27;m a bit busy at the moment so new<br>
development won&#x27;t be happening for a while.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m also not sure what is the best way to count moves in this context.<br>
If someone does R then rotates the cube so the &quot;R&quot; face is now on top,<br>
and then does &quot;U&quot;, should I count that as two moves or one (i.e. R2)?<br>
<br>
There are many different and interesting metrics that I might consider.<br>
For example, it might be interesting to include cube rotations in the<br>
move count, since they also contribute to the overall length of the<br>
solution.<br>
<br>
There are too many variations to attempt to display them all. Unless, I<br>
provided a way for you to configure your own metric by setting various<br>
parameters.<br>

Hi,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m an Australian film-maker, and I&#x27;m looking for a cuber to be a hand <br>
double of sorts for a short film I&#x27;m shooting next week (Sept 1, 2,<br>
3). The film is set on a Rubik&#x27;s cube gameshow. There are three<br>
characters who are supposed to be able to solve the cube super fast.<br>
<br>
So what I&#x27;m wanting to do is shoot footage of someone&#x27;s hands solving <br>
the cube so I can use it as cutaway material.<br>
<br>
We are shooting in Melbourne, Australia. If there&#x27;s anyone on this<br>
list who&#x27;d like to be involved (or just get more info), and lives in <br>
Melbourne, then don&#x27;t hesitate to email or call me. My email is: <br>
john@... and my mobile is: 0401466620.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m after a guy and a girl. Even if you&#x27;re a medium speed solver,<br>
that&#x27;d be cool, as I can speed it up later on. I&#x27;d just really like to<br>
get footage of nimble fingers at work. And, also, if you&#x27;re into the<br>
idea of hanging around on set during the shoot, it&#x27;d be great to have<br>
a Rubik&#x27;s untangler around for when the actors mess up the cubes<br>
(although we have a stack at different stages of completion) - you<br>
could be credited as &quot;cube wrangler&quot; :-)<br>
<br>
Cheers, John.<br>

          <div class="email-content">You are correct. However, there are two forms of BLD. This would 
called a &quot;speed blindfold solve&quot;. Although it is rarely run as an 
event at competitions, I&#x27;m sure it will be avalible once it becomes 
popular. I think they have run &quot;speedBLD&quot; events in some competitions 
before, I forget which. I actually think that it is much more 
challenging than regular BLD.

It&#x27;s not just you. But hey, they also misrepresent the skills of the 
actors, shouldn&#x27;t they feel insulted, too?

Also that would probably look fake so why don&#x27;t they just let their 
actors scramble a cube and play it sped up backwards?

We should maybe insist that they hire true speedcubers as actors if 
they want to show speedcubing. Just like they hire true aliens for 
science fiction movies.

Cheers!
Stefan

Is that a joke? I didn&#x27;t see the post, obviously, but the idea of
censorship, especially based on something that had a &quot;slightly
condescending tone&quot; that was &quot;probably&quot; not intended, seems to be an
abuse of power.  Especially when it sounds like that opinion could be
subjective.  I am not a fan of censorship in any regard, but the way
this sounds, it is too much.  Does the other speedcubing board take
the same approach to expression?

          <div class="email-content">How do you execute your F3L? Here is how I do it these days:

First layer on bottom, doing one piece at a time (unless I use
tricks). All moves are (RUrl), which is nice and smooth.
Few rotations due to using different algs for inserting a piece
depending on the orientation of the cube. While inserting look for the
next piece. I only have rotations in the y axis now. Tricks include;
directly solving pieces stuck in the F3L if they are in their orbitals
or not, swapping two pieces in the F3L and other misc things like
solving in a way that&#x27;ll give more oppertunities to direct-solve pairs
 and split pairs at once.

And yes, my last layer still needs work :( I&#x27;m still scoping out a
better method.

I didn&#x27;t mean to be condescendant but I thought that before posting such a
message in this (long) discussion, the person should have reconsidered his
point and looked for more information. (I might have been influenced by my
forum moderation experience that led me in the past to simply delete posts
or ban users for such messages - the admin had very strict regulations :p)

Obviously the person didn&#x27;t know the difference between the two kinds of
blindfold solving and I thought that by saying that the person would look
for more information.
But then I should have been more friendly and just explained the difference
(which would have been faster for that person anyway).

However, I think that before posting and saying that something is
incorrect, trying to find some information to argue and explain a point is a
good idea. (On the contrary, if I want to be funny about something, I make
sure it is clear that it is funny and that it is not taken seriously in the
discussion.)

I don&#x27;t pretend to have the full-complete-perfect knowledge, but following
this guide-line would help prevent a bunch of problems like this.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug,

Yeah, Ryan Heise is in Australia, but he&#x27;s in Sydney, which is quite a
long way from Melboune (as-the-crow-flies, it&#x27;s 713kms/443 miles). So
unless they are offering to send a plane ticket, I don&#x27;t think a Sydney
cuber can help.

The few cubers I&#x27;ve heard of in Australia are in and around Sydney. When
I&#x27;m in Australia, I&#x27;m based in Canberra, which is a little closer to
Melbourne, but not that close (about a 7hr drive). And I&#x27;m in London at
the moment anyway, so I&#x27;m a long way away!

Locating a female cuber is difficult enough, but locating one in a
specific location is probably close to impossible!!

I wouldn&#x27;t be worried about the &#x27;misrepresenting your skills&#x27; issue
unless it was a video about my cubing skills. If it&#x27;s just file footage,
I wouldn&#x27;t care too much. I did some footage for the BBC news a few
months ago and they wanted to fiddle around with some of it. They
apologised to me because they thought I&#x27;d be concerned, but I told them
they could do what they like with it because it wasn&#x27;t a news item
*about* cubing, it was about something entirely unrelated and they just
wanted some cubing in the background for parts of the news story.

          <div class="email-content">Well, I know you didn&#x27;t agree about a similair thing, but I think it
is still faster: Don&#x27;t solve the corners of the 1st layer right away.
After centers and last edge of the 1st layer, do a F2L kind of thing.
Make pairs and insert. The chance of easy cases has increased greatly
because of the number of edges to chose from. So you will only need to
do half of the edges after this.

          <div class="email-content">Excellent question, I had always been wondering about this and had 
asked Chris a few times about it. He&#x27;s been quite busy lately and so 
in his absence, I&#x27;m going to try to answer this as best as possible, 
although I am looking forward to an answer from the man himself as 
well as Stefan.

Certainly it does make for fewer decisions. On the 5x5 (and odd order 
cubes) you almost have to start with a set orientaiton. For the 4x4 
(and other even order cubes) you gain some freedom. One thing that can 
be done for the 4x4 (and I like to do it on the 2x2) is to start with 
an orientation that has my last/8th corner fully solved in place.

I forget what Chris likes to do about the initial whole cube  
orientaiton. The approach that Chris likes to do, since he memorizes 
centers first, is to find lengthy center cycles in order to create 
fewer &quot;journeys&quot; as he calls them. This in turn leads to less 
confusion as it is the piece of information that he keeps memorized 
the longest.

So to get to the point..., for Chris, it does take him more time to 
solve super-versions of the 4x4 and 5x5. I forget exactly, but I think 
it&#x27;s something along the lines of 5 minutes more for the 4, and 10 
minutes more for the 5, but this could have changed in the last few 
months. I&#x27;m not sure if he has a Cubesmith stickered, regular sized 
5x5 however. I know I don&#x27;t, despite always having the stickers around 
and five rubiks brand 5x5s at my disposal. He does have an Eastsheen 
5x5 that he &quot;supered&quot; by numbering, which he could be slower on than a 
regular brand one. I&#x27;m not sure, I guess we have to wait for him to 
answer.

I have solved a 4x4 BLD once or twice several months ago and try to 
optimize for long center cycles, but I used a different memorization 
technique. I think that short edgey cycles are unavoidable, or at 
least we have nevered done anything special about it.

The point is..., that you end up doing fewer turns (in general) to 
solve a non-super version compared to a super-version, while the extra 
amount of &quot;thinking&quot; is only slightly greater. If it is the case that 
you solve centers last, that is.

For me in the past, super cubes felt easier. At RWC 2005 just 
analyzing and memorizing the X-centers (or +-centers?) took me 45 
minutes cause I got confused over and over again. The super cube is 
easy to read. However, I recently tried 4x4 BLD and the centers were 
easy around 9 minutes without changing my method. So maybe (read 
&quot;probably&quot;) I was just an idiot back then. But I still have way too 
little experience to judge which is easier. Just try it and see it for 
yourself :-)

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Well thanks a lot.  I was more so curious.  It just hit me because I 
saw your record on your site Stephan.  And I was wondering if I should 
order supercube stickers anyway.  That would have been the key.

I think I&#x27;ll just continue to focus on 3x3x3 BLD, I&#x27;m getting faster 
with my primary method.  I&#x27;m trying to get CP a lot faster though.  

I&#x27;m developing different things and trying to apply them to BLD as I 
go along.  This includes:

Simul Block (Corner and Edge Simultaneously)
Optimal CP (applied)
Roux Cycles (several successful attempts)
3-Cycle CP (no CO needed)
2 Look EO

I did an avg of 12 on my CP, I&#x27;ve gotten it down to a 45s avg using 
optimal setups (1 face turn)

I&#x27;m also training finger strength w/ my Barrel Cube ... it&#x27;s so tense
 ... I&#x27;m using my left hand a lot on it.

Hopefully I&#x27;ll see results!

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

I just saw this thread and was really interested in it and wanted to post.

Yes I haven&#x27;t been posting much lately because I&#x27;ve been working, a
LOT (7 days a week with the occasional day off) to try to pay off my
student loan payments which just started recently.

As for BLD for the bigger cubes vs. bigger super cubes this is just my
personal opinion and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s based on my memorization method and
solving method, but I find the bigger super cubes to be much harder to
memorize, but not really any harder to solve.

The reason is that with the bigger super cubes I lose all options of
memorizing and solving using center piece blocks, which I use quite
frequently on the regular big cubes BLD.  By center blocks I mean
purposefully cycling center pieces to the incorrect faces to form 3x1
blocks on the 5x5 or 2x1 blocks on the 4x4, then at the end of the
centers cycling the center piece blocks as if they were each one
single piece.  On a big cube supercube this is very rarely possible,
so I&#x27;m forced to just memorize each piece individually and can&#x27;t
combine any into a block to speed up memorization.  As for solving a
bigger supercube I use the same method exactly, only there are more
cycles since a piece can now be on the correct face, but not be in the
correct location of the possible 4 (for centers).

To answer Doug&#x27;s question I have a similar approach to how I start
memorizing the 4x4 and 5x5 for the regular big cubes BLD.  For the
4x4x4 I always define my orientation to be that the front face is
green, and the top face is yellow.  When I am given a scrambled cube I
rotate it so that as many center pieces as possible are already on
their correct faces based on my already defined scheme of always
solving green to the front face and yellow to the top face.  I can
almost always get at a minimum 7 (occasionaly 6 or even as low as 5),
but I&#x27;ve had as high as 10-11 before too if you find the right
orientation of the cube out of the 24.

I also look for any opportunities to create 2x1 blocks with my cycles
to memorize more pieces with one image rather than each piece
individually.

For the 5x5x5 it&#x27;s not as free, I just rotate the green central most
center to the F face and the yellow central most center to the U face.
 I then look for any possible options to create 3x1 blocks with my
cycling, then I start memorizing.  If no block opportunities exist
(much more likely on 5x5 than 4x4) then I just memorize each piece
individually with no tricks.

So the short version, for me supercubes are harder because I can&#x27;t do
any tricks to memorize them quicker.  I just have to brute force my
way through it compared to the regular cubes where I try to take every
shortcut I possibly can during memorization.

Hope this helps, don&#x27;t let the bigger supercubes BLD discourage you. 
Because they are harder, again that&#x27;s just in my opinion, it is also
more satisfying to solve one than for the regular cubes, but again
that is just my own personal opinion.

I use a hybrid, I like the way you approach the F3L, this is what I 
have been doing for that move count average

1. opposing centers
2. 6 edge pair (made w/centers on R&amp;L faces)
    2a. 4 edge to complete a cross, and two pr NOT on the LL
3. complete centers (4x3x1 blocks on R&amp;L faces, no corners) *Roux 
style*
4. make cross, put on bottom
5. put corners/edges in place 
6. LL

I timed a few solves and averaged about 3:15, not bad considering 
with the centers/edges/3x3 approach I average about 3:20  (i have 
not practiced much at all on my 4x4 or 5x5)

have you tried you method on the 5x5?
I tried my method and it works well, just that LL still.

I think &#x27;the&#x27; method for corners first is Waterman&#x27;s. JJ averages
sub-20 with this method I think? I&#x27;d learn every algorithm for it but
it isn&#x27;t down in any notation, just java anims. :(

I see three types.

LBL, Block and CF.

Each is a different family of methods, and contained within are basic

For example, Fridrich is derived from the basic LBL method, so it&#x27;s
called an LBL method, even though it does not do one layer then the

Waterman is derived from the basic CF method, so I class it as a
corners first method.

Don&#x27;t you think this type of definition suits things better?

I see how you say that its a LBL system.  Because you do the Left
layer then the Right Layer, then the middle layer.  

CFOP you solve 4 edges and then 4 corners (along with their edges)
WATERMAN you solve 4 corners first and then 4 edges.

I think that the Waterman system is definetely a Corners First System.

You first solve 4 corners
Then 4 Edges

Then solve 4 more corners 
THen 2 edges
Then 6 edges (kind of)


GILLES
IF YOU CAN DO ALL THE CORNERS IN 5 SEC, CAN YOU USE WATERMAN TO AVG 15
SEC? is that your thought?
5 for CORners, 10 for edges?


I think I can avg sub 25 with it....


Jason




SOME people consider CLL/ELL, &quot;corners first&quot;
SO is Roux, &quot;corners first?&quot;

Then how come the two &quot;puzzles&quot; on the site just bored me? That&#x27;s the 
only thing that boggles me, since they together took me like 20 
seconds. The only thing shaking is my head, though yes, that could be 
considered my core.

I made Excel macro to assist scarmbling for 4x4 and 5x5. <br>

You only need to put your scarmbling algorithm, then push the <br>

<br>
You will get not only figure of each move but the condition of U and <br>

I hope this would help expert, intermediate, and beginner scarmblers <br>

I recommend you check out the US Puzzle and Sudoku Championships

of a style I&#x27;ve never seen before.

I&#x27;m currently working my way through the 2006 championship test; 
instructions to download it are at:

I&#x27;ve worked out an algorithm for a computer solver for the 4x4x4 <br>
(actually I&#x27;ve got 2 variations) They work by matching up the edges <br>
and solving the centers and then simply solving like a 3x3x3. They <br>
average slightly over 60 moves stm but the solutions can be made even <br>
shorter by upgrading the Thistlethwaite portions to a Kociemba-style <br>

Actually, Nick Baxter, the captain of the US Puzzle team was at the
Exploratorium on the last day, and he handed out the awards.  I can&#x27;t
remember if you made it to the competition on Sunday or not.

Still the same kind of &quot;puzzle&quot;, you just made the difference smaller. 
I still don&#x27;t see what it has to do with being &quot;smart&quot;. It did make me 
clean my display, though, thanks for that.

What&#x27;s your average record for solving the Rubik&#x27;s Cube?

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Waterman&#x27;s method can be considered pure Corners-first.
The main reason for that is that you can solve all corners first 
before starting solving edges without any change to the sequences 
used or a method itself except for swapping two steps.

The reason Marc solved one layer completely first was probably 
because he was used to do it like that. It is sometimes (often) easy 
to see how to put some edges (and a center) to the first layer during 
completing the first four corners, so reducing the number of turns 
required for the first layer.. CLL sequences used preserve the first 
layer... Personally, I solve all corners first + some obvious edges 
of the first layer...

One of the previous messages gave the remaining steps a bit wrong.
After all corners and left layer solved the remaining steps are:
A) solve 2 redges (R-edges) in one step while at least one of the 
remaining redges should go/stay in the R-layer
B) solve the remaining redges and orient midges (M-edges) in one step
C) permute midges
special rare cases:
A1) all redges in M-layer (2 case classes) - solve 3 redges and go to 
B
A2) 3 or 4 redges form a cycle in R-layer - solve 2 redges by 3-cycle 
sequence in R-layer and go to B

The additional requirement in A and the A1, A2 steps are used to 
reduce the number of sequences in B.
I think that it is doable without them... The increase of the number 
of sequences in B would not be so bad (for contemporary cubers :-
) )...

There is one modification (used by Marc):
if putting the 4th edge into the first layer would not be fast (4+ 
moves, or not visible), solve 2 redges (one by one) using the L hole, 
then solve redge+ledge by an easy sequence, and solve the last redge 
while orienting midges, finally permute midges...

I hope it helps...

http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/magic.htm has some info 
about it under the heading &quot;Getting back to the starting position&quot;.

Very cool! I was not there on Sunday, so I missed Mr. Baxter. I 
probably wouldn&#x27;t have realized who he was, either - it&#x27;s only 
during August that I&#x27;ve gotten interested in the US Puzzle 
Championships (and associated puzzles).

I definitely recommend that folks on this group check out the 
various puzzles on the website (wpc.puzzles.com) - they&#x27;re quite fun 
and challenging. You&#x27;ve got a whole year until the next contest, so 
there&#x27;s plenty of time to practice!

The site is specific to the US championship, but anyone can 
participate in the contest. I also assume there are similar 
championships in other countries (given the large number of 
countries in the world championships, as noted at 
http://www.worldpuzzle.org/).

puzzle on,

yeff

me get to the solution, so I decided to disassemble it and 
restringing it.
Now that I&#x27;ve finished adding the 8th basic string, strictly 
following the guidelines, I tried to solve it slowly, but the second

I get to the solved position, but not considering the pattern, only 
if I turn the puzzle upside-down and repeat the same movements. But 
the V shape doesn&#x27;t display the correct pattern.
What can I do? Do I have to disassemble it again and restringing it

Please, help me.

          <a class="header-link" href="#msg-1567"><strong>1567. Re: algorithms for computer solving the 4x4x4</strong></a><br>
          <em>From:</em> &quot;Bruce Norskog&quot; &lt;brnorsk@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Fri, 01 Sep 2006 15:54:26 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">This is very similar in nature to my 4x4x4 computer method. Tsai used
7 or 8 stages while I used only 5. Still he seems to be getting very
close to the typical number of moves that I get with my solver (in the
neighborhood of 60). While I decided to look at a multi-stage solution
ending with the &quot;4x4x4 squares coset,&quot; it&#x27;s interesting to see that
someone else has looked into using a different set of stages. In this
case, the later stages eliminate the inner slice moves altogether, so
that these later stages are like solving a 3x3x3.

I had suspected Tsai did something like an IDA* search for each step
since he didn&#x27;t show any tables giving numbers of positions of a given
distance from the goal state for each step. It would be nice to have
worst-case number of moves for each step, but that would require
carrying out a God&#x27;s algorithm calculation, or running his IDA* search
for every effectively unique position of each step. I would have to
believe that for the 7-stage (or 8-stage) method, they would add up to
more than 79, the value I got from my 5-stage method. Fewer stages
should result in a lower worst case value.

I note that like the current version of my solver, it appears that
Tsai&#x27;s solver does not optimize across the stage boundaries. For
instance, if the last move of one stage is F, and the first move of
the next stage is F2, it does not combine the two moves to become F&#x27;.
This simple optimization technique could be used to make a small
decrease in the number of moves used on average.

Since the 4x4x4 does not have fixed centers, step 1 would only need to
put the R and L centers on any opposite faces, not necessarily the R
and L faces. Of course, then either an explicit cube reorientation
would need to be applied so that those faces become the R and L faces,
or the moves for the rest of solution must be remapped accordingly.
That is, the solver could reorient the cube for its internal workings,
but would output the moves so that they correspond to the initial
orientation of the cube. That is what my solver does. So the solved
cube may end up with the colors in a different orientation, but it&#x27;s
still considered solved. With my solver, the cube may end up in any of
the 24 possible orientations. I haven&#x27;t checked Tsai&#x27;s examples, but
from his description, I am guessing he forces each color to end up on
a specific face.

One other thing I noticed is that in step 4, front and back face
layers are restricted to half-turns, but in step 5, quarter turns of
those layers are allowed again. (In the 8-step version, this applies
to right and left face layers as well, half-turns in step 3 and 4, but
quarter turns allowed again in step5.) So his method doesn&#x27;t have the
property that every step uses only a subset of moves of prior steps,
although I think this is the only exception to that.

I think it should be possible to create a solver for the 4x4x4 using
only four stages, and perhaps only three stages, using an IDA* type of
search in each stage. It perhaps may be a challenge to get good
quality pruning tables for all stages to be compact enough to all fit
in memory at the same time. It might be interesting to know how much
memory is used for pruning tables in Tsai&#x27;s program. Because of the
number of stages, I am guessing he doesn&#x27;t need very large tables and
they all reside in memory at the same time.

As for solving by humans, Ryan Heise once looked at developing a
&quot;human version&quot; of the Thistlethwaite algorithm. See message 5113. So
it may be possible to extend that idea to the 4x4x4-specific steps of
Tsai&#x27;s method (or my method as well). Of course, a computer can
calculate the parity of the edges faster than a human can, so avoiding
the parity issues may still be a problem as it seems to be with other
4x4x4 methods that simplify the 4x4x4 to a 3x3x3.

          <div class="email-content">You do have to disassemble and reassemble it at this point.

Also, you need 16 strings for a 2x4 sized magic NOT 8. It is also 
important to note the type of magic insert you have.

If it is Homer or Harry Poter than the writting should be correct-
side-up. If it is an red/orangy colored inser then start upside-down.

With everything front-side-up, put it together *dry* (no strings). 
Line everything up and then proceed with the stringing.

The very outermost corner grooves should have no strings on the 
front side.

In the &quot;ring state&quot; there should be exactly one metal clip per side 
of tile and 16 of them total when properly assembled.

The manufacture string goes one further and makes sure that in the 
starting-state the clips are also well distributed.

Any how, I perfer to start in on the right 3 tiles on the bottom 
row, and place two strings on them so that those 3 alone form a 1x3 
fully funcitonal magic. The srings should run from top left corner 
to bottom right on the very lower right tile. Then I expand by 
placeing the top left tile to the right of it upside-down and add 2 
more strings to make it a 1x4 magic. And so forth until I end up 
with a 1x7 magic. Next I add the bottom left tile to the right of it 
all to make a 1x8 magic. Then I wrap everything around in a loop and 
use 4 more strings to close it up.

          <em>From:</em> &quot;ct&quot; &lt;c_w_tsai@...&gt;<br>

          <div class="email-content"><br>
&gt; This is very similar in nature to my 4x4x4 computer method. Tsai <br>
used<br>
&gt; 7 or 8 stages while I used only 5. Still he seems to be getting <br>
very<br>
&gt; close to the typical number of moves that I get with my solver (in <br>
the<br>
&gt; neighborhood of 60). While I decided to look at a multi-stage <br>
solution<br>
&gt; ending with the &quot;4x4x4 squares coset,&quot; it&#x27;s interesting to see that<br>
&gt; someone else has looked into using a different set of stages. In <br>
this<br>
&gt; case, the later stages eliminate the inner slice moves altogether, <br>
so<br>
&gt; that these later stages are like solving a 3x3x3.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I had suspected Tsai did something like an IDA* search for each <br>
step<br>
&gt; since he didn&#x27;t show any tables giving numbers of positions of a <br>
given<br>
&gt; distance from the goal state for each step. It would be nice to <br>
have<br>
&gt; worst-case number of moves for each step, but that would require<br>
&gt; carrying out a God&#x27;s algorithm calculation, or running his IDA* <br>
search<br>
&gt; for every effectively unique position of each step. I would have to<br>
&gt; believe that for the 7-stage (or 8-stage) method, they would add <br>
up to<br>
&gt; more than 79, the value I got from my 5-stage method. Fewer stages<br>
&gt; should result in a lower worst case value.<br>
<br>
Maybe. But it ends up solving like a 3x3x3, which I found really <br>
attractive, and there has been extensive work done with that. <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I note that like the current version of my solver, it appears that<br>
&gt; Tsai&#x27;s solver does not optimize across the stage boundaries. For<br>
&gt; instance, if the last move of one stage is F, and the first move of<br>
&gt; the next stage is F2, it does not combine the two moves to become <br>
F&#x27;.<br>
&gt; This simple optimization technique could be used to make a small<br>
&gt; decrease in the number of moves used on average.<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
That&#x27;s true. I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the effort. :) Probably a <br>
savings of 2 or 3 moves max.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; Since the 4x4x4 does not have fixed centers, step 1 would only <br>
need to<br>
&gt; put the R and L centers on any opposite faces, not necessarily the <br>
R<br>
&gt; and L faces. Of course, then either an explicit cube reorientation<br>
&gt; would need to be applied so that those faces become the R and L <br>
faces,<br>
&gt; or the moves for the rest of solution must be remapped accordingly.<br>
&gt; That is, the solver could reorient the cube for its internal <br>
workings,<br>
&gt; but would output the moves so that they correspond to the initial<br>
&gt; orientation of the cube. That is what my solver does. So the solved<br>
&gt; cube may end up with the colors in a different orientation, but <br>
it&#x27;s<br>
&gt; still considered solved. With my solver, the cube may end up in <br>
any of<br>
&gt; the 24 possible orientations. I haven&#x27;t checked Tsai&#x27;s examples, <br>
but<br>
&gt; from his description, I am guessing he forces each color to end up <br>
on<br>
&gt; a specific face.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s correct. My solver doesn&#x27;t consider the cube solved unless <br>
it&#x27;s in a very specific orientation. You&#x27;d have to do it manually <br>
for all 24 orientations. :S<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; One other thing I noticed is that in step 4, front and back face<br>
&gt; layers are restricted to half-turns, but in step 5, quarter turns <br>
of<br>
&gt; those layers are allowed again. (In the 8-step version, this <br>
applies<br>
&gt; to right and left face layers as well, half-turns in step 3 and 4, <br>
but<br>
&gt; quarter turns allowed again in step5.) So his method doesn&#x27;t have <br>
the<br>
&gt; property that every step uses only a subset of moves of prior <br>
steps,<br>
&gt; although I think this is the only exception to that.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I thought it was interesting that you could not allow certain <br>
moves in a step and then allow it again later. <br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I think it should be possible to create a solver for the 4x4x4 <br>
using<br>
&gt; only four stages, and perhaps only three stages, using an IDA* <br>
type of<br>
&gt; search in each stage. It perhaps may be a challenge to get good<br>
&gt; quality pruning tables for all stages to be compact enough to all <br>
fit<br>
&gt; in memory at the same time. It might be interesting to know how <br>
much<br>
&gt; memory is used for pruning tables in Tsai&#x27;s program. Because of the<br>
&gt; number of stages, I am guessing he doesn&#x27;t need very large tables <br>
and<br>
&gt; they all reside in memory at the same time.<br>
<br>
For the 8-step algorithm, only about 80 kB. Several hundred kB for <br>
the 7-step. But I still haven&#x27;t got good tables for the 2nd step of <br>
the 7-step (factor on the order of 10^11). I still need to think of <br>
better tables for that... I found that sometimes it would find a <br>
solution very quickly (like a second) while other times I could let <br>
it search for an hour and still not find a solution (probably due to <br>
my not-so-good tables and maybe the solution was too deep) What I <br>
ended up doing was: limit the step 2 search to a maximum depth of 9 <br>
and if there was no solution found, it goes to the next step 1 <br>
solution. I liked how it worked so i did the same with the 8-step <br>
algorithm with a max depth of 8. My 7-step solver takes about half a <br>
minute, the 8-step one takes like 5 to 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; As for solving by humans, Ryan Heise once looked at developing a<br>
&gt; &quot;human version&quot; of the Thistlethwaite algorithm. See message 5113. <br>
So<br>
&gt; it may be possible to extend that idea to the 4x4x4-specific steps <br>
of<br>
&gt; Tsai&#x27;s method (or my method as well). Of course, a computer can<br>
&gt; calculate the parity of the edges faster than a human can, so <br>
avoiding<br>
&gt; the parity issues may still be a problem as it seems to be with <br>
other<br>
&gt; 4x4x4 methods that simplify the 4x4x4 to a 3x3x3.<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
I also thought of Ryan&#x27;s human thistlethwaite version :)<br>

The answer is: the thumbs of the man in the &quot;Mayfield&quot; shirt have 
obviously been digitally manipulated, because they look like they 
are inhumanly long.

I mean, I have very prehensile thumbs, but he&#x27;s got me beat.

I could be mistaken here but I don&#x27;t quite follow.
You refer to your friend as non-puzzle inclined, but if the magic is messed up you can&#x27;t 
solve it? Isn&#x27;t that the challenge of  puzzle (as opposed to following the exact same 
sequence of moves from A to B each time)?
I think you should rejoice in your friend that the magic was made a puzzle again, rather 
than simply a test of speed and dexterity.

game is to match the tags that you assign to a random image, together

This is a nice way of google to get everyone who is crazy enough to play
this game (us) to categorize their enormous image database. So in fact
we&#x27;re all working for Google here.  Unfortunately you can&#x27;t see who you
were racing with, only their nickname is shown.

Getting into the highscore just requires a lot of stamina since the

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I feel that a 7/8 step solver would make up much smaller pruning 
tables, and it should be able to run on computers with less (normal)
memory (?). A slightly longer solution on average should also 
indicate a shorter solution time?

Also, letting the solver not solve optimally at each step will allow 
increasingly better solutions to be found. I estimate that sub-100 
solutions can be found rapidly :-)

Charles&#x27;methods are also somewhat closer in nature to the normal 
pairing-up methods compared with Bruce&#x27;s 5-stage method. How about 
relaxing number of stages to an even higher number? Will we be able 
to approach a &quot;humanly doable&quot; method with a &quot;decent&quot; maximum number 
of moves overall ??

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

I have been thinking a little about solving the 3x3x3 cube by only 
using the moves (generators) R and u, where u would mean turning the 
top 2 layers. So u = U E&#x27; obviously :-) (For those who know MES 
notation!) Otherwise u is well-known fingertrick notation too!

What i have come up with so far is a short 2-flip on edges like so:

(R u2)*2 R&#x27; u2 R&#x27; u (R&#x27; u2)*2 R u2 R u&#x27;

And also a non-disclosed edge 3-cycle of same length (challenge).
Could we together make up a collection of useful algs to completely 
solve the &lt;R,u> group effectively?

I know that the more complex &lt;r,u> subgroup has been discussed 
before and that some useful longish algs came up. But i cannot 
recall where this was discussed, and how long ago. Anyone can direct 
me towards this previous discussion?

Cheers!

I propose a corners first method.

The corners can be solved really easily much like a 2x2x2, then you
can use 3-cycles/flips to change the edges.

Thx for the useful input :-P

Btw i didn&#x27;t/don&#x27;t intend a &lt;R,u> solving approach for normal 3x3x3 
speedsolving. Just as a separate fun challenge. Just like &lt;U,R>, 
bld, oh, feetsolving and so on are variations to normal solving :-)

Have fun!

-Per

PS! I&#x27;m aware that Stefan Pochmann has looked a lot into &lt;U,u,R,r> 
solving on the 4x4x4 cube. That is quite different though. And i 
received useful input from Gilles Roux :-)

          <div class="email-content">Ah, ok.  That would be fun.

I thought you meant having a method where using &lt;R,u> is useful, but 
you don&#x27;t use it all of the time.

What would the challenge be?  Fastest time to solve using &lt;R,u>?  
Least amount of moves?

          <div class="email-content">Contact Cubesmith, he was selling them in SF. I got a set for 
myself, they worked out pretty good. They come with a few spares for 
each face. I don&#x27;t see them on his site though, so I guess you&#x27;ll 
have to e-mail him.

I have two keychain cubes now, they are really cute... wonder if 
he&#x27;ll ever make them in light blue and pink like the regular one.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

The challenge was just to find a useful short edge 3-cycle. I can 
tell now that only 2 moves are different from the 2-flip i already 
gave out ;-)

But yes, it&#x27;d be interesting to be able to solve the &lt;R,u> group 
reasonably fast or reasonably efficiently movewise.

Cheers!

Back when I couldn&#x27;t find any stores that sold the octagonal barrel, I got desperate and created one out of my first cube. I filled the 12 shaved cubies with plastic wood. And I used electrician&#x27;s tape for the four additional colors.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Two-layer moves imply that some of the centers are &quot;moved.&quot; If centers
are considered to be movable, the centers themselves can&#x27;t be used as
your frame of reference for the moves. So you must be using an
&quot;external&quot; reference frame instead. When such an external reference
frame is used, you can not arbitrarily use cube rotations, otherwise a
simple move such as R (along with arbitrary cube rotations) would
allow generating any cube position.

So in the group &lt;R, u>, the cubies in the FD, LD, BD, LFD and BLD
positions never move with respect to the external reference frame.
(This does not mean they stay &quot;solved&quot; with respect to proper
alignment with the centers, since the centers (well, in this case 4 of
them) can move with respect to the external reference frame.)

You could include cube rotations in the list of generators for such a
group. The group &lt;R, u, y> specifically allows the whole cube to be
rotated horizontally, for instance, in addition to R and u moves. This
group, if I don&#x27;t have any mistakes in my GAP simulation, contains all
cube positions (in 4 out of the 24 orientations).

I think Per may be looking for algs that might be useful in solving a
3x3x3, although clearly you would also need to use cube rotations in
between the execution of such algs, to be able to completely solve an
arbitrarily scrambled cube. The &lt;R, u> group is much bigger than the
&lt;R, U> group. I calculate that it is 18,432 times bigger, after
dividing by four to adjust for the extra orientations of the &lt;R, u>
group. So you can solve more positions with R and u than with R and U,
and some positions may be more efficiently solved with R and u than
with R and U.

          <div class="email-content">I would definitely prefer to skip OLL, for a couple of reasons.

When solving the final F2L pair, I am usually at most moving 2 layers
of the cube only, + maybe a 3rd layer turns a couple of times. So with
not too many pieces moving, and with careful watching, you can see a
tiny bit before it happens that you are going to get an OLL skip, and
can ready yourself for PLL.

Also, if you skip PLL, it is a lot less often that I would see that
this is going to happen before it actually does, because I am
executing OLL at full speed. So if a PLL skip occurs, it can come as
quite a shock, and it takes a second or so to adjust your thinking and
get the U layer aligned correctly.

Ron told me at a meeting that he &quot;heard&quot; when Joel had a PLL skip,
because he heard furious turning (during the OLL), and suddenly it all
stopped for a second, and then Joel slammed the cube down.

So I vote to skip OLL, because you can react far quicker to that and
lose less time than if you skip PLL.

          <div class="email-content">I use Petrus, so there are only 7 OLL cases. They are really easy to
recognize and fast, so I prefer skipping PLL. Even though it&#x27;s easy to
see if OLL skip is coming and work for it, I can also see if I&#x27;ll get
a PLL-skip. If I used Fridrich, it would be harder to decide which
skip is better. Of course, the best option is to skip both... lol

And as most of very fast speedcubers trained on fast recognition, I

Wouldn&#x27;t it be possible to somehow train for that &quot;22nd&quot; PLL case ?

          <div class="email-content">You can think about it by also counting the number of ways in which you can
have a PLL skip or a Z-perm.  For PLL, you have four different states.  It&#x27;s
really one state (the solved one), but you might need to fix it up by a U,
U&#x27;, or U2 so you have four.  For Z-perm, you have two different sets.  On a
standard BOY color scheme, there&#x27;s the red/blue orange/green z-perm or the
red/green blue/orange z-perm.  So 8 states if you count U, U&#x27;, and U2
corrections.  I guess just divide the number of states, (4 or 8) over the
total number of LL-permute states... and that&#x27;s the answer.

          <div class="email-content">Regarding Gilles&#x27; original question...well, I don&#x27;t know.<br>
It seems weird, since PLL skip is easily identified from 2 sides--<br>
unlike most other PLLs, you only need to learn one viewpoint instead <br>
of four.  Some examples are the G perms, for instance, which look <br>
vastly different from the different ways of looking at two sides--<br>
therefore, one must learn how each one looks from the four different <br>
directions.<br>
<br>
Maybe the time gained by not doing a PLL justifies the lack of <br>
preparedness?  Maybe people think &quot;oh, it&#x27;s a PLL skip&quot; after thinking <br>
through any other possible cases--for instance, U perm, F perm, J <br>
perm, which all have big blocks of solved pieces.  I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ve <br>
never really thought about it before now<br>
<br>
Who was it that made a PLL recognition spreadsheet recently?  Maybe <br>
the PLL skip should be one of the cases.<br>
<br>
Tim<br>
<br>
&gt;And as most of very fast speedcubers trained on fast recognition, I<br>
&gt;also find it interesting that recognizing a PLL-Skip takes much longer<br>
&gt;than any other case.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t it be possible to somehow train for that &quot;22nd&quot; PLL case ?<br>

Hey guys, I&#x27;ve been working on getting my BLD times down a lot.  
I&#x27;m learning new things daily, and working on concepts.

The fastest Cycle I could come up with was this ... seriously too.

M&#x27;U2MU2, and any isomorphic M Slice Case thereof.

This would be a two step for solving the edges EO and EP.
It is possible to do direct EP, but setups take a little more 
thought.

Dir = Direct = No EO
Indir = Indirect = An EO step
2x = Permuting 2 Edges per Cycle
Slice Cycles can be used for, Dir, 2xDir, Indir, and 2xIndir on the 
edges.  I&#x27;ve achieved sub-10 BLD w/ 2xIndir, I&#x27;ll try the other 
three options.

Ahhh I think I just realized how this can work.  Well, we&#x27;re doing 
all these cycles, if we do Direct or Indirect Solving piece by piece,
It is possible to solve the edges with this method:
Set, M&#x27;U2MU2, Reset
Set, U2M&#x27;U2M, Reset
Set, M&#x27;U2MU2, Reset
Set, U2M&#x27;U2M, Reset
etc.

Anybody interested, please look at it.  Thanks

Later,
Daniel Beyer

--- End forwarded message ---

I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but by using the 

Set, M&#x27;U2MU2, Reset
Set, U2M&#x27;U2M, Reset
Set, M&#x27;U2MU2, Reset
Set, U2M&#x27;U2M, Reset
etc.
method works very well for piece by piece indirect or direct solving!

Indirect solving takes two move sets
Direct solving takes three move sets

I&#x27;m not going into detail, but does work very nicely

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s a big problem that your last step (permute M-slice) disturbs
center orientation. I think it&#x27;s best to just ignore it until
everything else is solved and then orient the centers. I know one very
fast way to do that, no need to learn algorithms. Rotate the cube so
that M-slice becomes E-slice (to make moves easier to perform). Then
just orient the F-center using M&#x27; U M, M&#x27; U&#x27; M or M&#x27; U2 M, depending
on the case, and use E/E&#x27;/E2 to bring another unsolved center to F.
Repeat until the cube is solved.

Johannes: Brilliant! I was doing the same thing, only with the T-perm
instead of those simple algs, that&#x27;s a great idea!

For a while, I&#x27;ve been using CFOP to do this, but this new idea might
be quite a good one for me :)

trying to get 18 second averages, you&#x27;ll hear it again.  When you&#x27;re at 17
and you want to drop to 15, you&#x27;ll hear it again.

The simple idea is to slow down so you can actually move ahead.  Try doing a
solve where you move only as fast as you can see the next pair.  In other
words, if you don&#x27;t see the next pair, slow way down until you see it.  Try
to keep the turning rate consistent.  After this slow practice, you can
speed it up again and see what happens.

I find that instantly recognising configurations and performing them
fast suits me better. None of this slow and smooth junk for me :)

Sure, I&#x27;ll look ahead sometimes. but it&#x27;s not as important as everyone
says.

 From that point on, it&#x27;s intuitive to start planning ahead.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not commenting on what one should do and should not do as a
personal preference.  This was the advice given to me when I was at 30
seconds and when I was at 23 seconds and when I was at 18 seconds. 
When I solve in competition, I generally speed everything up, and I&#x27;ll
take the delays.  But for practice, sometimes different exercises can
help you gain a better understanding of the methodology to solving.

In my experience, solving slow and forcing yourself to see each pair
as it unfolds on the cube is good practice and has given me a great
deal of success in solving the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  I apply the same
principles to blindfold solving as well, except of course, you replace
&quot;seeing&quot; each pair to &quot;recognizing your setup moves&quot; before the next
cycle is done.

You can work very hard at something, but if you do the same thing over
and over again, maybe something needs to change.  Solving the Rubik&#x27;s
Cube is not like Tech Support.  You can&#x27;t just reboot Windows and hope
things work right the second time.  Life isn&#x27;t that simple.

What I present is advice that has worked for me.  No one is under any
obligation to follow it.  If you feel what works for you works for
you, then enjoy and have fun.  But in my experience, and I have the
evidence in some of the world&#x27;s top cubers today to support my
conclusion, solving the Rubik&#x27;s Cube slowly and forcing yourself to
see each pair as it unfolds is beneficial.  It&#x27;s like how four out of
five dentists recommend Trident.

          <div class="email-content">I understand what you&#x27;re saying, but saying &quot;It&#x27;s hard to deny the
merits to solving slow when someone can solve slow in 17 seconds on
average.&quot; doesn&#x27;t add much when I can personally say &#x27;It&#x27;s hard to
deny the merits to solving fast when someone can solve fast in 15
seconds on average&#x27;

Yes, I know be could go on and on and name cubers that can solve in
however many seconds on average with whatever, but it doesn&#x27;t really
add anything :)

I get the impression that you think that I havn&#x27;t tryed slow solving.
I have, and gave a lot of time to it after seeing dan harris&#x27; style.
However, I have found my own personal way is better over time. 

You may think in a block building method, looking ahead is invaluable,
but I&#x27;ve found that now I&#x27;ve done that enough (I used to do a
fewest-moves type thing to practise) I can switch to doing it this way
and it&#x27;s better for me. I just thought I&#x27;d add my opinion on how I
don&#x27;t use slow-solving.

I suggest you give my approach a try for a bit :) Slow solving is
good, but you can work very hard at something, and if you do the same
thing over and over again, maybe something needs to change. ;)

Maybe I sound too harsh, but I felt it was justified after your reply
to my comment.

Also, it&#x27;s more like 199 out of 200 doctors prefering Trident in this
case :)

          <div class="email-content">Yep,
looking ahead is very importand.
When I was around 30 sec. and Ron told me to slow down and look
forward for the first time my times dropped immediatly. Now I&#x27;m
averaging about 17 sec. but at the cube meeting lately I was turning
way too quick and got 20&#x27;s. Ron said to slow down again and immediatly
I got 19.xx At home when cubing is going bad and I slow down at F2L my
times suddenly drop from 18/19 to 16&#x27;s.
But it is also importand to be able to solve the pair without thinking
of how. When I see a pair and can&#x27;t solve it without thinking, looking
for the next pair only slows me down. You can only look ahead well,
when you don&#x27;t think about the pair you are solving. Aswell as the
corner piece and the center piece are often in the U-Layer. When it
isn&#x27;t I look for a corner in the U layer and find the matching edge.
I dare to state that looking ahead and turn slower is THE key for
getting better times. When it seems your stuck at a particular time,
slowing down ALWAYS helps (until you reach the 14&#x27;s). 
It does require some practise to execute a slow solve, but it will work...
Hope this was any use to you ;)

  ...just solve a LOT of cubes going slow, and slowly pick up the speed to a point where &quot;going slow&quot; = &quot;going fast&quot; (fast in motion, but slow in the brain).  like a calibration of the mind/eye/brain.  how long this &quot;calibration&quot; lasts depends on the person....

          <div class="email-content">I do a lot better when I slow down during F2L.  I can find my next
pair much more effectively and I can keep a better flow.  When I go
full speed the whole solve, I&#x27;m very off/on.  I was watching Jon
Morris do some slow solves at Worlds in our room.  He was doing 15 and
16 second solves every time, going slow even on OLL and PLL.  There
must be some reason why every fast cuber I&#x27;ve ever met has told me to
slow down on F2L.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I have been looking into BLD solving this week. I thought it might be<br>
useful to have a nice alg to twist four corners at a time. I came up<br>
with the following commutator to twist all corners in the U layer:<br>
<br>
(R&#x27; D R&#x27; D R&#x27; D S) U2 (S&#x27; D&#x27; R D&#x27; R D&#x27; R) U2<br>
<br>
Or written more simply:<br>
(R&#x27; D)^3 S U2 S&#x27; (D&#x27; R)^3 U2<br>
<br>
Or you could do (this is simply a front/back mirror of the above):<br>
(R D&#x27;)^3 S U2 S&#x27; (D R&#x27;)^3 U2<br>
<br>
I had also come up with this similar but slightly trickier alg:<br>
(R2 D&#x27; R2 D2 R&#x27; D S) U2 (S&#x27; D&#x27; R D2 R2 D R2) U2<br>
<br>
The above algs, of course, do not permute anything. I have checked a<br>
few online sites and haven&#x27;t found these algs listed on the sites I<br>
checked, so these may be &quot;new&quot; algs, as far as I know. Some sites have<br>
four-corner twisting algs based upon using an OLL alg followed by an<br>
edge three-cycling alg to fix the edge movement caused by the OLL alg.<br>

I hope you decided to memorize non-isomorphic positions. If you can recognize them 
quickly and can do some quick calculations for isomorphism classes and for inverses too 
then you&#x27;ll have an even better chance!
They all took less than 21 moves?

Gah! I didn&#x27;t disreguard it! I was just saying there is another way.

The problem is that is that after Ron puts up the cross, he&#x27;d have to 
re-examine the cube.  If he did them from the random state, in a 
competition, then he would have 15 seconds to think about which one it 
is.

Though Ron...

Can you explain what you did?  I have a hard time comprehending that 
anyone can memorize 1 quintillion positions, even if we consider 
isomorphic cases, but I&#x27;m not really a math major so I&#x27;m not sure how 
easy this entire thing is.

So if you&#x27;ve met me and I didn&#x27;t tell you to slow down on F2L, this 
means I wasn&#x27;t a fast cuber? That&#x27;s insulting! Expect a letter from my

I&#x27;m not sure if you were being serious (in your first post) because in the first post you 
sounded like you weren&#x27;t sure, but in this one you definitely see that Ron&#x27;s just having fun. 
I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re taking into account that recognition and learning would also take 
more than 3.14 seconds per cube so that memorization is not possible either.

PS It&#x27;s actually around 100 billion years.  (As 
10^11*(31536000+0.2496*86400)=10^18*3.15..., ignoring leap seconds.)
I&#x27;m guessing from the earlier post of Rune that he&#x27;s using the system where 1 billion =10 
^12, in which case it&#x27;s 100,000 million years or 100 milliard years.

And before anyone sees the username (tim28) and accuses me of being 
the &quot;solver&quot;, no, that&#x27;s not me.
Anyway...7.90 seconds, 16 turns (U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; d y L y U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; 
F&#x27; U F) = ~2 tps.  Okay, that&#x27;s relatively fast for that kind of 
video.  Usually it&#x27;s like the &quot;Leyan imposter&quot; video on Letterman(?) 
doing far less than 1 tps.

  is there a way we can see a solve on slow motion? there&#x27;s a cool OLL on Harris Chan&#x27;s 8 seconds solve (!) and I&#x27;d like to see what he did...but is so fast that I can&#x27;t understand anything...<br>

Actually, it&#x27;s a question of terminology. In the UK, 1 billion was historically 10^12, 1 
trillion was 10^18 etc. so 43 trillion and some change would be correct. These days billion 
is typically used to mean 10^9 in the UK also, at least in my generation, if not the one 
before.

I know it&#x27;s not necessarily accurate source info. but wikipedia has an article.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales

This suggests that the UK went to the 1 billion = 10^9 system in the early 70s, which 
seems to fit with the fact that, in the previous generation, 1 billion was understood to 
mean 1 million*1 million. From the point of view of language, the older naming system 
makes more sense. (10^6)^k fits the prefix system better than of 10^{3k+3} I would think.

Yes, it will eventually support any N*N*N cube.<br>

  I must practice some 4x4x4...even if is on the pc
   
  about the slow motion, I don&#x27;t think is really necessary...but you could make something that record the moves done, the R U L thing or the buttons pressed...dunno...just an idea

          <div class="email-content">So I assume it&#x27;s not much of a secret anymore that there is talk about<br>
Rubik&#x27;s Worlds being in Budapest, Hungary next year for the 2007 RWC.<br>
 If this is/was a secret, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m really letting the cat out<br>
of the bag too much since there have been rumors spreading a long time<br>
about it, and also I have a good reason for bringing it up.<br>
<br>
My reason is that I am going to go ahead and admit to my complete<br>
ignorance of world travel.  I know about things like getting my<br>
passport and booking my flights early and using travellers checks when<br>
possible rather than cash, but my question is mainly about how much<br>
should I save for this trip?  I am already saving up money for it, but<br>
I am curious as to how much I should expect it to cost.<br>
<br>
I already looked at some flights and it seems the price range of a<br>
flight to Hungary from the east coast US runs anywhere from $850 to<br>
$3500 depending on how soon or how early I book my flight, as well as<br>
what month I book the flight even if I book in advance.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t expect everything about this competition to be set in stone,<br>
so my question is more general.  Assuming a 2 week trip, how much<br>
money should I save for food, lodging, travel money so that I can see<br>
the sights in the local area, etc.?<br>
<br>
I would love to also stop over in Germany and sight see there too<br>
either before the competition or on the way back, so I was curious how<br>
much it is to travel around Europe and maybe see France, Spain,<br>
England as well on my way back to the states?<br>
<br>
Is there a cheap way to do this lol is what I am asking?  I&#x27;m<br>
definitely going to be stretching my budget very thin to go on this<br>
trip, so any way I can cut costs would be very useful to know for me.<br>
<br>
I know I am bring this up very, very early, but I want to make<br>
absolutely certain that I will be there next year and would like to go<br>
ahead and start planning for it now so that I will be ready.<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help at all, and sorry if I let the cat out of the bag :-s<br>

<br>
Example flight for a student who doesn&#x27;t wanting to miss too much of school.<br>
I took a random weekend.<br>
<br>
Flight.<br>
date: Thu April 26<br>
return date: Mon April 30<br>
from: NY Newark<br>
to: Budapest<br>
price: $836 with stop in Amsterdam<br>

Travel expenses.<br>
If you can share a room with someone else then $100 a day per person should be a decent budget for hotel, food and some travelling.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

PS: Whenever Ton and I are training and I beat him by far, he always says that I am cheating.<br>
He thinks I memorized optimal solutions for all positions of the cube. But in fact I only memorized them for one quintillion positions. :-)<br>

Of course, technically it could depend on what is meant by optimal and what is meant by 
memorizing.
In particular, if you allow all elements to be generators then each position has an optimal 
solution in 1 or fewer moves. Then one might argue that the optimal solution is forced by 
the position and so memorizing would just be to put some kind of label on each position 
which is easily done, indeed the actual position labels the solution by its generator - 
except why stop at 1 quintillion and not do the whole lot? (Sure you might need to figure 
out which label corresponds to your position and it might not be considered memorizing, 
but even recall will take some brain activity, and essentially it is just position recognition 
that involves some calculation.)
Two problems with this are 1) Ron was talking about solving the cube in &lt;21 moves, 
not&lt;2, so its unlikely he was allowing for very many generators and 2) translating the 
solution into a solution in the usual generators would not be easy so it isn&#x27;t practical for 
competitions.

          <div class="email-content">I can personally vouch for Ron on this one, about a week ago he sent
me a copy of his spreadsheet with all his learned cases and had me
quiz him on them for a few hours over yahoo messenger.  We only made
it through 750 quadrillion of them, since he had to go to work, but
still I was very impressed!

I can personally vouch that Ron has perfect recall for those 750
quadrillion cases, and I imagine his recall is the same for the
remaining 250 quadrillion, we just didn&#x27;t have time to finish that day.

Ron good luck on the remaining 42 quintillion!  We&#x27;re all rooting for
you! ;-)

Chris

P.S.  Wouldn&#x27;t it be weird if someone finished learning all 43
quintilltion cases, but was unable to intuitively solve the cube,
since they would just use long term memory to solve any possible case?
 Talk about a very interesting form of irony :-D  I know Ron won&#x27;t
have that problem, since he has studied the cube intuitively as well,
but maybe after he publishes his method we will see a sharp drop in
intuitive solving record times on UWR :-(

I want to see that spreadsheet. It has to be rather, eh, big?

You are either trying to be funny, or you have no idea how big those
numbers are. 750 quadrillion cases in a few hours, WTF?

That would be really weird indeed.

Maybe. I think Ron could be rather fast at BLD now? If he doesn&#x27;t know
the case, just 1 or 2 set up-moves and then he can solve it optimally.
He should easily get sub-10 after a little practice, if he really
knows those cases perfectly. But I have a feeling he doesn&#x27;t.

You&#x27;re about a million times out. That&#x27;s about the rate for 10^12 algorithms, not 10^18.

When removing stickers, I usually toss all the pieces in a bowl with water

fingers, all the cubies are squeaky clean. Works well for me.

However, for the lube, I&#x27;m pretty sure I gave each side sufficient 
time to dry, about 15 - 20 minutes each. After I put it together, I 
tried playing with it for an hour and it still wouldn&#x27;t loosen.

But this is just in my experience.  Other people may have success with

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

On the same note. For those who buy/assemble diy kits/cubes i don&#x27;t 
see any reason to assemble the panel/caps for the corners. The only 
reason might be if it&#x27;s desired to have a slightly heavier cube. In 
that case corners can be filled also ...

Cheers!

Perhaps you used TOO MUCH lube?  (I&#x27;ve had that problem!)
Try wiping most of it off, and see if that helps.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m looking for advice for my third revision of my K4 method<br>
description. The first two basically consisted of more<br>
fingertrick-friendly algs and slight changes (two centres at the start<br>
and first layer on D during E slice solving).<br>
<br>
Now I&#x27;ve come to realise that using a more F3L style system may be<br>
quicker to complete the edges. If I leave out corners when making the<br>
first layer, I end up with a fat cross. (Centers and 4 cross pieces<br>
solved). What is the general idea for this? Solve a corner and half an<br>
edge like F2L then put the other half in with a commutator? Or<br>
something more sinister. <br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve switched to using an F3L style system, and my times are about teh<br>
same right now, since I don&#x27;t know F2L, I don&#x27;t think i can take<br>
advantage of it as well, but in time I hope it to be a better alternative.<br>
<br>
If it does pan out better, I&#x27;ll publish my findings on my site.<br>
<br>
Also, I&#x27;m still looking for a better last layer. Currently it takes me<br>
3/4 algs with an average type of recognition.<br>

Mmh, have trouble regripping fast for the (B&#x27;R&#x27;B). How fast can you do 
it?

And have you tried this one?
R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F R U R&#x27; F R&#x27; F&#x27; R U&#x27; R
Helps to tilt the cube to the left during the alg. I like to never 
regrip with left hand and only pull U&#x27; with it every now and then.

What types are your cubes, which ones got sticky, what&#x27;s your spray?

do it?

For (B&#x27;R&#x27;B) I would rotate x&#x27; so that (B&#x27;R&#x27;B) becomes (U&#x27;R&#x27;U). Wacth
carefully though. Right after the U in (U&#x27;R&#x27;U) you will see an F2L
pair. That pair happens to be on my of faster F2L pair. That is why I
use this particular alg. My execution time is somewhere below sub 2.5 sec.

R&#x27; U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F R U R&#x27; F R&#x27; F&#x27; R U&#x27; R  sounds promising ; )

I use this alg: z [R&#x27;] U&#x27; (R D&#x27;) (R2&#x27; U R&#x27;) (U&#x27; D) (R D&#x27;) (R2&#x27; U R&#x27;) D

          <div class="email-content">I use a F3L very close to your method.  I 2 centers,
like you. then I keep those on my R&amp;L faces.  solve
four edges(cross) plus two edges that will not be in

face, I put the 6 solved edges on the R&amp;L faces:not on
the U side.  then solve the first three layers
&quot;semi-fridrich&quot;.  my F3L are quicker for me, but my LL
needs alot of attention.  

I have tried just pairing up the last edges, then
OLL/PLL, but that defeats the purpose of the F3L
(avoiding parity).  I have also COLL/edge cycle.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-s

Darnnn ...

I had just glued 2 of my 5x5x5s and was cubing happily. Then yet 
again the cube goes bazzzzongas, and i sit there with lots of cubies 
in my hands and on my lap. Yes, u guessed it. A rivet broke again :-(

It&#x27;s the 2nd 5x5x5 that suffers from snapped rivet within a few 
weeks. And i only have one loose (and glued) 5x5x5 to use now. This 
sucks big time!!

Gilles could u bring that core u mentioned before? U are coming to 
Euro 2006 right? At least i want to test it out. Mind u, the core is 
the part that decides if a 5x5x5 is any good or not, unless it&#x27;s 
eastsheen of course.

And folks guess the thickness of the rivet! Only about 1.5 mm at the 
point where mine have broken. Seems the grooves that are made to 
prevent them from sliding out have a severe design flaw :-( IMHO the 
rivets should be about 1 mm thicker!! There is ample space in the 
design to do this actually.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

This is a completely off topic math post, but I wanted to post here 
since I know there are a lot of math people here.

I am trying to review and get back into calculus and am having 
troubles on this one problem.

The problem is that I want to be able to write the equation of a 3D 
space that contains 4 given points in 4 spacial dimensions.

As an analog I decided to try finding the equation of a plane that 
contains 3 points in 3 spacial dimensions and try to expand on that 
idea.

I chose the points (2,3,4) ; (1,5,3) ; (-2,-2,-2) completely 
randomly.

My method was to use vectors for this.  I found 2 vectors in this 
plane using (-2,-2,-2) as the vertex point of both vectors.

My vectors were &lt;2+2,3+2,4+2> and &lt;1+2,5+2,3+2> giving me 
&lt;4,5,6> and &lt;3,7,5>

I then used the cross product to find a vector perpendicular to both 
those two vectors in this plane.  For the cross product I got the 
vector
&lt;-17,-2,13>

I then setup the equation of the plane to be the set of all vectors 
starting at the point (-2,-2,-2) and ending at the point (x,y,z) 
that are perpendicular to the vector I got by taking the cross 
product of the two vectors in the plane.  I used the dot product for 
this.

This gives me:
&lt;-17,-2,13> * &lt;x+2,y+2,z+2> = 0
-17x-34-2y-4+13z+26=0
-17x-2y+13z=12

And checking that last equation I found it contained all 3 points I 
started with.

---------------

Ok now my question is how should I extend this to 4 spatial 
dimensions?

Say I am given the points (1,2,4,5) ; (-2,3,0,-4) ; (1,2,3,4) ; (-1,-
2,5,-2)

Can I approach this the same way?  Should I use two points and find 
the vector between them?  Then use the other two points and find the 
vector between them.  Then find the cross product of those two 
vectors.  Then find the set of all vectors based at one of the 
points I am given to the point (x,y,z,w) such that the dot product 
of that vector and the one I got by doing the cross product is 0?  
Basically exactly what I did for the 3D version and trying to find a 
plane in 3D space?

Thanks for any help.  I am absolutely completely and utterly 
fascinated by the 4th spatial dimension, but I have a lot to learn 
in terms of how to do math in that dimension.

Thanks again,
Chris

in bulk, sell them at a profit, and we&#x27;d still save money.  wouldn&#x27;t 
be a big seller i&#x27;m sure as the batteries seem to last a long time, 
but they also could sit in a box a long time while the inventory is 
sold over time.  

just a thought...

Here&#x27;s my coward&#x27;s way (for people who don&#x27;t know much about cross 
products in higher dimensions) to do it:

We want a, b, c, d so that ax+by+cz=d. Now enter the points:

A) 2a + 3b + 4c = d
B) 1a + 5b + 3c = d
C) -2a - 2b - 2c = d

E=2A-B) 7b + 2c = d
F=2B+C) 8b + 4c = 3d

2E+F) 6b = -d

Let&#x27;s assume d=6, then b=-1. Using E you get
c = (d-7b)/2 = (6+7)/2 = 13/2

Let&#x27;s assume d=12, then b=-2 and c=13. Using B you get
a = d - 5b - 3c = 12 + 10 - 39 = -17

So you end up with
(a,b,c,d) = (-17,-2,13,12)

Same as yours. And I&#x27;m sure you can extend this to higher dimensions 
easily. And if you drop the syntax overhead and write it as a matrix 
it would be less writing/typing.

Mhh, how do you find the cross product of two 4D vectors? If you can 
go this way at all, I think it would rather involve taking *three* 
vectors, e.g. from one of your points to the other three. Also have a 
look here:

          <div class="email-content">Chris,

I&#x27;ve never actually had a full calculus course but i did have to teach myself calculus for the 
summer program i did this summer on quantum mechanics.  Now, i don&#x27;t know the perfect 
answer to your question but i was talking to my old chemistry teacher one and he said that 
you could &quot;take the derivative of something, and end up with a different dimension.&quot;  
Those are his exact words so make of them what you will.  Perhaps you should integrate 
&quot;something?&quot;  I don&#x27;t really understand it, but maybe it could help you.  

Also in quantum mechanics one ends up with a lot of multidimensional spaces.  In that 
sense i believe that you are going about it the right way.  We dealt with them by using 
vectors, and translating them from one set of axes to another, so instead of doing that 
translate them from one spacial dimension to the other.  How have you defined the fourth 
dimension?

Hope i don&#x27;t just sound like an idiot with all this.  It&#x27;s an interesting question though.

          <div class="email-content">I would do just like you Stefan, except that a 4D plane is defined by
the equation ax + by + cz + dw = e. w being the 4th axis.

If are interested in using vectors well you can do the following:

Assume 4 points A, B, C and D in the 4th dimension. You can compute 3
vectors from those points e.g.: r = &lt;AB>, u = &lt;AC> and v = &lt;AD>. Their
cross-product (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product ->
higher dimensions) will compute a perpendicular vector of the plane
given by A,B,C and D. Let&#x27;s call that vector n.

You can just take (a b c d) = n. And e can be found by replacing A
coordinates into the plane equation.

I hope I haven&#x27;t made any mistakes, and I hope it is quite clear.

Sven

PS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28mathematics%29 might give
you some insights why (a b c d) is in the same direction as n.

          <div class="email-content">For the sake of completeness I just did an example (with the little
help of matlab):

A, B, C and D were randomly drawn:

A = [ 0.9501 0.2311 0.6068 0.4860 ]
B = [ 0.8913 0.7621 0.4565 0.0185 ]
C = [ 0.8214 0.4447 0.6154 0.7919 ]
D = [ 0.9218 0.7382 0.1763 0.4057 ]

I computed AB, AC, AD

r = B-A = [ -0.0588 0.5310 -0.1504 -0.4675 ]
u = C-A = [ -0.1287 0.2136 0.0086 0.3060 ]
v = D-A = [ -0.0283 0.5071 -0.4306 -0.0803 ]

I did the &quot;cross-product&quot; using the matrix notation (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product):

n = det( [ i j k l ], r, u, v) = 0.0887*i + 0.0309*j + 0.0277*k +
0.0150*k (with i, j, k and l being the unit vectors corresponding to
the axis). Thus n = [ 0.0887 0.0309 0.0277 0.0150 ].

I then tested that n*&lt;0A> = n*&lt;OB> = n*&lt;OC> = n*&lt;OD> = 0.1155. With O
being the orign O = [ 0 0 0 0 ].

Thus the plane equation is n*[x y z w] = 0.1155.

I hope it clarifies my previous explanation...

          <div class="email-content">Aaaaaah ok I get it now.  I was being dumb, I didn&#x27;t realize that a 
cross product in 4 dimensions needs 3 vectors, since you need the 
determinant of the matrix

[i j k l
 a b c d
 e f g h
 m n o p ]

with vectors &lt;a,b,c,d>; &lt;e,f,g,h>; &lt;m,n,o,p> and i, j, k, l being 
the four unit vectors in 4 spacial dimensions (at least that&#x27;s the 
analog to how I find the cross product of 2 vectors in 3 dimensions).

Also Stefan I really like your way of just treating it as a system 
of equations, which if I&#x27;m not mistaken is really what you do if 
you&#x27;re finding the cross product anyway, or at least something very 
very similar.

Alright thanks everyone, I think I understand now.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everone,

I got it!  I took the four points (1,2,4,5); (-2,3,0,-4); (1,2,3,4); 
(-1,-2,5,-2)

I used the point (-2,3,0,-4) as the vertex of my three vectors in 
this 3D space.

My three vectors were then:

u = &lt;1+2,2-3,4-0,5+4> = &lt;3,-1,4,9>
v = &lt;1+2,2-3,3-0,4+4> = &lt;3,-1,3,8>
w = &lt;-1+2,-2-3,5-0,-2+4> = &lt;1,-5,5,2>

I then did the cross product (I just like using the cross product 
for some reason) u x v x w.  I don&#x27;t know if that is the correct 
notation for crossing 3 vectors in 4 dimensions, but I set it up as 
the determinant of the following matrix:

[i j  k l
 3 -1 4 9
 3 -1 4 9
 1 -5 5 2]

where i,j,k,l are the unit vectors in the x, y, z, w axes 
respectively.  I checked that wikipedia article, and I&#x27;m a bit 
confused that they say the binary cross product doesn&#x27;t have a 
direct analog in higher dimensions, so I guess this operation is 
really the wedge product??

Working out the cross(wedge?) product I got the vector &lt;-28,-14,-
14,14> which I rewrote as 14*&lt;-2,-1,-1,1>.  The method I used was to 
expand by minors.

I then want to find the set of all vectors that begin at the point  
(-2,3,0,-4) and end at the point (x,y,z,w) and are perpendicular to 
the vector &lt;-2,-1,-1,1>.

I did this with the dot product by:

&lt;-2,-1,-1,1> * &lt;x+2,y-3,z,w+4> = 0
-2x - 4 - y + 3 -z + w + 4 = 0
-2x - y - z + w = -3

And I tested all 4 points I started with and this 3D space contains 
all 4 points!  Yay!

Yay again!  Thanks for the help everyone, that absolutely answered 
my question!

Hi Per =)

It&#x27;s probably something with your browser. The page is plain HTML + 
Jelineks AnimCube applet and it works for me and others.

Hi Thom =)

If you are a Roux solver like you then that maybe true I assume but not 
if you are used to do cross-pairs. Here you also get some more freedom 
to use empty faces if you have not yet put any pair on the F or B side.

There&#x27;s a mistake in the HTML:

&lt;applet code=&quot;AnimCube.class&quot; codebase=&quot;E:\Solgrop\Bin&quot; ...

codebase should not point to the user&#x27;s E drive.

If it&#x27;s easier to find the pieces using F2B than this, then of course 
you are rigth. But I&#x27;m not so sure about that, I tried a block method 
similair to Ryan&#x27;s method before and I had more problems finding the 
pieces then than I have using FS-F2L, (that because had to find three 
pices in every moment then, now I only need to find two). But that 
block method is not* F2B, so I can&#x27;t say for sure =)

* My method was: 3 times 1x2x2, last FL edge when possible, last pair 
using VH

          <div class="email-content">Yes, you can do as Roux if you like. But I don&#x27;t see it as a Roux 
variaton, you are newer more than a [M]-move away from using your 
usual Fridrich F2L alg. I alredy know most ELL&#x27;s and for CLL I can 
use my usual last step + some 2x2x2 algs and I learned a few new 
cases, (less than 10 to go for both steps together) so that&#x27;s my main 
reason for going M-slice, CLL + ELL after F2B. But I now also trying 
to use a extended version of CLL where I orinet the LL-edges when 
solving the CLL in SOME cases using: setup M or M&#x27; + usual alg + 
restore F2L (Ex, Sune: r U R&#x27; U R U2 r&#x27;, vary the M-move and also 
reverse or mirror the alg and you got more cases).

It&#x27;s a good idéa to use FS-F2L as a inbetween for going from Fridrich 
to Roux. I wish you good luck with trying it out =)

          <div class="email-content">Awsome, you&#x27;ve gotten it on a website.

Kirjava and I already developed it.  We&#x27;ve just been busy.  It&#x27;s 
actually even more interesting.  We made all the images, all the 
algs (RMU subset), we made NMCMLL recognition cases, and we made 
CMLL Algs.

Had we the time, we&#x27;d of published it =P

Great job anyway.  But what we did was optimize it into RUM&#x27; moves 
or 2-gen :)  Which is very fast.  A lot of cases though.

Sorta mad to see that somebody else beat us to it.  Oh well =P
Good luck, I&#x27;ve been busy, and I decided to just BLD like crazy, and 
Kirjava&#x27;s already fast, so we put the date off.

          <div class="email-content">Well, how could I know =P

My way to this Idéa was the 4x4x4, there my first metod was to do F3L 
as triplets. First I built the D-center then I started to put down 
all edge/edge/corner and center/center/edge triplets around it.

My first improvment was to leave one CCE as keyhole for building the 
triplets. After a while I found I could save even more moves to leave 
both F-side CCE&#x27;s as keyholes.

Then I started to do the botomm center R,L and B CCE&#x27;s and then the 
four EEC&#x27;s and end it by puting down the last two CCE&#x27;s on the F-side.

Then I started to do the first four centers first and then add the 
trhee edges below them and after that the four EEC&#x27;s, end as before.

By then, about two moths ago I showed my brother my method and also 
took up a 3x3x3 and said &quot;it&#x27;s also possible to do for a 3x&quot;. My 
brother replied &quot;develop a method then&quot;. But I did&#x27;n give it much 
thougt then...

After a while I started to leave both F and B-sides ad keyholes for 
the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 and soon realised the D-center had to go =)

   Whoops, my mistake.  You only need one algorithm, not counting
mirrors for corner permutation.  Just turn the U layer until exactly
one corner is solved, and then do a three cycle.  For permute edges,
you need 3 (?) algs.  I forgot that a three cycle alone is not sufficient.

What if exactly two opposite corners are solved? How am I supposed to
keep turning that U layer?

          <div class="email-content">LOL! I was wondering when you where going to say that... :)<br>
<br>
Anyways, the right answer would be: If an even number of corners are <br>
solved on the LL then doing a single quarter turn of the LL will alter <br>
the permutation parity and allow the case to be solved with only 3-<br>
corner cycles and 3-edge cycles. So it is sufficent to use only 2 algs <br>
for PLL. In fact using simple commutators permuting pieces can be done <br>
with out any algs if you are going for a minimalistic approach.<br>
<br>
Hem... I just solved a cube in 59.07s using no algs whatsoever (first <br>
layer corners than second layer edges). So it is possible to get sub-<br>
minute times memorizing nothing. (I just know that someone is going to <br>
post with a much faster time than this since we are a competitive <br>
bunch.)<br>
<br>
Anyhow, note that the original post was not asking about LL, but about <br>
F2L, which doens&#x27;t seem to have been properly addressed. I&#x27;ll assume <br>
you are using a cross-based F2L. How many of the f2l cases do you <br>
know? Now how many of them do you &quot;understand&quot;? For F2L it really <br>
helps to understand the majority of the case algs. Many of the algs <br>
are very similar or related. Work on being able to rapidly mirror algs <br>
diagonally too. Pick an F2L alg list and study it.<br>
<br>
Now if your problem is recognition, that we can&#x27;t help you there, it&#x27;s <br>
all about practice... cubers spend over a year to master F2L.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s never too early to learn some basic triggers too. Work on these <br>
to develop dexterity:<br>
(RU&#x27;R&#x27;U), the flick<br>
(RU&#x27;R&#x27;), kick right<br>
(R&#x27;UR), kick back<br>
(RUR&#x27;), Nathan&#x27;s A (mainly right index finger)<br>
(RUR&#x27;U&#x27;), the move (can be done continuously, I just did 20 of them in <br>
12.65)<br>
(U-U), U2 (yes this can be considered a trigger; use right index and <br>
then right middle; 20 repetitions in 10s is the goal)<br>
(RU2&#x27;R&#x27;), double kick right (use right thumb for first U&#x27;, left index <br>
for second U&#x27;)<br>
<br>
This order is something I recommend for a beginner for triggers. The <br>
names given are common usage in teamBLD. And as it turns out almost <br>
all the F2L algs use a combination of these basic macros and their <br>
diagonal mirrors (F&lt;-&gt;R). Hem, I seem to have assumed righthanded-<br>
ness, doh!<br>

If you want one anyway, and don&#x27;t mind international shipping costs, 
have a look in

http://stores.ebay.co.uk/Rubiks-Puzzles-and-Games

They have a few for sale at the moment (scroll down the page).  I&#x27;ve 
had good service from that shop in the past.

          <div class="email-content">Bah, I had enough time to solve 2 centers and then I had a HUGE pop so I started to gather my pieces that had fallen on the ground and even were hidden under the big cube next to me. When I had all the pieces back together I realized that 2 center corners were broken so I had to DNF.<br>
<br>
I could have borrowed someone else&#x27;s cube for the 2nd attempt but I didn&#x27;t think about it so I tried to tell the judge to put DNS for the 2nd solve but he didn&#x27;t know it existed so he put DNF instead. :p<br>
<br>
Anyway, I couldn&#x27;t have made it to the final for 5x5 and I had really great results in other categories... :D :D (official and non-official)<br>

SO this Polish Open was really a great championship.<br>

  Bah, I had enough time to solve 2 centers and then I had a HUGE pop so I started to gather my pieces that had fallen on the ground and even were hidden under the big cube next to me. When I had all the pieces back together I realized that 2 center corners were broken so I had to DNF.

  I could have borrowed someone else&#x27;s cube for the 2nd attempt but I didn&#x27;t think about it so I tried to tell the judge to put DNS for the 2nd solve but he didn&#x27;t know it existed so he put DNF instead. :p

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys, and girls,<br>
I&#x27;ve been extensively practicing BLD recently, and for some reason, I noticed that:<br>
1. I suck at solving corners<br>
2. I think I did better earlier, and for some reason, speeding up memo+solve ended in a major messing up of corners (edges are the least of my problem...)<br>
3. corners memo varies from very fast to very slow.<br>
Right now, I&#x27;m memorizing everything visually, because I always mix up the 2 strings of numbers I remember (corners/edges). So basically, I try getting all white pieces on the white face and yellow on the yellow face, and then see what happens. but sometimes it ends up being a bad idea because I get a parity-like case on both faces (I solve corners last btw, except when I see it&#x27;s going to help me to solve them first). I tried other ideas to memorize them, like, numbers in another language (usually that would be German, and edges in French), or letters vs numbers or, since I have perfect pitch, notes (do ré mi fa sol la si do), which wasn&#x27;t the best idea ever, because I was listening to some highly ear disturbing music at the same time, and... no (Schnittke for those who know).<br>
So basically, if anyone has a few tips on hand... I would love to hear it. Pochmann on corners is crazy slow, I tried that, but I always end up at very high times. How many cycles do you usually perform to solve the corners? I would guess, somewhere around 4, perhaps 5 on bad cases? I was on Macky&#x27;s page earlier, but it didn&#x27;t help me to actually figure the way to convert numbers into patterns quickly (that and the fact I don&#x27;t use the same numbering as he, and most people out there, does...).<br>
If anyone has a few quick tips, I would appreciate.<br>
Right now, a typical solve for me would be: 15-20s, EO+CO memo - say 30-40s at most for EP memo, most of the time quicker than that, CP goes from 5s to 75s... and solve, around 1:20. I try to keep memo under 60s at all cost, sometimes I start before being done memorizing and try my luck.<br>
Oh and btw, I noticed that often, the solves I finish are the quicker solves, while I think I&#x27;m losing focus after a while and mess up the slower solves. I don&#x27;t know if anyone has already noticed that too? But I&#x27;m really tired of DNFs... I was doing a lot better earlier, I don&#x27;t know what happened? I got my times around 2:30 most of the time now, but most of them are DNFs, and I would hate not finishing my cubes at EC...<br>
What are your average corner solving time (counting memo of course)?<br>
HELP!!!! it&#x27;s really, really, bugging me now...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Patrick,

There are several drawbacks with holding a US National every year.  The
first one is that the champion only gets to hold his/her title for a year.
This, of course, is definitely trivial.  The main drawback is that people
would have to travel more often, and not everyone has the money to do it.
If we do US Nationals *every* year, it makes the US Nationals less special,
and perhaps fewer people will feel compelled to go because they can just go
&quot;next year&quot; instead of in two years.  If US Nationals were every 4 years,
people would make a very significant effort to go to each one because they
were more rare.

I&#x27;d be up for a US Open, in other words, another major all US competition
for 2007 definitely.  US Nationals, I&#x27;d really think we&#x27;d have to think
about a bit more.

If we were to have National Championships and World Championships in the
same year, we would be compromising the attendance of one or both of the
competitions, not to mention it would get expensive for everyone.

          <div class="email-content">Well, for that you need a live webpage or program that transmits the latest results from both competitions.

So far it seemed like nothing like that would be possible, but at the Polish Open, such a system was used.

There were 2 computers used for score taking, this made it much faster than with only one computer.

I think from a technical point of view it is very much possible now, you just need to find 2 competitions, possibly in the same timezone (unless you find enough crazy european guys to compete at night with Caltech or so :D)

          <div class="email-content">I had the same problem with both of my non-DIY cubes.  I think I was
trying to compensate for cube tightness by overlubing.  You really
should consider getting a DIY cube from Rubiks.com instead of wasting
time trying to break in a store-bought cube.  I only use a very small
amount of lube now and rely mostly on spring tension to control ease
of turning.

I&#x27;ve also been using the &quot;cube lube&quot; that comes with the DIY cube
instead of silicone sprays, and that has never caused the
stickiness/tightness that you describe from a silicone spray.  I
intend to go to a silicone oil (e.g. RC car shock oil from Hobbytown)
instead of spray once the cube lube runs out.  I&#x27;ve never heard of the
oil causing that problem either, but I suppose it could still happen
if you use it excessively.

          <div class="email-content">I personally haven&#x27;t tried the DIY cube.  With store bought cubes, it&#x27;s all
about getting lucky.  In a box of 6 cubes, about 2 or 3 cubes will be good
for cubing.  1 cube in 10 or 12 will be great for speed cubing, and 1 in I&#x27;d
estimate about 24 would be outstanding for speed cubing.

Of course, going through boxes of cubes is hard in the first place.  I
wouldn&#x27;t completely disregard store bought cubes.  Many of them are just
fine.

          <div class="email-content">Tyson,
  I see your reasoning behind that, and I agree with it.  However, two years is quite along time.  I like the &quot;US Open&quot; idea.  We should definitely consider it.  As for me, I will barely have the money to go to a US Nationals yearly, and it will be pretty much impossible for a flight overseas to attend the Worlds, but maybe once every 2 or 4 years.  Therefore, I&#x27;d basically be able to compete once every two years at the most.  I know that the current setup is:
Worlds
US/Euro Championship
Worlds
US/Euro Championship

I agree that the Worlds should be bi-yearly, since it is a real major &quot;world&quot; thing, and that the expenses are outrageous.  I know that here in the US we have those &quot;Caltech&quot; competitions and Dallas/other city competitions, but those pretty much cost the same price as attending a Nationals.  With the growing interest in speed solving the cube, I think that we should have at least a yearly &quot;main&quot; event to compete for the US and Euro as well.  The US Open sounds like a great idea, for each mid/late summer.

Also, on another note, ever since I started &quot;cubing&quot; in late Feb. of this year, I have noticed that people get really interested when they are aware that it can be solved so quickly.  When I first heard about that 11.13 WR, I thought it was a fixed cube and they just had the solve it.  However, I am almost sub-20 now with only 6-7 months of practice.  It is amazing.  I have probably got about 100 different people into cubing, and they are always practicing.  I can see the cube coming back into popularity, and more competition evolving.  We should try to promote speed cubing more, and maybe these yearly events will become &quot;more important&quot;.  Let me know if we can pursue that US Open idea, I&#x27;d be willing to get a web page for it and help run all that good stuff.  I am almost positive we can get enough support for that.

  Oh yeah, that&#x27;s the other reason too.

  If we were to have National Championships and World Championships in the
  same year, we would be compromising the attendance of one or both of the
  competitions, not to mention it would get expensive for everyone.

          <div class="email-content">I think you are setting your goals really high. Being able to memorize <br>
in under 1 minute is very hard. It sounded to me like you where just <br>
starting. When I was just starting I focused on success rate. 6 <br>
minutes, or even 5 minutes is a good place to start and get consistant.<br>
<br>
I do orientation first and then cycles. For me, I use English numbers <br>
for the CP and Chinese numbers for EP. The sequences needed to do CO <br>
and EO I just determine beforehand and just before donning the <br>
blindfold, and execute it as fast as I can to move on to the hard part <br>
of CP and EP. For permutation, I sometimes don&#x27;t even memorize <br>
properly and just mumble it to myself over and over.<br>
<br>
Once your success rate is nearly 100% then work on doing everything <br>
faster. I recommend trying to speed up execution first rather then <br>
trying to rush the memorization. For me, gradually I changed the way I <br>
memorized to something more and more efficent for me. Everybody has <br>
their own preference, you just have to find what works for you.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I bought 6 of them at the same time a long time ago and they didn&#x27;t 
turn out too well. personally, I don&#x27;t like to use them. Although I 
don&#x27;t think I fully preped one in the same way I normally do so I 
could be wrong.

I&#x27;m not terribly inclined to try another DIY until someone tells me 
they got he center caps to fit properly. They did perfectly for the 
white version, I don&#x27;t see why they didn&#x27;t bother to get it right 
for the black ones. BTW, I like to use a washer on both ends of the 
springs, this and lube will make a freshly assembled DIY not squeak 
at all.

I don&#x27;t understand the point of DIY cubes unless the user can 
occasionally go in and adjust the tensions. This is not likely to 
happen if I super glue things. I tried &quot;spray glue&quot; when I did it 
and that turned out just as messes as super glue, or maybe I suck at 
using glue. Then again, I don&#x27;t even believe DIY kits should require 
it.

Just go with the cubes in hexagonal prism packaging. Can&#x27;t really go 
wrong with them.

          <div class="email-content">When I focused on just BLDing the corner step of my solve.  I was 
averaging about 90s memo + execution.  Back then I was about 6 
minutes.  Now I&#x27;m averaging 3:45 for BLD, so I&#x27;d have to say that 
everything is a little faster.  But I don&#x27;t want to go back to 
practicing BLD in parts, that&#x27;s a degression!

I realized, that just memorizing corners is dimming the mentality.  
Why would you want to just focus on BLDing corners.  Sure perhaps 
trying to memo corners as fast as possible, but still executing the 
whole solve.

Here is my BLD procedure now.
Decide my Corner Path
Decide my Edge Path
Memo my Edge Path
Memo my Corner Path
Glance at my Both Buffers
Fix Parity (if applicable) -- this is my own method I developed
Execute Edge Path
Execute Corner Path -- my setups are optimal, only 1 face move per 
set -- 

I currently have a 16 alg system for BLD, 9 algs are dedicated to 
parity fixes, three of the algs can be used for parity fix and 
Corner Permutation.

Now that my memo is getting faster, I may be able to attempt Simul 
Block again.  

The best way to speed up Corner exection, is to optimize alg 
performances per solve, or optimize setups!
Figure out which is more important.

Later,

two years is quite along time.  I like the &quot;US Open&quot; idea.  We should
definitely consider it.  As for me, I will barely have the money to go
to a US Nationals yearly, and it will be pretty much impossible for a
flight overseas to attend the Worlds, but maybe once every 2 or 4
years.  Therefore, I&#x27;d basically be able to compete once every two
years at the most.  I know that the current setup is:

major &quot;world&quot; thing, and that the expenses are outrageous.  I know
that here in the US we have those &quot;Caltech&quot; competitions and
Dallas/other city competitions, but those pretty much cost the same
price as attending a Nationals.  With the growing interest in speed
solving the cube, I think that we should have at least a yearly &quot;main&quot;
event to compete for the US and Euro as well.  The US Open sounds like
a great idea, for each mid/late summer.

this year, I have noticed that people get really interested when they
are aware that it can be solved so quickly.  When I first heard about
that 11.13 WR, I thought it was a fixed cube and they just had the
solve it.  However, I am almost sub-20 now with only 6-7 months of
practice.  It is amazing.  I have probably got about 100 different
people into cubing, and they are always practicing.  I can see the
cube coming back into popularity, and more competition evolving.  We
should try to promote speed cubing more, and maybe these yearly events
will become &quot;more important&quot;.  Let me know if we can pursue that US
Open idea, I&#x27;d be willing to get a web page for it and help run all
that good stuff.  I am almost positive we can get enough support for that.

If it&#x27;s a combination of frames and the pieces, you could probably  
salvage some &quot;all star&quot; cubes from the rejects. That is, replace bad  
pieces with good in a cube with a good frames.

But I have not studied this at all.

  two years is quite along time. I like the &quot;US Open&quot; idea. We should
  definitely consider it. As for me, I will barely have the money to go
  to a US Nationals yearly, and it will be pretty much impossible for a
  flight overseas to attend the Worlds, but maybe once every 2 or 4
  years. Therefore, I&#x27;d basically be able to compete once every two
  years at the most. I know that the current setup is:

  > US/Euro Championship
  > Worlds
  > US/Euro Championship

  > I agree that the Worlds should be bi-yearly, since it is a real
  major &quot;world&quot; thing, and that the expenses are outrageous. I know
  that here in the US we have those &quot;Caltech&quot; competitions and
  Dallas/other city competitions, but those pretty much cost the same
  price as attending a Nationals. With the growing interest in speed
  solving the cube, I think that we should have at least a yearly &quot;main&quot;
  event to compete for the US and Euro as well. The US Open sounds like
  a great idea, for each mid/late summer.

  this year, I have noticed that people get really interested when they
  are aware that it can be solved so quickly. When I first heard about
  that 11.13 WR, I thought it was a fixed cube and they just had the
  solve it. However, I am almost sub-20 now with only 6-7 months of
  practice. It is amazing. I have probably got about 100 different
  people into cubing, and they are always practicing. I can see the
  cube coming back into popularity, and more competition evolving. We
  should try to promote speed cubing more, and maybe these yearly events
  will become &quot;more important&quot;. Let me know if we can pursue that US
  Open idea, I&#x27;d be willing to get a web page for it and help run all
  that good stuff. I am almost positive we can get enough support for that.

my dad used to use graphite back in the 80&#x27;s. I tried it too. But it

  Bah, I had enough time to solve 2 centers and then I had a HUGE pop so I started to gather my pieces that had fallen on the ground and even were hidden under the big cube next to me. When I had all the pieces back together I realized that 2 center corners were broken so I had to DNF.

  I could have borrowed someone else&#x27;s cube for the 2nd attempt but I didn&#x27;t think about it so I tried to tell the judge to put DNS for the 2nd solve but he didn&#x27;t know it existed so he put DNF instead. :p

This is one of the Toronto 2003 World Championship cubes that were <br>
given to the winners of the competition.<br>
I was given two of these for setting the fastest time in the <br>
competition and the fastest time in my age level.<br>
My fastest time of the competition was 16.53 seconds setting the <br>
new Guinness World Record at the time.<br>
These cubes were made in both black and white, this is the black <br>
type.<br>
I belive 50 were made and to my knowledge about half of them are <br>
black.<br>
This cube has the inventor of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube, Erno Rubik&#x27;s <br>

If I read: &quot;A man solved two cubes&quot;, he may very well had solved one cube two times. But if I say that I saw two cubes (not being very, very drunk), it would be clear to even a mathematiCian that it is about two Different cubes.

  Well, for starters you should begin by explicitly writing &quot;different&quot; 
  after each number (as in &quot;I taught 100 different people&quot;) in order to 
  rule out the possibility of duplicates among them (in the extreme case 
  it could otherwise mean 100 times the same single person!), something 
  rarely considered by non-mathematitians.

          <div class="email-content">Since we are in a sharing mood..., last night I got my first sub-2 min <br>
single solve on 5x5 of *1:55.94* while chatting with Frank. It was <br>
slightly lucky since I did centers in roughly 27s and normally take <br>
around 42s. The thrid center was nearly finished when I got to it. I <br>
ran into a simple ZBLL that I forgot (U1 with edges H) in that solve <br>
though. My previous PB was 2:05.11 so this time is not likely to be <br>
repeated anytime soon.<br>
<br>
In the first hour of waking up today, I did the following PB rolling <br>
ave:<br>
(2:08.79) 2:10.62 (2:40.62) 2:18.50 2:26.82 2:20.36 2:30.73<br>
=&gt; 2:21.406<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong in my 2:40.xx besides encountering <br>
parity. I really should take the time to do video analysis one of <br>
these days. The last time was a bit unfortunate too, since I knew <br>
before doing it that getting a good time there could have made my ave <br>
sub-2:20. I suspect my ave of 100 to be around 2:31 now, but I don&#x27;t <br>
want to repeat that marathon any time soon.<br>
<br>
In other news, I meant and had lunch with a fellow cuber, Ed, of <br>
edsthinkshop.com yesterday. It&#x27;s always refreshing to see a CF cuber. <br>
And I got a couple Jumbo-sized cubes for my project, so I am very <br>
grateful of this.<br>

Well that would require considering the real world. Plus you could&#x27;ve 
still seen the same cube at different times, for example.

Anyway, my point was that saying &quot;I taught 100 different people&quot; 
seems rather unusual for someone who&#x27;s *not* a mathematician. Why not 
just say &quot;I taught 100 people&quot;?

And I&#x27;ve seen &#x27;different&quot; being used in some mathematical proofs for 
the purpose to rule out duplicates. Though you&#x27;ll come across this 
more often in mathematical syntax than plain English, e.g. somewhat 
like this:

ForAll a,b in N with a!=b: someAssertionAboutAandB

&quot;Different&quot; in &quot;I taught 100 different people&quot; doesn´t necessarily have a mathematical undertone. Those people could have differed in anything: age, gender, interest, inclination etc., etc.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,
I started finishing my cubes again! I&#x27;ve following some advices I&#x27;ve been told. First, I started by writing down all the cases and combos of cases that could be helpful to my method, so I don&#x27;t have to rethink all of this every time. I was thinking about it in the shower this morning, drawing little cubes and cycles all over the windows on the mist... So once I had this down, I just did a few memos without solving, taking my time, being as quiet as I possibly could. Then I had to leave, and during the metro ride, I did a few succesful solves in a row, all around 3-3:10 mins, which is pretty slow for me, but I didn&#x27;t really care.
Also, I started doing a lot of other stuff not cube-related, such as, going to the violinmaker to get my cello fixed, had a lesson too later, practiced some cello later tonight. And when I picked up the cube again tonight, I started not only finishing my solves, because that wasn&#x27;t the case all the time, I had some pretty bad DNFs where everything was messed up, but the ones I didn&#x27;t finish I was doing stupid mistakes such as, forgeting to reorient the cube after an orientation or whatever, other than that I was consistent at solving them, but also I was faster overall while actually taking my time. I think I can still cut about 20s really easily by doing a few easy shortcuts, and not going 7 times through the memo to be sure I know it. But overall, I don&#x27;t have to force my memo to be quick, it got quicker all by itself, just by thinking to take my time instead of rushing everything.
So I&#x27;m pretty happy to anounce I&#x27;m not going to throw my cube out of the window because I keep failing. That&#x27;s a pretty weird feeling though, after being a consistent 3:30 BLD solver, getting my times down to 2:30-3:00 and suddenly not being able to solve 5 cubes out of 30... I was BLD cubing all day, hoping for an improvement, but it came by itself. As usual, I would say.
And to add a comment to Daniel&#x27;s post, I think I&#x27;m using about 10 different very basic algs for BLD solving. Very trivial. The one I really feel secure with, the ones I never lock up, many are the algs I originally found when I first figured the cube eyes open...

Objet : [Speed cubing group] Re: BLD corners

                           When I focused on just BLDing the corner step of my solve.  I was 
 averaging about 90s memo + execution.  Back then I was about 6 
 minutes.  Now I&#x27;m averaging 3:45 for BLD, so I&#x27;d have to say that 
 everything is a little faster.  But I don&#x27;t want to go back to 
 practicing BLD in parts, that&#x27;s a degression!
 
 I realized, that just memorizing corners is dimming the mentality.  
 Why would you want to just focus on BLDing corners.  Sure perhaps 
 trying to memo corners as fast as possible, but still executing the 
 whole solve.
 
 Here is my BLD procedure now.
 Decide my Corner Path
 Decide my Edge Path
 Memo my Edge Path
 Memo my Corner Path
 Glance at my Both Buffers
 Fix Parity (if applicable) -- this is my own method I developed
 Execute Edge Path
 Execute Corner Path -- my setups are optimal, only 1 face move per 
 set -- 
 
 I currently have a 16 alg system for BLD, 9 algs are dedicated to 
 parity fixes, three of the algs can be used for parity fix and 
 Corner Permutation.
 
 Now that my memo is getting faster, I may be able to attempt Simul 
 Block again.  
 
 The best way to speed up Corner exection, is to optimize alg 
 performances per solve, or optimize setups!
 Figure out which is more important.
 
 Later, 
 Daniel Beyer

I bought them for the first time at SF and have yet to try them on. 
However, many of the people I talked to say they don&#x27;t like it.

          <div class="email-content">Due to seeing Patterson pop the 5x5 all the time, I&#x27;ve always 
brought two speedy 5x5s to tourns. Most of the time I simple just 
take the parts I need from my back up. I&#x27;m up to five 5x5s now. I 
keep them all pretty smooth and identically, perfectly stickered.

Respect your cubes, and they won&#x27;t let you down!

What good is traveling with a second 5x5 and leaving it in the 
hotel? At least now, you will be careful for the EC. I recommend 
working in a second 5x5 if you have not done so already.

Maybe it has to do with the fact that I sweat a lot through my fingers.

By the way, talking of sub20, I had this OH solve today...man I&#x27;m mad
because it would have been sub 20 if I hadn&#x27;t messed up OLL by doing twice
that algorithm which afterwards gave me a PLL skip...

I hope to have more of these in the very near future... :D

          <div class="email-content">what I would really like are deluxe style tiles.  The first problem that
comes to mind though is that on the deluxe they are slightly embedded in the
cube, not just on the surface, and, well, yeah, that would be a pain.  But
would it be worth it?  I wonder if someone could actually make money sinking
tiles into cubes.  Or maybe even if you are good at plastic molding, making
your own cube with space for sunken tiles.  All of this would only work
though if those tiles were available.  I wonder if tiles that size would
work well just as stick on?

1. I had expected the texture to make them more &quot;grippy&quot;, but I  <br>

that is.<br>
2. The sub millimeter added thickness of the cube threw me off more  <br>

It&#x27;s been around for ages. Macs are fine with java applets I&#x27;m sure.

gotten several sub 3m.  Just got another tonight!  I got a 2:47.xx 
on Ryan&#x27;s BLD competition.  I need to restring my magic, and 
reassemble my eastsheen 222 and revenge.

Why?  I think this will prove very beneficial to my BLD times.  The 
stress of tedious tasks, or locking your keys in your car (Plus the 
2-3 mile walk home to grab a spare key), or getting yelled at by 
your boss, makes BLD very stressless, actually relaxing!  Also 
fooling around w/ big cube BLD and all it&#x27;s tediousness has me set 
to get better at BLD.   

Like I said before, find the balance between setups and alg 
executions is key.  I thought of a large bld system, that&#x27;d directly 
solve 2 corners, w/ three-cycles. But this is a large 36 alg system.

I&#x27;ll stick w/ my 2-cycle method, which I love.  And I&#x27;m looking back 
into Simul Block, some of you may have seen my posts on the method 
this summer.  I&#x27;m using it partially.  If I was better at 
visualizing setups, I&#x27;d seriously look into 5-cycles, there is a lot 
of potential there!

I&#x27;ve been told. First, I started by writing down all the cases and 
combos of cases that could be helpful to my method, so I don&#x27;t have 
to rethink all of this every time. I was thinking about it in the 
shower this morning, drawing little cubes and cycles all over the 
windows on the mist... So once I had this down, I just did a few 
memos without solving, taking my time, being as quiet as I possibly 
could. Then I had to leave, and during the metro ride, I did a few 
succesful solves in a row, all around 3-3:10 mins, which is pretty 
slow for me, but I didn&#x27;t really care.
> Also, I started doing a lot of other stuff not cube-related, such 
as, going to the violinmaker to get my cello fixed, had a lesson too 
later, practiced some cello later tonight. And when I picked up the 
cube again tonight, I started not only finishing my solves, because 
that wasn&#x27;t the case all the time, I had some pretty bad DNFs where 
everything was messed up, but the ones I didn&#x27;t finish I was doing 
stupid mistakes such as, forgeting to reorient the cube after an 
orientation or whatever, other than that I was consistent at solving 
them, but also I was faster overall while actually taking my time. I 
think I can still cut about 20s really easily by doing a few easy 
shortcuts, and not going 7 times through the memo to be sure I know 
it. But overall, I don&#x27;t have to force my memo to be quick, it got 
quicker all by itself, just by thinking to take my time instead of 
rushing everything.
> So I&#x27;m pretty happy to anounce I&#x27;m not going to throw my cube out 
of the window because I keep failing. That&#x27;s a pretty weird feeling 
though, after being a consistent 3:30 BLD solver, getting my times 
down to 2:30-3:00 and suddenly not being able to solve 5 cubes out 
of 30... I was BLD cubing all day, hoping for an improvement, but it 
came by itself. As usual, I would say.
> And to add a comment to Daniel&#x27;s post, I think I&#x27;m using about 10 
different very basic algs for BLD solving. Very trivial. The one I 
really feel secure with, the ones I never lock up, many are the algs 
I originally found when I first figured the cube eyes open...

You mean with the $\forall$ quantifier that most people might find 
strange in latex source and not understand in compiled form? Yeah... 
that&#x27;s why I opted for &quot;middle ground&quot; and said &quot;&#x27;somewhat&#x27; like 
this&quot;.

In cases with only two values, would &quot;different&quot; not be clear enough? 
Ok, you&#x27;ve probably read more proofs than me, particularly in English.

or 5x5x5.  However, my 4x4x4 is very loose and I&#x27;ve found that I get a
better grip on it using the textured tiles.  Plus, since the 4x4x4 is
loose enough for finger-tricks but a bit larger than the 3x3x3, I end
up using the outer edges of my fingers (and even my knuckles) to
assist in finger-trick style turns on the 4x4x4, and the extra
traction of the textured tiles helps.

just a note : I&#x27;m kinda sick these days (was already at the Polish Open), so
if you want to avoid health problems : stay away from me !
No seriously, I don&#x27;t think I can contaminate other people but if you do not
see me this week-end, that means my mom will have locked me in my room to
prevent myself from going more sick.

But I should arrive there tomorrow at the beginning of the afternoon (except
I can&#x27;t find my train tickets anymore but that&#x27;s another problem)

                           Hey guys,
 I just wanted to share my BLD improvements with everyone, since I just got a major improvement in my times: I finally broke the 2 minutes! well, it was on a single solve, wether easy nor hard, perhaps the corners were a bit easier than usual though. But still. 1:51.45, that&#x27;s a good solve whatsoever. Scramble:

          <div class="email-content">Awome breakthrough.  What is your method?  my average is dropping 
and dropping.  I just got a sub 3:15.  I&#x27;ve gotten several sub 3s 
now.  I need to get better at making decisions and recognizing 
corners.

I&#x27;ve already posted my entire method approach.
Decide Corner Path
Decide Edge Path
Memo Edge Path
Memo Corner Path -- This is actually a quick review
Scan Buffers
If Parity (Solve a corner and Edge Simultaneously)
Execute Edges
Execute Corners

I use Two-Cycles
So, what do you do?

          <div class="email-content">Well, I took an average.
Yesterday I caughed every 30 seconds. Now I&#x27;m at about one caugh per 60 to
90 seconds.

So technically I&#x27;m 2 or 3 times healthier than yesterday.
For my own sake, I hope the competition is fully indoor and that there won&#x27;t
be too much air moving inside it.

But with the strong medication my doctor gave me (she is also a member of my
fan club :D), there is no way I can&#x27;t get better. You&#x27;ll see me swallow
pills every now and then. :p

I&#x27;m leaving in 30 minutes. I arrive in Paris Nord train station at 13:05. (I
found my tickets : there are in my university dorm in Brussels...this will
take me one hour grrr.....)

Thanks Koen for supporting me. I hope I can beat my new average of 27.77 OH
and also 20.75 for single solve :D

Bye bye !
Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks Chris, I&#x27;ll be sure to take lots of piccies for you :)
I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is as far as results posting goes, but if I
can get access to a computer while at the champs, I shall post regular
results updates on my website - cubestation.co.uk

I&#x27;m now leaving, I would also like to wish all competitors good luck,
and commiserate those who couldn&#x27;t make it.

But it will be fantastic to see everyone again!

          <div class="email-content">My opinion:

All the colors on the tiles are too dull. Also, for some reason, the 
tiles are less adhesive than the stickers, and when they chip off, 
it looks pretty big. It&#x27;s because I hadn&#x27;t used the stickers, so I 
thought the tiles were really good. And the stickers are 
pretty &quot;grippy&quot;.

          Well, I took an average.
Yesterday I caughed every 30 seconds. Now I&#x27;m at about one caugh per 60 to
90 seconds.

So technically I&#x27;m 2 or 3 times healthier than yesterday.
For my own sake, I hope the competition is fully indoor and that there won&#x27;t
be too much air moving inside it.

But with the strong medication my doctor gave me (she is also a member of my
fan club :D), there is no way I can&#x27;t get better. You&#x27;ll see me swallow
pills every now and then. :p

I&#x27;m leaving in 30 minutes. I arrive in Paris Nord train station at 13:05. (I
found my tickets : there are in my university dorm in Brussels...this will
take me one hour grrr.....)

Thanks Koen for supporting me. I hope I can beat my new average of 27.77 OH
and also 20.75 for single solve :D

Bye bye !

          <div class="email-content">I do the same for 3x3 as Brent. But for 5x5 I do think it is better 
to take a break in between because it is just so intense. I put it 
down, record the time, wipe off the sweat, drink some water, maybe 
change the music, and scramble for a minute with my eyes shut (so 
they can rest).

I am not sure what to do for the 4x4. I haven&#x27;t found anything that 
works for me yet.

So to answer the original question, it typically takes arouud 50 
solves to get me &quot;in the zone&quot; (sadly I usually don&#x27;t do this before 
going on stage in a competition). I try my best to take a break 
every 100 solves, despite wanting to go on. This is from a few years 
of experience. Going too long and not standing up, wlaking around, 
stretching would be bad. It is also important to keep hydrated, and 
having some (a very small amount but some) human interaction would 
be good too. There have been weeks where I would solve at least 500 
cubes a day, every day. It takes some balence because it is to 
addictive. Recalling a really long session I had nearly 4 years ago, 
I was under nothing by a close florecent light at 4am. Don&#x27;t do 
that, that gave me faster times in the short run but was really bad 
for my eyes. Not sure what the flickering florecent does to my brain 
chemistry, but that got me to a great &quot;cube high&quot; really fast. I 
don&#x27;t recommend it. My eyes where hurting very badly for a few days 
afterwards. 1000 cubes in 7 hours is also a bad idea, unless you are 
going for one of those 24 hr marathons, and even then I would train 
up to it.

While on the subject... I tend to play very high beat music (say 
techno) for 3x3 and very mellow music for 5x5. Because for some 
reason my heart rate just instantly triples when I&#x27;m doing 5x5 and 
it needs to be kept in check to have good finger flow. I&#x27;m strangely 
obsessed with the song &quot;How to Save a Life&quot; by The Fray this week.

          <div class="email-content">(R&#x27;U&#x27;R) feels fine using either right thumb or left index, although I 
won&#x27;t consider eihter a &quot;trigger&quot; nor have a name for that combo. The 
other one, (R U&#x27;R) is a very fast trigger using the right thumb.

This is not necessarily a bad habit... there are cases when using the 
right thumb can be very helpful. There are some instances where one 
should do U2 as U&#x27; with right thumb followed by U&#x27; with left index 
(assuming right handed of course). Although U2 done as U with right 
index followed by U with right milddle is best if possible.

Among the cubers I see at tournaments, I am probably the most thumb-
heavy cuber. I use my right thumb for D and F&#x27; all the time. I even 
have a few triggers that uses my right thumb that probably no other 
cuber performs that way.

It&#x27;s up to you to develop your own style. We can tell you what bad 
habits are, but I don&#x27;t think using your thumb should be one of them. 
In fact, logically, the more fingers one uses the better... the left 
ring finger is very useful for doing M&#x27; once you are accustomed to 
that for instance.

Earlier this week I was working on one of my new algs that has a 
(R&#x27;UR&#x27;UR&#x27;U) trigger that I do with right index, followed by right 
middle, followed by right ring. The more triggers you develop, and the 
more fingers you train, the easier it will be in the long run.

(M2U&#x27;) I wouldn&#x27;t imagine doing without my right thumb to trigger. I 
have a few blazingly fast algs that uses S&#x27; with right thumb.

BTW, I like your subject line choice :).

          <div class="email-content">I just finished level 10 in 18.21, level 8 and 9 took about 15 minutes 
each, and levels 1-7 took about 12 minutes total. For level 10 my 
system started lagging a lot, I think that after every cross/uncross 
it reomputes wheather or not you have planarized it (yes that would 
more graph-theoretic word). In fact I thought I was done, and the box 
didn&#x27;t pop up so I kept staring at it for a while until it told me I 
had finished it about 20s later... wierd.


Does it eventually end, or will it keep generating bigger and bigger 
levels indefinately?

I came up with a fairly decient method to use. So it&#x27;s become a bit 
boring. I just have to apply an algorithm really... and then do a 
couple actually &quot;folds&quot; at the end when there are 2-4 lines that 
remain in the way. I wish there was an option to zoom-in or out... I 
have to do a manual zoom as part of my method and that gets annoying, 
and I bet a lot of people solve these puzzles like I do. I eye-ball a 
least-squares position for each node in-turn. So as if the edges where 
springs and getting to the position of least energy. I occassioanlly 
have to space things out and try to use the full area I get to work 
with. There are a few patterns that can be collapsed momentarily and 
then expanded later, yielding a minor recursion to speed things up. 
But ya... doing things iteratiely here is the way to go, it easily 
scales to a greater number of nodes.

I guess I shall see if it has a last level... :)

Thats another thing, I ALWAYS DO MU&#x27; with the thumb now. (as r&#x27;RU&#x27;)


but how do you preform M2U&#x27; with the thumb?

I do M2 as r (R&#x27;M&#x27;). During the 2nd part (R&#x27;M&#x27;), I use my left index
for M&#x27;, and my RIGHT THUMB for R&#x27;.  So how do I switch quickly to
using my thumb for U&#x27; ?

          <div class="email-content">I use roux, and the only thing I use my thumbs for is holding the cube
(on the two blocks)

I find doing U/U&#x27; with index fingers is faster on the last six edges.
Plus, this way your hand doesn&#x27;t change positions.

If you are asking me:

It&#x27;s been so long I don&#x27;t even remember.  The game was on a different 
site too, it looked like a math teaching site.  I&#x27;m sure I got to at 
least level 12 when I played it.  The guy that made it said that it 
doesn&#x27;t end, and at level 10 you are considered someone that is good 
at it.  So I guess after 10, it&#x27;s the same difficulty.

I&#x27;ll try again later and see how far I can get now that I&#x27;m into 
puzzle solving.

          <div class="email-content">ok, this happened to me once. all you need to do, is take the cube apart, and wipe the pieces off with a jay cloth, or something that wont give off fuzzies.
(if you use normal oil like me, as opposed to the silicon spray)> from now on, take out a cubie, put in mabey 3 drops, and re assemble. thats it. when you mix the cube the oil will spread all over the inside of the cube. i use sewing-machine oil, even though everyone tells me to use the silicon stuff.  im too lazy. anyway, thats my advice.

          <div class="email-content">If you please, include a more detailed description of the problem. 
Which type of lube you used would help. WOuld you say that the 
cube &quot;jerks&quot;? Does it feel &quot;crunchy&quot; or &quot;chrispy&quot; :) ?

Is this a new cube? If so it might not have even been the case that 
you should have lubed it early.

If you are new to cubing then, it could be that your turning speed 
is too slow and you should try to adjust to the cube instead of the 
other way around. Give it a 4-6 weeks and you should be used to it.

Basically this entails understanding &quot;under-turn&quot; and &quot;over-turn&quot;. 
Not only you conciously, but you will have to train your 
hands/fingers to do it automatically without thinking.

If it is just rediculously over lubed (you touch it and it spins 
over 360, shake it and it starts scrambling itself), than I would 
take it apart (turn one of the faces 45 deg and lift an edge out) 
and wipe each piece down with a cloth first than maybe even dunk it 
all in water for it a bit. Then add soap. I like to do this to new 
cubes to *slightly rust* the springs, to speed up the loosening 
process and passify a noisy spring.

If you have manufacture stickers on it than it might get ruined, but 
I always peel tham off when I take a cube out of the box anyways, 
because stickers never last more than a week if I&#x27;m active. There 
are places to get more stickers.

As you can imagine, lots of pictures and videos were taken. Unfortunately I
only had my non-digital camera so it will take a few days (or weeks, I might
finish my film at the Dutch Open) for me to get my pictures but I&#x27;m sure
lots of them will get out very soon.

Personnally, I think the championship was just perfect.
I had lots of good times in the competition and I got to meet everyone again
so I&#x27;m very very happy.

I can&#x27;t wait for the next championship (Dutch Open, 3 weeks from now) and I
am already training to beat that 29.09 OH average :p (OK, I might rest for a
few days though :p)

I know there will be a press article in a French speaking Belgian newspaper
during this week so I&#x27;ll send it when I&#x27;ll have it.

Congratulations to all the new European Champions and everyone of course.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Pedro!

Thanks! I am also looking forward to see some pics/vids. The EC was
(again) a great experience. Thanks to all cubers for making it a
very nice and special event.. Special thanks to Dan and Lars (for
being very cool and nice guys), Ron and Ton (for cheering for me and
motivating me all the time). I am forgetting to thank a lot of ppl,
but I don&#x27;t want to sound like I am sucking up to everybody :).

Oh, a little advice for everybody that gets into a final of a big 
cubing event: don&#x27;t screw up the fist attempt. I started off with a 
20.xx in the final... I knew that with one more mistake, I would 
never make it.. And in the last solve, I locked up in the Z perm 
slightly... If that would have taken 0.33 seconds longer, I wouldn&#x27;t 
have made it. That&#x27;s how close Jean was.. :). He&#x27;s a great cuber.

- Joël.

P.S.: If anyone made videos or pics, I&#x27;d like to see some. I brought 
my camera, but it was consuming batteries like.. crazy. I don&#x27;t know 
what was wrong with it.

I also had a really great time at the EC, and got some nice personal
competition records. I got some solving videos but I&#x27;m not sure where
I can upload them. I don&#x27;t think I have room for them on my school
account. Are there any free web hotels that gives you a fair ammount

Anybody has videos of me solving one-handed?
I just want to have a look at how I cube in competition, maybe I can improve
a few things.

I think I must applaud whenever someone beats my brother, because I can no
longer do it.  If Anssi had competed in the US Championships, he would have
taken third just like he did at the EC.  Congratulations for beating Toby!

          <div class="email-content">hi all.<br>
i&#x27;ve been playing around with different lubes for 3*3*3 speed solving, and discovered something that i think is rather interesting. if you oil a cube with light oil(like i normally do) the cube moves well, turns easily, but i find that if i make a small mistake with my fingering, the cube turns unexpectedly, and can be hard to hold. so i put some thick sticky grease in one of my cubes(already quite loose)and found that it is harder to start a turn, but once you get it going, it flies like an oild cube. this means that the faces will stick untill you actually apply some force. it took a fiew nimutes to get used to, but i could cycle algs about 20%  faster. this also works quite well on the 2*2*2 cube. (as of yet i only have one revenge and professor so i have not tried it on them yet.)<br>
<br>
anyway, thats my little discovery. apologies if this is repeating an old message.<br>

The record is 10.73 now. He isn&#x27;t that fast on real cubing, though,
but that&#x27;s insane anyway...

  Hey thanks :-)

  As you can imagine, lots of pictures and videos were taken. Unfortunately I
  only had my non-digital camera so it will take a few days (or weeks, I might
  finish my film at the Dutch Open) for me to get my pictures but I&#x27;m sure
  lots of them will get out very soon.

  Personnally, I think the championship was just perfect.
  I had lots of good times in the competition and I got to meet everyone again
  so I&#x27;m very very happy.

  I can&#x27;t wait for the next championship (Dutch Open, 3 weeks from now) and I
  am already training to beat that 29.09 OH average :p (OK, I might rest for a
  few days though :p)

  I know there will be a press article in a French speaking Belgian newspaper
  during this week so I&#x27;ll send it when I&#x27;ll have it.

  Congratulations to all the new European Champions and everyone of course.

For Dutch Cubers, it was not needed to make a fake cube with colors that are
not usually used (thay have red, white and blue)

          <div class="email-content">Hello,<br>
  I have a couple comments/questions about some competition stuff. <br>
First off, the &quot;US Open&quot; idea.  I&#x27;d like to talk about this more and<br>
see if we can really make it happen.  Basically, since US Nationals is<br>
once every 2 years, maybe we can create a &quot;US Open&quot;, which will<br>
alternate with US Nationals.  This will allow any US cuber to compete<br>
at least once a year.  With this, we can also continue to have the<br>
Worlds once every 2 years.  For those people who can&#x27;t afford the<br>
Worlds, they can compete yearly in their home country.  For the people<br>
that may miss the US Nationals, they can compete the following year at<br>
the Open, etc.  I just think that as it is right now, one event every<br>
2 years (or yearly if you can afford Worlds+Nationals) is not enough.<br>
 There are pros and cons to this idea, but I think there are more pros<br>
than cons.  With the growing number of cubers, I think we should give<br>
it a try.  We can always just try it for a year or two, and see what<br>
happens.  I think that if we could make this happen, we will have<br>
plenty of support from fellow cubers to do this. I, personally, will<br>
help in any way possible.  I can build the webpage, setup details,<br>
etc.  Let me know what you all think of this.  If you support, or<br>
oppose the idea, please reply here with your thoughts so we can sort<br>
this idea out.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I wanted to ask for some details about the 2007 Worlds. <br>
First off, when, and where will the event be held?  I have heard some<br>
minor details, but I want to confirm them.  I am considering going,<br>
and I want to start planning it out, and saving up if I decide to go.<br>
 If you have any information on it, please let me know.  Thanks<br>

          <div class="email-content">You act like there are no competitions around here.  Since I started
cubing, I have been to twelve competitions, only one of which was US
Nationals and two of which were Worlds.  That&#x27;s still 9 other
competitions.  If you go to Caltech Winter, you will be competing with
almost exactly the same group as US Nationals.

It would probably be best for responses to go to my e-mail, so as not
to junk up the board, I can be found at swed&lt;nospam>ishlf (at)
hot&lt;nospam>mail (dot) com ... remove the &lt;nospam>&#x27;s and place the
appropriate symbols at your leisure.

Anyway I know a while ago this was posted:
http://www.mathschallenge.net/ (go to &quot;project Euler&quot;)and every now
and then when I get bored I go try to solve a couple.  I&#x27;ve run into
one that I really am getting stuck on, problem 87.  I&#x27;ve tried several
times, and always given up before. But I&#x27;ve got a solid approach I
feel this time, and I&#x27;m just not getting it right.

I&#x27;m using Java and if anyone would care to take a look at my code (it
IS commented, though not very well) I&#x27;d appreciate it.  It&#x27;s driving
me batty!

Best,
Daniel

          <div class="email-content">Hi Doug,

Have you resolved this at all?  I&#x27;m having the same 
problem...usually on magic times, where &quot;about 1 second&quot; really, 
really doesn&#x27;t cut it.

Anyway, I have another stackmat problem as well.  I recently 
purchased a tournament display.  The problem is that the end of the 
cord that sticks into the timer isn&#x27;t holding well enough.  So, if I 
am not putting pressure on the cord, it comes out a tiny bit and the 
display goes off.  I can&#x27;t exactly put pressure on it while I&#x27;m 
doing a solve.  I found that if I put a small object right by where 
the cord goes, it holds it in, however, this obstructs the handpads, 
and since I often use the display for magic, it is very inconvenient.

I am beginning to think that I need a new stackmat.  I really don&#x27;t 
want to buy one with a set of cups and a mat and the DVD.  Unless 
anyone has any advice for either problem, I&#x27;ll email speedstacks.

          <div class="email-content">I am very happy with the opportunites so far for competitions. 
Despite living in a less popular cubing area, Detroit, I still 
managed to get in 6 competitions since I started cubing.

If it is not too far like NJ, and I have the travel time availible 
to me, than I just spend a little over $100 to do a roundtrip bus 
ride. A flight to CA seems to be costing me $305-$350 these days. So 
that makes me happy too.

I do think that another minor one should be held in Toronto (or some 
other not-so-far Canadian city) some time in the near future, 
especailly for this continent to equal Europe in number of 
competitions so far this year.

I wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing competitions closer to south-central US like 
TX but maybe slightly more north. NJ is kinda hard to get to, but it 
could be a lot worst. I&#x27;m just glad that we are getting a steady in-
flux of new cubers and cubers that are willing to organize 
competitions for us.

If there will be a &quot;US Open&quot; (btw, that sounds like something from 
golf/tennis to me), then I think it should be somewhere *other than 
CA* to be fair to the US cubers not on either coast.

Mainly, I think we need to lower the startup &quot;costs&quot; for a person 
new at running tournaments to do so. Even if we will be needing a 
WCA delagate to be the only one trusted, and have them bring the 
scrambles and set the schedule based on expected turn-out. A single 
cuber with 2 months of in-community knowledge and a few months of 
cubing exprerience *should* be encouraged to set up a tournament 
where there are none.

I&#x27;m sure a lot of people end up feeling like I do. Planning a tourn. 
yourself half-way and then finding not enough time to see it though, 
especially students. But at the samt time it is college studets that 
have the most resources availible to them, in terms of FUNDING and 
VENUE.

We cubers are a competitive bunch, and we end up putting all our 
time into school and not going to or running enough tournaments. 
This fundemental issue needs to personally addressed by the same 
people who complain that there are not enough tournments for them. 
And as a whole, we need to be offering the proper incentives for 
people to help. Now Europe...., they seem to have their act 
together. I never hear anyone complain anymore that they don&#x27;t have 
enough tourns.

the G-wiz Comp!  And I couldn&#x27;t buy the gen-2 stackmat and timer.  I

I was like, but they did!  I&#x27;ve been asking you to buy it for

          <div class="email-content">Yeah but come on, what is is exactly that you don&#x27;t understand about
the cases?

I must say, if you have just found them as a set of algorithms, and
you don&#x27;t know what they do or why you would learn them, you&#x27;re
probably not experienced enough to be able to utilise them to their
fullest extent.

I would only recommend learning them if you have already mastered pure
CFOP, and feel that it would be beneficial to your times to know
algorithms that both orient and permute the LL corners simultaneously.
If you don&#x27;t have much experience, then it&#x27;s likely that learning them
will slow you down, when you could be using your energy to improve in
other areas.

and it is fine. It now only happens about 1/40 or so.

Did you try replacing the battery yet? Those CR2032 are really 
popular batteries, you can find them everywhere. I am beginning to 
wish they would give those out as part of sticker sets as tourn. 
prizes. That would help.

The more I get into cubing the more expensive this hobby gets....

Probably the FFBB stuff. It doesn&#x27;t really make sense to me, either. I
do understand that it&#x27;s used to recognize the cases and I used to do
it that way, but doing it &quot;intuitively&quot; is better IMO. The way Gilles
Roux lists the CMLL cases is much more understandable. I want to know
what I&#x27;m doing (what corners will cycle).

Well, there are many good cubers that don&#x27;t know what COLL is.

They can be useful if you want to use ELL, or if you want to use them
for 2x2, or if you use Roux, or if you orient edges before LL, etc.
There are many people who haven&#x27;t mastered CFOP and find COLL useful.
Btw, Nobody has mastered CFOP yet if you ask me.

  Probably the FFBB stuff. It doesn&#x27;t really make sense to me, either. I
  do understand that it&#x27;s used to recognize the cases and I used to do
  it that way, but doing it &quot;intuitively&quot; is better IMO. The way Gilles
  Roux lists the CMLL cases is much more understandable. I want to know
  what I&#x27;m doing (what corners will cycle).

  Well, there are many good cubers that don&#x27;t know what COLL is.

  They can be useful if you want to use ELL, or if you want to use them
  for 2x2, or if you use Roux, or if you orient edges before LL, etc.
  There are many people who haven&#x27;t mastered CFOP and find COLL useful.
  Btw, Nobody has mastered CFOP yet if you ask me.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, for each of the 7 corner orientations people align U in a way 
that you only see 4 colors that aren&#x27;t the color belonging to U.  The 
4 colors will be located somewhere at UBL, UBR, UFL, UFR, FUL, or 
FUR, or in other words, on the U corner stickers and the F corner 
stickers.

For example, do this: L&#x27;URU&#x27;LUR2U&#x27;RU&#x27;R&#x27;U2R

You see for colors on U and at F that aren&#x27;t the U color.  So the 
pattern for this case will be:

FL
RF

Because two colors diagonally match and the other two are opposite.  
You always use F for the colors that match, it doesn&#x27;t matter what 
color they are.  Think of it as a square when looking at the pattern 
for the case.  Two colors in the back, two in the front.

Here is another example:  FUR&#x27;U&#x27;RF&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;U2RU&#x27;  The pattern is:

FL
RB

Or you could say it is:
LF
BR

Notice how the two colors on the left are on the same corner?  The 
one on U looks like it should be on the bottom for your square of 
colors but it&#x27;s actually in the back since there is a color on the 
front.

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: US Open / Worlds


  I am very happy with the opportunites so far for competitions. 
  Despite living in a less popular cubing area, Detroit, I still 
  managed to get in 6 competitions since I started cubing.

  If it is not too far like NJ, and I have the travel time availible 
  to me, than I just spend a little over $100 to do a roundtrip bus 
  ride. A flight to CA seems to be costing me $305-$350 these days. So 
  that makes me happy too.

  I do think that another minor one should be held in Toronto (or some 
  other not-so-far Canadian city) some time in the near future, 
  especailly for this continent to equal Europe in number of 
  competitions so far this year.

  I wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing competitions closer to south-central US like 
  TX but maybe slightly more north. NJ is kinda hard to get to, but it 
  could be a lot worst. I&#x27;m just glad that we are getting a steady in-
  flux of new cubers and cubers that are willing to organize 
  competitions for us.

  If there will be a &quot;US Open&quot; (btw, that sounds like something from 
  golf/tennis to me), then I think it should be somewhere *other than 
  CA* to be fair to the US cubers not on either coast.

  Mainly, I think we need to lower the startup &quot;costs&quot; for a person 
  new at running tournaments to do so. Even if we will be needing a 
  WCA delagate to be the only one trusted, and have them bring the 
  scrambles and set the schedule based on expected turn-out. A single 
  cuber with 2 months of in-community knowledge and a few months of 
  cubing exprerience *should* be encouraged to set up a tournament 
  where there are none.

  I&#x27;m sure a lot of people end up feeling like I do. Planning a tourn. 
  yourself half-way and then finding not enough time to see it though, 
  especially students. But at the samt time it is college studets that 
  have the most resources availible to them, in terms of FUNDING and 
  VENUE.

  We cubers are a competitive bunch, and we end up putting all our 
  time into school and not going to or running enough tournaments. 
  This fundemental issue needs to personally addressed by the same 
  people who complain that there are not enough tournments for them. 
  And as a whole, we need to be offering the proper incentives for 
  people to help. Now Europe...., they seem to have their act 
  together. I never hear anyone complain anymore that they don&#x27;t have 
  enough tourns.

The cycle of the corners is also depicted on my page. Just as on Gilles&#x27; page there&#x27;s an arrow 
between the 2 corners that need to be swapped.

Ah, ok. I didn&#x27;t check your site, but I remember that you use the
letter notation. It&#x27;s good that you also show which corners will swap.

you in many situations such as team solves.

But both version can be as fast as each other I think. It all depends on you

          <div class="email-content">Hi,
If you plan on getting a DIY from rubiks.com, I have found the best
cube for me is tight enough that it doesn&#x27;t pop, and then lubricated
with silicone lubricant (not oil!). This results in a stable smooth cube.

If you are going to use a store bought cube, I would suggest working
it in a lot. Then stretch springs (I can&#x27;t remember the link for that
page, sorry). After that, add some silicone, and it should be ok

While I suggest a DIY, if you cant afford it (shipping is crazy), you
can make a store bought pretty close

Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Everyone has a different preference.  Some people have ridiculously loose
cubes.  Other people&#x27;s cubes have a bit more tension in them.  The trade off
is relatively simple.  The looser your cube, the better you need to control
the cube.  There is also an increased risk of pops, but if you can handle
the cube, then you could probably go faster.

If you ever end up at a competition, you could volunteer to scramble for an
event that you&#x27;re not competing in, such as one-handed if that&#x27;s not your
thing.  You&#x27;d get to feel about 30 different cubes.

Nah, 36 frames at 30 fps are 1.2 seconds, hence the filename. But 
it&#x27;s not that fast, here you have 14 turns in 1.2 seconds:

If only I was as fast as you with big cube inner layer turns.

Personally, I&#x27;ve never really gotten good at COLL or learned most of 
the cases, but I don&#x27;t mind the FBRL stuff.  In my head, I interpret 
it as same-same-opposite-whatever, but the FBRL doesn&#x27;t make it hard 
for me.  I don&#x27;t think I could grasp recognition through identifying 
which two have to swap.  I used to do PC before OC, but now I just 
can&#x27;t understand that way of identifying corner permutation.

  Centrally located does not imply a better turnout. I think if it was
  held in Colorado, there would be about 10 people there. It should
  definitely be held somewhere that people actually live. :P

  Somewhere in central Texas, or maybe Colorado, or Kansas. Anyone
  have any ideas on where? We can change it every year.

          <div class="email-content">The limiting factor is probably where there is anyone willing to do  
the practical work of organizing an event like this. Ideally that  
person lives in Kansas City or Chicago, but more likely somewhere  
else, or does not exist at all.

I suppose it *is* possible organize a competition somewhere you don&#x27;t  
live, but it&#x27;s a lot harder. Especially if you&#x27;ve never done it before.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
Just as a little bit of fun, I decided to make a combined world<br>
rankings list. There have been 48 cubers this year who have posted<br>
averages in each of 3x3x3, 4x4x, and 5x5x5 events in WCA recognised<br>
competitions.<br>
<br>
I simply added up their total ranks for each of the 3 events, and then<br>
sorted by the lowest combined ranking total. The results are quite<br>
nice, and I think a good indicator of who is achieving the most as a<br>
cubing &quot;all-rounder&quot;.<br>
<br>
The top 10 in the world?<br>
<br>
1. Lars Vandenbergh (Belgium)<br>
2. Ron van Bruchem  (Netherlands)<br>
3. Frank Morris (USA)<br>
4. Joel van Noort (Netherlands)<br>
5. Matt Walter (Canada)<br>
6. Tomasz Zolnowski (Poland)<br>
7. Chris Hardwick (USA)<br>
8. Michael Fung (Netherlands)<br>
9. Dan Harris (United Kingdom)<br>
10. Milan Baticz (Hungary)<br>
