        I agree, there should be no excuse for your cube being thrown off such a
        large amount. The cube I am using is so loose that corners sometime turn
        in place during my solve (obviously a bad thing) but the point is with
        such a dramatically loose cube, I've never encountered having my cube
        make a quarter turn while stopping my time. I think the majority of the
        time that someone will stop the time and their cube is one turn from
        solved, it is because they just missed making that last turn. -Richard

        Welcome to the group! There are lots of cube solution sites, many of
        which are quite complicated and for more advanced cubers. I'd recommend
        starting with a beginner solution to familiarise yourself with the
        basics. I wrote a beginner solution which I've used to successfully
        teach many people:
        http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html And
        Gilles has recently posted another beginner cube page:

        Welcome, Jasmine probably already replied, but just encase you're still
        looking at solutions I have one at http://www.deepcube.tk

        reason some people say it doesn't, try
        http://www.geocities.com/evanmgates ). I designed my solution to lead up
        to the most popular speed solving method, the Fridrich method. And if

        Or it occurs that they don't complete the turn and try and stop the
        timer. There are a variety of reasons that the cube can be slightly
        misaligned to the point where we would consider it one turn off yet it
        seems too much to disregard the entire solve. 2 seconds is more then an
        apt penalty as it would easily take under one second to fix the one
        turn. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology On Aug 18,

        Hi Stefan There are instructions with the kit (when you buy it) and yes
        it is very easy to find the right screws. It comes with rivets at the
        moment but the Rubik's warehouse in Canada is sourcing a bulk order of
        the right screws and it will come with both. Dave. -----Original

        lubing. The "DIY instructions" link image is a broken link. So if that's
        the cube and it comes unassembled so we can assemble it ourselves (btw,
        is it easy to find fitting screws?) then I have to say it's very poorly
        advertised... Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Where can you find the cube kit? I've been looking all over the &gt;
        rubik's site and can't find a kit. I've found a blank cube, but &gt;
        thats the closest. Can you post a link to it? &gt; &gt; Thx, &gt; Evan

        cube &gt; from &gt; &gt; wal-mart! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        currently have four speed cubes. The first one was an Oddzon &gt; Cube
        in &gt; &gt; the green packaging. It's all right. It turns pretty
        smoothly &gt; but it &gt; &gt; will pop due to the fact that it's been
        worn in a lot. The second &gt; and &gt; &gt; third cube I have are from
        Winning Moves. I think if you buy a &gt; cube from &gt; &gt;
        www.rubiks.com, you get a cube from Winning Moves. Both cubes were &gt;
        &gt; amazing straight out from the box. I speedcube almost exclusively
        &gt; with &gt; &gt; the second cube now. The third cube would probably
        be very good &gt; if it &gt; &gt; cleaned and prepared it. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; The fourth cube was an interesting one. It was an Oddzon cube
        &gt; with arched &gt; &gt; centers. Originally, I was intending on
        selling it to my students &gt; but &gt; &gt; after I lubed it, I decided
        it was way too good to give up. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It jams and gets
        stuck pretty often but hey, it's basically a &gt; brand new &gt; &gt;
        cube. I think unfortunately, the lube will make it harder to &gt; break
        in. &gt; &gt; I'll probably take out the lube some time so it'll wear in
        a bit &gt; more &gt; &gt; effectively. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder why
        they don't put the good stickers on the cubes? Oh &gt; wait. &gt; &gt;
        It's so you have to buy stickers! I think a cube with different &gt;
        colored &gt; &gt; plastics would be awesome. Not tiles that stick out...
        but maybe &gt; plastic &gt; &gt; plates which are at the same level of
        the cube. That would be &gt; cool. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tyson Mao &gt;

        wanted to get a new &gt; &gt; &gt; cube &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for my
        backpack. I have placed one in my car, one in my &gt; &gt; &gt;
        girlfriend's &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; car, one on my desk (the studio cube),
        and one in the living &gt; room &gt; &gt; &gt; so &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a
        cube is never far away. I didn't want to take the studio &gt; cube &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; because I keep it pretty loose and I didn't want it
        popping all &gt; &gt; &gt; over &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the place. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I heard the new rubik's molds are better than before (arched
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; centers) so I went to wal-mart to pick one up. Man
        this cube &gt; &gt; &gt; turns &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more smoothly out of
        the package than my other speedcubes did &gt; &gt; &gt; after &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; about 6 months of use with silicone spray! After lubing it it
        &gt; &gt; &gt; just &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flies! It rivals my studio cube
        for smoothness, and I've had &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; less than 24 hours. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The serial number on the
        bottom of the package was 40851, so &gt; if &gt; &gt; &gt; you &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; can get any from this batch, it might be worth your $9.00.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Thought &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd share! &gt; &gt; &gt;

        PS, just got back from buying my textbooks: 4 books = $455.21 &gt; how
        &gt; &gt; &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that legal?!? Man, when the
        revolution comes... ;) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        OK, the best average is now displayed in the order in which you got the
        times. Before, the times were displayed in the order they were on the

        Hey!! I can't really see that the stacktimer is too big is a problem. As
        long as it fits on the "table" in a tournament there is no problem. And
        if u have ur own private stacktimer u can indeed cut it smaller with
        scissors, as long as u dont cut away the timer, LOL :D Having a cube
        logo on it is not important to me. Now back to my original issue. Yes i
        can see ron's point that ur hands could jump when u want to stop/lap the
        timer. And the recorded time could be higher than when u first
        stopped/lapped the timer. I didn't think about this problem and i can
        see it's a serious one. However i can't see how how laptime would lead
        to "speculative" cubing. One could be given a maximum of say 5 secs to
        carry on if the cube is "accidentally" not solved. If u dont proceed
        during these 5 secs and the cube is not solved then the solve is
        disqualified. And even putting cube down and carrying on will lead to
        losing time compared with a "straight" solve with no interruption due to
        putting it down early. I also sun understnt what is meant by that the
        distance between cube and hand is not standardised. In Amsterdam we
        could put down the cube after preinspection in the orientation we wanted
        and the dostance from our hands that we wanted. I can't see any point in
        standardising this. Obviously u cant be allowed to hold or touch the
        cube/puzzle when u are about to start ur solve. I guess my issue could
        be compared with longjump ;-) Even if u jump 11 meters but ur foot is 1
        cm across the line on "take-off" its disqualified. I always thought is
        should be possible to instead measure from ur actual take-off and not
        the line. Hehe ... So i guess im gonna accept that one won't be allowed
        to carry on solving after putting the puzzle down and getting a time. It
        was just a thought ... Cheers! Happy cubing all :-D -Per &gt; --- In

        [Speed cubing group] StackMats &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        The StackMat has been a reliable timer so far in all the tournaments
        that &gt; &gt; have used them. I believe that if we and the WCA adopt
        the StackMat as &gt; &gt; our official timer, StackMat would be happy to
        "sponsor" us. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Two ideas for the Stackmat are as
        follows. The StackMat really isn't &gt; &gt; designed for cubers.
        Strangely, it has worked brilliantly for our sport. &gt; &gt; First, it
        wouldn't be that hard to put a WCA logo on the timer. Second, &gt; &gt;
        I &gt; &gt; think it also wouldn't be too costly or require much more
        machinery to &gt; &gt; put &gt; &gt; in a tough black plastic that
        doesn't dent. Cup stackers don't have the &gt; &gt; problem of the
        corners of their cup digging into the timer and causing &gt; &gt; dents.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people feel that they would like the timer to
        have a scramble &gt; &gt; generator and an average calculator? Such a
        modification to the existing &gt; &gt; machinery that manufactures the
        timer is not yet available. If we &gt; &gt; support &gt; &gt; StackMat,
        we would have a higher chance of them being able to invest &gt; &gt;
        money &gt; &gt; into our cause. If you really want a scramble generator
        and an average &gt; &gt; calculator, Chris Hunt's Java timer allows you
        to add times which gives &gt; &gt; you exactly what you want. Even
        better is you can display the average &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; copy and
        paste however you want. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have to write a thank you
        e-mail to StackMat for their support in &gt; &gt; supplying eight
        StackMats and tournament displays. I'll run some ideas &gt; &gt; by &gt;
        &gt; them to see what they think. I wouldn't expect any drastic changes
        now &gt; &gt; because our community is still growing. When there is a
        more continuous &gt; &gt; demand for Rubik's Cube timers, I'm sure
        they'll be able to adjust and &gt; &gt; help us. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hey, if you feel your StackMat is too big, Mr. &gt; Scissors can help. I
        don't have a Stackmat. =P Anyway, I'm sure the average person would much
        rather have a good looking slightly smaller Stackmat than one which was
        ruthlessly cut off at a given point. &gt; The distance from the hands to
        the cube isn't standardized because we &gt; don't have a standard
        distance for tournament use. The competitor may not &gt; be in physical
        contact with the cube before he starts the timer. That's &gt; the only
        rule right now. So maybe we should have some standard, then? What I'm
        saying is that for a cube timer, there should be standard positions on
        the mat not only for the hands but also for the cube. &gt; As for the
        last complaint, it is purely artistic and can be trivially &gt; fixed.
        These aren't complaints... I'm just pointing out the wrongs of the
        Stackmat. &gt; As for home use, if you want a program the calculates
        averages, e-mail me, &gt; tell me exactly what you want it to do, and
        I'll program it. I can program perfectly okay myself. That's not the
        point anyway. If I used a Stackmat together with your program, I'd have
        just as much hustle as if I used a Stackmat with Hunt's program. The
        point is that the Stackmat doesn't do what I want, which is to either
        calculate averages or to automatically communicate with a
        device/software that does. &gt; generating scrambles, this question is a
        lot more involved than just &gt; simply putting a scramble generator on
        a timer. For now, we have to &gt; settle for a computer scramble
        generator. I think putting a 25 digit LCD &gt; display on a timer would
        significantly increase the cost. &gt; &gt; The StackMat isn't perfect. A
        perfect timer would have a cube logo and &gt; would probably have your
        name on it as well. However, I do believe that &gt; the StackMat
        satisfies the principles that are very well suited to &gt; speedcubing.
        BUT, there are "imaginary" timers that are BETTER. &gt; A timer that we
        need basically has to follow two main things. It is &gt; started when
        one hand is lifted up and stopped when both hands are placed &gt; down.
        The second item is that the timer is under 60 USD. Otherwise, I &gt;
        think it would be hard to justify another timer. &gt; &gt; Tyson Mao

        as &gt; &gt; &gt; our official timer, StackMat would be happy to
        "sponsor" us. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Two ideas for the Stackmat
        are as follows. The StackMat really &gt; &gt; isn't &gt; &gt; &gt;
        designed for cubers. Strangely, it has worked brilliantly for our &gt;
        &gt; sport. &gt; &gt; &gt; First, it wouldn't be that hard to put a WCA
        logo on the timer. &gt; &gt; Second, I &gt; &gt; &gt; think it also
        wouldn't be too costly or require much more machinery &gt; &gt; to put
        &gt; &gt; &gt; in a tough black plastic that doesn't dent. Cup stackers
        don't have &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; problem of the corners of their
        cup digging into the timer and &gt; &gt; causing &gt; &gt; &gt; dents.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people feel that they would like the
        timer to have a scramble &gt; &gt; &gt; generator and an average
        calculator? Such a modification to the &gt; &gt; existing &gt; &gt; &gt;
        machinery that manufactures the timer is not yet available. If we &gt;
        &gt; support &gt; &gt; &gt; StackMat, we would have a higher chance of
        them being able to invest &gt; &gt; money &gt; &gt; &gt; into our cause.
        If you really want a scramble generator and an &gt; &gt; average &gt;
        &gt; &gt; calculator, Chris Hunt's Java timer allows you to add times
        which &gt; &gt; gives &gt; &gt; &gt; you exactly what you want. Even
        better is you can display the &gt; &gt; average and &gt; &gt; &gt; copy
        and paste however you want. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have to
        write a thank you e-mail to StackMat for their support in &gt; &gt; &gt;
        supplying eight StackMats and tournament displays. I'll run some &gt;
        &gt; ideas by &gt; &gt; &gt; them to see what they think. I wouldn't
        expect any drastic changes &gt; &gt; now &gt; &gt; &gt; because our
        community is still growing. When there is a more &gt; &gt; continuous
        &gt; &gt; &gt; demand for Rubik's Cube timers, I'm sure they'll be able
        to adjust &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; help us. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I'm ordering my stackmat with timer display now... I went over to the
        "Official Rubik Timer" homepage and it looks like they are making
        progress on the new timer, however, I don't think it'll be any more
        useful than a stackmat, especially since I have to wait a few more
        months to get my hands on one. The only benefit I can see with using the
        new timer is the ability to take an average, but the spec sheet doesn't
        say it will have the ability to generate scrambles, so I don't see the
        point. I will still need to be sitting in front of my computer to
        scramble the cube, and it wouldn't take anymore time for me to just type
        the times in too. For the same price, I'll just get a stackmat now and
        save myself some time. -Chris P.S. The journal for the 'official rubik

        I really like the idea of a timer able to take averages and display
        scrambles. I also think that the optics could be constructed in a way to
        minimize cheating. What we have now is a great opportunity to affect the
        final product. With constructive criticism given to the developer i
        think we might change the final product into pretty much whatever we
        want. Great eh? Since stackmat tournament displays can be used with the
        new timer I don't think there will be too much waste of money if buying
        a stackmat now and a "Rubik's Competition Timer" later. I simply think
        we have a great chance to affect the product the way we like it. I
        believe that will be much easier than talking speedstacks into changing
        the stackmat. We might even be able to talk them into switching the
        optics for something similar to the stackmat if thats what we want.

        Just a thought: How tough would it be to get the pinouts from the

        it looks like and how you like it. For me in Germany there's a huge cost
        overhead (shipping, tax, etc) which is why I haven't ordered anything
        from rubiks.com yet. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        about stickers and lubing. &gt; The "DIY instructions" link image is a

        The ready made cubes from Rubiks.com aren't the arched centres &gt; &gt;
        yet, there is &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a bit of stock to go through as the
        site wasn't really &gt; &gt; functioning at &gt; &gt; &gt; the beginning
        of the year. The Winning Moves ones should be in &gt; &gt; most of the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; stores, especially in bigger towns and cities and there
        are some &gt; &gt; clues to &gt; &gt; &gt; look out for; namely that the
        logo is much brighter print due to &gt; &gt; the new &gt; &gt; &gt;
        stickers and there will be a stand included. later in the year &gt; &gt;
        (in time for &gt; &gt; &gt; Christmas) will be a 25th Anniversary cube
        for 2005 with special &gt; &gt; logo (for &gt; &gt; &gt; next year only)
        and different packaging (silver, hexagonal) All of &gt; &gt; these &gt;
        &gt; &gt; will be to the new higher standard. &gt; &gt; &gt; The cube
        kit on rubiks.com is the new design, you don't have to &gt; &gt; use the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; rivets on this and can put in screws instead. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Hope that helps. &gt; &gt; &gt; Dave &gt; &gt; &gt; Seven Towns.

        good cube &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt; wal-mart! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I currently have four speed cubes. The first
        one was an Oddzon &gt; &gt; Cube in &gt; &gt; &gt; the green packaging.
        It's all right. It turns pretty smoothly &gt; &gt; but it &gt; &gt; &gt;
        will pop due to the fact that it's been worn in a lot. The second &gt;
        &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; third cube I have are from Winning Moves. I
        think if you buy a &gt; &gt; cube from &gt; &gt; &gt; www.rubiks.com,
        you get a cube from Winning Moves. Both cubes &gt; were &gt; &gt; &gt;
        amazing straight out from the box. I speedcube almost exclusively &gt;
        &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; the second cube now. The third cube would
        probably be very good &gt; &gt; if it &gt; &gt; &gt; cleaned and
        prepared it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The fourth cube was an
        interesting one. It was an Oddzon cube &gt; &gt; with arched &gt; &gt;
        &gt; centers. Originally, I was intending on selling it to my students
        &gt; &gt; but &gt; &gt; &gt; after I lubed it, I decided it was way too
        good to give up. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It jams and gets stuck
        pretty often but hey, it's basically a &gt; &gt; brand new &gt; &gt;
        &gt; cube. I think unfortunately, the lube will make it harder to &gt;
        &gt; break in. &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll probably take out the lube some time
        so it'll wear in a bit &gt; &gt; more &gt; &gt; &gt; effectively. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder why they don't put the good stickers
        on the cubes? Oh &gt; &gt; wait. &gt; &gt; &gt; It's so you have to buy
        stickers! I think a cube with different &gt; &gt; colored &gt; &gt; &gt;
        plastics would be awesome. Not tiles that stick out... but maybe &gt;
        &gt; plastic &gt; &gt; &gt; plates which are at the same level of the
        cube. That would be &gt; &gt; cool. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tyson

        cube is now my main speedcube. It is &gt; &gt; pretty &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; smooth. The arched centers do cause the cube to jam a tiny bit &gt;
        &gt; more &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but it gets better after being worn in.
        But an occasional jam is &gt; &gt; a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small price to
        pay for a cube that will never pop. It allows my &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        cubing to be much more aggressive. Good cube...but still crappy &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since school is about to start back up, I
        wanted to get a &gt; new &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cube &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; for my backpack. I have placed one in my car, one in my &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; girlfriend's &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; car, one on my desk (the
        studio cube), and one in the living &gt; &gt; room &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        so &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a cube is never far away. I didn't want to
        take the studio &gt; &gt; cube &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because I keep
        it pretty loose and I didn't want it popping &gt; all &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; over &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the place. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        heard the new rubik's molds are better than before (arched &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; centers) so I went to wal-mart to pick one up. Man this
        cube &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turns &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more smoothly
        out of the package than my other speedcubes did &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        after &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about 6 months of use with silicone
        spray! After lubing it it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; flies! It rivals my studio cube for smoothness, and I've had &gt;
        &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; less than 24
        hours. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The serial number on the bottom of the
        package was 40851, so &gt; &gt; if &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; can get any from this batch, it might be worth your
        $9.00. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thought &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd share!

        This idea made me want to post as I think it's something worth while to
        consider. Besides electronically managing a tournament, linking
        timers/devices via USB opens the door to a whole realm of possibilities.
        Heads up events, relays, straight up races... Probably wouldn't be hard
        to set up on-line racing too. Unofficial tournaments could be done in
        real time via an on-line chatroom or something... I don't have a
        Stackmat myself, (in fact I've never seen or used one) but if it could
        link to a P.C., it shouldn't be hard to design some cubing software to
        handle whatever we want. -Howard --- In

        Does anyone want to try this? Are we talking about modifying existing
        stackmats? Or would we need to build a new timer? Watching all the
        olympic swimming relays, a cube relay would be really really fun. I
        think if we can like timers together so that you can't start your timer
        until the other one is stopped... that would work. That way, if the
        second person tries to start before the first person stops their timer,
        his timer won't run and that's how we would check. It might be fun to
        build some cheap timers and try to do this. I believe the StackMat works
        using capacitance. We could make it a lot cheaper by just using a button
        (sacrificing accuracy of course, so I'm not sure the timer could be used
        in competition). I know that Cup Stacking has relays. Does anyone know
        what their rules are? Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        Couldn't we bug the "Rubik's Competition Timer"-designers with all of
        this? It's already stated that the timer will have a computer connection
        to upgrade firmware, so i see lots of possibilities there. It might get

        &gt; Watching all the olympic swimming relays, a cube relay would be
        really &gt; really fun. I think if we can like timers together so that
        you can't &gt; start your timer until the other one is stopped... that
        would work. That &gt; way, if the second person tries to start before
        the first person stops &gt; their timer, his timer won't run and that's
        how we would check. &gt; &gt; It might be fun to build some cheap timers
        and try to do this. I believe &gt; the StackMat works using capacitance.
        We could make it a lot cheaper by &gt; just using a button (sacrificing
        accuracy of course, so I'm not sure the &gt; timer could be used in
        competition). &gt; &gt; I know that Cup Stacking has relays. Does anyone
        know what their rules &gt; are? &gt; &gt; Tyson Mao &gt; MSC #631 &gt;

        obviously that information gets sent through the port in some &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This way, we could still use the stackmats

        the judges take &gt; &gt; care &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; averaging and scrambling, it wouldn't be an issue not having

        I agree with Jasmine - I have learned a similar method like hers and
        they seem to be the best - I have a friend who has started cubing and
        she actually learned and understood the crazy directions that come with
        the cube. However once we showed her Jasmine's method and a few other
        things she will swear by them compared to some of the others out there
        for those who are learning. A plus to these methods is that she has been
        only solving a month and her best time is 55 sec with an avg of min 25

        There doesn't need to be a standard placement of the cube for one. As
        long as the person is not touching the cube, everyone is allowed the
        same advantage. Otherwise you might argue that someone with long fingers
        is closer to the cube than someone with short. Or some bologna argument
        like that. How manys sports allow a penalty when someone is close to
        their goal, but doesn't complete it? Football...well he got a yard away
        from scoring a touchdown, so just give them 5 points instead of 6.
        Basketball...Three point shot rattles out...ahh just give them a point,
        it was close. Baseball...Well...it was a foul ball, but was close to
        being in...so it's in don't worry about it. This is a very silly
        argument of course. My point is allowing an entire turn off is just
        foolish. If the cuber is not able to control this from happening he/she
        just plain needs to work on it. We need to be a little more strict,
        especially on the 2 second penalty their can be some compromise. I can
        at worst see 45 degrees off as an acceptable margin of error. So
        possibly give 30-45 degrees off a 2 second penalty. &lt;30 degrees gives
        no penalty. And &gt;45 degrees is a DNF. I'm simply asking that we give
        an openminded look at the rule in and of itself, and not defend it just
        because it is how we've been doing it. -Richard --- Tyson Mao

        Hi night crawlers, I agree completely. I have read numerous articles and
        books on sleep and dream-sleep. I have seen documentaries, read about
        the neurology behind it. And all the official studies end up concluding
        the same thing. It is humanly not possible to 'train' yourself to 'need'
        less sleep. You will always need the same, probably geneticly
        determined, amount of sleep. Of course it's everyones dream (yeah punt
        intended) to go about doing lots of fun things at night and still feel
        great, but the truth is, lots of people go about doing lots of fun
        things at night and feel horrible during the day. One thing that
        everyone also agrees upon is that taking short naps during the day will
        cut down the hours needed to feel fresh and awake again. But the
        percentage you can take off your normal sleep hours are not that high.
        Another thing is that we need our REM sleep (Rapid Eye Movement, during
        dream sleep) and our deep sleep (having Delta/Theta brain waves) the
        most. When we go to sleep the brain slowly moves from Beta to Apha to
        Delta to sometimes Theta. And so it seems likely that the scarse people
        we all know who can do with 3/4 hours of sleep a night are faster at
        getting there. Again, nothing has been proved. And no drugs are known
        that can accomplish this. It is possible though that some trained yogi
        can put themselves in Theta stage just by meditation while still awake.
        But you know what they have to do. Right: they sit with legs crossed and
        don't move a muscle. So unless you think that is the most fun thing to
        do.... They just found an alternative to give the body what it needs.
        Sleep deprivation training is just one of those ghost story myths that
        need to be taken down once in a while, until some scientist probably
        finds the sleep-gen and decides to take it out..... Final conclusion: no
        scientist can explain why we need to sleep more than 3 hours, and no
        scientist can explain why we dream during sleep. Michiel

        I'm pretty sure noone out there solves the cube by solving a while
        single face first (on the "face" of it very much a beginners method!).
        Nevertheless in my new series of strategies speed and efficiency at
        solving the first face could be critical. Does anyone have any thoughts
        on roughly how many moves an efficient solve of a single face would be
        and clever ideas on how they might go about it? I'm thinking that 16
        might be a pretty good number of moves but I'd like to see it lower!

        The stackmats are perfectly useable, but I'm sure a custom made cube
        timer would be better. My biggest problem is that to get the best times,
        you have to drop the cube from a certain height on the table. The
        3x3x3's can handle the beating pretty well, but I'd be worried about the
        bigger cubes. The fall can also accidentally turn a side and make a
        solved cube unsolved. Even if that is very rare, it's a sticky rule
        question, as is the case where a solved cube breaks from the fall. It is
        a real issue that you can keep turning after you've stopped the clock,
        but I don't think it's a big one. For one thing, it's perfectly possible
        to do it with a stackmat as well, if you you use the "heel" (what *is*
        the english word?) of your hands to touch the sensors. Either way, I
        think it's real hard to use this in real life to get any kind of
        advantage. It's also a bit goofy to have a judge hold their hand over
        the cube. If we're hiding it from view, it should be part of the machine
        so it's done uniformly. That could be done using stackmats as well, so
        it's not a big issue. The Budapest world championships had a timer with
        a photo cell (I think), and I thought it worked real well. -- "The mind

        Hi Richard and other friends, You have an interesting point here. I want
        to give some counter examples. In 100 meter dash you are allowed to have
        a false start. It used to be three! Now it is only 1. And after two
        false starts in total, the third time we will start and false starters
        will be disqualified afterwards. In swimming there are no second
        chances. There is only one start, and whoever starts early will be
        disqualified afterwards. This used to be different until we saw too many
        restarts with too many competitors having to come out of the pool very
        often. So rules in different sports are different. The false start rule
        is there to give competitors a second chance, because there is always a
        lot of tension out there. Every top tennis player can serve correctly.
        Still we have a second serve. (I would love to see tennis get rid of
        second serve!) In gymnastics you will get points even if you do not
        completely or perfectly do a summer sault. If you fall from the balance
        beam, then 0.5 point is subtracted, but you can still have a 9.5 score!
        In ice hockey you can make a bad foul, for which a referee can give you
        a time penalty, but you will only be completely expelled for the really
        bad fouls. In snooker you can make several points in a row. But if your
        last ball is a foul, then you do not lose all the other points you made.
        Your opponent does receive some extra points to punish you. In kayaking
        only time counts, but you receive penalty time if you touch a barricade
        or the wall. I could go on for ever about special rules in sports.
        Anyway, there are several second chances in sports. In our hobby puzzle
        defects and incomplete solves are the main discussion points. They are
        worth a good discussion. We have had that discussion before. The current
        regulations are a result of that discussion. Your points are
        interesting. Still I think that the current incomplete solve rule is: 1)
        fair, because you cannot abuse the rule, the penalty is high enough to
        make you try to prevent an incomplete solve. 2) reasonable, because
        under pressure people tend to make small mistakes. 3) fine, because
        (almost...) everyone can live with it. Have fun, Ron --- In

        penalty. &gt; &lt;30 degrees gives no penalty. And &gt;45 degrees is a
        &gt; DNF. I'm simply asking that we give an openminded &gt; look at the

        far away from a solved puzzle can you get, before you cross the line
        between puzzle defects and pure error. My proposal is this (after some
        thought): a. between 0 and 45 degrees margin in either direction b.
        &lt;45 degree should be seriously reconsidered, and possibly re-adjust
        the criteria for a 2 second penalty to be a little more strict. I really
        think a full turn is too much! On basis of this proposal, it should
        following your first two reasons to keep the rule already in question.
        &gt; 1) fair, because you cannot abuse the rule, the &gt; penalty is
        high enough to make you try to prevent an &gt; incomplete solve. &gt; 2)
        reasonable, because under pressure people tend to &gt; make small
        mistakes. I completely agree, under pressure people do make small
        mistakes. 90 degrees off I think is jumping the boundary between fair,
        and giving too much. And in the same regard, if you are going to give 90
        degree margin of error, why not give 180? Missing the last face turn of
        an algorithm for example can mean a 2 second penalty for someone who
        missed an U' or U, but a DNF for someone who missed an U2 purely because
        the pressure got to them and they weren't able to finish. &gt; 3) fine,
        because (almost...) everyone can live with &gt; it. I mainly enjoyed
        this point. Even if everyone can live with it, perhaps it isn't right?
        There are many things I can live with...such as this rule I'm
        disagreeing with. I am not arguing my point because of a selfish
        alterior motive. Whatever rules are laid down I will go along with. But
        I will exercise my right to not... just accept it because everyone else
        is 'going with the flow'. If I am indeed the only one in this group that
        feels giving 90 degrees is too much, then I will withdraw my argument. I
        still have to stress the importance of seeing both arguments clearly,
        and I have been openminded and willing to listen to everyone else's
        views. &gt; In our hobby puzzle defects and incomplete solves &gt; are

        Hi guys-this is a good discussion here and I thought I would add my 2
        cents. First we must define what the solved state of the cube is. In my
        opinion, it is any state where the face is less than 45 degrees off from
        perfectly aligned. This is beacause if the face is "rounded" to the
        nearest quarter turn, it would be solved. 30 degrees as some have
        mentioned seems rather arbitrary. What makes 30 solved and 31 not? If
        the face is turned more than 45 degrees, I do agree with the +2second
        rule for reasons mentioned earlier. Unless I misunderstood the rules, if
        the face is 180 degrees off, it is a 2 second penalty and not a DNF. Now
        here's another question to think about although it may not occur to
        often, it is still just as important. What if the U(last) face is off by
        90 degrees and then the L face is misaligned by 22 degrees? Is that
        still +2 or a DNF? I say it should be a DNF because 2 faces need to be
        turned and it it turns into not just a misalignment issue but an
        unsolved cube. But to complicate things even further, it is possible to
        have 2 adjacent faces misaligned at the same time, especially with loose
        springy speedcubes. What then? sorry if I added a lot more disorder to a
        problem that seemed close to resolved. --barefoot Chris

        inner corner of the cube on the misaligned face may not cross the inner
        edge of the corresponding middle slice. For more information, see the
        diagram provided by the WRCA. If a cube is misaligned by more than the
        above criteria, a 2 second penalty will be added to the competitor���s
        solve time given that the cube is one quarter turn from the solved state
        otherwise. If a cube is one quarter turn from completion, 2 seconds will
        be added to the solve time. In all other cases, the solve is
        disqualified. Only the resting state of the cube will be considered. The
        cube must come to a complete stop in its solved state in order for the
        cube to be solved. --- "Chris Sz..." &lt;s2chris2@...&gt; wrote: &gt; Hi

        it should be a DNF because 2 faces need to be &gt; turned and it it &gt;
        turns into not just a misalignment issue but an &gt; unsolved cube. But
        &gt; to complicate things even further, it is possible to &gt; have 2

        The appeal of any ruling is to be made to the tournament director. All
        decisions made by the tournament director under supervision of the WRCA
        are final. The WRCA will consider all appeals after the day of the
        tournament. I only question the last sentence of this ruling. If all
        decisions made by the tournament director are final, then where is room
        for appeals on the following day? I'm assuming this scenario doesn't
        occur often anyway. Also, if appeals are considered, isn't the next day

        A cube is solved when all 6 sides are restored to &gt; solid color

        to be solved. If a piece &gt; is ejected as the cube is placed down but
        it otherwise &gt; solved, the cube is not considered to be in a solved
        &gt; state. If a center cap is ejected from the cube, the &gt; cube,

        StackMat defects. I saw several competitors who had to slap the circles
        2-3 times to get the time to stop. I also recall judges having
        stopwatches at hand. If our stackmat doesn't stop, are we able to use
        the judges time? Or are we only allowing margin of error on the cube
        solve itself, and not stopping the timer? Just curious... Another
        Issue...I remember at RWC for megaminx event. A friend and I were
        competing in this event. When he reached his orientation he realized
        that a corner had been flipped incorrectly. This ended up this way
        because whoever scrambled it, may have popped a piece and put it back in
        wrong. The did not get the incorrectly flipped corner as a result of his
        own actions on the minx. Which brings me to my question. If in a rare
        case we do get a puzzle with a piece put in it wrong, are we able to
        challenge that, or is it assumed we caused the defect? And just a
        question...It may have been just me, but I would have liked to listen to
        music with my headphones while on stage. Is this allowed? -Richard

        I had thought it's a DNF if one face is 180 degrees off? Personally, I
        am happy with the 2 second penalty for 90 degrees off (and I am also
        very happy to see that we're all good enough friends that people can
        completely disagree with this and we can have a good debate on the
        issue!) I think one face being 90 degrees off is quite a different
        situation to one face being 180 degrees off. Why? Well, because 180
        degrees tends to suggest that the person actually didn't complete the
        final algorithm, whereas (I would guess that) the situation where one
        face is, say, 45 to 90 degrees off is most likely to happen: (i) when
        the cuber completed the algorithm but the face turned when they dropped
        it on the timer at the end of the solve; or (ii) the cuber was nervous
        on stage, their hands were shaking and they accidentally used slightly
        too much or too little force for the final flick. Arguably, in these two
        situations the cube has not been solved (Richard - I imagine this might
        be your view? And that the cuber needs to work on their technique and
        get more practice using a stackmat?) However, in both of the situations
        I described in the previous paragraph, the cuber has not acted
        dishonestly. I'd guess that it's reasonably unlikely that either of the
        situations would lead to the final face being 180 degrees off, and thus
        I don't think 180 degrees off should be treated the same as 90 degrees
        off. Even if the situations did lead to the face being 180 degrees off,
        we have to draw the line somewhere, and I guess I'd draw it at 90
        degrees. If we allowed 180 degrees then the final face could be in *any*
        position and the solve would still be counted (even if with a penalty)
        and this doesn't seem right. For these reasons, and the reasons posted
        earlier by Ron, I think the 2 second penalty for 90 degrees off is okay.
        However, 180 degrees off is probably stretching it too far. Jasmine.

        I tend to lean towards this and this is how I treated the US Nationals.
        180 degrees is more frequently caused by a person turning the last turn
        the wrong way which as Jasmine says, is different from the principles of
        something being 90 degrees off. And when we say 90 and 180 degrees, what
        we really mean is quarter-turn and half-turn. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        &gt; &gt; Personally, I am happy with the 2 second penalty for 90
        degrees off &gt; (and I am also very happy to see that we're all good
        enough friends &gt; that people can completely disagree with this and we
        can have a good &gt; debate on the issue!) &gt; &gt; I think one face
        being 90 degrees off is quite a different situation &gt; to one face
        being 180 degrees off. Why? Well, because 180 degrees &gt; tends to
        suggest that the person actually didn't complete the final &gt;
        algorithm, whereas (I would guess that) the situation where one face
        &gt; is, say, 45 to 90 degrees off is most likely to happen: &gt; (i)
        when the cuber completed the algorithm but the face turned when &gt;
        they dropped it on the timer at the end of the solve; or &gt; (ii) the
        cuber was nervous on stage, their hands were shaking and &gt; they
        accidentally used slightly too much or too little force for the &gt;
        final flick. &gt; &gt; Arguably, in these two situations the cube has
        not been solved &gt; (Richard - I imagine this might be your view? And
        that the cuber &gt; needs to work on their technique and get more
        practice using a &gt; stackmat?) However, in both of the situations I
        described in the &gt; previous paragraph, the cuber has not acted
        dishonestly. &gt; &gt; I'd guess that it's reasonably unlikely that
        either of the &gt; situations would lead to the final face being 180
        degrees off, and &gt; thus I don't think 180 degrees off should be
        treated the same as 90 &gt; degrees off. Even if the situations did lead
        to the face being 180 &gt; degrees off, we have to draw the line
        somewhere, and I guess I'd &gt; draw it at 90 degrees. If we allowed 180
        degrees then the final face &gt; could be in *any* position and the
        solve would still be counted &gt; (even if with a penalty) and this
        doesn't seem right. &gt; &gt; For these reasons, and the reasons posted
        earlier by Ron, I think &gt; the 2 second penalty for 90 degrees off is
        okay. However, 180 &gt; degrees off is probably stretching it too far.

        here and I thought I would add &gt; my &gt; &gt; 2 cents. First we must
        define what the solved state of the cube &gt; is. &gt; &gt; In my
        opinion, it is any state where the face is less than 45 &gt; &gt;
        degrees off from perfectly aligned. This is beacause if the face &gt;
        &gt; is "rounded" to the nearest quarter turn, it would be solved. 30
        &gt; &gt; degrees as some have mentioned seems rather arbitrary. What
        makes &gt; 30 &gt; &gt; solved and 31 not? If the face is turned more
        than 45 degrees, I &gt; do &gt; &gt; agree with the +2second rule for
        reasons mentioned earlier. Unless &gt; I &gt; &gt; misunderstood the
        rules, if the face is 180 degrees off, it is a 2 &gt; &gt; second
        penalty and not a DNF. Now here's another question to think &gt; &gt;
        about although it may not occur to often, it is still just as &gt; &gt;
        important. What if the U(last) face is off by 90 degrees and then &gt;
        &gt; the L face is misaligned by 22 degrees? Is that still +2 or a DNF?
        &gt; I &gt; &gt; say it should be a DNF because 2 faces need to be
        turned and it it &gt; &gt; turns into not just a misalignment issue but
        an unsolved cube. But &gt; &gt; to complicate things even further, it is
        possible to have 2 &gt; adjacent &gt; &gt; faces misaligned at the same
        time, especially with loose springy &gt; &gt; speedcubes. What then?
        sorry if I added a lot more disorder to a &gt; &gt; problem that seemed
        close to resolved. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --barefoot Chris &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Another idea for a new timer could be a pad that works kinda like a
        weight scale. All you'd have to do is drop the cube and the timer would
        sense the cubes weight and stop the time. The only problem would that if
        you dropped the cube by accident or maybe if you had a pop, the timer
        would stop. This is how I thought the Stack mat worked when I first saw

        I do this too. Most people associate the two generator group as R and U
        moves, but for solving the F2L, you must also use L and U moves for
        solving pairs in FL or BL. A lot of the cases require only those two

        cube once to get the pair in position to solve it. Andy

        Hi I think making the contestant stop the timer himself is actually
        totally unfair. I know it is custom, but when athletes run the 100m
        sprint they don't have to press a button to let the judges know they're
        finished. And I thought the stopwatches at WC2003 were making for a fair
        competition. Also video analysis to me sounds fair. You did solve it in
        time xx.xx so why not register that? And for an unsolved cube (&gt;45
        degrees), that would not be a solution, so I think we all would agree on
        that one. I don't prefer the stackmat. I am having difficulty stopping
        the timer and I don't like to make a sport out of hitting the stop pads
        fast. I think a smaller one with a PC interface would be ideal. Then you
        can easily hook 'em up to any big display and super computer if you
        like. Michiel ----- Original Message ----- From: "Tyson F. Mao"

        All, I've read some really interesting ideas for timer features and
        designs that differ from the StackMat. However I wanted to bring up one
        "feature" of the StackMat that can't be beat: It's a real device, not
        theoretical, actually in existence, currently being sold and available
        to us at a pretty reasonable cost (considering it's the only thing out
        there of its kind). :-) When a different one is available for sale I'll
        consider it. Until then, if we're going to buy a timer pad, I think it's
        going to have to be a StackMat! Adam --- In

        like a &gt; weight scale. All you'd have to do is drop the cube and the
        timer &gt; would sense the cubes weight and stop the time. The only
        problem &gt; would that if you dropped the cube by accident or maybe if
        you had a &gt; pop, the timer would stop. This is how I thought the
        Stack mat &gt; worked when I first saw it. &gt; &gt; Tomer

        I can bend on the timer thing, although I think if we compensate for
        error on solving, we should put though into compensating for problems
        with stopping the timer. In regards to the music thing, it could be
        distracting to other competitors if loud. But is possible to listen to
        music at a reasonable volume without distracting anyone. (I think).

        Hey everyone, I had a new experience for me when fixing up a new
        speedcube and just thought I would share. The cube is a Studio cube, but
        it turns out that one of the corner pieces is messed up. You can tell
        that it was poorly molded, such that one of the 3 inner sides has an
        extra layer on it and is too thick. That thicker side pushes on the
        adjacent edge a little bit, forcing it outward and tightening the cube
        up a bit. The cube also pops when I turn it too quickly. What's so weird
        about this cube is that it is an AWESOME speed cube. What makes this
        cube so nice is that I have to slow down slightly from full speed in
        order to avoid that corner piece from popping. Slowing down like this
        allows me to look ahead really well during the F2L, and I've been
        getting some really amazing overall times (for me). Also, when I go at
        that slower speed the cube has hardly any problem with pops, only when I
        go too quickly does it really become a problem. I even broke my fastest
        3x3x3 official rules average on this cube, after only a day of working
        it in! My new average is 17.30 seconds, and I think sub-17 will be
        possible pretty soon. Aaaah!!! My cube has a messed up piece, pops if I
        go too quickly, and is a little too tight, and yet it is one of the best
        I have ever owned!!! ????!?!?!?!!?!?!??!!??!?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!?!?!!!?!?

        So i was really bored today, i mean so bored the cube couldn't save me,
        so i made a weird observation (check the title). So if you look at time
        barriers that people try to break starting at 25 seconds, it goes as
        follows: 25 20 17 15 and at this point it becomes one second intervals i
        would imagine so 14 13 etc. Well looking at differences, we have 5, 3,
        2, 1, 1, if you reverse this, 1 1 2 3 5, its the fibonaci(sp) sequence.
        wherein you take the last two numbers and add them to get the next
        number in the sequence. So yeah, i was really bored Evan

        That's really neat, just another natural occurance of the number phi. I
        can't verify this because I'm just now getting to be pseudo-consistantly
        sub 20, but maybe I should now shoot for sub 17 instead of sub 19 :)
        However, I personally don't remember trying to break the 32s or 45s
        barrier. I think until I got down to 40s, I was mainly going by 10s, and
        once sub 40 I started to go by 5s intervals. Doug Reed Evan wrote:

        Actually, I've been having a good few weeks and just wanted to share my
        excitement! I got a new single solve record (23.12s) and a new best
        average of 10 (35.57s). :) Unlike most people, I tend to practice more
        *after* a competition than before. I practice a bit before competitions,
        but since I'm yet to make it past the qualification round at any
        competition (let alone any further!), I don't take it too seriously and
        I'm really just there to have fun. Anyway, what happened after Worlds,
        and again after the US Nationals, is that I got all inspired by all you
        super speedcubers and started praticising a lot more. The main thing
        I've been working on recently is making proper use of inspection time.
        Previously, I was only planning 1, maybe 2, arms of the cross during
        inspection. Now, I'm planning 3, and often all 4, arms of the cross.
        This has knocked seconds off my time! :) The other thing I've been doing
        is practising looking ahead during the F2L (which, of course, is what
        everyone always says to do!). I've been slowing my turn rate slightly,
        but more than making up for it by reducing the pause between algs. Yay!

        My current aim is to get my 'real' average to be under 40s. I've done
        many single sub-40s averages, and so I was curious how my 'real' average
        was going. So, tonight I did 100 solves with Jess Bonde's timer. The
        result? 39.47 seconds! I was pretty happy with this, but it got me
        thinking - is 100 enough? Should I be doing several hundred? One
        thousand? Obviously, the more solves the better, but at what point can I
        claim the 'average' to be my real average? Jasmine

        I think a lot of it is mental. Right now, I'm at the point where a 22
        second solve is average and if it's over 23 seconds, I think it's bad.
        So if you asked me what my average average was, I'd say 22 seconds. My
        best average is 20.78 but a best average comes during the best
        circumstances and not many people carry that around with them all the
        time. I'd say you can claim your average to be your real average with
        whatever time you think is fine. If your average of 100 is 39.47
        seconds, I'd say you've definitely proven to yourself and everyone else
        that you can solve a cube consistently under 40 seconds. Part of how I
        try to improve is by lowering the bar. I used to be at the 25 second
        average where I thought 25 seconds was okay and 27 seconds was slow. I
        mentally had to tell myself to be discontent with the 25 second solve
        and eventually, the numbers became 23 and 25. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        Sitting and standing I feel should be both allowed. As long as all
        competitions allow competitors to choose to either sit or stand, I see
        no problem with it. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        We compensate for error on solving because inherently there is an error
        to aligning a face. I don't feel that compensation of the timer is as
        necessary because the timer is a definite accurate thing. If you put
        your hands on the sensors with your palms flat, the timer will stop. If
        the timer doesn't stop, it's most likely because you missed the timer.
        It would take an extra .3 seconds to then stop the timer which is
        already like a compensation. I really do believe it is the competitor's
        responsibility to stop the timer themselves. The timer, as I said, is
        concrete and definite and quantized. The stopwatch is not accurate
        enough to account for records. Records for the 3x3x3 speed solve
        competition will definitely be depending on hundredths and a human is
        not accurate enough for that. As for video, again, we're going to have
        problems determining when a competitor starts his solve and when it
        ends. Does it end when the cube is put down? When he makes the last
        turn? If it is the last turn, then when is the last turn done? Etc. My
        feeling is that the StackMat right now is an accurate and reliable way
        of timing the competitor. As for music, I don't feel like the competitor
        should have anything up there with him but himself. (And clothes...
        because not everyone is over 18.) Just you and the cube... this is far
        fetched, but would if someone put music that provided algorithms or
        something? I'm pretty sure they don't allow music when people take
        standardized tests. As for a reasonable volume, that's also kind of
        relative. I personally have a pretty low tolerance to noise levels (not
        that I would be distracted probably) but I can see how someone could
        hear your music even when you think it's very soft. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        Yeah, I know what you mean by what you 'feel' is your real average, and
        the times that you 'feel' happy with. At the moment, I'm happy with
        anything under 40.xx. For 40-42.xx, I'm not happy or unhappy. I feel
        that anything over 43 seconds is not so good, unless there are
        particular circumstances, eg. not warmed up, inadequate lighting. The
        fact that I didn't feel happy with a solve unless it was 40.xx or under,
        made me wonder my average had reached 40.xx. I figured the only way to
        know was to do a huge bunch of solves and check the numbers. Jasmine.

        is too much! &gt; &gt; On basis of this proposal, it should following
        your &gt; first two reasons to keep the rule already in &gt; question.
        &gt; &gt;&gt; 1) fair, because you cannot abuse the rule, the &gt;&gt;
        penalty is high enough to make you try to prevent an &gt;&gt; incomplete
        solve. &gt;&gt; 2) reasonable, because under pressure people tend to
        &gt;&gt; make small mistakes. &gt; &gt; I completely agree, under
        pressure people do make &gt; small mistakes. 90 degrees off I think is
        jumping the &gt; boundary between fair, and giving too much. And in &gt;
        the same regard, if you are going to give 90 degree &gt; margin of
        error, why not give 180? Missing the last &gt; face turn of an algorithm
        for example can mean a 2 &gt; second penalty for someone who missed an
        U' or U, but &gt; a DNF for someone who missed an U2 purely because the
        &gt; pressure got to them and they weren't able to finish. &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; 3) fine, because (almost...) everyone can live with &gt;&gt;
        it. &gt; &gt; I mainly enjoyed this point. Even if everyone can &gt;
        live with it, perhaps it isn't right? There are many &gt; things I can
        live with...such as this rule I'm &gt; disagreeing with. I am not
        arguing my point because &gt; of a selfish alterior motive. Whatever
        rules are laid &gt; down I will go along with. But I will exercise my
        &gt; right to not... just accept it because everyone else &gt; is 'going
        with the flow'. If I am indeed the only one &gt; in this group that
        feels giving 90 degrees is too &gt; much, then I will withdraw my
        argument. I still have &gt; to stress the importance of seeing both
        arguments &gt; clearly, and I have been openminded and willing to &gt;
        listen to everyone else's views. &gt; &gt;&gt; In our hobby puzzle
        defects and incomplete solves &gt;&gt; are the main &gt;&gt; discussion
        points. They are worth a good discussion. &gt;&gt; We have had that
        &gt;&gt; discussion before. The current regulations are a &gt;&gt;
        result of that &gt;&gt; discussion. &gt;&gt; Your points are
        interesting. Still I think that the &gt;&gt; current &gt;&gt; incomplete
        solve rule is: &gt;&gt; 1) fair, because you cannot abuse the rule, the
        &gt;&gt; penalty is high &gt;&gt; enough to make you try to prevent an
        incomplete &gt;&gt; solve. &gt;&gt; 2) reasonable, because under
        pressure people tend to &gt;&gt; make small &gt;&gt; mistakes. &gt;&gt;
        3) fine, because (almost...) everyone can live with &gt;&gt; it.

        My point &gt;&gt; is &gt;&gt;&gt; allowing an entire turn off is just
        foolish. If &gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt;&gt; cuber is not able to control this
        from happening &gt;&gt;&gt; he/she just plain needs to work on it. We
        need to &gt;&gt; be &gt;&gt;&gt; a little more strict, especially on the
        2 second &gt;&gt;&gt; penalty their can be some compromise. I can at
        &gt;&gt; worst &gt;&gt;&gt; see 45 degrees off as an acceptable margin
        of &gt;&gt; error. &gt;&gt;&gt; So possibly give 30-45 degrees off a 2
        second &gt;&gt; penalty. &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;30 degrees gives no penalty.
        And &gt;45 degrees is &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt;&gt; DNF. I'm simply asking
        that we give an openminded &gt;&gt;&gt; look at the rule in and of
        itself, and not defend &gt;&gt; it &gt;&gt;&gt; just because it is how
        we've been doing it. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; -Richard &gt;&gt;&gt; ---

        Yes Stefan I did mean face - the issue is that with my last 2 layer
        (L2L) strategies especially in the L2L4 case you solve a single "top"
        face and then with your next four looks you solve a middle edge and part
        of the LL finally finishing with the 4th middle edge and the last part
        of the LL. The middle edge and LL 4 looks takes approx 43 moves although
        i think with slightly better optimised algs it could be 41 or 42. Unless
        you can solve the very first face in less than 15 at speed its really
        not that great a system. Big disappointment. I will put the whole thing
        up on awebsite the week after next when I have some spare time. Thanks

        I think you are being a little anal about this whole thing to be honest.
        And I think that I should be able to do anything on stage if: a) it does
        not classify as cheating b) does not infringe on the rights of other
        cubers or the audience. In regards to the algorithms bit, I have serious
        doubts as to whether or not you could even make that effective....And
        even if you could, who's going to do that! From what you're saying with
        the cheating via discman thing, I would say that competitors must take
        out their hearing aids if they have one, because it could be a device
        for transmitting algorithms! Careful inspecting eye glasses also, to
        make sure no algs are skewered upon the lens. I really have a lot more
        faith in the cubing community, so much in fact I am not worried in the
        least that anyone will cheat in any way shape or form. You say
        reasonable volume is 'relative'. This is true. That doesn't mean I'm
        going to blast it. Hey, I have a compromise though...I think it's fair.
        When you meet with all your judges to go over official rules, bring a
        discman in, turn it up to an acceptable volume. This way all your judges
        will know what is too loud. Then it can be the judges discretion as to
        whether or not it is too loud. Also, at a fellow competitors request to
        turn off my headphones I would be more than happy to oblige. Also, are
        their rules for the volume of the audience? Since we are concerned with
        competitors being distracted, can we just tell them to be quiet. Or
        maybe if someone is just being too loud can I ask a TD to remove them?
        We really should be careful with how we weigh this distraction thing I
        think. -Richard As for music, I don't feel like the competitor should
        have anything up there with him but himself. (And clothes... because not
        everyone is over 18.) Just you and the cube... this is far fetched, but
        would if someone put music that provided algorithms or something? I'm
        pretty sure they don't allow music when people take standardized tests.
        As for a reasonable volume, that's also kind of relative. I personally
        have a pretty low tolerance to noise levels (not that I would be
        distracted probably) but I can see how someone could hear your music
        even when you think it's very soft. --- Tyson Mao &lt;tmao@...&gt;

        The reason why we are being strict with everything is because a strict
        and well defined set of rules will help establish cubing as a legitimate
        activity. The idea of having a discman at a competition is not
        unreasonable. However, your idea of checking the relative volumes is.
        The fewer things that I have to worry about, and I'm not saying that a
        discman is a bad thing, the better. Running a tournament is a lot of
        work and I am doing things almost every single second the tournament is
        running. The night before US Nationals, I easily stayed up until 3:30 AM
        in preparation for the tournament in which I was awake at 7 AM setting
        up. Getting together a judge's meeting to listen to the volume of a
        discman is a lot of effort and I guarantee that it won't happen. Until
        people start getting paid to be judges, it's not going to be happen.
        With that all said, I'd like to clarify that I'm not ruling out the idea
        of a discman. You would like a cd player so you could listen to music
        and just be more comfortable? Is there anything more to the cd player
        than just comfort? (And comfort could just be fine.) Tyson Mao MSC #631

        If all you wanted to do was set up informal tournaments here and there
        and have gatherings, then you could allow people to do almost whatever
        they wanted. However, we're trying to set up an international
        organization with standards and regulations. We need to be able to come
        up with documentation so that when people read our regulations and
        procedures, they can exactly reproduce everything. I am being anal and
        strict because it is necessary. It is far easier to be strict now and
        relax later than it is to go the other way around. Furthermore, we are
        trying to set up an international organization. I believe there are

        Okay, so I took a shower and thought about the headphone and music
        thing. I think what we need to do is come up with every hypothetical
        problem with the headphones. If we can answer all of them satisfactorily
        and there are no major problems or issues, I see no reason not to allow
        headphones and music. This is the one I came up with. The judge gives a
        few verbal commands as defined by the rules. What happens if a
        competitor misses this commands as a result of the music and a two
        second penalty or disqualification penalty is issued against them. Do
        they get a do-over because the judge wasn't loud enough? Is it the
        judge's responsibility to make sure the competitor can hear instructions
        if his ears are obstructed? Does the penalty follow? Does the procedure
        for someone with headphones differ from someone without headphones. As

        taking on the 'privelage' of wearing a headphones/listening to music,
        they must also take on the responsibility that follows. This includes
        being alert of the judges commands. Very similiar to this is an example.
        Perhaps someone will find relevance. When I took my driving test an old
        woman was assigned to put me to the road test. When we were both buckled
        up in the car, she told me I could listen to the radio if it felt more
        comfortable, but if it was too loud to hear her instructions, and I
        missed something, I would simply fail. &gt;Is it the &gt; judge's
        responsibility &gt; to make sure the competitor can hear instructions if
        &gt; his ears are &gt; obstructed? It is should indeed be the
        competitor's responsibility. Once again, being entitled to the
        privelage, the competitor must take on the responsibility. &gt;Does the
        penalty follow? Of course. &gt;Does the &gt; procedure for someone &gt;
        with headphones differ from someone without &gt; headphones. Not at all.
        All the same rules should apply. Now that these questions can be
        answered, I think people will keep their headphones at a reasonable
        volume to ensure they don't miss something themselves. &gt; As for

        46 etc. - or more to the point who jumps down from 46 to 33 - that's a
        big leap). I think your sequence can be explained more easily by the
        fact that they are all multiples of 5 except for 17 and 17 is a famous
        benchmark time in speed-cubing because in the most widely used system
        (Jessica Fridrich's) the statement right at the start is that with the
        system it's possible to solve the cube in 17 seconds. Except for that
        the sequence is just multiples of 5 which seems a fairly natural system
        to use for people using base 10 (not all people do, maybe others would
        have a different set of benchmarks). I imagine a 30 second (half minute)
        barrier would likely be more of a target than a 33 second barrier. &gt;

        I see no reason why the rules even for an international orginazation
        have to be strict. I say let the competitors do whatever they want as
        long as it is not cheating or distracting/offensive to another
        competitor. It is my belief that rules should be as fundamental as
        possible. What a competitor chooses to do is entirely their
        responsibility and there is no need for judges/organizers to make
        changes for them. To reiterate a quote I like that Jonas posted earlier:

        I guess I feel more conservative about this in that I don't agree with
        allowing headphones, however I have gotten very fast averages while
        listening to music before. I know that the official poker World
        Championships (televised on ESPN late at night alllllll the time) allow
        headphones. Half the people think it is a good idea, and half don't.
        Personally about 90% of the time music only helps to hurt my
        concentration and get me slower times. Sometimes though a song fits with
        my pacing at the time and I am able to find a steady rhythm that follows
        the song. However, since 90% of the time I prefer no music, I would not
        be too happy in a competition if I heard the music from someone's
        headphones bleeding through. This could be solved with those headphones
        that cup all the way around your ears, but then again that costs money
        which is a whole separate issue. I know that most of the people who are
        in favor of headphones would be respectful and keep their volume down,
        but what about people who are at their first competition, and find out
        that headphones are allowed? As long as we have a VERY strict definition
        of what constitutes too loud for headphones, then I personally would
        have no qualms with headphones. My suggestion would be, music is too
        loud if it can be heard at all (even if quietly) by the judge, who is
        the closet person to the competitor at the time, or something similar.

        couldn't save &gt; me, so i made a weird observation (check the title).
        So if you look &gt; at time barriers that people try to break starting
        at 25 seconds, it &gt; goes as follows: 25 20 17 15 and at this point it
        becomes one second &gt; intervals i would imagine so 14 13 etc. Well
        looking at &gt; differences, we have 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, if you reverse this,
        1 1 2 3 5, &gt; its the fibonaci(sp) sequence. wherein you take the last
        two &gt; numbers and add them to get the next number in the sequence.
        &gt; &gt; So yeah, i was really bored &gt; Well, if that were true you'd
        not go to 14, 13 etc. you'd stay at 15 first. (0 comes next.) I don't
        buy this argument though (who try's to break 33 or 46 etc. - or more to
        the point who jumps down from 46 to 33 - that's a big leap). I think
        your sequence can be explained more easily by the fact that they are all
        multiples of 5 except for 17 and 17 is a famous benchmark time in
        speed-cubing because in the most widely used system (Jessica Fridrich's)
        the statement right at the start is that with the system it's possible
        to solve the cube in 17 seconds. Except for that the sequence is just
        multiples of 5 which seems a fairly natural system to use for people
        using base 10 (not all people do, maybe others would have a different
        set of benchmarks). I imagine a 30 second (half minute) barrier would
        likely be more of a target than a 33 second barrier. &gt; Evan &gt;

        I do agree that there is a professional issue. We should also keep in
        mind, though, that we have evolved since 1982 and I bet at least half of
        everyone here was not even born in 1982 so we should take any standards
        that they set as the law. As for standing... would you advocate
        mandatory standing during the 5x5x5 solve? Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        Everyone has presented issues against wearing headphones. Here are some
        concerns: * Distraction- If the volume is too loud it could distract
        other competitors. solution-The volume may not exceed that of a whisper.
        If the judge thinks he/she is exceeding this point then the the
        competitor will be asked to remove the headphones. ^And if everyone is
        going to be so finicky about distractions, I would ask that no one talks
        on stage during my solve. I actually find talking very distracting.
        *Image- Why does everyone care if it looks 'silly' or unprofessional. I
        had a friend that had blue hair at RWC 03'. This was not professional at
        all, and in my opinion, looked quite silly. Still he was allowed to
        compete. If we have to set standards for how people 'appear' on stage
        this is not fair _AT_ALL_! *Cheating- Everyone against the headphones
        are clinging on to this idea, as if it's actually reaslistic. I think we
        should create an environment where people are most comfortable, and in
        doing this, everyone will do better. If someone wants to listen to
        headphones and sit down while doing 5x5, and they are most comfortable
        doing this, I think it should be fine. We should stop being so concerned
        about how people look on stage, and start thinking about how we can help
        people perform better on stage. And comfort does help. And now that I
        think about it, appearance shouldn't hold a case against this anyway.
        That point is invalid. The cheating point is what is silly. And the
        distraction thing is easily solved. -Richard --- Brent Morgan

        Howdy all, A lot of people would agree that listening to music can make
        some things easier, or just help you relax. I think that music is great
        when I'm taking a run outside, and it sometimes accompanies my best
        cubing averages. I also find that sitting next to the fan in my room
        sometimes helps me achieved better times as well, because it gets so
        humid in Washington. Sometimes I even walk around the room while solving
        to stretch my legs... My point is, if we are to allow competitors to do
        what ever they want to 'be comfortable', where do we draw the line? Is
        it fair to allow one person to listen to music, and not allow another to
        sit next to their mom (or something weird like that). People do lots of
        things to be more comfortable. I know that listening to music while
        competing in any other official setting is usually not encouraged, so I
        don't think it should be here. I would have LOVED to listen to music
        while running the 3200 meter race in track. It just doesn't seem
        professional. Just my 2 cents. Please don't harass me ;) -Chris

        With regards to headphones in a competition I tend to agree with some
        others here. As long as it cannot be heard by others on stage at the
        time then we should allow it. As was stated before, headphones were
        allowed in the World Poker Tour, and they play for ALOT!!!!! more money
        then we ever will. I think we should do anything within reason to make
        ourselves comfortable to acheive our best times. I would abide by a
        judges decision in this matter. As long as gudielines were set out
        before the event started and agreed upon by all contestants. --- In

        Hmm.. Ok.. Here are my opinions on the following... Headphones: I don't
        feel that they should be allowed. Or earplugs for that matter. I think
        that anything used to tune out pressure, noise, or whatever should not
        be allowed.. Listening to music is something we do while practicing, not
        competing. I don't think that competitions should be structured around
        making competetors "comfortable". Sitting/Standing: Hmm.. I think that
        we should all have to stand, maybe because that is how it has been in
        both previous world championships. However, maybe it would be ok if a
        competetor starting the competition either standing or sitting and stuck
        with his/her choice throughout the rest of his/her solves. Hmm.. not
        sure it that makes much of a difference, but like I have said, I don't
        think that competitions should be comfortable.. after all, we are
        testing our skills. let's face it.. your competition times show how good
        you really are. Shouldn't those times be achieved without crutches?

        &gt;Shouldn't those times be achieved &gt;without crutches? &gt; &gt; I
        don't see how a chair can act as a "crutch" for your times. I agree that
        these competitions do show your skills in whatever area you're
        competing. If you can average 3:40 on the 5x5x5 while sitting down, but
        can't break 4:00 standing up (as unlikely as it may seem), then does
        that mean that in competitions, your 3:40 average time shouldnt matter,
        and that as far as the competition is concerned, you average 4 minutes?
        I didn't compete in the 5x5x5 category at the US Nationals, but my times
        on the 4x4x4 were nothing out of the ordinary for me. So I can see that
        if sitting down during a 4x4x4 solve (I normally stand, btw) yielded
        1:30 solves on average, sitting down would have helped a lot. If you're
        consistantly faster while sitting down, and you allways sit down while
        you practice, then doesn't sitting down during a competition yield a
        more accurate representation of your skills? Same for if you stand up.
        What if one of the competitors is handicapped and depends on a wheel
        chair? Does he get to sit (considering he may not be physically able to
        stand) while all others have to stand? I agree that there needs to be a
        line drawn, I don't expect Tyson Mao to come to my house and time me
        while I sit at my desk, in my chair, behind my computer, listening to my
        music. But with all silliness aside, not allowing chairs is a bit... as
        it was said before, anal. Plus, I remember a few competitors sitting
        down at the US Nationals during their solves. I thought the competition
        ran very smoothly, and I felt no need to complain about the chairs. Doug

        agree that music can be a distraction if too loud. Defining what is too
        loud is a subjective matter and puts extra responsibilities on the judge
        and might give rise to objections afterwards. I also think that nerves
        is part of the competition. When defining official rulesets I'm afraid
        one must be very strict about what is allowed and what is not. Have a
        loose set of rules will leave room for loopholes and a fairly
        non-standardized competition. -Sitting: To be allowed?- Some competitors
        might have problems standing due to injuries and such and therefor it
        might be fair to allow sitting for all contestants. I would prefer if
        standing was the standard though but contestants would be allowed to sit
        if they wish so during their registration or if physical problems arise
        during the competition /Gustav --- In

        First of all, let me say I think this discussion has grown way out of
        proportions. In any case we can never account for every single thing
        people may do to make themselves feel more comfortable, in a rulebook
        anyway. In the very end it will always be the tournament comittee that
        has the final say. All rules we can make on the issues will be very
        generalized at best, and it will always be up to a local authority at
        every tournament what conforms to the rules and what doesn't. Headphones
        running at a reasonable volume will be dwarved by spectator noise
        anyway. There's a hundred people in the room chatting, 20-30 other cubes
        spinning, people walking in and out and even the conferansiér making
        announcements here and there. And we're supposed to be complaining only
        when someone brings a teensy bit of music onto stage? Naturally, we
        can't allow participants to turn the tournament into a nightclub, but
        really, the general noise level is way too high for _reasonably_ volumed
        headphones to make any difference! A much better way of solving the
        issue rather than typing down 1000 paragraphs for every single
        distraction you can come up with would be to put down a rule saying
        "Don't distract participants on stage." This boils down to subjective
        rulings made by the local comittee, of course, but as I said before,
        that's inevitable. We're going to have the comittee making decisions as
        to what is reasonable volume, or what is reasonable distraction. Doesn't
        matter, we'll never escape that anyway. --- In

        well actually, I don't think that there should even be a two second

        I want to give my 2 cents on this issue too, because it looks like it's
        gettin an important debate. -Standing/sitting: I think both should be
        allowed, not because of feeling comfortable or anything like that, it's
        just that certain persons are too tall or too small to stand or sit.
        Lemme explain. I am 1.9m tall, that's about 6 feet 3 inches if I'm
        haven't made any mistake (why don't you just use the metric system over
        there? but that's another debate), but my arms just can't reach down to
        the table, so I have to lean forwards to reach the dots with the full
        hand. so even if I don't like sitting in competitions (it makes me feel
        nervous, I have no way to move while waiting for my cube for example to
        evacuate the pressure), if the table is tto low, I'm going to loose a
        lot of time to grab my cube, and put it down. A solution would be for me
        to stay leaned forwrd during the whole solve, but it's too bad for my
        back, and my times would still be slower. So I think, if there is one
        reason for letting someone ether sit or stand, that's because some
        people just can't reach the table, because they are too small (even if
        it's maybe a bad example, because I have never seen her in action, how
        does Wiktoria Zborowska feel about this?) or too tall, and if we give
        them the choice, everybody must have the choice. I first noticed it
        during the French Champs, where everybody had to sit, (or at least no
        one thought of standing, since we had chairs behind the tables) but the
        tables were way too low anyway. Another solution is to have adjustable
        tables, where you can have them as high/low as you wish, and in that
        case, I would say everybody stands. And, come, everybody can stand for
        10 minutes. Unless you are in a rolling chair or broke your leg. -Music:
        I'm a musician so I might not be the right example for this, because
        music is my life, so I am always listening to music. However, I am aware
        that listening to music isn't always best for one's concentration, not
        speaking of the others. It helps me, but it is not best for most people
        to listen to music while trying to get the best out of their
        concentration. Anyway, I would rather be for a rule like, no music in
        the stage area, turn off your CD players when you step on the stage. It
        helps you relax, but staying on stage for too long isn't the best way to
        relax though. So you can turn on you CD player whenever you leave the
        stage, and I would say, don't stay on stage for too long or it will kill
        your nerves anyway, w/ music or w/o music. Did you ever watch a swimming
        competition? I noticed that some of the competitors walk to their chair
        with headphones on, but once the speaker calls their name, they turn the
        music off and put the headphones down, and then fully concentrate on
        their swimming. That's kind of the thing I think is best. you can relax
        for as long as possible, but at a certain point you have to switch your
        brain to "full concentration". And, to give you an example I know well,
        as a musician I have many concerts, especially I had a recital earlier
        this year with a pianist, and I remember my old teacher came to us and
        started to tell jokes, and we were really relaxed. But suddenly he said,
        "now, you have to focus." and he gave us concentration techniques, so we
        were really concentrate when we came on stage. The only problem was that
        the piano was out of tune. Like, really. But we were focused on our
        thing, and it worked fine. So. The point is following. I would say, no
        headphones on stage, you have to try to get rid of the noise by
        yourself, and I'm not sure is relaxing is the best way of forgetting the
        noise outside. Focusing is the solution. Of course, I would love to have
        a silent room like in chess championships... don't know if it's
        possible. Just my (long) 2 cents. Ok, say it was rather 3 1/2 cents.

        nevermind, I didn't know there were 3 different heights available. It's
        fine then. So I think everybody should stand then, since there is no
        excuse other than a broken leg to sit, and feeling comfortable is not an
        argument in official competitions. François SECHET &lt;frsechet@...&gt;

        I have pretty much the same experience as you, though I'm not quite as
        tall as you are. I also have to hunch over the table and timer if I
        stand up straight. One thing I found that helps a lot in a competition
        is to change your stance. I've found that for cup stacking you have to
        be really close to the table in order to stack well, and this means that
        almost any table is too short. What I do is to spread my legs out to the
        side, so that I can still keep my torso upright and be in somewhat of an
        upright position. This works well for cubing too, since it lets you
        still be close enough to the table to put the cube back down quickly.
        Some of the people at the US competition kept asking me why I was
        standing so weird at the timer, but actually I've gotten used to it from
        cup stacking and I find it to be more comfortable than hunching over. It
        lets you still stand upright, but also be at the level of the table at
        the same time. Just my two cents, Chris --- In

        my arms just can't reach down to the table, so I have to lean forwards
        to reach the dots with the full hand. so even if I don't like sitting in
        competitions (it makes me feel nervous, I have no way to move while
        waiting for my cube for example to evacuate the pressure), if the table
        is tto low, I'm going to loose a lot of time to grab my cube, and put it
        down. A solution would be for me to stay leaned forwrd during the whole
        solve, but it's too bad for my back, and my times would still be slower

        As Eivind says: "A much better way of solving the issue rather than
        typing down 1000 paragraphs for every single distraction you can come up
        with would be to put down a rule saying "Don't distract participants on
        stage." This boils down to subjective rulings made by the local
        comittee, of course, but as I said before, that's inevitable. " Among
        other things I am an accountant and accounting regulators have found
        that specifying every little thing just leads to "smarter" ways to get
        round the rules (I think I should say "stupider" here!). Increasingly
        regulators, including the International Accounting Standards Board, are
        moving to broader statements and the overriding principle that people
        should stay within the spirit of those statements. This way you dont
        have to have huge rule books and if the general consensus is that
        someone has done something they shouldn't then you haev the flexibility
        to treat it accordingly. Actually there have been several examples of
        over-restrictive rules in the olympics where the governing bodies have
        been forced to rule against competitors or change their minds about
        rulings because of technicalities. If you don't have books full of
        technicalities then this embarassment doesn't happen. As has been said
        before - keep it simple, don't overanalyse. If competitors have an issue
        they should raise it with the organiser before they compete and both
        competitor and organiser should be as co-operative as possible in
        ensuring that people get to compete as comfortably as possible without
        getting an unfair advantage. Duncan ----- Original Message ----- From:

        all, let me say I think this discussion has grown way out of
        proportions. In any case we can never account for every single thing
        people may do to make themselves feel more comfortable, in a rulebook
        anyway. In the very end it will always be the tournament comittee that
        has the final say. All rules we can make on the issues will be very
        generalized at best, and it will always be up to a local authority at
        every tournament what conforms to the rules and what doesn't. Headphones
        running at a reasonable volume will be dwarved by spectator noise
        anyway. There's a hundred people in the room chatting, 20-30 other cubes
        spinning, people walking in and out and even the conferansiï¿½r making
        announcements here and there. And we're supposed to be complaining only
        when someone brings a teensy bit of music onto stage? Naturally, we
        can't allow participants to turn the tournament into a nightclub, but
        really, the general noise level is way too high for _reasonably_ volumed
        headphones to make any difference! A much better way of solving the
        issue rather than typing down 1000 paragraphs for every single
        distraction you can come up with would be to put down a rule saying
        "Don't distract participants on stage." This boils down to subjective
        rulings made by the local comittee, of course, but as I said before,
        that's inevitable. We're going to have the comittee making decisions as
        to what is reasonable volume, or what is reasonable distraction. Doesn't
        matter, we'll never escape that anyway. --- In

        I say, you should be allowed to anything thatll help you cube at you
        best ,as long as it isnt considered cheating(duh) if i solve better
        sitting down, then i would think i should be aloowed to site down, if
        standingup is my thing than i should be allowed to do that.if a
        certainsong i know helps me solve quicker than i should be allowed to
        listen to it. if i want none of it than i would want none. my only

        competitor complains. But then it's already too late. And some might be
        much more sensitive than the judge who defines the limit. I wouldn't
        mind but since others do I just don't think it's practical to allow it.
        Btw, at Euro2004 I think we had background music. And for 3x3 blindfold

        is necessary to make different contests and their records comparable.
        Comfort in general- You guys who want 1982 conditions please use
        brandnew non-prepared cubes not chosen by you, will ya? Cheating - I can
        imagine this: A spoken instruction how to solve the (master)magic.
        Special cases - You guys reasoning with handicapped people: There will
        always be room for reasonable special cases, e.g. wheelchair or
        Wiktoria's dad standing right next to her on stage (Euro2004). Using

        As I've said before, keep the rules as fundamental as possible. As far
        as sitting/standing is concerned, I really don't care what someone does
        - sit, stand, kneel, lay down, stand on their head for all I care. Why
        be so authoritarian? I seem to be outnumbered on these issues... but
        whatever happens I'll still compete - it's not a big deal. This whole
        debate is no big deal. I think if someone wore headphones and this
        discussion never took place, no one would give it a second thought(as
        what happened at the US champs, right?) and that's the way it should be.

        The final time is not the time it takes to solve the cube - it is the
        time it takes to remover your hands from the pads, pick up the cube,
        solve it, realize it's solved, put it back down, and return both hands
        to the pads. But of course, the judges aren't going to use video
        analysis to time every solve and they can't for some solves and not for
        others so having to stop the timer becomes part of the sport. So I think
        it is perfecty fair to hold the cuber responsible for stopping the
        timer. It just has to be understood that the time it takes to solve a
        cube and your official competition time are 2 seperate things and can't
        be fairly compared to eachother. --barefoot Chris --- In

        Yes, right, you're absolutely right! I meant layer then. I guess that
        face means right colour but not necessarily right position. I didn't use
        the word "layer" because I was thinking it is ambiguous in that the
        middle layer of a layer by layer method is quite different from the
        other two layers! However its much more accurate than face! Thanks for
        pointing out my misunderstanding. Duncan ----- Original Message -----

        I don't know much about zb and it's efficiency so I may not know what
        I'm talking about... Somebody's who's memorized all the algs may have
        better input on the feasibility. My first instinct in looking at the
        1-look LL is that it almost seems too much for a human to handle
        efficiently. Like Tyson said, more algorithms require a longer
        recognition time to say nothing about doing a U or U' to find the
        matching orientation. The only benefit would be to reduce the number of
        turns (say 8-12) and I'm not sure that would outweight the reflex of
        even a 3 look LL. The other problem is how would you practice? If you
        had 1200 algs to learn proficiently, you would have to solve so many
        cubes to be able to be able to commit them to muscle memory. Even a 2
        look can get tricky at high speeds and there's only like 50. Anyone ever
        tried to learn those and attempt a 1-look LL? -Howard --- In

        seconds say (allowing a generous 50% tolerance)? As for the other bit,
        technically you can recognize the complete LL just by looking at 3
        sides. vvv yxxxw yxxxw yxxxw zzz (e.g. you could look at x,y,z only
        (from that particular corner so no need to rotate the cube) and that
        would be sufficient to deduce v,w. It doesn't matter which of the 4
        corners you choose to base from. With commitment I can't see why that
        couldn't be done for a recognition similar to OLL. After all, if there's
        someone who can memorize pi to 42,000 places then why not this? Of
        course, there's always the question of whether one should waste all the
        time to do so and in this respect it is much more difficult to
        justifiably say yes.

        Hi all, There are a couple of things I would like to add: * First: A lot
        of those 1211 algorithms have mirrors and inverses that you also need to
        recognize and learn an algorithm for. There are 3915 _cases_ you would
        have to learn if you want to learn the last layer in one. That makes the
        ZB system so ingenious, because flipping the LL edges before you get to
        the LL means you only need to learn 493 last layer cases. That's a
        reduction by a factor of 8. By making the final F2L pair a bit more
        complicated (305 cases instead of 41 cases), you make the LL a lot
        easier. It's a perfect example of how to "spread the work" over the
        various steps of your solution. It makes learning a complete
        last-layer-in-one completely unnecessary. * Second (regarding Tyson's
        remark on recognition): Recognizing ALL 3915 cases wouldn't be that more
        difficult than recognizing the 493 ZB last layer cases. The only
        difference is that the edges can also be flipped in 8 ways with
        last-layer-in-one, but that doesn't make the recognition task a lot more
        complicated. You can still see the same thing as with the ZB-last-layer.
        In fact, if the UL or the UB edge is flipped incorrectly, you can
        actually see more than when they are flipped correctly. So if you master
        the ZB recognition system, recognizing all possible last layer cases
        isn't a problem. I'm now practicing the COLL and ZB recognition systems
        a lot, and I can tell you it's very feasible. Cheers, LarsV --- In

        As regards the first point: Suppose you put in a first layer corner with
        the the cross. Then you only need 8 algorithms to to flip the LL edges
        while putting in the last middle edge (and they average at 7-8 moves).

        You're right! There are a lot of "smart" ways to flip the edges during
        the first two layers. Dan Harris and I came up with the VH system that
        does a similar thing: http://lars.studentenweb.org/cube/vh/ When solving
        the last pair you just prepare the final corner and edge so that you get
        to one of the 2 trivial cases (this takes 3-4 moves) and then you learn
        algorithms that flip the edges from that point (8 for each case). Since
        about 95% of the cases can be solved that way, that's also a good way of
        flipping the edges without learning all 305 cases yet. However, none of
        these methods will be as good as the full ZB system. I've been working
        out a lot of "smart" ways of flipping the edges and all of them require
        at least 3 extra moves or a lot of thinking that makes them slower,
        whereas with ZB the move count is virtually the same for the first two
        layers. Cheers, LarsV --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        someone with headphones comes in and that first solver is disturbed -
        how do you handle that, is the first solver allowed a do over due to the

        a place for comfort - if it were then we could all meet at someones
        house or outside. You are put on stage in the spotlight to see how you
        can do under pressure. To see how you can solve with a stackmat with
        tons of people watching you. I know most of us can say we solve
        differently with a stackmat than a stopwatch, or with people we don't
        know vs people we know around - but a competition is supposed to the the
        same for all competitors. Just like the olympics - they are all expected
        to use the same horse or rings, perform the same amount of skills in a
        set amount of time, and stick their landings. They don't get special
        rings or longer times - basically they are pretty much uniform. Just my
        two cents :) Crispy _______________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Win 1

        for the solve picked it up and moved it towards the back of the mat with
        their hand covering it, the competitor asked for them to move it back
        and instead of just picking it up and moving it, they rolled it back in
        place so the cube was no longer how the competitor set it down. Do you
        stop and ask them to replace it, do you continue and hope for the best?
        Are you expected to tell every judge to please not touch your cube after
        an inspect (which I think is ridiculous)? What should one do in that
        situation? -Crispy _______________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Win 1

        I dunno if anyone was watching the Olympics the other day but NBC showed
        a little thing about women's softball. The american players trained by
        writing red or black numbers on tennis balls and getting them thrown at
        them at 150 miles per hour while trying to read the numbers and colors
        on the balls. They thought it was impossible at first, but after the
        training, they ended up seeing everything up to the stitches on the
        softballs during the matches at Athens. Maybe this idea can be applied
        to speed cubing, therefore increasing your hand-eye coordination and
        getting faster times. Get "cube high" without any "cube dust"! Just a
        thought. Prabhat

        Hi all, for the headphones, I don't see the problem, if a competitor
        wants to hear music. If he doesn't hear the judge,no chance, he gets a
        penalty. He does what he wants ^^ He knows that if he does something
        wrong because of the music, he can get a penalty. (Between, I'm happy to
        have seen you in amsterdam, but sad that I speak english so bad ! I sure
        look like a closed guy, but I'm closed because of the language ^^ I'd
        like to speak with you etc. but it's hard ... Maybe next time I hope )
        Regards,Thomas I have read a lot of the debate between sitting/standing,
        music/nomusic and those are all competitor issues - but what about the
        thing the competition heads can control - judges. I know that most
        judges are volunteers (which was great) and they had a small meeting -
        but is it enough? EXAMPLE: A competitor does the 15 sec inspect and set
        the cube down how they like it, a little more towards the right hand -
        the judge for the solve picked it up and moved it towards the back of
        the mat with their hand covering it, the competitor asked for them to

        Where did you find this. I need reliable source. Because : 150 mph =
        0.041666 miles second. Now in 1 second, the eye sees 30 images. thats
        67.056 meters per second. So every image the eye would see is distanced
        by 2 meters. Now lets see at what distance someone can read numbers
        written on tennis balls. I'm going to say 3 meters. The human line of
        sight is unknown to me, I'm going to give 160 degree. That means your
        sight range is : 17 meters. In your eye sight, the ball appears 8.5
        times in front of your eye. In a space of between a third and a quarter
        of a second. Now, I'm not even going to take the chance to say that you
        need to focus to read (which means seen with depth acuity = 2 eyes)
        which would diminish the range. The letters have to face you (a ball
        must be rotating on itself). Now I'm not saying that doing this a few
        times over a immense ammount of trial is impossible. I'm just saying
        that I highly doubt someone can do it consistantly given the facts. ---

        A lot of you remind me of republicans. Saying one thing, and doing
        another. Hypocrits, to say the least. We must be strict. We must be
        uniform. No music, no sitting, no singing. This will make things easier.
        Right...sure... While at the same time, most of you have no issue
        whatsoever against the way we are addressing the 2 second penalty.
        Uniformity...as in, everyone should solve their cubes? I would
        appreciate this. This would be trult uniform, especially among people
        who are competing just to do that, completely solve their cubes. We'll
        talk strict but just see how much we can let slide in the most important
        aspect of the race. You can completely miss your last turn, to any
        extent(!) and still only recieve a 2 second penalty. But alas, we are
        not worried about this minor detail. What is more important is how we
        appear on stage. Let's make sure we look professional. That's fine, or
        better yet, lets fight with every last drop of energy over whether
        headphones should be allowed at a whisper, while the noise level of the
        crowd will never be controlled. Let us argue about standing also. It is
        a real shame that something in which the posture of the person is not
        relevant, would hold so much bearing. And what message is that sending
        to people who have no choice to sit down? YOU ARE NOT BEING
        PROFESSIONAL, YOU'RE APPEARANCE WOULD BE NEARLY UNACCEPTABLE IF IT
        WEREN'T FOR YOUR CONDITION. I propose in the meantime that all
        competitors wear neutral gray colors, cover up all tatoos, at not talk
        on stage. I feel this way, I would be less distracted by my

        Alrighty folks. JNetCube is just about finished. The network version is
        now fully functional. All I have left to add is handicap support. There
        have been many changes to both the GUI and functionality of the timer.
        Instead of me listing changes here you can just download the timer and
        try it for yourself. On the standalone timer, I have added the ability
        to view what the scrambled cube should look like after applying the
        current scramble alg (currently only works for 3x3x3) and some other
        little changes. This can be shown in a seperate little window (in the
        tools menu). Planned updates/changes include: --&gt; Allow customized
        output for network timer --&gt; Allow setting of the colors on the
        'scramble view' --&gt; Show scramble view for all other cubes I would
        recommend that anyone currently using NetCube switch to JNetCube
        now...JNetCube's network timer is much more reliable than NetCube. You
        can download in the files section of this group. "JNetCube.jar"

        officials turned to Conditioned Ocular Enhancement training, invented by
        ... said an air cannon flings a red or black ... I tried clicking on it
        but it took me to some place different. Anyone interested can look for
        more on it and how it can be used to get faster cubers. I don't think
        you can turn a face of the cube at 150 kph while going at 3 moves per
        second, so it should be possible. Key words: softball, training, red,
        black, numbers, Conditioned Ocular Enhancement, or any other words from
        the search result above. I like Tyson's idea about the PLL at 150 mph :)
        I should get an air cannon soon. Maybe I can use it to learn the LL algs

        Hey Lars, what are your thoughts about this variant: After three pairs,
        first orient all five remaining edges (so that U and R turns can solve
        them), then build/insert the last pair. That way you can also always do
        the last pair with a two-generator. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        &gt; &gt; http://lars.studentenweb.org/cube/vh/ &gt; &gt; When solving
        the last pair you just prepare the final corner and edge &gt; so that
        you get to one of the 2 trivial cases (this takes 3-4 moves) &gt; and
        then you learn algorithms that flip the edges from that point (8 &gt;
        for each case). Since about 95% of the cases can be solved that way,
        &gt; that's also a good way of flipping the edges without learning all
        305 &gt; cases yet. &gt; &gt; However, none of these methods will be as
        good as the full ZB system. &gt; I've been working out a lot of "smart"
        ways of flipping the edges and &gt; all of them require at least 3 extra
        moves or a lot of thinking that &gt; makes them slower, whereas with ZB
        the move count is virtually the &gt; same for the first two layers. &gt;

        human limits &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are a couple of things I would like
        to add: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * First: A lot of those 1211
        algorithms have mirrors and inverses &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; you also
        need to recognize and learn an algorithm for. There are &gt; 3915 &gt;
        &gt; &gt; _cases_ you would have to learn if you want to learn the last
        &gt; layer in &gt; &gt; &gt; one. That makes the ZB system so ingenious,
        because flipping the &gt; LL &gt; &gt; &gt; edges before you get to the
        LL means you only need to learn 493 &gt; last &gt; &gt; &gt; layer
        cases. That's a reduction by a factor of 8. By making the &gt; final
        &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L pair a bit more complicated (305 cases instead of 41
        cases), &gt; you &gt; &gt; &gt; make the LL a lot easier. It's a perfect
        example of how to "spread &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; work" over the various
        steps of your solution. It makes learning a &gt; &gt; &gt; complete
        last-layer-in-one completely unnecessary. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        * Second (regarding Tyson's remark on recognition): Recognizing &gt; ALL
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 3915 cases wouldn't be that more difficult than
        recognizing the &gt; 493 ZB &gt; &gt; &gt; last layer cases. The only
        difference is that the edges can also &gt; be &gt; &gt; &gt; flipped in
        8 ways with last-layer-in-one, but that doesn't make &gt; the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; recognition task a lot more complicated. You can still see the &gt;
        same &gt; &gt; &gt; thing as with the ZB-last-layer. In fact, if the UL
        or the UB edge &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; flipped incorrectly, you can
        actually see more than when they are &gt; &gt; &gt; flipped correctly.
        So if you master the ZB recognition system, &gt; &gt; &gt; recognizing
        all possible last layer cases isn't a problem. I'm now &gt; &gt; &gt;
        practicing the COLL and ZB recognition systems a lot, and I can &gt;
        tell &gt; &gt; &gt; you it's very feasible. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        "Ok cunt"? Let's try to keep our posts constructive, or at least halfway
        literate. If you disagree with something posted here, then posting your
        reasons for disagreeing is much better than lashing out with profanity.
        Sending a reply to previous comment (you could've at least pointed out
        the comment...) with "Ok cunt" in the subject line is not only a waste
        of keystrokes, it's a waste of bandwith, and all in all, a waste of
        everyone else's time. I am assuming that said remark was in response to
        one of the "headphone" emails. As it has been stated MANY times before,
        the arena IS too loud for them to have much of an effect. However, if
        someone wants to take headphones with them to use while cubing, then
        they can obviously hear whatever is being played on their walkman/cd
        player/whatever. This is in a very, very loud environment, as stated
        before. I know for a fact that if I turn my portable DiscMan up to 100%
        volume, it hurts the hell out of my ears. I can't stand it that loud. By
        the same token, I have a lot of trouble believing that the same volume
        headphones would be audible to someone standing 3 feet away in the
        middle of a lot of very, very loud people. "Yea, but it can't be that
        much of a difference?" Probably not. But who knows? No one person can
        tell how _everybody_ reacts to music while cubing. Many of my best
        records when I was in the 35-40s range were taken while listening to
        fast, hard rock. In the first round of the July 10 competition, the
        difference between my best time and the person right below me's best
        time was less than a second. In fact, way less than a second. 3/100 of a
        second, to be exact. The top 24 went to the next round, and I was #6
        then. But what if I was 24th? If the person that placed 25th didn't make
        the cut by .03s, and a little bit of music would have gotten him to cube
        closer to his fullest capacity, then more power to him! I would have
        lost to a better cubist, fair and square. I would not have been
        ecstatic, but fair is fair. I would hope to have the same opportunity
        extended to me, whether music actually helps me or not. Doug Reed Thomas

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are a
        couple of things I would like to add: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * First: A lot
        of those 1211 algorithms have mirrors and inverses that &gt; &gt; you
        also need to recognize and learn an algorithm for. There are 3915 &gt;
        &gt; _cases_ you would have to learn if you want to learn the last layer
        in &gt; &gt; one. That makes the ZB system so ingenious, because
        flipping the LL &gt; &gt; edges before you get to the LL means you only
        need to learn 493 last &gt; &gt; layer cases. That's a reduction by a
        factor of 8. By making the final &gt; &gt; F2L pair a bit more
        complicated (305 cases instead of 41 cases), you &gt; &gt; make the LL a
        lot easier. It's a perfect example of how to "spread the &gt; &gt; work"
        over the various steps of your solution. It makes learning a &gt; &gt;
        complete last-layer-in-one completely unnecessary. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *
        Second (regarding Tyson's remark on recognition): Recognizing ALL &gt;
        &gt; 3915 cases wouldn't be that more difficult than recognizing the 493
        ZB &gt; &gt; last layer cases. The only difference is that the edges can
        also be &gt; &gt; flipped in 8 ways with last-layer-in-one, but that
        doesn't make the &gt; &gt; recognition task a lot more complicated. You
        can still see the same &gt; &gt; thing as with the ZB-last-layer. In
        fact, if the UL or the UB edge is &gt; &gt; flipped incorrectly, you can
        actually see more than when they are &gt; &gt; flipped correctly. So if
        you master the ZB recognition system, &gt; &gt; recognizing all possible
        last layer cases isn't a problem. I'm now &gt; &gt; practicing the COLL
        and ZB recognition systems a lot, and I can tell &gt; &gt; you it's very
        feasible. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers, &gt; &gt; LarsV &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hey Doug, I just got an Alexander's Star on Ebay, and I'm sorry to say
        that as far as I can figure out, unless there is already one piece out,
        it can't be taken apart without breaking the first piece. The one I got
        already had one broken piece, so it was lucky I was planning on lubing
        it. I repaired the piece by placing a small thin piece of plastic cut to
        the right size over the break like a splint, and gluing with Krazy glue.
        This is a delicate operation to say the least, as the broken section
        must be held in the proper position for at least a minute. To replace
        the final piece when re-assembling, one must push the two rotating
        pyramids apart with considerable force while sliding the final piece
        gently in place. This also is certainly no picnic, and I broke and then
        had to repair a couple more pieces while trying to do it. If you do
        break a piece, I would suggest taking out several pieces, putting in the
        repaired one first, and saving a good piece for the final one. Also,
        several pieces broke while the star was fully assembled, during turning.
        Either I got a star with some defective pieces, or more likely, several
        of them merely had stress fractures from previous jamming. This is
        highly possible if the star was played with much by someone else before
        I lubed it, because the interior pieces on my star that kept breaking
        are just too thin to begin with. Sadly, nothing can be done about this.
        On the plus side, now that I have (hopefully) fixed all the weak pieces
        and the star is fully lubed, it is about 10 times easier to turn than
        when I got it, and I can make turns at a decent speed now. Hope this
        helps! -Ben B. --- d_funny007 &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:

        I don't even know what an Alexander Star is, but I can't help thinking
        that it has to have been assembled at the factory in some less
        destructive way than described here. Once you figure out what that way
        is/was, you can probably take it apart by reversing that last step. That
        it unless the final step is something irreversible like gluing etc. But
        that just seems like a bad manufacturing process, so I doubt they'd do
        it that way. /Lars At 8:22 PM -0700 8/23/04, keggerius wrote: &gt;Hey

        I have never taken my Alexander's Stars apart, but I have lubed them
        just by spraying some silicone through the gaps inbetween the pieces.

        be that the rotating caps were put on with some kind of snap lock

        First: A lot of those 1211 algorithms have mirrors and inverses that
        &gt; you also need to recognize and learn an algorithm for. There are
        3915 &gt; _cases_ you would have to learn if you want to learn the last
        layer in &gt; one. I don't see why it is necessary to learn a separate
        algorithm for each mirror case. Mirror recognition seems pretty easy...
        Here, it's the sensible thing to do because it would save you learning
        1862 duplicate algorithms. &gt; That makes the ZB system so ingenious,
        because flipping the LL &gt; edges before you get to the LL means you
        only need to learn 493 last &gt; layer cases. That's a reduction by a
        factor of 8. By making the final &gt; F2L pair a bit more complicated
        (305 cases instead of 41 cases), you &gt; make the LL a lot easier. It's
        a perfect example of how to "spread the &gt; work" over the various
        steps of your solution. It makes learning a &gt; complete
        last-layer-in-one completely unnecessary. Surely, one day ZB will seem
        too limiting and people will be looking for something better :-) Not
        that last F2L pair + LL is that good. There are better ways than that.

        Hi all, Yesterday I made a post that was quite immature. I want everyone
        to know I'm sorry about how I went about expressing my feelings there.
        And among other things the Republican comment was just unneccesary. I
        still have a lot of growing up to do, but I hope everyone can forgive me
        for this. -Richard

      <div class="email-content">
        Hi all, as far as I know there were no serious attempts to solve 4x4x4
        using computer. I needed to find some sequences to solve specific
        configurations of 4x4x4, so I modified my ACube program and created a
        new program for 4x4x4. Warning: The following text is quite hard to
        read. However, I use only one phase (to search for optimal sequences)
        and I am lucky, that the required sequences were at most 12 turns long,
        so I found them. The depth 12 seems to be the ultimate limit on the
        current computers... Thus, the program is not aimed at solving arbitrary
        configuration, it should help finding short optimal sequences to be used
        in methods... So I have a question and discussion topic for people
        interested in computer cube algorithms: What cube parts can you suggest
        to store the entire cube state (I mean, for 3x3x3 you need e.g. corner
        perm., corner ori., edge ori, and three additional numbers storing edge
        perm.) What pruning tables would you use for 4x4x4? In the current state
        I use the following: to store the cube state I use numbers storing the
        following cube sub-configurations: - 1x corner permutation (7! states) -
        1x corner orientation (3^6 states) - 6x center positions (6x 23*22*21
        states) - 12x edge pair positions (12x 24*23 states) (one corner is
        fixed in its position, so the first two numbers are lower than for
        3x3x3) (packing 2 edge pairs together requires too much space for
        transformation tables.) The pruning tables are rather simple and need to
        be improved but I have no idea how (ANY IDEA?). - corner perm. x corner
        ori. - 6x center pos. x corner ori. - 6x edge pair pos. x opposite edge
        pair pos. The maximum pruming depth is 11 and it is too low number to be
        usable. the supported turns are all simple and slice turns imaginable
        and is 54 in total, so it gives quite a large branching ratio. To reduce
        the ammount of equal paths (L R ~ R L ~ L2 L' R...) I have used
        automatically generated finite automaton that consists of a big table
        storing states and transitions on a given turn. This seems to be really
        efficient and Im considering to use it in the clasic ACube too... I
        hope, somebody understood the mess before. Josef PS: I used the program
        to optimize sequences in the 4x4x4 method described by Marc Waterman in
        CFF 16 (?). and I have found several significant improvements...

        There's a relatively easy solution to the headphone issue - provide a

        the cube in the middle layer... and the other instance i get confused is
        when the edge is already in the middle layer, but in the wrong corner.
        do you just move it back to the top and fix the cross? and finally, how
        do you guys memorize the algorithms? just have a sheet printed out and

        You can utilize the corner. The basic idea to all F2L algorithms it that
        first part uses the corner where the piece belongs to set up the two
        pieces and then the last part brings them together and put them in. If
        your edge piece is in a wrong slot, then there's nothing wrong with
        using that slot to set up your pieces. Line up your corner with the edge
        like how you would normally do. Then do your algorithm for all but the
        last 3 moves. Let me know if you see what I mean. As for memorizing
        algorithms, just do them over and over again. There's no other way.

        I normally suggest that instead of learning all of the many F2L algs
        from the start, try to figure them out for yourself. I think in the end
        that is a better route to take, since you'll get a better understanding
        of the cube and your reaction time will be almost zero, since all the
        cases will be sort of your "first instinct" anyway. By doing the F2L
        with almost nothing but intuitive algs (I admit, I did memorize 3 or 4
        that I didn't come up with) you can probably average about 7 moves per
        F2L pair, and average under 12s per F2L alltogether. I can average about
        13-14s per F2L last time I checked, using this method, and I didn't have
        to force myself to memorize all 40+ cases. Once you get this down, then

        table entries w.r.t. depth. Of course, you could always extend the
        tables a bit: e.g., for those not involving corner positions, &gt; - 6x
        center pos. x corner ori. &gt; - 6x edge pair pos. x opposite edge pair
        pos. you could include also the position of one one of the mobile
        corners, though this would be a bit artificial and unsymmetrical. (If
        you had enough memory you could add similar tables based on each of the
        possible corners, and so restore the "symmetry".) But I wouldn't expect
        increasing table sizes by small factors in that way to increase the
        pruning depth by very much. Sorry, this isn't being terribly helpful --
        I guess you'll have had similar thoughts anyway. Mike

        human limits &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are a couple of things I would like
        to add: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * First: A lot of those 1211
        algorithms have mirrors and &gt; inverses that &gt; &gt; &gt; you also
        need to recognize and learn an algorithm for. There are &gt; 3915 &gt;
        &gt; &gt; _cases_ you would have to learn if you want to learn the last
        &gt; layer in &gt; &gt; &gt; one. That makes the ZB system so ingenious,
        because flipping the &gt; LL &gt; &gt; &gt; edges before you get to the
        LL means you only need to learn 493 &gt; last &gt; &gt; &gt; layer
        cases. That's a reduction by a factor of 8. By making the &gt; final
        &gt; &gt; &gt; F2L pair a bit more complicated (305 cases instead of 41
        cases), &gt; you &gt; &gt; &gt; make the LL a lot easier. It's a perfect
        example of how &gt; to "spread the &gt; &gt; &gt; work" over the various
        steps of your solution. It makes learning &gt; a &gt; &gt; &gt; complete
        last-layer-in-one completely unnecessary. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        * Second (regarding Tyson's remark on recognition): Recognizing &gt; ALL
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 3915 cases wouldn't be that more difficult than
        recognizing the &gt; 493 ZB &gt; &gt; &gt; last layer cases. The only
        difference is that the edges can also &gt; be &gt; &gt; &gt; flipped in
        8 ways with last-layer-in-one, but that doesn't make &gt; the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; recognition task a lot more complicated. You can still see the &gt;
        same &gt; &gt; &gt; thing as with the ZB-last-layer. In fact, if the UL
        or the UB &gt; edge is &gt; &gt; &gt; flipped incorrectly, you can
        actually see more than when they are &gt; &gt; &gt; flipped correctly.
        So if you master the ZB recognition system, &gt; &gt; &gt; recognizing
        all possible last layer cases isn't a problem. I'm &gt; now &gt; &gt;
        &gt; practicing the COLL and ZB recognition systems a lot, and I can
        &gt; tell &gt; &gt; &gt; you it's very feasible. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I am in almost the same boat as you yodude, I just started learning the
        f2l alg recently, but instead of trying to learn them all I targeted
        certain ones.... Doing it mostly intuitively is the way to go in my
        opinion, but I couldn't just do that. I decided to look at a few of
        them, the ones where the corner is properly placed already, but not
        oriented properly, and those are the ones I learned. And by really
        watching how these work, you can adapt them to cover many situations
        until you really know more than you think. A great resource for learning
        how to do the f2l, and how to manipulate the cube is Dan Harris' site.
        cubestation.co.uk He has java cubes there so you can watch how the algs
        work, this really helped me a lot. About 3 weeks ago I was solving in
        70-75 seconds average (doing layer by layer) now I am down to 45-50
        seconds for an average, and my F2L is in the 30-35 second range, 25 when
        I can recognize really well. Hope this help... PS I just popped my 2x2x2

        &gt;Doing it mostly intuitively is the way to go in my opinion, but I
        couldn't &gt;just do that. I decided to look at a few of them, the ones
        where the corner &gt;is properly placed already, but not oriented
        properly, and those are the &gt;ones I learned. &gt;And by really
        watching how these work, you can adapt them to cover many &gt;situations

        F2L question I normally suggest that instead of learning all of the many
        F2L algs from the start, try to figure them out for yourself. I think in
        the end that is a better route to take, since you'll get a better
        understanding of the cube and your reaction time will be almost zero,
        since all the cases will be sort of your "first instinct" anyway. By
        doing the F2L with almost nothing but intuitive algs (I admit, I did
        memorize 3 or 4 that I didn't come up with) you can probably average
        about 7 moves per F2L pair, and average under 12s per F2L alltogether. I
        can average about 13-14s per F2L last time I checked, using this method,
        and I didn't have to force myself to memorize all 40+ cases. Once you
        get this down, then you might be able to squeeze a few more seconds out
        of it by learning optimized algorithms. Doug yodude565 wrote: &gt;hey

        Hey I'll try not to repeat what ohters have already told you. When I
        started memorizing algoritms, I memorized them as symbol sequences. I
        praticed them without looking at the cube. That's why I did not see the
        logic behind the moves. It's very important that you look at the two
        pieces you are solving (when memorizing, I mean. Once you know all F2L
        cases, you have to look for other pieces while solving a F2L-pair). If
        you look at the pieces, you will see that most first two layer cases
        will end up (after 3 or 4 moves) being only 2 patterns (that both have
        mirrors). If you know how to solve those 2 patterns, you only have to
        memorize how to create that pattern. You can try this website:
        cubestation.co.uk. The first two layers are illustrated with applets...
        Maybe you can try to do the setup moves, watch the applet solving the
        corner-edge pair, and then try to do that yourself. Memorizing more
        complicated (last layer) algoritms, is a little harder, because it's not
        possible to understand where all the pieces are going (in most cases).
        For those algorithms, I memorize them as sequences of 'triggers'. For
        example: RU'R'U is one move for me, like Dan Knights says on his section
        about finger tricks.
        (http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#hints). If
        you have more questions, just ask... Or mail me if you like:

        Hi Stefan, That's another very nice way of doing it. You need to know
        only 5 cases with an average of 7 moves: L F' R' F2 R F L' (7) flips UF
        and UR R U' R' L F R' F' R L'(9) flips UL and UR R2 D R' U R L' B' L D'
        R2 (10) flips UF, UL, UB and UR L F' L' U2 L F L' (7) flips FR, UF, UB
        and UR F' U F U2 F' U' F (7) flips FR and UB It makes the final pair
        very fast! Of course, one could also just solve the F2L and do the
        shortest OLL algorithm that flips the edges (average: 5.875 moves) but
        that wouldn't make the last pair as easy as with this method. This could
        be the way to do it until I know more. Thanks, LarsV --- In

        I think the best way to learn the algs is to make a practice sheet
        containing the inverse of the desired algs. When you execute the
        inverse, you will be faced with the situation you want to solve. AFter
        you learn one, you can highlight it and go to the next one. To do the
        inverse of the alg, read it right to left and also the face move should
        be in the opposite direction. R=R', F=F'. Good luck Wayne --- In

        what you were saying to use the incorrect one and just not do the last
        steps..sounds good! as making an inverse sheet, that sounds like a good

        them without thinking about it.. another thing i was wondering, what do
        you guys think is a reasonable time frame for learning and being able to
        do the F2L in say around 30 seconds.. how long did it take you guys?

        solving. If the act of telling the judge something is enough to throw
        off your concentration, you probably weren't mentally tough enough to
        not crack under pressure anyway. Things aren't going to be perfect all
        the time. Look at the gymanstics in the olympics right now. Tyson Mao

        degree - but the point of where the middle of the middle cube top layer

        Per's algorithm can also be modified into R2F2R2-F2s-R2F2L2 (affects U
        and D faces instead of F and B). Which one you like better is just
        personal preference. If you want something a little longer but simpler,
        try (F2R2-B2L2)^3 or (F2R2)^3-(B2L2)^3. For a completely different
        approach (my favorite), try UD-M2-U'D-M2D2. To switch stickers on
        adjacent sides of the 3x3x3 is a trickier proposition. I will give two
        methods, one requiring 14 stickers to be peeled, and another requiring
        only 10, but with a little disassembly/reassembly involved. Both methods
        start thus: 1. Choose the two sides you want to switch (example: to
        switch from the original color scheme to the new, switch green and
        white) and make them the U and F faces. 2. Perform this algorithm: U2 R
        F2 U2 F2 R2 U2 F2 U2 R U2 At this point, you can just remove the 7
        remaining stickers from the U and F faces and switch them. Preferable,
        however, is to move some of the pieces manually. 3. Remove the UF edge,
        and switch the UFR and UFL corners, orienting them so that UFR's R
        facelet becomes UFL's L facelet, and vice versa. Now flip the UF edge
        over and replace it. To explain more visually, just picture removing the
        entire 3-piece row on the UF edge as a whole, flipping it over, and
        replacing it. This involves the edge flip parity and the permutation
        parity, which can both be done with the normal moves on the 4x4x4, but
        not on the 3x3x3. 4. Now there are only 4 stickers each on the U and F
        faces to switch, and the 2 opposite stickers on the UFR and UFL corners
        must also be switched. Have fun! -Ben B. --- Per Kristen Fredlund

        comfort. Crowds are part &gt; of &gt; any competition - if people can't
        compete with a &gt; crowd &gt; learn to deal or don't compete. I don't
        really care about the crowds. I am only fighting for letting people have
        headphones. &gt; &gt;Let us argue about standing also... And what &gt;
        &gt;message &gt; is that sending to people who have no choice &gt;to sit
        &gt; down? &gt; &gt; Obviously there are circumstances for certain &gt;
        people &gt; - no one would argue that - but again for those who &gt;
        have the choice - standing vs sitting is a comfort &gt; thing. Indeed.
        That's not what is being put into question. What's being put into
        question is whether or not we should disregard comfort entirely for the
        sake of professionalism. If we are going to be so strict lets take a
        better look at the guidelines for the 2 second penalty which I mentioned
        earlier. You guys can't fight for a strict enivronment and let a half
        turn go with 2 second penalty. You can't have your cake and eat it too.
        but whatever...hindsight is 20/20. -richard &gt; ===== &gt; Philia, &gt;

        printed on each applet, and you can turn the sides of the cube with your

        I have used this method for a few years now, though I have always done
        this edge orienting step intuitively - Use R+U to put a flipped edge at
        FR if there isn't one already. Then use F+U to replace it with another
        flipped one. I never flip the FR edge last if I can avoid it, so that it
        will end up on the top layer. Also during the last flip, bad cases for
        the corner edge pair can often be avoided by turning the U face before
        you put the last flipped edge at FR. Sometimes you get to a position
        where the last corner/edge pair is paired up in the top layer but
        flipped. In that case put the other flipped edge at FR without breaking
        them up (using R+U), and use F+U to insert the pair. Also, the 4 flip
        case can be avoided if the FR piece is in the top layer, just by
        redefining the flip, doing everything in mirror image. I never looked
        for shorter sequences (I'm not really a speedcuber at 40+ seconds
        average), but I will definitely try to use these now, as mostly they are
        a lot better. --- In "Lars Vandenbergh" &lt;lars.vandenbergh@s...&gt;

        I don't really know about my F2L times, but I got under 40 seconds two
        months after I started cubing, and I think my last layer took longer
        than 10 seconds (I had a 4 look last layer there). I guess learning to
        do F2L in 30 seconds will take you less then two months. It also depends
        on your motivation, and how much time you are willing to spend cubing,
        offcourse. There is another site you could take a good look at, by the
        way. Remember I told you in my first post I memorize algoritms are

        Hi, I use solving the first layer as the first step of Waterman's method
        and from my experience there are two comparable efficient methods to
        solve the first face: - variation to Lars's or Gilles's method (block
        1x2x3 + 2 corners + 1 edge) - 4 corners + 4 edges If you have enough
        time, you can use intuition and search for possibilities thoroughly and
        combine these two methods... then number of necessary moves can vary
        from 10 to 15 (my experience). However, to solve the first face fast,
        you cannot think too much and average number of moves is 15-18 (again,
        just my experience). Using the second method, the moves include slice
        ones(!). (this way to solve the first face is quite complete on
        http://rubikscube.info ) I am not sure about other methods for first
        face, but e.g. for working corner F2L, the efficient method is 2x2x1
        block + 2 CE pairs (of the first face) (or 3x2x1 block + 1 CE pair). It
        seems that without the last corner you can save surprisingly many
        turns... Another thing that is worth a note is, that in e.g. ZB method
        solving the F2L without one CE pair should take about 18 moves, which is
        incredibly good comparing to the number of moves for the first layer (it
        is first layer -1 corner +3 edges..). Josef

        (that's probably what Jaap meant with mirroring). Argh, now I'm getting
        confused. It works if you take a solved cube, apply your five moves and
        then my four+y. Then all are oriented. It doesn't work if I just flip
        the four edges and apply my moves. But neither does yours. So, the rule
        is: they work iff the edge that belongs into FR stays in the U layer.
        &gt; F' U F (3) flips FR and UL I think I'd prefer executing this as y

        Hi Josef, very nice to see someone finally attempting this :-) &gt; What
        cube parts can you suggest to store the &gt; entire cube state (I mean,
        for 3x3x3 you need &gt; e.g. corner perm., corner ori., edge ori, and
        &gt; three additional numbers storing edge perm.) Three additional
        numbers? I don't understand... &gt; - 6x center positions (6x 23*22*21
        states) It might be better to store the inverse of this, i.e. what color
        is at each position, not the positions of each color. May save some
        space. Also, why 23*22*21 and not 24*23*22*21? I do understand the
        smaller numbers for the corners but this here surprises me. &gt; PS: I
        used the program to optimize sequences in &gt; the 4x4x4 method
        described by Marc Waterman &gt; in CFF 16 (?). and I have found several
        significant &gt; improvements... Can we see those algs? Maybe they're
        useful for other methods as well? Also, did you try solving the two
        "parity problems" for people who first convert into a 3x3? For that I
        also had the idea of using a "2-generator"-like alg, i.e. only allowing
        turns of RrUu and maybe ld. This would reduce the branching factor a
        lot. Cheers! Stefan

        This is only for people who come up to the Caltech Cube Competition: Hey
        Everyone, I need to know how many Rubik's Cube Tiles you guys need.
        Email me or IM me if you want any, they will be a dollar each (I
        recommend 2 knock-offs to one real cube if you're using the tiles), AIM:

        &gt; How are you? If you send me the source again I'll make an effort to
        port it &gt; to JDK 1.3. Howdy Michiel! I belive that the timer should
        work with JDK 1.3. The only problem last time was using the CAPS COLOR
        constants rather than lowercase. I just went in (a few seconds ago) and
        changed them all to lowercase. (unless there were some other
        compatibility problems I'm unaware of). &gt; I haven't cubed in a while
        now (as shows my log) since I am working all the &gt; time, and I
        thought I needed a break. I have started as a web/java &gt; developer so
        I will need to do a lot of Java. For now it's PHP. I have been doing
        just the opposite! I've been cubing like crazy becuase I have to go back
        to school in four days!! I just got a new pb average of 23.89 seconds
        yesterday and took 4 averages this morning, which were all sub-25, yea!
        This is the one I just took about 3 minutes ago: Average: 24.39 seconds
        Individual Times: 22.02, 22.79, 24.80, (32.33), 22.12, 26.57, 24.18,
        28.66, 21.60, 26.97, 24.21, (20.87) My times are really scattered now

        Hey guys, dudes, friends, etc., Hm. I've been working on some (some
        meaning a few =D) tricks in pairing in the last f2l pair, (especially
        orienting the last layer when edges are already oriented and depending
        on the orientation of the 3/4 corners. btw, with special and easy cases
        to recognize, i have found efficient ones!!), and I'm wondering, has
        anyone looked into solving the last layer -_WHILE_- placing in the last
        f2l pair?? [i assume this would just be jumbling the last f2l pair back
        and forth using the empty slot with moves, and is possible i think] Once
        the edges are already oriented, there are probably the same number of
        cases as zibrowoski-bruchem (zb) last layer (putting in account for
        flipping corners/permuting corners/permuting edges), but I'm just
        curious about this. peace yo. -bm :) --Brent

        Ok, here is the best I have come up with so far for the 5x5x5 adjacent
        swap: U F U2u2 r F2f2 U2u2 F2f2 r2 U2u2 F2f2 U2u2 r F2f2 U2u2 F2f2 U2u2

        l' B2 r2 This leaves only 18 stickers to be moved, which I believe is as
        good as you can do without any disassembly. With disassembly, it could
        be reduced to 14 in the same way as my 3x3x3 method, or to 12 if you
        also switched the center caps as Stefan suggested. However, disassembly
        is less practical on the 5x5x5, and as you said, you don't feel like
        doing it. Also, I realize the algorithm is pretty long, but that's
        because I made most of it up in my head, and by just trying stuff out on
        the cube. It works, and that's the important thing, but if anyone else
        wants to try to compress it a little, I'd be interested in hearing how
        you go about it... :) -Ben B. --- James Stuber &lt;jstuber@...&gt;

        &gt; &gt; OK, -s- means to turn opposite face same way in &gt; space. So

        way if seen from in front on each face). So Ua = &gt; UD. U'a = U'D'.
        And &gt; so forth. &gt; &gt; One could extend this to larger cubes and
        write &gt; for instance ds, rs &gt; and so on. But with both letters

        Hi, &gt; Hi Josef, &gt; &gt; very nice to see someone finally attempting
        this :-) Currently, I am not the only one (but maybe the first one
        :))... &gt; &gt; What cube parts can you suggest to store the &gt; &gt;
        entire cube state (I mean, for 3x3x3 you need &gt; &gt; e.g. corner
        perm., corner ori., edge ori, and &gt; &gt; three additional numbers
        storing edge perm.) &gt; &gt; Three additional numbers? I don't
        understand... the edge permutation has 12! = 479,001,600 states which is
        simply too much (if not true for optimized pruning table, creating a
        transformation table is imposible). So all cube explorer- like programs
        use more numbers to store the edge permutation. 3x position of 4 edges
        (U, D, and E) seems to be good alternative for Kociemba's 2-phase
        algoritm. The number of states for each edge quadruple is 12*11*10*9 and
        together, they determine the whole edge permutation... (You can see this
        in ACube during table computation). &gt; &gt; - 6x center positions (6x
        23*22*21 states) &gt; &gt; It might be better to store the inverse of
        this, i.e. what color is at &gt; each position, not the positions of
        each color. May save some space. I cannot imagine how can I handle 4 U
        center locations and which colors are in them as an easy to transform
        number... If you can, tell me... &gt; Also, why 23*22*21 and not
        24*23*22*21? I do understand the smaller &gt; numbers for the corners
        but this here surprises me. We ignore relative positions of centers with
        the same color.. so it is binom(24,4) = 24*23*22*21/(4*3*2) =
        24*23*22*21/24 = ... I wrote the shorter form because I worked with it a
        lot... &gt; &gt; PS: I used the program to optimize sequences in &gt;
        &gt; the 4x4x4 method described by Marc Waterman &gt; &gt; in CFF 16
        (?). and I have found several significant &gt; &gt; improvements... &gt;
        &gt; Can we see those algs? Maybe they're useful for other methods as
        well? I am not sure, because the sequences are used to permute (and let
        us say orient - which otherwise makes no sense on 4x4x4) 4 UF and UB
        edges and ignores U, F, D, and B centers. However: here are some of
        them: (the sequences were chosen wrt. speed) 3-cycle: r2 F2 l F2 l' F2 r
        F2 r inter-pair swap: F2 r F2 l r F2 l lr2 F2 inter-pair+opposite swap:
        F2 r' F2 l r F2 l' F2 They may be already known... I have few solution
        of other situations, but computation has not finished yet (depth 12
        takes days to complete). I had to restart the computation often due to
        bugs... &gt; Also, did you try solving the two "parity problems" for
        people who &gt; first convert into a 3x3? I am affraid that these
        situations requires nore than 12 turns... &gt; For that I also had the
        idea of using a &gt; "2-generator"-like alg, i.e. only allowing turns of
        RrUu and maybe ld. &gt; This would reduce the branching factor a lot. I
        can try that (as soon as I have a computer that is not busy :)) Regards,
        Josef

        You could also just analyze the rules of the 5x5 (contrary to the rules
        of the 3x3, i.e. always even permutation, and orientations of edges and
        corners are restricted etc.), work out a configuration that is optimal,
        and just solve to this configuration. --- In

        Subject: RE: [Speed cubing group] Re: 5x5x5 color scheme modifiers Ok,
        here is the best I have come up with so far for the 5x5x5 adjacent swap:
        U F U2u2 r F2f2 U2u2 F2f2 r2 U2u2 F2f2 U2u2 r F2f2 U2u2 F2f2 U2u2 f2 F U
        Rr F2 U2 F2 R2r2 U2 F2 U2 Rr U2 r2 B2 U2 l U2 r' U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l' B2
        r2 This leaves only 18 stickers to be moved, which I believe is as good
        as you can do without any disassembly. With disassembly, it could be
        reduced to 14 in the same way as my 3x3x3 method, or to 12 if you also
        switched the center caps as Stefan suggested. However, disassembly is
        less practical on the 5x5x5, and as you said, you don't feel like doing
        it. Also, I realize the algorithm is pretty long, but that's because I
        made most of it up in my head, and by just trying stuff out on the cube.
        It works, and that's the important thing, but if anyone else wants to
        try to compress it a little, I'd be interested in hearing how you go
        about it... :) -Ben B. --- James Stuber &lt;jstuber@...&gt; wrote: &gt;

        SUCCESS!!! After months of preparation this afternoon I successfully
        solved a 4x4x4 Supercube blindfolded!! I didn't really time myself for
        the memorization part but the actual solve took just over 30 minutes.
        For the scramble perform the following alg (generated by Jess Bonde's
        timer) on a BOY cube (i.e. Blue/Green, White/Yellow). Keep white on UP,
        blue on FRONT, and red on LEFT (this is how I always hold my cube while
        blindfolding): L2 F b' f' U' b u2 r B D2 R L2 r' d B' r2 B2 L2 U L2 U' d
        D2 b u' B b F2 d U2 F f b U' d' l d' r2 U' F' I developed my own 3 step
        method: (1) I oriented the corners and solved the corner permutation by
        cycling as per usual 3x3x3 blindfoldsolving. (2) Then I solved the
        center permutations two pieces at a time by three cycling: Fur --- &gt;
        Dfr --- &gt; Dbr --- &gt; Fur u' r u F' u' r' u r F r' (with the
        necessary set-up moves, naturally  [X,Y], alg, [Y',X']) (3) Finally I
        solved the edge permutation by 3 cycling through: FUl --- &gt; LUf ---
        &gt; RUf --- &gt; FUl F' dR'd'L dRd'L' F (with the necessary set-up
        moves, naturally  [X,Y], alg, [Y',X']) I even took dig cam photos of
        several stages of the solve (or at least I did my best  most are off
        center as I was pretty much aiming in the general vicinity of the cube
        being blindfolded and all!!) MANY THANKS to several important
        inspirations: to Dr. Carr  for blindfold solving the "cycle" (but
        substituting an extra 3x3x3 in lieu of your broken 2x2x2!). Your pdf
        tutored me to my first 3x3x3 blindfoldsolve last fall. Many thanks also
        for your subsequent encouragement on this forum; to Chris Hardwick who
        has already blindfoldsolved a superrevenge which is where I got the
        idea; to Stephan Pochman  who coincidentally first solved 3x3x3
        blindfolded at the same time as I did, but who has already
        blindfoldsolved a 5x5x5 at the EC as well as a Megaminx (hoeffentlich
        koenne ich auch so tun); to Per Kristian Fredlund  I figured out the
        center 3 cycle I wanted to use shortly after reading your post on
        customizing your own 3 cycles; to Masayuki Akimoto  one of the nicest
        guys I met in Toronto, champion of 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 speedsolving. I
        learned the edge 3 cycle I used off your website (adapted for use from D
        to U); and to Maki and Dror  absolutely amazing blindfold solvers of ALL
        cube sizes. Happy cubing everybody - I am on cloud 9 after opening my
        eyes and seeing a solved supercube revenge. Rob

        &gt; Currently, I am not the only one (but maybe the first one :))...
        Who else is doing it? &gt; &gt; &gt; - 6x center positions (6x 23*22*21
        states) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It might be better to store the inverse of
        this, i.e. what color &gt; is at &gt; &gt; each position, not the
        positions of each color. May save some &gt; space. &gt; &gt; I cannot
        imagine how can I handle 4 U center locations and &gt; which colors are
        in them as an easy to transform number... &gt; If you can, tell me...
        Well, don't encode the locations. They're implicitly encoded. Choose
        some order of the U centers (e.g. Ufl, Ufr, Ubr, Ubl) look at the colors
        there. So for each center you have a string of four characters of
        "WYORGB". So each center has 6^4 = 1296 &lt; 10626 = 23*22*21 states.
        But I don't know what you're doing with the states, so maybe your way is
        more efficient time-wise. &gt; &gt; Also, did you try solving the two
        "parity problems" for people who &gt; &gt; first convert into a 3x3?
        &gt; &gt; I am affraid that these situations requires nore than 12
        turns... Are you sure? I only know of the 15 turns upper limit, but not
        about any lower limits... &gt; &gt; For that I also had the idea of
        using a &gt; &gt; "2-generator"-like alg, i.e. only allowing turns of
        RrUu and maybe &gt; ld. &gt; &gt; This would reduce the branching factor
        a lot. &gt; &gt; I can try that (as soon as I have a computer that is
        not busy :)) Thanks, that would be nice :-) Also thanks a lot for your
        other answers! Stefan

        Excellent achievement, congratulations! Question about your method:
        Since you're using 3-cycles all the way, what do you do if only a
        2-cycle is left at the end? Centers are easiest, but how do you handle
        corners and edges? (Not that I don't know, I'm just interested ;-) Did I
        already claim that 2004 will be *the* year for blindfold cubing? If not,
        then I do it now ;-) At the end of the year, at least 10 people will
        have done the 5x5 and lots of people will have done the 3x3... Cheers!

        Rob, congratulations! Hey you said you took pictures of the solve, do
        you have them on the internet? Those would be cool to see! Glad I could
        be one of the people who inspired you, though your BLD 4x4x4 supercube
        method is definitely MUCH better than the one I used :) Is it hard to
        memorize the cycles when you memorize that way? Two cycles of length
        potentially 24 seems like it would take practice. Do you have any
        thoughts of trying the 5x5x5 supercube? I'd like to do it one day, but I
        need a lot of practice before I'd be able to do that. Congratulations

        week I wrote a universal puzzler solver. It has now verified most of the
        tables of various puzzles that can be found on my site. I have found the
        same (or similar) sequences as Josef for the cases ignoring centres. The
        only solved case with centres is: r2 U2 r2 (uU)2 r2 u2 if I remember
        correctly, which swaps UF and UB pair. Before anyone asks, I won't
        release this program till it is finished, which is some time away. &gt;
        Well, don't encode the locations. They're implicitly encoded. &gt;

        time-wise. The problem with this is, it is hard to prune on this
        information. You need to know how many moves it takes to put those
        centres correct, and to work that out you go through positions that are
        not encoded by this scheme. Furthermore, if you have the 6 numbers of
        the centres encoded by your scheme, the effect of a move on one number
        depends on several of the others. If you encode the 24C4 possible
        positions of one colour instead, this works better since each is not
        affected by the other encoded numbers. &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, did you try

        Hi all, recently, I have contacted Marc Waterman and he was quite
        surprised... He sent me quite a detailed description of his method from
        his point of view and allowed me to make it public (I will place it on
        rubikscube.info). He also found an old booklet (about 30 pages) by
        Anneke Treep later published in CFF 14-16. He and Anneke gave me a
        permission to make it freely available, so I will upload it... What was
        surprising to me was the fact that he found his old cube and tried to
        solve that after my email and he got 21s (after many years of not
        touching it without knowing all the algorithms)! I also got a tape with
        Marc solving the cube marathon (42 cubes) in 17 minutes and some other
        videos from its author Klass Steenhuis (I hope I spell it right) with a
        permission to make it available. As soon as I grab it I will let you
        know... I hope it is interesting for somebody... Best regards, Josef

        a website so I uploaded the pictures to the photo section of this group.
        Check out the folder called "Blindfold SuperRevenge". There are 7
        pictures: 1 - Scramble 2 - Solve Corners 3 - Solve 12 centers 4 - Solve
        all centers 5 - Solve 12 edges 5b - Solve 12 edges (right view) 6 -
        SUCCESS!! All pictures are taken from the left so they show the L, U,
        and F faces. I always blindfold with White UP and Blue FRONT. Some of
        the pictures (esp #4) are a little off center as I was guessing where to
        point the camera :) I took the pictures for 2 reasons - (1) just in case
        I made an error I would be able to trace where in the solve the error
        crept in. And more importantly (2) I always lament the fact that in
        blindfold solving the actual performer does not get to see the cube
        slowly and methodically coming together. By taking photos I get the best
        of both worlds - a legit blindsolve and the opportunity to watch the
        solve devellop! You are right that solving by cycles leads to long
        strings of cycles. In fact, in this solve the center permutation was a
        long 22 center cycle together with a 2-swap. By performing the alg 10
        times I was left with 2 two swaps: 18 2, 16 12. I solved this situation
        (to answer Stephan's question) by three cycling 18 into place then three
        cycling the last three into place. Thus all centers were placed with
        just 12 applications of the same three cycle move. Memorizing the long
        strings of numbers is a little tricky at first (as there are just so
        many more than on a 3x3x3 solve) but becomes easier with practice. I
        often also use the major system to convert the numbers into letters and
        thence into an inane story with trigger words. After a little practice I
        started to prefer the really long cycles over several shorter cycles. As
        per strict rules of blindfolding I never write any information down --
        it must all be done in your head. If the edge permutation ends up with
        an odd number of pair swaps I turn the last one into a three cycle and
        set up a pair flip. To explain: if I end up with all edges solved except
        for numbers 7 and 2 which need to be swapped I make it a three cycle by
        solving 7, cycling 1 to 2 and cycling 2 to 1. Thus 1 and 2 (the white
        blue edges in my numeration) are joined but inverted. I use the 15 move
        alg to solve the pair flip and then have to apply another alg to cycle
        the UP center unit 180 degrees. This tactic works beauty on the 4x4x4
        but it wont work on the 5x5x5 supercube so I will have to find another
        way around that potentiality before I can attempt a blindfold superprof.
        Hope this all makes sense, Rob

        Hey Rob, Just a quick note that popped in my head after reading your
        mesage. If on the 5x5x5 supercube you ran into an odd permutation on the
        outer edges (so you end up with two swapped) that means that you
        absolutely must have two central centers swapped (the ones lying on an
        imaginary plus sign on the center group, I call them oddly enough "+"
        centers). What I would do is just remember that two outer edge pieces
        are switched, then start the "+" center cycles until I ended up with
        only two switched. Then you could solve both at once. Do some setup
        moves and/or cycles to set up having rUF and lUF being the two edges
        that are switched and UlS and UrS the two centers that need to swap.
        Then do the normal parity solve move r2 B2 U2 l U2 r' U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l'
        B2 r2 then move the outer four centers (I call them the "X" centers)
        back to their correct spots: r l d2 r' l' U r l d2 r' l' U' I've done a
        little bit of thinking for the 5x5x5 supercube, and that is one ways to
        handle the parity error (which is like the 3x3x3 corners and edges
        parity, in that it affects two orbits jointly, here the "+" centers and
        outer edges). Another way to handle it is to setup the two swapped edges
        in UF without affecting lUs or rUs, then do the normal parity move, and
        lastly move the X centers back: r2 B2 U2 l U2 r' U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l' B2
        r' l d2 r' l' U r l d2 r' l' U' Which fixes the edges, but also swaps
        UlS and UrS, leaving you with potentially ending with 2 two swaps in the
        "+" centers. If you end up with 2 two swaps in the "+" centers then you
        can use a setup move to get them all onto the U layer, say, and do f' b'
        E2 f b U f' b' E2 f b U' I'm sure you've thought these situations out as
        well, but I thought it would be nice to put some ideas on the board, in
        case others are trying 5x5 supercubing as well. Just to add some notes
        on the board, and of course another $0.02 :) Chris P.S. with all the
        $0.02 on this board, we should all be filthy rich by now :) --- In

        &gt; &gt; Hey you said you took pictures of the solve, do you have them
        on &gt; the &gt; &gt; internet? Those would be cool to see! &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Hi Chris, &gt; &gt; I do not currently have a website so I uploaded
        the pictures to the &gt; photo section of this group. Check out the
        folder called "Blindfold &gt; SuperRevenge". There are 7 pictures: &gt;
        &gt; 1 - Scramble &gt; 2 - Solve Corners &gt; 3 - Solve 12 centers &gt;
        4 - Solve all centers &gt; 5 - Solve 12 edges &gt; 5b - Solve 12 edges
        (right view) &gt; 6 - SUCCESS!! &gt; &gt; All pictures are taken from
        the left so they show the L, U, and F &gt; faces. I always blindfold
        with White UP and Blue FRONT. Some of &gt; the pictures (esp #4) are a
        little off center as I was guessing &gt; where to point the camera :)
        &gt; &gt; I took the pictures for 2 reasons - (1) just in case I made an
        error &gt; I would be able to trace where in the solve the error crept
        in. And &gt; more importantly (2) I always lament the fact that in
        blindfold &gt; solving the actual performer does not get to see the cube
        slowly and &gt; methodically coming together. By taking photos I get the
        best of &gt; both worlds - a legit blindsolve and the opportunity to
        watch the &gt; solve devellop! &gt; &gt; &gt; You are right that solving
        by cycles leads to long strings of &gt; cycles. In fact, in this solve
        the center permutation was a long 22 &gt; center cycle together with a
        2-swap. By performing the alg 10 times &gt; I was left with 2 two swaps:
        18 2, 16 12. I solved this situation &gt; (to answer Stephan's question)
        by three cycling 18 into place then &gt; three cycling the last three
        into place. Thus all centers were &gt; placed with just 12 applications
        of the same three cycle move. &gt; &gt; Memorizing the long strings of
        numbers is a little tricky at first &gt; (as there are just so many more
        than on a 3x3x3 solve) but becomes &gt; easier with practice. I often
        also use the major system to convert &gt; the numbers into letters and
        thence into an inane story with trigger &gt; words. After a little
        practice I started to prefer the really long &gt; cycles over several
        shorter cycles. As per strict rules of &gt; blindfolding I never write
        any information down -- it must all be &gt; done in your head. &gt; &gt;
        If the edge permutation ends up with an odd number of pair swaps I &gt;
        turn the last one into a three cycle and set up a pair flip. To &gt;
        explain: if I end up with all edges solved except for numbers 7 and &gt;
        2 which need to be swapped I make it a three cycle by solving 7, &gt;
        cycling 1 to 2 and cycling 2 to 1. Thus 1 and 2 (the white blue &gt;
        edges in my numeration) are joined but inverted. I use the 15 move &gt;
        alg to solve the pair flip and then have to apply another alg to &gt;
        cycle the UP center unit 180 degrees. This tactic works beauty on &gt;
        the 4x4x4 but it wont work on the 5x5x5 supercube so I will have to &gt;
        find another way around that potentiality before I can attempt a &gt;
        blindfold superprof. &gt; &gt; Hope this all makes sense, &gt; &gt; Rob

        I kind of doubt the Cube Prix will work. The World Cube Cup hasn't been
        that successful because people don't have attention spans long enough to
        remember to submit their entries when they are due, hence, the big delay
        in the World Cube Cup. (For those of you wondering, we'll have the next
        round soon... if there are any teams left.) I kind of doubt people will
        be submitting times consistently enough for you to have any type of Cube
        Prix. Furthermore, I really doubt you'll have enough people submitting
        times consistently so there's actually competition for the people. As
        for another contest, I believe the addition of the Friday contest was
        already too much. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of Technology

        I appreciate your doubts:) if people don't submit entries, then they
        have no chance to win prizes! to bad for them. People will compete out
        of their own free will, and will participate in contests they enjoy. I

        knowing all the algorithms)! &gt; &gt; I also got a tape with Marc

        If I can get the interest in it, then Cube Prix won't be a problem. And

        Furthermore, you're going to give prizes away in an online contest?
        What's to stop someone from cheating? If I were to say I solved the cube
        12 times consecutively between 15 and 16 seconds and I had perfect
        solves every time, no one would have a right to accuse me of cheating.

        seconds and those can be &gt; faked. And then what, &gt; you would
        disqualify me because my times are not &gt; believable? What if I &gt;

        The tournament date is scheduled for October 16, 2004. I will confirm
        this date within 24 hours. I'm just waiting for one response. The
        tournament will be held at Polytechnic High School which is right across
        the street from Caltech. The auditorium is amazing. I think you guys
        will really like it. If you are planning on competing in the blindfold
        competition, we will be doing the blindfold solves simultaneously on
        stage. Audience members that make noise will be removed from the
        competition hall during the blindfold solve competition. Tyson Mao MSC

        Okay, we're going to the final round. Only four teams had enough members
        submitting times to move on. There's no need for United States A to play
        United States B because we know who's going to win so we're going to the
        final round. For the gold medal, it will be United States A vs. Japan
        For the bronze medal, it will be United States B vs. Poland
        http://www.its.caltech.edu/~tmao/cube/cup.htm Due on September 9. Guess
        what? Make sure all members of your team compete. Japan is playing down
        a person and on September 9, I'm updating and not waiting for anyone.
        Have fun! P.S. If you get this e-mail, I would send an e-mail
        immediately to your other four team members reminding everyone to do it.

        Hey, it could happen. I think the whole gymnastics fiasco is a good
        example of what we must protect against in cubing. If a judge writes the
        wrong time down on a score sheet, the competitor should file the
        complaint before the score sheet reaches the tournament desk. In other
        words, please double check the judge. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        My basic approach runs like this: - Break the cube in (only applies to
        first time lubing). - Disassemble cube, and spread all pieces (including
        central skeleton) out on an old newspaper. Make sure the windows are
        open. - Spray all (internal) sides of all pieces, e.g. the sides that
        cause friction when moving. Don't be afraid to get lube on other parts
        though. - Wait 5 minutes, and spray again. Try not to touch the pieces
        when you spray, it's possible to put them all out so you can reach the
        vital areas without having to pick them up. - Wait about 15 minutes.
        Then wipe all pieces dry. - Assemble, and cube away! --- In

        Remember the D key ;) It'll get you out of a tight spot from time to
        time. After running through them again, I can definately say levels 15,
        11, and 14 are the hardest for me (in that order). For some reason the
        other puzzles just kind of make sense, but these three really make me
        think! BTW, lars I'd be interested in the solution program! Furthermore,

        &gt; The problem with this is, it is hard to prune on this information.
        &gt; You need to know how many moves it takes to put those centres &gt;
        correct, and to work that out you go through positions that are not &gt;
        encoded by this scheme. &gt; Furthermore, if you have the 6 numbers of
        the centres encoded by your &gt; scheme, the effect of a move on one
        number depends on several of the &gt; others. &gt; If you encode the
        24C4 possible positions of one colour instead, this &gt; works better
        since each is not affected by the other encoded numbers. Yeah ok, I can
        now see the advantages. Makes me look stupid because I always used the
        way I described to store puzzle states. Next time I write a solver I'll
        think about using this one instead. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For that I also
        had the idea of using a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "2-generator"-like alg, i.e.
        only allowing turns of RrUu and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maybe ld. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; This would reduce the branching factor a lot. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I can try that (as soon as I have a computer that is not
        busy :) ) &gt; &gt; I'll try that too. Thanks, I'd be very much
        interested in 2gen algs for the parity problems :-) Stefan

        &gt; If the edge permutation ends up with an odd number of pair swaps I
        &gt; turn the last one into a three cycle and set up a pair flip. To
        &gt; explain: if I end up with all edges solved except for numbers 7 and
        &gt; 2 which need to be swapped I make it a three cycle by solving 7,
        &gt; cycling 1 to 2 and cycling 2 to 1. Thus 1 and 2 (the white blue
        &gt; edges in my numeration) are joined but inverted. I use the 15 move
        &gt; alg to solve the pair flip and then have to apply another alg to
        &gt; cycle the UP center unit 180 degrees. Another idea for a single
        swap: Bring the two edges to UFl and UBl treating the 4x4 as a 3x3 (or
        just bring them on opposite ends of such a "row" and rotate the whole
        cube). Now do this alg: R2r2 U2 l U2 r' U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l' R2r2 This
        probably looks familiar to you, right? Cheers! Stefan

        Hey Stefan, Whoa I had never thought of that, glad I posted so that I
        could be pointed out for that mistake. I started thinking about it
        again, so let me rephrase what I said earlier. If you end up with an odd
        permutation on the outer edges then either: 1) The "+" centers
        permutation is also odd or 2) The corner permutation AND the permutation
        of the "X" centers are also odd. It turns out that my solving strategy
        for the 5x5 supercube influenced my thinking about the parities. I
        always correct the "X" center parity in my speedsolve solution before I
        would even begin to look for the parity error, so I always eliminated
        that second possibility. For 5x5x5 supercube blindfold solving here is
        my first stab at all the possible parity states (permutations only) 1)
        no odd orbits 2) corners, "X" centers, "+" centers, central edges all
        odd 3) corners, "X" centers, central edges, outer edges all odd 4) outer
        edges, "+" centers both odd Case 2 and 3 would both also have odd
        orientations of the central most centers (since the corner permutation
        is odd). I think that's it, based on all the possible moves. I guess it
        would help to come up with a strategy for each case before attempting a
        BLD 5x5 supercube solve, but it seems you could think through the
        process during the solving as well. Wow, all this thinking about 5x5x5
        supercube solving has me REALLY wanting to try it now :) I'll have to
        get my cube from home and start working on this. Chris --- In

        &gt; Another way to handle it is to setup the two swapped edges in UF
        &gt; without affecting lUs or rUs, then do the normal parity move, and
        &gt; lastly move the X centers back: &gt; &gt; r2 B2 U2 l U2 r' U2 r U2

        The legality issue crossed my mind too. But I don't think there's a
        problem. He's not claiming the work as his own. He's not restricting
        access to the site in any way, without permission of the author. It
        could be argued as a finder's fee. Like paying someone $1000 bucks for
        finding a good deal on a car. You could've found it yourself, but
        instead paid them to do it. Still, I think that if whomever owns the
        link he's sending out wanted him to stop, it should be stopped. There's
        the bandwidth issue, which isn't a good argument if the site is
        publicised. And then there's the fact that the owner of the site isn't

        I'd be willing to pay for it but I don't have an eBay account. We should
        find out what link it is, and get that person to mess around in their

        not. It's just information that's being sold. If someone really wants to
        pay for the link then it would be wrong to prevent them from doing so -
        of course you could try to dissuade them (*). In fact, if they find the
        item on ebay and realize there is such a page but then don't consider
        searching for it (and, surely, if they know of ebay they will know of
        some search engine) then what fault of the seller is that? I'd have
        thought you'd be all for the freedom of speech of the seller, being that
        it is in the US constitution (not that the seller is from the US), and
        encourage his capital opportunism rather than trying to mess with the
        site/auction. It's somewhat like arguing about shops selling maps of
        town when you can often pick them up for free (or at a much lower cost)
        from the Tourist Information Centre, provided you can find it without a
        map. (*) Besides which, if you're against it, you could equally just
        sell the item with a reserve of zero (or, if that's against the rules,
        sell it with a high reserve but explicitly mention the link in the text
        - so that nobody will pay for it). &gt;This guy is probably trying to
        make money off &gt; of Jaap's site or something. Oh look! He's selling

        Hi, does anybody tried a different way to solve F2L: - solve 4 D corners
        - solve R center + RD, RF, and RB edges - solve LD, LF, and LB edges
        (only U, M, and R turns) - solve D center + DF and DB edges (only U and
        M turns) It is similar to part of Gilles's method, but it is "more
        corners-first". The advantages would be (?): - less turns (although
        using slices) - no need to turn the whole cube - turns restricted to U M
        R for most of time... What do you think? Josef

        Hey Guys, Check out http://www.its.caltech.edu/~tmao/SolveTheCube.doc .
        It's a document I've written that explains how to solve the cube. It's
        all in text and we plan to distribute it to people on the street as part
        of a cube filming event on Thursday. There's not much room for change as
        you will see I take up exactly 3 pages... but let me know if this would
        make sense to anyone who doesn't know how to cube. Of course, I'm
        counting that I'll be out there on the street explaining things to
        people to supplement this as well... And yeah, pictures would be better.
        But I only had text... Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute of

        3-cycled three X-edges instead of three outer edges at one point. I do
        know I did this at least once but I realized and fixed it. It's because
        I use very similar algorithms for the different cubie types: M d M' U M
        d' M' U' l d l' U l d' l' U' l D l' U l D' l' U' So if I turn d instead
        of D then I apply the wrong 3-cycle. And it's very easy to continue
        doing d after having done it 25 times in a row ; -) Next attempt later
        this week. Stefan

        There's not much room for change as you will see I take up exactly 3

        anyone who &gt; &gt; doesn't &gt; &gt; &gt; know how to cube. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; There are actually two mistakes. The last move of step 4
        should be F' &gt; &gt; instead &gt; &gt; of F, and the last move of step
        6 should be U' instead of U (this one &gt; &gt; doesn't &gt; &gt; matter
        so much since it's only an alignment move). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Andy

        To those that were asking a few weeks ago, the new 3x3 DIY kits are now
        at rubiks.com in the DIY section of the shop. They are the new arched

        The 10th solve was a POP, and the 1st solve was a PLL skip using COLL.
        &gt; &gt; So this wasn't a rolling average, and I didn't do a 13th solve
        for &gt; for that POP. The only thing I feel bad about is that it could
        have &gt; been all sub-16 if it wasn't for that POP.... Anyways, there
        still &gt; seems to be some (although very little) room for improvement,
        and I &gt; think sub-14 should be possible with nice scrambles. =D &gt;
        &gt; Just wanted to let you all know.... Good luck to all (Tyson
        included &gt; ^^) attempting to break a barrier! &gt; &gt; Macky &gt;
        &gt; p.s. Thanks to Chris Hunt for his timer!

        Anyone know their color configuration ? And btw, if you buy one, you
        might wanna buy one of their sticker replacement thing too because their

        I can easily get the first layer to the second layer edges, and then I
        can easily get the second layer edges to circulate all the way around.
        ....but then I have to use the Rubiks.com instructions to rotate the
        final layer around because I can't use the bottom layer to move things
        around anymore. Do I have to memorize the Rubiks.com algorithms or is
        there an easier way? Thanks! PS. My record time is 5:50, always

        Hi Stephan and Chris, I have just moved to a new city for the new
        University year (Winnipeg) so I have spent the last week getting packed
        and ready etc. Thus I haven't had any time to try to tackle the 5x5x5
        blindfolded as a supercube. I am very keen on trying it. I will
        hopefully be able to work out a solution that takes all the different
        parities into account. (or as you guys point out -- it can be worked out
        while solving) If so I will then practice that solution style a couple
        of times with eyes open before sitting down to memorize the whole deal.
        I'm not too worried about the memorization aspect. My blindfold failures
        are only rarely caused by memory lapse - most often I simply forget to
        undo a set-up move :( Thanks for all your input on solution strategy.
        I'm sure that one of us will get there eventually. Rob --- In

        while, I'm now quite sure that I forgot to undo a &gt; "U" &gt; &gt;
        move during the last 3-cycle for the X-centers. Too bad. Your turn. &gt;
        &gt; Actually it can't be the only mistake. I believe now that I also
        &gt; 3-cycled three X-edges instead of three outer edges at one point. I
        do &gt; know I did this at least once but I realized and fixed it. It's
        &gt; because I use very similar algorithms for the different cubie
        types: &gt; M d M' U M d' M' U' &gt; l d l' U l d' l' U' &gt; l D l' U l
        D' l' U' &gt; So if I turn d instead of D then I apply the wrong
        3-cycle. And it's &gt; very easy to continue doing d after having done
        it 25 times in a row ; &gt; -) &gt; &gt; Next attempt later this week.

        There are dozens of methods out there, most don't have names. Even if
        your not going for speed or efficency, I highly recommend learning the
        notation... RLUDFB,R'L'U'D'F'B',R2L2U2D2F2B2 (what these 18 things mean,
        it is documented everywhere) For the final layer, if you are not going
        for speed then there are ways of doing it that require little or no
        memorization. If you've ever read about very basic modern algebra/group
        theory, then the way to flip edges (in place) and twist corners (in
        place) can be done with p*d*p^-1 type sequences. Moving pieces around
        (permuting) can be done with what I like to call "toggle-moves" such as
        for corners: R'D'R-U-R'DR-U-R'D'R-U2-R'DR (assuming your last layer is
        on the top). A similar one can be cooked up for edges. It's more fun to
        play around with these elegant approaches before you really get into it,
        especailly if all you want to do is solve. This way you won't have to
        re-memorize algorithms whenever you need to do a solve if you don't do
        it regularly. It really shows the beauty of cube solving also. I'm sure
        there are many advanced cubist that have yet to fully appreciate or for
        some, even know about elegent or perhaps "zero- algorithm" approches. Oh
        and you can twist corners by p=[R'D2R-FD2F'] and then do various
        p*U^x*p^-1 where U^x stands for U,U2, or U' and p^-1 is doing p
        backwards...[FD2F'-R'D2R]. Heck this can even be generalized a bit
        further. Once you can solve it consistantly say under 2:30 then it is
        time to read up on the mainstream method or something that will allow
        for a smooth transition to one. I recommend
        http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html her page
        is very beginner-friendly. Good luck, if you are so inclined. -Doug Li

        documented everywhere) &gt; &gt; For the final layer, if you are not
        going for speed then there are &gt; ways of doing it that require little
        or no memorization. If you've &gt; ever read about very basic modern
        algebra/group theory, then the way &gt; to flip edges (in place) and
        twist corners (in place) can be done &gt; with p*d*p^-1 type sequences.
        Moving pieces around (permuting) can &gt; be done with what I like to
        call "toggle-moves" such as for corners: &gt;
        R'D'R-U-R'DR-U-R'D'R-U2-R'DR (assuming your last layer is on the &gt;
        top). A similar one can be cooked up for edges. &gt; What's the "-" for?
        I had figured (reading the end first), that you were meaning
        [R'D2R-FD2F'] (below) to be a commutator (and hence "-" would be in
        place of the usual "," but that's clearly not the way it's being used
        above. &gt; It's more fun to play around with these elegant approaches
        before &gt; you really get into it, especailly if all you want to do is
        solve. &gt; This way you won't have to re-memorize algorithms whenever
        you need &gt; to do a solve if you don't do it regularly. It really
        shows the &gt; beauty of cube solving also. &gt; &gt; I'm sure there are
        many advanced cubist that have yet to fully &gt; appreciate or for some,
        even know about elegent or perhaps "zero- &gt; algorithm" approches.
        &gt; &gt; Oh and you can twist corners by p=[R'D2R-FD2F'] and then do
        various &gt; p*U^x*p^-1 where U^x stands for U,U2, or U' and p^-1 is
        doing p &gt; backwards...[FD2F'-R'D2R]. Heck this can even be
        generalized a bit &gt; further. &gt; &gt; Once you can solve it
        consistantly say under 2:30 then it is time to &gt; read up on the
        mainstream method or something that will allow for a &gt; smooth
        transition to one. I recommend &gt;
        http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html &gt; her
        page is very beginner-friendly. Good luck, if you are so &gt; inclined.

        to rotate the &gt; final layer around because I can't use the bottom
        layer to move things &gt; around anymore. &gt; &gt; Do I have to
        memorize the Rubiks.com algorithms or is there an easier &gt; way? As
        you discovered, solving 1st+2nd+3rd layer is kind of like getting
        yourself trapped in a corner. It turns out that memorising algorithms is
        the easiest way to get out of it. If you want to solve the cube with
        your head and not just memorise the solutions (sounds like a good idea
        to me), then you really have to master the cube. Unfortunately, there
        are no websites that teach this :-) Most people are putting their effort
        into methods that require more and more memorisation. 1st+2nd+3rd layer
        is probably the most difficult method out there, but but it is ideal for
        memorisation because the number of different cases that can appear is
        low. And if you memorise solutions to all cases, it no longer matters
        how difficult that step is. In my own solving method, I use no memorised
        algorithms, so my strategy is very different. I do not care about the
        number of different cases that can appear in each step, I care about how
        easy each step is to figure out. If this is what you're aiming for, then
        starting with two layers is not a logical approach. I don't have a
        complete description of my method yet, but you can read about what I
        have so far here: http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/cube/ Notice
        that there is no "last layer" step. Ryan

        &gt; PS: the original booklet of Waterman's method with &gt; his
        comments can be found at http://rubikscube.info Thanks again. A few
        interesting things in Marc's comments: 1) "I tried to improve my method
        by avoiding this table. I left out one edge of the first face. This edge
        is called a "ledge". This ledge is solved, together with one redge,
        after solving the corners of the R-face. In the booklet of Anneke Treep
        there is a table for solving the ledge and the redge." This way, the
        method looks like a rather common corners-first method. (ok, sequences
        in table 8 are very intuitive - but I STILL can't understand why he
        decided to solve the first side completely in the first place). 2) "The
        placing of the midges takes three slices. Sometimes it is possible to
        eliminate or shorten this by anticipating. This is often possible when
        you solve one redge, together with the midges. Or when you have to solve
        only two midges." In the paper, they say something similar: "Still, when
        turning the last moves of the third stage one may already insert moves
        so that this stage may sometimes be avoided. This of course requires a
        lot of experience". Well, too bad they don't describe more precisely how
        they can anticipate and avoid this last M-permutation, that's the only
        thing I'm really interested in. I've been trying to do this for months,
        and it makes me think that it's only interesting in a few special cases.

        fact that it was one of the first "official" methods supplied by Ideal,
        it requires less concentration focused on L face when solving R face
        edges because you can rotate the L face (or the whole cube around L-R
        axis) as you want and it requires less steps then using only the learned
        sequences without intuitive steps... (although there are quite large
        amount of required sequences)... Also arter solving (or during solving)
        R corners you need not pay attention to the L edge hole to be placed at
        top when this step is finished... This is only my opinion... &gt; 2)

        and &gt; it makes me think that it's only interesting in a few special
        cases. Just my experience: the last turns before the M-permutation are
        Ux Mx(sometimes Rx) U2. Quite often, you can merge these moves with the
        last M-permutation and it just disappears (using max. 1 additional)
        turn... It is not so hard to see that... Not so good situation is
        connecting last Ux turn with first U2 turn of M-permutation (saves 2
        turs). Josef Josef

        &gt; &gt; Well, too bad they don't describe more precisely how they can

        2 turs). Yes, that's the only optimization I can see. Ok, it's not just
        a few special cases as I said, it happens relatively often (25%, or a
        little bit more if you're thinking about optimizing UE2ME2 for HTM) (I
        have to slow down a bit if I don't want to miss it). Is it possible to
        optimize further and merge Table 5 and the M-permutation in a more
        clever way? Gilles.

        When teaching beginners I find it easier to use R'D2R-U-R'D2R-U-
        R'D2R-U2-R'D2R which makes the base move (R'D2R), an inverse of itself =
        a bit easier to remember. Just the one move + some U's in between :)
        It's a waste of moves of course, but most people seem to find it easier

        Here are some tips/hint that could help... Off course, you will need
        your memory for memorizing algorithms, but maybe these tips could make
        things a bit easier. 1. Break algoritms up in parts of a couple of
        moves. You might notice some moves, like RU'R'U, RUR'U' (or just RUR')
        appear frequently. You can memorize them as 'one move'. See
        http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#hints, where
        some of these moves are illustrated with videos. If you know some of
        these 'triggers', you can memorize the algorithms as sequences of
        triggers, instead of single moves. Don't try to memorize the R's and
        U's, just memorize what your hands need to do.
        http://www.speedcubing.com/peter/AllesFastPermute.html is a nice website
        for learning PLL, but I'dd recommend to take a look at different
        websites, to see if you can find one with algs you like... 2. In some
        cases, I look for patterns on the cube, like columns, squares or
        Corner-edge pairs. Sometimes I just memorize how to manipulate those
        patterns. This is also usefull when you memorize a cube rotation...
        (Don't memorize the x, y etc. but remember which pattern you should see
        after the cube rotation). 3. Maybe you can search this yahoo group for
        more tips, I am pretty sure this subject has been discussed before. Good
        luck, Joel.

        This worked for me and I still do it today to learn a new alg: I would
        do the 1st two moves of the new algorithm at least 5 times. Then I would
        add the 3rd move and do the first 3 moves 5 times. Then I would add the
        4th turn and so on doing the growing sequence 5-10 times until I
        finished. For me at least, the triggers and groupings kinda just come
        automatically after you do it so many times. Your fingers naturally want
        to adjust the grip and position to twist the sequence as fast as they
        can. -Howard --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "gregvdyke"

        Oh right, never thought of this. It's indeed a lot easier. Maybe it's
        because I came up with this for the Megaminx and there's no D2 ;-) Still

        Michiel, can you add subpages? I know I, and also probably Stefan
        Pochmann, Rob Butler, and Per Fredlund would have a lot to say about
        properties of larger cubes and also supercubes. I would be interested in
        adding a section about this, but would it be something worth reading?
        Stefan, Rob would you guys be interested in typing up a supercube page
        as well? Richard Carr, you also seem to be a master of larger cubes and
        the math behind them :) Would you be interested? Just a thought, I think
        it would be cool to have something about supercubes and larger cubes,
        but it's highly specialized. I wonder if it would be read much at all.

        Hi this is Adam, um a lot of you guys sent me stuff on the f2l stuff and
        i really dont get it all that well. I can solve the cube in about 2
        minutes using some begginer way to solve it but now i want to move on to
        the first two layers then last layer, i was wondering if you people new
        of any algorithms there are that a BEGGINER! ! !i dont get the stuff you
        guys usually send so yeah, well thanks if you decide to help, bye Adam

        Hi Adam- This is what I did right after I memorized the beginner
        solution: Practice till I got to 1:05-1:15 Memorize Corner Orientation
        Algs Memorize Edge Orientation Algs (There are 3 algs, you already know
        one) Memorize Edge Permutation F2L PLL I'm still 4 algs away from PLL,
        but Macky advises you learn PLL before F2L. Takahito Domon proves F2L
        isn't really needed, but PLL really helps. He proved sub18 is possible
        with just PLL (In other words, he does: Cross 1st layer corners Middle
        layer edges Orient corners Orient edges Permute in 1 step) So my advice
        is to memorize algorithms for 4 step last layer. Then work on 3 step
        last layer, by permuting in one step (21 Algorithms, but if you know of
        the edge permutation, and the one corner permutation you have only 16
        algs to go) Er, I hope I didn't confuse you too bad... I'm not a great
        cuber, and I'm not sure what others did. But I had Macky tell me what to
        do. =P -Sunil --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi Well, now that I got some reactions to my post, please stop bothering
        me, and bother the page. The reason that it is highly incomplete is
        because it was an invitation to start correcting it. So please stop
        posting and mailing me about things that are incorrect and just change
        them. That's the whole wiki-idea. If you don't feel like registering
        there than just click on 'edit' and you can change the article right
        there and then. Making a subweb is a matter of creating a page for a new
        word or term, and then link the speedcubing wiki page to your page. Just
        read the tutorial. Michiel

        Hey Daniel, The easiest way I have found (in windows) is to use a batch
        file. You can open up notepad, or another plain text editor, and type:
        java -jar JNetCube.jar and then save the file as "run.bat". Make sure to
        store this file in the same directory as JNetCube.jar. You can then
        execute the program by either double-clicking the .bat file, or by
        creating a shortcut to the .bat file on your desktop or something.

        a supercube page but since I just moved universities and I am now
        teaching new courses I'll need at least a month to get settled in before
        I can dedicate the time to doing it right. The good side about a new

        for the heads up :) oh, damn I'll have to add something. It's based on

        even do slowly, let alone at full speed). From there, even the zbignew

        theoretical (talking out of my ass actually) stand point, I'd say that
        humans are able to cope with 3 pieces at a time. A three-cycle is at

        may be complete rubbish) This reminds me of your "ideal method". Even if

        &gt; It sounds like you use algorithms to solve the cross. Is that true?
        Isn't everybody? It's just that you usually make up an appropriate
        algorithm on the fly instead of using one that you've learned
        beforehand. But you're right, "algorithms" should be defined. We usually
        mean the "off the fly" ones and you don't need any of them to solve the
        cube which contradicts the "Solving here means the cube is scrambled and
        you use algorithms". The part "the cube is scrambled and you use

        Hi I am not the owner nor moderator of the page, but I have some ideas
        about them - Any page about larger cubes should be categorized as part
        of the Rubik's Cube page, not the speedcubing page. - wikipedia is an
        encyclopedia, and as such should only explain basic facts to the general
        audience, explaining them in as much detail as is needed, but not more.
        The page should explain: 'what is speedcubing?' not 'how do I
        speedcube?' So I think your article serves a purpose, though not the
        solution and tips part. If you feel like editing, keep in mind that HTML
        can also be pasted, though the special wiki syntax is preferred.

        pieces are more likely to be randomly scattered (not in 3-cycle
        positions), and not much of the cube needs to be preserved to solve
        them. For the first 10 pieces: 3 pieces - 3 moves 1 piece - 3 moves 3
        pieces - 5 moves 3 pieces - 7 moves (rough move count only) Another
        point is that I think as you approach the end, and (for example) all the

      <br />
      <div class="email-content">
        Hey everyone, I've been experimenting with the double extended cross
        recently, and wanted to share some insights. I get the feeling that a
        number of other people are trying/using extended cross sometimes, so I
        thought at least some people would be interested if I posted here. I was
        able to do the double extended cross 3 times tonight, two of the
        attempts were done successfully on timed speed solves and the times I
        got were very good compared to my average. Two things came to my
        attention when practicing these tonight: 1) If you have a REALLY nice
        setup for an extended cross on a color that is not your regular color,
        take some time during the inspection to see if you could do a double
        extended cross on that other color. If not, then its your call whether
        or not to do the extended cross on an "off" color. If you do see a
        double extended cross on that other color though, then I would
        definitely recommend doing the solve with that "off" color as your cross
        color. The time you gain by doing a double extended cross will more than
        make up for your delays at recognizing a different color during the F2L.
        2) It seems to me that noticing double Xcross solves involving two
        adjacent corner edge pairs is much more likely than for two diagonally
        opposite corner edge pairs. I can sometimes get a double Xcross solve on
        two opposite pairs, but I usually don't notice them, especially given
        only 15 seconds of inspection. A good setup that seems to catch my eye
        is if you can, in very few moves, form a 1x2x3 block out of any pieces.
        If you can, try to find a way to insert the other two edges such as to
        create a full 2x2x3. If you can notice that too, try to follow the other
        edge around for your solution and see at which point you can change your
        regular solution (if necessary) to make that very last edge easy to
        insert into its position. ------ So anyway I just wanted to say that I
        have started to consider double Xcross solves as something that isn't
        impossible to notice in 15 seconds and still execute succesfully. It
        would probably come up very rarely, for me tonight it was only maybe
        2-3% out of all my speedsolve attempts, but when it does come up it
        helps your times sooo much. Both of my speedsolve double Xcrosses
        tonight were around 11-12 moves as far as I can remember, and I'm pretty
        sure both were on one of my "off" colors for the cross too. So if anyone
        else is interested they seem to be more likely to occur on adjancet c/e
        pairs, and also don't be afraid to be color neutral when looking for one
        during the 15 seconds inspection. Hope this helps for anyone who has
        also considered trying a double Xcross strategy sometimes, Chris

        it, i'am really just starting on the F2L for the speed solving, but i
        know pretty much Dan Knights intermidiate way on solving the cube, if
        you get me?~but if you dont get me thats alright no one really does they

        Little update on single layer solving. I have found that if I put in two
        opposite edges first then it is pretty easy to put together two
        corner/edge (top layer) pairs so that you have a cross and two corners
        in. On average even at speed this is taking me 10-12 moves. My reasoning
        was that one of the problems I get is putting in such a corner/edge pair
        when there are already corners solved and this method gets around that.
        Might be of help to others although its probably nothing new. Duncan

        Yes, right, you're absolutely right! I meant layer then. I guess that

        didn't use the word "layer" because I was thinking it is ambiguous in

        Hey! I can second this! Knowing commutators inside/out so to speak is
        tremendously useful! That's basically how i solve 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cube
        varieties. I know i lag a bit behind the very top few on these puzzles.
        But im still fast. Commutators are most often used to create 3-cycles.
        Be it on corners, edges or (on larger cubes) centers. I will try to keep
        this short. A commutator is of the form ABA'B'. This is very useful if A
        creates a small effect on a layer or a "layer-block". Now B should
        change only that layer or that block of layers. Now complete the
        commutator w A' and B' (inverse of A and B respectively). I hope it's
        intuitive how to do the inverse of a sequence of moves. If A changed
        only 1 piece (cubicle) on layer changed w B u will end up w a 3-cycle.
        See Stefan's example. A 3-cycle can be made into another 3 cycle by
        doing some setup moves first, do the commutator, and then do the setup
        moves in reverse. It can be proven that this whole thing is also a
        commutator, but that's only of interest to mathematicians ;-) Now back
        to my way of doing 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes. I do first layer intuitively.
        I might possibly leave a few centers unsolved (esp if they are on the
        opposite face). Next steps : - middle layers edges Done completely w
        3-cycles (commutators). - last layer corners Position them - done w a
        3-cycle or a double 2-cycle. Both are commutators or with setup move and
        commutator. Orient them - again commutators. I can explain why but too
        lenghty to do it here. - last layer edges Lots of 3-cycles on edges
        (commutators again). Parity is also basically fixed with an edge
        3-cycle. - centers More 3-cycles. :-) -Per PS! I will i will make a site
        someday with my whole methodology of doing these larger cubes. Just too
        busy now being student and working parttime. &gt; --- In

        I've read the stiff hands tutorial &amp; 'Richard Carr's somewhat
        comical blindfolded solutions for the 1x1x1 up to the 4x4x4'. I really
        like the stiff hands page, because for me it seems easier to follow. I
        can orient corners and sometimes permute, but I'm just using fridrich
        stuff and trying to remember in my head how to put the peices where they
        need to go, while not screwing up the orientations. I'm not really
        following the method like I probably should be... Many times I put all
        the corners into the correct places but a few are oriented incorrectly,
        sometimes even permuted incorrectly. I think I'm doing the right
        algorithms with my eyes closed, but I must be holding the cube in the
        wrong manner or something. I know a small amount about commutators of
        the form ABA'B' from some cuber's posts and from my undergraduate
        engineering studies, but I don't think I absolutely need to learn them
        in depth to be able to blindsolve continuously. First, I'd just like to
        be able to acheive a full blindsolve! I sort-of followed the stiff hands
        algorithms, but they don't seem to work for me when I'm blindfolded.
        Could you, or somebody else PLEASE, email to myself, or post the five
        exact algorithms they use that don't screw up other things. I would
        really appreciate it. Thanks, Rommy barg0023@...

        Interesting insights Chris. I think intuitive steps are an important
        part of a method. Doing things intuitively rather than using algorithms
        can allow for much more efficient and faster solving though it takes a
        good cuber and a lot of practice to be able to handle a large intuitive
        step such as a double xcross. The point you make about using "off"
        colors is also interesting. I used to do this when I solved corners
        first just picking the side with corners that are the most complete.
        Learning to quickly make a cross of any color (and solve the rest of the
        cube that way) would definately be beneficial and is good and different
        way to get faster without leaning more algs. I would not think it would
        be an easy task but it might be worth it. Does anyone do this? I can
        easily make the cross on either the white or yellow side (since they are
        opposite) but rarely ever make it yellow. This is probably something I
        will practice more now. --barefoot Chris --- In

        I get the feeling that a number of &gt; other people are trying/using
        extended cross sometimes, so I thought &gt; at least some people would
        be interested if I posted here. &gt; &gt; I was able to do the double
        extended cross 3 times tonight, two of &gt; the attempts were done
        successfully on timed speed solves and the &gt; times I got were very
        good compared to my average. &gt; &gt; Two things came to my attention
        when practicing these tonight: &gt; &gt; 1) If you have a REALLY nice
        setup for an extended cross on a color &gt; that is not your regular
        color, take some time during the inspection &gt; to see if you could do
        a double extended cross on that other color. &gt; If not, then its your
        call whether or not to do the extended cross &gt; on an "off" color.
        &gt; &gt; If you do see a double extended cross on that other color
        though, &gt; then I would definitely recommend doing the solve with that
        "off" &gt; color as your cross color. The time you gain by doing a
        double &gt; extended cross will more than make up for your delays at
        recognizing &gt; a different color during the F2L. &gt; &gt; 2) It seems
        to me that noticing double Xcross solves involving two &gt; adjacent
        corner edge pairs is much more likely than for two &gt; diagonally
        opposite corner edge pairs. I can sometimes get a double &gt; Xcross
        solve on two opposite pairs, but I usually don't notice them, &gt;
        especially given only 15 seconds of inspection. &gt; &gt; A good setup
        that seems to catch my eye is if you can, in very few &gt; moves, form a
        1x2x3 block out of any pieces. If you can, try to &gt; find a way to
        insert the other two edges such as to create a full &gt; 2x2x3. If you
        can notice that too, try to follow the other edge &gt; around for your
        solution and see at which point you can change your &gt; regular
        solution (if necessary) to make that very last edge easy to &gt; insert
        into its position. &gt; &gt; ------ &gt; &gt; So anyway I just wanted to
        say that I have started to consider &gt; double Xcross solves as
        something that isn't impossible to notice in &gt; 15 seconds and still
        execute succesfully. It would probably come up &gt; very rarely, for me
        tonight it was only maybe 2-3% out of all my &gt; speedsolve attempts,
        but when it does come up it helps your times &gt; sooo much. Both of my
        speedsolve double Xcrosses tonight were &gt; around 11-12 moves as far
        as I can remember, and I'm pretty sure &gt; both were on one of my "off"
        colors for the cross too. &gt; &gt; So if anyone else is interested they
        seem to be more likely to occur &gt; on adjancet c/e pairs, and also
        don't be afraid to be color neutral &gt; when looking for one during the
        15 seconds inspection. &gt; &gt; Hope this helps for anyone who has also
        considered trying a double &gt; Xcross strategy sometimes, &gt; &gt;

        I used to do the cross color on best setup color for a couple of months
        straight when I first started. I remember reading on Dan Knights' page
        that the cross, when solved on the same color, can be done in 6.5 moves
        on average. When I was absolutely fluent with solving the cross on the
        best color given only 15 seconds inspection, I was able to do the cross
        in 5.5 moves on average. I took several 100 averages to test this and it
        always seemed to work out to 1 less move than solving the same color
        every time. I gave up on solving the best cross in order to instead
        always solve white after a while, since I liked the advantage of being
        totally comfortable with always seeing the same colors during the F2L.
        For the 4x4x4 though I always solve the best setup pair of opposite
        colors, but for each pair of opposite colors I always choose the same
        one to be on the top no matter what. This might be useful for the 3x3x3,
        choose the best setup cross of only three different top layer colors,
        which would make it 3 times more likely to for you to have a good cross,
        but still retain familiarity with the F2L colors. I had never thought of
        that, and since I know it works from 4x4x4 solving I'd like to try it on
        the 3x3x3 and see if it works well there too. Chris perhaps this might
        be a happy medium between always solving the best cross color, and
        always solving the same color? Anyway I do agree that someone who was
        100% fluent at solving the F2L using any cross color would be faster
        than someone who always solved the same color, assuming both used
        exactly the same solving method. This might be interesting to try. Like
        Chris said though, does anyone else solve the best setup color already,
        regardless of what method you use? Chris --- In

        Hi Chris(es), I personally always solve white cross. I perfer on top but
        somtimes shift it to bottom while solving cross. If not, definately
        after I've solved the cross I just give it a z2 and solve F2L cross on
        bottom. I WISH I could do an extended cross in 15 secs. Only very rarely
        but it REALLY helps me when I do do it. Obviously I can always do it
        given enough pre-inspection but that doesn't really help much now, does
        it? I can only dream of how fast a double extended cross must be but it
        is way beyond my pre-inspection time. ANYWAYS - as for 'OFF COLOUR'
        CROSSES I remember that the 100th Japonese contest ran a wicked cool
        event. Best average of 7 solves. The first 6 solves each had a different
        mandatory cross colour and the 7th was solver's choice. It produced some
        very interesting stats. Some cubers had practically no difference at all
        between favourite and off colous while other cubers had huge
        discrepencies between colours. Hopefully you can still find the results
        online. You would find it very interesting. I actually have them on my
        computer, but I am not on my computer right now as I am (still) waiting
        for my new connection to be set up. Perhaps Masayuki could help out with
        the stats and some insights on 'off colour' solves. I thought that it
        was a very cool variation to throw into the contest (though I fear I
        would fare rather poorly if I tried to solve off colour) Chris'
        compromise might well work. I too solve 4 x4 and 5x5 centers starting
        with opposites according the best lie of the land. But then again
        centers on big cubes are a different ballgame from F2L pairs and after I
        have united all the centers I immediately shift to white cross on bottom
        for the 3x3 stage of the solve. (unless I am doing a Masayuki style
        solve which is totally different) Just my 2 cents Can$ = 1 .2 cents US$
        = 1 pence = ?Euro Rob

        I only recently (2-3 months ago) decided to pick a colour having always
        used the inspection time to choose a face that was easy to start on. As
        I'm now about 10 seconds faster than I was then I might go back and try
        it again. I certainly found moving to always starting with yellow

        two opposite pairs, but I usually don't notice &gt; them, &gt; &gt;
        especially given only 15 seconds of inspection. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A
        good setup that seems to catch my eye is if you can, in very few &gt;
        &gt; moves, form a 1x2x3 block out of any pieces. If you can, try to
        &gt; &gt; find a way to insert the other two edges such as to create a
        full &gt; &gt; 2x2x3. If you can notice that too, try to follow the
        other edge &gt; &gt; around for your solution and see at which point you
        can change &gt; your &gt; &gt; regular solution (if necessary) to make
        that very last edge easy &gt; to &gt; &gt; insert into its position.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------ &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So anyway I just wanted
        to say that I have started to consider &gt; &gt; double Xcross solves as
        something that isn't impossible to notice &gt; in &gt; &gt; 15 seconds
        and still execute succesfully. It would probably come &gt; up &gt; &gt;
        very rarely, for me tonight it was only maybe 2-3% out of all my &gt;
        &gt; speedsolve attempts, but when it does come up it helps your times
        &gt; &gt; sooo much. Both of my speedsolve double Xcrosses tonight were
        &gt; &gt; around 11-12 moves as far as I can remember, and I'm pretty
        sure &gt; &gt; both were on one of my "off" colors for the cross too.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So if anyone else is interested they seem to be more
        likely to &gt; occur &gt; &gt; on adjancet c/e pairs, and also don't be
        afraid to be color &gt; neutral &gt; &gt; when looking for one during
        the 15 seconds inspection. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hope this helps for
        anyone who has also considered trying a double &gt; &gt; Xcross strategy
        sometimes, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hmm ... It aint really so hard. it's much worse if u have a completely
        dismantled eastsheen 4x4x4 ;-) I guess that what u are struggling with
        is to get all the centers back in place? The trick there is to let 3 of
        the centers slide away and make space for the last one belonging to that
        particular face. There's a small cut where the last center should go!
        Slide the other 3 centers back. Here are the steps i use :(assuming it's
        completely disassembled) 1) Four centers of a face. Put the core w the 4
        centers down on a table w the 4 centers at the bottom. (a little tricky)
        2) Complete bottom layer. 8 edges and 4 corners. (easy) 3) Insert four
        centers on same face, next to the bottom layer. Insert them from top and
        slide down and rotate them in place. (a little tricky) 4) Place 4 edges
        around the centers from step 3. (easy) 5) Do 4 more centers adjacent to
        the centers from step 3. (a little tricky) Not the top ones. 6) Do 4
        more centers adjacent to the centers from step 3. (a little tricky) Not
        the top ones. 7) Do the last 4 edges belonging to the 2 middle layers.
        (easy) 8) Last 4 centers of middle layers. Same method as step 3. (a
        little tricky) 9) Last 4 centers. (a little tricky) 10) Rest of top
        apart from 2 adjacent edges. (a little tricky to place the edges) 11)
        Rotate top layer 45 degrees. Insert last 2 edges one by one. Voilâ !!
        Thats it!! -Per K PS! There are other possible ways too. ;-) &gt; --- In

      <br />
      <br />
      <div class="email-content">
        Okay, so I sat down with ACube and computed this list of F2L algs:
        http://www.aligulac.net/f2l.txt There are algs for all the standard F2L
        cases there, grouped according to how I recognize them (if you can't
        figure it out, do the inverse of an alg to see what it does, or just
        read my "recognition key" at the end of this post). I looked
        specifically for 2-generator solutions where they are possible and what
        I call "good" 3-generator solutions where 2-generator ones weren't
        possible. A "bad" 3-g algorithm uses 3 layers, where two are opposite
        one another. A "good" 3-g algorithm thus uses one and only one of the
        F,B layers, one and only one of the R,L layers and one and only one of
        the U,D layers. All algs are also mirrored in all possible ways, so that
        the list contains solutions for all cases from all angles. Meaning, it
        should be possible to solve the F2L in a (nearly) comfortable manner
        using this list without ever turning the cube around. Not rotating the
        cube is ONE advantage I see with this. The other is that - if you choose
        to always solve the F2L from a given cube state, i.e. always blue in
        front - you can instantly know where on the cube a pair should go when
        you see it. I.e. the green/orange pair always go in the BL slot. I agree
        that some of the algs are really awkward, I did try to avoid this. Most
        are doable though, but I selected those that were easy for _me_ to
        perform, and this may not be the case for you guys. I may expand this
        list some time in the future with alternative algs. Now, if you can't
        figure out what the "recognition" key means (and you probably can't, I
        guess), here's the explanation for the more cryptic phrases used: -
        Corner X: The D sticker of the corner is on the X face. - Corner X/Y:
        The D sticker of the corner is on the X or Y face. - Edge Match X/Y: By
        turning the U layer around, the edge sticker that is not on the U face
        matches the color of either the X or the Y center piece. - Separated:
        The pieces are separated in the U layer. - Edge Far: This one is a bit
        hard to explain. If you turn the U layer so that you are looking
        directly at the D-face colored sticker of the corner (i.e. the D-face
        colored sticker of the corner is on the F face), then if the edge is in
        the UB slot, it's "far away". - Edge Near: Similar to "Edge Far", except
        that the edge is in the UL or UR slot depending on wherever the corner
        is (UFR or UFL accordingly), i.e. the edge is "near", or at least nearer
        than when it's far. :) - Opposite: The stickers of the corner and the
        edge that are on the U face have different colors. - Same: The stickers
        of the corner and the edge that are on the U face have same colors. -
        Winging: Best word I could think of. Basically it means that if you turn
        the U layer so that the C/E pair is in its "standard" position, with the
        corner directly over where it needs to go, then it's "winging" if the
        imaginary line that runs "through" the C/E pair extends to your right
        and left. I.e. if the corner is in UFR and the edge is in UF it's
        winging. - Piercing: Opposite of winging. If that imaginary ine extends
        to your back and forth, i.e. the corner is in UFR and the edge is in UR,
        then it's piercing. - Double: Somewhere on the 1x1x2 block that the C/E
        pair forms there are two adjacent stickers having the same color. -
        Single: Nowhere on that same 1x1x2 block the C/E pair forms are there
        two adjacent stickers having the same color. - FR/FL/BR/BL: Just choose
        the appropriate mirror. In case of sections 2, 4 and 5 the algorithms
        assume that you've turned the U layer to the standard position, meaning
        the corner is directly atop its target slot. This also means you must do
        the turn in the square brackets if you have this exact position. In
        section 3, the algorithm assumes that you've turned the U layer so that
        the edge "matches" one of the adjacent centers. I.e. for 3.1.1 (Edge
        match F/B) , the edge should either be in UF or UB depending on which
        center it matches. Hope this made any sense. If it didn't, just do the
        inverse of an alg from the solved state to clarify that my confusing
        recognition key means.

        I bet a corner twisted by itself when you were solving. That used to

        &gt; I bet a corner twisted by itself when you were solving. That used
        to &gt; happen all the time to me, until the cube just exploded. So in
        &gt; conclusion, I think it's time that you retire that cube, and start
        a &gt; new one. Or use it for one-handed cubing as Chris would probably
        suggest...

        No, really... The same phenomenon is documented with several other
        practices, and cubing is not an exception. It is a psychological
        (pedagogical??) fact that constant practice yields worse results than
        practice with timely breaks. --- In

        Just assembled my first of the new DIY kits from Rubiks.com and thought
        I would share. Overall, I guess I was pretty impressed. Immediately
        after assembly, it became one of the best cubes I have. They DO have the
        arched centers and come with both pins and screws. The screws have a
        tight thread which allow for finer adjustments. I tightened them in as
        deep as they would go and the cube was still a bit looser than I would
        like. However, the springs seemed pretty good so it turns very nice and
        feels light. I only had a little trouble with the end caps. I hesitated
        on super- gluing them as then they may be too hard to get off to adjust
        the screws later. I have great trouble removing the caps from older
        cubes so I could use some advice on this... I was most impressed with
        their lubrication. I've only used generic silicon spray othewise, but
        this stuff was great. It's liquid so it's a bit messy, but certainly
        worth it. I still haven't tried that KY liquid as I heard that was just
        as good though. Anyway, I'm not much of a cube doctor so I'm not sure
        what is good or not, but overall I liked it. I'm sure it takes some
        practice to get things just right. -Howard

        About center caps, I just bang the edges with the back of a hammer as
        recommended on Ton's site. It works really well. I thought I heard that
        the rubiks.com lube wasn't very good a while ago. I am wondering about
        it now. Does anyone know what it is (ingredients)? Any other experiences
        using it compared to silicon? I think I will buy a DIY kit soon - It's
        sounds good.... except those horrible stickers...Are the PVC ones much

        Yes, it is possible. Your club needs to have at least 7 members. If you
        are going to hold an official tournament, we ask that one of the WCA
        board members be present so that everything can be regulated.
        Furthermore, we ask that you hold one unofficial tournament first just
        so we can see you know what you're doing. In order to get started, just
        hold an unofficial tournament. I think you're pretty close to Pasadena
        so let me know. If all goes well, then you should be able to hold
        official tournaments. We do this because we don't want disorganized

        &gt; &gt; Let me see if understand the notation. Do you mean solving
        using a &gt; combination of rU and ru macros? Or do you mean the group
        generated by &gt; &lt;r,u,U&gt;? Sorry if I'm not clear enough, I was
        asking for 2 different things: - How to solve in &lt;r,U&gt; ? As I
        said: "But I was trying to scramble a cube with U and r moves, and I
        realized that it looks completely different and I have no idea about how
        to solve it with U and r exclusively." - How to solve in &lt;r,u&gt; ?

        It seems you have looked at all possible changes of orientation which
        preserve the permutation. I was looking at all possible orientation
        changes ignoring the permutation completely. Anyway, it means that if we
        are to find some position that needs more than 20 moves (htm), it must
        have some pieces not in their home locations. Jaap

        There is only one day of the year where one can leave the drudgery of
        Caltech academic life and sprint off for a chili burger, chili dog, and
        chili fries in a timely manner. A very timely manner indeed... so timely
        that one can actually return before he departs. This is the way of the
        Negative-Time Tommy's run. On one day of the year, a little bit before
        the first 2 AM, Caltech students hope in their cars and make a dash for
        the originally Tommy's in Beverly Hills for some items with a lot of
        chili. The goal is to simply return before you left. If you are skilled,
        you may attempt the trifecta which consists of the burger with extra
        chili, the hot dog with extra chili, and the fries with extra chili.
        Last year, I missed achieving negative time because of an accident on
        Highway 101. Our total time was 4 minutes. Of course, last year, I did
        achieve negative time cubing at a time of negative 59 minutes and 1
        second. (I was not very fast back then.) I challenge all of you to take
        part in the negative time solving tradition. We will have a website with
        the one, yes only ONE scramble which you will use for this entire year.
        The date I believe will be October 31, 2004.

        me to do so myself but there's only 20,160 orientation preserving corner
        permutations (i.e. 8!/2 - because the edges are fixed). Combining those
        with the orientations would be feasible in terms of trying to get a good
        upper bound for this groups (if taken on in some GIMPS (Great Internet
        Mersenne Prime Search) type of project). As I recall the corner
        permutation subgroup (orientation-preserving) has diameter 18. Far more
        difficult (just over 10,000 times so) would be instead to combine with
        edge permutations. If that subgroup turned out to have diameter 20 or
        less then I think this would lower the upper bound for the whole group
        (as I am fairly sure that the corners can be placed (without regard to
        edge permutation or any orientation) in 7 moves (and 20+7+1=28&lt;29).
        (Unfortunately, having to click each cube takes a lot more work than the
        GIMPS, but it seems like it could be achievable.)

        Then we'd be able to find a,b with as+bt=1 so r^t=R^{bt^2} and again
        there are c,d with cs+dbt^2=1 so r^{td}=R would imply &lt;R&gt; was in
        &lt;r&gt; and then clearly &lt;M&gt; would be in &lt;R&gt; too.Since R
        and M do not have coprime orders then r^t=R^tM^t can only equal R if
        R^{t-1}=M^{-t} but as &lt;R&gt; and &lt;M&gt; intersect only in &lt;&gt;
        then we'd need that the order of R divides t-1 and that of M divides t.
        Any common factor would then have to divide 1.)

        This is probably slightly off topic from what you guys are talking
        about, but I was curious to ask. Is there a special name or general type
        of subgroup that would explain or relate to the 86 total positions on
        the cube where every piece is in its correct location, but none have the
        correct orientation? I get that number by saying that the edges are
        forced to be in the superflip position, and all the corners must be
        twisted. In order to keep the sum of the orientations equal to 0 mod 3
        for the corners, then you have to have either 7 corners flipped one
        direction and 1 the other direction, or you have to have 4 corners
        flipped one direction while the other four are flipped the other way.
        This gives you 8*2=16 positions where one corners is flipped differently
        from all the other corners. There are then 70 positions where four
        corners are flipped one way and 4 flipped the other way (8 choose 4
        basically). I know these positions don't belong as part of the center of
        the cube group, since that is only the solved state and the superflip
        state. However, I still think this group is quite interesting, namely
        because it a group with a specific set of properties, yet is so small
        compared to the total number of combinations to the cube. If this group
        has no real apllication to anything on the cube, I still think it is
        interesting. Namely, how many moves does it take to reach any of those
        86 states? Are they including in your statement when you say the
        orientation group only has diameter 20 moves HTM? That might be a stupid
        question, but to be honest I'm not following the discussion you guys are
        having 100% This concept of having every piece in the correct location
        but flipped seems to work only for the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3. You could flip
        all the corners of an even nxnxn cub n&gt;3, or the corners and
        middlemost edges of an odd nxnxn cube n&gt;4, but that doesn't seem that
        interesting. Also, for the 3x3x3 supercube there would be
        86*[2^6+15*2^4+15*2^2+1] = 31 390 positions where all the pieces are in
        the correct spot but none have the correct orientation (including the
        orientations of the centers). So yeah, are these positions interesting
        mathematically at all, or do they not really serve any purpose? Are they
        all the outliers of the orientation group? Meaning does it take more
        moves to reach one of these states than most of the other orientation
        cases? Just some questions from me, Chris --- In

        you have looked at all possible changes &gt; of &gt; &gt; orientation
        which preserve the permutation. I was looking at all &gt; &gt; possible
        orientation changes ignoring the permutation completely. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Anyway, it means that if we are to find some position that needs
        &gt; more &gt; &gt; than 20 moves (htm), it must have some pieces not in
        their home &gt; &gt; locations. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jaap &gt; &gt; Yes,
        that's right. It's probably beyond me to do so myself but &gt; there's
        only 20,160 orientation preserving corner permutations (i.e. &gt; 8!/2 -
        because the edges are fixed). Combining those with the &gt; orientations
        would be feasible in terms of trying to get a good upper &gt; bound for
        this groups (if taken on in some GIMPS (Great Internet &gt; Mersenne
        Prime Search) type of project). &gt; As I recall the corner permutation
        subgroup (orientation- preserving) &gt; has diameter 18. Far more
        difficult (just over 10,000 times so) would &gt; be instead to combine
        with edge permutations. If that subgroup turned &gt; out to have
        diameter 20 or less then I think this would lower the &gt; upper bound
        for the whole group (as I am fairly sure that the corners &gt; can be
        placed (without regard to edge permutation or any orientation) &gt; in 7
        moves (and 20+7+1=28&lt;29). &gt; (Unfortunately, having to click each
        cube takes a lot more work than &gt; the GIMPS, but it seems like it
        could be achievable.)

        they are really the most difficult ones, I don't know. Maybe Richard can
        look it up in his list. Jaap

        I'm not sure if solving a 2x2x3 directly everytime would be the fastest
        way. I'm sure sometimes you could plan the whole thing, but I think it
        would be very rare. I think what would be more realistic for that step
        would be to always plan a 2x2x2, then build a 2x2x1 onto it, just as
        Lars Petrus does it. Also that method idea sounds like it might be a
        step beyond just the normal ZB method by itself. It seems though that to
        solve the 2x2x1 after the initial 2x2x3 would take a lot of algs, 4
        pieces and a lot of freedom of movement, I'm guessing over a hundred at
        least? I think that would be possible for someone who learned all of ZB
        and got bored with it just by itself, but I think ZB would have to be
        attainable first in order for this method to be possible. This brings up
        an interesting point. It seems that for the fastest methods that one day
        there will be very few intuitive steps, since algs can be performed at 4
        moves/second or more, while intuitive steps hardly ever get that fast of
        a turning speed. It's like learning CLL then trying the 2x2x2. Honestly
        I think it's pretty cool to always get fast times on the 2x2x2 now using
        CLL, but it makes the puzzle kinda boring since you just intuitively
        place the first four corners in a couple moves, do an alg, then you're
        done. If people learn 3x3x3 methods with lots of algs like this (the
        Gary Kasparov of cubing so to speak) I wonder if the faster times would
        be worth the lesser fun I guess you could call it. Chris --- In

        alg, then you're &gt; done. &gt; &gt; If people learn 3x3x3 methods with
        lots of algs like this (the Gary &gt; Kasparov of cubing so to speak) I

        you could call it. &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; Lesser fun - but didn't you say
        you'd be tempted to count the slices in a 4x4x4 scramble (assuming you
        knew what the scramble was) to go that little bit faster?

        from what you guys are talking &gt; about, but I was curious to ask.
        &gt; &gt; Is there a special name or general type of subgroup that would
        &gt; explain or relate to the 86 total positions on the cube where every
        &gt; piece is in its correct location, but none have the correct &gt;
        orientation? &gt; It can't be a subgroup - by definition a subgroup has
        to contain the identity (and that can't satisfy the condition of things
        being incorrectly oriented). What you're looking at is the intersection
        of the complements (or the complement of the union) of the stabilizers,
        in the orientation subgroup, of each piece. Thus, for instance, in the
        orientation subgroup (where there's no permutation, only orientations),
        the stabilizer of the UF edge will be the subgroup which fixes the UF
        edge (i.e. keeps its orientation correct). This is clearly a subgroup
        and its complement is clearly the set which flips that edge.
        Intersecting the complements of the stabilizers of each edge and of each
        corner we get the subset to which you refer. &gt; I get that number by
        saying that the edges are forced to be in the &gt; superflip position,
        and all the corners must be twisted. In order &gt; to keep the sum of
        the orientations equal to 0 mod 3 for the &gt; corners, then you have to
        have either 7 corners flipped one &gt; direction and 1 the other
        direction, or you have to have 4 corners &gt; flipped one direction
        while the other four are flipped the other way. &gt; That's the correct
        number. &gt; This gives you 8*2=16 positions where one corners is
        flipped &gt; differently from all the other corners. There are then 70
        positions &gt; where four corners are flipped one way and 4 flipped the
        other way &gt; (8 choose 4 basically). &gt; &gt; I know these positions
        don't belong as part of the center of the &gt; cube group, since that is
        only the solved state and the superflip &gt; state. There are other
        easier ways to see this too - in fact the center is just the subgroup of
        elements that commute with everything in the group. It is trivial to see
        that no element can change the orientation of any of the corners (if it
        did then conjugation would imply they all have to be changed the same
        way but neither 8 nor 16 is congruent to 0 mod 3) or indeed that if it
        flips an edge it must flip them all - again use conjugation. Similarly
        it's easy to show that it must fix all the pieces in place - conjugate
        with some intersecting but distinct permutation to see this) and also to
        see that the superflip is in the centre. &gt;owever, I still think this
        group is quite interesting, It's not really a group though. &gt; namely
        because it a group with a specific set of properties, yet is &gt; so
        small compared to the total number of combinations to the cube. Then
        again, so is &lt;R&gt; and it's even smaller - it has only 4 elements.
        &gt; &gt; If this group has no real apllication to anything on the cube,
        I &gt; still think it is interesting. Namely, how many moves does it
        take &gt; to reach any of those 86 states? Are they including in your
        &gt; statement when you say the orientation group only has diameter 20
        &gt; moves HTM? That might be a stupid question, but to be honest I'm
        &gt; not following the discussion you guys are having 100% I haven't
        optimized all the ones involving superflip yet, but I did a few of them
        some time ago - don't have them to hand right now. In the orientation
        group, the moves that superflip on the edges have length at least 16 and
        at most 20 (HTM). There are only 66 equivalence classes in total but
        most of them take a lot of moves. Several took 19 moves and there may
        have been more than just the actual superflip that took 20. I know that
        there were some that I wasn't able to put the machine on for long enough
        to decide but which I hadn't been able to get to under 20 - but that's
        not to say that they were of length 20. There were definitely several of
        length 19 (though whether they were in your particular set I couldn't
        say). &gt; &gt; This concept of having every piece in the correct
        location but &gt; flipped seems to work only for the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3.
        You could flip &gt; all the corners of an even nxnxn cub n&gt;3, or the
        corners and &gt; middlemost edges of an odd nxnxn cube n&gt;4, but that
        doesn't seem &gt; that interesting. Well that's true (that these are the
        only pieces that can be flipped in place - except as you describe below
        the very central pieces on an odd nxnxn cube). Of course, the number of
        moves required to solve might vary in these other cubes - the moves to
        flip a middle edge in an odd size cube will not mirror the ones in a
        3x3x3 cube, because of having to preserve the outer edges etc. &gt; &gt;
        Also, for the 3x3x3 supercube there would be &gt;
        86*[2^6+15*2^4+15*2^2+1] = 31 390 positions where all the pieces are
        &gt; in the correct spot but none have the correct orientation
        (including &gt; the orientations of the centers). &gt; &gt; So yeah, are
        these positions interesting mathematically at all, or &gt; do they not
        really serve any purpose? Are they all the outliers of &gt; the
        orientation group? Meaning does it take more moves to reach one &gt; of
        these states than most of the other orientation cases? &gt; &gt; Just
        some questions from me, &gt; Chris Well, most of the orientation moves
        that involve superflipping the edges (regardless of whether they twist
        the corners) are quite long (in the sense of 18-20) but, then again, I
        don't know how many of the others in the orientation group take close to
        20 moves. When I got the 20 result it was mainly because I cast aside
        optimization for a while and just decided to try and get an upper bound
        (and since I already knew there to be one element requiring 20 I often
        didn't try to go below that). It's very unlikely that the list I have
        comprises only optimal solutions (in this regard), although I guess it
        might technically be possible, but there were a lot of things that were
        still at 20, so it's difficult to answer your question fully at the
        moment. Like I said at the start of this paragraph though, most of the
        orientations where superflipping is involved take 18 moves or more. I
        calculated somewhat more than the minimum number needed to work out the
        diameter of the orientation group (although far less than the total
        number in the group), but I've only optimized a few at the moment -
        probably less than 100,000 (or maybe 200,000) once I take the various
        isomorphisms into account. (In fact, of the 76 basic sets I started off
        looking at, I've only fully optimized two of them - I did both them out
        in full, rather than being clever about it and skipping some steps - so
        far.)

        Hi! No there is no need to take the 4x4x4 cube completely apart. Exactly
        how u should do it depends on which kind of cube u have got. For now i
        will assume u have the "normal" cube and not the Eastsheen / Minicube
        variety. What u need to do is carefully pop out an edge pair. Do this by
        turning a layer about 45 degrees, end then pop them out carefully with a
        knife or similar. Now spray inside with silicone spray. Now put the
        edges back. If u want u can pop a few other edgepairs and do the same.
        With the cube fully assembled again u can make sure the silicone spreads
        all around inside by "scrambling" it. Leave the cube for about 15
        minutes and do some more scrambling. After 1 hr u can do more
        scrambling. U only need to do that for about 15-20 secs. Now i would
        wait for about half a day before i used the cube normally again. For a
        "normal" 4x4x4 any silicone spray would be fine. However i have some bad
        experience with eastsheen 4x4x4 and petroleum-based silicone. So for
        that kinda cube make sure u read the contents on the bottle carefully
        before u buy it. Make sure it has no petroleum. Petroleum-based silicone
        will never really completely dry inside the cube. But the petroleum-free
        silicone will leave a dry white "film" inside. I hope this helps :-)
        -Per K PS! For the eastsheen variety u need to remove the 4 centercaps
        of a face and unscrew and remove the "lock" beneath them. Then spray
        slightly inside and put averything back together again. Repeat on a few
        more faces if desired. Not much silicone is needed for a good result.

        What I'm trying to say is unless you want your cube to fall apart every
        second of every timed session you do, don't lube. 4x4x4s are pretty

        If you want a whole cube entirely in black and white, the only thing I
        can think of is to paint patterns instead. E.g.: - Solid white - Solid

        5x5, especially if your can has a neat little plastic pipe thingy, like
        mine. Just pull two pieces apart a bit and squirt some into it. Do this

        I've actually found lubing my 4x4 is quite rewarding. While it is
        difficult to reassemble afterwards, upon completion of a full lubing job
        I've been happy with the results every time. It is true that some 4x4s

        &gt; orientation? &gt; &gt; That set of positions is not a (sub)group -
        the word group has a &gt; precise mathematical meaning and this set does
        not qualify. &gt; (It is not closed since performing the algs for any
        two of them will &gt; give a position that is not in that set). &gt;
        &gt; If you allow for rotations and mirror images of the whole cube,
        there &gt; are far fewer than 86 positions. &gt; &gt; &gt; Namely, how
        many moves does it take &gt; &gt; to reach any of those 86 states? Are
        they including in your &gt; &gt; statement when you say the orientation
        group only has diameter 20 &gt; &gt; moves HTM? &gt; &gt; Yes, they are
        included. All positions where none of the pieces are &gt; moved, but
        some (or even all) are flipped or twisted, were included. &gt; &gt;
        Richard told me he did not actually check all 4 million positions, &gt;
        but reduced the number by taking most cube rotations etc into &gt;
        account, leaving 166212 positions to be checked. Not sure where you get
        the 166,212 from - the actual number is not so high. It is, in fact,
        only 94,518. There are 76 possible edge orientations up to isomorphism.
        We can pick a set of equivalence class representatives. For any
        orientation of edges X and of corners Y, we can use the isomorphism
        sending X to it's equivalence class representative X1, say, (which will
        send Y to some other corner orientation Z). Thus (the orientation (X,Y)
        is isomorphic to (X1,Z). Clearly, if X1 and X2 are representatives of
        different equivalence class then for any corner orientations S,T (X1,S)
        cannot be isomorphic to (X2,T). But it is possible that (X1,V) might be
        isomorphic to (X1,W) where V is not W. Fining a complete set of
        equivalence class representatives for each set {(X1,Y):Y is a corner
        orientation} (where X1 is fixed) for each edge equivalence class
        representative will get us a set of equivalence class representatives
        for the whole orientation group. (So we basically look at each of the 76
        sets of size 2187 and find out how many non-isomorphic positions there
        are.) We find the number of classes for the 76 different possibilities
        to be
        66,1107,1098,594,2187,2187,300,306,2187,2187,1107,2187,2187,1098,1134
        ,1134,2187,1107,1098,2187,168,1107,1098,306,2187,2187,594,576,1107,21
        87,576,2187,1098,2187,2187,2187,2187,594,2187,594,1107,2187,2187,2187
        ,168,558,2187,2187,567,1107,576,204,1098,576,204,1098,1134,576,1107,1
        107,306,1134,747,1134,1134,2187,306,2187,2187,300,2187,576,594,1107,1
        098,66. (That should total 94,518 if I haven't typed incorrectly.) The
        corresponding 76 edge permutation isomorphism classes have respectively
        1,24,24,12,48,48,6,6,48,48,24,48,48,24,24,24,48,24,24,48,3,24,24,6,48
        ,48,12,12,24,48,12,48,24,48,48,48,48,12,48,12,24,48,48,48,3,12,48,48,
        12,24,12,4,24,12,4,24,24,12,24,24,6,24,16,24,24,48,6,48,48,6,48,12,12
        ,24,24,1 members (totalling 2048 members - i.e. the 2048 edge
        permutations). I didn't really use anything complicated to get this -
        having got the 2048 and 2187 edge and corner permutations you can put
        the edges trough Cube Explorer to get the 76 classes (although stupidly
        I went on to optimize them all individually instead of utilizing the
        isomorphism, exvept for the superflip as that optimization was already
        in the literature) and then for each of those concatenate with the 2187
        corner orientations and pass each resulting set of 2187 through Cube
        Explorer to get the 76 sets of representatives of the various sizes
        above (the union of these being a full set of representatives). I'm not
        sure how many members the 94,518 classes have - but most will have the
        full 48 members because the average must be 2048*2187/94518 which is
        47.38755. In fact since each equivalence class has n members where n
        divides 48 and since at least 2 of the classes have just 1 member and
        since 92106*48+2412*24=94518 and 93312*48=2187*2048 we can conclude that
        more than 92106 classes but less than 93312 classes have 48 members.
        Probably it's possible to easily tighten this somewhat, but I don't
        really want to consider it at the moment. &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, for the
        3x3x3 supercube there would be &gt; &gt; 86*[2^6+15*2^4+15*2^2+1] = 31
        390 positions where all the pieces &gt; &gt; are in the correct spot but
        none have the correct orientation &gt; &gt; (including the orientations
        of the centers). &gt; &gt; I agree with that figure. There has been very
        little work done on the &gt; supergroup &gt; &gt; &gt; So yeah, are
        these positions interesting mathematically at all, or &gt; &gt; do they
        not really serve any purpose? Are they all the outliers of &gt; &gt; the
        orientation group? Meaning does it take more moves to reach &gt; &gt;
        one of these states than most of the other orientation cases? &gt; &gt;
        Such positions are only interesting in that they are (or were) prime
        &gt; candidates for needing more than 20 moves, but whether they are
        &gt; really the most difficult ones, I don't know. Maybe Richard can
        look &gt; it up in his list. &gt; &gt; Jaap

        Hey Evan, I assume you will be switching the yellow and blue faces? If
        that's not how your cube is set up then this should work anyway. I got a
        giant cube a while ago but the color scheme was not what I was used to
        (two of the colors were switched) so I retiled it. I've never retiled a
        deluxe, but I guess it should work the same way. Basically what I used
        were an Xacto knife, small hand held power sander, and superglue to do
        it. A big discussion came up a while ago on sticker switching theory, so
        to switch two faces you will only need to pry off 10 tiles in total,
        though you may also have to dissassemble your cube some. If you are
        switching two adjacent faces, I assume this is the case, then turn your
        cube around so those two faces are F and R. Now switch the following
        pairs of tiles: A tile will be defined by describing the piece, but
        putting parenthesis around the actual sticker. So (U)FR would be the U
        tile of the UFR corner. Ok so switch: (U)FR &lt;-&gt; (D)FR F center
        tile &lt;-&gt; R center tile (F)UL &lt;-&gt; (R)UB (F)L &lt;-&gt; (R)B
        (F)DL &lt;-&gt; (R)DB Now by disassembling your cube take out the entire
        FR row and flip it, then put it back in. Now your cube is again
        solvable, and has the new color scheme. -------- As far as the practical
        aspect goes, what I did with my cube was to pry the tiles off by slowly
        and repeatedly cutting at the point where the tile is glued to the
        corner. You have to sort of saw at it from all 4 sides (it's good to
        take the piece out of the cube to give you more room to move it around).
        Try to do this gently, because when a piece comes off it usually pops
        off suddenly and forcefully, often breaking off a small piece of the
        center of the tile (on the bottom side so you usually won't notice the
        effects of it on the tile). Once you get all the tiles off take either
        some sandpaper or a small power sander and sand off the pieces of tile
        still stuck to each corner and edge cubie. Once you've done that you can
        just glue the tiles back on like above. ------------ If you have to swap
        two opposite faces (say they are F and B), then just switch the F and B
        face stickers of the four corners, as well as the center pieces of each
        face. No disassembly required here. Hope this helps some, Chris --- In

        I doubt the webcam feature with Cube Explorer is in heavy use. Just
        input the cube configuration like you normally would, with the mouse you
        know. It would probably be a lot easier than to hustle around with

        Hey! If u gonna practice for competition don't bother about the

        silicone for these cubes. Lube once and then once more again a week
        later. But u better practice with them for a few weeks before doing so.
        Breaks in better that way :-) And if u get a 5x5x5 where u can adjust
        the screws then tighten them slightly in order to break in faster. U can
        also use that trick for 3x3x3 studio cubes ;-) Just before lubing adjust

        Hey, thanks. I've lubed my professor's cube, and it's ok, but i hear
        that you can better results with other cubes. There are two types of

        Hey! As long as the competition will be sponsored by Seventowns,
        worldwide distributors of puzzles under the Rubiks brand, the
        eastsheen/minicube (s) wont be allowed. This is because there is a
        copyright dispute between seventowns and the manufacturer of the
        eastsheen. So that whole matter has to do with money/politics. This is
        actually something that the up and coming WCA, world cubing association,
        should look into. Me and many others firmly believe that all kinda cubes
        should be allowed in competition as long as it's not made for cheating,
        with motors or flashing hints or whatever ;-) Some do prefer eastsheen
        for their smoothness. Some prefer rubiks.com cause its more forgiving
        with misalignment. It is well known that the eastsheens do lock quite a
        lot. How bad this is depends on ur technique. I used to prefer the
        eastsheen varieties, But also besides their locking i find they do
        actually pop quite a lot after weeks of heavy usage. And unlike
        rubiks.com cubes when they do pop they can pop really badly, lots of
        cubicles all over the floor ;-) As far as i can see, at the moment
        mefferts sell only the minicube and the tiled variety which has (for me)
        an unusual colorscheme. How easy it is to swap the tiles i don't know.
        So unless u can borrow a cube and decide which one u like i would
        actually get both eastsheen and rubiks.com and see which one i like. If
        u can't afford both i would go for rubiks.com varieties. Because i think
        they should be more durable. And as u get really fast u will appreciate
        the forgiveness they have to misalignment :-) Good luck! -Per &gt; ---

        Hey! Step 1 is probably best left as an intuitive step. For step 2 it
        could be left intuitive. This is maybe not such a good idea for a
        beginner. To make this step tabular would require very extensive tables.
        So maybe break it up into several substeps? For step 3, if i understand
        correctly, u are gonna solve the DB edge and at the same time orient and
        position top layer corners. This should be in 2 steps. First the edge,
        then the corners. There are already tables for doing those corners :
        http://www.speedcubing.com/final_layer_corners.html Step 4 might
        possibly also be divided into 2 steps. First the edge of last layer.
        Then the remaining edges. For final layer edges there are already
        complete tables : http://rokumentai.akimoto3.com/GRSM-e4.htm A better
        idea is perhaps to (after the 2 1x2x3 blocks to simple do those 2
        remaining edges in one alg. (in order to complete f2l) Making up a
        complete table for this should not be so hard;-) Sorry if i mess too
        much with ur original idea :-) Best of luck!! -Per &gt; --- In

        Hi Per, I did *not* misunderstand you. I'm talking about the Rubik one,
        too! I don't have new rubiks.com 4x4s, but the four I have from the 80s
        all have a blue center piece with a sticker with something written on
        it. If you peel that sticker (just the sticker, not the piece) off,
        there's a screw under it (i.e. "inside" the cubie piece). Drive the
        screw out and you can take the top part of the center piece away. Then
        the two edges right next to it can be taken out without any force and
        then all other cubies follow... Are your Rubik's 4x4s different? Cheers!

        im wondering how this is done and &gt; if its safe to do. Any advice
        would be greatly apreciated. &gt; &gt; Thanks &gt; &gt; Evan Hi Evan, A
        lot of other cubes have tiles that lay flay like stickers, but the
        deluxe's tiles fit into a trough. When I was thinking about getting the
        tiles off the centers (not the edges or corners) so that I could adjust
        the screws it struck me that the more evenly I could apply pressure to
        the tile the better. I found a way to do this which works very well. I
        use a 5/8 inch wood chisel. (Note: wear work gloves and glasses for
        protection). The first time I did it I worked the chisel under the edge
        of one tile and then levered it gently up-and-down and left-and-right.
        It took about 5 minutes of gently rocking under each edge of the white
        center tile to get it off, but all the rest of the center tiles came off
        easily. It's important to work it fully under the edge first (straight
        in), and do not over-flex the tile. The glue will break a little at a
        time. There's a correct side and an incorrect side to do the prying on.
        And there are two ways to tell the proper side to try to lever up for
        the centers. For the other cubies you can tell once you get the tiles
        off one edge piece and one corner piece. If you already had a tile out -
        if you looked closely at the tile and the trough in the cubie it fits
        into, you would see that the underside of the tile has two straight
        edges across from one another, and two sloped edges also across from one
        another - and the straight edges and slopes fit neatly into straight and
        sloped sides in the trough. The glue is put on the sloped edges. You
        have to pry up the sloped edge. If you try to pry up the straight edge
        you are working against the structure of the piece and it can break.
        Sometime you can tell the sloped edges of the tile from the top because
        of small indentations. The other way to tell going by the centers: if
        you look at the sides of the center cubies (the cubie itself, not the
        tile) you'll find three smooth sides and one side with a line on it. The
        side with a line has a straight edge (as does the opposite side) The two
        sloped edges are on the left and right. In other words, don't pry up the
        center cubie's tile from the side that has the line on it. I have one
        Deluxe which doesn't have these lines and I had to go by the
        indentations which are faint. When you reglue the tiles, do not use
        epoxy because you'll never get it off again. I use Elmer's glue. **
        Regarding which tiles to remove - in general you need to switch blue and
        yellow to change from the old "official" color scheme to the new
        "official" color scheme. Ive been using the old official scheme since I
        started and have no need to switch. Good Luck. David J

        Hey Stefan!! Aha!! I didn't know that. I have an old broken revenge at

        restickered it completely so i should know ;-) Don't u think it's

        Cube Explorer matter: &gt; &gt; &gt; when &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I switch

        the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; webcam, a window pops up saying that Cube
        Explorer has detected &gt; &gt; an &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; error so it has
        to be closed (then it asks you if you want to &gt; &gt; send &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; an error report to Microsoft). This happenned every time I
        tried &gt; &gt; &gt; it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you
        know why it happens? Does it happen to your computers &gt; too? &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; (the Cube Explorer version is the latest: 3.20). &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Sebastian &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's exactly what I have done, although
        I didn't mention the &gt; &gt; camera part (I have a normal camcorder
        which can also be a webcam), &gt; &gt; and he said he had no idea. He
        said I could try to change the &gt; &gt; hardware, so I'm asking you
        guys if you had the same symptoms. For &gt; &gt; the moment I can't
        change the camera, so....waiting for other &gt; &gt; messages. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Sebastian I was thinking that it doesn't matter if I can use
        other options for inputting the position, I just wanted to know if the
        mistake comes from my computer, my camera, Cube Explorer itself or
        whatever else could be. If a part of a program does not work, I suppose
        I should try to fix it, wouldn't I?

        Hi everyone I havent posted in ages but i think im back for a while have
        wanted to learn the Fridrich Method for about 4 years now and jsut
        havent had the dedication but i think I'm ready now. The problem i have
        is that i dont know where to start. my current methos is layer by layer
        with ll as PC OR PE OE. So yeah help to let me know what alg i should
        learn first would be great. Oh and i bought a cube on ebay and it has
        vynal stickers in good condition and was in a plastic cylinder with a
        sticker on the bottom that says Ideal 1980 made in hugary, it doesnt
        have a logo on it and im sure the sticker are factory since they jsut
        have that old "feel" to them if you know what i mean but not having a
        logo bothers me I'm sure Ton know what i have as long as its real im
        happy its really smooth i dont think that it has been lubed but it is
        possible. And one last think what should i do with the screws should i
        tighten them and play with it as much as i can before lubing or what i'm
        not sure its the first cube that ive had that has screws that can be
        ajusted. thanks in advace to everyone that replies!!!!

        Hey, I don't think thats what he's looking for. I believe that charles

        Blue=front Red=front Yellow=top do this Rr U2 Rr U2 R'r' L'l' B2 Ll D2
        Rr D2 R'r' that should give you a situation that you do know how to

        Peeling off the sticker isn't that bad. And at least on one of my cubes
        they have 2 stickers there, on top of each other. I'd be more worried
        about dis-/reassembling the cubie with the screw if I did it very often.
        However, only one of my four cubes is loose enough to pop edges without
        force, and I just don't like force, so that's why I don't do it your way

        !!!!!(long post)!!!!! Hi Sam, welcome back, I would personnally (notice
        the word personnally) recommend (if you really want to learn "the one
        and only" Fridrich method, and not some kind of VH or something in that
        direction) learning a few PLL's first, but as your current method is
        pretty different from Fridrich, I guess you'll have to learn a few OLL's
        too at the very beginning. So I think you can do it in the following
        order (of course it's up to you, you mustn't do it that way, but I think
        it's what would have worked best with me): 1st of all, learn all the
        PLLs that move only corners or only edges around. Of course start with
        the 3-cycles, so you can always solve every LL once it's oriented. Then
        I would recommend learning one case for orienting 2 opposite edges, 2
        adjacent edges, and 4 edges. I would learn the ones that only orient
        edges because I feel it helps me with recognition, since I know which
        corners I'll have to orient afterwards, but you can also learn algs that
        disturb corners, if you find them easier to remember. For instance when
        I get to a case where I have to orient 2 opposite edges, and the corners
        are all messed up, I prefer using RUR'U'M'URU'R' (M moves in the same
        direction as L) than FRUR'U'F' because I can plan my orientation of the
        corners while I'm doing it. And I know they are not going to move at
        all, while I don't know what would happen if I did the 2nd alg. But
        that's maybe just me. Once you get there, you know all the needed OLLs
        to orient the LL in 2 looks everytime (please stop me if I forgot
        something, but if I did forget something, the goal is a 2-look OLL, so
        you just have to add the eventual cases I forgot. However I don't think
        I forgot anything). Then finish learning the rest of the PLL's, starting
        with the weird cases first (the ones I was talking about before) if you
        haven't done it yet, then the rest of the possible cases. Ok, now let's
        talk about the F2L. One day when you have some free time, just sit down
        for a while, and solve the cross (wherever you want to hold the cross, I
        personnally prefer cross on the left, some like it on the bottom, or on
        the right if you're lefty, only please, not on the top!). Then look at
        any of the corners you want to solve first, find the corresponding edge
        and try to pair them up and insert them. Without doing it
        "layer-by-layer"-style. Just take some time to figure them and working
        them out once at a time (or 2 at a time with mirrors). It's ALWAYS
        better than learning algs from anywhere, no matter how good the alg is.
        You'll always be faster with "your" alg because you know how it works.
        Doug Reed wrote a page about the art of solving F2L intuitively, you can
        use it if you want but I'm sorry I forgot the URL. Doug? Ok, now you're
        maybe thinking it's going to take you a lot of time (it will indeed) to
        learn each and every alg, all the PLLs and the OLLs and finding the F2L
        cases by yourself, but lemme tell you what. I haven't figured (and don't
        intend to in the immediate future) a few of the F2L cases. I still don't
        know all the PLLs (yeah please Doug I hear you laughing at me). Not
        speaking of the OLLs. Some of them take me forever to solve, and the
        rest takes me twice as much. Do you know how fast I am? sub-20 (Doug
        shut up). So, don't be discouraged, it's maybe going to take a while,
        but I bet once you get passed the trouble of switching to another method
        (took me about one week to get used to the concept of "orient
        all-permute all"), you're going to improve very fast. Faster than you
        think. For the mental part of the thing, try to keep in mind the times
        you achieved the same day one week before. You'll find it pretty
        amazing. Just my (very long) 2 cents, François PS. btw, Sam, ever heard
        of the period key? it's somewhere near to the right shift button. You
        have kind of a longish style... Could replace lots of "and" with a
        simple period... Anyway. end !!!!!(long post)!!!!!

        improvements over the next weeks. Any comments feel free to let me know.
        Many thanks Duncan PS Here is the site address again. According to the

        Hey thanks a lot for that. I really appreciate the effort. So learn the
        PLL first right? I already use the 3 cycle edge to finish almost all the
        time. I just like the way it feels so i already got that. I'm just not
        sure if i want to have F2L on bottom or left since i have it on the top
        now thats just not gonna work lol. I'm just gonna see what feels right
        in a few days and start working on that. If I do have it on the left tho
        then I still have to rotate in in order to do the ll or not? Do you just
        learn the algs from the left side or what? Oh and about my run on typing
        thats how i think so i jsut kinda let it flow you know what i mean? My
        teachers get all on my case for that but you know its jsut how i am and
        im not a strong writer anyways math and sciece are my strong points. I
        would never even dream of writing for a living lol. I'm gonna end up
        with a degree in Electronic Engineering not Journalism. thanks again!

        In case you're someone who wants a new 12-color tiled megaminx, or just

        Mefferts.com just recently sent out one of their new product pre-release
        e-mails, and one of these puzzles is the 12-color tiled megaminx, which
        would sell for the normal megaminx price of $28 USD (free shipping). I
        don't have the e-mail with me at the moment, but it listed a URL that
        you could go to in order to indicate your interest in buying the puzzles
        (if someone else has and could post that URL, other people can go there,
        too). Assuming these tiles are the same as the old ones, they are good
        quality tiles, and add a great finished look to the puzzle. I sent Uwe
        Meffert a private e-mail, and he said that he would again be willing to
        sell the tile sets at cost for $12 USD, with their standard deal of free
        shipping everywhere. If you are interested in buying the tiles, but not
        the puzzle, I recommend you let him know that as well, since the

        Hi Grant, Thanks for the Megaminx tip. I had never even SEEN one before
        RWC Toronto and haven't ever come across one in any store. It looks like
        the kind of puzzle that I would just love. On a different topic: was
        that a Mefferts 5x5x5 that you (and I believe David) were using in
        Toronto? I remember it being noticably smaller with a distinctive light
        blue colour on one face. I just figured that if I was already going to
        order a megaminx I might as well pick up one of those 5x5x5 as well.
        Thanks, Rob

        Daniel Hello, This is the Great Fermat's theorem - it says that
        A^n+B^n=C^n is false for any n&gt;2, with of course A, B and C integers.
        I've read about it being proved - in I think 1996 - by Andrew Wiles, an
        English mathematician. The proof is very very complicated, with curves
        in space and so on. And he's surely the first to have proven it. There
        were some early proofs for special cases, but Wiles proved the general
        case. The case n=4 is really easy, I can do it, I haven't tried but I've
        seen the proof in an elementary mathematics book. Who wants to try?
        Sebastian

        I agree, that is a very good book describing the history of Fermat's
        last theorem and how it was proved. I definitely recommend it. As for
        the Riemann Hypothesis.... that stinks lol. Oh well, I've had math
        professors tell me that stuff like this happens all the time. Someone
        comes up with a proof, think it's right but then they missed something

        You are referring to Fermat's Last Theorem. It says that there are no
        integers x,y,z and n that satisfy: x^n +y^n = z^n for n&gt;2. It was
        proved about ten years ago by Andrew Wiles (sp?). The proof used many
        techniques from modern mathematics and was well over a hundred pages
        long, leaving may people to doubt whether or not Fermat truely
        discovered a proof (if he did it would almost certainly have been much

        &gt; Exciting times! &gt; &gt; Best, &gt; Daniel I wouldn't hold my
        breath if I were you. There's apparently a counter-example to his method
        (and which was known years before his paper too). Louis de Branges is
        apparently well-known for coming up with flawed proofs, although he
        actually did prove a big result called the Bierbach conjecture which has
        meant people need to take him more seriously than the average guy who
        has presented several flawed proofs. (Apparently for a long time his
        genuine proof wan't checked because of this reputation, but it seems
        safe to say that in the case of RH a counterexample to his technique is
        a fairly final way to end it.) On the other result mentioned in this
        thread, namely that if a^n+b^n=c^n where a,b,c, n are integers n&gt;=3
        then abc=0, Andrew Wiles' first attempted proof was flawed. Apparently
        the amended proof also had a flaw but this ws subsequently fixed - that
        latter information is less well known, but I have it on good authority
        from some number theory professors with whom I was at university when we
        were all grad students, I don't imagine the Riemann hypothesis will be
        resolved during my lifetime - it's already been considered one of the
        outstanding outstanding (!) problems in mathematics - but then again,
        the Poincare conjecture was done recently so who knows?

        Mefferts 5x5x5 that you (and I &gt; believe David) were using in
        Toronto? I remember it being &gt; noticably smaller with a distinctive
        light blue colour on one &gt; face. I just figured that if I was already
        going to order a &gt; megaminx I might as well pick up one of those
        5x5x5 as well. I like your attitude - you may as well!! :-P The 5x5x5 I
        used (and I believe you are right that David did as well) is one of two
        types of 5x5x5 cubes sold at mefferts. They sell one that is very
        similar (size, weight, and mechanics) to a Rubik's brand 5x5x5, and then
        they sell the EastSheen cube, which, as you noted, is smaller and has
        different shades of the standard colors. Vastly different, though, is
        the purple which takes the place of orange. These cubes may not turn as
        well as you would like at first (but then again, there were days when we
        didn't expect new puzzles to turn nicely right away), but just a little
        bit of lube, and they work wonderfully. Because they don't have any
        springs in them, they are less forgiving than their counterparts
        (therefore finger tricks are harder), but they move much more smoothly
        in general, and I dare-say will never pop (though it may be possible if
        you manage to leave a side inadequately tightened). They are much
        lighter in weight than the Rubik's variety and easier on the
        fingers/hands/wrists, and I highly recommend them. However, from past
        discussions, I don't know if these will be allowed in future "official"
        competitions... I'm a little bit behind on my reading, though, so I'm
        not sure if that conversation came to a different conclusion (or any
        conclusion at all). Just be sure that if this is the 5x5x5 you want, you
        get the "Mini Prof. Cube 6x6x6cm" Enjoy your new puzzles :-) - Grant

        speedcubing mention. Joey and his roommate were going out to a club and
        discussing "chatting up" type strategies. Joey asks what his roommate's
        hobbies are and he says physics, astronomy, and "cubing - people sharing
        methods to solve rubik's cubes" or something to that effect. The word
        speedcubing may have even come up. (sorry I don't have a more exact

        Hey!! I've been working on this program for quite a while now. It
        started when I printed out the ZB CEpair alg list. I noticed that the
        list wasn't complete, all the mirror cases were missing. I could apply
        the mirror case to the cube easily, but that still didn't make it any
        less annoying to me. This program now takes any algorithm (using
        definable notations) and can rotate it and mirror it to any of the 48
        possible symmetries, plus a couple of other fun functions (like slice
        and rotation removal or the quick input) It's still under construction,
        but I haven't had much time to complete it, and I don't think I will
        anytime soon. So I decided to post it and get it out in the open for
        people to use. It can be found at http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~tjfox/ (I
        hope my permissions work) Tell me what you think! TBTT Fox

        Gilles that video was awesome! I'll still never forget the video where
        you were cooking the cube and had it on the cutting board. Each time you
        hit the cube with the knife the camera showed pieces flying everywhere

        Thanks to some great work by Gustav Fredell I have been able to improve
        the L2L4 strategy significantly. The whole strategy looks much more
        viable now. After completing the top layer the four L2L steps take an
        average 38 moves. My own view is that 15 moves is an achievable average
        for the top layer making the whole strategy 53 moves. By coincidence the
        number of algorithms to learn is also 53. Not wanting to make too great
        a claim I would say that 17 moves for the top layer is easily achievable
        without any particularly special tricks so that a 55 move average solve
        is my worst case estimate for the method. I have updated the sites with
        the new L2L4 moves as well as 5 of Gustav's files that contain many
        alternatives that you may want to look at in order to optimise the
        choice of algorithms that suit you. Hope this all works and good luck to
        anyone who wants to try learning this method. Duncan

        Hey everyone, I have a question about teaching the cube using
        commutators, namely what is an easy way to get the method of using
        commutators for all the steps across to someone who is totally new to
        the cube? I read this website about 6 months ago
        http://www.mindspring.com/~alanh/rubikpuzzles.html which was one of the
        main stepping stones for me to really get a firm grasp of using
        commutators. I remember reading this site a few years ago as well, when
        I had just started the cube, and I remember finding it very confusing
        and I never really looked into it. I was thinking that a good, albeit
        slow, method of solving would be to teach someone a sighted version of
        the blindfolded method using only commutators. The reason I thought of
        this is that most of the people who I have taught how to do the cube
        have only wanted to learn how to do it and were not interested in speed
        solving. When I did teach them how to do it using relatively few
        algorithms I usually find that a few months later they don't remember
        how to solve the cube. I was thinking, if you teach only 1 concept,
        namely commutators, then people who just want to learn the solve the
        cube would only have to remember one thing, then they could achieve
        their goal of solving the cube. Also later on they would be less likely
        to forget how to solve it, since the commutator concept would be so
        ingrained in them from having used it so many times when they were
        learning to solve the cube. I'm kind of at a loss as to how to approach
        this method in a non- technical way though. Here is an example (I know
        this message is getting long, so I apologize): The corner flip move
        F'D2FLD2L' flips UFL counter clockwise, then you could turn U to put
        some other corner in UFL and do LD2L'F'D2F to flip it clockwise, then
        undo your U move to complete the commutator sequence and you've flipped
        two corners (yay). However I've tried to teach people this move many
        times, and in general I have a very hard time getting them to even
        remember to turn only the U face when trying to flip the next corner,
        rather than the whole cube. Also I have found that most don't understand
        how the alg itself actually flips the corner. So anyway I was thinking
        of approaching it like that site above does, saying the you have some
        algorithm X and some slice move s (not another algorithm, but just a
        slice or face turn) and that way you would simplify things a bit. But
        I've had so much trouble in the past trying to convey how this concept
        works, which I assume is also in part due to my failure to get the
        concept across well. So anyway I figured if several people work on this
        then we can probably come up with a good, clear, easy to remember way to
        teach commutators to beginners. That way the solving method would
        consist of 4 steps, same as in BLD cubing, namely permute all corners,
        permute all edges, orient all corners, orient all edges. I think it
        would be easiest to have both orientation steps at the end of the solve
        when all pieces are correctly permuted, but other than that there is a
        lot of freedom to this method. I admit that it would be slow, but people
        who don't have the motivation for speedcubing, only to solve it a few
        times and know how to solve it every time, would find it easy to
        remember. If anyone has read this far, thanks for reading and I would
        appreciate any help on this. Chris

        I think it's a bad idea to show a newbie how to solve the cube with
        commutators right from the beginning. At that point, they have no "feel"
        for how the cube works. I'd suggest to let them play with it a bit on
        their own first, telling them to achieve the goal of getting one face
        (not one layer). You can supervise them but should let them do it on
        their own. Then take the cube apart to show them they're dealing with
        pieces, not stickers, and that the centers don't move. Then let them
        solve the first layer, again on their own. They might solve the first
        face first and then permutate first layer pieces afterwards, but that's
        ok. My point is that this can all be done intuitively and it will give
        them a better feel for the cube and when they make a mistake then it's
        only at the start of a solve and they don't get sad because they don't
        lose much. Only afterwards I'd teach algorithms or commutators. Also, if
        they are at this point, they have already achieved positive goals which
        makes it more likely they won't give up. Also, less work is needed to
        finish solving so it's easier. Plus, they immediately see that something

        Hey! I can't see why it's so bad to teach beginners a "commutator
        framework" for solving the (3x3x3) cube. Just like some like tea and
        some like coffee, i believe ppl like different approaches to the cube.
        Some like to explore the cube by themselves and not to be tied up with
        any theory or guidelines from the outset. Whereas others will gain great
        insight by understanding pure commutators, 3-cycles, conjugated 3-cycles
        and so on. Well at least ppl will understand more of the cube by
        studying commutators than by learning fridrich with complete set of OLL
        and PLL and so on. Then again, some just wanna solve the d*** thing.
        Others wanna understand. If ppl wanna learn larger cubes after learning
        and mastering 3x3x3 i think they are much better equipped if they
        understand commutators inside/out. Then there would be nothing new to
        learn really. Maybe except the parity fix. If they on the other side
        however only know about fridrich (or an other "tabular method" for
        3x3x3) they would have to learn quite a lot of new stuff. First to fix
        the centers. Then how to pair up edges. Then it's back to the basic
        3x3x3 they know already. Well, anyway, im about to publish my
        "commutator way" of solving the 5x5x5 (and 4x4x4) cube. My approach
        makes it possible for a person with no previous knowledge of the 3x3x3
        (or 4x4x4 for that matter) cube to deal with solving that cube in a way
        that requires hardly any algorithms to memorise. For fair optimisation i
        use about maybe 10 algs that are not commutator-based. Teaching ppl how
        to solve the cube w commutators seems to me like a good idea. Sure,
        there is no replacement for learning it all by urself, like i did in
        1981. Those who don't manage that or wanna speed up the way to their
        first successful solve should have as many options of learning the
        cube(s) open to them :-) Happy commutating :-P -Per &gt; --- In

        first, telling them to achieve the goal of getting &gt; one face (not
        one layer). You can supervise them but should let them &gt; do it on

        with pieces, not stickers, and that the centers don't move. &gt; Then
        let them solve the first layer, again on their own. They might &gt;
        solve the first face first and then permutate first layer pieces &gt;
        afterwards, but that's ok. My point is that this can all be done &gt;
        intuitively and it will give them a better feel for the cube and when
        &gt; they make a mistake then it's only at the start of a solve and they
        &gt; don't get sad because they don't lose much. Only afterwards I'd
        teach &gt; algorithms or commutators. Also, if they are at this point,
        they have &gt; already achieved positive goals which makes it more
        likely they won't &gt; give up. Also, less work is needed to finish

        Hi Chris, I tell people "What you do to one, you undo to another." I
        also show them the right-handed algorithm R U R' U R U2 R' followed by
        the left-handed verion of the same algorithm L' U' L U' L' U2 L does the
        same thing as the commutator you gave. The sequence I use on the LL is
        Permute Corners, orient corners, orient edges, permute edges. I find it
        much easier to get the corners right then the edges. It just seems far
        easier to move the edges around with all the corners in place than vice
        versa. It might just be that I'm used to doing it that way. Regards,

        &lt;no_reply@y...&gt; wrote: &gt; Hey everyone, &gt; &gt; I have a
        question about teaching the cube using commutators, namely &gt; what is
        an easy way to get the method of using commutators for all &gt; the
        steps across to someone who is totally new to the cube? &gt; &gt; I read
        this website about 6 months ago &gt;
        http://www.mindspring.com/~alanh/rubikpuzzles.html &gt; &gt; which was
        one of the main stepping stones for me to really get a &gt; firm grasp
        of using commutators. I remember reading this site a few &gt; years ago
        as well, when I had just started the cube, and I remember &gt; finding
        it very confusing and I never really looked into it. &gt; &gt; I was
        thinking that a good, albeit slow, method of solving would be &gt; to
        teach someone a sighted version of the blindfolded method using &gt;
        only commutators. The reason I thought of this is that most of the &gt;
        people who I have taught how to do the cube have only wanted to &gt;
        learn how to do it and were not interested in speed solving. When I &gt;
        did teach them how to do it using relatively few algorithms I &gt;
        usually find that a few months later they don't remember how to &gt;
        solve the cube. &gt; &gt; I was thinking, if you teach only 1 concept,
        namely commutators, &gt; then people who just want to learn the solve
        the cube would only &gt; have to remember one thing, then they could
        achieve their goal of &gt; solving the cube. Also later on they would be
        less likely to forget &gt; how to solve it, since the commutator concept
        would be so ingrained &gt; in them from having used it so many times
        when they were learning to &gt; solve the cube. &gt; &gt; I'm kind of at
        a loss as to how to approach this method in a non- &gt; technical way
        though. &gt; &gt; Here is an example (I know this message is getting
        long, so I &gt; apologize): &gt; &gt; The corner flip move F'D2FLD2L'
        flips UFL counter clockwise, then &gt; you could turn U to put some
        other corner in UFL and do LD2L'F'D2F &gt; to flip it clockwise, then
        undo your U move to complete the &gt; commutator sequence and you've
        flipped two corners (yay). &gt; &gt; However I've tried to teach people
        this move many times, and in &gt; general I have a very hard time
        getting them to even remember to &gt; turn only the U face when trying
        to flip the next corner, rather &gt; than the whole cube. Also I have
        found that most don't understand &gt; how the alg itself actually flips
        the corner. &gt; &gt; So anyway I was thinking of approaching it like
        that site above &gt; does, saying the you have some algorithm X and some
        slice move s &gt; (not another algorithm, but just a slice or face turn)
        and that way &gt; you would simplify things a bit. But I've had so much
        trouble in &gt; the past trying to convey how this concept works, which
        I assume is &gt; also in part due to my failure to get the concept
        across well. &gt; &gt; So anyway I figured if several people work on
        this then we can &gt; probably come up with a good, clear, easy to
        remember way to teach &gt; commutators to beginners. &gt; &gt; That way
        the solving method would consist of 4 steps, same as in BLD &gt; cubing,
        namely permute all corners, permute all edges, orient all &gt; corners,
        orient all edges. &gt; &gt; I think it would be easiest to have both
        orientation steps at the &gt; end of the solve when all pieces are
        correctly permuted, but other &gt; than that there is a lot of freedom
        to this method. I admit that it &gt; would be slow, but people who don't
        have the motivation for &gt; speedcubing, only to solve it a few times
        and know how to solve it &gt; every time, would find it easy to
        remember. &gt; &gt; If anyone has read this far, thanks for reading and
        I would &gt; appreciate any help on this. &gt; &gt; Chris

        Hey Stefan :-) Yes, then i think i have misunderstood ur previous
        posting. Got the impression that it was a bad idea to teach beginners
        commutators at all, regardless which part of the cube or stage of
        solution. And in fact i think both u and me, and Gilles and Chris also,
        agree that showing first layer w commutators is a very bad idea. Not
        only is it very counterproductive to do so. A person, IMHO, will have no
        chance to master the cube if that person can't do the first layer on his
        or her own. The rest of the cube is a bit different cause u have to
        "destroy and restore again" in order to be productive. This is actually
        where most ppl trying the cube fail to be successful and to proceed.

        replacement for learning it all by urself, like i did in 1981. Those
        &gt; &gt; who don't manage that or wanna speed up the way to their first
        &gt; &gt; successful solve should have as many options of learning the
        cube (s) &gt; &gt; open to them :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy

        I have read many posts looking for the orange. Perhaps an electrical
        supply shop would be the place to start. At my former job, we got all
        our 3M brand electrical tape from a typical electrcian supply. They had
        just about every color you could think of including orange. The rolls
        are more expensive and much better quality than the typical home depot
        brand (although home depot does have this type as well). The tape also
        comes in a plastic container suitable for use to hold small screws, etc
        when working on a project. I use them to store rivets, and other such
        items in my tool box. The cost is minimal but far more than the 50 cents
        per roll you pay for the cheap home depot stuff. Related links. The
        colors. http://multimedia.mmm.com/mws/mediawebserver.dyn?

        speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        just purchased my second cube, (I have used my first one for &gt; &gt;
        about &gt; &gt; &gt; 2 months now, stickers are nearly clear now) So I
        finally felt &gt; &gt; safe &gt; &gt; &gt; to pop my first one open. So
        I removed my old stickers (what was &gt; &gt; &gt; left of them), and
        sanded down a few rough spots with some 600 &gt; &gt; grit, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; then some 1500 grit, and finally added some silicone spray and &gt;
        re - &gt; &gt; &gt; assembled. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would
        like to know where I can get some good stickers to put on &gt; &gt; &gt;
        my 'new' old cube? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen much
        improvement in its motion, but I was wondering &gt; if &gt; &gt; &gt;
        anyone had other suggestions for improving my cube &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Thanks alot, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Andrew &gt; &gt;

        hello everyone. i've tried to make a braille cube a couple times before,
        and really liked solving this way. but the cube never really lasted that
        long before the little dots started to fall off. i had little plastic
        "dots" (bought at a craft store), and i glued them all on one at a
        time...a side with one on each cubie, a side with two...like a die, but
        nothing on the side that would have six dots per cubie. anyway, i'm
        wondering what others have done that worked better. thanks

        Maybe it would work better with a giant cube (i.e. 9cm side lengths),

        Hi Grant and Chris, Thanks for the link to the Mefferts puzzle preview.
        As I mentionned before I have long been keen to get my hands on a 12
        colour megaminx. I followed the link and submitted an e-mail address as
        soon as the posting went up but I have not heard anything since. (more
        than a week) Any idea what is going on? Presumably they want to know the
        demand for quantities and that's why they are doing it this way but
        surely they will want to collect some money for it. Or am I doing it
        wrong? -- is the link not the final stage? Do I need to go through their
        website to select the puzzle in addition to indicating interest on the
        preview forum???? I just don't want to miss this opportunity to get a
        cool puzzle. I also remember from previous posts (6-8 months ago) that
        Mefferts was much faster with one payment method over another but I
        can't remember if Paypal was the fast way to go or if it was slow
        through Paypal but fast if directly charged to a credit card. Any hints
        on this question would also be very much appreciated. Thanks Rob --- In

        just recently sent out one of their new &gt; product &gt; &gt;
        pre-release e-mails, and one of these puzzles is the 12-color &gt; tiled
        &gt; &gt; megaminx, which would sell for the normal megaminx price of
        $28 &gt; USD &gt; &gt; (free shipping). I don't have the e-mail with me
        at the moment, &gt; but &gt; &gt; it listed a URL that you could go to
        in order to indicate your &gt; &gt; interest in buying the puzzles (if

        there, too). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Assuming these tiles are the same as
        the old ones, they are good &gt; &gt; quality tiles, and add a great
        finished look to the puzzle. I sent &gt; &gt; Uwe Meffert a private
        e-mail, and he said that he would again be &gt; &gt; willing to sell the
        tile sets at cost for $12 USD, with their &gt; &gt; standard deal of
        free shipping everywhere. If you are interested &gt; in &gt; &gt; buying
        the tiles, but not the puzzle, I recommend you let him know &gt; &gt;
        that as well, since the production of this puzzle is reliant upon &gt;
        &gt; there being sufficient demand to warrant the production run. You
        &gt; can &gt; &gt; contact him by e-mail at mefferts@h... (remove &gt;
        &gt; MEGAMINX from the address before sending). Enjoy!! &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I did a search in Google News for "rubik's cube" to see if there were
        any interesting cube articles. There was a long list, but many of the
        articles were not actually about cubes, they just happened to be using
        'Rubik's Cube' as a metaphor. Here's one that caught my attention: "It's
        a seven-sided Rubik's Cube, a problem with no solution." I didn't bother
        to read the article beyond this sentence because it clearly wasn't
        actually about cubes, but I thought it was interesting that cubes are so
        frequently used as metaphors. It also started me thinking about whether
        there is a seven-sided Rubiks-like puzzle (I couldn't think of one). If
        there is, it's obviously not a "cube" as the author of the article
        states. Perhaps the writer should have said "It's like a Rubik's Cube
        that's had a single edge reversed, a problem with no solution."
        Although, obviously there is a solution, which is to rip the piece out
        and fix it, but I think you know what I mean. ;) Jasmine

        There aren't any Platonic solids with 7 sides never mind cubes with 7
        sides. (The Platonic solids are the regular solids - there are 5 of them
        the cube is one and the octahedron, its dual, is another, the
        dodecahedron is one and the icosahedron, its dual, is another and the
        last is the tetrahedron, which is its own dual. The Megaminx is a
        dodecahedron, the pyraminx is a tetrahedron and the cube is a cube.)

        I love think Geek! If I had the money, pretty much all my clothes would
        come from there. I have one pi shirt already: "Got Milk, Need Pi" and
        then on the back it has many digits of pi in a circle. I also have one
        listing my favorite physics equations. I think I saw the Maxwell's
        equation shirt in the MIT bookstore (I was just visiting). Almost bought
        it myself. Talk about geeky though, the state fair is in town and they
        have lots of those Henna Tattoo places, and I was looking for something
        to get (my girlfriend really wants one and wants me to get one too). And
        I figure since it not permanent, what the heck. Well I stumbled across
        this site: http://www.bmezine.com/tattoo/geek001.html and now I have all
        kinds of ideas. No Rubik's cube themed ones though. Any artists willing
        to come up with a neat monochrome rubik's cube tat that I could take to
        the henna artist? I'd do it myself, but I have the artistic talent of an
        epileptic weasle. Thanks, Daniel (BTW, I did consider getting
        logarithmic scales on the insides of my forearms so I could use them as
        a slide rule... but that seems a bit cumbersome.) - In

        Does anyone know how to keep the center caps on the ney 3x3x3 DIY kits

        Hey! Myself i would definitely use superglue ... only 2 small drops is
        needed. Only glue at one edge. If the gap is big enough try with a
        narrow strip of paper between the cap and the center itself. Whether it
        should go the whole way around or only half way depends on the gap and
        the thickness of the paper. But superglue is simplest ;-) Just dont use
        it all the way round. -Per &gt; --- In

        Hey! At first use a sharp flat knife to scrape off any molding
        imperfections. Then lune the cube. Use quite a lot first time u lube it.
        There has been many posts how to do it so i won't go into detail. If the
        cube is still stiff/tight u can try with sandpaper. Or if possible
        adjust tension if your cube has adjustable screws. With one layer taken
        off the cube u should be able to see where the pieces are too tightly
        stuck together. Usually it should be enough to sand the edges. First
        sand slightly on the 2 smallest sides of the feet of the edges. The ones
        who are probably a bit curvy. Do the sadning so that u preserve this
        curvyness. Only sand a little at the time. If the cube gets too loose it
        will pop quite easily. Every time u sand u need to wash/clean the
        pieces. Dry them and relube the cube. Good luck!! -Per &gt; --- In

        I tried to use Elmer's glue (not as strong), and it kinda worked. I'm
        afraid of using superglue too as you may not get it off. I had to switch
        the caps around to get a good fit too. Rotating and trying different
        ones on different sides seems to help with the edge overhang. Overall, I
        pretty much like it though... -Howard --- In

        I ordered some high grade self adhesive vinyl like the stuff on Gilles
        site, from a local sign company. This stuff was pretty expensive. After
        it comes in on Tues or Wed and I have a chance to check it out, I'll
        make some photos. I'll offer the stickers for 3x3 at $2. plus an SASE
        for anyone that wants a set until I run out. If you want them for a
        different size cube, let me know and we'll get that figured out. Email
        me off the board if you are interested. If you are in the US and you
        order the stickers from rubik.com, considering the shipping fees, this
        is a huge svings. I will pretty much break even on what is sold. I just
        wanted to resticker a single cube, and they would not sell me that small
        amount so ther eis a lot of extra, but I could have bought 2 or 3 cubes
        for the price. If I get an overwelming response I'll just order more.
        Someone needs to do this, as the stickers from the stock cube suck.

        If you want to see the scrambled 3x3x5 (and you should if you &gt;

        There are two types of 3x3x5 cuboids (thanks GoD2 for the correction ;)
        The one I bought recently from rubiks.com is basically as you describe -
        a regular 3x3x3 with 9 extra cubies glue to opposite sides. Therefore,
        it's the same mechanics as a regular 3x3x3, it just looks really cool.
        The only thing that makes it more difficult to solve is that it's an
        awkward shape, but obviously all the same 3x3x3 algorithms can be used.
        Fully functioning 3x3x5 cuboids do exist, but I don't have one of these.
        Ton had one at the US Nationals so I had a play with it there. It was
        more difficult than my 3x3x5 because it was almost more like a 5x5x5
        with a few layers removed, rather than being like a 3x3x3 with some
        extra cubies glued on. I can solve the 5x5x5, but I found the fully
        functioning 3x3x5 quite confusing when I first played with it!! In
        answer to your other question, I have some very basic video capabilities
        (just whatever my digital camera can manage) so I'll see what I can do
        about making a short scrambling video. Jasmine

        just read this: Tu aideras a rappeler ta quantite a beaucoup de docteurs

        cleverer way is supposed to be? Oh, forgot to say: Jasmine, great pics!

        hey, im still working on my f2l, at first i was going to try to memorize
        all 41 or whatever algorithms..it was just too much..so i started trying
        to figure out exactly what was going on, so i could do it intuitively.
        right now, i can do a bunch of cases without trouble..and i have been
        going over doug reed's f2l page http://68.206.7.186/~doug/f2l/f2l.htm he
        shows 3 main cases and then 6 cases that you arrange to make the
        original 3 cases.. however i almost never get Any of the 9 cases shown
        on his site... can somoene else help me do this without memorizing all
        the algs..some tips or something.. one thing i do is, say you solved the
        cross on the bottom, and then a corner peice you need is on the bottom,
        i usually move that peice up to the top layer and then look at what case
        i have.. i dunno if thats a bad habit, but looking at the corner edge
        peices when their on the top layer is more comfortable for me..

        Hi Stefan, Everything there is mine. Feel free to laugh. =D I was
        talking about this: funahitohachihutahachihitohachihutahachi 2.7 1 8 2 8
        1 8 2 8... When written in katakana (the phonetical letters in Japanese)
        this becomes 19 letters, and 9 when written in kanji. Masayuki posted
        something about this a couple of months ago, but I'll explain anyways:
        The reason why Japanese is such a useful language for mnemonics is
        because each number can be represented by one or two letter, and many
        different letters can be used to represent the same number. For any
        given string of numbers, you can usually make enough sense out that you
        can recite it by trying different combinations. Because it's memorized
        phonetically, just by repeating the phrase you memorized, you can easily
        recall the numbers; you don't have to count how many letters there are
        in each word.Here are some well-known examples. I think in Japan anyone
        who has even the smallest interest in math knows these: (each set of
        sounds used to represent a number is surrounded by ')
        san'i'shi'i'ko'ku'ni'mu'kou.san'go'ya'ku'na'ku'san'ji'sa'ya'shi'ro'ni'
        mu'shi'san'san'ya'mi'ni'na'ku. pi=3.141592653589793238462643383279...
        hito'yo'hito'yo'ni'hito'mi'go'ro sqrt(2)=1.41421356...
        hito'na'mi'ni'o'go're'ya'o'na'go sqrt(3)=1.7320508075...
        fu'ji'san'ro'ku'o'mu'na'ku sqrt(5)=2.2360679... These are just some
        typical ways in which each number can be pronounced: 1: i, ichi, hito 2:
        ni, hu, huta 3: sa, san, mi 4: shi, yo, yon 5: go, i (can also be 1, so
        you just have to memorize which one you assigned it as), itsu 6: mu, ro,
        roku 7: na, nana (no, it won't be mistaken for 77) 8: hachi, ya 9: ku,
        kyu 10: tou, jyuu 0: rei, zero, o Yeah, there are like all kinds of
        mnemonics to memorize all kinds of historical dates, etc, for exams.
        When blindfold cubing, I always memorize my EP in Japanese (and
        everything else by sight). However, the longer the string numbers you
        are trying to memorize, the harder it is to come up with a good phrase.
        It doesn't really help much if you're trying to solve a 5x5x5
        blindfolded. ;D Hmm, I hope that made sense. Macky --- In

        Hey everyone, I found a cool game online and thought I would share. It
        is a series of mazes and you have to use the mouse to move a marker
        through the maze , around obstacles, etc.. The catch is that all the
        mouse movements are reversed. To move up you have to move the cursor
        down, and vice versa, and to move left you have to move the cursor
        right, and vice versa. Kind of reminds me of mirror cubing. With a
        little practice you get used to thinking of the movements the new way
        and don't have to convert them over in your head. There are only 20
        levels, but see how well you can do, it's fun! Also going back to using
        the mouse normally afterward feels kinda cool too :)

        I have gotten accustomed to move corner pieces and edge pieces into the
        top layer so that they immediately end up in one of the 3 main cases you
        mention (3? I count 2?). I wouldn't worry about that too much,
        especially not until you can solve the F2L good enough. As for the
        actual algs, well, I feel I can't help you out a lot without going into
        specifics on each particular case. You already have the two basic cases,
        that can be solved using a maximum of 4 moves. So just as Doug says you
        have to transform your case into one of these and then solve it. Some
        cases are easy to transform, others not so. The transforms usually
        involve "hiding" one piece away by doing, say, R. This assumes that the
        unsolved C/E pair is in FR, because it it wasn't you'd be messing up
        your already solved F2L pairs. Anyway, after doing the R you have hidden
        away the corner for a while (if it was in UBR, it'll now be in DBR), and
        then do a turn with the U layer. It may be U, U' or U2. Then undo your
        hiding turn, you will now have a different case. Learn now to "hide"
        both corners and edges. Also, learn how to "hide" the edge while
        simultaneously twisting the corner about. Say, for example, that you had
        the corner at UFR and the edge at UR, now if you did R (hide the edge
        AND twist the corner), U' (move the corner around), R' (get the edge
        back into sight), you will have not only changed the pieces locations
        but also the orientation of the corner. Another thing to notice is which
        layers you actually need to use to solve a given case. If the edge is in
        the U layer you can turn it around until it "matches" either the F or R
        center piece (assuming you are solving the FR C/E pair). If it matches
        the R center piece you'll be able to solve it using exclusively using R
        and U moves. If it matches the F center piece you'll be able to solve it
        with F and U. I don't have proof for that claim though, but I can't see
        what could possibly be wrong about it. If the edge is not in the U
        layer, it will be either completely solved, or solved but flipped,
        right? In the former case, you can solve it using R OR F, and U. In the
        latter case you must use all three. It is not thereby said that using
        the lowest-generator solutions are always the most efficient way (say,
        you could do a case using only R and U, but it MIGHT be faster if you
        also allowed yourself to use F), but generally you will want
        2-generators. Hope this helped a little. :) --- In

        Hey Chris! Dunno why, but i suddenly recalled an old classic game :
        Klotski. The object of the game is to free the red brick from the "blue
        box" and put it in the area with the other small red bricks. The last
        level takes ages to do. Have a look at this picture to realise why :

        work nicely! I re- stickered my eastsheen 5x5 week before last, and i

        the strip of tape was wide enough to cover 2 rows, so that made it
        really easy. In fact, you can put 5 strips on the cube, and then use a
        ruler to trim a straight lines and re sticker rather quickly. I only
        restickered 4/6 sides, since the white and yellow faces were in great
        shape, but it only took maybe 20 minutes. Frank Daniel Hayes

        Hey! It took me only about 30 minutes to resticker 5 sides on a
        Rubiks.com 5x5x5 cube. I used their replacement stickers, but i applied
        them one by one cause i have bad experience using the applicator sheet.
        U never get it quite straight :-o The replacement stickers are quite
        good, except i prefer a brighter orange. I never tried electrical tape
        cause i can't find the brands mentioned. And in norway we dun have have
        the same stores as "over there" ;-) I also have problems finding
        non-petroleum silicone spray here cause it's apparently been banned.
        Most likely cause it contributes to the greenhouse effect or something

        probably 60 &gt; cubes of each color though. I also came across this
        website: &gt; &gt; http://www.identi-tape.com/ &gt; &gt; That has about
        a million different colors and styles of tape. &gt; &gt; Just curious
        Jasmine, how do you go about cutting the stickers? The &gt; process I
        use is very painstaking. I use a seamstress's rotary &gt; cutter and a
        template I made on my computer. Thanks for the link to &gt; Orange! &gt;

        Hi Macky, thanks a lot for the explanation. So these "phrases" you
        build, do they have some "meaning", i.e. they tell you a story or
        something, or do they just sound nice? I think in addition to being a
        good system, the main advantage of you Japanese people is that you learn
        and practice it already when you're very young because it's part of the
        natural language? Btw, when will you solve 5x5 bld? Cheers! Stefan ---

        there is mine. Feel free to laugh. =D &gt; &gt; I was talking about
        this: &gt; funahitohachihutahachihitohachihutahachi &gt; 2.7 1 8 2 8 1 8
        2 8... &gt; When written in katakana (the phonetical letters in
        Japanese) this &gt; becomes 19 letters, and 9 when written in kanji.
        &gt; &gt; Masayuki posted something about this a couple of months ago,
        but I'll &gt; explain anyways: &gt; The reason why Japanese is such a
        useful language for mnemonics is &gt; because each number can be
        represented by one or two letter, and many &gt; different letters can be
        used to represent the same number. For any &gt; given string of numbers,
        you can usually make enough sense out that &gt; you can recite it by
        trying different combinations. Because it's &gt; memorized phonetically,
        just by repeating the phrase you memorized, &gt; you can easily recall
        the numbers; you don't have to count how many &gt; letters there are in
        each word.Here are some well-known examples. I &gt; think in Japan
        anyone who has even the smallest interest in math &gt; &gt; knows these:
        &gt; (each set of sounds used to represent a number is surrounded by ')
        &gt; san'i'shi'i'ko'ku'ni'mu'kou.
        san'go'ya'ku'na'ku'san'ji'sa'ya'shi'ro'ni' &gt;
        mu'shi'san'san'ya'mi'ni'na'ku. &gt;
        pi=3.141592653589793238462643383279... &gt; &gt;
        hito'yo'hito'yo'ni'hito'mi'go'ro &gt; sqrt(2)=1.41421356... &gt; &gt;
        hito'na'mi'ni'o'go're'ya'o'na'go &gt; sqrt(3)=1.7320508075... &gt; &gt;
        fu'ji'san'ro'ku'o'mu'na'ku &gt; sqrt(5)=2.2360679... &gt; &gt; These are
        just some typical ways in which each number can be &gt; pronounced: &gt;
        1: i, ichi, hito &gt; 2: ni, hu, huta &gt; 3: sa, san, mi &gt; 4: shi,
        yo, yon &gt; 5: go, i (can also be 1, so you just have to memorize which
        one you &gt; assigned it as), itsu &gt; 6: mu, ro, roku &gt; 7: na, nana
        (no, it won't be mistaken for 77) &gt; 8: hachi, ya &gt; 9: ku, kyu &gt;
        10: tou, jyuu &gt; 0: rei, zero, o &gt; &gt; Yeah, there are like all
        kinds of mnemonics to memorize all kinds of &gt; historical dates, etc,
        for exams. &gt; &gt; When blindfold cubing, I always memorize my EP in
        Japanese (and &gt; everything else by sight). However, the longer the
        string numbers you &gt; are trying to memorize, the harder it is to come
        up with a good &gt; phrase. It doesn't really help much if you're trying
        to solve a 5x5x5 &gt; blindfolded. ;D &gt; &gt; Hmm, I hope that made
        sense. &gt; &gt; Macky &gt; &gt; --- In

        Analyzing the logfiles of my homepage, I found these two threads about
        cubing. It's kinda amusing when they claim 7 moves are always enough to
        solve the 3x3 or when they say that's wrong and they have mathematically
        proven it's 52 moves. And other stuff...

        Don't know if this makes sense in your situation, but I could imagine in
        Michael's case (if I remember it correctly) this could work: Hang up
        posters showing a cube and write "I lost my cube, want to have it back,
        no questions asked, contact me ...". Or something like that. The point
        is it might be easier for someone to return it if you say you lost it
        than when you say someone stole it. One could always say to have "found"
        it. Also, maybe they simply don't understand you're really missing it.
        And even if you don't get it back, you still get to advertise your cube

        News: Today my wife found a long lost and lonely corner piece in the
        closet. It had been lying there, without food, drink, silicone spray or
        an edge piece to play with. The corner piece belonged to my best
        speedcube and was very happy to come home, and it made a cheerful
        "click" as it jumped back with its neighbours. That's right after it
        knocked out a rivaling corner piece from one of the cheaper brands that
        managed to get in its place. I even remember its piece pop, where it
        jumped so high and far that I just couldn't image it would wander off to
        the bottom of the closet. What a happy return! Michiel [Non-text

        Your method of cutting out the stickers is way more advanced than mine.
        I just use a regular pair of scissors. Here's what I do: 1. Cut a length
        of tape that's the same length as a single cubie sticker. This results
        in a rectangular shape because the tape is wider than a cubie sticker.
        2. Trim the rectangular piece of tape so it's a square. 3. Snip a tiny
        section of the point off each of the four corners of the new sticker.
        This is to give the illusion that I've rounded the corners of the
        sticker, like a real stickers. I can't be bothered to properly cut
        rounded corners on all the stickers!! Just snipping the corner off looks
        fine, as you can see in the picture on my blog: http://tinyurl.com/5y4p9
        4. Repeat steps 1-2 54 times!! Jasmine

        Lucky you! I too lost a corner piece in May this year (GYO). It
        happenned on our one-day school trip. I was cubing in the coach for the
        others to see me and three pieces popped up. I got two of them right
        away, but the third one just rolled away. I looked for it in the whole
        coach, the driver said he'll look for it too when he cleans up, etc.,
        but nobody found it. I still hope I someday will get a message saying
        they found my cube piece. I replaced it with a Rubiks cube piece which I
        painted this summer (oh those stickers) but now I have just a tiny
        yellow point (you can see it at the start of my cube video:
        http://www.geocities.com/portoseb/cube/videos.html ). I still don't know
        what I should do about it. Maybe just leave it like that, because this
        piece is the one I first look for when preinspection starts - 2x2x2

        with. The corner piece belonged to my best speedcube and was very happy
        to come home, and it made a cheerful "click" as it jumped back with its
        neighbours. That's right after it knocked out a rivaling corner piece
        from one of the cheaper brands that managed to get in its place. &gt;
        &gt; I even remember its piece pop, where it jumped so high and far that
        I just couldn't image it would wander off to the bottom of the closet.
        &gt; &gt; What a happy return! &gt; &gt; Michiel &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I recieved the stickers today when I got home (after working 17 hours!).
        They look fantastic. The look is very similar to these
        http://grrroux.free.fr/workshop/3restick.jpg However they are a bit
        brighter. THe red and blue are brighter and more vibrant, the orange is
        pretty close to the same, the green is slightly darker, the yellow
        matches the hue of the other colors more so it's more like a highlighter
        color. What is white. I'll uplaod some pictures ASAP, but right now it's
        off to bed, since I have to get up in 4.5 hours to do a 12 hour shift.
        Anyone interested in my offer, just email me, and I'll send you the
        address. For our less experienced folks, an SASE is a self addressed
        stamped envelope. Just stick one of those in an envelope addressed to
        me, and if you would throw a couple bucks in there it would really help
        offset the cost of this stuff. Also let me know if you want the stickers
        pre cut for a 3x3x3 or if you want to cut them yourself, and if so, what
        size 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 2x2x2, etc. I only have the template for the 3x3x3.
        If anyone has a template for 4x4x4 I would be happy to cut those as
        well. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "makeshiftaudio"

        Also, why do these braindead liars keep saying they "accidently solved

        a scrambled state, then the chance of seeing the solved state by luck is
        1-(43252003274489855999/43252003274489856000)^43252003274489856000 which
        is a close approximation of lim n-&gt;infinity 1-[(n-1)/n]^n If you work
        out this limit you get 1-(1/e) which is approximately a 63% chance. I
        know this is probably getting a little too deep into probabilities and
        stuff, but I just think it's cool that even if you did the exact same
        number of moves as there are combinations to the cube, there's still
        only a 63% that your cube will solve by luck. Chris --- In

        Well thats no different from other repeated probabilities if n is

        I was just poking around the 'cube facts' page on the rubiks.com site. I
        came across the following: "The least number of moves required in
        unscrambling the Cube from the worst disorder, the shortest route, is
        often called God's Algorithm. Morwen Thistlethwaite, using computers at
        South Bank University in London, calculated that the magical minimum was
        52 moves. A number subsequently reduced to 50. It is thought that the
        number of moves may turn out to be somewhere in the low twenties." I'm
        guessing this is where that person got the number 52. I think we all
        know that God's Algorithm is *much* lower than 52!! Jasmine

        Here's one more thing I was thinking about based on this last post.
        Assuming someone can work their way to finishing the F2L and then
        perform random transformations on the LL via trial and error then the
        odds would be a lot better of a random lucky solve. Assuming they just
        place all the LL pieces together in the right way in relation to
        eachother and all oriented correctly then the LL face can be off by one
        move, but I think we can assume that that position would be technically
        solved since someone could recognize that it was only off by 1 turn. So
        there 4 out of 62208 solved states, or 1 out of 15552. I think we can
        assume that a transformation on the LL could be done in 20 moves roughly
        if the person is using trial and error to break apart the LL and try to
        put it back together again using relatively few inefficient algorithms.
        So after each 20 move transformation the chance that the new LL
        configuration is a recognizable solved state is 1/15552. So the chance
        of solving the cube at least once in 50 transformations on the LL (1000
        moves) is 1-(15551/15552)^50 ~ 0.32% chance I think this would
        definitely be possible, even though less people figure out how to get
        the F2L than people how can figure out the first layer only. In case
        anyone is interested, Chris --- In

        Hi Jasmine, you could try to get some here:
        http://hlavolamy.gumruch.cz/europe.php (I found this page a while ago
        and I believe Ton also linked to it). You could also visit Prague ;-) I
        easily found it in a store and on markets. They do have a design (?)
        flaw, though. There's a screw, a spring and a washer in it. Problem is,
        the washer is between the spring and the screw head, not (like I think
        it should be) on the other end of the spring, protecting the plastic.
        I've seen this puzzle from a friend and the spring had already eaten
        through the plastic and thus the big middle layer piece is loose, you
        can move it in and out almost a centimeter. Quite annoying. I
        disassembled both of mine and fixed this problem. In one of them, the
        spring was already halfway through the plastic. Unfortunately, it's
        quite hard to disassemble... If you're mainly concerned about the
        stickers, maybe Adam Zamora will be able to help, he recently bought a
        sticker machine and I'll order a few from him and also ask him for
        Square-1 stickers (since I'd like to have the same color scheme as for
        3x3). See this thread on twistypuzzles.com:

        The permutations are tough at first, but you start to develop easy ways
        to recognize the cases. I'll see if I can help you out though. Out of
        the 21 permutations:
        http://www.speedcubing.com/final_layer_permutation.html 3 with all edges
        correct: P1, P2, P3 4 with all corners correct: P4, P5, P6, P7 6 with 2
        adjacent correct corners: P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13 4 with 2 opposite
        correct corners: P18, P19, P20, P21 4 oddballs: P14, P15, P16, P17
        Notice I listed five categories here. When you reach your permutation,
        you have to recognize which category the case lies under. Then, of that
        category, narrow it down from there. This is how I did it anyway. I hope
        this helps! -Richard --- yodude565 &lt;yodude565@...&gt; wrote: &gt;

        I'm pretty sure a lot of people do this but I look for patterns on the
        sides of the upper layer (the LL) instead of looking for how to move the
        pieces around. (this will be hard to explain if you dont know what i'm
        talking about, but i'll try...it might help to do the algorithm
        backwards on a solved cube and follow along) Like for example in P21,
        the upper layer of the back face has two adjacent stickers that are the
        same color, AND the upper layer of the left face has two adjacent
        stickers that are the same color. This pattern of two adjacent sticker
        of the same color on two ADJACENT faces helps me to recognize that it's
        P21. Another example is P9. There are once again two adjacent stickers
        of the same color on the sides of the LL, but this time they are on
        OPPOSITE faces, and that's my cue for a P9. It's kind of hard to
        recognize the patterns of P14, P15, P16, and P17 at first because they
        all look similar, but you should get it with pratice. Sorry if this was
        confusing! Prabhat --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        The way I recognize the PLL case is to study the "band" around the U
        layer. This will be the only unsolved part of the cube. What I do then
        is to take notice of blocks of solid color. You can pretty much always
        uniquely identify the permutation my recognizing these block patterns.
        An n-block is for the purpose of this post such a solid block n stickers
        long where all n stickers are on the same face and all have the same
        color. Patterns with a 3-block: - P6, P7: In addition to the 3-block all
        the corners will be correct relative to each other. - P8, P9: In
        addition to the 3-block there will be a 2-block adjoining it on another
        face. - P13: This is the only case with only a 3-block. Patterns with
        four 2-blocks: - P19, P20: Not much to say. These are the only ones with
        four full 2-blocks. Patterns with two 2-blocks joined together on a
        corner: - P1, P2: In addition to the two 2-blocks all the edges will be
        correct relative to each other. Another way to recognize this is that
        when looking at the "2x2" block the two stickers "outside" of it will
        have the same color. - P18: Having a "2x2" block but none of the
        patterns described for P1 and P2. Patterns with two 2-blocks not joined
        together: - P10: The two 2-blocks will be parallell. - P21: The two
        2-blocks will be orthogonal. Note: On both these patterns the piece
        "squished" inbetween the 2-blocks (an edge in P10 and a corner in P21)
        will be "surrounded" by stickers of opposite colors. Patterns with one
        2-block: - P11, P12: In addition to the 2-block, a corner adjacent to
        the corner in the 2-block will be correct relative to that corner. -
        P14, P15, P16, P17: These are tough. The pictures on the site is not how
        I do them. I always start the alg with the 2-block where it's supposed
        to be. See if you can figure out how to distinguish these. Hint: Let the
        2-block be solved and have a look at the corner adjacent to the edge in
        the 2-block. I.e. if the 2-block is in FRU and FU, I distinguish these
        by looking at the FLU corner. Patterns with no blocks: - P4: There will
        be a "dot" pattern on each side, meaning that the 2 corner stickers will
        be the same color and the edge sticker will be the odd one out. Also,
        the edge sticker will NOT be the opposite color of the corner stickers.
        - P5: Same as P4 (above) but the edge sticker WILL be the opposite color
        of the corner stickers. - P3: This one is hard to spot right away. All
        edges will be solved in relation to each other, but the corners are
        messed up. A surefire way is to say that if you can't work out it's
        another pattern, it must be P3. :) I believe I nailed them all then. ---

        Does anyone know of any good LL edge algs for the 4x4. I'm learing

        Hi Wayne! U can cycle any 3 edges on last layer quite easily. Use a
        basic 3- cycle with some setup moves. Here is one example:
        r2-lD2l'-U-ld2l'-U'-r2 Another example: b2-lDl'-U-ld'l'-U'-b2 Note that
        these are both of the form S-ABA'B'-S, conjugate commutators :-) If u
        need help for more LL 3-cycles dun hesitate to contac me :-) -Per PS! I
        do them on top. Transform them to have the effect wherever u like ;-)

        Hey! That number is rather a minmax than a minimum. It is believe that
        some worst case positions do require at least 22 moves. But as far as i
        know Kociemba's Cube Explorer has found a 20 move solution or better for
        any position thrown at it. A good place to start reading about "cube
        maths" is the following:
        http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/theory.htm#godal Jaap's site is
        simply the best puzzle site that exists on the net. Though there are
        better sites specifically for the Rubik's Cube and it's many methods of
        solution :-) -Per &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Are we talking about single edge cubies or about edge pairs? It would
        help if you could describe a little better what you'd like, e.g. "I'd

        &gt; r2-lD2l'-U-lD2l'-U'-r2 If you count inner slice turns as two turns,
        you lose 16-14 against this one: (Ll) U2 - (F L F') l2 (F L' F') l2 - U2

        slice turns as the second/fourth part of a commutator from Macky's page.
        Somehow I had never thought about it myself. This is a fast one I just
        made up: (U' R' U) r (U' R U) r' I'll most likely use something like
        this for blindsolving in the future...

        You can of course know all PLL by just seeing two faces. First notice
        the corners, are they all the same, all opposite, or a mix? This helps
        you narrow the number of cases. Then you can study the edges, I cannot
        go into detail because it would take forever, but every pattern will be
        unique, even if the difference is only subtle. Dan Harris :) -----

        2:09 PM Subject: [Speed cubing group] Re: PLL The way I recognize the
        PLL case is to study the "band" around the U layer. This will be the
        only unsolved part of the cube. What I do then is to take notice of
        blocks of solid color. You can pretty much always uniquely identify the
        permutation my recognizing these block patterns. An n-block is for the
        purpose of this post such a solid block n stickers long where all n
        stickers are on the same face and all have the same color. Patterns with
        a 3-block: - P6, P7: In addition to the 3-block all the corners will be
        correct relative to each other. - P8, P9: In addition to the 3-block
        there will be a 2-block adjoining it on another face. - P13: This is the
        only case with only a 3-block. Patterns with four 2-blocks: - P19, P20:
        Not much to say. These are the only ones with four full 2-blocks.
        Patterns with two 2-blocks joined together on a corner: - P1, P2: In
        addition to the two 2-blocks all the edges will be correct relative to
        each other. Another way to recognize this is that when looking at the
        "2x2" block the two stickers "outside" of it will have the same color. -
        P18: Having a "2x2" block but none of the patterns described for P1 and
        P2. Patterns with two 2-blocks not joined together: - P10: The two
        2-blocks will be parallell. - P21: The two 2-blocks will be orthogonal.
        Note: On both these patterns the piece "squished" inbetween the 2-blocks
        (an edge in P10 and a corner in P21) will be "surrounded" by stickers of
        opposite colors. Patterns with one 2-block: - P11, P12: In addition to
        the 2-block, a corner adjacent to the corner in the 2-block will be
        correct relative to that corner. - P14, P15, P16, P17: These are tough.
        The pictures on the site is not how I do them. I always start the alg
        with the 2-block where it's supposed to be. See if you can figure out
        how to distinguish these. Hint: Let the 2-block be solved and have a
        look at the corner adjacent to the edge in the 2-block. I.e. if the
        2-block is in FRU and FU, I distinguish these by looking at the FLU
        corner. Patterns with no blocks: - P4: There will be a "dot" pattern on
        each side, meaning that the 2 corner stickers will be the same color and
        the edge sticker will be the odd one out. Also, the edge sticker will
        NOT be the opposite color of the corner stickers. - P5: Same as P4
        (above) but the edge sticker WILL be the opposite color of the corner
        stickers. - P3: This one is hard to spot right away. All edges will be
        solved in relation to each other, but the corners are messed up. A
        surefire way is to say that if you can't work out it's another pattern,
        it must be P3. :) I believe I nailed them all then. --- In

        Hi Stefan, I get a 'page cannot be found error' when I go to

        not really the stickers, I think the cube just came from a bad batch or
        something. I siliconed it, but this just made things worse. I had lost
        my good silicone and the replacement brand I bought was crappy. Oh well.
        Maybe I shall just have to visit Prague and stock up on Square-1s!! :)

        through the plastic and thus the big &gt; middle layer piece is loose,
        you can move it in and out almost a &gt; centimeter. Quite annoying. I
        disassembled both of mine and fixed this &gt; problem. In one of them,

        thanks for all the tips on recognizing which case i am presented with. i
        had one more question..how do you guys go about memorizing all the algs
        needed.. so far im gonna try to just do one alg over and over until i
        know it..then go to the next.. and remember the number taht goes to each
        one..and then try to learn to recognize each one.. just curious how you
        guys try to memorize them?

        Hey! Optimal algs were not the issue here. The thing is that u can make
        my kind of edge 3-cycles on the fly. Ur alg u would have to just
        memorise anyway. Only for fewest moves solve would i resort to 3- cycles
        using inner slice moves for LL 3-cycles. Who counts moves when u
        speedsolve anyway? Another advantage of my way is that if u write the
        alg in this form S-ABA'B'-S' u always will have that B is turning the
        U-layer. No need to turn cube over in any way when u wanna
        speedoptimise. Also easier to get lookahead when u never move that LL
        away from staying on top. Also the official rules for nxnxn cubes with
        n&gt;3 says that any inner slice move counts as 1 as opposed to for the
        3x3x3 (historical reasons). I dun wanna argue. Just pointing out the
        advantages of my approach for a beginner :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        Sooooorrrry.... ;-) &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; P.S. I got the idea to use
        inner slice turns as the second/fourth part &gt; of a commutator from
        Macky's page. Somehow I had never thought about &gt; it myself. This is
        a fast one I just made up: &gt; (U' R' U) r (U' R U) r' &gt; I'll most

        The secret in memorizing algorithms is in 'chunking'. &lt;snip&gt;
        http://library.thinkquest.org/C0110291/tricks/mnemonics/grouping.php
        Chunking Look at the following chunks of letters: T WAN BAC BSC PRC IA
        At first glance, its seems like they would be difficult to memorize.
        However, with simple chunking, look at them now: TWA NBA CBS CPR CIA
        &lt;/snip&gt; With chunking, or grouping, we're able to take algorithms
        and make them easier to learn. Take the following algorithm for example:
        (T permutation) RUR'U'R'FR2U'R'U'RUR'F' This can seem overwhelming. When
        grouped like this however: (RUR')(U'R'F)(R2U'R'U')(RUR'F') This way you
        are learning 4 pieces of information. Typically algorithms are grouped
        by triggers. When you get used to learning algs this way, the process of
        committing it to your short term memory becomes pretty easy. It usually
        only takes me about 45 seconds to get the alg in my head. How do I
        commit the algorithm to long term memory? It's easy to learn the turns
        of an alg, but after that, there are a few aspects you have to worry
        about. *Recognition~ This is where practice comes in. Set the case up on
        the LL, and practice recognizing it from different angles (via U, U', U2
        turns) *Execution~ turning the turns in your head, into turns by your
        hand. I usually repeat an alg after I learn it 50+ times a day. Even if
        it took you 10 seconds to do the alg, at 50 times a day it still takes
        less than 10 minutes. After some practice you'll make the turns without
        even thinking about them. It's like learning to tie your shoes. After
        you did it enough times you didn't really have to look anymore. Hope
        this helped, -richard --- yodude565 &lt;yodude565@...&gt; wrote: &gt;

        Try and look for your next corner/edge pair while doing the current one.
        You may think you're doing this but you're really following the pair
        you're currently inserting. I need to work on this as well, but I
        dropped from 60 to around 32 in about 2 weeks by working on doing this.

        Be able to identify and execute your F2L algorithms without thinking.
        That way your fingers are working while you are looking for your next
        pair. Something that just clicked for me not too long ago is the ability
        to start an algorithm on one side of the cube and finish it on the
        other. Not sure how to learn this, but it helps temendously to be a
        little dynamic in the F2L to be a bit 'creative' in mixing up the
        algorithms. F2L is certainly one of the hang ups for faster times but
        it's almost hypnotic when you do it right. --- In

        new record...! On thing I would personally advise to a person averaging
        around a minute or maybe 40 seconds, is to solve the cube very slowly a
        lot of times, without timing yourself. Try to do it really slow, while
        minimizing the amount of moves you need. Try to find some shortcuts
        yourself (don't apply the F2L algs without thinking!). Also, try to
        solve the cube really slow, but without stopping. This can be pretty
        hard, because I know it can be very hard to find your CE pairs :). But
        you will get used to it. Then, when you can solve it without too much
        big delays, gradually increase your amount of moves per second. Doing
        this, I think you'll be averaging under 40 second pretty soon. Good
        luck, Joel.

        Strange... I clicked on it again (the link you wrote) and got the

        applied *a lot* of good silicone spray. When you say "it made things
        worse" for you, maybe yours also had some other lubricant inside which
        is not "compatible" with your silicone spray? I like mine very much now,

        http://hlavolamy.gumruch.cz/europe.php &gt; &gt; (I found this page a
        while ago and I believe Ton also linked to &gt; it). &gt; &gt; You could
        also visit Prague ;-) I easily found it in a store and &gt; on &gt; &gt;
        markets. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They do have a design (?) flaw, though.
        There's a screw, a spring &gt; and &gt; &gt; a washer in it. Problem is,
        the washer is between the spring and &gt; the &gt; &gt; screw head, not
        (like I think it should be) on the other end of &gt; the &gt; &gt;
        spring, protecting the plastic. I've seen this puzzle from a &gt; friend
        &gt; &gt; and the spring had already eaten through the plastic and thus
        the &gt; big &gt; &gt; middle layer piece is loose, you can move it in
        and out almost a &gt; &gt; centimeter. Quite annoying. I disassembled
        both of mine and fixed &gt; this &gt; &gt; problem. In one of them, the
        spring was already halfway through &gt; the &gt; &gt; plastic.
        Unfortunately, it's quite hard to disassemble... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If
        you're mainly concerned about the stickers, maybe Adam Zamora &gt; will
        &gt; &gt; be able to help, he recently bought a sticker machine and I'll
        &gt; order a &gt; &gt; few from him and also ask him for Square-1
        stickers (since I'd &gt; like to &gt; &gt; have the same color scheme as
        for 3x3). See this thread on &gt; &gt; twistypuzzles.com: &gt; &gt;

        Hey, I claim you can make up my kind of edge 3-cycles on the fly, too
        :-) Don't you think so? At least with some practice? I admit that so far
        I only really use your way, but I'm gonna try the inner-slice algs as
        well. And even though we don't count moves when speedsolving, I think
        the inner-slice algs can be executed faster. Well, I don't really
        speedsolve (but blindsolve) using 3-cycles (super5x5speed I do use them
        for centers but only 3x3-style without inner slice turns) so maybe your
        opinion should count more ;-) Cheers! Stefan --- In

        &gt; to for the 3x3x3 (historical reasons). &gt; &gt; I dun wanna argue.
        Just pointing out the advantages of my approach &gt; for a beginner :-)

        Hi, since I live in Prague, I can give you some information. It is true,
        that Czech variation of Square-1 Cube 21 (which is in fact original -
        Square-1 is a copy :)) is freely available in many shops here. However,
        recently the production of Cube 21 went to China and these new series
        are horrible, so be careful. The original series seems finished this
        year and they are really good (good plastic, shape, stickers) but the
        stock is limited. I do not sell them, but I know some people that have
        knowledge where to get what type... So If anyone is about to visit
        Prague and want to buy Cube 21 here, email me and I can ask for info
        about it... Cube 21 are well compatible with silicone oil in general...
        Best regards. Josef &gt; If I'm ever in Prague, I shall email you for
        the details of that &gt; store! &gt; &gt; The problem with my Square-1
        is not really the stickers, I think the &gt; cube just came from a bad
        batch or something. I siliconed it, but &gt; this just made things
        worse. I had lost my good silicone and the &gt; replacement brand I
        bought was crappy. Oh well. Maybe I shall just &gt; have to visit Prague
        and stock up on Square-1s!! :) &gt; &gt; Jasmine &gt;

        I had a particularly hard time figuring out what people were talking
        about when they mentioned finger tricks when I first started. What
        helped me tremendously to overcome that was Dan Knights' page:
        http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#hints There
        he shows videos (fast and slow versions) of various basic and
        intermediate finger trick combos. This site helps in that after you
        learn the basic triggers, you can try to put them together in different
        combinations to form more intermediate and advanced triggers. Basically
        when practicing a new alg, try to always group the faces together in
        many different ways, and groups that feel comfortable to you to perform
        as a finger trick try to keep together. Eventually you will have most of
        the moves in an alg as part of some finger trick, and the alg will go
        very quickly. For now, if you're still new to finger trick combos, try
        to learn all of the ones Dan has videos for, then try to combine them in
        different ways and come up with your own new combos. Then if any of
        those moves spark any new ideas, try them out! Eventually you will
        develop your own finger trick style. I do certain types of finger trick
        combos that I don't really see many others do, but I've also seen a lot
        of finger tricks combos that others do that I had never even considered
        to try before. Just remember to always do what feels most comfortable to
        you, even if someone else does it a different way. Hope that helps some,

        yes, I agree with Chris. finger tricks are a very personal thing, and
        you will of course eventually find your own style. For example, Ron
        would prefer to make R' U2 by turning R' with his right hand, and then
        using his right index to push on the RUF sticker and push it all the way
        round. I on the other hand prefer to make R' with my right hand, and
        then use my right index finger to pull on BUR and drag it all the way
        round. So you can see that the same move can be performed in more than
        one way, and depends on how flexible you are, how tight you grip the
        cube, etc. Dan Knights' site is definitely worth checking out,
        especially since it will demonstrate to you exactly what a finger trick
        is. then you can begin experimenting with your own tricks :) Dan Harris

        Okay, I used to use the Fridrich method and it took me about 3 minutes
        to complete my cube (which isn't built for speedcubing). I found that
        using a combonation of Fridrich and my own weird corner permuting
        method, I can get the first 2 layers easily within 1 minute. Does

        to think about this... I think the most important thing is that starting
        with one face will cost some extra moves, and is slightly less efficient
        (in terms of moves). I asume getting sub-20 using such a method will
        require a bit more dexterity. The difference in terms of seconds won't
        be really big, although I am not sure if it's really just 2 seconds (I
        am a sceptic :)). I guess the key-hole method will be great, especially
        for a beginner. It doesn't really require algoritms, and I am sure
        averaging 25 seconds is possible, with enough practice. (actually, I use
        Fridrich, but like most speedcubers, I also use a lot of shortcuts based
        on the key-hole idea). So.. Why does everyone bother learning F2L? Well,
        when you get really fast (when you almost reach your potential speed
        with your layer-by-layer method), then it will become harder and harder
        to get faster, and learning F2L will be a nice and easy way to get some
        extra seconds off your time (easier than learning loads of algs for ZB
        method, for example). -Joel.

        Hey everyone, I recently sent a suggestion to Ron and Tyson which was
        also brought up on the caltech group. There have been a number of
        concerns so I decided to bring it up here. My initial message was to
        petition for a format change for the final round of the one-handed
        event. I feel that a mean of 3 (all three solves counting) would be a
        better representation of a cuber's skill, as well as still conforming to
        the time constraints of having numerous events. An average of 5 (fastest
        and slowest discarded) might take too long considering that there will
        be a number of other events at the competition. Also to be more
        specific, one pop would be allowed. Pops one-handed are extremely rare,
        but in case someone popped I don't think they should be disqualified
        because of it. Again this is open to debate too, and is only my opinion.
        I have a few reasons for this change: 1) It forces the cuber to not be
        able to make any mistakes. By this I am referring almost solely to
        one-handed amnesia. I still have quite a lot of trouble with this under
        pressure, and I feel that the rules of the competition should penalize
        it since it is a huge mistake in a solve. This also rewards those who
        have practiced harder to overcome it. 2) It decreases the possibility of
        someone winning with an easy solve, or for the more extreme example a
        lucky solve. My 25 second solve at the US competition was not
        technically lucky, in that I planned for all the shortcuts I used,
        however I admit that it was a little lucky in that the scramble gave me
        a 5 move extended cross, which is somewhat rare. I think an easy solve
        in a mean of 3 solves would be less beneficial to the cuber than an easy
        solve in a "best of" competition. 3) It makes the one-handed event more
        of an official event. Maybe it is just me but I feel like all the "best
        of" events are less official somehow. As an exception though in
        competitions where there is a time constraint having a "best of" format
        in order to allow an event makes perfect sense to me. For larger
        competitions though I think it would be better to have a mean of 3 for
        most of the events, but in particular I want to push this for the
        one-handed event. Ron mentioned doing this for all final rounds which
        would be great. ---- That is the end of my concerns about this. There
        were a number of other concerns on the caltech group about this, so we
        decided to bring it up here. Personally I like the idea of having a best
        of 2 or 3 for the one- handed first round, but a mean of 3 for the final
        round (where all 3 solves count). Again that is just my opinion, and I'm
        curious to see if any others agree. Maybe I'm the only weirdo who thinks
        this deep into the one- handed event :) but I hope some others either
        disagree or agree so that we can try to come to some sort of compromise.

        http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cube2.htm#numpos I would like
        to know how it calculated the values of the table! If they were
        calculated by computer, did you know how ? Which is the algorithm?
        Thanks ..

        well, that's a bit misleading... F2L is definitely helpful. I was just

        No I am not, but I wish I could go. I simply can't afford the traveling
        fees to California right now :( I had suggested the format change not
        for the upcoming competition only, but hopefully for all future
        competitions. I just like the format of the 4x4 and 5x5 final rounds as
        they are now (mean of 3), and would personally prefer to see it used for
        the one-handed final as well. However this isn't really my call to make,
        so I wanted to bring it up and see what others thought in case enough
        people agreed and the format might be changed. I figured it would be
        better to try than not to try. Chris --- In

        To make a long story short, my brand new 2x2x2 is now in 24 pieces. I
        have no idea how to put it back together correctly. I have restored it
        into a cube before, but I cannot make all of the moves. (right now it is
        in the 24 pieces). I need the right configuration. Can anyone help me?
        The pieces: 8 corner pieces 4 spindle pieces (one piece is the main
        part, the other 3 parts "swivel") 12 sliders (10 normal sliders, 2
        elongated) !!Here is a link to a picture I took of all of the peices:
        http://mars.walagata.com/w/elite185/all-parts.jpg Some of the corners
        have stoppers. When the elongated "sliders" (2 elongated ones) hit the
        stoppers, you can't make a turn. As you can see, with the spindle, 3
        parts of the spindle are fixed(don't turn), and 3 parts (the separate
        parts) turn freely. I think they key is figuring out the configuration
        of stoppers and the spindle relative to the corners. Some corners have
        stoppers in different places! Hopefully someone can help me! Thanks in
        advance! Jason

        I agree that using the fastest time is not really good. However, using
        the mean using all solves can give interesting effects. For instance, in
        the European Championships where this rule was imposed, Lars Vanderbergh
        ended up third in the 4x4x4. He had two great solves (below 1 min 10 s
        including a new WR) and one terrible one (well over three minutes). One
        alternative to both "fastest time" and taking the mean, is to take the
        median, that is, the middle number. For example, in the series 12 19 20
        25 79, the median is 20. When there is an even number of numbers, the
        median is the mean of the two middle numbers. Thus, the median of the
        series 12 19 20 25 is (19+20)/2 = 19,5. The median is less sensitive to
        extreme scores than the mean and this makes it a better measure than the
        mean for highly skewed distributions. Thus, I am inclined to suggest
        that taking the median should replace both taking the mean and the use
        of the fastest solve. Taking the median is easy to apply and is easy to
        calculate. Your comments about this? /Anders --- In

        wrote: &gt; &gt; Hey everyone, &gt; &gt; I recently sent a suggestion to
        Ron and Tyson which was also brought &gt; up on the caltech group. There
        have been a number of concerns so I &gt; decided to bring it up here.
        &gt; &gt; My initial message was to petition for a format change for the
        final &gt; round of the one-handed event. I feel that a mean of 3 (all
        three &gt; solves counting) would be a better representation of a
        cuber's &gt; skill, as well as still conforming to the time constraints
        of having &gt; numerous events. An average of 5 (fastest and slowest
        discarded) &gt; might take too long considering that there will be a
        number of other &gt; events at the competition. Also to be more
        specific, one pop would &gt; be allowed. Pops one-handed are extremely
        rare, but in case someone &gt; popped I don't think they should be
        disqualified because of it. &gt; Again this is open to debate too, and
        is only my opinion. &gt; &gt; I have a few reasons for this change: &gt;
        &gt; 1) It forces the cuber to not be able to make any mistakes. By this
        &gt; I am referring almost solely to one-handed amnesia. I still have
        &gt; quite a lot of trouble with this under pressure, and I feel that
        the &gt; rules of the competition should penalize it since it is a huge
        &gt; mistake in a solve. This also rewards those who have practiced &gt;
        harder to overcome it. &gt; &gt; 2) It decreases the possibility of
        someone winning with an easy &gt; solve, or for the more extreme example
        a lucky solve. My 25 second &gt; solve at the US competition was not
        technically lucky, in that I &gt; planned for all the shortcuts I used,
        however I admit that it was a &gt; little lucky in that the scramble
        gave me a 5 move extended cross, &gt; which is somewhat rare. I think an
        easy solve in a mean of 3 solves &gt; would be less beneficial to the
        cuber than an easy solve in a "best &gt; of" competition. &gt; &gt; 3)
        It makes the one-handed event more of an official event. Maybe &gt; it
        is just me but I feel like all the "best of" events are less &gt;
        official somehow. As an exception though in competitions where &gt;
        there is a time constraint having a "best of" format in order to &gt;
        allow an event makes perfect sense to me. For larger competitions &gt;
        though I think it would be better to have a mean of 3 for most of &gt;
        the events, but in particular I want to push this for the one- handed
        &gt; event. Ron mentioned doing this for all final rounds which would be
        &gt; great. &gt; &gt; ---- &gt; &gt; That is the end of my concerns
        about this. There were a number of &gt; other concerns on the caltech

        All 3 big pie peices must go in the same cubie (doesn't matte which one)

        I have to second this opinion. The median catches extreme values
        effectively and gives a fairer average than if the mean was used. It
        also eliminates lucky solves nicely. Since it eliminates extreme values
        there is no need to set a limit for POP's and the like. As long as a
        contestant finishes enough solves to calculate a median everything is
        fine, else it is a disqualification. The fine thing is that even though
        more Pop's and DNS's will be allowed (4 in a run of 10 times or 2 in a
        run of 5) every such event will still reflect negative upon the median
        since it will always be counted as the worst time. This means it's not
        possible to gain anything from a POP or DNS, but the effect upon your
        average will be less dramatic than that of using the mean. I see few, if
        any, drawbacks in using the median instead of the mean. I see quite a
        few advantages though and I vote for that all averages will be
        calculated with the median instead of the arithmetic mean. This includes
        unofficial and official records on speedcubing.com as well as
        competitions. /Gustav --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I agree, the median does sound like a good idea, but I would call it an
        average of 3. That is essentially all the median is. For a run of 5 or
        10 though, taking an average makes more sense than a median. The average
        of 3 also helps simplify things further, since it does not add another
        method of calculating times (ex. best of, average, mean). A mean of 3
        does "punsish" a solver for having amnesia put it equally rewards a
        solver for having a lucky case. An average of 3 would reduce the
        likelyhood of having either a good or bad solve solve. Which method is
        better? I seem to lean towards average of 3 because the best and worst
        time are discarded in other averages. If you use a mean of 3, why not a
        mean of 12? My 2 cents. --barefoot Chris --- In

        To be perfectly honest I've been lazy about setting up even a club at my
        school for the cube. I can always find motivation to practice for the
        cube, but to be perfectly honest I am absolutely horrible at the
        administrative part at setting up a competition. I seem to have been the
        only one to jump in on the east coast and say that I'd start up a
        competition, but it doesn't look like I'm a very dependable person in
        this respect. Does anyone else on the east coast want to jump in here? I
        can donate the use of my timer and tournament display, as well as try my
        best to setup and judge events in which I'm not competing and all that.
        I'd like to be taken off the list of potential people setting up
        competitions though. I'll be perfectly honest, I'm too lazy to try to
        get by with a 16 hour semester and try to setup a competition. I know
        others could do it, but I'm not able to. I apologize for those who were
        waiting on me to see if a tournament would pop up. I would love to help

        Hey Chris, I've actually been thinking about holding a tournament, but I
        didn't think too hard about it since I heard you were thinking about it
        too. However, in light of this recent news break, I would be willing to
        host one. I am at the University of Maryland (at College Park), so it
        seems like a very central location along the east coast. I think I could
        get enough judges/timers from around here to help out. Also, I'm fairly
        certain I could get a lecture hall of some kind, or even something in

        A hybrid possibility I've been arguing for is that you take the average
        of the two best solves. It's kind of a compromise between picking the
        best time and the full average. But the bottom line is probably that
        there isn't any real good way to decide who is really best from 3
        attempts. I don't know about medians. You throw away more information
        than you need to that way. Especially for small numbers. It doesn't seem
        right that 24, 24, 33 beats 17, 25, 25. Then again you can construct
        weird examples with any method. It's a question of what you're really
        trying to measure too, but I won't go into that. /Lars

        Hi Chris, If you want an event to happen, you need to figure out what
        you're going to do and go do it. Seems simple but pretty hard. Try

        &gt;&gt;&gt; I agree that using the fastest time is not really good.
        &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; However, using the mean using all solves can
        give interesting &gt;&gt;&gt; effects. For instance, in the European
        Championships where this &gt;&gt; rule &gt;&gt;&gt; was imposed, Lars
        Vanderbergh ended up third in the 4x4x4. He &gt; had &gt;&gt;&gt; two
        great solves (below 1 min 10 s including a new WR) and one &gt;&gt;&gt;
        terrible one (well over three minutes). &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; One
        alternative to both "fastest time" and taking the mean, is &gt; to
        &gt;&gt;&gt; take the median, that is, the middle number. For example,
        in the &gt;&gt;&gt; series 12 19 20 25 79, the median is 20. When there
        is an even &gt;&gt;&gt; number of numbers, the median is the mean of the
        two middle &gt;&gt; numbers. &gt;&gt;&gt; Thus, the median of the series
        12 19 20 25 is (19+20)/2 = 19,5. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The median is
        less sensitive to extreme scores than the mean and &gt;&gt;&gt; this
        makes it a better measure than the mean for highly skewed &gt;&gt;&gt;

        Certainly agree with Chris about most of this. I'd really rather
        one-handed was treated exactly the same as two-handed. I'm not sure what

        I had a HUGE amount of trouble with rubiks.com last month!! I was trying
        to put in a fairly substantial order and almost gave up because it was
        so complicated. I spent ages on rubiks.com trying to put in this order.
        I was going to be spending a reasonable amount of money (9 puzzles!) and
        they were making it *so* difficult. There were many problems, including
        that they'd attached some random unrelated postal address to my login
        (not my address) and the site wouldn't accept my credit cards (I tried
        several cards). I had used the credit cards the same day for other
        transactions and there was no problem, so why wouldn't rubiks.com accept
        them?? If I'd been able to get the all the puzzles from mefferts.com
        then I definitely would have. I've used mefferts.com before without
        problem and they shipped my order to Australia in two weeks and provided
        free international airmail! :) I was quite keen to get the puzzles
        though, so I persisted and was *eventually* able to put in the order.

        Of course a mean of 12 is not practical. My point was that in a normal

        Thanks for the input guys, I appreciate it. David - I was also unaware
        of a fellow MD cuber, we'll have to get together some time. I could
        definitly use your help in setting this up, as your location makes you
        optimal. I'm thinking that if I purchased a stackmat (which I've been
        meaning to do for a while now), and a few others brought their own, this
        could go rather smoothly. I'm planning on finding out what I could get
        as far as a location for this in the coming week. It seems as though
        competitions are better in halls with steeper seats, so everyone can
        see. I have a few ideas of some larger lecture halls that might work
        well. I'm glad to see that there is interest, as I am excited about
        undertaking this. I'll try to keep you all up to date on any

        Sorry in advance if I just made a complete fool of myself, - but since,
        from the solved cube you can create 18 different permutations (R, R', R2

        ((43252003274489856000- 18)/43252003274489856000) ^ 1000 = approx

        CONGRATULATIONS !!!! What a magnificent feeling ! I still remember my
        first solve (in the early 80s) Now you are the master of your cube. It
        will do whatever you ask it to do. But now it is up to you to decide how
        far you want to go. You can spend YEARS being perfectly happy with the
        fact that you can solve it from any state. Or, if you want, you can dive
        into the (obsession ?) of speedcubing. You will find TONS of help in
        this forum. The MOST IMPORTANT piece of advice I can give you is to make
        sure that you always enjoy solving the cube. Different stokes for
        different folks - some are very happy to solve, others are only happy
        when they solve more quickly, and most of us fall somewhere in between.
        Enjoy your triumph. Enjoy it again and again and again (I enjoyed a
        simple layer by layer system for more than 10 years !!). Then, when
        you're ready, go for speed by gradually fine-tuning your system. But,

        Hi Lars (P), I have been trying to shift from a simple cross to a 2x2x2
        block to start my solution on the 3x3x3. Quite frankly I'm not very good
        at it in a 15 second inspection period. Given as much time as I need I
        can eventually figure it out in a reasonable number of moves (roughly
        8-10 QTM if no c/e pair to start, 6-8 QTM if c/e pair from heaven).
        Doubtless I will eventually become better at this with practice. But my
        question is: do you have any stats (or semi- complete-stats, or just a
        'gut feeling') for how many QTM it should take to unite a 2x2x2 block? I
        know a cross can ALWAYS be solved in 8 HTM but what about a 2x2x2 - the
        same numer of pieces but a different combo and a (3 orientation) piece
        amongst (2 orientation) pieces. Are my stats way off base? Do I need to
        work on radically improving my solve strategy or only my recognition
        time??? Yours, Rob

        Hey East Coast PPL, I'm in NY, and Maryland would be a pretty good
        location for a competition! :-) I recently purchased a Stackmat and I'd
        definitely bring it in for use during the competition, and there's a
        decent chance that I would able to make it there. I only solve the 3x3x3
        so I would also be able to judge 4x4x4 and other solves as well. -Raul

        I haven't seen any real numbers, but my gut feeling is that the best
        average you can humanly get is 6 moves. I'd be really surprised if that
        was more than half a move off. That's when picking the best of 8
        starting corners. For a random corner I'd guess 8. The best way to get
        better is probably to spend a lot of time thinking about it and solving
        it for fewest moves. And it sounds like that is exactly what you're
        doing. You'll learn to recognize some non obvious things. Here's an
        example: Do R B L. Observe how the URF corner is "joined up wrong" with
        the UF edge, with the U color matching. There are pairs like that on
        pretty much every mixed cube, and those three (reversed) moves are often
        part of a great start. I wish I had a well researched answer for what
        you can expect to find during a 15 second preinspection. A wild guess is
        that I could get 1-2 moves more than optimal if I tried hard. I usually
        don't try hard (it's hard!). Also, I don't always go for the fewest
        moves, but for fast moves, lack of grip shifting, and preparing for the
        later steps. /Lars On Oct 9, 2004, at 2:04, Rob Butler wrote: &gt; &gt;
        Hi Lars (P), &gt; &gt; I have been trying to shift from a simple cross
        to a 2x2x2 block to &gt; start my solution on the 3x3x3. Quite frankly
        I'm not very good at &gt; it in a 15 second inspection period. Given as
        much time as I need I &gt; can eventually figure it out in a reasonable
        number of moves &gt; (roughly 8-10 QTM if no c/e pair to start, 6-8 QTM
        if c/e pair from &gt; heaven). Doubtless I will eventually become better
        at this with &gt; practice. But my question is: do you have any stats
        (or semi- &gt; complete-stats, or just a 'gut feeling') for how many QTM
        it should &gt; take to unite a 2x2x2 block? I know a cross can ALWAYS be
        solved in &gt; 8 HTM but what about a 2x2x2 - the same numer of pieces
        but a &gt; different combo and a (3 orientation) piece amongst (2
        orientation) &gt; pieces. Are my stats way off base? Do I need to work
        on radically &gt; improving my solve strategy or only my recognition
        time??? &gt; &gt; Yours, &gt; &gt; Rob

        Hey! This could surely be calculated by a computer. Looking at the 2x2x2
        block it is 3 centers (static), 3 edges and 1 corner. If one fixes the
        position of the centers we have the following numbers of possible
        positions each cubicle could have come from : 1st edge : 24 (12
        positions times 2 orientations) 2nd edge : 22 (11 positions times 2

        I've had my rubiks.com 5x5x5 cube for a few months, and I've been trying
        to break it in the entire time I've owned it. It was still very hard to
        turn the layers even after lubricating it many times, and spending hours
        doing nothing but twisting layers. Becoming frustrated, I tried to take
        my 5x5x5 apart in a similar manner to the 3x3x3, only to break about 4
        pieces in half. Now I don't have a "Legal" 5x5x5 cube, and I was hoping
        to practice with it for the upcoming 'Midwest Cube Tournament', headed
        by Jake Rueth on January 29th in the Chicago-IL area. My
        www.mefferts.com 5x5x5 cube was better 'Brand-New' than my
        www.rubiks.com cube, even after I had used my www.rubiks.com cube for
        over 5 months. Does rubiks.com sell decent 5x5x5 cubes yet? What kind of
        cubes are all you fast 5x5x5-ers using? Do you prefer the 1980's 'Wahn
        Cube' or the www.rubiks.com 5x5x5? What do you do to make your 5x5x5
        more suitable for speedcubing? Should I NOT use silicon for lubricating
        a rubiks.com 5x5x5? Why aren't the www.mefferts.com 5x5x5's allowed in
        speedcubing tournaments? Any help is good for me, Thanks

        Hey! It sounds very strange to me that u broke 4 pieces while taking ur
        cube apart. If u do this correctly turning top layer 45 degrees and then
        carefully prying out an edge triplet (or at least an outer edge) u
        should be fine. Never force out an edge from the 5x5x5 without turning
        top layer first. My rubiks.com 5x5x5 was also very stiff at first. I
        thought it would never become a speedcube. After a few weeks of breaking
        in and still stiff i decided i had to do something more drastic. So i
        did take it completely apart, no damage. And i inspected the cubicles
        for molding imperfections. I only found a few "points" worth flattening
        on some "+/centers". Then i lubed it properly and assembled it again.
        Then the cube was suddenly quite good and i started getting decent times
        with it. Down from like 7 minute solve to 4 1/2 minutes. I relubed it a
        few times after that first time also. And the cube got really nice. And
        i also improved my method so the times were even better. After about 3
        months of first lubing it it was actually a tad loose. I got occasional
        pops and quite a few "x/center" rotations. So i decided that i was gonna
        try improve it. i had discovered that my wahn cube had adjustable
        tension. While my rubiks.com didn't have that. So i came up with the
        idea of making a hybrid cube. Core/spindle from wahn and all the rest
        from my original rubiks.com. Now i think my hybrid cube is quite
        excellent. I can adjust tension whenever i want to. All i need to do is
        find the centers i want to adjust (usually tighten). Then carefully
        remove the centercap (with a stanley), adjust the screw and glue the
        centercap back on with a little superglue along 1 or 2 edges. Never glue
        all the way round. And make sure not to use too much. Make sure all
        layers still turn freely. Making a hybrid cube like this is expensive
        but it's worth it if u can afford it. The mefferts cube i got (old one
        from about 1998) also has adjustable centers. But i always get a
        "rattling" cube with it's cubicles. I prefer rubiks.com cubicles :-)
        Each cube is of coz unique so u might have a different experience. I
        would just like to mention that it is possible to successfully glue
        broken centers. Use for instance UHU superglue. Make sure the gap
        between head and foot is sufficient. Insert an edge on both sides to
        make sure. And use enough glue. Excess glue can be sanded down or
        removed with a sharp knife. Let it dry a few hours at least. Best of
        luck making ur own "super-5x5x5" :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        About hybrid cubes... my 3x3 is now a hybrid. It's got Studio Cube
        pieces and Ideal skeleton (arched centers! yay!). Works wonderfully.
        Also, I broke one of the center pieces on this once, and I glued it
        together. It works fine if the break is smooth enough, so that you can
        match the two pieces together perfectly. Oh yeah, Per, I think I "broke"
        your national 4x4 record twice sitting in the computer lab at school
        today. I got a couple of times about 1: 50. My Arxon 4x4 is turning

        Why not solve it back to the very mixed state that you started with?
        Thus, the solve starts with memorisation of the scrambled state. Sounds
        like a competition for the people who solves it blindfolded since they
        are used to memorise the cube. /Anders --- In

        Werid cases will indeed occur. You may construct more and more
        complicated methods but no method will ever be perfect. A nice thing
        with the median is that it is very simple, and according to my opinion,
        it is also a fair mesure. /Anders --- In

        253440 is really nothing for a computer, so a simple BFS starting from

        Hmm Eivind, National records are set during official competitions. If u
        are below 2 minutes it's excellent :-) I have in fact done it in 1:15.0
        seconds unofficially. Now my 4x4x4 is not so nice anymore. Too loose and
        a bit locking. I need a new and better one so that i can still compete

        &gt; &gt; It sounds very strange to me that u broke 4 pieces while
        taking ur &gt; &gt; cube apart. If u do this correctly turning top layer
        45 degrees and &gt; &gt; then carefully prying out an edge triplet (or
        at least an outer &gt; edge) &gt; &gt; u should be fine. Never force out
        an edge from the 5x5x5 without &gt; &gt; turning top layer first. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; My rubiks.com 5x5x5 was also very stiff at first. I
        thought it would &gt; &gt; never become a speedcube. After a few weeks
        of breaking in and still &gt; &gt; stiff i decided i had to do something
        more drastic. So i did take it &gt; &gt; completely apart, no damage.
        And i inspected the cubicles for &gt; molding &gt; &gt; imperfections. I
        only found a few "points" worth flattening on &gt; &gt; some
        "+/centers". Then i lubed it properly and assembled it again. &gt; &gt;
        Then the cube was suddenly quite good and i started getting decent &gt;
        &gt; times with it. Down from like 7 minute solve to 4 1/2 minutes. I
        &gt; &gt; relubed it a few times after that first time also. And the
        cube got &gt; &gt; really nice. And i also improved my method so the
        times were even &gt; &gt; better. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After about 3
        months of first lubing it it was actually a tad loose. &gt; &gt; I got
        occasional pops and quite a few "x/center" rotations. So i &gt; &gt;
        decided that i was gonna try improve it. i had discovered that my &gt;
        &gt; wahn cube had adjustable tension. While my rubiks.com didn't have
        &gt; &gt; that. So i came up with the idea of making a hybrid cube. &gt;
        &gt; Core/spindle from wahn and all the rest from my original
        rubiks.com. &gt; &gt; Now i think my hybrid cube is quite excellent. I
        can adjust tension &gt; &gt; whenever i want to. All i need to do is
        find the centers i want to &gt; &gt; adjust (usually tighten). Then
        carefully remove the centercap (with &gt; a &gt; &gt; stanley), adjust
        the screw and glue the centercap back on with a &gt; &gt; little
        superglue along 1 or 2 edges. Never glue all the way round. &gt; &gt;
        And make sure not to use too much. Make sure all layers still turn &gt;
        &gt; freely. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Making a hybrid cube like this is
        expensive but it's worth it if u &gt; &gt; can afford it. The mefferts
        cube i got (old one from about 1998) &gt; also &gt; &gt; has adjustable
        centers. But i always get a "rattling" cube with it's &gt; &gt;
        cubicles. I prefer rubiks.com cubicles :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Each cube
        is of coz unique so u might have a different experience. I &gt; &gt;
        would just like to mention that it is possible to successfully glue &gt;
        &gt; broken centers. Use for instance UHU superglue. Make sure the gap
        &gt; &gt; between head and foot is sufficient. Insert an edge on both
        sides to &gt; &gt; make sure. And use enough glue. Excess glue can be
        sanded down or &gt; &gt; removed with a sharp knife. Let it dry a few
        hours at least. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best of luck making ur own
        "super-5x5x5" :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Per &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---

        Hi Stefan, What I'm talking about is a way of looking at it. I'm
        speaking within the QTM. It's a matter of how you define "God's
        Algorithm." I think that within the 43 quintillion possible positions
        there may be an equal number of odd numbered scrambles and even numbered
        scrambles. And maybe they should be given consideration. There are
        several indicaters that we can separate algoritms into an "even
        numbered" class, and an "odd numbered" class. For example: often you can
        solve a position two different ways which are two moves apart like R2 B2
        R F R' B2R F' R and R' F2 U B U' F U B' U' F R. What *is* interesting
        that I have found sets of algoritms which are never 1 move apart. So if
        we say that there could be two definitions of "the longest scramble" an
        even numbered one and odd numbered one, then all the possibilities are
        included. In other words if say God's algoritm was said to be 23 moves
        there would be as many scrambles which would only take 22. There is a
        reason I'm making this distinction. One of the consequences is that
        scrambles in competitions should be both "even numbered" and "odd
        numbered" because otherwise roughly half of the possible positions would
        be excluded using QTM. And even using other metrics lots of
        possibilities could be unknowingly excluded. You could accidently
        exclude half of the possible scrambles and not know it. As far as I know
        this has never been taken into consideration in "random scrambles." :)

        Hi David, you do realize that two algorithms doing the same thing can
        *never* be 1 QTM move apart, right? Either I misunderstand you or those
        sets of algs you mentioned aren't really interesting (at least not for
        having no 1-distance pairs, maybe for something else ;-). There are
        indeed equally many "even" and "odd" states. Doing a U turn from an even
        state is an easy bijection to prove this. I don't think it has been
        considered in (competition) rules for scrambling, but I don't think
        that's necessary. The current rules (25 HTM scramble) already result in
        an almost 50% chance to get an even state. Also, I don't see how one
        would exploit it. Maybe in blindsolving because even states don't have
        the parity problem which makes them a bit easier than odd states. But
        again, it's almost 50-50 already anyway. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        it's really difficult to cube without your ring finger. If you just
        don't use it and move the cube with only your thumb, your pointer and
        your middle fingers on both hands, you find it hard to steady the cube.
        maybe we should have competitions for that and have each cubist's ring
        and pinky finger taped to their palms. is that okay?

        Hi! A random scramble regardless of it's length should have 50/50 chance
        of being odd/even. That is if u define ur scrambling algorithm such that
        there is equal chance of each possible number of steps a layer should be
        turned for each move. Also, only if the competitor/solver is given the
        scrambling algorithm, or inspects the cube long enough, will it be
        possible to deduce if it is in an even or odd state. This info could be
        used on larger cubes to avoid parity, as discussed previously by Chris
        Hardwick and others. Happy cubing! -Per PS! This odd/even is actually a
        bit more complicated than one would think. Consider a 5x5x5 professor
        cube. Applying U breaks down like this: Corners : odd Central edges :
        odd Outer edges : even middle centers : odd +/centers : odd x/centers :
        odd Applying u breaks down like this: Corners : no effect Central edges
        : no effect Outer edges : odd middle centers : no effect +/centers : odd
        x/centers : even (Applying E is equivalent to (Uu)(Dd) so everything
        will be even. ) On the basis of this one can calculate the chance of a
        random scramble being odd/even for the various types of cubicles listed.

        talking about is a way of looking at it. I'm speaking &gt; within the
        QTM. &gt; &gt; It's a matter of how you define "God's Algorithm." I
        think that &gt; within the 43 quintillion possible positions there may
        be an equal &gt; number of odd numbered scrambles and even numbered
        scrambles. And &gt; maybe they should be given consideration. &gt; &gt;
        There are several indicaters that we can separate algoritms into an &gt;
        "even numbered" class, and an "odd numbered" class. For example: often
        &gt; you can solve a position two different ways which are two moves
        apart &gt; like R2 B2 R F R' B2R F' R and R' F2 U B U' F U B' U' F R.
        What *is* &gt; interesting that I have found sets of algoritms which are
        never 1 move &gt; apart. &gt; &gt; So if we say that there could be two
        definitions of "the longest &gt; scramble" an even numbered one and odd
        numbered one, then all the &gt; possibilities are included. In other
        words if say God's algoritm was &gt; said to be 23 moves there would be
        as many scrambles which would only &gt; take 22. There is a reason I'm
        making this distinction. &gt; &gt; One of the consequences is that
        scrambles in competitions should be &gt; both "even numbered" and "odd
        numbered" because otherwise roughly half &gt; of the possible positions
        would be excluded using QTM. And even using &gt; other metrics lots of
        possibilities could be unknowingly excluded. You &gt; could accidently
        exclude half of the possible scrambles and not know &gt; it. As far as I
        know this has never been taken into consideration in &gt; "random
        scrambles." &gt; &gt; :) &gt; &gt; David J &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        I tried looking at this a little more rigorously and I agree. Here is
        what I came up with. A scrambling alg generator supposedly randomly
        picks moves from the number of possible moves on a cube. On the 2x2 and
        3x3 there are 18 moves; 36 moves for the 4x4 and 5x5, etc.. The possible
        turns on each face are two quarter turns and one double turn. Therefore
        the chance of a face turn being an odd permutation is 2/3 and the chance
        of the face turn being an even permutation is 1/3. If you do two turns
        the chance that the total permutation is even is 1/3*1/3 + 2/3*2/3 = 5/9
        If you do n turns then you can use coupled difference equations to see
        what the odds would be Let O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be the odds that
        after n turns the overall permutation is odd. Let
        E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be the odds that after n turns the overall
        permutation is even. Then O&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; =
        1/3*O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + 2/3*E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
        E&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1-O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; With
        E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=1/3 and O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=2/3 I wrote
        a short program to calculate some odds, and here is what I got. 1 turn
        Odd overall: 1/3 Even overall: 2/3 2 turns Odd overall: 4/9 Even
        overall: 5/9 3 turns Odd overall: 0.48148148148148 ~ 48.15% Even
        overall: 0.51851851851852 ~ 51.85% 5 turns Odd overall: 0.49931412894376
        ~ 49.93% Even overall: 0.50068587105624 ~ 50.07% 10 turns Odd overall:
        0.49999153245610 ~ 49.99% Even overall: 0.50000846754390 ~ 50.00% 25
        turns Odd overall: 0.49999999999980 ~ 49.99% Even overall:
        0.50000000000059 ~ 50.00% So yeah if you do a lot of turns the odds are
        so ridiculously close to 50-50 that I probably shouldn't have wasted my
        time doing this :) However I do think it's cool the way that this works
        out. I would have figured that the odds would work out differently since
        there are more possible odd permutations. Oh well, interesting stuff
        anyway. Also, one conclusion from this is that although the chance is
        nearly infinitesmal as n increases, you are still always more likely to
        get an even permutation over an odd permutation. Thought that was
        interesting and figured I would post it. Chris --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; What I'm talking about is a way of looking at it. I'm
        speaking &gt; &gt; within the QTM. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's a matter of
        how you define "God's Algorithm." I think that &gt; &gt; within the 43
        quintillion possible positions there may be an equal &gt; &gt; number of
        odd numbered scrambles and even numbered scrambles. And &gt; &gt; maybe
        they should be given consideration. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are
        several indicaters that we can separate algoritms into &gt; an &gt; &gt;
        "even numbered" class, and an "odd numbered" class. For example: &gt;
        often &gt; &gt; you can solve a position two different ways which are
        two moves &gt; apart &gt; &gt; like R2 B2 R F R' B2R F' R and R' F2 U B
        U' F U B' U' F R. What &gt; *is* &gt; &gt; interesting that I have found
        sets of algoritms which are never 1 &gt; move &gt; &gt; apart. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; So if we say that there could be two definitions of "the
        longest &gt; &gt; scramble" an even numbered one and odd numbered one,
        then all the &gt; &gt; possibilities are included. In other words if say
        God's algoritm &gt; was &gt; &gt; said to be 23 moves there would be as
        many scrambles which would &gt; only &gt; &gt; take 22. There is a
        reason I'm making this distinction. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the
        consequences is that scrambles in competitions should &gt; be &gt; &gt;
        both "even numbered" and "odd numbered" because otherwise roughly &gt;
        half &gt; &gt; of the possible positions would be excluded using QTM.
        And even &gt; using &gt; &gt; other metrics lots of possibilities could
        be unknowingly excluded. &gt; You &gt; &gt; could accidently exclude
        half of the possible scrambles and not know &gt; &gt; it. As far as I
        know this has never been taken into consideration in &gt; &gt; "random
        scrambles." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; David J &gt; &gt;

        Thanks Chris, that's exactly what I meant. I was just too lazy to
        compute it myself ;-) Btw, you don't need to do that coupling stuff,
        just say E_n+1 = 1/3 E_n + 2/3 (1 - E_n) or shorter E_n+1 = (2 - E_n) /
        3 Oh, and just because you made me more interested in this, I proved
        that the difference to 50% decreases by a factor of 1/3 with each move.
        So after 25 moves the error is 0.5*(1/3^25) which is
        0.00000000000059011769 confirming your 0.50000000000059 chance for odd
        after 25 moves. Now it's also easy to choose the difference and compute
        the number of moves necessary. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        a face turn being an odd permutation is 2/3 and the chance &gt; of the
        face turn being an even permutation is 1/3. &gt; &gt; If you do two
        turns the chance that the total permutation is even is &gt; 1/3*1/3 +
        2/3*2/3 = 5/9 &gt; &gt; If you do n turns then you can use coupled

        and O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=2/3 &gt; &gt; I wrote a short program to
        calculate some odds, and here is what I &gt; got. &gt; &gt; 1 turn &gt;
        Odd overall: 1/3 &gt; Even overall: 2/3 &gt; &gt; 2 turns &gt; Odd
        overall: 4/9 &gt; Even overall: 5/9 &gt; &gt; 3 turns &gt; Odd overall:
        0.48148148148148 ~ 48.15% &gt; Even overall: 0.51851851851852 ~ 51.85%
        &gt; &gt; &gt; 5 turns &gt; Odd overall: 0.49931412894376 ~ 49.93% &gt;
        Even overall: 0.50068587105624 ~ 50.07% &gt; &gt; &gt; 10 turns &gt; Odd

        49.99% &gt; Even overall: 0.50000000000059 ~ 50.00% &gt; &gt; So yeah if
        you do a lot of turns the odds are so ridiculously close &gt; to 50-50
        that I probably shouldn't have wasted my time doing &gt; this :) However
        I do think it's cool the way that this works out. &gt; I would have
        figured that the odds would work out differently since &gt; there are
        more possible odd permutations. Oh well, interesting &gt; stuff anyway.
        Also, one conclusion from this is that although the &gt; chance is
        nearly infinitesmal as n increases, you are still always &gt; more
        likely to get an even permutation over an odd permutation. &gt; &gt;

        Hey! I probably replied to the wrong post ... lol ... but not so
        important anyway ... Chris, u said that there are 18 possible moves on
        the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3. Well, this is basically true. For first move
        anyway. But whereas RL' does make sense on 3x3x3 it doesn't on the
        2x2x2. It will just be a physical move of the cube. So we get more
        cancellations on the 2x2x2 than on the 3x3x3. I took care of this when i
        wrote the scrambler available frfom the files section. -Per &gt; --- In

        LoL ok I feel slow now. Yeah if you do that then you can solve the
        relation for an explicit formula, Odd(n) = (1/6)*(-1/3)^n + 1/2 Even(n)
        = (1/2)-(1/6)*(-1/3)^n where n is the number of turns in your scrambling
        alg. Which of course tends to 1/2 for both as n goes to infinity.
        --------- Here is a result I found interesting too, although it is a big
        tangent to cube related stuff. If you take 0 &lt; a &lt; 1 and setup the
        same relation, A_n+1 = a*(1-A_n+1) + (1-a)*A_n with A_0=a and solve that
        for an explicit formula you get, A(n) = (a-1/2)*[(1-a)/(1+a)]^n + 1/2
        B(n) = 1-A(n) = 1/2 - (a-1/2)*[(1-a)/(1+a)]^n which both also tend to
        1/2 as n goes to infinity since (1-a)/(1+a) is less than 1. So the fact
        that the odds a face turn produces an odd permutation is 2/3, and 1/3
        for an even permutation, is not special. It could be the case that the
        odds for a face turn giving the cube some property are 1/1000000 and the
        odds against are 999999/1000000 and if you did a long enough scrambling
        alg it would still tend toward a 50-50 chance that the cube would either
        have that property or not. In fact it works for any odds as long as n
        tends to infinity. I guess it kinda makes more sense now, but still
        seems somewhat counter-intuitive. Math is so cool! Chris --- In

        I meant. I was just too lazy to &gt; compute it myself ;-) &gt; &gt;
        Btw, you don't need to do that coupling stuff, just say &gt; E_n+1 = 1/3
        E_n + 2/3 (1 - E_n) &gt; or shorter &gt; E_n+1 = (2 - E_n) / 3 &gt; &gt;
        Oh, and just because you made me more interested in this, I proved &gt;
        that the difference to 50% decreases by a factor of 1/3 with each &gt;
        move. So after 25 moves the error is 0.5*(1/3^25) which is &gt;
        0.00000000000059011769 &gt; confirming your &gt; 0.50000000000059 &gt;
        chance for odd after 25 moves. &gt; &gt; Now it's also easy to choose
        the difference and compute the number of &gt; moves necessary. &gt; &gt;

        a lot of turns the odds are so ridiculously &gt; close &gt; &gt; to
        50-50 that I probably shouldn't have wasted my time doing &gt; &gt; this
        :) However I do think it's cool the way that this works &gt; out. &gt;
        &gt; I would have figured that the odds would work out differently &gt;
        since &gt; &gt; there are more possible odd permutations. Oh well,
        interesting &gt; &gt; stuff anyway. Also, one conclusion from this is
        that although the &gt; &gt; chance is nearly infinitesmal as n
        increases, you are still always &gt; &gt; more likely to get an even
        permutation over an odd permutation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thought that
        was interesting and figured I would post it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris

        looking at this a little more rigorously and I agree. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is what I came up with. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; A scrambling alg generator supposedly randomly picks moves from
        &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; number of possible moves on a cube. On the
        2x2 and 3x3 there are &gt; &gt; 18 &gt; &gt; &gt; moves; 36 moves for
        the 4x4 and 5x5, etc.. The possible turns on &gt; &gt; &gt; each face
        are two quarter turns and one double turn. Therefore &gt; &gt; the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; chance of a face turn being an odd permutation is 2/3 and the
        &gt; &gt; chance &gt; &gt; &gt; of the face turn being an even
        permutation is 1/3. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you do two turns
        the chance that the total permutation is even &gt; &gt; is &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 1/3*1/3 + 2/3*2/3 = 5/9 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you do n
        turns then you can use coupled difference equations &gt; to &gt; &gt;
        &gt; see what the odds would be &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let
        O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be the odds that after n turns the overall
        &gt; &gt; &gt; permutation is odd. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let
        E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be the odds that after n turns the overall
        &gt; &gt; &gt; permutation is even. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then
        O&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/3*O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; +
        2/3*E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;
        = 1-O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With
        E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=1/3 and O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=2/3 &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wrote a short program to calculate some odds,
        and here is what &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; got. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; 1 turn &gt; &gt; &gt; Odd overall: 1/3 &gt; &gt; &gt; Even overall:
        2/3 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2 turns &gt; &gt; &gt; Odd overall:
        4/9 &gt; &gt; &gt; Even overall: 5/9 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3
        turns &gt; &gt; &gt; Odd overall: 0.48148148148148 ~ 48.15% &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Even overall: 0.51851851851852 ~ 51.85% &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5 turns &gt; &gt; &gt; Odd overall: 0.49931412894376
        ~ 49.93% &gt; &gt; &gt; Even overall: 0.50068587105624 ~ 50.07% &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10 turns &gt; &gt; &gt; Odd
        overall: 0.49999153245610 ~ 49.99% &gt; &gt; &gt; Even overall:
        0.50000846754390 ~ 50.00% &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        25 turns &gt; &gt; &gt; Odd overall: 0.49999999999980 ~ 49.99% &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Even overall: 0.50000000000059 ~ 50.00% &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; So yeah if you do a lot of turns the odds are so ridiculously &gt;
        &gt; close &gt; &gt; &gt; to 50-50 that I probably shouldn't have wasted
        my time doing &gt; &gt; &gt; this :) However I do think it's cool the
        way that this works &gt; &gt; out. &gt; &gt; &gt; I would have figured
        that the odds would work out differently &gt; &gt; since &gt; &gt; &gt;
        there are more possible odd permutations. Oh well, interesting &gt; &gt;
        &gt; stuff anyway. Also, one conclusion from this is that although &gt;
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; chance is nearly infinitesmal as n increases, you are
        still &gt; always &gt; &gt; &gt; more likely to get an even permutation
        over an odd permutation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thought that was
        interesting and figured I would post it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi Stefan, You wrote, &gt; you do realize that two algorithms doing the
        same thing can *never* be 1 QTM move apart, right? &lt; I suspected as
        much but hadn't thought it through. But that's my point anyway you can't
        solve the "longest" scrambles with the same number of moves beacause an
        even number of turns can't solve odd scrambles and vice versa. &gt;
        Either I misunderstand you or those sets of algs you mentioned aren't
        really interesting (at least not for having no 1-distance pairs, maybe
        for something else ;-). &lt; Oops, I posted the wrong algs! Those two
        are an example of having a different number of turns HTM but the same
        QTM. I meant to post a pair like (I use small case to mean slice move
        only): r2 D f2 D' f' u2 f - 10 QTM and R U2 R' U' F' L' U' L F2 U R U' R
        F' - 16 QTM. &gt; There are indeed equally many "even" and "odd" states.
        Doing a U turn from an even state is an easy bijection to prove this.
        &lt; I wonder whether the most scrambled state is an even number of
        turns or an odd one. So until it is determined, God's Algorithm remains
        "either an odd or even number of turns" - which is what I was getting
        at. For a contest after the HTM scrambles are arrived at, each could be
        counted and have an QTM number. Close to half even and half odd QTM
        would be fair. Yes, blindsolving would be affected, especially with the
        4x4x4 where parity is based on a half turn. Regards, David J --- In

        but I don't think that's necessary. The current rules (25 &gt; HTM
        scramble) already result in an almost 50% chance to get an even &gt;
        state. Also, I don't see how one would exploit it. Maybe in &gt;
        blindsolving because even states don't have the parity problem which
        &gt; makes them a bit easier than odd states. But again, it's almost 50-
        50 &gt; already anyway. &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt; ---

        &gt; &gt; What I'm talking about is a way of looking at it. I'm speaking
        &gt; &gt; within the QTM. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's a matter of how you
        define "God's Algorithm." I think that &gt; &gt; within the 43
        quintillion possible positions there may be an equal &gt; &gt; number of
        odd numbered scrambles and even numbered scrambles. And &gt; &gt; maybe
        they should be given consideration. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are
        several indicaters that we can separate algoritms into &gt; an &gt; &gt;
        "even numbered" class, and an "odd numbered" class. For example: &gt;
        often &gt; &gt; you can solve a position two different ways which are
        two moves &gt; apart &gt; &gt; like R2 B2 R F R' B2R F' R and R' F2 U B
        U' F U B' U' F R. What &gt; *is* &gt; &gt; interesting that I have found
        sets of algoritms which are never 1 &gt; move &gt; &gt; apart. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; So if we say that there could be two definitions of "the
        longest &gt; &gt; scramble" an even numbered one and odd numbered one,
        then all the &gt; &gt; possibilities are included. In other words if say
        God's algoritm &gt; was &gt; &gt; said to be 23 moves there would be as
        many scrambles which would &gt; only &gt; &gt; take 22. There is a
        reason I'm making this distinction. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the
        consequences is that scrambles in competitions should &gt; be &gt; &gt;
        both "even numbered" and "odd numbered" because otherwise roughly &gt;
        half &gt; &gt; of the possible positions would be excluded using QTM.
        And even &gt; using &gt; &gt; other metrics lots of possibilities could
        be unknowingly excluded. &gt; You &gt; &gt; could accidently exclude
        half of the possible scrambles and not know &gt; &gt; it. As far as I
        know this has never been taken into consideration in &gt; &gt; "random
        scrambles." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; David J

        Hey folks... I emailed Jessica Fridrich, she was friendly enough to
        reply :-) Actually, she said that I could find some good help here.
        Anyway, I'm both new to Yahoo groups and new to Cubing. I learned to
        solve for the first time 3 months ago, and 4 days later I could do it
        from memory... then it took off. As of a few days ago my best times were
        between 56-59 seconds... doing the layer by layer method (though Im in
        the process of learning Jessica's algorithms). So I'm looking for a few
        things here... we'll start off with 2 to break the ice. 1. Are there any
        sub 30's people in the NorthWest? (I'm in Eugene, Oregon) 2. I ordered a
        cube diy kit from rubiks.com, and it looks sweet, but I can't seem to
        get it right. Has anyone built one that would be willing to walk me
        through the best methods... it came with no instruction manual, and so I
        ventured into it on my own, and can't really get springrates correct or
        anything like that. It's either really tight, or really loose (like I
        can grab the L and R faces, and pull the cube apart). Thanks guys (and

        Hi guys. Does anyone know of a site that has a timer program for rubiks
        that is able to save sessions to an XLS. I already hace Chris Hunt's
        program but I'm more comfortable storing it in XLS than on a TXT file.
        And its a lot of work to import it into XLS since you have to do a lot
        of things to convert the numbers to time.

        Hi, I'm from Boise, ID, which I guess qualifies as Northwest. I am sub
        20. Good luck with the DIY kit. Im not sure that I like them much.. You
        can look at Jon Morris' site which has some pictures and a short
        tutorial on how to assemble the cube. Frank Jordan Beckett

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey folks... &gt; &gt; I emailed Jessica Fridrich, she
        was friendly enough to reply :-) &gt; Actually, she said that I could
        find some good help here. Anyway, &gt; I'm both new to Yahoo groups and
        new to Cubing. I learned to solve &gt; for the first time 3 months ago,
        and 4 days later I could do it from &gt; memory... then it took off.
        &gt; &gt; As of a few days ago my best times were between 56-59
        seconds... &gt; doing the layer by layer method (though Im in the
        process of &gt; learning Jessica's algorithms). &gt; &gt; So I'm looking
        for a few things here... we'll start off with 2 to &gt; break the ice.
        &gt; &gt; 1. Are there any sub 30's people in the NorthWest? (I'm in
        Eugene, &gt; Oregon) &gt; 2. I ordered a cube diy kit from rubiks.com,
        and it looks sweet, but &gt; I can't seem to get it right. Has anyone
        built one that would be &gt; willing to walk me through the best
        methods... it came with no &gt; instruction manual, and so I ventured
        into it on my own, and can't &gt; really get springrates correct or
        anything like that. It's either &gt; really tight, or really loose (like
        I can grab the L and R faces, &gt; and pull the cube apart). &gt; &gt;

        Hey Guys! I've been hearing from some awesome people here in the

        have it tight and secure, so it feels like it won't pop? Then should I
        expect lube to solve the hard motion? Or... should I leave it loose and

        File name is RubikCubeTimeSheet.xls Also a couple of Questions /
        suggestions. I dont know if anyone else notice this or not on the
        NetCube but, sometimes the scambling algo wrap down a line when
        displayed but sometimes not. Is this because of the font on my computer?
        I know this is pushing it but, is it possible that the personal best
        time and personal best average be stored and displayed when the program
        is executed? Just to have a target time to beat when doing a session.
        Just like in the Ultimate Rubik's Cube Timer. I hope you can help me.

        Hey! That is all ur choice depending upon ur cubing technique. If u use
        lots of fingertricks it needs be a bit loose. On the other side, too
        loose and it is more prone to pop pieces. It will take a while for u to
        find out the proper tension for U. U need a cube that suits u regardless
        how other ppl finf ur cube ... hehe ... ;-) Best of luck :-) -Cubix &gt;

        I also had some trouble understanding those algs. I ended up finding the
        numbers myself, going backwards from solved state and trying to get the
        displayed shapes. You can also optimize them, for example instead of
        (-3,6) do (3,0) and proceed appropriately (i.e. as if you had rotated
        the puzzle by y2). Cheers! Stefan --- In

        The F2L is in my opinion a bit more weighted. My advice would be to

        Hey Jordan, When I built my DIY kits I tightened the screws until the
        gap between the center-pieces and the spindles were about 1/16". I like
        my cubes a little tight. This seemed to work well on both of mine, but

        I have mine pretty loose. I spent about 15 minutes spinning the
        sticker-less cube adjusting springs with a screw driver... i basically
        have mine loose enough to be able to spin it without much effort at all,
        but not so loose that I could get it to pop... if that made any sense.
        Basically it's just tight enough to keep from popping when I am moving
        my quickest/most aggressively. I keep over shooting, as I do my first
        few solves (i just finish gluing the center pieces about 20 minutes
        ago... between classes and work. However, I don't have to use my wrists
        as much in moving the pieces now. I'm pretty stoked, it's a sweet cube
        (from the very few that I've tried I like this the best). Now it's on to
        build technique. Any suggestions on how to hold the cube? Ways to move
        each face, which fingers to use, and whatnot? Im at that "cube
        orientation movement" stage... I'd like to get out of that, it wastes a
        lot of time. I'm open to suggestions... Jordan (Eugene, Oregon) --- In

        Hello, This message was originally meant for the Lars Petrus' mailgroup,
        but it doesn't seem to be that active, so I'm giving this mailgroup the
        same questions. It's about the Petrus' method, and more precise, the
        index of step 6+7. You can find it at http://lar5.com/cube/xMain.html.
        Here's the original message, any help is appreciated: "Hello, I'm not
        sure if this mailgroup is still active, but I need some help so I'll
        give it a try. I'm struggling with memorizing the step 6+7 index. This
        far I've ran into two problems that stop me from proceeding, namely the
        arrows that indicate edge movement and the placements of the corners. My
        english is far too bad to explain this in an understandable way, but
        I'll give it a try: Problem 1: The arrows indicate how the edges are
        suppose to move, although the examples shown are not all movements
        possible. For instance, some "circle" moves can also be moved in the
        other way (mirrored I think you call it). In D7,
        http://lar5.com/cube/xD.html, that triangle of arrows can also be in the
        other direction. Problem 2: The thing you look for when reaching step
        6+7 is the corner placement. Take the B-section for example
        (http://lar5.com/oldcube/xB.html). One corner is correct, the one were
        the black facelet is turned upwards. (on the site). The rest of the
        corners have their black facelets incorrect. These facelets can also be
        twisted in another way (I guess this is the mirrored version aswell).
        The questions are how I'm suppose to solve these problems. Is it just a
        matter of targeting? How should I think to get an understanding? Hope
        you understood some part of this post, and if not, I'll get a
        dictionary. /Tommy Sellberg" /Tommy Sellberg [Non-text portions of this

        It doesn't take long to learn the sequence, but it's hard to go faster.
        If you go too fast you knock the pyramids over, but if you don't go fast
        enough you don't get a good time. So part of the balance is finding that
        "slow-fast" speed where you can still get a fast time but not knock the
        cups over. That's why I think it helps for the cube, since going
        "slow-fast" is still very important. As for finding cups, I got mine off
        eBay for about 1/2 the price as they charge on the site. They don't seem
        to be on there too often, but it is a good deal when they are. Koen,
        Justin and others you really should try it! The cups may seem expensive,
        but it is fun to do and helps for the cube too. Chris --- In

        Hi, if someone has a nice sequence for the following situation I would
        be grateful. The one I use now is really awkward. I first solve by
        putting together all centers and then pair up all edges (like most of
        you I guess). When I'm pairing up the last edges, I'm sometimes left
        with what seems to be only two outer edges that have swapped positions.
        Think of the "image" below as the top layer viewed from above. I want to
        create nice ZZZ and YYY rows so that all is left is now solving as a
        3x3x3. Also, the ZZY and YYZ does not have to be in that particular
        relative postition to one another. If you have a sequnce which is
        similar with another setup, it's almost as good. XZZYX ACCCB ACCCB ACCCB

        My method is likely not the best, but here's how I approach it: I hold
        the cube so that this is the front face XBBBX ZCCCZ ZCCCY YCCCY XAAAX
        Then I perform: (U u) F U' F' U L' U L (u' U') That should get you to
        the state where one edge needs a parity fixing move performed on it. Not
        the most efficient method I'm sure, but that's what I've always used.

        hey guys, i've been working on this east coast competition, and here's
        what i've got so far. i found out i can reserve the hoff theatre (which
        is the movie theatre at our student union), but to do that i need to be
        reserving it for a club. thus, i am in the process of starting the
        "Maryland Speedcubing Group". if i get 25 students from UMD to join, i
        can get funding from the student government association. this would
        allow me to buy 4 stackmats with the tournament displays, trophies, etc.
        i am thinking of setting the tournament date sometime in the spring,
        around march or april. a more definite date will be set once this club
        gets started. i will try to keep you east-coasters updated as more
        information develops. -Chris Parlette

        In most cases, the parentheticals are simply finger tricks. That is
        those specific groups of moves are done with triggers and such to
        execute the whole algorithm faster. One or two blindfolded solving pages
        use parenthesis in a different context, but generally it's the above

        Hey everyone, I just got my rubiks.com 5x5x5's in the mail today and

        half ago (spaced out by around a month or so) and both were not very
        good cubes at all. The center pieces were malformed or something and
        were very uneven when you looked across a face. Also for both cubes,
        after I lubed them once they would explode after only 30-40 moves of a
        solve. Well the ones I just got are very, very nice by comparison! I
        can't wait till these break in. Anyway I had talked in the past about
        how I didn't like the rubiks.com 5x5's, or at least the older ones, but
        these newer ones are really nice. I would recommend them. Chris

        I think the SAT's are more of a coastal thing, around here all you need
        is the ACT scores and maybe one or two of the SAT II subject tests. (all
        I needed anyway) I'll warn you now though... I recall a few times where
        the group didn't respond all too kindly to discussion of an "objective
        measure of intelligents" such as IQ tests and the like. This may be
        treated in the same manner (just a friendly heads up). I don't quite

        doesn't require mathematical ability (then again perhaps the SAT

        impressed :) I bought two 5x5's from them about a year and a half &gt;
        ago (spaced out by around a month or so) and both were not very good
        &gt; cubes at all. The center pieces were malformed or something and
        &gt; were very uneven when you looked across a face. Also for both &gt;
        cubes, after I lubed them once they would explode after only 30-40 &gt;
        moves of a solve. &gt; &gt; Well the ones I just got are very, very nice
        by comparison! I can't &gt; wait till these break in. &gt; &gt; Anyway I
        had talked in the past about how I didn't like the &gt; rubiks.com
        5x5's, or at least the older ones, but these newer ones &gt; are really
        nice. I would recommend them. &gt; &gt; Chris

        Not really. What was aggressive? I'm just asking some questions. I'm not
        trying to make anyone feel bad. I can't see that there's anything
        aggressive about being curious as to the question. All I'm saying is
        that if some sort of correlation is sought (and that seemed to be the
        case) and in a mathematical sense (and that also seemed to be the case
        given that maths was mentioned) then one has to consider the sort of
        correlation that one wants to use. For instance, for a ranked
        correlation configuration one wouldn't need to know the times of the
        cubists, just who was best, who was next best and so forth, but for a
        product-moment correlation coefficient you'd actually need the times.
        (In any event, you'd want to ask "What is your (SAT score, best time)"?
        Now, the latter statistic - best time - is probably fairly well
        tabulated for many people around here so it might be sufficient just to
        collect the scores. (Possibly "best average" instead of "best time" - of
        course, then one could go into what kind of average: arithmetic mean,
        geometric mean, harmonic mean, root-mean-square etc., but you'd probably
        detest me for that.) It's just a question of asking what is being looked
        for. The latter part was just a statement of opinion. It's not trying to
        say anything about stupidity or anything like that - in fact, I just
        said that I doubted there'd be a correlation. That's hardly saying that
        it's a stupid question. If I'd been of that mind, I wouldn't have used
        the word doubt. All I'm saying is that, personally, I can't see why
        there'd be a connection. It's perhaps like chess. There are many
        excellent chess players who aren't good at maths - e.g. Nigel Short -
        and vice versa. To be good at chess requires some kind of ability but
        not necessarily mathematical. I'd imagine the same goes for (speed)
        cubing. It requires certain abilities (dexterity, pattern recognition
        and so forth), but nothing really mathematical. I'd go as far as to say
        that I don't think mathematical ability is necessary to do the cube well
        and that being good at maths doesn't mean you can do the cube well.
        Trying to make a connection is not stupid, but I would question why try
        to make that connection - as opposed to say a connection between cubing
        and another dexterous activity (as in juggling (Macky), cup stacking
        (Chris) etc.). (In-depth) theory of the cube can involve some
        mathematical ability - after all it's just a study of a particular group
        and set of generators, but I don't know if any of the people who look
        into cube theory are really fast. (Of course, I don't actually know
        anybody who does cube theory, so I'm not particularly well-informed.)
        Even if they are, it's unlikely that their theory has much connection
        with their speed. Your post is more aggressive - it contains swearing,
        accusation and has no foundation in fact. The only thing that might be
        objectionable is the "geeks" part, but if that's the case then I'm being
        self-effacing as much as anything (not that I'm claiming to have cube
        skills). &gt; &gt; &gt; What kind of correlation are you trying to look
        for? &gt; &gt; What statistic is it? &gt; &gt; Spearman's ranked
        correlation coefficient? &gt; &gt; Pearson's product-moment correlation
        coefficient? &gt; &gt; Kendall's coefficient of concordance? (Not
        exactly &gt; &gt; what you're after, &gt; &gt; I suppose.) &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Are you looking for a linear correlation? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I'd douby there is much of a link (other than &gt; &gt; indirectly
        through some &gt; &gt; related thing like "geeks do maths, geeks spend
        time &gt; &gt; on the cube") &gt; &gt; because bein fast at the cube

        &gt; &gt; What statistic is it? &gt; &gt; Spearman's ranked correlation
        coefficient? &gt; &gt; Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient?
        &gt; &gt; Kendall's coefficient of concordance? (Not exactly &gt; &gt;
        what you're after, &gt; &gt; I suppose.) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are you
        looking for a linear correlation? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd douby there is
        much of a link (other than &gt; &gt; indirectly through some &gt; &gt;
        related thing like "geeks do maths, geeks spend time &gt; &gt; on the
        cube") &gt; &gt; because bein fast at the cube really doesn't require
        &gt; &gt; mathematical &gt; &gt; ability (then again perhaps the SAT
        doesn't?). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; I'd doubt there is much of a link (other than indirectly through
        some &gt; related thing like "geeks do maths, geeks spend time on the

        there's a link. The one called "determination". People practicing
        excessively just to become faster solving the cube might be the same
        people preparing excessively for tests like SAT. In any case, I think it
        would make more sense to not only ask a small extreme group. Some
        "normal" people should be asked, too. Then we could compare
        speedcuber-yes/no to goodAtSAT-yes/no. Maybe that was the original
        intent for asking? Maybe he has asked another group of people as well?
        Although asking this way gets you bad data, since people with different
        SAT results will differ in their enthusiasm to tell them. Cheers! Stefan

        Lemme first say that you guys have been a great help. I've been having
        so much fun learning new algorithms, and trying to solve the puzzle
        smarter, not faster. Could someone do me a favor and solve the cube
        really slowly? Like only 1 to 2 moves per second, slowing down all
        triggers and what not? I am trying to get out of the habit of spinning
        the cube to look around; Im trying to learn to solve the cube from the
        same orientation all the way through. I have a lot of trouble moving the
        B face without moving my thumbs... and then when I do, I think i must be
        doing something wrong. I know Im quite terrible at solving the cube, but
        Im going make a video of me solving solely for the purpose of getting
        feedback from experienced solvers and getting tips. But if I could see
        you guys solve the cube slowly, that would be great. Actually, I see
        videos of the last layer, so forget that, stop before the last layer if

        Hi, I put a video on the internet, it is a slow replay of a solve which
        was 16.12 seconds, ie I went back to the same scramble and did the same
        thing that I did when going for speed. I point to each corner/edge pair
        before I solve them. I don't think it matters too much if you rotate, as
        long as the rotation is part of a move so you can keep moving through
        the solution fluently and quickly. The video is at

        The things in the parenthisis are called finger shortcuts or tricks.
        (R'UR) can for example be done very rapidly if you click the upper layer

        Holy crap, Dan, you slow solve it quicker than I can "speed" solve it.
        hahaha, i'll take a look at it more indepth after school and work.

        video on the internet, it is a slow replay of a solve which was 16.12
        seconds, ie I went back to the same scramble and did the same thing that
        I did when going for speed. I point to each corner/edge pair before I
        solve them. &gt; &gt; I don't think it matters too much if you rotate,
        as long as the rotation is part of a move so you can keep moving through
        the solution fluently and quickly. &gt; &gt; The video is at

        &gt; &gt; Lemme first say that you guys have been a great help. I've
        been &gt; having so much fun learning new algorithms, and trying to
        solve the &gt; puzzle smarter, not faster. &gt; &gt; Could someone do me
        a favor and solve the cube really slowly? Like &gt; only 1 to 2 moves
        per second, slowing down all triggers and what &gt; not? I am trying to
        get out of the habit of spinning the cube to &gt; look around; Im trying
        to learn to solve the cube from the same &gt; orientation all the way
        through. I have a lot of trouble moving the &gt; B face without moving
        my thumbs... and then when I do, I think i &gt; must be doing something
        wrong. I know Im quite terrible at solving &gt; the cube, but Im going
        make a video of me solving solely for the &gt; purpose of getting
        feedback from experienced solvers and getting &gt; tips. But if I could
        see you guys solve the cube slowly, that would &gt; be great. Actually,
        I see videos of the last layer, so forget that, &gt; stop before the
        last layer if you like... what I REALLY need to see &gt; is the F2L done
        slowly. &gt; &gt; Thanks to anyone who can help. &gt; &gt; Jordan &gt;

        Hi everyone, A fantastic FMC this week, several successful solutions
        under 30 moves were posted, and we had an amazing 3 winners, and 5 first
        places were given out! Charles, how you only got 6th place in the STM
        category with 29 moves is unbelievable! SO check out the results on my
        site - www.cubestation.co.uk , and have a go next week, I shall release
        the scramble later on this evening :) DanH :) [Non-text portions of this

        A while back I mentioned here that Uwe Meffert is thinking about
        reproducing the Dogic. There was not much interest here (but at
        twistypuzzles.com we're very excited), but I'd like to give you an
        update anyway. They might start production early December, more details
        and discussion can be found here:
        http://www.twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3191 I'm particularly
        interested in it because of the complexity, 2.1*10^82 positions, even
        more than the 5x5, which has 2.8*10^74 positions (thanks to Jaap for the
        numbers). Cheers! Stefan

        Lemme first say that you guys have been a great help. I've been
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; having so much fun learning new algorithms, and trying
        to solve &gt;&gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; puzzle smarter, not faster.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Could someone do me a favor and solve
        the cube really slowly? &gt;&gt;&gt; Like &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only 1 to 2
        moves per second, slowing down all triggers and what &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        not? I am trying to get out of the habit of spinning the cube &gt; to
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; look around; Im trying to learn to solve the cube from
        the same &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; orientation all the way through. I have a lot
        of trouble moving &gt;&gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; B face without
        moving my thumbs... and then when I do, I think i &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; must
        be doing something wrong. I know Im quite terrible at &gt;&gt;&gt;
        solving &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the cube, but Im going make a video of me
        solving solely for the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; purpose of getting feedback from
        experienced solvers and getting &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tips. But if I could
        see you guys solve the cube slowly, that &gt;&gt;&gt; would
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be great. Actually, I see videos of the last layer, so
        forget &gt;&gt;&gt; that, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stop before the last layer if
        you like... what I REALLY need to &gt;&gt;&gt; see &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
        the F2L done slowly. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks to anyone
        who can help. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jordan &gt;&gt;&gt;

        buffer..then to the one thats in where that needs to go..but then
        eventually ill get to the edge peice that is supposed to go where the
        buffer is.. so how do i note this..and what peice do i next..(this is

        I got my F2L algorithms from Jess Bonde's site at www.rubiks.dk but I
        figured out all the finger tricks on my own so a lot of them can be

        I memorize them by how they feel. (I'm a musician, it's almost like

        ok i still dont get my last message..but ive been trying to understand
        other parts and realized i dont really get the setup moves..i was trying
        to do the cube using your method and almost everytime i would place a
        edge, it would be flipped. that is because im using the wrong setup
        moves...how do you know which setup moves to use..cause the difference
        between FR and RF are slim..and then to know a different alg for each
        one how do you do that part? (and i still need to know about my last

        yo dude :-) Thanks for the feedback. I'm already in the process of
        improving the page and I'll try to cover your questions better in the
        next version. &gt; i was &gt; trying to do the cube using your method
        and almost everytime i would &gt; place a edge, it would be flipped.
        &gt; &gt; that is because im using the wrong setup moves...how do you
        know which &gt; setup moves to use..cause the difference between FR and
        RF are &gt; slim Instead of thinking of the cubie, think about the
        *sticker*. Think about the T-permutation alg. It shoots the UR edge to
        UL. Think of this as the U sticker of UR going to the U sticker place of
        UL. And for FR, think about its F sticker and for RF, think about its R
        sticker. So for FR, you need to bring its F sticker to the U of UL.
        Setup (d2 L) will do this. For RF, the R sticker needs to go to the U of
        UL. Setup (d' L') will do. Follow the sticker, not the cubie. Does that
        help? I'm so much used to it that I forgot to explain it. &gt; when i
        was trying to &gt; plan out the edge swaps on a different scramble then
        the one on your &gt; site.. i go through each color, starting with the
        one in the &gt; buffer..then to the one thats in where that needs to
        go..but then &gt; eventually ill get to the edge peice that is supposed
        to go where the &gt; buffer is.. so how do i note this..and what peice
        do i next.. When you find the buffer cubie somewhere, ignore it. That
        just means you've completed the first cycle. After that you'll have to
        do the remaining cycles, one by one (unless you're lucky and there's
        only one cycle, containing all wrong edges). For each cycle, you first
        have to "break it open". That means you have to add the place of an
        unsolved cubie to the sequence you memorize. Immediately followed by the
        edge cubie in that place. Have a look at my example again, in particular
        the step where I first say "Exception" and the next step. So for each
        cycle, you memorize something like (A B C D A), the first item being the
        same as the last. Just the first cycle, the one that starts with the
        buffer, would look like (B C D) instead, simply leaving out the A=buffer
        at start and end. I once emailed a better example to someone... will
        include this in the next version of my page. Thanks, Stefan

        Recently I started really practicing the 4x4 and I'd like to compare
        some times to other people. I turn it into a 3x3, first centers, then
        pair up edges. An average (17.66) for only solving centers: 17.61 18.13
        18.34 (14.81) 17.85 18.33 15.88 18.18 17.37 17.04 17.88 (18.64) An
        average (58.64) for only solving centers and pairing edges: 1:05.46
        1:04.50 53.03 1:05.48 51.18 (1:14.34) 1:02.96 51.77 54.75 (50. 74) 57.34
        59.89 Note that these were 24 solves, i.e. the first average has nothing
        to do with the second. My best regular average for 4x4 is 1:33, btw. I'm
        just trying to find out where I "lose" the most time (compared to
        others). So, what are your times for this? Cheers! Stefan

        thanks for the compliments. the answers to the questions that have been
        asked are on the mission designs website. i have considered making a
        video of using the timer. i was not sure if there was enough interest
        yet to warrant spending the time to convert an analog video to mpeg2. if
        there is enough interest i can take a couple hours and record myself
        using it to time myself solving, and maybe walk through some of the
        options, then convert to mpeg2 and post it online. be warned though that
        i'm a much better engineer than speed solver... :) my general average is
        usually around 30 seconds. take care, eric --- In

        ok..when do you think the next version will be out cause i still dont
        really get how to think about it when i get to the buffer cubie..cause

        Okay, I've had my break now since organizing the fall tournament but
        it's time to get back into business. What do people think about a
        tournament in Northern California in the city of Burlingame on Saturday,
        January 15, 2005? (I hope that date is a Saturday... I mean for it to be
        on a Saturday.) It's a long weekend so I'm hoping maybe some of the
        Southern California people would be willing to drive up. I myself will
        probably drive and I'll probably have room for one person... I will
        begin contacting various locations for a possible venue tomorrow after I
        hopefully survive an orienteering course tomorrow. I'm thinking of the
        Burlingame Public Library in particular. There are other venues in the
        bay area as well. Ideally, I'd like at least 10 people to compete in
        this tournament so please respond to this (on the caltech group as to
        save clutter) if you're interested so I know whether to have a cube
        tournament or whether to have a cube gathering. On another note, work is
        being done on the Caltech winter tournament. More news on that later.

      <div class="email-content">
        Hi Group. This post is long, but it's important. It's obvious that the
        quality of Rubik's brand puzzles have been getting better lately. We
        keep hearing about the Rubik's Revenge getting better, and now lately
        even the Professor's Cube. In the midst of these improvements, are
        manufacturing errors still occuring? Yes, of course. Faulty products are
        going to happen, as no manufacturing process is going to be completely
        perfect. The concern is not that accidents are happening, but the way in
        which these accidents are being handled by the company. Sometimes with
        big companies, certain customer interests are infringed upon. These
        interests may include, and are not limited to: Unfair prices, faulty
        products, poor customer service, et cetera. How does the Rubik's brand
        hold up against our interests? The short answer is, very well. The
        prices are fair. Faulty products don't occur often enough to raise
        concern. I bought a few Rubik's 3x3x3s this summer. Each one was newer,
        with the serial numbers on the corner. One of the cubes turned horribly
        out of the package. It turned out that during the manufacturing process
        a terrible error had occured. The plastic on the axel was contorted
        slightly. I attempted to fix the error by sanding down the plastic,
        lubing the cube, and hoping the problem would wear itself out naturally.
        After about a month of use the cube had not improved much, if at all. Of
        course by this time, it was too late to return a cube to Wal-Mart.
        Instead of launching a search for a replacement cube, I decided to
        search for some valuable answers. Why did this error occur? How often
        does this error occur? I've directed these questions to a Seven Town's
        Representative, and in return I didn't recieve answers to my most
        important questions. Naturally this is frustrating, and the burden of
        dealing with this issue raised some new questions. If the 9$ I spent
        only bought a mess of plastic, was I really just paying for an
        inconvenience? How important is it to keep a customer happy? Customers
        in general must be kept happy, but the individual may not hold the same
        bearing. The responsibility lies on the company to produce a quality
        product. As customers, faulty products are annoying, they are
        frustrating, and they are not what we paid for. When we do have to deal
        with this issue, it only adds to the frustration when our questions are
        not being answered. Because when we buy a bad product, our money should
        at least pay for an explanation. The misjudgement was not returning the
        puzzle right away upon discovering its defect, but you really have to
        ask yourself; is this something we should have to deal with in the first
        place? It shouldn't be a gamble when it comes to buying a product,
        regardless of that product's nature.

        i figured out what you need to add to your Example or make a new
        example, where you provide the scramble alg...and then before turning
        any faces..tell us the each color of the cycle and how your getting it..

        &gt; &gt; Thanks for the feedback. I'm already in the process of
        improving the &gt; &gt; page and I'll try to cover your questions better
        in the next version. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i was &gt; &gt; &gt;
        trying to do the cube using your method and almost everytime i would
        &gt; &gt; &gt; place a edge, it would be flipped. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; that is because im using the wrong setup moves...how do you
        know &gt; &gt; which &gt; &gt; &gt; setup moves to use..cause the
        difference between FR and RF are &gt; &gt; &gt; slim &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Instead of thinking of the cubie, think about the *sticker*. Think &gt;
        &gt; about the T-permutation alg. It shoots the UR edge to UL. Think of
        &gt; &gt; this as the U sticker of UR going to the U sticker place of
        UL. And &gt; &gt; for FR, think about its F sticker and for RF, think
        about its R &gt; &gt; sticker. So for FR, you need to bring its F
        sticker to the U of UL. &gt; &gt; Setup (d2 L) will do this. For RF, the
        R sticker needs to go to the U &gt; &gt; of UL. Setup (d' L') will do.
        Follow the sticker, not the cubie. Does &gt; &gt; that help? I'm so much
        used to it that I forgot to explain it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when i
        was trying to &gt; &gt; &gt; plan out the edge swaps on a different
        scramble then the one on your &gt; &gt; &gt; site.. i go through each
        color, starting with the one in the &gt; &gt; &gt; buffer..then to the
        one thats in where that needs to go..but then &gt; &gt; &gt; eventually
        ill get to the edge peice that is supposed to go where &gt; &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; buffer is.. so how do i note this..and what peice do i
        next.. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you find the buffer cubie somewhere,
        ignore it. That just means &gt; &gt; you've completed the first cycle.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After that you'll have to do the remaining cycles,
        one by one (unless &gt; &gt; you're lucky and there's only one cycle,
        containing all wrong edges). &gt; &gt; For each cycle, you first have to
        "break it open". That means you have &gt; &gt; to add the place of an
        unsolved cubie to the sequence you memorize. &gt; &gt; Immediately
        followed by the edge cubie in that place. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have a
        look at my example again, in particular the step where I first &gt; &gt;
        say "Exception" and the next step. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So for each
        cycle, you memorize something like (A B C D A), the first &gt; &gt; item
        being the same as the last. Just the first cycle, the one that &gt; &gt;
        starts with the buffer, would look like (B C D) instead, simply &gt;
        &gt; leaving out the A=buffer at start and end. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        once emailed a better example to someone... will include this in the
        &gt; &gt; next version of my page. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, &gt; &gt;

        Hi! Im looking for a nice and easy way to add an digital stopwatch to
        AVI movie files. This is so that can shoot a cube solving movie with my
        webcam. Then do some very basic editing and show the stopwatch at the
        bottom of the movie. Time should stay at 00:00.00 until solve starts and
        then time starts running when i solve. And it will show the final time
        when the cube is solved (time remains visible on screen). Ideally this
        is added when i record, so that i use keyboard to start/stop stopwatch
        (and possibly also the videostream capture). Or it could be added later
        as an overlay. Anyone has any idea about an idea and free way to do this
        (freeware)? Yes i know i can work with individual frames. But that's a
        definite NO!! if i wanna shoot 5x5x5 solving videos at a decent
        framrate. All help is welcome :-) -Per

        that I have to find the cycles, but then how do I actualy cycle the
        peices? Say I have a cycle thats (18274) What do you do to solve that
        cycle? What peices do you swap or three cycle and how do you think of
        it? Any comments or help would be greatly appreciated Evan

        Hey Evan, What you want to do with the cycles is to solve them in the
        most convenient order by using repeated 3-cycles, or if you're crazy
        using maybe a 5-cycle in there. I'm not sure if we number the pieces the
        same way, but if I saw the cycle (18274) I would just read it left to
        right and solve using 3 cycles. Say you do the 3 cycle (182) on your
        cube, which is the first three terms in your larger cycle that needs to
        be done. This cycles 1 to 8 and 8 to 2 (which needs to happen based on
        your larger cycle btw). However it also cycles 2 to 1, but 2 actually
        needs to go to 7 (reading your actual larger cycle). However by doing
        this three cycle you have cycled 2 pieces to their correct location, and
        now you can replace your larger cycle with (174). This is because the
        piece that was in 2's (the 7 piece) went to 1. So now 1 needs to go to
        7. Now finish with (174) and the cube is solved. If you had the cycle
        (12345678) you would do (123) This reduces your cycle to (145678). Now
        do (145) and you end up with (1678). Do (167) and you end up with (18).
        You may or may not have to do some setup moves to get these pieces in
        the same layer, then do a single quarter move and solve the remaing
        three cycle. To make things simpler, if you end up with UBL and UBR
        having to switch, for me this is the cycle (12), then you can do the
        single face turn U which leaves you with a three cycle. Based on my
        numbering of the pieces that cycle would be (134). For three cycles I
        use R'FR'B2RF'R'B2R2 and its inverse. You will often have to do setup
        moves to get your three pieces into the U layer to perform the cycle.
        Most of the setup moves are obvious, but this one is kinda weird. If you
        have to cycle UBL to DFL to UFR then I would do DF2DR2 to get them all
        into the U layer, three cycle them, then undo with R2D'F2D' Hope that
        helps some, Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Evan"

        Hey! The video Tyson made uses the codec MJPeg. I found this out using
        the excellent GSpot codec analyser. My webcam (Logitech Quickcam pro
        4000) will capture in IV50 (Intel Video) format. I do conversion to wmv
        with the very easy StoikVideoConverter (free!!). For conversion to DivX
        and other formats i use VirtualDub. Anyone here who knows hot to add a
        stopwatch (running time) to my videos please reply or send me an email
        at : aspiring_to_love(at) yahoo.no Happy cubing (and shooting ;-) ) -Per
        PS! I tested the Stoik-app on Tyson's video and i successfully converted
        to 384 kbps wmv (1.3 MB). Im not sure how the MJPeg codec came into my
        computer, maybe through DivX package or it was automatically downloaded
        from net through my MediaPlayer9 ?? That codec shouldn't be hard to find
        on the net anyway ;-) &gt; --- In

        Hi Tyson, Great video, another good camera angle which I use is to
        balance the camera on your shoulder whilst solving. Then you get the
        feeling of actually looking through the eyes of the solver as it were. I
        noticed, that you, like me, and I suspect a lot of fast cubers in the
        17-20 range have the same problem. Having mastered the first two layers,
        I neglected my LL, and now recognition and getting the PLL into position
        is slow, and where I am losing at least 2! seconds. I think learning
        similar tricks to Lars V for recognising PLL would help, who knows, you
        might go faster than Macky this way :) Dan H :) ----- Original Message

        Hey all, I remember this coming up in some form or another a while back,
        but I think it was about larger cubes (4x4x4 or 5x5x5). I have a Rubik's
        Game cube that I want to switch the tiles on from the old color scheme
        to the BOY scheme. To do that, I only need to switch out two adjacent
        faces. I know that I can flip the edge that these two faces share, and I
        also know that instead of swapping 4 tiles total on the two corners that
        the two faces share, I can just swap the tile on both of those corners
        that neither of the two faces share, and just switch those two corners
        out. What else can I do to minimize the number of tiles I have to swap
        out? Less tiles to swap = less painful puncture wounds on my index
        fingers from that slippery X-acto knife ;) Thanks, Doug

        Well, far from it for me to tell Lars' method, but he has mastered the
        system of recognising the permutation from looking at any two sides of
        the cube. This can be done, as many of you will know, by first looking
        at the corners on each face, and noting whether they are the same,
        oppositely coloured, or adjacently coloured, and then realising the edge
        situation afterwards. Every permutation has a definite (if cometimes
        very subtle) difference. :) Try experimenting with the PLL's, a good
        place to start is to notice which PLL's have corners the same (eg 3-edge
        cycles), oppositely coloured (eg the "arrow") or adjacently coloured
        (3-edge and 3-corner cycles). Have fun, and good luck! (BTW Joel, nice
        to hear that you still remember my recognition trick!) DanH :) -----

        Thanks for the replies, Actually, I've already done this procedure once,
        but I didn't think of any better way of switching the tiles than by
        switching 16 and flipping the one edge. The X-acto knife I use has a
        blade that is kind of wave-shaped so I can push the blade down towards
        my desk (the sliced finger thing was a joke, although I know it has
        happened to other people) whithout having any of my fingers in the way.
        The blade is narrow enough that if I look for the slight indentions on
        top of the trough on the two sides that are flush with the sloped ends
        of the trough, I can get the tiles out of the trough sans damage about
        95% of the time. I basically just work it in and break the glue on the
        two opposite sides. Doug d_j_salvia wrote: &gt;Hi Doug, &gt; &gt; You

        narrow enough that if I look for the slight indentions on &gt;top of the
        trough on the two sides that are flush with the sloped ends &gt; &gt;
        Sorry, that should read "on top of the tiles" not "on top of the
        trough". I haven't mastered the art of seeing the trough through the
        tiles yet ;) Doug &gt;of the trough, I can get the tiles out of the
        trough sans damage about &gt;95% of the time. I basically just work it
        in and break the glue on the &gt;two opposite sides. &gt; &gt;Doug &gt;

        Hi there, Is there anyone interested in Megaminx? Here is a website
        which has an interesting 3D animation of Megaminx. You can play online.
        It has a build-in solver (probably the first one on the internet). Here

        Great video, another good camera angle which I use is to balance &gt;

        Hi all, as I have watched one video from a recent contest, I realized
        that (when viewed by frames) the world record reached there is probably
        not really valid according to the official rules. To be more specific:
        the competitor is touching the puzzle after the time is stopped and for
        the particular puzzlethe difference could be quite significant. I really
        do not want to be more concrete now, because I think that it is too late
        to change results. I only want to discuss it for the future contests.
        With competitors nearer to the time limits are forced to optimize
        starting and stopping the timer to the border of area of violating
        rules... And I think that it is going to be more and more serious as
        more and more competitors are closer to the winning times... (It is more
        and more similar to olympic sports where were huge number of various
        protests and protests to protests and so on...) That is why we should
        add a rule (to the WCA rules) about protests (time limits, evidences,
        comitee, etc.). The drawback is that the competitions would be less fun
        for some groups of people, however, it starts to be the case anyway,
        because loosing in a competition can mean a big financial loss... Best
        regards, Josef

        well basically it generates a face (1 of 6) and a turn-metric (1 of 3:
        90, -90, 180). then it looks at the previous move's face. if the
        proposed move's face is the same as the previous move's face, then
        regenerate the face until the proposed move's face is different from the
        previous move's face (obviously). then it looks at the previous 2 moves.
        if the previous 2 moves and the proposed move are all in parallel
        planes, then it regenerates the proposed move's face until the previous
        2 moves and the proposed move are not all in parallel planes (this
        prevents 3 consecutive moves in the same plane). i'd be happy to add
        additional logic to further improve the generator. please suggest what
        might be done to improve. also, the random generator itself is a neat
        alg that i got from a statistical website. i.e., the random number
        generator is NOT something like: R(n+1) = (R(n) * big_prime1) +
        big_prime2 rather it is a more sophisticated algorithm that actually
        passes all the major statistical tests, although the alg is not
        cryptographicly secure. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi Everyone, I wrote about this during the summer. I'm sure many of you
        are familiar with the Paul Hamm incident. Everything was fine until they
        went and checked the video and then they started complaining about
        things. There was no protest brought forth at the time of the
        competition. The judge did not see the violation. Umpires in sports blow
        calls all the time but the calls stay. The solve is valid and the time
        will stay. This is regardless of the video. In order for a rule
        violation to occur, the judge must declare a rule violation to the
        tournament director. If there is a protest and people believe a rule
        violation has occurred but the judge did not declare it, the protest
        must be filed in a reasonable amount of time and I'd like this to be
        interpreted as "during the competition and before the award's ceremony."
        Time Limit for Protest: Protests must be filed before the placement and
        rankings of the competitor's are finalized. Tournament organizers should
        spend at least five minutes after each round checking over results and
        making sure that the spread sheet is operational. Video Evidence: Judges
        and the tournament organizers may NOT consult video evidence in making
        decisions. Not every solve is recorded and it would be unfair that some
        people have extra scrutiny over others. We must rely on the good faith
        and honesty of the people who choose to be judges. We must believe that
        the judges will be unbiased when judging their friends as this is in the
        nature of this sport. As the organization and the sport grows, we should
        reach a point where we have enough organizers that judges can be more of
        a distinct entity from the competitors. This is why I hesitate to
        compete in tournaments that I run. (It also makes me less efficient.)
        Committee: The protest must be brought forth to the WCA member or WCA
        appointed representative at that tournament. This means if you're
        tournament does not have a WCA member or a WCA appointed representative
        present, it's not official. The WCA members or representatives present
        at the tournament will make the decision regarding the protest. These
        are the rules that my tournaments have been following. We have been
        fortunate enough not to have any type of protest. In the final round,
        because there are fewer competitors, I would like to suggest that more
        than one judge preside over the solve. As for video evidence, this is
        the rule now. We do not have the capacity to record every solve yet but
        I'm sure it won't be hard if we can find one person with a camera. When
        the organization is large enough that they can expend several people
        throughout the duration of the tournament to do nothing but video tape
        solves, then we can have mandatory video recording. As of now, because
        this is not possible, video evidence will not be allowed whatsoever in
        the determination of protests. Tyson Mao MSC #631 California Institute

        Hi Tyson, I want to thank you for consistant and intelligently updating

        Hey! I'd just like to mention that videos can be tempered with.
        Especially videos that "appear" a while after the incident/event that
        was shot. If an umpire hasn't spotted anything wrong during a solve that
        is an indication that nothing seriously wrong could have happened. That
        touching cube rule is a bit harsh. I can understand if the cube wasn't
        solved and the competitor managed to say complete the last move by
        fingertrigering a layer to get that done. So i agree that one shouldn't
        overrule original judgement with hindsight unless something was spotted
        and reported by the judge during a solve. And then this report led to
        investigation into the incident ... well u should get the idea. Too
        detailed rules will only serve to complicate judging, and won't really
        lead to fairer judgment in my opinion :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        I wrote about this during the summer. I'm sure many of you are &gt; &gt;
        familiar with the Paul Hamm incident. Everything was fine until they
        &gt; &gt; went and checked the video and then they started complaining
        about &gt; &gt; things. There was no protest brought forth at the time
        of the &gt; &gt; competition. The judge did not see the violation.
        Umpires in sports &gt; &gt; blow calls all the time but the calls stay.
        The solve is valid and the &gt; &gt; time will stay. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        This is regardless of the video. In order for a rule violation to &gt;
        &gt; occur, the judge must declare a rule violation to the tournament
        &gt; &gt; director. If there is a protest and people believe a rule
        violation &gt; &gt; has occurred but the judge did not declare it, the
        protest must be &gt; &gt; filed in a reasonable amount of time and I'd
        like this to be &gt; &gt; interpreted as "during the competition and
        before the award's &gt; &gt; ceremony." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Time Limit
        for Protest: Protests must be filed before the placement &gt; &gt; and
        rankings of the competitor's are finalized. Tournament organizers &gt;
        &gt; should spend at least five minutes after each round checking over
        &gt; &gt; results and making sure that the spread sheet is operational.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Video Evidence: Judges and the tournament organizers
        may NOT consult &gt; &gt; video evidence in making decisions. Not every
        solve is recorded and it &gt; &gt; would be unfair that some people have
        extra scrutiny over others. We &gt; &gt; must rely on the good faith and
        honesty of the people who choose to be &gt; &gt; judges. We must believe
        that the judges will be unbiased when judging &gt; &gt; their friends as
        this is in the nature of this sport. As the &gt; &gt; organization and
        the sport grows, we should reach a point where we have &gt; &gt; enough
        organizers that judges can be more of a distinct entity from the &gt;
        &gt; competitors. This is why I hesitate to compete in tournaments that
        I &gt; &gt; run. (It also makes me less efficient.) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Committee: The protest must be brought forth to the WCA member or WCA
        &gt; &gt; appointed representative at that tournament. This means if
        you're &gt; &gt; tournament does not have a WCA member or a WCA
        appointed representative &gt; &gt; present, it's not official. The WCA
        members or representatives present &gt; &gt; at the tournament will make
        the decision regarding the protest. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These are the
        rules that my tournaments have been following. We have &gt; &gt; been
        fortunate enough not to have any type of protest. In the final &gt; &gt;
        round, because there are fewer competitors, I would like to suggest &gt;
        &gt; that more than one judge preside over the solve. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; As for video evidence, this is the rule now. We do not have the
        &gt; &gt; capacity to record every solve yet but I'm sure it won't be
        hard if we &gt; &gt; can find one person with a camera. When the
        organization is large &gt; &gt; enough that they can expend several
        people throughout the duration of &gt; &gt; the tournament to do nothing
        but video tape solves, then we can have &gt; &gt; mandatory video
        recording. As of now, because this is not possible, &gt; &gt; video
        evidence will not be allowed whatsoever in the determination of &gt;
        &gt; protests. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tyson Mao &gt; &gt; MSC #631 &gt;

        Hey everybody I'm François Sechet, the guy who organized the

        I guess noone here cares because no one was there, anyway... For those
        who haven't seen the results, the standards were pretty high. The French
        Record has been broken twice (almost 3 times) and Frederick Badie was
        very impressive with his 4x4 and 5x5 records. Too bad none of us got to
        finish the Blindfolded solves, and as Gilles said afterwards, we
        could've done a FMC event instead of blindfolded. Other than that, it
        was a nice day, good mood, everything went pretty well. A few things I
        want to come up with. I know Gilles already refered to Ron about it, but
        we had a few problems with some rules. Nothing very important actually,
        but still. 1. 4x4 and 5x5 events. I checked personnally almost every
        single scrambled cube, and I think it occured only once, but I noticed
        one 5x5 has been given to the competitor with the wrong scramble. We
        should have solved it and scrambled it again, then give it back to the
        competitor, but we gave it straight away to the competitor, maily
        because we were (by the time) short of time (we weren't sure of the time
        we would have to empty the room). What should we do in this case? It
        wasn't a very important solve anyway, since the guy got 8 mins something
        on it, but what if... My thoughts about this case was that it doesn't
        change a lot during a 5x5 solve, plus the competitor didn't
        complain/notice. It's my mistake anyway, I should have solved it and
        rescrambled it. 2. During the first round of the 3x3x3 event, Sebastien
        Felix started and accidentaly stopped the timer after 0.38s. We (the
        judges and Sebastien) decided to give him an extra solve. Now, even if
        it wouldn't have changed anything to the final result, I think we should
        haveacted otherwise. The rules say, "the competitor is responsible for
        starting and stopping the timer", and "after finishing his solve and
        stopping the timer, the competitor isn't allowed to touch the puzzle
        bafore being told to do so" or something in that direction. Now, when we
        analyze what happened, it's clear that when Sebastien stopped the timer,
        the cube wasn't solved, plus he was still performing moves on it. So I
        think we should have disqualified the solve. It didn't really matter,
        since it was a "best of" round, and since he already had a time under
        30s he was already mathematically qualified for the final. These are
        IMHO all the major mistakes done during the champs. Of course, after a
        few days, and without the pressure (there isn't only pressure for the
        competitors, I tell you), I think we should have acted an other way.
        Errare humanum est, as they said... Other than that, it was a fine day
        for me... Thanks to anyone who helped me in any way (Ron and Tyson from
        the WCA committee, Dave Jones who niceley sent me a timer from London 10
        days before the competition so I could do with 2 and not only one,
        thanks for the stickers and the trophies and goodies, and thanks to
        anyone who helped with the organisation, may the ones I forgot be
        thanked too). Just my humble thoughts, in the exactly same humble value
        of 2 cents... François PS: Dave, I will give the timers back to WM next
        Tuesday I think. I hope it's not a problem.

        That's hilarious! I took an optics class last year and we dealt with
        bifrigence (how do you spell that) and other properties of polarized
        materials and what not... if someone is bored enough to want to do this,
        let me know and if you're really serious, I'll see if I can get the half
        and quarter wave plates. I think it would be an interesting exercise
        because you could line up everything so that all sides had the same

        Hi Gilles, Tyson, Very interesting idea. When the cube is solved you
        can't see directly though it because opposing sides have opposing
        polarization? Each of the three pairs of opposing sides could have the
        polarization at a different angle. How then could you tell different
        cubies apart? You could have a display stand for it which has a rotating
        magnetic field. :) Regards, David J --- In

        Uh, not exactly. That would only be the case if you had two half
        polarizes sitting orthogonal to each other in the solved state. You
        could tell the cubes apart by putting the half polarizers at different
        angles which would reduce the light transmission by different amount.
        You could put in the quarter wave plates and that would cause some
        already orthogonal half polarizers to transmit light, etc... it could be
        really cool. But really complex... Tyson Mao MSC #631 California

        algorithm? I mentioned it to my classmates here the other day, and they
        figured it was a great topic for that ... paper ... we're writing in
        another 5 years. Don't know the english word for it. Anyways, I got kind
        of interested. Are anyone working on this? Are there any news? &gt; 2)
        wca regulations (issues touched by François Sechet for instance) If
        there's one thing I'm sick of discussing it's this. :( &gt; 3) which
        cubes are really best? how to build ur own ultimate &gt; speedcube? A
        while ago I had a very nice cube. It was a hybrid construction with the
        core being from an Ideal cube and the pieces from a studio cube. It was
        really a great cube, except that the plastic from the old ideal cube was
        getting bad quality. A center piece snapped off a couple of weeks ago,
        so I transferred the pieces to the old studio cube core. It's working
        all right, but I really do prefer arched centers. Popping = no thanks.
        &gt; 4) who is the best allround puzzler? I am impressed by Jaap. Love
        his site. :) &gt; 5) cubing jokes Why don't you just peel off the
        stickers? HAHA LOL HOW ORIGINAL!!!111~ *Sigh* &gt; 6) what is the best
        notation for larger cubes? (inner layers notation) Someone suggested
        this a while back... some sort of notation by axes. Name the axes X (R,L
        axis), Y (U,D axis) and Z (F,B axis). Then a notation like X(10010)
        would mean the first and fourth layers on the X axis _from R_ to be
        turned 90 degrees clockwise. Alternatively, X(14) might save space, but
        that may make it difficult to denote half-turns, so instead of 2 let's
        use *. So D2 on a 5x5 would be Y(5*), d2 would be Y(4*), and (D2 d2)
        would be Y(4*5*) or perhaps Y((45)*) or Y(45)*. Then we can do things
        like Y(12)(3)'(45)*. Nifty. But I think we should use this only for
        cubes with degree larger than 5 because we already have working notation
        for degrees 2-5 that saves a lot of space relative to this way. &gt; 7)
        shouldn't M, E and S on 3x3x3 cube really be counted as 1 move? No...
        First, M, E or S is equivalent to 2 moves of the outer layers, and
        second, it's fairly obvious that M, E and S are far more difficult to
        perform fast than any move of the outer layers. I think M, E and S
        should be counted as 2. &gt; I'm sure u guys can think of more topics to
        boost the number of posts. &gt; &gt; Happy posting!! ;-) &gt; &gt; -Per

        Hi Per, OK... 1) what is really best method of solving the cube? Looking
        ahead well. Oh, you mean formal method, hmmm, The method I use. :)
        Actually I haven't seen enough of the other methods to say, since most
        speedcubists use only one method. Corners first is fast, too. Until lots
        of speedy folks learn other methods it's going to be a tossup. 2) wca
        regulations (issues touched by François Sechet for instance) We need
        rules for solving with the judges wearing blindfolds. 3) which cubes are
        really best? how to build ur own ultimate speedcube? The Deluxe and
        Rubik's Game cubes, Ideal cubes made in 1981 or late 1980 - mostly in
        Hungary and Hong Kong, the Studio cubes made in Hungary, the new arched
        center cubes, in that order. 4) who is the best allround puzzler?
        Probably some of the people on Twistypuzzles.com like Jaap. 5) cubing
        jokes "What's the secret to solving the cube?" a) knowing what you're
        doing. b) my daddy knows someone who knows Rubik. c) reading the
        algoritms online. d) having brain cells that work. 6) what is the best
        notation for larger cubes? (inner layers notation) I vote for Chris
        Harwick's idea of r1, r2, r3 etc. 7) shouldn't M, E and S on 3x3x3 cube
        really be counted as 1 move? Yes, since that's how they are thought of;
        and they should be changed to lower case letter of the Upper case
        letters for the sides they are next to, r, l, f, b, u, d. This way the
        3x3x3 and 4x4x4 share the same notation. Cheers, David J --- In

        (I'm at school, comp sci class...I'm sleepy and bored :) Hi David, Per-
        1) what is really best method of solving the cube? Whatever works for
        you, the cuber. Everybody who learns the Fridrich method, and has time
        to practice gets good at it. (This came up during a conversation about
        QWERTY vs. DVORAK (?) keyboards) But we never tried to come up with our
        own method, something unique. Like Gilles Roux and Lars Petrus have
        their own method, and they can always improve it because they know how
        it works. Majority of the people who use Fridrich use memorize
        algorithms, and execute them. 2) wca regulations (issues touched by
        François Sechet for instance) A lot of catagories have already been
        covered... All I can think of are rules for new puzzles. 3) which cubes
        are really best? how to build ur own ultimate speedcube? "The Deluxe and
        Rubik's Game cubes, Ideal cubes made in 1981 or late 1980 - mostly in
        Hungary and Hong Kong, the Studio cubes made in Hungary, the new arched
        center cubes, in that order." I would like to add my arched studio mod
        right after Ideal cubes. :) I like my arched cubes a lot. I don't use my
        modded studio...It's precious ;) (Okay, 7 hours was spent on fiddling
        with that cube, and about 3 wks later rubiks.com sells pretty much the
        exact same thing as a DIY Kit... So much having an unique cube...) 4)
        who is the best allround puzzler? Whoever can solve a puzzle after
        picking it up. They don't have to be the fastest at a puzzle, just be
        able to solve them all. 5) cubing jokes "What's the secret to solving
        the cube?" "You cube too much if... you use silicone spray as deodorant"
        6) what is the best notation for larger cubes? (inner layers notation)
        "I vote for Chris Harwick's idea of r1, r2, r3, etc" I do too. But all
        the algorithms I'm familiar with for larger cubes (Well..I guess only up
        till 5x5x5) have slice turns as r l u d f b, and have ' (superscript) 2
        and w for double turns. 7) shouldn't M, E and S on 3x3x3 cube really be
        counted as 1 move? Yes, but I don't think we should be too picky and
        make them lower case... We wouldn't exactly get 'confused' if they
        weren't. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "d_j_salvia"

        Well.. About number 7: Yes, in my humble opion, it seems very natural do
        define slice moves like 'M' as 1 move. When I look at the cube from the
        outside, the cube is not just a puzzle with six faces that can all be
        turned in two directions, but it's a large cube that is build up with 27
        small cubes, and all layers can be twisted in three dimensions. I
        wouldn't know why there should be a difference between the first and
        second layer... But off course, that's just my opinion ;). Bye, - Joel.

        I have a question to organize official tournament. Especialy, about
        judging. I thought we need to have judges who really don't compete. It
        was the unsloved problem to organize competitions in Japan. When I see
        the pictures of Dutch Open 2004, I found the competitors may judge the
        others each other. Then, I looked at the other pictures of the other
        competitions, and found there are a few judges who may compete. Is that
        allowed for official competitions? We, Japanese people, got together
        sometimes. We just saw and talked each other. It was fun, but we
        couldn't have set official records because we didn't have judges who
        don't want to compete. If we can judge each other, we can organize some
        official competitions in Japan. When the competitors judges the others,
        how they randomize the cubes? I guess they just don't see the cube or
        randomize cube under table or in a box. If we do so, someone may think
        the judge can remember the pattern of randomization. But I don't thinks
        so. I believe it is still fair as long as they don't see it. If someone
        else could set the initial position before randomization, it must be
        more difficult to be recognized. I hear in Caltech tournament initial
        position may be set in the same color scheme. (May be wrong) But each
        competitor may make cross in different color so I don't think the
        initial position is not important. If someone (Ron, Chris, or Tyson who
        listed on as board of WCA) could show guidelines or something in case we
        can't prepare the judegs who don't compete, we would really appreciate.
        And we would like to follow the guidelines and post our records as
        official ones. Thanks. Masayuki Akimoto

        Hi all, I've seen the spinning move on Nathan Christie's site
        http://my.fit.edu/~dchristi/cube/spin.mpg and I noticed that the cube is
        "silent". It sounds like there is little friction. If I listen to
        Macky's videos, the cube is so "loud", it sounds like there is lot of
        friction. How's the sound on your cube?

        nearly all events judging and scrambling was done by someone who didn't
        participate in that particular event. The 3x3x3 event had 17 competitors
        but in all other events the highest number of people that entered was
        10. So that meant that we had at least 7 people that could volunteer to
        scramble and judge, and which they thankfully did (especially Jaap and
        Peter did a lot of good work to help us out). So the only problem really
        is to start the 3x3x3 first round: you have to be able to scramble the
        cubes and judge the first 4 participants, so that they can scramble and
        judge after they've completed their round, which seems fair to me since
        it doensn't matter anymore that they can see the scramble. I can't
        remember how we resolved this issue in Groningen. Ron??? Cheers, LarsV

        Hey everybody, Ok, this is not a very important post, but because of
        Per's campain to boost up the number of messages, I thought it would be
        nice to post it anyway... Around 1:00 AM this night, I was thinking
        about commutators... Suddenly, I turned on the light, grabbed my cube,
        and I had found an algorithm to cycle three egdes, or do the E
        permutation ((URF URB) (ULF ULB)). I don't know if this is a well know
        algorithm, so maybe I am just telling old news :). It's not an efficient
        algorithm too, but it's easy to memorize and execute, and I think I
        might use it in blindfold cubing for doing the E permutation. Maybe it's
        also usefull for a beginner, since it's not that hard to memorize, and
        it allows you to solve 2 different permutations. Here is the alg (this
        one permute's pieces in the D layer!) : RUR' L'U'L RUR' - D - RUR' L'U'L
        RUR' - [D']. Replace the D's by D2 to get the E permutation. - Joel.

        In the spirit of boosting posts! 1) what is really best method of
        solving the cube? Totally biased - L2L4 followed by L2L2. From a
        position of ignorance as I don't know the corners first methods. 2) wca
        regulations (issues touched by Franï¿½ois Sechet for instance) Still
        unhappy about the no painted cubes rule. Also still think fewer
        regulations/more general principles is best. 3) which cubes are really
        best? how to build ur own ultimate speedcube? The old ideal ones are the
        best I'ved tried. But I haven't tried most cubes so I don't know. 4) who
        is the best allround puzzler? Pass. Or maybe nominate Chris Hardwick. 7)
        shouldn't M, E and S on 3x3x3 cube really be counted as 1 move? No - but
        mostly because I can't do them quickly enough. I guess it only really
        matters for FMC - don't we have competitions where theya re counted both
        ways - if not we should! I'll give 5 a try some time. Duncan -----

        Hi! Another boost post :-P My first post was partially meant as a joke
        and partially serious. I wish we had more serious/interesting posts.
        Even repeating old stuff is ok. Maybe new details will come up :-) Joel,
        since when did edges have 3 faces? ... hehe ;-) OK, so u mean corner
        3-cycle. There's another easier way to swap 2 corners like u do. I will
        show how u can do that on top (not bottom) : LU'RD2R'UL' The full 3
        cycle is done like this : ( &lt;A,B&gt; = ABA'B' ) &lt;LU'RD2R'UL',U&gt;
        And by the way ur alg is NOT a commutator. U simply utilise that every
        cycle created by the 9 first moves are of order 2. After adjusting D u
        just repeat the first 9 moves again. U still follow what i call the
        "isolation principle" but not as a commutator. Ur alg can be written
        like this : ABAB' And of coz u could have done ABA'B' with those first 9
        moves. It works exactly similar :D Cheers!! -Per &gt; --- In

        Im relatively new to cubing (3 months now)... What's a commutator? OH,
        by the way, I was eating lunch at a local restaraunt by myself, solving
        the cube, and started talking with the person next to me about cubing (I
        had my laptop out, and I was timing...) and I got a new best time of
        47.42 seconds... even with one mistake in the F2L... but im pretty sure
        it was a lucky time, (though I still had to do 2 look in the last layer,
        the PLL worked out right, cuz I new the alg to skip OLL ... rather do

        be nice to &gt; &gt; post it anyway... Around 1:00 AM this night, I was
        thinking about &gt; &gt; commutators... Suddenly, I turned on the light,
        grabbed my cube, and &gt; &gt; I had found an algorithm to cycle three
        egdes, or do the E &gt; &gt; permutation ((URF URB) (ULF ULB)). I don't
        know if this is a well &gt; &gt; know algorithm, so maybe I am just
        telling old news :). It's not an &gt; &gt; efficient algorithm too, but
        it's easy to memorize and execute, and &gt; &gt; I think I might use it
        in blindfold cubing for doing the E &gt; &gt; permutation. Maybe it's
        also usefull for a beginner, since it's not &gt; &gt; that hard to
        memorize, and it allows you to solve 2 different &gt; &gt; permutations.
        Here is the alg (this one permute's pieces in the D &gt; &gt; layer!) :
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RUR' L'U'L RUR' - D - RUR' L'U'L RUR' - [D']. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Replace the D's by D2 to get the E permutation. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; - Joel. &gt; &gt; &gt; There's an obvious commutator that does
        the same thing: (RUR' L'U'L &gt; RUR') D (RUR' L'U'L RUR')' D'. &gt; But
        the interesting thing is that (RUR' L'U'L RUR') and (RUR' L'U'L &gt;
        RUR')' give identical results, because (RUR' L'U'L RUR')^2=I. &gt; Of
        course, you can do things like (RUR'L'U'LRUR') D (L'U'LRUR'L'U'L) &gt;
        D' too. &gt; &gt; Thanks for sharing, &gt; &gt; Gilles.

        Hi Per, I never claimed the alg I posted was a commutator, but the

        Well, I dont really know a formal definition of a commutator, but I have
        a pretty good idea about what it means... Suppose you want to find an
        algorithm that effects only a few pieces of the U layer. For example:
        twist one corner clockwise, and another piece counterclockwise. Then,
        find an algorithm to rotate the first corner clockwise, that doesn't
        affect the other pieces in the U layer (but destoys F2l. I does not
        matter how much of the F2L is being messed up here!). Call that
        algorithm [A]. Now, rotate the U face. Now do [A]'. This will rotate
        another corner of the U layer counterclockwise, and restore the F2L
        again. For example, take [A] = R'D'RDR'D'R. Now, try [A]U [A]'U'. The
        same thing can be done to orient edges and permute pieces. (For
        permutations, find an alg [B] that swaps two pieces in the U layer
        without touching the rest of that layer, then do a U move, then do [B]')

        definition of a commutator (At the risk of offending "richy_jr_2000",
        who would prefer that I don't mention mathematics, I will attempt to
        tell you - and also indicate why it might be useful in puzzling.) A
        commutator is an element of a group that is of the form: [A,B]=A'B'AB
        where A' is the inverse of A and B' the inverse of B. It measures the
        extent to which A and B fail to commute (they commute if the commutator
        is the identity - in that case AB=BA). It's like taking off your shoes
        and then taking off your socks and then putting on your shoes and then
        pulling your socks over them. Taking off your socks and shoes don't
        commute and they have a non-trivial commutator - you get a double
        tranposition (each sock switches position with the corresponding shoe).
        On the other hand taking off your gloves and taking off your shoes do
        commute. If you take off your gloves and then your shoes (forget that
        you just pulled your socks over them) and then put your gloves back on
        and then your shoes back on, you should be where you started. The
        commutator subgroup is the subgroup that the commutators generate - in
        the cube group this is exactly half the group - but generally it is not
        the case that the commutator subgroup contains only commutators. In
        general, the conjugate permutations A'B'A and B'AB are closely related
        to B' and A respectively. (For instance, if (a_1...a_k) is a cycle in
        the disjoint cycle structure of A then (b(a_1)...b(a_k)) is a disjoint
        cycle in the cycle structure of B'AB.) In particular, you can design
        your commutator to cancel things out. If b fixes a_1 and a_2 then A'B'AB
        is going to fix a_1 for example (A will take it to a_2 and then B'AB
        will take a_2=b(a_2) to b(a_1)=a_1).

        Hey everyone, Tyson already mentioned it, and Macky is already spreading
        the word about it, but there will be a negative time solving contest
        this year during Daylight saving time. It is the only time where you can
        time yourself on the cube, and finish before you started. You will be
        given only one chance and only one scramble. The scramble is on Macky's
        webpage, but check out the setup of the contest on the main page of
        http://www.speedcubing.com We hope to see a lot of participation! Good
        luck! Chris

        negative time solve done last year. Sorry I sucked... the time was 59

        At the upcoming Swedish Cube Day we will have a multitude of events and
        most probably very few competitors in several of them. We will try to
        manage the judge situation like they did at the Dutch Open. As Francois
        mentioned, shortage of time is an issue. During the Swedish Cube Day we
        will solve this by having fun instead of having a strict and formal
        competition. Since it will be the first competition we arrange, we will
        do it in a most relaxed manner. However, we will try to comply with the
        WCA regulations as much as possible. We will communicate our experiences
        to you after the event. /Anders --- In

        Day on nearly all &gt; events judging and scrambling was done by someone
        who didn't &gt; participate in that particular event. The 3x3x3 event
        had 17 &gt; competitors but in all other events the highest number of
        people that &gt; entered was 10. So that meant that we had at least 7
        people that could &gt; volunteer to scramble and judge, and which they
        thankfully did &gt; (especially Jaap and Peter did a lot of good work to
        help us out). So &gt; the only problem really is to start the 3x3x3
        first round: you have to &gt; be able to scramble the cubes and judge
        the first 4 participants, so &gt; that they can scramble and judge after
        they've completed their round, &gt; which seems fair to me since it
        doensn't matter anymore that they can &gt; see the scramble. I can't
        remember how we resolved this issue in &gt; Groningen. &gt; &gt; Ron???

        Hi all, The chat this weekend was a great success, many people took part
        and the java chat environment on the whole was very stable. So I hope
        this can "re-become" a regular feature of our weekends, it's especially
        useful if you are a beginner or an intermediate looking for absolutely
        anything to help you progress in the world of speedsolving or FMC, there
        is usually an expert or two within the chat who is more than happy to
        pass on some knowledge! I will host another chat next weekend at around
        7PM UK time (saturday), but you can pop by anytime, there may well be
        someone about, and I will drop in from time to time during the week as
        well. I hope you all enjoy ithe facility, and have a good week! Dan

        Hey guys... and girls, For school, I have to do a presentation about a
        subject of my choice. And because the Cube is one of the things I like,
        and the public = Math students, I thought it would be a nice idea to
        tell them something about the cube... For example, how you can calculate
        how many positions you can make. Now, I know how to prove that it's
        impossible to make an odd permutation, but what's the easiest way to
        prove that all even permutations are possible? (I know how to prove
        this, but my proof is a bit complicated to explain to a non-cuber (and
        it's not really beautiful), so does anyone know a (short) way to prove
        it so a non-cuber can understand it quickly?) Also, to avoid being very
        boring, I am looking for some nice facts about the cube... For example:
        I once heard some tax-laws of Hungary were changed, because of Mr.
        Rubik. Or: When you make a line of 43 * 10^18 cubes (with all different
        cubestates) you get a line with a length of xxx(?) light-years. Does
        anyone know more interesting facts like this? Thanks for helping me :),
        Joel.

        a really nice way to do it, so will be interested to see what others
        come up with. Three-cycles are one possibility... but to avoid having to
        treat edges-odd/corners-odd (slightly) separately from
        edges-even/corners-even you might want to use the T-pattern (permutation
        (UBL,UFL)(UR,UL)), as in Stefan's blindfold solving method. Maybe this
        is what you have in mind anyway. Presumably, when discussing even and
        odd perms, you would already have mentioned that a permutation can be
        decomposed into a product of transpositions. You'd then argue (with
        elegantly waving hands) that any any one of these transpositions could
        be achieved by: (1) manoeuvring the required pair of edges (resp.
        corners) into locations UR,UL (resp. UBL,UFL) without disturbing the
        corners UBL,UFL (resp. edges UR,UL); (2) performing the T move; and (3)
        manoeuvring the pieces back again. This would bring in the idea of
        conjugates, too. Although it is not hard to fill in the details, you
        perhaps couldn't expect your audience to be that patient... Mike

        This is also probably not the most elegant proof, but I always argue
        based on the possible moves of the cube. You can argue that all moves
        are isomorphic to R,R',R2 by using cube rotations. Then you can show
        that R and R' are odd permutations by showing that they 4-cycle the
        corners and edges in their orbits, then break down a 4-cycle into 3
        transpositions to show that it is odd. Then show that R2 is an even
        permutation by performing 2 transpositions in each of the corner and
        edge orbits. Then you can list a single alg, like the T perm or
        something, and show how you can do a transposition in each of the edge
        or corner orbit, but that this ALWAYS does a transposition in the other
        orbit as well. (the moves R and R' show this by performing an odd
        permutation on both orbits, so this always has to be the case). Since
        you can perform a transposition in each orbit then all odd and even
        permutations are possible, but the key is that both orbits have to have
        the same parity. You also have to show about the orientations of the
        pieces, but after doing that you could argue in even and odd permutation
        cases, since each is exactly half the number of combinations to the
        cube, then add them together to get the total. I always do the
        orientations by defining a hierarchy of faces, exactly like in
        blindfolded cubing, and likewise examine your possible moves R,R',R2 and
        you'll see that you always flip the orientations of the pieces in the
        possible ways, ruling out a single corner or edge rotated and things
        like that. I don't know a shorter way to prove the orientations of the
        pieces, but I remember seeing something very short in my modern algebra
        class. Sadly I can't recall it very well though :( Not sure if that was
        elegant or short, but that is how I prove the number of combinations.

        edges-even/corners-even you might want to use the T-pattern &gt;

        facts which seems much deeper than it really is. I prefer to think of it
        like this: If yuo could swap any two edge piece you like (e.g. remove
        them, swap and reinsert them), then it is obvious that you can put them
        all in the correct place. With each swap you can bring (at least) one
        piece to the position it should be. You can go further than this. If all
        you could do is swap UL with any of the other 11 edges, then it is still
        possible. To solve any non-UL piece, swap it with UL, and then bring it
        from UL to the position you want it with another swap. So with 2 swaps
        you can solve any non-UL piece, without disturbing any other solved
        non-UL pieces. Eventually all you might be left with is a swap to solve
        UL and the last piece. All you need to show now is that you can swap any
        of the 11 non-UL edges with UL using the T permutation. &gt; You'd then
        argue (with elegantly waving hands) that &gt; any any one of these
        transpositions could be achieved by: (1) &gt; manoeuvring the required
        pair of edges (resp. corners) into &gt; locations &gt; UR,UL (resp.
        UBL,UFL) without disturbing the corners UBL,UFL (resp. &gt; edges
        UR,UL); (2) performing the T move; and (3) manoeuvring the &gt; pieces
        back again. This would bring in the idea of conjugates, &gt; too. The
        way I did it you only need to bring one edge to UR without disturbing
        the ULF,UL,ULB bar. This is very easy (if you allow slice moves). Regard
        ULF,UL,ULB as being bandaged, like a siamese cube. Unfortunately this
        only shows how to solve edges. To prove it rigorously you would have to
        do the same kind of thing with the corners. Jaap

        For school, I have to do a presentation about a subject of my &gt;

        Also, to avoid being very boring, I am looking for some nice facts &gt;
        about the cube... For example: I once heard some tax-laws of Hungary
        &gt; were changed, because of Mr. Rubik. Or: When you make a line of 43

        &gt; length of xxx(?) light-years. Does anyone know more interesting
        &gt; facts like this? &gt; &gt; Thanks for helping me :), &gt; &gt;
        Joel. What level are you pitching it at? (Depending on this, you may
        have to define a lot of information in advance, which could rush the
        main presentation - and could be tedious.) I will try to give some scant
        details, at the risk of incurring the wrath of some. First of all, what
        level of information on permutations are you assuming. Any permutation
        can be broken up as a product of disjoint cycles. (That is the cycles
        will have no common elements.) It can also be broken up as a product of
        transpositions (2-cycles). The transpositions will not in general be
        disjoint. This decomposition into cycles will not be unique but the
        number of multiplicands (here, transpositions) will be invariant modulo
        2 for a given permutation. (If your audience don't know this, you're
        probably going to have to get them to take this as given - otherwise you
        likely won't have time to finish. It could take some time to prove.) In
        particular, a cycle is odd iff it moves an even number of elements. For
        example (a b c ... w x y)=(a b c ... w x)(a y) and you can use
        induction. Now, since a move is a product of quarter turns and a quarter
        turn is a product of two 4-cycles (one of corners and one of edges)
        forgetting orientation for the present, then the permutation of the
        whole will be even. The product of 2 4-cycles is clearly even (the total
        number of transpositions is the sum of two odd numbers and so even). So
        you can't get an odd permutation. But it is possible for the
        restrictions to either edge or corner permutations to be odd
        individually. Fortunately, if this is the case, then simply doing any
        quarter turn will clearly fix this. Now all you need to do (in the first
        instance) is prove that any even permutation of corners and any even
        permutation of edges is possible. Even permutations are generated by
        3-cycles: (a b)(a c)=(a b c), (a b)(c d)=(a b c)(c a d) So all you need
        to be able to show is that you can do this sort of thing. You can use
        the fact that the group clearly acts 3- transitively on the corners and
        on the edges (in fact you can do rather more) to show that everything
        can be placed using conjugation provided you can display an edge 3-cycle
        and a corner 3-cycle. Exhibiting these last facts should be easy, so the
        only thing you need to worry about is the 3-transitivity (all this means
        here is, for instance, that for any 3 edges a, b, c and any 3 edge
        positions x, y, z you can find a move that takes a to x, b to y and c to
        z). (Alternatively, you can use a few 3-cycles and then show
        conjugations that will allow you to generally place everything.) You
        then need to show that the total edge flip is invariant modulo 2 and the
        total corner twist is invariant modulo 3. (Then you can exhibit a double
        edge flip (which doesn't permute the pieces) and a double corner twist
        (which doesn't permute the pieces) and use 2- transitivity, a
        consequence of 3-transitivity) to show you can orient the pieces - using
        conjugation.) To show invariance, you only need show invariance under a
        set of generators - typically the 6 usual generators. The tedious part
        will be defining the orientation (particularly for edges) which you can
        do lexicographically by ordering the faces. You should probably leave
        the checking of invariance (once defined) as an exercise. Show it for a
        couple of faces, probably at least one of these should exhibit that the
        orientations can be changed. After that, it's easy to calculate the
        total number of positions which must be (8!*12!)/2 * 2^11 * 3^7.

        taking off your socks and &gt; then putting on your shoes and then
        pulling your socks over them. &gt; Taking off your socks and shoes don't
        commute and they have a &gt; non-trivial commutator - you get a double
        tranposition (each sock &gt; switches position with the corresponding
        shoe). On the other hand &gt; taking off your gloves and taking off your

        (forget that you just pulled &gt; your socks over them) and then put

        half the group - but generally it &gt; is not the case that the
        commutator subgroup contains only commutators. &gt; &gt; In general, the
        conjugate permutations A'B'A and B'AB are closely &gt; related to B' and
        A respectively. (For instance, if (a_1...a_k) is a &gt; cycle in the

        cycle in the cycle structure of B'AB.) In particular, you can &gt;
        design your commutator to cancel things out. If b fixes a_1 and a_2 &gt;
        then A'B'AB is going to fix a_1 for example (A will take it to a_2 and
        &gt; then B'AB will take a_2=b(a_2) to b(a_1)=a_1).

        I once came up with a "visualization" I like better (because I can't
        really imagine a light-year, it's so abstract). Imagine all of human
        kind has done nothing but cubing since it was invented. So let's say 6
        billion people and 30 years. And let's say we've all been cubing 24h
        each and every day, making one move per second. Finally, let's assume
        that this world wide project is so well-organized that we don't waste
        our time by producing duplicate states, i.e. everybody creates a new
        state with every move. I won't do the math again (you can ;-) but I
        think it turned out that only 13% or all states have ever be reached
        somewhere somewhere by someone. Of course some assumptions might
        slightly differ from reality and the fraction of explored states might
        thus be smaller. I was actually quite surprised by this when I computed
        it. A friend of mine had asked me "don't you get the same states again
        and again?" and that's why I did it. It convinced me that when I
        randomly scramble, most of the states I get to while scrambling have
        *never appeared anywhere*. Still awesome. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        get them to take this as given - otherwise you &gt; likely won't have
        time to finish. It could take some time to prove.) How about doing it
        this way: There are many ways to decompose a permutation, but there's an
        equivalence deterministic value. The number of "wrong pairs" in the
        sequence. Number the corners 1-8. Let's look at this state: position: 1
        2 3 4 5 6 7 8 cubie there: 6 8 1 7 4 3 5 2 There are many ways to
        "solve" (i.e. sort) this with swaps. But let's compute the number of
        pairs in wrong order. First number is six and 1-5 are all behind it, but
        they should come before it. So that's five wrong pairs. The 8 has 6
        smaller numbers on it's right. So, 11 wrong pairs so far. The 1 has no
        smaller numbers on the right. Let me summarize it for all: 6 8 1 7 4 3 5
        2 (the cubie numbers) 5 6 0 4 2 1 1 0 (smaller numbers on the right)
        Sum: 19 The point is, that you have no choice (like you have a choice
        which swaps to do for solving). What's this number good for? Well, it's
        even if and only if the sequence can be ordered by an even number of
        swaps. This is quite easy to prove and I leave it to you ;-) Here's the
        idea: The sorted sequence has an even number of wrong pairs (namely
        zero) and it's solvable with an even number of swaps (namely zero). And
        whenever you do a swap, the number of swaps done overall changes its
        "evenness" and at the same time the number of wrong pairs changes its
        "evenness", too. Cheers! Stefan

        Hi, the only answer to the question in the subject of this message that
        makes sense to me is: disqualifying competitors using corners-first
        method (or its variation), because most people use Fridrich/Petrus based
        solution anyway... Sure, the slice turns can be slower to perform for
        most people, but it is really unimportant for FMC as well as not using
        non-optimal UR group sequences that may be better for speedcubing. Do
        slice moves really mean any advantage? Do they move more pieces in more
        suitable way, or less pieces to perform permutations better? I have to
        say that in my opinion the answer is 'no'. If we analyze face turn: the
        number of pieces moved (wrt. the rest of cube) 4 ed. + 4 corn. the
        number of facelets moved (depends) max. 4x2+4x3 For the slice turn: the
        number of pieces moved (wrt. the rest of cube, although not compact) 4
        edges + 4 centers the number of facelets moved max. 4 + 4x2 The only
        difference is that for slice turns center pieces are moved instead of
        corner ones. The official rule set up to count slices as 2 turns only
        puts some cubers to a position that they cannot compete... Even though I
        would use only about 5-7 slice turns in an FMC try it is such a big
        handicap that it is not worth participating... What do other think? In
        replies to the "Boost message mail" it looked that more people are
        positive to count slices as one turn. Josef

        You know, I never gave it much thought until now, but in a split second
        of realization I became a staunch advocate of counting slice moves as a
        single move. Upon superficial inspection, I though "Yeah, that's 2
        moves..." but now I don't think so. Here's my reasoning: Think of a
        4x4x4 cube: F is one move, everyone would agree. f (as long as you don't
        turn F with it) is one move... a little more subjective, but I think it
        would be hard to refute this. I give you the following sub-logic: If f
        is not 1 move, it must be a combination of moves of parallel faces. The
        parallel faces on a 4x4x4 are B,b,F. However, b must be a combination of
        moves of parallel faces: B,f,F Therefore any move f or b when considered
        to be a combination of moves of parallel faces would have to be
        infinitely many moves. ex: f = F' B' b' = F' B' (F B f) = F' B' (F B (F'
        B' b))=... Reductio ad absurdum. Now think of a 3x3x3: F is one move f
        is one move (same logic as before). Only in this case, f happens to be
        the center slice. Now I know it may not be the best argument in the
        world, but this is the way I'm looking at it right now. I would welcome
        any contradictions! Daniel --- In

        prove.) &gt; &gt; How about doing it this way: &gt; &gt; There are many
        ways to decompose a permutation, but there's an &gt; equivalence
        deterministic value. The number of "wrong pairs" in the &gt; sequence.
        &gt; &gt; Number the corners 1-8. Let's look at this state: &gt; &gt;
        position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 &gt; cubie there: 6 8 1 7 4 3 5 2 &gt; &gt;
        There are many ways to "solve" (i.e. sort) this with swaps. But let's
        &gt; compute the number of pairs in wrong order. First number is six and
        &gt; 1-5 are all behind it, but they should come before it. So that's
        five &gt; wrong pairs. The 8 has 6 smaller numbers on it's right. So, 11
        wrong &gt; pairs so far. The 1 has no smaller numbers on the right. Let
        me &gt; summarize it for all: &gt; &gt; 6 8 1 7 4 3 5 2 (the cubie
        numbers) &gt; 5 6 0 4 2 1 1 0 (smaller numbers on the right) &gt; &gt;
        Sum: 19 &gt; &gt; The point is, that you have no choice (like you have a
        choice which &gt; swaps to do for solving). What's this number good for?
        Well, it's even &gt; if and only if the sequence can be ordered by an
        even number of swaps. &gt; This is quite easy to prove and I leave it to
        you ;-) Here's the idea: &gt; The sorted sequence has an even number of
        wrong pairs (namely zero) &gt; and it's solvable with an even number of
        swaps (namely zero). And &gt; whenever you do a swap, the number of
        swaps done overall changes its &gt; "evenness" and at the same time the
        number of wrong pairs changes its &gt; "evenness", too. &gt; &gt;
        Cheers! &gt; Stefan Yes, but there's the issue of showing that it's not
        possible (in some other, possibly non-canonical, way) to solve using a
        different number (modulo 2) of transpositions - that's crucial if you
        want to show that a permutation can't be both odd and even - which is
        key to being able to compute the size of the group, for instance. It's
        equivalent to showing that the identity can't be expressed as a product
        of an odd number of transpositions (if sigma is both odd and even then
        you can write sigma*sigma' as a product of an odd number of
        transpositions). The identity has no pairs in the wrong order (in terms
        of your post) but it's not completely trivial to show that it can't be
        written as a product of an odd number of transpositions in some way. I
        guess the usual way to do it would probably to be to write the identity
        matrix (of the appropriate size) as a product of an odd number of
        permutation matrices (corresponding to transpositions). Since each
        transposition matrix has determinant -1 (you just need to swap 2 rows to
        make it the identity matrix, which has determinant 1) then the identity
        matrix would have determinant (-1)^k for some odd k, i.e. -1, a
        contradiction and so the result would follow by reductio ad absurdum. Of
        course, you'd need to prove (or assume) facts on determinants - 1) the
        determinant is homomorphism from the multiplicative ring of matrices
        into the underlying ring (this may require certain facts about the
        underlying ring, but they'd be satisfied here) and 2) interchanging 2
        rows (or columns) in a matrix changes the determinant by a factor of -1.
        (You'd probably just need rows or columns, depending on which way you
        write your permutations, but if you can prove that the determinant is
        invariant under transposing the matrix then you get two for the price of
        one anyway.)

        public = Math students, I thought it would be a nice idea to tell &gt;

        how many positions you can make. Now, I know how to prove that it's &gt;
        impossible to make an odd permutation, but what's the easiest way to

        &gt; (and it's not really beautiful), so does anyone know a (short) way

        Also, to avoid being very boring, I am looking for some nice facts &gt;
        about the cube... For example: I once heard some tax-laws of Hungary

        Wow! You just changed my mind. Well, actually you *split* my mind ;-) So
        far I've always voted for counting it as 2 turns. That's because when I
        solve the cube it "feels" slower than a face turn and so I wanted to
        "punish" it. Now I realize that we should take the *purpose* into
        account. And I vote: - 2 turns. For speedsolving purposes, for example
        to automatically choose among different algs (e.g. computed by ACube).
        Here I'm interested in fast execution and slice turns do feel slower
        generally. - 1 turn. For fewest moves solving purposes. Here execution
        speed doesn't matter and so for this purpose I agree counting it as 1
        feels more natural. Thanks for making me (us?) aware of the difference.

        &gt; Yes, but there's the issue of showing that it's not possible (in
        some &gt; other, possibly non-canonical, way) to solve using a different
        number &gt; (modulo 2) of transpositions - that's crucial if you want to

        to being able &gt; to compute the size of the group, for instance. It's
        equivalent to &gt; showing that the identity can't be expressed as a
        product of an odd &gt; number of transpositions (if sigma is both odd
        and even then you can &gt; write sigma*sigma' as a product of an odd
        number of transpositions). &gt; The identity has no pairs in the wrong
        order (in terms of your post) &gt; but it's not completely trivial to
        show that it can't be written as a &gt; product of an odd number of
        transpositions in some way. That's easy, isn't it? Assume that a certain
        permutation can be solved one way with 12 swaps and another way with 7
        swaps. Let's assume our permutation has 5 wrong pairs. Since each swap
        changes the "even/oddness" of this number, the 12 swaps can obviously
        not really solve it. Only an odd number of swaps can solve an odd
        permutation since every swap changes the oddness of permutations and the
        identity is not odd. My point mainly was that you can "read" the
        even/oddness of a permutation *without* writing it as some cycles.
        Writing it as cycles is bad because there are different ways to do so.
        Writing it in "raw" form there's just one way to do so. So unless
        there's a good reason to do so (e.g. blindfold solving) I'd suggest not
        to use cycle notation, but instead "raw" order. I do understand your way
        of using permutation matrices and determinants, but that's just not
        really solving the problem, is it? Writing a permutation as a product of
        permutation matrices also has the problem that there are infinitely many
        different ways to do so. And it wastes a lot more of paper/pencil, too
        ;-) Cheers! Stefan &gt; I guess the &gt; usual way to do it would
        probably to be to write the identity matrix &gt; (of the appropriate
        size) as a product of an odd number of permutation &gt; matrices
        (corresponding to transpositions). Since each transposition &gt; matrix
        has determinant -1 (you just need to swap 2 rows to make it the &gt;
        identity matrix, which has determinant 1) then the identity matrix &gt;
        would have determinant (-1)^k for some odd k, i.e. -1, a contradiction
        &gt; and so the result would follow by reductio ad absurdum. Of course,
        &gt; you'd need to prove (or assume) facts on determinants - 1) the &gt;

        Hi Per, Joel, et al, I find it interesting that even though you can
        can't move only one pair of corners or edges and nothing else, you also
        cannot only move the four centers of a slice to their adjacent sides of
        that slice. In other words you can swap two edges without swapping two
        corners (and vice versa) if you don't require that all the centers stay
        in place. In yet other words, if you physically remove two corners of a
        cube and switch them it is the same as physically switching two edges.
        Now, if you do that and move the center slice one quarter turn and,
        leave the centers there as you solve the rest of the cube, you can solve
        ther rest of the cube including swapping those two corners back.

        things I like, and the &gt; &gt; public = Math students, I thought it
        would be a nice idea to tell &gt; &gt; them something about the cube...
        For example, how you can calculate &gt; &gt; how many positions you can
        make. Now, I know how to prove that it's &gt; &gt; impossible to make an
        odd permutation, but what's the easiest way &gt; to &gt; &gt; prove that
        all even permutations are possible? (I know how to prove &gt; &gt; this,
        but my proof is a bit complicated to explain to a non-cuber &gt; &gt;
        (and it's not really beautiful), so does anyone know a (short) way &gt;
        &gt; to prove it so a non-cuber can understand it quickly?) &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Also, to avoid being very boring, I am looking for some nice
        facts &gt; &gt; about the cube... For example: I once heard some
        tax-laws of &gt; Hungary &gt; &gt; were changed, because of Mr. Rubik.
        Or: When you make a line of 43 &gt; * &gt; &gt; 10^18 cubes (with all
        different cubestates) you get a line with a &gt; &gt; length of xxx(?)
        light-years. Does anyone know more interesting &gt; &gt; facts like
        this? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for helping me :), &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Joel.

        for counting it as 2 turns. That's because when I solve the cube it
        "feels" slower than a face turn and so I wanted to "punish" it. Now I
        realize that we should take the *purpose* into account. And I vote: - 2
        turns. For speedsolving purposes, for example to automatically choose
        among different algs (e.g. computed by ACube). Here I'm interested in
        fast execution and slice turns do feel slower generally. - 1 turn. For
        fewest moves solving purposes. Here execution speed doesn't matter and
        so for this purpose I agree counting it as 1 feels more natural. Thanks

        someone else recently, the one and only metric regarding speedcubing is
        the timer. Of course, sequences like E2S2M2E2S2M2 are VERY slow. But
        M/M' often are much faster than a half turn of any face (M'UM'UM'U
        faster than 10moves/sec if you count M' as two moves). You know that
        there are many criteria that make moves faster than others, that's why
        people spend their time trying to optimize sequences for their hands.
        For example, the minimization of cube reorientations is very important,
        even if they don't appear in many written "algorithms" (it's normal,
        because different people may execute the same sequence differently). I
        could go on for ages talking about what a "speed metric" should include.
        My idea is that people shouldn't think about all of these points when
        considering a metric for a FMC. Forget speed. Forget some computer
        programs too, for them it's more efficient to work with fixed centers
        and half turns. Take a 1x1x1 cake. Divide it into three equal parts,
        three times (following the three orthogonal planes). The inner slices
        are as good as the others. I remember when I first saw the cube, it was
        not a bunch of corners and edges, it was just a perfect 3x3x3 matrix and
        you could move any row or column magically. Sure you can solve the cube
        without moving M, S or E, but you can solve it with DLB fixed, without
        moving D, L or F too. I see slice moves as normal moves (as I do with
        bigger cubes), and I've yet to read a valid point that could make me
        change my mind about it (yes, I'm an open-minded guy ;-) ). I understand
        why people have problem considering the cube my way. It's a matter of
        how they look at it. If they solve the cube 100 times a day thinking
        with sides only, thinking with slices seems weird. And there's the
        dexterity thing of course. But it's a bit sad because, for example, you
        can't see how simple many commutators based on slices can be, and
        they're not only useful in corners-first methods. It's like speaking
        using a reduced vocabulary. Slice moves may appear as complex moves
        because of the mechanics inside the cube (6 axes - but a 3x3x3 could
        have been built around a sphere). I consider them as physically and
        mathematically simple (it's not like considering a RU'R'U fingertrick as
        a basic move, even if complex sequences can improve your "vocabulary").
        There's another subject: Half-turn or quarter-turn metric? I think there
        are three reasons for people to use an half-turn metric: - Formulae are
        shorter and simpler to write. - It's actually easy to think with
        half-turns. - You just have to turn your hand a bit more. My opinion is
        that R2 is clearly made of two R (or R') basic moves. You can think with
        half-turns just as you can think with RU'R'U sequences, but they're not
        physically simple. This is just a personal point of view of course, I
        don't write official rules. HTM is the worst metric you can imagine for
        a FMC (remember SQTM?), but I'll still try to attend CubeStation's
        competitions :-) Gilles. PS#1: By the way, there's no limit on the
        number of competitors for CubeStation's challenges. Come with us! PS#2:
        3x3x3 scrambles could include slices too ;-) PS#3: Notation is not
        really important to me, as long as we can understand each others, but I
        agree that M/E/S is a bit confusing, and I don't see why slices would
        require such specific names. PS#4: Mister Kociemba, could you please

        &gt; permutation &gt; &gt; matrices (corresponding to transpositions).
        Since each transposition &gt; &gt; matrix has determinant -1 (you just
        need to swap 2 rows to make it &gt; the &gt; &gt; identity matrix, which
        has determinant 1) then the identity matrix &gt; &gt; would have
        determinant (-1)^k for some odd k, i.e. -1, a &gt; contradiction &gt;
        &gt; and so the result would follow by reductio ad absurdum. &gt; &gt;
        Ok, I read your exact reasoning again. I think we're actually saying
        &gt; pretty much the same thing, the difference is just that you're
        talking &gt; about "determinants" of "matrices" and I'm talking about
        "wrong pairs" &gt; of "raw order". Well, I'd need to define mine more
        precisely, yours &gt; are two simple words that are well-known already,
        so... you win ;- ) &gt; But I still say our proofs are equivalent...
        &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan Actually, my main point is that you need
        to show that oddness/evenness can't both occur at once. To be odd just
        means that the permutation can be expressed as a product of an odd
        number of transpositions - to be even is similarly defined. There is a
        question of whether it is possible to be simultaneously odd and even
        that needs to be addressed. You've defined oddness/evenness differently,
        in terms of wrong pairs and described a canonical way of defining it, so
        providing a well-defined notion of odd vs even. What it doesn't prove is
        that it is impossible to write an odd/even permutation (as defined like
        this) as a product of an even/odd number of transpositions. (In other
        words, if you didn't do it canonically and just switched pairs and
        eventually came to the identity in some non-methodical way, how would
        you know that you always take an odd (or always take an even) number of
        transpositions.) You do make some reference to this: 'And whenever you
        do a swap, the number of swaps done overall changes its "evenness" and
        at the same time the number of wrong pairs changes its "evenness", too.'
        but it is a technical issue that does require a bit of proof (and is
        equivalent to the fact that the identity permutation can't be written as
        the product of an odd number of permutations). If you could flesh out
        the bit I quoted from you above, we'd be on the same track. I guess the
        way I'd tackle it using your definition is to look at a permutation (a
        b) (where a&lt;b, say). So you have 1 2 ... a-1 b a+1 a+2 ... b-1 a b+1
        ... The number b has (b-1)-(a-1)=b-a smaller numbers on the right,
        namely a,...,b-1. The numbers a+1,...,b-1 all have just 1 smaller number
        to the right (namely a). All the other numbers have no smaller numbers
        to the right. So the total number of wrong pairs is
        b-a+((b-1)-a)=2b-2a-1 which is odd. So by your definition a
        transposition is odd. Now you just need to work the quoted bit above to
        the effect that if you compose 2 permutations the number of wrong pairs
        is (modulo 2) just the sum of the wrong pairs in the permutations. (It
        won't generally be the sum, only the sum modulo 2 - and that is the key
        thing here, to be able to prove that.) The sum of an odd number of odd
        number is odd, but due to the specific way you've defined odd/even it is
        something to be proven that composing permutations actually does behave
        as hoped. (In your example, for instance there are 6 smaller numbers to
        the right of the 8. If you compose with another permutation, will there
        be an even or odd number of smaller numbers to the right of the 8? I've
        not investigated, but perhaps this depends on more than whether the 2nd
        permutation is odd/even on a number by number basis, though not for the
        whole sum.)

        Hi Dan H, Gilles, Stefan, Josef, Like Gilles I consider each of the
        three layers equal to the others, since R r L' rotates the whole cube
        (QR). (I use the lower case letter for slice moves). I think the
        difficulty comes from technique. Take the sequence r U r U r U r U which
        flips over four edges. With a good technique this can easily be done as
        quickly as R U R' U' done twice. I think that if someone is not used to
        slice moves it's much the same as someone not being used to doing any

        Wow! You just changed my mind. Well, actually you *split* my mind ;-)
        &gt; &gt; So far I've always voted for counting it as 2 turns. That's
        because &gt; when I solve the cube it "feels" slower than a face turn
        and so I &gt; wanted to "punish" it. Now I realize that we should take
        the *purpose* &gt; into account. And I vote: &gt; &gt; - 2 turns. For
        speedsolving purposes, for example to automatically &gt; choose among
        different algs (e.g. computed by ACube). Here I'm &gt; interested in
        fast execution and slice turns do feel slower generally. &gt; &gt; - 1
        turn. For fewest moves solving purposes. Here execution speed &gt;
        doesn't matter and so for this purpose I agree counting it as 1 feels
        &gt; more natural. &gt; &gt; Thanks for making me (us?) aware of the
        difference. &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In

        the only answer to the question in the subject of this message that &gt;
        &gt; makes sense to me is: &gt; &gt; disqualifying competitors using
        corners-first method &gt; &gt; (or its variation), because most people
        use Fridrich/Petrus &gt; &gt; based solution anyway... &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Sure, the slice turns can be slower to perform for most people,
        &gt; &gt; but it is really unimportant for FMC as well as not using &gt;
        &gt; non-optimal UR group sequences that may be better for speedcubing.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do slice moves really mean any advantage? Do they
        move more &gt; &gt; pieces in more suitable way, or less pieces to
        perform permutations &gt; &gt; better? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have to say
        that in my opinion the answer is 'no'. &gt; &gt; If we analyze face
        turn: &gt; &gt; the number of pieces moved (wrt. the rest of cube) 4 ed.
        + 4 corn. &gt; &gt; the number of facelets moved (depends) max. 4x2+4x3
        &gt; &gt; For the slice turn: &gt; &gt; the number of pieces moved (wrt.
        the rest of cube, &gt; &gt; although not compact) 4 edges + 4 centers
        &gt; &gt; the number of facelets moved max. 4 + 4x2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        The only difference is that for slice turns center pieces are &gt; &gt;
        moved instead of corner ones. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The official rule set
        up to count slices as 2 turns only puts &gt; &gt; some cubers to a
        position that they cannot compete... &gt; &gt; Even though I would use
        only about 5-7 slice turns in an FMC try &gt; &gt; it is such a big
        handicap that it is not worth participating... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What
        do other think? In replies to the "Boost message mail" &gt; &gt; it
        looked that more people are positive to count slices as one turn. &gt;

        I am also split on whether to count slices as one or two moves. My logic
        for it counting as 2 is because a slice actually rotates the internal
        kernel and 2 center pieces so in effect it is 2 moves plus a cube
        rotation when looked at mechanically. A normal move would be
        accomplished by rotating 1 center piece(and the 8 pieces around it of
        course)while the kernel remains stationary. But like Gilles said, the
        cube could be built around a sphere where the kernel would not be
        rotated in a slice. For speedcubing purposes though, if I perform the
        slice as 2 moves(danK Z perm), I count it as 2. If I do the slice as 1
        move(as in L'BLS'L'B'S (I like that alg)), I count it as 1. For fewest
        moves, I would be inclined to count it as 1 move, but I'm not an expert
        in that field. --barefoot Chris

        Hi Eivind, (Very nice subject, btw. Maybe I can use something like this
        for my lecture as well) In Dutch, they are called 'orde', which looks

        &gt; &gt; &gt; A commutator is an element of a group that is of &gt; the

        B' &gt; the inverse of B. &gt; It &gt; &gt; measures the extent to which
        A and B fail to &gt; commute (they commute &gt; if &gt; &gt; the
        commutator is the identity - in that case &gt; AB=BA). &gt; &gt; It's
        like taking off your shoes and then taking &gt; off your socks and &gt;
        &gt; then putting on your shoes and then pulling your &gt; socks over
        them. &gt; &gt; Taking off your socks and shoes don't commute and &gt;
        they have a &gt; &gt; non-trivial commutator - you get a double &gt;
        tranposition (each sock &gt; &gt; switches position with the
        corresponding shoe). On &gt; the other hand &gt; &gt; taking off your
        gloves and taking off your shoes &gt; do commute. If you &gt; &gt; take
        off your gloves and then your shoes (forget &gt; that you just &gt;
        pulled &gt; &gt; your socks over them) and then put your gloves &gt;
        back on and then your &gt; &gt; shoes back on, you should be where you
        started. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The commutator subgroup is the subgroup
        that the &gt; commutators &gt; generate &gt; &gt; - in the cube group
        this is exactly half the group &gt; - but generally &gt; it &gt; &gt; is
        not the case that the commutator subgroup &gt; contains only &gt;
        commutators. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In general, the conjugate permutations
        A'B'A and &gt; B'AB are closely &gt; &gt; related to B' and A
        respectively. (For instance, &gt; if (a_1...a_k) is a &gt; &gt; cycle in
        the disjoint cycle structure of A then &gt; (b(a_1)...b(a_k)) is &gt; a
        &gt; &gt; disjoint cycle in the cycle structure of B'AB.) In &gt;
        particular, you &gt; can &gt; &gt; design your commutator to cancel
        things out. If b &gt; fixes a_1 and a_2 &gt; &gt; then A'B'AB is going
        to fix a_1 for example (A &gt; will take it to a_2 &gt; and &gt; &gt;
        then B'AB will take a_2=b(a_2) to b(a_1)=a_1). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi :-) The idea for finding the maaximum order of a permutation is to
        realise that a permutation is a combination of disjoint corner-cycles
        and edge-cycles. So what u do is to decompose the permutation into it's
        individual cycles. Then simply determine the LCM (least common multiple)
        of these cycles. Also u have to keep in mind what combinations of cycles
        will be possible to yield an overall even permutation. And also u have
        only 8 corners and 12 edges to play with ;-) A formal proof might have
        to list all possible corner-cycle orders and edge-cycle orders?? Or is
        there an easier way to prove this?? An easier example than urs of such a

        Hi Richard, I think you misunderstood me somehow. Especially this part
        makes me think so: &gt; (In other words, if you didn't do it &gt;
        canonically and just switched pairs and eventually came to the &gt;
        identity in some non-methodical way, how would you know that you &gt;
        always take an odd (or always take an even) number of &gt;
        transpositions.) I did *not* define a canonical way for "solving" a
        permutation, but rather a way for "looking" at it. I.e. the wrong pairs
        shall not be swapped in some particular way (there are many ways for
        this), they shall only be counted (there's only one way=result for
        this). In other words, define for a permutation p: federminant(p) :=
        (number of wrong pairs in p) mod 2 What I left as an exercise to Joel is
        to prove: 1) federminant(identity) = 0 2) federminant(swap(p,i,j)) =
        (federminant(p) + 1) mod 2 Where swap(p,i,j) is the permutation you get
        by swapping elements i and j in permutation p. Simple induction shows
        that if you take permutation p, apply k swaps, and reach permutation q,
        you have: federminant(q) = (federminant(p) + k) mod 2 Now assume you
        take permutation p=identity, apply k swaps (with odd k) , and reach
        permutation q=identity. Then you have (everything mod 2):
        federminant(identity) = federminant(q) = federminant(p) + k =
        federminant(identity) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 Contradiction! I don't think
        there's something missing in my proof (other than the exercise part of
        course ;-), hopefully my more formal description above makes clearer
        what I mean. What do you say? Cheers! Stefan

        length 3 and one of length 5. Also, they have wrong orientation, i.e.
        URF-&gt;UFL-&gt;ULB-&gt;RFU instead of reaching URF again. This results
        in the large cycle being solved again after 3*5 alg executions and the
        small cycle after 3*3. Overall LCM(3*5,3*3)=(3*5)*3, the latter factor 3
        coming from the orientation. - Similarly, the edges have two cycles, one
        of length 2 and one of length 7 (I don't care about the remaining 3
        edges). And orientation in each cycle is wrong again. Overall the edges
        need (2*7)*2 alg executions. Then LCM(3*5*3,2*7*2) = 1260 The thing is,
        you want to get as many different prime factors in there as possible. I
        have 2 and 7 from edges, and 3 and 5 from corners. And I can get
        additional factors 2 and 3 from edge/corner orientations. Now for a
        proof you could try out all possibilities of cycle sizes... ;-) Cheers!

        While we're on this topic I thought I would post something related that
        I found. How could one construct an algorithm that would cycle through
        all possible positions of the cube (a "Devil's Algorithm" as I've seen
        it written). The algorithms would be good as long as it cycled though
        all 43252003274489856000 positions on the cube, regardless of whether it
        repeated positions or not. This is of course possible, even with a
        random string of notation that is absolutely enormously larger than the
        number of possible combinations to the cube. However, the interesting
        question is whether or not it is possible to have an algorithm of length
        43252003274489855999 (staring from the solved state) that cycles through
        all possible positions of the cube (including having started at the
        solved state). Maybe it doesn't even have to cycle through all the
        positions, but just have the first 43252003274489855999 moves pass
        through the same number of states (starting from the solved, or
        technically any, state. Maybe you could look at this by drawing a graph
        with 43252003274489856000 nodes as a bipartite graph including all even
        an odd positions, and also grouped together with various characteristics
        (say positions that are all 2 moves away from each other are drawn close
        together). Each position could only reach 18 others, 17 if you include
        the fact that you had to do a move to get to that position. To be more
        precise, only quarter turns would be allowed, since performing a double
        turn is by the purest sense either doing R R or R' R' or some other
        equivalent I honestly haven't put too much thought into this to be
        honest, but it is an interesting question nonetheless. Would using graph
        theory and trying to create some sort of Hamiltonian chain, or even a
        Hamiltonian cycle, work as a way to do this? Since that would take too
        much computing power, are there any patterns we can use to come up with
        such an algorithm? Also would this algorithm have any sort of
        regularity/symmetry/interesting charateristics, or would it be totally
        random in appearance? There would of course be an infinite number of
        algorithms that would achieve this affect, however how many are there
        with length 43252003274489855999, if any at all? If there aren't any of
        that length, what is the shortest possible lentgh you can have to cycle
        through all the positions of the cube? Can you do it without repeating
        any positions at all? Can you repeat positions often, though come up
        with an easy pattern for writing out a Devil's algorithm? I guess the
        holy grail of this would be any algorithm of exactly length
        43252003274489856000 that perfectly cycled through all the possible
        positions of the cube. Such that, starting from any state, if you
        performed this algorithm you would not only end at the same state you
        started at, but have cycled through all possible positions as well. Just
        some questions I thought might spark some conversation. Chris

        Hey Eivind :D Yes u are correct. (FRBL)*315 will yield a solved cube
        again (when u start from solved :- P ) I guess i was confusing with
        supercubing calculations. (FRBL)*315 will have the following effect on
        centers : [F'R'B'L'], all are rotated counterclockwise. So if one wants
        to solve the centers also a power of 1260 is needed. And of course any
        permutation of order 1260 will fix the centers, so this is the maximum
        order also in the supergroup ;-) -Per PS! One can quite easily verify
        orders of permutation using for instance the FMC companion !! Just check
        which is the lowest order yielding a solved cube. Incidentally, for
        FRBL, if it's repeated 105 times u get a corner 3-twist on the D layer

        Hi Chris, I recommend beginning with a sequence which will go through
        all possible combinations of two sides being turned one quarter turn.
        What algorithm accomplishing this has the fewest moves? Is this, going
        through 15 positions, a small enough part of the problem to allow us to

        vital. Then I agree with you. (The point I was trying to make is that I
        thought you were leaving 2) out.) (All the rest is agreed.) &gt; &gt;
        Simple induction shows that if you take permutation p, apply k swaps,

        (federminant(p) + k) mod 2 &gt; &gt; Now assume you take permutation
        p=identity, apply k swaps (with odd k) &gt; , and reach permutation
        q=identity. Then you have (everything mod 2): &gt; &gt;
        federminant(identity) &gt; = federminant(q) &gt; = federminant(p) + k
        &gt; = federminant(identity) + 1 &gt; = 0 + 1 &gt; = 1 &gt; &gt;
        Contradiction! &gt; &gt; I don't think there's something missing in my
        proof (other than the &gt; exercise part of course ;-), hopefully my

        Hey David, that's a really cool puzzle! Just some opening thoughts.
        First it would help to know the numer of possible states that can be

        the same face twice is allowed). I count 115 positions reachable by
        doing two quarter turns. 96 if they are perpendicular faces, 12 if they
        are parallel faces, and 7 if you turn the same face twice in succession.
        The critical thing to notice is that all the positions that need to be
        reached are even permutations, so we have to go through an odd
        permutation to reach each new position. I guess an optimal algorithm in
        this puzzle would be one that reached all 115 positions that need to be
        reached, but never repeated any odd permutation. You could also have an
        algorithm that achieved all 115 positions, but repeated some or multiple
        odd permutations. If an optimal length algorithm exists then it would
        have to be 230 moves long. Assuming you start from the solved state and
        that every second move you achieve a distinct even permutation that is
        also one of our 115. I don't think an optimal algorithm would exist
        though. You could something like R F4 U4 B4 D4 L4 R R F4 U4 B4 D4 L4 R L
        F4 U4 B4 D4 R4 L L F4 U4 B4 D4 R4 To cycle through all 38 positions
        unique to the RL axis, but to get to a positions such as UR where a face
        in the UD axis is turned first, you have to go through the solved state.
        So my proposal for a shortest alg would be the following: any face turn
        followed by a 4 means 4 clockwise turns, just written shorter. 1) cycle
        through all positions unqiue to the RL axis R F4 U4 B4 D4 L4 R R F4 U4
        B4 D4 L4 R L F4 U4 B4 D4 R4 L L F4 U4 B4 D4 R4 2) solve the cube again L
        3) cycle through all the positions unique to the UD axis U F4 R4 B4 L4
        D4 U U F4 R4 B4 L4 D4 U D F4 R4 B4 L4 U4 D D F4 R4 B4 L4 U4 4) solve the
        cube again D 5) cycle through all the positions unique to the FB axis F
        U4 R4 D4 L4 B4 F F U4 R4 D4 L4 B4 F B U4 R4 D4 L4 F4 B B U4 R4 D4 L4 F4
        and you could optionally solve the cube again with B to create a true
        cycle. So my alg is 264 moves if you make it a true cycle by adding the
        final F and is: R F4 U4 B4 D4 L4 R R F4 U4 B4 D4 L4 R L F4 U4 B4 D4 R4 L
        L F4 U4 B4 D4 R4 L U F4 R4 B4 L4 D4 U U F4 R4 B4 L4 D4 U D F4 R4 B4 L4
        U4 D D F4 R4 B4 L4 U4 D F U4 R4 D4 L4 B4 F F U4 R4 D4 L4 B4 F B U4 R4 D4
        L4 F4 B B U4 R4 D4 L4 F4 B and repeates positions therefore 264-230=34
        times. I think, due to the nature of having to have a certain face
        having been turned "first" for many of the positions, that this would be
        an optimal alg. Just my guess though, but I think it works. I doubt my
        reasoning counts as an actual proof, but I think it works out. Chris ---

        adjacent elements a "bubble". Swapping any two elements A and B in a
        sequence is the same as first bubbling A towards B (so they're
        adjacent), then bubbling A and B, then bubbling B back to A's original
        place by undoing the first part. A bubble clearly changes "evenness" of
        the number of wrong pairs. And for a swap, we do (n+1+n) bubbles. So a
        swap changes that evenness, too. Cheers! Stefan

        Hi everyone, Just to let you know, the updated results of the FMC are
        now available from my website. A really great week last week; we had 12
        competitors, making it the most participated-in challenge in the history
        of the FMC! Maybe we could get 13 this week? Thanks to absolutely

        puzzle! &gt; &gt; Just some opening thoughts. &gt; &gt; First it would
        help to know the numer of possible states that can be &gt; reached using
        only 2 quarter turns (assuming that repetition of &gt; turning the same
        face twice is allowed). &gt; &gt; I count 115 positions reachable by
        doing two quarter turns. 96 if &gt; they are perpendicular faces, 12 if
        they are parallel faces, and 7 &gt; if you turn the same face twice in
        succession. Hey Chris, I had meant all positions involving two sides,
        but you are allowing for a side to be turned twice; that's OK with me.
        For clarity's sake I'll lay them all the possibilities out. Two quarter
        turns allowing the second turn to be the same side as the first,
        including repeated positions: (6*2)*(6*2)=144 positions: if same side
        twice isn't allowed (6*2)*(5*2)=120 12 are two turns on one side

        &gt; Matt OzOr Hi Matt, You've confused "finger trick" notation for the
        main notation, which unfortunately is common. The small case letters r l
        u d f b are slices. Some people use r to designate turning two levels R
        and and the center slice next to it like in your file, but in truth they
        are turning L and rotating the cube. To make this clear they are turning
        one level but calling it two. The reason the small case letters are used
        is because it is the same notation as the 4x4x4, and is much easier to
        remember than M E S or "Rs" etc. Regards, David J

        Hi Evan, Tyson, Since negative time is based on the time change from
        Daylight Savings to Standard time, and since this happens in at least 4
        time zones then it can be done 4 times each year. That means Evan's
        average of 12 could be done by the fall of 2007. :) DJ --- In

        How can you say that the small case letters designate slice turns or
        that they don't when there are lots of examples for both cases? There's
        no single answer to this question because there is no single uniform

        &gt; &gt; You've confused "finger trick" notation for the main notation,
        &gt; which unfortunately is common. &gt; &gt; The small case letters r l
        u d f b are slices. Some people use r to &gt; designate turning two
        levels R and and the center slice next to it &gt; like in your file, but
        in truth they are turning L and rotating the &gt; cube. To make this
        clear they are turning one level but calling it two. &gt; &gt; The
        reason the small case letters are used is because it is the &gt; same
        notation as the 4x4x4, and is much easier to remember than M E S &gt; or
        "Rs" etc. &gt; &gt; Regards, &gt; &gt; David J

        I always saw lower case letters as representing turning the layer next
        to the the normal outer layer and it just so happens that on a 3x3, r,
        the layer next to R happens to be a slice. I have seen it used as

        Hi! As regards to physical rotation of the cube i would vote for
        following notation: Fc, Rc and so on. Fc means move F, but let the rest
        of cube move with it. F'c means move F', but let the rest of cube move
        with it. And so on ... Possibly use brackets : F(c), R(c). I find x,y
        and z confusing. Maybe this is something for WCA to look into? Since
        notation will be used in international competitions we might as well

        Not to be the only annoying guy here but I don't see what is wrong with

        Hi Eivind, I can say what I said because I was only stating what I
        prefer and why. In the scheme I use, r *is* a slice move. That notation
        is the simplest scheme. And I shouldn't be labeled as a dictator for
        saying so. My point was that the notation which was posted uses small
        case letters to stand for *two* levels being moved, when in fact one
        level is being moved. This is not the main notation, this is within a
        "finger trick" notation scheme. It should be labeled as such. I
        understand that there is no consensus. Earlier this year I tried for a
        consensus, and I politely asked people not to use small case r l u d f b
        for "finger tricks" since it essentially hijacks the older, simpler
        system. I think a solution to moving all of the slices as one in the
        larger cubes can be found without trashing the system I use. Please note
        that you don't need to insult me to disagree with me. David J --- In

        turning two levels R and and the center slice next to it &gt; &gt; like
        in your file, but in truth they are turning L and rotating the &gt; &gt;
        cube. To make this clear they are turning one level but calling it two.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason the small case letters are used is
        because it is the &gt; &gt; same notation as the 4x4x4, and is much
        easier to remember than M E S &gt; &gt; or "Rs" etc. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hi! Yes, I also agree that there is no other good substitute for M, E
        and S. Not that i can think of anyway. But for x,y,z i think the
        notation i suggested is more intuitive. I think i have seen Ton or Jaap
        use that notation for cube moves and i think it's very elegant. My main
        worry about notation(s) is actually to remove ambiguity. One shouldn't
        need to know what size cube is this notation for? is this fingertrick
        notation or common move notation? Notation should be clear regardless of
        cube size and context within which it's being used. Take for example the
        lowercase : frblud. Now it's being used in at least 3 different ways :
        1) The layers next to FRBLUD respectively (on a 3x3x3 cube that would
        mean one of M, E or S) 2)The middle layer parallell to FRBLUD
        respectively (always corresponds to M,E or S, and would only make sense
        on odd size cube) 3) (on 3x3x3 solely) The layer FRBLU or D and its
        adjacent layer. So in this case it would turn 2 layers. If i have
        understood correctly this is the fingertrick notation. As for notation
        for larger cubes i would support Chris' notation. -Per PS! I did expect
        Dan Harris to support Harris-notation ;-) &gt; --- In

        Re: Cube Notation Guide &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not to be the only annoying
        guy here but I don't see what is wrong &gt; with using M,E,S for inner
        slices and x,y,z for cube rotations. You &gt; only have to memorize two
        conventions, MES corresponds with LDF, and &gt; xyz wit RUF. &gt; &gt;
        With as many algorithms as we all learn, I don't think learning two &gt;
        3 letter acronyms is asking for much more. &gt; &gt; Again I don't mean
        to sound mean or cynical or to shoot anyone's &gt; ideas down, but I
        personally think there is nothing wrong with &gt; M,E,S,x,y,z notation.
        This would even easily extend to larger cube &gt; notation. Personally I
        prefer using r[1,2,3,...,floor((n-2)/2)] to &gt; denote any inner slice
        of the nxnxn cube. I restrict the highest &gt; value to floor((n-2)/2)
        for two reasons. This means you can't do &gt; something like r[4] to
        denote turning l' on a 5x5x5 and also it &gt; leaves room for allowing
        the single letter M to be used for the &gt; middle slice instead of
        either r[3] or l[3]' for the 5x5x5. For &gt; larger cubes I think it is
        clearer to use M,E,S notation than it is &gt; to denote the center row
        on an axis by either of the two sides. &gt; &gt; We haven't agreed on a
        standard notation for the larger cube either, &gt; granted, however I
        think that using M,E,S facillates easier notation &gt; since it also
        expands well to the nxnxn cube. &gt; &gt; Just my thoughts, &gt; &gt;

        Fc, Rc and so on. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fc means move F, but let the rest

        only your opinion. I think it's perfectly alright to think of it as
        turning two layers. Here's one example where I explicitly turn two
        layers *thinking* of it this way, not because it's faster to execute:
        First try this alg: (R' D' R) U (R' D R) U (R' D' R) U2 (R' D R) This
        cycles three U corners. This is part of an LL strategy easy to
        understand even for beginners. Now try this alg (lower case d meaning
        "turn two layers"): (R' d' R) U (R' d R) U (R' d' R) U2 (R' d R) This
        cycles three U corner-edge-pairs (i.e. yet another PLL). See? I don't do
        the double-layer-twist as a finger trick, but use it because it makes so
        much more sense thinking this way. I bet you'd also vote for counting
        inner slice turns as two moves ;-) That said, I'd actually vote for
        "frblud" meaning only the inner slice. I only used it the other way in
        the above example to make the similarity to the first alg more obvious.
        I'd use it for "inner-slice-only" because otherwise this would be
        inconsistent to our notation for 4x4/5x5. In fact, I added yet another
        notation on my 4x4/5x5 algs page to denote the double-layer-twist, but I
        get confused by it myself and look at the other notation instead, so
        I'll remove mine when I update the page again.

        alright to &gt; think of it as turning two layers. Here's one example
        where I &gt; explicitly turn two layers *thinking* of it this way, not
        because it's &gt; faster to execute: &gt; &gt; First try this alg: &gt;
        (R' D' R) U (R' D R) U (R' D' R) U2 (R' D R) &gt; This cycles three U
        corners. This is part of an LL strategy easy to &gt; understand even for
        beginners. &gt; &gt; Now try this alg (lower case d meaning "turn two
        layers"): &gt; (R' d' R) U (R' d R) U (R' d' R) U2 (R' d R) &gt; This
        cycles three U corner-edge-pairs (i.e. yet another PLL). &gt; &gt; See?
        I don't do the double-layer-twist as a finger trick, but use it &gt;
        because it makes so much more sense thinking this way. In your second
        example what you're really doing is: (R' U' B) U (B' U R) U (R' U' B) U2
        (B' U R) as such I see your second one as an excellent example of finger
        tricks, which alter the main notation to better suit the hands. &gt; I
        bet you'd also vote for counting inner slice turns as two moves ;-)
        Actually I'm already on record for counting slice turns as one move.
        &gt; &gt; That said, I'd actually vote for "frblud" meaning only the
        inner &gt; slice. I only used it the other way in the above example to
        make the &gt; similarity to the first alg more obvious. Point taken. The
        relationship between the two algs is very well demonstrated. &gt; I'd
        use it for &gt; "inner-slice-only" because otherwise this would be
        inconsistent to our &gt; notation for 4x4/5x5. Thank you. You are a
        gentleman and a scholar. &gt;In fact, I added yet another notation on my
        &gt; 4x4/5x5 algs page to denote the double-layer-twist, but I get
        confused &gt; by it myself and look at the other notation instead, so
        I'll remove &gt; mine when I update the page again. &gt;

        I am a newbie to the cube but how about using : [R] to mean rotate the
        whole cube around the Right face clockwise [F] to mean rotate the whole
        cube around the Front face clockwise [U] to mean rotate the whole cube
        around the Top Face This would equate to [F] = [L'] and [L] = [F'] By
        enclosing the Letter in the brackets would mean whole cube. And this
        could go futher with F] meaning the right to slices. I personally like
        using x,y,z but it can get confusing. Lets say you want to rotate the
        cube around the x axis. Depending on what side of the cube you are
        looking on right or left, clockwise can mean two different directions.
        That why I can up with the [ ] idea. Would be nice to formulate a "ANSI"
        or "ISO" standard for cube notation. Matt OzOr --- d_j_salvia

        Hi David, Unless I am being extremely stupid here, (it is not unusual
        for me), the co-ordinates on my website are correct. If you put the cube
        at the centre of 3-dimensional co-ordinates, than you can do simple

        Hey! M is neither Rs nor R's ;-) M = RsR'c with the "new" cube-move

        and S extends nicely to any odd size cube. It means always the very

        Lm = R'm E = Dm = U'm S = Fm = B'm This leaves following subscript

        Hi Matt, The convention in the notation that I use has QR, QU and QF for
        cube rotations. People find that Q for "cube" is easy to remember, and
        only takes one extra keystroke. Regards, David J --- In

        I personally like using x,y,z but it can get &gt; confusing. Lets say
        you want to rotate the cube around &gt; the x axis. Depending on what
        side of the cube you &gt; are looking on right or left, clockwise can
        mean two &gt; different directions. That why I can up with the [ ] &gt;

        Hey, that's true, BUT - most people are familiar with x and y axes and
        instinctively know how these work, but people probably wont have come
        across the z-axis unless they take maths at a high level or something.
        So the x and y axes are as they would be in 2-dimensions, and then the
        z-axis must be the dimension that is left. They still make a correct set
        of right-handed axes, just not rotated in the way that one might see in
        a text book. Rotate the cube so that z points up, and you will see :)

        the U layer be stationary for the A and A' parts of an &gt; ABA'B'
        commutator because it's much easier to think that way. The U &gt; layer
        is turned solely for the B and B' parts. Sorry, editting error, that
        should read: R' U' B U B' U R U R' U' B U2 B' U R with no parentheses.
        &gt; This alg is created in &gt; commutator-style. So those U' and U you
        claim I'm doing inside the &gt; parentheses are certainly not what I'm
        doing. Also, I'm certainly &gt; *never* twisting the B face there.
        Looking at it from the point of view of the cube not rotating in space
        (ie the centers stay in place) it is the same algorithm. All I did was
        change the notation and there is nothing to indicte what hand is used to
        hold the cube or rotate it or turn a side. &gt; Don't tell me what I'm
        doing ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually I'm already on record for counting
        slice turns as one &gt; move. &gt; &gt; But if you really see an inner
        slice as a "normal" slice, how come you &gt; don't accept those 3x3
        two-layer-turns as "normal" turns? I wan't talking about what the hands
        do, but only the notation. &gt; Note that I do agree that lowercase
        letters shouldn't mean &gt; double-layer-twists. Good. That's my point.
        &lt; But that's no reason to claim they don't exist &gt; and are
        something else. That's not what I meant. &gt; They are legitimate twists
        and I just think &gt; they should be written as Rr (for example). I
        agree. From that vantage your example could be written as: (R' D'd' R) U
        (R' Dd R) U (R' D'd' R) U2 (R' Dd R) Why don't you try L' U2 L U L' U2 R
        U' L U R' instead? This replaces your 16 moves with 11. And why not do
        R2 B2 R F R' B2 R F' R for your first example? This replaces yours with
        9 moves! It's much faster. &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan Regards, David J

        most people are familiar with x and y axes and instinctively know how

        they take maths at a high level or something. I guess I know a really
        different set of people from what you know. &gt; So the x and y axes are
        as they would be in 2-dimensions, and then the z-axis must be the
        dimension that is left. Even so, why didn't you put the z axis vertical?
        &gt; They still make a correct set of right-handed axes, just not
        rotated in the way that one might see in a text book. Rotate the cube so
        that z points up, and you will see :) But why should I have to remember
        to crank my head around 90 degrees when I'm on your website? Besides,
        that leads to a real pain in the neck. :) &gt; Dan :) Regards, David J

        That sounds good to me also. I've noticed that many people don't like x,
        y, and z, so I'll be happy to change to Fc if this becomes popular. For
        multiple layer turns, Japan Speed Cubing Club already uses these: Fw :
        double layer Ft : triple layer (for 4x4x4+, of course) These can be
        extended to: Md: middle two layers (on 4x4x4) Mt: middle three layers
        (on 5x5x5) Yes, these can certainly be done using Chris' notation (which
        I support). However, as these seem to be used frequently, I thought it a
        good idea that they have a separate notation. What do you guys think?

        Hey! U remember wrong :-) Ever since Singmaster in 1980 or maybe even
        before, Fs has meant turning F and B' (same way in space,) and Fa has
        meant turning F and B (both F and B are turned clockwise). Hence the
        subscripts denote "slice" and "antislice". The original Singmaster
        notation didn't have any inner layer move notation: the M, E and S.
        Those were added later. If i remember correctly this was done by the
        german Christoph Bandelow. Cheers! -Per &gt; --- In

        Hmm, isn't that asking for a position of maximum distance to the solved
        position? I.e. a question that - as far as I know - has not been
        answered yet, only with lower and upper bounds? And your question seems
        to be even more difficult since the position you're after can't even
        have a neighbour of same distance. The only answer I could think of is
        to cheat. Use the empty sequence. That one has length 0. All positions
        reached by another move can be reached in 0-1=-1 moves by "undoing" a
        move. Cheers! Stefan --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Because that's not what I'm doing. Correct, that's not what you are
        doing, and that was my point! I wasn't talking about what you were
        doing, but about how you were writing it down. We have a
        misunderstanding. You think I'm saying that you are doing something
        other than what you are doing. I'm not. I'm saying that your notation
        for that algorithm was "finger trick" notation. I think that finger
        trick notation is not the main notation, and shouldn't have precedence
        over the main notation. One last try to be clear: The effect *on the
        cube* of both (R' d' R) U (R' d R) U (R' d' R) U2 (R' d R) and R' U' B U
        B' U R U R' U' B U2 B' U R are the same, identical every step of the
        way. If you did them both on parallel cubes hanging in space, these
        cubes having the same color scheme, and remain orientated the same way,
        then they would be moving exactly the same way. &gt; Btw, according to
        you, when doing M what you're really doing is (L' R QL), so that's three
        moves, not one. My point was that the same thing can be described many
        ways. &gt; Inconsistent. Not at all. You missed the point. I consider a
        slice move like r to be one move. My point was only that that I think
        that in the main notation if you move one layer you use one letter to
        signify it. &gt; How come we prefer to look at things differently and I
        say &gt; exactly that, while you say I'm wrong and you're right? That's
        not what I'm saying. You mislabeled that algorithm. You said it wasn't a
        finger trick yet the only difference between yours and mine was in how
        you handle it. And how you handle the cube is dealt with in finger trick
        notation. The main notation is about how the cube is affected. &gt; &gt;
        If you don't see that U' (QU) and D'd' are the same thing then &gt; &gt;
        that's not my problem. &gt; &gt; Wrong, it's just not your *view*. In my
        view they're not the same &gt; thing. To your hands they are different,
        to the cube they are the same thing. &gt; The problem comes from our
        different definitions of equality &gt; for algorithms. Right. &gt;
        You're using the cube core as a reference, while I'm &gt; simply not.
        Yes, my reference was the cube itself. &gt; This was my last post on
        this issue because it has become such a waste &gt; of time. My fault. I
        thought it was worthwhile to straighten out the misunderstandings. In
        another post you wrote: &gt; &gt; This was my last post on this issue

        I'm trying to make the case that the main notation should be the primary
        notation and should have some precedence over finger trick notation -
        and thus give people a consistant way to change... and you show me a
        finger trick notation and tell me that it's not a finger trick even

        htm except for superflip and superfliptwist which can be proved to be

        solution: R L D2 B' L2 F2 R2 U' D R' D2 F'B' D' F2 D' R2 U' F2 D'
        Clearly the move R leads to a position at depth 19. By rotating the cube

        R L With this a half turn also can be used as the first move. Therefore

        different (but equivalent) maxima. You can use this to make a (slightly
        dubious) probability argument that maximal positions are more likely to
        be symmetric. That the currently furthest positions are highly symmetric

        Hi (Jaap)! Just a curiosity. The sequence u gave for the superflip does
        contain both quarterturns and half turns. And as u showed any move will
        get us closer to solved state. So, is it a prerequisite that a sequence
        MUST contain both quarter and half turns, as well as being symmetric, in
        order to be global maximum in half turn metric? Back in the mid 80's i
        had great fun working out a solution to the superfliptwist problem. I
        eventually derived a 32 move solution which i was proud of. Until i saw
        it sadly trashed by the Cube Explorer :-P This problem was published in
        the Christoph Bandelow classic "Einführung in die Cubologie". And
        coincidentally i think it was in this book that i for the first time saw
        notation for middle layer moves. He was using MF, MB, MR' and so on. I
        had thought he came up with the M,E and S but rechecking it i was wrong.
        So who did actually come up with the M,E,S notation? Happy (half and
        quarter:-P ) twisting :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        we can only get to depth 15 at most (square group has diameter 15), so
        any optimal solution &gt;length 15 must always have quarter turns in it.
        There is however no reason why there could be no positions at depth 20
        in htm that are also at depth 20 in qtm. In fact, there is one:
        Superfliptwist: R L U F D L U R' F' R F D U' F D' U' B F' L U
        (20f*,20q*) It no doubt has many other solutions of 20f that have half
        turns, and I would use such a sequence to show that this is a strict
        maximum in htm in the same way I did for the superflip. Look at the
        table I have on my site for the 2x2x2 cube:
        http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cube2.htm It arranges all the
        positions in a qtm vs htm table. There are positions at max htm depth
        but not max qtm depth, and vice versa. In fact it spreads out quite far
        along the bottom and right edges of the table. The superfliptwist shows
        that this is the case for the 3x3x3 cube too (assuming diameter 20 in
        htm). Jaap

        Hey again! I know this is getting theoretical now and of no interest for
        SPEEDcubing, but nevertheless ... U said u would prove it s strict

        gonna do that? By conjugates? Not every conjugate will have the
        cornertwists arranged as they should be. One might work out the

        could be no positions at depth 20 in htm that are &gt; also at depth 20
        in qtm. In fact, there is one: &gt; &gt; Superfliptwist: &gt; R L U F D
        L U R' F' R F D U' F D' U' B F' L U (20f*,20q*) &gt; &gt; It no doubt

        use such a sequence to show that this is a strict maximum in &gt; htm in

        the positions in a qtm vs htm table. There are &gt; positions at max htm
        depth but not max qtm depth, and vice versa. In &gt; fact it spreads out
        quite far along the bottom and right edges of the &gt; table. The
        superfliptwist shows that this is the case for the 3x3x3 &gt; cube too
        (assuming diameter 20 in htm). &gt; &gt; Jaap

        yes i went on auto-pilot typing the puzzle and obviously the question is
        "quarter" turn metric. and of course this 'little detail' makes all the
        difference. so indeed the solution is RRLLUUDDFFBB length 12. obviously,
        finding the solution in half- turn metric is 'hard', although clearly a
        solution must exist. sorry for confusing everyone. i am not a
        mathematics expert, but i wonder how one would go about finding the
        solution in half turn metric without doing an exhaustive search. whoever
        can solve the half-turn metric case is very clever indeed. --- In

        Most of what I said was about htm where it can happen, but in qtm the
        parity ensures that all maxima are strict. The reason is that every
        quarter turn changes the permutation parity (of the corner pieces).
        Therefore the parity also shows whether the solution length in qtm is
        even or odd. Positions one turn away from a maximum cannot therefore be
        at the same depth (nor further away by definition of maximum) and so
        that maximum is strict. Jaap

        Hi Guys, Appropo of nothing, I've always thought of this as 3 moves: r2
        f2 u2. In my notation, which apparently few others use, slice moves are
        indicated by lower case letters. I see each layer of the cube as equal
        to the others, and I count any move as one move whether it is a 90
        degree turn or a 180 degree turn. ...not that I have anything against
        the quarter-turn metric. :) Regards, David J --- In

        typing the puzzle and obviously the &gt; question is "quarter" turn

        difference. so indeed the solution is &gt; RRLLUUDDFFBB length 12.
        obviously, finding the solution in half- &gt; turn metric is 'hard',
        although clearly a solution must exist. &gt; sorry for confusing
        everyone. &gt; &gt; i am not a mathematics expert, but i wonder how one
        would go about &gt; finding the solution in half turn metric without
        doing an exhaustive &gt; search. whoever can solve the half-turn metric

        dead ;-) Or, me (and my brother) improved the notation by defining Rs as
        a (in our sense)true slice move. Nothing was comme il faut in the
        eighties. Anyhow, no big deal as long as we understand each other.
        However, we do agree upon the antislice notation. BUT, one issue is that
        I am proponent of a specific notation of a slice move (that is, a move
        that only displace a middle layer). AND that a slice move should be
        counted as one move. As you might understand, I'm a 'corners first' guy.

        are not rounded (though new ones might be now, just ask him) and look
        like they could be a little larger. But the quality is great, I used a
        3x3 set already and it's great. And he did it in the color scheme I
        asked him to do (like my 3x3). Cheers! Stefan

        Hey everyone, I wanted to wait until I finished updating both my OLL and
        PLL pages before posting, but it's taking longer than I expected to do
        both and homework is eating up most of my free time. Anyway, I finished
        updating my OLL page to reflect the algorithms I currently use, and I
        made a few other changes as well. I've included all algorithms that I
        use, included algorithms from other angles and also any reflections. I
        wrote the algorithm for each case in standard notation, as well as in
        finger trick notation. I tried to make the finger trick notation as
        detailed as I could to show exactly what I am doing for each alg. I
        include explanations for weird or longer triggers, as well as all double
        layer turns and all cube rotations that I do. So if anyone is
        interested, or is still learning the OLL step, then my new up-to-date
        page is at http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/3-orientations.html I am
        also working on my permutations page to reflect the actual algorithms
        that I use now (these pages were out-of-date by over a year), and also
        to make the finger trick notation more detailed as I did for my OLL
        page. For anyone learning the OLL let me know if you like the setup. I
        figured I would try to include every alg, rather than to just say "learn
        the alg from other angles" etc.. Anyway I just wanted to let those who
        are working on the OLL step know about this page. Chris

        Hi! I just recorded a video of myself speedsolving the 5x5x5 cube. The
        quality aint all that great, but it's ok. Still need to experiment more
        with my webcam. It's not the usual pairing-up-edges or 3x3x3-reduction
        approach. I use my own method for solving the larger cubes. For those
        who don't know it the method is roughly like this : 1) Do first layer by
        intuition. Normally i do corners first. Then i try to get as much as
        possible for "free". I don't necessarily solve all centers of first
        layer at this stage. But i MUST solve the middle center. When this is
        done i hold the first solved layer to the left. 2) Edges of 3 middle
        layers (r,M and l layers). First i orient the layers so that i get as
        much as i can for free. And i need to solve the 4 middle centers while
        doing that! Then the rest of the edges are done with 3-cycles. I also
        cycle blocks of edges, either to solve many edges in one alg, or
        otherwise to either remove badly placed edges into last layer, or into
        better position in the middle layers. The basic 3-cycle solves only 1
        edge. Other 3-cycles could solve 2 or more at the same time. 3) Final
        layer corners and edges. I do corners first, position then orient. Then
        normally i will do the middle edges next. This makes it easier to spot
        how to cycle the rest of the edges (more 3-cycles again). I guess this
        way of doing last layer is a bit similar to how Masayuki Akimoto does it
        with his columns method. Here i can also cycle blocks of edges. Parity
        is fixed with a simple inner layer turn, pluss an edge 3-cycle. This
        will mess with the centers, but not all that many are solved yet at this
        stage. 4) Rest of centers. Again i use lots of 3-cycles. Most of them
        exchange centers between 2 adjacent faces. I can also cycle blocks of
        centers. 2x1 blocks or even 3x1 blocks in some cases. I also have some
        special algs for exchanging ceneters between opposite faces. Now that u
        have read all of that, here is the link the the video :
        http://vakt.idi.ntnu.no/Per_5x5x5_2_38_9.wmv I can't guarantee that i

        solve it I notice that I can't OLL. So Im asuming that someone took it
        apart and put it back wrong. My question is can I just take off all the
        stickers and put new ones on (solved) or do I have to take it apart?

        Finger tricks are very fast, so fast you can't analyze them correctly on
        standard videos formats. If you use an analog camcorder, here's
        something interesting you can try. Use odd/even interleaved video fields
        to double your frame rate, as it is explained on this (wonderful) page:
        http://www.100fps.com/ You get 50Hz (=PAL*2), or 60 Hz (=NTSC*2). With
        my slow modem and small web space, I can't show you the difference, but
        believe me, for a speedcubing video, it changes everything! Gilles.

        You could take off the stickers and put them back on solved, I guess,
        but I can't guarantee you they would stick on afterwards. You'd probably
        be better off just popping out the offending pieces and putting them
        back in right. Then again, I can't guarantee you that that would work
        smoothly either, since I don't know what kind of cube it is, but I
        reckon the odds for breaking the cube are fairly small. --- In

        Hi Chris, thanks fot the update. Hmm, actually I wasn't even aware you
        had described your 3x3 algs ;-) Comments: 38A) Do you mean the BLU
        corner before or after the (L') turn? I find it easier to hit the FLU so
        that it lands at BLU, than to hit BLU (so that it lands at BLD). 38B) I
        also pull the last turn with the ring finger, but I use the other hand.
        Ever tried that? I love it. I also think there are mistakes. What I'd
        write is: "Do the first trigger like (R' U') (R U') triggering the first
        U' with your left index finger. Do the (R' U2 R) as (R' U2 R) triggering
        the (R) with your right ring finger. 13) Try this one: Left thumb on D
        center, right thumb on F of FR edge, middle finger on opposite stickers.
        Then do (l' U r' U' [lR] [Ud]'). The [..] means at the same time. Do the
        [Ud]' using your left index finger to push the UFL corner to UFR. Now
        regrip with right hand only and do (l' U l F'). General) To make it even
        clearer how you execute algs, add a "'" to double turns as well, e.g.
        "U2'". Cheers! Stefan

        Hey Gilles! I'm still a newbie when it comes to recording/editing
        movies. I didn't even add an intro (or outro) to my vid. And no captions
        whatsoever. I think it was u Gilles mentioning that i could add a clock
        in a few secs with Vegas Video? How do i do that? Do i actually need to
        make a screen capture of a clock and overlay it? Or can i add the clock
        by "scripting" ? And by the way my 5x5x5 video was recorded using my
        webcam, Logitech Pro 4000. Can i play that framegame with that camera?
        It will record in raw uncompressed avi format. I then use a simple free
        program to convert to wmv, any bitrate that i like. I also have Virtual
        Dub that i use mostly for joining avi or repairing files. Cheers!! -Per
        PS! I have a 33 move solution to this weeks FMC. Hope to cut it down by
        more clever insertions ;-) &gt; --- In

        I took the cube apart and tried to put it together solved and go figure
        there were three cubies with the stickers moved on them. I guess the

        Ten days ago I was so naive... Newbies like me should be made to wait a
        week or two before they post :-) I made a nice little 3 step solution to
        the 2x2 that is modified from Blake O'Hare's Simple Solution:
        http://ozor.homeip.net/cube/MO-Cube-2x2.pdf It's a pretty slow solution.
        I only average around 70 secs to solve with method but could probably
        get under 60 with a little more practice. Step 2 is the real killer
        sometimes taking three to four repeats of the algorithm. Here is the
        cheat sheat that I made modified from Blake O'Hare's 3x3 solution:
        http://ozor.homeip.net/cube/MO-Cube-3x3.pdf Going to master Blakes

        Fridrich. Any ideas or corrections welcomed... Thanks again Matt Ozor

        average of five under tournament conditions (computer scrambles,
        stackmat, 15 seconds inspection, etc.) Ryan Patricio 26.55 (66.79)

        For scrambling the clock, I'd use the one on Jaap's Page
        (http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/clockscramble.htm) As for the
        pyraminx, I wrote a scrambler a while back. It's in the files section
        under "puzzle_scrambler.pl", although the user interface leaves a lot to
        be desired. I only point to it because I don't know of another one. I
        have an HTML form system for the program, but currently lack a server to
        run it on. It's a horrid program anyway, but if you want, I can send you
        the file and more specific instructions for use. Also, in terms of
        pyraminx scrambling, there's a question I've had for a while that I
        can't seem to find an answer to, so I'll ask the group: How many of the
        tips must you scramble on the pyraminx? Should it always be 4? A number
        between 1 and 4? I notice now, looking at the WCA regulations
        (http://www.speedcubing.com/events/regulations.html) that there are even
        set programs for the cubes, the Megaminx, Clock, and Square-1, but the
        Pyraminx is off the list completely. What should the regulation (for the
        program and for number of tips) be? -TSBischof --- In

        any other cubie. Because there is a difference between changing the cube

        worked like a charm and there is no need for further files. If you want
        to host it though I could probably provide some space for you (free of
        course). Just let me know. In my opinion each tip should be scrambled a
        random number of times which would mean that an average of 3 tips would
        be scrambled (one already solved on average). /Gustav --- In

        As for the pyraminx, I wrote a scrambler a while back. It's in the &gt;
        files section under "puzzle_scrambler.pl", although the user &gt;
        interface leaves a lot to be desired. I only point to it because I &gt;
        don't know of another one. I have an HTML form system for the &gt;
        program, but currently lack a server to run it on. It's a horrid &gt;
        program anyway, but if you want, I can send you the file and more &gt;
        specific instructions for use. &gt; &gt; Also, in terms of pyraminx
        scrambling, there's a question I've had &gt; for a while that I can't
        seem to find an answer to, so I'll ask the &gt; group: How many of the
        tips must you scramble on the pyraminx? &gt; Should it always be 4? A
        number between 1 and 4? I notice now, &gt; looking at the WCA
        regulations &gt; (http://www.speedcubing.com/events/regulations.html)
        that there are &gt; even set programs for the cubes, the Megaminx,
        Clock, and Square-1, &gt; but the Pyraminx is off the list completely.
        What should the &gt; regulation (for the program and for number of tips)

        move the clock backwards (i.e. -1 means turn back one step). Zero
        obviously means you do nothing. The same goes for any line
        d=&lt;number&gt;, where you turn any corner clock next to a pressed
        button. When you have reached the bottom, you will have done up to 14
        random turns. It gives a random button pattern if you like that kind of

        Hey Eivind, That case is similar with the case on the 4x4x4 where one

        probably solve it with the same alg. I use: (R ² r ²) B ² U ² (L l) U ²

        Hey Eivind! Take it apart approx like u would on a 3x3x3 cube. Turn top
        layer about 45 degrees. Then use a knife or something to lift one "outer
        edge" out. It could be that this can only be done while lifting out the
        2 other edges of that "triplet". It depends how loose ur cube is or
        isn't ;-) First few times it feels rough disassembling it :-0 As for
        gluing that x-center, make sure u glue it a proper angle so that it
        won't be too tight. Make sure that an outer edge will slide easily in
        between the head and base of that center, on both sides ;-) Make sure of
        this before the superglue dries, so u need be a little fast ... With my
        UHU superglue it will be strong and durable after about 1/2 day.
        Probably less, but im a chicken ... lol ... Use enough glue so that the
        gluing looks a bit like welding on a bike frame. remove excess glue with
        a sharp knife or sandpaper. If u don't remove this excess glue u will
        find that the x-center wants to rotate as u slide inner layers :-( Too
        little glue and the joint might be brittle. Good luck !! -Per &gt; ---

        Ever scrambled or solved the cube core? I certainly haven't. But I've
        done that with the cube numerous times. Your argument of rotating a
        solved cube only applies to the *solved* cube. It's not applicable when
        we're talking about making turns.

        Thanks for the extensive lecture on gluing, Per, but I managed to fix it
        without taking it apart =). So I'll keep the first disassemble until
        it's a lot looser, when I can pop that piece out without it feeling like
        I need a weapon of some kind, lol. =) --- In

        Take it apart approx like u would on a 3x3x3 cube. Turn top layer &gt;
        about 45 degrees. Then use a knife or something to lift one "outer &gt;
        edge" out. It could be that this can only be done while lifting out &gt;
        the 2 other edges of that "triplet". It depends how loose ur cube is
        &gt; or isn't ;-) First few times it feels rough disassembling it :-0
        &gt; &gt; As for gluing that x-center, make sure u glue it a proper
        angle so &gt; that it won't be too tight. Make sure that an outer edge
        will slide &gt; easily in between the head and base of that center, on
        both sides ;-) &gt; Make sure of this before the superglue dries, so u
        need be a little &gt; fast ... With my UHU superglue it will be strong
        and durable after &gt; about 1/2 day. Probably less, but im a chicken
        ... lol ... Use enough &gt; glue so that the gluing looks a bit like
        welding on a bike frame. &gt; remove excess glue with a sharp knife or
        sandpaper. If u don't remove &gt; this excess glue u will find that the
        x-center wants to rotate as u &gt; slide inner layers :-( Too little
        glue and the joint might be brittle. &gt; &gt; Good luck !! &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        just got my brand new 5x5 cube. I have tried solving it &gt; a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; few &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; and found that what I know from the 4x4 is transferable

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cases. The other times I run into
        two peculiar &gt; situations &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pairing (tripling?) up the last one or two edge
        groups. &gt; What &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happens &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; is this: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All edge groups match up fine except for the last
        one, &gt; where &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the two &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; outer edges are flipped differently from the inner one. I &gt;
        have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; idea &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how to fix this one. Help? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All edges groups match
        up fine except for the last two &gt; where &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the two
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; middle edges need to be swapped
        between them. I can use &gt; an alg &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stefans site to fix this, but it preserves a
        bit more &gt; than I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder if there isn't a
        shorter alg somewhere. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am guessing both cases are related and caused by
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indistinguishable &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        centers and bad permutations of them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There seems to be very little on the
        net for this cube. A &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shame &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; really. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; So, can anyone give me any hints on the above two cases?

        from Season 8 (I looked it up, aired around 4:30PM Central time). I
        can't find the sound bite, or even the quote anywhere. If memory serves,
        it went something like this "...like a dangoll rubik's cube man, you
        twist it and get one side and the dangoll other side messed up..." It's
        bugging me that I can't find any acknowledgement of the quotes existance
        though! Daniel

        Well, he probably moves (almost) as as guy's like Shotaro or Chris
        Hardwick, but his moves are very different because he uses a method that
        is essentially different. If you want to get really fast, it will take
        you a lot of time and practice. A good place to start would be Jessica
        Fridrich's website (http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html). I
        would not recommend learning alg's directly from her website, though,
        because I think it's a bit hard to customize them to your own hands.
        http://www.speedcubing.com/peter/ Has some pretty good and 'user
        friendly' algorithms. Don't get scared when you see all these hundreds
        of algorithms, by the way. Just go one step at a time. First learn a
        simple beginners solution (you already know it), then slowly expand you
        solution with more and more algs. For example, I started with a solution
        that uses 5 algs. Then I learned a 4 look last layer. (probably about 3
        extra algs). Then I learned Fridrich first two-layers. After that I
        learned a 3 look last layer (etc.). Other advice: Don't ever try to
        achieve anything because you want to feel good about yourself, or
        something... Only start memorizing these algs when you really enjoy it
        :). If you have any more questions, you can ask here, or send me an e-

        Hi guys, I am just about to dislike this discussion. It is still about
        the same thing. So I felt I should post some words here that many people
        can ignore... David, you have simply sticked to YOUR mental model of the
        cube and cannot understand that it is not the only one possible (or the
        best one because the cube mechanism is accidentaly close to it). You can
        understand (maybe not you, but someone else can :)) 3x3x3 cube as an
        extension of 2x2x2 in several ways. either adding 3 middle layers or
        adding 3 outer layers. 2x2x2 has one corner used as a reference
        (original mechanism, not the Eastsheen one). Using fixed corner is just
        another model of handling the cube. Somebody even do not thing about
        cubies, but about stickers and colors (some blindfolded cubers do). I
        have programmed many cube related programs and handling of the cube (the
        actual model) is important and there is no best way. E.g. in ACube the
        fixed core is used, however, if I used fixed corner, I could make corner
        table more efficient, because I could combine corner permutation and
        orientation into one number. In addition, new number "core" with 24
        states would appear and it could be combined with other numbers.... In
        this case the double-layer turns are elementary... For corner-first
        people cube core is really not any reference. (when solving corners, the
        core is ignored and afterwards, the solved corners are used as a
        reference where all the edges and centers should be placed). For these
        purposes, replacing double-layer turns by single-layer turn + cube
        rotation as well as replacing slice turns by 2 face turns + cube
        rotation is not compatible with the model used in this case.... It has
        nothing to do with finger tricks at all... Try to be more open to accept
        model of other people. Btw. reality as you understand it is just another
        model that your brain constructed. It may be far away from the models of
        other people.... Best regards, Josef &gt; &gt; If you take a regular
        Rubik's cube apart and remove all the edge &gt; &gt; and corner cubies,
        thus leaving only the core, you will find that &gt; you &gt; &gt;
        *cannot* scramble the core. &gt; &gt; Thanks for agreeing with me. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; But I've done that with the cube numerous times. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; You need to specify what you mean, because when you
        scramble the &gt; &gt; cube you still cannot scramble the core. &gt;
        &gt; Thanks for agreeing with me. &gt; &gt; &gt; Consider the three
        layers L, R and the slice between them, and &gt; &gt; forget about how
        they are in your hands. Where you say you are &gt; turning &gt; &gt; R
        and that slice together, I am saying it is the same as turning L. &gt;
        If &gt; &gt; you consider the cube in space with no other reference,
        then what &gt; &gt; moves *is* L. &gt; &gt; In one case, yes. In the
        other, R and the middle slice are moved. &gt; &gt; I can easily describe
        the effects of a move when I use the core cubie &gt; as a reference. I
        just need to say where the other 26 cubies are &gt; before and after the
        move, *relative* to the core cubie. Now I want to &gt; see how you do
        that when your reference is "the cube". I bet you &gt; can't.

        Hi, vaseline is not really good if you want your cube last long.
        However, it can be really useful if you want to make your cube much
        smoother. Since petroleum-based lubricants dissolves cube plastic, it
        can help to break in faster. Also in the begining the cube feels to be
        easier to move (is less noisy and more smooth). As soon as your cube is
        smooth enough, clean the cube from vaseline and use silicone oil. It
        should be then even easier to move.... I have the experience because I
        got some (about 10) old original cubes from a plastic-recycling company.
        All were about 20 years old... Even if there was vaseline inside, cubes
        were not destroyed, but were much looser... But also were smoother than
        the other ones... Regards, Josef &gt; Does any one know if Vaseline is a
        bad lubricant for the Rubik's &gt; cube and if it will cause the plastic
        to deteriorate?

        Hey Joel that was some good advice for a beginner like myself. Seeing
        100+ algorithms is very overwhelming at first. Learning a simple
        solution then expanding apon it makes great sense. For myself solving
        the F2L almost comes naturally, after you learn a few basic moves. So
        now if I'll just start incorporating Fridrich and hopefully in a "YEAR"
        I'll be "speed-solving". Thanks Matt --- joel_vn &lt;joel_vn@...&gt;

        Hi Josef, (and Stefan) &gt; I am just about to dislike this discussion.
        It is still about &gt; the same thing. Yeah, I've been making the
        mistake of thinking that I had to keep clarifying what I meant. You guys
        seem to view this as being argumentative. Up to now I've been thinking
        that I'm terrible at expressing myself, but now I conclude that you guys
        don't understand English very well. &gt; David, you have simply sticked
        to YOUR mental model of the cube &gt; and cannot understand that it is
        not the only one possible You are wrong in both cases. You have missed
        the context of my posts. The context of what I've been writing here is
        about *the simplest* description of moves. While I am well aware that a
        movement of one side can be described as a movement of the other side
        and the middle slice together, that description is *not* the simplest.
        &gt; (or the best one because the cube mechanism is accidentaly &gt;
        close to it). I am not saying that anyone else's model is wrong. Nor am
        I unable to understand other's models. My notation isn't "accidentally"
        close to the cube's mechanism. And I'm not saying it's the best. This
        whole thing started with lots of people complaining about the confusion
        caused by having multiple models of notation. I suggested going with the
        simplest notation, and making a distinction about finger tricks. I was
        trying to help the community reach a consensus and have a single
        notation. If the community doesn't want a consensus that's fine with me.
        This reminds me of the conversation with the math expert who doesn't
        know that a point on a line is infinitely thin and that there can be an
        infinite number of points on any line. So a line from zero to one can be
        used to represent an infinite quantity. (See post 8118) &gt; You can
        understand (maybe not you, but someone else can :)) &gt; 3x3x3 cube as
        an extension of 2x2x2 in several ways. &gt; either adding 3 middle
        layers or adding 3 outer layers. &gt; 2x2x2 has one corner used as a
        reference (original mechanism, &gt; not the Eastsheen one). &gt; Using
        fixed corner is just another model of handling the cube. Using a fixed
        corner is also the main model for counting different positions in the
        2x2x2. You have clouded the situation more: if you look at a picture of
        a person you can't invert picture and say it's a different person - yet
        you just did the equivalent with the 2x2x2 in your example, and Stefan
        did it with the 3x3x3. &gt; For corner-first people cube core is really
        not any reference. &gt; (when solving corners, the core is ignored and
        afterwards, &gt; the solved corners are used as a reference where all
        the edges &gt; and centers should be placed). I am aware of using
        different references, corners as reference or centers as reference, and
        that how a person thinks of the cube can vary. I have no problem with
        that. In fact I took the pains to make it clear that I understood it, I
        guess you missed that it was part of what I was saying. No, I'll come
        out and say it: you totally missed the point of what I was saying. But
        you have to solve the corners to have them be the main reference, you
        don't need to solve the centers in order to make them the main
        reference. &gt; For these purposes, replacing &gt; double-layer turns by
        single-layer turn + cube rotation &gt; as well as replacing slice turns
        by 2 face turns + cube rotation &gt; is not compatible with the model
        used in this case.... Exactly. You are mixed up - trying to tell me what
        I've been trying to tell Stefan. I introduced this idea early on. I gave
        that example in part to make the point that an alg can be described
        differently for different purposes. &gt; It has nothing to do with
        finger tricks at all... It has to do with how you look at the cube.
        Fully half of what I've been talking about is *making this distinction!*
        In terms of notation, one part of finger tricks is the position of the
        cube in your hands, i.e. how you are looking at it. There is a diffence
        between the simplest expression and expressing the same thing from some
        other points of view. I lumped it under finger tricks because others do.
        To repeat: this "other point of view" you are trying to tell me about
        was the argument I presented at first. And Stefan, &gt; &gt; If you
        consider the cube in space with no other reference, then what &gt; &gt;
        &gt; moves *is* L. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In one case, yes. In the other, R
        and the middle slice are moved. But, for what the fourth time, "R and
        the middle slice" together are *not* part the simplest notation. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; I can easily describe the effects of a move when I use
        the core &gt; cubie &gt; &gt; as a reference. I just need to say where
        the other 26 cubies are &gt; &gt; before and after the move, *relative*
        to the core cubie. Now I &gt; want to &gt; &gt; see how you do that when
        your reference is "the cube". I bet you &gt; &gt; can't. I already did.
        Why don't you learn to read and understand English correctly? Nevermind.
        You all are too sure of what I mean regardless of what I mean. David J

        to dislike this discussion. It is still about &gt; the same thing. &gt;
        So I felt I should post some words here that many people can &gt;
        ignore... &gt; David, you have simply sticked to YOUR mental model of
        the cube &gt; and cannot understand that it is not the only one possible
        &gt; (or the best one because the cube mechanism is accidentaly &gt;
        close to it). &gt; You can understand (maybe not you, but someone else
        can :)) &gt; 3x3x3 cube as an extension of 2x2x2 in several ways. &gt;
        either adding 3 middle layers or adding 3 outer layers. &gt; 2x2x2 has
        one corner used as a reference (original mechanism, &gt; not the
        Eastsheen one). &gt; Using fixed corner is just another model of
        handling the cube. &gt; Somebody even do not thing about cubies, but
        about stickers &gt; and colors (some blindfolded cubers do). &gt; I have
        programmed many cube related programs and handling of the &gt; cube (the
        actual model) is important and there is no best way. &gt; E.g. in ACube
        the fixed core is used, however, if I used fixed &gt; corner, I could
        make corner table more efficient, because &gt; I could combine corner
        permutation and orientation into one number. &gt; In addition, new
        number "core" with 24 states would appear and &gt; it could be combined
        with other numbers.... &gt; In this case the double-layer turns are
        elementary... &gt; &gt; For corner-first people cube core is really not
        any reference. &gt; (when solving corners, the core is ignored and
        afterwards, &gt; the solved corners are used as a reference where all
        the edges &gt; and centers should be placed). For these purposes,
        replacing &gt; double-layer turns by single-layer turn + cube rotation
        &gt; as well as replacing slice turns by 2 face turns + cube rotation
        &gt; is not compatible with the model used in this case.... &gt; &gt; It
        has nothing to do with finger tricks at all... &gt; &gt; Try to be more
        open to accept model of other people. &gt; Btw. reality as you
        understand it is just another model that &gt; your brain constructed. It
        may be far away from the models of &gt; other people.... &gt; &gt; Best
        regards, &gt; &gt; Josef &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you take a regular
        Rubik's cube apart and remove all the &gt; edge &gt; &gt; &gt; and
        corner cubies, thus leaving only the core, you will find &gt; that &gt;
        &gt; you &gt; &gt; &gt; *cannot* scramble the core. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Thanks for agreeing with me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I've done
        that with the cube numerous times. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You
        need to specify what you mean, because when you scramble &gt; the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; cube you still cannot scramble the core. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Thanks for agreeing with me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Consider the three
        layers L, R and the slice between them, and &gt; &gt; &gt; forget about
        how they are in your hands. Where you say you are &gt; &gt; turning &gt;
        &gt; &gt; R and that slice together, I am saying it is the same as
        turning &gt; L. &gt; &gt; If &gt; &gt; &gt; you consider the cube in
        space with no other reference, then what &gt; &gt; &gt; moves *is* L.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In one case, yes. In the other, R and the middle
        slice are moved. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can easily describe the effects
        of a move when I use the core &gt; cubie &gt; &gt; as a reference. I
        just need to say where the other 26 cubies are &gt; &gt; before and
        after the move, *relative* to the core cubie. Now I &gt; want to &gt;
        &gt; see how you do that when your reference is "the cube". I bet you
        &gt; &gt; can't.

        Hey everyone, I recently have taken the liberty of deleting a few posts,
        and there are a few others recently that are questionable as well. I
        like to allow the discussion on this group to be as open as possible,
        but there are a few rules. Please always make the discussion as open and

        Hi, I've just mailed the results to Ron, so they might appear on
        speedcubing.com in the near future. The results are actually complete
        since we sadly didn't have the time to finish the rest of the events. We
        we obviously a bit optimistic but we hope to fit in thise events at

        Found your post. Looks like it was posted at around the time I was in
        the US at the start of the year, so I missed it. Since I'm off to China
        on holiday on Tuesday I'd better try to reply right now. It's been a
        while now but as I recall, from scanning the emails, you were wanting to
        look at densities of primes by (effectively) looking at the density of
        non-primes (and subtracting from 1 if you want to get the densitiy of
        primes). Thus you were looking at 1/2+1/3-1/6 etc. I will agree with you
        that you can define density so that 1/2 of the numbers beyond a
        particular point are divisible by 2 and 1/3 are divisible by 3 so that
        1/2+1/3-1/6=2/3 are divisible by either 2 or 3. There's a bit of a
        problem though in proceeding like this. The sum you get is not
        absolutely convergent so the order in which you add the terms is
        important. This is a strange property of infinite series which people
        may or may not be aware of - if the series you are adding up is
        conditionally but not absolutely convergent then if you add up the terms
        in a different order you can get different answers. In fact, by
        appropriately ordering the terms you can get any limit you want or you
        can get divergence etc. (By the way, at this point it might be as well
        to add that the recurring number 0.9999.... does equal 1, in respect of
        the end of your post, as can be seen by the definition of 0.999... which
        is the sum of an absolutely convergent series). One problem with
        1/2+1/3-1/6 is that the -1/6 corrects for multiples of 6 (that have
        already been accounted for in the overlap of accounting for 2 and then
        3) but by the time you need to account for multiples of 6 you should
        already have accounted for multiples of 5. i.e. 1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6. It
        would seem that it is the limit (if it exists, which it should) of f(x)
        where f(x) is defined as the sum of -[(-1)^s(y)]/y where 1&lt;y&lt;=x is
        square free and s(y) is the number of prime factors of y. (Summed over
        increasing y) In other words, f(2)=1/2 and if x+1 is not square-free
        then f(x+1)=f(x) and otherwise f(x+1)is either f(x)+1/(x+1) or
        f(x)-1/(x+1) according as x+1 is a product of an odd or even number of
        primes. The limit of this sum should then be the density of non-primes.
        Thus the partial sums would look like: f(2)=1/2 f(3)=1/2+1/3
        f(4)=1/2+1/3 f(5)=1/2+1/3+1/5 f(6)=1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6
        f(7)=1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6+1/7 f(8)=1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6+1/7
        f(9)1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6+1/7 f(10)=1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6-1/10 Of course, this isn't
        really the true density either, but - and I've not really thought about
        this - presumably in the limit it should become 1, since in the limit
        pi(x)/x tends to 0. The true density of non-primes, up to x, would be
        1-pi(x)/x (where pi(x) is the number of primes less than or equal to x).
        There are various asymptotics for pi(x)/x (as given by the Prime Number
        Theorem) for example. The Riemann Hypothesis provides for better
        asymptotics (if it is true). Zeno's paradox is only a paradox because at
        the time of Zeno, limits were not well-defined. In the example of the
        arrow, one can also say that the arrow takes half as much time for each
        step and conclude that time never passes. (If we could reach a point in
        the future, we'd have to get half way there, then half of the remaining
        time etc., so we'd conclude that time never passes and of course then we
        couldn't have shot an arrow to begin with!) The fact is that there is a
        number, namely 1, to which the partial sums in the Zeno example become
        arbitrarily close provided you take sufficiently many terms. Such a
        number is defined to be a limit of the sequence - I've been a bit loose
        in my language here but the precise definitions are well known. Further
        more, because the real numbers are endowed with a Hausdorff topological
        structure (even a metric space structure) this limit is unique and we
        can well-define 1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16+...=1 (and similarly
        1/10+1/100+1/1000+1/10000+...=1/9 etc.). Basically, in looking at things
        concerned with infinite series you have to be extra careful - not that
        I've been too careful in this email (I've not examined the series
        1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6+1/7-1/10+1/11+1/13-1/14-1/15+1/17+1/19-1/21-1/22+... for
        convergence for example). My complaint about 1/2+1/3-1/6 etc. is that it
        is not immediately obvious that this will converge and, if it does, that
        it will converge to the correct answer. I presume that this would
        continue 1/2+1/3-1/6+1/5-1/10-1/15+1/30+... and more generally, after
        +1/p the next terms would correct in some way (whether ordered by
        denomiator or by number of factors in the denominator and then by
        denominator is not clear). Whether the sum I gave will converge (and if
        it does, to the correct answer) is also something to question. I've not
        checked it, as I mentione above, but it does seem to me that it would be
        a more anatural order. Even so, it's not the correct formula for the
        partial densities either - but the whole point is that pi(x) isn't easy
        to approximate, without using something like the prime number theorem,
        anyway. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "d_j_salvia"

        these ideas in English, and I see it has led to &gt; misunderstanding.
        Put aside formal language for the moment. &gt; &gt; Infinities have
        finite aspects: though a series of numbers like &gt; 1,2,3,4 is
        considered to have no end (that is no limit finite meaning &gt; an end
        or a limit) it has a beginning. It also has individual numbers &gt; like
        1 or 10,000,001 which is another finite aspect. SO in relating to &gt;
        an finite aspect of an infine series you (logically and fairly) realte
        &gt; to a fiven point so the group of numbers divisible by 2 is larger
        than &gt; the group of numbers divisible by three, so i consider the
        subset to &gt; be of different sizes as well. &gt; &gt; If you take
        *all* of the numbers in the infinirte set 1,2,3,4 and &gt; so forth, and
        consider that as one whole thing you can relate to the &gt; idea of
        infinity equalling one if you graph it. So on our graph as the &gt;
        position of the number 2, half of all the numbers after that are not
        &gt; prime, this is what I meant by density, after the number 3, you
        have &gt; 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/6 of the numbers after that are not prime, so
        the &gt; "density" of non-prime numbers grows and the density of
        possible prime &gt; numbers drops. &gt; &gt; To clarify, I was using
        density to mean the *percentage* of numbers &gt; beyond a prime that are
        not prime. &gt; &gt; You can chart this, in numerical order one step at
        a time, and &gt; after a while obtain a line with characteristics that
        can be noted, &gt; and from which it may possible to predict where the
        next prime is &gt; likely to fall. &gt; &gt; For this density to reach
        zero would mean that there were no prime &gt; numbers after a particular
        point, which I don't think can happen. &gt; &gt; *** &gt; &gt; People
        are misled by misunderstanding a term. They don't understand &gt; that
        they're dealing an infinity of finite objects and they neatly &gt;
        overlook what that means. &gt; &gt; When you misplay infinities you get
        things like 1/9 = .11111... &gt; (point one unending) and 8/9 =
        .88888... (point eight unending) so 1/9 &gt; + 8/9 +=9/9 = .99999...
        (point nine unending) = 1. &gt; &gt; This is like Zeno's paradox that .9
        unending is an infinite series &gt; of nines, almost getting to one but
        not quite. &gt; You shoot an arrow at a fence then describe it as "the
        arrow goes &gt; halfway there, then half way there, etc." Thought the
        arrow hits the &gt; fence the description never gets there. &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right, the
        order is important. I though that it could be &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        graphed &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the different projections
        could be tested. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        What do you mean by "projections could be tested"? What are &gt; &gt;
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; projections and what would the test be?
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and from the next post
        4008 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why not add
        and subtract them in numerical order? That's how &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; they fall naturally. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; That's not actually true because for each fraction you're &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; actually &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; including or excluding
        an infinite number of numbers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; So you make "one" the unit of infinity; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can't really do that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Of course you can. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, you
        can't. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are strange properties of
        infinite &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sets - e.g. there are as many even numbers
        as whole numbers or &gt; &gt; as &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fractions. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know this is a common misunderstanding. All
        infinities are not &gt; &gt; &gt; the same size. Those who claim they
        are have not thought it &gt; &gt; through. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Whilst not all infinities are the same size, all infinite subsets
        of &gt; &gt; the natural numbers are and they all have the same order
        type too &gt; &gt; (in the usual well-ordering). I have thought about
        infinities quite &gt; &gt; a lot actually. I did a Ph.D. in set theory.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus you need to be able to define a
        particular notion of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; density (generally something
        like the limit of pi(x)/x as &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; x-&gt;infinity is the
        sort of thing). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, the density changes
        as the occurances of primes progresses. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, the
        density is defined to be the limit, not a succession of &gt; &gt;
        values. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the primes this
        density &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; becomes 0 in the limit (as it is
        approximately asymptotic to &gt; &gt; things &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like
        1/(ln x)). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, the density *never* reaches
        zero. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The density is defined to be the limit and
        this is 0. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you graph
        1/2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (you add 1/3 and you subtract 1/6) &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; graph that as a point above 1/2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; (you add 1/5 - you subtract 1/10 and 1/15) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        graph that etc. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The
        graphed points end up defining a slope. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Each
        addition is a prime, the subtractions are a correction &gt; &gt; for
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doubling, so the point on the slope is marked
        after the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corrections. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This won't converge because it can't. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why can't it? &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing to converge with, overall. You do want
        it to give you &gt; &gt; &gt; something useful at particular points, but
        you have to go to the &gt; &gt; next &gt; &gt; &gt; step an define those
        points. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Converge "with" rather than to? Am I to
        assume you are talking about &gt; &gt; converging with respect to some
        non-standard topology. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        haven't really given it any thought as to whether it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        can or not - clearly it isn't absolutely convergent but you are &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; saying that it can't converge. If that's true then it's
        not &gt; &gt; really a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; good definition of density
        (which should be a value in [0,1]). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Overall it can't be because of the open ended nature of it (the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; infinit aspect) but in individual cases it can give a density
        for &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; region of whole numbers. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The infinity aspect is not a difficulty though,
        unless of course you &gt; &gt; are denying the possibility of inductive
        sets or some other axiom &gt; &gt; for infinite sets, in which case you
        can't even have a set of primes &gt; &gt; anyway. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; There's lots of information embedded there and multiple
        &gt; &gt; ways to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; project where the slope is
        going, for example, take a running &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; average &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; of the difference over two or more points, or three or
        more &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; points, or &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more, and
        graphing them, etc. Several such averages just might &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; converge. :) Do you see what I mean? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Surely if it couldn't converge the slope couldn't be going
        &gt; &gt; anywhere! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If overall the limit
        is zero, this line can head for the limit &gt; &gt; &gt; infinitely and
        it will never arrive. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are
        formal definitions of limit though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I
        assume you want to look at something like a Cesaro sum. I &gt; &gt;
        still &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can't see why you can add all of your 1/2 and
        1/3 before &gt; &gt; subtracting &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your 1/6. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because the sieve will be the wrong size for a
        region of whole &gt; &gt; &gt; numbers if you don't state it correctly.
        There is no one density - &gt; &gt; you &gt; &gt; &gt; need a means for
        plugging in specific primes to have a go at the &gt; &gt; next &gt; &gt;
        &gt; prime. The region of the next prime will have a different density
        &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; non-primes than any other prime. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd have to disagree in general. Certainly
        different (contiguous or &gt; &gt; otherwise) subsets will have
        different densities of primes, but &gt; &gt; that's not really what the
        question at the heart of it is, which is &gt; &gt; to get approximations
        for pi(x) (or pi(x)/x) for large x. &gt; &gt; For instance, since you
        seem to be going for a density at every &gt; &gt; step - what about
        {1,2,3,4,5}. You'd have 1/2+1/3-1/6+1/5 (and &gt; &gt; possibly
        -1/10-1/15+1/30) for the density of composites if I follow &gt; &gt; you
        because you have subtracted 1/6 before you added 1/5. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; If you still disagree with me in terms of the infinite stuff, can
        &gt; &gt; you at least tell me from what level you are coming to it so
        that I &gt; &gt; know what level of formality you are using. &gt; &gt;

        Hey all, I'm looking for a program for a 5x5 cube that I can download.
        Anyone know of any program that you can enter in the colors that you
        have on your cube and it will spit out an algorithm that can be used to
        solve it? I know how to solve the entire cube, but I can't remember the
        algorithm to swap two same color edge cubies in the bottom layer once
        the rest of them have been oriented and permuted. Any help would be much
        appreciated! Chris

        It depends what you mean. If you're solving for speed, you'll use more
        moves than if you think about every step. If you mean the average for a
        perfect solution treating each step in isolation, I would guess it's
        something like this: S1: 5-6 S2: 5 or so S3: 5 S4: Hardest to say...
        10-12 maybe If you're doing the final layer strictly as the individual
        steps I think you'll get S5: 6, S6: 9, S7: 9 That adds up to about 50. I
        expect anyone who does it seriously to learn more than those simple
        steps, and you'll get fewer moves the better you get. In my new final
        layer approach I get under 15 moves for the final layer, which would
        give you 41. An other sample is my 13 solutions on my example page which
        had these averages: * S1+S2: 10.2 turns * S3: 5.6 turns * S4: 11.3 turns
        * S5-7: 15.4 turns * Total: 42.5 turns This method is much less explored
        than Fridrich, so there isn't nearly as much info around. /Lars On Nov

        Originally I had the idea of a 4x4 "2-generator" in order to solve the
        parity problems fast. Well, haven't gotten anywhere with it, but last
        night I tried just for fun to completely scramble and then solve the
        4x4, only using UuRr (well, also u' etc of course). My first time I
        didn't have a plan and went this way: 1) solved centers first somehow
        intuitively 2) then solved the corners like 3x3 2-gen, then solved edges
        using lots of 3-cycle-commutators (uuugly, using up to 8 setup moves or
        so) 3) I had the damn parity problem, set up the last edge 4-cycle
        pieces into the r slice, did an r turn, then undid the setup moves 4)
        fixed the centers of the r slice with several (again ugly)
        3-cycle-commutators Woo, that was painful, especially the long setup
        moves and undoing them. Overall my time was 36:33.36. Then I changed the
        method completely and my record after several improvements and some
        practice now is 2:20.35. If I can improve by another factor like that,
        I'll use this as my standard 4x4 method ;-) Go try it, it's fun and it's
        a free puzzle if you already have a 4x4 cube ;-) Cheers! Stefan

        check out Discovery Channel on that date! Just to warn you, I was

        Don't know whether this might be useful in some method, but maybe
        someone will like the alg anyway: R2 (Uu)2 (Rr) U2 (Rr)2 U' (Rr)2 D2 l
        D2 (Rr)2 U (Rr)2 U2 (Rr)' (Uu)2 R2 Look at the l slice at the point of
        the l move, notice the pattern of the center pieces in the l slice. That
        was the intention, and I just searched for a short way to reach it. Also
        l2 and l' can be used instead of l of course. If you leave away the R2
        at start and end, you'll see the alg I originally constructed. But the

        Ok, here's one that builds the pattern using adjacent centers: (Ll) U
        (Rr)' U' (Rr)' U' (Rr)' U' F' (Ll)' U' In HTM it loses 11-7 against the
        other one I suggested, but in QTM it wins 11-12, since it only consists
        quarter turns. They're also quite easy to execute and there's a
        repetition (doing (Rr)'U' three times). The above alg builds the pattern
        in the r slice, so with r as the master turn we'd overall get this alg:
        (Ll) U (Rr)' U' (Rr)' U' (Rr)' U' F' (Ll)' U' r U (Ll) F U (Rr) U (Rr) U
        (Rr) U' (Ll)' The effect doesn't look that nice, but you can for example
        follow it with the also quite easy [LUL'U',r] = (L U L' U') r (U L U'
        L') r' and then altogether we've swapped two edges (not edge pairs). I'm
        still wondering what the shortest possible way is to build that
        center-pattern on a slice. This is the right time for the people to
        speak up who already have 4x4 solvers ;-) Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Hey all, its getting kinda slow around here. Anyway, the 2nd generation
        stackmats are now out and I'm wondering if these will be the new
        standard for speedcubing competitions for timing. I like the fact that
        the timer is seperate from the mat and can be disdonnected from it. For
        speedcubing purposes, the mat is pretty useless and without it, the
        timer is much more compact. I suspose the mat does make a nice surface
        for slamming the cube down after a solve but the mini mat speedstacks
        sells is sufficient for that. What do you all think about them?

        Wow, I haven't posted a real message here in a while. I was thinking
        that the Mini Mat would be enough as well, but both mats costs about the
        same. The complete timer set is $59.99. The timer alone is $50. The
        Mini-Mat is around $10... It's the same price for a smaller mat. (What a
        rip off!) As for slamming the cube down...I don't think the 2nd gen mats
        are up for that kind of abuse. The touchpads are on elevated plastic, so
        if we "slam" our hands onto the timer, it would probably
        hurt...Especially if we catch an edge. At one point, the plastic casing
        will crack. I think 1st gen Stackmats are better for cubing... That's
        just my opinion. -Sunil --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hello friends, Recently, we've been thinking about a new strategy for
        last-layer corners analysis, with weird F2L configurations. I've
        uploaded a table with 69 configurations, in case someone is interested
        in developing this approach: http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Step_3.html

        Hi Jim. The number of "looks" is simply the number of stages you go
        through to completing the last layer. A 2-look last layer usually
        involves first twisting all the pieces so they are correctly orientated,
        and then permuting them (putting them all in the right place). An
        alternative is orienting and permuting the edges in one step, and then
        orienting and permuting the corners. This is also 2-look. 3-look means
        3-steps are needed, usually twisting the edges, then twisting the
        corners, then finally permuting all the pieces. DanH :-) _____ From: Jim

        Hey James, I think it will be around 56 algs not counting reflections
        but counting inverses. Counting reflections as well it should be
        somewhere around 88. These are just rough estimates, I didn't do an very
        exact count, but I tried to get an idea from looking at the different
        ways to combine the 27 corner orientations with the 24 edge permutations
        and see where some of the positiosn were symmetrical. The number of
        cases to learn will be less than 100, and the number of algs (including
        inverses and reflections) I'm pretty sure will also be less than 100. My
        rough estimates are the numbers above. Hope that helps some, Chris ---

        I actually figured this out last summer. Counting all mirrors and
        inverses I got 44 cases. It doesn't seem like a lot but there really
        aren't many edge permutations for each corner orientation. For all
        corners oriented (Fridrich PLL): 2 edge cycles 1 zig-zag 1 cross 1 lucky
        case For 2 opposite corners twisted: 4 cases where 2 adjacent edges need
        to be exchanged 1 case where 2 oppostie egdes need to be exchanged (this
        also fixes zig-zag, but you need to do an extra U after the sequence) 1
        case with no edge permutation For 2 adjacent corners twisted (x2 for 2
        different cases) 4 cases where 2 adjacent edges need to be exchanged 1
        case where 2 oppostie egdes need to be exchanged (this also fixes
        zig-zag, but you need to do an extra U after the sequence) 1 case with
        no edge permutation For 3 corners twisted (x2 for CW and CCW) 4 cases
        where 2 adjacent edges need to be exchanged 1 case where 2 oppostie
        egdes need to be exchanged (this also fixes zig-zag, but you need to do
        an extra U after the sequence) 1 case with no edge permutation For 4
        corners twisted (all 4 facing same direction) 2 cases where 2 adjacent
        edges need to be exchanged 1 case where 2 oppostie egdes need to be
        exchanged (this also fixes zig-zag, but you need to do an extra U after
        the sequence) 1 case with no edge permutation the first one is half b/c
        the corner orientation is symmetrical both ways, cancelling 2 of the
        cases. For 4 corners twisted (the other case) 4 cases where 2 adjacent
        edges need to be exchanged 1 case where 2 oppostie egdes need to be
        exchanged (this also fixes zig-zag, but you need to do an extra U after
        the sequence) 1 case with no edge permutation Adding this up gives a
        total of 44 cases (minus the lucky case). It turns out that these can
        all be solved using ONLY R, U, and L. So it's important to know right
        and left handed finger tricks to take advantage of this. The move
        average (based on the sequences I chose to use (Ron's solver found more
        than one solution in most cases)) is about 11.1 moves. Some of the
        sequences are same as the solutions to some OLL (Fridrich) cases that
        affect edge permutation, so you should try some of those out first to
        see if you can solve some cases without having to use Ron's solver. I
        don't have these 44 cases online but it shouldn't take that long to find
        the solutions. Allow Ron's cube solver to use only R, R', R2, L, L', L2,
        U, U', and U2. Andy http://andyscubepage.tk

        Hey Evan, Here's a really useful way to think of commutators for the
        4x4x4, and also for the 3x3x3. Here is a really useful 3-cycle for the
        3x3x3, megaminx, 4x4x4, etc. Let A=LDL' B=U Then ABA'B' becomes
        (LDL')U(LD'L')U' What this does is to cycle DFL-&gt;UFL-&gt;UFR The way
        to think about how this move works is like this: The main corner that
        you are focusing on is the corner at DFL. You are going to place this
        corner into the spot where it needs to go. In the cycle above we see
        that DFL goes to the UFL spot. So the first thing to do is put your main
        corner where you want it to go. Do LDL'. Now we have our 2nd corner in
        the cycle "in limbo" so to speak. If you do the inverse of your alg A
        you will put the 2nd corner piece into the UFL spot. However, you just
        placed your main corner there, so find your 3rd corner (here UFR) and
        move it over to the spot where you just finished placing a corner (UFL).
        Do U. Now you can place the 2nd corner into the 3rd corner's slot by
        undoing A, so do LD'L' Now you have to undo your slice turn B (do U'),
        and you have cycled the corners how you wanted. ------ Ok, so here is
        another example but on the 4x4x4. Lets say we want to construct a
        3-cycle of edge pieces. This particular 3-cycle will end up being a
        useful one that you can use later. You want to cycle uFL-&gt;bRU-&gt;rUF
        It turns out that this cycle is easy to make, using the same concept as
        for the corner 3 cycle above on the 3x3x3. Call the piece at uFL the
        "main" piece. Now call the piece at bRU "edge number 1", and call the
        piece at rUF "edge number 2" Notice that the cycle that we want moves
        the pieces (by name) as Main edge -&gt; edge number 1 -&gt; edge number
        2 Now put the pieces where they need to go by the names. So the main
        edge has to go to edge number 1's spot. The alg you use to do this will
        become your A in ABA'B' For this particular example doing R'u'R will do
        this, and it is now our A. Now your main edge is "in limbo" hanging out
        bRD. Notice though that doing A' (R'uR) will put it into the bUR spot.
        So now do a U' turn such that edge number 2 (right now in rUF) ends up
        in the bUR slot. The setup move you use to move piece #3 into piece #2's
        spot becomes the B in ABA'B' Now that edge number 3 is in bUR undo your
        alg A, so do R'uR Now you simply have to undo B by doing U and you're
        done. So the alg is R' u' R U' R' u R U ---------------- So to do this
        in general, do some setup moves to get 2 of the pieces in your 3-cycle
        onto the same slice. Then get one of the pieces in the cycle into a
        position not on that slice, but in such a way that it is easy to put
        into the slice. Now move your main piece (the piece not on the slice
        with the other 2) into the position of the piece #1 (really the 2nd
        location in the cycle). Now turn your slice with all the pieces on it
        such that piece #3 ends up where piece #2 just was. Now undo your alg A
        and then undo your alg B. Lastly undo your original setup turns. So,
        using the alg above that cycles edges, let's cycle 3 different edges. We
        want to cycle bUL-&gt;uBL-&gt;lUB Do the setup move LU2 and now your
        pieces are setup exactly like in the previous example, so do the same
        ABA'B' you did there, then undo the LU2. There is actually a faster way
        to do this cycle using a shorter setup move and a slightly different
        commutator 3-cycle. However, since you know how to form them now, I
        leave it up to you to figure it out :) Chris --- In

        well this should seem like a realativly simple question. Ive been cubing
        for a few months now and i cant solve the cube in about a minute and

        always solved it with the cross on top, made sense to me. Sees as if a

        The advantage lies in that with having the cross (and thereby most
        solved pieces) on the bottom, you can clearly see the top, where the
        most unsolved pieces are. This allows you to quickly move on to the next
        C/E pair after the previous one because you have been eyeing it all the
        time. It also allows you to move on to the LL quite quick because when

        It's easier to make the switch from top to bottom if you understand the

        Hi! On the matter of UuRr solving which seems to be HOT right now ...
        lol ... Here is a real short parity fix alg, due to Chris Hardwick : R2
        (uR2)*5 (edge 4-cycle, real edges not paired "3x3x3" edges) If u only
        want to swap 2 edges u can do the following modification/extension :
        ((Rr)(Uu)')*2 [U,R'u'R]((Uu)(Rr)')*2 (R2u)*5 R2 A bit longish but
        reasonably fast ... about 10-11 secs. Of coz this alg is useless for the
        pairing up/3x3x3-reduction strategy cause it will break paired-up edges.
        But i'm sure there are other modifications to chris' algorithm that can
        be used. I'm afraid the setuo moves will be a real killer though :-(
        Cheers!! -Per PS! Or use ACube to find an easier algorithm ...

        You sound just like me about a year ago. I also learned with the cross
        on top as it mentally does make more sense. Right now I'm kicking myself
        because I can clearly see the benefits of having it on the bottom. Not
        only are the cubies easier to see, but it seems that the modified
        algorithms you use when the cross is on on the bottom are also faster
        and easier to execute. I've been just recently trying to make the switch
        from top to bottom too and it's still causing me to turn the cube all
        over the place. It's not as 'natural' as I'd like because I got so used
        to the other way for so long. If you're serious about speedcubing, I
        would ditch the cross on top and move to the bottom as soon as you can.
        I found that having it on the left isn't too bad either. -Howard --- In

        turn the cube all over the place. The most difficult part is not keeping
        the cross on the bottom, but limiting the cube rotations to the left or
        right. In other words, placing C+E pairs at the back-left or back-right
        directly, and not turning the cube and doing it on the front instead.
        This also means that you have to use both hands equally - I tend to
        favour my right hand so too often I turn the cube to put the C+E pair in
        the R face. Jaap

        It's nice to know that other people struggle with the same bad habits!
        Someone should start a support group for speedcubers who are trying to

        not quite convinced that keeping the orientation of the cube the same
        all the time is a good idea. I've found that maybe almost 1/3 of the CE
        pairs I do are built when the edge is in the incorrect corner. (Start
        the alg on one side and finish on the other). Turning the cube around
        greatly increases the chance of spotting a pair quicker than relying on
        just the top layer. By turning the cube as you go, you can find pairs
        pretty easy. The last layer is always quicker when you tilt or turn the
        cube to run the alg faster. As long as you can spot the next pair, why
        would F2L be any different? I suppose the ideal would be to know how to
        run the same F2L algs from top, left, bottom, and all corners. Then it
        wouldn't matter where the cross is. -Howard --- In

        Hello Andy and all others, I hope you won't mind me adding some
        comments. It turns out that &gt; these can all be solved using ONLY R,
        U, and L. Actually they can be solved using ONLY R and U
        (two-generator), and I think it is much easier to do it that way. I
        myself use only two- gen algs with few exceptions. You might know this,
        but the two-generator conservs the corners' permutation so that all
        algorithms using R and U can be used or the purpose of orientating
        corners and permuting edges. If some of you don't believe it, or don't
        know why it is so, check my demonstration on my website
        http://www.geocities.com/portoseb/cube/demonstration.html I think that
        this demonstration is the only one existing except for the
        computer-generated ones that analysed all possible positions. They
        should start giving cube problems in math contests ;) Little more about
        these algs. Knowing the shortest 2-gen alg - the Sune (7 moves) - one
        can generate algs consisting of two Sunes, done one after the other in
        different positions of course. You can use the AntiSune too, getting
        very many positions that can be solved in a reasonable 14 moves. So
        actually you don't need to learn so many algs (only if you're striving
        for optimality). I think that all these algorithms are listed on Lars
        Petrus' page http://lar5.com/cube/xMain.html There are almost optimal
        ones too. The truly optimized ones are on Bernard Helmstetter's page

        I turn the cube very little (at least less than before :P), yet I still
        manage to spot my pairs. Part of this is that I don't need to actually
        see an edge to know it's there. I can deduce it by knowing that it's not
        anywhere else. It sounds complicated but is actually quite viable. You
        don't have to actually see everything everytime to know everything. And
        another thing is that if you have the choice between turning the cube
        and turning a layer, turning a layer is definintely the fastest. This
        because in turning the cube you have to completely reconfigure your
        grip, whereas in turning a layer part of the cube remains static
        relative to yourself, so you can keep your grip there. A cube rotation
        can actually be done by turning the two bottom layers as well, a fact
        that is invaluable in F2L. The net result compared to actually turning
        the entire cube is that the top layer is off a bit, but this fact is
        almost irrelevant. Most likely you're going to have to turn the top
        layer anyway. So yes, turning the cube around lets you spot more, but is
        a lot slower when compared to this alternative, which allows for pretty
        much the same thing. If you are really keen on turning the cube though,
        I suggest you go with cross on the left, because that setup is actually
        quite friendly towards cube turning. When turning the cube with cross on
        the bottom you are turning around an axis that your hands don't handle
        very well, whereas turning around the "horizontal" axis is rather easy.

        3x3x3 2-generator I solve the edges and corners like a 3x3x3 2-gen. Then
        I use commutators with setup moves to get all the centers to their
        correct spots. Not a fast or efficient solution probably, but a solution
        :) Now I'd like to work on optimizing this. Heh heh you guys were right,

        Yeah, as mentioned before, I started with lots of commutators, too, and
        needed 36 minutes. How long did you need? C'mon, can't be worse than my
        time ;-) The parity problems aren't really that bad, the "permutation
        parity" is handled just like normal 4x4 and the "orientation parity"
        isn't that bad either, at least not when you know [R2u]*5, which leaves
        very little to fix. Btw, congrats for your new 4x4 record! I need to

        Hi. I read somewhere in this forum a while back that electrical tape is
        really good for stickers. I am having a problem with them. My stickers
        are worn out after 3 weeks use and I went out and bought 5 colors of
        electrical tape (couldn't find orange). I cut out a few white squares
        using an x-acto knife. Most of the squares were odd shaped, even though
        i used a straight edge and measured out the length and width of the
        squares. When i stuck a sticker onto my cube, it looked really funky. It
        wasn't what i was expecting. It didn't look professional. Is this
        because it was my first time or do i juss suck at cutting or is this
        what is supposed to happen. Also, i got a lot of air bubbles under my
        stickers. I tried removing them using the dull side of my x-acto knife.
        It wouldn't go away. You cant notice the air bubbles if you're in a
        slightly dark room, but who cubes in a slightly dark room? Can someone
        help me with that. Oh and also, what brand of electrical tape do you
        guys use? Thx. -Jim

        When was the last time you were hoping to get the parity error? I mean
        the "pair orientation" one. For me, it was a few minutes ago. I did an
        average and the first 11 solves *all* had that error. But (partly thanks
        to my new alg) I was still able to get good times somehow. But that damn
        last solve didn't have the error. Damn, that would've been so cool!!!
        But I missed my average record by 0.38 seconds anyway... Cheers! Stefan

        Hey Jim, I found orange after awhile but it took awhile. Yeah, cutting
        just takes skill. I think I used to use 3M electrical tape or whatever.
        Doug Li cuts his own stickers by hand and they're quite beautiful. I at
        first didn't believe that they were hand cut. Adam Zamora has a vinyl
        sticker cutting machine and sells stickers at cheap prices if you're
        interested. He can produce any puzzle... Megaminx, Pyraminx, Square-1,

        I use electrical tape for restickering. Here's a pic of the last cube I
        restickered: http://tinyurl.com/5y4p9 I didn't have problems with
        bubbles under the stickers. Maybe I was using a thicker tape? (BTW, the
        URL above also has a pic of the tape label so you can see the brand).
        One problem I have discovered is that the re-stickered cube doesn't stay
        as nice and clean looking after months of being jostled around in my
        bag. :/ However, the electrical tape stickers do last significantly
        longer than regular stickers so I think it's worth it. I wouldn't worry
        too much if the electrical tape stickers aren't perfectly lined up and
        identical. I didn't really measure mine and I just used a pair of
        regular scissors. I think my stickers look okay (unless you look really
        closely) -- but maybe your sticker standards are higher than mine!

        http://www.geocities.com/portoseb/cube/demonstration.html &gt; I think
        that this demonstration is the only one existing except for &gt; the
        computer-generated ones that analysed all possible positions. You have
        shown that you can't swap two corners, but it is actually much more
        restrictive. You cannot do any 3-cycles either. If you could, then a
        conjugation of it would give you a 3-cycle in one face. Combined with a
        turn of that face you would get a swap, which you have shown is
        impossible. I have done something very similar once, but I've never put
        it up on my site. There is a proof in Singmaster's Notes on Rubik's
        Magic Cube (5th ed.), which essentially boils down to much the same
        thing if I'm not mistaken. He labelled the positions (not the pieces)
        a-f. The five possible pairing arrangements are then: {ab,cd,ef}
        {ac,de,bf} {bd,af,ce} {ad,be,cf} {bc,ae,df} The moves U and R permute
        these five arrangements. He then shows any two different achievable
        corner permutations gives a different permutation of these five sets, so
        there can be at most 5! corner permutations. Therefore there are have 5!
        corner perms instead of the 6! you would normally expect with 6 corners,
        i.e. a factor 6 less. It is easy to solve 3 corners in one face, and the
        other three will then automatically be solved. Instead of the 3!=6
        arrangements that the 3 remaining corners normally could have, only the
        solved arrangement is possible. Jaap

        Hey! Still working on the method, the steps. I will definitely NOT pair
        up edges ... lol ... that's against my nature ;-) One possible way is
        like this : 1) All the corners (easy) 2) All centers (fairly easy) 3)
        All edges except edges in u layer (a little hard i guess) 4) Check for
        parity (fix the parity, easy) 5) Last 3 edges in u layer (fairly easy)
        But im still working on it. Step 1) and 2) can be easily swapped.

        Good thoughts and good advice. I guess I kinda do feel myself slowing

        Part of this is that I don't need to &gt; actually see an edge to know
        it's there. I can deduce it by knowing &gt; that it's not anywhere else.
        It sounds complicated but is actually &gt; quite viable. You don't have
        to actually see everything everytime to &gt; know everything. And
        another thing is that if you have the choice &gt; between turning the
        cube and turning a layer, turning a layer is &gt; definintely the
        fastest. This because in turning the cube you have to &gt; completely
        reconfigure your grip, whereas in turning a layer part of &gt; the cube
        remains static relative to yourself, so you can keep your &gt; grip
        there. A cube rotation can actually be done by turning the two &gt;
        bottom layers as well, a fact that is invaluable in F2L. The net &gt;
        result compared to actually turning the entire cube is that the top &gt;
        layer is off a bit, but this fact is almost irrelevant. Most likely &gt;
        you're going to have to turn the top layer anyway. So yes, turning the
        &gt; cube around lets you spot more, but is a lot slower when compared
        to &gt; this alternative, which allows for pretty much the same thing.
        If you &gt; are really keen on turning the cube though, I suggest you go
        with &gt; cross on the left, because that setup is actually quite
        friendly &gt; towards cube turning. When turning the cube with cross on
        the bottom &gt; you are turning around an axis that your hands don't
        handle very well, &gt; whereas turning around the "horizontal" axis is
        rather easy. &gt; &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        keeping the orientation of the cube the same all the time is a good &gt;
        &gt; idea. I've found that maybe almost 1/3 of the CE pairs I do are
        &gt; &gt; built when the edge is in the incorrect corner. (Start the alg
        on &gt; &gt; one side and finish on the other). Turning the cube around
        greatly &gt; &gt; increases the chance of spotting a pair quicker than
        relying on just &gt; &gt; the top layer. By turning the cube as you go,
        you can find pairs &gt; &gt; pretty easy. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The last
        layer is always quicker when you tilt or turn the cube to &gt; &gt; run
        the alg faster. As long as you can spot the next pair, why would &gt;
        &gt; F2L be any different? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suppose the ideal would
        be to know how to run the same F2L algs &gt; &gt; from top, left,
        bottom, and all corners. Then it wouldn't matter &gt; &gt; where the

        &gt; &gt; You sound just like me about a year ago. I also learned with
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cross on top as it mentally does make more
        sense. Right now I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kicking myself because I can
        clearly see the benefits of having it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the bottom.
        Not only are the cubies easier to see, but it &gt; &gt; seems &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; that the modified algorithms you use when the cross is on on
        the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bottom are also faster and easier to execute.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've been through the same experience
        about three years ago. I &gt; &gt; think &gt; &gt; &gt; it is faster to
        turn the U face than the D face because it allows &gt; &gt; for &gt;
        &gt; &gt; easier fingertricks. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I must
        confess though that I sometimes still struggle to build the &gt; &gt;
        &gt; cross on the bottom. I have a tendency to fall into old habits and
        &gt; &gt; &gt; build the cross on top and then turn the cube over for
        the rest of &gt; &gt; &gt; the F2L. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; bottom &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too and it's still causing me to
        turn the cube all over the &gt; &gt; place. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; The most difficult part is not keeping the cross on the bottom, but
        &gt; &gt; &gt; limiting the cube rotations to the left or right. In
        other words, &gt; &gt; &gt; placing C+E pairs at the back-left or
        back-right directly, and not &gt; &gt; &gt; turning the cube and doing
        it on the front instead. This also means &gt; &gt; &gt; that you have to
        use both hands equally - I tend to favour my right &gt; &gt; &gt; hand
        so too often I turn the cube to put the C+E pair in the R face. &gt;

        Hey Stefan!! Technically u haven't mirrored ur original algorithm. If u
        wanna mirror u have the following replacement scheme : U-&gt;R' R-&gt;U'
        What u have done is the following: U-&gt;R R-&gt;U That scheme is a
        rotational symmetry, not mirroring ;-) And when looking at ur original
        algorithm it can be extended to a pure "dedge swap" like this: (Uu)' R U
        R [(Uu)' R2] * 3 (Uu)2 R U' R' (Uu)2 R' U' R (Uu)' + U R' (U' R') * 2 U2
        (R U) * 2 R' This will "swap" the UR "dedge", while also cycling the 6
        corners. Looking at the cyclic structure of these corners we have a
        6-cycle which is ODD. So actually the algorithm fixes both parities and
        is not really a pure flip-parity fix ;-) But this is not really a
        problem if the alg is done early enough before the other parity has
        already been fixed :-) Those who however can see that we don't have the
        other parity as well might want to use another parity fix... Cheers!

        I like to think of solving the pieces for a step based on how much
        "information" you have to fix for that step. For the 2x2x4 you have 2
        corners, each has 3 orientations and the "information" about it's
        position. So that's 8 for both corners together. Then each of the 6
        edges only has 1 piece of information, their positions. Lastly the
        centers sort of have 3/4 of a piece of information since all the ones of
        the same color are indistinct, and normally they would only have their
        positions. So solving a 2x2x4 would have a rating of 18.5 Doing all the
        centers first on a cube (with all 24 having a 3/4 rating, to mean that
        they only have their position, but it's not very exact since they're
        indisticnt) has a rating of 18. Again this rating is only an estimation
        I use to figure out how hard a step would be based on the number and
        type of pieces, but based on that I think doing a 2x2x4, then solving
        the rest of the cube as a 4- gen would be a very fast method if you get
        get your 4-gen times down. As a comparison, all the centers with a
        rating of 18 takes me 15-17 seconds on average probably. So if you could
        do the 2x2x4 in 16-18 (based on the slightly higher rating) and add that
        to your 4-gen times you a very rough idea of your average after lots and
        lots and lots of practice with your method. Again this is just a very,
        very rough way I prefer to estimate how long a step will take. My
        conclusion is that I really want to start learning to solve a 2x2x4
        really quickly, and also work on my 4-gen times :) Chris --- In

        The 3x3 2gen part is one of them, I could at least save 5 seconds on
        average. And some algs I use could be optimized (i. e. replaced by
        better ones) and the ones that are good, I need to practice them more.
        And pairing up edges is bad because I look very long for opportunities

        should turn them into good cases. &gt; As a comparison, all the centers

        Ok, I've been working on my method a lot, and so far my pb is down to

        do centers first, then group together edges, potentially having to fix
        the parity error. Then I flip the edges that are impossible in 3x3x3
        2-gen, then I solve as a two gen, potentially having to fix the

        go quickly, as I can for the most part use my normal 4x4 edge pairing
        technique. I've been trying also to correctly permute that pieces such
        that the edge groups always end up flipped correctly for the 3x3 2-gen,
        but that takes a lot of commutators to do. I seem to be averaging around
        3-5 minutes right now, and have no idea how to get down to near 1:00
        lol. I'll keep working at it, but I'm curious how you guys are doing
        this. If you guys can get the 4-gen times down to 50-55 seconds on
        average or less, then a 4-gen approach will beat the limits of the

        Hi Chris! So u are looking for easy way to flip 2 edges for UuRr cubing.
        Here is quite an easy way to do exactly that : [R'u R2 u2 R2 u' R, U] ,
        flips UR and UB or [R'u R2 u2 R2 u' R, U2] , flips UR and UL With

        Hey Per, notice that Chris doesn't need a pure version ;-) Mine throws
        pieces around, but can be done in 2 seconds or less I think: (Rr)' U-2
        (Rr) flips the first pair U R' U' replaces it with the second pair (Rr)'
        U-2 (Rr) flips the second pair The U-2 means turn it counterclockwise, I
        prefer index finger for first quarter and middle finger for second
        quarter. In the replacement step instead of R' you can use R or R2 if
        you want. And you can mirror it several ways. But I only use the one
        above. And btw, I noticed that the pieces being thrown around is a good
        thing! Because almost always the next two pairs to be flipped end up in
        the almost correct positions for it. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Hey Stefan, Per, Thanks for the flip algs, I'll have to start using
        those and see if it helps my strategy any. Thanks about the regular 4x4
        record, I've been working on chaning my centers step a little after
        talking to Frank Morris. I used to always solve the centers in the same
        order to minimize on thinking time, but unfortunately if those centers
        are poorly setup it takes longer. Now I just solve the best setup
        centers at each step. It takes some getting used to, but it works pretty

        the 3 remaining corners normally could have, only the solved &gt;
        arrangement is possible. This was the main idea of my demonstration too.
        But I just labeled the pairs and watched how they moved around with R
        and U moves. There was a very small number of possible positions, and a
        swap would have meant that a forbidden arrangement would be possible. So
        it is not possible to do a swap. I used swaps rather than 3-cycles
        because it's much easier to see them, and I use that in speedcubing.

        same order to minimize on thinking &gt; time, but unfortunately if those
        centers are poorly setup it takes &gt; longer. Now I just solve the best

        that now? I think I average maybe 18-19 always starting with white.

        Dear lkyawkyaw, ok dude, hehehe, yo da man, ok, peace hehehe :MATWBE)
        Most people do it quite similarly, solving centers first, then pair up
        edges (but all of them), then solve as a 3x3, fixing the "3x3 parity"
        problems at the appropriate points. I don't see how your algorithm
        solves the last three pieces. It does pair up the edges, but it even
        seems to destroy most of the F2L. I'd suggest this instead: (Rr) U R' U'
        (Rr)' That's very fast and pairs up all those edges. And if you follow
        it with this, the F2L is restored again: F R F' For your other problem,
        try this: (Llr')' U (rU2)*4 r U' [DL2D',r'] (Llr') Actually the last two
        moves cancel each other out a bit, so overall that's 20 moves. There are
        probably shorter solutions, but this is intuitive and thus might fit
        into your method. Cheers! Stefan --- In

        Hey, Unfortunately your strategy for the last F3L edge isn't enough to
        avoid the parity error. You run into that longer parity because you
        solve the centers first. If you solve the centers, and the edges are in
        an odd permutation after doing the last move for the centers, then you
        will run into the parity. Actually, with your method of doing the F3L,
        then solving the last edges later on, here is a much easier to remember
        algorithm for fixing the parity when you run into it. If you solve the
        F3L normally, then start solving the LL edges and find that you have run
        into the parity error then do: F2 B2 U r U2 r U2 r U2 r U2 r U' B2 F2
        The easy way to remember this is [F2 B2 U] [(r U2)x4] [r] [U' B2 F2]
        This will scramble your last layer edges a little bit, but such that
        when you try to solve them again, you won't run into the parity. In the
        long run it is more moves to do, but easier to remember. To avoid the
        pairity 100% the time you have to determine the cycles of the edges,
        meaning whether or not they are in an odd permutation or not. To do this
        you either have to figure out the cycles explicitly, or solve some of
        the pieces, then figure out the cycles of the remaining unsolved pieces.
        Lately I've been working on figuring out the cycles not into the solved
        state for the edges, but into any position that I know is an even
        permutation of the edges. This makes them easier to count, and can be
        done much quicker than either of the methods above. I'm still practicing
        it, but I'll post my strategies about it if it continues to be fruitful.
        So in short, if you want to continue to solve the centers first for your
        4x4 solution then you have to learn an algorithm to fix it, or count the
        cycles before you start your solve such that you can solve the centers
        and place the edges into an even permutation at the same time. If it's
        any consolation, the probability of running into that particular parity
        error is exactly 50%, so half the time you don't have to worry about it.

        I cut out a full side (~5x5 cm) and put it on the cube. Then you can cut
        out all the stickers by just 8 to 12 cuts, depending on how precisely
        you cut the first block. It makes them align up nicely too. I use as
        sharp a knife as I can find. That is often the sharp end of scissors.

        Hey Stefan, I hadn't actually timed each step for the 4x4 in a long time
        so I did a few solves just now and here are the numbers I got for each
        step. The numbers are how long it took me to do the centers, edges, and
        as a 3x3x3. 17.42 22.91 39.40 = 79.73 17.86 23.63 27.44 = 68.93 16.86
        23.29 29.09 = 69.24 19.09 29.85 32.56 = 81.50 14.14 24.38 27.00 = 65.52
        Which is 17.07 for the centers, 24.81 for the edges, and 31.10 for the
        3x3x3. I guess I still need to work on the centers some to get to 16
        seconds. I think what's saving my times is the edges step, my times
        haven't changed all that much from when I was at 1:20, except that my
        edges step got faster. Chris --- In

        &gt; Hmm, that sounds interesting. Gotta think about it. Tomorrow. &gt;
        Stefan Hey again Stefan :) Here are some numbers I ran for the
        probabilities of certain types of positions. The program I was using
        didn't have a big integer calculator, or if it does I don't know how to
        use it. So anyway if you want the equations I used to get the exact
        numbers just let me know. I basically just used the number of
        derangements of the pieces given a certain number of them solved. Of all
        the 24! positions the edges can be in, 36.79% are 24-derangements, so
        none in the correct spot. 36.79% are 23-derangements, with exactly one
        piece in the correct spot 18.39% are 22-derangements (2 solved) 6.13%
        are 21-derangements (3 solved) 1.53% are 20-derangements (4 solved)
        0.31% are 19-derangements (5 solved) 0.05% are 18-derangments (6 solved)
        and the values get really small after that. To make sure that the
        numbers I got were right I added up all the derangement cases, and I got
        24!, so they do indeed work out. The reason these numbers are important,
        is that if you count the cycles of the 4x4 edges directly you want the
        longest cycles possible, so you don't have to remember which pieces are
        left not in a cycle yet. You also want more pieces to be solved, since
        that means less time spent counting cycles. What I am trying now is to
        count the cycles into a solvable 3x3 position. So I let the pieces go
        into easier to find locations, but I make sure that the cycle I count
        puts the pieces into a solvable 3x3. This does two things, it lets way
        more pieces end up as "solved" so I can skip them and keep counting
        pieces. Also you don't have to consider the orientation of the piece
        after moving it, since you fix the spot you want to place the piece
        into, i.e. the spot is not determined by the piece as exactly as if you
        count the cycles to their correct locations. So far I've been able to
        determine the edge parity successfully almost every time in about a
        minute and a half on average. I can occasionlly get it in 30-40 seconds,
        but only if it is a single long cycle, with lots of "solved" pieces
        along the way. That's why I wanted to start working out the
        probabilities of the different types of cycles, to see how often these
        easier cases come up. I have a question for all you math people. If I
        have a derangement of the 24 edge pieces, how do I know what fraction of
        that number are pure 24 cycles? Also how do I know what fraction are 22
        cycles, with a transposition? My question is, given a derangment how do
        I determine the quality of the cycles in that derangment, and the number
        of each type? I was thinking about approaching this by saying that 22 of
        the pieces are solved, so clearly there are 276 possible transpositions
        of (2-cycles) of the edges. Then, given that 3 are incorrectly placed
        pieces there are 4048 possible 3-cycles. However, it seems like this
        approach will be very calculation intensive when I get up to a pure
        24-derangement. Also will these numbers have anything to do with the
        Catalan numbers? Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hey! Once again, i don't see the point in trying to eliminate the "flip

        Hi Chris, thanks for those times. I did the same and this is the result:

        19.65 45.15 42.59 That's 18.88 on average for centers and I'm too

        the not so good light for those (I don't think it had a big effect on
        the centers). I guess solving centers is the only step I do not need to
        work on... and I think with better general handling of the cube, I might
        beat you there. But then again, 5 attempts is not really enough to draw

        Thanks about the regular 4x4 record, I've been working on &gt; chaning
        my &gt; &gt; &gt; centers step a little after talking to Frank Morris. I
        used to &gt; &gt; &gt; always solve the centers in the same order to
        minimize on &gt; thinking &gt; &gt; &gt; time, but unfortunately if
        those centers are poorly setup it &gt; takes &gt; &gt; &gt; longer. Now
        I just solve the best setup centers at each step. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Hmm... was that 15-17 seconds average for centers before or after &gt;
        you &gt; &gt; switched to this? I.e. are you faster than that now? I
        think I &gt; average &gt; &gt; maybe 18-19 always starting with white.

        Hey Per, Stefan, I just took some practice trials of my cycles counting
        practice. The first time in each row is how long it took me to count the
        cycles, and the second is how long it took me to solve the cube having
        avoided the parity error. 48.19 1:15.23 39.73 1:05.69 (37.95 1:15.87)
        1:12.04 1:22.46 1:01.12 1:13.9 47 1:35.71 52.51 1:17.24 1:08.68 1:19.45
        (1:34.62 1:25.78) 51.03 1:20.82 58.85 1:24.76 59.61 1:25.12 which is
        55.88 seconds on average to determine the parity of the edges when taken
        as a usual 10 average. I should mention that this isn't a true average,
        I screwed up on 3 of the solves, so I really did 15 trials and took the
        12 successful ones. I'm just trying to get a rough idea of how long this
        is taking me. To make a mth observation, getting the parity error 3
        times or less in 15 trials has only a 1.76% chance of occuring, so I
        think we can say that it is very likely that my screw-ups were actually
        screwups and not that my process still makes it random chance that I see
        the parity error. Also, the last 6 solves were all consectuive with no
        screw-ups which only has 1/64 chance of occuring if my process was just
        random chance. Once I practice more I'll try to do a 12 average with no
        screwups, which only has a 0.02% chance of occuring if you leave the
        parity error to chance. Here are a few observations to what you guys
        have said in past messages, just to answer your questions. Keeping track
        of the parity of the edges while solving the centers doesn't take all
        that much more time or effort. I use my feet to keep track of the turns.
        Every time I do a single quarter turn I switch the foot that I am
        pressing to the ground. So if I am pressing my right foot down, the
        parity is even, my left means the parity is odd. I don't do this for
        every turn, since a lot of the moves are really just conjugates (some
        quarter turn / some face turn / the inverse of the first quarter turn)
        so you don't have to do this for every move. Also, Per to answer your
        question, I'm trying to see if counting cycles will be worthwhile. If
        people are learning hundreds of algorithms for the 3x3x3 to drop a
        couple seconds of their average, I don't think it's any stranger for me
        to practice and see if this 4x4 technique will drop a few seconds off my
        average. I'm doing it for the same reason that people are learning ZB
        for the 3x3x3, to see if it will help lower my times some more. Also,
        the reason I only focus on the flip parity is that it is much easier to
        determine given the centers-first style of solving. In order to keep my
        edges step fast, I have to be able to solve the first edge I see, rather
        than a particular one to help determine the position parity. So trying
        to identify this parity takes thought and skill while the timer is
        timing my solve. If I practice counting the cycles long enough and can
        actually use it, then I can determine the flip parity within the 15
        second inspection, without ever having been under the timer. Chris ---

        worried about using it in speedcubing, too. But for a &gt; slightly
        different reason. I don't think it's the time you spend to &gt; learn it
        that could be used to improve the other steps, but it's that &gt; it'll
        probably slow us down while solving the centers cause we need to &gt;
        count (mod 2). And if we just make one mistake, we're doomed cause &gt;
        then we will accidentally try to get the error instead of avoid it. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; PS! Looking at the cyclic structure of the 24 basic edges it
        should &gt; &gt; be possible to eliminate the "swap dedge" parity as
        well as the &gt; "flip &gt; &gt; dedge" parity. Why are u discussing
        almost solely the latter parity? &gt; &gt; Hehe ... ;-) Is it more evil
        than the first one? :-P &gt; &gt; Actually I think the "swap" one is
        more evil. That's because the &gt; "flip" is obvious to see when I
        arrive at it. The "swap" is still &gt; quite often killing me, making me
        wonder what PLL I'm at and whether &gt; it has the error. &gt; &gt;

        practice and see if this &gt; 4x4 technique will drop a few seconds off
        my average. I'm doing it &gt; for the same reason that people are
        learning ZB for the 3x3x3, to &gt; see if it will help lower my times
        some more. &gt; &gt; Also, the reason I only focus on the flip parity is
        that it is much &gt; easier to determine given the centers-first style
        of solving. In &gt; order to keep my edges step fast, I have to be able
        to solve the &gt; first edge I see, rather than a particular one to help
        determine the &gt; position parity. So trying to identify this parity
        takes thought &gt; and skill while the timer is timing my solve. If I
        practice &gt; counting the cycles long enough and can actually use it,
        then I can &gt; determine the flip parity within the 15 second
        inspection, without &gt; ever having been under the timer. &gt; &gt;

        on &gt; improving &gt; &gt; &gt; all the basic steps IMHO. Maybe u guys
        look into it more for fun &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; out of theoretical
        interest. That's fair enough ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is surely
        interesting :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though I'm worried about using it in
        speedcubing, too. But for a &gt; &gt; slightly different reason. I don't
        think it's the time you spend &gt; to &gt; &gt; learn it that could be
        used to improve the other steps, but it's &gt; that &gt; &gt; it'll
        probably slow us down while solving the centers cause we &gt; need to
        &gt; &gt; count (mod 2). And if we just make one mistake, we're doomed
        cause &gt; &gt; then we will accidentally try to get the error instead
        of avoid it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS! Looking at the cyclic
        structure of the 24 basic edges it &gt; should &gt; &gt; &gt; be
        possible to eliminate the "swap dedge" parity as well as the &gt; &gt;
        "flip &gt; &gt; &gt; dedge" parity. Why are u discussing almost solely
        the latter &gt; parity? &gt; &gt; &gt; Hehe ... ;-) Is it more evil than
        the first one? :-P &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually I think the "swap" one
        is more evil. That's because the &gt; &gt; "flip" is obvious to see when
        I arrive at it. The "swap" is still &gt; &gt; quite often killing me,
        making me wonder what PLL I'm at and &gt; whether &gt; &gt; it has the
        error. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; Stefan

        Hello, it is a pleasure for me to announce the availability of our "Book
        of Alternative Records". This is a new book about unusual, funny,
        creative world records, and I am sure that it has the most complete list
        of speedcubing records published in a book so far. The records in the
        book are based on my Internet page
        http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/rubik.html and include the results
        of the US and European championship 2004 as the last events before the
        deadline. To get an impression of the book and the other records, please
        visit http://www.alternativerecords.co.uk (from where you can also order
        your copy.) We hope to publish a second edition next year. For this
        reason, submissions of new record claims are always welcome (see
        http://www.alternativerecords.co.uk/worldrecordbreaker.asp for details).

        Hi Chris, Stefan, If you left 4 centers in a line (like U F D B centers)
        unsolved, and also left the four edge pairs in that line plus the UR and
        UL edge pairs, then you could quickly count to see if the parity was
        present. If it was present you add a half turn - r, r', l, or l', then
        solve the remaining centers and edges with an even number of quarter
        turns. Regards, David J --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; which is 55.88 seconds on average to determine the parity of the
        &gt; edges when taken as a usual 10 average. I should mention that this
        &gt; isn't a true average, I screwed up on 3 of the solves, so I really
        &gt; did 15 trials and took the 12 successful ones. I'm just trying to
        &gt; get a rough idea of how long this is taking me. &gt; &gt; To make a
        mth observation, getting the parity error 3 times or less &gt; in 15
        trials has only a 1.76% chance of occuring, so I think we can &gt; say
        that it is very likely that my screw-ups were actually screwups &gt; and
        not that my process still makes it random chance that I see the &gt;
        parity error. Also, the last 6 solves were all consectuive with no &gt;
        screw-ups which only has 1/64 chance of occuring if my process was &gt;
        just random chance. Once I practice more I'll try to do a 12 &gt;
        average with no screwups, which only has a 0.02% chance of occuring &gt;
        if you leave the parity error to chance. &gt; &gt; Here are a few
        observations to what you guys have said in past &gt; messages, just to
        answer your questions. &gt; &gt; Keeping track of the parity of the
        edges while solving the centers &gt; doesn't take all that much more
        time or effort. I use my feet to &gt; keep track of the turns. Every
        time I do a single quarter turn I &gt; switch the foot that I am
        pressing to the ground. So if I am &gt; pressing my right foot down, the
        parity is even, my left means the &gt; parity is odd. I don't do this
        for every turn, since a lot of the &gt; moves are really just conjugates
        (some quarter turn / some face &gt; turn / the inverse of the first
        quarter turn) so you don't have to &gt; do this for every move. &gt;
        &gt; Also, Per to answer your question, I'm trying to see if counting
        &gt; cycles will be worthwhile. If people are learning hundreds of &gt;

        that it is much &gt; &gt; easier to determine given the centers-first
        style of solving. In &gt; &gt; order to keep my edges step fast, I have
        to be able to solve the &gt; &gt; first edge I see, rather than a
        particular one to help determine the &gt; &gt; position parity. So
        trying to identify this parity takes thought &gt; &gt; and skill while
        the timer is timing my solve. If I practice &gt; &gt; counting the
        cycles long enough and can actually use it, then I can &gt; &gt;
        determine the flip parity within the 15 second inspection, without &gt;
        &gt; ever having been under the timer. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt;

        easy to learn and are pretty fast. Ur overall &gt; &gt; speed &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; depends very little on this issue. Time is better spent on
        &gt; &gt; improving &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all the basic steps IMHO. Maybe
        u guys look into it more for fun &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out
        of theoretical interest. That's fair enough ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; It is surely interesting :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though
        I'm worried about using it in speedcubing, too. But for a &gt; &gt; &gt;
        slightly different reason. I don't think it's the time you spend &gt;
        &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; learn it that could be used to improve the other
        steps, but it's &gt; &gt; that &gt; &gt; &gt; it'll probably slow us
        down while solving the centers cause we &gt; &gt; need to &gt; &gt; &gt;
        count (mod 2). And if we just make one mistake, we're doomed cause &gt;
        &gt; &gt; then we will accidentally try to get the error instead of
        avoid it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS! Looking at the cyclic
        structure of the 24 basic edges it &gt; &gt; should &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        be possible to eliminate the "swap dedge" parity as well as the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; "flip &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedge" parity. Why are u discussing
        almost solely the latter &gt; &gt; parity? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hehe ...
        ;-) Is it more evil than the first one? :-P &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Actually I think the "swap" one is more evil. That's because the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; "flip" is obvious to see when I arrive at it. The "swap"
        is still &gt; &gt; &gt; quite often killing me, making me wonder what
        PLL I'm at and &gt; &gt; whether &gt; &gt; &gt; it has the error. &gt;

        Hi Stefan, If you rather not, that's fine, since there's no technical
        reason to leave them unsolved before checking for parity. I just find it
        easier to solve the remaining edges and centers if I can freely move the
        "Up" side. I don't know - it may well be better to have those two edge
        pairs solved first. Come to think of it, a study of that whole r l slice
        pair might be rather rewarding... Good question, thanks. Regards, David

        You know Jasmine, you are probably right. My girlfriend Lisa can now
        solve a cube, also her sister and her sisters friend, but none of them
        would ever want to go in a competition. And they haven't thus far shown
        any of the obsessive tendencies that I have had when learning/improving
        with the cube. Lisa's fastest time is 48.98 seconds, but she doesn't
        feel any desire to improve :-( I really think it is a predominantly male
        trait, not really anything to do with whether one sex is better at
        cubing, just one sex wants to be better at cubing :-) Dan :-) _____

        I'd say that what you've described is definitely the more usual
        situation. It's completely opposite with me. I'm the one who's obsessed
        by cubing, whereas my brother thinks it's all pretty geeky and isn't all
        that interested. He can solve it, but not very fast (a couple of
        minutes). Interestingly, my brother is actually in the typical
        speedcuber demographic - twenty-something year old male engineer. It's
        kinda cool to be a bit different! :) Jasmine

        Hi Jasmine, I'm sure the group has talked about this before. The same
        phenomenon happens to a huge degree in chess that they actually award
        WGM titles which are separate from the grand master title. Maybe the
        cubing community should start some female cubing recruitment programs?
        Make it each and every cuber's mission to introduce one female to cubing
        each week. Haha! I can't believe I just said that. Tyson Mao MSC #631

        different from the minority pursuit of speedsolving, which requires an
        enormous amount of self motivation (and who knows what other, less
        admirable character traits). My eldest daughter (10) regularly solves
        her cube... and the only other person she knows of a similar age who can
        solve the cube is also a girl. That's a tiny sample, but let's not lose

        You could try to write out (DUMBER)*3 without inner slice turns and then
        repeat that. I just did (DUMBER)*3 by hand and found: - flipped cycle
        with 7 edges (factor 2*7) - flipped cycle with 2 edges (2*2) - flipped
        cycle with 2 edges (2*2) - flipped cycle with 1 edge (2*1) - correct
        cycle with 4 corners (1*4) - correct cycle with 2 corners (1*2) - 2
        solved corners (1) That means it will repeat after LCM( 2*7, 2*2, 2*2,
        2*1, 1*4, 1*2 ) = 28 repetitions, which means (DUMBER)*84 is the
        identity. Now go prove no smaller factor results in identity, too :-)

        Hi Richard, This is a different case. I'm after percentages following
        each prime. So the - 1/6, which is an adjustment from two and three's
        overlap, comes before 1/5. If you look at it one prime at a time, it can
        produce several things from which information may be gleaned. I
        mentioned a line which may predict a continuation into areas uncharted,
        but there are other ways of looking at it. For example, I thought that
        maybe at any prime point one could dip into the percentage left that
        contained primes undiscovered and make a prediction: So here each step
        concerns a prime number. After the first step each additional steps is
        added (with adjustment) to the prior steps. If the steps are a, and the
        cumulative results (density of non primes) are b, density of possible

        prime Is that accurate enough for you? It took time to step through each
        portion, so I didn't check to see how far each prediction could go, and
        the complexity grows with every step, so I'm not quite sure of the full
        process. I haven't tried yet to make single equation out of it. I don't
        know how useful all this can be, since so many primes are already known,
        there's no way I can do this longhand...that is, having no access to a
        supercomputer, I can't tell how useful it might be, ultimately. I would
        enjoy seeing this tried. Know anyone interested? &gt; (By the way, at
        this point it might be as well to add that the recurring number
        0.9999.... does equal 1, in respect of the end of your post, as can be
        seen by the definition of 0.999... which is the sum of an absolutely
        convergent series). Like, for example, looking at 0.8888... being one
        side of a zipper and 0.1111... being the other side. &gt; Zeno's paradox
        is only a paradox because at the time of Zeno, limits were not
        well-defined. I think Zeno understood the paradox, but none of his
        "peers" did. &gt; In the example of the arrow, one can also say that the
        arrow takes half as much time for each step and conclude that time never
        passes. Archery in a vacuum? &gt; (If we could reach a point in the
        future, we'd have to get half way there, then half of the remaining time
        etc., so we'd conclude that time never passes and of course then we
        couldn't have shot an arrow to begin with!) Right. One of the paradoxes
        (paradoces?) has one of two runners catching the other. We're dealing
        with two relative speeds and we define speed as distance covered over
        time. s=d/t. By leaving time out of the equation we're essentially
        trying to divide by zero. Nice talking with you, David J Salvia --- In

        it was posted at around the time I was in &gt; the US at the start of
        the year, so I missed it. Since I'm off to &gt; China on holiday on
        Tuesday I'd better try to reply right now. &gt; &gt; It's been a while
        now but as I recall, from scanning the emails, you &gt; were wanting to
        look at densities of primes by (effectively) looking &gt; at the density
        of non-primes (and subtracting from 1 if you want to &gt; get the
        densitiy of primes). &gt; Thus you were looking at 1/2+1/3-1/6 etc. I
        will agree with you that &gt; you can define density so that 1/2 of the
        numbers beyond a particular &gt; point are divisible by 2 and 1/3 are
        divisible by 3 so that &gt; 1/2+1/3-1/6=2/3 are divisible by either 2 or
        3. &gt; There's a bit of a problem though in proceeding like this. The
        sum you &gt; get is not absolutely convergent so the order in which you
        add the &gt; terms is important. This is a strange property of infinite
        series &gt; which people may or may not be aware of - if the series you
        are adding &gt; up is conditionally but not absolutely convergent then
        if you add up &gt; the terms in a different order you can get different
        answers. In fact, &gt; by appropriately ordering the terms you can get
        any limit you want or &gt; you can get divergence etc. &gt; (By the way,
        at this point it might be as well to add that the &gt; recurring number
        0.9999.... does equal 1, in respect of the end of &gt; your post, as can
        be seen by the definition of 0.999... which is the &gt; sum of an
        absolutely convergent series). &gt; One problem with 1/2+1/3-1/6 is that
        the -1/6 corrects for multiples &gt; of 6 (that have already been
        accounted for in the overlap of &gt; accounting for 2 and then 3) but by
        the time you need to account for &gt; multiples of 6 you should already
        have accounted for multiples of 5. &gt; i.e. 1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6. &gt; It
        would seem that it is the limit (if it exists, which it should) of &gt;
        f(x) where f(x) is defined as the sum of -[(-1)^s(y)]/y where
        1&lt;y&lt;=x &gt; is square free and s(y) is the number of prime factors
        of y. (Summed &gt; over increasing y) &gt; In other words, f(2)=1/2 and
        if x+1 is not square-free then &gt; f(x+1)=f(x) and otherwise f(x+1)is
        either f(x)+1/(x+1) or f(x)-1/(x+1) &gt; according as x+1 is a product
        of an odd or even number of primes. The &gt; limit of this sum should
        then be the density of non-primes. &gt; Thus the partial sums would look
        like: &gt; f(2)=1/2 &gt; f(3)=1/2+1/3 &gt; f(4)=1/2+1/3 &gt;
        f(5)=1/2+1/3+1/5 &gt; f(6)=1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6 &gt; f(7)=1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6+1/7
        &gt; f(8)=1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6+1/7 &gt; f(9)1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6+1/7 &gt;
        f(10)=1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6-1/10 &gt; &gt; Of course, this isn't really the
        true density either, but - and I've &gt; not really thought about this -
        presumably in the limit it should &gt; become 1, since in the limit
        pi(x)/x tends to 0. The true density of &gt; non-primes, up to x, would
        be 1-pi(x)/x (where pi(x) is the number of &gt; primes less than or
        equal to x). &gt; There are various asymptotics for pi(x)/x (as given by
        the Prime &gt; Number Theorem) for example. The Riemann Hypothesis
        provides for &gt; better asymptotics (if it is true). &gt; &gt; Zeno's
        paradox is only a paradox because at the time of Zeno, limits &gt; were
        not well-defined. In the example of the arrow, one can also say &gt;
        that the arrow takes half as much time for each step and conclude that
        &gt; time never passes. (If we could reach a point in the future, we'd
        have &gt; to get half way there, then half of the remaining time etc.,
        so we'd &gt; conclude that time never passes and of course then we
        couldn't have &gt; shot an arrow to begin with!) &gt; The fact is that
        there is a number, namely 1, to which the partial &gt; sums in the Zeno
        example become arbitrarily close provided you take &gt; sufficiently
        many terms. Such a number is defined to be a limit of the &gt; sequence
        - I've been a bit loose in my language here but the precise &gt;
        definitions are well known. Further more, because the real numbers are
        &gt; endowed with a Hausdorff topological structure (even a metric space
        &gt; structure) this limit is unique and we can well-define &gt;
        1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16+...=1 (and similarly &gt;
        1/10+1/100+1/1000+1/10000+...=1/9 etc.). &gt; &gt; Basically, in looking
        at things concerned with infinite series you &gt; have to be extra
        careful - not that I've been too careful in this &gt; email (I've not
        examined the series &gt;
        1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6+1/7-1/10+1/11+1/13-1/14-1/15+1/17+1/19-1/21-1/22+...
        &gt; for convergence for example). My complaint about 1/2+1/3-1/6 etc.
        is &gt; that it is not immediately obvious that this will converge and,
        if it &gt; does, that it will converge to the correct answer. I presume
        that this &gt; would continue 1/2+1/3-1/6+1/5-1/10-1/15+1/30+... and
        more generally, &gt; after +1/p the next terms would correct in some way
        (whether ordered &gt; by denomiator or by number of factors in the
        denominator and then by &gt; denominator is not clear). &gt; Whether the
        sum I gave will converge (and if it does, to the correct &gt; answer) is
        also something to question. I've not checked it, as I &gt; mentione
        above, but it does seem to me that it would be a more &gt; anatural
        order. Even so, it's not the correct formula for the partial &gt;
        densities either - but the whole point is that pi(x) isn't easy to &gt;
        approximate, without using something like the prime number theorem, &gt;
        anyway. &gt; &gt; --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; &gt; &gt; I was expressing these ideas in English, and I see it has
        led to &gt; &gt; misunderstanding. Put aside formal language for the
        moment. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Infinities have finite aspects: though a
        series of numbers like &gt; &gt; 1,2,3,4 is considered to have no end
        (that is no limit finite meaning &gt; &gt; an end or a limit) it has a
        beginning. It also has individual numbers &gt; &gt; like 1 or 10,000,001
        which is another finite aspect. SO in relating to &gt; &gt; an finite
        aspect of an infine series you (logically and fairly) realte &gt; &gt;
        to a fiven point so the group of numbers divisible by 2 is larger than
        &gt; &gt; the group of numbers divisible by three, so i consider the
        subset to &gt; &gt; be of different sizes as well. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        If you take *all* of the numbers in the infinirte set 1,2,3,4 and &gt;
        &gt; so forth, and consider that as one whole thing you can relate to
        the &gt; &gt; idea of infinity equalling one if you graph it. So on our
        graph as the &gt; &gt; position of the number 2, half of all the numbers
        after that are not &gt; &gt; prime, this is what I meant by density,
        after the number 3, you have &gt; &gt; 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/6 of the numbers
        after that are not prime, so the &gt; &gt; "density" of non-prime
        numbers grows and the density of possible prime &gt; &gt; numbers drops.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To clarify, I was using density to mean the
        *percentage* of numbers &gt; &gt; beyond a prime that are not prime.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can chart this, in numerical order one step at a
        time, and &gt; &gt; after a while obtain a line with characteristics
        that can be noted, &gt; &gt; and from which it may possible to predict
        where the next prime is &gt; &gt; likely to fall. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        For this density to reach zero would mean that there were no prime &gt;
        &gt; numbers after a particular point, which I don't think can happen.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *** &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; People are misled by
        misunderstanding a term. They don't understand &gt; &gt; that they're
        dealing an infinity of finite objects and they neatly &gt; &gt; overlook
        what that means. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you misplay infinities you get
        things like 1/9 = .11111... &gt; &gt; (point one unending) and 8/9 =
        .88888... (point eight unending) so 1/9 &gt; &gt; + 8/9 +=9/9 =
        .99999... (point nine unending) = 1. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is like
        Zeno's paradox that .9 unending is an infinite series &gt; &gt; of
        nines, almost getting to one but not quite. &gt; &gt; You shoot an arrow
        at a fence then describe it as "the arrow goes &gt; &gt; halfway there,
        then half way there, etc." Thought the arrow hits the &gt; &gt; fence
        the description never gets there. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards, &gt; &gt;

        Hi to all FMC'ers! The results of this week's challenge are now
        available from the FMC page - www.cubestation.co.uk
        &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/&gt; Quite a quiet week, but
        congratulations to Charles Tsai who posted the shortest solution to an
        FMC since the competition began, he has reduced the benchmark to just 21
        moves! Thank you to all who entered! Also added to the results of FMC
        #65 03/10/04 is Alexander Ooms' solution, which was posted in time last
        week but an error on my part meant that I didn't post it with the other
        results! Sorry Alex, your solution is now listed on the results page.
        I'm planning to do something a little different for the Christmas
        Challenge, but at the moment I haven't got a clue what! Any suggestions
        would be taken on board :D Speak soon! Dan :-) [Non-text portions of

        Nope. ("tubable?" I assume you mean "tunable.") The centers with the
        arched underside are part of the new cubes, but the new tunable cubes,
        with screws instead of rivets, are only available in the DIY kits on
        rubiks.com...when they have them in stock. DJ

        Hi Everyone, For those of you who were at the US Rubiks Nationals
        earlier this year, you'll know that I've been living and working in the
        US for the last while. It was great catching up with the American cubers
        (plus Ton) whom I met in Toronto last year! :) Now I have other news,
        which is that my company has moved me to the UK. I've seen that there
        have been heaps of cubing comps in Europe this year, so it'll be great
        to be closer to that action. :) I'm looking forward to meeting and
        catching up with the European cubers! :) Jasmine

        Hi Jasmine :-) At least if u gonna be living in the south of UK u gonna
        be pretty close to Holland, which is really a _hot spot_ for
        cubing/puzzling. And of coz u can meet up with DanH also ;-) It has been

        I think it was one of my first questions when I arrived in this group.
        Adjusting screws can be useful, but it doesn't help if the springs are
        too old. Does anybody know where to buy that kind of springs? Maybe a
        bit harder than the original ones would be better. Gilles.

        hey gilles. merry christmas btw :P anyways if you want spring
        replacements, one thing i do i go down to chinatown where they have
        those generic tiled rubiks cubes that break easily. interestingly, their
        springs are pretty good. bought one for $2.50 and i removed the springs
        from the center and used them. pretty neat i hope you find this useful.

        Like Salvia said, don't put the washer between the spring and the piece.
        If your cube is too lose, though, that's probably not the problem. I did
        this when I assembled my first and all my friends cubes, so I ended up
        destroying all their springs - having to buy new ones (springs, not
        cubes). So yeah, don't do that. :P --- In

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just recieved a DIY-kit. I started
        assembling it, but when I &gt; put &gt; &gt; &gt; in the screws as deep
        as possible, and then pop the pieces in, &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; cube is
        way too loose. I thinks the screws should go in deeper &gt; &gt; &gt;
        somehow, but that seems impossible... Does this sound like I am &gt;
        &gt; &gt; doing something wrong? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Joel. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; P.S.:
        Merry Christmas, everybody!! :D &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Joel, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I imagine if you put a washer between the screw head and the
        &gt; center &gt; &gt; cubie piece that would solve the problem. Don't
        put the washer &gt; between &gt; &gt; the center cubie piece and the
        spindle. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; David J &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; P.S. I second your P.S. - Merry Christmas to All!

        days ago, John (lkyawkyaw) and I talked briefly about how almost all

        Once you get all the corners, you solve the edges of one face first. I'm
        not sure what you do for this step, but what I do is forget about the
        center at the moment, and just put three edges into the corners so it's
        a sort of U shape. Then pair up the center and the last edge, and you
        can put both of them into the right place in one algorithm. The
        algorithm isn't very hard, so you can probably figure it out, but if you
        can't I'll help you. For the last face, I put two edges in at once.
        First put one edge in, which will mess up one edge on the first face,
        but then put the second edge in which resolves the edge on the first
        face. Sorta hard to explain, but I hope this helps.... --- In

        well. I too recieved paper stickers. The screws you got may fit into the
        axel, but a little convincing is needed. It took a little force to get
        screws in as well. In the end, the finished cube was acceptable, but no
        better than the new 'pre-made' arched cubes, in my opinion. -Chris

        You should check out Josef Jelnek's site. There is a link to in at
        speedcubing.com. He has good descriptions of corners first methods. The
        Waterman system is a fast corners method but you have to learn a ton of
        algs. Wayne --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Ryan

        No one hardly ever goes to the yahoo group corner first &gt; so I guess
        I'll just ask away here. My question is about solving the &gt; edges. Is
        there any advance thing you can do to speed the dang thing &gt; up or

        Yes, of course, there are direct algorithms for any possible position.
        However, the particular case you mention is most often solved by
        swapping two edges and then using a simple PLL. I don't know of any
        other algorithm, nor any people who use such. The double edge swapper,
        by the way, if you don't already have it, is: r2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 u2 It is
        short, easy to learn and easy to perform, so I see no reason for
        learning alternative approaches, especially when these alternative
        approaches are applicable in so few cases. --- In

        My corners' first is like Ryans, and I solve the opposite faces by
        pairing upper and lower edges in the middle slice, and then place them.
        However, I normally leave one edge left in either the upper or the lower
        face. From there, I have options so that I get the correct orientation
        of the edges in the middle layer when placing the last edge in the
        upper/lower face. /Anders --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; the center at the moment, and just put three edges into the &gt;
        corners so &gt; &gt; it's a sort of U shape. Then pair up the center and
        the last edge, &gt; and &gt; &gt; you can put both of them into the
        right place in one algorithm. The &gt; &gt; algorithm isn't very hard,
        so you can probably figure it out, but &gt; if &gt; &gt; you can't I'll
        help you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the last face, I put two edges in at
        once. First put one edge &gt; in, &gt; &gt; which will mess up one edge
        on the first face, but then put the &gt; second &gt; &gt; edge in which
        resolves the edge on the first face. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorta hard to

        Here are pics of how I do it in picture 002 I have placed the first
        three centres, and allowed them to go to the sides for now. In picture
        003 the forth centre in in place. &gt;From here I twist the centres
        around so they are all in the proper place and place the edges and
        corners, going around the center in picture.jpg you see all that remains
        to be inserted is the final two edge pieces. Hope this helps Peter

        Hi everyone! The results of the Christmas FMC are now online on my
        website - www.cubestation.co.uk &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/&gt;
        and click on the Fewest Move Challenge link. It was a really enjoyable
        challenge, I hope you had a lot of fun taking part, and if you didn't
        take part there is always the New Years challenge to play in! It was
        hard work posting the results, so I apologise for any aesthetic
        mistakes, although I am 99.9% sure that all the solutions listed are
        correct and do solve the scramble to the desired position. If you think
        there is an error please get in touch. Happy New Year guys, have a great
        cubing 2005, and make it your New Year resolution to take part in the
        FMC, we are a friendly bunch ;) Dan Harris :-) [Non-text portions of

        might expect the larger cubes to be released. This was the answer: Dear
        Friend, Thank you for contacting us again. The release date for the O.C
        No5, No6a, No7 has not yet been defined. We will inform you when they
        are ready. Best regards Konstantinos Verdes I'll pass it on if I hear
