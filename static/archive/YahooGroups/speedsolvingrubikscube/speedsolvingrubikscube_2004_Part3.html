That still doesn&#x27;t address the matter of allowing an
entire 90 degrees...If someone is running a marathon
and they don&#x27;t finish, there is no penalty for
them...they just DNF. I agree there should be a
reasonable margin of error allowed. You are timed for
solving the cube, and if you set down your cube an
entire turn off that&#x27;s just not right.

          <div class="email-content">I agree, there should be no excuse for your cube being
thrown off such a large amount.  The cube I am using
is so loose that corners sometime turn in place during
my solve (obviously a bad thing) but the point is with
such a dramatically loose cube, I&#x27;ve never encountered
having my cube make a quarter turn while stopping my
time.  I think the majority of the time that someone
will stop the time and their cube is one turn from
solved, it is because they just missed making that
last turn.

          <div class="email-content">Welcome to the group!

There are lots of cube solution sites, many of which are quite 
complicated and for more advanced cubers. I&#x27;d recommend starting 
with a beginner solution to familiarise yourself with the basics.

I wrote a beginner solution which I&#x27;ve used to successfully teach 
many people: 
http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html

And Gilles has recently posted another beginner cube page: 
http://grrroux.free.fr/begin/Begin.html

Good luck and happy cubing,

          <div class="email-content">Welcome,

            Jasmine probably already replied, but just encase you&#x27;re still
looking at solutions I have one at http://www.deepcube.tk
&lt;http://www.deepcube.tk/>    (if that doesn&#x27;t work, which for some reason
some people say it doesn&#x27;t, try http://www.geocities.com/evanmgates ).  I
designed my solution to lead up to the most popular speed solving method,
the Fridrich method.  And if you do use my solution, please let me know what
you think, and what I should add/change.

 

Hope this helps

 

Evan

misaligned to the point where we would consider it one turn off yet it <br>
seems too much to disregard the entire solve.  2 seconds is more then <br>
an apt penalty as it would easily take under one second to fix the one <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan
There are instructions with the kit (when you buy it) and yes it is very
easy to find the right screws. It comes with rivets at the moment but the
Rubik&#x27;s warehouse in Canada is sourcing a bulk order of the right screws and
it will come with both.

Do you mean the black one? There&#x27;s nothing that makes me think I can 
assemble it myself.

The instructions at the bottom only speak about stickers and lubing. 
The &quot;DIY instructions&quot; link image is a broken link. So if that&#x27;s the 
cube and it comes unassembled so we can assemble it ourselves (btw, is 
it easy to find fitting screws?) then I have to say it&#x27;s very poorly 
advertised...

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hey!!

I can&#x27;t really see that the stacktimer is too big is a problem. As 
long as it fits on the &quot;table&quot; in a tournament there is no problem. 
And if u have ur own private stacktimer u can indeed cut it smaller 
with scissors, as long as u dont cut away the timer, LOL :D Having a 
cube logo on it is not important to me.

Now back to my original issue. Yes i can see ron&#x27;s point that ur 
hands could jump when u want to stop/lap the timer. And the recorded 
time could be higher than when u first stopped/lapped the timer. I 
didn&#x27;t think about this problem and i can see it&#x27;s a serious one. 
However i can&#x27;t see how how laptime would lead to &quot;speculative&quot; 
cubing. One could be given a maximum of say 5 secs to carry on if 
the cube is &quot;accidentally&quot; not solved. If u dont proceed during 
these 5 secs and the cube is not solved then the solve is 
disqualified. And even putting cube down and carrying on will lead 
to losing time compared with a &quot;straight&quot; solve with no interruption 
due to putting it down early.

I also sun understnt what is meant by that the distance between cube 
and hand is not standardised. In Amsterdam we could put down the 
cube after preinspection in the orientation we wanted and the 
dostance from our hands that we wanted. I can&#x27;t see any point in 
standardising this. Obviously u cant be allowed to hold or touch the 
cube/puzzle when u are about to start ur solve.

I guess my issue could be compared with longjump ;-) Even if u jump 
11 meters but ur foot is 1 cm across the line on &quot;take-off&quot; its 
disqualified. I always thought is should be possible to instead 
measure from ur actual take-off and not the line. Hehe ... So i 
guess im gonna accept that one won&#x27;t be allowed to carry on solving 
after putting the puzzle down and getting a time. It was just a 
thought ...

Cheers! Happy cubing all :-D

But we don&#x27;t only use the Stackmat for tournament use!

I don&#x27;t have a Stackmat. =P

Anyway, I&#x27;m sure the average person would much rather have a good 
looking slightly smaller Stackmat than one which was ruthlessly cut 
off at a given point.

That&#x27;s

So maybe we should have some standard, then? What I&#x27;m saying is that 
for a cube timer, there should be standard positions on the mat not 
only for the hands but also for the cube.

These aren&#x27;t complaints... I&#x27;m just pointing out the wrongs of the 
Stackmat.

I can program perfectly okay myself. That&#x27;s not the point anyway. If I 
used a Stackmat together with your program, I&#x27;d have just as much 
hustle as if I used a Stackmat with Hunt&#x27;s program. The point is that 
the Stackmat doesn&#x27;t do what I want, which is to either calculate 
averages or to automatically communicate with a device/software that 
does.

BUT, there are &quot;imaginary&quot; timers that are BETTER.

<br>
I went over to the &quot;Official Rubik Timer&quot; homepage and it looks like<br>
they are making progress on the new timer, however, I don&#x27;t think<br>
it&#x27;ll be any more useful than a stackmat, especially since I have to<br>
wait a few more months to get my hands on one. The only benefit I can<br>
see with using the new timer is the ability to take an average, but<br>
the spec sheet doesn&#x27;t say it will have the ability to generate<br>
scrambles, so I don&#x27;t see the point. I will still need to be sitting<br>
in front of my computer to scramble the cube, and it wouldn&#x27;t take<br>
anymore time for me to just type the times in too. For the same price,<br>
I&#x27;ll just get a stackmat now and save myself some time.<br>

&quot;It looks like the Rubik&#x27;s timer will be able to generate and display<br>
scramble sequences due to the beautiful 65 x 132 graphical LCD&quot;<br>
<br>
hmmm. I guess I could just spend another $60 if it&#x27;s really that great...<br>

          <div class="email-content">I really like the idea of a timer able to take averages and display <br>
scrambles. I also think that the optics could be constructed in a <br>
way to minimize cheating. What we have now is a great opportunity to <br>
affect the final product. With constructive criticism given to the <br>
developer i think we might change the final product into pretty much <br>
whatever we want. Great eh?<br>
<br>
Since stackmat tournament displays can be used with the new timer I <br>
don&#x27;t think there will be too much waste of money if buying a <br>
stackmat now and a &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Competition Timer&quot; later.<br>
<br>
I simply think we have a great chance to affect the product the way <br>
we like it. I believe that will be much easier than talking <br>
speedstacks into changing the stackmat. We might even be able to <br>
talk them into switching the optics for something similar to the <br>
stackmat if thats what we want.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Just a thought:<br>
<br>
How tough would it be to get the pinouts from the stackmat and simply <br>
create an add-on device (that connects to the tournament display <br>
port) that would give scrambles and log times?<br>
<br>
All that device would need to know is the final time of a solve, and <br>
obviously that information gets sent through the port in some <br>
manner.  You could even make accept, discard, and pop buttons for it.<br>
<br>
This way, we could still use the stackmats (since the stackmat people <br>
have shown tremendous support and many people seem to really like <br>
them).  Also, since it was said before that the judges take care of <br>
averaging and scrambling, it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue not having the add-<br>
on in competition.<br>
<br>
Maybe I&#x27;m crazy, but I suppose it&#x27;s possible.  Thoughts?<br>

How about a USB-hub (or whatever is needed) for connecting up to 
4/6/8 timer devices. And each timer device could have a unique ID so 
the computer knows which timer is submitting a time. This way a 
tournament could be &quot;fully automatic&quot; ;-)

          <div class="email-content">There&#x27;s this stuff... what&#x27;s it called again... oh yeah, I remember:<br>
<br>
Paper<br>
<br>
You can easily print 120 scrambles on a single sheet of paper that you <br>
can carry around. Shouldn&#x27;t add much volume/weight to the timer I <br>
think. And with a pen you can write down the times next to the <br>
scrambles. It is also very cheap.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
Stefan<br>
<br>
&gt; The only benefit I can<br>
&gt; see with using the new timer is the ability to take an average, but<br>
&gt; the spec sheet doesn&#x27;t say it will have the ability to generate<br>
&gt; scrambles, so I don&#x27;t see the point. I will still need to be sitting<br>
&gt; in front of my computer to scramble the cube, and it wouldn&#x27;t take<br>
&gt; anymore time for me to just type the times in too.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Dave,

I know you know the company and what&#x27;s going on and it&#x27;s not like I 
don&#x27;t trust you, but I&#x27;d really like to see this written on the 
product page. Would that be possible? Also, when will they start 
shipping them with screws?

If anyone buys this please let us know what it looks like and how you 
like it. For me in Germany there&#x27;s a huge cost overhead (shipping, 
tax, etc) which is why I haven&#x27;t ordered anything from rubiks.com yet.

Cheers!
Stefan

Yes ... and we just scan the piece of paper when we post the results

          <div class="email-content">Does anyone want to try this?  Are we talking about modifying existing
stackmats?  Or would we need to build a new timer?

Watching all the olympic swimming relays, a cube relay would be really
really fun.  I think if we can like timers together so that you can&#x27;t
start your timer until the other one is stopped... that would work.  That
way, if the second person tries to start before the first person stops
their timer, his timer won&#x27;t run and that&#x27;s how we would check.

It might be fun to build some cheap timers and try to do this.  I believe
the StackMat works using capacitance.  We could make it a lot cheaper by
just using a button (sacrificing accuracy of course, so I&#x27;m not sure the
timer could be used in competition).

I know that Cup Stacking has relays.  Does anyone know what their rules
are?

          <div class="email-content">I agree with Jasmine - I have learned a similar method
like hers and they seem to be the best - I have a
friend who has started cubing and she actually learned
and understood the crazy directions that come with the
cube.

However once we showed her Jasmine&#x27;s method and a few
other things she will swear by them compared to some
of the others out there for those who are learning.  A
plus to these methods is that she has been only
solving a month and her best time is 55 sec with an
avg of min 25 secs.

No views on the professor&#x27;s theory -- has he done any controlled

To be frank, the words you use here don&#x27;t persuade me that you are 
enjoying this regime very much.  Are a few extra hours work/play 
really worth the suffering, when it goes on for month after month?  

(I&#x27;m an insomniac, btw, and not doing very well on my 4-5 hours sleep 
per night.)

          <div class="email-content">There doesn&#x27;t need to be a standard placement of the
cube for one.  As long as the person is not touching
the cube, everyone is allowed the same advantage. 
Otherwise you might argue that someone with long
fingers is closer to the cube than someone with short.
Or some bologna argument like that.

How manys sports allow a penalty when someone is close
to their goal, but doesn&#x27;t complete it?

Football...well he got a yard away from scoring a
touchdown, so just give them 5 points instead of 6.

Basketball...Three point shot rattles out...ahh just
give them a point, it was close.

Baseball...Well...it was a foul ball, but was close to
being in...so it&#x27;s in don&#x27;t worry about it.

This is a very silly argument of course.  My point is
allowing an entire turn off is just foolish.  If the
cuber is not able to control this from happening
he/she just plain needs to work on it.  We need to be
a little more strict, especially on the 2 second
penalty their can be some compromise.  I can at worst
see 45 degrees off as an acceptable margin of error. 
So possibly give 30-45 degrees off a 2 second penalty.
 &lt;30 degrees gives no penalty.  And >45 degrees is a
DNF.  I&#x27;m simply asking that we give an openminded
look at the rule in and of itself, and not defend it
just because it is how we&#x27;ve been doing it.

          <div class="email-content">Hi night crawlers,<br>
<br>
I agree completely. I have read numerous articles and books on sleep and<br>
dream-sleep.  I have seen documentaries, read about the neurology behind it.<br>
And all the official studies end up concluding the same thing. It is humanly<br>
not possible to &#x27;train&#x27; yourself to &#x27;need&#x27; less sleep. You will always need<br>
the same, probably geneticly determined, amount of sleep.<br>
<br>
Of course it&#x27;s everyones dream (yeah punt intended) to go about doing lots<br>
of fun things at night and still feel great, but the truth is, lots of<br>
people go about doing lots of fun things at night and feel horrible during<br>
the day.<br>
<br>
One thing that everyone also agrees upon is that taking short naps during<br>
the day will cut down the hours needed to feel fresh and awake again. But<br>
the percentage you can take off your normal sleep hours are not that high.<br>
<br>
Another thing is that we need our REM sleep (Rapid Eye Movement, during<br>
dream sleep) and our deep sleep (having Delta/Theta brain waves) the most.<br>
When we go to sleep the brain slowly moves from Beta to Apha to Delta to<br>
sometimes Theta. And so it seems likely that the scarse people we all know<br>
who can do with 3/4 hours of sleep a night are faster at getting there.<br>
Again, nothing has been proved. And no drugs are known that can accomplish<br>
this. It is possible though that some trained yogi can put themselves in<br>
Theta stage just by meditation while still awake. But you know what they<br>
have to do. Right: they sit with legs crossed and don&#x27;t move a muscle. So<br>
unless you think that is the most fun thing to do.... They just found an<br>
alternative to give the body what it needs.<br>
<br>
Sleep deprivation training is just one of those ghost story myths that need<br>
to be taken down once in a while, until some scientist probably finds the<br>
sleep-gen and decides to take it out.....<br>
<br>
Final conclusion: no scientist can explain why we need to sleep more than 3<br>
hours, and no scientist can explain why we dream during sleep.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The stackmats are perfectly useable, but I&#x27;m sure a custom made cube <br>
timer would be better.<br>
<br>
My biggest problem is that to get the best times, you have to drop <br>
the cube from a certain height on the table. The 3x3x3&#x27;s can handle <br>
the beating pretty well, but I&#x27;d be worried about the bigger cubes. <br>
The fall can also accidentally turn a side and make a solved cube <br>
unsolved. Even if that is very rare, it&#x27;s a sticky rule question, as <br>
is the case where a solved cube breaks from the fall.<br>
<br>
It is a real issue that you can keep turning after you&#x27;ve stopped the <br>
clock, but  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big one. For one thing, it&#x27;s <br>
perfectly possible to do it with a stackmat as well, if you you use <br>
the &quot;heel&quot; (what *is* the english word?) of your hands to touch the <br>
sensors. Either way, I think it&#x27;s real hard to use this in real life <br>
to get any kind of advantage.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s also a bit goofy to have a judge hold their hand over the cube. <br>
If we&#x27;re hiding it from view, it should be part of the machine so <br>
it&#x27;s done uniformly. That could be done using stackmats as well, so <br>
it&#x27;s not a big issue.<br>
<br>
The Budapest world championships had a timer with a photo cell (I <br>
think), and I thought it worked real well.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Richard and other friends,

You have an interesting point here.

I want to give some counter examples.
In 100 meter dash you are allowed to have a false start. It used to 
be three! Now it is only 1.
And after two false starts in total, the third time we will start and 
false starters will be disqualified afterwards.

In swimming there are no second chances. There is only one start, and 
whoever starts early will be disqualified afterwards. This used to be 
different until we saw too many restarts with too many competitors 
having to come out of the pool very often.
So rules in different sports are different. The false start rule is 
there to give competitors a second chance, because there is always a 
lot of tension out there.

Every top tennis player can serve correctly. Still we have a second 
serve. (I would love to see tennis get rid of second serve!)

In gymnastics you will get points even if you do not completely or 
perfectly do a summer sault. If you fall from the balance beam, then 
0.5 point is subtracted, but you can still have a 9.5 score!

In ice hockey you can make a bad foul, for which a referee can give 
you a time penalty, but you will only be completely expelled for the 
really bad fouls.

In snooker you can make several points in a row. But if your last 
ball is a foul, then you do not lose all the other points you made. 
Your opponent does receive some extra points to punish you.

In kayaking only time counts, but you receive penalty time if you 
touch a barricade or the wall.

I could go on for ever about special rules in sports.
Anyway, there are several second chances in sports.

In our hobby puzzle defects and incomplete solves are the main 
discussion points. They are worth a good discussion. We have had that 
discussion before. The current regulations are a result of that 
discussion.
Your points are interesting. Still I think that the current 
incomplete solve rule is:
1) fair, because you cannot abuse the rule, the penalty is high 
enough to make you try to prevent an incomplete solve.
2) reasonable, because under pressure people tend to make small 
mistakes.
3) fine, because (almost...) everyone can live with it.

Have fun,

Ron

I enjoyed the counter-examples :)  But how far away
from a solved puzzle can you get, before you cross the

proposal is this (after some thought):

a. between 0 and 45 degrees margin in either direction
b. &lt;45 degree should be seriously reconsidered, and
possibly re-adjust the criteria for a 2 second penalty
to be a little more strict. I really think a full turn
is too much!

On basis of this proposal, it should following your

I completely agree, under pressure people do make
small mistakes.  90 degrees off I think is jumping the
boundary between fair, and giving too much.  And in
the same regard, if you are going to give 90 degree
margin of error, why not give 180?  Missing the last
face turn of an algorithm for example can mean a 2
second penalty for someone who missed an U&#x27; or U, but
a DNF for someone who missed an U2 purely because the
pressure got to them and they weren&#x27;t able to finish.

I mainly enjoyed this point.  Even if everyone can
live with it, perhaps it isn&#x27;t right?  There are many
things I can live with...such as this rule I&#x27;m
disagreeing with.  I am not arguing my point because
of a selfish alterior motive.  Whatever rules are laid
down I will go along with.  But I will exercise my
right to not... just accept it because everyone else
is &#x27;going with the flow&#x27;.  If I am indeed the only one
in this group that feels giving 90 degrees is too
much, then I will withdraw my argument.  I still have
to stress the importance of seeing both arguments
clearly, and I have been openminded and willing to
listen to everyone else&#x27;s views.

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys-this is a good discussion here and I thought I would add my <br>
2 cents. First we must define what the solved state of the cube is. <br>
In my opinion, it is any state where the face is less than 45 <br>
degrees off from perfectly aligned. This is beacause if the face <br>
is &quot;rounded&quot; to the nearest quarter turn, it would be solved. 30 <br>
degrees as some have mentioned seems rather arbitrary. What makes 30 <br>
solved and 31 not? If the face is turned more than 45 degrees, I do <br>
agree with the +2second rule for reasons mentioned earlier. Unless I <br>
misunderstood the rules, if the face is 180 degrees off, it is a 2 <br>
second penalty and not a DNF. Now here&#x27;s another question to think <br>
about although it may not occur to often, it is still just as <br>
important. What if the U(last) face is off by 90 degrees and then <br>
the L face is misaligned by 22 degrees? Is that still +2 or a DNF? I <br>
say it should be a DNF because 2 faces need to be turned and it it <br>
turns into not just a misalignment issue but an unsolved cube. But <br>
to complicate things even further, it is possible to have 2 adjacent <br>
faces misaligned at the same time, especially with loose springy <br>
speedcubes. What then? sorry if I added a lot more disorder to a <br>

(if interested read rules below)
-------------------------------------------------
A cube is solved when all 6 sides are restored to
solid color states.  All pieces of the cube must be
attached to the cube for it to be solved.  If a piece
is ejected as the cube is placed down but it otherwise
solved, the cube is not considered to be in a solved
state.  If a center cap is ejected from the cube, the
cube, under discretion of the judge, is considered
solve.

All pieces must be returned to their original starting
location.

The cube may be misaligned in the following matter.  A
face of the cube may be misaligned by less than 45
degrees as defined by the WRCA.  The inner corner of
the cube on the misaligned face may not cross the
inner edge of the corresponding middle slice.  For
more information, see the diagram provided by the
WRCA.  If a cube is misaligned by more than the above
criteria, a 2 second penalty will be added to the
competitor���s solve time given that the cube is one
quarter turn from the solved state otherwise.

If a cube is one quarter turn from completion, 2
seconds will be added to the solve time.

In all other cases, the solve is disqualified.

Only the resting state of the cube will be considered.
 The cube must come to a complete stop in its solved
state in order for the cube to be solved.

circles 2-3 times to get the time to stop.  I also recall judges <br>
having stopwatches at hand.  If our stackmat doesn&#x27;t stop, are we <br>

          <div class="email-content">I had thought it&#x27;s a DNF if one face is 180 degrees off?

Personally, I am happy with the 2 second penalty for 90 degrees off 
(and I am also very happy to see that we&#x27;re all good enough friends 
that people can completely disagree with this and we can have a good 
debate on the issue!)

I think one face being 90 degrees off is quite a different situation 
to one face being 180 degrees off. Why? Well, because 180 degrees 
tends to suggest that the person actually didn&#x27;t complete the final 
algorithm, whereas (I would guess that) the situation where one face 
is, say, 45 to 90 degrees off is most likely to happen:
(i) when the cuber completed the algorithm but the face turned when 
they dropped it on the timer at the end of the solve; or
(ii) the cuber was nervous on stage, their hands were shaking and 
they accidentally used slightly too much or too little force for the 
final flick.

Arguably, in these two situations the cube has not been solved 
(Richard - I imagine this might be your view? And that the cuber 
needs to work on their technique and get more practice using a 
stackmat?) However, in both of the situations I described in the 
previous paragraph, the cuber has not acted dishonestly.

I&#x27;d guess that it&#x27;s reasonably unlikely that either of the 
situations would lead to the final face being 180 degrees off, and 
thus I don&#x27;t think 180 degrees off should be treated the same as 90 
degrees off. Even if the situations did lead to the face being 180 
degrees off, we have to draw the line somewhere, and I guess I&#x27;d 
draw it at 90 degrees. If we allowed 180 degrees then the final face 
could be in *any* position and the solve would still be counted 
(even if with a penalty) and this doesn&#x27;t seem right.

For these reasons, and the reasons posted earlier by Ron, I think 
the 2 second penalty for 90 degrees off is okay. However, 180 
degrees off is probably stretching it too far.

sorry about that. I thought all this time 180 degrees was still +2. 
My mistake, I should really reread the rules before I post. Anyway, 
I see why over 90 is DNF and I can agree with that.

          <div class="email-content">No, you may not.  Pretend as if there is no stop watch.  It is the<br>
competitor&#x27;s responsibility to stop the timer.  You aren&#x27;t done until you<br>
stop the timer which means whoever has the stop watch shouldn&#x27;t stop the<br>
stop watch until you stop the timer.  A timer defect would be if the<br>
batteries died or if you are unable to stop the timer with full conatct to<br>
both sensors.<br>
<br>
If a piece pops during a scramble, for WCA tournaments, the scrambles<br>
would need to solve the cube and rescramble.  It doesn&#x27;t happen that often<br>
so it&#x27;s not so bad.  Either that, or they would need to make some<br>
caculation so that they knew the cube was all right.  Otherwise, it will<br>
be assumed to be the competitor&#x27;s fault if anything is wrong.  The only<br>
way that this wouldn&#x27;t be the case is if a piece is twisted or flipped<br>
during scramble and it doesn&#x27;t pop out and the scrambler doesn&#x27;t feel<br>
anything which, though not impossible, is pretty safe to say very rare.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;ve looked into the music rule yet.  Everything of course<br>

&gt; StackMat defects.  I saw several competitors who had to slap the<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Another Issue...I remember at RWC for megaminx event.  A friend and I<br>
&gt; were competing in this event.  When he reached his orientation he<br>
&gt; realized that a corner had been flipped incorrectly.  This ended up<br>
&gt; this way because whoever scrambled it, may have popped a piece and<br>
&gt; put it back in wrong.  The did not get the incorrectly flipped corner<br>
&gt; as a result of his own actions on the minx.  Which brings me to my<br>
&gt; question.  If in a rare case we do get a puzzle with a piece put in<br>
&gt; it wrong, are we able to challenge that, or is it assumed we caused<br>
&gt; the defect?<br>
&gt;<br>

          <div class="email-content">I tend to lean towards this and this is how I treated the US Nationals.

180 degrees is more frequently caused by a person turning the last turn
the wrong way which as Jasmine says, is different from the principles of
something being 90 degrees off.

And when we say 90 and 180 degrees, what we really mean is quarter-turn
and half-turn.

          <div class="email-content">Hi

I think making the contestant stop the timer himself is actually totally
unfair. I know it is custom, but when athletes run the 100m sprint they
don&#x27;t have to press a button to let the judges know they&#x27;re finished.

And I thought the stopwatches at WC2003 were making for a fair competition.
Also video analysis to me sounds fair. You did solve it in time xx.xx so why
not register that?

And for an unsolved cube (>45 degrees), that would not be a solution, so I
think we all would agree on that one.

I don&#x27;t prefer the stackmat. I am having difficulty stopping the timer and I
don&#x27;t like to make a sport out of hitting the stop pads fast. I think a
smaller one with a PC interface would be ideal. Then you can easily hook &#x27;em
up to any big display and super computer if you like.

I&#x27;ve read some really interesting ideas for timer features and 
designs that differ from the StackMat.  However I wanted to bring up 
one &quot;feature&quot; of the StackMat that can&#x27;t be beat: It&#x27;s a real 
device, not theoretical, actually in existence, currently being sold 
and available to us at a pretty reasonable cost (considering it&#x27;s 
the only thing out there of its kind).  :-)

When a different one is available for sale I&#x27;ll consider it.  Until 
then, if we&#x27;re going to buy a timer pad, I think it&#x27;s going to have 
to be a StackMat!

          <div class="email-content">I can bend on the timer thing, although I think if we
compensate for error on solving, we should put though
into compensating for problems with stopping the
timer.  

In regards to the music thing, it could be distracting
to other competitors if loud.  But is possible to
listen to music at a reasonable volume without
distracting anyone.  (I think).

   Along those lines is a concern that came up around
Nationals - should people be allowed to sit while they
solve or should they stand?  Music, standing, sitting
- all things that need to be decided before an offical
competition that way there are no questions about
&quot;what is fair&quot; later on.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I had a new experience for me when fixing up a new speedcube and <br>
just thought I would share.<br>
<br>
The cube is a Studio cube, but it turns out that one of the corner <br>
pieces is messed up.  You can tell that it was poorly molded, such <br>
that one of the 3 inner sides has an extra layer on it and is too <br>
thick.  That thicker side pushes on the adjacent edge a little bit, <br>
forcing it outward and tightening the cube up a bit.  The cube also <br>
pops when I turn it too quickly.<br>
<br>
What&#x27;s so weird about this cube is that it is an AWESOME speed cube.<br>
<br>
What makes this cube so nice is that I have to slow down slightly <br>
from full speed in order to avoid that corner piece from popping.  <br>
Slowing down like this allows me to look ahead really well during <br>
the F2L, and I&#x27;ve been getting some really amazing overall times <br>
(for me).  Also, when I go at that slower speed the cube has hardly <br>
any problem with pops, only when I go too quickly does it really <br>
become a problem.<br>
<br>
I even broke my fastest 3x3x3 official rules average on this cube, <br>
after only a day of working it in!  My new average is 17.30 seconds, <br>
and I think sub-17 will be possible pretty soon.<br>
<br>
Aaaah!!!  My cube has a messed up piece, pops if I go too quickly, <br>
and is a little too tight, and yet it is one of the best I have ever <br>
owned!!!  <br>

can&#x27;t verify this because I&#x27;m just now getting to be pseudo-consistantly <br>

However, I personally don&#x27;t remember trying to break the 32s or 45s <br>

and once sub 40 I started to go by 5s intervals.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Actually, I&#x27;ve been having a good few weeks and just wanted to share <br>
my excitement! I got a new single solve record (23.12s) and a new <br>
best average of 10 (35.57s). :)<br>
<br>
Unlike most people, I tend to practice more *after* a competition <br>
than before. I practice a bit before competitions, but since I&#x27;m yet <br>
to make it past the qualification round at any competition (let <br>
alone any further!), I don&#x27;t take it too seriously and I&#x27;m really <br>
just there to have fun. Anyway, what happened after Worlds, and <br>
again after the US Nationals, is that I got all inspired by all you <br>
super speedcubers and started praticising a lot more.<br>
<br>
The main thing I&#x27;ve been working on recently is making proper use of <br>
inspection time. Previously, I was only planning 1, maybe 2, arms of <br>
the cross during inspection. Now, I&#x27;m planning 3, and often all 4, <br>
arms of the cross.  This has knocked seconds off my time! :) The <br>
other thing I&#x27;ve been doing is practising looking ahead during the <br>
F2L (which, of course, is what everyone always says to do!). I&#x27;ve <br>
been slowing my turn rate slightly, but more than making up for it <br>
by reducing the pause between algs.<br>
<br>
Yay! :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think a lot of it is mental.  Right now, I&#x27;m at the point where a 22 
second solve is average and if it&#x27;s over 23 seconds, I think it&#x27;s bad.  
So if you asked me what my average average was, I&#x27;d say 22 seconds.  My 
best average is 20.78 but a best average comes during the best 
circumstances and not many people carry that around with them all the 
time.

I&#x27;d say you can claim your average to be your real average with 
whatever time you think is fine.  If your average of 100 is 39.47 
seconds, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;ve definitely proven to yourself and everyone else 
that you can solve a cube consistently under 40 seconds.

Part of how I try to improve is by lowering the bar.  I used to be at 
the 25 second average where I thought 25 seconds was okay and 27 
seconds was slow.  I mentally had to tell myself to be discontent with 
the 25 second solve and eventually, the numbers became 23 and 25.

          <div class="email-content">Yeah, I know what you mean by what you &#x27;feel&#x27; is your real average, 
and the times that you &#x27;feel&#x27; happy with.

At the moment, I&#x27;m happy with anything under 40.xx. For 40-42.xx, 
I&#x27;m not happy or unhappy. I feel that anything over 43 seconds is 
not so good, unless there are particular circumstances, eg. not 
warmed up, inadequate lighting.

The fact that I didn&#x27;t feel happy with a solve unless it was 40.xx 
or under, made me wonder my average had reached 40.xx. I figured the 
only way to know was to do a huge bunch of solves and check the 
numbers.

          <div class="email-content">Yes Stefan I did mean face - the issue is that with my last 2 layer (L2L)
strategies especially in the L2L4 case you solve a single &quot;top&quot; face and
then with your next four looks you solve a middle edge and part of the LL
finally finishing with the 4th middle edge and the last part of the LL.  The
middle edge and LL 4 looks takes approx 43 moves although i think with
slightly better optimised algs it could be 41 or 42.  Unless you can solve
the very first face in less than 15 at speed its really not that great a
system.  Big disappointment.  I will put the whole thing up on  awebsite the
week after next when I have some spare time.

Thanks for the feedback.

You say reasonable volume is &#x27;relative&#x27;.  This is
true.  That doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to blast it.  Hey,
I have a compromise though...I think it&#x27;s fair.  When
you meet with all your judges to go over official
rules, bring a discman in, turn it up to an acceptable
volume.  This way all your judges will know what is
too loud.  Then it can be the judges discretion as to
whether or not it is too loud.  Also, at a fellow
competitors request to turn off my headphones I would
be more than happy to oblige.  Also, are their rules
for the volume of the audience?  Since we are
concerned with competitors being distracted, can we
just tell them to be quiet.  Or maybe if someone is
just being too loud can I ask a TD to remove them?  We
really should be careful with how we weigh this
distraction thing I think.

As for music, I don&#x27;t feel like the competitor should
have anything up 
there with him but himself.  (And clothes... because
not everyone is 
over 18.)  Just you and the cube... this is far
fetched, but would if 
someone put music that provided algorithms or
something?  I&#x27;m pretty 
sure they don&#x27;t allow music when people take
standardized tests.

As for a reasonable volume, that&#x27;s also kind of
relative.  I personally 
have a pretty low tolerance to noise levels (not that
I would be 
distracted probably) but I can see how someone could
hear your music 
even when you think it&#x27;s very soft.

and well defined set of rules will help establish cubing as a <br>

<br>
The idea of having a discman at a competition is not unreasonable.  <br>
However, your idea of checking the relative volumes is.  The fewer <br>
things that I have to worry about, and I&#x27;m not saying that a discman is <br>
a bad thing, the better.  Running a tournament is a lot of work and I <br>
am doing things almost every single second the tournament is running.  <br>
The night before US Nationals, I easily stayed up until 3:30 AM in <br>
preparation for the tournament in which I was awake at 7 AM setting up.<br>
<br>
Getting together a judge&#x27;s meeting to listen to the volume of a discman <br>
is a lot of effort and I guarantee that it won&#x27;t happen.  Until people <br>
start getting paid to be judges, it&#x27;s not going to be happen.<br>
<br>
With that all said, I&#x27;d like to clarify that I&#x27;m not ruling out the <br>
idea of a discman.  You would like a cd player so you could listen to <br>
music and just be more comfortable?  Is there anything more to the cd <br>
player than just comfort?  (And comfort could just be fine.)<br>

As the cuber is taking on the &#x27;privelage&#x27; of wearing a
headphones/listening to music, they must also take on
the responsibility that follows.  This includes being
alert of the judges commands.  Very similiar to this
is an example.  Perhaps someone will find relevance. 
When I took my driving test an old woman was assigned
to put me to the road test.  When we were both buckled
up in the car, she told me I could listen to the radio
if it felt more comfortable, but if it was too loud to
hear her instructions, and I missed something, I would
simply fail.

It is should indeed be the competitor&#x27;s
responsibility.  Once again, being entitled to the
privelage, the competitor must take on the
responsibility.


>Does the penalty follow? 

Of course.

Not at all.  All the same rules should apply.

Now that these questions can be answered, I think
people will keep their headphones at a reasonable
volume to ensure they don&#x27;t miss something themselves.

Well, if that were true you&#x27;d not go to 14, 13 etc. you&#x27;d stay at 15 
first. (0 comes next.) I don&#x27;t buy this argument though (who try&#x27;s to 
break 33 or 46 etc. - or more to the point who jumps down from 46 to 
33 - that&#x27;s a big leap). I think your sequence can be explained more 
easily by the fact that they are all multiples of 5 except for 17 and 
17 is a famous benchmark time in speed-cubing because in the most 
widely used system (Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s) the statement right at the 
start is that with the system it&#x27;s possible to solve the cube in 17 
seconds. Except for that the sequence is just multiples of 5 which 
seems a fairly natural system to use for people using base 10 (not 
all people do, maybe others would have a different set of benchmarks).
I imagine a 30 second (half minute) barrier would likely be more of a 
target than a 33 second barrier.

          <div class="email-content">I see no reason why the rules even for an international orginazation 
have to be strict. I say let the competitors do whatever they want 
as long as it is not cheating or distracting/offensive to another 
competitor. It is my belief that rules should be as fundamental as 
possible. What a competitor chooses to do is entirely their 
responsibility and there is no need for judges/organizers to make 
changes for them. To reiterate a quote I like that Jonas posted 
earlier: &quot;perfection of design is not when there is nothing more to 
add, by when there is nothing more to remove&quot;

          <div class="email-content">I guess I feel more conservative about this in that I don&#x27;t agree 
with allowing headphones, however I have gotten very fast averages 
while listening to music before.

I know that the official poker World Championships (televised on 
ESPN late at night alllllll the time) allow headphones.  Half the 
people think it is a good idea, and half don&#x27;t.

Personally about 90% of the time music only helps to hurt my 
concentration and get me slower times.  Sometimes though a song fits 
with my pacing at the time and I am able to find a steady rhythm 
that follows the song.

However, since 90% of the time I prefer no music, I would not be too 
happy in a competition if I heard the music from someone&#x27;s 
headphones bleeding through.

This could be solved with those headphones that cup all the way 
around your ears, but then again that costs money which is a whole 
separate issue.

I know that most of the people who are in favor of headphones would 
be respectful and keep their volume down, but what about people who 
are at their first competition, and find out that headphones are 
allowed?  As long as we have a VERY strict definition of what 
constitutes too loud for headphones, then I personally would have no 
qualms with headphones.  My suggestion would be, music is too loud 
if it can be heard at all (even if quietly) by the judge, who is the 
closet person to the competitor at the time, or something similar.

Well, if that were true you&#x27;d not go to 14, 13 etc. you&#x27;d stay at 15 
first. (0 comes next.) I don&#x27;t buy this argument though (who try&#x27;s to 
break 33 or 46 etc. - or more to the point who jumps down from 46 to 
33 - that&#x27;s a big leap). I think your sequence can be explained more 
easily by the fact that they are all multiples of 5 except for 17 and 
17 is a famous benchmark time in speed-cubing because in the most 
widely used system (Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s) the statement right at the 
start is that with the system it&#x27;s possible to solve the cube in 17 
seconds. Except for that the sequence is just multiples of 5 which 
seems a fairly natural system to use for people using base 10 (not 
all people do, maybe others would have a different set of benchmarks).
I imagine a 30 second (half minute) barrier would likely be more of a 
target than a 33 second barrier.

I see no reason whatsoever to allow headphones/music in 
competitions. Because it can disturb other competitors. The 
competitor might miss instructions from judges or others. It can 
theoretically be used for cheating. Who can control it&#x27;s only music 
the competitor listens to and not &quot;cubing instructions&quot; ?? I would

I see no reason to disallow headphones/music

I agree it *can* disturb other competitors and if it does, that 
person should have to turn to the volume down or take them off.
A more appropriate rule would be: no disturbing other competitors.

> The

That&#x27;s their problem. It&#x27;s their choice to listen to music, it&#x27;s 
therir responsibility to listen to instructions and no one elses.

I agree. Once again, a more appropriate rule would be: no cheating
(which I assume would already be a rule)
And realistically, there is no good way to cheat for speedcubing.

> I would

Do you at least understand where I&#x27;m coming from? I think we have no 
right and reason to tell somebody what to do as long as it&#x27;s not 
cheating or distracting.

Some people think I look silly without shoes but that doesn&#x27;t stop 
me :)

And on a personal note, I rarely wear headphones (especially in 
public). I like to have all my senses unobstructed and would 
probably never wear headphones in competition.

Hey!

I see no reason whatsoever to allow headphones/music in 
competitions. Because it can disturb other competitors. The 
competitor might miss instructions from judges or others. It can 
theoretically be used for cheating. Who can control it&#x27;s only music 
the competitor listens to and not &quot;cubing instructions&quot; ?? I would 
be sad to see this allowed :-( And personally i think it would look 
dead silly if a competitor used headphones ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Everyone has presented issues against wearing
headphones.  Here are some concerns:

* Distraction- If the volume is too loud it could
distract other competitors.  

solution-The volume may not exceed that of a whisper. 
If the judge thinks he/she is exceeding this point
then the the competitor will be asked to remove the
headphones.  

^And if everyone is going to be so finicky about
distractions, I would ask that no one talks on stage
during my solve.  I actually find talking very
distracting.

*Image-  Why does everyone care if it looks &#x27;silly&#x27; or
unprofessional.  I had a friend that had blue hair at
RWC 03&#x27;.  This was not professional at all, and in my
opinion, looked quite silly.  Still he was allowed to
compete.  If we have to set standards for how people
&#x27;appear&#x27; on stage this is not fair _AT_ALL_!

*Cheating- Everyone against the headphones are
clinging on to this idea, as if it&#x27;s actually
reaslistic.  

I think we should create an environment where people
are most comfortable, and in doing this, everyone will
do better.  If someone wants to listen to headphones
and sit down while doing 5x5, and they are most
comfortable doing this, I think it should be fine.  We
should stop being so concerned about how people look
on stage, and start thinking about how we can help
people perform better on stage.  And comfort does
help.

And now that I think about it, appearance shouldn&#x27;t
hold a case against this anyway.  That point is
invalid.  The cheating point is what is silly.  And
the distraction thing is easily solved.

          <div class="email-content">Howdy all,<br>
<br>
A lot of people would agree that listening to music can make some<br>
things easier, or just help you relax. I think that music is great<br>
when I&#x27;m taking a run outside, and it sometimes accompanies my best<br>
cubing averages. I also find that sitting next to the fan in my room<br>
sometimes helps me achieved better times as well, because it gets so<br>
humid in Washington. Sometimes I even walk around the room while<br>
solving to stretch my legs...<br>
<br>
My point is, if we are to allow competitors to do what ever they want<br>
to &#x27;be comfortable&#x27;, where do we draw the line? Is it fair to allow<br>
one person to listen to music, and not allow another to sit next to<br>
their mom (or something weird like that). People do lots of things to<br>
be more comfortable. I know that listening to music while competing in<br>
any other official setting is usually not encouraged, so I don&#x27;t think<br>
it should be here. I would have LOVED to listen to music while running<br>
the 3200 meter race in track. It just doesn&#x27;t seem professional.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents. Please don&#x27;t harass me ;)<br>

          <div class="email-content">With regards to headphones in a competition I tend to agree with 
some others here. As long as it cannot be heard by others on stage 
at the time then we should allow it. As was stated before, 
headphones were allowed in the World Poker Tour, and they play for 
ALOT!!!!! more money then we ever will.

I think we should do anything within reason to make ourselves  
comfortable to acheive our best times. I would abide by a judges 
decision in this matter. As long as gudielines were set out before 
the event started and agreed upon by all contestants.

          <div class="email-content">Hmm..  Ok..  Here are my opinions on the following...

Headphones:  I don&#x27;t feel that they should be allowed.  Or earplugs 
for that matter. I think that anything used to tune out pressure, 
noise, or whatever should not be allowed..  Listening to music is 
something we do while practicing, not competing.  I don&#x27;t think that 
competitions should be structured around making 
competetors &quot;comfortable&quot;. 

Sitting/Standing:  Hmm..  I think that we should all have to stand, 
maybe because that is how it has been in both previous world 
championships.  However, maybe it would be ok if a competetor 
starting the competition either standing or sitting and stuck with 
his/her choice throughout the rest of his/her solves.  Hmm..  not 
sure it that makes much of a difference, but like I have said, I 
don&#x27;t think that competitions should be comfortable..  after all, we 
are testing our skills.  let&#x27;s face it..  your competition times 
show how good you really are.  Shouldn&#x27;t those times be achieved 
without crutches?

&gt;without crutches?<br>
&gt;  <br>
&gt;<br>
I don&#x27;t see how a chair can act as a &quot;crutch&quot; for your times.  I agree <br>
that these competitions do show your skills in whatever area you&#x27;re <br>
competing.  If you can average 3:40 on the 5x5x5 while sitting down, but <br>
can&#x27;t break 4:00 standing up (as unlikely as it may seem), then does <br>
that mean that in competitions, your 3:40 average time shouldnt matter, <br>
and that as far as the competition is concerned, you average 4 minutes?  <br>
I didn&#x27;t compete in the 5x5x5 category at the US Nationals, but my times <br>
on the 4x4x4 were nothing out of the ordinary for me.  So I can see that <br>
if sitting down during a 4x4x4 solve (I normally stand, btw) yielded <br>
1:30 solves on average, sitting down would have helped a lot.<br>
<br>
If you&#x27;re consistantly faster while sitting down, and you allways sit <br>
down while you practice, then doesn&#x27;t sitting down during a competition <br>
yield a more accurate representation of your skills?  Same for if you <br>
stand up.  What if one of the competitors is handicapped and depends on <br>
a wheel chair?  Does he get to sit (considering he may not be physically <br>
able to stand) while all others have to stand?  I agree that there needs <br>
to be a line drawn, I don&#x27;t expect Tyson Mao to come to my house and <br>
time me while I sit at my desk, in my chair, behind my computer, <br>
listening to my music. But with all silliness aside, not allowing chairs <br>
is a bit... as it was said before, anal. <br>
<br>
Plus, I remember a few competitors sitting down at the US Nationals <br>
during their solves.  I thought the competition ran very smoothly, and I <br>
felt no need to complain about the chairs.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m sure almost all of what I write now has been written before, but 
I share my 2 swedish öre anyway.

-Music: Not to be allowed-
Most of us agree that music can be a distraction if too loud. 
Defining what is too loud is a subjective matter and puts extra 
responsibilities on the judge and might give rise to objections 
afterwards. I also think that nerves is part of the competition. 
When defining official rulesets I&#x27;m afraid one must be very strict 
about what is allowed and what is not. Have a loose set of rules 
will leave room for loopholes and a fairly non-standardized 
competition.

-Sitting: To be allowed?-
Some competitors might have problems standing due to injuries and 
such and therefor it might be fair to allow sitting for all 
contestants. I would prefer if standing was the standard though but 
contestants would be allowed to sit if they wish so during their 
registration or if physical problems arise during the competition

          <div class="email-content">First of all, let me say I think this discussion has grown way out of 
proportions. In any case we can never account for every single thing 
people may do to make themselves feel more comfortable, in a rulebook 
anyway. In the very end it will always be the tournament comittee that 
has the final say. All rules we can make on the issues will be very 
generalized at best, and it will always be up to a local authority at 
every tournament what conforms to the rules and what doesn&#x27;t.

Headphones running at a reasonable volume will be dwarved by spectator 
noise anyway. There&#x27;s a hundred people in the room chatting, 20-30 
other cubes spinning, people walking in and out and even the 
conferansiér making announcements here and there. And we&#x27;re supposed 
to be complaining only when someone brings a teensy bit of music onto 
stage?

Naturally, we can&#x27;t allow participants to turn the tournament into a 
nightclub, but really, the general noise level is way too high for 
_reasonably_ volumed headphones to make any difference!

A much better way of solving the issue rather than typing down 1000 
paragraphs for every single distraction you can come up with would be 
to put down a rule saying &quot;Don&#x27;t distract participants on stage.&quot; This 
boils down to subjective rulings made by the local comittee, of 
course, but as I said before, that&#x27;s inevitable. We&#x27;re going to have 
the comittee making decisions as to what is reasonable volume, or what 
is reasonable distraction. Doesn&#x27;t matter, we&#x27;ll never escape that 
anyway.

          <div class="email-content">well actually,  I don&#x27;t think that there should even be a two second penalty if the cube is one turn or 45 degrees, or whatever from being solved.  The cube is either solved or it isn&#x27;t, yeah?

          <div class="email-content">I want to give my 2 cents on this issue too, because it looks like it&#x27;s gettin an important debate. <br>
-Standing/sitting: I think both should be allowed, not because of feeling comfortable or anything like that, it&#x27;s just that certain persons are too tall or too small to stand or sit. Lemme explain. I am 1.9m tall, that&#x27;s about 6 feet 3 inches if I&#x27;m haven&#x27;t made any mistake (why don&#x27;t you just use the metric system over there? but that&#x27;s another debate), but my arms just can&#x27;t reach down to the table, so I have to lean forwards to reach the dots with the full hand. so even if I don&#x27;t like sitting in competitions (it makes me feel nervous, I have no way to move while waiting for my cube for example to evacuate the pressure), if the table is tto low, I&#x27;m going to loose a lot of time to grab my cube, and put it down. A solution would be for me to stay leaned forwrd during the whole solve, but it&#x27;s too bad for my back, and my times would still be slower. So I think, if there is one reason for letting someone ether sit or stand, that&#x27;s because some people just can&#x27;t reach the table,<br>
 because they are too small (even if it&#x27;s maybe a bad example, because I have never seen her in action, how does Wiktoria Zborowska feel about this?) or too tall, and if we give them the choice, everybody must have the choice. I first noticed it during the French Champs, where everybody had to sit, (or at least no one thought of standing, since we had chairs behind the tables) but the tables were way too low anyway. Another solution is to have adjustable tables, where you can have them as high/low as you wish, and in that case, I would say everybody stands. And, come, everybody can stand for 10 minutes. Unless you are in a rolling chair or broke your leg. <br>
-Music: I&#x27;m a musician so I might not be the right example for this, because music is my life, so I am always listening to music. However, I am aware that listening to music isn&#x27;t always best for one&#x27;s concentration, not speaking of the others. It helps me, but it is not best for most people to listen to music while trying to get the best out of their concentration. Anyway, I would rather be for a rule like, no music in the stage area, turn off your CD players when you step on the stage. It helps you relax, but staying on stage for too long isn&#x27;t the best way to relax though. So you can turn on you CD player whenever you leave the stage, and I would say, don&#x27;t stay on stage for too long or it will kill your nerves anyway, w/ music or w/o music. Did you ever watch a swimming competition? I noticed that some of the competitors walk to their chair with headphones on, but once the speaker calls their name, they turn the music off and put the headphones down, and then fully concentrate on<br>
 their swimming. That&#x27;s kind of the thing I think is best. you can relax for as long as possible, but at a certain point you have to switch your brain to &quot;full concentration&quot;. And, to give you an example I know well, as a musician I have many concerts, especially I had a recital earlier this year with a pianist, and I remember my old teacher came to us and started to tell jokes, and we were really relaxed. But suddenly he said, &quot;now, you have to focus.&quot; and he gave us concentration techniques, so we were really concentrate when we came on stage. The only problem was that the piano was out of tune. Like, really. But we were focused on our thing, and it worked fine.<br>
So. The point is following. I would say, no headphones on stage, you have to try to get rid of the noise by yourself, and I&#x27;m not sure is relaxing is the best way of forgetting the noise outside. Focusing is the solution. Of course, I would love to have a silent room like in chess championships... don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible.<br>
Just my (long) 2 cents. Ok, say it was rather 3 1/2 cents.<br>

          <div class="email-content">nevermind, I didn&#x27;t know there were 3 different heights available. It&#x27;s fine then. So I think everybody should stand then, since there is no excuse other than a broken leg to sit, and feeling comfortable is not an argument in official competitions.

          <div class="email-content">I have pretty much the same experience as you, though I&#x27;m not quite 
as tall as you are.  I also have to hunch over the table and timer 
if I stand up straight.

One thing I found that helps a lot in a competition is to change 
your stance.  I&#x27;ve found that for cup stacking you have to be really 
close to the table in order to stack well, and this means that 
almost any table is too short.  What I do is to spread my legs out 
to the side, so that I can still keep my torso upright and be in 
somewhat of an upright position.  This works well for cubing too, 
since it lets you still be close enough to the table to put the cube 
back down quickly.

Some of the people at the US competition kept asking me why I was 
standing so weird at the timer, but actually I&#x27;ve gotten used to it 
from cup stacking and I find it to be more comfortable than hunching 
over.  It lets you still stand upright, but also be at the level of 
the table at the same time.

Just my two cents,
Chris

that&#x27;s another debate), but my arms just can&#x27;t reach down to the

going to loose a lot of time to grab my cube, and put it down. A 
solution would be for me to stay leaned forwrd during the whole

Among other things I am an accountant and accounting regulators have found
that specifying every little thing just leads to &quot;smarter&quot; ways to get round
the rules (I think I should say &quot;stupider&quot; here!).  Increasingly regulators,
including the International Accounting Standards Board, are moving to
broader statements and the overriding principle that people should stay
within the spirit of those statements.  This way you dont have to have huge
rule books and if the general consensus is that someone has done something
they shouldn&#x27;t then you haev the flexibility to treat it accordingly.

Actually there have been several examples of over-restrictive rules in the
olympics where the governing bodies have been forced to rule against
competitors or change their minds about rulings because of technicalities.
If you don&#x27;t have books full of technicalities then this embarassment
doesn&#x27;t happen.

As has been said before - keep it simple, don&#x27;t overanalyse.  If competitors
have an issue they should raise it with the organiser before they compete
and both competitor and organiser should be as co-operative as possible in
ensuring that people get to compete as comfortably as possible without
getting an unfair advantage.

First of all, let me say I think this discussion has grown way out of
proportions. In any case we can never account for every single thing
people may do to make themselves feel more comfortable, in a rulebook
anyway. In the very end it will always be the tournament comittee that
has the final say. All rules we can make on the issues will be very
generalized at best, and it will always be up to a local authority at
every tournament what conforms to the rules and what doesn&#x27;t.

Headphones running at a reasonable volume will be dwarved by spectator
noise anyway. There&#x27;s a hundred people in the room chatting, 20-30
other cubes spinning, people walking in and out and even the
conferansiï¿½r making announcements here and there. And we&#x27;re supposed
to be complaining only when someone brings a teensy bit of music onto
stage?

Naturally, we can&#x27;t allow participants to turn the tournament into a
nightclub, but really, the general noise level is way too high for
_reasonably_ volumed headphones to make any difference!

A much better way of solving the issue rather than typing down 1000
paragraphs for every single distraction you can come up with would be
to put down a rule saying &quot;Don&#x27;t distract participants on stage.&quot; This
boils down to subjective rulings made by the local comittee, of
course, but as I said before, that&#x27;s inevitable. We&#x27;re going to have
the comittee making decisions as to what is reasonable volume, or what
is reasonable distraction. Doesn&#x27;t matter, we&#x27;ll never escape that
anyway.

you should be allowed to anything thatll 
help you cube at you best ,as long as it isnt considered cheating(duh)
if i solve better sitting down, then 
i would think i should be aloowed to site down, if standingup is my 
thing than i should be allowed to do that.if a certainsong i know 
helps me solve quicker than i should be allowed to listen to it. if i 
want none of it than i would want none. my only argument would be 
that teh music would have to be at a low volume to where anyone not 
listening to it within a certain distance of the competitor should 
not be ableto hear it.

Thank you, I totally agree. As I&#x27;ve said before, keep the rules as 
fundamental as possible.

As far as sitting/standing is concerned, I really don&#x27;t care what 
someone does - sit, stand, kneel, lay down, stand on their head for 
all I care. Why be so authoritarian?

I seem to be outnumbered on these issues... but whatever happens 
I&#x27;ll still compete - it&#x27;s not a big deal. This whole debate is no 
big deal. I think if someone wore headphones and this discussion 
never took place, no one would give it a second thought(as what 
happened at the US champs, right?) and that&#x27;s the way it should be.

          <div class="email-content">The final time is not the time it takes to solve the cube - it is 
the time it takes to remover your hands from the pads, pick up the 
cube, solve it, realize it&#x27;s solved, put it back down, and return 
both hands to the pads. But of course, the judges aren&#x27;t going to 
use video analysis to time every solve and they can&#x27;t for some 
solves and not for others so having to stop the timer becomes part 
of the sport. So I think it is perfecty fair to hold the cuber 
responsible for stopping the timer. It just has to be understood 
that the time it takes to solve a cube and your official competition 
time are 2 seperate things and can&#x27;t be fairly compared to eachother.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, right, you&#x27;re absolutely right!  I meant layer then.  I guess that face
means right colour but not necessarily right position.
I didn&#x27;t use the word &quot;layer&quot; because I was thinking it is ambiguous in that
the middle layer of a layer by layer method is quite different from the
other two layers!  However its much more accurate than face!
Thanks for pointing out my misunderstanding.

I have the original professor cube (Wahn) from 1983(?). It also has

I&#x27;m talking about...  Somebody&#x27;s who&#x27;s memorized all the algs may 
have better input on the feasibility.

My first instinct in looking at the 1-look LL is that it almost seems 
too much for a human to handle efficiently.  Like Tyson said, more 
algorithms require a longer recognition time to say nothing about 
doing a U or U&#x27; to find the matching orientation.  The only benefit 
would be to reduce the number of turns (say 8-12) and I&#x27;m not sure 
that would outweight the reflex of even a 3 look LL.  
The other problem is how would you practice?  If you had 1200 algs to 
learn proficiently, you would have to solve so many cubes to be able 
to be able to commit them to muscle memory.  Even a 2 look can get 
tricky at high speeds and there&#x27;s only like 50.  

Anyone ever tried to learn those and attempt a 1-look LL?

Why doesn&#x27;t he regularly hit times of under 12 seconds say (allowing 
a generous 50% tolerance)?

As for the other bit, technically you can recognize the complete LL 
just by looking at 3 sides.

 vvv
yxxxw
yxxxw
yxxxw
 zzz

(e.g. you could look at x,y,z only (from that particular corner so 
no need to rotate the cube) and that would be sufficient to deduce 
v,w. It doesn&#x27;t matter which of the 4 corners you choose to base 
from. With commitment I can&#x27;t see why that couldn&#x27;t be done for a 
recognition similar to OLL. After all, if there&#x27;s someone who can 
memorize pi to 42,000 places then why not this? Of course, there&#x27;s 
always the question of whether one should waste all the time to do 
so and in this respect it is much more difficult to justifiably say 
yes.

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,

There are a couple of things I would like to add:

* First: A lot of those 1211 algorithms have mirrors and inverses that 
you also need to recognize and learn an algorithm for. There are 3915 
_cases_ you would have to learn if you want to learn the last layer in 
one. That makes the ZB system so ingenious, because flipping the LL 
edges before you get to the LL means you only need to learn 493 last 
layer cases. That&#x27;s a reduction by a factor of 8. By making the final 
F2L pair a bit more complicated (305 cases instead of 41 cases), you 
make the LL a lot easier. It&#x27;s a perfect example of how to &quot;spread the 
work&quot; over the various steps of your solution. It makes learning a 
complete last-layer-in-one completely unnecessary.

* Second (regarding Tyson&#x27;s remark on recognition): Recognizing ALL 
3915 cases wouldn&#x27;t be that more difficult than recognizing the 493 ZB 
last layer cases. The only difference is that the edges can also be 
flipped in 8 ways with last-layer-in-one, but that doesn&#x27;t make the 
recognition task a lot more complicated. You can still see the same 
thing as with the ZB-last-layer. In fact, if the UL or the UB edge is 
flipped incorrectly, you can actually see more than when they are 
flipped correctly. So if you master the ZB recognition system, 
recognizing all possible last layer cases isn&#x27;t a problem. I&#x27;m now 
practicing the COLL and ZB recognition systems a lot, and I can tell 
you it&#x27;s very feasible.

Cheers,
LarsV

Suppose you put in a first layer corner with the the cross.  Then you only
need 8 algorithms to to flip the LL edges while putting in the last middle

          <div class="email-content">You&#x27;re right! There are a lot of &quot;smart&quot; ways to flip the edges during 
the first two layers. Dan Harris and I came up with the VH system that 
does a similar thing:

http://lars.studentenweb.org/cube/vh/

When solving the last pair you just prepare the final corner and edge 
so that you get to one of the 2 trivial cases (this takes 3-4 moves) 
and then you learn algorithms that flip the edges from that point (8 
for each case). Since about 95% of the cases can be solved that way, 
that&#x27;s also a good way of flipping the edges without learning all 305 
cases yet.

However, none of these methods will be as good as the full ZB system. 
I&#x27;ve been working out a lot of &quot;smart&quot; ways of flipping the edges and 
all of them require at least 3 extra moves or a lot of thinking that 
makes them slower, whereas with ZB the move count is virtually the 
same for the first two layers.

   Then you get into the issue that what may bother
One competitor may not bother another and the person
with the headphones would get to wear them for one
solve and not for another due to the people around
them.
   What if someone starts with no one around and in
the middle of that solve (assuming it is a slower
solver of course) someone with headphones comes in and
that first solver is disturbed - how do you handle
that, is the first solver allowed a do over due to the
interuption of hearing someones music?  
   Isn&#x27;t the purpose of competition to have it be
uniformed and the same for all people involved?  It
should be either all competitors are standing or
sitting (with exceptions of those with handicaps). Why
work around those the music would bother when you can
just have a no headphone rule?
   I agree that a competition isn&#x27;t a place for
comfort - if it were then we could all meet at
someones house or outside.  You are put on stage in
the spotlight to see how you can do under pressure. 
To see how you can solve with a stackmat with tons of
people watching you. 
    I know most of us can say we solve differently
with a stackmat than a stopwatch, or with people we
don&#x27;t know vs people we know around - but a
competition is supposed to the the same for all
competitors.  Just like the olympics - they are all
expected to use the same horse or rings, perform the
same amount of skills in a set amount of time, and
stick their landings.  They don&#x27;t get special rings or
longer times - basically they are pretty much uniform.


Just my two cents :)

  But again comfort isn&#x27;t the nature of competiton -
it isn&#x27;t supposed to be.  It is to see who can perform
the best when placed around the best of the event.
  If you have issues performing on stage, around large
numbers of people or during someone talking it isn&#x27;t
the goal of the people who put on the competition to
help you over come that.  
  I know a few people who freeze up a lot in front of
crowds - but to help themselves over come it they
intentionatly went out to put themselves in those
situations to get over that &quot;fear&quot; (ie solving at
halftime of a major sporting event, in front of
meetings at work).

Whats weird is that it was a rubiks.com cube and I bought my BOY

          <div class="email-content">Where did you find this. I need reliable source. Because : 

150 mph = 0.041666 miles second. Now in 1 second, the eye sees 30 
images.

thats 67.056 meters per second.

So every image the eye would see is distanced by 2 meters. 

Now lets see at what distance someone can read numbers written on 
tennis balls. I&#x27;m going to say 3 meters. The human line of sight is 
unknown to me, I&#x27;m going to give 160 degree. 
That means your sight range is : 17 meters. 

In your eye sight, the ball appears 8.5 times in front of your eye. 
In a space of between a third and a quarter of a second. 

Now, I&#x27;m not even going to take the chance to say that you need to 
focus to read (which means seen with depth acuity = 2 eyes) which 
would diminish the range. The letters have to face you (a ball must 
be rotating on itself). 

Now I&#x27;m not saying that doing this a few times over a immense ammount 
of trial is impossible. I&#x27;m just saying that I highly doubt someone 
can do it consistantly given the facts.

          <div class="email-content">A lot of you remind me of republicans.  Saying one
thing, and doing another.  Hypocrits, to say the
least.  We must be strict.  We must be uniform. No
music, no sitting, no singing.  This will make things
easier. Right...sure...

While at the same time, most of you have no issue
whatsoever against the way we are addressing the 2
second penalty.  Uniformity...as in, everyone should
solve their cubes?  I would appreciate this.  This
would be trult uniform, especially among people who
are competing just to do that, completely solve their
cubes.  We&#x27;ll talk strict but just see how much we can
let slide in the most important aspect of the race. 
You can completely miss your last turn, to any
extent(!) and still only recieve a 2 second penalty. 
But alas, we are not worried about this minor detail. 
What is more important is how we appear on stage. 
Let&#x27;s make sure we look professional.  That&#x27;s fine, or
better yet, lets fight with every last drop of energy
over whether headphones should be allowed at a
whisper, while the noise level of the crowd will never
be controlled.  Let us argue about standing also.  It
is a real shame that something in which the posture of
the person is not relevant, would hold so much
bearing.  And what message is that sending to people
who have no choice to sit down?  YOU ARE NOT BEING
PROFESSIONAL, YOU&#x27;RE APPEARANCE WOULD BE NEARLY
UNACCEPTABLE IF IT WEREN&#x27;T FOR YOUR CONDITION.  I
propose in the meantime that all competitors wear
neutral gray colors, cover up all tatoos, at not talk
on stage.  I feel this way, I would be less distracted
by my surroundings.  *And to the guy that has the
headphones out there that can drown out a crowd, can
you hook me up? Cuz mine just don&#x27;t do that.

          <div class="email-content">Alrighty folks. JNetCube is just about finished.<br>
<br>
The network version is now fully functional. All I have left to add is<br>
handicap support. There have been many changes to both the GUI and<br>
functionality of the timer. Instead of me listing changes here you can<br>
just download the timer and try it for yourself.<br>
<br>
On the standalone timer, I have added the ability to view what the<br>
scrambled cube should look like after applying the current scramble<br>
alg (currently only works for 3x3x3) and some other little changes.<br>
This can be shown in a seperate little window (in the tools menu).<br>
<br>
Planned updates/changes include:<br>
--&gt; Allow customized output for network timer<br>
--&gt; Allow setting of the colors on the &#x27;scramble view&#x27;<br>
--&gt; Show scramble view for all other cubes<br>
<br>
I would recommend that anyone currently using NetCube switch to<br>
JNetCube now...JNetCube&#x27;s network timer is much more reliable than<br>
NetCube. You can download in the files section of this group.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Did I say miles per hour? I must have ment kilometers per hour, cuz I
searched on google for something about it, and this was one of the
search results:

... Seeing a softball thrown at 65 mph from 43 ... officials turned to
Conditioned Ocular
Enhancement training, invented by ... said an air cannon flings a red
or black ... 

I tried clicking on it but it took me to some place different. Anyone
interested can look for more on it and how it can be used to get
faster cubers. I don&#x27;t think you can turn a face of the cube at 150
kph while going at 3 moves per second, so it should be possible.

Key words: softball, training, red, black, numbers, Conditioned Ocular
Enhancement, or any other words from the search result above.

I like Tyson&#x27;s idea about the PLL at 150 mph :) I should get an air
cannon soon. Maybe I can use it to learn the LL algs faster.

pairs, first orient all five remaining edges (so that U and R turns 
can solve them), then build/insert the last pair. That way you can 
also always do the last pair with a two-generator.

          <div class="email-content">&quot;Ok cunt&quot;?<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s try to keep our posts constructive, or at least halfway literate.  <br>
If you disagree with something posted here, then posting your reasons <br>
for disagreeing is much better than lashing out with profanity.  Sending <br>
a reply to previous comment (you could&#x27;ve at least pointed out the <br>
comment...) with &quot;Ok cunt&quot; in the subject line is not only a waste of <br>
keystrokes, it&#x27;s a waste of bandwith, and all in all, a waste of <br>
everyone else&#x27;s time.<br>
<br>
I am assuming that said remark was in response to one of the &quot;headphone&quot; <br>
emails.  As it has been stated MANY times before, the arena IS too loud <br>
for them to have much of an effect.  However, if someone wants to take <br>
headphones with them to use while cubing, then they can obviously hear <br>
whatever is being played on their walkman/cd player/whatever.  This is <br>
in a very, very loud environment, as stated before.  I know for a fact <br>
that if I turn my portable DiscMan up to 100% volume, it hurts the hell <br>
out of my ears.  I can&#x27;t stand it that loud.  By the same token, I have <br>
a lot of trouble believing that the same volume headphones would be <br>
audible to someone standing 3 feet away in the middle of a lot of very, <br>
very loud people. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yea, but it can&#x27;t be that much of a difference?&quot;<br>
<br>
Probably not.  But who knows?  No one person can tell how _everybody_ <br>
reacts to music while cubing.  Many of my best records when I was in the <br>
35-40s range were taken while listening to fast, hard rock. <br>
<br>
In the first round of the July 10 competition, the difference between my <br>
best time and the person right below me&#x27;s best time was less than a <br>
second.  In fact, way less than a second.  3/100 of a second, to be <br>
exact.  The top 24 went to the next round, and I was #6 then. <br>
<br>
But what if I was 24th?  If the person that placed 25th didn&#x27;t make the <br>
cut by .03s, and a little bit of music would have gotten him to cube <br>
closer to his fullest capacity, then more power to him!  I would have <br>
lost to a better cubist, fair and square.  I would not have been <br>
ecstatic, but fair is fair.  I would hope to have the same opportunity <br>
extended to me, whether music actually helps me or not. <br>

Sorry about that, I couldn&#x27;t help but draw a line from his post to the

Rubiks.com cubes around in a few toy stores here in Norway are BYO 
scheme. I don&#x27;t really know, but I think the ones you get directly 
from Rubiks.com are now BOY.

I _think_, but I&#x27;m not sure, that IDEAL and ARXON cubes are BYO. My 
old IDEAL one is BYO at least, and my 4x4 ARXON is also BYO.

I used the BYO scheme for quite some time, but I successfully changed 
to BOY after the European Champs (two weeks ago), and already 
yesterday I broke my old BYO average record. So it&#x27;s not impossible, 
and I found it quite a lot easier than I had imagined. So if you find 
the hustle of finding BYO cubes / restickering BOY ones too much, you 
can always just change...

          <div class="email-content">Hey Doug,

I just got an Alexander&#x27;s Star on Ebay, and I&#x27;m sorry
to say that as far as I can figure out, unless there
is already one piece out, it can&#x27;t be taken apart
without breaking the first piece. The one I got
already had one broken piece, so it was lucky I was
planning on lubing it.

I repaired the piece by placing a small thin piece of
plastic cut to the right size over the break like a
splint, and gluing with Krazy glue. This is a delicate
operation to say the least, as the broken section must
be held in the proper position for at least a minute.

To replace the final piece when re-assembling, one
must push the two rotating pyramids apart with
considerable force while sliding the final piece
gently in place. This also is certainly no picnic, and
I broke and then had to repair a couple more pieces
while trying to do it. If you do break a piece, I
would suggest taking out several pieces, putting in
the repaired one first, and saving a good piece for
the final one.

Also, several pieces broke while the star was fully
assembled, during turning. Either I got a star with
some defective pieces, or more likely, several of them
merely had stress fractures from previous jamming.
This is highly possible if the star was played with
much by someone else before I lubed it, because the
interior pieces on my star that kept breaking are just
too thin to begin with. Sadly, nothing can be done
about this.

On the plus side, now that I have (hopefully) fixed
all the weak pieces and the star is fully lubed, it is
about 10 times easier to turn than when I got it, and
I can make turns at a decent speed now.

Hope this helps!

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t even know what an Alexander Star is, but I can&#x27;t help 
thinking that it has to have been assembled at the factory in some 
less destructive way than described here.

Once you figure out what that way is/was, you can probably take it 
apart by reversing that last step.

That it unless the final step is something irreversible like gluing 
etc. But that just seems like a bad manufacturing process, so I doubt 
they&#x27;d do it that way.

The &#x27;Add Time&#x27; button is used to add a time recorded from outside the
timer (like with a stackmat for example). When you click the button,
you  are prompted to enter the time in seconds. After you press &#x27;ok&#x27;
the time is added into the timer&#x27;s database. You will see the time
added onto the rolling average display and you can view it in the
&#x27;Detailed&#x27; view. The time is added just as if you had achieved the
time with the built in timer.

I have heard of one other person having difficulty getting this button
to work. I checked the code and it seems to be correct and functions
fine on my PC (winXP), MacOSX (Tyson&#x27;s mac), and some linux boxes I
have lying around. I have tested it on Sun Java 1.4.2_05. If in doubt,
grab the latest Sun Java and try it out again.

Hey Chris,

I just installed the latest version of Sun Java, but that button is 
still not working... I really hope you can help me out, because this 
program is what I&#x27;ve been looking for since I recently recieved a 
Stackmat timer :).f

Same here, by the way... I just noticed that I can&#x27;t accept more

          <em>From:</em> &quot;Josef Jelinek&quot; &lt;gloom@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Tue, 24 Aug 2004 16:51:22 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
as far as I know there were no serious attempts<br>
to solve 4x4x4 using computer. I needed to find<br>
some sequences to solve specific configurations<br>
of 4x4x4, so I modified my ACube program and<br>
created a new program for 4x4x4.<br>
<br>
Warning: The following text is quite hard to read.<br>
<br>
However, I use only one phase (to search for<br>
optimal sequences) and I am lucky, that the<br>
required sequences were at most 12 turns long,<br>
so I found them. The depth 12 seems to be<br>
the ultimate limit on the current computers...<br>
Thus, the program is not aimed at solving<br>
arbitrary configuration, it should help<br>
finding short optimal sequences to be used in<br>
methods...<br>
<br>
So I have a question and discussion topic for<br>
people interested in computer cube algorithms:<br>
<br>
What cube parts can you suggest to store the<br>
entire cube state (I mean, for 3x3x3 you need<br>
e.g. corner perm., corner ori., edge ori, and<br>
three additional numbers storing edge perm.)<br>
What pruning tables would you use for 4x4x4?<br>
<br>
In the current state I use the following:<br>
<br>
to store the cube state I use numbers storing<br>
the following cube sub-configurations:<br>
 - 1x corner permutation (7! states)<br>
 - 1x corner orientation (3^6 states)<br>
 - 6x center positions (6x 23*22*21 states)<br>
 - 12x edge pair positions (12x 24*23 states)<br>
(one corner is fixed in its position, so the<br>
first two numbers are lower than for 3x3x3)<br>
(packing 2 edge pairs together requires too much<br>
space for transformation tables.)<br>
<br>
The pruning tables are rather simple and need to be<br>
improved but I have no idea how (ANY IDEA?).<br>
 - corner perm. x corner ori.<br>
 - 6x center pos. x corner ori.<br>
 - 6x edge pair pos. x opposite edge pair pos.<br>
The maximum pruming depth is 11 and it is too low<br>
number to be usable.<br>
<br>
the supported turns are all simple and slice turns<br>
imaginable and is 54 in total, so it gives quite a large<br>
branching ratio.<br>
To reduce the ammount of equal paths (L R ~ R L ~ L2 L&#x27; R...)<br>
I have used automatically generated finite automaton<br>
that consists of a big table storing states and transitions<br>
on a given turn. This seems to be really efficient and<br>
Im considering to use it in the clasic ACube too...<br>
<br>
I hope, somebody understood the mess before.<br>
<br>
Josef<br>
<br>
PS: I used the program to optimize sequences in <br>
the 4x4x4 method described by Marc Waterman<br>
in CFF 16 (?). and I have found several significant<br>
improvements...<br>

          <div class="email-content">There&#x27;s a relatively easy solution to the headphone issue - provide a
visual clue to the start of the competition.

In front of every competitor there could be a triple light set (could
actually be a single light ... but for sake of argument here) ...

Lights Red, Orange, Green are switched on consecutive second counts
matching the judges count 3-2-1-GO!

Competitors wearing headphones will be able to see the lights and
should be able to react as fast as those listening to the judges.

Fair, simple and easy.

This is the kinda challenge i like ;-)

Came up with a fairly short algorithm for the opposite-swap case. 
Still working on the adjacent swap. Here is the alg :

(U2u2)L2R2(D2d2)(R2U2D2)^2(r2E2)^2 (16 - HTM)

Change 10 stickers not 50 ;-)
I think this might possibly be improved...

u, d and r i hope u know. (they are next to U,D and R respectively)
E is the layer between u and d.

Happy cubing!!

          <div class="email-content">You can utilize the corner.  The basic idea to all F2L algorithms it that<br>
first part uses the corner where the piece belongs to set up the two<br>
pieces and then the last part brings them together and put them in.  If<br>
your edge piece is in a wrong slot, then there&#x27;s nothing wrong with using<br>
that slot to set up your pieces.<br>
<br>
Line up your corner with the edge like how you would normally do.  Then do<br>
your algorithm for all but the last 3 moves.  Let me know if you see what<br>
I mean.<br>
<br>
As for memorizing algorithms, just do them over and over again.  There&#x27;s<br>
no other way.  Unless you like to sing... &quot;six easy flips on the right<br>
hand side...&quot;<br>

&gt; for a 2x2x2 and the 3x3x3 cube? i need some help with that ;)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;i wanted to change this, (my final goal is only around 30-50 <br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;my question is kind of hard to explain, i want to know what you guys <br>
&gt;do when the corner you want to solve is already in the bottom layer <br>
&gt;(assuming you have the cross on the bottom), and the bottom color is <br>
&gt;not facing down..but the corresponding edge peice, is on the other <br>
&gt;side of the cube in the middle layer...<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;and the other instance i get confused is when the edge is already in <br>
&gt;the middle layer, but in the wrong corner.  do you just move it back <br>
&gt;to the top and fix the cross?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;and finally, how do you guys memorize the algorithms? just have a <br>

Wouldn&#x27;t you say that the small pruning depth is almost inevitable, 
given the relatively small table sizes and a large branching ratio 
(whatever it happens to be here)?  The b.r. affects not just the 
search, but also the distribution of pruning table entries w.r.t. 
depth. 

Of course, you could always extend the tables a bit: e.g., for those 
not involving corner positions,

>  - 6x center pos. x corner ori.
>  - 6x edge pair pos. x opposite edge pair pos.

you could include also the position of one one of the mobile corners, 
though this would be a bit artificial and unsymmetrical.  (If you had 
enough memory you could add similar tables based on each of the 
possible corners, and so restore the &quot;symmetry&quot;.)  But I wouldn&#x27;t 
expect increasing table sizes by small factors in that way to 
increase the pruning depth by very much.

Sorry, this isn&#x27;t being terribly helpful -- I guess you&#x27;ll have had 
similar thoughts anyway.

Mike

Yes I have these and some other variants.  This version is my L2L1 strategy.
I intend to put them (L2L1 up to L2L4) up somewhere next week when I am
getting a bit of free time.  I shall post to let the group know when I have
done it.

I now have all the moves for my L2L4 strategy which is a 0 look LL.  After
doing the first layer you put the four middle edges in one at a time doing
something constructive with the LL at the same time (orient corners,
position corners, orient edges, position edges).  Its great in theory but in
practice its no fewer moves than Fridrich :(.  fewer algorithms though!

          <div class="email-content">I am in almost the same boat as you yodude, I just started learning the f2l
alg recently, but instead of trying to learn them all I targeted certain
ones....
 
Doing it mostly intuitively is the way to go in my opinion, but I couldn&#x27;t
just do that.  I decided to look at a few of them, the ones where the corner
is properly placed already, but not oriented properly, and those are the
ones I learned. 
And by really watching how these work, you can adapt them to cover many
situations until you really know more than you think.
 
A great resource for learning how to do the f2l, and how to manipulate the
cube is Dan Harris&#x27; site.
 
cubestation.co.uk
 
He has java cubes there so you can watch how the algs work, this really
helped me a lot.
 
About 3 weeks ago I was solving in 70-75 seconds average (doing layer by
layer)
 
now I am down to 45-50 seconds for an average, and my F2L is in the 30-35
second range, 25 when I can recognize really well.
 
Hope this help...
 
PS I just popped my 2x2x2 anyone know how the middle  wedgies are placed? IE
some have a larger &quot;fin&quot; than the other wedgies.
 
 
Thanks much,
 
Andy

          <div class="email-content">Hey

I&#x27;ll try not to repeat what ohters have already told you.

When I started memorizing algoritms, I memorized them as symbol 
sequences. I praticed them without looking at the cube. That&#x27;s why I 
did not see the logic behind the moves. It&#x27;s very important that you 
look at the two pieces you are solving (when memorizing, I mean. 
Once you know all F2L cases, you have to look for other pieces while 
solving a F2L-pair). If you look at the pieces, you will see that 
most first two layer cases will end up (after 3 or 4 moves) being 
only 2 patterns (that both have mirrors). If you know how to solve 
those 2 patterns, you only have to memorize how to create that 
pattern.

You can try this website: cubestation.co.uk. The first two layers 
are illustrated with applets... Maybe you can try to do the setup 
moves, watch the applet solving the corner-edge pair, and then try 
to do that yourself.

Memorizing more complicated (last layer) algoritms, is a little 
harder, because it&#x27;s not possible to understand where all the pieces 
are going (in most cases). For those algorithms, I memorize them as 
sequences of &#x27;triggers&#x27;. For example: RU&#x27;R&#x27;U is one move for me, 
like Dan Knights says on his section about finger tricks. 
(http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#hints). 

If you have more questions, just ask... Or mail me if you like: 
joel_vn@....

Cya,

Joel.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

That&#x27;s another very nice way of doing it. You need to know only 5 
cases with an average of 7 moves:

L F&#x27; R&#x27; F2 R F L&#x27; (7) flips UF and UR
R U&#x27; R&#x27; L F R&#x27; F&#x27; R L&#x27;(9) flips UL and UR
R2 D R&#x27; U R L&#x27; B&#x27; L D&#x27; R2 (10) flips UF, UL, UB and UR
L F&#x27; L&#x27; U2 L F L&#x27; (7) flips FR, UF, UB and UR
F&#x27; U F U2 F&#x27; U&#x27; F (7) flips FR and UB

It makes the final pair very fast! Of course, one could also just 
solve the F2L and do the shortest OLL algorithm that flips the edges 
(average: 5.875 moves) but that wouldn&#x27;t make the last pair as easy as 
with this method. This could be the way to do it until I know more.

Thanks,
LarsV

          <div class="email-content">I think the best way to learn the algs is to make a practice sheet 
containing the inverse of the desired algs.  When you execute the 
inverse, you will be faced with the situation you want to solve.  
AFter you learn one, you can highlight it and go to the next one.  To 
do the inverse of the alg, read it right to left and also the face 
move should be in the opposite direction. R=R&#x27;, F=F&#x27;.  Good luck

so it sounds like i should be understanding whats happening in all <br>
the algs..<br>
<br>
i understand what you were saying to use the incorrect one and just <br>
not do the last steps..sounds good!<br>
<br>
as making an inverse sheet, that sounds like a good idea also.  i <br>
really would like to memorize the harder ones so i can do them <br>
without thinking about it..<br>
<br>
another thing i was wondering, what do you guys think is a <br>
reasonable time frame for learning and being able to do the F2L in <br>
say around 30 seconds..<br>

how long did it take you guys?<br>

But what if it happens - then what as a competitor do

   But at the same time it can be - I have seen
several of the sub 20&#x27;s people in practice - inspect a
cube and if it is set down wrong, moved or rotated
they lose what they were going to do because in your
head you were thinking R2, L&#x27; - etc...and now then all
the sudden you are thinking - What...

          <div class="email-content">Yes, exactly.  So you tell the judge that they made a mistake and move the
cube back to how you wanted it.

Notice, I wrote the words, &quot;If the act of telling the judge...&quot; and not
&quot;If the judge places the cube down wrong...&quot;

   Ok so the 2 second penalty.  What do you understand
the 2 second penalty to include?  I guess I am unclear
about what you don&#x27;t approve of.  
   I think everyone here agrees a 90 degree turn is
unsolved - even a 45 degree turn is unsolved.  Isn&#x27;t
the 2 second penalty for those solves that are less
than 45 degrees but more than 15/20 degrees?  (I am
unsure of the actual degree - but the point of where
the middle of the middle cube top layer is past the
corner).  
   I believe anything over that middle point is
unsolved - probably because the competitor was in a
hurry and didn&#x27;t actually make that last turn or two.

   I don&#x27;t really thing anyone is worried about how
they/others look on stage (I know there was something
about headphones being unprofessional) but again I
think it is the matter of comfort.  Crowds are part of
any competition - if people can&#x27;t compete with a crowd
learn to deal or don&#x27;t compete.

  Obviously there are circumstances for certain people
- no one would argue that - but again for those who
have the choice - standing vs sitting is a comfort
thing.

          <div class="email-content">Per&#x27;s algorithm can also be modified into
R2F2R2-F2s-R2F2L2 (affects U and D faces instead of F
and B). Which one you like better is just personal
preference. If you want something a little longer but
simpler, try (F2R2-B2L2)^3 or (F2R2)^3-(B2L2)^3. For a
completely different approach (my favorite), try
UD-M2-U&#x27;D-M2D2.

To switch stickers on adjacent sides of the 3x3x3 is a
trickier proposition. I will give two methods, one
requiring 14 stickers to be peeled, and another
requiring only 10, but with a little
disassembly/reassembly involved.

Both methods start thus:

1. Choose the two sides you want to switch (example:
to switch from the original color scheme to the new,
switch green and white) and make them the U and F
faces.

2. Perform this algorithm: U2 R F2 U2 F2 R2 U2 F2 U2 R
U2

At this point, you can just remove the 7 remaining
stickers from the U and F faces and switch them.
Preferable, however, is to move some of the pieces
manually.

3. Remove the UF edge, and switch the UFR and UFL
corners, orienting them so that UFR&#x27;s R facelet
becomes UFL&#x27;s L facelet, and vice versa. Now flip the
UF edge over and replace it. To explain more visually,
just picture removing the entire 3-piece row on the UF
edge as a whole, flipping it over, and replacing it.
This involves the edge flip parity and the permutation
parity, which can both be done with the normal moves
on the 4x4x4, but not on the 3x3x3.

4. Now there are only 4 stickers each on the U and F
faces to switch, and the 2 opposite stickers on the
UFR and UFL corners must also be switched.

Have fun!

As of right now, 180 degrees margin of error is
accepted with 2 second penalty.  Which means your last
turn can be completely missed.  Whether the cube be U,
U&#x27;, or U2, the competitor will still just get a 2
second penalty.  The most I believe should be
compromised is =&lt;45 degrees is solved, >45 and =&lt;90
should be 2 second penalty, and >90 is DNF.

I don&#x27;t really care about the crowds.  I am only

Indeed.  That&#x27;s not what is being put into question. 
What&#x27;s being put into question is whether or not we
should disregard comfort entirely for the sake of
professionalism.  If we are going to be so strict lets
take a better look at the guidelines for the 2 second
penalty which I mentioned earlier.  You guys can&#x27;t
fight for a strict enivronment and let a half turn go
with 2 second penalty.  You can&#x27;t have your cake and
eat it too.  but whatever...hindsight is 20/20.

That&#x27;s what I was planning on doing, before I

I couldn&#x27;t see how the caps were attached, even with
all the pieces off, but that seems a lot more likely
than just glue.

          <div class="email-content">I have used this method for a few years now, though I have always done
this edge orienting step intuitively - Use R+U to put a flipped edge
at FR if there isn&#x27;t one already. Then use F+U to replace it with
another flipped one.

I never flip the FR edge last if I can avoid it, so that it will end
up on the top layer. Also during the last flip, bad cases for the
corner edge pair can often be avoided by turning the U face before you
put the last flipped edge at FR.

Sometimes you get to a position where the last corner/edge pair is
paired up in the top layer but flipped. In that case put the other
flipped edge at FR without breaking them up (using R+U), and use F+U
to insert the pair. Also, the 4 flip case can be avoided if the FR
piece is in the top layer, just by redefining the flip, doing
everything in mirror image.

I never looked for shorter sequences (I&#x27;m not really a speedcuber at
40+ seconds average), but I will definitely try to use these now, as
mostly they are a lot better.

Very nice.

My intuitive method would give R U2 R&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F (6).

Hmm, using the L face too. That&#x27;ll take some getting used to, but it
looks like it is definitely worth it.

Same as me.

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t really know about my F2L times, but I got under 40 seconds 
two months after I started cubing, and I think my last layer took 
longer than 10 seconds (I had a 4 look last layer there). I guess 
learning to do F2L in 30 seconds will take you less then two months. 
It also depends on your motivation, and how much time you are 
willing to spend cubing, offcourse.

There is another site you could take a good look at, by the way. 
Remember I told you in my first post I memorize algoritms are 
sequences of &#x27;triggers&#x27;? Maybe you could take a look at 
http://my.fit.edu/~dchristi/cube/, and the part about the first two 
layers. I don&#x27;t know if his algorithms are very good, but the idea 
about learing the algorithms as &#x27;triggers&#x27; is very nice. Take a look 
at his videos that illustrate how to use your fingers to do the 
moves. (Because you are just starting, I don&#x27;t know how stiff you 
cube is... Some finger-tricks may be hard to perform on stiff cubes)


Good luck,

Joel.

&gt; http://my.fit.edu/~dchristi/cube/, and the part about the first two <br>

<br>
These are the exact algs I use for solving the f2l. I learned his algs<br>
in January. I average about 14 seconds on the f2l and 24 seconds for<br>
the whole cube (still 3 look LL). The algs are optimized for triggers<br>
rather then length. I learned Nathan&#x27;s algs becuase they were the<br>
first set of algs I stumbled on when I was learning the f2l.<br>

Don&#x27;t ever put commas after an URL. Especially not here. :)

The site looks interesting, thanks for pointing it out, I have never 
seen it before, nor seen any links to it.

And... 924 moves in a minute. Wow. o_O

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I use solving the first layer as the first step of<br>
Waterman&#x27;s method and from my experience<br>
there are two comparable efficient methods to solve<br>
the first face:<br>
 - variation to Lars&#x27;s or Gilles&#x27;s method<br>
   (block 1x2x3 + 2 corners + 1 edge)<br>
 - 4 corners + 4 edges<br>
If you have enough time, you can use intuition and<br>
search for possibilities thoroughly and combine these<br>
two methods... then number of necessary moves<br>
can vary from 10 to 15 (my experience).<br>
However, to solve the first face fast, you cannot<br>
think too much and average number of moves is<br>
15-18 (again, just my experience).<br>
Using the second method, the moves include slice ones(!).<br>
(this way to solve the first face is quite complete<br>
on http://rubikscube.info )<br>
I am not sure about other methods for first face,<br>
but e.g. for working corner F2L, the efficient method<br>
is 2x2x1 block + 2 CE pairs (of the first face)<br>
(or 3x2x1 block + 1 CE pair). It seems that without<br>
the last corner you can save surprisingly many turns...<br>
<br>
Another thing that is worth a note is, that in e.g. ZB method<br>
solving the F2L without one CE pair should take about<br>
18 moves, which is incredibly good comparing to the number<br>
of moves for the first layer (it is first layer -1 corner +3<br>
edges..).<br>

You could also use R&#x27; F R F&#x27; followed by y or y&#x27; (that&#x27;s probably what <br>
Jaap meant with mirroring). Argh, now I&#x27;m getting confused. It works <br>
if you take a solved cube, apply your five moves and then my four+y. <br>
Then all are oriented. It doesn&#x27;t work if I just flip the four edges <br>
and apply my moves. But neither does yours. So, the rule is: they work <br>
iff the edge that belongs into FR stays in the U layer.<br>
<br>

<br>
Also try this one (M turns same direction as R):<br>
D2 (M&#x27; y M&#x27; D M y&#x27; D2 M) D&#x27;<br>
If you follow the UF and UR edges than it&#x27;s very easy to learn. This <br>
is how I used to swap them back when I did pure layer-by-layer. Of <br>
course without the D-turns at start and end.<br>
<br>
&gt; 3. Remove the UF edge, and switch the UFR and UFL<br>
&gt; corners, orienting them so that UFR&#x27;s R facelet<br>
&gt; becomes UFL&#x27;s L facelet, and vice versa.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Josef,<br>
<br>
very nice to see someone finally attempting this :-)<br>
<br>
&gt; What cube parts can you suggest to store the<br>
&gt; entire cube state (I mean, for 3x3x3 you need<br>
&gt; e.g. corner perm., corner ori., edge ori, and<br>
&gt; three additional numbers storing edge perm.)<br>
<br>
Three additional numbers? I don&#x27;t understand...<br>
<br>
&gt;  - 6x center positions (6x 23*22*21 states)<br>
<br>
It might be better to store the inverse of this, i.e. what color is at <br>
each position, not the positions of each color. May save some space.<br>
<br>
Also, why 23*22*21 and not 24*23*22*21? I do understand the smaller <br>
numbers for the corners but this here surprises me.<br>
<br>
&gt; PS: I used the program to optimize sequences in <br>
&gt; the 4x4x4 method described by Marc Waterman<br>
&gt; in CFF 16 (?). and I have found several significant<br>
&gt; improvements...<br>
<br>
Can we see those algs? Maybe they&#x27;re useful for other methods as well? <br>
Also, did you try solving the two &quot;parity problems&quot; for people who <br>
first convert into a 3x3? For that I also had the idea of using a <br>
&quot;2-generator&quot;-like alg, i.e. only allowing turns of RrUu and maybe ld. <br>
This would reduce the branching factor a lot.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

OK, -s- means to turn opposite face same way in space. So Us = UD&#x27;. 
Then of coz U2s = U2D2. And U&#x27;s = Ds = U&#x27;D

And,  -a- means to turn opposite face opposite way in space (or same

One could extend this to larger cubes and write for instance ds, rs

How are you? If you send me the source again I&#x27;ll make an effort to port it

zip everytime you update the jar.

I haven&#x27;t cubed in a while now (as shows my log) since I am working all the

developer so I will need to do a lot of Java. For now it&#x27;s PHP.

Have you created the option to send the times to the database yet?

Howdy Michiel! I belive that the  timer should work with JDK 1.3. The<br>
only problem last time was using the CAPS COLOR constants rather than<br>
lowercase. I just went in (a few seconds ago) and changed them all to<br>
lowercase. (unless there were some other compatibility problems I&#x27;m<br>
unaware of).<br>
<br>
&gt; I haven&#x27;t cubed in a while now (as shows my log) since I am working<br>
all the <br>
&gt; time, and I thought I needed a break. I have started as a web/java <br>
&gt; developer so I will need to do a lot of Java. For now it&#x27;s PHP.<br>
<br>
I have been doing just the opposite! I&#x27;ve been cubing like crazy<br>
becuase I have to go back to school in four days!! I just got a new pb<br>
average of 23.89 seconds yesterday and took 4 averages this morning,<br>

Hey guys, dudes, friends, etc.,<br>
Hm.  I&#x27;ve been working on some (some meaning a few =D) tricks in pairing in the last f2l pair, (especially orienting the last layer when edges are already oriented and depending on the orientation of the 3/4 corners.  btw, with special and easy cases to recognize, i have found efficient ones!!), and I&#x27;m wondering, has anyone looked into solving the last layer -_WHILE_- placing in the last f2l pair?? <br>
[i assume this would just be jumbling the last f2l pair back and forth using the empty slot with moves, and is possible i think]  Once the edges are already oriented, there are probably the same number of cases as zibrowoski-bruchem (zb) last layer (putting in account for flipping corners/permuting corners/permuting edges), but I&#x27;m just curious about this.<br>
peace yo.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Ok, here is the best I have come up with so far for
the 5x5x5 adjacent swap:

U F U2u2 r F2f2 U2u2 F2f2 r2 U2u2 F2f2 U2u2 r F2f2
U2u2 F2f2 U2u2 f2 F U Rr F2 U2 F2 R2r2 U2 F2 U2 Rr U2
r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2

This leaves only 18 stickers to be moved, which I
believe is as good as you can do without any
disassembly. With disassembly, it could be reduced to
14 in the same way as my 3x3x3 method, or to 12 if you
also switched the center caps as Stefan suggested.
However, disassembly is less practical on the 5x5x5,
and as you said, you don&#x27;t feel like doing it.

Also, I realize the algorithm is pretty long, but
that&#x27;s because I made most of it up in my head, and by
just trying stuff out on the cube. It works, and
that&#x27;s the important thing, but if anyone else wants
to try to compress it a little, I&#x27;d be interested in
hearing how you go about it... :)

          <div class="email-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
&gt; Hi Josef,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; very nice to see someone finally attempting this :-)<br>
<br>
Currently, I am not the only one (but maybe the first one :))...<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; What cube parts can you suggest to store the<br>
&gt; &gt; entire cube state (I mean, for 3x3x3 you need<br>
&gt; &gt; e.g. corner perm., corner ori., edge ori, and<br>
&gt; &gt; three additional numbers storing edge perm.)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Three additional numbers? I don&#x27;t understand...<br>
<br>
the edge permutation has 12! = 479,001,600 states which<br>
is simply too much (if not true for optimized pruning table,<br>
creating a transformation table is imposible).<br>
So all cube explorer- like programs use more<br>
numbers to store the edge permutation.<br>
3x position of 4 edges (U, D, and E) seems to be good<br>
alternative for Kociemba&#x27;s 2-phase algoritm.<br>
The number of states for each edge quadruple is<br>
12*11*10*9 and together, they determine the whole<br>
edge permutation... (You can see this in ACube<br>
during table computation).<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt;  - 6x center positions (6x 23*22*21 states)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It might be better to store the inverse of this, i.e. what color <br>
is at <br>
&gt; each position, not the positions of each color. May save some <br>
space.<br>
<br>
I cannot imagine how can I handle 4 U center locations and<br>
which colors are in them as an easy to transform number...<br>
If you can, tell me...<br>
<br>
&gt; Also, why 23*22*21 and not 24*23*22*21? I do understand the <br>
smaller <br>
&gt; numbers for the corners but this here surprises me.<br>
<br>
We ignore relative positions of centers with the same color..<br>
so it is binom(24,4) = 24*23*22*21/(4*3*2) = 24*23*22*21/24 = ...<br>
I wrote the shorter form because I worked with it a lot...<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; PS: I used the program to optimize sequences in <br>
&gt; &gt; the 4x4x4 method described by Marc Waterman<br>
&gt; &gt; in CFF 16 (?). and I have found several significant<br>
&gt; &gt; improvements...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Can we see those algs? Maybe they&#x27;re useful for other methods as <br>
well? <br>
<br>
I am not sure, because the sequences are used to permute<br>
(and let us say orient - which otherwise makes no sense on 4x4x4)<br>
4 UF and UB edges and ignores U, F, D, and B centers.<br>
However: here are some of them:<br>
(the sequences were chosen wrt. speed)<br>
3-cycle: r2 F2 l F2 l&#x27; F2 r F2 r<br>
inter-pair swap: F2 r F2 l r F2 l lr2 F2<br>
inter-pair+opposite swap: F2 r&#x27; F2 l r F2 l&#x27; F2<br>
They may be already known...<br>
I have few solution of other situations, but computation<br>
has not finished yet (depth 12 takes days to complete).<br>
I had to restart the computation often due to bugs...<br>
<br>
&gt; Also, did you try solving the two &quot;parity problems&quot; for people who <br>
&gt; first convert into a 3x3?<br>
<br>
I am affraid that these situations requires nore than 12 turns...<br>
<br>
&gt; For that I also had the idea of using a <br>
&gt; &quot;2-generator&quot;-like alg, i.e. only allowing turns of RrUu and maybe <br>
ld. <br>
&gt; This would reduce the branching factor a lot.<br>
<br>
I can try that (as soon as I have a computer that is not busy :))<br>

          <div class="email-content">You could also just analyze the rules of the 5x5 (contrary to the 
rules of the 3x3, i.e. always even permutation, and orientations of 
edges and corners are restricted etc.), work out a configuration that 
is optimal, and just solve to this configuration.

  Ok, here is the best I have come up with so far for
  the 5x5x5 adjacent swap:

  U F U2u2 r F2f2 U2u2 F2f2 r2 U2u2 F2f2 U2u2 r F2f2
  U2u2 F2f2 U2u2 f2 F U Rr F2 U2 F2 R2r2 U2 F2 U2 Rr U2
  r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r2

  This leaves only 18 stickers to be moved, which I
  believe is as good as you can do without any
  disassembly. With disassembly, it could be reduced to
  14 in the same way as my 3x3x3 method, or to 12 if you
  also switched the center caps as Stefan suggested.
  However, disassembly is less practical on the 5x5x5,
  and as you said, you don&#x27;t feel like doing it.

  Also, I realize the algorithm is pretty long, but
  that&#x27;s because I made most of it up in my head, and by
  just trying stuff out on the cube. It works, and
  that&#x27;s the important thing, but if anyone else wants
  to try to compress it a little, I&#x27;d be interested in
  hearing how you go about it... :)

SUCCESS!!!<br>
<br>
After months of preparation this afternoon I successfully solved a <br>
4x4x4 Supercube blindfolded!!<br>
<br>
I didn&#x27;t really time myself for the memorization part but the actual <br>
solve took just over 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
For the scramble perform the following alg (generated by Jess <br>
Bonde&#x27;s timer) on a BOY cube (i.e. Blue/Green, White/Yellow).<br>
<br>
Keep white on UP, blue on FRONT, and red on LEFT <br>
(this is how I always hold my cube while blindfolding):<br>
<br>
L2  F  b&#x27;  f&#x27;  U&#x27;  b  u2  r <br>
 B  D2  R  L2  r&#x27;  d  B&#x27;  r2 <br>
 B2  L2  U  L2  U&#x27;  d  D2  b <br>
 u&#x27;  B  b  F2  d  U2  F  f<br>
  b  U&#x27;  d&#x27;  l  d&#x27;  r2  U&#x27;  F&#x27;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I developed my own 3 step method:<br>
<br>
(1) I  oriented the corners and solved the corner permutation by <br>
cycling as per usual 3x3x3 blindfoldsolving.<br>
<br>
<br>
(2) Then I solved the center permutations two pieces at a time by <br>
three cycling: <br>
          Fur --- &gt; Dfr  --- &gt; Dbr --- &gt; Fur<br>
<br>
   u&#x27; r u   F&#x27; u&#x27; r&#x27; u r F r&#x27;<br>
(with the necessary set-up moves, naturally  [X,Y], alg, [Y&#x27;,X&#x27;])<br>
<br>
<br>
(3) Finally I solved the edge permutation by 3 cycling through:<br>
         FUl --- &gt; LUf --- &gt; RUf --- &gt; FUl<br>
<br>
      F&#x27;    dR&#x27;d&#x27;L    dRd&#x27;L&#x27;    F<br>
(with the necessary set-up moves, naturally  [X,Y], alg, [Y&#x27;,X&#x27;])<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I even took dig cam photos of several stages of the solve (or at <br>
least I did my best  most are off center as I was pretty much <br>
aiming in the general vicinity of the cube being blindfolded and <br>
all!!)<br>
<br>
<br>
MANY THANKS to several important inspirations:<br>
<br>
to Dr. Carr  for blindfold solving the &quot;cycle&quot; (but substituting an <br>
extra 3x3x3 in lieu of your broken 2x2x2!).  Your pdf tutored me to <br>
my first 3x3x3 blindfoldsolve last fall.  Many thanks also for your <br>
subsequent encouragement on this forum;<br>
<br>
to Chris Hardwick who has already blindfoldsolved a superrevenge <br>
which is where I got the idea;<br>
<br>
to Stephan Pochman  who coincidentally first solved 3x3x3 <br>
blindfolded at the same time as I did, but who has already <br>
blindfoldsolved a 5x5x5 at the EC as well as a Megaminx <br>
(hoeffentlich koenne ich auch so tun);<br>
<br>
to Per Kristian Fredlund  I figured out the center 3 cycle I wanted <br>
to use shortly after reading your post on customizing your own 3 <br>
cycles;<br>
<br>
to Masayuki Akimoto  one of the nicest guys I met in Toronto, <br>
champion of 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 speedsolving.  I learned the edge 3 <br>
cycle I used off your website (adapted for use from D to U);<br>

Well, don&#x27;t encode the locations. They&#x27;re implicitly encoded. Choose 
some order of the U centers (e.g. Ufl, Ufr, Ubr, Ubl) look at the 
colors there. So for each center you have a string of four characters 
of &quot;WYORGB&quot;. So each center has

6^4 = 1296 &lt; 10626 = 23*22*21

states. But I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing with the states, so maybe 
your way is more efficient time-wise.

Hey you said you took pictures of the solve, do you have them on the 
internet?  Those would be cool to see!

Glad I could be one of the people who inspired you, though your  BLD 
4x4x4 supercube method is definitely MUCH better than the one I 
used :)

Is it hard to memorize the cycles when you memorize that way?  Two 
cycles of length potentially 24 seems like it would take practice.

Do you have any thoughts of trying the 5x5x5 supercube?  I&#x27;d like to 
do it one day, but I need a lot of practice before I&#x27;d be able to do 
that.

Congratulations again!
Chris

I am. Last week I wrote a universal puzzler solver. It has now 
verified most of the tables of various puzzles that can be found on 
my site. I have found the same (or similar) sequences as Josef for 
the cases ignoring centres. The only solved case with centres is:
r2 U2 r2 (uU)2 r2 u2
if I remember correctly, which swaps UF and UB pair.

Before anyone asks, I won&#x27;t release this program till it is finished, 
which is some time away.

The problem with this is, it is hard to prune on this information. 
You need to know how many moves it takes to put those centres 
correct, and to work that out you go through positions that are not 
encoded by this scheme. 
Furthermore, if you have the 6 numbers of the centres encoded by your 
scheme, the effect of a move on one number depends on several of the 
others.
If you encode the 24C4 possible positions of one colour instead, this 
works better since each is not affected by the other encoded numbers.

I have tried the &#x27;single edge&#x27; flip, and even ignoring centres it is 
more than 10 moves, with centres it is at least 12. I broke the 
searches off fairly early.

I&#x27;ll try that too.

<br>
recently, I have contacted Marc Waterman and<br>
he was quite surprised...<br>
He sent me quite a detailed description of his method<br>
from his point of view and allowed me to make it<br>
public (I will place it on rubikscube.info).<br>
He also found an old booklet (about 30 pages) by<br>
Anneke Treep later published in CFF 14-16.<br>
He and Anneke gave me a permission to make it freely<br>
available, so I will upload it...<br>
<br>
What was surprising to me was the fact that he found his<br>
old cube and tried to solve that after my email<br>
and he got 21s (after many years of not touching it<br>
without knowing all the algorithms)!<br>
<br>
I also got a tape with Marc solving the cube marathon<br>
(42 cubes) in 17 minutes and some other videos from<br>
its author Klass Steenhuis (I hope I spell it right)<br>

Hi Chris,

I do not currently have a website so I uploaded the pictures to the 
photo section of this group.  Check out the folder called &quot;Blindfold 
SuperRevenge&quot;.  There are 7 pictures:

1 - Scramble
2 - Solve Corners
3 - Solve 12 centers
4 - Solve all centers
5 - Solve 12 edges
5b - Solve 12 edges (right view)
6 - SUCCESS!!

All pictures are taken from the left so they show the L, U, and F 
faces.  I always blindfold with White UP and Blue FRONT.  Some of 
the pictures (esp #4) are a little off center as I was guessing 
where to point the camera :)

I took the pictures for 2 reasons - (1) just in case I made an error 
I would be able to trace where in the solve the error crept in.  And 
more importantly (2) I always lament the fact that in blindfold 
solving the actual performer does not get to see the cube slowly and 
methodically coming together.  By taking photos I get the best of 
both worlds - a legit blindsolve and the opportunity to watch the 
solve devellop!  


You are right that solving by cycles leads to long strings of 
cycles.  In fact, in this solve the center permutation was a long 22 
center cycle together with a 2-swap.  By performing the alg 10 times 
I was left with 2 two swaps: 18 2, 16 12.  I solved this situation 
(to answer Stephan&#x27;s question) by three cycling 18 into place then 
three cycling the last three into place.  Thus all centers were 
placed with just 12 applications of the same three cycle move.

Memorizing the long strings of numbers is a little tricky at first 
(as there are just so many more than on a 3x3x3 solve) but becomes 
easier with practice.  I often also use the major system to convert 
the numbers into letters and thence into an inane story with trigger 
words.  After a little practice I started to prefer the really long 
cycles over several shorter cycles.  As per strict rules of 
blindfolding I never write any information down -- it must all be 
done in your head.

If the edge permutation ends up with an odd number of pair swaps I 
turn the last one into a three cycle and set up a pair flip.  To 
explain: if I end up with all edges solved except for numbers 7 and 
2 which need to be swapped I make it a three cycle by solving 7, 
cycling 1 to 2 and cycling 2 to 1.  Thus 1 and 2 (the white blue 
edges in my numeration) are joined but inverted.  I use the 15 move 
alg to solve the pair flip and then have to apply another alg to 
cycle the UP center unit 180 degrees.  This tactic works beauty on 
the 4x4x4 but it wont work on the 5x5x5 supercube so I will have to 
find another way around that potentiality before I can attempt a 
blindfold superprof. 

Hope this all makes sense,

Rob

          <div class="email-content">Hey Rob,

Just a quick note that popped in my head after reading your mesage.

If on the 5x5x5 supercube you ran into an odd permutation on the 
outer edges (so you end up with two swapped) that means that you 
absolutely must have two central centers swapped (the ones lying on 
an imaginary plus sign on the center group, I call them oddly 
enough &quot;+&quot; centers).  What I would do is just remember that two 
outer edge pieces are switched, then start the &quot;+&quot; center cycles 
until I ended up with only two switched.  Then you could solve both 
at once.

Do some setup moves and/or cycles to set up having rUF and lUF being 
the two edges that are switched and UlS and UrS the two centers that 
need to swap.

Then do the normal parity solve move r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r 
F2 l&#x27; B2 r2

then move the outer four centers (I call them the &quot;X&quot; centers) back 
to their correct spots:

r l  d2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U r l d2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27;

I&#x27;ve done a little bit of thinking for the 5x5x5 supercube, and that 
is one ways to handle the parity error (which is like the 3x3x3 
corners and edges parity, in that it affects two orbits jointly, 
here the &quot;+&quot; centers and outer edges).

Another way to handle it is to setup the two swapped edges in UF 
without affecting lUs or rUs, then do the normal parity move, and 
lastly move the X centers back:

r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r&#x27; l d2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U r l d2 r&#x27; l&#x27; 
U&#x27;

Which fixes the edges, but also swaps UlS and UrS, leaving you with 
potentially ending with 2 two swaps in the &quot;+&quot; centers.

If you end up with 2 two swaps in the &quot;+&quot; centers then you can use a 
setup move to get them all onto the U layer, say, and do

f&#x27; b&#x27; E2 f b U f&#x27; b&#x27; E2 f b U&#x27;

I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve thought these situations out as well, but I thought 
it would be nice to put some ideas on the board, in case others are 
trying 5x5 supercubing as well.

Just to add some notes on the board, and of course another $0.02 :)

Chris

P.S. with all the $0.02 on this board, we should all be filthy rich 
by now :)

          <div class="email-content">I kind of doubt the Cube Prix will work.  The World Cube Cup hasn&#x27;t 
been that successful because people don&#x27;t have attention spans long 
enough to remember to submit their entries when they are due, hence, 
the big delay in the World Cube Cup.  (For those of you wondering, 
we&#x27;ll have the next round soon... if there are any teams left.)  I kind 
of doubt people will be submitting times consistently enough for you to 
have any type of Cube Prix.  Furthermore, I really doubt you&#x27;ll have 
enough people submitting times consistently so there&#x27;s actually 
competition for the people.

As for another contest, I believe the addition of the Friday contest 
was already too much.

          <div class="email-content">I appreciate your doubts:)  if people don&#x27;t submit
entries, then they have no chance to win prizes! to
bad for them.  People will compete out of their own
free will, and will participate in contests they
enjoy.  I will just make sure everyone enjoys mine. 
Take care all!

the big delay in the World Cube Cup. (For those of you wondering, 
we&#x27;ll have the next round soon... if there are any teams left.) I kind 
of doubt people will be submitting times consistently enough for you to 
have any type of Cube Prix. Furthermore, I really doubt you&#x27;ll have 
enough people submitting times consistently so there&#x27;s actually 
competition for the people.

As for another contest, I believe the addition of the Friday contest 
was already too much.

 I&#x27;m not so paranoid about people cheating as some
people.  For once...lets try to be a little more
positive about things.  Furthermore, you can&#x27;t speak
for everyone.  I would appreciate any more direct

          <div class="email-content">My basic approach runs like this:

- Break the cube in (only applies to first time lubing).

- Disassemble cube, and spread all pieces (including central skeleton) 
out on an old newspaper. Make sure the windows are open.

- Spray all (internal) sides of all pieces, e.g. the sides that cause 
friction when moving. Don&#x27;t be afraid to get lube on other parts 
though.

- Wait 5 minutes, and spray again. Try not to touch the pieces when 
you spray, it&#x27;s possible to put them all out so you can reach the 
vital areas without having to pick them up.

- Wait about 15 minutes. Then wipe all pieces dry.

- Assemble, and cube away!

          <div class="email-content">&gt; The problem with this is, it is hard to prune on this information. <br>
&gt; You need to know how many moves it takes to put those centres <br>
&gt; correct, and to work that out you go through positions that are not <br>
&gt; encoded by this scheme. <br>
&gt; Furthermore, if you have the 6 numbers of the centres encoded by <br>
your <br>
&gt; scheme, the effect of a move on one number depends on several of the <br>
&gt; others.<br>
&gt; If you encode the 24C4 possible positions of one colour instead, <br>
this <br>
&gt; works better since each is not affected by the other encoded <br>
numbers.<br>
<br>
Yeah ok, I can now see the advantages. Makes me look stupid because I <br>
always used the way I described to store puzzle states. Next time I <br>
write a solver I&#x27;ll think about using this one instead.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For that I also had the idea of using a <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;2-generator&quot;-like alg, i.e. only allowing turns of RrUu and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maybe ld. <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This would reduce the branching factor a lot.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I can try that (as soon as I have a computer that is not busy :)<br>
)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#x27;ll try that too.<br>

Thanks, I&#x27;d be very much interested in 2gen algs for the parity <br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; If the edge permutation ends up with an odd number of pair swaps I <br>
&gt; turn the last one into a three cycle and set up a pair flip.  To <br>
&gt; explain: if I end up with all edges solved except for numbers 7 and <br>
&gt; 2 which need to be swapped I make it a three cycle by solving 7, <br>
&gt; cycling 1 to 2 and cycling 2 to 1.  Thus 1 and 2 (the white blue <br>
&gt; edges in my numeration) are joined but inverted.  I use the 15 move <br>
&gt; alg to solve the pair flip and then have to apply another alg to <br>
&gt; cycle the UP center unit 180 degrees.<br>
<br>
Another idea for a single swap: Bring the two edges to UFl and UBl <br>
treating the 4x4 as a 3x3 (or just bring them on opposite ends of such <br>
a &quot;row&quot; and rotate the whole cube). Now do this alg:<br>
R2r2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; R2r2<br>
This probably looks familiar to you, right?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,

Whoa I had never thought of that, glad I posted so that I could be 
pointed out for that mistake.

I started thinking about it again, so let me rephrase what I said 
earlier.

If you end up with an odd permutation on the outer edges then either:
1) The &quot;+&quot; centers permutation is also odd
or
2) The corner permutation AND the permutation of the &quot;X&quot; centers are 
also odd.

It turns out that my solving strategy for the 5x5 supercube 
influenced my thinking about the parities.  I always correct the &quot;X&quot; 
center parity in my speedsolve solution before I would even begin to 
look for the parity error, so I always eliminated that second 
possibility.

For 5x5x5 supercube blindfold solving here is my first stab at all 
the possible parity states (permutations only)

1) no odd orbits
2) corners, &quot;X&quot; centers, &quot;+&quot; centers, central edges all odd
3) corners, &quot;X&quot; centers, central edges, outer edges all odd
4) outer edges, &quot;+&quot; centers both odd

Case 2 and 3 would both also have odd orientations of the central 
most centers (since the corner permutation is odd).

I think that&#x27;s it, based on all the possible moves.

I guess it would help to come up with a strategy for each case 
before attempting a BLD 5x5 supercube solve, but it seems you could 
think through the process during the solving as well.

Wow, all this thinking about 5x5x5 supercube solving has me REALLY 
wanting to try it now :)  I&#x27;ll have to get my cube from home and 
start working on this.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Another way to handle it is to setup the two swapped edges in UF <br>
&gt; without affecting lUs or rUs, then do the normal parity move, and <br>
&gt; lastly move the X centers back:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; r2 B2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; B2 r&#x27; l d2 r&#x27; l&#x27; U r l d2 r&#x27; l&#x27; <br>
&gt; U&#x27;<br>
<br>
How about doing your pair flip (btw, you can safely replace the r2 at <br>
start/end by R2r2) and then fixing it with a 180 of the U center?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t think solve times are the reason. My average is slower than 
yours and I competed in the qualifiying round and the first round of 
the World Cup. The reason I didn&#x27;t make it past Round 1 wasn&#x27;t 
because my times were too slow, it was because a couple of the team 
members didn&#x27;t submit times and so the team was disqualified. :(

I think this is what happened to many of the other teams too.

$1000 bucks for finding a good deal on a car.  You could&#x27;ve found it 
yourself, but instead paid them to do it.

Still, I think that if whomever owns the link he&#x27;s sending out wanted 
him to stop, it should be stopped.  There&#x27;s the bandwidth issue, 
which isn&#x27;t a good argument if the site is publicised.  And then 
there&#x27;s the fact that the owner of the site isn&#x27;t getting a cut... 
that&#x27;s the best argument IMHO.

I almost want to buy it just to see who&#x27;s site it takes me to!

I can&#x27;t see why not. It&#x27;s just information that&#x27;s being sold. If 
someone really wants to pay for the link then it would be wrong to 
prevent them from doing so - of course you could try to dissuade them 
(*). In fact, if they find the item on ebay and realize there is such 
a page but then don&#x27;t consider searching for it (and, surely, if they 
know of ebay they will know of some search engine) then what fault of 
the seller is that?
I&#x27;d have thought you&#x27;d be all for the freedom of speech of the 
seller, being that it is in the US constitution (not that the seller 
is from the US), and encourage his capital opportunism rather than 
trying to mess with the site/auction.
It&#x27;s somewhat like arguing about shops selling maps of town when you 
can often pick them up for free (or at a much lower cost) from the 
Tourist Information Centre, provided you can find it without a map.

(*) Besides which, if you&#x27;re against it, you could equally just sell 
the item with a reserve of zero (or, if that&#x27;s against the rules, 
sell it with a high reserve but explicitly mention the link in the 
text - so that nobody will pay for it).

Hmmm. Perhaps I can put something up that someone will send me a 
solved cube and I will scramble it and send them it back...

<br>
does anybody tried a different way to solve F2L:<br>
 - solve 4 D corners<br>
 - solve R center + RD, RF, and RB edges<br>
 - solve LD, LF, and LB edges (only U, M, and R turns)<br>
 - solve D center + DF and DB edges (only U and M turns)<br>
<br>
It is similar to part of Gilles&#x27;s method, but it is &quot;more<br>
corners-first&quot;.<br>
The advantages would be (?):<br>
 - less turns (although using slices)<br>
 - no need to turn the whole cube<br>
 - turns restricted to U M R for most of time...<br>

What do you think?<br>

Philip allowed it...). But hey, maybe he&#x27;s even happy about the

<br>
Check out http://www.its.caltech.edu/~tmao/SolveTheCube.doc .  It&#x27;s a <br>
document I&#x27;ve written that explains how to solve the cube.  It&#x27;s all in <br>
text and we plan to distribute it to people on the street as part of a <br>
cube filming event on Thursday.<br>
<br>
There&#x27;s not much room for change as you will see I take up exactly 3 <br>
pages... but let me know if this would make sense to anyone who doesn&#x27;t <br>
know how to cube.  Of course, I&#x27;m counting that I&#x27;ll be out there on <br>
the street explaining things to people to supplement this as well...<br>
<br>
And yeah, pictures would be better.  But I only had text...<br>

Hmm, Eivind I think what your doing is illegal. You bought something
that someone was trying to sell and you&#x27;re duplicating it for free for

There are actually two mistakes. The last move of step 4 should be F&#x27; instead <br>
of F, and the last move of step 6 should be U&#x27; instead of U (this one doesn&#x27;t <br>

Actually it can&#x27;t be the only mistake. I believe now that I also <br>
3-cycled three X-edges instead of three outer edges at one point. I do <br>
know I did this at least once but I realized and fixed it. It&#x27;s <br>
because I use very similar algorithms for the different cubie types:<br>
M d M&#x27; U M d&#x27; M&#x27; U&#x27;<br>
l d l&#x27; U l d&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27;<br>
l D l&#x27; U l D&#x27; l&#x27; U&#x27;<br>
So if I turn d instead of D then I apply the wrong 3-cycle. And it&#x27;s <br>
very easy to continue doing d after having done it 25 times in a row ;<br>

The 10th solve was a POP, and the 1st solve was a PLL skip using COLL.<br>
<br>
So this wasn&#x27;t a rolling average, and I didn&#x27;t do a 13th solve for <br>
for that POP. The only thing I feel bad about is that it could have <br>
been all sub-16 if it wasn&#x27;t for that POP.... Anyways, there still <br>
seems to be some (although very little) room for improvement, and I <br>
think sub-14 should be possible with nice scrambles. =D<br>
<br>
Just wanted to let you all know.... Good luck to all (Tyson included <br>
^^) attempting to break a barrier!<br>

&gt;Hey,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I have been trying to solve some larger cubes lately (solved an <br>
&gt;11x11x11 for the first time today :)), and I have been looking at <br>
&gt;other peoples solutions for the bigger cubes... I looks like there <br>
&gt;is a way to rotate the whole cube with that applet, but I don&#x27;t know <br>
&gt;how. Does anyone know more about this?<br>

The method found at Rubiks.com.

That&#x27;s the one where you first get the F2L edges, then the LL edges, then orient the 
corners, then perm them. Don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s special name.

Hi Stephan and Chris,

I have just moved to a new city for the new University year 
(Winnipeg) so I have spent the last week getting packed and 
ready etc.  Thus I haven&#x27;t had any time to try to tackle the 5x5x5 
blindfolded as a supercube.  I am very keen on trying it.  I will 
hopefully be able to work out a solution that takes all the different 
parities into account.  (or as you guys point out -- it can be 
worked out while solving)   If so I will then practice that solution 
style a couple of times with eyes open before sitting down to 
memorize the whole deal.  I&#x27;m not too worried about the 
memorization aspect.  My blindfold failures are only rarely 
caused by memory lapse - most often I simply forget to undo a 
set-up move :(

Thanks for all your input on solution strategy.  I&#x27;m sure that one of 
us will get there eventually.

Rob

Even if your not going for speed or efficency, I highly recommend 
learning the notation... RLUDFB,R&#x27;L&#x27;U&#x27;D&#x27;F&#x27;B&#x27;,R2L2U2D2F2B2 (what 
these 18 things mean, it is documented everywhere)

For the final layer, if you are not going for speed then there are 
ways of doing it that require little or no memorization. If you&#x27;ve 
ever read about very basic modern algebra/group theory, then the way 
to flip edges (in place) and twist corners (in place) can be done 
with p*d*p^-1 type sequences. Moving pieces around (permuting) can 
be done with what I like to call &quot;toggle-moves&quot; such as for corners: 
R&#x27;D&#x27;R-U-R&#x27;DR-U-R&#x27;D&#x27;R-U2-R&#x27;DR   (assuming your last layer is on the 
top). A similar one can be cooked up for edges.

It&#x27;s more fun to play around with these elegant approaches before 
you really get into it, especailly if all you want to do is solve.  
This way you won&#x27;t have to re-memorize algorithms whenever you need 
to do a solve if you don&#x27;t do it regularly. It really shows the 
beauty of cube solving also.

I&#x27;m sure there are many advanced cubist that have yet to fully 
appreciate or for some, even know about elegent or perhaps &quot;zero-
algorithm&quot; approches.

Oh and you can twist corners by p=[R&#x27;D2R-FD2F&#x27;] and then do various 
p*U^x*p^-1   where U^x stands for U,U2, or U&#x27; and p^-1 is doing p 
backwards...[FD2F&#x27;-R&#x27;D2R]. Heck this can even be generalized a bit 
further.

Once you can solve it consistantly say under 2:30 then it is time to 
read up on the mainstream method or something that will allow for a 
smooth transition to one. I recommend
http://www.geocities.com/jasmine_ellen/RubiksCubeSolution.html
her page is very beginner-friendly. Good luck, if you are so 
inclined.

What&#x27;s the &quot;-&quot; for? I had figured (reading the end first), that you 
were meaning [R&#x27;D2R-FD2F&#x27;] (below) to be a commutator (and hence &quot;-&quot; 
would be in place of the usual &quot;,&quot; but that&#x27;s clearly not the way 
it&#x27;s being used above.

As you discovered, solving 1st+2nd+3rd layer is kind of like getting<br>
yourself trapped in a corner. It turns out that memorising algorithms is<br>
the easiest way to get out of it.<br>
<br>
If you want to solve the cube with your head and not just memorise the<br>
solutions (sounds like a good idea to me), then you really have to<br>
master the cube. Unfortunately, there are no websites that teach this<br>
:-) Most people are putting their effort into methods that require more<br>
and more memorisation.<br>
<br>
1st+2nd+3rd layer is probably the most difficult method out there, but<br>
but it is ideal for memorisation because the number of different cases<br>
that can appear is low. And if you memorise solutions to all cases, it<br>
no longer matters how difficult that step is.<br>
<br>
In my own solving method, I use no memorised algorithms, so my strategy<br>
is very different. I do not care about the number of different cases<br>
that can appear in each step, I care about how easy each step is to<br>
figure out. If this is what you&#x27;re aiming for, then starting with two<br>
layers is not a logical approach.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t have a complete description of my method yet, but you can read<br>
about what I have so far here:<br>
<br>
    http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/cube/<br>

Notice that there is no &quot;last layer&quot; step.<br>

A few interesting things in Marc&#x27;s comments:<br>
<br>
1) &quot;I tried to improve my method by avoiding this table. I left out<br>
one edge of the first face. This edge is called a &quot;ledge&quot;. This ledge<br>
is solved, together with one redge, after solving the corners of the<br>
R-face. In the booklet of Anneke Treep there is a table for solving<br>
the ledge and the redge.&quot;<br>
<br>
This way, the method looks like a rather common corners-first method.<br>
(ok, sequences in table 8 are very intuitive - but I STILL can&#x27;t<br>
understand why he decided to solve the first side completely in the<br>
first place).<br>
<br>
2) &quot;The placing of the midges takes three slices. Sometimes it is<br>
possible to eliminate or shorten this by anticipating. This is often<br>
possible when you solve one redge, together with the midges. Or when<br>
you have to solve only two midges.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the paper, they say something similar: &quot;Still, when turning the<br>
last moves of the third stage one may already insert moves so that<br>
this stage may sometimes be avoided. This of course requires a lot of<br>
experience&quot;.<br>
<br>
Well, too bad they don&#x27;t describe more precisely how they can<br>
anticipate and avoid this last M-permutation, that&#x27;s the only thing<br>
I&#x27;m really interested in. I&#x27;ve been trying to do this for months, and<br>
it makes me think that it&#x27;s only interesting in a few special cases.<br>

&gt; first place).<br>
<br>
Beside the fact that it was one of the first &quot;official&quot; methods<br>
supplied by Ideal, it requires less concentration focused on<br>
L face when solving R face edges because you can rotate the L face<br>
(or the whole cube around L-R axis) as you want and it requires<br>
less steps then using only the learned sequences without intuitive<br>
steps... (although there are quite large amount of required <br>
sequences)...<br>
Also arter solving (or during solving) R corners you need not<br>
pay attention to the L edge hole to be placed at top when<br>
this step is finished...<br>
This is only my opinion...<br>
<br>

and<br>
&gt; it makes me think that it&#x27;s only interesting in a few special <br>
cases.<br>
<br>
Just my experience:<br>
the last turns before the M-permutation are Ux Mx(sometimes Rx) U2.<br>
Quite often, you can merge these moves with the last M-permutation<br>
and it just disappears (using max. 1 additional) turn...<br>
It is not so hard to see that...<br>
Not so good situation is connecting last Ux turn with first U2 turn<br>
of M-permutation (saves 2 turs).<br>

<br>
Yes, that&#x27;s the only optimization I can see. Ok, it&#x27;s not just a few<br>
special cases as I said, it happens relatively often (25%, or a little<br>
bit more if you&#x27;re thinking about optimizing UE2ME2 for HTM) (I have<br>
to slow down a bit if I don&#x27;t want to miss it).<br>
Is it possible to optimize further and merge Table 5 and the<br>
M-permutation in a more clever way?<br>

Oh ok, with sequences that end with U2.
But they seem to be pretty rare ;-)

R&#x27;D&#x27;R-U-R&#x27;DR-U-R&#x27;D&#x27;R-U2-R&#x27;DR ...he did not post this
to be efficient.  The point of it is an intuitive

R&#x27;D2R-U2-R&#x27;D2R which makes the base move (R&#x27;D2R), an inverse of

I have two or three cubes that are loos enough that a corner can 
twist in mid-solve without me realizing it until I get to the end.  
If it&#x27;s a loose cube, that&#x27;d be my bet.

Here are some tips/hint that could help... Off course, you will need 
your memory for memorizing algorithms, but maybe these tips could 
make things a bit easier.

1. Break algoritms up in parts of a couple of moves. You might 
notice some moves, like RU&#x27;R&#x27;U, RUR&#x27;U&#x27; (or just RUR&#x27;) appear 
frequently. You can memorize them as &#x27;one move&#x27;. See 
http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#hints, 
where some of these moves are illustrated with videos. If you know 
some of these &#x27;triggers&#x27;, you can memorize the algorithms as 
sequences of triggers, instead of single moves. Don&#x27;t try to 
memorize the R&#x27;s and U&#x27;s, just memorize what your hands need to do. 
http://www.speedcubing.com/peter/AllesFastPermute.html is a nice 
website for learning PLL, but I&#x27;dd recommend to take a look at 
different websites, to see if you can find one with algs you like... 
2. In some cases, I look for patterns on the cube, like columns, 
squares or Corner-edge pairs. Sometimes I just memorize how to 
manipulate those patterns. This is also usefull when you memorize a 
cube rotation... (Don&#x27;t memorize the x, y etc. but remember which 
pattern you should see after the cube rotation).
3. Maybe you can search this yahoo group for more tips, I am pretty 
sure this subject has been discussed before. 

Good luck,

Joel.

Hi,

this is my biggest problem: learning algorithms. with this in mind, I
have written a guide for the permutations, which can be found at:

This worked for me and I still do it today to learn a new alg:  

I would do the 1st two moves of the new algorithm at least 5 times.  
Then I would add the 3rd move and do the first 3 moves 5 times.  Then 
I would add the 4th turn and so on doing the growing sequence 5-10 
times until I finished.

For me at least, the triggers and groupings kinda just come 
automatically after you do it so many times.  Your fingers naturally 
want to adjust the grip and position to twist the sequence as fast as 
they can.

          <div class="email-content">Oh right, never thought of this. It&#x27;s indeed a lot easier. Maybe it&#x27;s 
because I came up with this for the Megaminx and there&#x27;s no D2 ;-) 
Still sometimes I use the wrong direction and mix up my Megaminx in 
the last solution stage, which is kinda frustrating...

          <div class="email-content">Michiel, can you add subpages?  I know I, and also probably Stefan 
Pochmann, Rob Butler, and Per Fredlund would have a lot to say about 
properties of larger cubes and also supercubes.

I would be interested in adding a section about this, but would it 
be something worth reading?  Stefan, Rob would you guys be 
interested in typing up a supercube page as well?

Richard Carr, you also seem to be a master of larger cubes and the 
math behind them :)  Would you be interested?

Just a thought, I think it would be cool to have something about 
supercubes and larger cubes, but it&#x27;s highly specialized.  I wonder 
if it would be read much at all.

          <div class="email-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
I made a nice PHP script for generating static images of a 3x3x3 cube. <br>
You can generate any configuration with it. It could be useful for <br>
people who want to illustrate their web pages but don&#x27;t want to use <br>
heavy Java applets:<br>

Hey EVERYONE,<br>
I was thinking...  Since we are all _masters_ of the cube (despite the level of degree), we all know the cube and how it works (with different systems, etc.)  I think, we should make a new word that defines the theory/how the works/practice of the cube:  CUBOLOGY (or something that sounds cooler) :)<br>
What does everyone else think?  This shouldn&#x27;t take too much time/energy in making a new word in the dictionaries :).  rather that...or im just crazy! :D  ron? tyson? chris?...<br>

us speedcubers can be called NeoCubists! Sounds scary...sounds like a

Or cubistry? hm...cubics? Are there any other words for cube?
Hexahedronology? Um..

and i really dont get it all that well. I can solve the cube in <br>
about 2 minutes using some begginer way to solve it but now i want <br>
to move on to the first two layers then last layer, i was wondering <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Adam-
This is what I did right after I memorized the beginner solution:

Practice till I got to 1:05-1:15
Memorize Corner Orientation Algs
Memorize Edge Orientation Algs (There are 3 algs, you already know 
one)
Memorize Edge Permutation
F2L
PLL

I&#x27;m still 4 algs away from PLL, but Macky advises you learn PLL 
before F2L. Takahito Domon proves F2L isn&#x27;t really needed, but PLL 
really helps. He proved sub18 is possible with just PLL (In other 
words, he does:
Cross
1st layer corners
Middle layer edges
Orient corners
Orient edges
Permute in 1 step)

So my advice is to memorize algorithms for 4 step last layer. Then 
work on 3 step last layer, by permuting in one step (21 Algorithms, 
but if you know of the edge permutation, and the one corner 
permutation you have only 16 algs to go)

Er, I hope I didn&#x27;t confuse you too bad... I&#x27;m not a great cuber, 
and I&#x27;m not sure what others did. But I had Macky tell me what to 
do. =P

Well, now that I got some reactions to my post, please stop bothering me,
and bother the page. The reason that it is highly incomplete is because it
was an invitation to start correcting it. So please stop posting and mailing
me about things that are incorrect and just change them. That&#x27;s the whole
wiki-idea.

If you don&#x27;t feel like registering there than just click on &#x27;edit&#x27; and you
can change the article right there and then.

Making a subweb is a matter of creating a page for a new word or term, and
then link the speedcubing wiki page to your page. Just read the tutorial.

<br>
The easiest way I have found (in windows) is to use a batch file. You<br>
can open up notepad, or another plain text editor, and type:<br>
<br>
java -jar JNetCube.jar<br>
<br>
and then save the file as &quot;run.bat&quot;. Make sure to store this file in<br>
the same directory as JNetCube.jar. You can then execute the program<br>
by either double-clicking the .bat file, or by creating a shortcut to<br>
the .bat file on your desktop or something.<br>

&gt; Michiel, can you add subpages?  I know I, and also probably <br>
Stefan <br>
&gt; Pochmann, Rob Butler, and Per Fredlund would have a lot to <br>
say about <br>
&gt; properties of larger cubes and also supercubes.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I would be interested in adding a section about this, but would <br>
it <br>
&gt; be something worth reading?  Stefan, Rob would you guys be <br>
&gt; interested in typing up a supercube page as well?<br>
<br>
<br>
Sure, I&#x27;ll be happy to help build a supercube page but since I just <br>
moved universities and I am now teaching new courses I&#x27;ll need <br>
at least a month to get settled in before I can dedicate the time to <br>
doing it right.  <br>
<br>
The good side about a new university is that it gives me a whole <br>
new province full of people to introduce to the cube!<br>

Thanks for the heads up :)

oh, damn I&#x27;ll have to add something. It&#x27;s based on your and zbigniew&#x27;s
estimate of f2l-one_pair in 18 moves (which I can&#x27;t even do slowly,
let alone at full speed). From there, even the zbignew method needs 20
moves on average, giving 38 moves. 

>From a more theoretical (talking out of my ass actually) stand point,
I&#x27;d say that humans are able to cope with 3 pieces at a time. A
three-cycle is at best 6 moves. Given 20 pieces, this gives about
6*20/3, ~40 moves. (This may be complete rubbish)

This reminds me of your &quot;ideal method&quot;. Even if you could achieve
consistent 30 move sols, you would be moving 2.5 moves per second,
which is not &quot;slow&quot;.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; It sounds like you use algorithms to solve the cross. Is that true?<br>

Isn&#x27;t everybody? It&#x27;s just that you usually make up an appropriate <br>

I made an observation recently that the first 10 pieces and last 10<br>
pieces can be solved in a roughly equal number of moves. In Fridrich,<br>
it&#x27;s 27+27. In the method I&#x27;m developing, I think 15+15 is possible for<br>
fewest moves, and 18+18 is possible for speed. It may take 5-10 years of<br>
practice before I can do 2.5 moves per second, but if I start now...<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi

I am not the owner nor moderator of the page, but I have some ideas about
them
- Any page about larger cubes should be categorized as part of the Rubik&#x27;s
Cube page, not the speedcubing page.
- wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and as such should only explain basic facts
to the general audience, explaining them in as much detail as is needed, but
not more. The page should explain: &#x27;what is speedcubing?&#x27; not &#x27;how do I
speedcube?&#x27;

So I think your article serves a purpose, though not the solution and tips
part. If you feel like editing, keep in mind that HTML can also be pasted,
though the special wiki syntax is preferred.

Well, the first 3 pieces can be solved in just 3 or 4 moves. Note that<br>
at the beginning pieces are more likely to be randomly scattered (not in<br>
3-cycle positions), and not much of the cube needs to be preserved to<br>
solve them.<br>
<br>
For the first 10 pieces:<br>
<br>
3 pieces - 3 moves<br>
1 piece  - 3 moves<br>
3 pieces - 5 moves<br>
3 pieces - 7 moves<br>
<br>
(rough move count only)<br>
<br>
<br>
Another point is that I think as you approach the end, and (for example)<br>
all the pieces are confined to one layer, it is easier to consider more<br>
than 3 pieces at once. ZB and Fridrich last steps are prime examples.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve been experimenting with the double extended cross recently, and <br>
wanted to share some insights.  I get the feeling that a number of <br>
other people are trying/using extended cross sometimes, so I thought <br>
at least some people would be interested if I posted here.<br>
<br>
I was able to do the double extended cross 3 times tonight, two of <br>
the attempts were done successfully on timed speed solves and the <br>
times I got were very good compared to my average.<br>
<br>
Two things came to my attention when practicing these tonight:<br>
<br>
1) If you have a REALLY nice setup for an extended cross on a color <br>
that is not your regular color, take some time during the inspection <br>
to see if you could do a double extended cross on that other color.  <br>
If not, then its your call whether or not to do the extended cross <br>
on an &quot;off&quot; color.<br>
<br>
If you do see a double extended cross on that other color though, <br>
then I would definitely recommend doing the solve with that &quot;off&quot; <br>
color as your cross color.  The time you gain by doing a double <br>
extended cross will more than make up for your delays at recognizing <br>
a different color during the F2L.<br>
<br>
2) It seems to me that noticing double Xcross solves involving two <br>
adjacent corner edge pairs is much more likely than for two <br>
diagonally opposite corner edge pairs.  I can sometimes get a double <br>
Xcross solve on two opposite pairs, but I usually don&#x27;t notice them, <br>
especially given only 15 seconds of inspection.<br>
<br>
A good setup that seems to catch my eye is if you can, in very few <br>
moves, form a 1x2x3 block out of any pieces.  If you can, try to <br>
find a way to insert the other two edges such as to create a full <br>
2x2x3.  If you can notice that too, try to follow the other edge <br>
around for your solution and see at which point you can change your <br>
regular solution (if necessary) to make that very last edge easy to <br>
insert into its position.<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
So anyway I just wanted to say that I have started to consider <br>
double Xcross solves as something that isn&#x27;t impossible to notice in <br>
15 seconds and still execute succesfully.  It would probably come up <br>
very rarely, for me tonight it was only maybe 2-3% out of all my <br>
speedsolve attempts, but when it does come up it helps your times <br>
sooo much.  Both of my speedsolve double Xcrosses tonight were <br>
around 11-12 moves as far as I can remember, and I&#x27;m pretty sure <br>
both were on one of my &quot;off&quot; colors for the cross too.<br>
<br>
So if anyone else is interested they seem to be more likely to occur <br>
on adjancet c/e pairs, and also don&#x27;t be afraid to be color neutral <br>
when looking for one during the 15 seconds inspection.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps for anyone who has also considered trying a double <br>
Xcross strategy sometimes,<br>
<br>

Isn&#x27;t everybody? It&#x27;s just that you usually make up an appropriate 
algorithm on the fly instead of using one that you&#x27;ve learned 
beforehand. But you&#x27;re right, &quot;algorithms&quot; should be defined. We 
usually mean the &quot;off the fly&quot; ones and you don&#x27;t need any of them to 
solve the cube which contradicts the &quot;Solving here means the cube is 
scrambled and you use algorithms&quot;. The part &quot;the cube is scrambled and 
you use algorithms&quot; should simply be deleted.

Hey,

Well if you are saying that makin up your own algorithms is easy, i think its REALLY not~I have come up with 1 algorithm on my own and thats it, i&#x27;am really just starting on the F2L for the speed solving, but i know pretty much Dan Knights intermidiate way on solving the cube, if you get me?~but if you dont get me thats alright no one really does they say i should just do it inutitive wich i find hard, anyway thanks for writing back gtg cube,

Well that&#x27;s probably because you haven&#x27;t heard about simple 
commutators yet. I&#x27;m talking about making up algorithms like this one:

(R&#x27; D R) U (R&#x27; D&#x27; R) U&#x27;

I recommend reading step 3 of Ryan&#x27;s page:

          <div class="email-content">Little update on single layer solving.  I have found that if I put in two
opposite edges first then it is pretty easy to put together two corner/edge
(top layer) pairs so that you have a cross and two corners in.  On average
even at speed this is taking me 10-12 moves.  My reasoning was that one of
the problems I get is putting in such a corner/edge pair when there are
already corners solved and this method gets around that.

Might be of help to others although its probably nothing new.

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

I can second this! Knowing commutators inside/out so to speak is 
tremendously useful! That&#x27;s basically how i solve 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 
cube varieties. I know i lag a bit behind the very top few on these 
puzzles. But im still fast.

Commutators are most often used to create 3-cycles. Be it on corners, 
edges or (on larger cubes) centers. I will try to keep this short. A 
commutator is of the form ABA&#x27;B&#x27;. This is very useful if A creates a 
small effect on a layer or a &quot;layer-block&quot;. Now B should change only 
that layer or that block of layers. Now complete the commutator w A&#x27; 
and B&#x27; (inverse of A and B respectively). I hope it&#x27;s intuitive how 
to do the inverse of a sequence of moves. If A changed only 1 piece 
(cubicle) on layer changed w B u will end up w a 3-cycle. See 
Stefan&#x27;s example. A 3-cycle can be made into another 3 cycle by doing 
some setup moves first, do the commutator, and then do the setup 
moves in reverse. It can be proven that this whole thing is also a 
commutator, but that&#x27;s only of interest to mathematicians ;-)

Now back to my way of doing 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes. I do first layer 
intuitively. I might possibly leave a few centers unsolved (esp if 
they are on the opposite face).

Next steps :

- middle layers edges
Done completely w 3-cycles (commutators).

- last layer corners
Position them - done w a 3-cycle or a double 2-cycle. Both are 
commutators or with setup move and commutator.

Orient them - again commutators. I can explain why but too lenghty to 
do it here.

- last layer edges
Lots of 3-cycles on edges (commutators again). Parity is also 
basically fixed with an edge 3-cycle.

- centers
More 3-cycles.

:-)

-Per

PS! I will i will make a site someday with my whole methodology of 
doing these larger cubes. Just too busy now being student and working 
parttime.

I have uploaded to the files section a useful program for creating 
scrambles on the 2x2x2 => 5x5x5 cube puzzles. I guess it&#x27;s not too 
hard (??) to add scrambling for Rubik&#x27;s Clock and square-1 also. I 
gotta learn the notation for the latter though;-) Never touched that 
puzzle yet ... lol ...

-Per

PS! The program is logically called CubeScrambler.exe :D It was 
designed for multiscrambles, but can be customised for single 
scrambles also. It&#x27;s not a timer program. It just gives scrambles.

They didn&#x27;t have a scramble program at the WC, so everyone just got a 
different &quot;random&quot; scramble. The official scramble length was and 
still is 40 moves for Square-1. A move can be either:
* a turn of the U layer,
* a turn of the D layer or
* a 180 degree twist of the right hand side

> Are there any usefull programs to create scamble algorithms?

Yes, I made a Square-1 scrambler during my preparations of the 2003 
World Championships:
http://lars.studentenweb.org/square1/S1Scrambler.zip

It&#x27;s written in java. To compile, execute:
javac S1scrambler.java

To run, execute:
java S1scrambler

You can also give the required scramble length:
java S1scrambler 50

The notation works like this:
* (x,y) means you have to turn the U layer x times 30 degrees 
clockwise and the D layer y times 30 degrees clockwise. You can use 
the pieces as a guide. Just keep in mind that the small pieces have an 
angle of 30 degrees and the large pieces have an angle of 60 degrees.
* / means a 180 degree twist of the right hand side

Have fun,
LarsV

Carr&#x27;s somewhat comical blindfolded solutions for the 1x1x1 up to<br>

seems easier to follow. I can orient corners and sometimes<br>
permute, but I&#x27;m just using fridrich stuff and trying to remember in<br>
my head how to put the peices where they need to go, while not<br>
screwing up the orientations.  I&#x27;m not really following the method <br>
like I probably should be... Many times I put all the corners into <br>
the correct places but a few are oriented incorrectly, sometimes even<br>
permuted incorrectly. I think I&#x27;m doing the right algorithms with<br>
my eyes closed, but I must be holding the cube in the wrong manner<br>

able to acheive a full blindsolve! I sort-of followed the stiff <br>

          <div class="email-content">Interesting insights Chris. I think intuitive steps are an important 
part of a method. Doing things intuitively rather than using 
algorithms can allow for much more efficient and faster solving 
though it takes a good cuber and a lot of practice to be able to 
handle a large intuitive step such as a double xcross. The point you 
make about using &quot;off&quot; colors is also interesting. I used to do this 
when I solved corners first just picking the side with corners that 
are the most complete. Learning to quickly make a cross of any color 
(and solve the rest of the cube that way) would definately be 
beneficial and is good and different way to get faster without 
leaning more algs. I would not think it would be an easy task but it 
might be worth it. Does anyone do this? I can easily make the cross 
on either the white or yellow side (since they are opposite) but 
rarely ever make it yellow. This is probably something I will 
practice more now.

          <div class="email-content">I used to do the cross color on best setup color for a couple of 
months straight when I first started.

I remember reading on Dan Knights&#x27; page that the cross, when solved 
on the same color, can be done in 6.5 moves on average.  When I was 
absolutely fluent with solving the cross on the best color given 
only 15 seconds inspection, I was able to do the cross in 5.5 moves 
on average.  I took several 100 averages to test this and it always 
seemed to work out to 1 less move than solving the same color every 
time.

I gave up on solving the best cross in order to instead always solve 
white after a while, since I liked the advantage of being totally 
comfortable with always seeing the same colors during the F2L.

For the 4x4x4 though I always solve the best setup pair of opposite 
colors, but for each pair of opposite colors I always choose the 
same one to be on the top no matter what.  This might be useful for 
the 3x3x3, choose the best setup cross of only three different top 
layer colors, which would make it 3 times more likely to for you to 
have a good cross, but still retain familiarity with the F2L colors.

I had never thought of that, and since I know it works from 4x4x4 
solving I&#x27;d like to try it on the 3x3x3 and see if it works well 
there too.  Chris perhaps this might be a happy medium between 
always solving the best cross color, and always solving the same 
color?

Anyway I do agree that someone who was 100% fluent at solving the 
F2L using any cross color would be faster than someone who always 
solved the same color, assuming both used exactly the same solving 
method.

This might be interesting to try.  Like Chris said though, does 
anyone else solve the best setup color already, regardless of what 
method you use?

Hi Chris(es),<br>
<br>
I personally always solve white cross.  I perfer on top but <br>
somtimes shift it to bottom while solving cross.  If not, definately <br>
after I&#x27;ve solved the cross I just give it a z2 and solve F2L cross <br>
on bottom.  I WISH I could do an extended cross in 15 secs.  <br>
Only very rarely but it REALLY helps me when I do do it.  <br>
Obviously I can always do it given enough pre-inspection but that <br>
doesn&#x27;t really help much now, does it?  I can only dream of how <br>
fast a double extended cross must be but it is way beyond my <br>
pre-inspection time.<br>
<br>
ANYWAYS - as for &#x27;OFF COLOUR&#x27; CROSSES I remember that <br>
the 100th Japonese contest ran a wicked cool event.  Best <br>
average of 7 solves.  The first 6 solves each had a different <br>
mandatory cross colour and the 7th was solver&#x27;s choice.  It <br>
produced some very interesting stats.  Some cubers had <br>
practically no difference at all between favourite and off colous <br>
while other cubers had huge discrepencies between colours.   <br>
Hopefully you can still find the results online.  You would find it <br>
very interesting.  I actually have them on my computer, but I am <br>
not on my computer right now as I am (still) waiting for my new <br>
connection to be set up.  Perhaps Masayuki could help out with <br>
the stats and some insights on &#x27;off colour&#x27; solves.  I thought that <br>
it was a very cool variation to throw into the contest (though I fear <br>
I would fare rather poorly if I tried to solve off colour)<br>
<br>
Chris&#x27; compromise might well work.  I too solve 4 x4 and 5x5 <br>
centers starting with opposites according the best lie of the land.  <br>
But then again centers on big cubes are a different ballgame <br>
from F2L pairs and after I have united all the centers I <br>
immediately shift to white cross on bottom for the 3x3 stage of <br>
the solve.  (unless I am doing a Masayuki style solve which is <br>
totally different)<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents Can$ = 1 .2 cents US$ = 1 pence = ?Euro<br>

          <div class="email-content">I only recently (2-3 months ago) decided to pick a colour having always used
the inspection time to choose a face that was easy to start on.  As I&#x27;m now
about 10 seconds faster than I was then I might go back and try it again.  I
certainly found moving to always starting with yellow somehow freed me up to
think about other things but I think maybe switching back again now I&#x27;ve
improved might also be beneficial.

<br>
I have a 1980 Hungarian Arxon 4x4x4 that popped a few pieces, so I <br>
decided to take the whole cube apart. Now I am having trouble <br>
putting all the cubies back into place (none of the pieces are <br>

steps, thanks~<br>

I remember being at that point and getting stacks of averages that 
were *just* over 1 minute - so frustrating!

I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be long till you beat the 1 minute average and 
then you&#x27;ll be wondering how it ever took you so long to solve a 
cube! ;)

          <div class="email-content">Hmm ...

It aint really so hard. it&#x27;s much worse if u have a completely 
dismantled eastsheen 4x4x4 ;-) I guess that what u are struggling 
with is to get all the centers back in place?

The trick there is to let 3 of the centers slide away and make space 
for the last one belonging to that particular face. There&#x27;s a small 
cut where the last center should go! Slide the other 3 centers back.

Here are the steps i use :(assuming it&#x27;s completely disassembled)

1) Four centers of a face. Put the core w the 4 centers down on a 
table w the 4 centers at the bottom. (a little tricky)

2) Complete bottom layer. 8 edges and 4 corners. (easy)

3) Insert four centers on same face, next to the bottom layer. Insert 
them from top and slide down and rotate them in place. (a little 
tricky)

4) Place 4 edges around the centers from step 3. (easy)

5) Do 4 more centers adjacent to the centers from step 3. (a little 
tricky) Not the top ones.

6) Do 4 more centers adjacent to the centers from step 3. (a little 
tricky) Not the top ones. 

7) Do the last 4 edges belonging to the 2 middle layers. (easy)

8) Last 4 centers of middle layers. Same method as step 3. (a little 
tricky)

9) Last 4 centers. (a little tricky)

10) Rest of top apart from 2 adjacent edges. (a little tricky to 
place the edges)

11) Rotate top layer 45 degrees. Insert last 2 edges one by one.

Voilâ !! Thats it!!

-Per K

PS! There are other possible ways too. ;-)

          <a class="header-link" href="#msg-425"><strong>425. F2L algs</strong></a><br>
          <em>From:</em> &quot;Eivind Fonn&quot; &lt;htkra1d@...&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>
          <em>Date:</em> Tue, 07 Sep 2004 14:10:13 -0000<br><br>
          <div class="email-content">Okay, so I sat down with ACube and computed this list of F2L algs:<br>
<br>
http://www.aligulac.net/f2l.txt<br>
<br>
There are algs for all the standard F2L cases there, grouped according <br>
to how I recognize them (if you can&#x27;t figure it out, do the inverse of <br>
an alg to see what it does, or just read my &quot;recognition key&quot; at the <br>
end of this post).<br>
<br>
I looked specifically for 2-generator solutions where they are <br>
possible and what I call &quot;good&quot; 3-generator solutions where <br>
2-generator ones weren&#x27;t possible. A &quot;bad&quot; 3-g algorithm uses 3 <br>
layers, where two are opposite one another. A &quot;good&quot; 3-g algorithm <br>
thus uses one and only one of the F,B layers, one and only one of the <br>
R,L layers and one and only one of the U,D layers.<br>
<br>
All algs are also mirrored in all possible ways, so that the list <br>
contains solutions for all cases from all angles. Meaning, it should <br>
be possible to solve the F2L in a (nearly) comfortable manner using <br>
this list without ever turning the cube around.<br>
<br>
Not rotating the cube is ONE advantage I see with this. The other is <br>
that - if you choose to always solve the F2L from a given cube state, <br>
i.e. always blue in front - you can instantly know where on the cube a <br>
pair should go when you see it. I.e. the green/orange pair always go <br>
in the BL slot.<br>
<br>
I agree that some of the algs are really awkward, I did try to avoid <br>
this. Most are doable though, but I selected those that were easy for <br>
_me_ to perform, and this may not be the case for you guys. I may <br>
expand this list some time in the future with alternative algs.<br>
<br>
Now, if you can&#x27;t figure out what the &quot;recognition&quot; key means (and you <br>
probably can&#x27;t, I guess), here&#x27;s the explanation for the more cryptic <br>
phrases used:<br>
<br>
- Corner X: The D sticker of the corner is on the X face.<br>
- Corner X/Y: The D sticker of the corner is on the X or Y face.<br>
- Edge Match X/Y: By turning the U layer around, the edge sticker that <br>
is not on the U face matches the color of either the X or the Y center <br>
piece.<br>
- Separated: The pieces are separated in the U layer.<br>
- Edge Far: This one is a bit hard to explain. If you turn the U layer <br>
so that you are looking directly at the D-face colored sticker of the <br>
corner (i.e. the D-face colored sticker of the corner is on the F <br>
face), then if the edge is in the UB slot, it&#x27;s &quot;far away&quot;.<br>
- Edge Near: Similar to &quot;Edge Far&quot;, except that the edge is in the UL <br>
or UR slot depending on wherever the corner is (UFR or UFL <br>
accordingly), i.e. the edge is &quot;near&quot;, or at least nearer than when <br>
it&#x27;s far. :)<br>
- Opposite: The stickers of the corner and the edge that are on the U <br>
face have different colors.<br>
- Same: The stickers of the corner and the edge that are on the U face <br>
have same colors.<br>
- Winging: Best word I could think of. Basically it means that if you <br>
turn the U layer so that the C/E pair is in its &quot;standard&quot; position, <br>
with the corner directly over where it needs to go, then it&#x27;s <br>
&quot;winging&quot; if the imaginary line that runs &quot;through&quot; the C/E pair <br>
extends to your right and left. I.e. if the corner is in UFR and the <br>
edge is in UF it&#x27;s winging.<br>
- Piercing: Opposite of winging. If that imaginary ine extends to your <br>
back and forth, i.e. the corner is in UFR and the edge is in UR, then <br>
it&#x27;s piercing.<br>
- Double: Somewhere on the 1x1x2 block that the C/E pair forms there <br>
are two adjacent stickers having the same color.<br>
- Single: Nowhere on that same 1x1x2 block the C/E pair forms are <br>
there two adjacent stickers having the same color.<br>
- FR/FL/BR/BL: Just choose the appropriate mirror.<br>
<br>
In case of sections 2, 4 and 5 the algorithms assume that you&#x27;ve <br>
turned the U layer to the standard position, meaning the corner is <br>
directly atop its target slot. This also means you must do the turn in <br>
the square brackets if you have this exact position. In section 3, the <br>
algorithm assumes that you&#x27;ve turned the U layer so that the edge <br>
&quot;matches&quot; one of the adjacent centers. I.e. for 3.1.1 (Edge match F/B)<br>
, the edge should either be in UF or UB depending on which center it <br>
matches.<br>
<br>
Hope this made any sense. If it didn&#x27;t, just do the inverse of an alg <br>
from the solved state to clarify that my confusing recognition key <br>
means.<br>

          <div class="email-content">No, really... The same phenomenon is documented with several other 
practices, and cubing is not an exception. It is a psychological 
(pedagogical??) fact that constant practice yields worse results than 
practice with timely breaks.

Is there a reason why you have excluded &lt;R,U> and &lt;R,u>? I guess the
groups they generate are the same (?), but the strategies to solve are
different.

          <div class="email-content">Just assembled my first of the new DIY kits from Rubiks.com and <br>
thought I would share.  <br>
<br>
Overall, I guess I was pretty impressed.  Immediately after assembly, <br>
it became one of the best cubes I have.  They DO have the arched <br>
centers and come with both pins and screws.<br>
<br>
The screws have a tight thread which allow for finer adjustments.  I <br>
tightened them in as deep as they would go and the cube was still a <br>
bit looser than I would like.  However, the springs seemed pretty <br>
good so it turns very nice and feels light.<br>
<br>
I only had a little trouble with the end caps.  I hesitated on super-<br>
gluing them as then they may be too hard to get off to adjust the <br>
screws later.  I have great trouble removing the caps from older <br>
cubes so I could use some advice on this...<br>
<br>
I was most impressed with their lubrication.  I&#x27;ve only used generic <br>
silicon spray othewise, but this stuff was great.  It&#x27;s liquid so <br>
it&#x27;s a bit messy, but certainly worth it.  I still haven&#x27;t tried that <br>
KY liquid as I heard that was just as good though.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I&#x27;m not much of a cube doctor so I&#x27;m not sure what is good or <br>
not, but overall I liked it.  I&#x27;m sure it takes some practice to get <br>
things just right.<br>

Solving in &lt;R,u> or &lt;r,U> is the same (cube rotation).
I can finish solving a cube in &lt;R,U>.
But I was trying to scramble a cube with U and r moves, and I realized
that it looks completely different and I have no idea about how to
solve it with U and r exclusively.

as recommended on Ton&#x27;s site. It works really well.

I thought I heard that the rubiks.com lube wasn&#x27;t very good a while 
ago. I am wondering about it now. Does anyone know what it is
(ingredients)? Any other experiences using it compared to silicon?

I think I will buy a DIY kit soon - It&#x27;s sounds good.... except 
those horrible stickers...Are the PVC ones much better?? Regardless, 
I still prefer the tint of the old vinyl ones (dark red, bright 
orange etc.)

Let me see if understand the notation. Do you mean solving using a
combination of rU and ru macros? Or do you mean the group generated by
&lt;r,u,U>?

Sorry if I&#x27;m not clear enough, I was asking for 2 different things:
- How to solve in &lt;r,U> ? As I said: &quot;But I was trying to scramble a
cube with U and r moves, and I realized that it looks completely
different and I have no idea about how to solve it with U and r
exclusively.&quot;
- How to solve in &lt;r,u> ?

I misunderstood. It seems you have looked at all possible changes of 
orientation which preserve the permutation. I was looking at all 
possible orientation changes ignoring the permutation completely.

Anyway, it means that if we are to find some position that needs more 
than 20 moves (htm), it must have some pieces not in their home 
locations.

This is the way of the Negative-Time Tommy&#x27;s run.  On one day of the year, a little bit <br>

Yes, that&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s probably beyond me to do so myself but 
there&#x27;s only 20,160 orientation preserving corner permutations (i.e. 
8!/2 - because the edges are fixed). Combining those with the 
orientations would be feasible in terms of trying to get a good upper 
bound for this groups (if taken on in some GIMPS (Great Internet 
Mersenne Prime Search) type of project).
As I recall the corner permutation subgroup (orientation-preserving) 
has diameter 18. Far more difficult (just over 10,000 times so) would 
be instead to combine with edge permutations. If that subgroup turned 
out to have diameter 20 or less then I think this would lower the 
upper bound for the whole group (as I am fairly sure that the corners 
can be placed (without regard to edge permutation or any orientation) 
in 7 moves (and 20+7+1=28&lt;29).
(Unfortunately, having to click each cube takes a lot more work than 
the GIMPS, but it seems like it could be achievable.)

Not the same groups (e.g. (rU)^4 is not achievable i &lt;R,U>.)
(Actually, r isn&#x27;t achievable in &lt;R,U> either. The fact that the 
centres move in the slice groups (so that it isn&#x27;t actually a 
subgroup of the usual cube-group) is one of the things that differs 
between them.

R4=r4=M4 (the identity - effectively the same as no move at all) but 
no other element is common to even two of these.
(Note that &lt;R> is just the set of moves you can get by doing words

repeated doing R - it doesn&#x27;t involve the M slice - similarly &lt;M> 
doesn&#x27;t involve the R slice and &lt;r> can only involve both slices (and 
twisted the same amount and in the same direction). &lt;r> could only 
include &lt;R> and &lt;M> if R and M had coprime orders s, t. Then we&#x27;d be 
able to find a,b with as+bt=1 so r^t=R^{bt^2} and again there are c,d 
with cs+dbt^2=1 so r^{td}=R would imply &lt;R> was in &lt;r> and then 
clearly &lt;M> would be in &lt;R> too.Since R and M do not have coprime 
orders then r^t=R^tM^t can only equal R if R^{t-1}=M^{-t} but as &lt;R> 
and &lt;M> intersect only in &lt;> then we&#x27;d need that the order of R 
divides t-1 and that of M divides t. Any common factor would then 
have to divide 1.)

          <div class="email-content">This is probably slightly off topic from what you guys are talking 
about, but I was curious to ask.

Is there a special name or general type of subgroup that would 
explain or relate to the 86 total positions on the cube where every 
piece is in its correct location, but none have the correct 
orientation?

I get that number by saying that the edges are forced to be in the 
superflip position, and all the corners must be twisted.  In order 
to keep the sum of the orientations equal to 0 mod 3 for the 
corners, then you have to have either 7 corners flipped one 
direction and 1 the other direction, or you have to have 4 corners 
flipped one direction while the other four are flipped the other way.

This gives you 8*2=16 positions where one corners is flipped 
differently from all the other corners.  There are then 70 positions 
where four corners are flipped one way and 4 flipped the other way 
(8 choose 4 basically).

I know these positions don&#x27;t belong as part of the center of the 
cube group, since that is only the solved state and the superflip 
state.  However, I still think this group is quite interesting, 
namely because it a group with a specific set of properties, yet is 
so small compared to the total number of combinations to the cube.

If this group has no real apllication to anything on the cube, I 
still think it is interesting.  Namely, how many moves does it take 
to reach any of those 86 states?  Are they including in your 
statement when you say the orientation group only has diameter 20 
moves HTM?  That might be a stupid question, but to be honest I&#x27;m 
not following the discussion you guys are having 100%

This concept of having every piece in the correct location but 
flipped seems to work only for the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3. You could flip 
all the corners of an even nxnxn cub n>3, or the corners and 
middlemost edges of an odd nxnxn cube n>4, but that doesn&#x27;t seem 
that interesting.

Also, for the 3x3x3 supercube there would be 
86*[2^6+15*2^4+15*2^2+1] = 31 390 positions where all the pieces are 
in the correct spot but none have the correct orientation (including 
the orientations of the centers).

So yeah, are these positions interesting mathematically at all, or 
do they not really serve any purpose?  Are they all the outliers of 
the orientation group?  Meaning does it take more moves to reach one 
of these states than most of the other orientation cases?

Just some questions from me,
Chris

<br>
&gt; Namely, how many moves does it take <br>
&gt; to reach any of those 86 states?  Are they including in your <br>
&gt; statement when you say the orientation group only has diameter 20 <br>
&gt; moves HTM?<br>
<br>
Yes, they are included. All positions where none of the pieces are <br>
moved, but some (or even all) are flipped or twisted, were included.<br>
<br>
Richard told me he did not actually check all 4 million positions, <br>
but reduced the number by taking most cube rotations etc into <br>
account, leaving 166212 positions to be checked.<br>
<br>
&gt; Also, for the 3x3x3 supercube there would be <br>
&gt; 86*[2^6+15*2^4+15*2^2+1] = 31 390 positions where all the pieces<br>
&gt; are in the correct spot but none have the correct orientation<br>
&gt; (including the orientations of the centers).<br>
<br>
I agree with that figure. There has been very little work done on the <br>
supergroup<br>
<br>
&gt; So yeah, are these positions interesting mathematically at all, or <br>
&gt; do they not really serve any purpose? Are they all the outliers of <br>
&gt; the orientation group?  Meaning does it take more moves to reach<br>
&gt; one of these states than most of the other orientation cases?<br>
<br>
Such positions are only interesting in that they are (or were) prime <br>
candidates for needing more than 20 moves, but whether they are <br>
really the most difficult ones, I don&#x27;t know. Maybe Richard can look <br>
it up in his list.<br>

I&#x27;ve got a much better idea! Using the 15s inspection, you could just
plan the F2L in 13.27 moves, and then use the ZB++ method.... 26.54
moves on average and only 2 looks!

4 moves/sec.... oh my god!...

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m not sure if solving a 2x2x3 directly everytime would be the 
fastest way.  I&#x27;m sure sometimes you could plan the whole thing, but 
I think it would be very rare.

I think what would be more realistic for that step would be to 
always plan a 2x2x2, then build a 2x2x1 onto it, just as Lars Petrus 
does it.

Also that method idea sounds like it might be a step beyond just the 
normal ZB method by itself.  It seems though that to solve the 2x2x1 
after the initial 2x2x3 would take a lot of algs, 4 pieces and a lot 
of freedom of movement, I&#x27;m guessing over a hundred at least?

I think that would be possible for someone who learned all of ZB and 
got bored with it just by itself, but I think ZB would have to be 
attainable first in order for this method to be possible.

This brings up an interesting point.  It seems that for the fastest 
methods that one day there will be very few intuitive steps, since 
algs can be performed at 4 moves/second or more, while intuitive 
steps hardly ever get that fast of a turning speed.

It&#x27;s like learning CLL then trying the 2x2x2.  Honestly I think it&#x27;s 
pretty cool to always get fast times on the 2x2x2 now using CLL, but 
it makes the puzzle kinda boring since you just intuitively place 
the first four corners in a couple moves, do an alg, then you&#x27;re 
done.

If people learn 3x3x3 methods with lots of algs like this (the Gary 
Kasparov of cubing so to speak) I wonder if the faster times would 
be worth the lesser fun I guess you could call it.

Lesser fun - but didn&#x27;t you say you&#x27;d be tempted to count the slices 
in a 4x4x4 scramble (assuming you knew what the scramble was) to go 
that little bit faster?

It can&#x27;t be a subgroup - by definition a subgroup has to contain the 
identity (and that can&#x27;t satisfy the condition of things being 
incorrectly oriented).
What you&#x27;re looking at is the intersection of the complements (or 
the complement of the union) of the stabilizers, in the orientation 
subgroup, of each piece.
Thus, for instance, in the orientation subgroup (where there&#x27;s no 
permutation, only orientations), the stabilizer of the UF edge will 
be the subgroup which fixes the UF edge (i.e. keeps its orientation 
correct). This is clearly a subgroup and its complement is clearly 
the set which flips that edge. Intersecting the complements of the 
stabilizers of each edge and of each corner we get the subset to 
which you refer.

There are other easier ways to see this too - in fact the center is 
just the subgroup of elements that commute with everything in the 
group. It is trivial to see that no element can change the 
orientation of any of the corners (if it did then conjugation would 
imply they all have to be changed the same way but neither 8 nor 16 
is congruent to 0 mod 3) or indeed that if it flips an edge it must 
flip them all - again use conjugation. Similarly it&#x27;s easy to show 
that it must fix all the pieces in place - conjugate with some 
intersecting but distinct permutation to see this) and also to see 
that the superflip is in the centre.

Then again, so is &lt;R> and it&#x27;s even smaller - it has only 4 elements.

I haven&#x27;t optimized all the ones involving superflip yet, but I did 
a few of them some time ago - don&#x27;t have them to hand right now. In 
the orientation group, the moves that superflip on the edges have 
length at least 16 and at most 20 (HTM). There are only 66 
equivalence classes in total but most of them take a lot of moves. 
Several took 19 moves and there may have been more than just the 
actual superflip that took 20. I know that there were some that I 
wasn&#x27;t able to put the machine on for long enough to decide but 
which I hadn&#x27;t been able to get to under 20 - but that&#x27;s not to say 
that they were of length 20. There were definitely several of length 
19 (though whether they were in your particular set I couldn&#x27;t say).

Well that&#x27;s true (that these are the only pieces that can be flipped 
in place - except as you describe below the very central pieces on 
an odd nxnxn cube). Of course, the number of moves required to solve 
might vary in these other cubes - the moves to flip a middle edge in 
an odd size cube will not mirror the ones in a 3x3x3 cube, because 
of having to preserve the outer edges etc.

Well, most of the orientation moves that involve superflipping the 
edges (regardless of whether they twist the corners) are quite long 
(in the sense of 18-20) but, then again, I don&#x27;t know how many of 
the others in the orientation group take close to 20 moves. When I 
got the 20 result it was mainly because I cast aside optimization 
for a while and just decided to try and get an upper bound (and 
since I already knew there to be one element requiring 20 I often 
didn&#x27;t try to go below that). It&#x27;s very unlikely that the list I 
have comprises only optimal solutions (in this regard), although I 
guess it might technically be possible, but there were a lot of 
things that were still at 20, so it&#x27;s difficult to answer your 
question fully at the moment. Like I said at the start of this 
paragraph though, most of the orientations where superflipping is 
involved take 18 moves or more.
I calculated somewhat more than the minimum number needed to work 
out the diameter of the orientation group (although far less than 
the total number in the group), but I&#x27;ve only optimized a few at the 
moment - probably less than 100,000 (or maybe 200,000) once I take 
the various isomorphisms into account.
(In fact, of the 76 basic sets I started off looking at, I&#x27;ve only 
fully optimized two of them - I did both them out in full, rather 
than being clever about it and skipping some steps - so far.)

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

No there is no need to take the 4x4x4 cube completely apart. Exactly 
how u should do it depends on which kind of cube u have got. For now 
i will assume u have the &quot;normal&quot; cube and not the Eastsheen / 
Minicube variety.

What u need to do is carefully pop out an edge pair. Do this by 
turning a layer about 45 degrees, end then pop them out carefully 
with a knife or similar. Now spray inside with silicone spray. Now 
put the edges back. If u want u can pop a few other edgepairs and do 
the same.

With the cube fully assembled again u can make sure the silicone 
spreads all around inside by &quot;scrambling&quot; it. Leave the cube for 
about 15 minutes and do some more scrambling. After 1 hr u can do 
more scrambling. U only need to do that for about 15-20 secs. Now i 
would wait for about half a day before i used the cube normally 
again.

For a &quot;normal&quot; 4x4x4 any silicone spray would be fine. However i 
have some bad experience with eastsheen 4x4x4 and petroleum-based 
silicone. So for that kinda cube make sure u read the contents on 
the bottle carefully before u buy it. Make sure it has no petroleum. 
Petroleum-based silicone will never really completely dry inside the 
cube. But the petroleum-free silicone will leave a dry white &quot;film&quot; 
inside.

I hope this helps :-)

-Per K

PS! For the eastsheen variety u need to remove the 4 centercaps of a 
face and unscrew and remove the &quot;lock&quot; beneath them. Then spray 
slightly inside and put averything back together again. Repeat on a 
few more faces if desired. Not much silicone is needed for a good 
result.

          <div class="email-content">If you want a whole cube entirely in black and white, the only thing I 
can think of is to paint patterns instead. E.g.:

- Solid white
- Solid black
- White cross on black background
- White circle on black background

.. you just have to figure out 6 easily distinguishable patterns. :)

I reckon it&#x27;s possible to squirt some silicone lube into a 5x5, 
especially if your can has a neat little plastic pipe thingy, like 
mine. Just pull two pieces apart a bit and squirt some into it. Do 
this at some 3-4 places and then just play around with the cube.

While it is difficult to reassemble afterwards, upon

It is true that some 4x4s will come out of the package

whether or not it needs a little extra help to turn
better.

Not sure where you get the 166,212 from - the actual number is not so 
high. It is, in fact, only 94,518.
There are 76 possible edge orientations up to isomorphism. We can 
pick a set of equivalence class representatives.
For any orientation of edges X and of corners Y, we can use the 
isomorphism sending X to it&#x27;s equivalence class representative X1, 
say, (which will send Y to some other corner orientation Z).
Thus (the orientation (X,Y) is isomorphic to (X1,Z).
Clearly, if X1 and X2 are representatives of different equivalence 
class then for any corner orientations S,T (X1,S) cannot be 
isomorphic to (X2,T).
But it is possible that (X1,V) might be isomorphic to (X1,W) where V 
is not W.
Fining a complete set of equivalence class representatives for each 
set {(X1,Y):Y is a corner orientation} (where X1 is fixed) for each 
edge equivalence class representative will get us a set of 
equivalence class representatives for the whole orientation group.
(So we basically look at each of the 76 sets of size 2187 and find 
out how many non-isomorphic positions there are.)
We find the number of classes for the 76 different possibilities to 
be 
66,1107,1098,594,2187,2187,300,306,2187,2187,1107,2187,2187,1098,1134
,1134,2187,1107,1098,2187,168,1107,1098,306,2187,2187,594,576,1107,21
87,576,2187,1098,2187,2187,2187,2187,594,2187,594,1107,2187,2187,2187
,168,558,2187,2187,567,1107,576,204,1098,576,204,1098,1134,576,1107,1
107,306,1134,747,1134,1134,2187,306,2187,2187,300,2187,576,594,1107,1
098,66.
(That should total 94,518 if I haven&#x27;t typed incorrectly.)
The corresponding 76 edge permutation isomorphism classes have 
respectively 
1,24,24,12,48,48,6,6,48,48,24,48,48,24,24,24,48,24,24,48,3,24,24,6,48
,48,12,12,24,48,12,48,24,48,48,48,48,12,48,12,24,48,48,48,3,12,48,48,
12,24,12,4,24,12,4,24,24,12,24,24,6,24,16,24,24,48,6,48,48,6,48,12,12
,24,24,1 members (totalling 2048 members - i.e. the 2048 edge 
permutations).
I didn&#x27;t really use anything complicated to get this - having got the 
2048 and 2187 edge and corner permutations you can put the edges 
trough Cube Explorer to get the 76 classes (although stupidly I went 
on to optimize them all individually instead of utilizing the 
isomorphism, exvept for the superflip as that optimization was 
already in the literature) and then for each of those concatenate 
with the 2187 corner orientations and pass each resulting set of 2187 
through Cube Explorer to get the 76 sets of representatives of the 
various sizes above (the union of these being a full set of 
representatives).

I&#x27;m not sure how many members the 94,518 classes have - but most will 
have the full 48 members because the average must be 2048*2187/94518 
which is 47.38755.
In fact since each equivalence class has n members where n divides 48 
and since at least 2 of the classes have just 1 member and since 
92106*48+2412*24=94518 and 93312*48=2187*2048 we can conclude that 
more than 92106 classes but less than 93312 classes have 48 members.
Probably it&#x27;s possible to easily tighten this somewhat, but I don&#x27;t 
really want to consider it at the moment.

          <div class="email-content">Hey Evan,

I assume you will be switching the yellow and blue faces?  If that&#x27;s 
not how your cube is set up then this should work anyway.

I got a giant cube a while ago but the color scheme was not what I 
was used to (two of the colors were switched) so I retiled it.  I&#x27;ve 
never retiled a deluxe, but I guess it should work the same way.

Basically what I used were an Xacto knife, small hand held power 
sander, and superglue to do it.

A big discussion came up a while ago on sticker switching theory, so 
to switch two faces you will only need to pry off 10 tiles in total, 
though you may also have to dissassemble your cube some.

If you are switching two adjacent faces, I assume this is the case, 
then turn your cube around so those two faces are F and R.  Now 
switch the following pairs of tiles:

A tile will be defined by describing the piece, but putting 
parenthesis around the actual sticker.  So (U)FR would be the U tile 
of the UFR corner.

Ok so switch:
(U)FR &lt;-> (D)FR
F center tile &lt;-> R center tile
(F)UL &lt;-> (R)UB
(F)L &lt;-> (R)B
(F)DL &lt;-> (R)DB

Now by disassembling your cube take out the entire FR row and flip 
it, then put it back in.

Now your cube is again solvable, and has the new color scheme.

--------

As far as the practical aspect goes, what I did with my cube was to 
pry the tiles off by slowly and repeatedly cutting at the point 
where the tile is glued to the corner.  You have to sort of saw at 
it from all 4 sides (it&#x27;s good to take the piece out of the cube to 
give you more room to move it around).  Try to do this gently, 
because when a piece comes off it usually pops off suddenly and 
forcefully, often breaking off a small piece of the center of the 
tile (on the bottom side so you usually won&#x27;t notice the effects of 
it on the tile).

Once you get all the tiles off take either some sandpaper or a small 
power sander and sand off the pieces of tile still stuck to each 
corner and edge cubie.  Once you&#x27;ve done that you can just glue the 
tiles back on like above.

------------

If you have to swap two opposite faces (say they are F and B), then 
just switch the F and B face stickers of the four corners, as well 
as the center pieces of each face.  No disassembly required here.

Hope this helps some,
Chris

I dont get it. U will have to remove/swap 8 corner tiles. And 
possible 2 center tiles unless the centercaps come off easily. So i 
thought u need to swap 8 or 10 tiles. Can&#x27;t see how the 4 comes 
up ... ???

That&#x27;s exactly what I have done, although I didn&#x27;t mention the 
camera part (I have a normal camcorder which can also be a webcam), 
and he said he had no idea. He said I could try to change the 
hardware, so I&#x27;m asking you guys if you had the same symptoms. For 
the moment I can&#x27;t change the camera, so....waiting for other 
messages.

Sebastian

Ouch! Why don&#x27;t you like to disassemble the center piece with the 
screw under the sticker?

          <div class="email-content">I doubt the webcam feature with Cube Explorer is in heavy use. Just 
input the cube configuration like you normally would, with the mouse 
you know. It would probably be a lot easier than to hustle around with

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

If u gonna practice for competition don&#x27;t bother about the 
minicube/eastsheen. It&#x27;s not allowed. Except maybe for Caltech 
competitions and unofficial ones :-( It can be tough to break in a 
rubiks.com 4x4x4 or 5x5x5. I have best results w petroleum-based 
silicone for these cubes. Lube once and then once more again a week 
later. But u better practice with them for a few weeks before doing 
so. Breaks in better that way :-) 

And if u get a 5x5x5 where u can adjust the screws then tighten them 
slightly in order to break in faster. U can also use that trick for 
3x3x3 studio cubes ;-) Just before lubing adjust the screws to fit ur 
cubing style.

          <div class="email-content">Hmm... from what i could see in Masayuki Akimoto´s WC2003-videos, 
there was someone who used a mini 5x5x5 in the official competition. 
Why wouldn´t they be allowed? They are very popular from what i´ve 
heard.

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

As long as the competition will be sponsored by Seventowns, worldwide 
distributors of puzzles under the Rubiks brand, the 
eastsheen/minicube (s) wont be allowed. This is because there is a 
copyright dispute between seventowns and the manufacturer of the 
eastsheen. So that whole matter has to do with money/politics. This 
is actually something that the up and coming WCA, world cubing 
association, should look into. Me and many others firmly believe that 
all kinda cubes should be allowed in competition as long as it&#x27;s not 
made for cheating, with motors or flashing hints or whatever ;-)

Some do prefer eastsheen for their smoothness. Some prefer rubiks.com 
cause its more forgiving with misalignment. It is well known that the 
eastsheens do lock quite a lot. How bad this is depends on ur 
technique. I used to prefer the eastsheen varieties, But also besides 
their locking i find they do actually pop quite a lot after weeks of 
heavy usage. And unlike rubiks.com cubes when they do pop they can 
pop really badly, lots of cubicles all over the floor ;-)

As far as i can see, at the moment mefferts sell only the minicube 
and the tiled variety which has (for me) an unusual colorscheme. How 
easy it is to swap the tiles i don&#x27;t know.

So unless u can borrow a cube and decide which one u like i would 
actually get both eastsheen and rubiks.com and see which one i like. 
If u can&#x27;t afford both i would go for rubiks.com varieties. Because i 
think they should be more durable. And as u get really fast u will 
appreciate the forgiveness they have to misalignment :-)

Good luck!

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

Step 1 is probably best left as an intuitive step.

For step 2 it could be left intuitive. This is maybe not such a good 
idea for a beginner. To make this step tabular would require very 
extensive tables. So maybe break it up into several substeps?

For step 3, if i understand correctly, u are gonna solve the DB edge 
and at the same time orient and position top layer corners. This 
should be in 2 steps. First the edge, then the corners. There are 
already tables for doing those corners : 

http://www.speedcubing.com/final_layer_corners.html

Step 4 might possibly also be divided into 2 steps. First the edge of 
last layer. Then the remaining edges. For final layer edges there are 
already complete tables :

http://rokumentai.akimoto3.com/GRSM-e4.htm

A better idea is perhaps to (after the 2 1x2x3 blocks to simple do 
those 2 remaining edges in one alg. (in order to complete f2l) Making 
up a complete table for this should not be so hard;-)

Sorry if i mess too much with ur original idea :-)

Best of luck!!

Yes i can only second that opinion !! :-) A good idea would be to

That was the instruction for the Rubiks.com/Revenge kinda 4x4x4, not 
the eastsheen/minicube. I did mention elsewhere in that post that for 
eastsheen u do it differently ...

Sorry if that was unclear to anyone :-o

Not quite sure which codec it is. But it worked fine with Media 
Player 9 under WinXP professional. I don&#x27;t think i have any other 
codecs but DivX with that particular installation.

Otherwise u can determine which codec is needed with the following 
application :

http://www.headbands.com/gspot/gspot221.exe

I take no responsibility for the name of that application, it&#x27;s not 
my creation ;-) (U can always rename it :D )

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per,

I did *not* misunderstand you. I&#x27;m talking about the Rubik one, too! I 
don&#x27;t have new rubiks.com 4x4s, but the four I have from the 80s all 
have a blue center piece with a sticker with something written on it. 
If you peel that sticker (just the sticker, not the piece) off, 
there&#x27;s a screw under it (i.e. &quot;inside&quot; the cubie piece). Drive the 
screw out and you can take the top part of the center piece away. Then 
the two edges right next to it can be taken out without any force and 
then all other cubies follow...

Are your Rubik&#x27;s 4x4s different?

Cheers!
Stefan

Very easy, especially if you start from the outside. If you only want 
to swap the centermost tile it&#x27;s a bit harder. A rectangular X-acto 
knife works very well. The glue isn&#x27;t very strong but the tiles are. 
Sometimes they fall off anyway without force (other than gravity ;-).

Hi Evan,

   A lot of other cubes have tiles that lay flay like stickers, but
the deluxe&#x27;s tiles fit into a trough.

   When I was thinking about getting the tiles off the centers (not
the edges or corners) so that I could adjust the screws it struck me
that the more evenly I could apply pressure to the tile the better. I
found a way to do this which works very well.

   I use a 5/8 inch wood chisel. (Note: wear work gloves and glasses
for protection).
   The first time I did it I worked the chisel under the edge of one
tile and then levered it gently up-and-down and left-and-right. It
took about 5 minutes of gently rocking under each edge of the white
center tile to get it off, but all the rest of the center tiles came
off easily. It&#x27;s important to work it fully under the edge first
(straight in), and do not over-flex the tile. The glue will break a
little at a time. 

   There&#x27;s a correct side and an incorrect side to do the prying on.
And there  are two ways to tell the proper side to try to lever up for
the centers. For the other cubies you can tell once you get the tiles
off one edge piece and one corner piece.

   If you already had a tile out - if you looked closely at the tile
and the trough in the cubie it fits into, you would see that the
underside of the tile has two straight edges across from one another,
and two sloped edges also across from one another - and the straight
edges and slopes fit neatly into straight and sloped sides in the trough.
  The glue is put on the sloped edges. You have to pry up the sloped
edge. If you try to pry up the straight edge you are working against
the structure of the piece and it can break. Sometime you can tell the
sloped edges of the tile from the top because of small indentations.

  The other way to tell going by the centers: if you look at the sides
of the center cubies (the cubie itself, not the tile) you&#x27;ll find
three smooth sides and one side with a line on it. The side with a
line has a straight edge (as does the opposite side) The two sloped
edges are on the left and right. In other words, don&#x27;t pry up the
center cubie&#x27;s tile from the side that has the line on it. I have one
Deluxe which doesn&#x27;t have these lines and I had to go by the
indentations which are faint.

   When you reglue the tiles, do not use epoxy because you&#x27;ll never
get it off again. I use Elmer&#x27;s glue.

**

Regarding which tiles to remove - in general you need to switch blue
and yellow to change from the old &quot;official&quot; color scheme to the new
&quot;official&quot; color scheme. Ive been using the old official scheme since
I started and have no need to switch. 

   Good Luck.

Aha!! I didn&#x27;t know that. I have an old broken revenge at home. 
Haven&#x27;t checked whether it has a screw beneath a blue sticker though. 
But the new Rubiks.com doesn&#x27;t have a screw anyway. I have 
restickered it completely so i should know ;-) Don&#x27;t u think it&#x27;s 
rougher to the cube to remove a sticker to have it lubed? I prefer 
the edge-pop regardless if my cube had a screw under one sticker. 
That&#x27;s just me ;-)

I was thinking that it doesn&#x27;t matter if I can use other options for 
inputting the position, I just wanted to know if the mistake comes 
from my computer, my camera, Cube Explorer itself or whatever else 
could be.
If a part of a program does not work, I suppose I should try to fix 
it, wouldn&#x27;t I?

i have is that i dont know where to start. my current methos is layer <br>

and it has vynal stickers in good condition and was in a plastic <br>

i mean but not having a logo bothers me I&#x27;m sure Ton know what i have <br>
as long as its real im happy its really smooth i dont think that it <br>

I do it this way:

and do following Alg ( turning &quot;U&quot; and &quot;D&quot; you can eighter only move 
the inner slice (u and d) or the inner and outer slice together ( Uu

This leaves a &quot;normal&quot; situation.


Hope this helps.

          <div class="email-content">Peeling off the sticker isn&#x27;t that bad. And at least on one of my
cubes they have 2 stickers there, on top of each other. I&#x27;d be more
worried about dis-/reassembling the cubie with the screw if I did it
very often. However, only one of my four cubes is loose enough to pop
edges without force, and I just don&#x27;t like force, so that&#x27;s why I
don&#x27;t do it your way ;-)

This is a modification of the 4x4 orientation parity fix on Chris
Hardwick&#x27;s page, which is:
(Rr)2 B2 U2 (Ll) U2 (Rr)&#x27; U2 (Rr) U2 F2 (Rr) F2 (Ll)&#x27; B2 (Rr)2

Just leave out the B2 at start and end. It also swaps the UL and UR
edge triple and swaps the UFL and UFR corners. If these side effects
are still too bad for you, then try the &quot;pure&quot; version:
(Rr)2 U2 l U2 r&#x27; U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l&#x27; (Rr)2

Is that ok?

 <br>
Hi Sam, welcome back,<br>
I would personnally (notice the word personnally) recommend (if you really want to learn &quot;the one and only&quot; Fridrich method, and not some kind of VH or something in that direction) learning a few PLL&#x27;s first, but as your current method is pretty different from Fridrich, I guess you&#x27;ll have to learn a few OLL&#x27;s too at the very beginning.<br>
So I think you can do it in the following order (of course it&#x27;s up to you, you mustn&#x27;t do it that way, but I think it&#x27;s what would have worked best with me):<br>
1st of all, learn all the PLLs that move only corners or only edges around. Of course start with the 3-cycles, so you can always solve every LL once it&#x27;s oriented. Then I would recommend learning one case for orienting 2 opposite edges, 2 adjacent edges, and 4 edges. I would learn the ones that only orient edges because I feel it helps me with recognition, since I know which corners I&#x27;ll have to orient afterwards, but you can also learn algs that disturb corners, if you find them easier to remember. For instance when I get to a case where I have to orient 2 opposite edges, and the corners are all messed up, I prefer using RUR&#x27;U&#x27;M&#x27;URU&#x27;R&#x27; (M moves in the same direction as L) than FRUR&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27; because I can plan my orientation of the corners while I&#x27;m doing it. And I know they are not going to move at all, while I don&#x27;t know what would happen if I did the 2nd alg. But that&#x27;s maybe just me.<br>
Once you get there, you know all the needed OLLs to orient the LL in 2 looks everytime (please stop me if I forgot something, but if I did forget something, the goal is a 2-look OLL, so you just have to add the eventual cases I forgot. However I don&#x27;t think I forgot anything).<br>
Then finish learning the rest of the PLL&#x27;s, starting with the weird cases first (the ones I was talking about before) if you haven&#x27;t done it yet, then the rest of the possible cases.<br>
Ok, now let&#x27;s talk about the F2L. One day when you have some free time, just sit down for a while, and solve the cross (wherever you want to hold the cross, I personnally prefer cross on the left, some like it on the bottom, or on the right if you&#x27;re lefty, only please, not on the top!). Then look at any of the corners you want to solve first, find the corresponding edge and try to pair them up and insert them. Without doing it &quot;layer-by-layer&quot;-style. Just take some time to figure them and working them out once at a time (or 2 at a time with mirrors). It&#x27;s ALWAYS better than learning algs from anywhere, no matter how good the alg is. You&#x27;ll always be faster with &quot;your&quot; alg because you know how it works. Doug Reed wrote a page about the art of solving F2L intuitively, you can use it if you want but I&#x27;m sorry I forgot the URL. Doug?<br>
Ok, now you&#x27;re maybe thinking it&#x27;s going to take you a lot of time (it will indeed) to learn each and every alg, all the PLLs and the OLLs and finding the F2L cases by yourself, but lemme tell you what. I haven&#x27;t figured (and don&#x27;t intend to in the immediate future) a few of the F2L cases. I still don&#x27;t know all the PLLs (yeah please Doug I hear you laughing at me). Not speaking of the OLLs. Some of them take me forever to solve, and the rest takes me twice as much. Do you know how fast I am? sub-20 (Doug shut up). So, don&#x27;t be discouraged, it&#x27;s maybe going to take a while, but I bet once you get passed the trouble of switching to another method (took me about one week to get used to the concept of &quot;orient all-permute all&quot;), you&#x27;re going to improve very fast. Faster than you think. For the mental part of the thing, try to keep in mind the times you achieved the same day one week before. You&#x27;ll find it pretty amazing.<br>
Just my (very long) 2 cents,<br>
François<br>
PS. btw, Sam, ever heard of the period key? it&#x27;s somewhere near to the right shift button. You have kind of a longish style... Could replace lots of &quot;and&quot; with a simple period... Anyway.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey thanks a lot for that. I really appreciate the effort. So learn <br>
the PLL first right? I already use the 3 cycle edge to finish almost <br>
all the time. I just like the way it feels so i already got that. I&#x27;m <br>
just not sure if i want to have F2L on bottom or left since i have it <br>
on the top now thats just not gonna work lol. I&#x27;m just gonna see what <br>
feels right in a few days and start working on that. If I do have it <br>
on the left tho then I still have to rotate in in order to do the ll <br>
or not? Do you just learn the algs from the left side or what? Oh and <br>
about my  run on typing thats how i think so i jsut kinda let it flow <br>
you know what i mean? My teachers get all on my case for that but you <br>
know its jsut how i am and im not a strong writer anyways math and <br>
sciece are my strong points. I would never even dream of writing for <br>
a living lol. I&#x27;m gonna end up with a degree in Electronic <br>
Engineering not Journalism. thanks again!<br>

just a set of megaminx tiles, it sounds like they will be available <br>
again.  Mefferts.com just recently sent out one of their new product <br>
pre-release e-mails, and one of these puzzles is the 12-color tiled <br>
megaminx, which would sell for the normal megaminx price of $28 USD <br>
(free shipping).  I don&#x27;t have the e-mail with me at the moment, but <br>
it listed a URL that you could go to in order to indicate your <br>
interest in buying the puzzles (if someone else has and could post <br>
that URL, other people can go there, too).<br>
<br>
Assuming these tiles are the same as the old ones, they are good <br>
quality tiles, and add a great finished look to the puzzle. I sent <br>
Uwe Meffert a private e-mail, and he said that he would again be <br>
willing to sell the tile sets at cost for $12 USD, with their <br>
standard deal of free shipping everywhere.  If you are interested in <br>
buying the tiles, but not the puzzle, I recommend you let him know <br>
that as well, since the production of this puzzle is reliant upon <br>
there being sufficient demand to warrant the production run.  You can <br>
contact him by e-mail at mefferts@... (remove <br>
MEGAMINX from the address before sending).  Enjoy!!<br>

Hi Grant,<br>
<br>
Thanks for the Megaminx tip.  I had never even SEEN one before RWC <br>
Toronto and haven&#x27;t ever come across one in any store.  It looks <br>
like the kind of puzzle that I would just love.<br>
<br>
On a different topic: was that a Mefferts 5x5x5 that you (and I <br>
believe David) were using in Toronto?  I remember it being noticably <br>
smaller with a distinctive light blue colour on one face.  I just <br>
figured that if I was already going to order a megaminx I might as <br>
well pick up one of those 5x5x5 as well.<br>

I believe that u mean Fermat&#x27;s famous Last Theorem. There is also a 
fabulous book that i have read about it (i read it in norwegian). U 
can have a look at amazon :

Never mind if u don&#x27;t understand all the maths mentioned. Neither did

Hello,

This is the Great Fermat&#x27;s theorem - it says that A^n+B^n=C^n is 
false for any n>2, with of course A, B and C integers. I&#x27;ve read 
about it being proved - in I think 1996 - by Andrew Wiles, an 
English mathematician. The proof is very very complicated, with 
curves in space and so on. And he&#x27;s surely the first to have proven 
it. There were some early proofs for special cases, but Wiles proved 
the general case. The case n=4 is really easy, I can do it, I 
haven&#x27;t tried but I&#x27;ve seen the proof in an elementary mathematics 
book. Who wants to try?

Sebastian

          <div class="email-content">I agree, that is a very good book describing the history of Fermat&#x27;s 
last theorem and how it was proved.  I definitely recommend it.

As for the Riemann Hypothesis.... that stinks lol.

Oh well, I&#x27;ve had math professors tell me that stuff like this 
happens all the time.  Someone comes up with a proof, think it&#x27;s 
right but then they missed something or some error can&#x27;t be 
reconciled from the peer evaluation stage and it&#x27;s all for naught.

I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath if I were you.  There&#x27;s apparently a counter-example 
to his method (and which was known years before his paper too). Louis de 
Branges is apparently well-known for coming up with flawed proofs, although 
he actually did prove a big result called the Bierbach conjecture which has 
meant people need to take him more seriously than the average guy who has 
presented several flawed proofs. (Apparently for a long time his genuine proof 
wan&#x27;t checked because of this reputation, but it seems safe to say that in the 
case of RH a counterexample to his technique is a fairly final way to end it.)

On the other result mentioned in this thread, namely that if a^n+b^n=c^n 
where a,b,c, n are integers n>=3 then abc=0, Andrew Wiles&#x27; first attempted 
proof was flawed. Apparently the amended proof also had a flaw but this ws 
subsequently fixed - that latter information is less well known, but I have it on 
good authority from some number theory professors with whom I was at 
university when we were all grad students,

I don&#x27;t imagine the Riemann hypothesis will be resolved during my lifetime - 
it&#x27;s already been considered one of the outstanding outstanding (!) problems 
in mathematics - but then again, the Poincare conjecture was done recently 
so who knows?

&gt; noticably smaller with a distinctive light blue colour on one<br>
&gt; face.  I just figured that if I was already going to order a<br>
&gt; megaminx I might as well pick up one of those 5x5x5 as well.<br>
<br>
I like your attitude - you may as well!!  :-P  The 5x5x5 I used (and <br>
I believe you are right that David did as well) is one of two types <br>
of 5x5x5 cubes sold at mefferts.  They sell one that is very similar <br>
(size, weight, and mechanics) to a Rubik&#x27;s brand 5x5x5, and then they <br>
sell the EastSheen cube, which, as you noted, is smaller and has <br>
different shades of the standard colors. Vastly different, though, is <br>
the purple which takes the place of orange.<br>
<br>
These cubes may not turn as well as you would like at first (but then <br>
again, there were days when we didn&#x27;t expect new puzzles to turn <br>
nicely right away), but just a little bit of lube, and they work <br>
wonderfully.  Because they don&#x27;t have any springs in them, they are <br>
less forgiving than their counterparts (therefore finger tricks are <br>
harder), but they move much more smoothly in general, and I dare-say <br>
will never pop (though it may be possible if you manage to leave a <br>
side inadequately tightened).  They are much lighter in weight than <br>
the Rubik&#x27;s variety and easier on the fingers/hands/wrists, and I <br>
highly recommend them.  However, from past discussions, I don&#x27;t know <br>
if these will be allowed in future &quot;official&quot; competitions...  I&#x27;m a <br>
little bit behind on my reading, though, so I&#x27;m not sure if that <br>
conversation came to a different conclusion (or any conclusion at <br>
all).<br>
<br>
Just be sure that if this is the 5x5x5 you want, you get the &quot;Mini <br>

It started when I printed out the ZB CEpair alg list.<br>
I noticed that the list wasn&#x27;t complete, all the mirror cases were<br>
missing. I could apply the mirror case to the cube easily, but that<br>
still didn&#x27;t make it any less annoying to me.<br>
<br>
This program now takes any algorithm (using definable notations)  <br>
and can rotate it and mirror it to any of the 48 possible symmetries,<br>
plus a couple of other fun functions (like slice and rotation removal<br>
or the quick input)<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s still under construction,  but I haven&#x27;t had much time to<br>
complete it, and I don&#x27;t think I will anytime soon. So I decided to<br>
post it and get it out in the open for people to use. <br>
<br>
It can be found at<br>
http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~tjfox/<br>
(I hope my permissions work)<br>
<br>
Tell me what you think!<br>

I&#x27;ll still never forget the video where you were cooking the cube 
and had it on the cutting board.  Each time you hit the cube with 
the knife the camera showed pieces flying everywhere :-D  Absolutely 
classic :)

As always, your videos are very, very cool!

          <div class="email-content">Thanks to some great work by Gustav Fredell I have been able to improve the<br>
L2L4 strategy significantly.<br>
<br>
The whole strategy looks much more viable now.  After completing the top<br>
layer the four L2L steps take an average 38 moves.  My own view is that 15<br>
moves is an achievable average for the top layer making the whole strategy<br>
53 moves.<br>
By coincidence the number of algorithms to learn is also 53.<br>
<br>
Not wanting to make too great a claim I would say that 17 moves for the top<br>
layer is easily achievable without any particularly special tricks so that a<br>
55 move average solve is my worst case estimate for the method.<br>
<br>
I have updated the sites with the new L2L4 moves as well as 5 of Gustav&#x27;s<br>
files that contain many alternatives that you may want to look at in order<br>
to optimise the choice of algorithms that suit you.<br>
<br>
Hope this all works and good luck to anyone who wants to try learning this<br>
method.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I have a question about teaching the cube using commutators, namely <br>
what is an easy way to get the method of using commutators for all <br>
the steps across to someone who is totally new to the cube?<br>
<br>
I read this website about 6 months ago<br>
http://www.mindspring.com/~alanh/rubikpuzzles.html<br>
<br>
which was one of the main stepping stones for me to really get a <br>
firm grasp of using commutators.  I remember reading this site a few <br>
years ago as well, when I had just started the cube, and I remember <br>
finding it very confusing and I never really looked into it.<br>
<br>
I was thinking that a good, albeit slow, method of solving would be <br>
to teach someone a sighted version of the blindfolded method using <br>
only commutators.  The reason I thought of this is that most of the <br>
people who I have taught how to do the cube have only wanted to <br>
learn how to do it and were not interested in speed solving.  When I <br>
did teach them how to do it using relatively few algorithms I <br>
usually find that a few months later they don&#x27;t remember how to <br>
solve the cube.<br>
<br>
I was thinking, if you teach only 1 concept, namely commutators, <br>
then people who just want to learn the solve the cube would only <br>
have to remember one thing, then they could achieve their goal of <br>
solving the cube.  Also later on they would be less likely to forget <br>
how to solve it, since the commutator concept would be so ingrained <br>
in them from having used it so many times when they were learning to <br>
solve the cube.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m kind of at a loss as to how to approach this method in a non-<br>
technical way though.<br>
<br>
Here is an example (I know this message is getting long, so I <br>
apologize):<br>
<br>
The corner flip move F&#x27;D2FLD2L&#x27; flips UFL counter clockwise, then <br>
you could turn U to put some other corner in UFL and do LD2L&#x27;F&#x27;D2F <br>
to flip it clockwise, then undo your U move to complete the <br>
commutator sequence and you&#x27;ve flipped two corners (yay).<br>
<br>
However I&#x27;ve tried to teach people this move many times, and in <br>
general I have a very hard time getting them to even remember to <br>
turn only the U face when trying to flip the next corner, rather <br>
than the whole cube.  Also I have found that most don&#x27;t understand <br>
how the alg itself actually flips the corner.<br>
<br>
So anyway I was thinking of approaching it like that site above <br>
does, saying the you have some algorithm X and some slice move s <br>
(not another algorithm, but just a slice or face turn) and that way <br>
you would simplify things a bit.  But I&#x27;ve had so much trouble in <br>
the past trying to convey how this concept works, which I assume is <br>
also in part due to my failure to get the concept across well.<br>
<br>
So anyway I figured if several people work on this then we can <br>
probably come up with a good, clear, easy to remember way to teach <br>
commutators to beginners.<br>
<br>
That way the solving method would consist of 4 steps, same as in BLD <br>
cubing, namely permute all corners, permute all edges, orient all <br>
corners, orient all edges.<br>
<br>
I think it would be easiest to have both orientation steps at the <br>
end of the solve when all pieces are correctly permuted, but other <br>
than that there is a lot of freedom to this method.  I admit that it <br>
would be slow, but people who don&#x27;t have the motivation for <br>
speedcubing, only to solve it a few times and know how to solve it <br>
every time, would find it easy to remember.<br>
<br>
If anyone has read this far, thanks for reading and I would <br>
appreciate any help on this.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

I can&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s so bad to teach beginners a &quot;commutator 
framework&quot; for solving the (3x3x3) cube. Just like some like tea and 
some like coffee, i believe ppl like different approaches to the 
cube. Some like to explore the cube by themselves and not to be tied 
up with any theory or guidelines from the outset. Whereas others will 
gain great insight by understanding pure commutators, 3-cycles, 
conjugated 3-cycles and so on. Well at least ppl will understand more 
of the cube by studying commutators than by learning fridrich with 
complete set of OLL and PLL and so on. Then again, some just wanna 
solve the d*** thing. Others wanna understand. If ppl wanna learn 
larger cubes after learning and mastering 3x3x3 i think they are much 
better equipped if they understand commutators inside/out. Then there 
would be nothing new to learn really. Maybe except the parity fix. If 
they on the other side however only know about fridrich (or an 
other &quot;tabular method&quot; for 3x3x3) they would have to learn quite a 
lot of new stuff. First to fix the centers. Then how to pair up 
edges. Then it&#x27;s back to the basic 3x3x3 they know already. Well, 
anyway, im about to publish my &quot;commutator way&quot; of solving the 5x5x5 
(and 4x4x4) cube. My approach makes it possible for a person with no 
previous knowledge of the 3x3x3 (or 4x4x4 for that matter) cube to 
deal with solving that cube in a way that requires hardly any 
algorithms to memorise. For fair optimisation i use about maybe 10 
algs that are not commutator-based. Teaching ppl how to solve the 
cube w commutators seems to me like a good idea. Sure, there is no 
replacement for learning it all by urself, like i did in 1981. Those 
who don&#x27;t manage that or wanna speed up the way to their first 
successful solve should have as many options of learning the cube(s) 
open to them :-)

Happy commutating :-P

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

   I tell people &quot;What you do to one, you undo to another.&quot;

   I also show them the right-handed algorithm R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;
followed by the left-handed verion of the same algorithm  L&#x27; U&#x27; L U&#x27;
L&#x27; U2 L does the same thing as the commutator you gave.

   The sequence I use on the LL is Permute Corners, orient corners,
orient edges, permute edges. I find it much easier to get the corners
right then the edges. It just seems far easier to move the edges
around with all the corners in place than vice versa. It might just be
that I&#x27;m used to doing it that way.

   Regards,

   David J

          <div class="email-content">Not sure whether you understood what I was suggesting. I&#x27;m not against
commutators. Not even against teaching a newbie how to solve the cube 
using commutators. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the very first thing they 
should learn.

What I suggested is first layer intuitive-style so that people get 
used to the cube and then finish the rest (the last two layers) using 
commutators, *not* Fridrich style. Pretty much exactly what Gilles 
describes on his page.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan :-)

Yes, then i think i have misunderstood ur previous posting. Got the 
impression that it was a bad idea to teach beginners commutators at 
all, regardless which part of the cube or stage of solution. And in 
fact i think both u and me, and Gilles and Chris also, agree that 
showing first layer w commutators is a very bad idea. Not only is it  
very counterproductive to do so. A person, IMHO, will have no chance 
to master the cube if that person can&#x27;t do the first layer on his or 
her own. The rest of the cube is a bit different cause u have 
to &quot;destroy and restore again&quot; in order to be productive. This is 
actually where most ppl trying the cube fail to be successful and to 
proceed.

Happy cubing!

          <div class="email-content">I have read many posts looking for the orange.  Perhaps an 
electrical supply shop would be the place to start.  At my former 
job, we got all our 3M brand electrical tape from a typical 
electrcian supply.  They had just about every color you could think 
of including orange.  The rolls are more expensive and much better 
quality than the typical home depot brand (although home depot does 
have this type as well).  The tape also comes in a plastic container 
suitable for use to hold small screws, etc when working on a 
project.  I use them to store rivets, and other such items in my 
tool box.  The cost is minimal but far more than the 50 cents per 
roll you pay for the cheap home depot stuff.

that would allow bigger dots and more glue.

This is a good link. Might not be related though... (although you

Hi Grant and Chris,

Thanks for the link to the Mefferts puzzle preview.  As I mentionned 
before I have long been keen to get my hands on a 12 colour 
megaminx.  I followed the link and submitted an e-mail address as 
soon as the posting went up but I have not heard anything since.  
(more than a week)  Any idea what is going on?  Presumably they want 
to know the demand for quantities and that&#x27;s why they are doing it 
this way but surely they will want to collect some money for it.  

Or am I doing it wrong? -- is the link not the final stage?  Do I 
need to go through their website to select the puzzle in addition to 
indicating interest on the preview forum????

I just don&#x27;t want to miss this opportunity to get a cool puzzle.

I also remember from previous posts (6-8 months ago) that Mefferts 
was much faster with one payment method over another but I can&#x27;t 
remember if Paypal was the fast way to go or if it was slow through 
Paypal but fast if directly charged to a credit card.  Any hints on 
this question would also be very much appreciated.

Thanks

Rob

          <div class="email-content">I did a search in Google News for &quot;rubik&#x27;s cube&quot; to see if there <br>
were any interesting cube articles. There was a long list, but many <br>
of the articles were not actually about cubes, they just happened to <br>
be using &#x27;Rubik&#x27;s Cube&#x27; as a metaphor.<br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s one that caught my attention: &quot;It&#x27;s a seven-sided Rubik&#x27;s <br>
Cube, a problem with no solution.&quot; I didn&#x27;t bother to read the <br>
article beyond this sentence because it clearly wasn&#x27;t actually <br>
about cubes, but I thought it was interesting that cubes are so <br>
frequently used as metaphors.<br>
<br>
It also started me thinking about whether there is a seven-sided <br>
Rubiks-like puzzle (I couldn&#x27;t think of one). If there is, it&#x27;s <br>
obviously not a &quot;cube&quot; as the author of the article states. Perhaps <br>
the writer should have said &quot;It&#x27;s like a Rubik&#x27;s Cube that&#x27;s had a <br>
single edge reversed, a problem with no solution.&quot; Although, <br>
obviously there is a solution, which is to rip the piece out and fix <br>
it, but I think you know what I mean. ;)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I love think Geek!  If I had the money, pretty much all my clothes 
would come from there.

I have one pi shirt already: &quot;Got Milk, Need Pi&quot;  and then on the 
back it has many digits of pi in a circle.

I also have one listing my favorite physics equations.

I think I saw the Maxwell&#x27;s equation shirt in the MIT bookstore (I 
was just visiting).  Almost bought it myself.

Talk about geeky though, the state fair is in town and they have lots 
of those Henna Tattoo places, and I was looking for something to get 
(my girlfriend really wants one and wants me to get one too).  And I 
figure since it not permanent, what the heck.  Well I stumbled across 
this site: http://www.bmezine.com/tattoo/geek001.html  and now I have 
all kinds of ideas.  No Rubik&#x27;s cube themed ones though.  Any artists 
willing to come up with a neat monochrome rubik&#x27;s cube tat that I 
could take to the henna artist?  I&#x27;d do it myself, but I have the 
artistic talent of an epileptic weasle.

Thanks,
Daniel

(BTW, I did consider getting logarithmic scales on the insides of my 
forearms so I could use them as a slide rule... but that seems a bit 
cumbersome.)

Sadly i don&#x27;t have any cube related t-shirt. There was suppposed to 
be a t-shirt for EC in Amsterdam, but the sponsors didn&#x27;t keep their 
promise to come up with them. I would have gladly paid for one. No 
need for it to be free. Maybe i better have one made with ABA&#x27;B&#x27; 
(commutator) printed on it ... lol ... :-P

Those who know how i solve larger cubes should know how i love to 
make up commutators (3-cycles) ... hehe ... ;-)

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

Myself i would definitely use superglue ... only 2 small drops is 
needed. Only glue at one edge. If the gap is big enough try with a 
narrow strip of paper between the cap and the center itself. Whether 
it should go the whole way around or only half way depends on the 
gap and the thickness of the paper. But superglue is simplest ;-) 
Just dont use it all the way round.

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

At first use a sharp flat knife to scrape off any molding 
imperfections. Then lune the cube. Use quite a lot first time u lube 
it. There has been many posts how to do it so i won&#x27;t go into 
detail. If the cube is still stiff/tight u can try with sandpaper. 
Or if possible adjust tension if your cube has adjustable screws. 
With one layer taken off the cube u should be able to see where the 
pieces are too tightly stuck together. Usually it should be enough 
to sand the edges. First sand slightly on the 2 smallest sides of 
the feet of the edges. The ones who are probably a bit curvy. Do the 
sadning so that u preserve this curvyness. Only sand a little at the 
time. If the cube gets too loose it will pop quite easily. Every 
time u sand u need to wash/clean the pieces. Dry them and relube the 
cube. 

Good luck!!

   Just like he says it is the easiest and the
quickest - I just ended up putting little dots on each
extended piece of plastic on each cap.
   Has anyone found that there is a particular
direction/way to put your center in?  I noticed with
mine (and I know no cube is perfect) but I had to have
each center in a certain way or itself wasn&#x27;t center
and I would have an overhang on one side.

I tried to use Elmer&#x27;s glue (not as strong), and it kinda worked.  
I&#x27;m afraid of using superglue too as you may not get it off.

I had to switch the caps around to get a good fit too.  Rotating and 
trying different ones on different sides seems to help with the edge 
overhang.  

Overall, I pretty much like it though...

Hi Rommy,

    I made the mistake of using superglue and now I can&#x27;t adjust that
cube. I now use Elmers. I&#x27;ve heard of using small magnets under the
cap, but never tried it.

I&#x27;ve seen some stuff like that before.
When I was in my youth I had myself a custom T-shirt made with the 
axioms of ZFC set theory in first order logic. (Probably not long 
after I won Geek Site Of The Day for having the same on my web page.)
I often regretted not getting the NBG axioms done for the back, but 
I only gave the printers the one set of axioms at the time.

If you want to see the scrambled 3x3x5 (and you should if you 
haven&#x27;t seen one before!), you&#x27;ll have to paste the entire URL into 
the browser.

Does anyone know if there is a way to prevent the URL being broken 
up when posted?

I don&#x27;t understand how the extra cubies turn.  Could you make a

That would be a cuboid rather than a cube - at least when solved.

          <div class="email-content">There are two types of 3x3x5 cuboids (thanks GoD2 for the 
correction ;) The one I bought recently from rubiks.com is basically 
as you describe - a regular 3x3x3 with 9 extra cubies glue to 
opposite sides. Therefore, it&#x27;s the same mechanics as a regular 
3x3x3, it just looks really cool. The only thing that makes it more 
difficult to solve is that it&#x27;s an awkward shape, but obviously all 
the same 3x3x3 algorithms can be used.

Fully functioning 3x3x5 cuboids do exist, but I don&#x27;t have one of 
these. Ton had one at the US Nationals so I had a play with it 
there. It was more difficult than my 3x3x5 because it was almost 
more like a 5x5x5 with a few layers removed, rather than being like 
a 3x3x3 with some extra cubies glued on. I can solve the 5x5x5, but 
I found the fully functioning 3x3x5 quite confusing when I first 
played with it!!

In answer to your other question, I have some very basic video 
capabilities (just whatever my digital camera can manage) so I&#x27;ll 
see what I can do about making a short scrambling video.

U can do high quality videos with a very basic web-camera. Much 
higher quality than the broadcasted quality. Just a hint ;-) Hmm ... 
as long as ur pc is any good for editing that is :-)

You can look under the &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube-aholics&quot; blogring (bottom left) 
as well as my subscripitions to find some other cubers&#x27; xangas.

When I have to post long URLS, I try to use tinyurl (www.tinyurl.com)

The result is something like this: http://tinyurl.com/4p537

just read this:

Tu aideras a rappeler ta quantite a beaucoup de docteurs amis.
2.7182818284...
Japanese has a much, much cleverer (??) way of memorizing it.

Do you (or anybody else?) happen to know what this cleverer way is 
supposed to be?

Oh, forgot to say: Jasmine, great pics! I wish I had one of those, I 
guess you can drive people mad with it much more easily than even with 
a 5x5x5.

memorize all 41 or whatever algorithms..it was just too much..so i<br>
started trying to figure out exactly what was going on, so i could do<br>
it intuitively.<br>
<br>
right now, i can do a bunch of cases without trouble..and i have been<br>
going over doug reed&#x27;s f2l page http://68.206.7.186/~doug/f2l/f2l.htm<br>
<br>
he shows 3 main cases and then 6 cases that you arrange to make the<br>
original 3 cases.. however<br>
<br>
i almost never get Any of the 9 cases shown on his site... can somoene<br>
else help me do this without memorizing all the algs..some tips or<br>
something..<br>
<br>
one thing i do is, say you solved the cross on the bottom, and then a<br>
corner peice you need is on the bottom, i usually move that peice up<br>
to the top layer and then look at what case i have..<br>
<br>
i dunno if thats a bad habit, but looking at the corner edge peices<br>
when their on the top layer is more comfortable for me..<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

Everything there is mine. Feel free to laugh. =D

I was talking about this:
funahitohachihutahachihitohachihutahachi
2.7 1   8    2   8    1   8    2   8...
When written in katakana (the phonetical letters in Japanese) this 
becomes 19 letters, and 9 when written in kanji.

Masayuki posted something about this a couple of months ago, but I&#x27;ll 
explain anyways:
The reason why Japanese is such a useful language for mnemonics is 
because each number can be represented by one or two letter, and many 
different letters can be used to represent the same number. For any 
given string of numbers, you can usually make enough sense out that 
you can recite it by trying different combinations. Because it&#x27;s 
memorized phonetically, just by repeating the phrase you memorized, 
you can easily recall the numbers; you don&#x27;t have to count how many 
letters there are in each word.Here are some well-known examples. I 
think in Japan anyone who has even the smallest interest in math 

knows these:
(each set of sounds used to represent a number is surrounded by &#x27;)
san&#x27;i&#x27;shi&#x27;i&#x27;ko&#x27;ku&#x27;ni&#x27;mu&#x27;kou.san&#x27;go&#x27;ya&#x27;ku&#x27;na&#x27;ku&#x27;san&#x27;ji&#x27;sa&#x27;ya&#x27;shi&#x27;ro&#x27;ni&#x27;
mu&#x27;shi&#x27;san&#x27;san&#x27;ya&#x27;mi&#x27;ni&#x27;na&#x27;ku.
pi=3.141592653589793238462643383279...

hito&#x27;yo&#x27;hito&#x27;yo&#x27;ni&#x27;hito&#x27;mi&#x27;go&#x27;ro
sqrt(2)=1.41421356...

hito&#x27;na&#x27;mi&#x27;ni&#x27;o&#x27;go&#x27;re&#x27;ya&#x27;o&#x27;na&#x27;go
sqrt(3)=1.7320508075...

fu&#x27;ji&#x27;san&#x27;ro&#x27;ku&#x27;o&#x27;mu&#x27;na&#x27;ku
sqrt(5)=2.2360679...

These are just some typical ways in which each number can be 
pronounced:
1: i, ichi, hito
2: ni, hu, huta
3: sa, san, mi
4: shi, yo, yon
5: go, i (can also be 1, so you just have to memorize which one you 
assigned it as), itsu
6: mu, ro, roku
7: na, nana (no, it won&#x27;t be mistaken for 77)
8: hachi, ya
9: ku, kyu
10: tou, jyuu
0: rei, zero, o

Yeah, there are like all kinds of mnemonics to memorize all kinds of 
historical dates, etc, for exams. 

When blindfold cubing, I always memorize my EP in Japanese (and 
everything else by sight). However, the longer the string numbers you 
are trying to memorize, the harder it is to come up with a good 
phrase. It doesn&#x27;t really help much if you&#x27;re trying to solve a 5x5x5 
blindfolded. ;D

Hmm, I hope that made sense.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I found a cool game online and thought I would share.  It is a <br>
series of mazes and you have to use the mouse to move a marker <br>
through the maze , around obstacles, etc..<br>
<br>
The catch is that all the mouse movements are reversed.  To move up <br>
you have to move the cursor down, and vice versa, and to move left <br>
you have to move the cursor right, and vice versa.<br>
<br>
Kind of reminds me of mirror cubing.  With a little practice you get <br>
used to thinking of the movements the new way and don&#x27;t have to <br>
convert them over in your head.  There are only 20 levels, but see <br>
how well you can do, it&#x27;s fun!<br>
<br>
Also going back to using the mouse normally afterward feels kinda <br>
cool too :)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I have gotten accustomed to move corner pieces and edge pieces into 
the top layer so that they immediately end up in one of the 3 main 
cases you mention (3? I count 2?). I wouldn&#x27;t worry about that too 
much, especially not until you can solve the F2L good enough.

As for the actual algs, well, I feel I can&#x27;t help you out a lot 
without going into specifics on each particular case.

You already have the two basic cases, that can be solved using a 
maximum of 4 moves. So just as Doug says you have to transform your 
case into one of these and then solve it. Some cases are easy to 
transform, others not so.

The transforms usually involve &quot;hiding&quot; one piece away by doing, say, 
R. This assumes that the unsolved C/E pair is in FR, because it it 
wasn&#x27;t you&#x27;d be messing up your already solved F2L pairs. Anyway, 
after doing the R you have hidden away the corner for a while (if it 
was in UBR, it&#x27;ll now be in DBR), and then do a turn with the U layer. 
It may be U, U&#x27; or U2. Then undo your hiding turn, you will now have a 
different case.

Learn now to &quot;hide&quot; both corners and edges. Also, learn how to &quot;hide&quot; 
the edge while simultaneously twisting the corner about. Say, for 
example, that you had the corner at UFR and the edge at UR, now if you 
did R (hide the edge AND twist the corner), U&#x27; (move the corner 
around), R&#x27; (get the edge back into sight), you will have not only 
changed the pieces locations but also the orientation of the corner.

Another thing to notice is which layers you actually need to use to 
solve a given case. If the edge is in the U layer you can turn it 
around until it &quot;matches&quot; either the F or R center piece (assuming you 
are solving the FR C/E pair). If it matches the R center piece you&#x27;ll 
be able to solve it using exclusively using R and U moves. If it 
matches the F center piece you&#x27;ll be able to solve it with F and U.

I don&#x27;t have proof for that claim though, but I can&#x27;t see what could 
possibly be wrong about it.

If the edge is not in the U layer, it will be either completely 
solved, or solved but flipped, right? In the former case, you can 
solve it using R OR F, and U. In the latter case you must use all 
three.

It is not thereby said that using the lowest-generator solutions are 
always the most efficient way (say, you could do a case using only R 
and U, but it MIGHT be faster if you also allowed yourself to use F), 
but generally you will want 2-generators.

Hope this helped a little. :)

Dunno why, but i suddenly recalled an old classic game : Klotski. The 
object of the game is to free the red brick from the &quot;blue box&quot; and 
put it in the area with the other small red bricks. The last level 
takes ages to do. Have a look at this picture to realise why :

http://vakt.idi.ntnu.no/cube/Klotski.gif

U can download klotski from here :

http://www.thegamesforum.com/Assets/Games/Win31/Klotski/Klotski.zip

This is a really old win3.1 game so the window doesn&#x27;t move so nicely.
Have fun playing it :-)

  I also use colored electrical tape and love it!  Just yesterday I 
made a keychain half-truncated cube and used electrical tape for the 
stickers, looks great.
  I have found that home depot carries many colors of electrical

cubes of each color though.  I also came across this website:

http://www.identi-tape.com/

That has about a million different colors and styles of tape.

Just curious Jasmine, how do you go about cutting the stickers?  The 
process I use is very painstaking.  I use a seamstress&#x27;s rotary 
cutter and a template I made on my computer.  Thanks for the link to

          <div class="email-content">Hey all,
 
I&#x27;ve used electrical tape for a long time as well, and it does work nicely!  I re- stickered my eastsheen 5x5 week before last, and i think it looks very good.  When I resticker, I place a strip of tape on the cube and cut the squares with an exacto knife.  When I did my 5x5, the strip of tape was wide enough to cover 2 rows, so that made it really easy.  In fact, you can put 5 strips on the cube, and then use a ruler to trim a straight lines and re sticker rather quickly.  I only restickered 4/6 sides, since the white and yellow faces were in great shape, but it only took maybe 20 minutes.

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

It took me only about 30 minutes to resticker 5 sides on a Rubiks.com 
5x5x5 cube. I used their replacement stickers, but i applied them one 
by one cause i have bad experience using the applicator sheet. U 
never get it quite straight :-o The replacement stickers are quite 
good, except i prefer a brighter orange.

I never tried electrical tape cause i can&#x27;t find the brands 
mentioned. And in norway we dun have have the same stores as &quot;over 
there&quot; ;-) I also have problems finding non-petroleum silicone spray 
here cause it&#x27;s apparently been banned. Most likely cause it 
contributes to the greenhouse effect or something ...

-Per

PS! That time excludes the time to peel off the old ones.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Macky,

thanks a lot for the explanation. So these &quot;phrases&quot; you build, do 
they have some &quot;meaning&quot;, i.e. they tell you a story or something, or 
do they just sound nice? I think in addition to being a good system, 
the main advantage of you Japanese people is that you learn and 
practice it already when you&#x27;re very young because it&#x27;s part of the 
natural language?

Btw, when will you solve 5x5 bld?

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Don&#x27;t know if this makes sense in your situation, but I could imagine 
in Michael&#x27;s case (if I remember it correctly) this could work: Hang 
up posters showing a cube and write &quot;I lost my cube, want to have it 
back, no questions asked, contact me ...&quot;. Or something like that. The 
point is it might be easier for someone to return it if you say you 
lost it than when you say someone stole it. One could always say to 
have &quot;found&quot; it. Also, maybe they simply don&#x27;t understand you&#x27;re 
really missing it. And even if you don&#x27;t get it back, you still get to 
advertise your cube club :-)

Good luck,
Stefan

<br>
Here&#x27;s a thought, I read a book about memory tricks. It said:<br>
memorizing numbers is the easiest thing:<br>
couple every number to a letter, then form words or sentences<br>
<br>
I used this trick a lot<br>
0 d<br>
1 k <br>
2 l<br>
3 m<br>
4 n<br>
5 p <br>
6 r<br>

<br>
Today my wife found a long lost and lonely corner piece in the closet. It had been lying there, without food, drink, silicone spray or an edge piece to play with. The corner piece belonged to my best speedcube and was very happy to come home, and it made a cheerful &quot;click&quot; as it jumped back with its neighbours. That&#x27;s right after it knocked out a rivaling corner piece from one of the cheaper brands that managed to get in its place.<br>
<br>
I even remember its piece pop, where it jumped so high and far that I just couldn&#x27;t image it would wander off to the bottom of the closet.<br>
<br>
What a happy return!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Your method of cutting out the stickers is way more advanced than 
mine. I just use a regular pair of scissors. Here&#x27;s what I do:

1. Cut a length of tape that&#x27;s the same length as a single cubie 
sticker. This results in a rectangular shape because the tape is 
wider than a cubie sticker.
2. Trim the rectangular piece of tape so it&#x27;s a square.
3. Snip a tiny section of the point off each of the four corners of 
the new sticker. This is to give the illusion that I&#x27;ve rounded the 
corners of the sticker, like a real stickers. I can&#x27;t be bothered to 
properly cut rounded corners on all the stickers!! Just snipping the 
corner off looks fine, as you can see in the picture on my blog:

4. Repeat steps 1-2 54 times!!

I too lost a corner piece in May this year (GYO). It happenned on 
our one-day school trip. I was cubing in the coach for the others to 
see me and three pieces popped up. I got two of them right away, but 
the third one just rolled away. I looked for it in the whole coach, 
the driver said he&#x27;ll look for it too when he cleans up, etc., but 
nobody found it. I still hope I someday will get a message saying 
they found my cube piece.
I replaced it with a Rubiks cube piece which I painted this summer 
(oh those stickers) but now I have just a tiny yellow point (you can 
see it at the start of my cube video:

http://www.geocities.com/portoseb/cube/videos.html

). I still don&#x27;t know what I should do about it. Maybe just leave it 
like that, because this piece is the one I first look for when 
preinspection starts - 2x2x2 Petrus ;)

Good luck in finding your pieces!

Lol I really wanna see how that guy mathematically proved it in 52

          <div class="email-content">I recieved the stickers today when I got home (after working 17 
hours!).  They look fantastic.  The look is very similar to these
http://grrroux.free.fr/workshop/3restick.jpg
However they are a bit brighter.  THe red and blue are brighter and 
more vibrant, the orange is pretty close to the same, the green is 
slightly darker, the yellow matches the hue of the other colors more 
so it&#x27;s more like a highlighter color.  What is white.  I&#x27;ll uplaod 
some pictures ASAP, but right now it&#x27;s off to bed, since I have to 
get up in 4.5 hours to do a 12 hour shift.

Anyone interested in my offer, just email me, and I&#x27;ll send you the 
address.
For our less experienced folks, an SASE is a self addressed stamped 
envelope.  Just stick one of those in an envelope addressed to me, 
and if you would throw a couple bucks in there it would really help 
offset the cost of this stuff.  Also let me know if you want the 
stickers pre cut for a 3x3x3 or if you want to cut them yourself, 
and if so, what size 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 2x2x2, etc.  I only have the 
template for the 3x3x3.  If anyone has a template for 4x4x4 I would 
be happy to cut those as well.

Just let those liars live in the dark ;-) Not very productive to be

I wonder, do u always solve by luck? ... LOL ... :-P

          <div class="email-content">Sorry for the multiple posts but I found this interesting too,

If you did 43252003274489856000 random turns on a cube, assuming you 
start from a scrambled state, then the chance of seeing the solved 
state by luck is 

1-(43252003274489855999/43252003274489856000)^43252003274489856000

which is a close approximation of lim n->infinity 1-[(n-1)/n]^n

If you work out this limit you get 1-(1/e) which is approximately a 
63% chance.

I know this is probably getting a little too deep into probabilities 
and stuff, but I just think it&#x27;s cool that even if you did the exact 
same number of moves as there are combinations to the cube, there&#x27;s 
still only a 63% that your cube will solve by luck.

I had some fun learning how to use Java&#x27;s BigDecimal class, here&#x27;s the 
result (number of turns vs. probability to accidentally solve). I used 
1000 digits precision.

10^0 :  0.0000000000000000000231203163

10^22 : 0.9999999999999999999999999999

Isn&#x27;t it funny how the numbers look very similar for a long time? And 
here are the reciprocal values:

10^0 :  43252003274489856000.000000000
10^1 :  4325200327448985600.4500000000

10^15 : 43252.503276416549031583004599
10^16 : 4325.7003467159159037864998179

10^19 : 4.8444501143894109135381508565
10^20 : 1.1099515734277697062526475446
10^21 : 1.0000000000909859165012786291
10^22 : 1.0000000000000000000000000000

So assuming that guy twisted for a full day at one twist per second, 
i.e. he came across 24*60*60=86400 states, the chance that he truely 
solved it is less than 1 out of 432520032744899.

Cheers!

P.S. Here&#x27;s my code:

import java.math.*;

class RubikLuckySolve {
    
    static BigDecimal big ( int n ) {
	return scale( new BigDecimal( n + &quot;&quot; ));
    }
    
    static BigDecimal one = big( 1 );
    
    static BigDecimal div ( BigDecimal a, BigDecimal b ) {
	return scale( a.divide( b, a.ROUND_HALF_EVEN ));
    }
    
    static BigDecimal mul ( BigDecimal a, BigDecimal b ) {
	return scale( a.multiply( b ));
    }
    
    static BigDecimal sub ( BigDecimal a, BigDecimal b ) {
	return scale( a.subtract( b ));
    }
    
    static BigDecimal scale ( BigDecimal a ) {
	return scale( a, 1000 );
    }
    
    static BigDecimal scale ( BigDecimal a, int scale ) {
	return a.setScale( scale, a.ROUND_HALF_EVEN );
    }
    
    static BigDecimal power( BigDecimal base, int exp ) {
	BigDecimal result = one;
	while( exp-- > 0 )
	    result = mul( result, base );
	return result;
    }
    
    static String nice ( BigDecimal a ) {
	return (a+&quot;&quot;).substring( 0, 30 );
    }
    
    public static void main ( String[] args ) {
	BigDecimal n = one;
	for( int e=1; e&lt;=12; e++ )
	    n = mul( n, big( 2*e ));
	for( int c=1; c&lt;=8; c++ )
	    n = mul( n, big( 3*c ));
	n = div( n, big( 12 ));
	
	for( int k=0; k&lt;2; k++ ){
	    BigDecimal foo = sub( one, div( one, n ));
	    for( int i=0; i&lt;23; i++ ){
		System.out.print( &quot;10^&quot; + i + &quot; :\t&quot; );
		BigDecimal bar = sub( one, foo );
		System.out.println( nice( (k==0) ? bar : div( one, bar )));
		foo = power( foo, 10 );
	    }
	    System.out.println();
	}
    }
}

          <div class="email-content">I was just poking around the &#x27;cube facts&#x27; page on the rubiks.com 
site. I came across the following:

&quot;The least number of moves required in unscrambling the Cube from 
the worst disorder, the shortest route, is often called God&#x27;s 
Algorithm. Morwen Thistlethwaite, using computers at South Bank 
University in London, calculated that the magical minimum was 52 
moves. A number subsequently reduced to 50. It is thought that the 
number of moves may turn out to be somewhere in the low twenties.&quot;

I&#x27;m guessing this is where that person got the number 52. I think we 
all know that God&#x27;s Algorithm is *much* lower than 52!!

Just curious, but how many of us here actually use internet blogs <br>

Post a link if you have a blog! So all of us here can visit it and <br>
make fun of the weird stuff you post :) <br>
(Alright, I know my jokes are really lame...)<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jasmine-
I bought them from Ton at US Nationals. He sells them on his 
website, but apparently he isn&#x27;t selling any puzzles right now... 
I&#x27;m sure you can order from him after he&#x27;s back from his trip =D As 
for the Square -1 itself, I love it. I play with mine a lot, and I 
don&#x27;t have any complaints. (I can&#x27;t solve one, I just... try to 
solve it...) It&#x27;s a lot better than the rubiks.com ones. The 
sticker&#x27;s are also a lot better.

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s one more thing I was thinking about based on this last post.

Assuming someone can work their way to finishing the F2L and then 
perform random transformations on the LL via trial and error then 
the odds would be a lot better of a random lucky solve.

Assuming they just place all the LL pieces together in the right way 
in relation to eachother and all oriented correctly then the LL face 
can be off by one move, but I think we can assume that that position 
would be technically solved since someone could recognize that it 
was only off by 1 turn.

So there 4 out of 62208 solved states, or 1 out of 15552.

I think we can assume that a transformation on the LL could be done 
in 20 moves roughly if the person is using trial and error to break 
apart the LL and try to put it back together again using relatively 
few inefficient algorithms.

So after each 20 move transformation the chance that the new LL 
configuration is a recognizable solved state is 1/15552.

So the chance of solving the cube at least once in 50 
transformations on the LL (1000 moves) is

1-(15551/15552)^50 ~ 0.32% chance

I think this would definitely be possible, even though less people 
figure out how to get the F2L than people how can figure out the 
first layer only.

In case anyone is interested,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jasmine,

you could try to get some here:
http://hlavolamy.gumruch.cz/europe.php
(I found this page a while ago and I believe Ton also linked to it).
You could also visit Prague ;-) I easily found it in a store and on 
markets.

They do have a design (?) flaw, though. There&#x27;s a screw, a spring and 
a washer in it. Problem is, the washer is between the spring and the 
screw head, not (like I think it should be) on the other end of the 
spring, protecting the plastic. I&#x27;ve seen this puzzle from a friend 
and the spring had already eaten through the plastic and thus the big 
middle layer piece is loose, you can move it in and out almost a 
centimeter. Quite annoying. I disassembled both of mine and fixed this 
problem. In one of them, the spring was already halfway through the 
plastic. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s quite hard to disassemble...

If you&#x27;re mainly concerned about the stickers, maybe Adam Zamora will 
be able to help, he recently bought a sticker machine and I&#x27;ll order a 
few from him and also ask him for Square-1 stickers (since I&#x27;d like to 
have the same color scheme as for 3x3). See this thread on 
twistypuzzles.com:
http://www.twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3118

          <div class="email-content">The permutations are tough at first, but you start to
develop easy ways to recognize the cases.  I&#x27;ll see if
I can help you out though.  Out of the 21
permutations:
http://www.speedcubing.com/final_layer_permutation.html

3 with all edges correct:
P1, P2, P3

4 with all corners correct:
P4, P5, P6, P7

6 with 2 adjacent correct corners:
P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13

4 with 2 opposite correct corners:
P18, P19, P20, P21

4 oddballs:
P14, P15, P16, P17

Notice I listed five categories here.  When you reach
your permutation, you have to recognize which category
the case lies under.  Then, of that category, narrow
it down from there.  This is how I did it anyway.  I
hope this helps!

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m pretty sure a lot of people do this but I look for patterns on the
sides of the upper layer (the LL) instead of looking for how to move
the pieces around. 

(this will be hard to explain if you dont know what i&#x27;m talking about,
but i&#x27;ll try...it might help to do the algorithm backwards on a solved
cube and follow along)

Like for example in P21, the upper layer of the back face has two
adjacent stickers that are the same color, AND the upper layer of the
left face has two adjacent stickers that are the same color. This
pattern of two adjacent sticker of the same color on two ADJACENT
faces helps me to recognize that it&#x27;s P21.

Another example is P9. There are once again two adjacent stickers of
the same color on the sides of the LL, but this time they are on
OPPOSITE faces, and that&#x27;s my cue for a P9.

It&#x27;s kind of hard to recognize the patterns of P14, P15, P16, and P17
at first because they all look similar, but you should get it with
pratice.

Sorry if this was confusing!

          <div class="email-content">The way I recognize the PLL case is to study the &quot;band&quot; around the U 
layer. This will be the only unsolved part of the cube. What I do then 
is to take notice of blocks of solid color. You can pretty much always 
uniquely identify the permutation my recognizing these block patterns.

An n-block is for the purpose of this post such a solid block n 
stickers long where all n stickers are on the same face and all have 
the same color.

Patterns with a 3-block:

- P6, P7: In addition to the 3-block all the corners will be correct 
relative to each other.
- P8, P9: In addition to the 3-block there will be a 2-block adjoining 
it on another face.
- P13: This is the only case with only a 3-block.

Patterns with four 2-blocks:

- P19, P20: Not much to say. These are the only ones with four full 
2-blocks.

Patterns with two 2-blocks joined together on a corner:

- P1, P2: In addition to the two 2-blocks all the edges will be 
correct relative to each other. Another way to recognize this is that 
when looking at the &quot;2x2&quot; block the two stickers &quot;outside&quot; of it will 
have the same color.
- P18: Having a &quot;2x2&quot; block but none of the patterns described for P1 
and P2.

Patterns with two 2-blocks not joined together:

- P10: The two 2-blocks will be parallell.
- P21: The two 2-blocks will be orthogonal.

Note: On both these patterns the piece &quot;squished&quot; inbetween the 
2-blocks (an edge in P10 and a corner in P21) will be &quot;surrounded&quot; by 
stickers of opposite colors.

Patterns with one 2-block:

- P11, P12: In addition to the 2-block, a corner adjacent to the 
corner in the 2-block will be correct relative to that corner.
- P14, P15, P16, P17: These are tough. The pictures on the site is not 
how I do them. I always start the alg with the 2-block where it&#x27;s 
supposed to be. See if you can figure out how to distinguish these. 
Hint: Let the 2-block be solved and have a look at the corner adjacent 
to the edge in the 2-block. I.e. if the 2-block is in FRU and FU, I 
distinguish these by looking at the FLU corner.

Patterns with no blocks:

- P4: There will be a &quot;dot&quot; pattern on each side, meaning that the 2 
corner stickers will be the same color and the edge sticker will be 
the odd one out. Also, the edge sticker will NOT be the opposite color 
of the corner stickers.
- P5: Same as P4 (above) but the edge sticker WILL be the opposite 
color of the corner stickers.
- P3: This one is hard to spot right away. All edges will be solved in 
relation to each other, but the corners are messed up. A surefire way 
is to say that if you can&#x27;t work out it&#x27;s another pattern, it must be 
P3. :)

I believe I nailed them all then.

Hi Wayne!

U can cycle any 3 edges on last layer quite easily. Use a basic 3-
cycle with some setup moves.

Here is one example:

r2-lD2l&#x27;-U-ld2l&#x27;-U&#x27;-r2

Another example:

b2-lDl&#x27;-U-ld&#x27;l&#x27;-U&#x27;-b2

Note that these are both of the form S-ABA&#x27;B&#x27;-S, conjugate 
commutators :-)

If u need help for more LL 3-cycles dun hesitate to contac me :-)

-Per

PS! I do them on top. Transform them to have the effect wherever u 
like ;-)

Hey!

That number is rather a minmax than a minimum. It is believe that 
some worst case positions do require at least 22 moves. But as far 
as i know Kociemba&#x27;s Cube Explorer has found a 20 move solution or 
better for any position thrown at it. A good place to start reading 
about &quot;cube maths&quot; is the following:

http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/theory.htm#godal

Jaap&#x27;s site is simply the best puzzle site that exists on the net. 
Though there are better sites specifically for the Rubik&#x27;s Cube and 
it&#x27;s many methods of solution :-)

Are we talking about single edge cubies or about edge pairs? It would 
help if you could describe a little better what you&#x27;d like, e.g. &quot;I&#x27;d

If you count inner slice turns as two turns, you lose 16-14 against <br>

which after canceling even beats you 12-16:<br>

          <div class="email-content">You can of course know all PLL by just seeing two faces.

First notice the corners, are they all the same, all opposite, or a mix? This helps you narrow the number of cases.
Then you can study the edges, I cannot go into detail because it would take forever, but every pattern will be unique, even if the difference is only subtle.

  The way I recognize the PLL case is to study the &quot;band&quot; around the U 
  layer. This will be the only unsolved part of the cube. What I do then 
  is to take notice of blocks of solid color. You can pretty much always

  relative to each other.
  - P8, P9: In addition to the 3-block there will be a 2-block adjoining 
  it on another face.
  - P13: This is the only case with only a 3-block.

  Patterns with four 2-blocks:

  2-blocks.

  Patterns with two 2-blocks joined together on a corner:

  when looking at the &quot;2x2&quot; block the two stickers &quot;outside&quot; of it will 
  have the same color.
  - P18: Having a &quot;2x2&quot; block but none of the patterns described for P1 
  and P2.

  Patterns with two 2-blocks not joined together:

  - P10: The two 2-blocks will be parallell.
  - P21: The two 2-blocks will be orthogonal.

  Note: On both these patterns the piece &quot;squished&quot; inbetween the 
  2-blocks (an edge in P10 and a corner in P21) will be &quot;surrounded&quot; by 
  stickers of opposite colors.

  Patterns with one 2-block:

  - P11, P12: In addition to the 2-block, a corner adjacent to the 
  corner in the 2-block will be correct relative to that corner.
  - P14, P15, P16, P17: These are tough. The pictures on the site is not 
  how I do them. I always start the alg with the 2-block where it&#x27;s 
  supposed to be. See if you can figure out how to distinguish these. 
  Hint: Let the 2-block be solved and have a look at the corner adjacent 
  to the edge in the 2-block. I.e. if the 2-block is in FRU and FU, I 
  distinguish these by looking at the FLU corner.

  Patterns with no blocks:

  - P4: There will be a &quot;dot&quot; pattern on each side, meaning that the 2 
  corner stickers will be the same color and the edge sticker will be 
  the odd one out. Also, the edge sticker will NOT be the opposite color 
  of the corner stickers.
  - P5: Same as P4 (above) but the edge sticker WILL be the opposite 
  color of the corner stickers.
  - P3: This one is hard to spot right away. All edges will be solved in 
  relation to each other, but the corners are messed up. A surefire way 
  is to say that if you can&#x27;t work out it&#x27;s another pattern, it must be 
  P3. :)

  I believe I nailed them all then.

Hi Stefan,

I get a &#x27;page cannot be found error&#x27; when I go to  
http://hlavolamy.gumruch.cz/europe.php :(

If I&#x27;m ever in Prague, I shall email you for the details of that 
store!

The problem with my Square-1 is not really the stickers, I think the 
cube just came from a bad batch or something. I siliconed it, but 
this just made things worse. I had lost my good silicone and the 
replacement brand I bought was crappy. Oh well. Maybe I shall just 
have to visit Prague and stock up on Square-1s!! :)

Hey!

Optimal algs were not the issue here. The thing is that u can make 
my kind of edge 3-cycles on the fly. Ur alg u would have to just 
memorise anyway. Only for fewest moves solve would i resort to 3-
cycles using inner slice moves for LL 3-cycles. Who counts moves 
when u speedsolve anyway? Another advantage of my way is that if u 
write the alg in this form S-ABA&#x27;B&#x27;-S&#x27; u always will have that B is 
turning the U-layer. No need to turn cube over in any way when u 
wanna speedoptimise. Also easier to get lookahead when u never move 
that LL away from staying on top. Also the official rules for nxnxn 
cubes with n>3 says that any inner slice move counts as 1 as opposed 
to for the 3x3x3 (historical reasons).

I dun wanna argue. Just pointing out the advantages of my approach 
for a beginner :-)

          <div class="email-content">The secret in memorizing algorithms is in &#x27;chunking&#x27;.

&lt;snip>

http://library.thinkquest.org/C0110291/tricks/mnemonics/grouping.php

Chunking

Look at the following chunks of letters: 

T WAN BAC BSC PRC IA

At first glance, its seems like they would be
difficult to memorize. However, with simple chunking,
look at them now: 

TWA NBA CBS CPR CIA

&lt;/snip>

With chunking, or grouping, we&#x27;re able to take
algorithms and make them easier to learn.  Take the
following algorithm for example: (T permutation)

RUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FR2U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;

This can seem overwhelming.  When grouped like this
however:

(RUR&#x27;)(U&#x27;R&#x27;F)(R2U&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;)(RUR&#x27;F&#x27;)

This way you are learning 4 pieces of information. 
Typically algorithms are grouped by triggers.  When
you get used to learning algs this way, the process of
committing it to your short term memory becomes pretty
easy.  It usually only takes me about 45 seconds to
get the alg in my head.

How do I commit the algorithm to long term memory?

It&#x27;s easy to learn the turns of an alg, but after
that, there are a few aspects you have to worry about.

*Recognition~ This is where practice comes in.  Set
the case up on the LL, and practice recognizing it
from different angles (via U, U&#x27;, U2 turns)

*Execution~ turning the turns in your head, into turns
by your hand.  I usually repeat an alg after I learn
it 50+ times a day.  Even if it took you 10 seconds to
do the alg, at 50 times  a day it still takes less
than 10 minutes.  After some practice you&#x27;ll make the
turns without even thinking about them.  It&#x27;s like
learning to tie your shoes.  After you did it enough
times you didn&#x27;t really have to look anymore.

Hope this helped,
-richard

Be able to identify and execute your F2L algorithms without 
thinking.  That way your fingers are working while you are looking 
for your next pair.  Something that just clicked for me not too long 
ago is the ability to start an algorithm on one side of the cube and 
finish it on the other.  Not sure how to learn this, but it helps 
temendously to be a little dynamic in the F2L to be a bit &#x27;creative&#x27; 
in mixing up the algorithms.  

F2L is certainly one of the hang ups for faster times but it&#x27;s almost 
hypnotic when you do it right.

Congratulations with your new record...!

On thing I would personally advise to a person averaging around a 
minute or maybe 40 seconds, is to solve the cube very slowly a lot 
of times, without timing yourself. Try to do it really slow, while 
minimizing the amount of moves you need. Try to find some shortcuts 
yourself (don&#x27;t apply the F2L algs without thinking!). Also, try to 
solve the cube really slow, but without stopping. This can be pretty 
hard, because I know it can be very hard to find your CE pairs :). 
But you will get used to it. Then, when you can solve it without too 
much big delays, gradually increase your amount of moves per second. 
Doing this, I think you&#x27;ll be averaging under 40 second pretty soon.

Good luck,

Joel.

Strange... I clicked on it again (the link you wrote) and got the 
correct page. Please try again.

The Square-1&#x27;s I use (actually the Cube21 type) both had some 
lubricant inside already, which I completely removed after 
disassembling them. I even washed the pieces. Then I applied *a lot* 
of good silicone spray. When you say &quot;it made things worse&quot; for you, 
maybe yours also had some other lubricant inside which is not 
&quot;compatible&quot; with your silicone spray?

I like mine very much now, gonna compare them to Lars&#x27;s at DCD...

Cheers!

Hey, I claim you can make up my kind of edge 3-cycles on the fly, too 
:-) Don&#x27;t you think so? At least with some practice? I admit that so 
far I only really use your way, but I&#x27;m gonna try the inner-slice algs 
as well. And even though we don&#x27;t count moves when speedsolving, I 
think the inner-slice algs can be executed faster. Well, I don&#x27;t 
really speedsolve (but blindsolve) using 3-cycles (super5x5speed I do 
use them for centers but only 3x3-style without inner slice turns) so 
maybe your opinion should count more ;-)

There&#x27;s quite a lot of variation, even judging from a small sample of <br>

Hi,

since I live in Prague, I can give you some information.
It is true, that Czech variation of Square-1 Cube 21
(which is in fact original - Square-1 is a copy :))
is freely available in many shops here.

However, recently the production of Cube 21 went to China
and these new series are horrible, so be careful.
The original series seems finished this year and they are
really good (good plastic, shape, stickers) but the stock
is limited.
I do not sell them, but I know some people that have
knowledge where to get what type...
So If anyone is about to visit Prague and want to buy
Cube 21 here, email me and I can ask for info about it...
Cube 21 are well compatible with silicone oil in general...

Best regards.

Josef

Hi Richard,

I don&#x27;t know these, but from previous discussions I got the impression 
that &quot;heavy duty&quot; seems to be a very good sign.

<br>
I don&#x27;t know about that. Of these two, the &#x27;food grade&#x27; one seems <br>
safe to me because it explicitly mentions it can be used on rubber <br>
and plastic. That means it will not be oil based. The &#x27;heavy duty&#x27; <br>
one has no mention of that, so may not be as safe.<br>
<br>
Generally the packaging should say it is suitable for plastic or <br>
rubber, or that it is &#x27;100% grease-free lubrication&#x27;, before I would <br>
use it on any of my puzzles.<br>

hey, i just heard about takahito domon, and how he can do sub 20s<br>
without doing f2l..he does top layer then middle layer separate..  if<br>
this is possible..then why does everyone bother learning to do the<br>

Hey-
Takahito does D- Cross, so middle layer edges on the U layer are 
generally easier to spot. Also, he&#x27;s insane. If see his videos on 
his website, he doesn&#x27;t need F2L. I guess nobody really needs F2L, 
because if you practice enough, and find cool tricks, 
the &quot;difference between &#x27;f2l&#x27; and &#x27;bottom layer -> middle layer&#x27; is 
about 2 seconds&quot; (Makisumi, 2004 [=D Yes, I had to footnote it]) 
There are times when I do &#x27;place corner -> middle layer edge&#x27; when I 
see some fast FSC or something if it&#x27;s the fastest thing I&#x27;m able to 
do. (okay, I&#x27;m not a great cuber... That&#x27;s just what I do..lol)

I had a particularly hard time figuring out what people were talking 
about when they mentioned finger tricks when I first started.  What 
helped me tremendously to overcome that was Dan Knights&#x27; page:

http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/CubeInfo1.html#hints

There he shows videos (fast and slow versions) of various basic and 
intermediate finger trick combos.

This site helps in that after you learn the basic triggers, you can 
try to put them together in different combinations to form more 
intermediate and advanced triggers.

Basically when practicing a new alg, try to always group the faces 
together in many different ways, and groups that feel comfortable to 
you to perform as a finger trick try to keep together.  Eventually 
you will have most of the moves in an alg as part of some finger 
trick, and the alg will go very quickly.

For now, if you&#x27;re still new to finger trick combos, try to learn 
all of the ones Dan has videos for, then try to combine them in 
different ways and come up with your own new combos.  Then if any of 
those moves spark any new ideas, try them out!

Eventually you will develop your own finger trick style.  I do 
certain types of finger trick combos that I don&#x27;t really see many 
others do, but I&#x27;ve also seen a lot of finger tricks combos that 
others do that I had never even considered to try before.  Just 
remember to always do what feels most comfortable to you, even if 
someone else does it a different way.

Hope that helps some,
Chris

          <div class="email-content">yes, I agree with Chris.

finger tricks are a very personal thing, and you will of course eventually find your own style. For example, Ron would prefer to make R&#x27; U2 by turning R&#x27; with his right hand, and then using his right index to push on the RUF sticker and push it all the way round.
I on the other hand prefer to make R&#x27; with my right hand, and then use my right index finger to pull on BUR and drag it all the way round. So you can see that the same move can be performed in more than one way, and depends on how flexible you are, how tight you grip the cube, etc.

Dan Knights&#x27; site is definitely worth checking out, especially since it will demonstrate to you exactly what a finger trick is. then you can begin experimenting with your own tricks :)

To be honest, I had to think about this...

I think the most important thing is that starting with one face will 
cost some extra moves, and is slightly less efficient (in terms of 
moves). I asume getting sub-20 using such a method will require a 
bit more dexterity. The difference in terms of seconds won&#x27;t be 
really big, although I am not sure if it&#x27;s really just 2 seconds (I 
am a sceptic :)). I guess the key-hole method will be great, 
especially for a beginner. It doesn&#x27;t really require algoritms, and 
I am sure averaging 25 seconds is possible, with enough practice. 
(actually, I use Fridrich, but like most speedcubers, I also use a 
lot of shortcuts based on the key-hole idea).

So.. Why does everyone bother learning F2L? Well, when you get 
really fast (when you almost reach your potential speed with your 
layer-by-layer method), then it will become harder and harder to get 
faster, and learning F2L will be a nice and easy way to get some 
extra seconds off your time (easier than learning loads of algs for 
ZB method, for example).

   At first it can be useful to break the Last Level into four tasks.
I started with movimg the corners into place (called permuting), then
turning them upright (called &quot;orienting&quot;), turn the edges upright,
then put the edges in place.

  Most people end up splitting the Last Level into two pieces. For
example some people orient everything first then permute everything,
but I seem to be slowly heading for doing the corners completely in
one go, then the edges in one go.

          <div class="email-content"><br>
Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I recently sent a suggestion to Ron and Tyson which was also brought <br>
up on the caltech group.  There have been a number of concerns so I <br>
decided to bring it up here.<br>
<br>
My initial message was to petition for a format change for the final <br>
round of the one-handed event.  I feel that a mean of 3 (all three <br>
solves counting) would be a better representation of a cuber&#x27;s <br>
skill, as well as still conforming to the time constraints of having <br>
numerous events.  An average of 5 (fastest and slowest discarded) <br>
might take too long considering that there will be a number of other <br>
events at the competition.  Also to be more specific, one pop would <br>
be allowed.  Pops one-handed are extremely rare, but in case someone <br>
popped I don&#x27;t think they should be disqualified because of it.  <br>
Again this is open to debate too, and is only my opinion.<br>
<br>
I have a few reasons for this change:<br>
<br>
1) It forces the cuber to not be able to make any mistakes.  By this <br>
I am referring almost solely to one-handed amnesia.  I still have <br>
quite a lot of trouble with this under pressure, and I feel that the <br>
rules of the competition should penalize it since it is a huge <br>
mistake in a solve.  This also rewards those who have practiced <br>
harder to overcome it.<br>
<br>
2) It decreases the possibility of someone winning with an easy <br>
solve, or for the more extreme example a lucky solve.  My 25 second <br>
solve at the US competition was not technically lucky, in that I <br>
planned for all the shortcuts I used, however I admit that it was a <br>
little lucky in that the scramble gave me a 5 move extended cross, <br>
which is somewhat rare.  I think an easy solve in a mean of 3 solves <br>
would be less beneficial to the cuber than an easy solve in a &quot;best <br>
of&quot; competition.<br>
<br>
3) It makes the one-handed event more of an official event.  Maybe <br>
it is just me but I feel like all the &quot;best of&quot; events are less <br>
official somehow.  As an exception though in competitions where <br>
there is a time constraint having a &quot;best of&quot; format in order to <br>
allow an event makes perfect sense to me.  For larger competitions <br>
though I think it would be better to have a mean of 3 for most of <br>
the events, but in particular I want to push this for the one-handed <br>
event.  Ron mentioned doing this for all final rounds which would be <br>
great.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
That is the end of my concerns about this.  There were a number of <br>
other concerns on the caltech group about this, so we decided to <br>
bring it up here.<br>
<br>
Personally I like the idea of having a best of 2 or 3 for the one-<br>
handed first round, but a mean of 3 for the final round (where all 3 <br>
solves count).<br>
<br>
Again that is just my opinion, and I&#x27;m curious to see if any others <br>
agree.  Maybe I&#x27;m the only weirdo who thinks this deep into the one-<br>
handed event :) but I hope some others either disagree or agree so <br>
that we can try to come to some sort of compromise.<br>

A few options here but I would suggest starting at Dan Knight&#x27;s page 
for the last layer.  He has an intermediate page that requires only a 
handful of algorithms: 
http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/Intermediate.html

You&#x27;ll have to learn all the standard OLL algs but his advanced 
method (3 look) can save an entire step:
http://benjerry.middlebury.edu/~knights/Cube/Advanced.html

Can also get these and other algorithms for a 2 look LL at 
speedcubing.com.

Hello all !<br>
<br>
I was visiting the site of Jaap and I would like to know some tricks ..<br>
<br>
On this page : http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cube2.htm#numpos<br>
<br>
I would like to know how it calculated the values of the table! <br>
If they were calculated by computer, did you know how ? Which is the<br>
algorithm? <br>
<br>
Thanks ..<br>

well, that&#x27;s a bit misleading...
F2L is definitely helpful. I was just talking about the difference when both F2L 
and corners->edges are perfected. (about 11 sec and 8.5 sec)

macky

p.s. oh, and, please don&#x27;t quote me. not just yet at least. =D

No I am not, but I wish I could go.  I simply can&#x27;t afford the 
traveling fees to California right now :(

I had suggested the format change not for the upcoming competition 
only, but hopefully for all future competitions.  I just like the 
format of the 4x4 and 5x5 final rounds as they are now (mean of 3), 
and would personally prefer to see it used for the one-handed final 
as well.  However this isn&#x27;t really my call to make, so I wanted to 
bring it up and see what others thought in case enough people agreed 
and the format might be changed.

I figured it would be better to try than not to try.

To make a long story short, my brand new 2x2x2 is now in 24 pieces. I <br>
have no idea how to put it back together correctly. I have restored <br>
it into a cube before, but I cannot make all of the moves. (right now <br>
it is in the 24 pieces). I need the right configuration. Can anyone <br>
help me?<br>
<br>
The pieces:<br>
8 corner pieces<br>
4 spindle pieces (one piece is the main part, the other 3 <br>
parts &quot;swivel&quot;)<br>
12 sliders (10 normal sliders, 2 elongated)<br>
<br>
!!Here is a link to a picture I took of all of the peices:<br>
http://mars.walagata.com/w/elite185/all-parts.jpg<br>
<br>
Some of the corners have stoppers. When the elongated &quot;sliders&quot; (2 <br>
elongated ones) hit the stoppers, you can&#x27;t make a turn. As you can <br>
see, with the spindle, 3 parts of the spindle are fixed(don&#x27;t turn), <br>
and 3 parts (the separate parts) turn freely. <br>
I think they key is figuring out the configuration of stoppers and <br>
the spindle relative to the corners. Some corners have stoppers in <br>
different places! Hopefully someone can help me!<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance!<br>

I was able to restore it to a cube, but once again, i cant make all 
of the moves.
How do you put the 3 big pie peices into the first cubeie? Does it 
mater which cubbie?

Thanks for all of your help!

I agree that using the fastest time is not really good.

However, using the mean using all solves can give interesting 
effects. For instance, in the European Championships where this rule 
was imposed, Lars Vanderbergh ended up third in the 4x4x4. He had 
two great solves (below 1 min 10 s including a new WR) and one 
terrible one (well over three minutes). 

One alternative to both &quot;fastest time&quot; and taking the mean, is to 
take the median, that is, the middle number. For example, in the 
series 12 19 20 25 79, the median is 20. When there is an even 
number of numbers, the median is the mean of the two middle numbers. 
Thus, the median of the series 12 19 20 25 is (19+20)/2 = 19,5.

The median is less sensitive to extreme scores than the mean and 
this makes it a better measure than the mean for highly skewed 
distributions.

Thus, I am inclined to suggest that taking the median should replace 
both taking the mean and the use of the fastest solve. Taking the 
median is easy to apply and is easy to calculate. Your comments 
about this?

All 3 big pie peices must go in the same cubie (doesn&#x27;t matte which 
one) and the 3 non-rotating axes must surround that cubie. It sounds 
like you can handle the rest. That should... no that will solve your

I have to second this opinion. The median catches extreme values 
effectively and gives a fairer average than if the mean was used. It 
also eliminates lucky solves nicely. Since it eliminates extreme 
values there is no need to set a limit for POP&#x27;s and the like. As 
long as a contestant finishes enough solves to calculate a median 
everything is fine, else it is a disqualification.

The fine thing is that even though more Pop&#x27;s and DNS&#x27;s will be 
allowed (4 in a run of 10 times or 2 in a run of 5) every such event 
will still reflect negative upon the median since it will always be 
counted as the worst time. This means it&#x27;s not possible to gain 
anything from a POP or DNS, but the effect upon your average will be 
less dramatic than that of using the mean.

I see few, if any, drawbacks in using the median instead of the 
mean. I see quite a few advantages though and I vote for that all 
averages will be calculated with the median instead of the 
arithmetic mean. This includes unofficial and official records on 
speedcubing.com as well as competitions.

I agree, the median does sound like a good idea, but I would call it 
an average of 3. That is essentially all the median is. For a run of 
5 or 10 though, taking an average makes more sense than a median. 
The average of 3 also helps simplify things further, since it does 
not add another method of calculating times (ex. best of, average, 
mean). A mean of 3 does &quot;punsish&quot; a solver for having amnesia put it 
equally rewards a solver for having a lucky case. An average of 3 
would reduce the likelyhood of having either a good or bad solve 
solve. Which method is better? I seem to lean towards average of 3 
because the best and worst time are discarded in other averages. If 
you use a mean of 3, why not a mean of 12? My 2 cents.

While we&#x27;re on the topic, are there an plans for an upcoming East 
Coast competion. Chris H?? I remember hearing something about you 
possibly hosting a competition at the same time as the midwest one. 
The midwest is just too far for me to travel for something informal. 
I really want to compete sometime before the word championship. 
Speaking of which, does anyon have anymore info on WC2005?

No, I have no problem like that. A major problem might be that you are
using Internet Explorer. Please check out www.browsehappy.com and
download a browser that works.

I HAVE been having a problem reaching the site in Firefox, though. It
says that I&#x27;m trying to download a binary file, which I&#x27;m not (well
technically.... oh who cares). So ya. Get Opera or Mozilla or even
Firefox. Better browsers.

I have bought 2 4x4x4&#x27;s from my local Barnes &amp; Noble, one a few

Apart from that, just open the phonebook and start calling toystores!

To be perfectly honest I&#x27;ve been lazy about setting up even a club 
at my school for the cube.

I can always find motivation to practice for the cube, but to be 
perfectly honest I am absolutely horrible at the administrative part 
at setting up a competition.

I seem to have been the only one to jump in on the east coast and 
say that I&#x27;d start up a competition, but it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m a 
very dependable person in this respect.  Does anyone else on the 
east coast want to jump in here?  I can donate the use of my timer 
and tournament display, as well as try my best to setup and judge 
events in which I&#x27;m not competing and all that.

I&#x27;d like to be taken off the list of potential people setting up 
competitions though.  I&#x27;ll be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m too lazy to try 
to get by with a 16 hour semester and try to setup a competition.  I 
know others could do it, but I&#x27;m not able to.

I apologize for those who were waiting on me to see if a tournament 
would pop up.

I would love to help someone set one up/run one, but I don&#x27;t have 
the time or energy to set one up by myself.

Hey Chris,

I&#x27;ve actually been thinking about holding a tournament, but I didn&#x27;t
think too hard about it since I heard you were thinking about it too.
 However, in light of this recent news break, I would be willing to
host one.

I am at the University of Maryland (at College Park), so it seems like
a very central location along the east coast.  I think I could get
enough judges/timers from around here to help out.  Also, I&#x27;m fairly
certain I could get a lecture hall of some kind, or even something in
the Comcast Center (where the basketball team plays).  Holding the
tournament during the month of January would be optimal, since it
would be during the winter term here.

If this is something of interest, I will get my butt in gear on this.
 However, I don&#x27;t have any stackmats, and I don&#x27;t know exactly what to
do to make this official.  Maybe Tyson could give me some advice? 
Also Chris, I&#x27;d like to keep you involved if possible, and I would
greatly appreciate anything anyone else could do, since I really don&#x27;t
know what I&#x27;m doing.

But I can promise one thing:  there will be a Rainbow cube event =)

If you want an event to happen, you need to figure out what you&#x27;re 
going to do and go do it.  Seems simple but pretty hard.  Try holding 
an informal cube gathering or something just to see if you can do it.

I had a HUGE amount of trouble with rubiks.com last month!! I was 
trying to put in a fairly substantial order and almost gave up 
because it was so complicated. I spent ages on rubiks.com trying to 
put in this order. I was going to be spending a reasonable amount of 
money (9 puzzles!) and they were making it *so* difficult.

There were many problems, including that they&#x27;d attached some random 
unrelated postal address to my login (not my address) and the site 
wouldn&#x27;t accept my credit cards (I tried several cards). I had used 
the credit cards the same day for other transactions and there was 
no problem, so why wouldn&#x27;t rubiks.com accept them??

If I&#x27;d been able to get the all the puzzles from mefferts.com then I 
definitely would have. I&#x27;ve used mefferts.com before without problem 
and they shipped my order to Australia in two weeks and provided 
free international airmail! :)

I was quite keen to get the puzzles though, so I persisted and was 
*eventually* able to put in the order.

Of course a mean of 12 is not practical. My point was that in a 
normal run of 12, the mean is not taken, the average is and 
therefore in a run of 3 the avergae should be taken and not the mean.
Sorry if I didn&#x27;t get that point across well. It&#x27;s not an issue I 
see as a very big deal anyway.

Hello fellow East Coast Chrises-
I totally understand your laziness ChrisH. Don&#x27;t worry about it. As 
I was reading your post, I thought I might be able to set up 
something really informal and see who comes but it seems like ChrisP 
is willing to host one. I&#x27;ll have a stackmat by then that I can 
donate and would be happy to help out in some other ways. I am not 
guaranteeing I can make it. Traveling is a bit of a problem but I 
will try. It&#x27;s funny though, I had an opportunity to go to Maryland 
last week, I am going to DC next weekend, and possibly in the spring

Thanks for the input guys, I appreciate it.

David - I was also unaware of a fellow MD cuber, we&#x27;ll have to get
together some time.  I could definitly use your help in setting this
up, as your location makes you optimal.

I&#x27;m thinking that if I purchased a stackmat (which I&#x27;ve been meaning
to do for a while now), and a few others brought their own, this could
go rather smoothly.  I&#x27;m planning on finding out what I could get as
far as a location for this in the coming week.  It seems as though
competitions are better in halls with steeper seats, so everyone can
see.  I have a few ideas of some larger lecture halls that might work
well.

I&#x27;m glad to see that there is interest, as I am excited about
undertaking this.  I&#x27;ll try to keep you all up to date on any
late-breaking news.  Keep the input coming, even if its just a note
saying you would come.  Thanks.

Ever since I got my cube, looked it over for about two hours, opened the hint booklet that <br>
came with it, saw what they wanted me to do with the Fridrich method, I&#x27;ve always been <br>
able to solve it with a little help from the Rubik&#x27;s site.<br>
<br>
Today, during school, during LUNCH, I sat down with my cube and solved it in under four <br>
minutes without the aid of anyone. I had, however spent, the entire morning figuring out <br>
new ways to do the same things used on the Rubik&#x27;s site, but because I had not <br>
memorized them, it was like a whole new experience for me.<br>
<br>
I walk out of this with a better understanding of my cube and real fulfilment. Thanks for <br>

Sorry in advance if I just made a complete fool of myself, - but 
since, from the solved cube you can create 18 different permutations 
(R, R&#x27;, R2 --> same with FBUDL), doesn&#x27;t that mean that there is a 
18/43252003274489856000 chance of the next turn producing a solved 
state? Maybe my logic is stuffed, since probability isn&#x27;t one of my 
best topics... but that&#x27;s how I think of it as..
so P(1000 turns) = 1 - ((43252003274489856000-
18)/43252003274489856000) ^ 1000 

= approx 4.16^-14 % chance???...

Hello,<br>

We are making a work about the rubik&#x27;s cube but we have to find a <br>

But we have only 17 years and our level of physic isn&#x27;t high. We <br>
can&#x27;t put on our work the concept of the &quot;quarks&quot; because it isn&#x27;t <br>

CONGRATULATIONS !!!!

What a magnificent feeling !

I still remember my first solve (in the early 80s)

Now you are the master of your cube.  It will do whatever you ask it 
to do.  But now it is up to you to decide how far you want to go.  
You can spend YEARS being perfectly happy with the fact that you can 
solve it from any state.  Or, if you want, you can dive into the 
(obsession ?) of speedcubing.  You will find TONS of help in this 
forum.  The MOST IMPORTANT piece of advice I can give you is to make 
sure that you always enjoy solving the cube.

Different stokes for different folks - some are very happy to solve, 
others are only happy when they solve more quickly, and most of us 
fall somewhere in between.

Enjoy your triumph.  Enjoy it again and again and again (I enjoyed a 
simple layer by layer system for more than 10 years !!).  Then, when 
you&#x27;re ready, go for speed by gradually fine-tuning your system.

But, once again, CONGRATULATIONS

Hi Lars (P),<br>
<br>
I have been trying to shift from a simple cross to a 2x2x2 block to <br>
start my solution on the 3x3x3.  Quite frankly I&#x27;m not very good at <br>
it in a 15 second inspection period.  Given as much time as I need I <br>
can eventually figure it out in a reasonable number of moves <br>
(roughly 8-10 QTM if no c/e pair to start, 6-8 QTM if c/e pair from <br>
heaven).  Doubtless I will eventually become better at this with <br>
practice.  But my question is: do you have any stats (or semi-<br>
complete-stats, or just a &#x27;gut feeling&#x27;) for how many QTM it should <br>
take to unite a 2x2x2 block?  I know a cross can ALWAYS be solved in <br>
8 HTM but what about a 2x2x2 - the same numer of pieces but a <br>
different combo and a (3 orientation) piece amongst (2 orientation) <br>
pieces.  Are my stats way off base?  Do I need to work on radically <br>
improving my solve strategy or only my recognition time???<br>

I&#x27;m in NY, and Maryland would be a pretty good
location for a competition! :-)

I recently purchased a Stackmat and I&#x27;d definitely
bring it in for use during the competition, and
there&#x27;s a decent chance that I would able to make it
there.

I only solve the 3x3x3 so I would also be able to
judge 4x4x4 and other solves as well.

          <div class="email-content">I haven&#x27;t seen any real numbers, but my gut feeling is that the best <br>
average you can humanly get is 6 moves. I&#x27;d be really surprised if that <br>
was more than half a move off. That&#x27;s when picking the best of 8 <br>
starting corners. For a random corner I&#x27;d guess 8.<br>
<br>
The best way to get better is probably to spend a lot of time thinking <br>
about it and solving it for fewest moves. And it sounds like that is <br>
exactly what you&#x27;re doing. You&#x27;ll learn to recognize some non obvious  <br>
things. Here&#x27;s an example: Do  R B L. Observe how the URF corner is <br>
&quot;joined up wrong&quot; with the UF edge, with the U color matching. There <br>
are pairs like that on pretty much every mixed cube, and those three <br>
(reversed) moves are often part of a great start.<br>
<br>
I wish I had a well researched answer for what you can expect to find <br>
during a 15 second preinspection. A wild guess is that I could get 1-2 <br>
moves more than optimal if I tried hard. I usually don&#x27;t try hard (it&#x27;s <br>
hard!). Also, I don&#x27;t always go for the fewest moves, but for fast <br>
moves, lack of grip shifting, and preparing for the later steps.<br>

It&#x27;s nice to see that there are really a lot of people in the world <br>
that care so much and are acle to solve the greatly enigmatic Rubik&#x27;s <br>
cube. I have been able to solve the cube for 2 months now and my <br>

<br>
I just use the standard layer by layer method with some shortcuts <br>
that I found out accidentally (I tried to scramble the cube while in <br>
the middle of it and was able to permute some edge pieces faster than <br>
what the method says). <br>
<br>
I know that I can&#x27;t possibly break the one minute mark without a <br>
method that takes under the 100+ moves that I have with my method or <br>
without a decent, lubricated cube... but I can&#x27;t seem to have enough <br>
motivation to overcome my laziness of that... <br>

Hi Jose !!

Yes, we are plenty of &quot;crazy&quot; people here, caring for rubik&#x27;s cube 
and various other puzzles. Be it for fun,  speeding, one-handed, 
blindfold, fewest moves ... you name it ... some crazy guy is 
probably into it ;-)

This group is great for general discussions. Or for &quot;digging into&quot; 
the community&#x27;s vast amount of knowledge on any aspect of 
cubing/puzzling.

If you are looking into general news, events, methods, algorithms and 
so on you should start looking at www.speedcubing.com There u will 
also find extensive lists of unofficial world records. Particularly u 
should also check out the links section. Awesome stuff!!

Welcome to the community :-)

Hey!

This could surely be calculated by a computer. Looking at the 2x2x2 
block it is 3 centers (static), 3 edges and 1 corner. If one fixes 
the position of the centers we have the following numbers of possible 
positions each cubicle could have come from :

1st edge : 24 (12 positions times 2 orientations)
2nd edge : 22 (11 positions times 2 orientations)
3rd edge : 20 (10 positions times 2 orientations)
the corner : 24 (8 positions times 3 orientations)

Multiplying we get 24*22*20*24 = 253440 possibilities

Each of these can be optimised by ACube for instance.
One would of coz need an additional program to set up all the cases 
automatically (and run them).

Hmm ...

That will yield an upper bound. Selected block might not be to the 
optimal one. Ooops ... but it&#x27;s an idea nevertheless.

I&#x27;ve had my rubiks.com 5x5x5 cube for a few months, and I&#x27;ve been <br>
trying to break it in the entire time I&#x27;ve owned it.  It was still <br>
very hard to turn the layers even after lubricating it many times, <br>
and spending hours doing nothing but twisting layers.  Becoming <br>
frustrated, I tried to take my 5x5x5 apart in a similar manner to <br>
the 3x3x3, only to break about 4 pieces in half.  Now I don&#x27;t have <br>
a &quot;Legal&quot; 5x5x5 cube, and I was hoping to practice with it for the <br>

29th in the Chicago-IL area.  My www.mefferts.com 5x5x5 cube was <br>
better &#x27;Brand-New&#x27; than my www.rubiks.com cube, even after I had <br>
used my www.rubiks.com cube for over 5 months.<br>
<br>
Does rubiks.com sell decent 5x5x5 cubes yet?  <br>
What kind of cubes are all you fast 5x5x5-ers using?  Do you prefer <br>
the 1980&#x27;s &#x27;Wahn Cube&#x27; or the www.rubiks.com 5x5x5?  What do you do <br>
to make your 5x5x5 more suitable for speedcubing?  Should I NOT use <br>
silicon for lubricating a rubiks.com 5x5x5?  Why aren&#x27;t the <br>

Hey!

It sounds very strange to me that u broke 4 pieces while taking ur 
cube apart. If u do this correctly turning top layer 45 degrees and 
then carefully prying out an edge triplet (or at least an outer edge) 
u should be fine. Never force out an edge from the 5x5x5 without 
turning top layer first.

My rubiks.com 5x5x5 was also very stiff at first. I thought it would 
never become a speedcube. After a few weeks of breaking in and still 
stiff i decided i had to do something more drastic. So i did take it 
completely apart, no damage. And i inspected the cubicles for molding 
imperfections. I only found a few &quot;points&quot; worth flattening on 
some &quot;+/centers&quot;. Then i lubed it properly and assembled it again. 
Then the cube was suddenly quite good and i started getting decent 
times with it. Down from like 7 minute solve to 4 1/2 minutes. I 
relubed it a few times after that first time also. And the cube got 
really nice. And i also improved my method so the times were even 
better. 

After about 3 months of first lubing it it was actually a tad loose. 
I got occasional pops and quite a few &quot;x/center&quot; rotations. So i 
decided that i was gonna try improve it. i had discovered that my 
wahn cube had adjustable tension. While my rubiks.com didn&#x27;t have 
that. So i came up with the idea of making a hybrid cube. 
Core/spindle from wahn and all the rest from my original rubiks.com. 
Now i think my hybrid cube is quite excellent. I can adjust tension 
whenever i want to. All i need to do is find the centers i want to 
adjust (usually tighten). Then carefully remove the centercap (with a 
stanley), adjust the screw and glue the centercap back on with a 
little superglue along 1 or 2 edges. Never glue all the way round. 
And make sure not to use too much. Make sure all layers still turn 
freely.

Making a hybrid cube like this is expensive but it&#x27;s worth it if u 
can afford it. The mefferts cube i got (old one from about 1998) also 
has adjustable centers. But i always get a &quot;rattling&quot; cube with it&#x27;s 
cubicles. I prefer rubiks.com cubicles :-)

Each cube is of coz unique so u might have a different experience. I 
would just like to mention that it is possible to successfully glue 
broken centers. Use for instance UHU superglue. Make sure the gap 
between head and foot is sufficient. Insert an edge on both sides to 
make sure. And use enough glue. Excess glue can be sanded down or 
removed with a sharp knife. Let it dry a few hours at least.

Best of luck making ur own &quot;super-5x5x5&quot; :-)

About hybrid cubes... my 3x3 is now a hybrid. It&#x27;s got Studio Cube 
pieces and Ideal skeleton (arched centers! yay!). Works wonderfully. 
Also, I broke one of the center pieces on this once, and I glued it 
together. It works fine if the break is smooth enough, so that you can 
match the two pieces together perfectly.

Oh yeah, Per, I think I &quot;broke&quot; your national 4x4 record twice sitting 
in the computer lab at school today. I got a couple of times about 1:
50. My Arxon 4x4 is turning superbly. =D

Thats really on weird occasions, believe me you get lucky most of the

You would think that cubing competitions would be more entertaining 
if it would be  :

Solve mixed cube ; Solve it back to mixed state (with a cube in that 
mixed state so you can see it and touch it etc)

Why not solve it back to the very mixed state that you started with? 
Thus, the solve starts with memorisation of the scrambled state. 
Sounds like a competition for the people who solves it blindfolded 
since they are used to memorise the cube.

Werid cases will indeed occur. You may construct more and more 
complicated methods but no method will ever be perfect. A nice thing 
with the median is that it is very simple, and according to my 
opinion, it is also a fair mesure.

The 18/432... is only correct if you try *all* 18 moves. But you only 
try one.

253440 is really nothing for a computer, so a simple BFS starting from 
the solved state would give the answer. That&#x27;s only for a fixed 2x2 
(i.e. chosen beforehand). I don&#x27;t know a good way to compute the 
numbers when you always &quot;choose the easiest 2x2&quot;, though.

I tried it, too, but started/ended well after Jaap and Dan. We did 
have to walk around the cubes and they had no D face, though, so you 
can&#x27;t really compare it ;-)

I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s already a record category at 
speedcubingdotcom. Also, yes, &quot;blindscrambling&quot; should be almost as 
easy as blindsolving (simply memorize the cycles the other way around, 
no?)

Replace the tiles with rubiksdotcom replacement stickers and nobody 
will notice (or will they? don&#x27;t count on it ;-) Well, at least the 
Meffert ones look just like the old Wahn cubes (I&#x27;m only talking about 
the cubies, not the stickers/tiles), don&#x27;t know how the new Rubik ones 
look like.

Hmm Eivind,

National records are set during official competitions. If u are below

Hi Stefan,

   What I&#x27;m talking about is a way of looking at it. I&#x27;m speaking
within the QTM.

   It&#x27;s a matter of how you define &quot;God&#x27;s Algorithm.&quot; I think that
within the 43 quintillion possible positions there may be an equal
number of odd numbered scrambles and even numbered scrambles. And
maybe they should be given consideration.

   There are several indicaters that we can separate algoritms into an
&quot;even numbered&quot; class, and an &quot;odd numbered&quot; class. For example: often
you can solve a position two different ways which are two moves apart
like R2 B2 R F R&#x27; B2R F&#x27; R  and R&#x27; F2 U B U&#x27; F U B&#x27; U&#x27; F R. What *is*
interesting that I have found sets of algoritms which are never 1 move
apart.

    So if we say that there could be two definitions of &quot;the longest
scramble&quot; an even numbered one and odd numbered one, then all the
possibilities are included.  In other words if say God&#x27;s algoritm was
said to be 23 moves there would be as many scrambles which would only
take 22. There is a reason I&#x27;m making this distinction.

   One of the consequences is that scrambles in competitions should be
both &quot;even numbered&quot; and &quot;odd numbered&quot; because otherwise roughly half
of the possible positions would be excluded using QTM. And even using
other metrics lots of possibilities could be unknowingly excluded. You
could accidently exclude half of the possible scrambles and not know
it. As far as I know this has never been taken into consideration in
&quot;random scrambles.&quot;

   :)

Hi David,

you do realize that two algorithms doing the same thing can *never* be 
1 QTM move apart, right? Either I misunderstand you or those sets of 
algs you mentioned aren&#x27;t really interesting (at least not for having 
no 1-distance pairs, maybe for something else ;-).

There are indeed equally many &quot;even&quot; and &quot;odd&quot; states. Doing a U turn 
from an even state is an easy bijection to prove this.

I don&#x27;t think it has been considered in (competition) rules for 
scrambling, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessary. The current rules (25 
HTM scramble) already result in an almost 50% chance to get an even 
state. Also, I don&#x27;t see how one would exploit it. Maybe in 
blindsolving because even states don&#x27;t have the parity problem which 
makes them a bit easier than odd states. But again, it&#x27;s almost 50-50 
already anyway.

Cheers!
Stefan

Hi!

A random scramble regardless of it&#x27;s length should have 50/50 chance 
of being odd/even. That is if u define ur scrambling algorithm such 
that there is equal chance of each possible number of steps a layer 
should be turned for each move.

Also, only if the competitor/solver is given the scrambling 
algorithm, or inspects the cube long enough, will it be possible to 
deduce if it is in an even or odd state. This info could be used on 
larger cubes to avoid parity, as discussed previously by Chris 
Hardwick and others.

Happy cubing!

-Per

PS! This odd/even is actually a bit more complicated than one would 
think. Consider a 5x5x5 professor cube.

Applying U breaks down like this:

Corners : odd
Central edges : odd
Outer edges : even
middle centers : odd
+/centers : odd
x/centers : odd

Applying u breaks down like this:

Corners : no effect
Central edges : no effect
Outer edges : odd
middle centers : no effect
+/centers : odd
x/centers : even

(Applying E is equivalent to (Uu)(Dd) so everything will be even. )

On the basis of this one can calculate the chance of a random 
scramble being odd/even for the various types of cubicles listed.

I tried looking at this a little more rigorously and I agree.

Here is what I came up with.

A scrambling alg generator supposedly randomly picks moves from the 
number of possible moves on a cube.  On the 2x2 and 3x3 there are 18 
moves; 36 moves for the 4x4 and 5x5, etc..  The possible turns on 
each face are two quarter turns and one double turn.  Therefore the 
chance of a face turn being an odd permutation is 2/3 and the chance 
of the face turn being an even permutation is 1/3.

If you do two turns the chance that the total permutation is even is 
1/3*1/3 + 2/3*2/3 = 5/9

If you do n turns then you can use coupled difference equations to 
see what the odds would be

Let O&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub> be the odds that after n turns the overall 
permutation is odd.

Let E&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub> be the odds that after n turns the overall 
permutation is even.

Then O&lt;sub>n+1&lt;/sub> = 1/3*O&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub> + 2/3*E&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>
E&lt;sub>n+1&lt;/sub> = 1-O&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>

With E&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>=1/3 and O&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>=2/3

I wrote a short program to calculate some odds, and here is what I 
got.

1 turn
Odd overall: 1/3
Even overall: 2/3

2 turns
Odd overall: 4/9 
Even overall: 5/9

3 turns
Odd overall: 0.48148148148148 ~ 48.15%
Even overall: 0.51851851851852 ~ 51.85%


5 turns
Odd overall: 0.49931412894376 ~ 49.93%
Even overall: 0.50068587105624 ~ 50.07%


10 turns
Odd overall: 0.49999153245610 ~ 49.99%
Even overall: 0.50000846754390 ~ 50.00%


25 turns
Odd overall: 0.49999999999980 ~ 49.99%
Even overall: 0.50000000000059 ~ 50.00%

So yeah if you do a lot of turns the odds are so ridiculously close 
to 50-50 that I probably shouldn&#x27;t have wasted my time doing 
this :)  However I do think it&#x27;s cool the way that this works out.  
I would have figured that the odds would work out differently since 
there are more possible odd permutations.  Oh well, interesting 
stuff anyway.  Also, one conclusion from this is that although the 
chance is nearly infinitesmal as n increases, you are still always 
more likely to get an even permutation over an odd permutation.

Thought that was interesting and figured I would post it.

Wow so I screwed up with typos on my first post in so many ways.  
Sorry for the multiple posts, and here are the odds again correctly.

1 turn
Odd overall: 2/3
Even overall: 1/3
 
2 turns
Odd overall: 4/9 
Even overall: 5/9

3 turns
Odd overall: 0.51851851851852 ~ 51.85%
Even overall: 0.48148148148148 ~ 48.15%
 
 
5 turns
Odd overall: 0.50205761316872 ~ 50.21%
Even overall: 0.49794238683128 ~ 49.79%
 
 
10 turns
Odd overall: 0.49999153245610 ~ 49.99%
Even overall: 0.50000846754390 ~ 50.00%
 
 
25 turns
Odd overall: 0.50000000000059 ~ 50.00%
Even overall: 0.49999999999941 ~ 49.99%

So if you use scrambling alg with an odd number of moves, you are 
infinitesmally more likely to get an odd permutation, and vice versa 
with an even length alg.

Sorry for the multiple posts.

Hmm ...

E is equivalent to (Uu)(Dd)&#x27;, and not (Uu)(Dd) as stated in original 
post ;-) So still even nevertheless.

Thanks Chris, that&#x27;s exactly what I meant. I was just too lazy to 
compute it myself ;-)

Btw, you don&#x27;t need to do that coupling stuff, just say
E_n+1 = 1/3 E_n + 2/3 (1 - E_n)
or shorter
E_n+1 = (2 - E_n) / 3

Oh, and just because you made me more interested in this, I proved 
that the difference to 50% decreases by a factor of 1/3 with each 
move. So after 25 moves the error is 0.5*(1/3^25) which is
0.00000000000059011769
confirming your 
0.50000000000059
chance for odd after 25 moves.

Now it&#x27;s also easy to choose the difference and compute the number of 
moves necessary.

Cheers!
Stefan

Hey!

I probably replied to the wrong post ... lol ... but not so important 
anyway ...

Chris, u said that there are 18 possible moves on the 2x2x2 and 
3x3x3. Well, this is basically true. For first move anyway. But 
whereas RL&#x27; does make sense on 3x3x3 it doesn&#x27;t on the 2x2x2. It will 
just be a physical move of the cube. So we get more cancellations on 
the 2x2x2 than on the 3x3x3. I took care of this when i wrote the 
scrambler available frfom the files section.

LoL ok I feel slow now.  Yeah if you do that then you can solve the 
relation for an explicit formula,

Odd(n) = (1/6)*(-1/3)^n + 1/2
Even(n) = (1/2)-(1/6)*(-1/3)^n

where n is the number of turns in your scrambling alg.  Which of 
course tends to 1/2 for both as n goes to infinity.

---------

Here is a result I found interesting too, although it is a big 
tangent to cube related stuff.

If you take 0 &lt; a &lt; 1 and setup the same relation,

A_n+1 = a*(1-A_n+1) + (1-a)*A_n
with A_0=a

and solve that for an explicit formula you get,

A(n) = (a-1/2)*[(1-a)/(1+a)]^n + 1/2
B(n) = 1-A(n) = 1/2 - (a-1/2)*[(1-a)/(1+a)]^n

which both also tend to 1/2 as n goes to infinity since (1-a)/(1+a) 
is less than 1.  So the fact that the odds a face turn produces an 
odd permutation is 2/3, and 1/3 for an even permutation, is not 
special.  It could be the case that the odds for a face turn giving 
the cube some property are 1/1000000 and the odds against are 
999999/1000000 and if you did a long enough scrambling alg it would 
still tend toward a 50-50 chance that the cube would either have 
that property or not.  In fact it works for any odds as long as n 
tends to infinity.

I guess it kinda makes more sense now, but still seems somewhat 
counter-intuitive.

Math is so cool!

Chris

I believe there are some unofficial records at speedcubing.com that 
look like this, such as cubing using only thumb and pinky, or 
whatever... However, I am not sure if it&#x27;s a good idead to do all 
these things in competition... We would have team solves, one handed 
team solves, blindfolded team solves, teamsolves under water, 4x4x4 
with feet while blindfolded, magic with feet, etc... I could go on

Hi Chris, Pers

   Before I saw the corrections, I got (by hand) not for the quarter 
turn metric, but also counting half turns (where a subsequent turn 
does not repeat a side):

1 turn
Odd overall:  0.666666666666666666666
Even overall: 0.333333333333333333333
 
2 turns
Odd overall: 0.444444444444444 
Even overall: 0.555555555555555

3 turns
Odd overall: 0.518518518518518518
Even overall: 0.481481481481481481

4 turns
Odd overall: 0.507185122569737954353338968723584 
Even overall:  0.492814877430262045646661031276416 

   Though the trend is toward 50/50, in Pers statement, >  A random 
scramble regardless of it&#x27;s length should have 50/50 chance of being 
odd/even. &lt; the part regardless of it&#x27;s length &lt; is demonstrated to 
be false when the length of the scrambles is short.

Hey!

Just out of curiousity, my claim is true if one counts turning a 
layer 0 steps as a move. LOL ... but yes u guys are correct. Simplest 
proof as n (number of moves when scrambling) goes to infinity that u 
have 50/50% chance of odd/even is still that any position is just as 
likely to show up. And that exactly half the positions are odd and 
half are even. Proof doesn&#x27;t require any formuli ;-)

Hi Stefan,

   You wrote, > you do realize that two algorithms doing the same 
thing can *never* be 1 QTM move apart, right? &lt;

   I suspected as much but hadn&#x27;t thought it through. But that&#x27;s my 
point anyway you can&#x27;t solve the &quot;longest&quot; scrambles with the same 
number of moves beacause an even number of turns can&#x27;t solve odd 
scrambles and vice versa.

> Either I misunderstand you or those sets of  algs you mentioned 
aren&#x27;t really interesting (at least not for having  no 1-distance 
pairs, maybe for something else ;-). &lt;

   Oops, I posted the wrong algs! Those two are an example of having 
a different number of turns HTM but the same QTM. I meant to post a 
pair like (I use small case to mean  slice move only):
r2 D f2 D&#x27; f&#x27; u2 f - 10 QTM 
and
R U2 R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L F2 U R U&#x27; R F&#x27; - 16  QTM.

> There are indeed equally many &quot;even&quot; and &quot;odd&quot; states. Doing a U 
turn from an even state is an easy bijection to prove this. &lt;

   I wonder whether the most scrambled state is an even number of 
turns or an odd one. So until it is determined, God&#x27;s Algorithm 
remains &quot;either an odd or even number of turns&quot; - which is what I was 
getting at.

   For a contest after the HTM scrambles are arrived at, each could 
be counted and have an QTM number. Close to half even and half odd 
QTM would be fair. Yes, blindsolving would be affected, especially 
with the 4x4x4 where parity is based on a half turn. 

Regards,

David J

Hey folks...<br>
<br>
I emailed Jessica Fridrich, she was friendly enough to reply :-)  <br>
Actually, she said that I could find some good help here.  Anyway, <br>
I&#x27;m both new to Yahoo groups and new to Cubing.  I learned to solve <br>
for the first time 3 months ago, and 4 days later I could do it from <br>
memory... then it took off.<br>
<br>
As of a few days ago my best times were between 56-59 seconds... <br>
doing the layer by layer method (though Im in the process of <br>
learning Jessica&#x27;s algorithms).<br>
<br>
So I&#x27;m looking for a few things here... we&#x27;ll start off with 2 to <br>
break the ice.<br>
<br>
1. Are there any sub 30&#x27;s people in the NorthWest? (I&#x27;m in Eugene, <br>
Oregon)<br>
2. I ordered a cube diy kit from rubiks.com, and it looks sweet, but <br>
I can&#x27;t seem to get it right.  Has anyone built one that would be <br>
willing to walk me through the best methods... it came with no <br>
instruction manual, and so I ventured into it on my own, and can&#x27;t <br>
really get springrates correct or anything like that.  It&#x27;s either <br>
really tight, or really loose (like I can grab the L and R faces, <br>
and pull the cube apart).<br>
<br>

Thanks!  I was talking to Chris (bizzkit) and he got me thinking... 
some advice would be good.


Should I spend my time learning the speedcubing.com f2l algs first 
or jessica&#x27;s algs first?  basically f2l or ll?  they&#x27;re both about 
half of the cube timewise, correct?

Thanks!  I was talking to Chris (bizzkit) and he got me thinking... 
some advice would be good.


Should I spend my time learning the speedcubing.com f2l algs first 
or jessica&#x27;s algs first?  basically f2l or ll?  they&#x27;re both about 
half of the cube timewise, correct?

Also a couple of Questions / suggestions.

I dont know if anyone else notice this or not on the NetCube but, sometimes
the scambling algo wrap down a line when displayed but sometimes not. Is
this because of the font on my computer?

I know this is pushing it but, is it possible that the personal best time
and personal best average be stored and displayed when the program is
executed? Just to have a target time to beat when doing a session. Just like
in the Ultimate Rubik&#x27;s Cube Timer.

I hope you can help me. Thnx in advance.

Hey!

That is all ur choice depending upon ur cubing technique. If u use 
lots of fingertricks it needs be a bit loose. On the other side, too 
loose and it is more prone to pop pieces. It will take a while for u 
to find out the proper tension for U. U need a cube that suits u 
regardless how other ppl finf ur cube ... hehe ... ;-)

Best of luck :-)

I also had some trouble understanding those algs. I ended up finding 
the numbers myself, going backwards from solved state and trying to 
get the displayed shapes. You can also optimize them, for example 
instead of (-3,6) do (3,0) and proceed appropriately (i.e. as if you 
had rotated the puzzle by y2).

Cheers!

The F2L is in my opinion a bit more weighted. My advice would be to 
learn F2L first. The F2L requires lots of targeted practice to get 
decent at, whereas the LL sort of fixes itself as I see it...

Wow, looking at Jon&#x27;s pictures I think this cube has everything a

Good luck with the job!  But enjoy your free time, because you miss 
it when it&#x27;s gone. *snif*

Yeah, one look at Jon&#x27;s diagrams and I knew how to put the thing 
together (I had reversed the order of the washer and spring... oops).

It&#x27;s now together and Im going to glue it today.  w00t

Hey Jordan,

When I built my DIY kits I tightened the screws until the gap 
between the center-pieces and the spindles were about 1/16&quot;.  I like 
my cubes a little tight.  This seemed to work well on both of mine, 
but might not be the same for you.  Do some experimenting to see 
what you like.

I have mine pretty loose.  I spent about 15 minutes spinning the 
sticker-less cube adjusting springs with a screw driver... i 
basically have mine loose enough to be able to spin it without much 
effort at all, but not so loose that I could get it to pop... if 
that made any sense.  Basically it&#x27;s just tight enough to keep from 
popping when I am moving my quickest/most aggressively.

I keep over shooting, as I do my first few solves (i just finish 
gluing the center pieces about 20 minutes ago... between classes and 
work.  However, I don&#x27;t have to use my wrists as much in moving the 
pieces now.  I&#x27;m pretty stoked, it&#x27;s a sweet cube (from the very few 
that I&#x27;ve tried I like this the best).

Now it&#x27;s on to build technique.  Any suggestions on how to hold the 
cube?  Ways to move each face, which fingers to use, and whatnot?  
Im at that &quot;cube orientation movement&quot; stage... I&#x27;d like to get out 
of that, it wastes a lot of time.  I&#x27;m open to suggestions...

Hey,<br>

I was surfing the net and found this:  www.stepmania.com<br>
It&#x27;s like Dance Dance Revolution for the computer.  Unless you have <br>
a PS/2 to USB convertor and a DDR pad, then you just play the songs <br>
with the arrow keys.  <br>
<br>
I&#x27;m guessing if you played it long enough, you could strengthen your <br>
fingers and improve your hand/eye coordination.  And even if it <br>
doesn&#x27;t, it seems fun anyway.<br>
<br>
You can download the DDR computer game right from stepmania.com.<br>
I just found this interesting.<br>

This message was originally meant for the Lars Petrus&#x27; mailgroup, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be that active, so I&#x27;m giving this mailgroup the same questions. It&#x27;s about the Petrus&#x27; method, and more precise, the index of step 6+7. You can find it at http://lar5.com/cube/xMain.html. Here&#x27;s the original message, any help is appreciated:<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello,<br>
I&#x27;m not sure if this mailgroup is still active, but I need some help so I&#x27;ll give it a try. I&#x27;m struggling with memorizing the step 6+7 index. This far I&#x27;ve ran into two problems that stop me from proceeding, namely the arrows that indicate edge movement and the placements of the corners. My english is far too bad to explain this in an understandable way, but I&#x27;ll give it a try:<br>
<br>
Problem 1: The arrows indicate how the edges are suppose to move, although the examples shown are not all movements possible. For instance, some &quot;circle&quot; moves can also be moved in the other way (mirrored I think you call it). In D7, http://lar5.com/cube/xD.html, that triangle of arrows can also be in the other direction.<br>
<br>
Problem 2: The thing you look for when reaching step 6+7 is the corner placement. Take the B-section for example (http://lar5.com/oldcube/xB.html). One corner is correct, the one were the black facelet is turned upwards. (on the site). The rest of the corners have their black facelets incorrect. These facelets can also be twisted in another way (I guess this is the mirrored version aswell). <br>
<br>
The questions are how I&#x27;m suppose to solve these problems. Is it just a matter of targeting? How should I think to get an understanding? Hope you understood some part of this post, and if not, I&#x27;ll get a dictionary.<br>

It doesn&#x27;t take long to learn the sequence, but it&#x27;s hard to go 
faster.  If you go too fast you knock the pyramids over, but if you 
don&#x27;t go fast enough you don&#x27;t get a good time.  So part of the 
balance is finding that &quot;slow-fast&quot; speed where you can still get a 
fast time but not knock the cups over.  That&#x27;s why I think it helps 
for the cube, since going &quot;slow-fast&quot; is still very important.

As for finding cups, I got mine off eBay for about 1/2 the price as 
they charge on the site.  They don&#x27;t seem to be on there too often, 
but it is a good deal when they are.

Koen, Justin and others you really should try it!  The cups may seem 
expensive, but it is fun to do and helps for the cube too.

Hi, if someone has a nice sequence for the following situation I <br>
would be grateful. The one I use now is really awkward.<br>
<br>
I first solve by putting together all centers and then pair up all <br>
edges (like most of you I guess). When I&#x27;m pairing up the last edges, <br>
I&#x27;m sometimes left with what seems to be only two outer edges that <br>
have swapped positions. <br>
<br>
Think of the &quot;image&quot; below as the top layer viewed from above. I want <br>
to create nice ZZZ and YYY rows so that all is left is now solving as <br>
a 3x3x3. Also, the ZZY and YYZ does not have to be in that particular <br>
relative postition to one another. If you have a sequnce which is <br>
similar with another setup, it&#x27;s almost as good.<br>

My method is likely not the best, but here&#x27;s how I approach it:

I hold the cube so that this is the front face

 XBBBX 
 ZCCCZ 
 ZCCCY   
 YCCCY
 XAAAX

Then I perform:
(U u) F U&#x27; F&#x27; U L&#x27; U L (u&#x27; U&#x27;)

That should get you to the state where one edge needs a parity fixing 
move performed on it.

Not the most efficient method I&#x27;m sure, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve always 
used.

hey guys, i&#x27;ve been working on this east coast competition, and here&#x27;s<br>
what i&#x27;ve got so far.<br>
<br>
i found out i can reserve the hoff theatre (which is the movie theatre<br>
at our student union), but to do that i need to be reserving it for a<br>
club.  thus, i am in the process of starting the &quot;Maryland Speedcubing<br>
Group&quot;.  if i get 25 students from UMD to join, i can get funding from<br>
the student government association.  this would allow me to buy 4<br>
stackmats with the tournament displays, trophies, etc.  <br>
<br>
i am thinking of setting the tournament date sometime in the spring,<br>
around march or april.  a more definite date will be set once this<br>
club gets started.  i will try to keep you east-coasters updated as<br>
more information develops.<br>

In most cases, the parentheticals are simply finger tricks.  That is 
those specific groups of moves are done with triggers and such to 
execute the whole algorithm faster.

One or two blindfolded solving pages use parenthesis in a different 
context, but generally it&#x27;s the above reason.

Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I just got my rubiks.com 5x5x5&#x27;s in the mail today and wow!!  I&#x27;m <br>
impressed :)  I bought two 5x5&#x27;s from them about a year and a half <br>
ago (spaced out by around a month or so) and both were not very good <br>
cubes at all.  The center pieces were malformed or something and <br>
were very uneven when you looked across a face.  Also for both <br>
cubes, after I lubed them once they would explode after only 30-40 <br>
moves of a solve.<br>
<br>
Well the ones I just got are very, very nice by comparison!  I can&#x27;t <br>
wait till these break in.<br>
<br>
Anyway I had talked in the past about how I didn&#x27;t like the <br>
rubiks.com 5x5&#x27;s, or at least the older ones, but these newer ones <br>
are really nice.  I would recommend them.<br>

I think the SAT&#x27;s are more of a coastal thing, around here all you 
need is the ACT scores and maybe one or two of the SAT II subject 
tests. (all I needed anyway)

I&#x27;ll warn you now though... I recall a few times where the group 
didn&#x27;t respond all too kindly to discussion of an &quot;objective measure 
of intelligents&quot; such as IQ tests and the like.  This may be treated 
in the same manner (just a friendly heads up).  I don&#x27;t quite know 
why, but that seems to be the case.

What kind of correlation are you trying to look for? What statistic is it?
Spearman&#x27;s ranked correlation coefficient?
Pearson&#x27;s product-moment correlation coefficient?
Kendall&#x27;s coefficient of concordance? (Not exactly what you&#x27;re after,
I suppose.)

Are you looking for a linear correlation?

I&#x27;d douby there is much of a link (other than indirectly through some
related thing like &quot;geeks do maths, geeks spend time on the cube&quot;)
because bein fast at the cube really doesn&#x27;t require mathematical
ability (then again perhaps the SAT doesn&#x27;t?).

Hey Chris!

Very niiiice ;-) Then i think i should be ordering more cubes ASAP. 
Both revenge and professor. I need some good &quot;spare&quot; cubes and maybe, 
who knows, the new one could be better than the one i have now? :D I 
expect to see u start doing some good 5x5x5 times pretty soon now.

Happy cubing!!

Thanks. Thats exactly what I was looking for. Thanks to David and
Daniel too, but this was more to my liking.

I wonder if you could make anyone feel less

Not really. What was aggressive? I&#x27;m just asking some questions. I&#x27;m 
not trying to make anyone feel bad. I can&#x27;t see that there&#x27;s 
anything aggressive about being curious as to the question.

All I&#x27;m saying is that if some sort of correlation is sought (and 
that seemed to be the case) and in a mathematical sense (and that 
also seemed to be the case given that maths was mentioned) then one 
has to consider the sort of correlation that one wants to use.
For instance, for a ranked correlation configuration one wouldn&#x27;t 
need to know the times of the cubists, just who was best, who was 
next best and so forth, but for a product-moment correlation 
coefficient you&#x27;d actually need the times. (In any event, you&#x27;d want 
to ask &quot;What is your (SAT score, best time)&quot;? Now, the latter 
statistic - best time - is probably fairly well tabulated for many 
people around here so it might be sufficient just to collect the 
scores. (Possibly &quot;best average&quot; instead of &quot;best time&quot; - of course, 
then one could go into what kind of average: arithmetic mean, 
geometric mean, harmonic mean, root-mean-square etc., but you&#x27;d 
probably detest me for that.)

It&#x27;s just a question of asking what is being looked for. The latter 
part was just a statement of opinion. It&#x27;s not trying to say 
anything about stupidity or anything like that - in fact, I just 
said that I doubted there&#x27;d be a correlation. That&#x27;s hardly saying 
that it&#x27;s a stupid question. If I&#x27;d been of that mind, I wouldn&#x27;t 
have used the word doubt. All I&#x27;m saying is that, personally, I 
can&#x27;t see why there&#x27;d be a connection. It&#x27;s perhaps like chess. 
There are many excellent chess players who aren&#x27;t good at maths - 
e.g. Nigel Short - and vice versa. To be good at chess requires some 
kind of ability but not necessarily mathematical. I&#x27;d imagine the 
same goes for (speed) cubing. It requires certain abilities 
(dexterity, pattern recognition and so forth), but nothing really 
mathematical. I&#x27;d go as far as to say that I don&#x27;t think 
mathematical ability is necessary to do the cube well and that being 
good at maths doesn&#x27;t mean you can do the cube well. Trying to make 
a connection is not stupid, but I would question why try to make 
that connection - as opposed to say a connection between cubing and 
another dexterous activity (as in juggling (Macky), cup stacking 
(Chris) etc.).

(In-depth) theory of the cube can involve some mathematical ability -
 after all it&#x27;s just a study of a particular group and set of 
generators, but I don&#x27;t know if any of the people who look into cube 
theory are really fast. (Of course, I don&#x27;t actually know anybody 
who does cube theory, so I&#x27;m not particularly well-informed.) Even 
if they are, it&#x27;s unlikely that their theory has much connection 
with their speed.

Your post is more aggressive - it contains swearing, accusation and 
has no foundation in fact. The only thing that might be 
objectionable is the &quot;geeks&quot; part, but if that&#x27;s the case then I&#x27;m 
being self-effacing as much as anything (not that I&#x27;m claiming to 
have cube skills).

some<br>
&gt; related thing like &quot;geeks do maths, geeks spend time on the cube&quot;)<br>
&gt; because bein fast at the cube really doesn&#x27;t require mathematical<br>

<br>
I think there&#x27;s a link. The one called &quot;determination&quot;. People <br>
practicing excessively just to become faster solving the cube might be <br>
the same people preparing excessively for tests like SAT.<br>
<br>
In any case, I think it would make more sense to not only ask a small <br>
extreme group. Some &quot;normal&quot; people should be asked, too. Then we <br>
could compare speedcuber-yes/no to goodAtSAT-yes/no. Maybe that was <br>
the original intent for asking? Maybe he has asked another group of <br>
people as well? Although asking this way gets you bad data, since <br>
people with different SAT results will differ in their enthusiasm to <br>

Lemme first say that you guys have been a great help.  I&#x27;ve been <br>
having so much fun learning new algorithms, and trying to solve the <br>
puzzle smarter, not faster.<br>
<br>
Could someone do me a favor and solve the cube really slowly?  Like <br>
only 1 to 2 moves per second, slowing down all triggers and what <br>
not?  I am trying to get out of the habit of spinning the cube to <br>
look around; Im trying to learn to solve the cube from the same <br>
orientation all the way through.  I have a lot of trouble moving the <br>
B face without moving my thumbs... and then when I do, I think i <br>
must be doing something wrong.  I know Im quite terrible at solving <br>
the cube, but Im going make a video of me solving solely for the <br>
purpose of getting feedback from experienced solvers and getting <br>
tips.  But if I could see you guys solve the cube slowly, that would <br>
be great.  Actually, I see videos of the last layer, so forget that, <br>
stop before the last layer if you like... what I REALLY need to see <br>
is the F2L done slowly.<br>
<br>
Thanks to anyone who can help.<br>

Okay, as promised:

http://home.comcast.net/~timbeckett/SlowSolve1.wmv
http://home.comcast.net/~timbeckett/SlowSolve2.wmv

The first one was scrambled to 
LR2B2DL&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;D&#x27;U&#x27;L&#x27;F2RBL&#x27;F&#x27;U&#x27;DF&#x27;L&#x27;RD&#x27;B&#x27;F2L&#x27;R2

and I can&#x27;t remember the second one :-)  I didn&#x27;t study that second

Now I know the experienced cubers are going to be kicking themselves 
watching me... and I do need some help, but constructive criticism 
only  :-)   Thanks guys.

<br>
I put a video on the internet, it is a slow replay of a solve which was 16.12 seconds, ie I went back to the same scramble and did the same thing that I did when going for speed. I point to each corner/edge pair before I solve them.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t think it matters too much if you rotate, as long as the rotation is part of a move so you can keep moving through the solution fluently and quickly.<br>

Thanks Stefan for sharing your method.<br>
I read your &#x27;old&#x27; page as well, but havent really tried it my self <br>
(at least not blindfolded).<br>
I&#x27;m very interested in learning it in the long run though so I&#x27;m <br>
gonna read the new page and give you some feedback (after I tried it <br>

The things in the parenthisis are called finger shortcuts or tricks. 
(R&#x27;UR) can for example be done very rapidly if you click the upper 
layer with you right index finger. Another one I like is (R&#x27;UR&#x27;FR). 
You can find vids showing finger tricks on Dan Knights site.

A fantastic FMC this week, several successful solutions under 30 moves were posted, and we had an amazing 3 winners, and 5 first places were given out!<br>
<br>
Charles, how you only got 6th place in the STM category with 29 moves is unbelievable!<br>
<br>
SO check out the results on my site - www.cubestation.co.uk , and have a go next week, I shall release the scramble later on this evening :)<br>

HOLY CRAP TYSON.  That freaking rocks.  Thanks!  Im going to slow 
your video down and watch your motion...  Where did you learn your 
F2L algs?  How did you go about memorizing them?
(btw, the background music rocks).

Im off to work (Costco pwns my soul) then I&#x27;ll come home and break 
out the cube.  Thanks again!

A while back I mentioned here that Uwe Meffert is thinking about <br>
reproducing the Dogic. There was not much interest here (but at <br>
twistypuzzles.com we&#x27;re very excited), but I&#x27;d like to give you an <br>
update anyway. They might start production early December, more <br>
details and discussion can be found here:<br>
http://www.twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3191<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m particularly interested in it because of the complexity, 2.1*10^82 <br>
positions, even more than the 5x5, which has 2.8*10^74 positions <br>
(thanks to Jaap for the numbers).<br>

hey stefan..thanks for posting your guide..im interested in solving
blindfolded..i understand most of your guide but when i was trying to
plan out the edge swaps on a different scramble then the one on your
site.. i go through each color, starting with the one in the
buffer..then to the one thats in where that needs to go..but then
eventually ill get to the edge peice that is supposed to go where the
buffer is.. so how do i note this..and what peice do i next..(this is
all during the memorization of that &quot;long&quot; string of colors..)

thats really the only part i dont get. thanks

I hear ya... im a musician as well.  Im studying guitar performance 
at the university of Oregon school of music.  I also play peeyano. 
And I&#x27;ve sang in choirs almost as long as I&#x27;ve played guitar.

I uploaded a recording of the choir I was in Summer of 2003, My 
Senior year summer.  It&#x27;s J.S.Bach&#x27;s 5th motet &quot;Singet dem Hernn ein 
neues Lied&quot;  (spelling&#x27;s off a bit)  BMV 225 I believe...

should be:

it&#x27;s 29 megs *56 go away!* but it should stream for you.

ok i still dont get my last message..but ive been trying to understand
other parts and realized i dont really get the setup moves..i was
trying to do the cube using your method and almost everytime i would
place a edge, it would be flipped.

that is because im using the wrong setup moves...how do you know which
setup moves to use..cause the difference between FR and RF are
slim..and then to know a different alg for each one

how do you do that part?

(and i still need to know about my last question)  thanks again

greetings everyone,<br>
<br>
the rubik&#x27;s timer project that i started back in may has come quite <br>
a ways since i last posted about it.  i use it daily to time my <br>
solves as part of the effort to work all the problems out.  i still <br>
hope to meet the goal of selling the timer on rubiks.com by spring <br>
time.<br>
<br>
there are quite a list of features in this timer, including various <br>
averaging modes, storing the last 250 times, scramble generator, <br>
speed-stacks output port, etc.  i invite you to browse through the <br>
project journal at the mission-designs website, located at:<br>
    http://www.mission-designs.com/timer/journal.htm<br>
<br>
feel free to leave feedback as well through the rubik&#x27;s timer email <br>

Looks like one hell of a timer you&#x27;ve built there!  Any chance of 
getting a vid of the prototype in action?

Keep up the good work!

First off I must say this looks like a real stackmat killer. I would 
just love to have it. 

I second the request of a video of it in action. I also have to 
additional requests: (1) The option of taking the median time of n 
times, rolling or not rolling. (2) Scrambles for the 2x2x2, 4x4x4 and 
5x5x5.

I also posted this to your e-mail in case you don&#x27;t scan this group 
very often.

yo dude :-)<br>
<br>
Thanks for the feedback. I&#x27;m already in the process of improving the <br>
page and I&#x27;ll try to cover your questions better in the next version.<br>
<br>
&gt; i was<br>
&gt; trying to do the cube using your method and almost everytime i would<br>
&gt; place a edge, it would be flipped.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; that is because im using the wrong setup moves...how do you know <br>
which<br>
&gt; setup moves to use..cause the difference between FR and RF are<br>
&gt; slim<br>
<br>
Instead of thinking of the cubie, think about the *sticker*. Think <br>
about the T-permutation alg. It shoots the UR edge to UL. Think of <br>
this as the U sticker of UR going to the U sticker place of UL. And <br>
for FR, think about its F sticker and for RF, think about its R <br>
sticker. So for FR, you need to bring its F sticker to the U of UL. <br>
Setup (d2 L) will do this. For RF, the R sticker needs to go to the U <br>
of UL. Setup (d&#x27; L&#x27;) will do. Follow the sticker, not the cubie. Does <br>
that help? I&#x27;m so much used to it that I forgot to explain it.<br>
<br>
&gt; when i was trying to<br>
&gt; plan out the edge swaps on a different scramble then the one on your<br>
&gt; site.. i go through each color, starting with the one in the<br>
&gt; buffer..then to the one thats in where that needs to go..but then<br>
&gt; eventually ill get to the edge peice that is supposed to go where <br>
the<br>
&gt; buffer is.. so how do i note this..and what peice do i next..<br>
<br>
When you find the buffer cubie somewhere, ignore it. That just means <br>
you&#x27;ve completed the first cycle.<br>
<br>
After that you&#x27;ll have to do the remaining cycles, one by one (unless <br>
you&#x27;re lucky and there&#x27;s only one cycle, containing all wrong edges). <br>
For each cycle, you first have to &quot;break it open&quot;. That means you have <br>
to add the place of an unsolved cubie to the sequence you memorize. <br>
Immediately followed by the edge cubie in that place.<br>
<br>
Have a look at my example again, in particular the step where I first <br>
say &quot;Exception&quot; and the next step.<br>
<br>
So for each cycle, you memorize something like (A B C D A), the first <br>
item being the same as the last. Just the first cycle, the one that <br>
starts with the buffer, would look like (B C D) instead, simply <br>
leaving out the A=buffer at start and end.<br>
<br>
I once emailed a better example to someone... will include this in the <br>
next version of my page.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Stefan<br>

Recently I started really practicing the 4x4 and I&#x27;d like to compare <br>
some times to other people. I turn it into a 3x3, first centers, then <br>
pair up edges.<br>
<br>
An average (17.66) for only solving centers:<br>
17.61 18.13 18.34 (14.81) 17.85 18.33 15.88 18.18 17.37 17.04 17.88 <br>
(18.64)<br>
<br>
An average (58.64) for only solving centers and pairing edges:<br>
1:05.46 1:04.50 53.03 1:05.48 51.18 (1:14.34) 1:02.96 51.77 54.75 (50.<br>
74) 57.34 59.89<br>
<br>
Note that these were 24 solves, i.e. the first average has nothing to <br>
do with the second. My best regular average for 4x4 is 1:33, btw. I&#x27;m <br>
just trying to find out where I &quot;lose&quot; the most time (compared to <br>
others). So, what are your times for this?<br>

thanks for the compliments.  the answers to the questions that have 
been asked are on the mission designs website.

i have considered making a video of using the timer.  i was not sure 
if there was enough interest yet to warrant spending the time to 
convert an analog video to mpeg2.  if there is enough interest i can 
take a couple hours and record myself using it to time myself 
solving, and maybe walk through some of the options, then convert to 
mpeg2 and post it online.  be warned though that i&#x27;m a much better 
engineer than speed solver... :)  my general average is usually 
around 30 seconds.

take care,
eric

ok..when do you think the next version will be out

cause i still dont really get how to think about it when i get to the
buffer cubie..cause that cube will end up in the buffer, and then
what..i just pick a cube that wont be solved yet i guess?

i think thats what i do..

          <div class="email-content">Okay, I&#x27;ve had my break now since organizing the fall tournament but <br>
it&#x27;s time to get back into business.  What do people think about a <br>
tournament in Northern California in the city of Burlingame on <br>
Saturday, January 15, 2005?  (I hope that date is a Saturday... I mean <br>
for it to be on a Saturday.)  It&#x27;s a long weekend so I&#x27;m hoping maybe <br>
some of the Southern California people would be willing to drive up.  I <br>
myself will probably drive and I&#x27;ll probably have room for one <br>
person...<br>
<br>
I will begin contacting various locations for a possible venue tomorrow <br>
after I hopefully survive an orienteering course tomorrow.  I&#x27;m <br>
thinking of the Burlingame Public Library in particular.  There are <br>
other venues in the bay area as well.  Ideally, I&#x27;d like at least 10 <br>
people to compete in this tournament so please respond to this (on the <br>
caltech group as to save clutter) if you&#x27;re interested so I know <br>
whether to have a cube tournament or whether to have a cube gathering.<br>
<br>
On another note, work is being done on the Caltech winter tournament.  <br>
More news on that later.<br>

Hi Group.  This post is long, but it&#x27;s important.  <br>
<br>
It&#x27;s obvious that the quality of Rubik&#x27;s brand puzzles have been <br>
getting better lately.  We keep hearing about the Rubik&#x27;s Revenge <br>
getting better, and now lately even the Professor&#x27;s Cube.  In the <br>
midst of these improvements, are manufacturing errors still <br>
occuring?  Yes, of course.  Faulty products are going to happen, as <br>
no manufacturing process is going to be completely perfect.  The <br>
concern is not that accidents are happening, but the way in which <br>
these accidents are being handled by the company.<br>
<br>
Sometimes with big companies, certain customer interests are <br>
infringed upon.  These interests may include, and are not limited to: <br>
Unfair prices, faulty products, poor customer service, et cetera.  <br>
How does the Rubik&#x27;s brand hold up against our interests?  The short <br>
answer is, very well.  The prices are fair.  Faulty products don&#x27;t <br>
occur often enough to raise concern. <br>
<br>
I bought a few Rubik&#x27;s 3x3x3s this summer.  Each one was newer, with <br>
the serial numbers on the corner.  One of the cubes turned horribly <br>
out of the package.  It turned out that during the manufacturing <br>
process a terrible error had occured.  The plastic on the axel was <br>
contorted slightly.  I attempted to fix the error by sanding down the <br>
plastic, lubing the cube, and hoping the problem would wear itself <br>
out naturally.  After about a month of use the cube had not improved <br>
much, if at all.  Of course by this time, it was too late to return a <br>
cube to Wal-Mart.  Instead of launching a search for a replacement <br>
cube, I decided to search for some valuable answers.  Why did this <br>
error occur?  How often does this error occur?  I&#x27;ve directed these <br>
questions to a Seven Town&#x27;s Representative, and in return I didn&#x27;t <br>
recieve answers to my most important questions.  Naturally this is <br>
frustrating, and the burden of dealing with this issue raised some <br>
new questions.  If the 9$ I spent only bought a mess of plastic, was <br>
I really just paying for an inconvenience?  How important is it to <br>
keep a customer happy?  Customers in general must be kept happy, but <br>
the individual may not hold the same bearing.  <br>
<br>
The responsibility lies on the company to produce a quality product.  <br>
As customers, faulty products are annoying, they are frustrating, and <br>
they are not what we paid for.  When we do have to deal with this <br>
issue, it only adds to the frustration when our questions are not <br>
being answered. Because when we buy a bad product, our money should <br>
at least pay for an explanation.  The misjudgement was not returning <br>
the puzzle right away upon discovering its defect, but you really <br>
have to ask yourself; is this something we should have to deal with <br>
in the first place?  It shouldn&#x27;t be a gamble when it comes to buying <br>
a product, regardless of that product&#x27;s nature.  <br>
<br>

before turning any faces..tell us the each color of the cycle and how

Hi!<br>
<br>
Im looking for a nice and easy way to add an digital stopwatch to AVI <br>
movie files. This is so that can shoot a cube solving movie with my <br>
webcam. Then do some very basic editing and show the stopwatch at the <br>
bottom of the movie. Time should stay at 00:00.00 until solve starts <br>
and then time starts running when i solve. And it will show the final <br>
time when the cube is solved (time remains visible on screen). <br>
Ideally this is added when i record, so that i use keyboard to <br>
start/stop stopwatch (and possibly also the videostream capture). Or <br>
it could be added later as an overlay. Anyone has any idea about an <br>
idea and free way to do this (freeware)? Yes i know i can work with <br>
individual frames. But that&#x27;s a definite NO!! if i wanna shoot 5x5x5 <br>
solving videos at a decent framrate.<br>
<br>
All help is welcome :-)<br>

Hi Per,

You probably mean something like this:

avi

I know Koen did this with vegas 5.0  
(http://mediasoftware.sonypictures.com/products/showproduct.asp?
pid=914). But he also told me that it was not very easy to do it, so 
maybe you should e-mail him about that.

Something like this can be done in just a few second in Vegas Video:

I can tell you how over email if you would like.

Hopefully next weekend. I have a new job now which will take some time

Yes, exactly. Instead of swapping a wrong cubie from the buffer to its 
goal, just swap an unsolved cubie *into* the buffer.

I plan on describing the principles and how to read cycles so 
hopefully that will answer the question. Stay tuned :-)

Hey Evan,

What you want to do with the cycles is to solve them in the most 
convenient order by using repeated 3-cycles, or if you&#x27;re crazy 
using maybe a 5-cycle in there.

I&#x27;m not sure if we number the pieces the same way, but if I saw the 
cycle (18274) I would just read it left to right and solve using 3 
cycles.  Say you do the 3 cycle (182) on your cube, which is the 
first three terms in your larger cycle that needs to be done.  This 
cycles 1 to 8 and 8 to 2 (which needs to happen based on your larger 
cycle btw).  However it also cycles 2 to 1, but 2 actually needs to 
go to 7 (reading your actual larger cycle).  However by doing this 
three cycle you have cycled 2 pieces to their correct location, and 
now you can replace your larger cycle with (174).  This is because 
the piece that was in 2&#x27;s (the 7 piece) went to 1.  So now 1 needs 
to go to 7.

Now finish with (174) and the cube is solved.

If you had the cycle (12345678) you would do (123)

This reduces your cycle to (145678).  Now do (145) and you end up 
with (1678).  Do (167) and you end up with (18).  You may or may not 
have to do some setup moves to get these pieces in the same layer, 
then do a single quarter move and solve the remaing three cycle.

To make things simpler, if you end up with UBL and UBR having to 
switch, for me this is the cycle (12), then you can do the single 
face turn U which leaves you with a three cycle.  Based on my 
numbering of the pieces that cycle would be (134).

For three cycles I use R&#x27;FR&#x27;B2RF&#x27;R&#x27;B2R2 and its inverse.  You will 
often have to do setup moves to get your three pieces into the U 
layer to perform the cycle.

Most of the setup moves are obvious, but this one is kinda weird.  
If you have to cycle UBL to DFL to UFR then I would do DF2DR2 to get 
them all into the U layer, three cycle them, then undo with R2D&#x27;F2D&#x27;

Hope that helps some,
Chris

Hey!

The video Tyson made uses the codec MJPeg. I found this out using the 
excellent GSpot codec analyser. My webcam (Logitech Quickcam pro 
4000) will capture in IV50 (Intel Video) format. I do conversion to 
wmv with the very easy StoikVideoConverter (free!!). For conversion 
to DivX and other formats i use VirtualDub.

Anyone here who knows hot to add a stopwatch (running time) to my 
videos please reply or send me an email at : aspiring_to_love(at)
yahoo.no

Happy cubing (and shooting ;-)  )

-Per

PS! I tested the Stoik-app on Tyson&#x27;s video and i successfully 
converted to 384 kbps wmv (1.3 MB). Im not sure how the MJPeg codec 
came into my computer, maybe through DivX package or it was 
automatically downloaded from net through my MediaPlayer9 ?? That 
codec shouldn&#x27;t be hard to find on the net anyway ;-)

Great video, another good camera angle which I use is to balance the camera on your shoulder whilst solving. Then you get the feeling of actually looking through the eyes of the solver as it were.<br>
<br>
I noticed, that you, like me, and I suspect a lot of fast cubers in the 17-20 range have the same problem. Having mastered the first two layers, I neglected my LL, and now recognition and getting the PLL into position is slow, and where I am losing at least 2! seconds.

Why do you always hide the possibility to do it with 2-cycles?

;-)

Could also be done as
1. F2
2. PLL that swaps UBL and UFR
3. F2
4. PLL that swaps UBL and UFR

You balance the camera on your shoulder? Mine would surely fall off if
 I did that, and I really wouldnt want my camera to fall off...

Does anyone have any camera-friendly ways of making a video from this

I remember this coming up in some form or another a while back, but I <br>

<br>
I have a Rubik&#x27;s Game cube that I want to switch the tiles on from the <br>
old color scheme to the BOY scheme.  To do that, I only need to switch <br>
out two adjacent faces.  I know that I can flip the edge that these two <br>
faces share, and I also know that instead of swapping 4 tiles total on <br>
the two corners that the two faces share, I can just swap the tile on <br>
both of those corners that neither of the two faces share, and just <br>
switch those two corners out.<br>
<br>
What else can I do to minimize the number of tiles I have to swap out?  <br>
Less tiles to swap = less painful puncture wounds on my index fingers <br>
from that slippery X-acto knife ;)<br>
<br>

If the two faces are U and F, you can switch the UR and FR pieces, and

According to the WCA Tournament regulations, 40 moves for both 
puzzles. (This includes slice moves, but NOT the kind of slice moves 
that are equivalent with doing L and R&#x27; at the same time.)

          <div class="email-content">Well, far from it for me to tell Lars&#x27; method, but he has mastered the system of recognising the permutation from looking at any two sides of the cube.

This can be done, as many of you will know, by first looking at the corners on each face, and noting whether they are the same, oppositely coloured, or adjacently coloured, and then realising the edge situation afterwards. Every permutation has a definite (if cometimes very subtle) difference. :)

Try experimenting with the PLL&#x27;s, a good place to start is to notice which PLL&#x27;s have corners the same (eg 3-edge cycles), oppositely coloured (eg the &quot;arrow&quot;) or adjacently coloured (3-edge and 3-corner cycles).

Have fun, and good luck! (BTW Joel, nice to hear that you still remember my recognition trick!)

Hi Doug,

   You might want to consider wearing work gloves when using something
that sharp.

   How do you intend to use a scalpel on a Rubik&#x27;s Game cube when the
tiles are sunk into a trough and not laying flat on a flat surface?

Actually, I&#x27;ve already done this procedure once, but I didn&#x27;t think of 
any better way of switching the tiles than by switching 16 and flipping 
the one edge.  The X-acto knife I use has a blade that is kind of 
wave-shaped so I can push the blade down towards my desk (the sliced 
finger thing was a joke, although I know it has happened to other 
people) whithout having any of my fingers in the way.

The blade is narrow enough that if I look for the slight indentions on 
top of the trough on the two sides that are flush with the sloped ends 
of the trough, I can get the tiles out of the trough sans damage about 
95% of the time.  I basically just work it in and break the glue on the 
two opposite sides.

Hey Joël... feel welcome to tell us about it any time you wish. Right
now I recognize that permutation only because I see it can&#x27;t be any

Hi all,<br>
<br>
as I have watched one video from a recent contest, I realized that<br>
(when viewed by frames) the world record reached there is probably<br>
not really valid according to the official rules.<br>
To be more specific: the competitor is touching the puzzle after<br>
the time is stopped and for the particular puzzlethe difference<br>
could be quite significant.<br>
<br>
I really do not want to be more concrete now, because I think that<br>
it is too late to change results. I only want to discuss it for<br>
the future contests. With competitors nearer to the time limits<br>
are forced to optimize starting and stopping the timer to the<br>
border of area of violating rules... And I think that it is going<br>
to be more and more serious as more and more competitors are<br>
closer to the winning times... (It is more and more similar<br>
to olympic sports where were huge number of various protests and<br>
protests to protests and so on...)<br>
<br>
That is why we should add a rule (to the WCA rules) about<br>
protests (time limits, evidences, comitee, etc.).<br>
The drawback is that the competitions would be less fun for<br>
some groups of people, however, it starts to be the case anyway,<br>
because loosing in a competition can mean a big financial loss...<br>

well basically it generates a face (1 of 6) and a turn-metric (1 of 
3: 90, -90, 180).  then it looks at the previous move&#x27;s face.  if 
the proposed move&#x27;s face is the same as the previous move&#x27;s face, 
then regenerate the face until the proposed move&#x27;s face is different 
from the previous move&#x27;s face (obviously).  then it looks at the 
previous 2 moves.  if the previous 2 moves and the proposed move are 
all in parallel planes, then it regenerates the proposed move&#x27;s face 
until the previous 2 moves and the proposed move are not all in 
parallel planes (this prevents 3 consecutive moves in the same 
plane).

i&#x27;d be happy to add additional logic to further improve the 
generator.  please suggest what might be done to improve.

also, the random generator itself is a neat alg that i got from a 
statistical website.  i.e., the random number generator is NOT 
something like:
    R(n+1) = (R(n) * big_prime1) + big_prime2
rather it is a more sophisticated algorithm that actually passes all 
the major statistical tests, although the alg is not cryptographicly 
secure.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
I wrote about this during the summer.  I&#x27;m sure many of you are <br>
familiar with the Paul Hamm incident.  Everything was fine until they <br>
went and checked the video and then they started complaining about <br>
things.  There was no protest brought forth at the time of the <br>
competition.  The judge did not see the violation.  Umpires in sports <br>
blow calls all the time but the calls stay.  The solve is valid and the <br>
time will stay.<br>
<br>
This is regardless of the video.  In order for a rule violation to <br>
occur, the judge must declare a rule violation to the tournament <br>
director.  If there is a protest and people believe a rule violation <br>
has occurred but the judge did not declare it, the protest must be <br>
filed in a reasonable amount of time and I&#x27;d like this to be <br>
interpreted as &quot;during the competition and before the award&#x27;s <br>
ceremony.&quot;<br>
<br>
Time Limit for Protest:  Protests must be filed before the placement <br>
and rankings of the competitor&#x27;s are finalized.  Tournament organizers <br>
should spend at least five minutes after each round checking over <br>
results and making sure that the spread sheet is operational.<br>
<br>
Video Evidence:  Judges and the tournament organizers may NOT consult <br>
video evidence in making decisions.  Not every solve is recorded and it <br>
would be unfair that some people have extra scrutiny over others.  We <br>
must rely on the good faith and honesty of the people who choose to be <br>
judges.  We must believe that the judges will be unbiased when judging <br>
their friends as this is in the nature of this sport.  As the <br>
organization and the sport grows, we should reach a point where we have <br>
enough organizers that judges can be more of a distinct entity from the <br>
competitors.  This is why I hesitate to compete in tournaments that I <br>
run.  (It also makes me less efficient.)<br>
<br>
Committee:  The protest must be brought forth to the WCA member or WCA <br>
appointed representative at that tournament.  This means if you&#x27;re <br>
tournament does not have a WCA member or a WCA appointed representative <br>
present, it&#x27;s not official.  The WCA members or representatives present <br>
at the tournament will make the decision regarding the protest.<br>
<br>
These are the rules that my tournaments have been following.  We have <br>
been fortunate enough not to have any type of protest.  In the final <br>
round, because there are fewer competitors, I would like to suggest <br>
that more than one judge preside over the solve.<br>
<br>
As for video evidence, this is the rule now.  We do not have the <br>
capacity to record every solve yet but I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be hard if we <br>
can find one person with a camera.  When the organization is large <br>
enough that they can expend several people throughout the duration of <br>
the tournament to do nothing but video tape solves, then we can have <br>
mandatory video recording.  As of now, because this is not possible, <br>
video evidence will not be allowed whatsoever in the determination of <br>
protests.<br>

Hi Tyson,

   I want to thank you for consistant and intelligently updating the
competition side of things.

   I think it should be noted that Yang Tae-young did an extra,
illegal &quot;hold&quot; move in his routine, and the contoversial point in
would have been deducted anyway. The officials made two errors which
cancel out and Paul Hamm did in fact win the Gold fairly. 

Regards,

David J

Hey!

I&#x27;d just like to mention that videos can be tempered with. Especially 
videos that &quot;appear&quot; a while after the incident/event that was shot. 
If an umpire hasn&#x27;t spotted anything wrong during a solve that is an 
indication that nothing seriously wrong could have happened. That 
touching cube rule is a bit harsh. I can understand if the cube 
wasn&#x27;t solved and the competitor managed to say complete the last 
move by fingertrigering a layer to get that done. So i agree that one 
shouldn&#x27;t overrule original judgement with hindsight unless something 
was spotted and reported by the judge during a solve. And then this 
report led to investigation into the incident ... well u should get 
the idea. Too detailed rules will only serve to complicate judging, 
and won&#x27;t really lead to fairer judgment in my opinion :-)

I believe that 40 is the accepted scramble for the 4x4x4 but you 
need ***60*** for a 5x5x5 scramble.  At least 60 turns were used in 
Toronto and Tyson&#x27;s scrambles for the US championship were 60 moves.

Hi,<br>
<br>
I do not want to complicate anything.<br>
If the rule was &quot;Judge is allways right and no protests can be<br>

to prevent things...<br>
There can be any other rule for accepting protests, but again<br>

Is it a matter of generating random numbers, putting them into a 
table and selecting one (and replacing it by a new random number) at 
random, using a second linear-congruential r.n. generator for the 
selection process?  If not, please would you post the link?  I&#x27;d be

no it is nothing like a linear-congruential RNG.  the algorithm is 
called &quot;mersenne twister&quot;.  there are lots of web sites discussing

Fascinating.  Many thanks -- I&#x27;ve never seen this before.  It should 
be useful the next time I do a MC calculation; potential correlations 
in LCM have always been a worry.

          <div class="email-content">Hey everybody<br>
I&#x27;m François Sechet, the guy who organized the Ile-de-France Championships. I just wanted to say a few words about it, I guess noone here cares because no one was there, anyway...<br>
For those who haven&#x27;t seen the results, the standards were pretty high. The French Record has been broken twice (almost 3 times) and Frederick Badie was very impressive with his 4x4 and 5x5 records. Too bad none of us got to finish the Blindfolded solves, and as Gilles said afterwards, we could&#x27;ve done a FMC event instead of blindfolded. Other than that, it was a nice day, good mood, everything went pretty well.<br>
A few things I want to come up with. I know Gilles already refered to Ron about it, but we had a few problems with some rules. Nothing very important actually, but still.<br>
1. 4x4 and 5x5 events. I checked personnally almost every single scrambled cube, and I think it occured only once, but I noticed one 5x5 has been given to the competitor with the wrong scramble. We should have solved it and scrambled it again, then give it back to the competitor, but we gave it straight away to the competitor, maily because we were (by the time) short of time (we weren&#x27;t sure of the time we would have to empty the room). What should we do in this case? It wasn&#x27;t a very important solve anyway, since the guy got 8 mins something on it, but what if... My thoughts about this case was that it doesn&#x27;t change a lot during a 5x5 solve, plus the competitor didn&#x27;t complain/notice. It&#x27;s my mistake anyway, I should have solved it and rescrambled it.<br>
2. During the first round of the 3x3x3 event, Sebastien Felix started and accidentaly stopped the timer after 0.38s. We (the judges and Sebastien) decided to give him an extra solve. Now, even if it wouldn&#x27;t have changed anything to the final result, I think we should haveacted otherwise. The rules say, &quot;the competitor is responsible for starting and stopping the timer&quot;, and &quot;after finishing his solve and stopping the timer, the competitor isn&#x27;t allowed to touch the puzzle bafore being told to do so&quot; or something in that direction. Now, when we analyze what happened, it&#x27;s clear that when Sebastien stopped the timer, the cube wasn&#x27;t solved, plus he was still performing moves on it. So I think we should have disqualified the solve. It didn&#x27;t really matter, since it was a &quot;best of&quot; round, and since he already had a time under 30s he was already mathematically qualified for the final.<br>
These are IMHO all the major mistakes done during the champs. Of course, after a few days, and without the pressure (there isn&#x27;t only pressure for the competitors, I tell you), I think we should have acted an other way. Errare humanum est, as they said...<br>
Other than that, it was a fine day for me... Thanks to anyone who helped me in any way (Ron and Tyson from the WCA committee, Dave Jones who niceley sent me a timer from London 10 days before the competition so I could do with 2 and not only one, thanks for the stickers and the trophies and goodies, and thanks to anyone who helped with the organisation, may the ones I forgot be thanked too).<br>
Just my humble thoughts, in the exactly same humble value of 2 cents...<br>
François<br>
PS: Dave, I will give the timers back to WM next Tuesday I think. I hope it&#x27;s not a problem.<br>

Hi Gilles, Tyson,

   Very interesting idea.

   When the cube is solved you can&#x27;t see directly though it because
opposing sides have opposing polarization? Each of the three pairs of
opposing sides could have the polarization at a different angle. How
then could you tell different cubies apart? 

   You could have a display stand for it which has a rotating magnetic
field. :)

Regards,

David J

Hi!

Puzzles where the main obstacle is the recognition (or search for 
pieces) like on a picture cube (not normal supercube w markers, but 
real pictures) aren&#x27;t really fun ;-) One other such puzzle is the 
Peter&#x27;s Blackhole puzzle. It&#x27;s so dead easy to solve if u can only 
find that darn cubicle u are looking for :D

But sure others have different taste ... hehe ...

Have fun !!

I&#x27;ve got one of the clear cubes and I hate the little star stickers 
on it.  I might just have to start playing with some polarized 
filters... I have all kinds of optic rigamarole for my Astronomy 
hobby...

Thanks for the neat idea!

Tyson,

   I meant &quot;opposing&quot; as not allowing light through, i.e. at 90
degrees from each other. 

   And some light would be allowed through if the opposite side cubie
was angled only 30 degrees off. Capiche?

Technically, all we have to do to boost the post count is to post
more. It doesn&#x27;t even have to be _about_ something. :)

Gods algorithm? I mentioned it to my classmates here the other day,
and they figured it was a great topic for that ... paper ... we&#x27;re
writing in another 5 years. Don&#x27;t know the english word for it.
Anyways, I got kind of interested. Are anyone working on this? Are
there any news?

> 2) wca regulations (issues touched by François Sechet for instance)

If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;m sick of discussing it&#x27;s this. :(

> 3) which cubes are really best? how to build ur own ultimate 
> speedcube?

A while ago I had a very nice cube. It was a hybrid construction with
the core being from an Ideal cube and the pieces from a studio cube.
It was really a great cube, except that the plastic from the old ideal
cube was getting bad quality. A center piece snapped off a couple of
weeks ago, so I transferred the pieces to the old studio cube core.
It&#x27;s working all right, but I really do prefer arched centers. Popping
= no thanks.

> 4) who is the best allround puzzler?

I am impressed by Jaap. Love his site. :)

> 5) cubing jokes

Why don&#x27;t you just peel off the stickers? HAHA LOL HOW ORIGINAL!!!111~

*Sigh*

> 6) what is the best notation for larger cubes? (inner layers notation)

Someone suggested this a while back... some sort of notation by axes.
Name the axes X (R,L axis), Y (U,D axis) and Z (F,B axis). Then a
notation like X(10010) would mean the first and fourth layers on the X
axis _from R_ to be turned 90 degrees clockwise. Alternatively, X(14)
might save space, but that may make it difficult to denote half-turns,
so instead of 2 let&#x27;s use *. So D2 on a 5x5 would be Y(5*), d2 would
be Y(4*), and (D2 d2) would be Y(4*5*) or perhaps Y((45)*) or Y(45)*.
Then we can do things like Y(12)(3)&#x27;(45)*. Nifty. But I think we
should use this only for cubes with degree larger than 5 because we
already have working notation for degrees 2-5 that saves a lot of
space relative to this way.

> 7) shouldn&#x27;t M, E and S on 3x3x3 cube really be counted as 1 move?

No... First, M, E or S is equivalent to 2 moves of the outer layers,
and second, it&#x27;s fairly obvious that M, E and S are far more difficult
to perform fast than any move of the outer layers. I think M, E and S
should be counted as 2.

Hi Per,

   OK...

1) what is really best method of solving the cube?

   Looking ahead well. Oh, you mean formal method, hmmm,

   The method I use. :)

   Actually I haven&#x27;t seen enough of the other methods to say, since
most speedcubists use only one method. Corners first is fast, too.
Until lots of speedy folks learn other methods it&#x27;s going to be a tossup.

2) wca regulations (issues touched by François Sechet for instance)

   We need rules for solving with the judges wearing blindfolds.

3) which cubes are really best? how to build ur own ultimate speedcube?

   The Deluxe and Rubik&#x27;s Game cubes, Ideal cubes made in 1981 or late
1980 - mostly in Hungary and Hong Kong, the Studio cubes made in
Hungary, the new arched center cubes, in that order.

4) who is the best allround puzzler?

   Probably some of the people on Twistypuzzles.com like Jaap.

5) cubing jokes

&quot;What&#x27;s the secret to solving the cube?&quot;
   a) knowing what you&#x27;re doing.
   b) my daddy knows someone who knows Rubik.
   c) reading the algoritms online.
   d) having brain cells that work.

6) what is the best notation for larger cubes? (inner layers notation)

   I vote for Chris Harwick&#x27;s idea of r1, r2, r3 etc.

7) shouldn&#x27;t M, E and S on 3x3x3 cube really be counted as 1 move?

   Yes, since that&#x27;s how they are thought of; and they should be
changed to lower case letter of the Upper case letters for the sides
they are next to, r, l, f, b, u, d. This way the 3x3x3 and 4x4x4 share
the same notation.

Cheers,

David J

Hi David, Per-



1) what is really best method of solving the cube?

Whatever works for you, the cuber. Everybody who learns the Fridrich 
method, and has time to practice gets good at it. (This came up 
during a conversation about QWERTY vs. DVORAK (?) keyboards) But we 
never tried to come up with our own method, something unique. Like 
Gilles Roux and Lars Petrus have their own method, and they can 
always improve it because they know how it works. Majority of the 
people who use Fridrich use memorize algorithms, and execute them. 

2) wca regulations (issues touched by François Sechet for instance)

A lot of catagories have already been covered... All I can think of 
are rules for new puzzles.

3) which cubes are really best? how to build ur own ultimate 
speedcube?

   &quot;The Deluxe and Rubik&#x27;s Game cubes, Ideal cubes made in 1981 or 
late
1980 - mostly in Hungary and Hong Kong, the Studio cubes made in
Hungary, the new arched center cubes, in that order.&quot; I would like 
to add my arched studio mod right after Ideal cubes. :) I like my 
arched cubes a lot. I don&#x27;t use my modded studio...It&#x27;s precious ;) 
(Okay, 7 hours was spent on fiddling with that cube, and about 3 wks 
later rubiks.com sells pretty much the exact same thing as a DIY 
Kit... So much having an unique cube...)

4) who is the best allround puzzler?

   Whoever can solve a puzzle after picking it up. They don&#x27;t have 
to be the fastest at a puzzle, just be able to solve them all.

5) cubing jokes

&quot;What&#x27;s the secret to solving the cube?&quot;
&quot;You cube too much if...
you use silicone spray as deodorant&quot;

6) what is the best notation for larger cubes? (inner layers 
notation)

   &quot;I vote for Chris Harwick&#x27;s idea of r1, r2, r3, etc&quot; I do too. 
But all the algorithms I&#x27;m familiar with for larger cubes (Well..I 
guess only up till 5x5x5) have slice turns as r l u d f b, and 
have &#x27; (superscript) 2 and w for double turns. 

7) shouldn&#x27;t M, E and S on 3x3x3 cube really be counted as 1 move?

   Yes, but I don&#x27;t think we should be too picky and make them lower 
case... We wouldn&#x27;t exactly get &#x27;confused&#x27; if they weren&#x27;t.

Well.. About number 7:

Yes, in my humble opion, it seems very natural do define slice moves 
like &#x27;M&#x27; as 1 move. When I look at the cube from the outside, the 
cube is not just a puzzle with six faces that can all be turned in 
two directions, but it&#x27;s a large cube that is build up with 27 small 
cubes, and all layers can be twisted in three dimensions. I wouldn&#x27;t 
know why there should be a difference between the first and second 
layer... But off course, that&#x27;s just my opinion ;).

Bye,

I have a question to organize official tournament.<br>
Especialy, about judging. <br>
<br>
I thought we need to have judges who really don&#x27;t compete. <br>
It was the unsloved problem to organize competitions in Japan. <br>
<br>
When I see the pictures of Dutch Open 2004, <br>
I found the competitors may judge the others each other. <br>
Then, I looked at the other pictures of the other competitions, and <br>
found there are a few judges who may compete. <br>
<br>
Is that allowed for official competitions? <br>
<br>
We, Japanese people, got together sometimes. <br>
We just saw and talked each other. <br>
It was fun, but we couldn&#x27;t have set official records because we <br>
didn&#x27;t have judges who don&#x27;t want to compete. <br>
<br>
If we can judge each other, we can organize some official <br>
competitions in Japan. <br>
When the competitors judges the others, how they randomize the cubes? <br>
I guess they just don&#x27;t see the cube or randomize cube under table or <br>
in a box. <br>
If we do so, someone may think the judge can remember the pattern of <br>
randomization. But I don&#x27;t thinks so. I believe it is still fair as <br>
long as they don&#x27;t see it. If someone else could set the initial <br>
position before randomization, it must be more difficult to be <br>
recognized. <br>
I hear in Caltech tournament initial position may be set in the same <br>
color scheme. (May be wrong) But each competitor may make cross in <br>
different color so I don&#x27;t think the initial position is not <br>
important. <br>
<br>
If someone (Ron, Chris, or Tyson who listed on as board of WCA) could <br>
show guidelines or something in case we can&#x27;t prepare the judegs who <br>
don&#x27;t compete, we would really appreciate. <br>
And we would like to follow the guidelines and post our records as <br>
official ones. <br>
<br>
Thanks. <br>

Hi all, <br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve seen the spinning move on Nathan Christie&#x27;s site<br>
http://my.fit.edu/~dchristi/cube/spin.mpg<br>
and I noticed that the cube is &quot;silent&quot;. It sounds like <br>
there is little friction. <br>
<br>
If I listen to Macky&#x27;s videos, the cube is so &quot;loud&quot;, it sounds<br>
like there is lot of friction.  <br>
<br>
How&#x27;s the sound on your cube? <br>

That&#x27;s true, but I must add that at the Dutch Cube Day on nearly all 
events judging and scrambling was done by someone who didn&#x27;t 
participate in that particular event. The 3x3x3 event had 17 
competitors but in all other events the highest number of people that 
entered was 10. So that meant that we had at least 7 people that could 
volunteer to scramble and judge, and which they thankfully did 
(especially Jaap and Peter did a lot of good work to help us out). So 
the only problem really is to start the 3x3x3 first round: you have to 
be able to scramble the cubes and judge the first 4 participants, so 
that they can scramble and judge after they&#x27;ve completed their round, 
which seems fair to me since it doensn&#x27;t matter anymore that they can 
see the scramble. I can&#x27;t remember how we resolved this issue in 
Groningen.

Ron???

hmmm... okej, my mistake. 
Is the Cube solved by Petrus method in that video? On Nathan´s page it
seems that he use F2L. 
The video was named Petrus_somthing when I found it.

Hey everybody,<br>
<br>
Ok, this is not a very important post, but because of Per&#x27;s campain <br>
to boost up the number of messages, I thought it would be nice to <br>
post it anyway... Around 1:00 AM this night, I was thinking about <br>
commutators... Suddenly, I turned on the light, grabbed my cube, and <br>
I had found an algorithm to cycle three egdes, or do the E <br>
permutation ((URF URB) (ULF ULB)). I don&#x27;t know if this is a well <br>
know algorithm, so maybe I am just telling old news :). It&#x27;s not an <br>
efficient algorithm  too, but it&#x27;s easy to memorize and execute, and <br>
I think I might use it in blindfold cubing for doing the E <br>
permutation. Maybe it&#x27;s also usefull for a beginner, since it&#x27;s not <br>
that hard to memorize, and it allows you to solve 2 different <br>
permutations. Here is the alg (this one permute&#x27;s pieces in the D <br>
layer!) :<br>
<br>
RUR&#x27; L&#x27;U&#x27;L RUR&#x27; - D - RUR&#x27; L&#x27;U&#x27;L RUR&#x27; - [D&#x27;].<br>
<br>
Replace the D&#x27;s by D2 to get the E permutation.<br>

There&#x27;s an obvious commutator that does the same thing: (RUR&#x27; L&#x27;U&#x27;L
RUR&#x27;) D (RUR&#x27; L&#x27;U&#x27;L RUR&#x27;)&#x27; D&#x27;.
But the interesting thing is that (RUR&#x27; L&#x27;U&#x27;L RUR&#x27;) and (RUR&#x27; L&#x27;U&#x27;L
RUR&#x27;)&#x27; give identical results, because (RUR&#x27; L&#x27;U&#x27;L RUR&#x27;)^2=I.
Of course, you can do things like (RUR&#x27;L&#x27;U&#x27;LRUR&#x27;) D (L&#x27;U&#x27;LRUR&#x27;L&#x27;U&#x27;L)
D&#x27; too.

Thanks for sharing,

Gilles.

Yeah, that was the algorithm I found initially, but then I got 
interested in how many times I had to repeat the algoritm to get a 
solved cube... Or I, if you like to denote it in a more mathematical 
way. ;)

1) what is really best method of solving the cube?
Totally biased - L2L4 followed by L2L2.  From a position of ignorance as I
don&#x27;t know the corners first methods.

2) wca regulations (issues touched by Franï¿½ois Sechet for instance)
Still unhappy about the no painted cubes rule.
Also still think fewer regulations/more general principles is best.

3) which cubes are really best? how to build ur own ultimate speedcube?
The old ideal ones are the best I&#x27;ved tried.  But I haven&#x27;t tried most cubes
so I don&#x27;t know.

4) who is the best allround puzzler?
Pass.  Or maybe nominate Chris Hardwick.

7) shouldn&#x27;t M, E and S on 3x3x3 cube really be counted as 1 move?
No - but mostly because I can&#x27;t do them quickly enough.  I guess it only
really matters for FMC - don&#x27;t we have competitions where theya re counted
both ways - if not we should!

I&#x27;ll give 5 a try some time.

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Campaign to boost # of messages ;-)




Hi guys (and guyesses) :-)

I would just like to mention that it seems like this month will give
us the lowest number of posted messages since november 2002. Things
are not looking great ;-) We can still boost the number by some
intense discussions :D

Suggested topics :

1) what is really best method of solving the cube?

2) wca regulations (issues touched by Franï¿½ois Sechet for instance)

3) which cubes are really best? how to build ur own ultimate
speedcube?

4) who is the best allround puzzler?

5) cubing jokes

6) what is the best notation for larger cubes? (inner layers notation)

7) shouldn&#x27;t M, E and S on 3x3x3 cube really be counted as 1 move?

I&#x27;m sure u guys can think of more topics to boost the number of posts.

Happy posting!! ;-)

Hi!

Another boost post :-P

My first post was partially meant as a joke and partially serious. I 
wish we had more serious/interesting posts. Even repeating old stuff 
is ok. Maybe new details will come up :-)

Joel, since when did edges have 3 faces? ... hehe ;-) OK, so u mean 
corner 3-cycle. There&#x27;s another easier way to swap 2 corners like u 
do. I will show how u can do that on top (not bottom) :

LU&#x27;RD2R&#x27;UL&#x27;

The full 3 cycle is done like this : ( &lt;A,B> = ABA&#x27;B&#x27; )

&lt;LU&#x27;RD2R&#x27;UL&#x27;,U>

And by the way ur alg is NOT a commutator. U simply utilise that 
every cycle created by the 9 first moves are of order 2. After 
adjusting D u just repeat the first 9 moves again. U still follow 
what i call the &quot;isolation principle&quot; but not as a commutator. Ur 
alg can be written like this : ABAB&#x27; And of coz u could have done 
ABA&#x27;B&#x27; with those first 9 moves. It works exactly similar :D

Cheers!!

Im relatively new to cubing (3 months now)...  What&#x27;s a commutator?
 OH, by the way, I was eating lunch at a local restaraunt by myself, 
solving the cube, and started talking with the person next to me 
about cubing (I had my laptop out, and I was timing...)  and I got a 
new best time of 47.42 seconds... even with one mistake in the 
F2L... but im pretty sure it was a lucky time, (though I still had 
to do 2 look in the last layer, the PLL worked out right, cuz I new 
the alg to skip OLL ... rather do OLL and PLL at the same time).  
All my other times were like 56... so pretty slow, but getting 
better, and Im learning new algs of Jessica&#x27;s all the time.)


haha, sorry, tangient.... back to commutators?  What are they?

Uhm, on other forums we call that post whoring... why are you 
posting just to boost the numbers?  Jeez, for the love of all that

Hi Per,

I never claimed the alg I posted was a commutator, but the version 
of the alg I found initially was a commutator, right? The reason why 
I posted the other alg, is that I think it triggers a little better 
than the commutator version.

And thanks for the other alg! I like that one too :).

Bye,

Joel.

Well, I dont really know a formal definition of a commutator, but I 
have a pretty good idea about what it means... Suppose you want to 
find an algorithm that effects only a few pieces of the U layer. For 
example: twist one corner clockwise, and another piece 
counterclockwise. Then, find an algorithm to rotate the first corner 
clockwise, that doesn&#x27;t affect the other pieces in the U layer (but 
destoys F2l. I does not matter how much of the F2L is being messed 
up here!). Call that algorithm [A]. Now, rotate the U face. Now do 
[A]&#x27;. This will rotate another corner of the U layer 
counterclockwise, and restore the F2L again. For example, take [A] = 
R&#x27;D&#x27;RDR&#x27;D&#x27;R. Now, try [A]U [A]&#x27;U&#x27;. The same thing can be done to 
orient edges and permute pieces. (For permutations, find an alg [B] 
that swaps two pieces in the U layer without touching the rest of 
that layer, then do a U move, then do [B]&#x27;)

(At the risk of offending &quot;richy_jr_2000&quot;, who would prefer that I
don&#x27;t mention mathematics, I will attempt to tell you - and also
indicate why it might be useful in puzzling.)

A commutator is an element of a group that is of the form:

[A,B]=A&#x27;B&#x27;AB where A&#x27; is the inverse of A and B&#x27; the inverse of B. It
measures the extent to which A and B fail to commute (they commute if
the commutator is the identity - in that case AB=BA).
It&#x27;s like taking off your shoes and then taking off your socks and
then putting on your shoes and then pulling your socks over them.
Taking off your socks and shoes don&#x27;t commute and they have a
non-trivial commutator - you get a double tranposition (each sock
switches position with the corresponding shoe). On the other hand
taking off your gloves and taking off your shoes do commute. If you
take off your gloves and then your shoes (forget that you just pulled
your socks over them) and then put your gloves back on and then your
shoes back on, you should be where you started.

The commutator subgroup is the subgroup that the commutators generate
- in the cube group this is exactly half the group - but generally it
is not the case that the commutator subgroup contains only commutators.

In general, the conjugate permutations A&#x27;B&#x27;A and B&#x27;AB are closely
related to B&#x27; and A respectively. (For instance, if (a_1...a_k) is a
cycle in the disjoint cycle structure of A then (b(a_1)...b(a_k)) is a
disjoint cycle in the cycle structure of B&#x27;AB.) In particular, you can
design your commutator to cancel things out. If b fixes a_1 and a_2
then A&#x27;B&#x27;AB is going to fix a_1 for example (A will take it to a_2 and
then B&#x27;AB will take a_2=b(a_2) to b(a_1)=a_1).

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody,<br>
<br>
Since the new version of Yahoo was released, we have had no option but to use the yahoo java chat room, which is full of bugs and has put off me for one, and many others I am sure from joining the speedcubing chat on weekends.<br>
<br>
I have tried to resolve the problem, by setting up a chat feature on my website, although it is still java, it seems to be much more stable and faster, but we can only know by trying it out!<br>
<br>
I am beginning a chat at 8.30PM UK time today, <br>
and also at 7PM UK time tomorrow, everyone is welcome, just head to my website:<br>
<br>
www.cubestation.co.uk<br>
<br>
and click on the chat link :) It is a good idea to use your name or yahoo nickname as your handle, so we can identify people as they appear<br>
<br>
Hope to see you there!<br>
<br>
Dan :)<br>

Sounds like a good idea.  In case anyone is interested, the free, open <br>
source GAIM (http://gaim.sf.net) supports the most common IM protocols, <br>
including Yahoo IM.  It works great for me whenever I want to swing by <br>

Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
Tyson already mentioned it, and Macky is already spreading the word <br>
about it, but there will be a negative time solving contest this <br>
year during Daylight saving time.<br>
<br>
It is the only time where you can time yourself on the cube, and <br>
finish before you started.  You will be given only one chance and <br>
only one scramble.  The scramble is on Macky&#x27;s webpage, but check <br>
out the setup of the contest on the main page of <br>
http://www.speedcubing.com<br>
<br>
We hope to see a lot of participation!<br>

This was my original negative time solve done last year.  Sorry I <br>
sucked... the time was 59 real seconds so negative 59 minutes and one <br>
second.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I was bad.  But it means I can hopefully beat last year&#x27;s record!<br>

At the upcoming Swedish Cube Day we will have a multitude of events 
and most probably very few competitors in several of them. We will 
try to manage the judge situation like they did at the Dutch Open.

As Francois mentioned, shortage of time is an issue. During the 
Swedish Cube Day we will solve this by having fun instead of having 
a strict and formal competition. Since it will be the first 
competition we arrange, we will do it in a most relaxed manner. 
However, we will try to comply with the WCA regulations as much as 
possible. We will communicate our experiences to you after the event.

The chat this weekend was a great success, many people took part and the java chat environment on the whole was very stable.<br>
<br>
So I hope this can &quot;re-become&quot; a regular feature of our weekends, it&#x27;s especially useful if you are a beginner or an intermediate looking for absolutely anything to help you progress in the world of speedsolving or FMC, there is usually an expert or two within the chat who is more than happy to pass on some knowledge!<br>
<br>
I will host another chat next weekend at around 7PM UK time (saturday), but you can pop by anytime, there may well be someone about, and I will drop in from time to time during the week as well.<br>
<br>
I hope you all enjoy ithe facility, and have a good week!<br>

Hey guys... and girls,<br>
<br>
For school, I have to do a presentation about a subject of my <br>
choice. And because the Cube is one of the things I like, and the <br>
public = Math students, I thought it would be a nice idea to tell <br>
them something about the cube... For example, how you can calculate <br>
how many positions you can make. Now, I know how to prove that it&#x27;s <br>
impossible to make an odd permutation, but what&#x27;s the easiest way to <br>
prove that all even permutations are possible? (I know how to prove <br>
this, but my proof is a bit complicated to explain to a non-cuber <br>
(and it&#x27;s not really beautiful), so does anyone know a (short) way <br>
to prove it so a non-cuber can understand it quickly?)<br>
<br>
Also, to avoid being very boring, I am looking for some nice facts <br>
about the cube... For example: I once heard some tax-laws of Hungary <br>
were changed, because of Mr. Rubik. Or: When you make a line of 43 * <br>
10^18 cubes (with all different cubestates) you get a line with a <br>
length of xxx(?) light-years. Does anyone know more interesting <br>
facts like this?<br>
<br>
Thanks for helping me :),<br>

Hi Joel

I don&#x27;t know a really nice way to do it, so will be interested to see 
what others come up with.  Three-cycles are one possibility... but to 
avoid having to treat edges-odd/corners-odd (slightly) separately 
from edges-even/corners-even you might want to use the T-pattern 
(permutation (UBL,UFL)(UR,UL)), as in Stefan&#x27;s blindfold solving 
method.  Maybe this is what you have in mind anyway.

Presumably, when discussing even and odd perms, you would already 
have mentioned that a permutation can be decomposed into a product of 
transpositions.  You&#x27;d then argue (with elegantly waving hands) that 
any any one of these transpositions could be achieved by: (1) 
manoeuvring the required pair of edges (resp. corners) into locations 
UR,UL (resp. UBL,UFL) without disturbing the corners UBL,UFL (resp.

This is also probably not the most elegant proof, but I always argue 
based on the possible moves of the cube.

You can argue that all moves are isomorphic to R,R&#x27;,R2 by using cube 
rotations.  Then you can show that R and R&#x27; are odd permutations by 
showing that they 4-cycle the corners and edges in their orbits, 
then break down a 4-cycle into 3 transpositions to show that it is 
odd.  Then show that R2 is an even permutation by performing 2 
transpositions in each of the corner and edge orbits.

Then you can list a single alg, like the T perm or something, and 
show how you can do a transposition in each of the edge or corner 
orbit, but that this ALWAYS does a transposition in the other orbit 
as well.  (the moves R and R&#x27; show this by performing an odd 
permutation on both orbits, so this always has to be the case).

Since you can perform a transposition in each orbit then all odd and 
even permutations are possible, but the key is that both orbits have 
to have the same parity.

You also have to show about the orientations of the pieces, but 
after doing that you could argue in even and odd permutation cases, 
since each is exactly half the number of combinations to the cube, 
then add them together to get the total.

I always do the orientations by defining a hierarchy of faces, 
exactly like in blindfolded cubing, and likewise examine your 
possible moves R,R&#x27;,R2 and you&#x27;ll see that you always flip the 
orientations of the pieces in the possible ways, ruling out a single 
corner or edge rotated and things like that.

I don&#x27;t know a shorter way to prove the orientations of the pieces, 
but I remember seeing something very short in my modern algebra 
class.  Sadly I can&#x27;t recall it very well though :(

Not sure if that was elegant or short, but that is how I prove the 
number of combinations.

<br>
This is one of those facts which seems much deeper than it really is. <br>
I prefer to think of it like this:<br>
If yuo could swap any two edge piece you like (e.g. remove them, swap <br>
and reinsert them), then it is obvious that you can put them all in <br>
the correct place. With each swap you can bring (at least) one piece <br>
to the position it should be.<br>
<br>
You can go further than this. If all you could do is swap UL with any <br>
of the other 11 edges, then it is still possible. To solve any non-UL <br>
piece, swap it with UL, and then bring it from UL to the position you <br>
want it with another swap. So with 2 swaps you can solve any non-UL <br>
piece, without disturbing any other solved non-UL pieces. Eventually <br>
all you might be left with is a swap to solve UL and the last piece.<br>
<br>
All you need to show now is that you can swap any of the 11 non-UL <br>
edges with UL using the T permutation. <br>
<br>
&gt; You&#x27;d then argue (with elegantly waving hands) that <br>
&gt; any any one of these transpositions could be achieved by: (1) <br>
&gt; manoeuvring the required pair of edges (resp. corners) into<br>
&gt; locations <br>
&gt; UR,UL (resp. UBL,UFL) without disturbing the corners UBL,UFL (resp. <br>
&gt; edges UR,UL); (2) performing the T move; and (3) manoeuvring the <br>
&gt; pieces back again.  This would bring in the idea of conjugates, <br>
&gt; too.<br>
<br>
The way I did it you only need to bring one edge to UR without <br>
disturbing the ULF,UL,ULB bar. This is very easy (if you allow slice <br>
moves). Regard ULF,UL,ULB as being bandaged, like a siamese cube.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately this only shows how to solve edges. To prove it <br>
rigorously you would have to do the same kind of thing with the <br>
corners.<br>

Sure, but to show that _all_ even permutations are possible, you have <br>
to be able to do _any_ transposition, not just a particular <br>
transposition.<br>
If it were impossible to bring certain edge pairs into the right <br>
position for the T perm to swap them.<br>
<br>
For example, in the 2 generator group it is quite possible to do an <br>

R is also a 4-cycle of corners. But it is not possible to do any <br>

What level are you pitching it at? (Depending on this, you may have 
to define a lot of information in advance, which could rush the main 
presentation - and could be tedious.) I will try to give some scant 
details, at the risk of incurring the wrath of some.

First of all, what level of information on permutations are you 
assuming. Any permutation can be broken up as a product of disjoint 
cycles. (That is the cycles will have no common elements.) It can 
also be broken up as a product of transpositions (2-cycles). The 
transpositions will not in general be disjoint. This decomposition 
into cycles will not be unique but the number of multiplicands 
(here, transpositions) will be invariant modulo 2 for a given 
permutation. (If your audience don&#x27;t know this, you&#x27;re probably 
going to have to get them to take this as given - otherwise you 
likely won&#x27;t have time to finish. It could take some time to prove.) 
In particular, a cycle is odd iff it moves an even number of 
elements. For example (a b c ... w x y)=(a b c ... w x)(a y) and you 
can use induction.
Now, since a move is a product of quarter turns and a quarter turn 
is a product of two 4-cycles (one of corners and one of edges) 
forgetting orientation for the present, then the permutation of the 
whole will be even. The product of 2 4-cycles is clearly even (the 
total number of transpositions is the sum of two odd numbers and so 
even). So you can&#x27;t get an odd permutation. But it is possible for 
the restrictions to either edge or corner permutations to be odd 
individually.
Fortunately, if this is the case, then simply doing any quarter turn 
will clearly fix this. Now all you need to do (in the first 
instance) is prove that any even permutation of corners and any even 
permutation of edges is possible.
Even permutations are generated by 3-cycles:
(a b)(a c)=(a b c), (a b)(c d)=(a b c)(c a d)
So all you need to be able to show is that you can do this sort of 
thing. You can use the fact that the group clearly acts 3-
transitively on the corners and on the edges (in fact you can do 
rather more) to show that everything can be placed using conjugation 
provided you can display an edge 3-cycle and a corner 3-cycle.
Exhibiting these last facts should be easy, so the only thing you 
need to worry about is the 3-transitivity (all this means here is, 
for instance, that for any 3 edges a, b, c and any 3 edge positions 
x, y, z you can find a move that takes a to x, b to y and c to z).
(Alternatively, you can use a few 3-cycles and then show 
conjugations that will allow you to generally place everything.)

You then need to show that the total edge flip is invariant modulo 2 
and the total corner twist is invariant modulo 3. (Then you can 
exhibit a double edge flip (which doesn&#x27;t permute the pieces) and a 
double corner twist (which doesn&#x27;t permute the pieces) and use 2-
transitivity, a consequence of 3-transitivity) to show you can 
orient the pieces - using conjugation.) To show invariance, you only 
need show invariance under a set of generators - typically the 6 
usual generators. The tedious part will be defining the orientation 
(particularly for edges) which you can do lexicographically by 
ordering the faces. You should probably leave the checking of 
invariance (once defined) as an exercise. Show it for a couple of 
faces, probably at least one of these should exhibit that the 
orientations can be changed.

After that, it&#x27;s easy to calculate the total number of positions 
which must be (8!*12!)/2 * 2^11 * 3^7.

Hi Richard,

thanks a lot, that a very nice explanation and example... finally I 
got to know a little bit about the word itself that I&#x27;ve been using a

I once came up with a &quot;visualization&quot; I like better (because I can&#x27;t 
really imagine a light-year, it&#x27;s so abstract).

Imagine all of human kind has done nothing but cubing since it was 
invented. So let&#x27;s say 6 billion people and 30 years. And let&#x27;s say 
we&#x27;ve all been cubing 24h each and every day, making one move per 
second. Finally, let&#x27;s assume that this world wide project is so 
well-organized that we don&#x27;t waste our time by producing duplicate 
states, i.e. everybody creates a new state with every move. I won&#x27;t do 
the math again (you can ;-) but I think it turned out that only 13% or 
all states have ever be reached somewhere somewhere by someone. Of 
course some assumptions might slightly differ from reality and the 
fraction of explored states might thus be smaller.

I was actually quite surprised by this when I computed it. A friend of 
mine had asked me &quot;don&#x27;t you get the same states again and again?&quot; and 
that&#x27;s why I did it. It convinced me that when I randomly scramble, 
most of the states I get to while scrambling have *never appeared 
anywhere*. Still awesome.

How about doing it this way:

There are many ways to decompose a permutation, but there&#x27;s an 
equivalence deterministic value. The number of &quot;wrong pairs&quot; in the 
sequence.

Number the corners 1-8. Let&#x27;s look at this state:

position:    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
cubie there: 6 8 1 7 4 3 5 2

There are many ways to &quot;solve&quot; (i.e. sort) this with swaps. But let&#x27;s 
compute the number of pairs in wrong order. First number is six and 
1-5 are all behind it, but they should come before it. So that&#x27;s five 
wrong pairs. The 8 has 6 smaller numbers on it&#x27;s right. So, 11 wrong 
pairs so far. The 1 has no smaller numbers on the right. Let me 
summarize it for all:

6 8 1 7 4 3 5 2 (the cubie numbers)
5 6 0 4 2 1 1 0 (smaller numbers on the right)

Sum: 19

The point is, that you have no choice (like you have a choice which 
swaps to do for solving). What&#x27;s this number good for? Well, it&#x27;s even 
if and only if the sequence can be ordered by an even number of swaps. 
This is quite easy to prove and I leave it to you ;-) Here&#x27;s the idea: 
The sorted sequence has an even number of wrong pairs (namely zero) 
and it&#x27;s solvable with an even number of swaps (namely zero). And 
whenever you do a swap, the number of swaps done overall changes its 
&quot;evenness&quot; and at the same time the number of wrong pairs changes its 
&quot;evenness&quot;, too.

Cheers!
Stefan

Hi,<br>
<br>
the only answer to the question in the subject of this message that<br>
makes sense to me is:<br>
 disqualifying competitors using corners-first method<br>
 (or its variation), because most people use Fridrich/Petrus<br>
 based solution anyway...<br>
<br>
Sure, the slice turns can be slower to perform for most people,<br>
but it is really unimportant for FMC as well as not using<br>
non-optimal UR group sequences that may be better for speedcubing.<br>
<br>
Do slice moves really mean any advantage? Do they move more<br>
pieces in more suitable way, or less pieces to perform permutations<br>
better?<br>
<br>
I have to say that in my opinion the answer is &#x27;no&#x27;.<br>
If we analyze face turn:<br>
 the number of pieces moved (wrt. the rest of cube) 4 ed. + 4 corn.<br>
 the number of facelets moved (depends) max. 4x2+4x3<br>
For the slice turn:<br>
 the number of pieces moved (wrt. the rest of cube,<br>
 although not compact) 4 edges + 4 centers<br>
 the number of facelets moved max. 4 + 4x2<br>
<br>
The only difference is that for slice turns center pieces are<br>
moved instead of corner ones.<br>
<br>
The official rule set up to count slices as 2 turns only puts<br>
some cubers to a position that they cannot compete...<br>
Even though I would use only about 5-7 slice turns in an FMC try<br>
it is such a big handicap that it is not worth participating...<br>
<br>
What do other think? In replies to the &quot;Boost message mail&quot;<br>
it looked that more people are positive to count slices as one turn.<br>

I just wanted to tell all of you that I just managed my first sub-20<br>
average of 10. The times were:<br>
<br>
(15.74) 20.84 18.17 19.55 20.70 17.78 20.09 19.40 17.17 18.71 20.88<br>

couldn&#x27;t seem to get under 22 no matter what I did. Today I made<br>
myself a cube log and I did another average of 10 just to have<br>
something to write about, and boom! Yay. :)<br>
<br>
Also note the PB non-lucky time of 15.74. Heheh.<br>

You know, I never gave it much thought until now, but in a split 
second of realization I became a staunch advocate of counting slice 
moves as a single move.  Upon superficial inspection, I though &quot;Yeah, 
that&#x27;s 2 moves...&quot; but now I don&#x27;t think so.  Here&#x27;s my reasoning:

Think of a 4x4x4 cube:
F is one move, everyone would agree.
f (as long as you don&#x27;t turn F with it) is one move... a little more 
subjective, but I think it would be hard to refute this.  I give you 
the following sub-logic:
  If f is not 1 move, it must be a combination of moves of parallel 
faces.
  The parallel faces on a 4x4x4 are B,b,F.
  However, b must be a combination of moves of parallel faces: B,f,F
  Therefore any move f or b when considered to be a combination of 
moves of parallel faces would have to be infinitely many moves.
  ex:  f = F&#x27; B&#x27; b&#x27; = F&#x27; B&#x27; (F B f) = F&#x27; B&#x27; (F B (F&#x27; B&#x27; b))=...
  Reductio ad absurdum.

Now think of a 3x3x3:
F is one move
f is one move (same logic as before).  Only in this case, f happens 
to be the center slice.

Now I know it may not be the best argument in the world, but this is 
the way I&#x27;m looking at it right now.  I would welcome any 
contradictions!

Yes, but there&#x27;s the issue of showing that it&#x27;s not possible (in some
other, possibly non-canonical, way) to solve using a different number
(modulo 2) of transpositions - that&#x27;s crucial if you want to show that
a permutation can&#x27;t be both odd and even - which is key to being able
to compute the size of the group, for instance. It&#x27;s equivalent to
showing that the identity can&#x27;t be expressed as a product of an odd
number of transpositions (if sigma is both odd and even then you can
write sigma*sigma&#x27; as a product of an odd number of transpositions).
The identity has no pairs in the wrong order (in terms of your post)
but it&#x27;s not completely trivial to show that it can&#x27;t be written as a
product of an odd number of transpositions in some way. I guess the
usual way to do it would probably to be to write the identity matrix
(of the appropriate size) as a product of an odd number of permutation
matrices (corresponding to transpositions). Since each transposition
matrix has determinant -1 (you just need to swap 2 rows to make it the
identity matrix, which has determinant 1) then the identity matrix
would have determinant (-1)^k for some odd k, i.e. -1, a contradiction
and so the result would follow by reductio ad absurdum. Of course,
you&#x27;d need to prove (or assume) facts on determinants - 1) the
determinant is homomorphism from the multiplicative ring of matrices
into the underlying ring (this may require certain facts about the
underlying ring, but they&#x27;d be satisfied here) and 2) interchanging 2
rows (or columns) in a matrix changes the determinant by a factor of
-1. (You&#x27;d probably just need rows or columns, depending on which way
you write your permutations, but if you can prove that the determinant
is invariant under transposing the matrix then you get two for the
price of one anyway.)

Hi Joel!!

U could also go about and explain some other interesting facts about 
the cube. Like it&#x27;s impossible to just swap 2 edges or likewise just 
swap 2 corners. Or u can also look at flip and twist parity.

U can gain some knowledge by looking at the following page :

http://members.tripod.com/~dogschool/rubikscube.html

The explanations (&quot;proofs&quot;) are very easy to follow :-)

God&#x27;s algorithm is also a cool topic. See Jaap&#x27;s pages :-)

Best of luck w ur presentation ;-)

I presume, he mentioned that near the start where he mentioned it was
impossible to do an odd permutation. (At least one assumes that is
what he meant - of course that would be an odd permutation in S_20,
but then not all even permutations are possible because you can&#x27;t move
edges into corner places and vice versa.)

Moreover, all those 2s are guaranteed just from the factorial parts
(it wouldn&#x27;t matter about the extra 2^10) because 2^k*r&lt;5^k*r so any
time you pick up a 5 in the factorial you&#x27;ve already picked up a
corresponding 2 (and in fact you&#x27;ll have many extra 2s in general - by
the time you pick up the first 5 at 5! you&#x27;ve already picked up 3 2s
(so you can use one of them to cancel the 2 in the denominator of
(12!*8!)/2 and still have all your zeros leftover (i.e. the extra 2s
in 2^11*3^7 aren&#x27;t going to help towards the zeros at the end).

Wow! You just changed my mind. Well, actually you *split* my mind ;-)

So far I&#x27;ve always voted for counting it as 2 turns. That&#x27;s because 
when I solve the cube it &quot;feels&quot; slower than a face turn and so I 
wanted to &quot;punish&quot; it. Now I realize that we should take the *purpose* 
into account. And I vote:

- 2 turns. For speedsolving purposes, for example to automatically 
choose among different algs (e.g. computed by ACube). Here I&#x27;m 
interested in fast execution and slice turns do feel slower generally.

- 1 turn. For fewest moves solving purposes. Here execution speed 
doesn&#x27;t matter and so for this purpose I agree counting it as 1 feels 
more natural.

Thanks for making me (us?) aware of the difference.

Cheers!
Stefan

&gt; Yes, but there&#x27;s the issue of showing that it&#x27;s not possible (in <br>
some<br>
&gt; other, possibly non-canonical, way) to solve using a different <br>
number<br>
&gt; (modulo 2) of transpositions - that&#x27;s crucial if you want to show <br>
that<br>
&gt; a permutation can&#x27;t be both odd and even - which is key to being <br>
able<br>
&gt; to compute the size of the group, for instance. It&#x27;s equivalent to<br>
&gt; showing that the identity can&#x27;t be expressed as a product of an odd<br>
&gt; number of transpositions (if sigma is both odd and even then you can<br>
&gt; write sigma*sigma&#x27; as a product of an odd number of transpositions).<br>
&gt; The identity has no pairs in the wrong order (in terms of your post)<br>
&gt; but it&#x27;s not completely trivial to show that it can&#x27;t be written as <br>
a<br>
&gt; product of an odd number of transpositions in some way.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s easy, isn&#x27;t it? Assume that a certain permutation can be solved <br>
one way with 12 swaps and another way with 7 swaps. Let&#x27;s assume our <br>
permutation has 5 wrong pairs. Since each swap changes the <br>
&quot;even/oddness&quot; of this number, the 12 swaps can obviously not really <br>
solve it. Only an odd number of swaps can solve an odd permutation <br>
since every swap changes the oddness of permutations and the identity <br>
is not odd.<br>
<br>
My point mainly was that you can &quot;read&quot; the even/oddness of a <br>
permutation *without* writing it as some cycles. Writing it as cycles <br>
is bad because there are different ways to do so. Writing it in &quot;raw&quot; <br>
form there&#x27;s just one way to do so. So unless there&#x27;s a good reason to <br>
do so (e.g. blindfold solving) I&#x27;d suggest not to use cycle notation, <br>
but instead &quot;raw&quot; order.<br>
<br>
I do understand your way of using permutation matrices and <br>
determinants, but that&#x27;s just not really solving the problem, is it? <br>
Writing a permutation as a product of permutation matrices also has <br>
the problem that there are infinitely many different ways to do so. <br>
And it wastes a lot more of paper/pencil, too ;-)<br>

Ok, I read your exact reasoning again. I think we&#x27;re actually saying 
pretty much the same thing, the difference is just that you&#x27;re talking 
about &quot;determinants&quot; of &quot;matrices&quot; and I&#x27;m talking about &quot;wrong pairs&quot; 
of &quot;raw order&quot;. Well, I&#x27;d need to define mine more precisely, yours 
are two simple words that are well-known already, so... you win ;-) 
But I still say our proofs are equivalent...

Hi Per, Joel, et al,

   I find it interesting that even though you can can&#x27;t move only one
pair of corners or edges and nothing else, you also cannot only move
the four centers of a slice to their adjacent sides of that slice. In
other words you can swap two edges without swapping two corners (and
vice versa) if you don&#x27;t require that all the centers stay in place.

   In yet other words, if you physically remove two corners of a cube
and switch them it is the same as physically switching two edges. Now,
if you do that and move the center slice one quarter turn and, leave
the centers there as you solve the rest of the cube, you can solve
ther rest of the cube including swapping those two corners back. 

Regards,

David J

          <div class="email-content">Yes, my mind is split too... and it always has been :(

I have been an advocate of slice turns = 2 moves, as you well know. The main reason for this is as you described below, it feels slower and more cumbersome than a standard face turn, and for speedsolving purposes it is definitely worse off (at least for my speedsolving... Gilles?)

When the FMC was born, I was not an FM solver, but of course I see different now. But after 60 or more competitions spanning 1 and a half years, I am reluctant to change things now. And anyway, slice turns have their own rank (just not the main one :) ).

Maybe the most important people (the FMC experts) will change my mind, especially after reading Josef&#x27;s post, but I seem to remember we had a big discussion on the FMC forum a while back, before EC2004, and it was still inconclusive.

  wanted to &quot;punish&quot; it. Now I realize that we should take the *purpose* 
  into account. And I vote:

  - 2 turns. For speedsolving purposes, for example to automatically 
  choose among different algs (e.g. computed by ACube). Here I&#x27;m 
  interested in fast execution and slice turns do feel slower generally.

  - 1 turn. For fewest moves solving purposes. Here execution speed 
  doesn&#x27;t matter and so for this purpose I agree counting it as 1 feels 
  more natural.

  Thanks for making me (us?) aware of the difference.

  Cheers!
  Stefan

The main reason for this is as you described below, it feels slower
and more cumbersome than a standard face turn, and for speedsolving
purposes it is definitely worse off (at least for my speedsolving...
Gilles?)

As I was saying to someone else recently, the one and only metric
regarding speedcubing is the timer.
Of course, sequences like E2S2M2E2S2M2 are VERY slow. But M/M&#x27; often
are much faster than a half turn of any face (M&#x27;UM&#x27;UM&#x27;U faster than
10moves/sec if you count M&#x27; as two moves).

You know that there are many criteria that make moves faster than
others, that&#x27;s why people spend their time trying to optimize
sequences for their hands. For example, the minimization of cube
reorientations is very important, even if they don&#x27;t appear in many
written &quot;algorithms&quot; (it&#x27;s normal, because different people may
execute the same sequence differently).

I could go on for ages talking about what a &quot;speed metric&quot; should
include. My idea is that people shouldn&#x27;t think about all of these
points when considering a metric for a FMC.

Forget speed. Forget some computer programs too, for them it&#x27;s more
efficient to work with fixed centers and half turns.

Take a 1x1x1 cake. Divide it into three equal parts, three times
(following the three orthogonal planes). The inner slices are as good
as the others. I remember when I first saw the cube, it was not a
bunch of corners and edges, it was just a perfect 3x3x3 matrix and you
could move any row or column magically.

Sure you can solve the cube without moving M, S or E, but you can
solve it with DLB fixed, without moving D, L or F too. 

I see slice moves as normal moves (as I do with bigger cubes), and
I&#x27;ve yet to read a valid point that could make me change my mind about
it (yes, I&#x27;m an open-minded guy ;-) ).

I understand why people have problem considering the cube my way. It&#x27;s
a matter of how they look at it. If they solve the cube 100 times a
day thinking with sides only, thinking with slices seems weird. And
there&#x27;s the dexterity thing of course. But it&#x27;s a bit sad because, for
example, you can&#x27;t see how simple many commutators based on slices can
be, and they&#x27;re not only useful in corners-first methods. It&#x27;s like
speaking using a reduced vocabulary.

Slice moves may appear as complex moves because of the mechanics
inside the cube (6 axes - but a 3x3x3 could have been built around a
sphere). I consider them as physically and mathematically simple (it&#x27;s
not like considering a RU&#x27;R&#x27;U fingertrick as a basic move, even if
complex sequences can improve your &quot;vocabulary&quot;).


There&#x27;s another subject: Half-turn or quarter-turn metric?

I think there are three reasons for people to use an half-turn metric:
- Formulae are shorter and simpler to write.
- It&#x27;s actually easy to think with half-turns.
- You just have to turn your hand a bit more.

My opinion is that R2 is clearly made of two R (or R&#x27;) basic moves.
You can think with half-turns just as you can think with RU&#x27;R&#x27;U
sequences, but they&#x27;re not physically simple.


This is just a personal point of view of course, I don&#x27;t write
official rules.
HTM is the worst metric you can imagine for a FMC (remember SQTM?),
but I&#x27;ll still try to attend CubeStation&#x27;s competitions :-)


Gilles.


PS#1: By the way, there&#x27;s no limit on the number of competitors for
CubeStation&#x27;s challenges. Come with us!

PS#2: 3x3x3 scrambles could include slices too ;-)

PS#3: Notation is not really important to me, as long as we can
understand each others, but I agree that M/E/S is a bit confusing, and
I don&#x27;t see why slices would require such specific names.

PS#4: Mister Kociemba, could you please write a....

Actually, my main point is that you need to show that 
oddness/evenness can&#x27;t both occur at once. To be odd just means that 
the permutation can be expressed as a product of an odd number of 
transpositions - to be even is similarly defined. There is a 
question of whether it is possible to be simultaneously odd and even 
that needs to be addressed. You&#x27;ve defined oddness/evenness 
differently, in terms of wrong pairs and described a canonical way 
of defining it, so providing a well-defined notion of odd vs even. 
What it doesn&#x27;t prove is that it is impossible to write an odd/even 
permutation (as defined like this) as a product of an even/odd 
number of transpositions. (In other words, if you didn&#x27;t do it 
canonically and just switched pairs and eventually came to the 
identity in some non-methodical way, how would you know that you 
always take an odd (or always take an even) number of 
transpositions.)
You do make some reference to this: &#x27;And whenever you do a swap, the 
number of swaps done overall changes its &quot;evenness&quot; and at the same 
time the number of wrong pairs changes its &quot;evenness&quot;, too.&#x27; but it 
is a technical issue that does require a bit of proof (and is 
equivalent to the fact that the identity permutation can&#x27;t be 
written as the product of an odd number of permutations). If you 
could flesh out the bit I quoted from you above, we&#x27;d be on the same 
track.
I guess the way I&#x27;d tackle it using your definition is to look at a 
permutation (a b) (where a&lt;b, say).
So you have 1 2 ... a-1 b a+1 a+2 ... b-1 a b+1 ...
The number b has (b-1)-(a-1)=b-a smaller numbers on the right, 
namely a,...,b-1.
The numbers a+1,...,b-1 all have just 1 smaller number to the right 
(namely a).
All the other numbers have no smaller numbers to the right.
So the total number of wrong pairs is b-a+((b-1)-a)=2b-2a-1 which is 
odd.
So by your definition a transposition is odd.
Now you just need to work the quoted bit above to the effect that if 
you compose 2 permutations the number of wrong pairs is (modulo 2) 
just the sum of the wrong pairs in the permutations. (It won&#x27;t 
generally be the sum, only the sum modulo 2 - and that is the key 
thing here, to be able to prove that.) The sum of an odd number of 
odd number is odd, but due to the specific way you&#x27;ve defined 
odd/even it is something to be proven that composing permutations 
actually does behave as hoped.
(In your example, for instance there are 6 smaller numbers to the 
right of the 8. If you compose with another permutation, will there 
be an even or odd number of smaller numbers to the right of the 8? 
I&#x27;ve not investigated, but perhaps this depends on more than whether 
the 2nd permutation is odd/even on a number by number basis, though 
not for the whole sum.)

Hi Dan H, Gilles, Stefan, Josef,

   Like Gilles I consider each of the three layers equal to the
others, since R r L&#x27; rotates the whole cube (QR). (I use the lower
case letter for slice moves).

  I think the difficulty comes from technique. Take the sequence r U r
U r U r U which flips over four edges. With a good technique this can
easily be done as quickly as R U R&#x27; U&#x27; done twice. I think that if
someone is not used to slice moves it&#x27;s much the same as someone not
being used to doing any finger tricks.

Regards,

David J

I am also split on whether to count slices as one or two moves. My <br>
logic for it counting as 2 is because a slice actually rotates the <br>
internal kernel and 2 center pieces so in effect it is 2 moves plus <br>
a cube rotation when looked at mechanically. A normal move would be <br>
accomplished by rotating 1 center piece(and the 8 pieces around it <br>
of course)while the kernel remains stationary. But like Gilles said, <br>
the cube could be built around a sphere where the kernel would not <br>
be rotated in a slice. For speedcubing purposes though, if I perform <br>
the slice as 2 moves(danK Z perm), I count it as 2. If I do the <br>
slice as 1 move(as in L&#x27;BLS&#x27;L&#x27;B&#x27;S (I like that alg)), I count it as <br>
1. For fewest moves, I would be inclined to count it as 1 move, but <br>
I&#x27;m not an expert in that field.<br>

Hi Eivind,

(Very nice subject, btw. Maybe I can use something like this for my 
lecture as well)

In Dutch, they are called &#x27;orde&#x27;, which looks like order, but I am 
not sure if that&#x27;s really the right word for it.. What matters is: I 
understand what you mean. I haven&#x27;t seen a topic about this, so I 
can&#x27;t help you with that. But I recently found that the maximum 
order is 1260. An alg. with this order is: RU2D&#x27;BD&#x27;. It took me 
about 50 minutes to verify this. However, I don&#x27;t know how to prove 
that this really is the max. order.

Hi :-)

The idea for finding the maaximum order of a permutation is to 
realise that a permutation is a combination of disjoint corner-cycles 
and edge-cycles. So what u do is to decompose the permutation into 
it&#x27;s individual cycles. Then simply determine the LCM (least common 
multiple) of these cycles. Also u have to keep in mind what 
combinations of cycles will be possible to yield an overall even 
permutation. And also u have only 8 corners and 12 edges to play 
with ;-) A formal proof might have to list all possible corner-cycle 
orders and edge-cycle orders?? Or is there an easier way to prove 
this??

An easier example than urs of such a permutation is the FRBL 
permutation.

Happy cubing :-)

If memory serves me right, I believe it was stated in the link you
posted yesterday that FRBL has an order of ~300.

Hi Richard,<br>
<br>
I think you misunderstood me somehow. Especially this part makes me <br>
think so:<br>
<br>
&gt; (In other words, if you didn&#x27;t do it <br>
&gt; canonically and just switched pairs and eventually came to the <br>
&gt; identity in some non-methodical way, how would you know that you <br>
&gt; always take an odd (or always take an even) number of <br>
&gt; transpositions.)<br>
<br>
I did *not* define a canonical way for &quot;solving&quot; a permutation, but <br>
rather a way for &quot;looking&quot; at it. I.e. the wrong pairs shall not be <br>
swapped in some particular way (there are many ways for this), they <br>
shall only be counted (there&#x27;s only one way=result for this).<br>
<br>
In other words, define for a permutation p:<br>
federminant(p) := (number of wrong pairs in p) mod 2<br>
<br>
What I left as an exercise to Joel is to prove:<br>
1) federminant(identity) = 0<br>
2) federminant(swap(p,i,j)) = (federminant(p) + 1) mod 2<br>
Where swap(p,i,j) is the permutation you get by swapping elements i <br>
and j in permutation p.<br>
<br>
Simple induction shows that if you take permutation p, apply k swaps, <br>
and reach permutation q, you have:<br>
federminant(q) = (federminant(p) + k) mod 2<br>
<br>
Now assume you take permutation p=identity, apply k swaps (with odd k)<br>
, and reach permutation q=identity. Then you have (everything mod 2):<br>
<br>
federminant(identity)<br>
= federminant(q)<br>
= federminant(p) + k<br>
= federminant(identity) + 1<br>
= 0 + 1<br>
= 1<br>
<br>
Contradiction!<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s something missing in my proof (other than the <br>
exercise part of course ;-), hopefully my more formal description <br>
above makes clearer what I mean.<br>
<br>
What do you say?<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

This is not a proof but a construction of such a case...

Let the alg have these effect:

- The corners are permuted in two cycles, one of length 3 and one of 
length 5. Also, they have wrong orientation, i.e. URF->UFL->ULB->RFU 
instead of reaching URF again. This results in the large cycle being 
solved again after 3*5 alg executions and the small cycle after 3*3. 
Overall LCM(3*5,3*3)=(3*5)*3, the latter factor 3 coming from the 
orientation.

- Similarly, the edges have two cycles, one of length 2 and one of 
length 7 (I don&#x27;t care about the remaining 3 edges). And orientation 
in each cycle is wrong again. Overall the edges need (2*7)*2 alg 
executions.

Then LCM(3*5*3,2*7*2) = 1260

The thing is, you want to get as many different prime factors in there 
as possible. I have 2 and 7 from edges, and 3 and 5 from corners. And 
I can get additional factors 2 and 3 from edge/corner orientations. 
Now for a proof you could try out all possibilities of cycle sizes... 
;-)

Cheers!
Stefan

While we&#x27;re on this topic I thought I would post something related <br>
that I found.<br>
<br>
How could one construct an algorithm that would cycle through all <br>
possible positions of the cube (a &quot;Devil&#x27;s Algorithm&quot; as I&#x27;ve seen <br>
it written).<br>
<br>
The algorithms would be good as long as it cycled though all <br>
43252003274489856000 positions on the cube, regardless of whether it <br>
repeated positions or not.<br>
<br>
This is of course possible, even with a random string of notation <br>
that is absolutely enormously larger than the number of possible <br>
combinations to the cube.<br>
<br>
However, the interesting question is whether or not it is possible <br>
to have an algorithm of length 43252003274489855999 (staring from <br>
the solved state) that cycles through all possible positions of the <br>
cube (including having started at the solved state).  Maybe it <br>
doesn&#x27;t even have to cycle through all the positions, but just have <br>
the first 43252003274489855999 moves pass through the same number of <br>
states (starting from the solved, or technically any, state.<br>
<br>
Maybe you could look at this by drawing a graph with <br>
43252003274489856000 nodes as a bipartite graph including all even <br>
an odd positions, and also grouped together with various <br>
characteristics (say positions that are all 2 moves away from each <br>
other are drawn close together).  Each position could only reach 18 <br>
others, 17 if you include the fact that you had to do a move to get <br>
to that position.  To be more precise, only quarter turns would be <br>
allowed, since performing a double turn is by the purest sense <br>
either doing R R or R&#x27; R&#x27; or some other equivalent<br>
<br>
I honestly haven&#x27;t put too much thought into this to be honest, but <br>
it is an interesting question nonetheless.  Would using graph theory <br>
and trying to create some sort of Hamiltonian chain, or even a <br>
Hamiltonian cycle, work as a way to do this?<br>
<br>
Since that would take too much computing power, are there any <br>
patterns we can use to come up with such an algorithm?<br>
<br>
Also would this algorithm have any sort of <br>
regularity/symmetry/interesting charateristics, or would it be <br>
totally random in appearance?<br>
<br>
There would of course be an infinite number of algorithms that would <br>
achieve this affect, however how many are there with length <br>
43252003274489855999, if any at all?  If there aren&#x27;t any of that <br>
length, what is the shortest possible lentgh you can have to cycle <br>
through all the positions of the cube?  Can you do it without <br>
repeating any positions at all?<br>
<br>
Can you repeat positions often, though come up with an easy pattern <br>
for writing out a Devil&#x27;s algorithm?<br>
<br>
I guess the holy grail of this would be any algorithm of exactly <br>
length 43252003274489856000 that perfectly cycled through all the <br>
possible positions of the cube.  Such that, starting from any state, <br>
if you performed this algorithm you would not only end at the same <br>
state you started at, but have cycled through all possible positions <br>
as well.<br>
<br>
Just some questions I thought might spark some conversation.<br>

Hey Eivind :D

Yes u are correct. 

(FRBL)*315 will yield a solved cube again (when u start from solved :-
P ) I guess i was confusing with supercubing calculations. (FRBL)*315 
will have the following effect on centers : [F&#x27;R&#x27;B&#x27;L&#x27;], all are 
rotated counterclockwise. So if one wants to solve the centers also a 
power of 1260 is needed. And of course any permutation of order 1260 
will fix the centers, so this is the maximum order also in the 
supergroup ;-)

-Per

PS! One can quite easily verify orders of permutation using for 
instance the FMC companion !! Just check which is the lowest order 
yielding a solved cube. Incidentally, for FRBL, if it&#x27;s repeated 105 
times u get a corner 3-twist on the D layer :-)

Hi Chris,

   I recommend beginning with a sequence which will go through all
possible combinations of two sides being turned one quarter turn. What
algorithm accomplishing this has the fewest moves? Is this, going
through 15 positions, a small enough part of the problem to allow us
to hold a contest?  

Regards,

David J

P.S. The new IBM supercomputer can perform 43252003274489856000
calculations in about a week.

No, what I meant was a canonical way of defining odd vs even (rather 
than solving the permutation): namely sum over x #{y:y&lt;x and y is to 
the right of x} (mod 2).

2) is what I was referring to - hadn&#x27;t realized you were leaving 
this as an exercise. This is the part I was saying was vital.
Then I agree with you. (The point I was trying to make is that I 
thought you were leaving 2) out.)

(All the rest is agreed.)

Hey David, that&#x27;s a really cool puzzle!

Just some opening thoughts.

First it would help to know the numer of possible states that can be 
reached using only 2 quarter turns (assuming that repetition of 
turning the same face twice is allowed).

I count 115 positions reachable by doing two quarter turns.  96 if 
they are perpendicular faces, 12 if they are parallel faces, and 7 
if you turn the same face twice in succession.

The critical thing to notice is that all the positions that need to 
be reached are even permutations, so we have to go through an odd 
permutation to reach each new position.

I guess an optimal algorithm in this puzzle would be one that 
reached all 115 positions that need to be reached, but never 
repeated any odd permutation.  You could also have an algorithm that 
achieved all 115 positions, but repeated some or multiple odd 
permutations.

If an optimal length algorithm exists then it would have to be 230 
moves long.  Assuming you start from the solved state and that every 
second move you achieve a distinct even permutation that is also one 
of our 115.  I don&#x27;t think an optimal algorithm would exist though.

You could something like 
R F4 U4 B4 D4 L4 R R F4 U4 B4 D4 L4 R L F4 U4 B4 D4 R4 L L F4 U4 B4 
D4 R4

To cycle through all 38 positions unique to the RL axis, but to get 
to a positions such as UR where a face in the UD axis is turned 
first, you have to go through the solved state.

So my proposal for a shortest alg would be the following:  any face 
turn followed by a 4 means 4 clockwise turns, just written shorter.

1) cycle through all positions unqiue to the RL axis
R F4 U4 B4 D4 L4 R R F4 U4 B4 D4 L4 R L F4 U4 B4 D4 R4 L L F4 U4 B4 
D4 R4

2) solve the cube again
L

3) cycle through all the positions unique to the UD axis
U F4 R4 B4 L4 D4 U U F4 R4 B4 L4 D4 U D F4 R4 B4 L4 U4 D D F4 R4 B4 
L4 U4

4) solve the cube again
D

5) cycle through all the positions unique to the FB axis
F U4 R4 D4 L4 B4 F F U4 R4 D4 L4 B4 F B U4 R4 D4 L4 F4 B B U4 R4 D4 
L4 F4

and you could optionally solve the cube again with B to create a 
true cycle.

So my alg is 264 moves if you make it a true cycle by adding the 
final F and is:

R F4 U4 B4 D4 L4 R R F4 U4 B4 D4 L4 R L F4 U4 B4 D4 R4 L L F4 U4 B4 
D4 R4 L U F4 R4 B4 L4 D4 U U F4 R4 B4 L4 D4 U D F4 R4 B4 L4 U4 D D 
F4 R4 B4 L4 U4 D F U4 R4 D4 L4 B4 F F U4 R4 D4 L4 B4 F B U4 R4 D4 L4 
F4 B B U4 R4 D4 L4 F4 B

and repeates positions therefore 264-230=34 times.

I think, due to the nature of having to have a certain face having 
been turned &quot;first&quot; for many of the positions, that this would be an 
optimal alg.

Just my guess though, but I think it works.  I doubt my reasoning 
counts as an actual proof, but I think it works out.

Hi Chris,

a while ago I asked about something similar, like a combination of 
your idea and the original thread question. In my opinion the real 
holy grail would be: An algorithm of length 43252003274489856000/1260 
which, applied 1260 times, cycles through all states.

Ah, ok... so we did indeed misunderstand each other a bit ;-)

How about this proof of step 2): Call a swap of two adjacent elements 
a &quot;bubble&quot;. Swapping any two elements A and B in a sequence is the 
same as first bubbling A towards B (so they&#x27;re adjacent), then 
bubbling A and B, then bubbling B back to A&#x27;s original place by 
undoing the first part. A bubble clearly changes &quot;evenness&quot; of the 
number of wrong pairs. And for a swap, we do (n+1+n) bubbles. So a 
swap changes that evenness, too.

Cheers!
Stefan

That&#x27;s not really going to help, since there&#x27;s no linear time 
algorithm to solve the problem, since in general it&#x27;s NP-complete (and 
I doubt our special case is special enough to make it easier):

Yeah yeah Stefan, tricking with cube turns won&#x27;t make any 
difference :-P

-Cubix

PS! Then any of the following will do:

Ry, Ry&#x27;, Rx, Rx&#x27;, Rz, Rz&#x27; (or even the same ones w R&#x27; in place of R.
Or for that matter any other face clockwise or counterclockwise. By 
symmetry and or inversion they are all the same :D

zzzzzzzzzzzzzz ..........

Hehe, happy cubing :-)

Hey!

I know it can be proven that one algorithm wouldn&#x27;t be enough. Two 
algorithms is needed. I have even seen published 2 short algs to do 
that. But some quick search on the net didn&#x27;t succeed in finding 
those algs, or anything else about it for that matter. I&#x27;m pretty 
sure Richard Carr knows what im talking about. I think it was 
published a long time ago actually, like 1982 or -83. But internet 
didn&#x27;t exist back then :-P Not like we know it now anyway ;-)

Holy sh.. that&#x27;s so easy I feel embarrassed I didn&#x27;t know it ;-) You 
know, until last year I would&#x27;ve done R&#x27;D2RDR&#x27;D&#x27;R and I was so proud 
to find my 5-turn solution but I hate it because it&#x27;s ugly to perform.

I think you&#x27;re talking about something different. We&#x27;re talking about 
one algorithm that during (!) its execution comes across all states.

Btw, I doubt an algorithm of 43252003274489856000/1260 turns has been 
published ;-)

Guess why I added that as a P.S.?

Putting aside the devil&#x27;s algorithm, if all the possble positions can
be reached in 25 moves then with proper guidance that computer could
cover all the possible positions in 6 months.

If the positions were stored in such a way that all positions one move
away from each other were linked then God&#x27;s Algorithm would be found
as the shortest paths. Tha this would take more than one of these
computers and cost several million dollars is beside the point! :)

Hey Stefan!

At least &quot;ur&quot; solution is shorter in QTM, if that&#x27;s any consolation. 

And ur line of thinking can be followed for centers on the 5x5x5. One 
can pick up a D center to the U layer with the following alg :

r&#x27;B&#x27;d2Br

Quit neat, huh ?

Hey!

Jess Bonde&#x27;s online timer can give u 5x5x5 scrambles but with out 
use of M, E and S layer turns, and only of length 40. My 
CubeScrambler in the file section of this group will let generate 
5x5x5 scrambles of any feasible lenghts. And u can specify the 
number of scrambles u want. And optionally it can use M, E and S 
also :-) Unfortunately (or deliberately :-P ) it&#x27;s not a java 
program. It&#x27;s much more painless to make GUI in Delphi ;-)

Happy scrambling :D

Thanks Tyson and thanks Per

Your scramble program is exactly what I need!

Hey Chris,

   I had meant all positions involving two sides, but you are allowing
for a side to be turned twice; that&#x27;s OK with me.

   For clarity&#x27;s sake I&#x27;ll lay them all the possibilities out. 

   Two quarter turns allowing the second turn to be the same side as
the first, including repeated positions: (6*2)*(6*2)=144 positions: if
same side twice isn&#x27;t allowed (6*2)*(5*2)=120

   12 are two turns on one side resulting in a double turn

     RR, LL, FF, BB, UU, DD
     R&#x27;R&#x27;, L&#x27;L&#x27;, F&#x27;F&#x27;, B&#x27;B&#x27;, U&#x27;U&#x27;, D&#x27;D&#x27;

   12 are two turns on one side resulting in a solved cube

     RR&#x27;, R&#x27;R,  LL&#x27;, L&#x27;L, FF&#x27;, F&#x27;F, BB&#x27;, B&#x27;B, UU&#x27;, U&#x27;U, DD&#x27;, D&#x27;D

   6 * 16 = 96 are adjacent sides

     RF, RF&#x27;, R&#x27;F, R&#x27;F&#x27;
     RB, RB&#x27;, R&#x27;B, R&#x27;B&#x27;

     DB, DB&#x27;, D&#x27;B, D&#x27;B&#x27;

  6 * 4 = 24 opposite side moves of which 12 are duplicates opposite
one another

    RL same as LR 
    RL&#x27; same as L&#x27;R
    R&#x27;L same as L R&#x27; 
    R&#x27;L&#x27; same as L&#x27;R&#x27;

    FB same as BF 
    FB&#x27; same as B&#x27;F
    F&#x27;B same as B F&#x27; 
    F&#x27;B&#x27; same as B&#x27;F&#x27;

    UD same as DU
    UD&#x27; same as D&#x27;U
    U&#x27;D same as DU&#x27; 
    U&#x27;D&#x27; same as D&#x27;U&#x27;

All positions minus duplicate and solved positions 144 - 24 = 120 
All positions minus doubled turns minus duplicate positions
144 - 24  - 12 = 108

I&#x27;ll get to the rest later.

My best,

David J

Hey!

Dun wanna spoil the fun of negative time solving, but what&#x27;s the big 
deal ? ;-) U do a solve and u subtract 1 hr :-P One could do negative 
time toilet visit, negative time pasta cooking and so on. And 
besides, i prefer to sleep at 3 am at night ... :D

I have never heard of m, e and s before so I cannot comment on them. I
like to call m Ls for example. Other than that, everything seems to be
fine... the only thing being that L is illustrated with L&#x27; and vice
versa, same thing for l and l&#x27;. That&#x27;s the only error I can find.

Hi Matt,

   You&#x27;ve confused &quot;finger trick&quot; notation for the main notation,
which unfortunately is common.

   The small case letters r l u d f b are slices. Some people use r to
designate turning two levels R and and the center slice next to it
like in your file, but in truth they are turning L and rotating the
cube. To make this clear they are turning one level but calling it two.

   The reason the small case letters are used is because it is the
same notation as the 4x4x4, and is much easier to remember than M E S
or &quot;Rs&quot; etc.

Regards,

   David J

Hi Evan, Tyson,

   Since negative time is based on the time change from Daylight
Savings to Standard time, and since this happens in at least 4 time
zones then it can be done 4 times each year. That means Evan&#x27;s average
of 12 could be done by the fall of 2007.

:)

How can you say that the small case letters designate slice turns or
that they don&#x27;t when there are lots of examples for both cases?
There&#x27;s no single answer to this question because there is no single
uniform notation being used.

r means RM&#x27; at some sites and M&#x27; at others. You can&#x27;t say that r _is_
RM&#x27; or that it _is_ M&#x27; unless you suddenly declare yourself supreme
dictator of all cube notation.

I always saw lower case letters as representing turning the layer 
next to the the normal outer layer and it just so happens that on a 
3x3, r, the layer next to R happens to be a slice. I have seen it 
used as turning 2 layer but if the preceding notation is used, then 
it is easy enough to just write Rr (which I like). r and M&#x27; are 
interchangble (only on a 3x3) for all I&#x27;m concerned. For simply 
writing algs I would be inclined to use M E and S though.
Also, I&#x27;m not fond of the xyz rotation notation. Q[x] is easier and 
more logical.

Hi!

As regards to physical rotation of the cube i would vote for 
following notation:

Fc, Rc and so on.

Fc means move F, but let the rest of cube move with it.
F&#x27;c means move F&#x27;, but let the rest of cube move with it.
And so on ...

Possibly use brackets : F(c), R(c). I find x,y and z confusing.

Maybe this is something for WCA to look into? Since notation will be 
used in international competitions we might as well standardise the 
notation being used. And also look into the HTM/STM issue.

Cheers!!

Not to be the only annoying guy here but I don&#x27;t see what is wrong 
with using M,E,S for inner slices and x,y,z for cube rotations.  You 
only have to memorize two conventions, MES corresponds with LDF, and 
xyz wit RUF.

With as many algorithms as we all learn, I don&#x27;t think learning two 
3 letter acronyms is asking for much more.

Again I don&#x27;t mean to sound mean or cynical or to shoot anyone&#x27;s 
ideas down, but I personally think there is nothing wrong with 
M,E,S,x,y,z notation.  This would even easily extend to larger cube 
notation.  Personally I prefer using r[1,2,3,...,floor((n-2)/2)] to 
denote any inner slice of the nxnxn cube.  I restrict the highest 
value to floor((n-2)/2) for two reasons.  This means you can&#x27;t do 
something like r[4] to denote turning l&#x27; on a 5x5x5 and also it 
leaves room for allowing the single letter M to be used for the 
middle slice instead of either r[3] or l[3]&#x27; for the 5x5x5.  For 
larger cubes I think it is clearer to use M,E,S notation than it is 
to denote the center row on an axis by either of the two sides.

We haven&#x27;t agreed on a standard notation for the larger cube either, 
granted, however I think that using M,E,S facillates easier notation 
since it also expands well to the nxnxn cube.

Just my thoughts,

Chris

not much more to say, check out the notation glossary on my website, everything you could ever need to describe a move or rotation on the cube is there, and the tokens are easy to learn, as Chris said. Even RubikPlayer has this notation built in as a standard notation, &quot;HarrisENG&quot;.

Hi Eivind,

   I can say what I said because I was only stating what I prefer and
why. In the scheme I use, r *is* a slice move. That notation is the
simplest scheme. And I shouldn&#x27;t be labeled as a dictator for saying so.

   My point was that the notation which was posted uses small case
letters to stand for *two* levels being moved, when in fact one level
is being moved. This is not the main notation, this is within a
&quot;finger trick&quot; notation scheme. It should be labeled as such.

   I understand that there is no consensus. Earlier this year I tried
for a consensus, and I politely asked people not to use small case r l
u d f b for &quot;finger tricks&quot; since it essentially hijacks the older,
simpler system. I think a solution to moving all of the slices as one
in the larger cubes can be found without trashing the system I use. 

   Please note that you don&#x27;t need to insult me to disagree with me.

Hi!

Yes, I also agree that there is no other good substitute for M, E and 
S. Not that i can think of anyway. But for x,y,z i think the notation 
i suggested is more intuitive. I think i have seen Ton or Jaap use 
that notation for cube moves and i think it&#x27;s very elegant.

My main worry about notation(s) is actually to remove ambiguity. One 
shouldn&#x27;t need to know what size cube is this notation for? is this 
fingertrick notation or common move notation? Notation should be 
clear regardless of cube size and context within which it&#x27;s being 
used. 

Take for example the lowercase : frblud. Now it&#x27;s being used in at 
least 3 different ways :

1) The layers next to FRBLUD respectively (on a 3x3x3 cube that would 
mean one of M, E or S)

2)The middle layer parallell to FRBLUD respectively (always 
corresponds to M,E or S, and would only make sense on odd size cube)

3) (on 3x3x3 solely) The layer FRBLU or D and its adjacent layer. So 
in this case it would turn 2 layers. If i have understood correctly 
this is the fingertrick notation.

As for notation for larger cubes i would support Chris&#x27; notation.

PS! I did expect Dan Harris to support Harris-notation ;-)

Oh Chris, now I&#x27;m disappointed ;-)

The problem I see is: inconsistency. Why is MES=LDF and xyz=RUF? Why 
don&#x27;t both simply use the same (e.g. MES=RUF, too)?

Look above at what you wrote, you mention M=r[3]=l[3]&#x27; but this is 
exactly the wrong direction (according to what you wrote first). How 
can you claim it&#x27;s simple when you get it wrong yourself?

Cheers ;-)

Maybe that&#x27;s only your opinion. I think it&#x27;s perfectly alright to 
think of it as turning two layers. Here&#x27;s one example where I 
explicitly turn two layers *thinking* of it this way, not because it&#x27;s 
faster to execute:

First try this alg:
(R&#x27; D&#x27; R) U (R&#x27; D R) U (R&#x27; D&#x27; R) U2 (R&#x27; D R)
This cycles three U corners. This is part of an LL strategy easy to 
understand even for beginners.

Now try this alg (lower case d meaning &quot;turn two layers&quot;):
(R&#x27; d&#x27; R) U (R&#x27; d R) U (R&#x27; d&#x27; R) U2 (R&#x27; d R)
This cycles three U corner-edge-pairs (i.e. yet another PLL).

See? I don&#x27;t do the double-layer-twist as a finger trick, but use it 
because it makes so much more sense thinking this way.

I bet you&#x27;d also vote for counting inner slice turns as two moves ;-)

That said, I&#x27;d actually vote for &quot;frblud&quot; meaning only the inner 
slice. I only used it the other way in the above example to make the 
similarity to the first alg more obvious. I&#x27;d use it for 
&quot;inner-slice-only&quot; because otherwise this would be inconsistent to our 
notation for 4x4/5x5. In fact, I added yet another notation on my 
4x4/5x5 algs page to denote the double-layer-twist, but I get confused 
by it myself and look at the other notation instead, so I&#x27;ll remove 
mine when I update the page again.

Per, how do you like this last part? I came up with it in several 
steps:

First I wanted to solve it using two commutator 3-cycles, so I started 
with:
U (S d S&#x27;) U2 (S d&#x27; S&#x27;) U

Then I noticed that I could achieve the same effect using the already 
solved centers, so instead I did:
(S d S&#x27;) U (S d&#x27; S&#x27;) U&#x27;

Then I added this to solve the remaining two:
(S u&#x27; S&#x27;) U (S u S&#x27;) U&#x27;

At that point I noticed I could do both algorithms at the same time, 
resulting in:
(S d u&#x27; S&#x27;) U (S d&#x27; u S&#x27;) U&#x27;

And then I added the E and E&#x27; to make it easier to execute:
(S (u&#x27;Ed) S&#x27;) U (S (uE&#x27;d&#x27;) S&#x27;) U&#x27;

Afterwards it looks so obvious... ;-)

Hey Stefan !!

Yes i knew about it already. It&#x27;s one of those algs i wish i could 
spot when i do final centers of my 5x5x5 method when speedsolving ;-) 
But normally 2 simple 3-cycles is pretty fast anyway. And moving 3 
inner parallell layers fast isn&#x27;t too easy ... It&#x27;s a cool algorithm, 
and not really too obvious at first. It does of course rotate 2 
middle centers. So for super-solving it&#x27;s not really so good ;-)

Happy cubing :-)

Hi Per,

   For moving centers around try: r2 d r2 d&#x27; and r f&#x27; r&#x27; f

   These have the virtue of only having the centers moved at the end.

David J

   I don&#x27;t think you or the others in the conversation are being mean
or cynical. 

   The problem is that people get confused by x,y and z coordinates.
If you are into geometry, map making, anatomy, sailing or flying then
chances are that you know the coordinates.

   And if you already know the coordinates then you also know that the
x,y,and z coordinates given in the notation on Dan&#x27;s cubestation 
are wrong!

f is around horozontal line x which moves front to back, roll 
r is around horozontal line y which moves latterally, pitch 
d is around the vertical line z, yaw

   In your second example what you&#x27;re really doing is:
   (R&#x27; U&#x27; B) U (B&#x27; U R) U (R&#x27; U&#x27; B) U2 (B&#x27; U R)

   as such I see your second one as an excellent example of finger
tricks, which alter the main notation to better suit the hands.

whole cube. And this could go futher with F] meaning

Would be nice to formulate a &quot;ANSI&quot; or &quot;ISO&quot; standard

Hi all!<br>

Here is my opinion regarding the notation, partly given as a most <br>
biased summary of the discussion in this thread so far.<br>
<br>
R, R2, R&#x27; etc, no problems.<br>
<br>
I am grown up with the slice notation of Rs, Ls, Fs etc, meaning Ls <br>
= Rs&#x27; = M, originating(???) from Singmaster. I do not like the M, E, <br>
S notation, partly because I do not like to introduce unnecessary <br>
letters in the notation scheme, partly because it is not obvious if <br>
M=Rs or M=Rs&#x27;. However, I find the notation with r=Rs etc to be neat <br>
and compact.<br>
<br>
I second Pers suggestion of Fc etc for cube rotation instead of x, <br>
y, z. Same reason as for discarding the M, E, S notation.<br>
<br>
Chris&#x27; r[i] notation for the general cube is good.<br>

Unless I am being extremely stupid here, (it is not unusual for me), the co-ordinates on my website are correct.

If you put the cube at the centre of 3-dimensional co-ordinates, than you can do simple rotations to bring about the positions shown. No mirrors needed :)

Hey!

M is neither Rs nor R&#x27;s ;-) M = RsR&#x27;c with the &quot;new&quot; cube-move 
notation. Netto effect is to turn only the middle layer, not 2 outer 
layers like u wrote.

Likewise E = UsU&#x27;c, and S = F&#x27;sFc 

Furthermore M, E and S extends nicely to any odd size cube. It means 
always the very middle layers.

Another logical way to replace M, E and S could be :

M = Lm = R&#x27;m
E = Dm = U&#x27;m
S = Fm = B&#x27;m

This leaves following subscript variations :

Fa : antislice
Fs : slice
Fc : equivalent cubemove
Fm : equivalent very middle layer

This is neat and tidy in my opinion!! :D

Cheers!

No, that is *definitely not* what I&#x27;m doing!

I always let the U layer be stationary for the A and A&#x27; parts of an 
ABA&#x27;B&#x27; commutator because it&#x27;s much easier to think that way. The U 
layer is turned solely for the B and B&#x27; parts. This alg is created in 
commutator-style. So those U&#x27; and U you claim I&#x27;m doing inside the 
parentheses are certainly not what I&#x27;m doing. Also, I&#x27;m certainly 
*never* twisting the B face there.

Don&#x27;t tell me what I&#x27;m doing ;-)

>    Actually I&#x27;m already on record for counting slice turns as one 
move. 

But if you really see an inner slice as a &quot;normal&quot; slice, how come you 
don&#x27;t accept those 3x3 two-layer-turns as &quot;normal&quot; turns?

Note that I do agree that lowercase letters shouldn&#x27;t mean 
double-layer-twists. But that&#x27;s no reason to claim they don&#x27;t exist 
and are something else. They are legitimate twists and I just think 
they should be written as Rr (for example).

Hi Dan,

   The coordinates on your website are not correct. I don&#x27;t know the
root of the problem, unless you didn&#x27;t bother to read the reference I
gave you.

   You have the x axis labeled z, the the y axis labeled x, and the z
axis labeled y.

Hi Matt,

   The convention in the notation that I use has QR, QU and QF for
cube rotations. People find that Q for &quot;cube&quot; is easy to remember, and
only takes one extra keystroke.

Sorry David,

but Dan is indeed &quot;correct&quot;. How you &quot;look&quot; at the coordinate system 
is totally up to you, so there&#x27;s no &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;. Even that 
MathWorld page you pointed us to uses two different rotations in the 
two images at the top.

Also, no serious mathematician would ever say that x,y,z must mean 
horizontal, vertical or something similar. You can draw/use it any way 
you like, as long as it&#x27;s defined (or at least obvious). The MathWorld 
pictures are only examples of possible views, not globally valid 
facts.

Cheers!
Stefan

that&#x27;s true, BUT - most people are familiar with x and y axes and instinctively know how these work, but people probably wont have come across the z-axis unless they take maths at a high level or something. So the x and y axes are as they would be in 2-dimensions, and then the z-axis must be the dimension that is left.

They still make a correct set of right-handed axes, just not rotated in the way that one might see in a text book. Rotate the cube so that z points up, and you will see :)

  Hi Dan,

     The coordinates on your website are not correct. I don&#x27;t know the
  root of the problem, unless you didn&#x27;t bother to read the reference I
  gave you.

     You have the x axis labeled z, the the y axis labeled x, and the z

   Sorry, editting error, that should read: R&#x27; U&#x27; B U B&#x27; U R U R&#x27; U&#x27; B
U2 B&#x27; U R with no parentheses.

  Looking at it from the point of view of the cube not rotating in
space (ie the centers stay in place) it is the same algorithm. All I
did was change the notation and there is nothing to indicte what hand
is used to hold the cube or rotate it or turn a side.

   Good. That&#x27;s my point.

   That&#x27;s not what I meant.

   I agree. From that vantage your example could be written as: (R&#x27;
D&#x27;d&#x27; R) U (R&#x27; Dd R) U (R&#x27; D&#x27;d&#x27; R) U2 (R&#x27; Dd R)

   Why don&#x27;t you try L&#x27; U2 L U L&#x27; U2 R U&#x27; L U R&#x27; instead? This
replaces your 16 moves with 11.

   And why not do R2 B2 R F R&#x27; B2 R F&#x27; R for your first example? This
replaces yours with 9 moves! It&#x27;s much faster.

   Those two different pictures are different ways of showing the same
coordinate system, not two coordinate systems.

   My point is that it isn&#x27;t obvio if you&#x27;ve been working in the
conventions way. I&#x27;m after a notation that doesn&#x27;t automatically tuen
people away. Leaving the conventional way confuses people.

   Well I&#x27;ve been telling you of the conventional x,y,z I learned in
math class, then in anatomy, then in flight lessons, and in lots of
other places.

That sounds good to me also. I&#x27;ve noticed that many people don&#x27;t like 
x, y, and z, so I&#x27;ll be happy to change to Fc if this becomes 
popular. For multiple layer turns, Japan Speed Cubing Club already 
uses these:
Fw : double layer
Ft : triple layer (for 4x4x4+, of course)

These can be extended to:
Md: middle two layers (on 4x4x4)
Mt: middle three layers (on 5x5x5)
Yes, these can certainly be done using Chris&#x27; notation (which I 
support). However, as these seem to be used frequently, I thought it 
a good idea that they have a separate notation.

What do you guys think?

Doesn&#x27;t make it any better. The U&#x27;s are still there in places they 
don&#x27;t belong...

That&#x27;s what it sounds like.

Yes, that&#x27;s how I would usually write it.

I wasn&#x27;t going for speed, but for simplicity. I can explain my alg 
easily and teach it to a beginner so that it&#x27;s easy to actually 
understand how/why it works. For speedsolving I do use (the inverse 
of) yours.

Same as above.

Actually, how about Fd for double layer (what does w stand for anyway?
) and Fp instead of Fc for rotating the whole p(uzzle)? Then we can 
extend the notation to Pyraminx, Megaminx, Domino, ...

I&#x27;m among Dan&#x27;s people ;-)

Instead of mathematicians let&#x27;s ask people who actually do care about 
the rotation, the OpenGL people:
http://rush3d.com/reference/opengl-redbook-1.1/chapter03.html
Search for section &quot;Thinking about Transformations&quot;.

Btw, do you realize this has *nothing* to do with our cubing issue?

   If you don&#x27;t see that U&#x27; (QU) and D&#x27;d&#x27; are the same thing then
that&#x27;s not my problem.  Of course you can call all U moves Dd and do
away with U completely, but outside of maybe some finger tricks I see
no need to do that.

   If the cube floats in space and someone sees just the sides turning
the two would be identical. Writing it different doesn&#x27;t make it a
different algorithm.

    I am noting a difference between the main notation and finger
trick notation. I just think that the main notation should have
precedence over the finger trick notation.

   Why not write it as (R&#x27; U&#x27; QU R) U (R&#x27; U QU&#x27; R) U (R&#x27; U&#x27; QU R) U2
(R&#x27; U QU&#x27; R) ?

It *is* related to cubing: Looking ahead helps a lot ;-) A few times I 
got three in a row because I had found the last two of those three 
shortly before the first. Also, while chasing and clicking your next 
target, look around for the next, you don&#x27;t have to focus on your

Wrong, it&#x27;s just not your *view*. In my view they&#x27;re not the same 
thing. The problem comes from our different definitions of equality 
for algorithms. You&#x27;re using the cube core as a reference, while I&#x27;m 
simply not. How come we prefer to look at things differently and I say 
exactly that, while you say I&#x27;m wrong and you&#x27;re right?

Btw, according to you, when doing M what you&#x27;re really doing is (L&#x27; R 
QL), so that&#x27;s three moves, not one. Inconsistent.

Because that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m doing.

Ok, just one more to explain why I think so: Your mission is to 
convince people that xyz and MES are bad and that lrdufb should mean 
inner slices only, right? But I agree with that!

Apparantly, I&#x27;m been out of cube notation for too long (and all my 
old cube notes are gone). I remembered Rs as the same as M. However, 
what do you (and others) mean by a &#x27;slice move&#x27;? For me, a slice 
move is only turning a middle layer. Thus, (my) Rs is a slice move 
and not equal to RL&#x27; but equal to RL&#x27;Lc

I second this (if &#x27;slice&#x27; is defined)! What do you mean by calling 
Fm &#x27;equivalent&#x27;? Isn&#x27;t it just a regular turn of the middle layer?

1st try: 65 seconds
2nd try: 46 seconds
3rd try: 42 seconds
4th try: 41 seconds
5th try (I shouldn&#x27;t write it, it just shows I couldn&#x27;t keep up for 
long): 51 seconds

First 4 tries rapidly converged towards 41 seconds. Did everybody 
have something like that too? And yes, it is related to cubing: you 
can be lucky. In the beginning I cheated a bit by moving my mouse 
all over the place so that the first digits would be touched, but on 
the other hand I wouldn&#x27;t wait for them to spread...

PS. I don&#x27;t have to click on the target, I just need to mouseover 
it. Does it happen to you too?
PPS. I should go to bed now :)

Hey!

U remember wrong :-) Ever since Singmaster in 1980 or maybe even 
before, Fs has meant turning F and B&#x27; (same way in space,) and Fa has 
meant turning F and B (both F and B are turned clockwise). Hence the 
subscripts denote &quot;slice&quot; and &quot;antislice&quot;. The original Singmaster 
notation didn&#x27;t have any inner layer move notation: the M, E and S. 
Those were added later. If i remember correctly this was done by the 
german Christoph Bandelow.

Hmm, isn&#x27;t that asking for a position of maximum distance to the 
solved position? I.e. a question that - as far as I know - has not 
been answered yet, only with lower and upper bounds? And your question 
seems to be even more difficult since the position you&#x27;re after can&#x27;t 
even have a neighbour of same distance.

The only answer I could think of is to cheat. Use the empty sequence. 
That one has length 0. All positions reached by another move can be 
reached in 0-1=-1 moves by &quot;undoing&quot; a move.

Cheers!

   Correct, that&#x27;s not what you are doing, and that was my point! I
wasn&#x27;t talking about what you were doing, but about how you were
writing it down.

   We have a misunderstanding. You think I&#x27;m saying that you are doing
something other than what you are doing. I&#x27;m not.

   I&#x27;m saying that your notation for that algorithm was &quot;finger trick&quot;
notation. I think that finger trick notation is not the main notation,
and shouldn&#x27;t have precedence over the main notation. 

   One last try to be clear:

   The effect *on the cube* of both  (R&#x27; d&#x27; R) U (R&#x27; d R) U (R&#x27; d&#x27; R)
U2 (R&#x27; d R) and R&#x27; U&#x27; B U B&#x27; U R U R&#x27; U&#x27; B U2 B&#x27; U R are the same,
identical every step of the way. If you did them both on parallel
cubes hanging in space, these cubes having the same color scheme, and
remain orientated the same way, then they would be moving exactly the
same way. 

> Btw, according to you, when doing M what you&#x27;re really doing is (L&#x27;
R QL), so that&#x27;s three moves, not one. 

   My point was that the same thing can be described many ways. 

> Inconsistent.

   Not at all. You missed the point. I consider a slice move like r to
be one move. My point was only that that I think that in the main
notation if you move one layer you use one letter to signify it.

> How come we prefer to look at things differently and I say 
> exactly that, while you say I&#x27;m wrong and you&#x27;re right?

   That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m saying. You mislabeled that algorithm. You said
it wasn&#x27;t a finger trick yet the only difference between yours and
mine was in how you handle it. And how you handle the cube is dealt
with in finger trick notation. The main notation is about how the cube
is affected.

   To your hands they are different, to the cube they are the same thing.

   Right.

   Yes, my reference was the cube itself.

   My fault. I thought it was worthwhile to straighten out the
misunderstandings. 

   In another post you wrote:

   Yes, but to get there I&#x27;m trying to make the case that the main
notation should be the primary notation and should have some
precedence over finger trick notation - and thus give people a
consistant way to change... and you show me a finger trick notation
and tell me that it&#x27;s not a finger trick even while you insist that
it&#x27;s all about *how you are doing it*!

Heh, I think I got quite lucky, but now my best time is 32 seconds.
Right before that, I got 42.
I still think I could break 40 without luck, though.

Hi!

I don&#x27;t see any easy solution to this in HTM (half turn metric). But 
i see an obvious solution if we consider QTM (quarter turn metric) 
instead. The sequence im thinking of is the following one :

R2L2U2D2F2B2 (length 12 in QTM)

Every quarter turn after this brings us closer to the solved state.

Must a maximum be symmetric? The sequence above plus the superflip 
and the superfliptwist are all symmetric (in one way or another). The 
superflip and superfliptwist are believed to be global maxima, at 
least in HTM.

Happy cubing !!

That is the one I was thinking of too. At 6 moves htm it is a (non-<br>
strict) local maximum. As I said, I don&#x27;t know of any strict maxima <br>
in htm except for superflip and superfliptwist which can be proved to <br>
be strict maxima due to symmetry.<br>
<br>
The superflip has optimal 20 move solution:<br>
R L D2 B&#x27; L2 F2 R2 U&#x27; D R&#x27; D2 F&#x27;B&#x27; D&#x27; F2 D&#x27; R2 U&#x27; F2 D&#x27;<br>
Clearly the move R leads to a position at depth 19. By rotating the <br>
cube before applying this sequence, the first move need not be R, but <br>
can be any face. Similarly, reflecting this sequence allows the first <br>
move to be any anti-clockwise quarter turn.<br>
By conjugating with R&#x27;L&#x27; we get a different solution:<br>
D2 B&#x27; L2 F2 R2 U&#x27; D R&#x27; D2 F&#x27;B&#x27; D&#x27; F2 D&#x27; R2 U&#x27; F2 D&#x27; R L<br>
With this a half turn also can be used as the first move. Therefore <br>
any move will turn a superflip into a depth 19 position.<br>
<br>
&gt; Must a maximum be symmetric? The sequence above plus the superflip <br>
&gt; and the superfliptwist are all symmetric (in one way or another).<br>
&gt; The superflip and superfliptwist are believed to be global maxima,<br>
&gt; at least in HTM.<br>
<br>
A maximum need not be symmetric. Of course, if there is a maximum <br>
that is not very symmetric, cube rotations/reflections lead to <br>
different (but equivalent) maxima. You can use this to make a <br>
(slightly dubious) probability argument that maximal positions are <br>
more likely to be symmetric.<br>
<br>
That the currently furthest positions are highly symmetric may also <br>
be due to the fact that they easier to find than non-symmetric ones.<br>

Hi (Jaap)!

Just a curiosity. The sequence u gave for the superflip does contain 
both quarterturns and half turns. And as u showed any move will get 
us closer to solved state. So, is it a prerequisite that a sequence 
MUST contain both quarter and half turns, as well as being symmetric, 
in order to be global maximum in half turn metric? 

Back in the mid 80&#x27;s i had great fun working out a solution to the 
superfliptwist problem. I eventually derived a 32 move solution which 
i was proud of. Until i saw it sadly trashed by the Cube Explorer :-P 
This problem was published in the Christoph Bandelow 
classic &quot;Einführung in die Cubologie&quot;. 

And coincidentally i think it was in this book that i for the first 
time saw notation for middle layer moves. He was using MF, MB, MR&#x27; 
and so on. I had thought he came up with the M,E and S but rechecking 
it i was wrong. So who did actually come up with the M,E,S notation?

In our case we know that with half turns we can only get to depth 15 <br>

Superfliptwist:<br>
R L U F D L U R&#x27; F&#x27; R F D U&#x27; F D&#x27; U&#x27; B F&#x27; L U (20f*,20q*)<br>
<br>
It no doubt has many other solutions of 20f that have half turns, and <br>
I would use such a sequence to show that this is a strict maximum in <br>
htm in the same way I did for the superflip.<br>
<br>
Look at the table I have on my site for the 2x2x2 cube:<br>
http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/cube2.htm<br>
It arranges all the positions in a qtm vs htm table. There are <br>
positions at max htm depth but not max qtm depth, and vice versa. In <br>
fact it spreads out quite far along the bottom and right edges of the <br>
table. The superfliptwist shows that this is the case for the 3x3x3 <br>
cube too (assuming diameter 20 in htm).<br>

Hey again!

I know this is getting theoretical now and of no interest for 
SPEEDcubing, but nevertheless ...

U said u would prove it s strict maximum if u had another sequence 
that did contain halfturns. How are u gonna do that? By conjugates? 
Not every conjugate will have the cornertwists arranged as they 
should be. One might work out the probability for that ... But if 
however u find a sequence for the superfliptwist with a halfturn 
first or last, then u are done !! ;-)

Ok, now i gonna see if Cube Explorer finds a sub-20 solution for the 
supertwist :D

True, I spoke too quickly, and yes, I do think there will be one with <br>
a half turn first or last. You could of course just put <br>
superfliptwist+halfturn into Cube explorer to see if it is 19f.<br>

yes i went on auto-pilot typing the puzzle and obviously the 
question is &quot;quarter&quot; turn metric.  and of course this &#x27;little 
detail&#x27; makes all the difference.  so indeed the solution is 
RRLLUUDDFFBB length 12.  obviously, finding the solution in half-
turn metric is &#x27;hard&#x27;, although clearly a solution must exist.  
sorry for confusing everyone.

i am not a mathematics expert, but i wonder how one would go about 
finding the solution in half turn metric without doing an exhaustive 
search.  whoever can solve the half-turn metric case is very clever 
indeed.

A maximum has no neighbouring positions that are further away from 
start.
A position is a strict maximum if all its neighbours are actually 
closer to start (i.e. none equally far away from start as the 
maximum).

A strict maximum is really a highest peak, whereas otherwise it might 
be flat around the maximum.

No.<br>
Most of what I said was about htm where it can happen, but in qtm the <br>
parity ensures that all maxima are strict.<br>
<br>
The reason is that every quarter turn changes the permutation parity <br>
(of the corner pieces). Therefore the parity also shows whether the <br>
solution length in qtm is even or odd. Positions one turn away from a <br>
maximum cannot therefore be at the same depth (nor further away by <br>
definition of maximum) and so that maximum is strict.<br>

Hi Guys,

Appropo of nothing, I&#x27;ve always thought of this as 3 moves: r2 f2 u2.
In my notation, which apparently few others use, slice moves are
indicated by lower case letters.
I see each layer of the cube as equal to the others, and I count any
move as one move whether it is a 90 degree turn or a 180 degree turn.

...not that I have anything against the quarter-turn metric. :)

Regards,

David J

Ok, I&#x27;m dead ;-) Or, me (and my brother) improved the notation by 
defining Rs as a (in our sense)true slice move. Nothing was comme il 
faut in the eighties. Anyhow, no big deal as long as we understand 
each other.

However, we do agree upon the antislice notation.

BUT, one issue is that I am proponent of a specific notation of a 
slice move (that is, a move that only displace a middle layer). 

AND that a slice move should be counted as one move. 

As you might understand, I&#x27;m a &#x27;corners first&#x27; guy.

You could get some from Adam:
http://www.twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3118

I got two sets from him, but I haven&#x27;t applied them yet. So far I can 
tell that mine are not rounded (though new ones might be now, just ask 
him) and look like they could be a little larger. But the quality is 
great, I used a 3x3 set already and it&#x27;s great. And he did it in the 
color scheme I asked him to do (like my 3x3).

Cheers!
Stefan

I could probably make a showing as well, it&#x27;s only an 8 hour drive for

Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I wanted to wait until I finished updating both my OLL and PLL pages <br>
before posting, but it&#x27;s taking longer than I expected to do both <br>
and homework is eating up most of my free time.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I finished updating my OLL page to reflect the algorithms I <br>
currently use, and I made a few other changes as well.  I&#x27;ve <br>
included all algorithms that I use, included algorithms from other <br>
angles and also any reflections.  I wrote the algorithm for each <br>
case in standard notation, as well as in finger trick notation.  I <br>
tried to make the finger trick notation as detailed as I could to <br>
show exactly what I am doing for each alg.  I include explanations <br>
for weird or longer triggers, as well as all double layer turns and <br>
all cube rotations that I do.<br>
<br>
So if anyone is interested, or is still learning the OLL step, then <br>
my new up-to-date page is at<br>
http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/3-orientations.html<br>
<br>
I am also working on my permutations page to reflect the actual <br>
algorithms that I use now (these pages were out-of-date by over a <br>
year), and also to make the finger trick notation more detailed as I <br>
did for my OLL page.<br>
<br>
For anyone learning the OLL let me know if you like the setup.  I <br>
figured I would try to include every alg, rather than to just <br>
say &quot;learn the alg from other angles&quot; etc..<br>
<br>
Anyway I just wanted to let those who are working on the OLL step <br>
know about this page.<br>

Hi!<br>
<br>
I just recorded a video of myself speedsolving the 5x5x5 cube. The <br>
quality aint all that great, but it&#x27;s ok. Still need to experiment <br>
more with my webcam.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s not the usual pairing-up-edges or 3x3x3-reduction approach. I <br>
use my own method for solving the larger cubes. For those who don&#x27;t <br>
know it the method is roughly like this :<br>
<br>
1)<br>
Do first layer by intuition. Normally i do corners first. Then i try <br>
to get as much as possible for &quot;free&quot;. I don&#x27;t necessarily solve all <br>
centers of first layer at this stage. But i MUST solve the middle <br>
center. When this is done i hold the first solved layer to the left.<br>
<br>
2)<br>
Edges of 3 middle layers (r,M and l layers). First i orient the <br>
layers so that i get as much as i can for free. And i need to solve <br>
the 4 middle centers while doing that! Then the rest of the edges are <br>
done with 3-cycles. I also cycle blocks of edges, either to solve <br>
many edges in one alg, or otherwise to either remove badly placed <br>
edges into last layer, or into better position in the middle layers. <br>
The basic 3-cycle solves only 1 edge. Other 3-cycles could solve 2 or <br>
more at the same time.<br>
<br>
3)<br>
Final layer corners and edges. I do corners first, position then <br>
orient. Then normally i will do the middle edges next. This makes it <br>
easier to spot how to cycle the rest of the edges (more 3-cycles <br>
again). I guess this way of doing last layer is a bit similar to how <br>
Masayuki Akimoto does it with his columns method. Here i can also <br>
cycle blocks of edges. Parity is fixed with a simple inner layer <br>
turn, pluss an edge 3-cycle. This will mess with the centers, but not <br>
all that many are solved yet at this stage.<br>
<br>
4)<br>
Rest of centers. Again i use lots of 3-cycles. Most of them exchange <br>
centers between 2 adjacent faces. I can also cycle blocks of centers. <br>
2x1 blocks or even 3x1 blocks in some cases. I also have some special <br>
algs for exchanging ceneters between opposite faces.<br>
<br>
Now that u have read all of that, here is the link the the video :<br>
<br>
http://vakt.idi.ntnu.no/Per_5x5x5_2_38_9.wmv<br>
<br>
I can&#x27;t guarantee that i won&#x27;t remove it in the near future, or post <br>
it again on a different URL ;-)<br>

Excellent vid, thanks for posting.  It&#x27;s very neat to see the cube 
come together in that order, since it&#x27;s so different from what I&#x27;m 
used to seeing.  Looks pretty efficient too!

Finger tricks are very fast, so fast you can&#x27;t analyze them correctly<br>
on standard videos formats.<br>
<br>
If you use an analog camcorder, here&#x27;s something interesting you can try.<br>
Use odd/even interleaved video fields to double your frame rate, as it<br>
is explained on this (wonderful) page: http://www.100fps.com/<br>
You get 50Hz (=PAL*2), or 60 Hz (=NTSC*2).<br>
<br>
With my slow modem and small web space, I can&#x27;t show you the<br>
difference, but believe me, for a speedcubing video, it changes<br>
everything!<br>

You could take off the stickers and put them back on solved, I guess,
but I can&#x27;t guarantee you they would stick on afterwards. You&#x27;d
probably be better off just popping out the offending pieces and
putting them back in right. Then again, I can&#x27;t guarantee you that
that would work smoothly either, since I don&#x27;t know what kind of cube
it is, but I reckon the odds for breaking the cube are fairly small.

Hi Chris, thanks fot the update. Hmm, actually I wasn&#x27;t even aware you <br>
had described your 3x3 algs ;-)<br>
<br>
Comments:<br>
<br>
38A) Do you mean the BLU corner before or after the (L&#x27;) turn? I find <br>
it easier to hit the FLU so that it lands at BLU, than to hit BLU (so <br>
that it lands at BLD).<br>
<br>
38B) I also pull the last turn with the ring finger, but I use the <br>
other hand. Ever tried that? I love it. I also think there are <br>
mistakes. What I&#x27;d write is: &quot;Do the first trigger like (R&#x27; U&#x27;) (R U&#x27;) <br>
triggering the first U&#x27; with your left index finger. Do the (R&#x27; U2 R) <br>
as (R&#x27; U2 R) triggering the (R) with your right ring finger.<br>
<br>
13) Try this one: Left thumb on D center, right thumb on F of FR edge, <br>
middle finger on opposite stickers. Then do (l&#x27; U r&#x27; U&#x27; [lR] [Ud]&#x27;). <br>
The [..] means at the same time. Do the [Ud]&#x27; using your left index <br>
finger to push the UFL corner to UFR. Now regrip with right hand only <br>
and do (l&#x27; U l F&#x27;).<br>
<br>
General) To make it even clearer how you execute algs, add a &quot;&#x27;&quot; to <br>
double turns as well, e.g. &quot;U2&#x27;&quot;.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

Hi Per,

really nice video, though I&#x27;d prefer to look over your shoulders and 
also listen (or does it have sound and it&#x27;s just me?). And you made me 
realize I usually don&#x27;t think of the possibility to 3cycle blocks, 
only single pieces. How could I be so blind? Maybe that was influenced 
by blindfold solving, since it&#x27;s easier to work with smaller changes. 
And in speedsolving I don&#x27;t solve using this kind of 3cycles...

Cheers!
Stefan

Hey Gilles!

I&#x27;m still a newbie when it comes to recording/editing movies. I 
didn&#x27;t even add an intro (or outro) to my vid. And no captions 
whatsoever. I think it was u Gilles mentioning that i could add a 
clock in a few secs with Vegas Video? How do i do that? Do i actually 
need to make a screen capture of a clock and overlay it? Or can i add 
the clock by &quot;scripting&quot; ?

And by the way my 5x5x5 video was recorded using my webcam, Logitech 
Pro 4000. Can i play that framegame with that camera? It will record 
in raw uncompressed avi format. I then use a simple free program to 
convert to wmv, any bitrate that i like. I also have Virtual Dub that 
i use mostly for joining avi or repairing files.

Cheers!!

-Per

PS! I have a 33 move solution to this weeks FMC. Hope to cut it down 
by more clever insertions ;-)

I took the cube apart and tried to put it together solved and go
figure there were three cubies with the stickers moved on them. I
guess the person that sold it on eBay thought it would be funny. 
I guess for $1.99 what do you expect - on a side note it also came
with The Simple Solution To Rubik&#x27;s Cube written by James G. Nourse.
Which sells for over $4 on eBay ;-)

Hmmm ... u ARE supposed to be blind when u solve blindfold ... <br>
hehe ... just a joke ;-)<br>
<br>
Well anyway, cycling blocks is efficient. But it takes a while to get <br>
used to. And u need to know how to set up a generic 3-cycle and/or <br>
practice many variations. But if u know that stuff inside/out, so to <br>
speak, u can plan move cancellations quite easily also ;-)<br>

I&#x27;m not really sure how to explain it, but when it has happened to me, I
was able to get the last piece back in by turning one of the faces about
80 degrees, wedging in the last piece, and then moving the last face
back to the solved state while forcing in the last piece.

Nah, that&#x27;s just a news report about Dan during the Championships.
Someone was making an actual full-length documentary about the RWC,
and I thought it was due to be released last summer. I&#x27;ve also been
wondering about it.

Ten days ago I was so naive... Newbies like me should be made to wait
a week or two before they post :-)

I made a nice little 3 step solution to the 2x2 that is modified from
Blake O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s Simple Solution:

http://ozor.homeip.net/cube/MO-Cube-2x2.pdf

It&#x27;s a pretty slow solution. I only average around 70 secs to solve
with method but could probably get under 60 with a little more
practice. Step 2 is the real killer sometimes taking three to four
repeats of the algorithm. 

Here is the cheat sheat that I made modified from Blake O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s 3x3
solution:

http://ozor.homeip.net/cube/MO-Cube-3x3.pdf

Going to master Blakes solution (
http://www.nerdparadise.com/puzzles/333/ ) then step up to Fridrich.

Any ideas or corrections welcomed... Thanks again Matt Ozor

Its been awhile since i&#x27;ve posted here, but yeah, i figured i&#x27;d share <br>
a link to my deviant art gallery.  On it is a lot of cube stuff so <br>
check it out.  Be sure to watch the lava lamp!<br>

I don&#x27;t know how many people are interested,<br>
but we had an exciting 2 man competition at lunch today<br>
at Temecula Valley High School (California).<br>
<br>
As we have done for seven weeks in a row, we did an average of five <br>
under tournament conditions (computer scrambles, stackmat, 15 <br>
seconds inspection, etc.)<br>
<br>
Ryan Patricio  26.55 (66.79) (23.89) 24.30 33.82=average of 28.22<br>
Martin Singsen (26.14) 32.49 34.24 (40.18) 36.22 =average 0f 34.32<br>
<br>
The averages and best times for both cubists are their best <br>
performances in our competitions...and the two best performances in<br>
Temecula Valley Cube History...<br>
<br>
If you are interesting in our competition results, check out the <br>
tvhsrubiks group and look for the latest file, it contains all of <br>
the historical data...we have 5 people under 49.04 so far this year.<br>

I happened to be in London last week and took the opportunity to 
visit SevenTowns and Dave. He showed me an embryo (traier-like) of a 
documentary which was a few minutes long showing a lot of Dan and 
some parts of the first day. Dave is pushing them do finish the full 
documentary, but apparantly not successfully, yet.

What he showed me was the work of the Canadian documetary team.

No, not the cube. You use the cube core. The innermost, central cubie 
of the 27. I think you&#x27;d have trouble defining the &quot;cube&quot; as a 
reference, I doubt that would even work. And since you *chose* the 
core cubie, it must be allowed to ask why you didn&#x27;t simply chose the 
UFR corner. Or any other cubie.

See, I just don&#x27;t see the core cubie as special. That&#x27;s why I have no 
problem turning it.

Call it a &quot;brain trick&quot; and I&#x27;m ok with it. Not fine (cause I don&#x27;t 
see the &quot;trick&quot;), but ok. It&#x27;s *not* a finger trick, since I execute 
it that way to make it easier for my brain, *not* my fingers.

For scrambling the clock, I&#x27;d use the one on Jaap&#x27;s Page 
(http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/clockscramble.htm)

As for the pyraminx, I wrote a scrambler a while back. It&#x27;s in the 
files section under &quot;puzzle_scrambler.pl&quot;, although the user 
interface leaves a lot to be desired. I only point to it because I 
don&#x27;t know of another one. I have an HTML form system for the 
program, but currently lack a server to run it on. It&#x27;s a horrid 
program anyway, but if you want, I can send you the file and more 
specific instructions for use.

Also, in terms of pyraminx scrambling, there&#x27;s a question I&#x27;ve had 
for a while that I can&#x27;t seem to find an answer to, so I&#x27;ll ask the 
group: How many of the tips must you scramble on the pyraminx? 
Should it always be 4? A number between 1 and 4? I notice now, 
looking at the WCA regulations 
(http://www.speedcubing.com/events/regulations.html) that there are 
even set programs for the cubes, the Megaminx, Clock, and Square-1, 
but the Pyraminx is off the list completely. What should the 
regulation (for the program and for number of tips) be?

   Nope. You are mistaken. This came up elsewhere about how to count
cube positions.

   The &quot;cube core&quot; is the same thing as the &quot;cube itself.&quot; If you have
a solved cube in your hands, and you rotate only the whole cube you
can have 24 different *points of view.* These are *not* &quot;positions&quot; in
the sense of &quot;some 43 quintillion different positions&quot; of the cube.  
     If you notice, the center &quot;cubies&quot; rotate in place.

   Because there is a difference between changing the cube and
changing how you look at it.

   OK.

   The distinction I was making was counting the movement of one layer
as the simplest consideration for notation, as opposed to considering
a two-layer movement as one counted move.

Ah, great. If someone could fill me in on the notation on the notation
used on Jaap&#x27;s scambler it would be even greater.

The Pyraminx scrambler worked like a charm and there is no need for
further files. If you want to host it though I could probably provide
some space for you (free of course). Just let me know.

In my opinion each tip should be scrambled a random number of times
which would mean that an average of 3 tips would be scrambled (one
already solved on average).

There are three scrambles on each page, arranged in columns. Each time
there is a button pattern given by d&#x27;s and U&#x27;s, meaning down (pressed)
and up (not pressed). Next to it says u=&lt;number>, which means you have
to turn one of the corner clocks next to a U button forward that
number of hours. A negative number turn move the clock backwards (i.e.
-1 means turn back one step). Zero obviously means you do nothing. The
same goes for any line d=&lt;number>, where you turn any corner clock
next to a pressed button.

When you have reached the bottom, you will have done up to 14 random
turns. It gives a random button pattern if you like that kind of
thing, and then the current clock position of the front and the back.

Reload the page for new scrambles. 

One day I&#x27;ll get around to making this program more obvious to use.

Jaap

Hey,<br>
<br>
I just got my brand new 5x5 cube. I have tried solving it a few times<br>
and found that what I know from the 4x4 is transferable in about half<br>
the cases. The other times I run into two peculiar situations when<br>
pairing (tripling?) up the last one or two edge groups. What happens<br>
is this:<br>
<br>
All edge groups match up fine except for the last one, where the two<br>
outer edges are flipped differently from the inner one. I have no idea<br>
how to fix this one. Help?<br>
<br>
All edges groups match up fine except for the last two where the two<br>
middle edges need to be swapped between them. I can use an alg from<br>
Stefans site to fix this, but it preserves a bit more than I need, and<br>
I wonder if there isn&#x27;t a shorter alg somewhere.<br>
<br>
I am guessing both cases are related and caused by indistinguishable<br>
centers and bad permutations of them.<br>
<br>
There seems to be very little on the net for this cube. A shame really.<br>
<br>
So, can anyone give me any hints on the above two cases?<br>

believe Frederic Badie posted some useful algs in this group 
previously. I don&#x27;t run into those cases cause i don&#x27;t use that 
method ;-) Maybe u can post some diagrams to make it easier to 
understand excactly what u are after? :D

-Per

PS! Yes whatever method u adopt there isn&#x27;t too mucg difference btw 
4x4x4 and 5x5x5 or any larger nxnxn cube. For larger n u get many 
individual parities. I can explain those parities with a diagram.

Thanks. It was pretty clear and I should have been able to figure it
out, but I&#x27;m new to the clock (I actually solved it for the first time
today).

Thanks for the scrambler and the help.

The case that is troubling me the most (no. 1) is illustrated here:

http://www.stud.ntnu.no/~eivindfo/case.jpg

All centers are solved and all other edge groups are matched up.

I&#x27;d use the 4x4x4 algorithm for edge parity (such as r&#x27; U2 l F2 l&#x27; 
F2 r2 U2 r U2 r&#x27; U2 F2 r2 F2 from Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s page). I tried 
that one out and it seems to work without disturbing the centers.

Hey Eivind,

That case is similar with the case on the 4x4x4 where one edge group 
is &#x27;flipped&#x27; (like a mono-edge-flip on a 3x3). You can probably 
solve it with the same alg. I use: (R ² r ²) B ² U ² (L l) U ² (R&#x27; 
r &#x27;) U ² (R r) U ² F ² (R r) F ² (L &#x27; l &#x27;) B ² (R ² r ²) (from Chris 
Hardwicks website).

Also, how do you disassemble this maniacal thing? I just broke an

Hey Eivind!

Take it apart approx like u would on a 3x3x3 cube. Turn top layer 
about 45 degrees. Then use a knife or something to lift one &quot;outer 
edge&quot; out. It could be that this can only be done while lifting out 
the 2 other edges of that &quot;triplet&quot;. It depends how loose ur cube is 
or isn&#x27;t ;-) First few times it feels rough disassembling it :-0

As for gluing that x-center, make sure u glue it a proper angle so 
that it won&#x27;t be too tight. Make sure that an outer edge will slide 
easily in between the head and base of that center, on both sides ;-) 
Make sure of this before the superglue dries, so u need be a little 
fast ... With my UHU superglue it will be strong and durable after 
about 1/2 day. Probably less, but im a chicken ... lol ... Use enough 
glue so that the gluing looks a bit like welding on a bike frame. 
remove excess glue with a sharp knife or sandpaper. If u don&#x27;t remove 
this excess glue u will find that the x-center wants to rotate as u 
slide inner layers :-( Too little glue and the joint might be brittle.

Good luck !!

Nope, *you* are mistaken. Ever scrambled or solved the cube core? I 
certainly haven&#x27;t. But I&#x27;ve done that with the cube numerous times. 
Your argument of rotating a solved cube only applies to the *solved* 
cube. It&#x27;s not applicable when we&#x27;re talking about making turns.

Thanks for the extensive lecture on gluing, Per, but I managed to fix
it without taking it apart =). So I&#x27;ll keep the first disassemble
until it&#x27;s a lot looser, when I can pop that piece out without it
feeling like I need a weapon of some kind, lol. =)

   If you take a regular Rubik&#x27;s cube apart and remove all the edge
and corner cubies, thus leaving only the core, you will find that you
*cannot* scramble the core.

> But I&#x27;ve done that with the cube numerous times. 

   You need to specify what you mean, because when you scramble the
cube you still cannot scramble the core.

   We seem to be at cross purposes. I am talking about one thing and
you are talking about another. I am talking about how to count &quot;moving
a slice plus a side.&quot;
   Consider the three layers L, R and the slice between them, and
forget about how they are in your hands. Where you say you are turning
R and that slice together, I am saying it is the same as turning L. If
you consider the cube in space with no other reference, then what
moves *is* L.

David J

You can try www.rubiks.dk .. although a lot of the moves are quite
awkward I feel. In the very end I suggest just reading algs on
notation form and develop your own finger tricks for them.

In one case, yes. In the other, R and the middle slice are moved.

I can easily describe the effects of a move when I use the core cubie 
as a reference. I just need to say where the other 26 cubies are 
before and after the move, *relative* to the core cubie. Now I want to 
see how you do that when your reference is &quot;the cube&quot;. I bet you 
can&#x27;t.

Well, I &#x27;know&#x27; somebody with more than 20 years of cubing 
experience, who uses vaseline, so I don&#x27;t think it will kill your 
cube. (I don&#x27;t really know him, but I have met him twice: Guus 
Razoux Schultz). However, most speedcubers use silicone spray. I 
guess you could try both to see what you like more.

Joel.

  I was watching some King of the Hill on the FX thanksgiving day <br>

8 (I looked it up, aired around 4:30PM Central time).  I can&#x27;t find <br>
the sound bite, or even the quote anywhere.<br>
  If memory serves, it went something like this &quot;...like a dangoll <br>
rubik&#x27;s cube man, you twist it and get one side and the dangoll other <br>
side messed up...&quot;<br>

It&#x27;s bugging me that I can&#x27;t find any acknowledgement of the quotes <br>

I used it (many years ago) on an original Rubik&#x27;s cube, and more 
recently on a Square-1.  Both puzzles wore out quickly (though other 
lubricants were tried on the cube, so can&#x27;t be sure that Vaseline 
caused the problem in that case).  I use silicone now -- it is cheap 
enough, and you don&#x27;t need to use much: one tube has lasted me 2-3 
years so far.

wow!!! your really a good solver, 16 seconds, that was fast!!!, can you teach me some moves, cause i wanna be as fast as you, but, how can i be that fast when my best time is only 52.48 seconds, i was wondering if you ever passed through the 1st layer, 2nd layer and 3rd???, cause it seems like your moves are like shitaro makisumi&#x27;s or chris hardwick&#x27;s..........<br>

Well, he probably moves (almost) as as guy&#x27;s like Shotaro or Chris 
Hardwick, but his moves are very different because he uses a method 
that is essentially different.

If you want to get really fast, it will take you a lot of time and 
practice. A good place to start would be Jessica Fridrich&#x27;s website 
(http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html). I would not 
recommend learning alg&#x27;s directly from her website, though, because 
I think it&#x27;s a bit hard to customize them to your own hands. 
http://www.speedcubing.com/peter/ Has some pretty good and &#x27;user 
friendly&#x27; algorithms.

Don&#x27;t get scared when you see all these hundreds of algorithms, by 
the way. Just go one step at a time. First learn a simple beginners 
solution (you already know it), then slowly expand you solution with 
more and more algs. For example, I started with a solution that uses 
5 algs. Then I learned a 4 look last layer. (probably about 3 extra 
algs). Then I learned Fridrich first two-layers. After that I 
learned a 3 look last layer (etc.).

Other advice: Don&#x27;t ever try to achieve anything because you want to 
feel good about yourself, or something... Only start memorizing 
these algs when you really enjoy it :).

If you have any more questions, you can ask here, or send me an e-

Hi guys,<br>
<br>
I am just about to dislike this discussion. It is still about<br>
the same thing.<br>
So I felt I should post some words here that many people can<br>
ignore...<br>
David, you have simply sticked to YOUR mental model of the cube<br>
and cannot understand that it is not the only one possible<br>
(or the best one because the cube mechanism is accidentaly<br>
close to it).<br>
You can understand (maybe not you, but someone else can :))<br>
3x3x3 cube as an extension of 2x2x2 in several ways.<br>
either adding 3 middle layers or adding 3 outer layers.<br>
2x2x2 has one corner used as a reference (original mechanism,<br>
not the Eastsheen one).<br>
Using fixed corner is just another model of handling the cube.<br>
Somebody even do not thing about cubies, but about stickers<br>
and colors (some blindfolded cubers do).<br>
I have programmed many cube related programs and handling of the<br>
cube (the actual model) is important and there is no best way.<br>
E.g. in ACube the fixed core is used, however, if I used fixed<br>
corner, I could make corner table more efficient, because<br>
I could combine corner permutation and orientation into one number.<br>
In addition, new number &quot;core&quot; with 24 states would appear and<br>
it could be combined with other numbers....<br>
In this case the double-layer turns are elementary...<br>
<br>
For corner-first people cube core is really not any reference.<br>
(when solving corners, the core is ignored and afterwards,<br>
the solved corners are used as a reference where all the edges<br>
and centers should be placed). For these purposes, replacing<br>
double-layer turns by single-layer turn + cube rotation<br>
as well as replacing slice turns by 2 face turns + cube rotation<br>
is not compatible with the model used in this case....<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with finger tricks at all...<br>
<br>
Try to be more open to accept model of other people.<br>
Btw. reality as you understand it is just another model that<br>
your brain constructed. It may be far away from the models of<br>
other people....<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
<br>
Josef<br>
 <br>
&gt; &gt;    If you take a regular Rubik&#x27;s cube apart and remove all the <br>
edge<br>
&gt; &gt; and corner cubies, thus leaving only the core, you will find <br>
that <br>
&gt; you<br>
&gt; &gt; *cannot* scramble the core.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Thanks for agreeing with me.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But I&#x27;ve done that with the cube numerous times. <br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt;    You need to specify what you mean, because when you scramble <br>
the<br>
&gt; &gt; cube you still cannot scramble the core.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Thanks for agreeing with me.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt;    Consider the three layers L, R and the slice between them, and<br>
&gt; &gt; forget about how they are in your hands. Where you say you are <br>
&gt; turning<br>
&gt; &gt; R and that slice together, I am saying it is the same as turning <br>
L. <br>
&gt; If<br>
&gt; &gt; you consider the cube in space with no other reference, then what<br>
&gt; &gt; moves *is* L.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In one case, yes. In the other, R and the middle slice are moved.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I can easily describe the effects of a move when I use the core <br>
cubie <br>
&gt; as a reference. I just need to say where the other 26 cubies are <br>
&gt; before and after the move, *relative* to the core cubie. Now I <br>
want to <br>
&gt; see how you do that when your reference is &quot;the cube&quot;. I bet you <br>
&gt; can&#x27;t.<br>

Hi,<br>
<br>
vaseline is not really good if you want your cube last long.<br>
However, it can be really useful if you want to make your cube<br>
much smoother.<br>
Since petroleum-based lubricants dissolves cube plastic,<br>
it can help to break in faster. Also in the begining<br>
the cube feels to be easier to move (is less noisy and<br>
more smooth). As soon as your cube is smooth enough,<br>
clean the cube from vaseline and use silicone oil.<br>
It should be then even easier to move....<br>
<br>
I have the experience because I got some (about 10) old<br>
original cubes from a plastic-recycling company.<br>
All were about 20 years old... Even if there was vaseline<br>
inside, cubes were not destroyed, but were much looser...<br>
But also were smoother than the other ones...<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
<br>
Josef<br>
<br>
&gt; Does any one know if Vaseline is a bad lubricant for the Rubik&#x27;s <br>
&gt; cube and if it will cause the plastic to deteriorate?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Joel that was some good advice for a beginner like
myself. Seeing 100+ algorithms is very overwhelming at
first. Learning a simple solution then expanding apon
it makes great sense. For myself solving the F2L
almost comes naturally, after you learn a few basic
moves. So now if I&#x27;ll just start incorporating
Fridrich and hopefully in a &quot;YEAR&quot; I&#x27;ll be
&quot;speed-solving&quot;.

Hi Josef, (and Stefan)

   Yeah, I&#x27;ve been making the mistake of thinking that I had to keep
clarifying what I meant. You guys seem to view this as being
argumentative. 

   Up to now I&#x27;ve been thinking that I&#x27;m terrible at expressing
myself, but now I conclude that you guys don&#x27;t understand English very
well.

> David, you have simply sticked to YOUR mental model of the cube

   You are wrong in both cases. You have missed the context of my posts.

   The context of what I&#x27;ve been writing here is about *the simplest*
description of moves. While I am well aware that a movement of one
side can be described as a movement of the other side and the middle
slice together, that description is *not* the simplest.

> (or the best one because the cube mechanism is accidentaly
> close to it). 

   I am not saying that anyone else&#x27;s model is wrong. Nor am I unable
to understand other&#x27;s models. 

   My notation isn&#x27;t &quot;accidentally&quot; close to the cube&#x27;s mechanism. And
I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the best. 

   This whole thing started with lots of people complaining about the
confusion caused by having multiple models of notation. I suggested
going with the simplest notation, and making a distinction about
finger tricks. I was trying to help the community reach a consensus
and have a single notation. If the community doesn&#x27;t want a consensus
that&#x27;s fine with me.

   This reminds me of the conversation with the math expert who
doesn&#x27;t know that a point on a line is infinitely thin and that there
can be an infinite number of points on any line. So a line from zero
to one can be used to represent an infinite quantity. (See post 8118)

   Using a fixed corner is also the main model for counting different
positions in the 2x2x2.

   You have clouded the situation more: if you look at a picture of a
person you can&#x27;t invert picture and say it&#x27;s a different person - yet
you just did the equivalent with the 2x2x2 in your example, and Stefan
did it with the 3x3x3.

   I am aware of using different references, corners as reference or
centers as reference, and that how a person thinks of the cube can
vary. I have no problem with that. In fact I took the pains to make it
clear that I understood it, I guess you missed that it was part of
what I was saying. No, I&#x27;ll come out and say it: you totally missed
the point of what I was saying.

   But you have to solve the corners to have them be the main
reference, you don&#x27;t need to solve the centers in order to make them
the main reference.

   Exactly.

   You are mixed up - trying to tell me what I&#x27;ve been trying to tell
Stefan. I introduced this idea early on. I gave that example in part
to make the point that an alg can be described differently for
different purposes. 
 
> It has nothing to do with finger tricks at all...

   It has to do with how you look at the cube. Fully half of what I&#x27;ve
been talking about is *making this distinction!*

   In terms of notation, one part of finger tricks is the position of
the cube in your hands, i.e. how you are looking at it. There is a
diffence between the simplest expression and expressing the same thing
from some other points of view. I lumped it under finger tricks
because others do. 

   To repeat: this &quot;other point of view&quot; you are trying to tell me
about was the argument I presented at first.

And Stefan,

   But, for what the fourth time, &quot;R and the middle slice&quot; together
are *not* part the simplest notation.

   I already did. Why don&#x27;t you learn to read and understand English
correctly?

   Nevermind. You all are too sure of what I mean regardless of what I
mean.

That&#x27;s a question I remember I was looking forward to reading an 
answer for... I guess he was, too, and maybe that&#x27;s why he didn&#x27;t 
continue the discussion when you didn&#x27;t answer...

I recently have taken the liberty of deleting a few posts, and there <br>

Hi,
if you look at: http://software.rubikscube.info/AnimCube/
it is used as an example (in several variations).

U should go back to the site were u downloaded the chat client

Hi Stefan,

   I did answer and that post is still in the archives. I&#x27;ve no idea
why he didn&#x27;t continue.

Hmm ...

Maybe he didn&#x27;t continue cause it&#x27;s not really a fruitful 
discussion. It&#x27;s a bit like Kant&#x27;s ideas about whether the world 
exists objectively outside ourselves or subjectively only inside our 
brain. And the answer is of coz both. Depends on ur perspective.

Actually I didn&#x27;t see it - can you point me roughly to where you
replied. I searched for Riemann Hypothesis and it only found 3
messages (all recent) - search used to be better than this. I then
went back to the previous batch but still haven&#x27;t seen it, so if you
can point me to a message number I shall try to read it and reply.

Hi,

I&#x27;ve just mailed the results to Ron, so they might appear on
speedcubing.com in the near future.

The results are actually complete since we sadly didn&#x27;t have the time
to finish the rest of the events. We we obviously a bit optimistic but
we hope to fit in thise events at another competition.

Found your post. Looks like it was posted at around the time I was in
the US at the start of the year, so I missed it. Since I&#x27;m off to
China on holiday on Tuesday  I&#x27;d better try to reply right now.

It&#x27;s been a while now but as I recall, from scanning the emails, you
were wanting to look at densities of primes by (effectively) looking
at the density of non-primes (and subtracting from 1 if you want to
get the densitiy of primes).
Thus you were looking at 1/2+1/3-1/6 etc. I will agree with you that
you can define density so that 1/2 of the numbers beyond a particular
point are divisible by 2 and 1/3 are divisible by 3 so that
1/2+1/3-1/6=2/3 are divisible by either 2 or 3.
There&#x27;s a bit of a problem though in proceeding like this. The sum you
get is not absolutely convergent so the order in which you add the
terms is important. This is a strange property of infinite series
which people may or may not be aware of - if the series you are adding
up is conditionally but not absolutely convergent then if you add up
the terms in a different order you can get different answers. In fact,
by appropriately ordering the terms you can get any limit you want or
you can get divergence etc.
(By the way, at this point it might be as well to add that the
recurring number 0.9999.... does equal 1, in respect of the end of
your post, as can be seen by the definition of 0.999... which is the
sum of an absolutely convergent series).
One problem with 1/2+1/3-1/6 is that the -1/6 corrects for multiples
of 6 (that have already been accounted for in the overlap of
accounting for 2 and then 3) but by the time you need to account for
multiples of 6 you should already have accounted for multiples of 5.
i.e. 1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6.
It would seem that it is the limit (if it exists, which it should) of
f(x) where f(x) is defined as the sum of -[(-1)^s(y)]/y where 1&lt;y&lt;=x
is square free and s(y) is the number of prime factors of y. (Summed
over increasing y)
In other words, f(2)=1/2 and if x+1 is not square-free then
f(x+1)=f(x) and otherwise f(x+1)is either f(x)+1/(x+1) or f(x)-1/(x+1)
according as x+1 is a product of an odd or even number of primes. The
limit of this sum should then be the density of non-primes.
Thus the partial sums would look like:
f(2)=1/2
f(3)=1/2+1/3
f(4)=1/2+1/3
f(5)=1/2+1/3+1/5
f(6)=1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6
f(7)=1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6+1/7
f(8)=1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6+1/7
f(9)1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6+1/7
f(10)=1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6-1/10

Of course, this isn&#x27;t really the true density either, but - and I&#x27;ve
not really thought about this - presumably in the limit it should
become 1, since in the limit pi(x)/x tends to 0. The true density of
non-primes, up to x, would be 1-pi(x)/x (where pi(x) is the number of
primes less than or equal to x).
There are various asymptotics for pi(x)/x (as given by the Prime
Number Theorem) for example. The Riemann Hypothesis provides for
better asymptotics (if it is true).

Zeno&#x27;s paradox is only a paradox because at the time of Zeno, limits
were not well-defined. In the example of the arrow, one can also say
that the arrow takes half as much time for each step and conclude that
time never passes. (If we could reach a point in the future, we&#x27;d have
to get half way there, then half of the remaining time etc., so we&#x27;d
conclude that time never passes and of course then we couldn&#x27;t have
shot an arrow to begin with!)
The fact is that there is a number, namely 1, to which the partial
sums in the Zeno example become arbitrarily close provided you take
sufficiently many terms. Such a number is defined to be a limit of the
sequence - I&#x27;ve been a bit loose in my language here but the precise
definitions are well known. Further more, because the real numbers are
endowed with a Hausdorff topological structure (even a metric space
structure) this limit is unique and we can well-define
1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16+...=1 (and similarly
1/10+1/100+1/1000+1/10000+...=1/9 etc.).

Basically, in looking at things concerned with infinite series you
have to be extra careful - not that I&#x27;ve been too careful in this
email (I&#x27;ve not examined the series
1/2+1/3+1/5-1/6+1/7-1/10+1/11+1/13-1/14-1/15+1/17+1/19-1/21-1/22+...
for convergence for example). My complaint about 1/2+1/3-1/6 etc. is
that it is not immediately obvious that this will converge and, if it
does, that it will converge to the correct answer. I presume that this
would continue 1/2+1/3-1/6+1/5-1/10-1/15+1/30+... and more generally,
after +1/p the next terms would correct in some way (whether ordered
by denomiator or by number of factors in the denominator and then by
denominator is not clear).
Whether the sum I gave will converge (and if it does, to the correct
answer) is also something to question. I&#x27;ve not checked it, as I
mentione above, but it does seem to me that it would be a more
anatural order. Even so, it&#x27;s not the correct formula for the partial
densities either - but the whole point is that pi(x) isn&#x27;t easy to
approximate, without using something like the prime number theorem, 
anyway.

Hey all,<br>
   I&#x27;m looking for a program for a 5x5 cube that I can download.  <br>
Anyone know of any program that you can enter in the colors that you <br>
have on your cube and it will spit out an algorithm that can be used <br>
to solve it?  I know how to solve the entire cube, but I can&#x27;t <br>
remember the algorithm to swap two same color edge cubies in the <br>
bottom layer once the rest of them have been oriented and permuted.  <br>
Any help would be much appreciated!<br>

Hi everyone,<br>

I was trying to find if there was a table somewhere that someone <br>

one...  <br>
But like, how Lars V. calculated the possiblities of the number of <br>
moves in forming the cross for the Frdirich method, is kind of what <br>
I&#x27;m looking for, or trying to figure out how to find (for Petrus <br>

          <div class="email-content">It depends what you mean. If you&#x27;re solving for speed, you&#x27;ll use more <br>
moves than if you think about every step.<br>
<br>
If you mean the average for a perfect solution treating each step in <br>
isolation, I would guess it&#x27;s something like this:<br>
<br>
S1: 5-6<br>
S2: 5 or so<br>
S3: 5<br>
S4: Hardest to say... 10-12 maybe<br>
<br>
If you&#x27;re doing the final layer strictly as the individual steps I <br>
think you&#x27;ll get S5: 6, S6: 9, S7: 9<br>
<br>
That adds up to about 50. I expect anyone who does it seriously to <br>
learn more than those simple steps, and you&#x27;ll get fewer moves the <br>
better you get. In my new final layer approach I get under 15 moves for <br>
the final layer, which would give you 41.<br>
<br>
An other sample is my 13 solutions on my example page which had these <br>
averages:<br>
<br>
     * S1+S2: 10.2 turns<br>
     * S3: 5.6 turns<br>
     * S4: 11.3 turns<br>
     * S5-7: 15.4 turns<br>
     * Total: 42.5 turns<br>
<br>
This method is much less explored than Fridrich, so there isn&#x27;t nearly <br>
as much info around.<br>

Originally I had the idea of a 4x4 &quot;2-generator&quot; in order to solve the <br>
parity problems fast. Well, haven&#x27;t gotten anywhere with it, but last <br>
night I tried just for fun to completely scramble and then solve the <br>
4x4, only using UuRr (well, also u&#x27; etc of course). My first time I <br>
didn&#x27;t have a plan and went this way:<br>
<br>
1) solved centers first somehow intuitively<br>
2) then solved the corners like 3x3 2-gen, then solved edges using <br>
lots of 3-cycle-commutators (uuugly, using up to 8 setup moves or so)<br>
3) I had the damn parity problem, set up the last edge 4-cycle pieces <br>
into the r slice, did an r turn, then undid the setup moves<br>
4) fixed the centers of the r slice with several (again ugly) <br>
3-cycle-commutators<br>
<br>
Woo, that was painful, especially the long setup moves and undoing <br>
them. Overall my time was 36:33.36. Then I changed the method <br>
completely and my record after several improvements and some practice <br>
now is 2:20.35. If I can improve by another factor like that, I&#x27;ll use <br>
this as my standard 4x4 method ;-)<br>
<br>
Go try it, it&#x27;s fun and it&#x27;s a free puzzle if you already have a 4x4 <br>
cube ;-)<br>

Told ya.

2:44.96p 2:42.17 (3:24.32)p 1:59.39 2:47.13p 2:10.10 2:18.81 2:33.46p 
2:35.83p (1:42.57) 2:44.84p 2:16.77

Average-of-10 = 2:29.35

The &#x27;p&#x27; means parity problem, i.e. odd permutation of edges (not edge 
pairs) after solving the centers. Takes me about 20-25s to fix...

Challengers?

          <div class="email-content">Hey Everyone,

So back in August, Animal Planet came to film at Caltech for some 
cubing thing.  Looks like that thin will air on March 8, 2005 so check 
out Discovery Channel on that date!  Just to warn you, I was nervous 
beyond belief and when they had me solve the cube, I did it twice and 
had a 29 second and a 27 second solve... yeah, I know, I suck.  So 
don&#x27;t laugh too hard.

Don&#x27;t know whether this might be useful in some method, but maybe <br>
someone will like the alg anyway:<br>
<br>
R2 (Uu)2 (Rr) U2 (Rr)2 U&#x27; (Rr)2 D2 l D2 (Rr)2 U (Rr)2 U2 (Rr)&#x27; (Uu)2 <br>
R2<br>
<br>
Look at the l slice at the point of the l move, notice the pattern of <br>
the center pieces in the l slice. That was the intention, and I just <br>
searched for a short way to reach it. Also l2 and l&#x27; can be used <br>
instead of l of course. If you leave away the R2 at start and end, <br>
you&#x27;ll see the alg I originally constructed. But the one above has a <br>
nicer result :)<br>

Also, since my construction &quot;(Uu)2 (Rr) U2 (Rr)2 U&#x27; (Rr)2 D2&quot; is 
fairly straightforward, I wonder whether there&#x27;s a shorter, maybe not 
so obvious way to reach that center patter in a slice...

Ok, here&#x27;s one that builds the pattern using adjacent centers:

(Ll) U (Rr)&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; (Ll)&#x27; U&#x27;

In HTM it loses 11-7 against the other one I suggested, but in QTM it 
wins 11-12, since it only consists quarter turns. They&#x27;re also quite 
easy to execute and there&#x27;s a repetition (doing (Rr)&#x27;U&#x27; three times).

The above alg builds the pattern in the r slice, so with r as the 
master turn we&#x27;d overall get this alg:

(Ll) U (Rr)&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; (Ll)&#x27; U&#x27;
r
U (Ll) F U (Rr) U (Rr) U (Rr) U&#x27; (Ll)&#x27;

The effect doesn&#x27;t look that nice, but you can for example follow it 
with the also quite easy

[LUL&#x27;U&#x27;,r] = 
(L U L&#x27; U&#x27;) r (U L U&#x27; L&#x27;) r&#x27;

and then altogether we&#x27;ve swapped two edges (not edge pairs).

I&#x27;m still wondering what the shortest possible way is to build that 
center-pattern on a slice. This is the right time for the people to 
speak up who already have 4x4 solvers ;-)

Cheers!
Stefan

Hey Stefan :-)

I think i know how i gonna solve like that one. All my practice w 
commutator solving larges cubes will pay off when i get the hang of 
it. Watch out!! LOL ;-) It&#x27;s a matter of getting practice on the 
required setup moves ;-)

Hey all, its getting kinda slow around here. Anyway, the 2nd<br>

the new standard for speedcubing competitions for timing. I like the<br>

Wow, I haven&#x27;t posted a real message here in a while.

I was thinking that the Mini Mat would be enough as well, but both 
mats costs about the same. The complete timer set is $59.99. The 
timer alone is $50. The Mini-Mat is around $10... It&#x27;s the same 
price for a smaller mat. (What a rip off!)

As for slamming the cube down...I don&#x27;t think the 2nd gen mats are 
up for that kind of abuse. The touchpads are on elevated plastic, so 
if we &quot;slam&quot; our hands onto the timer, it would probably 
hurt...Especially if we catch an edge. At one point, the plastic 
casing will crack. I think 1st gen Stackmats are better for cubing...

That&#x27;s just my opinion.

Hmm, I didn&#x27;t even think about hurting my hands. But you&#x27;re right. But 
I preferred the old ones already anyway.

Hey Per,

I&#x27;d be very happy to see you solve this efficiently with commutators. 
The setup-moves were absolutely killing me!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Jim.

 

The number of &quot;looks&quot; is simply the number of stages you go through to
completing the last layer.

 

A 2-look last layer usually involves first twisting all the pieces so they
are correctly orientated, and then permuting them (putting them all in the
right place). An alternative is orienting and permuting the edges in one
step, and then orienting and permuting the corners. This is also 2-look.

 

3-look means 3-steps are needed, usually twisting the edges, then twisting
the corners, then finally permuting all the pieces.

Hey James,

I think it will be around 56 algs not counting reflections but 
counting inverses.

Counting reflections as well it should be somewhere around 88.

These are just rough estimates, I didn&#x27;t do an very exact count, but 
I tried to get an idea from looking at the different ways to combine 
the 27 corner orientations with the 24 edge permutations and see 
where some of the positiosn were symmetrical.

The number of cases to learn will be less than 100, and the number 
of algs (including inverses and reflections) I&#x27;m pretty sure will 
also be less than 100.  My rough estimates are the numbers above.

Hope that helps some,
Chris

I actually figured this out last summer. Counting all mirrors and inverses I got <br>
44 cases. It doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot but there really aren&#x27;t many edge <br>
permutations for each corner orientation.<br>
<br>
For all corners oriented (Fridrich PLL):<br>
<br>
2 edge cycles<br>
1 zig-zag<br>
1 cross<br>
1 lucky case<br>
<br>
For 2 opposite corners twisted:<br>
<br>
4 cases where 2 adjacent edges need to be exchanged<br>
1 case where 2 oppostie egdes need to be exchanged (this also fixes zig-zag, <br>
but you need to do an extra U after the sequence)<br>
1 case with no edge permutation<br>
<br>
For 2 adjacent corners twisted (x2 for 2 different cases)<br>
<br>
4 cases where 2 adjacent edges need to be exchanged<br>
1 case where 2 oppostie egdes need to be exchanged (this also fixes zig-zag, <br>
but you need to do an extra U after the sequence)<br>
1 case with no edge permutation<br>
<br>
For 3 corners twisted (x2 for CW and CCW)<br>
<br>
4 cases where 2 adjacent edges need to be exchanged<br>
1 case where 2 oppostie egdes need to be exchanged (this also fixes zig-zag, <br>
but you need to do an extra U after the sequence)<br>
1 case with no edge permutation<br>
<br>
For 4 corners twisted (all 4 facing same direction)<br>
<br>
2 cases where 2 adjacent edges need to be exchanged<br>
1 case where 2 oppostie egdes need to be exchanged (this also fixes zig-zag, <br>
but you need to do an extra U after the sequence)<br>
1 case with no edge permutation<br>
<br>
the first one is half b/c the corner orientation is symmetrical both ways, <br>
cancelling 2 of the cases.<br>
<br>
For 4 corners twisted (the other case)<br>
<br>
4 cases where 2 adjacent edges need to be exchanged<br>
1 case where 2 oppostie egdes need to be exchanged (this also fixes zig-zag, <br>
but you need to do an extra U after the sequence)<br>
1 case with no edge permutation<br>
<br>
<br>
Adding this up gives a total of 44 cases (minus the lucky case). It turns out that <br>
these can all be solved using ONLY R, U, and L. So it&#x27;s important to know <br>
right and left handed finger tricks to take advantage of this.<br>
<br>
The move average (based on the sequences I chose to use (Ron&#x27;s solver <br>
found more than one solution in most cases)) is about 11.1 moves.<br>
<br>
Some of the sequences are same as the solutions to some OLL (Fridrich) <br>
cases that affect edge permutation, so you should try some of those out first to <br>
see if you can solve some cases without having to use Ron&#x27;s solver.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t have these 44 cases online but it shouldn&#x27;t take that long to find the <br>
solutions. Allow Ron&#x27;s cube solver to use only R, R&#x27;, R2, L, L&#x27;, L2, U, U&#x27;, and <br>
U2.<br>

So I understand what a commutator is, and I understand how to use <br>
them on corners to do what I want, and I almost understand how to <br>
use them for edges.  But I&#x27;ve recently been playing with my 4x4x4 <br>
and cannot figure out how to get them to do what I want with center <br>
peices, or edges peices, or groups of peices.  Could someone try to <br>
explain this for me?<br>

With the Petrus Method, a three look LL is like this: Permute 
corners, orient corners, permute edges.

Or.

2-look

Orient Edges, Permute All

Hey Evan,

Here&#x27;s a really useful way to think of commutators for the 4x4x4, 
and also for the 3x3x3.

Here is a really useful 3-cycle for the 3x3x3, megaminx, 4x4x4, etc.

Let A=LDL&#x27; B=U

Then ABA&#x27;B&#x27; becomes (LDL&#x27;)U(LD&#x27;L&#x27;)U&#x27;

What this does is to cycle DFL->UFL->UFR

The way to think about how this move works is like this:

The main corner that you are focusing on is the corner at DFL.  You 
are going to place this corner into the spot where it needs to go.  
In the cycle above we see that DFL goes to the UFL spot.  So the 
first thing to do is put your main corner where you want it to go.

Do LDL&#x27;.  Now we have our 2nd corner in the cycle &quot;in limbo&quot; so to 
speak.  If you do the inverse of your alg A you will put the 2nd 
corner piece into the UFL spot.  However, you just placed your main 
corner there, so find your 3rd corner (here UFR) and move it over to 
the spot where you just finished placing a corner (UFL).

Do U.

Now you can place the 2nd corner into the 3rd corner&#x27;s slot by 
undoing A, so do LD&#x27;L&#x27;

Now you have to undo your slice turn B (do U&#x27;), and you have cycled 
the corners how you wanted.

------

Ok, so here is another example but on the 4x4x4.  Lets say we want 
to construct a 3-cycle of edge pieces.  This particular 3-cycle will 
end up being a useful one that you can use later.

You want to cycle uFL->bRU->rUF

It turns out that this cycle is easy to make, using the same concept 
as for the corner 3 cycle above on the 3x3x3.

Call the piece at uFL the &quot;main&quot; piece.  Now call the piece at 
bRU &quot;edge number 1&quot;, and call the piece at rUF &quot;edge number 2&quot;

Notice that the cycle that we want moves the pieces (by name) as 

Main edge -> edge number 1 -> edge number 2

Now put the pieces where they need to go by the names.  So the main 
edge has to go to edge number 1&#x27;s spot.

The alg you use to do this will become your A in ABA&#x27;B&#x27;  For this 
particular example doing R&#x27;u&#x27;R will do this, and it is now our A.

Now your main edge is &quot;in limbo&quot; hanging out bRD.  Notice though 
that doing A&#x27; (R&#x27;uR) will put it into the bUR spot.  So now do a U&#x27; 
turn such that edge number 2 (right now in rUF) ends up in the bUR 
slot.  The setup move you use to move piece #3 into piece #2&#x27;s spot 
becomes the B in ABA&#x27;B&#x27;

Now that edge number 3 is in bUR undo your alg A, so do R&#x27;uR

Now you simply have to undo B by doing U and you&#x27;re done.

So the alg is R&#x27; u&#x27; R U&#x27; R&#x27; u R U

----------------

So to do this in general, do some setup moves to get 2 of the pieces 
in your 3-cycle onto the same slice.  Then get one of the pieces in 
the cycle into a position not on that slice, but in such a way that 
it is easy to put into the slice.

Now move your main piece (the piece not on the slice with the other 
2) into the position of the piece #1 (really the 2nd location in the 
cycle).  Now turn your slice with all the pieces on it such that 
piece #3 ends up where piece #2 just was.  Now undo your alg A and 
then undo your alg B.  Lastly undo your original setup turns.

So, using the alg above that cycles edges, let&#x27;s cycle 3 different 
edges.

We want to cycle bUL->uBL->lUB

Do the setup move LU2 and now your pieces are setup exactly like in 
the previous example, so do the same ABA&#x27;B&#x27; you did there, then undo 
the LU2.

There is actually a faster way to do this cycle using a shorter 
setup move and a slightly different commutator 3-cycle.  However, 
since you know how to form them now, I leave it up to you to figure 
it out :)

The advantage lies in that with having the cross (and thereby most
solved pieces) on the bottom, you can clearly see the top, where the
most unsolved pieces are. This allows you to quickly move on to the
next C/E pair after the previous one because you have been eyeing it
all the time. It also allows you to move on to the LL quite quick
because when you have finished the F2L, the LL is already where it&#x27;s
supposed to be.

It&#x27;s easier to make the switch from top to bottom if you understand
the F2L algoritms rather than blindly applying them. So that&#x27;s my
tips. Make sure you know what is _actually_ happening when you solve
the F2L. Then doing it from a different viewpoint becomes easier, and
after you&#x27;ve done it for two days - natural. :)

This is not shorter but I just wanted to use an inner slice turn for 
the B part of the commutator:
L&#x27; (Dd) (U&#x27; L&#x27; U) l2 (U&#x27; L U) l2 (Dd)&#x27; L

And here&#x27;s a nicer one:
(U R U&#x27;) r&#x27; (U R&#x27; U&#x27;) r

Cheers!

Hi!<br>
<br>
On the matter of UuRr solving which seems to be HOT right now ... <br>
lol ... <br>
<br>
Here is a real short parity fix alg, due to Chris Hardwick :<br>
<br>
R2 (uR2)*5 (edge 4-cycle, real edges not paired &quot;3x3x3&quot; edges)<br>
<br>
If u only want to swap 2 edges u can do the following <br>
modification/extension :<br>
<br>
((Rr)(Uu)&#x27;)*2 [U,R&#x27;u&#x27;R]((Uu)(Rr)&#x27;)*2 (R2u)*5 R2<br>
<br>
A bit longish but reasonably fast ... about 10-11 secs. <br>
<br>
Of coz this alg is useless for the pairing up/3x3x3-reduction <br>
strategy cause it will break paired-up edges. But i&#x27;m sure there are <br>
other modifications to chris&#x27; algorithm that can be used. I&#x27;m afraid <br>
the setuo moves will be a real killer though :-(<br>

You sound just like me about a year ago.  I also learned with the 
cross on top as it mentally does make more sense.  Right now I&#x27;m 
kicking myself because I can clearly see the benefits of having it on 
the bottom.  Not only are the cubies easier to see, but it seems that 
the modified algorithms you use when the cross is on on the bottom 
are also faster and easier to execute.

I&#x27;ve been just recently trying to make the switch from top to bottom 
too and it&#x27;s still causing me to turn the cube all over the place.  
It&#x27;s not as &#x27;natural&#x27; as I&#x27;d like because I got so used to the other 
way for so long.  If you&#x27;re serious about speedcubing, I would ditch 
the cross on top and move to the bottom as soon as you can.  I found 
that having it on the left isn&#x27;t too bad either.

Hey again!

I managed to write down the alg wrongly. Here is the correct version :

((Uu)&#x27;(Rr))*2 [U,R&#x27;u&#x27;R]((Rr)&#x27;(Uu))*2 (R2u)*5 R2

Have fun!!

Yes, everybody&#x27;s talking about it :-)

> Here is a real short parity fix alg, due to Chris Hardwick :
> R2 (uR2)*5 (edge 4-cycle, real edges not paired &quot;3x3x3&quot; edges)

I already use it, but thanks anyway. Here&#x27;s what I do:

- Place the flipped edge pair at BR
- (UuR2)*5
- RURU&#x27; to setup the LFu edge
- (Uu)&#x27; RUR&#x27; (Uu) to solve it
- U&#x27;(Rr)UR&#x27;U&#x27;(Rr)&#x27; to &quot;flip&quot; the LBu edge
- R2 to set it up
- (Uu) R&#x27;U&#x27;R (Uu)&#x27; to solve it
- R&#x27;U&#x27;RU to setup the broken pairs
- (Rr)UR&#x27;U&#x27;(Rr)&#x27;

Overall 39 moves. Sounds bad, but the parts of the algorithm are 
mostly alglets that I use all the time during the solve anyway, so I 
can still do it in around 12-13 seconds now.

I&#x27;ll try to find something with start [(Uu)&#x27;R2]*4.5, that&#x27;s faster for 
me because I can make use of the left hand.

> PS! Or use ACube to find an easier algorithm ...

Is the 4x4 version available? Also, I&#x27;ve asked it before and I think 
both Josef and Jaap said it takes more than 12 moves and their solvers 
aren&#x27;t capable of doing it...

Cheers!
Stefan

Thanks Per, for giving me the motivation to finally search for <br>

Haha, cool, I just noticed that in QTM this even beats the well known 
4x4 &quot;orientation parity&quot; fixers, winning with 24 against 25 moves. Too 
bad it destroys F2L... well, if you could &quot;see&quot; that you have to apply 
a fix with two adjacent F2L pair slots left to do, then you could use 
my alg and fix the white cross with an additional UR2.

Cheers!
Stefan

Hmm, I might like this version better, it&#x27;s just the mirror, i.e. U 
and R swapped:

(Rr)&#x27; U R U
[(Rr)&#x27; U2] * 3
(Rr)2 U R&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr)2
U&#x27; R&#x27; U (Rr)&#x27;

It &quot;feels better&quot; to do (Rr)2 instead of (Uu)2, but only practice will 
tell. If the last (Rr)&#x27; is replaced just by r&#x27;, then the white cross 
even stays intact. 

Cheers!
Stefan

It&#x27;s nice to know that other people struggle with the same bad 
habits!  Someone should start a support group for speedcubers who are 
trying to break 10 or 20 year old habits. 

Maybe someone can enlighten me, but I&#x27;m not quite convinced that 
keeping the orientation of the cube the same all the time is a good 
idea.  I&#x27;ve found that maybe almost 1/3 of the CE pairs I do are 
built when the edge is in the incorrect corner.  (Start the alg on 
one side and finish on the other).  Turning the cube around greatly 
increases the chance of spotting a pair quicker than relying on just 
the top layer.  By turning the cube as you go, you can find pairs 
pretty easy.  

The last layer is always quicker when you tilt or turn the cube to 
run the alg faster. As long as you can spot the next pair, why would 
F2L be any different?

I suppose the ideal would be to know how to run the same F2L algs 
from top, left, bottom, and all corners.  Then it wouldn&#x27;t matter 
where the cross is.

Hello Andy and all others,<br>
<br>
I hope you won&#x27;t mind me adding some comments.<br>
<br>
It turns out that <br>
&gt; these can all be solved using ONLY R, U, and L.<br>
<br>
Actually they can be solved using ONLY R and U (two-generator), and <br>
I think it is much easier to do it that way. I myself use only two-<br>
gen algs with few exceptions.<br>
You might know this, but the two-generator conservs the corners&#x27; <br>
permutation so that all algorithms using R and U can be used or the <br>
purpose of orientating corners and permuting edges. If some of you <br>
don&#x27;t believe it, or don&#x27;t know why it is so, check my demonstration <br>
on my website<br>
<br>
http://www.geocities.com/portoseb/cube/demonstration.html<br>
<br>
I think that this demonstration is the only one existing except for <br>
the computer-generated ones that analysed all possible positions. <br>
They should start giving cube problems in math contests ;)<br>
<br>
Little more about these algs. Knowing the shortest 2-gen alg - the <br>
Sune (7 moves) - one can generate algs consisting of two Sunes, done <br>
one after the other in different positions of course. You can use <br>
the AntiSune too, getting very many positions that can be solved in <br>
a reasonable 14 moves. So actually you don&#x27;t need to learn so many <br>
algs (only if you&#x27;re striving for optimality).<br>
<br>
I think that all these algorithms are listed on Lars Petrus&#x27; page<br>
<br>
http://lar5.com/cube/xMain.html<br>
<br>
There are almost optimal ones too. The truly optimized ones are on <br>
Bernard Helmstetter&#x27;s page<br>

I turn the cube very little (at least less than before :P), yet I
still manage to spot my pairs. Part of this is that I don&#x27;t need to
actually see an edge to know it&#x27;s there. I can deduce it by knowing
that it&#x27;s not anywhere else. It sounds complicated but is actually
quite viable. You don&#x27;t have to actually see everything everytime to
know everything. And another thing is that if you have the choice
between turning the cube and turning a layer, turning a layer is
definintely the fastest. This because in turning the cube you have to
completely reconfigure your grip, whereas in turning a layer part of
the cube remains static relative to yourself, so you can keep your
grip there. A cube rotation can actually be done by turning the two
bottom layers as well, a fact that is invaluable in F2L. The net
result compared to actually turning the entire cube is that the top
layer is off a bit, but this fact is almost irrelevant. Most likely
you&#x27;re going to have to turn the top layer anyway. So yes, turning the
cube around lets you spot more, but is a lot slower when compared to
this alternative, which allows for pretty much the same thing. If you
are really keen on turning the cube though, I suggest you go with
cross on the left, because that setup is actually quite friendly
towards cube turning. When turning the cube with cross on the bottom
you are turning around an axis that your hands don&#x27;t handle very well,
whereas turning around the &quot;horizontal&quot; axis is rather easy.

Hey Stefan, Per, <br>
<br>
I just tried doing the 4-gen (UuRr) myself and I have to say it was <br>
fun!  I&#x27;m still working on my method (I&#x27;ve only solved it once), but <br>
basically what I did was to do edges first (in order to avoid parity <br>
since it sounds like from what you guys are saying that it is <br>
difficult).  Then once I get the edges into a possible state for the <br>
3x3x3 2-generator I solve the edges and corners like a 3x3x3 2-gen.  <br>
Then I use commutators with setup moves to get all the centers to <br>
their correct spots.<br>
<br>
Not a fast or efficient solution probably, but a solution :)<br>
<br>
Now I&#x27;d like to work on optimizing this.<br>
<br>
Heh heh you guys were right, this is fun :)<br>

Yeah, as mentioned before, I started with lots of commutators, too, 
and needed 36 minutes. How long did you need? C&#x27;mon, can&#x27;t be worse 
than my time ;-)

The parity problems aren&#x27;t really that bad, the &quot;permutation parity&quot; 
is handled just like normal 4x4 and the &quot;orientation parity&quot; isn&#x27;t 
that bad either, at least not when you know [R2u]*5, which leaves very 
little to fix.

Btw, congrats for your new 4x4 record! I need to work on that, too :)

Cheers!
Stefan

Hi. <br>
<br>
I read somewhere in this forum a while back that electrical tape is really good <br>
for stickers. I am having a problem with them. My stickers are worn out after 3 <br>
weeks use and I went out and bought 5 colors of electrical tape (couldn&#x27;t find <br>
orange). I cut out a few white squares using an x-acto knife. Most of the <br>
squares were odd shaped, even though i used a straight edge and measured <br>
out the length and width of the squares. When i stuck a sticker onto my cube, it <br>
looked really funky. It wasn&#x27;t what i was expecting. It didn&#x27;t look professional. <br>
<br>
Is this because it was my first time or do i juss suck at cutting or is this what is <br>
supposed to happen. <br>
<br>
Also, i got a lot of air bubbles under my stickers. I tried removing them using <br>
the dull side of my x-acto knife. It wouldn&#x27;t go away. You cant notice the air <br>
bubbles if you&#x27;re in a slightly dark room, but who cubes in a slightly dark <br>
room? <br>
<br>
Can someone help me with that. <br>

Oh and also, what brand of electrical tape do you guys use? <br>

When was the last time you were hoping to get the parity error? I mean <br>
 the &quot;pair orientation&quot; one. For me, it was a few minutes ago. I did <br>
an average and the first 11 solves *all* had that error. But (partly <br>
thanks to my new alg) I was still able to get good times somehow. But <br>
that damn last solve didn&#x27;t have the error. Damn, that would&#x27;ve been <br>
so cool!!! But I missed my average record by 0.38 seconds anyway...<br>

I found orange after awhile but it took awhile.  Yeah, cutting just <br>

Doug Li cuts his own stickers by hand and they&#x27;re quite beautiful.  I <br>
at first didn&#x27;t believe that they were hand cut.<br>

Adam Zamora has a vinyl sticker cutting machine and sells stickers at <br>

I use electrical tape for restickering. Here&#x27;s a pic of the last 
cube I restickered: http://tinyurl.com/5y4p9

I didn&#x27;t have problems with bubbles under the stickers. Maybe I was 
using a thicker tape? (BTW, the URL above also has a pic of the tape 
label so you can see the brand).

One problem I have discovered is that the re-stickered cube doesn&#x27;t 
stay as nice and clean looking after months of being jostled around 
in my bag. :/ However, the electrical tape stickers do last 
significantly longer than regular stickers so I think it&#x27;s worth it.

I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much if the electrical tape stickers aren&#x27;t 
perfectly lined up and identical. I didn&#x27;t really measure mine and I 
just used a pair of regular scissors. I think my stickers look okay 
(unless you look really closely) -- but maybe your sticker standards 
are higher than mine!

&gt; I think that this demonstration is the only one existing except for <br>
&gt; the computer-generated ones that analysed all possible positions. <br>
<br>
You have shown that you can&#x27;t swap two corners, but it is actually <br>
much more restrictive. You cannot do any 3-cycles either. If you <br>
could, then a conjugation of it would give you a 3-cycle in one face. <br>
Combined with a turn of that face you would get a swap, which you <br>
have shown is impossible.<br>
<br>
I have done something very similar once, but I&#x27;ve never put it up on <br>
my site. There is a proof in Singmaster&#x27;s Notes on Rubik&#x27;s Magic Cube <br>
(5th ed.), which essentially boils down to much the same thing if I&#x27;m <br>
not mistaken. <br>
<br>
He labelled the positions (not the pieces) a-f. The five possible <br>
pairing arrangements are then:<br>
{ab,cd,ef}<br>
{ac,de,bf}<br>
{bd,af,ce}<br>
{ad,be,cf}<br>
{bc,ae,df}<br>
The moves U and R permute these five arrangements. He then shows any <br>
two different achievable corner permutations gives a different <br>
permutation of these five sets, so there can be at most 5! corner <br>
permutations. Therefore there are have 5! corner perms instead of the <br>
6! you would normally expect with 6 corners, i.e. a factor 6 less.<br>
<br>
It is easy to solve 3 corners in one face, and the other three will <br>
then automatically be solved. Instead of the 3!=6 arrangements that <br>
the 3 remaining corners normally could have, only the solved <br>
arrangement is possible.<br>

Hey!

Still working on the method, the steps. I will definitely NOT pair up 
edges ... lol ... that&#x27;s against my nature ;-)

One possible way is like this :

1) All the corners (easy)
2) All centers (fairly easy)
3) All edges except edges in u layer (a little hard i guess)
4) Check for parity (fix the parity, easy)
5) Last 3 edges in u layer (fairly easy)

But im still working on it. Step 1) and 2) can be easily swapped.

Cheers!!

Good thoughts and good advice.  I guess I kinda do feel myself 
slowing down when I turn the cube.  It&#x27;s just more comfortable and

Hey Stefan!!

Technically u haven&#x27;t mirrored ur original algorithm. If u wanna 
mirror u have the following replacement scheme :

U->R&#x27;
R->U&#x27;

What u have done is the following:

U->R
R->U

That scheme is a rotational symmetry, not mirroring ;-)

And when looking at ur original algorithm it can be extended to a 
pure &quot;dedge swap&quot; like this:

(Uu)&#x27; R U R
[(Uu)&#x27; R2] * 3
(Uu)2 R U&#x27; R&#x27; (Uu)2
R&#x27; U&#x27; R (Uu)&#x27;
+
U R&#x27; (U&#x27; R&#x27;) * 2 U2 (R U) * 2 R&#x27;

This will &quot;swap&quot; the UR &quot;dedge&quot;, while also cycling the 6 corners. 
Looking at the cyclic structure of these corners we have a 6-cycle 
which is ODD. So actually the algorithm fixes both parities and is 
not really a pure flip-parity fix ;-) But this is not really a 
problem if the alg is done early enough before the other parity has 
already been fixed  :-) Those who however can see that we don&#x27;t have 
the other parity as well might want to use another parity fix...

Cheers!

Hey again!!

Here is a shorter pure edge-swap to fix the parity :

(u&#x27;R2)*4 u&#x27; (Rr)(Uu)(Rr)&#x27; [U&#x27;,RuR&#x27;] (Rr)(Uu)&#x27;(Rr)&#x27; (23)

Trailing stefan&#x27;s fix by 4 moves but it&#x27;s a pure solution, it only 
swaps 2 pure edges. No more, and no less ;-)

Happy UuRr&#x27;ing :-P

Hi Per!

Who said I only used one mirror?!? ;-) I used two!

No, actually I was thinking of one only, but the mirror being a line 
(not a plane) diagonally through the cube, hitting the DL and UR edges 
pairs in the middle.

Hmm, you&#x27;re right. Since I indeed do it very early (I orient all edge 
pairs first, then fix this parity, then do F2L), it doesn&#x27;t matter for 
me.

Hi Per,

not bad, though I don&#x27;t really like turning inner slices alone ;-)

And how about this one:
(u&#x27;R2)*4 u&#x27; [R(Uu),R&#x27;U&#x27;R,u] 

If there&#x27;s a better notation than [S,A,B] = S(ABA&#x27;B&#x27;)S&#x27;, please let me 
know (and use it :-).

This alg has 21 moves, because my setup alg is shorter.

Are you sure it doesn&#x27;t destroy the centers (of a super 4x4)? At first 
I thought this could be used to solve the UuRr4x4, but if setup-moves 
destroy the centers and your alg destroys them further...

Cheers!
Stefan

And here&#x27;s another one:
U&#x27; R&#x27; (u&#x27;R2)*4 u&#x27; R (Uu) [R&#x27;U&#x27;R,u] u&#x27;

That&#x27;s also 21 if you connect the two u&#x27; at the end as u2 ;-)
I like this one because the two edges that are swapped are more 
independent so it allows more freedom...

Cheers!
Stefan

Hey!

Yes, Chris&#x27; (u&#x27;R2)*2 u&#x27; does &quot;rotate&quot; the four centers on the R face. 
Simply do (Uu)2 (u&#x27;R2)*2 u&#x27; (Uu)2 to verify that :D

In that case this rotation can be fixed for supersolving with the 
following :

(U&#x27;R&#x27;U R&#x27;)*5 (20)

Cheers!!

-Per

PS! And now i found a simple alg for the other parity :

(Uu)2 ((u&#x27;R2)*4 u&#x27;)*2 (Uu)2 (20) 

Cute, eh ?? Does the fix on the R layer. Transform as needed ;-)

Uh, Per, I don&#x27;t want to be mean, but ... I think you should probably 
get some sleep or something :)

Both
(Uu)2 (Rr)2 U2 r2 U2 (Rr)2 (Uu)2
and
r2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 u2
do the same as yours.

Unless yours doesn&#x27;t mess with the centers...

Cheers!

P.S. Today I shattered my old records, now best average of ten is 1:
21.83 and best single is 1:08.10 (actually I had a 1:07 or so, too, 
but the damn stopwatch didn&#x27;t want to stop and so I lost 2-3 seconds 
and got a 1:09.xy).

Lol!!

Finding these algs are easy enough ;-) And yes, mine doesn&#x27;t mess 
with centers at all. I forgot to mention that. So it&#x27;s most useful 
for supersolving. It&#x27;s easy to see that since i repeat Chris&#x27; alg 
twice in the middle of the alg, between the setupmoves. I know both 
those algs u mention. And yes i had forgotten that both are in our 
UuRr 4-g :-P One lousy excuse for forgetting that is that i never use 
them. They are needed only for edge-pairing method(s). 

And in case u need one more superalg for UuRr : 

(U2 R2 U&#x27; R2 U2 R&#x27;) * 6 = &lt;U,R> (18)

Cool new records !! Will take me a while before i can compete with 
that ;-)
U are actually faster on this stuff now than normal 4x4x4 solving. So 
if u find a fast way to build that 2x2x4 u have a new method for 
urself for the whole cube :-D

Not true anymore. I just got a 1:02.64 which even had the hardest 
permute-edges step (where I swap two opposite pairs, then do two 
3-cycles, i.e. three algs).

I think soon I might be faster with this than others are with the 
normal 4x4. And I&#x27;m already much faster than I am with the normal 4x4 
(best average 1:33.xy). Maybe I should think about how to build that 
2x2x4 block efficiently, then solve like UuRr4x4, and finish with a 
PLL (because of the corners), and then use that as my standard way to 
solve the normal 4x4 :-)

Cheers!
Stefan

I like to think of solving the pieces for a step based on how 
much &quot;information&quot; you have to fix for that step.

For the 2x2x4 you have 2 corners, each has 3 orientations and 
the &quot;information&quot; about it&#x27;s position.  So that&#x27;s 8 for both corners 
together.  Then each of the 6 edges only has 1 piece of information, 
their positions.  Lastly the centers sort of have 3/4 of a piece of 
information since all the ones of the same color are indistinct, and 
normally they would only have their positions.

So solving a 2x2x4 would have a rating of 18.5

Doing all the centers first on a cube (with all 24 having a 3/4 
rating, to mean that they only have their position, but it&#x27;s not 
very exact since they&#x27;re indisticnt) has a rating of 18.

Again this rating is only an estimation I use to figure out how hard 
a step would be based on the number and type of pieces, but based on 
that I think doing a 2x2x4, then solving the rest of the cube as a 4-
gen would be a very fast method if you get get your 4-gen times down.

As a comparison, all the centers with a rating of 18 takes me 15-17 
seconds on average probably.  So if you could do the 2x2x4 in 16-18 
(based on the slightly higher rating) and add that to your 4-gen 
times you a very rough idea of your average after lots and lots and 
lots of practice with your method.

Again this is just a very, very rough way I prefer to estimate how 
long a step will take.  My conclusion is that I really want to start 
learning to solve a 2x2x4 really quickly, and also work on my 4-gen 
times :)

I&#x27;ll probably try it, yes. I know several parts where I can still save 
quite some time. The 3x3 2gen part is one of them, I could at least 
save 5 seconds on average. And some algs I use could be optimized (i.
e. replaced by better ones) and the ones that are good, I need to 
practice them more. And pairing up edges is bad because I look very 
long for opportunities without twisting. That has to go, probably with 
more algs to take advantage of special situations that are currently 
bad cases for me. I should turn them into good cases.

I might try to challenge you with this, soon :-) I think my method for 
that is pretty good, though you&#x27;re still a bit faster than me...

Ok, I&#x27;ve been working on my method a lot, and so far my pb is down <br>
to 2:52.90, lol so almost three times Stefan :-P<br>
<br>
What I&#x27;m doing now is to do centers first, then group together <br>
edges, potentially having to fix the parity error.  Then I flip the <br>
edges that are impossible in 3x3x3 2-gen, then I solve as a two gen, <br>
potentially having to fix the permutation parity.<br>
<br>
If I had a shorter alg to flip two edges this would go quickly, as I <br>
can for the most part use my normal 4x4 edge pairing technique.  <br>
I&#x27;ve been trying also to correctly permute that pieces such that the <br>

that takes a lot of commutators to do.<br>
<br>
I seem to be averaging around 3-5 minutes right now, and have no <br>

I&#x27;m curious how you guys are doing this.<br>
<br>
If you guys can get the 4-gen times down to 50-55 seconds on average <br>

4x4 methods out there, assuming 16 seconds for the 2x2x4.<br>

Hi Chris!

So u are looking for easy way to flip 2 edges for UuRr cubing.
Here is quite an easy way to do exactly that :

[R&#x27;u R2 u2 R2 u&#x27; R, U] , flips UR and UB

or

[R&#x27;u R2 u2 R2 u&#x27; R, U2] , flips UR and UL

With appropriate setup moves u can flip whichever 2 &quot;dedges&quot; u 
fancy ;-)

Cheers!

Hey Per,

notice that Chris doesn&#x27;t need a pure version ;-)

Mine throws pieces around, but can be done in 2 seconds or less I 
think:

(Rr)&#x27; U-2 (Rr) flips the first pair
U R&#x27; U&#x27; replaces it with the second pair
(Rr)&#x27; U-2 (Rr) flips the second pair

The U-2 means turn it counterclockwise, I prefer index finger for 
first quarter and middle finger for second quarter. In the replacement 
step instead of R&#x27; you can use R or R2 if you want. And you can mirror 
it several ways. But I only use the one above.

And btw, I noticed that the pieces being thrown around is a good 
thing! Because almost always the next two pairs to be flipped end up 
in the almost correct positions for it.

Cheers!
Stefan

I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll catch up easily. Took me a week from 36 minutes to 1

How do you fix it?

Those &quot;limits of the current 4x4 methods&quot; seem to get smaller and 
smaller, though ;-) Congratulations on your new and much improved 
record! What did you do to improve your centers step?

Hey Stefan, Per,

Thanks for the flip algs, I&#x27;ll have to start using those and see if 
it helps my strategy any.

Thanks about the regular 4x4 record, I&#x27;ve been working on chaning my 
centers step a little after talking to Frank Morris.  I used to 
always solve the centers in the same order to minimize on thinking 
time, but unfortunately if those centers are poorly setup it takes 
longer.  Now I just solve the best setup centers at each step.

It takes some getting used to, but it works pretty well.

Chris

Hmm... was that 15-17 seconds average for centers before or after you 
switched to this? I.e. are you faster than that now? I think I average 
maybe 18-19 always starting with white.

ok dudes.<br>
<br>
i got like 34inch long of each of the rubiks colors in rolls of self<br>
adhesive vinyl on ebay. believe me they look so good and they stick super!<br>
<br>
good part is, it cost me only $5.00 :)<br>
<br>
msg this guy on ebay for more info. his seller ID is : coolgiftables<br>
<br>
PS: ill try and get pics of my cube with the newly replaced stickers<br>
when i have time. <br>
<br>
peace out<br>

well i do center first, not too difficult.<br>
<br>
then i used the same algorithm over and over again to pair up the edges.<br>
of course i do all edges with the white face (cos im going to form a<br>
white cross like a 3x3x3 :P)<br>
<br>
then i do pair up the other edges which have no yellow face hehe (cos<br>
i leave the edges with yello for bottom layer)<br>
<br>
after this is done, i do F3L (first three layers) that should leave<br>
you with a bottom last layer, yellow in my case.<br>

last layer should have one edge paired up , other three are messed up <br>

Dear lkyawkyaw,

ok dude, hehehe, yo da man, ok, peace hehehe :MATWBE) 

Most people do it quite similarly, solving centers first, then pair up 
edges (but all of them), then solve as a 3x3, fixing the &quot;3x3 parity&quot; 
problems at the appropriate points.

I don&#x27;t see how your algorithm solves the last three pieces. It does 
pair up the edges, but it even seems to destroy most of the F2L. I&#x27;d 
suggest this instead:
(Rr) U R&#x27; U&#x27; (Rr)&#x27;
That&#x27;s very fast and pairs up all those edges. And if you follow it 
with this, the F2L is restored again:
F R F&#x27;

For your other problem, try this:
(Llr&#x27;)&#x27; U (rU2)*4 r U&#x27; [DL2D&#x27;,r&#x27;] (Llr&#x27;)
Actually the last two moves cancel each other out a bit, so overall 
that&#x27;s 20 moves. There are probably shorter solutions, but this is 
intuitive and thus might fit into your method.

Cheers!
Stefan

Hey,

Unfortunately your strategy for the last F3L edge isn&#x27;t enough to 
avoid the parity error.  You run into that longer parity because you 
solve the centers first.  If you solve the centers, and the edges 
are in an odd permutation after doing the last move for the centers, 
then you will run into the parity.

Actually, with your method of doing the F3L, then solving the last 
edges later on, here is a much easier to remember algorithm for 
fixing the parity when you run into it.

If you solve the F3L normally, then start solving the LL edges and 
find that you have run into the parity error then do:

F2 B2 U r U2 r U2 r U2 r U2 r U&#x27; B2 F2

The easy way to remember this is [F2 B2 U] [(r U2)x4] [r] [U&#x27; B2 F2]

This will scramble your last layer edges a little bit, but such that 
when you try to solve them again, you won&#x27;t run into the parity.
In the long run it is more moves to do, but easier to remember.

To avoid the pairity 100% the time you have to determine the cycles 
of the edges, meaning whether or not they are in an odd permutation 
or not.  To do this you either have to figure out the cycles 
explicitly, or solve some of the pieces, then figure out the cycles 
of the remaining unsolved pieces.

Lately I&#x27;ve been working on figuring out the cycles not into the 
solved state for the edges, but into any position that I know is an 
even permutation of the edges.  This makes them easier to count, and 
can be done much quicker than either of the methods above.  I&#x27;m 
still practicing it, but I&#x27;ll post my strategies about it if it 
continues to be fruitful.

So in short, if you want to continue to solve the centers first for 
your 4x4 solution then you have to learn an algorithm to fix it, or 
count the cycles before you start your solve such that you can solve 
the centers and place the edges into an even permutation at the same 
time.

If it&#x27;s any consolation, the probability of running into that 
particular parity error is exactly 50%, so half the time you don&#x27;t 
have to worry about it.

Gosh, am I really sitting here at 6am for half an hour thinking about 
something better instead of going to bed? Cubing makes me sick!

[(Rr)2 (fb&#x27;)] [(r U2)x4.5] [(f&#x27;b) (Rr)2]

I know, I know, (fb&#x27;) is kinda poor, but at least it only modifies two 
edge pairs.

Hey Stefan,

I hadn&#x27;t actually timed each step for the 4x4 in a long time so I 
did a few solves just now and here are the numbers I got for each 
step.  The numbers are how long it took me to do the centers, edges, 
and as a 3x3x3.

17.42 22.91 39.40 = 79.73
17.86 23.63 27.44 = 68.93
16.86 23.29 29.09 = 69.24
19.09 29.85 32.56 = 81.50
14.14 24.38 27.00 = 65.52

Which is 17.07 for the centers, 24.81 for the edges, and 31.10 for 
the 3x3x3.  I guess I still need to work on the centers some to get 
to 16 seconds.  I think what&#x27;s saving my times is the edges step, my 
times haven&#x27;t changed all that much from when I was at 1:20, except 
that my edges step got faster.

Hey again Stefan :)

Here are some numbers I ran for the probabilities of certain types 
of positions.

The program I was using didn&#x27;t have a big integer calculator, or if 
it does I don&#x27;t know how to use it.  So anyway if you want the 
equations I used to get the exact numbers just let me know.  I 
basically just used the number of derangements of the pieces given a 
certain number of them solved.

Of all the 24! positions the edges can be in,

36.79% are 24-derangements, so none in the correct spot.
36.79% are 23-derangements, with exactly one piece in the correct 
spot
18.39% are 22-derangements (2 solved)
6.13% are 21-derangements (3 solved)
1.53% are 20-derangements (4 solved)
0.31% are 19-derangements (5 solved)
0.05% are 18-derangments (6 solved)

and the values get really small after that.

To make sure that the numbers I got were right I added up all the 
derangement cases, and I got 24!, so they do indeed work out.

The reason these numbers are important, is that if you count the 
cycles of the 4x4 edges directly you want the longest cycles 
possible, so you don&#x27;t have to remember which pieces are left not in 
a cycle yet.

You also want more pieces to be solved, since that means less time 
spent counting cycles.

What I am trying now is to count the cycles into a solvable 3x3 
position.  So I let the pieces go into easier to find locations, but 
I make sure that the cycle I count puts the pieces into a solvable 
3x3.

This does two things, it lets way more pieces end up as &quot;solved&quot; so 
I can skip them and keep counting pieces.  Also you don&#x27;t have to 
consider the orientation of the piece after moving it, since you fix 
the spot you want to place the piece into, i.e. the spot is not 
determined by the piece as exactly as if you count the cycles to 
their correct locations.

So far I&#x27;ve been able to determine the edge parity successfully 
almost every time in about a minute and a half on average.  I can 
occasionlly get it in 30-40 seconds, but only if it is a single long 
cycle, with lots of &quot;solved&quot; pieces along the way.  That&#x27;s why I 
wanted to start working out the probabilities of the different types 
of cycles, to see how often these easier cases come up.

I have a question for all you math people.  If I have a derangement 
of the 24 edge pieces, how do I know what fraction of that number 
are pure 24 cycles?  Also how do I know what fraction are 22 cycles, 
with a transposition?

My question is, given a derangment how do I determine the quality of 
the cycles in that derangment, and the number of each type?

I was thinking about approaching this by saying that 22 of the 
pieces are solved, so clearly there are 276 possible transpositions 
of (2-cycles) of the edges.  Then, given that 3 are incorrectly 
placed pieces there are 4048 possible 3-cycles.  However, it seems 
like this approach will be very calculation intensive when I get up 
to a pure 24-derangement.

Also will these numbers have anything to do with the Catalan numbers?

Hey!

Once again, i don&#x27;t see the point in trying to eliminate the &quot;flip 
dedge&quot; parity for 3x3x3 reduction principle. Maybe im just a lazy 
cubist, but i can&#x27;t see that it will be worth the effort. The parity 
fixing algs are easy to learn and are pretty fast. Ur overall speed 
depends very little on this issue. Time is better spent on improving 
all the basic steps IMHO. Maybe u guys look into it more for fun and 
out of theoretical interest. That&#x27;s fair enough ;-)

Happy cubing!

-Per

PS! Looking at the cyclic structure of the 24 basic edges it should 
be possible to eliminate the &quot;swap dedge&quot; parity as well as the &quot;flip 
dedge&quot; parity. Why are u discussing almost solely the latter parity? 
Hehe ... ;-) Is it more evil than the first one? :-P

- Using Paint, Word or any other that can make lines, draw a matrix
with 16 mm between the lines.
- Print your page, and glue it on the back of the vinyl sheet.
- Rule + cutter. You can quickly obtain hundreds of square stickers.
- Before applying on the cubes, you should make the corners round with

It is surely interesting :-)

Though I&#x27;m worried about using it in speedcubing, too. But for a 
slightly different reason. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the time you spend to 
learn it that could be used to improve the other steps, but it&#x27;s that 
it&#x27;ll probably slow us down while solving the centers cause we need to 
count (mod 2). And if we just make one mistake, we&#x27;re doomed cause 
then we will accidentally try to get the error instead of avoid it.

Actually I think the &quot;swap&quot; one is more evil. That&#x27;s because the 
&quot;flip&quot; is obvious to see when I arrive at it. The &quot;swap&quot; is still 
quite often killing me, making me wonder what PLL I&#x27;m at and whether 
it has the error.

Hi Chris,

thanks for those times. I did the same and this is the result:

22.60 40.44 36.78
13.58 49.85 56.06
18.80 49.98 44.02
19.81 55.15 44.13
19.65 45.15 42.59

That&#x27;s 18.88 on average for centers and I&#x27;m too embarrassed to even 
compute the sums and other averages :-) But I blame the not so good 
light for those (I don&#x27;t think it had a big effect on the centers).

I guess solving centers is the only step I do not need to work on... 
and I think with better general handling of the cube, I might beat you 
there. But then again, 5 attempts is not really enough to draw 
conclusions. Btw, I always solve the white center first and don&#x27;t plan 
ahead any further (unless white is real easy).

Cheers!
Stefan

Hey Chris,

I verified your numbers with my own program now. And here are the 
numbers you wanted to know:

 2  0.0000 50.0000
 3  0.0000 33.3333
 4  0.0000 25.0000
 5  0.0000 20.0000
 6  0.0000 16.6667
 7  0.0000 14.2857
 8  0.0000 12.5000
 9  0.0000 11.1111
10  0.0000 10.0000
11  0.0000  9.0909
12  0.0000  8.3333
13  0.0000  7.6923
14  0.0000  7.1429
15  0.0000  6.6667
16  0.0002  6.2500
17  0.0012  5.8824
18  0.0077  5.5556
19  0.0439  5.2632
20  0.2083  5.0000
21  0.7937  4.7619
22  2.2727  4.5455
23  4.3478  4.3478
24  4.1667  4.1667

First column is X. Second column gives the probability that of the 24 
edges, exactly X are wrong but are in one long cycle including all X 
edges. Third column assumes you solved some edges and only X are left, 
and gives the probability that they&#x27;re in one long cycle. All 
probabilities in %. Btw, this is real easy to compute, find out how ;
-)

You could also always rotate the cube so that one edge is solved, i.e. 
avoid 24-derangements. Yes, I know that won&#x27;t help much :)

I have no idea what you mean here, sorry... or do you mean the &quot;goal&quot; 
spot for an edge is not the overall goal spot, but the spot right next 
to its partner (with which it shall be paired up)?

Answered above.

Not answered above. Why are you interested in this special case? Or if 
it&#x27;s just an example, formulate what derangements you&#x27;re after (e.g. 
only derangements with two cycles).

> Also will these numbers have anything to do with the Catalan 
numbers?

Hmm, they might share the divide-and-conquer principle, but other than 
that, I don&#x27;t see a connection.

Cheers!
Stefan

Hehe, sorry, couldn&#x27;t resist :-) Btw, it&#x27;s easy to see if you think 
about how you&#x27;d write down a 24-cycle.

Hey Per, Stefan,

I just took some practice trials of my cycles counting practice.  
The first time in each row is how long it took me to count the 
cycles, and the second is how long it took me to solve the cube 
having avoided the parity error.

48.19 1:15.23 
39.73 1:05.69 
(37.95 1:15.87)
1:12.04 1:22.46
1:01.12 1:13.9 
47 1:35.71
52.51 1:17.24
1:08.68 1:19.45
(1:34.62 1:25.78)
51.03 1:20.82
58.85 1:24.76
59.61 1:25.12 

which is 55.88 seconds on average to determine the parity of the 
edges when taken as a usual 10 average.  I should mention that this 
isn&#x27;t a true average, I screwed up on 3 of the solves, so I really 
did 15 trials and took the 12 successful ones.  I&#x27;m just trying to 
get a rough idea of how long this is taking me.

To make a mth observation, getting the parity error 3 times or less 
in 15 trials has only a 1.76% chance of occuring, so I think we can 
say that it is very likely that my screw-ups were actually screwups 
and not that my process still makes it random chance that I see the 
parity error.  Also, the last 6 solves were all consectuive with no 
screw-ups which only has 1/64 chance of occuring if my process was 
just random chance.   Once I practice more I&#x27;ll try to do a 12 
average with no screwups, which only has a 0.02% chance of occuring 
if you leave the parity error to chance.

Here are a few observations to what you guys have said in past 
messages, just to answer your questions.

Keeping track of the parity of the edges while solving the centers 
doesn&#x27;t take all that much more time or effort.  I use my feet to 
keep track of the turns.  Every time I do a single quarter turn I 
switch the foot that I am pressing to the ground.  So if I am 
pressing my right foot down, the parity is even, my left means the 
parity is odd.  I don&#x27;t do this for every turn, since a lot of the 
moves are really just conjugates (some quarter turn / some face 
turn / the inverse of the first quarter turn) so you don&#x27;t have to 
do this for every move.

Also, Per to answer your question, I&#x27;m trying to see if counting 
cycles will be worthwhile.  If people are learning hundreds of 
algorithms for the 3x3x3 to drop a couple seconds of their average, 
I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any stranger for me to practice and see if this 
4x4 technique will drop a few seconds off my average.  I&#x27;m doing it 
for the same reason that people are learning ZB for the 3x3x3, to 
see if it will help lower my times some more.

Also, the reason I only focus on the flip parity is that it is much 
easier to determine given the centers-first style of solving.  In 
order to keep my edges step fast, I have to be able to solve the 
first edge I see, rather than a particular one to help determine the 
position parity.  So trying to identify this parity takes thought 
and skill while the timer is timing my solve.  If I practice 
counting the cycles long enough and can actually use it, then I can 
determine the flip parity within the 15 second inspection, without 
ever having been under the timer.

Hey Chris!

If u can determine during 15 secs inspection it&#x27;s awesome. But 
shouldn&#x27;t u plan ur first moves (the centers) within that inspection 
time? ;-) As i said it&#x27;s theoretically interesting at least. And it&#x27;s 
nice if u can really improve ur times that way. But im not gonna do 
it since i use a different method. I only encounter 1 kind of parity. 
The flip parity, which is easily dealt with when i can for the most 
part ignore the centers at that stage.

Now i better get on with my work. I should only do cubing stuff in 
the evening ... lol ...

Hi Chris,

do you have an idea why your solves became much slower than usual, 
despite avoiding the error?

Hmm, your words, cheerfully explaining how to exploit inspection time, 
make me strongly think again that inspection time should be discarded 
and we should all do non-inspection solves only.

Cheers!

Hello,<br>
<br>
it is a pleasure for me to announce the availability of our &quot;Book of<br>
Alternative Records&quot;. This is a new book about unusual, funny,<br>
creative world records, and I am sure that it has the most complete<br>
list of speedcubing records published in a book so far. The records in<br>
the book are based on my Internet page<br>
http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/rubik.html and include the<br>
results of the US and European championship 2004 as the last events<br>
before the deadline.<br>
<br>
To get an impression of the book and the other records, please visit<br>
http://www.alternativerecords.co.uk (from where you can also order<br>
your copy.)<br>
<br>
We hope to publish a second edition next year. For this reason,<br>
submissions of new record claims are always welcome (see<br>
http://www.alternativerecords.co.uk/worldrecordbreaker.asp for details).<br>
<br>

Hi Chris, Stefan,

   If you left 4 centers in a line (like U F D B centers) unsolved, 
and also left the four edge pairs in that line plus the UR and UL edge
pairs, then you could quickly count to see if the parity was present.
If it was present you add a half turn - r, r&#x27;, l, or l&#x27;, then solve
the remaining centers and edges with an even number of quarter turns. 

Regards,

David J

Well, the top four competitors were not from the middle school, not 
just Lars Petrus. Most of the others competing started within the 
last few months (I think), so they haven&#x27;t had the time to gain 
speed yet.

Hi Stefan,

   If you rather not, that&#x27;s fine, since there&#x27;s no technical reason
to leave them unsolved before checking for parity. I just find it
easier to solve the remaining edges and centers if I can freely move
the &quot;Up&quot; side. I don&#x27;t know - it may well be better to have those two
edge pairs solved first.

   Come to think of it, a study of that whole r l slice pair might be
rather rewarding...

   Good question, thanks.

Regards,

David J

Ok, people are asking me for the sequence.
So I open the 50Hz file with VirtualDub, play it frame by frame and it
looks like R&#x27;RRUR&#x27;U&#x27;R&#x27;FRRU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27;F&#x27;.

I got that this takes 20 indirectly (namely by obtaining that all its <br>

Hey!

I guess R&#x27;RR&#x27; makes much more sound ... lol (or oll :-P  )

What does it take to make 50 Hz movie in the first place? Can a 
320x240 logitech avi webcam capture be made into 50 Hz somehow ?? It 
will be 30 fps or 15 fps according to the webcam settings...

Happy cubing.

That&#x27;s nice! You can find other 20-turn positions at

http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/symmetr1.htm
http://www.math.ucf.edu/~reid/Rubik/symmetric.html

but they all have higher symmetry than this: yours has 3-fold 
rotational symmetry about the DFR-ULB axis, plus a centre of symmetry 
(according to Cube Explorer 3.56).

Well spotted. Thanks for posting the link here. :)

I noticed that the article refers &quot;Cubers of both sexes...&quot;. I&#x27;m 
skeptical of this. As far as I can tell (from competitions and 
online stuff), there are very few other female cubers.

Or perhaps the other female cubers are just not as obsessed and thus 
don&#x27;t go to competitions, don&#x27;t post online and don&#x27;t create 
websites? ;)

Yes, I believe girls just don&#x27;t need to show off as much as the guys. 
They sit quietly in their homes breaking all the records and laughing 
about us. Yep, that must be it.

My girlfriend Lisa can now solve a cube, also her sister and her sisters
friend, but none of them would ever want to go in a competition. And they
haven&#x27;t thus far shown any of the obsessive tendencies that I have had when
learning/improving with the cube.

 

Lisa&#x27;s fastest time is 48.98 seconds, but she doesn&#x27;t feel any desire to
improve :-(

 

I really think it is a predominantly male trait, not really anything to do
with whether one sex is better at cubing, just one sex wants to be better at
cubing :-)

I have managed to get at least two girls in my class interested in
cubing. To create some motivation I have promised that as soon as one
of them goes sub 30 I&#x27;ll go dance swing. And yeah, I completely suck
at dancing, so they better keep improving after that!

I&#x27;d say that what you&#x27;ve described is definitely the more usual 
situation.

It&#x27;s completely opposite with me. I&#x27;m the one who&#x27;s obsessed by 
cubing, whereas my brother thinks it&#x27;s all pretty geeky and isn&#x27;t 
all that interested. He can solve it, but not very fast (a couple of 
minutes). Interestingly, my brother is actually in the typical 
speedcuber demographic - twenty-something year old male engineer.

It&#x27;s kinda cool to be a bit different! :)

You should tell him he&#x27;d get all the chicks, maybe that&#x27;ll change his

I&#x27;m sure the group has talked about this before.  The same phenomenon <br>
happens to a huge degree in chess that they actually award WGM titles <br>
which are separate from the grand master title.  Maybe the cubing <br>
community should start some female cubing recruitment programs?  Make <br>
it each and every cuber&#x27;s mission to introduce one female to cubing <br>

Having and being able to solve the cube are quite different from the 
minority pursuit of speedsolving, which requires an enormous amount 
of self motivation (and who knows what other, less admirable 
character traits). My eldest daughter (10) regularly solves her 
cube... and the only other person she knows of a similar age who can 
solve the cube is also a girl.  That&#x27;s a tiny sample, but let&#x27;s not 
lose hope :)

You could try to write out (DUMBER)*3 without inner slice turns and 
then repeat that.

I just did (DUMBER)*3 by hand and found:

- flipped cycle with 7 edges (factor 2*7)
- flipped cycle with 2 edges (2*2)
- flipped cycle with 2 edges (2*2)
- flipped cycle with 1 edge (2*1)
- correct cycle with 4 corners (1*4)
- correct cycle with 2 corners (1*2)
- 2 solved corners (1)

That means it will repeat after
LCM( 2*7, 2*2, 2*2, 2*1, 1*4, 1*2 ) = 28
repetitions, which means (DUMBER)*84 is the identity. Now go prove no 
smaller factor results in identity, too :-)

Hi Richard,

This is a different case. I&#x27;m after percentages following each prime.
So the - 1/6, which is an adjustment from two and three&#x27;s overlap,
comes before 1/5.

If you look at it one prime at a time, it can produce several things
from which information may be gleaned. I mentioned a line which may
predict a continuation into areas uncharted, but there are other ways
of looking at it. For example, I thought that maybe at any prime point
one could dip into the percentage left that contained primes
undiscovered and make a prediction:

So here each step concerns a prime number. After the first step each
additional steps is added (with adjustment) to the prior steps. If the
steps are a, and the cumulative results (density of non primes) are b,
density of possible primes are c, I would go:
a(2)= 1/2 = 0.5
a(3) adds 1/6 = 0.166667
a(5) adds 1/15 = 0.066667
a(7) adds 1/35 = 0.02857142857142857142857142857142857
(If this is an accurate trend then (whew) it would save a lot of work.)

b(2)= 0.5 
b(3)= 0.6666...
b(5)= 0.733333333 etc
b(7) = 0.7619047619047619047619047619047

c(2) = 0.5
c(3) = 0.3333....
c(5) = 0.266666666 etc
c(7) = 0.2380952380952380952380952380952
         
OK. Then in practice:

a(2) every other taken away.

Prediction:
b(2) = 0.5 - at least half of the next 6 numbers (3) aren&#x27;t prime,
leaving 
c(2) possibly half, or 3 prime.
 
actual: 4 6 8 not prime. 3 5 and 7 are prime. (Works until next prime
squared (9).)

a(3) every third taken away, 
(3*2) every other 3rd having been taken away twice, I put back every
other 3rd, - corrections = 1/6

Prediction: 
b(3) = 0.6666... - at least two thirds of the next 21 numbers (14)
aren&#x27;t prime, leaving
c(3) possibly one third or 7 prime. 

actual from 4 to 24 - 4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,20,21,22,24 not prime,
then 5,7,11,13,17,19,23 are prime
 
a(5) every fifth taken away, 
(5*2) every other 5th having been taken away twice, I put back every
other 5th, 1/10
(5*3) every third 5th having been taken away twice, I put back every
third 5th, 1/15
    (5*3*2) every sixth 5th having put back twice, I take away every
sixth 5th, 1/30,
corrections = 1/15

Prediction
b(5) = 0.733333333 percent, or at least 33 of the next 45 numbers
aren&#x27;t prime, then 
c(5) possibly 0.2666666667 percent or (12) are  prime.

actual from 6 through 50 -  6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21,
22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44,
45, 46, 48, 49, 50 then not prime 7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47
are prime. 

(interesting that it caught 7 squared)

a(7)  every seventh taken away, 
(7*2) every other 7th having been taken away twice, I put back every
other 7th - 1/14,
(7*3) every third 7th having been taken away twice, I put back every
third 1/7th - 1/21,  
(7*5) every fifth 7th having been taken away twice, I put back every
fifth 1/7th - 1/35, 
    (7*3*2) every third 14th having been put back twice, I take away
every third 14th - 1/42,
    (7*5*2) every other 35th having been put back twice, I take away
every other 35th - 1/70, 
    (7*5*3) every third 35th having put back twice, I take away every
third 35 - 1/105. 
      (7*5*3*2) every other 105th having been taken away twice, I put
back every other 105th - 1/210. corrections = 1/35 =
0.02857142857142857142857142857142857

prediction:
b(7) = 0.761904761904761904761904761904762 percent or at least 80 of
the next 105 not prime, then 
c(7) possibly 0.238095238095238095238095238095238 percent or 25 prime

actual from 8 through 112
8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,20,21,22,24,25,26,27,28,30,32,33,34,35,36,38,39,40,42,44,45,46,48,49,50,51,52,54,55,56,57,58,60,62,63,64,65,66,68,69,70,72,74,75,76,77,78,80,81,82,84,85,86,87,88,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,98,99,100,102,104,105,106,108,110,111,112

prime

Is that accurate enough for you?

It took time to step through each portion, so I didn&#x27;t check to see
how far each prediction could go, and the complexity grows with every
step, so I&#x27;m not quite sure of the full process.
I haven&#x27;t tried yet to make single equation out of it. 
I don&#x27;t know how useful all this can be, since so many primes are
already known, there&#x27;s no way I can do this longhand...that is, having
no access to a supercomputer, I can&#x27;t tell how useful it might be,
ultimately.

I would enjoy seeing this tried. Know anyone interested?

sum of an absolutely convergent series).

Like, for example, looking at 0.8888... being one side of a zipper and
0.1111... being the other side.

I think Zeno understood the paradox, but none of his &quot;peers&quot; did.

Archery in a vacuum?

Right. One of the paradoxes (paradoces?) has one of two runners
catching the other. We&#x27;re dealing with two relative speeds and we
define speed as distance covered over time. s=d/t. By leaving time out
of the equation we&#x27;re essentially trying to divide by zero.

Nice talking with you,

The results of this week&#x27;s challenge are now available from the FMC page -
www.cubestation.co.uk &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/>  

 

Quite a quiet week, but congratulations to Charles Tsai who posted the
shortest solution to an FMC since the competition began, he has reduced the
benchmark to just 21 moves!

Thank you to all who entered!

 

Also added to the results of FMC #65 03/10/04 is Alexander Ooms&#x27; solution,
which was posted in time last week but an error on my part meant that I
didn&#x27;t post it with the other results! Sorry Alex, your solution is now
listed on the results page.

 

I&#x27;m planning to do something a little different for the Christmas Challenge,
but at the moment I haven&#x27;t got a clue what! Any suggestions would be taken
on board :D

 

Speak soon!

 

Dan :-)

Nope. (&quot;tubable?&quot; I assume you mean &quot;tunable.&quot;) The centers with the
arched underside are part of the new cubes, but the new tunable cubes,
with screws instead of rivets, are only available in the DIY kits on
rubiks.com...when they have them in stock.

The chat was great!! For people who missed it: we had several online

Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
For those of you who were at the US Rubiks Nationals earlier this <br>
year, you&#x27;ll know that I&#x27;ve been living and working in the US for <br>
the last while. It was great catching up with the American cubers <br>
(plus Ton) whom I met in Toronto last year! :)<br>
<br>
Now I have other news, which is that my company has moved me to the <br>
UK. I&#x27;ve seen that there have been heaps of cubing comps in Europe <br>
this year, so it&#x27;ll be great to be closer to that action. :) I&#x27;m <br>
looking forward to meeting and catching up with the European <br>
cubers! :)<br>

Hi Michiel,

Do you mean the ambigram? If so, see you have been reading Dan Brown 
novels too! BTW, Angels &amp; Demons is actually my favourite one - the 
ambigrams are cool. :)

Hi Jasmine :-)

At least if u gonna be living in the south of UK u gonna be pretty 
close to Holland, which is really a _hot spot_ for cubing/puzzling. 
And of coz u can meet up with DanH also ;-)

It has been said in past that cubing is a real chick-magnet. Well, i 
suppose that a chick cubing is at least an equivalently big guy 
magnet!!

LOL!! :D

Happy cubing !!

I&#x27;m living in London, so yeah, not too far from DanH. And I&#x27;m

BTW, still trying to get my fiance (Peter) sufficiently interested

I think it was one of my first questions when I arrived in this group.<br>

Adjusting screws can be useful, but it doesn&#x27;t help if the springs are<br>

Does anybody know where to buy that kind of springs? Maybe a bit<br>

cube is way too loose. I thinks the screws should go in deeper <br>
somehow, but that seems impossible... Does this sound like I am <br>
doing something wrong?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Joel.<br>
<br>
P.S.: Merry Christmas, everybody!! :D<br>

Hi Joel,

   I imagine if you put a washer between the screw head and the center
cubie piece that would solve the problem. Don&#x27;t put the washer between
the center cubie piece and the spindle.

David J

Hi Gilles,

When I met Ton Dennenbroek at the US Nationals he had a repair kit
with him which had most everything needed to restore a cube, and IIRC
it had springs, So I would guess you could start by asking him where
he gets them.

          <div class="email-content">hey gilles.

merry christmas btw :P

anyways if you want spring replacements, one thing i
do i go down to chinatown where they have those
generic tiled rubiks cubes that break easily.

interestingly, their springs are pretty good.

bought one for $2.50 and i removed the springs from
the center and used them. pretty neat

i hope you find this useful.

Like Salvia said, don&#x27;t put the washer between the spring and the
piece. If your cube is too lose, though, that&#x27;s probably not the
problem. I did this when I assembled my first and all my friends
cubes, so I ended up destroying all their springs - having to buy new
ones (springs, not cubes). So yeah, don&#x27;t do that. :P

a little tip is to learn to do the f2l from every
angle. and slowly.. do it. it helps :P

believe me i know.

i got from 1:15 to 26~30sec in just 4 weeks from
learning everything, so you can do it!!

good job!

Thanks, Chris! I&#x27;ve placed a link to the page on my site. A couple of 
days ago, John (lkyawkyaw) and I talked briefly about how almost all 
sites list algorithms which are mainly for right-handed 
cubers...plus, I often try to improve awkward algs through mirroring 
and inverting. This should save a lot of time. =D

Thanks again,

Once you get all the corners, you solve the edges of one face first.
I&#x27;m not sure what you do for this step, but what I do is forget about
the center at the moment, and just put three edges into the corners so
it&#x27;s a sort of U shape. Then pair up the center and the last edge, and
you can put both of them into the right place in one algorithm. The
algorithm isn&#x27;t very hard, so you can probably figure it out, but if
you can&#x27;t I&#x27;ll help you.

For the last face, I put two edges in at once. First put one edge in,
which will mess up one edge on the first face, but then put the second
edge in which resolves the edge on the first face.

Sorta hard to explain, but I hope this helps....

My cf method isn&#x27;t all that great...

solve first 4 corners
orient and permute corner
solve opposite faces
orient midges
permute midges

yes i know...i need to probally work on inserting last edge and 
orienting midges at the same time.

I just got a DIY from Rubiks.com as well. I too recieved paper
stickers. The screws you got may fit into the axel, but a little
convincing is needed. It took a little force to get screws in as well.
In the end, the finished cube was acceptable, but no better than the
new &#x27;pre-made&#x27; arched cubes, in my opinion.

You should check out Josef Jelnek&#x27;s site.  There is a link to in at 
speedcubing.com.  He has good descriptions of corners first 
methods.  The Waterman system is a fast corners method but you have 
to learn a ton of algs.

Yes, of course, there are direct algorithms for any possible position.
However, the particular case you mention is most often solved by
swapping two edges and then using a simple PLL. I don&#x27;t know of any
other algorithm, nor any people who use such.

The double edge swapper, by the way, if you don&#x27;t already have it, is:

r2 U2 r2 (Uu)2 r2 u2

It is short, easy to learn and easy to perform, so I see no reason for
learning alternative approaches, especially when these alternative
approaches are applicable in so few cases.

R u talking about algs where a single edge is adjascent to another or

My corners&#x27; first is like Ryans, and I solve the opposite faces by 
pairing upper and lower edges in the middle slice, and then place 
them. However, I normally leave one edge left in either the upper or 
the lower face. From there, I have options so that I get the correct 
orientation of the edges in the middle layer when placing the last 
edge in the upper/lower face.

Joel does that cube thingy I fowarded to you usefull? If anybody is 
interested in pairing up multiple edges at once (up to six in one 
sequence) e-mail me and I&#x27;ll foward you a very nice explanation and 
cube animated gift. Also I would like to thank Ron  for that cube 
thing. It helped me, and I hope it helps other too.

          <div class="email-content">Here are pics of how I do it<br>
<br>
in picture  002 I have placed the first three centres, and allowed them to go to the sides for now.<br>
<br>
In picture 003 the forth centre in in place.<br>
<br>
&gt;From here I twist the centres around so they are all in the proper place and place the edges and corners, going around the center<br>
<br>
in picture.jpg you see all that remains to be inserted is the final two edge pieces.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone!

 

The results of the Christmas FMC are now online on my website -
www.cubestation.co.uk &lt;http://www.cubestation.co.uk/>  and click on the
Fewest Move Challenge link.

It was a really enjoyable challenge, I hope you had a lot of fun taking
part, and if you didn&#x27;t take part there is always the New Years challenge to
play in!

 

It was hard work posting the results, so I apologise for any aesthetic
mistakes, although I am 99.9% sure that all the solutions listed are correct
and do solve the scramble to the desired position. If you think there is an
error please get in touch.

 

Happy New Year guys, have a great cubing 2005, and make it your New Year
resolution to take part in the FMC, we are a friendly bunch ;)

 

Dan Harris :-)
