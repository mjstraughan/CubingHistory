I thought that either a correctly scrmabled cube, or a diagram of the 
correctly applied scramble would be avalible to all the scramblers and 
is checked. Perhaps a head-scrambler can do this quick check. In the 
event of an incorrect scramble, it should be solved and re-scrmabled; 
I always assumed this was already the case. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.

Another thing I just thought of: There have been at least 2 times, at 
different competions where I got the same scramble twice in a row... 
we need more safegaurds in place for this not to happen as much.

I think if you read the context in which he said that, it&#x27;s clear he 
actually meant the opposite. Different people will for several 
reasons solve even the same cube different ways, and if one ends up 
lucky and another doesn&#x27;t, there&#x27;s nothing unfair about it.

Cheers!

Yes, that did happen to me in a competition, too. And the worst thing 
about it was not the fraction of a second I need more to reach the 
cube, but the psychological effect. It&#x27;s very much disrupting my 
concentration, and I kept thinking about it and the bastard judge 
through out the solve.

For that reason, I suggest supporting this:
http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=180

That&#x27;s cheating, and it&#x27;s not what those 3s are intended for.

That&#x27;s unnatural. If you ask Joe Normal-Person to scramble the cube 
for you, he&#x27;ll most probably not care about the cube orientation.

Also, like Gilles Roux already mentioned, there are several ways to 
define specific cube orientations. Some people might take the centers 
as reference, others might take a corner as reference. If someone 
requests yellow center on top and orange center on front, someone 
else must be allowed to request the white/red/green corner to be at 
down/back/left.

I&#x27;d vote for computer-random cube-orientations (i.e. pick one of the 
24 whole cube orientations). And applied *before* the scramble 
algorithm.

Cheers!
Stefan

Also one for the 2x2, please, as it&#x27;s smaller. And another for 
Megaminx. And another for...

An arrow labeled &quot;competitor&quot; on top of the cover would be both 
easier to get right and less revealing.

Happened to me with the Clock once. And another time I was given a 
solved cube. I insisted on doing the solve, but the bastard judge 
didn&#x27;t listen and took it away (which is against the rules!).

That was me! The &quot;bastard&quot; scrambler put a cover on your solved 5x5<br>
cube and I assumed it was correctly scrambled (which I shouldn&#x27;t).<br>
Believe me that from that moment on, I always check the state of the cube.<br>
<br>
Maybe according to the regulation you should have obtained a sub-1<br>
second record on the 5x5. You knows?<br>

          <div class="email-content">So running into parity as a matter of luck or randomness is
acceptable, but randomness in starting cube orientation is not? One
affects your time by a lot, the orientation issue only takes you about
2 seconds of inspection time to fix. As far as I&#x27;ve observed, the
majority of competitors don&#x27;t take the full 15 seconds of
preinspection anyway, and this doesn&#x27;t affect their actual solve time,
whereas parities or lucky last layers do.

As for blindfolding, a random starting orientation is the most fair.
If everyone starts with the same orientation, some people will never
have to turn the cube, some people will always have to spend that
extra second (I&#x27;m weird and solve with yellow top, orange front), even
if they already know what the orientation will be. The only fair way
is to give everyone the same chance of getting their preferred
orientation.

Trying to guarantee a constant orientation for everyone is too hard.
Cubes get shuffled around too much on the scrambling table, especially
in very busy rounds. At the Caltech tournaments, our method of
randomizing orientation after scrambling is usually to just toss the
cube in the air so that it spins a few times, then catch it and put it
under the cover.

Well I was of course not very serious. Didn&#x27;t even remember it was a 
5x5 (thought 3x3). Just sharing stories of things going wrong 
somehow, as mistakes just do happen from time to time. I wonder 
whether I could get away with putting my scrambled cube on the 
scrambler table in a moment nobody&#x27;s looking, and then get the cube 
handed to me for solving without being scrambled further. No, I won&#x27;t 
do that, it&#x27;s just a thought.

Cheers!
Stefan

what I mean is...if you can tell the scramblers to scramble the cube with a certain orientation, I think you can ask the judges to put it on the table on that orientation...I can&#x27;t see what would make it so hard, or even imposible...

sorry if I sounded agressive/angry/rude/anything else

 that&#x27;s what I said on my early post...if you can stablish that the cube will be scrambled with, say, green on front and white on top, why is it so bloody hard to make the judge put it down that way? o.O

  having everyone competing at the same time, so THAT is something we cant
  get round. 2nd thing is, theres no way (or give me one very good reason?)
  to see why scrambling cubes with the same orientation is equal for everyone,
  while handing them in random orientations is not. Its not coherent. If you
  want to make it random, make it random all the way, or not at all. 
  
  And Im not really getting the point of what you said: why should I bother
  looking that the guy is doing y2x when I know Ill have to do y2x, for a
  set table orientation? If I know theyll be giving me the cube with yellow
  front and green top, I know Ill have to do x, and I can practice at home
  in this fashion, picking up the cube while doing x. If its set, no one
  will get lucky or unlucky, because itll be the same for every single cube
  youll ever solve in competition. But if I dont know, maybe Ill be
  advantaged, and maybe not, but for sure, if I get a 1:21 bld solve with an
  unlucky orientation at the beginning, Ill be pretty pissed.
  
  It all looks to me like when we first chose the stackmat as the official
  timing device, the point was, we do count the time to pick up and drop the
  cube, you just have to practice at home so youre used to picking it up fast
  and dropping it down quickly. Here, you just have to be doing whatever xyz
  you need very quickly, during the motion to lift the cube.
  
  But really my main point here is the coherence between scrambling and
  starting orientations. Whatever is chosen has to be coherent, and I dont
  feel it is very logical as it is now.

  What about the unfairness of the competitors that have to go first in
  this scenario of having a set orientation? 
  
  I actually think that using a set starting orientation for each
  scramble increases the unfairness factor. More specifically, the
  &quot;unlucky&quot; cubers who go first.
  
  For example, i know that many of the cubers use the same white cross
  to start. So i if i don&#x27;t go first, i am happy. I watch someone that i
  know uses the same starting face color and see they had to waste the 1
  second doing a y2 x&#x27;. And then when i go up there, i know what i have
  to do without even looking at the cube. I should be able to do it in
  one motion as i pick up the cube, almost eliminating the delay
  altogether. 
  
  Whereas if it is just a total random orientation, we all have an equal
  chance of getting it in a good position, and an equal chance of having
  it in a bad position.

Also one for the 2x2, please, as it&#x27;s smaller. And another for 
Megaminx. And another for...

An arrow labeled &quot;competitor&quot; on top of the cover would be both 
easier to get right and less revealing.

Learn F2L, i.e. first two layers by putting in a corner and a middle 
edge at the same time. The way this works is you connect a corner and a 
middle layer edge into a pair, and then you insert the pair. There&#x27;s 
tons of websites that teach you this. But you can also start with an 
intuitive approach, and try to find out yourself.

I think most of us are talking about that #1 moment...

but, tell me...say you and another petrus solver are in the same comp...then, on some round, you get your cube with the better C/E pair on DBL and don&#x27;t even see it...and the other guy gets it on UFL...then you get a bad time and the other one gets a really good one...won&#x27;t you feel at least a bit sad?

I mean...if we want to give everybody the same chance, let&#x27;s give everybody the same cube orientation...that way, everybody has the same chance to get lucky...which won&#x27;t happen if we give a &quot;random&quot; orientation to each one...

          <div class="email-content">Hey!

This is the first time posting on this group, but I have been reading
it frequently. I&#x27;m glad to finally join and be a part of it (not sure
why I didn&#x27;t earlier.)

Cubesmith is very legitimate.  Your stickers WILL come. 

I contacted him at a secondary email I found, and I asked why he
hadn&#x27;t responded to my inquires and asked if his cubesmith email was
down. He replied with, &quot;My Cubesmith email is indeed down at the moment.&quot;

It may take longer to receive your order, but, he WILL get it done. 
The stickers are INCREDIBLE quality, and it&#x27;s worth the wait.  This is
not his only job, and he does this on his spare time.

I had quite the large order, and mine did take quite a while, but rest
assured, they did come exactly as ordered.  He&#x27;s having problems with
his plotter, and he&#x27;s getting them done as soon as he can. I will give
his secondary email here at his permission (I&#x27;ll ask him).

Yasin (and everyone else), you WILL get the stickers. 

Just be patient guys, he is working on them, and your stickers will come.

Hope that helps!

Mike

I don&#x27;t understand how that would happen. During the 15 second  
inspection I would look at all the pieces of the cube, and evaluate  
all pieces equally. And so would most likely the other guy.

So the idea is that not only would everyone get the same mix, but  
when they first see it they would see it from the same angle?

I guess that would make things a very tiny bit more equal, but way  
beyond anything I would care about.

Especially since everybody *would* have the same chance to get lucky,  
just like they would if every mix for every contestant was completely  
random.

I learned the last layer algorithms from Lars Vandenberg&#x27;s page.
http://www.cubezone.be/
Just click &quot;oll&quot; or &quot;pll&quot; at the top of the page. Keep in mind that on
oll you can still use frur&#x27;u&#x27;f&#x27; or furu&#x27;r&#x27;f&#x27; to get the cross, then
use one of seven algorithms to solve the oll. This is called the
3-look ll. Once you get those 7 algs down, you can slowly expand it
until you know all of them.

About the f2l, I suggest you learn it intuitively, and slowly.
http://www.freespaces.com/jasa86/intro_f2l_intro.htm
This helped me a lot. I do not suggest you simply memorize notation
for f2l, but be able to recognize how to pair up the two cubies and
insert them without having to recall a certain algorithm. Go slowly
and look ahead so you can make a nearly flawless fluid movement during
the f2l, even if you have to go 1 move per second or so. This will
definitely help in the long run!! Don&#x27;t expect to get this step down
in a week- it might take a while to get it down to 2-3 moves per sec.

Don&#x27;t expect perfection every time. Go slowly on the f2l and work on
muscle memory for the last layer. Also constantly work on looking
ahead, which will decrease your time in the future.

Have fun memorizing! lol

I agree with lars. If you really want to get the best solve you look
at all the pieces. This would just convince beginners to learn how to
solve it using colors other than white in order to get a better solve.
It&#x27;s their fault for using one color scheme, and just let it be if
they don&#x27;t get the lucky solve. I am in favor of random orientation,
because it shows who can really solve the cube the fastest, in ANY
orientation. I see everyone&#x27;s point on fairness, but does it really
matter whether someone will use a certain color (white) or whether
they will look at the whole cube to find the best starting place? They
will both probably have to move the cube around anyways to find the
pieces for the first step, depending on the methods.

the stickers). Even if I used the same silicon oil as on the DIY and<br>
sanded down the springs, they are not as good as my DIYs (and the DIY<br>
are not ever more expensive).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

I agree completely.  I own a studio cube, and I personally think it&#x27;s
quite poor.  

I&#x27;ve ordered from cube4you, and 9spuzzles, and I recommend 9spuzzles
just because they&#x27;re cheaper.  I find them to be perfect for my needs.
 They&#x27;re smooth right out of the box, and after lubricant they&#x27;re even
better.  I&#x27;d go with the black or white type A cubes.  I&#x27;ve heard C is
good from cube4you, but I haven&#x27;t tried them myself.

If you&#x27;re going to lube it (this has been said thousands of times, but
might as well say it again) use some kind of silicone lubricant.  I
recommend CRC heavy duty lubricant shown here:
http://www.idealtruevalue.com/servlet/the-41131/Detail .  It&#x27;s my
favorite.

For some reason,
http://www.crcindustries.com/catalog/images/Lubricant%20and%20Penetrant/05074.jpg
 
this CRC turned my black DIY cubes a bit white.  I&#x27;ve heard this from
other people, so if you have the option, try to get the kind that has
a black &quot;gradient&quot; like the first link.

Hopefully that helps,

Cheers,

Mike Carroll

What vendors would you like to see and what types of activities would

HOW MUCH PRIZE MONEY would it take to get you to come to Seattle, Washington?

I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re from Korea, France, Finland, Japan,
Netherlands, USA, Canada, Belgium, Hungary, Germany, UK, Sweden, or
any other country that I forgot to mention. I want to know what it

It may even be possible to pay for the airfare of some big

Interested? Please let me know what it will take for you to come down.

Thanks,

          <div class="email-content">Try starting by solving the F2L intuitively. Almost every F2L alg can 
be divided up into smaller parts that are very easily understood once 
you understand the general concept. Once you can do the F2L 
intuitively, the algs should be much easier to memorize, and if you 
still have trouble, what you can do is just learn the sequence of tasks 
that each one performs, so that you&#x27;re still doing it intuitively, but 
more optimized.
Doug Reed has a great intuitive F2L page.

Try searching for &quot;Rubik&quot; instead of &quot;Rubic&quot;. Grmbl.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

Sounds fantastic!

I don&#x27;t care about prizes or a personal sponsor.
I personally do care about:
- possibility to meet many (>75) other cubers
- a good quality field of competitors
- my favorite events (3/4/5)
- 2 day competition
- nice entourage/atmosphere
- some side stuff, like a puzzle market, informal meetings
- last but not least: my family (so please announce 4 months early at least, 
then I can plan better)
As a WCA guy I care about:
- officialness
- a good organization team (the fewer volunteers, the better)
- lots of media attention
- a good name, something like Microsoft World Masters 2007
- but not too commercial (to pay some people&#x27;s trip is up to the sponsors, 
but how do you select fairly?)
- annual event for at least 3 years
- visa arranged within a day for all countries (especially countries like 
India, China et cetera)

How can I help you? :-)

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hi Chris,

I also don&#x27;t care about the prize, but for me to go I think it would
either need to be a big enough event to justify my current sponsors
paying my airfare/acommodation, or I would need to be a big enough
name to warrant your sponsors paying for my airfare. Somehow I don&#x27;t
think I&#x27;ll pull the second one off ;)

But what you are planning sounds fantastic, and I would love to be a
part of it. If I can help in any way also, don&#x27;t hesitate to let me know.

I&#x27;d like it to be a 100% serious 2/3 day event. Not some pr jippo 
fomr some big company with only limited time for actual puzzling. I 
would need to find reasonably priced airticket. I don&#x27;t have any 
sponsor at all :-o Nice prizes would be nice. And also no 
restrictions wrt what kind of puzzles are allowed to use. And yes 
it&#x27;s not coz i use eastsheen, i want fairness, equal opportunities :-)
And finally i need to consult my bank and my wife. First priority 
right now is Budapest in October. Im already preregistered!!

          <div class="email-content">As a poor student, I&#x27;d care a bit on the prize money, but also if
there is a good atmosphere, lot&#x27;s of very fast cubers. A multiple-day
tournamt of course. Good accomodation (tournament hall and maybe
hotel?) and organisation (I don&#x27;t like to have to wait 5 min between
each solve). A bit of audience would be nice too. 
It&#x27;d be great of this would become a reality! :)

And it wouldn&#x27;t be hard for judges to try to keep all the cubes for a given scramble oriented the same but it would be difficult to guarantee.

          <div class="email-content">             hey chris, i think a tournament would be horrible especially with all the interest from big sponsors.  haha jk.....<br>
it sounds almost too go to be true but i really think ron hit it on the head<br>
a. lots of competitiors without sacrificing rounds or events based on whats is convienient for the venue or media, cubers first!<br>
b. all events will full rounds, no scimping on less popular puzzles, probably means at least a 2 day event.<br>
c. a puzzle fair like dcd would be an incredible bonus.<br>
<br>
d. the possibility of meeting cubers i don&#x27;t normally have the chance (ie YJM, and other asian cubers i will never meet)<br>
<br>
e. ease for competitiors around the world to come to including visa issues and the like<br>
<br>
f. good hotel sponsorship so maybe we can at least get cheap lodging if we&#x27;re unable to get sponsors.<br>
<br>
g. for you to tell us exactly what is going on and who&#x27;s interested :P<br>

your orders are safe, just a little behind schedule right now.

Personal issues with my family along with the equipment problems last
month have taken a toll on my shipping schedule for both Cubesmith and
my other company.

I&#x27;m planning to update the site this weekend to let everyone know the
situation.

Also in the works is a new shipping method which will provide a little
bit of tracking, at least for orders in the US, and offer better
protection during shipment.

Thanks for everyones patience,

Chris

          <div class="email-content">Thank you everyone for your input so far, it&#x27;s much appreciated. This<br>
multi-day event is in the planning for late 2008 or maybe even 2009. I don&#x27;t<br>
want to conflict with the current scheduling of the international<br>
competition. I&#x27;m just trying to gauge how many people would be interested in<br>
attending an event of this size and what accommodations, competitions, time<br>
constraints, extra activities, ... etc people are interested in having. I&#x27;m<br>
working on a survey now and when it&#x27;s complete, I would like as many of you<br>
as possible to reply with your opinions. I want to make this a<br>
well-attended, fun, exciting, and memorable experience that we can look<br>
forward to attending each year. With enough interest, a non-profit<br>
organization, and all the potential sponsors in the Seattle area, big things<br>
are possible.<br>
<br>
Right now we&#x27;re just throwing around the idea and seeing if something like<br>
this could draw national and international competitors. It would be a<br>
tremendous amount of fun and a great get-together. :)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ll post again when I have a survey so we can organize everyone&#x27;s input.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I would also like to respond:
1) Why should all competitors have the same amount of attempts? That is definately not how it works for bigger cubes, where only the fastest can attempt all scrambles and those competitions only have 1 round! I think 5 solves are enough, even at the final. We are already correcting for lucky cases and screw-ups/pops, most other sports don&#x27;t do that!
2) I would prefer a final with only the very best (top 5 or top 10%) competing directly against each other. For a big tournament like Worlds, this is how I would like it to happen:
a1) Competitors ranked 9-16 (during semi-final) are called to the stage and all their pre-inspections start at once. Off course competitors can choose how much of their 15 secondes for pre-inspection they use, so the actual start of all solves cannot be controlled to occur at exactly the same time.
a2) All times from the first 8 competitors will be shown on a scoreboard for the audience/media and 
a3) Same as a1, only for the competitors ranked 1-8 (during semi-final)
a4) Same as a2, only for the competitors ranked 1-8 (during semi-final)
b) Repeat a 4 times, and update she scoreboard to reflect current rankings so the audience (and media) can see who is in the lead

The advantage of this would be that it looks much more organized and professional and competitors actually compete against each other. Scrambling and judging would take almost no extra time.
An option would be to change the order of competitors according to their current ranking, but that would affect the scramblers because some cubers might cross-over from the second group to the first group, having to do 2 solves directly after another.

  Hi Patrick,

  Thanks for your feedback.

  I was trying to make three points:
  1) if we have more attempts, ALL competitors should have more attempts
  2) in special competitions like World Championship the final cannot take 
  ages, because we have to think of our sponsors (and therefore of the media). 
  I prefer to have more people in the final than the proposal to make the 
  final longer by doing more attempts per competitor.
  3) deciding the winner on the proposed measurements has flaws.

  Please react to these three points.

  Have fun,

  Ron

Hello,<br>
<br>
I just want to give you the info that I will soon put an auction on<br>
ebay to sell some rare 3x3x3 cubes.<br>
There are not from me Sad but from Mister WORLD RECORD of 3x3x3 with<br>
10.36 made recently at the belgian open, Very Happy Surprised<br>
Surprised Exclamation Exclamation YES ! Edouard CHAMBON himself .<br>
Actually, he has won so much prices in all events Laughing that he<br>
asked me to sell some of them; he wants to make a budget so to be able<br>
to participate to more international events this year. Do you think he<br>
wants to train more and improve so to go sub 10 ?? We all hope so Wink<br>
maybe at the WC2007 in Budapest Cool .<br>
So , the first one will be a rubik promo won last year during a<br>
microsoft exhibition in france. I don&#x27;t remember having seen it on<br>
ebay. It&#x27;s the MSN one written &quot;WINDOWS Live Messenger, le futur de<br>
MSN Messenger&quot; and with the official RUBIK&#x27;S mark on one sticker.<br>
This cube is brand new, still sealed.<br>
So if you want to make a (very) good action for him, keep your eyes<br>
wide open this week, I will post as soon as the auction is up.<br>
But that&#x27;s not all Rolling Eyes the next one will be a fabulous GOLD<br>
RUBIK cube with its own gold stand, original from RUBIK and given only<br>
as prices in competition. Edouard owns several of them and wishes to<br>
sell one of the best : the one he has won in the Belgian open one<br>
month ago for his fabulous new world record with 10.36 , I was there<br>
Smile . He has signed it Exclamation Exclamation , what does a<br>
signature of a world recordman worth ? answer in a few days Shocked<br>
So, prepare your money guys Wink<br>
Well, if you want some details, mail me.<br>
Thanks for him.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Following the Chattahoochee competition I decide to write this, and <br>
then to share with you all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is hard sometimes to look back at performance at cube <br>
tournaments.  Before the competition, I practice with an inspired <br>
vigor. <br>
<br>
I tell myself: &quot;I hope this competition is going to be different.&quot;<br>
<br>
But, different how?<br>
<br>
Not all of us produce the results we expect or hope for.  If this <br>
happens once, or twice, it is easier to give ourselves the benefit <br>
of the doubt:  &quot;I just had an off tournament.  It happens to best of <br>
them.&quot;  Then suddenly, we realize: &quot;Damn, my &#x27;off tournaments&#x27; are <br>
actually my normal tournaments.&quot;  <br>
<br>
But still, before every one, I tell myself, like others may do:<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope this competition is going to be different.&quot;<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s going to be different because I&#x27;m going to do well.  I&#x27;m going <br>
to do well because I prepared.  And this tragic cycle begins to <br>
emerge, and I feel that my efforts are not realized.  Then, &quot;I hope <br>
this competition is going to be different,&quot; turns into, &quot;Why do I <br>
bother with this competition?&quot;  It&#x27;s hard to have a positive <br>
attitude 100% of the time following failure, unless you&#x27;re not human.<br>
<br>
Then I look at the ones who completely swamped my times.  And, I <br>
ask:  &quot;Who the hell are these people?&quot;  I have competed seriously <br>
for years, and these guys are surpassing my greatest efforts after a <br>
fraction of the time.  I feel like an ounce of talent would take me <br>
a long way - or it is my excuse for these failures.  I just don&#x27;t <br>
know how they manage such fantastic results.  Ladies and gentleman, <br>
Richard Patterson is filled with a lot of envy. <br>
<br>
I would never undermine the effort of others, but the ratio of time <br>
put in and results produced seems off balance.  I often find myself <br>
fighting this impossible war against the next wave of &#x27;better than <br>
me&#x27; cubers.<br>
<br>
It&#x27;s easy to drown in these feelings of doubt in the midst of <br>
performing.  Worst of all, this horrible seed can grow into <br>
something quite terrible, effecting numerous events.  &quot;Why did I <br>
come again?&quot;  Great question.  Again, expanded: &quot;Why did I take time <br>
to prepare for, and attend to this event?&quot;  It had been just long <br>
enough since the last tournament to forget the answer to this <br>
question.  I&#x27;m glad though, I realize it at the right time usually:  <br>
<br>
&quot;I like these people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Our opponents are often our friends.  And, the whole time we eagerly <br>
applaud the same times that are going to bump us lower in the <br>
rankings.  The same ones that inspired a bitter envy often share the <br>
same sour taste of defeat.  A pat on the back after a good time - A <br>
pat on the back after a bad time.  We&#x27;re all friends here.<br>
<br>
A feeling which I would like to relate; I have had the interesting <br>
pleasure to make my 3x3 blindfold attempts in tandem with Chris <br>
Hardwick&#x27;s 5x5 blindfold attempts.  These attempts, almost <br>
inevitably, produce World Records.  And he can, and must, do this <br>
while I am in the middle of my solves.  This is annoying, not <br>
because I am blindfolded and solving - It is annoying because I am <br>
blindfolded and cannot see his accomplishment (and I&#x27;d rather not <br>
stop to applaud and risk further encouragment of my 0% completion <br>
rate for blindfold solving).  <br>
<br>
This is the first true reflection I&#x27;ve had on these feelings.  I <br>
won&#x27;t say anymore:<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope this competition is going to be different.&quot; <br>
<br>
Instead:<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope this competition is going to be the same as others.&quot;<br>
<br>
I hope that I continue to try my best.  I hope that I continue to <br>
find pleasure in the successes of my friends.  I hope I prepare <br>
better for the next one. :)<br>
<br>
I applaud the achievements of all of you.  But, I think the least <br>
important part of these competitions is that which we find in the <br>
results.<br>
<br>
Best Regards,<br>
<br>
Richard Patterson<br>

When doing a OH solve, are you allowed to put the cube down and then pick it 
back up?  Or is
this undefined in the rules?

Off course us cubers know better. Without the sharing capabilities of the internet, cubing would have never been where it is today. Tournaments are the ultimate form of our shared hobby.

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] Some Thoughts...<br>
<br>
<br>
  Following the Chattahoochee competition I decide to write this, and <br>
  then to share with you all.<br>
<br>
  It is hard sometimes to look back at performance at cube <br>
  tournaments. Before the competition, I practice with an inspired <br>
  vigor. <br>
<br>
  I tell myself: &quot;I hope this competition is going to be different.&quot;<br>
<br>
  But, different how?<br>
<br>
  Not all of us produce the results we expect or hope for. If this <br>
  happens once, or twice, it is easier to give ourselves the benefit <br>
  of the doubt: &quot;I just had an off tournament. It happens to best of <br>
  them.&quot; Then suddenly, we realize: &quot;Damn, my &#x27;off tournaments&#x27; are <br>
  actually my normal tournaments.&quot; <br>
<br>
  But still, before every one, I tell myself, like others may do:<br>
<br>
  &quot;I hope this competition is going to be different.&quot;<br>
<br>
  It&#x27;s going to be different because I&#x27;m going to do well. I&#x27;m going <br>
  to do well because I prepared. And this tragic cycle begins to <br>
  emerge, and I feel that my efforts are not realized. Then, &quot;I hope <br>
  this competition is going to be different,&quot; turns into, &quot;Why do I <br>
  bother with this competition?&quot; It&#x27;s hard to have a positive <br>
  attitude 100% of the time following failure, unless you&#x27;re not human.<br>
<br>
  Then I look at the ones who completely swamped my times. And, I <br>
  ask: &quot;Who the hell are these people?&quot; I have competed seriously <br>
  for years, and these guys are surpassing my greatest efforts after a <br>
  fraction of the time. I feel like an ounce of talent would take me <br>
  a long way - or it is my excuse for these failures. I just don&#x27;t <br>
  know how they manage such fantastic results. Ladies and gentleman, <br>
  Richard Patterson is filled with a lot of envy. <br>
<br>
  I would never undermine the effort of others, but the ratio of time <br>
  put in and results produced seems off balance. I often find myself <br>
  fighting this impossible war against the next wave of &#x27;better than <br>
  me&#x27; cubers.<br>
<br>
  It&#x27;s easy to drown in these feelings of doubt in the midst of <br>
  performing. Worst of all, this horrible seed can grow into <br>
  something quite terrible, effecting numerous events. &quot;Why did I <br>
  come again?&quot; Great question. Again, expanded: &quot;Why did I take time <br>
  to prepare for, and attend to this event?&quot; It had been just long <br>
  enough since the last tournament to forget the answer to this <br>
  question. I&#x27;m glad though, I realize it at the right time usually: <br>
<br>
  &quot;I like these people.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Our opponents are often our friends. And, the whole time we eagerly <br>
  applaud the same times that are going to bump us lower in the <br>
  rankings. The same ones that inspired a bitter envy often share the <br>
  same sour taste of defeat. A pat on the back after a good time - A <br>
  pat on the back after a bad time. We&#x27;re all friends here.<br>
<br>
  A feeling which I would like to relate; I have had the interesting <br>
  pleasure to make my 3x3 blindfold attempts in tandem with Chris <br>
  Hardwick&#x27;s 5x5 blindfold attempts. These attempts, almost <br>
  inevitably, produce World Records. And he can, and must, do this <br>
  while I am in the middle of my solves. This is annoying, not <br>
  because I am blindfolded and solving - It is annoying because I am <br>
  blindfolded and cannot see his accomplishment (and I&#x27;d rather not <br>
  stop to applaud and risk further encouragment of my 0% completion <br>
  rate for blindfold solving). <br>
<br>
  This is the first true reflection I&#x27;ve had on these feelings. I <br>
  won&#x27;t say anymore:<br>

Tournaments are the ultimate form of our shared hobby. We compete not
only against each our self and each other, but also enjoy our shared
passion and every great result.

          <div class="email-content">I only paid about $12 plus shiping. I thought that since the logo on
the white side looked like the older logo, it was original. They said
it was original from the 1980s. They probably got it at a garage sale
and thought it was. The stickers look like vinyl, not those new crappy
stickers that roll up and fall off. I hate those things. I just
ordered a Studio cube from Hungary. Hope that one is better. 
Thanks for the info.

Hi Dan!
I&#x27;m VERY interested in this but i&#x27;m only 11. It mainly depends on

Personally i think using the table for aligning purposes should be 
allowed. It&#x27;s allowed for normal speedcubing. So as long as the table 
is not used as support for twisting (faster) and &quot;table-alignment&quot; is 
not used excessively i don&#x27;t see any problems with it. I use it 
frequently for 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 when &quot;hand-alignment&quot; is harder to do 
than &quot;table-alignment&quot;! Im not a OH cuber so i might not have any 
saying in this. I&#x27;m generally in favor of liberal rules :D

1. Those cubie walls look way too thick for a cheapo dollar store 
cube.
2. It&#x27;s &quot;might&#x27;ve&quot;, not &quot;might of&quot;. It&#x27;s never too late to learn 
reading and writing correctly, I believe. Good luck!

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Personally, I think using the table for any purpose should be allowed,
no restriction, since it is used for normal speedcubing (I know
someone who can&#x27;t solve a Megaminx in competitions without a table).
Why is it forbidden? I don&#x27;t know.
If you can&#x27;t use the table, let&#x27;s be logical and forbid using the
floor in feet cubing. It&#x27;s the same kind of disability simulation.

assume they&#x27;re not genuine Rubik, since they are so cheap, will they

please correct me.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; Personally i think using the table for aligning purposes should be <br>
&gt; allowed. It&#x27;s allowed for normal speedcubing. So as long as the table <br>
&gt; is not used as support for twisting (faster) and &quot;table-alignment&quot; is <br>
&gt; not used excessively i don&#x27;t see any problems with it. I use it <br>
&gt; frequently for 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 when &quot;hand-alignment&quot; is harder to do <br>
&gt; than &quot;table-alignment&quot;! Im not a OH cuber so i might not have any <br>
&gt; saying in this. I&#x27;m generally in favor of liberal rules :D<br>
<br>
I think the reason they have this rule (and also the one-handed<br>
inspection rule) is that they want to make a one-handed solve feel and<br>
look totally one-handed - you can only use that hand, and no other<br>
objects or body parts can even touch the cube while you&#x27;re making<br>
turns. The question is, if someone said that they could solve it<br>
one-handed, and they used the table, would you hold it against them?<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I also think that it should be changed. I mean, the<br>
table&#x27;s there, why not be able to use it! It&#x27;s not &quot;one-handed in the<br>

nor is it &quot;one-handed with the help of the table&quot;.

Anyway, I think that solving using the table is not the best solution to
solve a puzzle in the fastest way.
This is does not mean that it should be forbidden but any competitor should
avoid using it if he or she wants to be the fastest in the world !

          <div class="email-content">Hey,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not sure the official view, but I can hopefully answer the first<br>
question.<br>
<br>
&gt;From cube4you&#x27;s forum, there is a post here about it:<br>
http://bbs.cube4you.com/thread-38-1-1.html .  Rubik (owner of<br>
cube4you) says: &quot;a is better than c , c is better than b , I think so<br>
but b is cheap than a and c , and with a paper box c is just like the<br>
Rubik&#x27;s black diykit&quot;<br>
<br>
Basically, A is the best and most expensive.  C is next, while being a<br>
little cheaper, and B is the worst quality (but still not poor quality.)<br>
<br>
Yes, I have heard that Ron says that C are the best.  I&#x27;ve talked to<br>
Rubik on MSN, and Finder, and they say that C is good, but A is<br>
probably better.  I have a handful of As, and I think they&#x27;re top<br>
notch.  I&#x27;ve lubricated them with CRC silicone lubricant, and I&#x27;m VERY<br>
pleased with them.  I cannot compare to rubiks.com, or type Cs, but<br>
once I get each I will take pictures and explain differences.<br>
<br>
I believe I read somewhere that Ron accidentally confused C with A,<br>
but I am not sure.  I think it&#x27;s best to ask Ron.<br>
<br>
I plan on buying Cs from cube4you and doing an intelligent review on<br>
twistypuzzle&#x27;s forum.  <br>
<br>
As of my standing right now, I was more pleased with my 9spuzzles.com<br>
order.  They come with two sets of stickers instead of one (PVC<br>
stickers, sadly not the quality of cubesmith), &quot;sticker&quot; pads for<br>
applying them squarely, and his prices are cheaper.  If you buy 5+,<br>
20+, 50+, or 100+, you get discounts for each bracket.  Doesn&#x27;t make<br>
any sense to buy 19 when 20 is cheaper.<br>
<br>
Hopefully that helps,<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; There are so many types of DIY cubes on these new sites, 9spuzzles,<br>
&gt; cube4you, etc etc. Does anybody have a really good definitive answer<br>
&gt; as to which is the best type for speedcubing?<br>
<br>
Hi Dan,<br>
<br>
I got some from 9spuzzles a few weeks ago and I was suprised how good<br>
they turn, even without lubrication. WITH lube, they are the best cube<br>
I always had (but I had not that much, so that might not mean<br>
anything). Besides, they are really cheap.<br>
<br>
On the 9spuzzles website, there is a subcategory of 3x3 DIYkit which<br>
is called &quot;Best for speedcubing&quot;. I think it is category &quot;A&quot;, which is<br>
the one I ordered.<br>
<br>
I will bring mine to German Open Championship 2007. I read from the<br>
competitors list that you will be there, so if you want to, I can show<br>

Yknow, where you might be heading with this is having 2009 World 
Championships be in Seattle. If you&#x27;re working on big sponsors and a 
big event, what&#x27;s bigger than World Championships.

Perhaps the 2008 competition could be a &quot;warm-up&quot; in terms of 
planning, media, sponsors, etc.

Maybe if you work it as a package of events (good size in 2008, Worlds 
in 2009), the sponsors might be even more interested.

just a thought,

yeff

Yes, the good type is type a).
See http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/33913

The problem was that I ordered a DIY kit of all three types. It doesn&#x27;t say 
on the bag which type is which. From the pictures on cube4you.com I thought 
the good type was type c). But it is definitely a).

Have fun,

Ron

Subject: [Speed cubing group] these new DIY cubes


Hi all,

There are so many types of DIY cubes on these new sites, 9spuzzles,
cube4you, etc etc. Does anybody have a really good definitive answer
as to which is the best type for speedcubing?

Ron told me that type C are best from cube4you, but are all type c&#x27;s,
b&#x27;s, and a&#x27;s the same on each site? I&#x27;ve heard other people say they
like type a&#x27;s better... argh im confused!

Any recommmendations?

Dan :)

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m so behind on cube emails!! The word &#x27;Australian&#x27; in the subject line
just happened to catch my attention so I checked this thread (still way
behind on many other threads).

I&#x27;m always interested in cube media/demo stuff, but I&#x27;m guessing if Dan
H is asking then it&#x27;s something in the UK? I moved to the US earlier
this year, so unfortunately will miss out on the UK cube action for now.
:(

Anyway, Dan, if there&#x27;s anything I can help with from the US, let me
know!! :)

Yeah I did mention to the guy that his best potential Australian

The event is taking place in Oz as far as I know, but unfortunately my

Where are you located at? There is a really good trophy shop by me in 
north jersey that we use for our fire dept awards. I would be more 
than happy to stop there for you and see if they have anything. Let me 
know what your looking for in a trophy exactly Bob and I will stop by.
On a side note I would like to attend the tourny but may not compete 
as my times are nowhere near comp times.

guys.  I didn&#x27;t realize so many cubers lived in the area.  A few 
years ago David Barr and I got together with a couple other cubers 
that we found out were in the area, but it looks like there are even 
more now.  David and I live in Laurel, which is Northeast of DC.

I&#x27;ve been a bit out of the speedcubing loop recently, but I would 
love to get together with you guys, especially to help out with the 
project.

Im new both to this group and to speedcubing and im planning on buying<br>
a DIY kit from somewhere.<br>
Ive been looking around and decided to buy an A version, which seems<br>
to be the best of the DIYs.<br>
Shipping from rubiks.com is too expensive, so i was wondering whether<br>
to buy from 9puzzles or cube4you.<br>
the price is little different, but i wanted to know about the quality.<br>
have any of u ever had one of them??<br>
which do u think is better?? the ones from cube4you or from 9puzzles???<br>
and another thing:<br>
i live in brazil. does anybody know which of them would be cheaper in<br>
the end?? (considering shipping)<br>
<br>
Thats it for now!!!<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

I have ordered white and black 3x3x3 type A from both companies
(Cube4you , 9spuzzles.com), and I think they are nearly the same.  The
cube structure and plastic molds seem to be from the same manufacture,
and preformed very similarly if not identically.  When I bought from
cube4you, I ordered a while ago before the website was available.  He
is a member of twistypuzzles forum, and for some time he only sold there.

When I bought them much before the website, the screwsets differed
slightly from when I received by twistpuzzles.  The little baggies
still consisted of 4 things, a screw, a small washer, a large washer,
and a spring.  The only difference was the screws were not &quot;gold
plated&quot; like they are now.

Rubik (He goes by this name on twistypuzzles; he runs cube4you) may
have upgraded to the new screws, but if he didn&#x27;t, I can not tell a
difference from them.

So to answer your first questions: I do not think the quality differs
depending on what site you order from.  I can tell you though, that
these cubes are the best speedcubes I&#x27;ve ever used.  I haven&#x27;t had the
chance to try rubiks.com, but several people have told me these are
better.  If you add lubrication to these, they even turn more
smoothly, though, lubrication is honestly not even necessary (but of
course it helps).

As far as shipping, I am unaware of which would be cheaper shipping to
Brazil.  I do know that the shipping from 9spuzzles was cheaper than
cube4you when I ordered to USA, so it might be similar to Brazil. 

The cubes on 9spuzzles are slightly cheaper, and if you buy 5+, 20+,
50+, or 100+, you get a discount on the cubes.  On the 100+ tier, the
cubes drop to 4.14 (if you have a 3x3x3 account, if not, they&#x27;ll be
4.23 or something).  Very cheap!

My overall experience was better from 9spuzzles, however.  Both were
very good orders, but I do recommend 9spuzzles a bit more.  If you
have a problem, the guy who runs the site (finder on twistypuzzles) is
always ready to help.

Lastly, I&#x27;ve noticed the white cubes are a bit smoother than the
blacks.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is, but several other people have
agreed with my thoughts on this.  For some reason, you do not need to
insert the &quot;corner&quot; caps on the corner pieces for the white pieces;
whereas on the black you do.  The white seem to bit a bit &quot;Softer&quot;
plastic, which doesn&#x27;t lock up as much and just feels a bit smoother.

Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, black is still incredible.  I would just
try a few white to go along.  I still solve more quickly black because
I can recognise colors more easily.

Hope that helps,

Cheers,

Mike Carroll

http://cube4you.com/index.php?gOo=goods_search_list.dwt&amp;gcat=1&amp;gtype= ?

Well, I *think*, just the boxes.  Rubik (owner of cube4you) posts here
http://bbs.cube4you.com/thread-44-1-1.html on his forum the difference
(although he is quite brief and doesn&#x27;t exactly explain)

He said: &quot;Just the box , M type with a nice box , for collection .

M type will for sale soon&quot;

so I THINK they&#x27;re all the same, besides the box.  If you don&#x27;t care,
I&#x27;d get the cheapest one, as I *think* they&#x27;re identical cubes and
should preform equally.  I&#x27;ll verify this with Rubik and reply with
his message.

Hopefully that helps,

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

I&#x27;ll answer both questions.

&quot;what type are the rubik&#x27;s diy&#x27;s? I&#x27;m looking for a good diy cube, but
am unsure which site to buy from.&quot;

At 9spuzzles and cube4you, they do not sell the rubiks.com DIYs.  Type
A are very similar to the rubiks.com DIYS, but they are better in some
respects.  I&#x27;ve heard that these turn better than rubiks.com, and the
center caps do not fall out without any modification.  I cannot
personally verify this as I have never owned a rubiks.com DIY, but I
can attest that these cubes are the best cubes that I have, hands
down.  I have a studio, and it seems very VERY inferior to this cube.
 I don&#x27;t think one can do better than a type A from either Chinese site.

9spuzzles and cube4you type As are essentially identical, only with
screws differing in each.  I haven&#x27;t ordered from cube4you recently,
so they may have changed screws, but if they did not, they  function
very similarly.  If I look at the picture of the screwsets, they seem
to have upgraded, but I am not positive.

&quot;Also, does 9spuzzles have any a&#x27;s that are not orange. Not that I&#x27;m
against orange cubes or anything, but just wondering...&quot;

Yes, they do have basically all colors.  Their black type A is here:
http://9spuzzles.com/index.php?gOo=goods_details.dwt&amp;goodsid=4&amp;productname=
and their white type a is here:
http://9spuzzles.com/index.php?gOo=goods_details.dwt&amp;goodsid=3&amp;productname=

When you want to order these from them, go to their homepage, click US
currency, then click 3x3x3 DIY kit, and go to page two (pages 1 and 2
are toggle-able at the bottom.

&quot;Quick question, what kind of currency do they use at 9puzzles and how
much
does that convert into us dollars?&quot;

They &#x27;default&#x27; use Chinese Yuans, but the site does calculate in US
dollars.  You can select US dollars ONLY (Yes. !ONLY!) at the homepage
on the left hand side.  So when you go to the site, select that and
then browse around.

Now, I&#x27;ve NEVER had checkout to successfully work for me.  I can add
my total things into my order, but when it tries to calculate shipping
the program tweaks out.  Other people have had this problem as well. 
If this happens, you can screenshot your order and send it to Finder
(his email is puzzles_finder@...) and he&#x27;ll calculate shipping
 and set up the order.

Lastly, if you&#x27;re planning on buying more than a few, you get price
discounts at 5+, 20+, 50+ and 100+ only at 9spuzzles.com.  You might
have to be logged in to see this, but it&#x27;s worth buying 5 because the
price drop is quite considerable.  I personally recommend 9spuzzles,
as my overall experience was very good.  The shipping was cheaper
(USA, Minnesota), and the cubes were cheaper.

I&#x27;m going to create a thread clearing up all this 9spuzzles, type
A/B/C, cube4you, Finder, Rubik, cubefans, all this stuff that hasn&#x27;t
been explained very well anywhere on Twistypuzzles and other forums.

Hopefully that helps,

Cheers,

Mike Carroll

I&#x27;m definitely interested in another gathering of MD/VA cubers.  My

          <div class="email-content">Yep, it seems that they added a couple more buttons and changed the 
interface a bit, but the overall appearence is the same. It seems to 
have date features, and take 3 memory entries.

For $20 USD, it is worth buying I think. Though I&#x27;m sure all serious 
cubers have gen 2 timers already... it would be great if someone buys 
a bunch in bulk and sells them at a tournament for something cheaper 
than $20. How about we call this version v2.5.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Per!

I have not been the webmaster, but I have heard some about what
happened. In some way the site has been used for phising, and has been
hacked a few times. The first time the web hotel agrred to put the
site online again, but after the last time they didn&#x27;t want to put it
online until the security hole was fixed. The thing i that Gustav
Fredell, who was the webmaster, didn&#x27;t know how to find/fix it, so the
site has been down since january or so.

I have mailed him a few times to ask if he could put up a more trimmed
version of the site, with basicly only a forum, but by some unknown
reason he doesn&#x27;t answer my mails. (The site uses mambo). 

So, to sum up, if we can&#x27;t get in contact with Gustav, we need to
start a totally new swedish cube site. I find this quite important,
because it&#x27;s much thanks to the site and it&#x27;s forum that there has
been so many swedish competitions and competitors. It feels like a lot
of the swedish cubers will loose their intreset when they can&#x27;t talk
with orther cubers on the forum.

Seems to me like Gustav is quite fed up with the whole situation. But 
we/you would need his cooperation to restore the site, or else yes 
we/you would need start afresh.

Just starting a swedish (or nordic) cubing forum is easy enough.

- Get a cheap webhost that offers mysql database.

- Use the site&#x27;s control panel to install a forum or install a forum 
on the site via ftp (open source php forum like phpbb or smf)

- Make the default startpage of the site point to the forum main page

Etc etc .... more can be added later on an ad hoc basis.

I know a pretty good and cheap host, but sadly it&#x27;s US based and 
won&#x27;t give a the site a swedish domain name (only the standard 
com/org/net etc ...)

-Per

PS! Another option is to simply start a yahoo-based forum, if nothing 
but a forum is needed ...

Seeing a few comments lately from people looking for local cubers, I
think I should remind people about this site:
http://www.frappr.com/speedcubers

If people put would their locations on this site, it makes it pretty
easy to find who the closest cubers are.

I arrived in Caltech yesterday and I accidentally bumped into Leyan in
the super-shuttle going from LAX to Caltech. Very funny indeed!

We could maybe try to meet all during this week (or next week). Who&#x27;s
motivated?

Furthermore, if anyone is going to drive to Berkeley on the 14th, I
would gladly join the ride (I will pay my share of the journey, no
worries). Otherwise, if some of you are taking the plane, it would
great that we all take the same flight? Who bought tickets yet?

Thank you all,
Sven

there is a winner, even if everybody DNF&#x27;s all attempts. You just 
have to take care that your name starts with letters at the 
beginning of the alfabet to win!

Actually all three guys have &quot;place 1&quot; and if you click on the 
&quot;Winners&quot; button on the page then you see all of them mentioned. So 
no need to have a lexicographically small name. I know it&#x27;s not 
perfect to call someone who failed a winner, but I wanted to show all 
events that took place in the competition and also their best results 
and if that&#x27;s DNF, then so be it.

Cheers!
Stefan

41 STM in less than a minute. Had F2L + LL-cross in 26 but the ZB-LL 
was a setup turn and then Y-PLL and that&#x27;s not the easiest case =)

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Well even there is a 2x2x2 block given, the rest of the cube is quite 
well scrambled with that algorithm. X-cross start is very easy ;-)

I don&#x27;t think we need a new scrambling algorithm. What would the fun 
be in having an algorithm always giving us &quot;hard&quot; scrambles. The 
possibility of having &quot;easy&quot; scramble is what makes completely random 
scrambles fun.

The easiest way to invent a &quot;new algorithm&quot; is to make them longer, 
like 50 or 60 turns (same as for larger cubes). if anyone thinks 
50/60 turn scrambles are long then just let Cube Explorer quickly 
find a 20/21 turn substitute :D (using its webinterface) Another way 
would be to look at pair-breaking. This was discussed here some yrs 
ago. In fact, most discussions here are recurring ;-)

Have fun!

Yeah I was just practicing on JNetcube and this scramble popped up.  I

Anyway, my LL was a sune and the &quot;good&quot; (for me) U-perm (L-R-B).  So a 
good start and a good finish.
Speaking of scrambles which give 2x2x2&#x27;s, see the best single on Ryan&#x27;s 
simulator...

Today must be a really lucky day, because I got a very nice scramble,
and a new personal record with it! Try this one out:
D B&#x27; R B2 U F&#x27; B2 D&#x27; B&#x27; D&#x27; R2 B2 R&#x27; F L2 B F&#x27; U2 F2 U2 D F2 L2 R2 U&#x27;

cross: x2 y&#x27; U&#x27;R&#x27;FR2D
1st f2l: UF&#x27;UF
2nd f2l: y&#x27; UL&#x27;UL
3rd f2l: y2 UF&#x27;UFU&#x27;F&#x27;U2FU2F&#x27;UF
4th f2l: y&#x27; UL&#x27;ULUF&#x27;U&#x27; (i left out the F at the end for a reason)
yellow cross: RUR&#x27;U&#x27;F&#x27;
oll: y F&#x27;rUR&#x27;U&#x27;r&#x27;FR 
pll skip!

All in all, it was one of my luckiest scrambles. The reason it turned
out so well was because I use a 2-look oll. My turn speed is only
about 2 turns per sec, so I got 23.84 with this scramble. :-(  Not too
bad, considering my average is still in the 30s.

Me too, I ordered two packs of white+black from 9spuzzles.
I&#x27;ll let you know out it will turn out (hopefully fast... hehe ...  
I&#x27;m sooooo
funny ... turn ... fast ... got it? ok, maybe I&#x27;m not that funny ;) )

Although I&#x27;m pretty sure that with Rob&#x27;s abilities, he wouldn&#x27;t have a<br>
problem submitting a new fast time that is not lucky. The real issue is<br>
that there are rules associated with posting &quot;single&quot; records. They are:<br>
<br>
1. You must not post a solve if you skipped a significant portion of<br>
   your solution.<br>
2. You must not post more than one record under different names.<br>
<br>
However, rule (1) does not apply to &quot;average&quot; records.<br>
<br>
(If people want this, I could add a separate records list for &quot;lucky&quot;<br>
solves :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I believe it is normal.  I think the studio cubes have a much larger
&quot;work-in&quot; period, and once they become worked in they become much better.

I&#x27;ve bought DIY kits from 9spuzzles.com and cube4you.com , and they&#x27;re
cheaper and turn much much better.  I have both, and I rarely use my
studio cube.  I&#x27;m not regretting buying it, because it makes an
excellent collection piece, and I might be able to use it in the future.

I think the pieces of a studio cube are made out of higher quality
plastic, so I think I am going to try taking the removable pieces of a
studio cube and putting them with a DIY core+center pieces (arched) so
the tensions are perfect, and I recieve the benefits of an arched center.

But yes, my Hungarian studio cube is quite poor.  The article on &quot;Make
speedcube&quot; on speedcubing.com I don&#x27;t personally agree with.  I tend
to like DIY kits by FAR over my studio cube. 

Adjusting the screws would probably help, as would well as lubrication
and working at it.  Like I said, if you use this A LOT, it might
become good, BUT, you still have the disadvantage of pops because the
center pieces are not arched (thus my DIY kit idea.)

I highly recommend buying a DIY kit from either of the two previous
sites mentioned, -- you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I think white DIY kits
turn SLIGHTLY better than black, because it is made with a different
type of plastic.  I still recommend buying black though, as it&#x27;s
easier to recognise colors.  If you read my other posts on the
questions about the sites, I describe in more detail the differences
between the sites/sellers/cubes.

Hope that helps,

Cheers,

Mike Carroll

First, I am not an expert on copyrights, trademarks et cetera.
I do know that if Nike would be sponsor of World Championship athletics, 
they would not allow fake Nike shoes. That would be like accepting that 
people make fake copies of their products. It would be hard for them to win 
future legal cases if they would allow accept them.

It is not one of the jobs of WCA to promote/accept illegal copying of 
puzzles.
It is also not one of the jobs of WCA to check for illegal copies. But if 
our sponsor for a specific competition would notify me of people using 
illegal puzzles, I think it is reasonable to disallow those puzzles.

Like I said, I am not an expert on this subject.
I do respect Seventowns and all legal distributors.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan,

>I think it&#x27;s time someone invent a new scrambling algorithm :-)
Actually last year I was thinking about defining lucky scrambles.
This was after Czech Open 2006 where one of the 2x2 scrambles was solvable 
in 3 moves.
See below for my ideas.

There are different approaches for defining &#x27;too lucky&#x27; scrambles.
a) number of moves to solve optimally
b) number of moves to solve using a standard system (which one???)
c) number of moves to solve one face
d) number of moves to do first step (for different systems)
e) number of (specific pieces of) colors per face should be at least x
f) number of faces per (specific piece of) color should be at least y
g) et cetera.

Since I did not want to favour specific systems I thought e and f are the 
best options (from the ones I can think of).
I was not sure whether these would actually help in making sure the 
scrambles are not &#x27;too lucky&#x27;.

My proposal in 2006 was:
= all 4 edge stickers per color should be placed on at least 3 different 
faces
= all 4 corner stickers per color should be placed on at least 3 different 
faces
= all 9 stickers of one color should be placed on at least 4 different faces
A similar approach would be possible 4x4, 5x5 et cetera.

Back then I was wondering which percentage of random scrambles would then be 
skipped.

Question: Would Chris&#x27;s scramble be skipped?
No:
- edges: OK
- corners: OK
- all: OK

Does anyone have a better idea?

Have fun,

Ron

<br>
By the way, the WCA /should/ be experts on what constitutes an illegal<br>

&quot;claims&quot; it to be an illegal copy. What if Seven Towns claimed East<br>
Sheen as an illegal copy? Would the WCA agree to ban it from a sponsored<br>
competition, or not? Or will the WCA make up its own mind about what<br>
puzzles are allowed and firmly stick to it?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Well, I don&#x27;t think that the pieces need to be totally scrambled in<br>
terms of the stickers, but we need to avoid certain things.<br>
<br>
For example, on the 3x3x3, since almost everyone starts with a cross<br>
or a 2x2x2 block, we should make sure that neither of these can be<br>
solved extremely quickly. For example, a 4-move cross should count as<br>
lucky  since it occurs only 5% of the time (according to the analysis<br>
at Dan&#x27;s Cubestation). And, of course, keep away from 2x2x1 blocks<br>
which involve only one center piece.<br>
<br>
On the 2x2x2, an optimal solution of 7 moves or less (face turn<br>
metric) occurs only 7.9% of the time (according to Jaap&#x27;s analysis),<br>
so it should be considered lucky too.<br>
<br>
Similarly, we might want to look for lucky first/second centers on the<br>
4x4x4 and 5x5x5 (assuming that most people use a centers-first<br>
strategy), although we should also keep away from any blocks that are<br>

A much better idea: Do nothing.

The scramble that made a 2x2x2 solvable in 3 moves should have been
kept, as I said when we talked about it.
Some scrambles generate an easy starting configuration for most
solvers. Others generate configurations that look hard, but some
competitors can be individually &quot;lucky&quot; (depending on their method or
even mistakes) and get a LL skip for instance. If someone solve a
3x3x3 in 7.5s because he has a LL skip and 3 easy pairs after a hard
cross, we&#x27;ll declare the record official. We should just accept that
&quot;luck&quot; exists.

In my opinion, a 2x2x2 solved in 3 moves would be a good thing to
prove that:
- Sometimes, this puzzle is definitely too easy, especially after a
15s inspection.
- Averages only do really matter.

I don&#x27;t want to be an expert. Even judges will have a hard time to make the 
right decisions in these cases.
That is exactly why I announced the information on the website: early and in 
the broadest definition (all non Rubik&#x27;s brands).
I do trust our sponsors.

The WCA regulations do not favor one brand over the other. It is possible 
though that for some competitions additional requirements are applied. For 
example you could limit the number of competitors.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">Hi Michael,

Thanks for your ideas.
When I applied Chris&#x27;s scramble it took me some time to find out why he 
considered the scramble a &#x27;wow&#x27;.
But at home I normally scramble with white (my cross color) on the bottom.

In general I think that all scrambles should be allowed. Like Gilles wrote 
in his message.
I made a mistake in Czech Open 2006. I could have been world record holder 
single solve 2x2. :-)

Have fun,

Ron

Well, I don&#x27;t think that the pieces need to be totally scrambled in
terms of the stickers, but we need to avoid certain things.

For example, on the 3x3x3, since almost everyone starts with a cross
or a 2x2x2 block, we should make sure that neither of these can be
solved extremely quickly. For example, a 4-move cross should count as
lucky  since it occurs only 5% of the time (according to the analysis
at Dan&#x27;s Cubestation). And, of course, keep away from 2x2x1 blocks
which involve only one center piece.

On the 2x2x2, an optimal solution of 7 moves or less (face turn
metric) occurs only 7.9% of the time (according to Jaap&#x27;s analysis),
so it should be considered lucky too.

Similarly, we might want to look for lucky first/second centers on the
4x4x4 and 5x5x5 (assuming that most people use a centers-first
strategy), although we should also keep away from any blocks that are
2x2x1 or bigger.

A fast 2x2x1 easily extendable to 3x2x1 is perfect. I don&#x27;t care about
easy crosses, but sometimes a start with 2 easy opposite 2x2x1 is a
dream! :-)
Even if we want to, we&#x27;ll never be able to define what&#x27;s &quot;lucky&quot; or not.

Gilles.

          <div class="email-content">Where in the regulations is it stated that limiting the puzzles (or 
the number of participants) is legal?  I&#x27;m not saying that the 
organizer shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to limit these things (nor am I saying 
they should), but in the current regulations, I just don&#x27;t see how 
this is legal.

For the number of participants:
&quot;8b) An open competition is open to anyone. 
8c) A closed competition may be open to:

persons with a specific nationality 
citizens of specific geographical areas 
members of specific clubs 
students / employees of specific organisations. 
No other distinctions are allowed to declare a competition closed.&quot;

So, by the final line of 8c, no other distinctions (i.e. first x 
people) are allowed.  Now, I think a reasonable limit should be 
allowed.  I don&#x27;t see how competitions such as worlds can run 
smoothly without them.  However, the regulations don&#x27;t seem to allow 
such limits.  Of course, a new set of regulations could be published 
before worlds adding this.

For the type of puzzle:
I can&#x27;t find any regulation that allows or disallows regulating the 
type of puzzle, except for:
&quot;2a) Any person may be a competitor during a competition, if he:
...
2a2) accepts additional regulations of the competition;&quot;
So I guess this does allow additional regulations to be set.  OK, I 
guess it is legal.  I&#x27;m not a fan of it, since East Sheen puzzles 
satisfy every criteria of Article 3.  However, I accept that the 
regulations do allow banning of certain puzzle types.

I apologize if this has been discussed before (I can&#x27;t recall such 
discussion), but could someone explain &quot;2a4) is not banned by WCA 
board.&quot;?  How can a person be banned?  The word &quot;ban&quot; appears nowhere 
else in the regulations, so it&#x27;s not clear if there are any 
regulations on how a person could be banned.  Is it arbitrary?  Is 
there a process through which a person is banned?  Does a person get 
3 strikes or something?  I apologize for mentioning this now and not 
in January when the rules were not set in stone, but I didn&#x27;t really 
notice this before.

Thanks,
Tim Reynolds

Most of us know that.

I am open to a scrambling program that generates true random scrambles.
Some requirements:
- must be able to generate a new set of scrambles in seconds
- must generate relatively short scrambling algorithms (not longer than 
current scrambles)
- must show the pictures of the scrambles (like current scrambler)

- must handle 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, and possibly other sizes
- must handle the other official puzzle events (Square-1, Pyraminx, 
Megaminx, Clock, Fewest moves)

- must be free to use (no fees)
- source must be open to public

- technology that does not require to install libraries et cetera (so 
similar to JavaScript)
- must run on the common platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac)
- must be able to run offline

Anyone interested?

Have fun,

Ron

Why bother generating a scramble?  Couldn&#x27;t we just generate a random
position in terms of permutation and orientation, then use cube
explorer to find a scramble?

<br>
There are N possible cube configurations. Pure randomness gives a<br>
given configuration a x% chance of appearance.<br>
Are you saying that for this configuration, the chance for it to show<br>
up after applying our commonly used random HTM sequences on a solved<br>
(or random) cube is significantly different than x%?<br>
Is there an intuitive/mathematical proof?<br>
Of course there are subsequences that look &quot;uneffective&quot;, but it does<br>

Do you have any evidence for this? If so, how many moves *does* it  <br>
take to generate a random scramble?<br>
<br>
This seems like it should be measurable. One way is to measure how  <br>
many moves an optimal solution takes, on average, as a function of  <br>
the number of moves in the scramble. Has anyone done anything like this?<br>

Yes, this is essentially what I proposed 5 years ago:<br>

<br>
&gt; Why bother generating a scramble?<br>

I have recently become interested this approach because I need a &quot;thin&quot;<br>

          <div class="email-content">One of my motivating reasons for creating the WCA was to have a 
separate body that organizes and moderates Rubik&#x27;s Cube competitions.  
In other words, for competitions that I run, I am the person who puts 
restrictions on the equipment.  I have no problem with Eastsheens being 
used in competition.  Whereas the Rubik&#x27;s Cube is a toy, the only 
copyrighted part is really the trade mark.  And whereas I understand a 
company&#x27;s right to protect their profits, I feel that we have a right 
to practice our sport how we want it.

So in my competitions, and competitions that I oversee, there are no 
restrictions on cube by brand.  If a cube is an absolute piece of crap 
so that scrambling it is difficult, or that the colors are 
unrecognizable (or have glitter stickers... or something weird like 
that), yes I will disallow that Rubik&#x27;s Cube.

That being said, I also am not amazingly rich.  So sadly to say, if I 
ran a championships, you wouldn&#x27;t be getting any prize money.  If 
you&#x27;re all right with that, then the US Championships is the place to 
be.  If you do really well and get first place, maybe you&#x27;ll get a 
sandwich.

But in exchange, you get some freedom.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s better.

          <div class="email-content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m still trying to improve my F2L while learning OLL and PPL and I  <br>
often read that you shouldn&#x27;t rotate the cube while doing F2L. I  <br>
totally agree with this but there are cases when I have a hard time  <br>
finding a way of doing it easily without rotating the cube.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
B&#x27; U B<br>
that I will usually solve doing: u&#x27; L&#x27; U L (to obviously being able  <br>
to do U with the right index)<br>
<br>
So I&#x27;m curious, how you guys are doing it?<br>
<br>
As a side question, I&#x27;m wondering if there is somewhere a good  <br>
collection of sub-20 videos with slow motion version to be able to  <br>
study how you guys are doing F2L :)<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Best Regards,<br>

The answer to your questions is obvious. Why do you ask?

Do you think I like this situation?
There is only 1 competition each year where this is the case.

Have fun,

Ron

Sorry but I have never been to a competition before, and the only<br>

<br>
Because competitors need to know what the regulations say about<br>
allowable cubes so that they have time to train on an allowed model, and<br>
do not waste money on a plane ticket to travel to a competition only to<br>
find out that they are using a cube that is not allowed by the WCA.<br>

  Subject: Re: [Speed cubing group] these new DIY cubes


  One of my motivating reasons for creating the WCA was to have a 
  separate body that organizes and moderates Rubik&#x27;s Cube competitions. 
  In other words, for competitions that I run, I am the person who puts 
  restrictions on the equipment. I have no problem with Eastsheens being 
  used in competition. Whereas the Rubik&#x27;s Cube is a toy, the only 
  copyrighted part is really the trade mark. And whereas I understand a 
  company&#x27;s right to protect their profits, I feel that we have a right 
  to practice our sport how we want it.

  So in my competitions, and competitions that I oversee, there are no 
  restrictions on cube by brand. If a cube is an absolute piece of crap 
  so that scrambling it is difficult, or that the colors are 
  unrecognizable (or have glitter stickers... or something weird like 
  that), yes I will disallow that Rubik&#x27;s Cube.

  That being said, I also am not amazingly rich. So sadly to say, if I 
  ran a championships, you wouldn&#x27;t be getting any prize money. If 
  you&#x27;re all right with that, then the US Championships is the place to 
  be. If you do really well and get first place, maybe you&#x27;ll get a 
  sandwich.

  But in exchange, you get some freedom. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s better.

I did test it a while ago, the scrambles were quite poor; often 3, 4 or<br>
5 corner/edge pairs were left intact.<br>
<br>
That is why, at the very least, current algorithms rule out certain<br>
sequences and favour others, rather than using a completely random<br>
sequence.<br>

What do people think about this?

If a random scramble ends up being only 14 moves away from solved, and
someone breaks the world record with it, is that record meaningful?

What is a &quot;hard&quot; scramble?
(Hard for Cube Explorer) != (Hard for Human Method #1) != (Hard for
Human Method #2)
If in a competition a few cubers can get 2 PLL skips thanks to
innocent scrambles, of course it&#x27;s gonna be hard to beat.

          <div class="email-content">I could be wrong but isn&#x27;t speedcubing: solving the rubik&#x27;s cube as
fast as you can from any (possible) RANDOM position? If the scrambles

not too easy. Of course, on the other hand, scrambles which are
solvable in 3 moves like in Czech 2006 are ridiculous too. Somebody
said something about a 4 move cross? If they occur in 5% of the time
we still would get some easy crosses when you would do an avg of 100.
An easy start doesn&#x27;t always mean an easy solve, the rest could be
horror too. Not that I plead that scrambles where the F2L is already
solved could be used in competitions, i&#x27;m not realy sure what would be
best...

On a similar note, I think I&#x27;ve discovered why someone said that they
did not recommend using WD-40 for lubricating one&#x27;s cube. It was the
only thing I had at the time, but it gives the cube an unusual feel
and it&#x27;s difficult to control until it&#x27;s been worked a while (say,
20-30 solves). I need to find a good brand that I can replace it with
when the WD-40 wears out.

Yes, I can suggest a good silicone spray.

I&#x27;ve tried a few kinds before, and my favorite is:
http://www.idealtruevalue.com/servlet/the-41131/Detail .  Do not
mistake this with
http://www.crcindustries.com/catalog/images/Lubricant%20and%20Penetrant/05074.jpg
because they ARE different.

Look towards the top, -- one has a black gradient, while the other can
is all red.  I believe they even have the same model number.  They
both &#x27;lubricate&#x27; but I believe that the first one does right away.  

The first one doesn&#x27;t turn your cubies &quot;white&quot; like the other kind. 
I&#x27;ve tried 3-4 brands, and this is the best.

I found 1 can at ace hardware (I bought them out), and then later I
bought 4 cans at DoItBest Beisswingers.

Hopefully that helps,

Mike

I&#x27;ve seen some on eBay recently...try searching for &#x27;rubik&#x27;s cube&#x27;,
because you&#x27;ll typically find them under that topic as a &#x27;rubik&#x27;s-like
puzzle&#x27;.

          <div class="email-content">Hey,

In my opinion, and in many other cubers, DIY rubik&#x27;s cubes are the best.

You can either buy them via rubiks.com which are official, or you can
get chinese DIYs.

Suprisingly, the Chinese cubes have gotten better reviews that the
rubiks.com.  They&#x27;re both very good, but many people recommend the
Chinese ones over the official rubiks.  The chinese DIY kits centers
don&#x27;t pop off, their molding might be a bit better, and just overall
they seem better.  I myself haven&#x27;t tired a rubiks.com diy, so I
cannot verify this, but I can verify the quality of the Chinese kits.

They&#x27;re VERY easy to put together (5-10 minutes), and you can adjust
tension with both of them (like a studio cube.)

You can buy DIY kits from 9spuzzles.com or cube4you.com . They&#x27;re both
very similar, but 9spuzzles is cheaper and sends two sets of PVC
stickers.  There&#x27;s several topics on this that you can read that I&#x27;ve
described the differences.

I recommend type A, as they turn the best and have the best screws.

If you go to 9spuzzles.com, select US currency, and find the type A
white/black/orange DIY kits and you&#x27;ll be very satisfied.  I think the
white turn slightly better than the black.

Get some aerosol silicone based lubricant (CRC I recommend), and these
things will FLY.

Hopefully that helps!

Cheers,

Mike Carroll

<br>
What I think is needed is  to measure the average number of moves  <br>
needed to optimally solve a scrambled cube, as a function of how many  <br>
moves were used to scramble it.<br>
<br>
Concretely:<br>
Generate 10 scrambles with 18 scramble moves. Find the average for  <br>
optimal solutions in Cube Explorer. Do the same for 19, 20, 21 etc.<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s say the numbers look like this:<br>
<br>
18 - 15.4<br>
19 - 15.9<br>
20 - 16.3<br>
21 - 16.8<br>
22 - 17.2<br>
23 - 17.5<br>
24 - 17.9<br>
25 - 18.3<br>
26 - 18.6<br>
27 - 18.8<br>
28 - 19.0<br>
29 - 19.1<br>
30 - 19.1<br>
31 - 19.1<br>
<br>
My claim is that these (very hypothetical) numbers would objectively  <br>
tell us that 29 moves produces a fully scrambled cube. That&#x27;s  <br>
certainly debatable as a methodology, but my instinct is that&#x27;s it&#x27;s  <br>
a very good practical measure, and I haven&#x27;t heard anyone propose  <br>
anything else.<br>
<br>
10 moves is a bit low. 100 would be much better. Even more even better.<br>

          <div class="email-content">&quot;Random&quot; or pseudo-random is a very difficult art. It&#x27;s often  <br>
considered as<br>
part of the cryptography field, and proving that you have a good  <br>
pseudo-random<br>
function is really hard. You would be surprised how many techniques  <br>
there are<br>
to find hidden patterns and predict values in a pseudo-random sequences.<br>
To have an idea about what is possible, this paper is a very famous  <br>
ones:<br>
http://www.bindview.com/Services/Razor/Papers/2001/tcpseq.cfm<br>
It introduces phase-space analysis.<br>
<br>
So why am I saying this? Well, just to point out that we could  <br>
discuss all<br>
weeks about this, unless we have an cryptography expert in this mailing<br>
list (I have a strong background in this field, but I won&#x27;t dare  <br>
calling myself<br>
an expert), it&#x27;s going to be hard to decide what is more random than  <br>
what.<br>
<br>
Intuitively I would say that generating random position is probably  <br>
&quot;more random&quot;<br>
than generating random scramble moves. But it&#x27;s just my intuition...<br>
<br>
Having said that, &quot;luck&quot; is part of &quot;random&quot;, but you have to make sure<br>
the probability of these lucks is the same or as close as possible from<br>
the mathematic values. Luck is not luck anymore if what is supposed to<br>
be a 0.01% becomes 10% due to a bad scramble algorithm.<br>
<br>
For a 3x3 cube, I would imagine something like that:<br>
- create 4 arrays (corner orientations, edge orientations, corner  <br>
positions, edges positions)<br>
- init them with their initital value:<br>
   [0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0] (CO)<br>
   [0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0] (EO)<br>
   [0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7] (CP)<br>
   [0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11] (EP)<br>
- Random shuffle them using a proven algorithm (in C++ random_shuffle <br>
() would do it)<br>
- Check parities, if parities are wrong, fix them (but it would have  <br>
to be random too... that&#x27;s a little bit<br>
   tricky. You&#x27;ll probably have to randomly choose if you are going  <br>
to fix it by swapping<br>
   edges or corners, and stuff like that. If this part is not  <br>
carefully implemented your going<br>
   to introduce a bias)<br>
<br>
And of course, all of this rely on your pseudo random function so  <br>
don&#x27;t use the one<br>
from the operating system, but use a cryptographically proven one.<br>
Also, a common error is to use modulo (%) to limit the maximum value.  <br>
For example<br>
a lot of people do: rand() % 10 to get a value from 0 to 9. This is  <br>
very very bad as<br>
it folds the probability. The following example will show you a  <br>
simple case:<br>
<br>
Imagine you have a _truly_ random function generating 2 true random  <br>
bits (and having such<br>
a function is actually quite hard...). Thus, it generates 4 possible  <br>
values, and imagine you want<br>
3 possible values.  Most people will just do: rand() % 3. Now look at  <br>
the probability tables:<br>
<br>
before:<br>
value  prob<br>
0          1/4<br>
1          1/4<br>
2          1/4<br>
3          1/4<br>
<br>
after %3:<br>
value  prob<br>
0         1/2<br>
1         1/4<br>
3         1/4<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m not explaining all of that to show how smart I am... I just want  <br>
to point out that<br>
you guys are currently discussing a really tricky problem, and I just  <br>
wanted to make sure<br>

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m sure we are beating this topic to death, but just wanted to 
coment on this post below.

&quot;as fast as you can from any (possible) RANDOM position&quot;
Yes! *Position*, which is not the same as scramble.

One such constraint that has been proposed is to pick from random 
positions instead and have a program churn out a reasonably short 
sequence to getting there.

I&#x27;ve run into plenty of things like 4 turn crosses, and I don&#x27;t think 
it&#x27;s bad to have those appear in the probablity they should be 
appearing. And there was that 7 turn 2x2 I got in Nationals06 that I 
didn&#x27;t capitalize on...

According to analysis by DanH and/or LarsV, there is a 5.xxxx% chance 
of a 4 turn cross for example. It is unclear to me that using 25 turn 
scrmables we currently use actually achives this emperical value very 
precisely. Or any of the other theoretical probablities that I would 
consider to be desirable as to produce *truely* random positions.

I believe Ryan is right, 25 turn scrambles do produce a skewed 
distribution. Some perfectly good and random positions simply cannot 
be reached at all with such scrambles. For us to be using this or 
continue using this, we just have to accept that.
 
How skewed is anybody&#x27;s guess, but I suspect it&#x27;s a little more than 
people here imagine.

Whoa! There are positions not reachable in 25 turns? Proof please!

          <div class="email-content">>From such a test we should theoretically see some asymptotic 
relationship since we sould get diminishing returns as the scramble 
length increases. From that, we can decided on a good cutoff length 
for scrmables should be. 

Although an interesting endevor itself, why use this for 3x3 or 2x2 
when we can generate random positions and turn them into short 
generating sequences so fast wiht today&#x27;s technology?

For 4x4, 5x5 maybe something similar can be used???

Depends on your definition of &quot;good enough&quot;. But probably the answer

As far as I know, all those brands are equally good. Just get one.

Less does not imply more. To think that every single cube state is 
achivable in EXACTLY 25 turns (HTM) with non-trivial cancellations is 
very hard for me to accept.

As far as I know, the known lower and upper bounds for length of the 
longest optimal solution are 20 and 27 HTM, respectively. I might be 
off by one or two moves, but when you say the lower bound is 
generally believed to be 26 or higher, I think you&#x27;re very wrong.

Correct. Please provide one then.

          <div class="email-content">On the contrary, I think it was very constructive. First I pointed 
out that you intended to do some stuff, but you failed to say how 
you&#x27;re going to reach a conclusion. Then I pointed out that when 
you&#x27;re talking about &quot;good enough scrambles&quot;, you ought to define 
what you mean with &quot;good enough&quot;.

Without these two missing pieces, I think the question you asked 
can&#x27;t really be answered, so my post was a suggestion to provide 
them. Which I think is constructive.

Ok, the third sentence maybe wasn&#x27;t. What I meant there was that the 
sample sounded too small for me.

Really? Do our scrambles preserve pairs?
I just tried a series of 25-move scrambles generated by JNetCube
applied to solved cubes. Number of corner/edge pairs I got:
0 2 2 1 1 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
-> 0,611111111 pair on average

Then, I did another series:
- At least 100 pseudo-random moves.
- Counting the pairs.
- Then breaking up the pairs to restart from a position that looks
really completely scrambled before scrambling again.
I got:
1 1 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 2 1
-> 0,611111111 pair on average

Do you really often have 5 intact pairs? Well, you should think about
changing the batteries of your random numbers generator! :-)

I don&#x27;t want to have fun with you. I&#x27;m interested in this. We should
change the scrambling method we use if it&#x27;s mathematically proven
weak. But I still don&#x27;t have the proof. Last time I asked to fewest
moves solvers, it seemed that 25 moves were good enough to generate a
random cubes.

I think that Lars&#x27; idea about submitting loads of scrambles of various
lengths to an optimal solver is good. The scrambling should at least
be random enough for an optimal solver.

Yes, I changed it to average of 10 this week.

Aha, it lives again! Next question: I saw the 5x5 average record was
broken with... an average-of-10. Used to be average-of-5. When did it
change? And yes, I ask this in public instead of just mail so that
more people become aware of the change.

Cheers!

Stefan, by the way your algorithm is 27 turns.  Not sure if you were<br>
trying for a 25 turn or a 27 turn based on your previous mention of<br>
the maximum length HTM of 27 turns.  If you were intending to write a<br>
27 turn solution ignore this last paragraph, because I missed your intent.<br>

No that was just because I thought 1+12+1+12+1 = 25. My mistake, no 
intention. Should&#x27;ve used Thom&#x27;s 10 move identity instead and do for 
example this:

F (R U2 B L U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 B&#x27; R&#x27; U) F2 L (R U2 B L U&#x27; L&#x27; U2 B&#x27; R&#x27; U) L&#x27; F

Parentheses intended to explain the construction. How did you get 
your scramble, Chris?

Cheers!
Stefan

Ah, ok. Your first nine moves already are an identity alg:
R&#x27; L2 U2 D2 R2 L2 D2 U2 R&#x27;

Probably made from (R2 L2 D2 U2)*2 by breaking a double turn, right? 
Darn, I was looking for an odd-length identity alg and didn&#x27;t see 
this easy way.

Oh and if you didn&#x27;t know it yet, this is a page you will like if

Yes, but if you try a sequence of 25 &quot;random&quot; moves, you may get numbers<br>
more like the ones I got.<br>
<br>
The reason you&#x27;re not getting those numbers is because...<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; That is why, at the very least, current algorithms rule out certain<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Stefan,<br>
<br>
Yes that is how I came up with my alg.  I was trying to find an<br>
identity different from 12 moves, preferably longer, and thought of<br>
that &quot;holes&quot; design one.  Then I just had to find an identity in 9<br>
moves, and did a little trial and error until I found U2 D2 L2 R2 but<br>
with the first move done as a quarter turn instead.<br>
<br>
As for those sites, that is very interesting, but it is a little above<br>
my head!  I see the main idea of how they are breaking their proof<br>
down into separate equivalence classes though, but I will need to take<br>
more time to try to understand this in a little more depth.<br>
<br>
Just as an interesting proposal can we find a 25 move scramble that<br>
produces the superflip?  Also can we find a 25 move algorithm that<br>
produces any one of the 86 super-superflips?  I define the<br>
super-superflip as &quot;any one of the 86 total positions where every<br>
piece is in its correct location, but none have the correct orientation.&quot;<br>
<br>
I know the superflip is a case often looked at, and perhaps if there<br>
is a counterexample to the 25 move scramble generating all possible<br>
cube states perhaps this could be one?  Or maybe one of the<br>
super-superflips could be?<br>
<br>
Just a thought until we get a better idea about this problem,<br>

<br>
Yes, but there still may exist a subset of scrambles that are hard for<br>
all.<br>
<br>
We do know something about how humans operate, and I think we can define<br>
an effective function that measures how hard a position is.<br>
<br>
A human looks for recognisable ways to create harmony between pieces.<br>
<br>
What is harmony? It is a function of how close the pieces&#x27; orientation<br>
and/or permutation are to each other, in terms of how many moves they<br>
are away from having the same orientation and/or permutation.<br>
<br>
What is easily recognisable? Usually the recognisable cases are those<br>
involving a small number of pieces that already have a high degree of<br>
harmony.<br>
<br>
This rough definition I think works across a wide variety of human<br>
methods.<br>
<br>
A simple measure of harmony would be to define a harmony() function on<br>
two pieces, and then calculate the sum of the harmony for all<br>
combinations of two pieces, or variations of this idea.<br>
<br>
I expect that harmony(cube) will be different from depth(cube), because<br>
we know that there are both hard and easy scrambles at depth 18. For<br>
example, Chris&#x27; &quot;WOW&quot; scramble was actually at depth 18, but was easy.<br>

The above is a generator for the superflip of 23 HTM, simply conjugate 
it with any single turn other than those having to do with U or L.

Another way is to take the following 24 HTM (and QTM) one:
(U D&#x27; R F&#x27; D L&#x27; B L&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; D&#x27; B&#x27; U&#x27; D L&#x27; F D&#x27; R B&#x27; R U L D B)
and have U2(blah)U2, where (blah) stands for the above and we take the 
cancellation (U2 U) -> U&#x27;.

At this point I&#x27;m sure you can all see the endless posiblities. Doing 
conjugative reductions to &quot;transpose&quot; turns from the front to the back 
of the sequence and vice-versa along with any of the possible rigid 
motions (cube rotations + reflections) should lead to a COMPLETELY 
exaushtive list. (assuming the aid of ACube or similar)

Possibly of use items I ran across making this post:
22 HTM: R&#x27; U2 B L&#x27; F U&#x27; B D F U D&#x27; L D2 F&#x27; R B&#x27; D F&#x27; U&#x27; B&#x27; U D&#x27; 
20 HTM: U R2 F B R B2 R U2 L B2 R U&#x27; D&#x27; R2 F R&#x27; L B2 U2 F2
20 HTM: U R2 F B R B2 R U2 L B2 R U&#x27; D&#x27; R2 F D2 B2 U2 R&#x27; L

Well actually, we could apply the same idea for the solved position.<br>
<br>
Can we create a list of all 25-move sequences that amount to the<br>
identity operation?<br>
<br>
Then we can calculate the probability of a scrambling algorithm finding<br>
the identity, and compare it to the probability of a random position<br>
being solved.<br>
<br>
Maybe this is easier than working with the superflip.<br>

Sorry to answer my own question, but I guess this list would be in the<br>
billions, and so listing them may not be a good idea :-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t know anyone knows a 25 turn HTM scramble (without obvious cancellations) that result in the solved state again, but I do remember a challenge a year or more old that had a 13 moves one (if memory serves me correct) as a winner.

  Intuitively this must be the case, and I think it&#x27;s a assertion that <br>
  everybody here is willing to believe. But this is much easier than <br>
  proving the other things being discussed, all this takes is finding a <br>
  single case. I wouldn&#x27;t even call it a &quot;proof,&quot; just a &quot;example/counter-<br>
  example&quot;.<br>
<br>
  Just entertain me and see if anyone here can find a 25 turn HTM <br>
  scramble that produces the identity/solved state. I&#x27;m having a hard <br>
  time finding one. Oh and by &quot;scramble,&quot; I am discounting the really <br>
  trivial cancellations and such.<br>
<br>
  &gt; Whoa! There are positions not reachable in 25 turns? Proof please!<br>
  &gt; <br>

  Less does not imply more. To think that every single cube state is 
  achivable in EXACTLY 25 turns (HTM) with non-trivial cancellations is 
  very hard for me to accept.

 Thanks for the video! It&#x27;s great! It showed me how slow my scrambling
was compared to yours.

          <div class="email-content">Ok, here is an observation that should be easy for someone to verify<br>
with an IDA.<br>
<br>
<br>
Consider the following two positions, both at depth 8 (HTM):<br>
<br>
Case 1: (B&#x27; U2 B D&#x27; B&#x27; U2 B D  -- or -- D L&#x27; U L D&#x27; L&#x27; U&#x27; L)<br>
Case 2: D2 L&#x27; U L D2 L&#x27; U&#x27; L<br>
<br>
<br>
Position 1 is reachable by exactly two 8-move sequences, and position 2<br>
is reachable by exactly 1 8-move sequence (this is just from my own<br>
head, and so someone might like to verify this on a computer).<br>
<br>
Therefore, if we were to use standard scrambling algorithm set to length<br>
8, it would be twice as likely to generate a scramble for case 1 than it<br>
would be to generate the scramble for case 2.<br>
<br>
However, if we were to choose a position randomly, we would expect an<br>
equal chance of getting either case 1 or case 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
* What this means for the other proposals *<br>
<br>
(assuming the computer verifies my answer)<br>
<br>
Even if we were to find that the output of today&#x27;s scrambling algorithms<br>
have roughly the same depth distribution as purely random positions, it<br>
would not mean that the algorithm is producing an even distribution over<br>
all cube positions.<br>
<br>
What it also means is that today&#x27;s scrambling algorithms are more likely<br>
to produce cube positions that have many alternative solutions, rather<br>
than ones that have only a narrow solution path. And this means that,<br>
given such a cube position, any first move that you make is *more<br>
likely* to take you closer to the solved state than would be the case if<br>
you were given a purely random position.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Wow that is a nice scramble!  Got a 12.60 solve with it.

If I&#x27;m not mistaken the odds of a scramble producing a solved cross on
the D face, allowing the possibility that you need to do an aligning
turn to align the edges to the centers, is 1/47520.

If you allow the cross to be anywhere the odds should be close to
1-(190076/190080)^6 or approximately 0.01% chance.  That is probably
overcounting possible solved crosses though, so I imagine my estimate
will in effect be a lower bound if not the right number.

&gt; So for each position there is around 7000 million 25 move scrambles,  <br>

<br>
I don&#x27;t agree that the fact that there are billions of possible<br>
scrambles for a position on average means that something has been done<br>
billions of times. The only thing that has been done multiple times is a<br>
move, and only 25 of those have been done.<br>
<br>
I have emailed Bernard Helmstetter, who searched all possible positions<br>
of the last layer up to depth 15, and asked him if he has any statistics<br>
on the distribution of &quot;number of solutions per position&quot;. At depth 15,<br>
there still should be a huge number of possible scrambles, and I expect<br>
that some cases will have orders of magnitude more solutions than other<br>
cases. Hopefully he recorded such statistics, or can provide information<br>
on the min and max cases.<br>

For now we&#x27;re just thinking about an informal gathering at my house at
6:30pm on Friday, 4/13.  We can order pizza or something.  This will
be a good opportunity to discuss more ambitious tournament plans, meet
local cubers, show off your skills, or get some advice for learning
the cube or improving your technique.

E-mail me (davidbarr at iname dot com) to RSVP and ask for directions.

          <div class="email-content">Store bought cubes (25th anniversary, generic rubik&#x27;s 3x3x3, ect) do
not have removable caps.  If you could remove them (it would take a
lot of work) you would be disappointed because you would not find
screws.  The generic cubes have rivets, making them impossible to adjust.

Did you read the tutorial on making a speedcube on speedcubing.com? 
If so, you need a studio cube, or a DIY cube.

I recommend getting a DIY cube.  They have very positive reviews, and
lots of guys use them.  Either order from rubiks.com , cube4you.com ,
or 9spuzzles.com .  They&#x27;re all good, but I recommend 9spuzzles.com
the most.

You can always just take apart your Toys R us cube normally and
lubricate it with some silicone spray.  That should help.

Hopefully that helps,

Cheers,

This is PERFECT.  I can see everything clearly, and it has helped a

Yeah, it was pretty funny. We didn&#x27;t get a chance to watch the whole
thing, but i checked the quality and it was pretty good (the one of
you at the table over dinner had some sound issues).  But i fast
forwarded to the end, when you finished about the girl on the chair. 
It is so funny, we will have to find a place to use it.  Great quote,
for sure.  And sure, there was some expletives, but i don&#x27;t care. I am
not a fan of censorship.  We can slap a warning on it first.

We will figure out what to do with it, but you are right, it was
hilarious. We will hook you up one way or another. Matt is in charge
of editing, but he finishing up a video for the Canadian Open first.

--> Oh, and yes, Daniel deserves congratulations. His 5x5 bld was great.

Trying to come up with a time that worked for me and Daniel was
difficult.  Coming up with a time that works for everyone will be
impossible.  It&#x27;s fine if you want to show up late.  I figure people

Thanks Dan for taking the time to make this. I just watched it. I <br>
didn&#x27;t learn anything about ce/pairing I didn&#x27;t know already, but I&#x27;m <br>
still amazed at the ease of cross solving for you Fridrich people. A <br>
few things that I wanted to comment on though. You use empty slots <br>
extremely well, much better than me. I would surmise that you have <br>
been practicing speical algs for those things. I did notice a few <br>
times when you choose a sub-optimal alg for a pairing. I also think <br>
that it s possible to capitalize on a multi-slotting opportuinity on <br>
one cases near end of the video.<br>
<br>
Curious. Do you use any sort of ZB or VH now? Cuz, on the clip there <br>
where many times when you left the LL edges incorrectly oriented. <br>
Maybe that was just becasue is was beyond the scope of what the video <br>
was meant to show.<br>
<br>
Hem..., now I&#x27;m tempted to make one.<br>

Look it up! F2L means &quot;First 2 Layers&quot;. In the context used, it has to 
do with solving &quot;the cross&quot; (look that up) and then solving each of the 
4 &quot;corner edge pairs&quot; (this too).

Also for those of you that lurk around here and never post or rarely 
post, do spend some time and properly introduce yourselves :).

          <div class="email-content">Lars has a point though. I found that post enlightening and wondered 
why I didn&#x27;t work out that simple computation myself. What it shows 
for me is that the likelyhood of a position not attainable in exactly 
25 turns (with no trivial cancellations) is much less than what I 
previously thought. I though it was mnearly impossible for one not to 
exist, but now I&#x27;m not too sure.

Still this is not a proof one way or another. I for one am eager to 
see something concrete. Proverbially, it is like looking for a needle 
in a haystack...

          <div class="email-content">Hey Doug,

Thanks for your comments :) The F2L is never ending, you can work on
it a lot and never completely master it I think. I use empty slots a
lot, to help minimise rotation, but I didn&#x27;t use any special algs,
just the pair up and insert tricks and knowing which slots they affect. 

You are probably right about choosing the sub-optimal algs, maybe you
can send me some private examples by email? I use a pretty limited set
of algs, but always try to minimise rotation and delays.
Multi-slotting, I don&#x27;t believe in it.

VH/ZB I do use, but more so on the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. LarsV and I are
investigating a new strategy for the 4x4x4 which employs a VH style
approach. However this video was just to show solves of the F2L, with
no specialties at the end.

Dan :)

I have a question about software that would allow help me to do math <br>

this on a two dimensional plane as well that would be great, but <br>
really if you plot points all in one plane this would be possible in <br>

Do either of Mathcad, Mathematica, etc. have these functions?  Is <br>

          <div class="email-content">She is correct. For doing that sort of thing, I always use 
Mathematica, and I&#x27;m sure that any of the other computational 
software packages do it as well. (Not too sure about Matlab though, 
it&#x27;s more numerical geared, but I have ploted lovely 3D things on 
Maple back in Calc III 6 yrs ago.)

The programming necessary to do what you are talking about is fairly 
striaght forward and simple. Thus, I would imagine there are a lot of 
free programs out there that do this. A reason Mathematica is so 
expensive is that it does sooooooo much more.

If I have some downtime I&#x27;ll look around for ya Chris. Dinner 
startin&#x27;...

<br>
I was looking at Dan&#x27;s video, I noticed he was solving the f2l while <br>
solving the white side. Im still new at speed cubing but ive learned <br>
the beginner method. I wanted to get faster on the f2l because while <br>
im doing my f2l, I think thats where im spending the most in solving <br>
the cube. So I wanted to learn how to solve the f2l with the white <br>
layer. Also ive seen some videos where people solve the f2l then if a <br>
white peice is missing they correct that and in the end they end up <br>
with the same f2l and white layer. Are there some moves to memeorize <br>
like, if there is a peice in a certain place and another peice in a <br>
different place you perform this move to get it into this position.   <br>
If somone could help me out id really appreciate it. Thanks<br>

          <div class="email-content">He solves a white cross first, then he solves the F2L. 
The F2L includes the white face and the middle edges. 
So you pair up, for example, a white-green-red corner with a green-red
edge, then put them in place. There are algorithims for these, you can
look at http://www.cubestation.co.uk

I know your distaste for the Rubik&#x27;s Revolution, but it&#x27;s a newspaper
article.  Sometimes, you can get pressured into saying things a certain way,
and it&#x27;s very hard to understand the implications of everything you say to
the media immediately on the spot.

If it makes you feel better, I&#x27;ll get you a cookie.

<br>
I was just playing around with my cube and I found this for this case :<br>
http://tinyurl.com/33sypo<br>
<br>
- The FR edge is flipped (with the corner solved) and the BR F2L is<br>
ready to be inserted.<br>
<br>
Instead of solving the BR pair and then flipping the edge, you can do :<br>
<br>
R U&#x27; R2 U2 R and then solve the FR pair<br>
[= (R U&#x27; R&#x27;) (R&#x27; U2 R)]<br>

Hope you like it. :-)<br>

Yeah I know. What&#x27;s more important, media has no trouble to 
innocently or intentionally misrepresent what you actually said. I 
thought this was what happened here, as I can&#x27;t really imagine a 
serious cuber believing this thing would lure other serious cubers 
much. But to clarify: In this case I didn&#x27;t mean to mock the cubers, 
not even the media (just a bit) but the &quot;revolution&quot; (sorry I can&#x27;t 
write that without quotes) itself. Anyway, I&#x27;ll try to leave it alone 
and not comment on it further.

Will you bring it in person?

          <div class="email-content">Getting 50 cubes might be a challenge, but as I understood Dan might be able<br>
to help you out. As for an easy method:<br>
<br>
I use this simple explanation to get people started. It is the basic layer<br>
by layer method and requires 5/6 algs:<br>
<br>
(I am assuming white-yellow (light), red-orange (fire), blue-green (sea)<br>
opposites. I am using white (bottom)-yellow (up) purely to make this example<br>
easy to understand. Any opposite color and cube-position will do)<br>
0) First layer: Let people figure out the first layer. If you want to teach<br>
them, this could be a possible method:<br>
0a) First layer edges: Put all 4 white edges at the yellow face <br>
0b) First layer edges: If a white edge doesn&#x27;t have the white sticker<br>
attached to the yellow center, hold it on the right side and do a move like<br>
R&#x27; U F&#x27;<br>
0c) First layer edges: Rotate the yellow face untill a white edge &quot;matches<br>
up&quot; its non-white color to a center and turn that side a half turn, repeat<br>
untill you have formed the white cross<br>
0d) First layer corners: Using the move R U R&#x27; U&#x27; (repeatedly) you can put<br>
white corners in the FDR-slot. This is really trivial, but difficult to<br>
explain.<br>
1) Second layer edges: Use R U R U R U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; and R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; U R U R<br>
to put the UR-edge in the FR and BR slot respectively. In my experience,<br>
these are the sequences beginner like the best. I like R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27; U&#x27; F (U)<br>
and F&#x27; U&#x27; F (U) R U R&#x27; U&#x27; better. You decide.<br>
2) Last layer edge orientation: Rotate the U layer so <br>
Rule1: Bad edges should be held at the UF-position (6 O&#x27;Clock)<br>
Rule2: Good edges should be held at the UL-position (9 O&#x27;Clock)<br>
do F R U R&#x27; U&#x27; F&#x27;. I sometimes explain this as Forwards FRU, Reverse RUF<br>
3) Last layer corner orientation: Rotate the U layer so<br>
Rule1: If there is exactly 1 yellow corner that has yellow facing up, put it<br>
at the UFL-position<br>
Rule2: If there is 0 or 2 yellow corners that have yellow facing up, put a<br>
corner in the UFL-position so the yellow sticker faces left<br>
do R U R&#x27; U R U2 R&#x27;. I explaing this as Right-face back and forth and full<br>
circle of the Up-face alternated.<br>
4) Last layer corner permutation: Rotate the U layer so<br>
Rule1: Opposite colors are facing you at the UFL sticker and UFR sticker<br>
do (R&#x27; F R&#x27;) B2 (R F&#x27; R&#x27;) B2 R2. I don&#x27;t have any explanation for this,<br>
except for the grouping I used.<br>
5) Last layer edge permutation: Rotate the U layer so<br>
Rule 1: unsolved edges are on the front (UF-position)<br>
Rule 2: solved edges are on the back (UB-position)<br>
do F2 U (L R&#x27;) F2 ( L&#x27; R)  U F2. Sometimes I explain that the 2 U moves are<br>
because it moves the piece in the UF-position to the UL-position, which is a<br>
U move. I then explain that if the piece in the UF-position needs to go to<br>
the UR-position they would have to do F2 U&#x27; (L R&#x27;) F2 ( L&#x27; R)  U&#x27; F2. (same,<br>
only 2 U&#x27; moves)<br>
6) You are done :)<br>
<br>
I hope this was understandable and that you and the children will have fun.<br>
<br>
Don&#x27;t: Learn them notation<br>
Do: Speedsolve it to impress them, maybe even blindfolded (a video of Mï¿½tyï¿½s<br>
Kutis 1;20 WR would do very well because he is young too)<br>
Do: Take one apart to show them the difference between centers, edges and<br>
corners<br>
Do: Let them play with it for a while after you have taken it apart<br>
Do: show them a 2x2x2 and bigger cubes also<br>

Hey everyone.  Im really really sorry that I havent responded but my
sister was in town for the week and I never had time to respond (she
thinks talking to people online is weird and creepy).  Again, Im
really sorry and I really appreciate all the responses from people
willing to help.  Unfortunately, I had a deadline for my mentor and,
being unable to meet up with any of you before the due date, I had to
settle for a relative who knows nothing about speedcubing.  But I
would still be interested in a group meeting, assuming sister approval
that is.  Ill check out the mid-atlantic meeting thread.  Thanks again.

I&#x27;ve sent several emails and have NEVER received a response back
explaining why. I&#x27;m trying to be understanding, but this is
ridiculous. At this point, I&#x27;ll just be glad to get my order. I guess
when there is only one place to go for good stickers, what else can
you do? Oh, and I live in Dallas, Texas, so it shouldn&#x27;t take that
long. Funny thing, I bought a cube from Hungary, and I&#x27;ve already
received it, and I ordered it way after I ordered the stickers.

You really meant to form the blocks freestyle, not using F2L algs.
Like using intuitiuon, to get really low move counts.

On step three youve got to get all the corners into the correct
places. Look at where the corners are on your cube, and look up on the
table, and perform the alg that is shown.

          <div class="email-content">That&#x27;s the biggest negative point about Cubesmith : customer relations.

When everything works, it is perfect.
But that really is a bad point.
I am sure competitors from Cubesmith would gain if they had good customer
relations and communications.
(just a thought)

          <div class="email-content">i think its sad how everyone is crying mutiny and being so ungrateful about everything that has been done already for the community.  granted he is a personal friend so my opinion is biased, but i think people forget what the situation was before cubesmith offered very, very cheap high quality stickers at a moments notice, usually with free shipping no less.  i think that anyone would be hard pressed to find, much less provide service that is even close to the normal service cubesmith gives.  remember, he is practically a one man operation and receives quite a large number of emails everyday regarding stickers, if he spent all his time answering these emails, he&#x27;d never get caught up or get his equipment fixed.  he did mention to people that he is in the process of getting caught up the last time he posted here, and has clearly stated his problem on the website, so its not like he&#x27;s running in the dark, have a heart people, its just stickers.

Centers should be made in the right order, if you have two opposites centers swapped, do something like r2 U2 D2 r2. (small letters mean &quot;thick layers&quot;)

          <div class="email-content">Your approach is to pedagogic. I belive anybody can learn to do 
Cross, working corner F2L (2 algs for last edge), orient LL edges (3 
cases), orient LL corners (7 cases), permute corners (2 cases), 
permute edges (4 cases).

First two steps is mosty intuition, the rest is done using a total of 
18 algs. This uses about half the number of moves the wery easies 
methods does. Algs for all the cases you can find in the set used for 
the pure Fridrich method.

Your approach is to pedagogic. I belive anybody can learn to do<br>
Cross, working corner F2L (2 algs for last edge), orient LL edges (3<br>
cases), orient LL corners (7 cases), permute corners (2 cases),<br>
permute edges (4 cases).<br>
<br>
First two steps is mosty intuition, the rest is done using a total of<br>
18 algs. This uses about half the number of moves the wery easies<br>
methods does. Algs for all the cases you can find in the set used for<br>
the pure Fridrich method. <br>

I&#x27;m in eight grade and I taught myself how to solve it using the
online tutorials. The thing that you have to teach them how to solve
the cube in I don&#x27;t know how long. Unless you think you can actually
teach them to solve it, have something for them to learn off of after
you leave. Why don&#x27;t you have the little beginners solution book for
them?

          <div class="email-content">I think I&#x27;m being very understanding. What I would suggest he do is
create an auto responder so that we all don&#x27;t feel isolated. Maybe he
is a &quot;one person operation&quot;, that&#x27;s ok. I understand. But I paid for
an order on March 20th and still don&#x27;t have my stickers. I know they
are &quot;just stickers&quot;, but my kids have 2 cubes that don&#x27;t have stickers
on them and are asking me every day &quot;did the stickers come&quot;? I haven&#x27;t
contacted PayPal to complain and get my money back. I really want my
stickers. If your friend could post to his website and give us an
update, like he said he would over a week ago. If he doesn&#x27;t want to
do the business, then don&#x27;t offer the product. As far as I&#x27;m
concerned, I will continue to wait. I just hope I get them someday soon. 

If Cubesmith is reading this, I appreciate your quality stickers (I
still haven&#x27;t seen them, but from what I hear, they are very good).
Here is a suggestion. When you get an order, set up a rule that
automatically responses to the orderer giving some feedback on where
you are (I&#x27;m 3 weeks behind, so you may have to wait...). Some folks
might be buying them as gifts, etc., and time is important.

Anyway, just a suggestion. Asking the forum if there are other
alternatives to good stickers is a reasonable request. I don&#x27;t think
you should come down on us for asking.

offered very, very cheap high quality stickers at a moments notice,
usually with free shipping no less.  i think that anyone would be hard
pressed to find, much less provide service that is even close to the
normal service cubesmith gives.  remember, he is practically a one man
operation and receives quite a large number of emails everyday
regarding stickers, if he spent all his time answering these emails,
he&#x27;d never get caught up or get his equipment fixed.  he did mention
to people that he is in the process of getting caught up the last time
he posted here, and has clearly stated his problem on the website, so
its not like he&#x27;s running in the dark, have a heart people, its just
stickers.

Be very careful, I was almost done putting half of the cube together
and knocked it down. Had to start again and it was very agrivating.

Good luck,

(for the record i did stop on my breaks, get out of the car and retrieve the cube, and received some very nice statements from other drivers)

i guess on the bright side i just needed a couple new stickers and 1 new corner cubie, where you probably have quite a mess to clean up :)

          <div class="email-content">Alright, time to admit it wasn&#x27;t all that bad. Mostly because I&#x27;m a 
slow eater, even more so when cubing, so the pasta wasn&#x27;t hot

that deep as I was cubing at a height just above the pot, though in 
front of it (I&#x27;m not *that* dumb). I lost grip and the cube jumped 
forwards into the pot.

Still very stupid and I was angry at myself. I keep telling myself 
&quot;Don&#x27;t eat and cube&quot; but then I never listen to me. And I almost 
never drop the cube, but when I do, it&#x27;s usually in a very bad 
situation.

It is pretty easy to solve the clock that way : if you would turn the
TOP-RIGHT wheel clockwise, turn the TOP-RIGHT button anticlockwise and you
will have the same effect.

          <div class="email-content">You should never just learn a single set of algorithms.  You should find as
many sets as you can.  And when it&#x27;s time to learn a new algorithm, try that
one out from each set, and choose the one that works best for you.  With
that said, in my personal opinion you shouldn&#x27;t be out the memorize F2L
algs.  I would recommend figuring most of them out on your own first.  Then,
after you understand how everything is working, go look up and replace your
slower algs.  In either case, whenever you are learning a F2L alg, make sure
to do it slowly and understand what is happening.  If you can do that, then
you can make up new ways to create and insert pairs from different angles
that you have never memorized.  Use the algs as a hint, to give you ideas
about the F2L in general.

Just my 2 cents,
-Evan

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan,

I would be interested in the statistics too.

One other thing I am not sure about is the fact that there are many half 
turns in the current scrambles.
As we all know half turns do not change the orientation of corners and 
edges.
If you consider quarter turns, then you only have a 1/6 chance of a half 
turn.
With the current scrambling programs you have a 1/3 chance of a half turn.
Could this affect the scrambling?
An easy way to test this is to take 1000 scrambles and do some statistics on 
the orientation of the corners and edges.
For example there should be an equal number of cases with 2 and 10 edges 
flipped.

Have fun,

Ron

In general, this is not true. It depends on how you define 
orientation. Your statement is true only for a very small number of 
possible definitions.

But your overall point is still valid, because since the analysis 
should result in a &quot;good&quot; distribution for *all* definitions, it also 
should for your favourite one.

Cheers!

I don&#x27;t think newbies necessarily &quot;or&quot; or &quot;are&quot; stupid. Notice I 
wrote &quot;stupid newbies&quot;. That actually implies there are non-stupid 
ones, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have added the &quot;stupid&quot;. I simply meant 
the people who&#x27;re both stupid and newbies.

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

Here are the results of 1,000 random scrambles.
The orientation of the edges was:
0 : 4 times
2 : 35 times
4 : 258 times

8 : 232 times

Is this as expected from a random scramble?

In general, this is not true. It depends on how you define 
orientation. Your statement is true only for a very small number of 
possible definitions.

But your overall point is still valid, because since the analysis 
should result in a &quot;good&quot; distribution for *all* definitions, it also 
should for your favourite one.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">There was a topic about this about 9 months ago on the rubiks.has.it forum. 
The cube lube from Rubiks comes with a disclaimer stating the origin of it. 
Basically, it is floor wax. If I lived in the USA, I would have ordered the 
biggest quantity immediately.

Incredible that the web has evolved to a place where someone could open a 
store that sells one product (floorwax) to such a limited audience 
(speedcubers). But I guess this could be said for cubesmith more or less to.

The outer limits are a bit heavy to the left. If the program you used to do 
this is fast enough, you could try more scrambles.

I think that this distribution is random enough not to interfere with both 
regular speedcubing and blindfolded speedcubing.

P.S.
(I hope normal distribution is the correct translation for &quot;normaal 
verdeling&quot;, other translations could be clock- or bell-distribution)

With perfect random scrambles, the results should in theory have the
following distribution:
0:    1    0.05%
2:   66    3.22%
4:  495   24.17%
6:  924   45.12%
8:  495   24.17%
10:  66    3.22%
12:   1    0.05%
Total: 2048

I don&#x27;t think there is any significant bias in your numbers, but I&#x27;ve
never been any good in statistic analysis.

  Hi guys,

  Here are the results of 1,000 random scrambles.
  The orientation of the edges was:
  0 : 4 times
  2 : 35 times
  4 : 258 times
  6 : 447 times
  8 : 232 times
  10 : 20 times
  12 : 0 times

  Is this as expected from a random scramble?

  Have fun,

  Ron

  In general, this is not true. It depends on how you define 
  orientation. Your statement is true only for a very small number of 
  possible definitions.

  But your overall point is still valid, because since the analysis 
  should result in a &quot;good&quot; distribution for *all* definitions, it also 
  should for your favourite one.

Seems like there is no significant bias in any of these methods, not even 
the MES+8 method. After all, 5.94 flipped edges just equals 6 in reality :)

Ron,

With perfect random scrambles, the results should in theory have the
following distribution:
0: 1 0.05%
2: 66 3.22%
4: 495 24.17%
6: 924 45.12%
8: 495 24.17%
10: 66 3.22%
12: 1 0.05%
Total: 2048

I don&#x27;t think there is any significant bias in your numbers, but I&#x27;ve
never been any good in statistic analysis.

          <div class="email-content">There is one thing that stuns me with these numbers :

&quot;Edges not oriented :
0 : 29
12 : 13&quot;

If you have 12 non oriented edges, it is the same as 0 non-oriented edges +
y rotation.
Therefore I also think there is a bias in the extreme values (the
differences in the values closer to the average are smaller even though they
exist).
However,* in my opinion*, the occurance of these extreme values 0.21% (=
(29+13)/20000) seems low enough to consider the current scrambling method a
good one.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that simple. Sometimes rotating the cube makes a
difference, but not always. Think about the superflip position, no
matter which way the cube is oriented all edges are incorrectly oriented.

That is a quick conclusion!

This is only the edge orientation. Have you looked into the corner 
orientations and the permutations and the combinations of orientations and 
permutations? Please give me your results.

Excellent example, somewhat also underlining what I mentioned before, 
that there are several definitions of orientations. And that before 
talking about results at all, people should tell which definition 
they&#x27;re using. Then something like the above wouldn&#x27;t have happened.

Cheers!

Yes =)

The idéa was to try if the MES turns made the scrambles more 
complicated and I think it did. That was why I used a rather low 
number of random turns.

The only part that was a little more easy to solve than normally was 
the cross, thge rest is wery much the same.

So, if you like hard scrambles, do a normal 25 turn random but insert 
a M2 E2 S2 somwhere, at a random point inside the scramble.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

1 - Make intelligent scrambler that looks at pair-breaking and has a 
non-skewed mix of turning all faces and not too many consecutive 
turns about same axis (larger cubes)

2 - Make very long normal random scrambles. Spend a few secs coming 
up with a sub 25 turn solution (to that long scramble) using 
Reid/Kociemba 2-step algorithm.

These points have been mentioned before, im just repeating them.

Personally i don&#x27;t mind if we set world records with an &quot;easy&quot; 
scramble. Im more interested in fairness during competitions!

          <div class="email-content">Hi (my first post),
I actually calculated the exact statistics for EP, CP, EO, and CO:
http://cube.garron.us/BLD/probabilities.htm
CO is weird with only eight corners...

I also ran statistics on 100-turn scrambles for all four categories. I would 
redo those with 25 turns, but I can&#x27;t, right now...

Yeah, I think you&#x27;re taking this a bit far here.  Doesn&#x27;t matter to me
what kind of &#x27;pro&#x27; he is or what his 5x5x5 times are.  If the prices
are reasonable, I actually get the product that I pay for, and it is
what it claims to be then that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important.

Now if you want to get into the discussion about whether Rubik&#x27;s lube
is better than plain silicone then that&#x27;s another matter, and _if_ I
were to blindly take someone&#x27;s opinion THEN maybe I&#x27;d want to know how
many years he&#x27;s been cubing.  But since I&#x27;ve tried both lube types I
don&#x27;t need to read random web sites for that as I&#x27;ve already formed my
own opinion.

Just my $0.02.

          <div class="email-content">ok well custom logos have a different timeframe then normal stickers, there has to be at least 5 people or so that want them before he can produce them otherwise he looses money on them.  the cubesmith email was down for while because it was full of people asking where their stickers were.  the email should be functioning normally now, there isn&#x27;t an alternate email address, i just called him, but if you try again you should receive a response sometime this week.<br>

          <div class="email-content">My conclusion was only about edge orientation. I only do math at problems 
that I suspect to have an interesting (practical) outcome. I don&#x27;t even 
consider the current method of scrambling a problem. If I were the organiser 
of a competition, I would focus more on the question &quot;How can we check if 
the scrambles have been performed correctly by the scramblers&quot;. I have seen 
clocks at competition that were only scrambled half and have had very 
difficult crosses that everyone was telling me had 4 moves only. I have been 
a scrambler at many competitions and all scramblers try and do the best they 
can, but sometimes they fail.

I currently don&#x27;t do any advanced math like this on the cube. I focus on 
making tutorials and helping beginners get started. And of course I organize 
weekly competitions. I do this mostly on the rubiks.has.it - forum.

Hi Arnaud,

That is a quick conclusion!

This is only the edge orientation. Have you looked into the corner
orientations and the permutations and the combinations of orientations and
permutations? Please give me your results.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">You may trust Stefan and you may trust me. Here is the source code of 
the Random Cube implementation in Cube Explorer:


procedure TForm1.ButtonRandomClick(Sender: TObject);
var c: CubieCube;
begin
  repeat
    c:=CubieCube.Create(Random(40320-1),Random(2187-
1),Random(479001600-1),Random(2048-1));
    if (c.CornParityEven and not c.EdgeParityEven) or
       (not c.CornParityEven and c.EdgeParityEven) then begin c.Free; 
c:=nil;end;
  until assigned(c);
  fCube.SetFacelets(c);
  FacePaint.Invalidate;
  c.Free;
end;

The first random number &lt;40320=8! gives the corner permutation, the 
second &lt;2187=3^7 the corner orientation, the third &lt;479001600=12! the 
edge permutation and the last &lt;2048=2^12 the edge orientation.
Because the overall parity has to be even, the extra code is 
necessary which ignores cubes with odd overall parity.

Btw., under Edit|Add Random cubes... you can produce as many random 
cubes as you like together with their generators with a few 
mouseclicks.

Is it not possible to write it like this?

     if (c.CornParityEven != c.EdgeParityEven) then

Ok I take those, and apologize. Guess I get a bit emotional when

if (c.CornParityEven &lt;> c.EdgeParityEven)... is possible. Thanks. In 
C everything this possible (C does not have a boolean data type) but 
I was not sure if it is possible to compare true and false in Delphi.

I forgot to say that with &quot;Edit|Add random cubes...&quot; the cubes are 
added (100.000 cubes in about 3 seconds ;-) ), but the maneuvers are 
not computed. To do this you could select these cubes (with 
mouseclick and shift-mouseclick in the usual windows way) and use Run|
Start Search for selected cubes. But I would not recommend to start 
more than 100 threads at the same time.
A better way is to use &quot;Run|Start Autrun for Two Phase Solver&quot;. 
Before doing so you should control the parameters in &quot;Options|Two 
Phase Algorithm...&quot;. I would recommend &quot;Stop Automatic Search at&quot; 20 
moves here and a &quot;Autorun trigger Time&quot; of 0.3 s. So you will get 
about 200 maneuvers per minute and the generator lenght will be &lt;= 20 
moves (hopefully). The 100.000 cubes will be finished in less than 9 
hours  which will give you enough cubes to solve for a few years....

          <div class="email-content">Hi Herbert!

First, thanx for adding the ability to ignore errors (impossible cube 
states) in the facelet editor.
I would like to add a request to the add random cubes feature. Add a 
checkbox to specify whether we want to come up with generator for 
each of the random cubes. As it is now we must click the run buttons 
to start generating. This is a bit tedious when making up 12 
scrambles for an average session for instance :-)

Best wishes!

Yes, with &quot;Run|Start Autorun for Optimal Solver&quot;.

The built-in webserver has to respond within a few seconds. You 
cannot wait lets say 10 minutes for a web request to be fullfilled. 
So the optimal solver is not usefull for this purpose.

One could in theory run a private webserver only allowing clients

Cube Explorer itself acts as its own webserver, no? Running on 
127.0.0.1 by default? At least a while ago that was how it worked, I 
think.

I implemented the webinterface for people who want to build a rubik&#x27;s
cube robot and it is not very impressive if the robot sits there doing
nothing for maybe half an hour. I am sure you already know the Rubot

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkft2qaKv_o

One more hint when solving 100.000 random cubes: Enable &quot;Options|Free
threads immediatly&quot;, else CE will not free the threads for the cubes.
Windows does not like CE to have 40.000 handles open so CE would crash
before completing the job

I tried that now and oh my this is so beautiful when I see it solve 
cube after cube like bam bam bam bam... three cubes a second. I 
cleared the main window and added more cubes again several times, 
just to watch this.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there a way to generate thousands of cubes and then have them solved <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; optimally?<br>
<br>
&gt;Yes, with &quot;Run|Start Autorun for Optimal Solver&quot;.<br>
<br>
That way you generate 1 cube, then let it be solved, generate another one, <br>
then let that one be solved, etc. I am looking for a way to input scrambles <br>
from my own generator (via batch-file, or internal-webserver), have Cube <br>
Explorer solve them optimaly, and then analyze the results (in Cube Explorer <br>
or in my generator program).<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it possible to get an optimal result from the built-in webserver? <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe I could pass some options to Cube Explorer through <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; querystring-parameters?<br>
<br>
&gt;The built-in webserver has to respond within a few seconds. You cannot wait <br>
&gt;lets say 10 minutes for a web request to be fullfilled. So the optimal <br>
&gt;solver is not usefull for this purpose.<br>
<br>
We have had a discussion about this in the past. I wanted the webserver to <br>
respond as soon as possible, but you changed it to run for at least 1 <br>
second. (I was focussing on Two-Phase-Analysis then).<br>
Now you are saying that the webserver has to respond within a few seconds, <br>
but that is not a requirement for my use. I think it would be great if there <br>
was a webserver that you could feed scrambles and that would return optimal <br>
solves. I would even be willing to host such a server for free as I have <br>
done for the Two-Phase-Analysis before.<br>
<br>
I hope you change your mind about this. I think people want to use the <br>
&quot;solving power&quot; of Cube Explorer in ways that you haven&#x27;t thought of. <br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Russ,

I&#x27;d say it depends on the crack.  I&#x27;ve had cracks before and sometimes
they are very serious and sometimes they aren&#x27;t at all.  One of my
best ever speedcubes, that I&#x27;ve since retired but for another reason,
was cracked and I didn&#x27;t notice it for a long time.  There was cube
dust in the crack and it obviously had built up for some time but the
cube still turned great.

I&#x27;ve also had cracked cubes where the whole center piece on my cube
fell off during a pop because a big piece of plastic around the crack
just broke off.

I&#x27;d say it depends on the crack.  The only cubes I&#x27;ve ever had
disintegrate on me were studio cubes that were cracked.  My good cube
that was cracked was a rubiks.com one and it lasted for a while.

This isn&#x27;t to say all situations are like mine, but that is what
happened to me in case that helps.

I would strongly recommend not to ever drop your cube though ;-)

WHAT!? You can&#x27;t just compare the median or mean value. There are 
statistical tests involved to determine the &quot;confidence values&quot; and 
stuff. The entire distribution should be looked at as a whole. This 
isn&#x27;t terribly complicated to do for a person with good technical 
background (maybe to do right though).

I forgot the specifics involved, and the idea of cracking open a 
textbook these days isn&#x27;t very appealing since I&#x27;m preping for the 
NJ tourn., so maybe someone here can run the tests.

          <div class="email-content">Would it really make much of a difference? In picking out each turn 
in the sequence of 25, there is no bias for one axis/face over any 
other. I am not convinved it matters as long as one is being 
consistant.

I&#x27;m sure there is a definition that is more suitable to the cube&#x27;s 
symmetry. However, I assume he&#x27;s using one of the definition used by 
most BLD cubers, and thus the numbers would be more insightful to 
judge quality of scrambles for BLD rounds. (If the definition does 
make a difference.)

The axis/face argument sounds a bit like you&#x27;re thinking about 
orientation definitions you get by rotating and mirroring the cube. I 
meant the whole set of 4,478,976 different straightforward 
orientation definitions for the 3x3, and they don&#x27;t just differ by 
rotating/mirroring the cube.

But like I said before, since the analysis should show a good 
distribution for *all* definitions, it should also do so for just 
one. If your favorite definition already proves to be a 
counterexample, you can conclude the scrambling method is bad. If it 
doesn&#x27;t, you can&#x27;t really conclude much. Only that your definition 
didn&#x27;t prove the method bad. Another one might, though.

> (C does not have a boolean data type)

C++ added a boolean type (bool) several years ago along with constants
true and false. And, as I found out from Wikipedia, more recently a
newer C standard was defined (although existing C compilers may or may
not support that standard) that also supports a boolean type (_Bool)
along with a standard header (stdbool.h) file that defines a macros so
you can use the C++ name (bool) along with true and false. 

> if (c.CornParityEven &lt;> c.EdgeParityEven)... is possible.

You could also pick a number in the range 0..(239500800-1) for the
edge permutation, and then convert it to a number in the range
0..(479001600-1) in such a way that the edge permutation and corner
permutation is the same. When I did my God&#x27;s algorithm calculation for
the permutations of the cubies (ignoring orientation), I used
0..(239500800-1) to represent the edge permutations. I converted this
number into the range 0..(479001600-1) by doubling the number, and
then adding 1 if necessary to make the edge parity match the corner
parity.

My method for converting the edge permutation into a number in the
range 0..(479001600-1) was such that the least-significant bit of the
number indicated which of the last two edge positions had the
higher-numbered cubie. Since swapping the edge cubies in the last two
edge positions (or any two cubies for that matter) changes the parity,
it is guaranteed that one of these positions is even and the other
odd. I used a 239500800-bit lookup table to determine which was the
even one and which was the odd one. You might not want to &quot;waste&quot; 30
million bytes in Cube Explorer for such a lookup table, but for my
God&#x27;s algorithm calculation, it was important to speed up the code as
much as possible.

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

I thought I would call attention to another aspect of scrambling and
randomness of scrambles that seems to be overlooked in this overall
discussion. Pseudorandom number generators generally have a fixed
number of states. If you are using a pseudorandom number generator in
a straightforward fashion, the number of different cube states that
can be generated will be less than or equal to the number of states in
the pseudorandom number generator.

The typical pseudo-random number generators available in computer
languages generators have rather poor randomness characteristics. The
compiler I use seems to have rand() function that repeats every 2**31
(or 2147483648) invocations. This means that at most 2147483648
different scrambles would be generated no matter how many scrambles
you tried to generate. Thus, only about 1 in every 20 billion (20E+09)
3x3x3 cube positions (at best) will be generated using all possible
2147483648 initial states of this pseudorandom number generator. If
you generate a few thousand scrambles, you might get what looks to be
a true random sampling of cube positions. But if you generate several
billion scrambles, you will get many duplicates while never getting
many other cube positions.

If you really want the scramble algorithm to produce any of the
possible puzzle positions with (nearly) equal probability, you
basically need to use a pseudorandom number generator with several
times more states than the number of puzzle positions.

          <div class="email-content">This applies if you try to just generate a single number  and derive  
a cube state from it. So don&#x27;t do that!

It has no impact of methods like generating 25 random moves as a  
scramble, or generating a random position and orientation for each  
piece. Since if you generate 25 random moves, you generate 25 random  
numbers, rather than one.

I just thought I would mention that I already have an FAQ section on
my website - www.cubestation.co.uk - which people can submit questions
to and answer any that they can.

But nice work :)

lived/lives in Kalmazoo, but he&#x27;s in AA for school - freshmen I 
think. Basing purely on number of competitions a cuber attends, he&#x27;s 
not terribly serious of a cuber I guess. I however am (mediocrely 
so, now that standards are so high) serious about cubing.

Chi? Oh Chicago! gosh, never heard it called that. Um, I&#x27;m going to 
be in Detroit for a couple weeks I guess. I will be taking a week in 
NY/NJ for the Rutgers though.

It is dissapointing that I&#x27;m the only cuber in the Detroit metro 
area. There used to be an Andy B. though, but he dropped off the map 
a couple years ago and I never meant him other then at Toronto and 
possibly one more tourn.

I don&#x27;t know anythign abut you though. What are your times and how 
long have you been cubing? What events do you do? Which tournaments 
have you been to and/or are planning on attending?

          <div class="email-content">Hi folks,<br>
<br>
I recently dug out my copy of Rubik&#x27;s Games and started<br>
playing with it again. It got me thinking about <br>
what new Rubik&#x27;s programs you folks were using.<br>
<br>
I haven&#x27;t been keeping track of new programs as much<br>
as I used to and it would be interesting to hear<br>
what programs you guys have been using for timing<br>
yourselves on higher order cubes.<br>
<br>
Here is one you may not be aware of by Ken Silverman<br>
(of Duke Nuke &#x27;Em fame) and Ben Jos Walbeehm which <br>
only appeared recently:<br>
<br>
http://advsys.net/ken/download.htm?#rubix<br>
<br>
I have tried it using cedega so I can report it<br>
works well enough to be usable under Linux <br>
although it is a Windows program. Evidently you<br>
can go all the way up to 64x64x64 :)<br>
<br>
If you have written a Rubik&#x27;s program I would <br>
be interested in hearing about it. I have an<br>
on-going historical interest in cube programs<br>
which I have listed at: http://cubeman.org/cubesoft.html<br>
(I realize it is out of date).<br>
<br>
There was another older program called &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Algebra&quot;<br>
which was mentioned on the old cube-lovers list <br>
many moons ago which I never managed to track down.<br>

          <div class="email-content">You should have listed you times.

But in general, if you are truly serious about cubing and can imagine 
yourself cubing a year from now still, then I would recommend getting 
a speedstack timer. Go to the speedstacks website for it, and be sure 
to get one with a port that connects to a large audience display, also 
I recommend getting it without the mat and it would then be only $20 
plus shipping the last time I checked. (I bought one when it was $50 :
( .)

It&#x27;s like generation 2.5 now it seems...

Another thing to do is get JNetCube by Hunt on the strangepuzzle site. 
That keeps track of avarages for you, and it generates scrmables of 
the offical format. For quick single attempts, I still like to use 
Ron&#x27;s v2 timer since it has huge bright numbers. That is a web-based 
java-applet that can be saved and run locally.

There are many other options out there for a computer-based timer as 
well of course. You have to search around, especially cuber&#x27;s links 
pages.

The reason to get the stackmat timer is that they are incredibly 
portable - very good for long plane trips for instance.

I&#x27;m still pretty okay with using a wrist-watch though, but technically 
those times are no good according to most rules for unoffical times 
now. It should time to the hundredths of course.

Well, hope that helps!

Just to add the the list, here&#x27;s something really obscure... A few 
grad students at UMich in the Winter of 06 did a program for EECS 
570 class that allowed distributed computing and/or parallel 
computing (imagine a big room of computers on a LAN some of which 
being multi-core...) to determine a list of optimal solutions to 
cube states. It might have been for both 3x3 and 4x4, I know very 
few of the details but was consulted once or twice. I should have 
the guy post the program somewhere.

False!

A pseudorandom number generator is not a true random number generator.
If you call it enough times the sequence of returned values start
repeating. It&#x27;s like when you divide 1 by 7 and look at the decimal
digits of the result. At first the digits may look like a random
sequence, but very soon the digits start repeating. In the same way,
pseudorandom number generators eventually repeat their sequence.

Let&#x27;s say you have a scramble-generating function that calls the
pseudorandom number generator function 25 times, once for each move in
a 25-move scramble sequence. If you call this function many, many
times, eventually you will be calling it when it is at the same point
in the cycle of numbers as the first time the scramble-generating
function was called. You will get the same sequence of 25 &quot;random&quot;
numbers, and as a result, the same scramble sequence. The rand()
function I use appears to have a cycle of 2147483648, and since 25 and
2147483648 are relatively prime, you would expect that it would take
2147483648 calls to the scramble-generating function before it starts
repeating the sequence of scrambles.

As for choosing a single number for a random sequence, the rand()
function that my compiler has returns a 15-bit value. The number of
positions in the Rubik&#x27;s cube is a 66-bit number, so that rand()
function would have to be called at least 5 times to generate enough
bits for an arbitrary cube position. If your scramble function only
calls the pseudorandom number generator function once, you would only
get 32768 different values, limiting you to 32768 cube positions, and
that is much worse than ~2 billion positions, of course. But both
32768 and 2147483648 are much smaller than the number of positions in
Rubik&#x27;s cube.

You could try playing games like reseeding the pseudorandom number
generator from time to time, but I would say it would be better to use
a better pseudorandom number generator with known characteristics,
rather than trying to play such games.

          <div class="email-content">&gt; I&#x27;d be interested in trying it out, it is a good price I think. <br>
&gt; (Though I still suspect the guy is making a good profit.)<br>
<br>
Was wondering where all these hits were coming from, so decided to pop<br>
over and see what was being said.  Yes, I own the site in question.<br>
<br>
To address some of the points that you raised:  It is in fact the same<br>
thing as what is in the syringes.  If you&#x27;ve ever accidentally<br>
squirted way too much out and had it leak out of the cube all over<br>
your hands (easy to do with those darn things at first), you know it<br>
has a _very_ distinctive feel and scent.  It is unmistakeably the same.<br>
<br>
Yeah, the site isn&#x27;t the best looking thing in the world.  This is<br>
just a hobby, certainly not a business by any stretch of the<br>
imagination.  You will in fact receive what you order, but being a<br>
hobby it may take a day or two before it is actually shipped.  <br>
<br>
I&#x27;m glad you find the current prices acceptable.  What you may be very<br>
surprised about though is this is currently being sold at near ZERO<br>
profit as a short term experiment.  (More historical data == more fun<br>
number crunching).<br>
<br>
You have to realize all the costs involved which you may overlook at<br>
first glance.  First, liquid is very heavy.  And weight equals high<br>
shipping costs to get the stuff in the first place.  Empty HDPE<br>
bottles and tops cost money, and it ain&#x27;t measured in pennies.  Can be<br>
as much as $0.50 each for the larger sizes.  Ah, and of course those<br>
have to be shipped too.  Bandwidth costs money.  PayPal charges fees<br>
on incoming payments.  Add to that labels, boxes, packing material, etc.<br>
<br>
What some companies like to do is have low product prices but then<br>
pass on all costs to the customer in the form of grossly inflated<br>
shipping.  Since you usually don&#x27;t see this until the last step of the<br>
checkout process I think that is underhanded and refuse to do so.<br>
<br>
Also the web is no longer a &quot;build it and they will come&quot; playing<br>
field.  Even for a hobby site, if you want visitors you must usually<br>
pay for them, at least for a few months.  Let&#x27;s look at hypothetical<br>
site example:  The absolute minimum cost per click is usually around<br>
$0.05.  With a conversion rate of say 3%, when you go to site XYZ and<br>
order something, they may well have paid over $1.67 just to get you to<br>
the site.<br>
<br>
I think you can start to see how one tiny little bottle can exceed a<br>
few dollars in actual cost NOT EVEN INCLUDING the cost of the actual<br>
liquid itself.  Sure, if I wanted to invest several thousand dollars<br>
and get some things by the crate I would save a marginal amount in<br>
costs.  But being just a hobby I am not prepared to do that.<br>
<br>
So I do have to chuckle when I read comments on other forums talking<br>
about &quot;big time profit&quot;.  How many of you would spend 10 minutes<br>
filling up a bottle, packing it in a box, and printing a shipping<br>
label for less than a dollar profit?  Not many, to be sure.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you&#x27;d like to give the lube a try just pop on over and I&#x27;ll<br>
get some out to you.  At the current prices you don&#x27;t have much to<br>
lose either way.<br>

This is not my concern, my concern is that the website says
&quot;Once I have received payment, I will contact the buyer for the  
information on the Artwork&quot;

but he never contacted me back about it.
That&#x27;s all.
I didn&#x27;t complain about delays and so on, just the fact that I paid  
and he didn&#x27;t even contact
me back about my order to at least discuss the custom logo.

people until completion of services. In fact, thinking back to when I <br>
did that custom logo thing, I was a bit irked by it too.<br>

I guess I shouldn&#x27;t just pick on him specifically. In general (unless <br>

&gt;  I&#x27;ll sure be contributing entries!<br>
<br>
Cool :-)<br>
<br>
There are some brief instructions on this page:<br>
<br>
    http://oosan.ryanheise.com/Help:Contents<br>
<br>
To keep the database cleanly structured, we (the editors) should also<br>
try to express questions in a consistent way. For example, while the<br>
average user may refer to the cube as &quot;3x3x3&quot; or &quot;3x3x3 cube&quot; or &quot;cube&quot;<br>
or &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot; and the oracle will do its best to figure out what you<br>
mean, it is important that editors themselves don&#x27;t write &quot;the 3x3x3&quot;<br>
sometimes and &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot; other times. I have been following the<br>
convention of always referring to the cube by its full name &quot;Rubik&#x27;s<br>
Cube&quot; when formally entering the question into the database. We will<br>
need similar conventions for &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, there are other basic conventions (for editors):<br>
<br>
- Questions must begin with an uppercase letter.<br>
- Questions must end with a question mark (?).<br>
- The word &quot;I&quot; must be uppercase.<br>
- Proper nouns and certain trademarks should begin with an uppercase<br>
  letter.<br>
<br>
The average user need not concern themselves with these, however.<br>

Hi Doug,

Yes, basically all of the above and add God&#x27;s Algoritm calculations
too.

I just found Ryan Heise&#x27;s simulator and it looks very interesting.
All facelets visible without having to turn the cube.

On the down side it seems that www.oinkleburger.com and
androsoft.com are no longer with us.

I think Dik Winter did some calculations using multiple cpus quite
a while ago. Can&#x27;t remember any details about the language used.
I&#x27;ll try to dig up more details. Do you know any other details
about the UMich project?

I implemented the webinterface for people who want to build a rubik&#x27;s
cube robot and it is not very impressive if the robot sits there doing
nothing for maybe half an hour. I am sure you already know the Rubot

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkft2qaKv_o

One more hint when solving 100.000 random cubes: Enable &quot;Options|Free
threads immediatly&quot;, else CE will not free the threads for the cubes.
Windows does not like CE to have 40.000 handles open so CE would crash
before completing the job

1. Generate all the possible cube states (43........)
2. Have a program to select randomly one of these states

So instead of &quot;generating cubes&quot;, the cubes would already be generated and
for each of these states a scramble of whatever how many moves could be
used.

What do you think ?

Are you willing to sell me your harddisk you want to use to store 
this data. I will make you a fair price ;-)
Do you really want to store all cube positions? Or do you omit the 
solved cube position and maybe all positions with generator length 
less than 10? This is a serious question: How much randomness 
do you really allow for your scrambles?
A bit addicted with this problem I generated with my program 1 
million random cubes two days ago and advised my program to solve 
them with the suboptimal solver and not to stop before the maneuver 
length is &lt;= 20 moves. Here are the *suboptimal* maneuver length 
results:

13f:      4
14f:     18
15f:     81
16f:    609
17f:   3893
18f:  23411
19f: 141366
20f: 830618

So you see it is not difficult to produce random cubes which need 13 
moves or less. Would you sort these out then?
Btw.: The zipped file with the million maneuvers is 15 MB. So a 
&quot;smaller&quot; version of your intended program could just select one of 
the generators in such a database.

Herbert

Which had to be expected. I think in a million random cubes, about 
three should be expected to be solvable in 13 moves or less. Those 
four you found with 13f, can you please find out their optimal 
solution lengths?

Cheers!

I don&#x27;t quite see the difference from generating a number (between 0  
and 43.....)
which represents one state.

          <div class="email-content">Ron posted the results of random scrambles a few days ago, looking <br>
how many edges were flipped:<br>
<br>
&gt; Here are the results of 20,000 random scrambles sequences of 25<br>
&gt; moves (1 in 3 moves in a half turn).<br>
&gt; 0: 28 0,14%<br>
&gt; 2: 701 3,51%<br>
&gt; 4: 5095 25,48%<br>
&gt; 6: 8950 44,75%<br>
&gt; 8: 4590 22,95%<br>
&gt; 10: 627 3,14%<br>
&gt; 12: 9 0,05%<br>
&gt; Average: 5.929<br>
<br>
Jaap gave the theoretical distribution:<br>
<br>
&gt; With perfect random scrambles, the results should in theory have the<br>
&gt;following distribution:<br>
&gt; 0: 1 0.05%<br>
&gt; 2: 66 3.22%<br>
&gt; 4: 495 24.17%<br>
&gt; 6: 924 45.12%<br>
&gt; 8: 495 24.17%<br>
&gt; 10: 66 3.22%<br>
&gt;12: 1 0.05%<br>
&gt; Total: 2048<br>
<br>
The theoretical average numbers for 20000 cubes then are<br>
<br>
0:9.77, 2:644.53, 4:4834, 6: 9023.44, 8:4834, 10:644.53, 12:9.77<br>
<br>
   <br>
The chi-square test<br>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson&#x27;s_chi-square_test<br>
is the appropriate tool to test if 25 move scrambles are &quot;good&quot;:<br>
<br>
(28-9.77)^2/9.77 + (701-644.53)^2/644.53 + .....gives a result of 66.<br>
<br>
With 6 degrees of freedom the tables show, that the chance that this <br>
value is &gt;18.55 is less then 0.005. So if I did not do anything <br>
false, the 25 move scramble is a very bad procedure. Especially the <br>
high occurrence of 0 and 4 flipped edges contribute to the high value <br>
of 66.<br>

For 1 million cubes, the theoretical distribution for the *optimal* 
maneuvers should look like this:

12f: ~1
13f: ~12
14f: ~160
15f: ~2200
16f: ~29000
17f: ~260.000
18f: ~690.000
19f: ~30.000
20f: probably less than 1

>From the 4 13f and 18 14f maneuvers all also were optimal, from the 
81 15f maneuvers 80 were optimal.

Ah, yes, I must&#x27;ve made a computation mistake. I tried again and get 
12 expected cubes for 13f as well now. I did it like this:

First I looked at the right column in this statistic:
http://cubezzz.homelinux.org/drupal/?q=node/view/68

Multiplied the last number twice more with 13 (roughly the branching 
factor). Multiply with a million, divide by 4.3e19.

Yeah I know, probably there&#x27;s a statistic somewhere out there about 
the overall distribution, but I don&#x27;t know where.

Cheers!
Stefan

This is the number of disjoint cycles (of a certain type of piece) that comprise the cube, including cycles of length 1. If you subtract from this the number of placed pieces, you&#x27;ll get the number of cycles (of arbitrary length) that need to be resolved, as in blindfolded solving.<br>

----- Original Message ----- <br>
<br>
<br>
So, prompted by the discussion that ensued from Chris&#x27;s extended cross:<br>
<br>
I generated 10,000 scrambles each using Kociemba&#x27;s Cube Explorer and JNetCube.<br>
http://cube.garron.us/scramblestat/kociemba.txt<br>
http://cube.garron.us/scramblestat/JNet.txt<br>
(These&#x27;d make good analogues to the Calgary and Canterbury Corpus...)<br>
<br>
Then I imported them into Mathematica, and computed the number of edges oriented, corners oriented, edges placed, and corners placed for each cube. The resulting statistics:<br>
http://cube.garron.us/scramblestat/kociembastat.txt<br>
http://cube.garron.us/scramblestat/JNetstat.txt<br>
Each line corresponds to a scramble and reports EO, CO, EP, and CP (in that order).<br>
<br>
Here are the total number of cubes for each set, listed by type of &quot;solvedness&quot; (in  the order: EO, CO, EP, CP), and number of cubies matching the solvedness condition (0-12 or 0-8):<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">ZBF2L intuitively is usually called VHF2L, and is relatively simple.  
If you finish with COLL+EPLL, it&#x27;s actually a really good system.

If you want to never have to rotate, and only use RUL (and sometimes 
D) on your F2L, try orienting your edges at the beginning of your 
solve.  Insanely fast F2L follows, and your LL edges are already 
oriented by the time you get to the LL.

<br>
Yes, this is possible. It is also admirable that you are thinking this<br>
way, i.e. that you want to understand how things work.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t have a complete tutorial (since it is not my method), but there<br>
are essentially two skills that you need to weave together:<br>
<br>
1. You need to be able to solve the corner/edge pair intuitively by<br>
itself. Read http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/f2l.html for details<br>
(specifically point 1 on the list in the 3rd paragraph).<br>
<br>
2. You need to be able to orient the edges intuitively. For details,<br>
read http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/method/stage2.html#squares_and_edges<br>
specifically the section &quot;Orienting the edges&quot;.<br>
<br>
In both cases, you need to be flexible and understand that there are<br>
many ways to put things together. This means that you will be able to<br>
see a sequence of moves that does (1) and (2) together. Since (1) is<br>
relatively straightforward, a deeper understanding of (2) will help<br>
guide your solution to (1).<br>

<br>
Actually, VHF2L is another distinct (but similar) system. It is possible<br>
to do both ZBF2L and VHF2L intuitively. The latter is easier but<br>
requires more moves.<br>
<br>
The difference between the two systems is that VHF2L splits ZBF2L into<br>
two steps and requires fewer algorithms.<br>

To lazy to write something in Mathematica like

Sum[(a[[i]] - t[[i]])^2/t[[i]], {i, 1, 7}]     ;-)


Ok, eleminating the elements with very low or zero probability we get
for the chi-squares (in  the order: EO, CO, EP, CP)
Number of degrees of freedom: 6, 7, 7, 7

CE: 3.8, 5.6, 8.0, 7.9
JNet: 133.4, 251.7, 5.5 , 6.9

The probability that the chi-square value are >= these values *if* 
the random generators have the theoretical distribution is

CE: 0.70, 0.59, 0.33 , 0.34
JNet: &lt;0.0000000000000001, &lt;0.0000000000000001, 0,60 0.44

Usually you will reject the hypothesis that the random generator has 
the theoretical behaviour if the probabilities are smaller than 0.05.

So JNet has a severe problem with the orientations of the edges and 
the corners.

I got a bit suspicious after I sent my last message - could JNet be <br>
really so bad in a probabilistc sense?<br>
Adding the numbers for CO for JNet I only get 9700 and not 10000. So <br>
Lucas made an error. I suspect, that instead of 83 it should be 383 <br>
and then JNet gives *good* values for the corners.<br>
It still remains the problem with the 23 cases with correctly edge <br>
orientation, which is extremely unlikely.<br>
Nevertheless I think we can live with the fact that within 10000 <br>
cubes you may get maybe 20 too many cubes with a completely correct <br>
edge orientation and JCube does its job well.<br>

&gt; I got a bit suspicious after I sent my last message - could JNet be<br>
&gt; really so bad in a probabilistc sense?<br>
&gt; Adding the numbers for CO for JNet I only get 9700 and not 10000. So<br>
&gt; Lucas made an error. I suspect, that instead of 83 it should be 383<br>
&gt; and then JNet gives *good* values for the corners.<br>
&gt; It still remains the problem with the 23 cases with correctly edge<br>
&gt; orientation, which is extremely unlikely.<br>
&gt; Nevertheless I think we can live with the fact that within 10000<br>
&gt; cubes you may get maybe 20 too many cubes with a completely correct<br>
&gt; edge orientation and JCube does its job well.<br>

So can someone run these numbers for all mix lengths between, say,   <br>
20 - 30?<br>
<br>
So we can finally answer the old question of how many moves it truly  <br>
takes to fully<br>
scramble a cube?<br>
<br>
There&#x27;s lots of glory for whoever discovers the magic number. You may  <br>
even be responsible for invalidating all current cube records!<br>

I still don&#x27;t like it...

So, I was still wary of those results for JNet, especially those 23 EOs, and 
reran it with 100,000 scrambles (including the 10,000 old ones).
I would try a milllion; Mathematica could handle it, but JNet is too slow.
If anybody really wants the file, just send me an email; I&#x27;m not uploading 
it...

(EO, CO, EP, CP, EC, CC)

100,000 JNet scrambles:
{41, 0, 2764, 0, 22444, 0, 44173, 0, 26360, 0, 3970, 0, 248},
{3913, 15292, 28361, 25498, 19221, 5075, 2582, 0, 58},
{36901, 36493, 18467, 6241, 1536, 301, 48, 11, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0},
{36962, 36772, 18220, 6167, 1536, 285, 57, 0, 1},
{8285, 25112, 31482, 22032, 9600, 2816, 574, 89, 9, 1, 0, 0},
{12534, 32626, 32384, 16652, 4975, 771, 57, 1}

Theoretical distributions:
{49, 0, 3223, 0, 24170, 0, 45120, 0, 24170, 0, 3223, 0, 49},
{3932, 15364, 28166, 25606, 19204, 5120, 2561, 0, 46},
{36788, 36788, 18394, 6131, 1533, 307, 51, 7, 0.9, 0.09, 0.014, 0, 0.00021},
{36788, 36786, 18403, 6111, 1563, 278, 69, 0, 2.5},
{8333, 25166, 31507, 21974, 9602, 2785, 551, 75, 7, 0.4, 0.014, 0.00021},
{12500, 32411, 32569, 16788, 4861, 799, 69, 2.5}

It&#x27;s a little nicer (except at the high extremes), but that 23 -> 248 is not 
going away.
And I&#x27;d estimate that the number of orient &amp; permute blindfolded solves 
scrambled via JNet is on the order of 10^[4 or 5], so those dozen extra free 
EO&#x27;s are not too comforting. Yes, they don&#x27;t count for legal UWR&#x27;s, but I 
find anomalies discomforting. It feels like I&#x27;m cheating a tiny bit, or 
someone is cheating for me.
And what if more people start their solves by orienting edges before F2L? Or 
even use the Human Thistlethwaite?

This &quot;sport,&quot; formalized, is still relatively young. Do we expect 25 random 
turns to remain a standard for the next 100 years?

I&#x27;m on it. Standard random-of-18-face-turns, then 
24x(random-of-those-15-turns-that-don&#x27;t-retwist-the-previous-face), that is?

> There&#x27;s lots of glory for whoever discovers the magic number.
Really? Is there a cubing hall of fame? Where do I apply for admission?

Is there a way to check the source code of JNet?
Actually, Jaap&#x27;s offical scrambler is of more official concern. From the 
comments, I think it&#x27;s essentially an 18, 15, 15... scheme. Is there a 
simple way to modify it to output a few thousand scrambles, perhaps even 
into a file?

We should remember, though, that we&#x27;re really actually concerned with 
scrambles that are, for human cubing purposes, >indistiguishable&lt; from 
random, not necessarily random. How many people notice, for example, that 
Ryan Heise&#x27;s simulator&#x27;s scrambles (even for BLD), give no cycle parity 
between corners and edges? (http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/speed.html, by the 
way)

I get the following EO frequencies for 100,000 scrambles for each 
length from 0 to 99 moves. The orientation definition I used can be 
described by using the centers as reference, and F as well as B 
changing the orientation of the four moved edges, while no other 
moves change the orientations. The scramble generator I used starts 
with all six sides allowed to turn, and after a move is done, the 
same side gets forbidden and its four adjacent sides get allowed. 
Now the stats:

Notice they do seem to approach the optimal distribution Lucas 
mentioned:

> Theoretical distributions:
>  {49, 0, 3223, 0, 24170, 0, 45120, 0, 24170, 0, 3223, 0, 49},

However, at 25 moves I differ quite a bit from Lucas&#x27; experiment 
with JNetCube:

Him: {41, 0, 2764, 0, 22444, 0, 44173, 0, 26360, 0, 3970, 0, 248},
Me: 42 0 2895 0 23149 0 44489 0 25615 0 3673 0 134

Probably at least one of us made a mistake, or JNetCube uses a 
non-equivalent scramble generator.

I wrote a quick patch into CE to generate random scrambles of a given 
maneuver length. The following conditions were given:
0. All 18 moves have the same probability .
but: 
1. Two adjacent moves must not turn the same face (like U U2).
2. If two adjacent moves have opposite faces (like U D&#x27;) the next 
move must not turn any of these two faces.

So if 1. or 2. were not satified another random move was taken.

I generated 2.048 million random cubes with scramble length 
20,25,30,35,40 and counted the number of cubes which have 
0,1,2,3...... flipped edges. According too Jaap the theoretical 
distribution for this should be exactly:

{1000,0,66000,0,495000,0,924000,0,495000,0,66000,0,1000}

What is seen is, that for a small number of scramble moves there are 
too many cubes with no flipped edges.

Then I applied the chi-square test to the distributions.If the 
scramble algorithm is good, in 99% of all cases the chi-square value 
is less than 16.8. So if chisquare>17 we should reject the hypothesis 
of a good scramble. Here are the astonishing results:

m20={6247,0,84124,0,552610,0,892625,0,458001,0,53612,0,781}

chi[m20]=45416.9

m25={2755,0,75017,0,524075,0,911606,0,474435,0,59241,0,871}

chi[m25]=7749.18

m30={1337,0,69041,0,506102,0,921357,0,485578,0,63608,0,977}

chi[m30]=776.807

m35={1102,0,67609,0,498818,0,923714,0,491192,0,64626,0,939}

chi[m35]=140.787

m40={979,0,66490,0,497511,0,924236,0,491722,0,66033,0,1029}

chi[m40]=39.4419

SO EVEN WITH 40 MOVES you get no good distribution!!!
and 25 moves is OUT OF QUESTION


Then I tested the same with my CE random generator and was pretty 
sure that all is perfectly right now. Sadly: It was not, Luckily: I 
found the fault

Instead of

c:=CubieCube.Create(Random(40320),Random(2187),Random(479001600),Random(2048));

I coded

c:=CubieCube.Create(Random(40320-1),Random(2187-1),Random(479001600-
1),Random(2048-1));

With this corrected version I made a test with 10.000.000 random 
cubes and got the result (I will put it online tomorrow)

{10080,0,660511,0,4948308,0,9240725,0,4951253,0,659062,0,10061}

with a chi-square value of 3.7

I do not understand your table. If this are *random* simulations with 
100.000 cubes each, why we have an exact symmetry here?

Those weren&#x27;t really random or simulations. I mean, I didn&#x27;t 
generate some number of scrambles and analyzed them. I computed 
exact values (except negligibly tiny rounding errors) by covering 
*all* scrambles. Here are the number of 25-move scrambles resulting 
in the different number of correctly oriented edges (from 0 to 12):

In other words, I compute the expected result of your type of 
simulation.

Interestingly, in your m40, all-bad wins against all-good.

Nice! So even with a 60 move scramble the edge orientation shows 
deviations from the theoretical distribution.
I would be interested in your distribution if you use the scramble 
algorithm I used and described (which also allows U D for example)

Clarification: Note this doesn&#x27;t say anything about its opposite 
side. Thus that side simply keeps its allowed/forbidden status.

I believe our scramble algorithms are equivalent. Here&#x27;s mine again:

1. Allow all moves.
2. Make random allowed move.
3. Forbid the side just turned.
4. Allow its four adjacent sides.
5. Go to 2 unless 25 moves were made

Do you think it differs from yours? Ah wait, I think I know what you 
misunderstood. Step 3/4. Think of each side as having an allowed/
forbidden status, and this status gets set/cleared.

Start.
Pick U, now { U } is forbidden.
Pick D, now { U, D } is forbidden.
Pick F, now { F } is forbidden.

Cheers!
Stefan

Yes. And I could imagine you need infinitely many moves to reach it. 
Btw, the use of &quot;theoretical&quot; is now I think ambigious, because my 
results are also kinda &quot;theoretical&quot; (compared to the random 
simulation approach).

Tomorrow I&#x27;ll add the chi-square test.

Also, I do actually have the frequencies not just for &quot;number of 
flipped edges, 0 to 12&quot; but the frequencies of all 2048 individual 
states. I&#x27;ll try to analyze that as well, because the &quot;number of 
flipped edges&quot; is already a summary where a lot of information is 
lost.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">The basic idea is that for the first part of your solve, orient all edges
correctly by getting four at a time on either F or B and doing a quarter
turn.  After this step, if you stay in the F2 B2 U D L R subset, that is
don&#x27;t turn F and B quarter turns, all the edges remain oriented correctly.
In this sense all F2L algorithms can be done 2 generator and without
rotating the cube.  You could also do ZBLL.

OK. This is my first post here and I guess it could qualify as a
&quot;shameless plug&quot; since I am Ben Jos Walbeehm. (And to introduce/plug
myself more, I guess I still have SOME notoriety as the person for
attacking the U-table on his Commodore 64.)

The program Mark mentioned is something that Ken Silverman wrote. It
displays a cube very realistically, makes sounds, has custom colours,
keeps a history, can save situations, and so on.

What I wrote was a solver. Actually, not one but three. An optimal
2x2x2 solver, a &quot;pretty good&quot; 3x3x3 solver, and a solver that solves
ANY cube larger than 3x3x3. So it solves a 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 10x10x10, and
so on. Ken&#x27;s program is limited to 64x64x64 now, but this can be
increased trivially and my solver (as long as you pay attention to
some of the remarks) will solve cubes of any size above that too. I
had my own version solve a 128x128x128 just for fun. :P

There&#x27;s only one thing I&#x27;m not happy about... that is that there is a
bug in my code... the code that Ken currently has freely available.
When you use the editor to create a situation for my solvers to solve,
it may sometimes crash. I fixed this already, so anyone interested in
the fix, contact me.

I have recently had my 5th or so revival regarding cubes and have come
up with some interesting theories (I think) that maybe are worth
looking into. So Mark told me to post them. I told him some of my
ideas, but I still have to put them in a better format.

Ben Jos.

I prefer to think of it as &quot;transformations and reductions&quot; from one <br>
case to another. Thus a good way to start is to learn all the base <br>
cases, cases with very short irreducible algs. Work on each f2l group <br>
at a time, learning how it can be reduced to other cases, and how each <br>
of the reductions flip LL edges. I don&#x27;t know how intuitive that could <br>
be, but I think it&#x27;s rather efficent to attack big problems by <br>

True, it is needed to change

    angles = { -45, 45 };

to

    angles = { -45, 45, 90 };

I would do this but unfortunately I&#x27;m stuck with the first version until
I do a major rewrite - i.e. change the database format for records
(which include scrambles), and then change all the data in the database.

It should happen eventually, but it may be cancelled out anyway by
users&#x27; habit of reloading the page when they get a scramble they don&#x27;t
like :-) (easy decision on BLD since there is no running average).

CubeExplorer: {1.443, 10.275, 7.91489, 13.1464, 14.2199, 19.0312}
100,00 probabilistic: {6.14985, 10.8045, 5.74321, 9.73557, 4.86605, 11.2522}

The results for length 1-45 scrambles are here: 
http://cube.garron.us/scramblestat/scr_chi.txt
Note that they vary unusually sometimes, but generally follow a pattern.

Blindly adding the six values these gives the following totals:
{14784689825, 115090278, 104693100, 36875271, 17131246, 7435318, 4174854, 
310171, 1317725, 787915, 442487, 268055, 149450, 91196, 52509, 33163, 19605, 
11322, 7400, 4186, 2928, 1914, 1547, 863, 569, 411, 311, 203, 155, 129, 101, 
70, 102, 83, 46, 41, 47, 56, 44, 64, 60, 38, 46, 31, 38}

This is somewhat exponential-looking. Mathematica gives a pretty consistent 
fit with the values around 20-45:
38.8138+6142*exp[-0.385131(x+19)]
(Yes, I know I could move that 19 into the coefficient of the exponential 
term. But this shows how I got the fit)

The CubeExplorer set gives 66 and the 100,000 probabilistic cubes give 48.6
66 fits the model at 33 twists; 48.6 at 35.7 twists.

With a bit of leniency, I&#x27;d say that the magic number of acceptable 
randomness as requested by Petrus:
>> 34 twists HTM &lt;&lt;
Maybe 35. I&#x27;ll give it a plus-or-minus of one or two.

Again, this is a search for high-fidelity randomness, not practical 
acceptability. Things level out quickly (though not very evenly) around 
thirty (the derivative of the exponential model is -1 at 29, though that is 
almost a matter of scale). But really, the chi-sum is already in the 
hunred&#x27;s by 25.
25 is definitely not random, but not horrible. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth 
suggesting to everyone that they should make their scrambles even 10 turns 
longer.

For competitions, though, it&#x27;d be nice to use truly random scrambles.
Kociemba (Should I call you Herbert?), would it be easy for you to implement 
a java file that could replace Jaap&#x27;s official scrambler 
(http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#scrambling) with a 
generate-and-solve code? (since Cube-Explorer is not multi-platfrom -yet) It 
wouldn&#x27;t need to be excellent, just give something around 25 moves.
Just a suggestion... But I&#x27;d love to see such a clean scrambler used 
officially.
Why exactly is there an official defintion involving half turns in the WCA 
regulations, anyhow?

So that, hopefully, is the end of my main investigation into the randomness 
of scrambles...
(Now I only have to wait for Kociemba or Pochmann to find another mistake 
somewhere :-)

I wondered a bit about the high value 19.03 with CC for Cube 
Explorer. 
The chance for a value >=19 is &lt;0.01 . But: If the expected values 
are less then 5 you should omit this data, because then the test is 
unreliable. WHen applying this to CC the value reduces to 11, and 
then the chance is about 14%, which is acceptable.

Actually right now I don&#x27;t have time to learn it myself, but if you 
guys can give me a simple formula I&#x27;ll implement it and post the 
results, then you can hopefully interpret them for us.

Thanks. I see it&#x27;s indeed equivalent to the other used algorithms 
and the difference was apparently caused by the mistake Lucas

This code is sadly very hard to read, because of the missing line

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

This is nothing more than axial control.
Allow each layer on an axis only once in a chunk of consecutive 
turns. Once the next turn is on a different axis unlock all the 
layers on d axis again :-)

For 2x2x2 scrambles one locks both layers on the axis at the same 
time. U D or U D&#x27; etc don&#x27;t make sense on 2x2x2 ;-)

I was planning to re-&quot;model&quot; the data without the cycle count. I still get 
something between 35 and 36 as the predicted &quot;good &quot;scramble length.
I also ran 10,000 scrambles for 1-50 twists.

The following are plots (data+fit) of chi-square sums for EO, CO, EP, and 
CP:
The original set: http://cube.garron.us/scramblestat/run1.png (Note that 
this has a very large mantissaa-scale, so it&#x27;s still pretty steep at 30)
The 10,000 trials set: http://cube.garron.us/scramblestat/run2.png

In both cases, it levels out in the mid-30&#x27;s. Definitely not by 25.
I still stand with my declaration of 34 twists HTM. But this time I&#x27;ll 
definitely say +/- 2.

          <div class="email-content">The Mid Atlantic Cube gathering was a success, our first get together <br>
consisted of 5 people, three locals from Maryland including David <br>
Barr, Chris, and Steve, then myself, and the unexpected (at least to <br>
me) Jasmine Lee.  <br>
<br>
I left at about 4:30, directions were confusing, I&#x27;m not even sure <br>
when I got there.  I was the last to arrive, the four already had <br>
their stackmats out, and ALL of their puzzles were scattered across <br>
the table.  A couple 5x5s, a megaminx of two, some brain teasers, and <br>
3x3s, loads of 3x3s.  I sat down amongst an unknown crowd, and just <br>
because our common grounds was the Rubik&#x27;s cube there was no <br>
communication barrier, I hopped right in like we were all good <br>
friends.<br>
<br>
We had some pizza and wings for dinner, the food was great.  We all <br>
cubed and showed off, talked about speedcubing methods, Jasmine <br>
talked a lot about her site.  This guy Chris and I went off to the <br>
one end of the table and I showed him my blindfolded tricks for big <br>
cube bld.  I actually ran through a whole scramble for him, showed <br>
him some commutators even.  He caught on really fast, it was very <br>
nice to see that in person I could describe so easily commutators.<br>
<br>
It probably wasn&#x27;t until 10:30 that we realized that we hadn&#x27;t even <br>
raced yet!  David put his children off to bed (now I laugh, I thought <br>
David was about 20 years younger)<br>
<br>
Jasmine started to pull out a program on her planner, and we began to <br>
scramble, we realized &quot;Let&#x27;s just pass cubes around and go random&quot;<br>
<br>
I won most of the races.  I finished off with about a 20.xx <br>
average ... I did have some bad solves though, Chris would beat me if <br>
I messed up (or decided to go with a white cross), I tried to even <br>
the challenge out a little bit with things like using an odd colored <br>
cross, or maybe solving the 3x3 on the 5x5.<br>
<br>
Oh yes, Jasmine set her own personal best time that night, a sub 20, <br>
non-lucky, that was nice to see.<br>
<br>
We concluded at about midnight, I then got lost here and there on the <br>
way home, I made it back in about three hours.  The maps don&#x27;t <br>
account for that extra hour, I suppose the computer knew where it was <br>
going ...<br>

If you run chi-square on expected result vs. the randomly attained

The new version 4.11 is already available. I also have some ideas 
concerning the expected values from Stefan, but the weather is too 
beautiful to spend more time at the PC today.

If a scrambler using a sequence of random turns is not good enough 
to give us the desired permutation/orientation distribution, then 
why not have a &quot;2-phase&quot; scrambler then? First generate random 
permutation, then random orientations. Oh and a last step, find the 
sequence for that .... hehehe ;-) After all we gonna use the 
scramble also :D

Have fun!

Probably a bit, but not that much. My guess is that your cube just
sucks.. Get a new one.. Most people (me too) really like the DIY kits,
that means that you get the parts and you have to assemble the whole
cube by yourself. There are springs in the center (you can adjust the
spring tension) which make it possible to &quot;cut edges&quot;..

You can try to get a cube from rubik.com (DIYkit with stickers) or one
from 9spuzzles.com (from china, but very good quality). Those cubes
will be very good even without any silicone.

I also started with a crappy cube like you seem to have. I also was
about 2 minutes back then.. I dropped about 20 seconds just by using
silicone on my cube.. I dropped another 15 seconds or so by buying a
new Ideal/Arxon Cube on eBay and adjusting the spring tension.. I now
use 9spuzzles DIYkit cubes and I averrage about 50 seconds (but there
is still very much room for improvement)..

True... there are lots of people in the Herrengarten today, some guys 
play guitar under the window where I am right now. I guess summer is 
officially here.

Though I also want to get some work done and my laptop battery only 
lasts about 10-15 minutes, so...

This made me laugh a lot:
&quot;It can connect a stackmat to a computer through the microphone.&quot;

Oh, so that&#x27;s how the two devices are communicating. Through the

It doesn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m on Mac OS X and I&#x27;ve downloaded the java
6, but when I lauch the program I get: &quot;The jar file
&quot;CALCubeTimer.jar&quot; couldn&#x27;t be launched. Check the Console for
possible error messages&quot;.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Joey

          <div class="email-content">Too far. But I&#x27;ll make the offer to fix it if you can send it to me 
(MI, USA) along with a pre-paid envelope to send it back.

I&#x27;m pretty sure that costs more than buying a new one though :).

It&#x27;s atually not too hard to string one yourself. It&#x27;s basically a 
big loop of tiles and a single strange of sting runs across 3 
consecutive tiles. There are 2 strings (it can be thought of as one 
on each side) for every 3 consecutive tiles. When in the loop 
formation each tile has a total of 6 strings wrapped around it. Thus 
for a magic of N tiles, there should be 2*N strings (although it is 
possible to have less but will be significantly less stable).

Look at Jaap&#x27;s site on a beginner guide for how to string. It&#x27;s not 
too hard to get it working again. But to get it strung perfectly and 
uniformely (like mine are!) then you need to know exactly what you 
are doing (or find somebody who does).

To start, what I would do is remove the loose strings (if a single 
tiles is out, I/you would have to remove 6 strings). They are kinda 
of tangled but each string is a loop that does not &quot;link&quot; (in the 
mathematical sence) to other strings. Then I would play out the 
other 11 tiles in a stright line on the table (pretty long). Then I 
would connect the loose tile using 2 of the 6 strings you have 
availible to the rest of it so like if it was XXXXXXXXXXX-Y (Y is 
the loose tile), then you place wo strings (one at a time) to 
connect the XXY part of it. Next you have to make the loop by 
connecting the XYX with two more strings. And finally the YXX with 
the remaining two strings.

Also, figure out (trying normal flips) wheather the tile ties in the 
front or in the back. (You don&#x27;t want to invert it and loop the 
wrong way.)

I&#x27;m sure you can find a fellow cuber in your area that is willing to 
do this for you.

          <div class="email-content">Perhaps we just have much sronger fingers and wrists than you. You&#x27;ll 
get there if you work hard enough.

I think it a rite of passage to start with a non-so-great cube.

Persoanlly, I don&#x27;t think that at your times, the cube matters much 
(assuming it&#x27;s a standard one from the store or rubiks.com). What 
matters is reducing your number of turns and your recognition times.

          <div class="email-content">First of all, I recommend returning that timer if you still can. It 
costs only $20 for a newer gen 2.5 one that has a jack for sure.

&quot;I feel that it could be don.&quot; &lt;- A person with an EE degree would 
just pop it own and then know for sure. It&#x27;s kinda 50-50 as to 
weather it&#x27;s possible, even if it is it would cost 10-20 cents for 
the recepticle/port and someone to solder it on for you. A drill 
might help too...

Go to the speedstack&#x27;s website, and then look for the &quot;store&quot; part 
of the site. It&#x27;s hard to miss.

To the designers of the CALCubeTimer, how did you learn of the 
protocal used int he communication? I e-mailed speedstacks a year 
ago, and they refused to divulge this informaiton to me. I was kind 
or annoyed by it. My academic curiousity must be satisfied.

You guys have analyzed the quality of our scrambles by comparing <br>

<br>
That is wrong.<br>

Doing that, you&#x27;re *not* judging the quality of our way to scramble, <br>
you&#x27;re judging the quality of the small scramble set your generater <br>

To judge the quality of our way to scramble, you ought to compare <br>

          <div class="email-content">It&#x27;s not really about finger/wrist strength. If you have a proper
speedcube, it doesn&#x27;t take that much effort to turn the sides.
Speedcubers can move their cube quickly because the movements have
been ingrained in muscle memory, not because they have freakishly
strong hands. Even the fastest cubers would be slowed down a lot if
they had to use a cube that sticks and is hard to turn.

Just rename the .zip file to a .jar file.

          <div class="email-content">It starts the timer as soon as the key is pressed, not when it is
released like JNetCube. I don&#x27;t know java, but I&#x27;m sure it would be
something like onKeyPress being changed to onKeyUp! (well, thats the
javascript way)

As of now, we are going to continue to add features and fix bugs for at 
least a while yet in a closed source fashion. This may change though.

What about the releasing the Timer class API and let people make their
own GUI&#x27;s using that?

&gt; It doesn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m on Mac OS X and I&#x27;ve downloaded the java<br>

&gt; &quot;CALCubeTimer.jar&quot; couldn&#x27;t be launched. Check the Console for<br>
&gt; possible error messages&quot;.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Any ideas?<br>

That&#x27;s too bad. I was hoping it would work fine.<br>
<br>
I just tested it using a buddy&#x27;s computer and it works. Could you <br>
attempt to launch CALCubeTimer.jar from the terminal and see if you <br>
get any execptions?<br>
<br>
If you need instruction on how to do that, here&#x27;s what I would do <br>
(granted, I&#x27;m not a Mac user). Make sure you know where your CCT <br>
folder (containing the jar file) is.<br>
<br>
-Click on the search thingy at the top right, and type in &quot;terminal&quot;<br>
-Once the terminal is open, type in &quot;java -version&quot;. On my friend&#x27;s <br>
Mac, I get this:<br>
java version &quot;1.6.0-dp&quot;<br>
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0-dp-b88-34)<br>
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.6.0-b88-17-release, mixed mode, <br>
sharing)<br>
Hopefully, you get something like this. Anything about java 1.5 is <br>
not going to work.<br>
-Open the terminal prompt, and type in &quot;cd Desktop&quot; and then &quot;cd <br>
CCT&quot;. This should get you into your CCT folder if it&#x27;s on your <br>
desktop.<br>
-then type in &quot;java -jar CALCubeTimer.jar&quot; and press enter. That <br>
should attempt to run our program.<br>
-Copy paste any errors you get into this forum, and I&#x27;ll try to help <br>
you.<br>
<br>
Please go to the effort of doing this if you get the time, I&#x27;d love <br>
to get our program working on OS X!<br>

You should be able to start the timer with (almost) any key, by 
holding down any number of keys for any amount of time. The timer 
should not start until all of those keys have been released. The 
timer should stop immediately when any key is pressed down, and 
accepted when that (or those) keys are released.

I hope that makes sense. Basically, it&#x27;s supposed to function exactly 
the same as a stackmat.

The linux issue is already known. I think I know how to fix it. It 
should work fine on Mac and Windows though.

I really like the idea of having a permanent server up which people 
can connect to to chat and cube. I don&#x27;t know if Ryan&#x27;s hosting 
provider has such a service. If anyone would like to become a server, 
feel free to start it up and provide an IP to connect to. Maybe we 
could make it a standard for the community. We haven&#x27;t really stress-
tested the chat client yet though.

Hem..., I guess that&#x27;s what I would have done too. But that requires <br>
one to first accept the assumption that it outputs a unique periodic <br>
signal for each stopped value (as opposed to something stranger). I <br>
didn&#x27;t know it was a standard 2.5mm jack either. If I did I could have <br>
taken an osciliscope to it too.<br>
<br>
Curious, is the signal digial, analog, or some sort of ADC step output?<br>
<br>
And what does it look like? I guess it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be <br>
periodic, the time could be encoded in the frequency... Is it like a <br>
UART-ish binary encoding?<br>

          <div class="email-content">So my answer to Per&#x27;s question was totally wrong. I thought he was 
talking aobut the standard version not the server one.

This jar vs zip question popped up a while back in this forum... 
It&#x27;s soemthing about the web browser (IE) handling it incorrectly. I 
don&#x27;t remember the detials too well, I think Hunt(?) provided a 
detailed technical answer. I just remember the term MIME. It&#x27;s not 
my expertise though.

Just do what the other guy said, and rename it to change the 
extension manually.

Awesome! I&#x27;m glad I could help. Would you recommend changing the
instructions (was there anything missing?)

I hope you enjoy the program.

For starters, can anyone contribute their thoughts to &quot;the best brand of<br>

I am definitely not an expert on this topic myself.<br>

This particular question has come up many times in the archives, yet I<br>

That&#x27;s such bad luck, I hope you didn&#x27;t feel too gutted about it, just
goes to show that these things happen to the best of us.

Looking forward to seeing you at the next tourney,

Ouch, I&#x27;ve never seen the cube pop like that when dropped like the 
second video.

In the first video, the rule violation btw happened very early, right 
after the initial pop. This rule was violated:

&quot;A5b) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not 
have any assistance from anyone or any object. Penalty: 
disqualification of the solve.&quot;

When will judges and other bystanders finally understand that by 
bringing a popped piece back to the competitor, *they* are 
disqualifying the solve? They&#x27;re *not* helping, they&#x27;re invalidating!

Quarter-turns only doesn&#x27;t work. I ran that from 1-50. EO matches reasonably <br>

<br>
&gt; Note also that we have only considered orientations/permutations and in<br>
&gt; that space, we found that edge orientations were off. If we broaden the<br>
&gt; scope to consider other properties of the cube, we may find other things<br>
&gt; that are off. What if there is something that is even more &quot;off&quot; than<br>
&gt; edge orientation?<br>
I tried cycles. Seems a bit useless<br>
Except for extreme anomalies, I don&#x27;t think sticker color counts are very <br>
useful.<br>
<br>
Should we define and compute &quot;pieces joined&quot;? Pieces correct relative to <br>
each other?<br>
A 2x2x2 block solved in the wrong corner involves fixing centers with at <br>
least four slice moves or some not-necessarily-so-obvious algs...<br>
Really, correlating pieces joined to an unfair advantage is a rather <br>
slippery business<br>
Crossiness? Extended-crossiness? Roux-blockiness? Easy corners-first <br>
susceptibility?<br>
<br>
And the problem is that these require simulations that take a long while to <br>
settle into order. Only EO, CO, and CP can be handled comprehensively like <br>
Stefan&#x27;s. Or is there something else simple?<br>
<br>
I think that &quot;generate &amp; solve&quot; is really the best way out. It&#x27;s not <br>
computationally expensive to generate a short solution anymore.<br>

Ouch, I&#x27;ve never seen the cube pop like that when dropped like the 
second video.

In the first video, the rule violation btw happened very early, right 
after the initial pop. This rule was violated:

&quot;A5b) While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor must not 
have any assistance from anyone or any object. Penalty: 
disqualification of the solve.&quot;

When will judges and other bystanders finally understand that by 
bringing a popped piece back to the competitor, *they* are 
disqualifying the solve? They&#x27;re *not* helping, they&#x27;re invalidating!

          <div class="email-content">Here&#x27;s a scenario that happened a few times in the Berkeley competition.<br>
<br>
The competitor completes a solve, but happens to hit the reset  <br>
button, leaving the stackmat showing 0.00. The judge clearly saw  the  <br>
display showing &quot;21 something&quot;.<br>
<br>
I got a DNF, but I heard others got a time of 22.00 in that case. To  <br>
be clear, I don&#x27;t care about my time at all, but I&#x27;d like for this to  <br>
be judged consistently.<br>
<br>
I think the DNF is too draconian. The cube was solved, and we know  <br>
the approximate time, so why not record it? I&#x27;d argue for adding an  <br>
extra second to be sure. If the last anyone saw was 21.xx, it could  <br>
have switched to 22.07 without anyone noticing, but recording 23.00  <br>
should be safe, and ensure no one gets a benefit from this.<br>
<br>
<br>
The other thing is that someone should build a little reset button  <br>
cover to stop this from happening.<br>

haha jk it wasn&#x27;t that scary, i just moved feet out of the way of the flying pieces and saw 2 people reaching for them, stopped the guy next to me by pushing his hand away, and yelling &quot;DON&#x27;T TOUCH IT, DON&#x27;T TOUCH IT, DON&#x27;T TOUCH IT&quot; as loud as i could (it was a very cramped, loud room)  stopped the kid going for the piece.

UMTS

UMTS stands for Ultimate Multiple Timer Support. There is a server
which you can start up and multiple people can connect to remotely.
You can see everybody&#x27;s times, and people can choose to have the same
scrambles. In addition, if you have multiple soundcards (usb or
otherwise) then you can start up multiple instances of CCT and run
them all with different stackmats on the same computer!

&gt; I think the DNF is too draconian. The cube was solved, and we know<br>
&gt; the approximate time, so why not record it? I&#x27;d argue for adding an<br>
&gt; extra second to be sure. If the last anyone saw was 21.xx, it could<br>
&gt; have switched to 22.07 without anyone noticing, but recording 23.00<br>
&gt; should be safe, and ensure no one gets a benefit from this.<br>
It went up to 23.21.<br>
http://archive.garron.us/vid/2007/berkeleyspring/bks_petrus.mp4<br>
And I remembered it stopping at 22, even though I recall watching that solve <br>
very intently for some particular reason. Maybe +5 is safer?<br>
If we use CCT, could it be optionally set to record the last sent time <br>
before it&#x27;s reset?<br>
<br>
&gt; Morris:<br>
&gt; My first 5x5 solve had a pop where the pieces flew into the audience.<br>
Not exactly as exciting as you might expect, but here&#x27;s the 5.8 MB video of <br>
that solve (pop at 28 seconds):<br>
http://archive.garron.us/vid/2007/berkeleyspring/morris_pop.mp4<br>
And his 58.91 4x4x4 solve: http://archive.garron.us/vid/temp/4x4x4b.mp4<br>
<br>
&gt; Cochran<br>
&gt; just wondering if anyone there happened to catch a video of my 14.55 solve <br>
&gt; in the first round at berkeley, or the 1:17 revenge solve<br>
Don&#x27;t think so...<br>
<br>
Since I&#x27;m posting, here are videos of my best times for speedsolve, OH, and <br>
BLD. (The latter two are now NR&#x27;s :-)<br>
Among other things, my cube popped a center cap during almost every solve <br>
except the 15.89 and OH&#x27;s, so these were extra-excellent for me.<br>
http://archive.garron.us/vid/2007/berkeleyspring/15_89.mp4<br>

<br>
My 39-move FMC solution is here:<br>
http://archive.garron.us/solves/2007/bksFMC.htm<br>
Nice cross, simple F2L, and a PLL skip that I didn&#x27;t find until ten minutes <br>
before the end.<br>
<br>
Is it good that the optimal solution had 17 moves?<br>
http://archive.garron.us/solves/2007/bksFMCoptimal.htm<br>

          <div class="email-content">If I understand the protocal then yes, it is possible to do this. 
However, I don&#x27; thtink it&#x27;s wise. Seting a time in such a way would 
deviate too much from what WCA accepts. The time it takes to lift 
one&#x27;s hands and pick up the cube and the tiem it takes to stop the 
timer properly are apart of the offical time. They have to be, to 
ensure fairness.

Ok, Ryan and I talked about it, and we&#x27;ll be going open source once 
we clean up the ugly parts of our code, and fix some of the now known 
bugs.
Until then, please enjoy the program!

I admittedly don&#x27;t have knowledge of any of the things you just 
mentioned. We just recorded some of the &quot;sounds&quot; with Audacity (a 
great open-source audio program) and looked at the waveforms. Once we 
figured out how to interpret them, we (simply) wrote a program to do 
the work for us.
Maybe we&#x27;ll document it later, until then, you can enjoy a challenge 
in trying to figure it out yourself.

You&#x27;re right. It would be possible to record the last time sent, but 
I can guarantee that the last time sent to the computer will not be 
the same time as when the competitor would have stopped the timer. If 
you look, there is a distinct delay between the timer and the 
display. There is a similar delay between the timer and our program. 
Furthermore, the timer does not output at a frequency as high as it 
is capable of stopping at.

However, I&#x27;m sure that a +2 would more than cover all these problems.

Why is everyone so enthusiastic about the quality of my movies ?!
I&#x27;m using a digital camera (Panasonic DMC-FX01), the compression is
xvid/mp3 using the default options of mencoder, bitrate 1500, that&#x27;s all !

I&#x27;ve just put all my videos on my uber website : 
http://rubiks.kicks-ass.org/

I didn&#x27;t have much time to take videos, as I was participating as well
in all categories.

Because compared to most other videos we&#x27;ve seen, yours are of quite 
superior quality. I was not at all amazed or surprised, as I did see 
the high bitrate, and I&#x27;m aware that with a good camera and some care 
it should be easy to get videos like that. However, yes, I&#x27;m 
enthusiastic because this is rarely done and thus we rarely get to 
see videos of that quality. Once I can afford it, I&#x27;ll buy a new 
laptop (because mine&#x27;s old  doesn&#x27;t have firewire) and a good video 
camera and then I&#x27;ll make videos like that, too.

Cheers!
Stefan

&gt; It went up to 23.21.<br>

Wow. I&#x27;s really cool that you caught that. And it kills my argument  <br>
pretty well. It&#x27;s just really hard to see with any precision.<br>

I really like the European rubber ring method. It gets rid of the  <br>

&gt; Nice cross, simple F2L, and a PLL skip that I didn&#x27;t find until ten  <br>
&gt; minutes<br>
&gt; before the end.<br>
<br>
SIgh. I had a 43 move solution that I wrote down wrong (missed a  <br>
prime, apparently). So you beat the world champion fair and square.<br>
<br>
&gt; Is it good that the optimal solution had 17 moves?<br>

In theory it means that this was an easier position than average.<br>

Just one final comment from my side. Using Stefans analysis we see, 
that using 25 move scrambles means the following deviations from the 
&quot;true&quot; probabilities for the number of correctly flipped edges:

0: -14%,  2: -10%,  4: -4%,  6: -1%,  8: +6%, 10: +13%, 12: +173%

If this is acceptable for you I cannot judge because I do not know if 
there are any advantages/disadvantages when the number of flipped 
edges is smaller.

Can you explain exactly the problem you&#x27;re having with step three?  
It&#x27;s hard to give satisfactory answers to such general, vague questions.

It&#x27;s hard to say what will make you faster if you don&#x27;t describe better 
how you&#x27;re solving the cube now or provide a video.  There&#x27;s different 
methods; we can&#x27;t tell which you&#x27;re using or how that 55 seconds breaks 
down; thus, it&#x27;s hard to tell you how to get faster.  And I can&#x27;t 
really tell what you mean by &quot;the whole yellow cross&quot;; again, it would 
help to have some explanation of your method.  Getting good advice 
takes time for the person asking and for the person responding.  If you 
don&#x27;t phrase your question well, it takes that much longer for people 
to figure out how to answer you; most people won&#x27;t bother spending that 
time.

Oh, and it&#x27;s &quot;algorithms&quot;.

Just a heads up: he already asked this question in the petrusmethod<br>

asked the same question again.<br>

Here is a summary of the thread so far:<br>
<br>
uaregood2&gt; hello i cant reelly understand step three if i do the &quot;magic&quot;<br>
uaregood2&gt; move all i get is the bad edges all over again...<br>
<br>
ryan&gt; Can you write what you did, step by step?<br>
<br>
uaregood2&gt; well, i placed the edges, then i did the L Ui Li thing. it<br>
uaregood2&gt; didn&#x27;t work, as far as i can see.<br>
<br>
ryan&gt; Can you tell us how many bad edges there were before and after?<br>

It is possible that the value does not have to be near 50. On my

          <div class="email-content">yes i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m selecting the right input device, how will i know when i&#x27;m getting close?  like on the laptop it says the timer is on, but it won&#x27;t start when i start the timer, so is that a value problem?  or something else?  when i have the numbers right should it acknowledge the timer is on, and if it does say timer is on then am i in the right range?  i also checked the input oscilloscope for the mic and do see small waves and stuff on it, and when i unplug it, they go away.  does it show timer on, and i could still have the wrong value and just need to adjust it to show that, or if it shows the timer is on is there some input problem?  i&#x27;m pretty computer literate so i think i have the basics down, for now i&#x27;ll try every value between 0-100 in groups of 5 on both computers and see what happens, if one of you guys could answer the questions i posed her that would be helpful, thanks a ton, i like the program a lot already and i haven&#x27;t even got to use the best features,
 great job :)

          <div class="email-content">ok well my laptop i figured out in the soundmax panel there was microphone filtering on, apparently it was filtering out the input, also i needed a much lower value than 50, more like 20 for me.  when i did the same thing on my desktop it started getting times, however it just jumps all over the place and gives weird results, lots of 15.15s and other weird stuff, i tried that checkbox thing, and it doesn&#x27;t fix the problem.  with any value over 9 in the config and it says the stackmat is off, should i continue to experiment with different values, or is it more than likely something else in the sound control panel...thanks for the help so far :)

  It is possible that the value does not have to be near 50. On my
  soundcard it works anywhere between 20 and 60, and maybe even up to
  70. I believe on Jeremy&#x27;s computer it once ran at a maximum of 29.
  Also, have you made sure that the correct input device was selected in
  the mixer select menu?

          <div class="email-content">Usually it gives a lot of times when the value is too low. There might
be something in your sound control panel, but I&#x27;m not too sure what
the actual problem is.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve had similar problems as Clancy.  To get mine usable, I had to 
set the value all the way down to 2!  I think there must be a lot of 
noise on my sound chip or something (it&#x27;s built into the ASUS 
motherboard).  I also can hear the &quot;pulsing&quot; noise if I enable the 
microphone on my sound mixer (this is Windows XP environment).  The 
timer works whether I make it audible or not, but I still get 
extraneous garbage times, especially at the start of a solve (when I 
put my fingers on the pads).

I really wish they would just make a USB competition timer.  This 
whole analog thing is like going back to the late 70&#x27;s when we used 
to save our BASIC programs on cassettes!

Nevertheless, CCT is an excellent piece of software... I&#x27;ll keep 
fiddling with it and share what I find.

This was the &quot;answer&quot; to how many possible color combinations there are <br>
on the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.  Where did they get this number?  Well, a Google <br>
search on &quot;1,929,770,126,028,800&quot; reveals that many sources incorrectly <br>
cite this number.<br>
<br>
The question is also posed in a curious way-- possible color <br>
combinations.  Maybe they actually tried to calculate all the ways that <br>
six colors can occupy 54 squares, but of course that number would be <br>
even higher than 43 quintillion.  Anybody know how they arrived at the <br>

According to a web page I found (http://tinyurl.com/23n9ta), this
information was published by Ideal Toys in a booklet that came with
the cube.

Factorising that number yields 2^12 * 5^2 * 11 * 17 * 449 * 224449.
This doesn&#x27;t make much sense compared to the correct number of 2^27 *
3^14 * 5^3 * 7^2 * 11. I tried playing around a little bit with some
numbers to get from one to the other, because the 449 and 224449
factors, having the same 3 digits at the end made me suspicious that
maybe they had used a &quot;.&quot; to indicate multiplication or thousands
separator and then interpreted it the other way around. Also tried
playing around with modulo arithmetic (assuming that their calculator
couldn&#x27;t deal with the size of the number). I couldn&#x27;t see any way to
make sense of it though.

Do you have a video online somewhere that you made with that camera? 
I&#x27;m curious now. I was thinking about getting a camcorder. There&#x27;s 
one that&#x27;s fairly good and costs about 220 Euros so that would be 
alright. A new laptop will cost a lot more.

I&#x27;d say the idea of moving the cube through those four subgroups *is* 
the Thistlethwaite algorithm. How you get through each of those four 
groups is entirely up to you and has nothing specifically to do with 
Thistlethwaite.

I suggest looking at this page of Jaap:

I&#x27;m sorry that you&#x27;ve had to go through so much to try to get this

problem up.

In answer to your question, I can give you a very brief explanation 
of just what the stackmat value is. I promise there will be a better 
one with pictures (on the readme) soon.

So basically, we are interpreting the signal as a sound wave, and so 
it comes in looking something like this:
                ___
      ____     |   |
     |    |    |   |
_____|    |    |   |      ....whatever...
          |    |   |____
          |____|

We need to discretize these peaks and troughs into 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s. This 
should be pretty easy to conceptualize, but programming it is kind of 
tricky for a couple of reasons:
1. These peaks and troughs are not nearly as square as I have drawn 
them.
2. The height and depth of these are not uniform throughout the timer.
3. Finally, we&#x27;ve found that the aplitude also depends upon some 
other variables such as your computer/soundcard, and your OS.

The &quot;stackmat value&quot; is a value we use to chop off the peaks and 
troughs and convert the signal to 00000111100001110000 (in the 
example I drew).

So it would make sense that if the value were too high, no peaks or 
valleys would be detected, and the program would see nothing but 
000000000000000.....

If the value were too low, noise will be introduced when is shouldn&#x27;t 
be. This is harder to explain why, and I&#x27;ll give a bettter 
explanation when I have a proper picture up.

How this affects you: If playing with the stackmat value fails to fix 
your problem, as it appears, then there is something going on (either 
with your stackmat or computer) that we did not anticipate. This is 
worth investigating. If your new sound card does not fix the problem, 
let us know, and we&#x27;ll come up with some diagnostics for you to run, 
so we can hopefully figure out your problem.

          <div class="email-content">hey no problem, i firmly believe it is worth the hassle :).  i&#x27;m getting the soundcard tonite on the way home, but soundmax is pretty common as far as onboard sound goes, so if you guys have any diagnostics i can run and it would help you out let me know.  i do have an older stackmat as well, and it has been beaten a little, i assume it should work because it works on the laptop.  also if it works on the laptop, there isn&#x27;t any settings or anything that should automatically transfer right, since you said it is based on the particular hardware on that computer, not the stackmat itself, right?

 I&#x27;m sorry that you&#x27;ve had to go through so much to try to get this 
 thing working. I really hope that a new soundcard will clear your

from your lack of response i assume that are tough enough to make snide comments about someone but not tough enough to defend those words when someone points them out.   if you have some problem with tyson email him personally don&#x27;t try and slam him in here, i for one won&#x27;t listen to it. i don&#x27;t appreciate your bad attitude and if you don&#x27;t have anything nice to say don&#x27;t say anything at all, jerk.

          <div class="email-content">The program should be completely stackmat independent, since all our 
tests have shown different stackmats outputting the same signal. This 
makes sense, given that all the stackmats work with the displays.

However, I&#x27;ll admit that we have stumbled across some very wierd 
problems where a machine would somehow have issues with newer timers 
as opposed to older ones. We believe we fixed this problem. If your 
new soundcard doesn&#x27;t work, our diagnostics will let us know whether 
there still is a stackmat-dependent problem.

Just keep us updated!

getting the soundcard tonite on the way home, but soundmax is pretty 
common as far as onboard sound goes, so if you guys have any 
diagnostics i can run and it would help you out let me know.  i do 
have an older stackmat as well, and it has been beaten a little, i 
assume it should work because it works on the laptop.  also if it 
works on the laptop, there isn&#x27;t any settings or anything that should 
automatically transfer right, since you said it is based on the 
particular hardware on that computer, not the stackmat itself, right?

I think you could also add a printer in the needed equipment. People like to
check the results to compare the results among themselves and to see if they
broke records or things like that.

Good work anyway,

          <div class="email-content">You state that a stackmat display is required.  While it would be
nice, I don&#x27;t see in the regulations where the $100 display is
required for each station, just the timers themselves.

Yes, I know with the CalCubeTimer, it doesn&#x27;t matter as much anymore,
but gathering up all those extra computers can be a hassle too.

send scrambles in a sealed envelop to all official WCA competitions. Why not
do it &quot;Just-In-Time&quot; at the competition? Because sometimes internet doesn&#x27;t
work! And a competition without scrambles.............Is called a cube
meeting.

3) Encourage competitions to have something unique. A special event, a host,
bigscreen + camera&#x27;s, Rubot, toy-fair, Olympic Cubes, meet-and-greet with
mr. Rubiks, etc.

I hope this helps,

          <div class="email-content">Though not required, they certainly add to the atmosphere and can be
rented (I think free of charge). So far all 15 competitions I&#x27;ve been
to have had them, so I consider it to be almost like an unwritten rule.

Bob, your timing is impeccable.  Thanks, I appreciate you taking the<br>
time and putting forth the effort.  I will definitely use this as a<br>
guideline to ensure I am on the right track for the Canadian Open. <br>
<br>
At some point, I&#x27;d like to see us move away from Excel sheets for<br>
score keeping.  It seems like a poor way to do it, especially given<br>
all of the programmers/developers the community has as its disposal. <br>
I believe I had read someone or group was working on something to<br>
replace this, but it seems shrouded in secrecy.  It is something that<br>
the WCA should probably initiate and provide updates on so there are<br>
not multiple people trying to create the same thing. <br>
<br>
Question:<br>
Under which scenario does the WCA actually send the scrambles out for<br>
a competition? I was not aware that was an option. <br>
<br>
And on the topic of competitions, here is our video promo for the<br>
Canadian Open.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Dave,

Some scrambles I&#x27;ve generated, but others I received via e-mail to
have them match a competition in California on the same day.

I have a feeling the conversion to automated scorekeeping will not
happen for a while. I haven&#x27;t heard much about it lately.

One possible improvement would be to add details about where to obtain the

covers?

          <div class="email-content">so i&#x27;ve been trying to talk frank into using the olympic cubes 5x5 in a competition, but he has been pretty reluctant because the regulations aren&#x27;t really clear.  in article 3 of the wca regulation i don&#x27;t see anything that says that&#x27;s a problem, and there is a specific spot in the wca regulations that says &#x27;we allow all brands of puzzles&#x27;  so is this a big deal or not, as far as regulations are concerned.  i&#x27;m sure there will be a squadron of boo-hoo&#x27;ers, but that&#x27;s not really a concern, i just wanted to know if the times would end up getting thrown out or disallowed by wca.  i can think of many other puzzles that people use that aren&#x27;t generally available to most people, ie gamecubes, deluxe, the zauberwurfel (sp?) and other old cubes, that most people would be hard pressed to find.  also the square one isn&#x27;t that easy to find anymore.  has a vote been taken on this, or should there be one, or is it permitted without a problem?<br>

          <div class="email-content">I once had an experience where I waited roughly that long and never recieved a fairly large shipment (4-5 sets of tiles). I talked to him about it and he sent me a replacement shipment. But then the next day, the original one finally came. (Obviously a USPS problem)

So I ended up getting a bunch of extra tiles, but he and I were able to work it out.

He is good to do business with, I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s just busy. Just keep waiting.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve been waiting for another one of these posts about Cubesmith. In
my opinion we should give him a break. How many times has he gotten
this far behind, and it&#x27;s only due to a machine breaking. He has
always been our best source for replacement stickers. I think we
should just relax a bit and realize his machine is down and he is
doing the best he can right now and soon it will back to normal. 

Thanks Cubesmith for the best replacement stickers,

David

          <div class="email-content">F2L - First 2 Layers basically getting a corner and its corresponding
edge in the correct place at the same time. 

OLL - Oreintation of the Last Layer making all of the corner and edge
pieces flip to become the color of the last layer

PLL - Permutation of the last layer placing corner and edges into
there correct spots.

I use Fridrich Method with cross on left I think Leyan does it like
that some people also prefer cross on bottom. I haven&#x27;t used any other
methods so far but I&#x27;m sure someone will recommend a different one.

Ah, ok. I thought he was reluctant because he himself didn&#x27;t want to 
have an advantage because of it.

1) The &quot;generally available&quot; requirement was thrown out:
http://worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/regulations_history.html

2) Those puzzles you mention were at least at some point generally 
available, and do appear on ebay fairly often. Not the Olympicubes.

3) Zauberwürfel is a generic term, just means &quot;magic cube&quot;, applies 
to pretty much any cubes, no?

Yeah, I think he still is backed up. I ordered some stickers on April 1st,
and they haven&#x27;t come yet. He should be getting it fixed soon, and some of
my friends who ordered mid-late march have started getting their orders.

          <div class="email-content">well honestly i don&#x27;t see its much of an advantage its not like he&#x27;s getting sub 90 times on the OC versus the regular ones.  and i think there are very few people that can give him a run on the 5x5 anyway, anyone that seriously has a problem with it is probably just grasping at straws anyway, because they know he would probably beat them anyway. and it follows the guidelines of the rules that its a normal moving puzzle with comparison to the other 5x5&#x27;s that are out.  if i built my own 5x5 that i thought was great i&#x27;d want to use it.  he&#x27;s a much nicer and fair guy than me honestly, but i&#x27;m just curious to what the wca would do?  not allowed, throw out the times, or other equally bad things, does anyone from the board have something to say about it? i think unless we are all required to use the same brand, make, and model of cubes, it seems rather selfish to disallow a certain kind, just because other people can&#x27;t get them.  getting a deluxe cube or a game cube is a matter
 of timing and luck, just like getting the OC&#x27;s were for him.  he has been a pioneer of 5x5 times, and from his hard work he was afforded an opportunity, that i think he should be able to capitalize on.  i tried to respond to your post below

 Ah, ok. I thought he was reluctant because he himself didn&#x27;t want to

well i can&#x27;t comment on every single thing frank does and doesn&#x27;t think exactly about it, i&#x27;m sure he&#x27;d be willing to tell you if you asked

 http://worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/regulations_history.html
 
 2) Those puzzles you mention were at least at some point generally 
 available, and do appear on ebay fairly often. Not the Olympicubes.
i&#x27;d say were available and are available are 2 very different things.  unless you were alive during the times they were available you&#x27;re not going to be able to get them,  and especially not on a mass scale where everyone that wants one can get it.  i don&#x27;t know lots of &#x27;old cube&#x27; terms, i just know the ones that acutally say zauberwurfel that are the plastic cases are supposed to be good for speedcubes and are pretty rare.
 3) Zauberwürfel is a generic term, just means &quot;magic cube&quot;, applies

that&#x27;s not a an original square one, its a cube 21, and anything on ebay i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;d agree is &#x27;generally available&#x27;  because everyone that wants one can&#x27;t get it.

Ah, now I see. Frank lent you the cube and you wanna use it yourself. 
Admit it!

Anyway, with the &quot;generally available&quot; requirement officially gone, I 
don&#x27;t see that the WCA would forbid it. As far as I can see, that was 
the only rule possibly doing that.

Cheers!

Subject: [Speed cubing group] advancing<br>
<br>
<br>
I recently started to do rubiks cubes maybe a month ago. I was<br>
wondering what I should go to next. I&#x27;ve done Leyan Lo&#x27;s Beginner&#x27;s<br>
guide. With this I average about a minute and a half. Wondering if i<br>
should go to the Fridrich method or do somthing else, or even just<br>
having to get faster. any advice is appreciated. BTW even though i know<br>
how to solve a rubik&#x27;s cube i&#x27;m still confused on the abbr such as OLL<br>
and F2L.<br>

          <div class="email-content">The room was way too small.  Unfortunately, we didn&#x27;t realize that
many people were going to show up because people didn&#x27;t preregister
until a lot later.  By then, we were unable to get a larger room.  I
guess people don&#x27;t understand the reason we ask everyone to
preregister is so that we can accommodate everyone.  It doesn&#x27;t help
us out when 40 more people preregister the week before the tournament.
 Next semester we&#x27;re going to start planning further in advance and
hopefully we&#x27;ll be able to reserve a much larger room.  Oh, and
hopefully next semester we&#x27;ll have our own equipment so that we can
set up earlier on our own in order to get started on time.

Oh, and while I&#x27;m at it, I want to thank the Caltech people for
letting us use their equipment and also to all the competitors that
came out.  I hope you had fun and I apologize for it being so hectic.
 I promise next semester&#x27;s tournament will be better.

It is basicly a antisune at first but it is ended in a diffrent way. 
The last five L U&#x27; R&#x27; U M you can change to R B&#x27; R&#x27; B and it does CLL 
for the same case instead of COLL.

just pointing out people would probably be more likely to help you if

In any case, Tyson Mao, Shotaro Makisumi and Stefan Pochmann have all

Come early (9:00-9:30am) with a philips screwdriver that fits it and 
I&#x27;ll fix it for you. There should be instructions that came with the 
puzzle on how to assemble it though.

          <div class="email-content">Is it just me, or has this yahoo group been getting less and less able
to use Google/Yahoo/dogpile/any-search-engine/common sense?

I&#x27;m not trying to be rude. I know kunu822 is just looking for help,
but it just seems there have been many &quot;Help I can&#x27;t do thiz! helpz!&quot;
for the most simplest of questions.

Lately people haven&#x27;t been spelling Fridrich correctly, asking
questions that could be answered quicker by doing a bit of searching,
irrelevant double postings, just a bunch of stuff to clutter this
Yahoo group up.

Oh well, there&#x27;s not much I can do, or anyone else for that matter.

Just, for everyone&#x27;s sake, do 5 minutes of googling before you ask a
question.

Cheers,

Mike Carroll

Haha taht was the great part about learnin the OLLS, i did them over 
and over again until it went back to normal. This simply changed 
everything into muscle memory. And with the similar algs, i jsut 
practised and got to each one.

The answer was already given by Stefan. And Frank has known the answer for 
ages.
Yes, you can use an Olympicube in a competition.

It is better to ask such questions on the WCA forum. There we have a clear 
history of discussions in a specific regulations forum.

Have fun,

Ron

At least in the previous competitions where this happened (as far as 
I know, only Euro2004/Euro2006/WC2005) as well as the upcoming 
WC2007, I think you knew/know it from the competition pages.

For WC2007, it&#x27;s mentioned here:

To make it even clearer, I recommend removing all but the first three 
sections (WCA, Regulations, Competitions) from the WCA forum. The 
other sections are already (and better) covered in other places, and 
they only deflect from the core purpose of the WCA forum.

&gt; At least in the previous competitions where this happened (as far as <br>
&gt; I know, only Euro2004/Euro2006/WC2005) as well as the upcoming <br>
&gt; WC2007, I think you knew/know it from the competition pages.<br>
<br>
No, I didn&#x27;t know it (I&#x27;ve never seen those pages), and am not even sure<br>
if I still know it *now* that you&#x27;ve mentioned these pages to me.<br>
<br>
The official place that mentions WCA rules and regulations is at the WCA<br>
website, and it is not clear from, say, Article 8 that a competition can<br>
change any of these rules, except for imposing time limits (8d).<br>
<br>
The rules for allowed cubes are in Article 3, and according to that,<br>
non-Rubik&#x27;s brands are allowed, but somehow at WC2007, according to the<br>
link you gave me, non-Rubik&#x27;s brands are not allowed.<br>
<br>
Which clause in the official WCA rules and regulations allows a sponsor<br>
to change those rules? The document makes it clear that time limits may<br>
be changed, but not that rules in Article 3 can be changed. I&#x27;m not<br>
saying that it isn&#x27;t there, but just that it&#x27;s just not clear, which I<br>
think is a problem.<br>
<br>
In the future, I will write a post on the WCA forum detailing the<br>
articles/clauses that I think are ambiguous or unclear, or the ones that<br>
really state nothing and could be deleted without having any effect. I<br>
agree that that discussion belongs there.<br>
<br>
But as for whether the community thinks the WCA should allow sponsors to<br>
make such rule changes described above, I don&#x27;t mind if we discuss that<br>
here. Here are my thoughts:<br>
<br>
    - According to Ron&#x27;s earlier statement/question &quot;Do you think I like<br>
      this situation?&quot; it sounds like the WCA are being pressured into<br>
      allowing this (the fact that the WCA regulations don&#x27;t make it<br>
      clear that they /can/ allow this is a different matter). Somehow I<br>
      feel we still don&#x27;t have the full story on this. I don&#x27;t know<br>
      exactly what the &quot;situation&quot; is that Ron speaks of.<br>
<br>
    - Assuming it is that the sponsor in question is the owner of the<br>
      Rubik&#x27;s trademark and that they may exercise legal power to shut<br>
      down the WCA if they do not agree to block non-rubik&#x27;s brands,<br>
      well I say we don&#x27;t have anything to worry about there. If you<br>
      don&#x27;t think so, then the WCA should hire a lawyer to look into it,<br>
      seriously. (IANAL, but I am familiar with the registered<br>
      trademarks)<br>
<br>
    - If it is that the sponsor is a major money provider and so the WCA<br>
      has decided to allow the sponsor to block out competing brands<br>
      just to get the money, then I have no respect for this, sorry.<br>
<br>
If the WCA were more strict to sponsors about allowing all brands<br>
equally in all competitions, I honestly think they will just quietly go<br>
along with it. Can you really imagine the owner of the Rubik&#x27;s trademark<br>
making a big legal fuss about the WCA and try to shut it down? I don&#x27;t<br>
think it will happen (or even /could/ happen), but even hypothetically<br>
if it did, it would still be good publicity for the WCA.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Some results from Rutgers Spring 2007:<br>
<br>
3x3:  	Mitchell Stern 	14.xx  average<br>
	Anthony Hsu  	15.xx<br>
	Ian Winokur	16.5x<br>
<br>
5x5:	Doug Li	2:3x.xx average<br>
<br>
Magic &amp; Master Magic: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place were Tim Reynolds, Bob<br>
Burton, and Peter Greenwood<br>
<br>
3x3 OH:	Anthony Hsu<br>
<br>
BLD:		Anthony Hsu  <br>
	        I think Rowe W. Hessler finished 2nd<br>
	        Tim Reynolds<br>
<br>
The 4x4 event was cancelled for time reasons.<br>
<br>
Yesterday&#x27;s event was really great.  Congrats to Anthony and Tim for<br>
placing in just about every event (Tim strengthed his national record<br>
on the magic by .01 seconds) and congrats to Mitchell for winning the<br>
first tournament he ever entered!  I judged his first solve in the<br>
first round.  I wasn&#x27;t really paying attention so I was floored when<br>
he stopped the timer at about 14.3!  I think Anthony was in first<br>
place after each of the first two rounds (he got an 11.2 single solve<br>
at some point) but Mitchell was the best in the finals.  <br>
<br>
I did way better than I was expecting to at the 3x3.  I considered<br>
myself retired after my last competition which was one year ago.  I<br>
haven&#x27;t cubed much since then and I haven&#x27;t seriously practiced since<br>
right before Orlando in November 2005.  Back when I was cubing<br>
regularly, I probably averaged mid 19s so I was surprised that my<br>
averages in the first two rounds of yesterday&#x27;s tournament were 19.2<br>
and 19.5.  I was even more surprised to have five 16s in the finals! <br>
In a typical average of 12 at home, I&#x27;d probably get one 16s solve.  I<br>
couldn&#x27;t believe I hit five in a row at Rutgers.  Major props to James<br>
Ouyang who judged 4 of my 5 solves in the finalshe&#x27;s my new favorite<br>
judge!<br>
<br>
I was also really happy to have my first successful BLD solve in a<br>
competition.  I got 7:19 on my first attempt and I was so relieved to<br>
see a solved cube when I took off the blindfold.  I missed my second<br>
attempt but managed a 5:10 on my third attempt which is really fast<br>
for me!<br>
<br>
Chris Parlette (fear the turtle) and I did some team BLD solves for<br>
fun and I think our best was about 55 seconds.  Tim Reynolds and I<br>
carpooled together so we cubed on the way home.  Our best team BLD<br>
time with me calling was 46 seconds and our best with him calling was<br>
45 seconds.<br>
<br>
This tourney was really well run and was a lot of fun.  I met some old<br>
friends and made some new ones.  Much thanks to Bob (and the whole<br>
Burton family) for running another great tournament (complete with<br>
free pizza and fancy certificates and cube trophies for the winners!).<br>

          <div class="email-content">Nice job to everyone, especially Ian and Mitchell.  And Anthony.  And 
Doug.  And Bob.  Oh, heck, especially everyone.

Doug won the 5x5 by about 30 seconds (the 2nd and 3rd place averages 
were 3:03 and 3:04 or something).  Anthony would have gotten sub-3 
probably, but he popped on two solves.

Nice job Ian on getting your BLD solve.  I guess we won&#x27;t be seeing 
you much more, but at least you got what you came for.

For me, my biggest disappointment was a 1.13 magic DNF.  It was a 
very close call, and I&#x27;d have had a 1.20 average if it weren&#x27;t a 
DNF.  I was surprised by my consistency throughout the day (my 3x3 
averages were 18.24, 18.26, 18.30), but more surprised by Ian&#x27;s 
improvement in the finals.  Great job.

And, Ian, I won&#x27;t betray your trust anymore.  I&#x27;m not going to post 
your (and James&#x27;) secret here :)

There was a mystery event as well.  Peter, Doug, and Dan Beyer each 
had a scrambled cube with all three parities.  Peter won easily with 
a 38 I think, with Doug in second.  I&#x27;m not quite sure what happened 
with Dan; I think he gave up after 50 seconds.

Thanks so much, Bob, your last Rutgers tourney was a great one.

Tim

I ordered all the algorithms (at least most of them) according to

Sorry guys if I didn&#x27;t follow the etiquette here. I tried the search
method and I didn&#x27;t find the answer to my question. And actually, I
spent 10 minutes googling. But now I figured it out. Sorry once again,
and thanks to that member who posted the jasa86 site. 

Now sorry if I&#x27;m a pain, and I&#x27;m pretty sure this hasn&#x27;t been answered
recently or on any website I know of, how do you guys all remember the
algs for the F2L

It is answered on Fridrich&#x27;s own website!<br>

And, it has been answered numerous times on this group - but I don&#x27;t<br>
blame you for not being able to find that. It is not very practical to<br>
search the archives.<br>

Anyway, I find these questions useful so that I can learn what sort of<br>

Practice the moves until they become ingrained in muscle memory.
Nothing fancy.

&gt; I totally agree.  It&#x27;s annoying seeing the same couple of topics pop <br>
&gt; up every other week.  Thats why Ryan made the Wiki like site in the <br>

Although, I would say it is far from useful to its target audience right<br>
at this point in time.<br>
<br>
I am closely monitoring all of the common questions that pop up, and<br>
will add them to the Oracle as I see them. I guess that within about 6<br>
months, it might eventually become be a useful resource for new members.<br>
<br>
One way of answering questions on this group, if it has been answered in<br>
that system, is to post a link to the question from here.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, we still need people to write answers. I have added a number<br>
of questions recently which I think are good questions, but I myself do<br>
not know the answers to them:<br>

Your replacements have a tough act to follow... :)

That mystery event was great. Dan popped at around 15-20 seconds, put
it back together and popped again later and ended up just giving up. :P

Also, if anyone walked away with my megaminx, it would be great if I
could get it back. Thanks :) It has cubesmith stickers, 12 colors.

Thanks again Bob and everyone!

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,

Needless to say, I&#x27;m very glad with the turnout of my first
competition :). Congratulations to everyone!

In case anyone was wondering, the scrambles for the Final 3x3
Speedsolve Round were extremely easy! I think 3 or 4 of the solves had
4 or less move crosses, easy F2Ls, and my LL cases were pretty easy too!

I&#x27;m also happy with my 4:3x BLD solve. One of my best, and at a
competition too.

Anyways, I had a great time meeting everyone. I had a lot of fun!

-Mitchell

P.S. Does anyone know Anthony Hsu or Andrew Spelman&#x27;s email addresses?

          <div class="email-content">My little(?) Rutgers report:<br>
<br>
Overall, I was pretty happy with my performance. I had personal best<br>
competition times in both 3x3x3 and 5x5x5. Unfortunately, unlike Ian,<br>
I did not did not yet get my first official BLD solve. In any case,<br>
somehow I seem to have come home with a trophy in my possession. (Is<br>
anyone missing a trophy? :-) )<br>
<br>
I think this was the first competition where I attempted<br>
Fridrich-style solving (with 3LLL). My first two attempts were<br>
Fridrich-style, but I made mistakes and got times on the order of 85<br>
seconds each, assuring me of a poor average relative to what I would<br>
have liked to have gotten. My best time (41.56 I think) I got using my<br>
version of the Varasano corners first method. During pre-inspection I<br>
failed to come up with a plan for a cross or a Guimond case, so I<br>
decided to go with a Varasano-style solve. So I got my personal best<br>
official time with essentially nothing planned out during<br>
preinspection. I did another corners first solve with a Guimond-style<br>
start (I think). Then on my last attempt, I went with a Fridrich-style<br>
(surprising my judge) and this time got a fairly decent time (for me),<br>
51.xx I think.<br>
<br>
In 5x5x5, I thought it would be nice to get a sub-7-minute solve,<br>
after having shattered my time from U.S. Nationals (9:58.28) at<br>
Cornell with two solves in the 7+ minute range. Well, I surprised<br>
myself with two sub-7 times, including a 6:18.xx in my first attempt.<br>
I&#x27;ve rarely had that good of time at home. (Still, it was only good<br>
enough for 2nd to last place.)<br>
<br>
In BLD, I have trouble getting my solves done within ten minutes, and<br>
as I expected, a 10-minute limit per solve was imposed. Also, a<br>
20-minute limit was imposed for all 3 solves. My first solve I managed<br>
to do fairly  quickly (for me), around 8.5 to 9 minutes, but at one<br>
point early on, when I came to undoing a setup move, I realized that I<br>
believed I had done a quarter-turn setup move that should have been a<br>
half-turn. I went on with the solve hoping that I had done the correct<br>
setup, but I ended up with all the cubies oriented for my orientation<br>
scheme, but several cubies out of place.<br>
<br>
My 2nd BLD attempt I had trouble memorizing. Finally I put the<br>
blindfold on, then (before having made any moves) took it off again to<br>
refresh my corners memorization. I think it was now over eight minutes<br>
when I finally started the solve phase. As I was solving, I kept<br>
expecting to have the judge tell me my time was up, but that didn&#x27;t<br>
happen. When I got to my last step, which is permuting edges, I was<br>
sure I couldn&#x27;t get it done within the 10-minute limit, so I simply<br>
stopped the timer to see if I had at least gotten this far without an<br>
execution mistake (I hadn&#x27;t). When I looked at the time, I was not<br>
only surprised to see that the time hadn&#x27;t run out, but that the time<br>
was ...(drum roll)... 9:58.27. Compare that with my U.S. Nationals<br>
5x5x5 time! Of course, this one will just appear as DNF on the<br>
competition results.<br>
<br>
(Speaking of my U.S. Nationals 5x5x5 result, at Cornell I mentioned to<br>
Leyan that I had finally beaten my 5x5x5 time from U.S. Nationals, and<br>
he asked me in which direction I had beaten it.)<br>
<br>
Going into the competition, I was almost certain I could get a new<br>
personal best competition time in 4x4x4. Unfortunately that event was<br>
cancelled.<br>
<br>
Well, any way, thanks to Bob for hosting this and the other past<br>
Rutgers competitions, and to everyone who helped out with those<br>
competitions.<br>

This is my first message in the group and I will start it telling a little
bit about me. My name is Guilherme Baron, I am a Systems Analyst working for
Wipro Technologies (an Indian company) and I restarted in the Cube world
(Because I always loved it but was far away from cubes for more than 10
years). I can do the cube using the basic method with around 2 minutes and
starting study VH System trying to do something better.

Anyway, I toke a look in that website http://www.cube4you.com and the good
thing is that they ship to Brazil, one of my problems since here we don&#x27;t
have any good brand to sell.

My question is about their brands... how about Eastsheen? Are their cubes
good? Are they compared to Rubik&#x27;s or better than? And about the website.
Can I buy there confident?

Thanks for your helping


Cheers
Guilherme

 I can gladly tell you all that the swedish cube page, www.svekub.se,
 is up and running again after three months offline. Thanks to my
 brother who has taken over the role as webmaster it will probably stay
 online.
 
 The site is quite important for the swedish cube community, since the

          <div class="email-content">well frank taught me this:  when starting, find a particular set of edges that you do first everytime, ie all yellow/white edges. then after you have built up your ability to quickly find pieces, you can start doing whatever is easiest.  also check out the methods for pairing on our site www.bigcubes.com

Maybe everyone remembers the controversy for WC2003. If not, enjoy. It<br>
is recommended reading :-)<br>
<br>
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/5431<br>
<br>
The most interesting requirements of the sponsors, in my opinion, were<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
- The cube must present the Rubik&#x27;s logo on the white centre sticker.<br>
- The cube must use the red/orange/yellow/white/blue/green stickers.<br>
- The cube must use black plastic.<br>
<br>
As you may know, the patent on the Rubik&#x27;s Cube puzzle has now expired,<br>
which means that it is now possible for other companies to legally make<br>
cubes with the same function. This is good for cubing as a sport,<br>
because any serious sport needs to allow several competing manufactures<br>
to produce the gear, and this competition will drive them to produce<br>
better quality cubes.<br>
<br>
However, Seven Towns are still actively trying to stamp out their<br>

<br>
It is just my speculation, but maybe they wanted us to become used to<br>
these particular colours because these are the colours where they<br>
actually have control over the market.<br>
<br>
Anyway, why did the WCA allow Seven Towns to do something similar again<br>
in 2007? I can understand why Seven Towns did it: because WCA gave them<br>
the power to, and so why not seize the opportunity.<br>
<br>
I wish the WCA were strongly against it, but in fact they (Ron) are<br>
actually of two minds. Ron has stated that he does &quot;not like this<br>
situation&quot;, and that maybe the future will be a bit brighter.<br>
<br>
But at the same time Ron also said the following:<br>
<br>
&gt; Still I personally think that in a cola drinking competition sponsored<br>
&gt; by Coca Cola, it is reasonable that competitors can only drink Coca<br>
&gt; Cola, no Pepsi or Dr Pepper. <br>
<br>
This does not inspire a lot of confidence. Personally, I don&#x27;t think<br>
that if Slazenger sponsored a major tennis tournament, that they would<br>
be allowed to force all competitors to use Slazenger brand racquets! Do<br>
we want to associate our sport with a serious sport like Tennis, or a<br>
joke sport like cola drinking? (Sorry if I offended anyone who takes<br>
cola drinking seriously ;-)<br>
<br>
I am not certain, but I also think that Seven Towns may be becoming more<br>
relaxed about the issue. The patent has expired, and there are ways of<br>
making legal alternatives that have the same function as Rubik&#x27;s Cube.<br>
Maybe there will be a bright future, with healthy competition in the<br>
marketplace.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, WC2007 should not be thought of as the world<br>
championships for cubing, but rather just a special event to honour the<br>
Rubik&#x27;s brand. A serious world championships in any serious sport should<br>
not be closed to only the brands made by the sponsor, and so it is<br>
unfortunate that this event happens to be given the title &quot;world<br>
championships&quot; when the nature of the event is more focused around<br>
Rubik&#x27;s brand-only competition.<br>

I recently made a sizable order from them.  It was mostly all right. 
However, my Master Magic was unsolvable, having two tiles switched...
 Everything else was fine though.

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

I still remember Tyson Mao at the 2x2 event in 2005. He said that 
the competition was not really a speedcubing competition, but more 
like a &quot;Rubik&#x27;s party&quot;. And that&#x27;s exactly what it is. 

The way I see it: The sponsors are mainly interested in doing 
bussiness and getting media attention. They don&#x27;t give a F*** about 
the interest or pleasure of the competitors, who travel long 
distances to make the whole competition possible in the first place, 
who want to do everything possible to set good times. The sponsor 
doesn&#x27;t care about whether we have to compete in the burning sun, or 
if it&#x27;s freezing cold. I know, in Florida the circumstances were the 
same for everybody, and it was a fair competition, I am just saying 
that the sponsor doesn&#x27;t care much about making the circumstances 
optimal for cubing. They care about making the circumstances optimal 
for having a nice &quot;media event&quot;. Anyways, that&#x27;s just how I see it.

Oh, one question: do I have to use sticker produced by Rubik&#x27;s at 
the worlds? How about cubesmith?

Yes, I guess that&#x27;s how I see it, too. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am not<br>
against Rubik&#x27;s parties, and I like the idea of an anniversary party for<br>
the Rubik&#x27;s cube. I just think the event was incorrectly named as a<br>
world championship for &quot;cubing&quot;, since this competition is closed to<br>
only Rubik&#x27;s-only brands, whereas cubing is a more general sport.<br>
<br>
I think Seven Towns is in a difficult position deciding what to do here,<br>

sport to grow very large, which in the end will help everyone.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi!

To be honest, we don&#x27;t know! Kåre has updated the base code, the forum
code and some other patches and stuff. Also he has removed the
cube-wiki, since we think it may be a big security hole there since
people are allowed to upload stuff quite freely.

I&#x27;m hoping the updated features are safer!

but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much we can do about it...

 I still remember Tyson Mao at the 2x2 event in 2005. He said that 
 the competition was not really a speedcubing competition, but more 
 like a &quot;Rubik&#x27;s party&quot;. And that&#x27;s exactly what it is. 
 
 The way I see it: The sponsors are mainly interested in doing 
 bussiness and getting media attention. They don&#x27;t give a F*** about 
 the interest or pleasure of the competitors, who travel long 
 distances to make the whole competition possible in the first place, 
 who want to do everything possible to set good times. The sponsor 
 doesn&#x27;t care about whether we have to compete in the burning sun, or 
 if it&#x27;s freezing cold. I know, in Florida the circumstances were the 
 same for everybody, and it was a fair competition, I am just saying 
 that the sponsor doesn&#x27;t care much about making the circumstances 
 optimal for cubing. They care about making the circumstances optimal 
 for having a nice &quot;media event&quot;. Anyways, that&#x27;s just how I see it.
 
 Oh, one question: do I have to use sticker produced by Rubik&#x27;s at 
 the worlds? How about cubesmith?
 
 - Joël.

than taking a cab downtown or renting a car, you can take the train

If you do want to rent a car, I&#x27;m guessing the airport will have a few
car rental counters.

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;ve thought a lot about this issue.  That does not<br>
seperate me from the majority however.  The problem<br>
(as I see it) is that not enough people vocalize their<br>
thoughts on this (and similar) issue(s).<br>
<br>
In 2003 the restrictions were acceptable because they<br>
were something we had to swallow.  And why not?  We<br>
owe a lot of thanks to SevenTowns.  I&#x27;m not defending<br>
the recent pressure to restrict competitions.<br>
<br>
The strangest thing to me is that we have to have this<br>
discussion at all.  As I said above, we owe a lot of<br>
thanks to 7towns, but we no longer need their support<br>
in the same way as before.  I owe a lot of thanks to<br>
my parents for raising me and providing me an<br>
acceptable start in life.  Just because they did well<br>
and I am grateful would not justify their bullying me<br>
into making decisions of their choosing.  To clarify<br>
on the analogy: SevenTowns was a wonderful incubator<br>
for the community, but we have simply outgrown their<br>
influence.  <br>
<br>
Ryan made some viable points as well regarding this<br>
whole situation.  Read them again if you are unsure.<br>
<br>
I also have to express my discontent with WCA<br>
authority ignoring important questions.  <br>
<br>
I understand there is a WCA forum, but this is where<br>
the bulk of the community finds their information. <br>
Ten people telling 1000 people where to find<br>
information makes less sense than 1000 people telling<br>
those ten where to provide it.<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#x27;m busy&quot; isn&#x27;t an acceptable excuse anymore for WCA<br>
officials.  Either stop doing the job (i hope you<br>
don&#x27;t) or find more people and delegate<br>
responsibility.  It&#x27;s not terribly difficult and I<br>
don&#x27;t see the weakness in expanding the board some.  <br>
<br>
I would like to see a WCA board member&#x27;s expanded<br>
answer on why we are still selling out to 7towns every<br>
two years?  Or do we need the biannual reminder that<br>
we aren&#x27;t a strong enough organization.<br>
<br>
And regarding the above, I would like to see each<br>
board members opinion on the situation.  <br>
<br>
Is our board absent?<br>
<br>
With all due contempt,<br>

          <div class="email-content">Another method is the Petrus method: http://lar5.com/cube<br>
<br>
Personally, I use a combination of the Petrus and Fridrich methods: a Petrus first two layers (F2L) and a Fridrich last layer (LL).<br>
<br>
I do steps 1 - 4a of the Petrus method intuitively, so no move sequences need to be memorized.  For step 4b (the last step of the F2L), take a look at this page: http://lar5.com/cube/s4b.html<br>
Once you understand how the pieces are being moved around, this step can be done fairly intuitively as well.  I would only memorize the more difficult cases, which are in the last two rows.  I know all the cases, but I only consider myself as having memorized 8 move sequences because the others are intuitive to me.<br>
<br>
Since you orient the edges in step 3 (which can be done intuitively once you understand how the edges are being flipped (see the Advanced section at http://lar5.com/cube/fas3.html)), when you reach the LL, all edges will be oriented.  Thus, Fridrich OLL + PLL only requires memorization of 28 move sequences.  Thus, in total, you only need to memorize around 36 move sequences (or a few more if your first two layers is less intuitive).  Using this method, I have averaged under 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
To be fast with this method, you need to focus on fewer moves in your intuitive solutions for steps 1 - 4a.  Hop on over to the petrusmethod Yahoo! Group (http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/petrusmethod/) for more information and help with this method.  Recently, there&#x27;s been discussion and analysis about the maximum number of turns required for each step.<br>

  Subject: [Speed cubing group] The fridrich methos<br>
<br>
<br>
  Right now I can solve the cube with a basic method in 45 seconds. Is <br>
  there a really solid guide to the fridrich method? I would prefer <br>
  video, but if it is pretty good, then its fine with me. I also heard <br>
  that you have to memorize like a hundred algorithims. Is it true? and <br>
  is it that hard to memorize them? I it really is that hard, then can <br>
  you give me another fast method to try?<br>

&gt; &gt; 3915 or 3916 if you keep the solved case.<br>
&gt; &gt; -Doug Li<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; That&#x27;s odd. I just got 3914 (incl solved case, 3913 without).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The calculation uses Burnside&#x27;s Lemma:<br>
&gt; http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/theory.htm<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; There are indeed 62208 = 4!*4!/2 *3^3 *2^3 positions. Rotating U <br>
&gt; doesn&#x27;t quite divide it by 4 since there are some positions that are <br>
&gt; not changed by a U2 rotation, and even a few unchanged by a U or U&#x27;.<br>
&gt; Burnside accounts for this.<br>
&gt; There are 16 = 4*4/2 *1*2 positions unchanged by U or U&#x27;.<br>
&gt; There are 384 = 8*8/2 *3*4 positions unchanged by U2.<br>
&gt; So burnside gives the answer (62208 + 16+16+384)/4 = 15656 positions <br>
&gt; if you don&#x27;t care about U rotations. This does however assume a fixed <br>
&gt; colour on the front of the cube. Divide by 4 to account for the <br>
&gt; choice of front colour (note that none of the 15656 will be the same <br>
&gt; after a cube rotation because they are not the same after a U layer <br>
&gt; turn).<br>
&gt; This gives 15656/4 = 3914 positions.<br>
<br>
Your calculations are correct up to the answer 15656, however dividing<br>
by 4 is not correct - you need to consider the 4 choices of the front<br>
colour within the framework of Burnside&#x27;s Lemma to get the correct<br>
answer.<br>
<br>
Above, for each U-turn t you checked that a permutation p is fixed if<br>
<br>
    p = t p t&#x27;<br>
<br>
Instead, for each U-turn t1 and U-turn t2, you should check that a<br>
permutation p is fixed if<br>
<br>
    p = t1 p t1&#x27; t2<br>
<br>
where a U-turn is one of { U0, U1, U2, U3 }.<br>
<br>
This makes 4 times as many symmetries, and if all of the additional<br>
symmetries have zero fixed points, then this will be the same as<br>
dividing by 4. Since we know that dividing by 4 gives an incorrect<br>
answer, we should expect some additional fixed points.<br>
<br>
Jaap, maybe you know if there a smart way to calculate the number of<br>
fixed points for symmetries of the second form (i.e. t1 p t1&#x27; t2) ?<br>

of the megaminx with what you already know - give it a try before 
diving right into someone else&#x27;s solution.  You will just need to

I will admit that mine is lacking a bit in the area of artistic 
value.  It&#x27;s an almost entirely text description (one image shows my

Stefan&#x27;s approach is similar to mine; he actually links to my 
solution, but has some additional insights that are a good read, and 
also has some tips on how to prep your megaminx for speed.

Finally, Jaap&#x27;s solution assumes that you can figure out all but the

about.  If he is still around here, perhaps he can provide that link

I think it&#x27;s incredibly stupid to not allow any other brand then Rubik.<br>

Also i heard every rubik cube has to have a sticker with the logo.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Just got the game as well. The standard color scheme of the cubes is
white opposite blue, but this can be customized (colors of all faces
are fully customizable.

The controls are the same as most 3D applets. Dragging outside the
cube rotates it, and dragging on edges/corner pieces rotates that
face. Depending on the angle the cube is in, this works OK, but if you
have the cube in the situation where all three visible faces are
equally visible, the behaviour seems pretty random. The buttons on the
NDS can be used to to &#x27;peek around&#x27;. The direction keys for example
will rotate the cube to 90 degrees in a certain direction while you
hold one of them. When you release, it will jump back to the position
you were first in. Also there&#x27;s a quick undo button. However there
seems to be no way to manipulate the cube (turning any faces) using
the buttons. 

Also there&#x27;s a tutorial mode which teaches to solve the cube. The
system it teaches seems to be as follows:
- Get edge pieces of the cross on the top layer (with the right
orientation)
- Permutate edge pieces
- Place corner pieces of first layer
- Place second layer pieces
- Orient LL edges
- Orient LL corners
- Permutate LL corners
- Permutate LL edges

Aside from the cube solving there&#x27;s also a mode where you have to
match certain patterns that are showed on the top screen.

I haven&#x27;t really used/played the game yet, but these seem to be the
basic contents. There&#x27;s also a multiplayer mode.. Haven&#x27;t tried
connecting to the internet, but you can race CPU opponents too.

I&#x27;ll start around with it a little now, if you guys have any question
just shoot.

          <div class="email-content">Eastsheen 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 are smaller then the Rubik ones. However, the 2x2x2 is bigger then the rubik one.
Everyone who does well is 2x2x2 uses an eastsheen, at least in europe. 
For the 4x4x4 both are possible for fast times.

I honestly think all questions are answered. (at least those asked in a 
respectful way)

The only issue that remains is that we did not succeed yet in making sure 
that for WC 2007 all puzzle brands are allowed. I already told that we are 
working on this, and that we kind of got the answer that WC 2007 will be the 
last competition with this issue. We continue to strive that also WC 2007 
will be brand neutral.

It is clear that every cuber here would want to use any of the brands. It is 
(or should be) a free world.
That is also why WCA is brand neutral.

> SevenTowns was a wonderful incubator for the community, but we have simply

I do not agree on this. Seventowns are organizing (and have organized) some 
great competitions. Competitions we would not have had without their 
support.
Did you know that in 2007 Seventowns are involved in organizing the 
following competitions:
- Roissy 2007 (with Winning Moves France)
- France 2007 (with Winning Moves France)
- Spanish Open 2007
- Italian Open 2007
- World Championship 2007
- US Open 2007
I am not mentioning the many competitions where they do smaller things (like 
helping with the equipment et cetera).
What happens is that they are the main organizers of the big competitions. 
For the smaller competitions they help us find the sponsors (often local 
distributors) and help organize the first edition of the competition. From 
then on they hope that things will become successful in the next couple of 
years and that the local organization teams can run the show with only 
little support.

Anyway, although they are helping us extremely well, this does not mean that 
we should not have are own requirements, like allowing all brands.

To answer your new question:
> I would like to see a WCA board member&#x27;s expanded
> answer on why we are still selling out to 7towns every
> two years?
Without Seventowns there would be no big competition on 5/6/7 October 2007, 
with big prizes, in a wonderful venue, with many competitors from all over 
the world. WCA calls it the World Rubik&#x27;s Cube Championship 2007.
I think this is going to be the best competition ever. Best in many ways. 
There is an issue though, the organizers had the requirement that only 
Rubik&#x27;s brand puzzles are allowed. WCA do not like it. WCA asked to allow 
all puzzle brands. The answer up until last Thursday was still NO. WCA is 
still working on it.
Any more questions?

I will ask the other board members to answer too.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Ryan,

The view of WCA is that all brands of puzzles should be allowed in WCA 
competitions. Unless the puzzles violate the WCA regulations of course.

>Can you please reply to the question at the head of this thread
I have no idea which question you mean, so I will just answer all questions 
that you asked again.

>Does the WCA* today still allow a sponsor to force additional
>restrictions on the allowable puzzles?
I don&#x27;t like the choice of words (allow/force), but technically the answer 
is: yes for WC 2007, and no for any other competition and any other 
organisation team than the organisation team of WC 2007.
Additionally:
- WCA will not enforce the restrictions though, the organisation team may do 
that
- WCA is talking and has been talking with organisation team to allow all 
puzzle brands
- the current state is that because WC 2007 is a special competition (25th 
anniversary, in home country of the cube, with the inventor involved), there 
is a special wish to only use Rubik&#x27;s brands
- WCA already has an informal reaction from organisation team that this is 
the last competition where the allowed brands are limited

I still think the answer is obvious. It was already mentioned in the message 
by Pedro that you actually reacted to!
You could also just have gone to the WC 2007 site and find the answer within 
one minute.

>Would, for example, the WCA allow Seven Towns as a sponsor to require
>competitors to use their brand over East Sheen?
Same answer.

> What if Seven Towns claimed East Sheen as an illegal copy?
> Would the WCA agree to ban it from a sponsored competition, or not?
> Or will the WCA make up its own mind about what
> puzzles are allowed and firmly stick to it?
WCA does not have an active role in finding illegal puzzles (illegal copies, 
trademark violation et cetera). Still if some person or organisation points 
out with proof that a specific puzzle is illegal, then WCA will not allow 
that specific puzzle type in WCA competitions anymore. (In that case we have 
to change the WCA regulations.)

More questions?

In that case you could just have said that instead of offending me. To me it 
was like shooting the messenger instead of helping us create a free world. 
You are smart enough to understand that I am on the cubers side.

Have fun,

Ron

          <div class="email-content">I get from this that we need seven towns for the tournament else it
would be not so big. Also I get from this that WCA is trying to do the
cubers whishers and talk about the brand issue to seven towns, I realy
appreciate this :)

Does the &quot;nine&quot; imply the trademark only applies to the 3x3, but not 
to 2x2, 4x4 and 5x5?

It is my belief that the &quot;clone&quot; DIY kits that are currently 
available would be accepted, since they are impossible to distinguish 
from a genuine Rubik&#x27;s brand puzzle (of which there have been several 
makes over the years).  The pieces and movement are basically the

I still hope it will be a brand neutral competition, but even if not, you will see me there.

I can always compete in the events of which I have a Rubik brand.

I think it&#x27;s incredibly stupid to not allow any other brand then Rubik.



Also i heard every rubik cube has to have a sticker with the logo.

I allready restickered my 3x3x3 anniversary &quot;RUBIK&quot; cube.



I can&#x27;t compete with this one??



If this all stays that way I have to reconsider my participation.

          <div class="email-content">Richard,

It&#x27;s not that simple.  You can&#x27;t go through life burning bridges just
because you want something.  You need to understand this right away, or it
will impact your life beyond the scope of cubing.

I will talk to SevenTowns.  I do not believe that allowing different types
of cubes hurts their publicity or their merchandising whatsoever.  People
see a cube, they don&#x27;t think, &quot;That&#x27;s a Magic Square Puzzle!&quot;  They think,
&quot;That&#x27;s a Rubik&#x27;s Cube.&quot;  And they will buy a Rubik&#x27;s Cube, and not an
imitation.

<br>
&gt; &gt;Can you please reply to the question at the head of this thread<br>
&gt; I have no idea which question you mean<br>
<br>
Ok, what is meant is the question at the head (&quot;first message&quot;) of this<br>
thread (&quot;Allowed / Blocked cubes at WC2007&quot;).<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt;Does the WCA* today still allow a sponsor to force additional<br>
&gt; &gt;restrictions on the allowable puzzles?<br>
&gt; I don&#x27;t like the choice of words (allow/force).<br>
<br>
I can&#x27;t help this, because I always choose my words to say precisely<br>
what I mean.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; - the current state is that because WC 2007 is a special competition (25th <br>
&gt; anniversary, in home country of the cube, with the inventor involved), there <br>
&gt; is a special wish to only use Rubik&#x27;s brands<br>
<br>
Thank you! This appears to be the answer to my question:<br>
<br>
http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/34610<br>
<br>
This is the question I have been complaining has been left unanswered<br>
for several weeks, and so I am glad to have finally received an answer<br>
to it (but as with Richard&#x27;s point, this is one example of a question<br>
that was initially ignored by the WCA)<br>
<br>
Now, it is clear to me that the question has been answered, but to<br>
anyone who scans the archives and finds my question in the message<br>
above, the problem for them is that they will not realise it has been<br>
answered, because you answered it in a different place to where it was<br>
asked (that was my earlier point). It is difficult when the WCA does not<br>
give answers directly to the questions where they were asked.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; - WCA already has an informal reaction from organisation team that this is <br>
&gt; the last competition where the allowed brands are limited<br>
<br>
This is also new information that I could not find in any earlier<br>
official WCA statement.<br>
<br>
Thank you, again. New information a&#x27;coming.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; I still think the answer is obvious. It was already mentioned in the message <br>
&gt; by Pedro that you actually reacted to!<br>
<br>
I disagree. I read Pedro&#x27;s message carefully of course, and that is why<br>
I replied to it. He said that in the past, sponsors had forced<br>
additional restrictions on the allowed cubes. My question was whether<br>
the WCA still allowed sponsors to do this &quot;today&quot;.<br>
<br>
I also stated that I read the WCA regulations, but found the WCA<br>
regulations to be unclear and that, while the answer might indeed be in<br>
it, it was simply not clear to me. Therefore, I asked to hear the WCA&#x27;s<br>
clarification on this issue.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; You could also just have gone to the WC 2007 site and find the answer<br>
&gt; within one minute.<br>
<br>
I disagree. I went there and still did not find the answer to whether<br>
the WCA regulations allow this. The concern that I was trying to raise<br>
was that I had already found a number of ambiguities in the WCA<br>
regulations. On this particular issue, the document may have had the<br>
answer somewhere, but it was not clear to me. My question was not<br>
whether the WC2007 forces competitors to use Rubik-only brands, my<br>
question was whether this is legal under the WCA regulations. That is, I<br>
saw it as possible that in addition to the existing mistakes and<br>
inconsistencies in the regulations document that I had found so far,<br>
that there might also be another one concerning this issue.<br>
<br>
It is impossible to find the answer to a question about the regulations<br>
on a page about the WC2007.<br>
<br>
This question has now been answered and I am not asking for further<br>
clarification. I am just commenting on the way in which the WCA<br>
initially conducted themselves in making me feel like my question was<br>
stupid, when in fact my question(s) are usually motivated by non-trivial<br>
underlying issues. (Read my point at the bottom, as it is related)<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; More questions?<br>
<br>
Thank you for finally answering the &quot;What is the situation&quot; question.<br>
The only question that remains is the one at the head of this thread.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; It is not only we who should ask questions in a respectful way, but also<br>
&gt; &gt; the WCA who should answer them in a respectful way. I did not find it<br>
&gt; &gt; very professional for the WCA to reply to my question with &quot;the answer<br>
&gt; &gt; is obvious&quot; and then to not give me the answer, when I had made it clear<br>
&gt; &gt; from the outset that I did not find the WCA regulations to be a clear<br>
&gt; &gt; document, and that even if the answer to my question were in it, I was<br>
&gt; &gt; simply unable to find it at the time.<br>
&gt; In that case you could just have said that<br>
<br>
I did.<br>
<br>
&gt; instead of offending me.<br>
<br>
If you are offended, it is not because I tried to offend you. I actually<br>
had what I thought was a valid question.<br>
<br>
** Being in the position of representing the WCA, an organisation that<br>
makes decisions that affect a large number of people including not only<br>
competitors from this community but also manufacturers of competiting<br>
brands of cube in the free marketplace, I think that you, as a WCA<br>
official, need to accept that people will question the decisions of the<br>
WCA every now and then, especially when these decisions may affect<br>
competitors and/or manufacturers in a negative way. Of course, the very<br>
nature of these questions mean that they may naturally seem offensive to<br>
you, but as a professional, you should attempt to address these &quot;valid&quot;<br>
concerns nonetheless.<br>
<br>
I used words allow/force which I believe to be the perfect choice of<br>
words. I have tried to express the view that I believe it is wrong for<br>
the WCA to allow sponsors to force competitors to use their brand,<br>
especially in a &quot;world championships&quot;. In my view, it would be difficult<br>
to express my question without being negative, because that is part of<br>
the nature of this particular question. And are you going to tell me<br>
that certain questions cannot be asked of the WCA because you find them<br>
offensive?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; To me it was like shooting the messenger instead of helping us create<br>
&gt; a free world.  You are smart enough to understand that I am on the<br>
&gt; cubers side.<br>
<br>
This relates to the reference a few paragraphs up. I think you are also<br>
smart enough to know that I try to ask genuine questions, and usually<br>
the questions revolve around some underlying non-trivial issue which in<br>
my mind does not have an obvious answer.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am sorry if you feel offended, but that is the nature of the question.<br>
I wanted to know if the WCA allows what I consider to be a monopolistic<br>
act. It is not expected for the WCA to become emotional due to such a<br>
question, but rather to be level-headed and provide insightful and<br>
immediate answers to shed some light on the WCA&#x27;s current thinking.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
One more question: As mentioned, I now have answers to all of my<br>
questions except for the one at the head of this thread. I am therefore<br>
aware (as per this latest email of yours) that WC2007 will probably be<br>
the last competition in which competitors will be &quot;forced&quot; to use Rubik<br>
brands. But I would like to know what sort of guarantees will be put<br>
into place to ensure that this sort of thing cannot happen again? For<br>
example, do we just have express intention to look out for this sort of<br>
thing, or will you actually put it into the regulations document so that<br>
this thing actually &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; happen again? If you are not willing to put<br>
this into the regulations, then what about at least a rule which says<br>
that a competition cannot be called a &quot;world championships&quot; if the<br>
sponsors require competitors to use their brand of cube?<br>

Given that the average competitor has to pay around $500-$1000 just  
in travel and hotels, it seems reasonable if the competition itself  
would cost $100 or $200.

  I have no idea if that would be enough to make us sponsor independent.

There surely is a difference between someone, say from Japan, and someone
from Angola or Morocco for example.

I think there are 2 visions :
1: large competition where people have lots of fun
2: &quot;elite&quot; competition (not only fast cubers, but restricted to rich &amp; fast
cubers ==> non cubing criteria)

Personally I prefer #1.

<br>
German Open 2007 fun fact:<br>
Clément Gallet solved his 2nd cube blindfolded one-handed. That is why <br>
his result was 8 minutes instead of his usual 2-3 minutes.<br>
<br>
I hope everyone had a great time in Germany. I was very happy about the <br>
atmosphere and the willingness of everyone to help with judging and <br>
scramble.<br>
We have a great group of people.<br>
<br>
Have fun,<br>

Did you come for Koninginnedag? I heard that it is a sort of pilgrimage.

I was travelling back to the UK yesterday, via HOlland, and it was
amazing to see everybody in orange with orange crowns and paintewd
faces, having a great time. 

I can&#x27;t imagine anyone in UK wanting to do that on the Queen Elizabeth
II (or late Queen Mother&#x27;s) birthday!

          <div class="email-content">I&#x27;m sure a lot of people can&#x27;t afford to travel to a World  
Championship, unless it happens to be held close to their home. Even  
if the competition itself is free of cost. That&#x27;s just the nature of  
world championships, due to the size of the world.

But among those who can afford to travel the globe, adding 10-20% to  
the total cost to pay for the actual competition should not keep away  
many more people. Perhaps even fewer that would be kept away by not  
being allowed to use their favorite cube brand.

Someone has to pay for the competition, and whoever that is will be  
the one deciding how the competition is held. It&#x27;s nice to have other  
people pay your bills, but then they get to decide  things.

I realize it&#x27;s much too late to do this for WC2007. Just speculating.

You could post a direct reply to your own question, providing the 
answer (or/with a link to it). And if this were a forum (like the WCA 
forum) you could even edit your initial post and add the answer to it.

Does that mean it&#x27;s considered somewhat disrespectful to use puzzles 
made by someone else? I&#x27;m curious whether Mr Rubik has actually been 
asked about this. I think if I were him, I wouldn&#x27;t mind.

Maybe I should also forbid people to use improved versions of my 
blindcubing method, that&#x27;d be similar. Though, I&#x27;m of course happy if 
people find improvements and use them. That&#x27;s anything but 
disrespectful.

Cheers!
Stefan

          <div class="email-content">Hi :)

If wca official view is that it&#x27;s  brand neutral, then i can only 
conclude that there must be something wrong. If wca is truly brand 
neutral then we only allow brand neautral competitions :-) But ok, 
maybe it&#x27;s storm in glass of water if 7towns has really promised to 
lift their ban from future sponsored competitions. I think we should 
never allow non-brand-neutral competitions ever again. The &quot;non-
branded&quot; puzzles are a minority anyway. And competition is good also 
amongst puzzle manufacturers. If people get sponsors i think it&#x27;s ok 
personally. As long as people can use any brand they want. As long as 
it behaves like the puzzle should. This should include using 
prototypes imho, not being restricted to &quot;widely available&quot; puzzles. 
Top athletes don&#x27;t get their shoes or shirts off the local shops&#x27; 
shelves. If people start using exclusive customised puzzles it&#x27;s ok 
with me. The benefit is quite small anyway. But we keep our freedom 
of choice :-)

In &quot;flip twist.doc&quot; you make it look like you show &quot;the&quot; definition

Ok ok.  The only bridges burned by my post have had a river of 
gasoline running underneath them for some time anyway...  You have 
had a tendency in the past of trivializing someone&#x27;s concerns and 
reacting in a hostile way.  You and Ron personalize things too much, 
especially when you consider the positions that both of you are in.

Yes, my selfish desire to stand up for better conditions for 
competitiors.

I have to say that point is arbitrary.  My method of expression on 
this group gives no more insight than how I express myself on this 
group.  I find it difficult to believe you could analyze my 
character based on that alone.  It wouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to find 
posts you have made out of frustration; at least mine are based on 
legitimate concerns.

Excellent point.  This means there is no need to restrict based on 
brand then? :)

<br>
At the recent German Open 2007, we had a LOT of fun. I team solved a<br>
lot with Joel, and also a bit with Stefan Pochmann, and it really is a<br>
funny event.<br>
<br>
Joel and I practised a bit, and developed some strategies, and we<br>
posted the unofficial world record (we are the first team to go under<br>
40 seconds) - http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_fun_teamsolve.html<br>
<br>
So get practising, I&#x27;d like to see some more people trying this out at<br>
competitions/cube meetings! Maybe it would even be a nice &quot;media<br>

Thanks a lot! Man, I&#x27;ve watched the you-know-which part of the 
megaminx race like 10 times now, it&#x27;s just so awesome. Great you got 
that on video. Will watch the other videos later today, especially 
Matyas&#x27; 0.91 magic solve in veeery slooow moootioooon.

into place, I suggest that it be inversely proportional to the

imagine it would defray the cost of running a competition make us 
independent.

The more a compeitor has paid to travel, the less inclined I would be 
in asking them for an extra entry fee... it seems heartless. This fee 
could be an annual membership fee of some sort...

It&#x27;s easy for me to say becasue I&#x27;m becoming more willing to spend on 
traveling. Just to give you an idea of how much I&#x27;m willing to spend 
on this stuff.... I&#x27;m seriously considering attending CalTech Spring

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

I just received the good news that there will not be a limitation of 
using only Rubik&#x27;s brands during WC 2007!!!!!

For 3x3 cube there is still the limitation of legal copies though.

I have no idea which copies are illegal and how to detect them.
I think that if a cube looks like a regular Rubik&#x27;s cube, then there 
is no way we can stop someone from using it.
Any thoughts?

Will update the WC 2007 website accordingly soon.

Have fun,

Ron

me and Joel Van Noort did one at the german open.
1.30 minutes, not too bad for the first time, wasn&#x27;t it Joel?

Fun to do while training with another cuber.

Are you sure about that? We checked it (as you can see on the video) and 
both judge and me thought it was exactly on the border.

Have fun,

          <div class="email-content">You can also try &quot;multiple team solve&quot;.
So basically if you have 4 people, there are 4 different cubes who are being
solved using the same technique (each person does only one move and then
passes the cube to the next person).

This is also very funny (and of course, the more persons the better :D)

seems that we are in this situation:
http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/images/notsolved4.jpg
Thus a +2 penalty.

Maybe the angle of the camera view is not good enough for us to
correctly estimate the situation as well. Otherwise, can somebody
please explain to me how penalty applies to the 4x4?

Also, I have watched Edouard&#x27;s 12.73 seconds solve and the inspection
time seems to be over 15 seconds + 1 second. I don&#x27;t know if that
would have changed anything (and I personally don&#x27;t mind) but since
we&#x27;re pointing at possible judges&#x27; errors (Sorry for that). Maybe the
new inspection procedure for 2008 will be better and easier (as
discussed here http://tinyurl.com/2oz9kj ).

          <div class="email-content">I am a relatively new cuber, only beginning in February of this year, <br>
and my average solve time on the 3x3x3 is 1 minute 16 seconds. I <br>
believe that the part of the solving that slows me down is solving the <br>
middle layer. The sequence of moves I use for the middle layer, with <br>
the edge piece I want to move on the bottom of the back side, is <br>
FDF&#x27;D&#x27;R&#x27;D&#x27;. With no middle layer edge pieces correctly orientated or <br>
located, it takes me approximately 30 seconds to solve the middle <br>
layer. A turtle&#x27;s pace no doubt, but I&#x27;m just glad I can solve it; my <br>
4x4x4 Revenge is still unsolved following the two weeks after I <br>
purchased it. If anyone has a better sequence or method of solving the <br>
middle layer, please relay the info. also, any help with the Revenge <br>
would be greatly appreciated. I can&#x27;t get past solving the first side.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey guys,

I&#x27;m on osx and I just plugged the stackmat into the line-in port
(3.5mm stereo), turned
the stackmat on, and launched calcube... but it didn&#x27;t detect the stackmat.
It said &quot;Timer is OFF&quot;.
My audio input is correctly selected as the mixer in the config.
So I played around with the stackmat values...
I only got it to detect it when I set the stackmat value to around 1-7
(default is 50, and they say the normal range is from 29-70).  This is
the only range I&#x27;ve found where it detects my stackmat, but no matter
what calcube goes berserk (whether the 15.165.165 checkbox is checked
or not).  The closer to 1, the more berserk, the farther, it seems to
detect my stackmat less -- at around 6-7 it only detects when I put my
hands on the pads, but not in between... no timing, etc... so when I
put my hands on the pads here it&#x27;ll say &quot;timer is ON&quot; and when I take
them off it&#x27;ll say &quot;timer is OFF&quot; again.
Let me know if something is unclear or you need more information.
Have you guys experienced this?  Have a solution?

Alex

Thanks, Bob, it was a great competition.

One minor correction: My BLD solve was 4:12.00, not 3:12.00.  Sure, I&#x27;d 
have liked a 3:12, but yeah.

If the corner is too far away so that the line passes the other (clear isn&#x27;t

          <div class="email-content">I think this is quite interesting. You can see Ron and Rama looking from the side of the 
cube, but we (or the camera) are looking at it from the back. I&#x27;m pretty sure Ron would 
have called a +2 on himself if it was over the edge. But if I watch the video it looks almost 
dead certain it was misaligned too far, although it&#x27;s hard to tell because we don&#x27;t see the 
borders.

Since the pieces of the Rubik&#x27;s 4x4x4 are a bit loose compared to other puzzles, it could 
be possible that the corner is too far one side but not on another side. On my 4x4x4 I was 
able to set up a position like this.

Should the rules be adjusted for this case?

Kind regards,
Lars

Ultrafast! About 14 seconds, and at least in the beginning he was 
even talking and not looking at the cube for a moment.

          <div class="email-content">Oh my.  On an amazing solve, it takes me that long to memorize.

Given that they show the entire cube, it wouldn&#x27;t be that hard to see 
exactly how easy the cases are.
And the first solve would easily have been 1:34 or so.  An A and an H 
away from solved (at least that&#x27;s what it looked like to me).

And nice blindfold.

(but since it is 80 seconds this explaination does not make sense :-( )

On the contrary, it is possible that he suffered form pressure on his first
solve and that he did much better on the 2nd solve when he felt more
comfortable.

Anyway, congratulations :-)
It is very impressive.

Quite a milestone. First sub-10 in competition!! I bet we will see

Normally, Only 9.86 is the WR since Spanish Open is in an earlier time zone.
However, you should compare the time schedules. Maybe there is still a

Anyway, congratulations too !

And does nobody else have problems watching it? For me, both Windows

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,

I must say I still find it hard to judge from these images. The video 
camera does not have a straight angle with the cube (you see parts of 
the right side of the cube).
On the front side it looks like the corner has indeed passed the 
border of the next piece. Even by a clear margin.
On the right side though it looks like it is still slightly clean.

Although the time difference is not big (average would have been 0.03 
worse) I do feel bad about this case. :-(
At the time it was my true opinion that the corner did not pass the 
line. I am very strict, also to myself.

We may need an RFC for the next version of the WCA regulations for 
such cases. I already heard someone say that a half (quarter) turn 
would be easier to judge.

Have fun,

Ron

It&#x27;s true... the WR was 16.53 after Worlds 03, and now a best single<br>
solve like that won&#x27;t even get you in the top 100!<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think that whether Dan set his time first doesn&#x27;t matter<br>
much to you or me, but it would make a very big difference to Dan...<br>

Whahahah Gilles!!! That&#x27;s a hilarious reply :).

The same thing happened to Tyson Mao in BATG.. people thought he 
memorised and solving in 15 seconds or something.

Guys, our BLD times are just not good enough for TV to be show 
uncut... Well, only Chen Danyang&#x27;s solves are fast enough, I 
guess :).

          <div class="email-content">Hi again guys,

OK, I took my competition 4x4, I positioned it at the angle of the 
camera and tried to reconstruct exactly the same misalignment as the 
one on the video.
There are at least 3 places where you could look for misalignment, 
and only 1 is the correct one:
1) left side of UFR corner &lt;==> left side of ufr center (correct)
2) right side of UFR corner &lt;==> right side of ufr center (incorrect)
3) right side of UFl edge &lt;==> right side of uFL edge (incorrect)

>From the reconstructed misalignment on my cube the results were:
1) two mm past the border (with the loose corner I could bring it 
down to one mm)
2) still on good side of the border
3) exactly on the border

So it looks like the judge&#x27;s call (and mine of course) was incorrect. 
It should have been a penalty.

Given the fact that I thought it was exactly on the border, I think I 
must have mistakingly looked at border 3.
My mistake, sorry.

FYI, I also think the 5x5 world record single had a misalignment that 
should have had a penalty.

We will not change the results, but I think we do need actions to 
make sure this does not happen anymore. The best is to have very easy 
regulations. The second best is to better train the judges.

Have fun,

Ron

Hi Ron,<br>
<br>
Yes, I totally agree with you. The funny thing was, I was witnessing <br>
it, and assumed it was going to be a penalty... The judge had doubts, <br>
asked the main judge, who gave his opinion about it without even <br>

the audience got the time to even come close to the cube and judge for <br>
themselves; the judge quickly picked up the cube, and the incident was <br>
over. This last remark about the audience not being able to see for <br>
themselves might seem irrelevant to some, but I think it&#x27;s quite <br>
important, especially when it&#x27;s about a world record.<br>

The video was probably shot awhile ago, or the producers did not get  
the information about the new world record.

Dan to have held the world record, even for a second.  It is a shame, <br>
however, that by any means, whatever title is conveyed, the fact of the <br>
matter remains that there was a 9.86 second solve officially done <br>
before the 10.06.<br>

The video of Dan thinking he got a world record is absolutely hilarious <br>
though.  We&#x27;ll try to make it available once we get it.  There was <br>
definitely a lot of confusion, and when I was called over by Chris <br>

So show up, solve some Rubik&#x27;s Cubes, and get some other guy to buy you <br>
a plane ticket to Budapest.<br>
<br>
We have expanded the list of events that will be available.  I am <br>
finalizing the schedule of the competition, but expect qualifying <br>

With team solving, you solve a cube with 2 persons. This means one 
team member can make only 1 move at a time. For an example:

          <div class="email-content">Hi Frédérick,

Based on that 3rd image, I think it is still debatable whether it is 
solved or a 2 seconds penalty. I just have to trust the judge there, 
and for me there is no way to see for myself, allthough the 3rd 
picture there provides some clues. 

I tried to reconstruct the situation, and found out that it matters 
from what distance the picture was taken. I set up a cube in such a 
state where the lines exactly form one line, and took a picture from 
a large distance. I zoomed in on both pictures, and my conclusion is 
that my suspicion is at least justified. This conclusion is partly 
based on how far the LFd piece is sticking out of the cube. I know 
this is NOT the piece to look at for judging, but when 
reconstructing the cube, I find it hard to make a picture from the 
same angle where it looks like the LFd piece comes out that far 
while the puzzle is in fact still officialy in solved state.

You see, trusting judges is not an automatical thing for me, as I 
see more things happening during official competitions, like: Cube 
touched with other hand during OH solve to prevent it from falling, 
no disqualification. No 2 second penalty given. Judge helping after 
POP (famous example). 

My intention was not to complain about this particular incident, but 
more about the procedures in general.

I did not offend you in anyway, so I don&#x27;t see why I should 
apologize.

In fact the wca site is quite often the first site to post results,

are you annoyed that Europe got the first sub-10 official solve or 
what? Does it matter who did it first? The important things should be 
that it was an amazing achievement and that hopefully it will inspire 
others for even better times in the future, wherever it will be ;-)

I was trying to point out that with good judges things can still go wrong or 
be debatable.
I give you my apologies for bringing this discussion up.

Still in this case I think there should have been a penalty.
Not with the outer layer, there I think it is exactly on the border, but 
with the middle layer where I think it is past the border.

Anyway, we will not change the results.

Have fun,

Ron

Hi Joel,

you were here to judge, on my left:
http://frederickbadie.free.fr/im1.bmp

not exactly here :
http://frederickbadie.free.fr/im3.bmp

this angle on the video is better to judge, but not perfect (on the
left of cube axis too).
The judge shows the line with his pencil and asked the main judge to
confirm his own opinion.
No problem for this case :

I guess I deserve your apologies.
(Ron, feel free to do the same)

Have fun,

          <div class="email-content">Annoyed?  Why would I be annoyed?  It is a wonderful accomplishment.

I was saying this from a standpoint of utility for Dan and Jaquinot.  
If Dan gets the world record a microsecond before Jacquinot, what 
happens?

Dan is able to call himself a former world record holder, and Jaquinot 
becomes the current world record holder.  Let&#x27;s say happiness there is 
10 + 50 = 60.

If Jaquinot gets the world record first, his happiness is the same.  He 
doesn&#x27;t care of Dan did a 10.08 solve, he&#x27;s still happy that he is a 
current world record holder.  Meanwhile, Dan is disappointed, and looks 
like a sad panda.  Happiness there is probably -10 + 50 = 40.

So please explain why I would feel annoyed.

          <div class="email-content">We cannot change the results.  We have said all along that video 
evidence will not be accepted.  In the United States, maybe 50 years 
ago, an umpire made a bad call in the world series.  Someone had a 
picture of the person touching first base with the ball still in the 
air, and the umpire called him out, so they blew up the picture and it 
ended up on the front page.

We will still continue to rely on humans to make these calls.  I really 
do think it&#x27;ll make things easier.

over.  I&#x27;m not very fond of this procedure, and I<br>
wonder if it is against the rules.  On a loose cube<br>

&quot;A6g) The judge must inspect the puzzle without manipulating it and
must determine whether the puzzle has been completely solved.
A6h) In case of a dispute the puzzle must not be manipulated until the
dispute has been settled, involving the main judge if needed. Penalty:
disqualification of the solve (courtesy of judge).&quot;

We&#x27;ll have to change something that is not clear: &quot;manipulating&quot;. In
A6g) and A6h), it means &quot;touching&quot;. In A3c1), it means &quot;making moves&quot;.

Another problem: For some puzzles (not cubes), touching them may be
necessary.

I could hide two swapped edges of my 5x5 *cube* by putting it right 
in front of the timer.

Throughout the episode Sexual Harassment Panda regularly says &quot;That
makes me a sad panda&quot;, and sometimes &quot;That makes me a *very* sad panda&quot;.
It&#x27;s a funny episode. I like South Park.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Frederick,

My conclusion is not based on what I saw when I was witnessing the 
solve. During that, I only was suspicious, and I was a little 
surprised about the procedure, how the important decision was taken 
that quickly. Based on the images though, my suspicion is at least 
justified. 

I was not in front of it, that is right, and the same thing goes for 
the camera. Here is another image from the same video:

http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~jnoort/img/5x5x5.jpg

As you can see, the blue lines exactly seem to match the black ones. 
Anyone can try to reconstruct this with his own 5x5, to see that 
this is only possible when you look at the cube from an angle; and 
indeed, on the picture we also see part of the green face. Also, the 
blue line at the red cross exactly matches the black line. If I 
reconstruct this on my 5x5, at that place, the second layer from the 
bottom is &#x27;sticking out&#x27;. (If this is not the case on your 5x5, you 
have a very special 5x5 :)). If I now look at the cube from a 
straight angke, so that I can&#x27;t see the green or blue face, and look 
at the place of the red cross again, I can see that it is past the 
border slightly.

If I am wrong, just tell me where I am wrong in this.

- Joël.

          <div class="email-content">Hi all,

There is only one realy way to settle disputes like this, and that is
to use the judgement set down in the ARSE (Association of Rubik
Speedsolving Experts) regulations.

Article 5 - Deciding if a penalty is needed.
Step 1 - Carefully set down the puzzle so that the misaligned layers
are perpendicular to the playing surface.

Step 2 - The judge, with his/her dominant hand, or if ambidextrous,
either hand, should then slam down on the puzzle to align the layers,
being careful not to hurt themselves or any nearby
competitors/judges/audience members.

Step 3 - If the puzzle is solved, it is fine. If it is not solved,
then a penalty must be applied based on the procedure for giving
penalties set out in article 6.

By these regulations, Fredericks case is most definitely fine. Ron&#x27;s
case is a bit more tricky to judge.

Dan ;)

Get over it! No penalty was given :-) So all this talk about &quot;should 
have been&quot; is hypothetical. There&#x27;s no consequences involved here :-)
With the possible exception that the rules may be phrased more 
precisely. There&#x27;s always borderline cases. That&#x27;s why there is a 
judge at the table and a main judge. Decisions cannot be changed on 
hindsight, be it because of photo/video evidence or whatever ;-)

          <div class="email-content">as much as i hate to say it, i agree with per.  i think its big of ron to go to all the effort and keeping a non-ego filled head to find out if his was a penalty or not.  regarding the 5x5, from the picture i see that it is definitely questionable, its a bad angle to tell if its straight down on the left, and based on the line over on the right side, it looks like its a bit past the line, which would mean the one on the left side is too.  its not a big deal since you&#x27;re not loosing your precious single time record, so turn the ego down a bit.  i think its a good chance to learn about the downfalls of our current system, and we could learn from it to improve future competitions.

 Get over it! No penalty was given :-) So all this talk about &quot;should 
 have been&quot; is hypothetical. There&#x27;s no consequences involved here :-)
 With the possible exception that the rules may be phrased more 
 precisely. There&#x27;s always borderline cases. That&#x27;s why there is a 
 judge at the table and a main judge. Decisions cannot be changed on 
 hindsight, be it because of photo/video evidence or whatever ;-)

If you post something like this, can you please tell the cube 
orientation before scrambling?

Unless defined, just use the standard U=White, F=Green. There&#x27;s a
really straigthforward 2x2x3-block (or double X-cross) in 8 moves.

Or for a beginner feet-solver, use as few algorithms as possible. It 
is quite different to execute them with two hands or with two feet.

And another tip: do not use a corners&#x27; first method (too many slice 
moves...)

Practice and have fun!

<br>
Looks like I&#x27;ve used a slightly non-equivalent algorithm. Don&#x27;t know <br>
about the other guys (Herbert and Lucas). Jaap&#x27;s scrambler doesn&#x27;t <br>
allow an R turn followed by an L turn, only L followed by R (and <br>
similar for the other axes). The alg I used allows both. So we&#x27;re <br>
talking about different sets of scrambles.<br>

Have the server start JNetCube in server mode and pick a port. Any  <br>
port will work, but you can use port 1234 for this demonstration.  <br>
After the server has started, then the client will start his timer in  <br>
client mode and enter in the information for the server. The client  <br>
will type in the IP address of the server (which the server can find  <br>
by visiting whatismyip.com ) and port 1234 (or whatever port you  <br>
started the server on).<br>
<br>
Then, the client connects to the server and you two will be connected.<br>
<br>
If that isn&#x27;t working for you, then odds are the server is behind a  <br>
router and/or firewall and you must connect to the router and  <br>
configure &quot;port forwarding&quot; and must forward port 1234 (or whatever  <br>
port you want) to the server computer&#x27;s local ip address. For more  <br>
information on port forwarding with you particular router, see your  <br>
router manual and it will be in there.<br>

Okay, this is obviously an area where I need to learn more.  I sat and 
played with it for a while, and don&#x27;t see anything &quot;really 
straightforward.&quot;  So please, educate me!

The best I could come up with was an 11-move double X-cross (but 
diagonal pairs, not a 2x2x3 block).

          <div class="email-content">yeah i&#x27;d be pretty close to the top of list actually.  however i think this time it was directly more towards tyson personally as opposed to america, which still sucks, if people have petty personal differences with someone, email them privately about it.  some people make themselves a target with whining, but in this case i don&#x27;t really see why people would want to get so uptight.  thibaut had the wr before dan, it would have been nice for dan to be able to have the wr for a bit, even if i was just a couple minutes, anyone that can say they wouldn&#x27;t feel that way for themselves also, is full of crap, and i don&#x27;t see why pointing that out is such a big deal.

I started like this:

Continue with the pair that has both pieces in the U layer, and the 
last pair is a 4 move insertion. (Unless you use a very weird alg

Nobody is arguing whether it should have a former world record! As Ron<br>
stated the 9.86 seconds solve occured before the 10.08 seconds one.<br>
<br>
Tyson is just saying that it would have made Dan happier if his solve<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Thom,

I am sorry, but it has been pointed out to me that my message was perhaps a
bit unclear.  Leyan sent me a message this morning telling me that &quot;world
records should not be given out based on happiness.&quot;  To this I completely
agree.  As stated by other members of the group, the intent of my message
was that it would have been nice if Dan had done the 10.08 solve first.
Everything would be the same, but Dan would walk away with something nice.

However, the fact of the matter is that Dan did NOT solve the 10.08 first,
and he does not get a world record.  I agree that Dan should not get a world
record, and Dan knows this as well.  It doesn&#x27;t matter who awards the world
record, it is truth of the matter that at the time of the 10.08 second
solve, there was a 9.86 second official solves on the books.

The internet can easily misinterpret what we say.  So don&#x27;t worry about
anything, and let&#x27;s move on, and I&#x27;ll be sure to make my writing a bit more
clear in the future.

-Tyson

I believe they sell both of those, but shipping costs may be a bit nasty.

4+4 moves. It&#x27;s just a 2x2x3-block to me but accidentally the &quot;4th
cross edge&quot; is solved, too.

there will be 3 different competitions that will take place on the same <br>
day.<br>
<br>
Besides the fact that it is great, it also raises issues like the one <br>
we have seen with the Spanish Open and the Berkeley competition.<br>
<br>
What happens if 1 record is broken several times and in different <br>
competitions ?<br>
<br>
Personally I think that publishing the time schedules in the GMT time <br>
could be a solution. If 1 record is broken twice, the one who did it <br>
before on the basis of the time schedule gets the record.<br>
It if it as at the same exact hour, then the fastest gets it.<br>
<br>
What do you think ?<br>

side you are :p)<br>

          <div class="email-content">There is nothing in the WCA regulations that states this would be
against them.

The only rules I found is the following:
&quot;9i2) Regional records are recognised at the end of a round. If a
record is broken twice or more in a round, only the latter is recognised.&quot;

So the main judge should annotate the time at the end of each round to
determine the WR history.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Patrick,


I guess that the company is based in China since their postal service is
something like Chinapost.

My friend and I did an order of $135.00 including $25.00 of Airmail shipping
4-10 days (Parcel Post) to Brazil.

Basically I bought 1 Eastsheen 2x2x2, two DIY 3x3x3, 1 Eastsheen 4x4x4 and 1
Eastsheen 5x5x5. And some those others strange cubes including one 2x2x2
penguin like! :)

This is my first order with them. To check the quality of their products
since I would like to sell it here because there are no good sellers in
Brazil for these &quot;toys&quot;.

I bought last Friday and Yesterday (Monday) they sent me an email telling
that the order was shipped.

Now is just wait and see the results! :)


Cheers,
Guilherme

As Sven Gowal pointed out, one of the WCA regulations reads:
&quot;9i2) Regional records are recognised at the end of a round. If a
record is broken twice or more in a round, only the latter is recognised.&quot;

I believe that the WR counts as a &#x27;regional record&#x27; (since the world
is, after all, a region), so if two people break the WR during the
same event, and the second person was faster than the first, by WCA
regulations only the second person is recognized to have a WR. What I
suggest, that both people should be counted as having had the WR at
some point, goes against this regulation.

It&#x27;s nothing serious - I&#x27;m just pointing out that under current WCA
regulations my idea isn&#x27;t feasable.

          <div class="email-content">Thanks for clearing up that rule.  I didn&#x27;t remember it.  It does say
at the end of the round though.  I think that means that if someone
were to break the record in the first round of a competition and then
someone else were to get a faster time in the second round, they would
both be recognized.

However, I&#x27;m pretty sure this rule applies to the same competition.  I
believe the reason for this is so that the time you compete in a
certain round isn&#x27;t an issue.  For example, if someone were to break a
record but another person has not had a chance to complete his or her
solves and then they complete a solve breaking the previous record but
not the new one, they do not get a WR.  If they had gone before,
however, it would have been a WR.  If this were the case, people would
all want to go first so that they have the highest chance at a record.
 Competitions would be hard to run with everyone fighting for the
chance to compete first so this issue is resolved with this rule.  I
suppose another way to resolve it would be to give both competitors
the record but then you could potentially have somebody who never beat
the record at the time of the solve but is still recognized as a
former record holder (like in my situation if I were given it).

Anyways, the main thing I wanted to point out was that it says at the
end of the round and not in the whole event.  So, if I am interpreting
it correctly, the speedsolve world record can be broken 3 times in one
tournament if there are 3 rounds.  If I am mistaken then someone
please correct me.

And just for the record, I don&#x27;t believe that I deserve the WR because
I know that Thibaut completed his solves hours before mine.  Oh, and I
also wanted to say congratulations for the first sub 10 time and for
the new world record.  Sub 10 is incredible.

          <div class="email-content">Okay, I see why I didn&#x27;t spot this one-- it leads to a cross with one 
of the side colors (orange if you scrambled with yellow on top, green 
in front).  I was looking for the cross-on-bottom color only.  Still--
 a nice one for color-neutral solvers :)

I believe I could shave a few seconds if I could come up with more 
clever openings during inspection.  I can generally do an X-cross but 
it doesn&#x27;t seem to help my times, because my X-cross is just as many 
moves as doing an optimal cross-only and then the first pair.  My X-
cross method is basically to build a 2x2x2, starting with any already-
built or nearly-built pair, then slot in the other two cross edges.  
Anybody have any good suggestions or web sites for doing better X-
cross openings?

I&#x27;m a &quot;wristy&quot; cuber. I would prefer Joel&#x27;s non-mirrored version 
actually. r&#x27;s are much faster for me than l&#x27;s. I guess this is 
because my left hand is more passive than my right hand. More 
ambidextrous cubers might not really have any preference for either 
of them ;-)

It is of little matter to me. but I think if someone breaks the recordin one part of the world, and then somewhere else in the world another person breaks it, both should be recognized as having broken the record.

Congrats Thibault for being the first to break the 10 second.

Everyone!! Have fun with the cube and do the best you can.

  Thanks for clearing up that rule. I didn&#x27;t remember it. It does say
  at the end of the round though. I think that means that if someone
  were to break the record in the first round of a competition and then
  someone else were to get a faster time in the second round, they would
  both be recognized.

  However, I&#x27;m pretty sure this rule applies to the same competition. I
  believe the reason for this is so that the time you compete in a
  certain round isn&#x27;t an issue. For example, if someone were to break a
  record but another person has not had a chance to complete his or her
  solves and then they complete a solve breaking the previous record but
  not the new one, they do not get a WR. If they had gone before,
  however, it would have been a WR. If this were the case, people would
  all want to go first so that they have the highest chance at a record.
  Competitions would be hard to run with everyone fighting for the
  chance to compete first so this issue is resolved with this rule. I
  suppose another way to resolve it would be to give both competitors
  the record but then you could potentially have somebody who never beat
  the record at the time of the solve but is still recognized as a
  former record holder (like in my situation if I were given it).

  Anyways, the main thing I wanted to point out was that it says at the
  end of the round and not in the whole event. So, if I am interpreting
  it correctly, the speedsolve world record can be broken 3 times in one
  tournament if there are 3 rounds. If I am mistaken then someone
  please correct me.

  And just for the record, I don&#x27;t believe that I deserve the WR because
  I know that Thibaut completed his solves hours before mine. Oh, and I
  also wanted to say congratulations for the first sub 10 time and for
  the new world record. Sub 10 is incredible.

Of course! I don&#x27;t understand how someone could think it would not be the
case.

I have to agree that the best way to figure out the WR holder would be
to write down the exact time that he or she breaks it. 

Since I am running one of those three competitions, I will do that, as
well as any other great ideas people come up with before then.

As always, happy cubing

1. Is your Cube lubed?

3. How fast are you cubing with your method?

          <div class="email-content">My times are in the low 20s with Fridrich, but I&#x27;m switching to
block-building F2L, and my times are a bit slower with that method. I guess
there are three ways I practice:
1. Going really slowly, trying to find the most efficient way of using my
method.
2. Going at a medium speed, focusing on looking ahead and going as smoothly
as possible.
3. Going as fast as possible.

The first two ways are great for practicing the F2L, which is probably where
you&#x27;ll improve most.

          <div class="email-content">Considering they&#x27;re students in a school, and might not want to spend
lots of time memorizing speedcubing algorithms like OLL and PLL (or
maybe you want to?), I&#x27;d say start with getting your recognition time
faster, fingers moving faster (fingertricks, etc) during algorithms,
and maybe learn the intuitive F2L (which might slow you down initially
until you learn it well).

There are really 2 things that get you moving faster:
- faster eyes and fingers
- more knowledge (F2L, OLL, PLL)

Watch videos on youtube and at strangepuzzle to see how faster cubers
use their fingers to do multiple moves at once.  Learn the intuitive
F2L and maybe the PLL too (21 algorithms).


Intuitive F2L:   http://dougreed.no-ip.org/~doug/f2l/f2l.htm
F2L Algorithms:   http://www.speedcubing.com/f2l_crossbottom_print.html
Last Layer Permutations:   http://www.cubezone.be/pll.html
Guide to Fingertricks:   http://cubewhiz.com/fingertricks.html

Don&#x27;t disregard the cross though.  Work on it too.
Now, getting faster is just practice and learning more.
Keep cubing.

          <div class="email-content">First, you completely change the subject of an existing conversation
thread instead of starting your own. Second, why ask Tyson
specifically? He is not the only person capable of helping you
(certainly not the only person in this group) and he does not exist to
fulfill your every request. Third, by not asking questions about
specific problems you might be having, your message indicates that you
haven&#x27;t even tried, and that you are reluctant to put in any effort of
your own. Fourth, please refer to http://excessivepunctuation.ytmnd.com/

In conclusion, we don&#x27;t like your attitude. Change it if you want to

Even when you perform slice moves as two separate moves, it is important<br>
to realise that corners-first methods use roughly the same number of<br>
face turns as other methods.<br>
<br>
Therefore, slice moves would only be a bad thing if, for example, r&#x27;R<br>
were more difficult to perform than, say, RB. I&#x27;m not an expert with<br>
feet, but isn&#x27;t r&#x27;R at least as easy as RB?<br>

Also, my guess is that the real limiting factor for foot methods the<br>
number of cube rotations and the number of double turns.<br>

problem is and what the F2L looks like at this very moment.

I&#x27;m just kidding Shelley.  Well handled, but I was expecting a
different source. :)

I think it would not be good to use the same scrambles 8 hours later.
Lots of (possible) opportunities to cheat. Not saying people are cheating.

quite remember what happend, I was turning pretty quickly at the time.  

The first picture I took right after I set the cube down, I was afraid
it wouldn&#x27;t stay long without other pieces falling out.  After that
picture I realized the cube was surprisingly stable so I took pictures
from other angles.

I&#x27;ve just never had a corner slide into the spot of the popped out
edge as it happened.  Definitely a unique pop, easily one of the
coolest I&#x27;ve ever had.

          <div class="email-content">Too many of those recently, increased popularity sadly has its 
disadvantages, too.

Here&#x27;s what I suggest: We build a comprehensive yet concise tutorial 
of what it takes to become a good speedcuber. Not too short (should 
cover all the essentials) but also not too long (shouldn&#x27;t overwhelm 
and scare away). Should be possible for a newbie to read and 
understand in 10-15 minutes.

- Where to get good cubes.
- How to prepare them well.
- An overview of solving methods (like a general description and then 
a diagram and short description for each of the steps, but no 
algorithm sets) and links to sites showing them in more detail.
- Suggestions for how to practice (including tools like scramble 
generators and timer programs).
- Suggestions for how to get faster (finger tricks, looking ahead, 
etc).
- An overview of discussion sites and some guidelines, especially how 
to ask good questions.

Then whenever some idiot asks an idiot question like that, we could 
simply reply with a link to that tutorial.

It&#x27;s on my list of cubing projects I&#x27;d like to do, but I don&#x27;t have 
the time for it myself so here&#x27;s the suggestion, maybe others can do 
it?

Cheers!
Stefan

I guess I have some bias towards my own tutorials on www.cubewhiz.com,

I personally like http://www.speedcubing.com/ .  this site is very good
for learning some of the basic permutations/algorithms/etc.  what i
went to first from your position was learning the last layer
orientations and permutations (speedcubing.com/chris/3-
orientations.hmtl, speedingcubing.com/chris/3-permutations.html
respectively).  there are some other links/etc. on the index page that
will link you to some different ways to solving the cube.  i personally
would go to the last layer orientations and permutations first.  then
when you have those down, i suggest Freidrich&#x27;s F2L to memorize next if
you still want to get faster.

Good Luck!
email me if you have any other questions I would be glad to help!

          <div class="email-content">No offense to Jeff, but I promote learning rather than memorizing.
F2L may always be the longest step in cube solving.
It&#x27;d be good to get an intuitive insight into solving the first two layers
(solving the each corner-edge pair at once), instead of memorizing algos.
Also, there are about 57 OLL algos and 21 PLL algos.
Just so you know :)

          <div class="email-content">So far I don&#x27;t see any of these as feasible options.

The idea of always scrambling in the same orientation is actually
counter productive; Think about it...there is no need to talk about
orientation of the cube at that point, just what to do when you get it
(most people solve for white remember!)

Unique mixes isn&#x27;t going to work.  The fairness and equality issue
would go on perpetually.

Leaving the room:  I would think this would not only make the
competition less fun, but more work for the organizers.

I think the best way would be to use random orientations of the cube
before scrambling it *and* random scrambles within the round. example:

For Round 1 of 5 solves:

Person A gets scrambles this order:  2,4,3,1,5
Person B gets scrambles this order:  3,2,5,1,4

There is still room for cheating this way, but much less than before.

I think the problem in managing this issue is that there are so many
competitors.  The first person to solve in a big competition can have
5-10 minutes to reflect on the scramble and share the information with
others.  

With this in mind, perhaps it&#x27;d be best to have the fastest solvers go
first.  Obviously they would reap the greatest benefits of insider
information anyway, and they would go through their solves fast enough
I think as not to relate it to each other so quickly.  The benefit is
twofold here as well.  You get your first group of people done with a
round very quick, and then they are free to assist in that round for
judging/organizing, hence speeding up the remaining competitors.  


Just some ideas,

Richard

A fairness issue? Explain. No please don&#x27;t. I know what you mean and 
disagree.

> Also it is not really feasible to generate that many scrambles.

Generating thousands of scrambles is a piece of cake, and I can print 
100 scrambles on one sheet of paper easily. What&#x27;s the problem?

> Additionally it would be a real mess for the scramblers.

I claim the opposite. Just cross out a scramble once you&#x27;ve applied 
it. Actually prevents accidentally giving the same scramble to the 
same competitor twice (happened to me at least once, got the same 
clock scramble twice).

Cheers!

It&#x27;s happening all the time =)

The problem is that the thread of the screw is to steep. So it easily 
comes out by itself.

To dela with it you must (gently) pull the tip out of the puzzle (there 
are a number of small parts that will come loose, a spring and a small 
metal ball for example, don&#x27;t loose those parts =) Then cut open the 
centre using a thin blade. Then you apply Epoxy on the srew tip and put 
the peices back an thighten the screw. Then you can use a little Epoxy 
til glue the tip bakc on.

The Epoxy on the srew tip will make sure it won&#x27;t come of as easily as 
it would without.

(Probably unlikely, but if it does happen I would not like to be the
second person.)

Didn&#x27;t both persons have the exact same chance to get easy or hard

&gt; <br>
&gt; Didn&#x27;t both persons have the exact same chance to get easy or hard <br>

<br>
Yes, but there are only 3 solves per N competitors. As N increases, the<br>
probability that one competitor will get 3 easy scrambles and another<br>
competitor will get 3 difficult scrambles becomes very high.<br>
<br>
Let&#x27;s just look at the memorisation part, and imagine a competition<br>
where you are timed to see how fast you can memorise three random<br>
bitfields.<br>
<br>
If each competitor gets DIFFERENT random bitfields, then with a large<br>
number of competitors it becomes more likely that one competitor might<br>
get three easy cases like 1111011110, ... while another competitor might<br>
get three more difficult cases like 101001101, ... We know that the<br>
entropy of different random strings can be extremely different making<br>
one much easier to memorise than another. But if you design a<br>
competition in the way you are suggesting, then luck is playing too much<br>
a part, and a less skilled competitor may well beat a more skilled<br>
competitor, simply by being given the gift of easier cases than everyone<br>
else.<br>
<br>
This is what I like about everyone being given the same cases. Then even<br>
if the cases are easier than normal, then everyone still gets the same<br>
advantage equally(*).<br>
<br>
I actually have some data which I could look at some day, in the<br>
multi-player simulator:<br>
<br>
    http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/speed/<br>
<br>
I have recorded every scramble and every solve since the game first<br>
started up, and I would be able to run some pretty graphs on it. In this<br>
game, the two competitors who are racing are always given the same<br>
scramble. I have noticed that often two competitors who are equally<br>
matched will get around the same times as each other, and then suddenly<br>
they will BOTH get very good times on the same scramble. Then other<br>
times tey will suddenly BOTH get very bad times on the same scramble.<br>
There are exceptions, but from observations it seems that both<br>
competitors are generally going up and down at the same time.<br>
<br>
<br>
(*) The alternative is to design a scrambling algorithm that tries to<br>
aim for a minimum level of entropy<br>

<br>
Through repetition most &#x27;fast&#x27; speedcubers execute F2L<br>
cases mechanically anyway (even though they started<br>
intuitively)<br>
<br>
Take commutators for example; there seems to be an<br>
agreement that this is an excellent function in<br>
solving for bld (though it has at least one other<br>
practical application in FMC).  <br>
<br>
Take any corner or edge subset, allow me time to match<br>
commutators with my own mechanical alg set.  In<br>
execution I am faster every time because I don&#x27;t waste<br>
time for intuition, which is ultimately a poor<br>
investment in speedcubing IMO.  <br>
<br>
Obviously there is going to be intuition involved in<br>
the F2L on some level, but the 41 cases need not be<br>
understood.<br>
<br>
Some years ago the consensus was that solving for one<br>
primary color was the best approach, yet dual solving<br>
becomes more common and proves itself very well.    <br>

          <div class="email-content">I had an idea about the order that people solve in a round; this might<br>
be useful for future record attempts as well as to curb possible cheating.<br>
<br>
The idea is to &#x27;seed&#x27; the competitors. The competitors would be ranked<br>
in order of their best time in contest, and then the competitors would<br>
go in order of speed, either from fastest to slowest or vice versa.<br>
Tied competitors would proceed in a random but previously decided<br>
order, and competitors who haven&#x27;t done the event in competition yet<br>
would go last (again in a random order, or perhaps decided by their<br>
unofficial record).<br>
<br>
If you have the fastest people go first, there will be less<br>
opportunity for cheating (since it is the fastest people who get more<br>
benefit from cheating, they are given less time in which to observe<br>
solves) and the fast people could help with scrambling and judging,<br>
but by about halfway through an event very few people would be<br>
watching since all of the really fast people had already gone. If you<br>
have the slowest people go first, people are encouraged to keep<br>
watching, and there is more of an opportunity for people who are not<br>
necessarily the fastest in the competition to break existing records,<br>
but on the other hand the fast people would have a ton of time to<br>
cheat (if they wanted to).<br>
<br>
Again, I don&#x27;t know if this will be useful, but it may be worthwhile<br>
to organize the competitors in an event in some order other than random.<br>

I would assume the vast vast majority of people who want to learn F2L
do so because they want to improve their speedcubing. People at this
point are usually beginners who know a beginner method, and want to
get faster by using a more advanced method. They won&#x27;t have anywhere
near enough experience to appreciate the finer points of F2L, why you
would even want to learn all those techniques you describe, they just
want to get faster.

So learning F2L algorithms, and fast ones at that, by rote, is the
quickest way to achieve this. When I first learned F2L, I did it from
a printable page on Ron&#x27;s website, and I think also Peter Jansen&#x27;s
tricks. It took some weeks, but I got there in the end, with brute
force. But that hasn&#x27;t stopped me, some years down the line, and with
a lot more experience and appreciation for the finer parts of the F2L,
completely understanding how all F2L algorithms work, knowing a lot of
shortcuts, choosing the easiest pairs, etc etc. And if I hadn&#x27;t
learned the algorithms in the first place, I doubt I ever would have
gained so much understanding!

Yes, I agree.

Additionally, you only consider a single competition. If you look at 
regional records instead of competitions, then we still have the case that 
you mention.

How do we compare to other sports/hobbies where each competition is 
different?
I am not thinking of:
- different weather conditions and altitude
Speed skating world records are generally broken inside, at high altitude 
like Calgary and Salt Lake City.
- different pressure
WC final is much harder than a local competition, for several reasons 
(better competition, more media, bigger audience, more to win, ...).
- different environment/equipment
Formula I tracks and itineraries for cycling are very different. Soccer 
pitches. Lighting.
- home/away advantage

I haven&#x27;t found hobbies/sports where a similar thing like a scramble is used 
that is the same per competition, but different for different competitions. 
At least not where still the regional records are recognised.
Anyone?

Sorry to steal the thread. I just think speedcubing is more a &quot;fight&quot; 
against yourself than against others. Or a &quot;fight&quot; outside the competition, 
more global. It is not like tennis, where you influence your opponent 
continuously.

Have fun,

Ron

BLD cubing could easily be put in during a memory sports championship<br>
as far as them being the exact same kind of brain sport.  We would<br>
either have to convince them to hold a BLD event at one of their<br>
competitions, or we could hold a few sanctioned memory sports events<br>
at one of our competitions.  Say speed cards, speed numbers, names and<br>
faces, things like that.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know if holding a speed cards event at a Rubik&#x27;s competition<br>
would draw memory competitors.  I sure would attend a memory sports<br>
competition if they held a WCA sanctioned BLD event though.  I would<br>
even try the memory events just for fun.<br>
<br>
Do the WCA regulations even allow the running of an officially<br>
sanctioned speed cards event at a Rubik&#x27;s competition?  This is of<br>
course assuming we followed all the memory sports rules of what is<br>
required for a sanctioned speed cards event.  Could I do that at an<br>
event I organize in my area?  Or would this somehow make it harder to<br>
get WCA sanctioning for my event?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello,

I tend to agree with you. I think there is nothing wrong in learning 
algorithms from a &#x27;sheet&#x27;. I heard about cubers that learned F2L 
intuitively that basically had a delay between pairing up and 
inserting the pair. It has advantages to learn this in one fluent 
motion.

I do highly recommend using your intuition during the learning 
process though. Knowing and understanding how the F2L algs move the 
pieces around allows you to solve the pairs from all angles, which is 
important if you want to speed up.

That is your definition of the best.

> Speedcubing is entirely compatible with a &quot;racing&quot; type of sport.
Except for the fact that there are easy scrambles and lucky cases, with easy 
and lucky depending on your solving method/style.
Also, most sports with different conditions (like marathon) do not have an 
official world record, but a &#x27;world best&#x27; result.

Have fun,

          <div class="email-content">Hi Michael,

In the past I considered the following options:
1) place competitors in a waiting area where they are separated from videos 
and other people.
2) give different scrambles to all competitors
3) give different scrambles to different groups of competitors, only in 
preliminary rounds
4) give the same scrambles to all competitors, but in random order
5) give the same scrambles to all competitors, but add a random move (or 
more)
6) have different scrambles per solve (of a round) and select a random one 
per competitor

I never considered your solution. It does have flaws, because it doesn&#x27;t 
solve the worst threat (my opinion) of someone knowing the scramble (f.e. by 
video analysis) and setting an incredible time with that knowledge.

Considering the way we run competitions now.
For small competitions all competitors have the same scrambles. There is 
little time in between competitors.
For first rounds of big competitions, we divide the competitors into groups, 
with different groups having different scrambles.
For second rounds and finals of big competitions all competitors have the 
same scrambles. Again there is little time in between competitors.

So basically there is always a small advantage, but the time is limited.

The current solution I think suits best and also deals with the lack of 
judges/scramblers problem.
It is not perfect though.

Have fun,

Ron

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Solving order within a round


I had an idea about the order that people solve in a round; this might
be useful for future record attempts as well as to curb possible cheating.

The idea is to &#x27;seed&#x27; the competitors. The competitors would be ranked
in order of their best time in contest, and then the competitors would
go in order of speed, either from fastest to slowest or vice versa.
Tied competitors would proceed in a random but previously decided
order, and competitors who haven&#x27;t done the event in competition yet
would go last (again in a random order, or perhaps decided by their
unofficial record).

If you have the fastest people go first, there will be less
opportunity for cheating (since it is the fastest people who get more
benefit from cheating, they are given less time in which to observe
solves) and the fast people could help with scrambling and judging,
but by about halfway through an event very few people would be
watching since all of the really fast people had already gone. If you
have the slowest people go first, people are encouraged to keep
watching, and there is more of an opportunity for people who are not
necessarily the fastest in the competition to break existing records,
but on the other hand the fast people would have a ton of time to
cheat (if they wanted to).

Again, I don&#x27;t know if this will be useful, but it may be worthwhile
to organize the competitors in an event in some order other than random.

<br>
That is a motivation to improve our methods so that luck plays less a<br>
part and the solver is more in control of the situation.<br>
<br>
In Australia, there is a kind of race where competitors must do several<br>
laps of swimming out from the beach to a floating buoy some distance out<br>
from shore, and then swim back to shore, taking advantage of the<br>
ever changing surf conditions. The lower-end competitors sometimes have<br>
some luck and manage to catch the right wave at the right time, but luck<br>
plays less of a part in the performance of the experts, since they<br>
invariably end up in the lead by being better able to take advantage of<br>
whatever random conditions are thrown at them.<br>
<br>
So yes, they can have lucky waves, or unlucky waves, which is similar to<br>
lucky cases and unlucky cases. So, it is compatible with racing. I don&#x27;t<br>
think we have any &quot;grandmasters&quot; in our sport yet, but if we did have<br>
them, I&#x27;m sure they would be hindered less by unlucky cases and find a<br>
way to take advantage of whatever situation was thrown at them.<br>
<br>
It is still possible that someone can win with a lot of luck, just as in<br>
many other sports. The best person doesn&#x27;t always win, but over a larger<br>
number of competitions, the best person should win the most.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
The following is an issue in the current WCA regulations for Fewest <br>
moves.<br>
<br>
E2e) The solution of the competitor must not be in any way related to <br>
the scrambling algorithm. Penalty: disqualification of the solve. <br>
<br>
There is no way to objectively decide whether this is the case. <br>
(Except for the obvious cases of course...)<br>
<br>
So we are looking for a scramble method that fits the following <br>
requirements:<br>
- gives random scrambles (comparable to current quality)<br>
- scrambles are 40 or more moves long (to prevent someone just <br>
undoing the moves)<br>
- is easy to execute without making mistakes (so preferrably contains <br>
a lot of repeating moves)<br>
<br>
One example would be:<br>
A 4 random moves of 4 random different sides<br>
B 4 times (4 random moves of 4 random different sides)<br>
C 4 random moves of 4 random different sides<br>
D 4 times (4 random moves of 4 random different sides) of which 2 <br>
sides are the remaining sides of B<br>
No idea if this would give could quality though.<br>
<br>
Any other thoughts?<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hmm, have you tried switching the center caps around? Since it&#x27;s not
all uniform, some caps might fit in certain positions better than
others. If that fails, I suppose you could try using thicker paper. Or
two pieces of paper.

          <div class="email-content">Just a thought regarding the repeated moves, you would have to take
care that your repeated moves didn&#x27;t turn into a commutator affecting
only a small number of pieces, or like I did in one competition,
generate a repeating set that in effect did nothing to the cube (you
could have left it out and still got the same scramble).

When generating them, you would also have to be clever in not
generating repeating sets such as (R U R&#x27;)*n because that is of course
only U*n

That is of course, all assuming you went down the route of repeating
moves, as used in the first Fewest Moves Scrambles in the (was it
CFF?) magazine.

Regarding the quality of the scrambles, I don&#x27;t have the know-how (and
from what I have read about the standard speedcubing scrambles on here
lately it&#x27;s not an easy subject) to give any advice here, but I&#x27;m sure
other more mathematically inclined cubers will contribute :)

          <div class="email-content">This is a common debate (not surprisingly),
and it&#x27;s worthwhile for beginners to hear.
At the speedsolving level, of course, both memorization and
intuitiveness become mechanical anyway.  The difference doesn&#x27;t lie
there.
Intuitive solving reinforces this community as one of thinkers rather
than one of robots,
and it implies a continuing evolution of methodology.

Yes, that is the fallback option. Just checking whether someone can come up 
with an alternative.
In recent competitions we gave all competitors a printed sheet with the 
scramble and setup (standard color scheme), to make sure they can check the 
scrambled position.

Subject: [Speed cubing group] Italian Open !


Hi everybody !

I&#x27;m searching a way to go to the italian Open, and i have to leave
after friday 6h00 PM.
Is there somebody who go there by car ?
I could take the train to Turin, and we could see there... That&#x27;s just
a possibility.

If someone is interested, tell me :-)
I really would like to go there....

Thanks

Edouard

  Yes, that is the fallback option. Just checking whether someone can come up 
  with an alternative.
  In recent competitions we gave all competitors a printed sheet with the 
  scramble and setup (standard color scheme), to make sure they can check the 
  scrambled position.

  I don&#x27;t like repeating scramble moves. That makes it more complicated
  and could very well actually increase the time. And when I
  participated in Dan&#x27;s FMC a few times, counting the number of
  repetitions while reading/applying the alg was the cause for most of
  my mistakes, so I think it doesn&#x27;t prevent but cause mistakes.

  Why not just use the same generator we use right now and let it
  produce 40 moves? Fairly easy to apply in 20 seconds, and for FMC
  most of the time is spent for solving anyway, not for scrambling.

  Cheers!

I have coded a scrambler that has repeating parts and different 
patterns like say : part-repeated part - part - repeated part - part

It is coded such that there is guaranteed no redundancy. It doesn&#x27;t 
exactly match the suggestion with a minimal number of layers used in 
each repeating part. I wrote it for the FMC and it was used for quite 
a while, before dan switched back to straight 25-turn scrambles 
again. If there&#x27;s any interest i will be able to share it with 
others, and/or modify it further. Then someone could generate a set 
scrambles with it and check (somehow) whether the scrambles are good 
enough. Possible criteria:

- find optimal solutions and make sure the optimal solution is say > 
17 turns

- No obvious easy starts (subjective) regardless if optimal solution 
is ok.

- No obvious bias towards using any layer more than any other

etc etc ...

          <div class="email-content">I don&#x27;t know the rules for this, so I&#x27;d like to ask.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, it seems, StackMat timers (especially older generation 2<br>
timers) can stop at a time one second greater than the actual time. So<br>
when the time should be 26.99 or 27.00 it may say 27.99 instead. This<br>
hasn&#x27;t happened to me on my StackMat timer, but I&#x27;ve seen it on my<br>
digital stopwatch and I know it&#x27;s happened to other people.<br>
<br>
Now here&#x27;s the thing. Normally, you can&#x27;t really tell if a solve that<br>
ends up displaying xx.99 should be that time or one second less,<br>
unless you had judges carefully watching the timer (which is totally<br>
impractical). But in very short events, that one second can be both<br>
easily detectable and important.<br>
<br>
Specifically, I&#x27;m thinking of the Magic. If a competitor does the<br>
Magic in 0.99 seconds (which will become more and more likely in the<br>
future), but the timer says 1.99 seconds, it is generally easy for<br>
both the judge and the solver to see that the solve did not take two<br>
seconds. Although (to my knowledge) this has never happened in<br>
competition, I am worried that it may happen, and I&#x27;d like to know how<br>
it would be dealt with.<br>
<br>
My fastest Magic solves are around 1.00 second, and there is a competition<br>
in two weeks (where I will be trying primarily for a good single<br>
solve) that I will be going to, so this concerns me a great deal...<br>

Are you sure it has happened?

There&#x27;s an alternative explanation for Bob&#x27;s case, namely that the 
timer &quot;forgot&quot; to replace the previous result (also 3.96!) with the 
new one. How do you know it&#x27;s a &quot;+1 error&quot; instead?

Actually, for that video, it looks like the time was officially<br>

<br>
I know that no video or photographic evidence is allowed for<br>

let the judges make their decision. If someone happens to be taping a<br>
Magic or Master Magic solve where this occurs, I think that it would<br>
be very important to be sure of the time of the solve (especially<br>

Hmm, I didn&#x27;t think of that.  I&#x27;ll admit that this is pure 
speculation, but I&#x27;m betting it was the +1 error.  My only bit 
of &quot;evidence&quot; is that the last time you can see before he stops the 
timer is 2.93, which makes it seem like 2.96 is approximately the 
right time.  Though the fact that he got two 2.96&#x27;s in a row 
certainly makes the other possibility possible.  I&#x27;m not sure how the 
stackmat works entirely and thus have no authority to judge what is 
possible and what isn&#x27;t, but for some reason the &quot;forgetting&quot; 
explanation doesn&#x27;t seem all that likely to me.

Correction: it&#x27;s on his magic average comment:
&quot;I&#x27;ve gotten 1.00 a few times now.I also got a 0.97 but it was a DNF 
and it did that weird timer malfunction and displayed as a 1.97.&quot;

It is indeed possible as well.
>From what I have seen in the video, there is a serious bug...

The electronic design and the embedded software (I would guess it is
done with a PIC?) should be seriously reviewed to know what&#x27;s going on. 

We need to
- know if we can trust the result or if we have to &quot;sometimes&quot;
substract 1s (in other words, is the problem in the timer or the
display part?)
- get a fully working one... 1s error is huge considering current WRs

Maybe someone can forward this video to the constructor/designer of
the stackmat, to at least get them a clue that a bug exists?

malfunction, but it did not prove to be very useful.  I am fairly sure
it is not the display because I recall that solve very clearly and
know what a sub-3 master magic solve feels like.  I can tell the
difference between 2.9 and 3.9 seconds.  After the solve, I even asked
Ton (my judge) if the timer had been reset because I knew that the
solve was faster than what the timer displayed, but he assured me it was.

You raise an interesting point, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a case of the<br>
StackMat forgetting to record a result and instead displaying a<br>
previous one that<br>
just happens to be one second off.<br>
<br>
The main reason is because this hasn&#x27;t been reported for any times that<br>
weren&#x27;t within 0.1 second of a whole number of seconds. I don&#x27;t see<br>
how something that only occurs right before a whole number of seconds<br>
and only replaces a time with another time that is almost exactly 1<br>
second more can happen, unless it was deliberately programmed in. If<br>
it was an inadvertent bug (and if you trust the StackMat guys you have<br>
to assume it was), where one time was replaced with the<br>
previous one, the actual time would not be an issue - there&#x27;s nothing<br>
special about x.9x times except that they are right before the second,<br>
which wouldn&#x27;t affect memory errors, just timing errors.<br>
<br>
Besides, I&#x27;ve seen this on my stopwatch as well, and I can say for<br>
certain that on my stopwatch it is doing a +1 timing error and not<br>
replacing it with a previous time (since the error result is almost<br>
never the same as the previous time).<br>

I have had this +1 happen along with several other people who I live
with on 3 different stackmats.  From what I&#x27;ve seen, it seems to
happen only when the number is close to rolling over to the next
second (above .90) and it is on the timer and not the display since I
don&#x27;t have one of those.

For basic CFOP this is true. But because some people (extremely rare<br>

they learn new things like X-cross or block building. This would be<br>
much harder if they had just memorized the &quot;41 F2L algs&quot; instead of<br>
doing it intuitively. And if X-cross becomes mechanical and too easy,<br>
just move on to double X-cross. There are always new things to learn,<br>
speedcubing doesn&#x27;t need to mechanical.<br>
<br>
When I hear questions like &quot;Where can I find the algorithms for the<br>
extended cross method?&quot;, or when someone knows 2-look LL even though<br>
he/she averages above a minute, it makes me very sad. I wish there<br>
were more cubing sites that weren&#x27;t just lists of algorithms for<br>
Fridrich. Beginners too often get the idea that speedcubing is just<br>
about memorization.<br>
<br>
I started practising Petrus almost 2 years ago, but 2x2x3 block isn&#x27;t<br>
mechanical for me yet. And I don&#x27;t want it to be.<br>
<br>
&gt; Intuitive solving reinforces this community as one of thinkers rather<br>

This is a very good point, too. But maybe it should be &quot;Intuitive<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hello everybody,<br>
<br>
Yesterday evening I found an OLL algorithm that might be new... <br>
Well, some may know it, but I have never seen it. It is a variation <br>
of F RU&#x27;R&#x27;U&#x27;RUR&#x27; F&#x27;. It solves one of the &#x27;knight move&#x27; shapes. Do <br>
the inverse or the move 3 times to setup:<br>
<br>
F U RU2R&#x27; U&#x27; RUR&#x27; F&#x27;<br>
<br>
F with right index, U with right ring. U2 with right index going all <br>
the way from BRU to FLU, without letting go of the cube with the <br>
right hand.<br>
<br>
As I always do before switching an OLL, I carefully investigate if <br>
it&#x27;s a wise thing to do :). I timed my old algorithm and this one <br>
without a few times rushing, but just with a nice pace. The new <br>
algorithm is definately faster and quite consistent. Other <br>
advantages: No cube rotations... Also, some &#x27;blocks&#x27; of pieces in <br>
the LL stay together during the algorithm. This can help PLL <br>
recognition during execution. I see that as a plus.<br>
<br>
- Joël.<br>
<br>
PS: I also found another alg, but I am not swithching for that one: <br>
R&#x27;U2RU y&#x27; x&#x27; RU&#x27;R&#x27;F RUR&#x27;.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi Joï¿½l,

In the case of Bob it is proven beyond doubt that there was a timer 
malfunction.
We got a free replacement of the timer. But there could be an internal bug.
Because the timer showed exactly the same time as the previous time, it 
might have been an error situation where the last time was shown again.
Yes, the display is slightly behind, but my experience is that it is never 
more than .2 behind. In Bob&#x27;s case it was a full second. And we did see the 
start of the solve.

If someone would sell products that have a rare bug in it, then they could 
(not saying they are) silently solve it in new versions of the product. That 
is why I am interested whether the same problem occurs in the new version 
with the save option.

I searched Google with keywords like &quot;stackmat&quot; and &quot;malfunction&quot; and found 
nothing but speedcubing info.
Funnily most of the sites with a hit on the word &quot;stackmat&quot; are about 
cubing. :-)

Have fun,

Ron

Thanks for clearing that up. The video looked convincing to me

We do not accept video analysis, so there is hardly a way to prove that such

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Those applets are really really cool. I especially appreciate the 
guidelines showing what parts of the puzzles would be turned by 
clicking when moving the cursor over the polyhedra. Most computer 
simulations i have seen are a bit confusing wrt what layers will be 
turned when clicking various places.

One suggestion though, how about merging all those applets into one? 
I bet they all share the same core engine anyway, at least within 
each family.

<br>
There are a few things I&#x27;d like to ask or request:<br>
- Could you please add a puzzle like the Megaminx but with one<br>
additional, shallower face-turn axis (the &quot;Gigaminx&quot;)?<br>
- Could you change the colors on some of the puzzles (the cubes would<br>
be the most important) to more closely resemble Rubik&#x27;s Cube colors,<br>
or allow the user to change the colors for given types of polyhedra?<br>
- How about tetrahedron puzzles? Those can be interesting.<br>
- Have you seen the &quot;Helicopter Cube&quot;<br>
(http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6253)? I think that<br>
that would be a good addition to your library.<br>
- Would it be possible, for some puzzles, to allow drag-drop turns,<br>
where you drag from one sticker to another to turn a slice? I imagine<br>
that for the less complicated puzzles this would be unambiguous most<br>
of the time.<br>
- I don&#x27;t understand what makes a turn be clockwise and what makes it<br>
be counterclockwise. Could you explain how this works?<br>
- Could you make the divisions between the pieces smaller? It&#x27;s<br>
sometimes hard to see the very small pieces.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi,

Just while we are talking about lubing bigger cubes, it&#x27;s quite tough
to lube a 5x5 using this method, because if you took out 3 adjacent
edge pieces, the likelihood is that more pieces of the cube will fall
out, and it can get pretty frustrating.

For the 5x5x5, I would recommend turning the top layer at 45 degrees
to the next layer down, that layer 45 degrees to the layer beneath
that, etc etc, and the put a drop of lube on each exposed part of the
internal layer. Then turn it to rub the lube in. Repeat by turning
layers on a different axis if necessary.

All the best,
Dan :)

Double-layers moves are more tricker than single-layer moves when

Thanks for your suggestions.
I think the best solution for now is:
- 50 moves scrambles (40 moves it too short given recent results in 
competitions)
- scramble printed on a paper, including the scrambled position in standard 
colour scheme

But maybe Anders can explain how we can solve the problems he mentions? :-)

Have fun,

Ron

One way of solving this issue is to not disclose the scrambling
algorithm to the competitor. I fully acknowledge the practical
problems that this will imply, but maybe they can be resolved.

          <div class="email-content">Well, of course, Ron ;-) One possibility can be that the scrambled 
cube is given electronically in a program like the FMC Cube 
Companion (as found at Dan Harris&#x27; FMC site) with the scramble 
algorithm deleted, and the competitor uses this program to find his 
solution. If going for this, however, the organiser must provide 
computers for the competitors...

Well, you could have a judge at the front scramble all of the cubes<br>
before the event and then rescramble anyone&#x27;s cube(s) when they come<br>
up to ask. Or you could scramble every cube at the beginning, and then<br>
just give the competitors a sheet with a picture of the scramble.<br>
<br>
But both of these would slow the competitors down a lot, and it&#x27;s<br>
already hard to come up with a good solution within an hour.<br>

Yes.  You guys are going to be disappointed.  No mindblowing methods
or anything but he is very good.  He knows how to manipulate pieces
into predefined cases very well. He does EO CO EP CP in this order. 
We both use the same approaches, only with slightly different algorithms.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

A time.limited fewest moves with a picture and no scramble given will 
be more an exercise in &quot;state-reproduction&quot; than actually solving the 
position. I thik this defeats the object of fewest moves 
competitions. Yes, long scrambles will prevent abusing the scramble 
somehow. However, for fewest moves as well as for normal spedsolving 
i don&#x27;t really see the problem in allowing random scrambles that MAY 
be below average complexity. Why have this added restriction only for 
fewest moves and not normal speedsolving. I don&#x27;t agree with that :-)
Personally i do like repeated parts in scrambles, makes it easier to 
set it up. Stefan if you find that hard then just practice it. You 
learnt counting in first grade at school ;-) It&#x27;s easy to prevent 
reduction problems with repeated parts!!

I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s not a new method.  Suspicions confirmed that I&#x27;m a 
hopelessly slow turner compared to most guys.  Seems like a lefty- 
darn southpaws ;).

Bit of an odd setup.  But seems like 3-cycles for corners probably 
his normal approach.  Probably recognized the situation on this 
setup; well done, especially memorizing so fast.

Very nice solve, particularly from the *hand speed* standpoint.  
Could never do all those moves in 31 seconds.  Don&#x27;t know if I can 
improve that much with coordination.  

Very glad it&#x27;s not a new system; hats off to his abilities!

Thanks again for posting,

-Dave O.

          <div class="email-content">Hi everybody,<br>
Thank you for your comments.<br>
I really didn&#x27;t expect so much favorable responses.<br>
It&#x27;s already a great success for me.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m sorry that my applet caused a crash for some of you.<br>
I should have warned that I didn&#x27;t test on non-Windows platform<br>
Basically it should work on Mac, Linux  and Solaris too,<br>
because my applet doesn&#x27;t include any native codes.<br>
If other applets using JOGL(JAVA OpenGL), for example<br>
https://jogl-demos.dev.java.net/applettest.html<br>
invoke the same crash,<br>
the cause is very probably at  JOGL side.<br>
Unfortunately I have no way to verify at this moment.<br>
<br>
Answering some of your questions:<br>
<br>
&gt;- I don&#x27;t understand what makes a turn be clockwise and what makes it<br>
&gt;be counterclockwise. Could you explain how this works?<br>
<br>
Generally, left button is  for counter-clockwise and right-button for<br>
clockwise twist.<br>
Except: if you clicked  on a edge piece of a cube,<br>
left button turns the inner slice toward the direction of screen<br>
(just as you pushed it really with your finger) and right button makes the<br>
opposite.<br>
Is it confusing? I thought it&#x27;s more intuitional...<br>
<br>
I will continue to improve my  work consulting your suggestions.<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot,<br>
Paul the Gelatinbrain<br>

Jesus Shelley, a little harsh there?

I count &quot;Idiot&quot; level on the punctuation. I liked that point most.

It&#x27;s not like Tyson&#x27;s busy at all or anything. He should just &quot;solv&quot;
the man&#x27;s F2L. He should also use his magical powers to know what the
problem is and what the F2L looks like at this very moment.

I&#x27;m just kidding Shelley. Well handled, but I was expecting a
different source. :)

What difference does it make from getting help from Tyson Mao or
another speedcuber? don&#x27;t say he is a professional since i&#x27;m sure that
he does not get paid to speedcube. We don&#x27;t need people like you in
the speedcubing community. Good luck on the f2l.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

My guess is that since the applets use JOGL it has more to do with the
hardware if the applet is not working or crashing. I don&#x27;t really
think it&#x27;s OS/Browser related. But i could be wrong :D

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I have done a bit of hacking to make a &quot;forum&quot;-style interface to this<br>
Yahoo! group:<br>
<br>
    http://oosan.ryanheise.com/<br>
<br>
This means that all of us who prefer to read our messages via email, and<br>
all of the rest who prefer to use forums can now happily coexist :-)<br>
<br>
Well, it is not perfect yet... For example, I am not displaying the date<br>
of any of the messages, but I will get around to that eventually.<br>
<br>
Yes, you can even use your own &quot;avatar&quot; through Gravatar:<br>
<br>
    http://site.gravatar.com/<br>
<br>
A few other points:<br>
<br>
- At the moment, I am only keeping the 20 most recent threads due to<br>
  disk space limitations, and for older threads I provide a link back to<br>
  the Yahoo! groups archive.<br>
<br>
- My program will try to chop off excessive quotes, particularly bottom<br>
  quotes. Top quotes are left intact, though, because these are usually<br>
  more selectively chosen by the author and therefore more relevant to<br>
  the post.<br>
<br>
- The code uses all sorts of tricks and I would be surprised if it works<br>
  in any browser I haven&#x27;t tested. So far, I have only tested Firefox on<br>
  Linux and IE6 (under WINE on Linux).<br>

In the case of the last forum (petrusmethod), it is set up so that you<br>
can&#x27;t view the messages from the outside unless you join the group.<br>
There is probably a case here, but I&#x27;ll let Lars say whether he wants<br>
me to remove this forum from my interface. I hope Lars doesn&#x27;t mind,<br>
since I think it would be useful to be able to read all 4 forums side<br>
by side.<br>
<br>
The first three forums are public mailing lists (the content is<br>
written and owned by us, and is implicitly shared with everyone) and<br>
this is generally ok. There are several examples of other services<br>
which provide public archives of mailing lists (including Yahoo!&#x27;s<br>
eGroups mailing lists) on the internet, including:<br>
<br>
http://www.mail-archive.com/<br>
http://gmane.org/<br>
<br>
This group (speedsolvingrubikscube) is actually archived on both of<br>
those services.<br>

Thanks :-) It was quite a large project, I guess about 1 month&#x27;s work,
with a number of technical challenges (as you might expect). Now that
these challenge are sorted out, I&#x27;m happy that it can now see the
light of day :-)

The situation is actually much simpler and there is no need for
finding a loophole or anything like that.

Yes, Yahoo!&#x27;s terms of service do state that we may not reproduce
(i.e. copy) their material, but the material in question is not owned
by Yahoo! and therefore falls outside of their rights on material.

To possibly make you feel a little more comfortable, we would be free,
for example, to move to another mailing list server and import our
data across into the new system, because it is our data, and not theirs.

For the people who missed it, Craig&#x27;s episode aired tonight, and it
was really good. He did a speed solve which was 16.xx, and then did a
blindfold solve which was just over 3 minutes.  They didn&#x27;t show the
entire memorization and execution, of course. But they just kept
skipping ahead, with the time constantly showing so viewers knew it
was being edited for time.  

But his cubing was not the only good thing. He answered questions
well, and represented cubing like a pro.  Congratulations, Craig.  The
question will be when can we get a video of it? 

If we do, it will be available on http://www.canadiancubing.com but i
don&#x27;t suspect it will be in the coming days.

Great job, Craig!

you and had a crappy cube laying around test it to see how long it
takes for the cube to melt and how high the flames get, for some
reason gas tends to burn really good. Who knew cubing could be so
dangerous.

Unless you are a pro of such things, I do NOT recommend you to do this.
You could suffer from bad and irreparable injuries and burns not just on your hands but all over your body if something bad happens.

As you know, gasoline is quite dangerous.

I just wanted to bring you guys back to the earth and its relaities.

  yea get video of it I think all of us would like to see it. If I were
  you and had a crappy cube laying around test it to see how long it
  takes for the cube to melt and how high the flames get, for some
  reason gas tends to burn really good. Who knew cubing could be so
  dangerous.

Unless you are a pro of such things, I do NOT recommend you to do this.
You could suffer from bad and irreparable injuries and burns not just on your hands but all over your body if something bad happens.

As you know, gasoline is quite dangerous.

I just wanted to bring you guys back to the earth and its relaities.

          <div class="email-content">no secret trick, just practice and experience.  the 4x4x4 solvers on <br>
youtube are most likely not beginners.  practice turning them slower <br>
and practicing lining up the sides perfectly at first.  will more time <br>
you will get better and it will be easier for you to turn fast without <br>

I had an interesting thought tonight and wanted to ask about it. <br>
Obviously for a layer-by-layer method it makes intuitive sense to<br>

Gasoline is really toxic, and it will produce very bad fumes for you.  I

DO SOME RESEARCH!  How do those waiters light their fingers on fire?
Alcohol burns at a MUCH lower temperature.  Dip your fingers in alcohol, dip
the cube in alcohol, and then try to avoid the alcohol spreading past your
fingers.

If I organized a tournament for this upcoming August, would people

Let me know.

          <div class="email-content">Hmm... interesting.  I checked www.archive.org and you are correct.  
The old Fridrich URL was 
http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html.

It shows up on this group as early as 2000:

http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/21

It does not appear at all in the old Cube-Lovers mailing list (except 
as part of an alg like D2F2L2U2D).

I seem to remember this group losing a bunch of messages in early 
2000 or so.  It was probably coined on this group and is now lost on 
one of Yahoo&#x27;s old backup tapes.

Anybody remember an earlier usage (like from the 1980s?)

<br>
Below is a link to my first solve in the finals of the latest Rutgers<br>
tournament (many thanks to Bruce Norskog for the clip).  I got a<br>
chance to chat with the judge (I don&#x27;t remember his name) during the<br>
tournament and he was a pretty cool guy but he needed a refresher in<br>
how to judge at just the wrong time!  In his defense, I&#x27;m the one that<br>
trained him so it&#x27;s my fault.  Anyway, I think the beginning of the<br>
video is pretty funny.  <br>

My best average is 14.12 which I got a week ago or so. My best is
10.28. I&#x27;ve improved my F2L a lot lately, so sub-14 average won&#x27;t be a
big problem.

          <div class="email-content">well i guess its just practice from there.  top down is extremely <br>
important (in my opinion) to getting faster.  this allows you to see <br>
moves and cubie placement in advance and not have to pause between <br>
algorithms to turn the cube over and look for your next move.  notice <br>
this may cause you to re-learn alot of the algorithms upside down from <br>
what you are used to.  take learning top down slow and work on finding <br>
shortcuts (finger tricks, etc.) to the algorithms.<br>
<br>
brain dead and cant think of anything else right now.<br>

this is about my 2nd month speedcubing (trying at least).  i have been 
doing regular casual cubing (the way where you only have to know like 5 
algs) for about a year.  dont think that counts since i learned all new 
algs for speedcubing.

Hi Patrick, <br>
<br>
This question (or a similar one) is in the CubeOosan database which<br>
means you can experience the joys of &quot;Ask the oracle&quot;:<br>

I would be interested to know if, without any instructions from me,<br>

Average is around 14.07 seconds... That&#x27;s based on 100 cubes. I think

Unless CFOP stands for &quot;Cross, Four pairs, Orientation, Permutation&quot;.
I don&#x27;t know. To me, CFOP always sounded more like &quot;Corners First then

          <div class="email-content">In my opinion the C in CFOP is there just to indicate how to start 
F2L. The F2L still means solving the first 2 layers (with all it&#x27;s 
cubies - including the cross). It is then easily deduced that step 2 
is equal to solving those 4 famous c/e pairs. If Chris had asked what 
the F in CFOP means i agree it&#x27;s the completion of F2L excluding the 
cross ;-) Anyway, this is now semantical nitpicking ;-)

Well, I started in 1983 or so when they can out and I averaged about 38 
seconds with a best of 23.  Stopped in about 1985 and just picked it up 
again about 3 months ago.  I went back to the old method I used in the 
80&#x27;s.  I guess if I want to get faster, I need to change something.

          <div class="email-content">Here is a new tip I have worked on is R-OLL(Recognition during OLL),<br>
the deal is to look at the corner scheme before doing OLL, in order to<br>
anticipate the corner scheme after OLL. Now I apply this with about<br>
20% of OLL&#x27;s and save about 0.5-1s on my average times. I recommend<br>
this first to sub-20 cubers, because you should be very used to OLL<br>
and PLL to do this.<br>
Because of the way I worked my OLL, all identical schemes are placed<br>
identically(for example I place the two &quot;thunder&quot; OLL with the same<br>
pattern), and for PLL too. For all PLL of what I call the B<br>
type(A,T,J,R,G,F) I place the 2 correctly place corners on the L side.<br>
Then then R-OLL is perfectly adapted to my system. I recommend to<br>
start with OLL&#x27;s with all oriented edges to get used to the tip.<br>

With the roux method you never do the F2L. Two adjacent layers are
never solved. Two opposite are, but not two adjacent.

I suppose you could still call that F2L though, since two layers have
still been solved.

Our paths may have crossed quite literally then.

Actually to enjoy Koninginnedag I would have to have been there a day 
earlier. Now that day was just meeting my family and sleeping early. 

Anyway we had lots of fun. A thanks goes to Ron, Ton, Jaap for the 
effort of organizing a meeting and to Joel for visiting me in my home 
town.

It&#x27;s always fun to meet other cubers. I hope to meet you and Jasmine 
at some event in the future too, but unfortunately I will not be at 
Worlds this year.

I don&#x27;t know why you and Erik Akkersdijk weren&#x27;t able to join us, but 
maybe you&#x27;ve been left out of the loop unintentionally. If so I 
apologize. We had a nice meeting in a restaurant in Zeist, and 
continued &quot;being puzzled&quot; for hours.

maybe next time then!

          <em>From:</em> cmhardw &lt;no_reply@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br>
          <em>To:</em> speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi all you math people,

I read about the universal parabolic constant on mathworld.wolfram.com
and first off I thought it was amazing, and second off I wanted to try
to construct a proof of it.

I wanted to ask if I&#x27;ve done this correctly.  What I did was as follows:

I define a parabola to be any general function of the form
f(x)=a*x^2+b*x+c where a,b,c and real numbers.

Using the directrix as the equation :
y=[-b^2+4ac-1]/(2a)

and the focus as the point:
( -b/(2a) , [-b^2+4ac+1]/(2a) )

*and* additionally restricting the variable a to be a > 0 I found the
focal parameter to be: 1/(2a)

For the arc length of the segment formed by the latus rectum I just
used the following integral:

integral from (-b-1)/2a to (-b+1)/2a of sqrt(1+(2ax+b)^2)dx

This gave me a value of [sqrt(2)+ln(sqrt(2)+1)]/2a

Taking the ratio of this arc length to the focal parameter gave me the
desired constant of sqrt(2) + ln(sqrt(2)+1)

To complete the proof I then let a &lt; 0 .  In this case I said that I
would instead look at the function:
g(x)=-f(x)

This gives me a new function
g(x)=a&#x27;*x^2+b&#x27;*x+c&#x27; where a&#x27; > 0 .  By the previous part of the proof
this parabola has the universal parabolic constant of:
sqrt(2) + ln(sqrt(2)+1)

Since the g(x) parabola was formed only by a reflection about the x
axis of the original f(x) parabola with a &lt; 0 then the constant for
the parabola g(x) is the same as for the parabola f(x) with a &lt; 0 .

---------------

Have I done this correctly and rigorously enough?  I have obviously
left out the intermediate steps.  My main question is does restricting
a > 0 and finding the constant for that general parabola, then solving
the a &lt; 0  case by reflecting about the x axis count as a valid
approach to this proof?

Thanks,
Chris

I don&#x27;t know why you and Erik Akkersdijk weren&#x27;t able to join us, but
maybe you&#x27;ve been left out of the loop unintentionally. If so I
apologize. We had a nice meeting in a restaurant in Zeist, and
continued &quot;being puzzled&quot; for hours.

maybe next time then!

          <div class="email-content">Initially learned from Tyson, and taken nearly everything I know from him and Leyan. 
Nothing particularly special that I do. 

I really don&#x27;t feel I deserve this record. That solve is not representative of my times, my 
1:39 from Idaho is far more realistic. Many of you are much faster than me, this solve was 
just very easy. I know it sounds arrogant to say this, and I don&#x27;t mean it to be, but it 
should&#x27;ve been a lot faster. I&#x27;m out of practice and my memorization was rather slow, and 
my cube is in terrible shape (ask Craig). I think it could have easily been a 25/35 
breakdown for a 60 second solve. 

Tyson and Leyan should have the credit, because without them as teachers and inspiration 
to improve, this wouldn&#x27;t have happened. Thanks guys. 

And also thanks to Dave for putting on such a good competition. Despite scheduling and 
space issues, he kept it running very well. I intend to copy some things he did for Chicago.

Stockholm is absolutly butiful in August. Why not combine a weeks 
vacation in the town and the competition over the weekend?

The competition will also be great of course =)

Anyone who plan to come?

I improved my alg to:

RM2 U2 M&#x27; U2 RM&#x27; U2 RM U2 LM U2 RM U2 RM U2 RM&#x27; U2 RM

I does not disturbe anything but the two deges and is pretty fast to 
do so I like it a lot =)

Maybe it&#x27;s possible to tweek it so you can use double layers, I have 
not tried, I&#x27;m into slices and does thoes as quickly as dbl layers so 
for me it&#x27;s not nessesary.

or maybe the scramble, so we can try it...maybe I can get a new PB : )

oh, and glad to know he uses the same method as me...so there&#x27;s still hope : P

You&#x27;ll have to memorize two different &quot;keys&quot; for each edge piece- for
example, I&#x27;ll use the blue and orange one. When blue is in the UL
(top) position, I&#x27;ll do d&#x27;L to turn that place where i want it to go
into an easy t-perm. After the t-perm, do L&#x27;d to put that piece back
where it is. On the other hand, if Orange is on top, simply do L&#x27;
before the t-perm, reversing it with L at the end. You simply have to
match up the top of one cubie with the correct orientation of the
place you want it to go. I had a little trouble with this concept
until I emailed Stefan- he proved to be a great help. I still have a
little trouble with the corners, but it&#x27;s coming along.

btw I had fun making up the keys for memorization- OB is a frozen
construction worker :-P

I will pretend it was the horrible cafeteria food i made you go eat
before the blindfold event that helped. But no, Chris. You deserve the
WR. Everyone else there had the same scramble, and no one came close.
It is about having the ability to make the most of a situation. And
you did that.  We can&#x27;t go on about it would have been faster if
someone faster was there to get the same scramble. We could do that
for every record. 

Congratulations on your record, it was fantastic. Yes, we have it on
video, and we will work to make it available very soon.  It has a fair
amount of comedy involved, too.  Chris is such a great guy that he
didn&#x27;t want to make a sound as everyone else was still doing their
bld.  So pictures a mime winning a WR, without the make up. Classic stuff.

And let me take the opportunity to thank Chris for coming up and
helping me out SO MUCH. It was unbelievable. He is a great guy. 

See you at US Open.

  I never tried an eastsheen cube, but rubik&#x27;s brands pops when you try
  to speedcube with it. I only had it for 2 weeks and one of the center
  pieces broke, after poping. The bottem thing that holds it to the

 I will pretend it was the horrible cafeteria food i made you go eat
 before the blindfold event that helped. But no, Chris. You deserve the
 WR. Everyone else there had the same scramble, and no one came close.
 It is about having the ability to make the most of a situation. And
 you did that.  We can&#x27;t go on about it would have been faster if
 someone faster was there to get the same scramble. We could do that
 for every record. 
 
 Congratulations on your record, it was fantastic. Yes, we have it on
 video, and we will work to make it available very soon.  It has a fair
 amount of comedy involved, too.  Chris is such a great guy that he
 didn&#x27;t want to make a sound as everyone else was still doing their
 bld.  So pictures a mime winning a WR, without the make up. Classic stuff.
 
 And let me take the opportunity to thank Chris for coming up and
 helping me out SO MUCH. It was unbelievable. He is a great guy. 
 
 See you at US Open.

          <div class="email-content">Eastsheen cubes are very fast out of the box, and often it&#x27;s even<br>
better not to lube them (as they can get loose after a while). They<br>
are very stable - I&#x27;ve never had a piece break on my two-year-old<br>
Eastsheen 5x5x5. But they cannot cut corners at all, so you have to be<br>
very careful to align the slices.<br>
<br>
Rubik/Studio cubes are slow out of the box, although they become<br>
faster when they are worn in and lubed. They aren&#x27;t that stable, but<br>
if a piece breaks you can get another of the same piece from<br>
Cubesmith. They can cut corners very well due to their design, though.<br>
<br>
My advice is this: if you want a cube to play or practice with, or if<br>
you want to be fast but not necessarily world-class, get an Eastsheen.<br>
But if you want a cube to go extremely fast on, and you are willing to<br>
put a lot of time into that specific cube, get a Rubik or Studio cube.<br>
<br>
For illustration, my best 5x5x5 average is 2:30, on my Eastsheen, and<br>
I think I could do better on a good Rubik cube, but I don&#x27;t have the<br>

know....)<br>
and i threw it too high and it smashed all over the ground<br>
the problem with this is that the core with the spindal thing broke <br>
into two peices with 3 centers on each peice<br>
its a rubik brand cube that i bought off of amazon<br>
will simply gluing the core back together work or will it screw every <br>

 order from CubeSmith placed on or after April 17th?  A friend of mine 
 needed to get some sticker replacements for his son, so I recommended 
 CubeSmith.  Now, he&#x27;s getting kinda frustrated, since there has been 
 no communication.
 
 When he placed his order (on April 17th), I also had him order a set 
 of tiles for me and lets just say, my stickers are starting to get 
 kinda bad.  When we saw the &#x27;news update&#x27; on Cubesmith, indicating 
 that he hoped to be caught up by 5/9, we figured we could wait a 
 while, but there hasn&#x27;t been anything else, since then.  If anyone 
 (Chris at CubeSmith included) has any updates, it would be greatly 
 appreciated - any word I can pass along would be helpful.

          <div class="email-content">Just a quick translation:
=================
www.cubelube.com

They claim that they have the exact same formular as rubiks.com.  Do
they really have the exact same stuff or is it a fake?  Also, if you
lube your cube with 100% silicone and then 2 weeks later, use Rubik&#x27;s
cube lube, will that screw your cube up?
=================

And some answers too.  Yes, it&#x27;s the same.  Both of them are floor
wax.  If I overlube my cube, I have to wipe it down with a paper towel
and it&#x27;s fine.  No lube needed afterwards.

          <div class="email-content">It is mentioned in the rulings, in the part about a cube must be
unambiguously solved.

If you pop 4 caps all in the same slice this gives your cube 2
solutions, so the cube is no longer unambiguously solved.

If you pop all 6 obviously your cube has now 12 solved positions so
the cube is no longer unambiguously solved.

If you pop 4 caps leaving 2 adjacent faces still with caps this is ok
however.

Basically cap pops work like:

1 pop) still solved
2 pops anywhere) still solved
3 pops anywhere) still solved
4 pops)
a) if all in one slice, not solved, counts as DNF
b) if not all in once slice, still solved
5 pops) not solved, DNF
6 pops) not solved, DNF

So if your caps keep popping off, and you do nothing to fix it, you may be

          <div class="email-content">I would like some input to get faster and was hoping I get some help <br>
here.<br>
<br>
I currently solve the cube by doing the 4 corners, opposite 4 corners, <br>
orient them all, fill in the edges of two opposite sides, then complete <br>
the middle slice.  I &quot;hold&quot; the cube with my left hand and preform all <br>
the moves with my right hand - not the quickest way. <br>
 <br>
I average under a minute but far from 30 seconds.  In the mid-80&#x27;s I <br>
averaged 38 seconds and had a best time of 23.  I need to either change <br>
my method or learn some finger tricks.  I don&#x27;t want to be &quot;World <br>
Class&quot; but I do want to be faster. <br>
 <br>
Any suggestions?<br>

Pedro, and everyone.

I apologize for the delay in making this available. There are multiple
shots of the WR solve, and i was hoping to get them all and weigh out
my options, but it is taking too long. So here is the first footage i
have.  Hopefully we can have more, but this is not too bad.

But as for me, I still use my first cube and after 2 years of speedcubing,
it is in a remarquably good state.

I think it all depends on the cubes you have.
If you DIY is good for you, then use it.
It not, then use another one.

It is just a matter of preferences.

          <div class="email-content">Yes, that is the scramble. If I may, how did you figure that out? All I could tell was that it was 
wrong. 

As you can see, though not lucky, it was just ridiculously easy. My solve was 117 turns, which 
feels very low. I expect to see some awesome times when everybody tries this one.

hyperlinks to Java applets. Though, if the sequence is a solution and<br>
not a generator, then you must press the reverse play button to set up<br>
the cube:<br>

<br>
Now let&#x27;s try something:<br>
<br>
Nobody will do F2L + LL in the BLD event at the US open!<br>
<br>
I wonder how that will render ;-)<br>

          <div class="email-content">The scramble didn&#x27;t seem too easy so I compared it to the cube in the
video, and noticed that it&#x27;s indeed different. Then I took some paper
and a pen and started reconstructing the position from the video. Some
faces were hard to see but it was doable. When I though I got it I
compared it to the scramble and it didn&#x27;t make any sense: it was off
by 7 edges and 4 corners. Then I checked all yellow and white
stickers, found a couple of mistakes, and finally I had the position
on paper. The difference was, as I excepted, 4 corners and 4 edges = 1
move.

Then I marked the 4 edges with stickers (like looking for insertions
in FMC) and went through the scramble to find a position where they
are all on the same face (this is were the extra move is added). All
this took 60-80 minutes I think, but it was actually quite a nice
puzzle. ;-)

Hi Gilles!

Even though I live fairly near the venue (120km) I and my brother will
probably stay at an hotel as last year. We were 6 guys that stayed at
the same place and we did quite some cubing in the evening as you can
understand. I recommend you to also come and stay at the same hotel. I
will today put a suggestion for a hotel in the center of Södertälje,
which is at walking distance from the venue, and the prices are
reasonable.

There are several non-swedes that has shown interest in the
competition already which makes me very happy. :-) One french
competitor is even registered already. Visit
http://www.student.itn.liu.se/~gunkr520/SM2007/index.html to see who
is registered so far.

Geez, make me feel bad.  I just wasted an hour of your life! I
apologize, it as after midnight when i got to that point. The only
thing i had was a screen shot of the scramble, so i had to transcribe
it.  I did check it, but i must have done the same thing that i did
while transcribing.  

I fixed it now. Thanks Johannes!

RM = right middle slice, LM = left middle slice.

So all those &quot;XM&quot;&#x27;s are sigle slices, the rest of the turns are faces 
exept for &quot;E2&quot; that, as usally, are the double E-slice (Equator).

The &quot;U&quot; is more like the the one in &quot;lube&quot; but more open, the &quot;e&quot; is 
sounding but is short, like &quot;e´&quot;, &quot;suune´&quot;

Took a check and found that &quot;Sune&quot; is from old Norse and means &quot;the 
son&quot; (definit). In modern Swedish we use the same word as the 
Englishmen &quot;son&quot;, (or rather the oppsite, they got it from the vikings 
=) The &quot;e&quot; in the end of &quot;Sune&quot; marks the definit form but today we 
say &quot;sonen&quot; = &quot;en&quot; ending instead of putting a &quot;the&quot; in front of the 
word as you do. But in some Swedish dialects you may say something 
like &quot;sona&quot;, and that is pretty close to &quot;Sune&quot; :P

exception. All 4 letters are pronounced, with the stress falling on

The Swedish &quot;u&quot; sound does not occur in English, and I don&#x27;t think it

Don&#x27;t worry about the &quot;u&quot; part. Nobody likes a pronunciation snob.

Had I had any idea this would be an internationally used term, I  
would have picked a more globally pronounceable name. Sorry about that.

Rubik&#x27;s bigcubes are definitely more stable, and potentially can be as
smooth as Eastsheens. Over time, the Eastsheen wears, making it
looser, which results (for my 5x5x5) lots of pops and cubes collapsing
on itself every so often. The same thing for the 4x4x4; Eastsheens are
nice until you have to take it apart to fix a mechanism pop or an
actual cube pop (although the latter has never happened for me).

So is USELESS -as well as LUBE , REFLEx , LUxURy , and this URL .

How many of these words are there, anyhow? I don&#x27;t know if someone&#x27;s found 
this before; unfortunately, the Yahoo search server for this group claims to 
be busy.
Anyhow, I ran the following code through Mathematica 5.1:

&lt;&lt; Miscellaneous`Dictionary`; 
Export[&quot;rubikswords.txt&quot;,StringReplace[(Select[$Dictionary,(And@@((StringMatchQ[#,&quot;U&quot;|&quot;R&quot;|&quot;F&quot;|&quot;L&quot;|&quot;B&quot;|&quot;D&quot;|&quot;M&quot;|&quot;E&quot;|&quot;S&quot;|&quot;x&quot;|&quot;y&quot;|&quot;z&quot;,IgnoreCase->True])&amp;/@Characters[#]))&amp;])//ToString,{&quot;, 
&quot;->FromCharacterCode[10],&quot;{&quot;->&quot;&quot;, &quot;}&quot;->&quot;&quot;}]]

Mathematica found 1046 c-UBEFUL RESUL -ts (this is fun!) in its dictionary:
http://archive.garron.us/data/rubikswords.txt

The longest word is the dramatic MURDERESSES .
Next-longest are BUMBLEBEES , ELDERBERRY , EMBEzzLERS , REMEMBERED , 
RUDDERLESS , and SELFLESSLY .
(Here is a length-ordered list, in case anyone is interested: 
http://archive.garron.us/data/rubikswords_len.txt)

Great implementation, by the way -a great convenience. Too bad it&#x27;s only for 
that site; I don&#x27;t like the favelet because it doesn&#x27;t work with frames, so 
it won&#x27;t even work on my own website!

Btw, this is the script I used for UNIX:

grep -i &#x27;^[lrudfbmesxyz]*$&#x27; /usr/share/dict/words

So no, I didn&#x27;t just think up the words myself, I&#x27;m actually terrible
at word games. E.g. without it I couldn&#x27;t write:

    BUFFy DRESSES SExy !

Another way is to author your website to have direct hyperlinks to
AnimCube for each sequence. This might be done by inventing a new tag,
like &lt;alg>FRF&#x27;R&#x27;&lt;/alg>, and translating it with XSLT.

Next thing I was considering for the forum was to to automatically
translate urls of images into actual (scaled down) images, and urls of
youtube videos into embedded youtube viewers.

You may have a go with ksolve. It&#x27;s a very flexible solver that was 
discussed and posted at twistypuzzles. Let me see if i can find the 
link for you ...

Good luck!! If you need help making .def file please contact me :-)

That&#x27;s quite cool, I&#x27;ll start using it. Thanks! For those who have

I believe that&#x27;s Bandelow notation (yes a german, he was one of the 
foremost &quot;cubewriters&quot; in the early 80s alongside David B. Singmaster)
Oh wait, the original Bandelow notation was more like MR and ML not 
RM and LM. Hmm ... Anyway it&#x27;s the same as the more common r and l 
nowadays (for 4x4x4 and larger) :-)

it says is that he knows which &quot;one&quot; of those combinations is the one<br>

What does that sentence even mean? That he knows which one is the
solved position? Anyway, every single article about cubing I&#x27;ve read
has contained at least one (usually more) big mistake. That&#x27;s why I
don&#x27;t read them anymore.

          <div class="email-content">Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
I registered myself 5 days ago to the forum on twisty puzzles.<br>
I knew they had to aprove my registration first but it has been 5 days, and i&#x27;m eager to post. :)<br>
I&#x27;m not mad or anything,don&#x27;t worry,but i just wondered,maybe i&#x27;ve have do re do it because of a mistake during my first registration.<br>
Or is more than 5 days normal for the aproval?<br>
If so, i&#x27;ll be happy to wait untill it&#x27;s done.<br>
<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey Ridhard,

There was one time I got a nasty gash in my index and pinky fingers
(rusty metal). Took the longest time to heal, and I think it might
have slowed me down a little, but not too much.

Also, before either Rutgers or Cornell I hyperextended my right thumb.
That made it very hard to do practically anything for a while. Luckily
it wasn&#x27;t that bad and the doctors said it would just go away.
Luckily, it had no affect on my cubing. The positions I use to hold
the cube didn&#x27;t make it hurt. 

Pretty much, don&#x27;t be too worried about hurting your self before the
competition. If its going to happen, its going to happen. Unless you
can&#x27;t physically cube, or cubing would make the problem worse, I would
just deal with any problem that you might have. Hey, it worked for me. :)

Hope that helps!
-Peter Greenwood

Either the admin is too busy or he thought something like &quot;johnl583&quot; 
looks like the typical spammer. I recommend using your real name (in 
general, btw, not just for that forum).

          <div class="email-content">Darn. That was always a good, fun and well-attended tournament (both 
in terms of competitors and in terms of audience).

And they had webcast facilities - I was looking forward to trying to 
do a webcast in 2008.

The Tech sounds like a good candidate. Other Bay Area places could 
be: Stanford, Berkeley, the Sony Metreon in SF.

Hi Federico =)

At Lars Vandenbergh&#x27;s COLL page there are little images showing the 
colour shemes along with the algs, take a look at:

          <div class="email-content">About 3 weeks ago, I was backing out of a parking space downtown (one 
way street), and nobody was behind me until I got fully backed out, 
then I spotted someone coming at me fast.  Having a 5 speed 
transmission, my hand quickly jumped from the wheel to the gearshift 
and in the process I slightly (very slightly) sprained my wrist.  
Luckily the guy went around me but he gave me a scare.

It has hindered my times a bit... I&#x27;m off by a couple seconds, but 
fortunately the wrist does seem to be improving.  I notice it most on 
slice turns (like H perm - M2&#x27; U M2 U2&#x27; M2&#x27; U M2).

Cube-21 is the English counterpart to the American Square-1.
This is my understanding.
There are no funtional differences to my knowledge.

The first difference you can see from the website is their weight.
The cheaper one is lighter.

I will compare it to my &quot;real&quot; Square-1 to see the difference.

Just before SOC 2005 one of the better Swedish guys at the time 
(Fredric Forsman) badly injured his right hand twice in the same day 
(two days before his first ever competiton). He showed up at the 
contest anyway an helpt out with things (many thanks for that 
Fredric) but could not compeat. His hand was so swollen it was almost 
compleatly round.

Worst thing was that he almost quit cubing after that, and has not 
compeated either.

The first difference you can see from the website is their weight.
The cheaper one is lighter.

I will compare it to my &quot;real&quot; Square-1 to see the difference.

Look-ahead:  Try going really slow and not stopping.  So while you&#x27;re 
inserting one pair, be looking for the next.  Then practice that with 
a metronome.

And, of course (as you predicted), practice, practice, practice

Seriously, the cheaper one will probably be of a much poorer quality. But
the price increase to have a quality cube is about 1000%.
So you need to balance between the high price and if you really want to have
a good cube21 or if &quot;just a cube21&quot; is good enough.

I really dislike the sluggish registration process at TP (Twisty 
Puzzles). Luckily i registered ages ago, when there was easy fast 
automatic registration ;) Personally i don&#x27;t think this slowness can 
be justified from an antispam perspective. I would prefer a smarter 
automatic registration process instead of slow manual one :D

Got an answer. He said most likely you used a name like that plus an 
unrelated email and no further details, and that most spambots do it 
like that. He added that a registration has to be very obvious to get 
through, because he now gets about 150 each week and only about 4 of 
them are real.

Cheers!

Hey Bob,

On your experiences page, the &quot;Captian Cove&quot; links to the canadian

It sounds like a good place for a competiton!

          <div class="email-content">Hi Michael,

I must say that I don&#x27;t like his 2x2, it is extremely loose and feels 
unstable, but in his hands the cube looks like the extension of his fingers.

Lukasz uses a combination of systems. This is what I understood when talking 
to him at Polish Open 2006.
1) first layer, second layer
2) 3 pieces of first layer, rest of the cube
3) bring together all 4 pieces of first layer (correctly oriented), second 
layer including permutation first layer
In worst case he does not know the LL case of either of the 3, I think he 
uses 2) but then takes 3 steps.
In best case he can actually see the whole solve ahead, often a 2) case.

Have fun,

Ron

Yes. Just go faster.
Don&#x27;t my step 2 sequences and tips work?

If you need more, try to look for &quot;roux tutorial&quot; on Youtube. There
are some well commented videos by Richard Meyer that could be helpful.

On the news page of your site you say there is a 9 move alg for the Y<br>

&gt; unstable, but in his hands the cube looks like the extension of his<br>
fingers.<br>
<br>
That&#x27;s interesting to hear. At the most recent competition, people<br>
were telling me that my 3x3x3 cube was too loose, felt like it was<br>
about to pop, and so on, but it felt completely fine to me. I suppose<br>
you can get used to any cube if you use it for long enough...<br>
<br>
&gt; Lukasz uses a combination of systems. This is what I understood when<br>
talking <br>
&gt; to him at Polish Open 2006.<br>
&gt; 1) first layer, second layer<br>
&gt; 2) 3 pieces of first layer, rest of the cube<br>
&gt; 3) bring together all 4 pieces of first layer (correctly oriented),<br>
second <br>
&gt; layer including permutation first layer<br>
&gt; In worst case he does not know the LL case of either of the 3, I<br>
think he <br>
&gt; uses 2) but then takes 3 steps.<br>
&gt; In best case he can actually see the whole solve ahead, often a 2) case.<br>
<br>
So he decides what method to use, and figures it out completely during<br>
inspection? And each method is a two-step method? That must take a ton<br>
of algorithms... I think 3) is the EG method and I can&#x27;t recognize 2),<br>
 but to be able to do all of those methods optimally, Lukasz would<br>
probably have to know 150 or more move sequences. That&#x27;s amazing.<br>

I remember there was a scramble at the US Nationals &#x27;06 that had D2 (R B&#x27;

unofficially not?

I&#x27;m not going to find them now, but maybe we should compute probabilites for

I really don&#x27;t like the great advantage of easy solves. Something like

Well, for blindfold it&#x27;s relatively easy to make not-too-easy<br>
scrambles... there are a very limited number of solving strategies<br>
(unlike on a normal cube, where a Fridrich solver could do the same<br>
cube many different ways), so you could randomly or algorithmically<br>
construct cube positions with the properties of being about average<br>
difficulty (4-8 edges flipped, for example) for every main solving<br>
strategy, and then constructing a scramble when they are found.<br>
<br>
But maybe a simpler solution would be to have everyone do 3 solves,<br>
and compare people&#x27;s &quot;Mean of 3&quot; averages. That would encourage higher<br>
consistency as well!<br>

Since 4-8 flipped edges are extremely unusual for my solving 
strategy, this implies you think it&#x27;s not a main one. Grrr...

          <div class="email-content">well that is just the thing.  a scramble might be easier for one
solving system but harder for another.  there isn&#x27;t really any way, I
think, to deduce whether or not a scramble is inherently &quot;easier&quot; than
another scramble for blindfold solving simply because people use
different methods.  even for a regular speedsolve, people solve it
differently and therefore can achieve radically different times, even
if they possess comparable handspeed and pattern recognition abilities.

this sort of thing is much different from something like track, where
the track doesn&#x27;t really change much (unless you count weather
conditions and the like).  it&#x27;s the same for everyone.  cubing is much
different due to the fact that you get a new scramble every time and
people have different ways of getting to the goal (again, consider
track.  you aren&#x27;t going to see some idiot running across the middle
of the field in order to get ahead of everyone running ON the track).

if someone gets a 3:40 mile, you can&#x27;t deduce that as &quot;lucky&quot; like you
can say a solve is lucky.  however, as long as everyone has access to
the same scrambles, then it&#x27;s technically fair.

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

UWR&#x27;s just serve an entirely different purpose from OWRs that&#x27;s all. 
I don&#x27;t see any problems with it. People can read into them what they 
like. Everyone knows that hard recognition is earned in official 
competitions like for any other sport.

I particularly acknowledge that the UWR&#x27;s is a great opportunity to 
post their results also for those who are not able to participate 
officially for some reason. Whether the lists should only contain 
recent results is another matter. The lists should reflect current 
capabilities :-)

Also minesweeping has extensive UWR lists, and probably other 
gamelike activities also. I don&#x27;t think (speed)cubing is really that 
unique in this respect ;-)

My 2 cents.

That&#x27;s not really true; it&#x27;s more that I don&#x27;t use your method and<br>
therefore am more likely to think of cases in terms of my method.<br>
You&#x27;re right, though, I should have noted that that case was for the<br>
3-cycle method (and said &#x27;badly oriented&#x27; instead of &#x27;flipped&#x27;).<br>
<br>
By the way, what counts as lucky with your system? Would it only be<br>
edges/corners that are in the right place and position?<br>

          <div class="email-content">There was a discussion a while ago about only taking scrambles that 
were sufficiently hard (the idea of only taking scrambles at least x 
moves away from solved came up) and then and now I fully believe that 
this should not be the system.  By setting limits like x moves away 
from solved, we&#x27;re not doing anything.  Nobody uses god&#x27;s algorithm.  
And in some sense, we&#x27;re being biased against that method (if 
somebody knew god&#x27;s algorithm, they&#x27;d never have lucky or easy 
cases).  Any limitation makes one method favorable to another, or one 
method less favorable than others.  If you find a way of making non-
lucky/easy scrambles that doesn&#x27;t favor any method, real or 
theoretical, let me know.

Setting limitations like &quot;only 4-8 edges flipped&quot; bothers me.  
Officially choosing one way of solving and picking only hard 
scrambles for that method is ridiculous.  I don&#x27;t care that a vast 
majority of speedcubers use a certain method.  Changing the rules so 
that it&#x27;s not as perfectly random as is possible given current 
technological limitations is going to inherently favor one method 
over another.

An issue specific to &quot;4-8 edges flipped&quot; is that it gives cubers too 
much information.  (I&#x27;m referring to the definition of orientation 
where edges can be solved with U,D,F,B,R2,L2 for illustration).  It&#x27;s 
well-known that an odd number of edges on a cube can&#x27;t be flipped 
unless there&#x27;s some foul play going on.  So you only need to look at 
11 of the 12 edges to figure out the orientation.  If you have 
checked 11 edges and there are 3 flipped, you know that the last one 
is flipped.  That&#x27;s fine, because it&#x27;s true with any scrambling 
method.  However, if you know that none of the first eight are 
flipped, there&#x27;s no reason to believe that any orientation of the 
remaining eight edges is any more likely than any other.  But if you 
know that only eight edges can be flipped, you can deduce that all of 
the remaining four are oriented correctly.  That&#x27;s not okay; you 
wouldn&#x27;t have that knowledge outside the competition.  Worse, this 
only gives information to cubers who use that specific definition of 
orientation.

In short, I&#x27;m strongly against any method of picking scrambles which 
disallows any position.  I personally think we should switch to 
something along the lines of CubeExplorer&#x27;s way of picking a random 
position, then finding a scramble for it.

          <div class="email-content">About everything:
I do acknowlegde that specific scramble restrictions are hsrd to handle.
For one,  EO (3-cycle method) is highly subjective; I would prefer a 
superflip (or a 10-flip) to a bad 6-flip. It depends on what algs I notice I 
can use.
Easy CO, for me, though I can deal with hard scrambles well, depends on 
getting nice cases, but that varies for others by method and orientation for 
memo&amp;exec.

However, I think that a measure of the following is reasonable:
-Edges placed
-Corners placed
-Number of edge cycles
-Number of corner cycles

 We could require that it not be too &quot;easy&quot; in more than one of these 
categories. I&#x27;d say:
&lt;4 or >8 edge cycles (counting those of length 1)
&lt;3 or >5 corner cycles (counting those of length 1)
>3 edges placed
>3 cornes placed

If I calculated correctly, almost exactly 8/9 of all cube states follow at 
least 3 conditions (the issue of scrambles being random is a different 
issue, but not greatly influential).

Of course, some stuff isn&#x27;t covered (such as if there are four 3-edge cycles 
nicely set up), but it could weed out some uneven scrambles in the future. 
And no competitor will be able to use knowledge of these rules to very much 
of their advantage; it&#x27;s probably better to practice more...
The only problem would  be in getting judges to follow this, and trusting 
them to do it correctly (and making sure they know how). Any such apathy 
ruins that, and even if there&#x27;s a WCA delegate present, someone could 
probably convince others with &quot;it normally won&#x27;t make a difference.&quot; Most 
scramblers who could check this would proably be competing in BLD, too...
And if only one person insists on following the rules, she/he gets called 
all sorts of things...

Does this still seem unreasonable to anyone?

          <div class="email-content">well, i don&#x27;t think anything is going to change
as long as the scrambles are sufficiently random, i think that&#x27;s the
best that can be done.  however, while i have never competed (and so i
don&#x27;t know the rules fully), i think anyone competing should have the
chance to cube with the same scramble as another as long as, perhaps,
the scrambles are given in different orders in order to avoid
cheating.  therefore you can&#x27;t ever get any arguments such as &quot;i never
get any easy scrambles like he did/i always get hard scrambles!&quot;
because everyone competing would have gone through the same scrambles
at the end of the day.  

i think allowing person A exclusive access to scramble X is not fair,
and it is this way in any sport (i play many solo-player-oriented
sports, and they all attempt to make it so everyone has a fair shot at
the same conditions.  if the same conditions cannot be met EXACTLY,
then comparable conditions must be substituted).  Person B should also
have access to scramble X.  anyone who disagrees with this, i feel,
simply is unable to figure out how to enforce anti-cheating guidelines
(eg. if person A has information about scramble X, he cannot tell
person B a thing about that scramble.  likewise, person B cannot
observe person A solving scramble X).

i think the best that can be done to determine what is &quot;lucky&quot; would
be to first run many trials to determine average times given certain
cube cases (eg. cycle lengths, completed pieces, etc).  then,
determine what is statistically significant in order to derive the
conditions for what is lucky.  in order to account for any solving
system, lucky pieces would have to be fully-solved pieces
(oriented/permuted correctly), although this could be debatable.

That&#x27;s why &quot;blatantly lucky&quot; is a difficult term.  And don&#x27;t say that

I assume you were referring to 3x3 speedsolve, since a 2x2x2 block 
isn&#x27;t lucky in 3x3 BLD, unless other pieces are solved.

Lucas:  To play the devil&#x27;s advocate, in Stefan&#x27;s method, having a 
piece in place but twisted is no better than having it out of place 
in terms of algorithms.  In fact, in Stefan&#x27;s method&#x27;s purest form, a 
piece in place but twisted takes more algorithms to solve.  Direct 
solving methods do not benefit from having pieces in place but 
twisted.  So an outright limitation on the number of pieces in place 
would, again, be unfair.  If we were to say pieces in place, oriented 
correctly...well, I seem to remember from my days of using Pochmann 
that having the edge in my buffer position solved made it take more 
algorithms.  So starting out with that edge or corner solved (or at 
least permuted) actually made it more difficult to solve.

In response to your last comment, Michael, I think that many people 
would argue that the average record is a much better reflection of 
that.  It&#x27;s really impossible to eliminate all luck from contests; 
there&#x27;s absolutely no way to eliminate luck on the LL.  Averages 
neutralize some of the chance of getting lucky, which is why many 
people consider Gungz&#x27;s 11.76 average a better indication of speed 
than Thibaut&#x27;s 9.86 or Dan&#x27;s 10.08 single solve.

I was referring to 3x3 BLD. A 2x2x2 block by necessity includes three<br>
centers, and I can&#x27;t imagine a fast blindfold system where pieces that<br>
are in the right place and properly oriented will be a hindrance. So a<br>
2x2x2 block in 3x3x3 BLD would mean that three edges and one corner<br>
are already done. So I would consider it blatantly lucky, in the<br>
blindfold event. In the speedsolve event, a block like that is very<br>
nice, but not necessarily equally lucky for everyone (although, in<br>
your example, a corners-first person can, in theory, solve the corners<br>
while keeping the block totally intact, and then be left with three<br>
good edges).<br>

<br>
I agree completely. It is, of course, possible to have a very good<br>
average (especially when only 2/5 solves in a tournament need to be<br>
lucky for an average to be affected - and don&#x27;t forget Harris&#x27;s<br>
unofficial 10.46), but it&#x27;s much less likely.<br>
<br>
But the problem with BLD is that it&#x27;s hard to even take an average.<br>
Some people are very consistent, but others DNF most or all of the<br>
time even when they are good at the event, and most people are so slow<br>
at blindfolded solving that giving them five solves would seriously<br>
hinder a competition. I&#x27;d love it if we could consider averages in the<br>
blindfold event, but it would be somewhat impractical in a competition.<br>

Again, what is average would most likely be very closely related to 
what 3-cycle orient-then-permute people do, as that is what a 
majority of cubers seem to use (forgive me if that is incorrect, but 
from my observations, that seems to be true).

This is probably my last post tonight, so I&#x27;ll just say this: Any 
method for eliminating certain scrambles is going to favor one method 
over another.  With a perfectly random scramble, everyone has the 
same opportunity to get a good scramble on each scramble.  Clearly, 
this favors people who compete a lot, since they get more 
opportunities to get good scrambles.  I don&#x27;t see any way around this 
barrier.  My view is that scrambles should be made with no knowledge 
of what is easy and what is hard, as that is entirely subjective and 
varies from person to person.

Blatantly lucky?  Not so.  At least not by the current definition:
>For blindfold solving a lucky case is defined by:

>2) more than 8 edges are correctly oriented, or
>3) more than 3 corners are correctly positioned, or

A 2x2x2 block has one corner correctly positioned and oriented, and 
three edges correctly positioned and oriented.  So it&#x27;s not lucky by 
the current definition on speedcubing.com

Yes, but that&#x27;s not part of their method.  If, when you get to LL, 
all the pieces are in their place but not oriented, and you do OLL 
before PLL, the &quot;luck&quot; that you had is gone.  Yet that would be lucky 
for people who do PLL then OLL (which is, I admit, a small if 
existent group of people).  It is a similar situation here.  If you 
use a cross-F2L method, and you have no experience in preserving 
corner-edge pairs while making the cross, it would slow you down so 
that the time saved from an easy insertion would not be worth it.  
This is a similar case: CF solvers have no reason to practice 
preserving a 2x2 block, as it generally does them no good.

          <div class="email-content">I find that the probability of *exactly* three edges in the correct
place with the correct flip, and in addition *exactly* 1 corner in the
correct place with the correct flip is:

220*[9!*(2^8-2^7+2^6/2!-2^5/3!+2^4/4!-2^3/5!+2^2/6!-2^1/7!+1/8!-1/9!)]*8*(1/2)*[7!*(3^6-3^5+3^4/2!-3^3/3!+3^2/4!-3^1/5!+1/6!-1/7!)]/43252003274489856000

Which comes out to:
220 * 56345048 * 8 * (1/2) * 2632650 / 43252003274489856000

or 0.3% chance of occurence.  So yes I agree this is a bit lucky.

And Gunnar was well aware that I also was using the method when you 
guys started =P

I always refered to it as Lukasz method.

I can&#x27;t recommend it. It takes to much to remember all those algs. 
Nowdays I solve the first layer and then use CLL. Not as fast because 
of the more complex first step but good enough for me.

          <div class="email-content">Lucky is not the same as improbable. Having all pieces out of place
and oriented incorrectly has extremely low chance of occurence, but
that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a lucky case.

The mistake you made is that having 3 edges solved is just as easy as
having 3 edges permuted and 3 *other* edges oriented, which isn&#x27;t that
rare. (I&#x27;m only talking about orient first approach here, for direct
solvers having 4 pieces solved *could* be an easy case, but it depends
on the details of the method.)

I would not say that.. I taught some people to solve the cube who
would probably have given up very soon if they just had some website
and no one who gives personal advise..

I am sure there are some people in your area who would help you get
started (but I am also sure most of them would not take any money for
it!) ;-)

Just try Jasmines Method like Dan said, if you have problems
understanding it, dont worry, just ask (but try to understand it on
your own first!)

          <div class="email-content">Hi Brad,

If you live in the neighborhood of Chicago, just come to the US Open 2007
(http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/c.php?i=USOpen2007) and I will
teach you (for free) in person. As for being too oldï¿½ï¿½. Grada Ooms is over
60 and just started cubing recently. She did a 1:44.18 3x3x3 solve at the
Italian Open.

I hope to see you there,

It depends, if you apply the superflip to flip all the edges, and you
know an algorithm for all 86 cases where every single corner is
incorrectly twisted, then I would in fact consider this a lucky case.
 True it is not as lucky as all edges and all corners correctly
oriented, but it would still be much easier to memorize a case like
this than most cases, even if it isn&#x27;t as easy to memorize as no
flipped pieces at all.

I specifically mentioned that I was finding the chance of 3 edges
correctly permuted and correctly oriented, in addition to 1 corner
correctly permuted and correctly oriented.  The way I figured this
does still allow for other edges and corners to be permuted (but not
oriented), and also for other edges and corners to be not permuted but
correctly oriented.

I wanted to find the probability for a general 2x2x2 being built after
the scramble since that is the case that was mentioned to be very
lucky.  I didn&#x27;t want to restrict to just a 2x2x2 block, but rather
it&#x27;s components of 3 edges and 1 corner placed anywhere on the cube.

Also I don&#x27;t agree with this statement:

I interpret this to mean that 3 edges are correctly permuted, but
incorrectly flipped, and 3 other edges are not permuted, but correctly
flipped.  I disagree that this is just as easy as three edges that are
both correctly permuted and correctly flipped.  For the case where 3
edges are both correctly permuted and correctly flipped you not only
don&#x27;t have to memorize those pieces at all, but you also don&#x27;t have to
perform any sort of algorithm to affect those pieces.

For your case, if I am interpretting this correctly, you would have to
memorize all 3 edges that are correctly permuted but incorrectly
flipped so that you could flip them later.  Also you would have to
memorize the 3 edges that are flipped correctly but not permuted so
you could permute them later.  I don&#x27;t agree that this is equally as
easy as the case where 3 edges are both correctly permuted and
correctly oriented.

So having three edges correctly permuted and correctly flipped, as
well as 1 corner correctly permuted and correctly flipped, and no
other piece on the cube that is both correctly permuted and correctly
flipped, I maintain is fairly rare at about 0.3% chance of occurence.

I also maintain that this case is significantly easier to both
memorize and solve than 3 edges that are correctly permuted but
incorrectly flipped and 3 other edges that are not permuted but
correctly flipped (and the same idea for the 1 corner).

this is what was sccuber&#x27;s point in message #36030, the one you<br>

That&#x27;s a very good point, I guess I didn&#x27;t think of it in those terms.<br>
 Daniel Beyer has recently convinced me to switch away from orient<br>
first over to a direct solving method using a buffer piece, so now I<br>
no longer view pieces as having a &quot;flip&quot; or &quot;twist&quot; at all unless they<br>
are correctly permuted but incorrectly twisted.  Otherwise the concept<br>
of &quot;flip&quot; doesn&#x27;t really come up in the same way that it does for<br>
orient first.<br>
<br>
But yes I can see that, viewing the permutation and orientation as<br>
completely separate and independent parts of the solve then yes I can<br>
see how 3 edges permuted, and three other edges correctly flipped,<br>
could in some cases be just as easy if not easier than 3 edges both<br>
correctly permuted and correctly solved.<br>
<br>
Still though, notice how three edges correctly permuted and correctly<br>
solved, even for an orient first method, are still three edges you can<br>
completely ignore.  So in a sense this case would sometimes still be<br>
easier for orient first.  This is because having those 3 edges solved<br>
effectively reduces your cube to a 9 piece edge orbit, which should<br>
nearly always be easier to memorize and solve than a 12 piece orbit. <br>
The same applies for 1 corner solved recuding the corners to a 7 piece<br>
orbit.<br>
<br>
So I guess it probably only minutely helps an orient first solver to<br>
have 3 pieces completely solved vs. 3 pieces permuted and 3 separate<br>
pieces oriented.  But yes for direct solving having three pieces<br>
completely solved is a *huge* advantage both for memorizing and solving.<br>

I use a variation of Stefan Pochmann&#x27;s method mixed with my big cube
blindfolded method.  I memorize the cube exactly as Stefan&#x27;s method
would, but I solve using freestyle commutators instead of 2 cycles.  I
often solve 2 pieces with each commutator.  When you have to &quot;break
into&quot; a new cycle though you would only solve one piece with that
commutator.  This is balanced in the end though by solving two pieces,
plus the buffer, with the final commutator.

So I would say overall I average 10 moves to solve 2 pieces, or 5
moves per piece solved.  Over the whole solve that&#x27;s roughly 100 moves
+- a few turns because of setup moves potentially being very easy or
very hard for a certain solve.

I haven&#x27;t yet been able to make this method faster than orient first
when actually used on the 3x3x3, but my times are still improving. 
This method is already significantly faster when used on the big cubes
than my orient first approach.  This is because orientation algs on
the big cubes, which I need to be super-cube safe because of when I
orient during the solve, are terribly long.

I don&#x27;t know if this method will be faster for the 3x3x3 than orient
first (for me) but it is already better for the bigger cubes which is
why I use it.

Yeah only the centralmost edges of a 5x5x5 cube, and corners on both
cubes have orientations.

As for orient first vs. direct solving on a bigger cube consider my
centralmost edge orientation algs:

orient the 4 centralmost edges of the U layer of a 5x5x5:
R&#x27; e&#x27; R2 e2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R&#x27; e&#x27; R2 e2 R&#x27; U&#x27; R e2 R2 e R U&#x27; R e2 R2 e R U&#x27;

orient the 4 central most edges of the e layer:
R F&#x27; U R&#x27; F e R F&#x27; U R&#x27; F e F&#x27; R U&#x27; F R&#x27; e F&#x27; R U&#x27; F R&#x27; e

I also found this alg which is faster to execute, but still a very
long alg.

Orient ULs, URs, FRe, BRe:
e&#x27; R e&#x27; R e&#x27; R2 e R e R e R2 F&#x27; B U B&#x27; F e&#x27; R e&#x27; R e&#x27; R2 e R e R e R2
F&#x27; B U&#x27; B&#x27; F

Now compare that to the example of a typical commutator which solves
both the position and orientation of 2 centralmost edges at once:
R&#x27; e R U2 R&#x27; e&#x27; R U2

It&#x27;s really not a hard decision as to which method to use on a bigger
cube BLD ;-)

Now as for the 3x3x3 cube that&#x27;s a whole other story.  I just did a
couple 3x3x3 BLD solves using the buffer method for memorization and
freestyle commutators for solving and my best was a 1:50.60. 
Memorization took me 1:08 so the solving phase then took me about 42
seconds.  My best solves with this method right now are mid to low
1:50&#x27;s, but my best solves with orient first are sub-1:40, so orient
first is still faster for me.  I know I can speed up my memory for the
buffer method by training myself not to sub-vocalize my images during
memorization, and also I can work on quicker image recall in general.
 My main interest are the bigger cubes though.  If working on the
bigger cubes speeds up my 3x3x3 then that&#x27;s cool, but really I just
work on the bigger cubes.

I&#x27;m like Daniel Beyer, I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the bigger cubes BLD
and I don&#x27;t care as much for 3x3x3 BLD as I used to :-P  Take a look
at my results from Chattahoochee 2007 in the 3x3x3 BLD category to see
what I mean ;-)

Dan, maybe my 10 move T then:

l2 d&#x27; R2 d l2 (y&#x27;) r2 d L2 d&#x27; r2

I can do it pretty fast exept for the orientation and grip-shift in the 
middle. Hold the cube at URF and URB corners using right thumb and 
index in the first part and mirror the grip in left for the second 
part. That way you can do the turns witout changing grip more than 
once. d-turns you do by pushing at the RB (using right hand) and LB 
(left hand) edges using some free finger.

Hi, hi, I know :P

Thing is, I use a lot of d-turns in F2L so I&#x27;m really used to it and 
loves to do triggers like (R&#x27; d R&#x27;).

That last one I use in my favorite ZB-F2L: (R d&#x27; R) U (R&#x27; d R&#x27;), also 
(R d&#x27; R) U2 (R&#x27; d R&#x27;)

I do mirrors also, in L of course =)

Looks somewhat like the 11 move one that has been on speedcubing.com 
for years, just without the preceding U move.

Hmm, so you say if something has a 0.3% (or lower, I guess?) chance 
of occurence, it&#x27;s lucky? Then *every single cube state* is lucky, 
because every one of them has an even much lower chance of occurence!

I know. That&#x27;s what I actually meant.

Depends. Like Tim already said, one old/obsolete way of my method to 
orient a piece in place was to get it into the buffer with one alg 
and bring it back oriented correctly with another alg. So a piece in 
the &quot;correct place&quot; but bad orientation used to be my worst case. 
Nowadays I use an alg that orients one piece (along with the buffer) 
so the case isn&#x27;t as bad anymore, but about the same as any other. 
However if you add an orient-first step to the beginning of my method 
and make that a regular phase of the method, then the case turns into 
an easy one. However, I don&#x27;t do that. So yes, for me lucky only 
means correct place and orientation (I guess that&#x27;s what you meant 
when you wrote &quot;place and position&quot;). And like Tim also pointed out, 
the buffer piece being solved actually doesn&#x27;t help me at all and is 
more bad than lucky.

Cheers!
Stefan

Dude, you don&#x27;t need a &quot;lucky scramble&quot; in order to get lucky. One 
day one of the really fast guys will get a LL skip and you&#x27;ll have 
the same sitiation. Get over it.

Still, though, what if the entire F2L is less than 10 moves long?<br>
Then, even if you don&#x27;t have a skip, many people will be able to see<br>
that the F2L is that quick, and then do the F2L within 4 seconds or<br>
so. For some solvers, at least, this would be a lucky scramble.<br>
<br>
Basically, I would have no problem if a WR was set with an LL skip,<br>
because I have a chance of getting a LL skip at my next competition.<br>
But I wouldn&#x27;t like it if someone set a WR with a lucky scramble,<br>
because then I know that before the event at my next competition, a<br>
computer would have already decided whether I am allowed to get luck<br>
like that, and if the computer says I can&#x27;t then I would not have the<br>
same chance at a good time.<br>
<br>
I guess my point is that on the 3x3x3 - or any bigger cube - it<br>
requires luck for a skip near the end, but a good scramble for a skip<br>
near the beginning. And you can have the same luck in any competition,<br>
but you can&#x27;t have the same lucky scramble in any competition.<br>
Scrambles are predetermined, so before you even go up to solve the<br>
cube it&#x27;s decided whether you will be lucky or not. That strikes me as<br>
somewhat unfair to the people who don&#x27;t ever get to solve that scramble.<br>
<br>
For example - at the Captain&#x27;s Cove competition, the first 5x5x5<br>
scramble had what I&#x27;d consider a lucky center, where the entire thing<br>
could be very easily solved in about 5 moves. Everyone in the<br>
competition who used a reduction method had that lucky center, so it&#x27;s<br>
an unfair advantage to the people who happened to compete there. If<br>
someone happened to set a WR using that scramble (it probably saved<br>
about 5 seconds, which could mean a new single solve WR for one of the<br>
sub-2 guys), they had predetermined luck, and I&#x27;d say that that&#x27;s a<br>
little unfair to others who couldn&#x27;t or didn&#x27;t go to that competition.<br>
<br>
Besides, even if it doesn&#x27;t affect 5x5x5 solves that much, whether a<br>
scramble is lucky can be very important on 2x2x2 (if you can see the<br>
whole solve during inspection, and one step is skipped, it will by<br>
necessity be extremely fast) and 3x3x3-blindfold (if pieces are<br>
already solved, memorization will be easier and execution will be faster).<br>

<br>
So, it&#x27;s an easy F2L.  Big deal.  Laws of probability say that has to <br>
happen sometime.  Also, as I have said many times, we&#x27;re assuming a <br>
world in which everyone uses an F2L method.  A 10-move F2L, for CF <br>
people, is not very good.  On corners, you should usually be able to <br>
get the first four corners in less than 10 moves anyway.  So a 10-<br>
move F2L doesn&#x27;t really help everyone equally.<br>
<br>
&gt; Basically, I would have no problem if a WR was set with an LL skip,<br>

the<br>
&gt; same chance at a good time.<br>
But you have the same chance of that good scramble as anybody else at <br>
any given competition.  They both boil down to luck, easy scrambles <br>
and lucky LL&#x27;s.<br>
<br>
&gt; I guess my point is that on the 3x3x3 - or any bigger cube - it<br>
&gt; requires luck for a skip near the end, but a good scramble for a <br>
skip<br>
&gt; near the beginning. And you can have the same luck in any <br>
competition,<br>
&gt; but you can&#x27;t have the same lucky scramble in any competition.<br>
<br>
Can&#x27;t you?<br>
<br>
&gt; Scrambles are predetermined, so before you even go up to solve the<br>
&gt; cube it&#x27;s decided whether you will be lucky or not. That strikes me <br>
as<br>
&gt; somewhat unfair to the people who don&#x27;t ever get to solve that <br>
scramble.<br>
<br>
Is it more unfair than if someone does a really efficient F2L and <br>
gets ugly LL cases while another person does a less efficient F2L <br>
and, completely by chance, gets an LL skip?  They both boil down to <br>
luck.<br>
<br>
&gt; For example - at the Captain&#x27;s Cove competition, the first 5x5x5<br>
&gt; scramble had what I&#x27;d consider a lucky center, where the entire <br>
thing<br>
&gt; could be very easily solved in about 5 moves. Everyone in the<br>

&gt; little unfair to others who couldn&#x27;t or didn&#x27;t go to that <br>
competition.<br>
<br>
This brings up another point.  I didn&#x27;t see that 5-move center (at <br>
least I don&#x27;t remember seeing it).  Granted, I&#x27;m terribly out of <br>
practice on the 5x5.  But it requires some skill to see and plan out <br>
stuff.  In block-building, you can&#x27;t capitalize on luck unless you&#x27;re <br>
good at block-building.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Besides, even if it doesn&#x27;t affect 5x5x5 solves that much, whether a<br>
&gt; scramble is lucky can be very important on 2x2x2 (if you can see the<br>
&gt; whole solve during inspection, and one step is skipped, it will by<br>
&gt; necessity be extremely fast) and 3x3x3-blindfold (if pieces are<br>
&gt; already solved, memorization will be easier and execution will be <br>
faster).<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
What do you want to do about 2x2?  Take Anthony Hsu&#x27;s WR single.  A 3-<br>
move layer, then a sune (unless I&#x27;m mistaken).  Is that lucky?  Yes, <br>
it was a PLL skip.  Can you control that?  No.  What can you <br>
control?  Easy first layers?  That&#x27;s basically it.  Will that reduce <br>
the number of lucky solves drastically?  Probably not.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;ve given my views on blindfold already, I don&#x27;t feel the need to do <br>
so again.<br>

          <div class="email-content">&gt; &gt; or 0.3% chance of occurence.  So yes I agree this is a bit lucky.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Chris<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Hmm, so you say if something has a 0.3% (or lower, I guess?) chance <br>
&gt; of occurence, it&#x27;s lucky? Then *every single cube state* is lucky, <br>
&gt; because every one of them has an even much lower chance of &gt;occurence!<br>
<br>
If we&#x27;re really going to get into the semantics of this, then yes:  I<br>
do in fact consider ever single position on the cube to be a lucky<br>
case.  The chances of you seeing any random position on the cube are<br>
astronomically small.  Except for cases like 1 move away from solved<br>
which come up more often for us because of how we scramble the cube<br>
from a solved state you may not ever see any one given cube state in<br>
your lifetime.  There are probably cube states that have never been<br>
realized on all the cubes that have ever been scrambled since the cube<br>
was invented.<br>
<br>
I was applying my subjective opinion of what constitutes luck when<br>
comparing that 0.3% chance to other probabilities that occur in the<br>
solving methods with which I have experience.  Apparently we disagree<br>
on whether or not that case is lucky.<br>
<br>
I could also have chosen to take the complete opposite stance in my<br>
original post.  The chance that you get three edges both correctly<br>
permuted and oriented, and also the same for one corner, are so<br>
astronomically *huge* when compared to the chance of seeing any one<br>
particular cube state out of the total 43252003274489856000 as to be<br>
completely boring and common place.<br>
<br>
In fact I could also argue this about a LL skip in Fridrich solving. <br>
1/15552 is so much more likely of a probability than<br>
1/43252003274489856000 that I can subjectively consider it not only<br>
common place, but boringly common place.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t however do that.  I choose to consider a LL skip a lucky case.<br>
<br>
Luck is not mathematically defined, as far as I know, so obviously we<br>
will all have disagreements on what is lucky and what is not.  I could<br>
always compare any uncommon occurence or small probability to the<br>
probability of quantum tunneling through my front door in the morning<br>
on the way to work.  This would effectively make nearly any<br>
probability appear common place and boring.  I don&#x27;t think this would<br>
get anybody anywhere though.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Maybe it is a higher quality Square-1. The only difference I really
see is that it is a Czech cube, so it is not unlike what Studio Cubes
are to ordinary Rubik&#x27;s Cubes. If you are looking to buy one, though,
I would stick with a DIY; DIYs are the best Square-1&#x27;s I&#x27;ve
encountered so far.

Do you want to collect money and invest it in order to pay for trips with

Ok, I found it by doing the first five turns and then I looked for a 
diffrent way back from there. Then I found the second part (mirror of 
first).

Or you could just say that luck for us means
1) skipping a step AND
2) the skip probability being below some agreed upon threshold.
With that, you wouldn&#x27;t have to call every single cube state lucky.

What I actually meant to say is something slightly different, more 
general, though. Namely that looking at the raw occurence probability 
of a set of cube states something isn&#x27;t enough. You need to see it in 
context, particularly relative to a cuber&#x27;s method and the algs he 
knows.

Hi!

I guess I&#x27;m fairly fast with my 1:10.07 average. My fastest timet
centers+edges is 31.x, but my best times for centers and edges
separated are:

center: 10.47
edges: 17.68

It&#x27;s the 3x3-step that slows my down. My average for this step
excluding parities is around 23s, which is way to much.

          <div class="email-content">The lowest prior upper bound (also determined using computer analyses)

that it is face-turn metric.

It may be widely believed that 20 or at least 21 face turns is
sufficient, but there is no real proof yet for those figures. No
position having some symmetry requires more than 20 face turns has
reportedly been proven, but that represents a small fraction of the
total positions of the cube. But based upon smaller related groups,
the deepest positions seem to generally have a much over-abundant
share of symmetric positions than their fraction of positions would
suggest. So this leads people to believe there 20 (or maybe 21) could
indeed be the ultimate value.

I just got my 5x5x5 (thanks, Ian :D) and was wondering how long should I work it before lubing...

I did that on my 4x4x4 and it&#x27;s now good...

I did 3 solves so far...dunno how many moves I used, but it was a lot :P

so, how many solves/scrambling/time do you recommend before lubing it?

Elmers is quite flexible and can be removed with ease,

          <div class="email-content">Yes, it is something like tri-athelon event(quarter athelon event). If you include pyraminx, megaminx and square-1, then it will be heptathelon event. If you include magic, master magic and clock, then it will be decathelon event.
   
  In another mind sport &quot;WORLD MEMORY CHAMPIONSHIP&quot; there are 10 events. Although the winners of every indivdual event are honoured, the overall memory champion is decided by summing up the scores of all 10 events. The number of memorisers in the world is not more than 200. But I think the number of serious speed cubers are in multiples of that number.
   
  I think time factor and a thin number of participants might be reason for considering this event. Hence, itstead of going for a seperate event, a point system may be introduced for every event and overall championis decided by summing up them all.

  No, I think these claims are accurate. They even say the expected upper <br>

so they can keep up your legacy, and also because odds are you wont<br>
have many active members try to find some people at other schools nearby.<br>

My biggest problem has been getting peopel to o to competitions, they<br>
usually use and excuse like &quot;ohh i am to slow i will get last&quot; or<br>
something to that effect and its makes it a bit difficult but i can<br>

          <div class="email-content">That is BS, really -- I would agree with you that it is a shame, and
really, they should allow the event.  Who cares if the fastest 5x5
solver wins? It&#x27;s still an event dealing with whole units, and still
provides fodder for competition, and is still valid.  Nobody in other
sports discredits or disallows events of &quot;grouping&quot; styles because of
speculation of who may win or lose.

          <div class="email-content">There will always be an element of chance in Rubik&#x27;s Cube that we 
cannot control.  No offense to Chris Krueger.  I believe Chris to be 
one of the world&#x27;s best blindfolded Rubik&#x27;s Cube solvers, and he does 
things that no one else in this world can do.  He is simply world 
class.

But having a world record only means you have the world record.  It 
doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re the best cuber around.  In order to be the best 
cuber, you have to consistently win competitions against a high level 
of competition.  If everyone gets the same scramble, and everyone gets 
F2L skips, doesn&#x27;t the fastest person win?

But if someone uses a different method... who&#x27;s to say that person who 
uses method A gets lucky and person who uses method B doesn&#x27;t?  There&#x27;s 
no way to control that.  Perhaps the wind was blowing a certain way 
during the 100 meter dash?  Or what about speed skating, where one guy 
falls, takes out everyone else, and the Australian (Bradbury?) who was 
so far behind, that he was able to avoid the crash, wins the gold 
medal?

Short track speed skating... did he get lucky?  He was damn lucky.  He 
was getting owned, and then everyone in front of him got wiped out.  
Did he get the gold medal?  Yes.  Why?  Because he won.  End of story.

Nothing we can do about luck.  There simply isn&#x27;t an unbiased way of 
coming up with a metric.  Don&#x27;t even waste your time trying to disprove 
this statement.  In fact, if I weren&#x27;t so tired, I&#x27;d write a proof on 
why this can&#x27;t be done right now.

Chris Krueger has the world record.  Leave it there.  He did very well. 
  Is there any reason that he doesn&#x27;t deserve it?  No.  I mean, 9.86, 
10.09, 11.13... these were all &quot;lucky&quot; solves, but even if you do every 
step of the Fridrich method, if you had Katsu&#x27;s 8 second solve, 
wouldn&#x27;t that be luckier than a simply PLL skip?

subject of this, and I glanced at what this thread started out to be 
and all I can say is:

IPO.

A cuber can IPO himself/herself... in other words, you buy stock in the 
cuber, and that stock is worth 50% of the future cash earning of the 
cuber.  The cuber could raise initial capital to go to competitions and 
earn the cash.

Or if you believe a cuber is reliable, buy bonds from the cuber.

We should set up an exchange so I can arb you all!

          <div class="email-content">well in those other sport examples, not everyone is having roughly the
same chances as they are engaging in a sport at the same time WITH
each other, with possibilities of interacting with one another, unlike
cubing.  however, the notion of &quot;if others fail, you can succeed&quot;
still applies.  the wind is a good example though, however subtle.  

but this is why i was happy earlier that everyone gets the same
scramble lists.  it makes it very fair.  if person A gets a &quot;lucky&quot;
case, there&#x27;s no reason why person B can&#x27;t either.  and this applies
to any solve, really, as any solve has the potential to be &quot;lucky&quot;
depending on how you go about solving it.

          <div class="email-content">So, I already lubed it...but it&#x27;s hard, since you can&#x27;t do like on the
3x3x3 or 4x4x4, turning 2 sides a bit to create an opening near the
center...the internals are much more complex on the 5x5x5, so it&#x27;s
hard to get and opening...

how do you guys recommend lubing it? I&#x27;m afraid of taking an edge out
and not being able to put it back :P

          <div class="email-content">... another tutorial.

I only looked briefly -- there may be other things I did not catch -- but
your first step for last layer orientation (solving blue cross) is
ineffective.  What you&#x27;ve written does not always work.  There are three
cases:  1) no edges are oriented, 2) two adjacent edges are oriented, 3) 2
opposite edges are oriented.  I tried to complete this step by your
description (curiously) and failed.  The &quot;algorithm&quot; (F U R U&#x27; R&#x27; F&#x27;, by
standard notation) you provided has a specific orientation it needs to be
solved from, and it orients two adjacent edges (UF &amp; UR) and preserves the
already oriented edges (UB &amp; UL).

Very nice cube images.
Notation... might as well change it.

  not bad.. not bad..
   
  guess we need to consider really good cubers then?

          Okay, I have very little time as many as you know, but I read the 
subject of this, and I glanced at what this thread started out to be 
and all I can say is:

IPO.

A cuber can IPO himself/herself... in other words, you buy stock in the 
cuber, and that stock is worth 50% of the future cash earning of the 
cuber. The cuber could raise initial capital to go to competitions and 
earn the cash.

Or if you believe a cuber is reliable, buy bonds from the cuber.

We should set up an exchange so I can arb you all!

Just kidding! It&#x27;s impossible to purchase 6x6x6 or larger yet. You may

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,

I just looked through the page. Very cool concept; I might need to
give it a try. It&#x27;s very cool that the algorithms are so short even
though M2 and R2 affect a lot more pieces than, say, the T-permutation.

So you would say that sub-1 min average is very easily possible with
this method?

In any case, I&#x27;m impressed.

Stefan, do you recommend &quot;learning&quot; all the setups or trying to figure them out? the M2 ones are not that hard, as I already know them with orienting edges first...but I don&#x27;t know about the R2 ones...

so, what do you say?

Stefan, do you recommend &quot;learning&quot; all the setups or trying to figure them out? the M2 ones are not that hard, as I already know them with orienting edges first...but I don&#x27;t know about the R2 ones...

so, what do you say?

I just looked through the page. Very cool concept; I might need to
give it a try. It&#x27;s very cool that the algorithms are so short even
though M2 and R2 affect a lot more pieces than, say, the T-permutation.

So you would say that sub-1 min average is very easily possible with
this method?

In any case, I&#x27;m impressed.

Hi Macky,

I wouldn&#x27;t say &quot;easily&quot; but yes, I think that&#x27;s possible, at least a 
record average.

Memorization is basically the same as my older method and Boris 
Konrad, a top memorizer, told me he averaged memorizing a cube for my 
older method in 40 seconds after a little practice. I&#x27;ve witnessed a 
guy memorizing a scrambled deck of 52 cards in 31 seconds several 
times at a memory competition, so I think a 30 seconds real average 
for memorizing the cube should be feasible, too, maybe faster.

Sometimes I&#x27;ve blindsolved the same scramble several times and got 
the blindfolded execution into the low 30&#x27;s once recall was fluent. 
Not with all scrambles, but with some. And I believe 40 seconds real 
average is possible, especially with a richer set of clean-up 
algorithms for orienting edges and corners and fixing parity 
together, and more practice.

Together that&#x27;d be a 30+40 seconds real average.

Cheers!
Stefan

I&#x27;m sure you can figure them out once you understood the basic idea, 
and you can always come back later and compare to how I do it. In the 
end it doesn&#x27;t really matter, you won&#x27;t even think about setup moves 
anymore, they become a fluent and unconscious part of the whole 
operation, especially cases like U R U&#x27; M2 U R&#x27; U&#x27;. You recall the

I ordered two months ago, but I&#x27;ve been patient since I know about the
problems he has had. But I find it a little strange that he doesn&#x27;t
seem to know about old orders like mine. I mean, I&#x27;ve already paid for
the order, and I need my stickers and strings desperatly.

Will he answer my e-mail if I send one, you think?

Is there a way to just browse your FAQ? Before my initial reply in 
this thread, I had actually asked it &quot;Where can I buy stickers?&quot; and 
got nothing, so I tried to browse for similar questions but only saw 
the &quot;recent&quot; ones and furthermore they&#x27;re all unanswered. Or is that 
the actual current state of the system?

And I still think a guide page would be good. Something that newbies 
can perceive as one chunk of authorative information, not spread over 
many pages and with an impression that it was steered by other 
newbies. Because newbies often also ask bad questions, for example on 
http://tinyurl.com/2jy453 the guy should&#x27;ve specified what he means 
with tiles. Consequently, the answer he got is probably not what he 
wanted, as someone who asks about tiles probably means the thick 
plastic deluxe kind, not the cubesmith variety.

Cheers!
Stefan

The closest there is at the moment is this page:<br>

Although the intention is that there will eventually be too many<br>
questions for such a list to be practical. This list will also display<br>
different possible wordings of the same question.<br>
<br>
The most practical way to find an answer to a question is to just type<br>
the question into the Oracle box. It also works as a search box, so<br>
you could type &quot;stickers&quot; into it, and it would find all questions<br>
that mention stickers. There are currently none.<br>

Recent questions is probably badly named. I wanted to say &quot;Unanswered<br>

<br>
<br>
I have (or had! :) ) one Eastsheen 4x4x4 until yesterday when I was playing<br>
with in at the bathroom (during those free times that we spent seated there)<br>
when I dropped the cube and something happened inside it because I couldn&#x27;t<br>
more do some movements with it.<br>
<br>
Well... anyway... I tried to fix it and accidentaly my cube disassembly into<br>
a thousand parts!! (no one is broken)<br>
<br>
do you know where can I find a tutorial to reassembly it or is easier to buy<br>
a new one?<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot.<br>

You&#x27;re a sissy. Yesterday I assembled one for the first time and yeah 
it took me 32 minutes and yeah it wasn&#x27;t trivial but it&#x27;s not that 
hard, either. Just see it as an extra puzzle you got for free.

With that I mean the physical part, holding the pieces together 
during assembly. Figuring out how the pieces are *supposed* to be 
assembled is rather easy. Hint: seceip tnereffid eht tnuoc dna tros.

          <div class="email-content">Hi Stefan,


I know that probably is not so hard. I just want something to tell me which
part goes to which part.

Anyway, I found an image in cube4you website that shows how it is assembled
(not entire). Now I can figure the internal pieces and also which one goes
besides which cube.

Tonight I will try this new puzzle. Hope to be lucky and solve it asap since
the 4x4x4 is my prefered. I also have the 5x5x5 but really, the 4x4x4 is the
most funny since sometimes you solve the middles in different positions and
just realize when are trying to finish the edges! :)


Cheers

Here&#x27;s my mini-tutorial how to assemble Eastsheen 4x4x4. It may not be 
the best way but it is quite fast to do it that way actually. Making 
the small internal pieces align correctly may be somewhat tricky!

one ages ago was like so:

R2 U&#x27; B2 U R2 - F2 U L2 U&#x27; F2 ( D)

The latter 5 turns are just the mirrored version of first 5. Making 
cyclical shoft by skipping first 3 turns one gets the J-perm out of 
that:

U R2 F2 U L2 U&#x27; F2 D R2 U&#x27; B2

No way speed optimised but just wanted to show the similarity between 
T-perm and J-perm :-)

          <div class="email-content">The M2 setups weren&#x27;t hard, as I expected...

today I went to your site to print the setups before going to the university, so I could take a deeper look...but I printed the wrong part :p it was the example solve...so I tought I&#x27;d just write the M2 setups myself...I already knew half of them, so the other half wasn&#x27;t hard...

but the R2 ones look trickier...

oh, btw, 2 things I noticed...you&#x27;re shooting from DF, right? the D sticker...I think it&#x27;s easier to shoot from FD...at least on the first one, since you don&#x27;t have to turn the cube that much...but that&#x27;s just a little thing...

the other one is that you say that the UF/FU alg is just U2 M&#x27; U2 M&#x27; and the DB/BD is M U2 M U2...but that&#x27;s just when the centers are in their &quot;correct&quot; position...when they&#x27;re an M2 away, you have to swap the algs...or did you find another way?

 I&#x27;m sure you can figure them out once you understood the basic idea, 
 and you can always come back later and compare to how I do it. In the 
 end it doesn&#x27;t really matter, you won&#x27;t even think about setup moves 
 anymore, they become a fluent and unconscious part of the whole 
 operation, especially cases like U R U&#x27; M2 U R&#x27; U&#x27;. You recall the

<br>
If you have time tonight, and you average sub-20, could you do <br>
something for me?<br>
<br>
Open up a scrambling program.  Scramble the cube, and speedsolve it.  <br>
Record the time.  Then using the same scramble rescramble the cube and <br>
do the exact same solve on it, counting the moves.  Then repeat that <br>
for 10-15 solves, then send them to me.  I don&#x27;t need the scrambles, <br>
just the time and move count.<br>
<br>
I am doing a statistics project, and have already looked at times, and <br>
haven&#x27;t found that interesting, but I just had an idea for this, and <br>
if I could get these before 9 EST tonight that would be awesome.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
So my stackmat is way messed up.  Like, could possible be dead messed up. I wanted to <br>
hear if anyone had any suggestions for a hard reset that I had not thought of before I look <br>
into sending it back to speedstacks.  I&#x27;ve already checked every website I can find and <br>
nothing has any good info.  <br>
<br>
Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening:<br>
When I first turned it on, only the red LED would like up, and faintly at that.  When I push <br>
the reset button (the one on the back of the timer) with a paper clip the LED will go out, <br>
but as soon as I let off it comes back on in the exact same way.  None of the buttons work <br>
in this state.<br>
<br>
If however I push the reset button in the back and hold the power button and the reset <br>
button in the front while I let off of the one in the back the green and red LEDs alternate <br>
turning on while the number panel will display the same number (counting from 1 to 9) in <br>
every single spot and sort of go through what I can only describe as a routine of displaying <br>
certain things.  In this case if I push the power button the timer will turn off, and if I push <br>
the reset button (the one on the front) it goes to the red LED case.<br>
<br>
All in all I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good situation, but just in case there&#x27;s anything I can do and <br>
advice would be IMMENSELY appreciated.  I can&#x27;t find my original intruction booklet, so <br>
sorry if I posted this when it was in there.  Thanks for any help in advance.<br>

          <div class="email-content">I think memorizing the cube in 20 seconds or less each time is very
possible, if not quicker.  Think about memo&#x27;ing a deck of cards in 30
seconds, that is almost 2 cards each second.  If you are using your method
where you fix orientation and permutation at one time, that leaves you 20
pieces to memo.  If you can do 1 piece a second, or quicker, that is a max
of 20 seconds.  Of course memo&#x27;ing a deck vs. a cube is different since you
have to look around as you memo while a deck you just flip through.  I
believe that is a very possible avg memo time.

          <div class="email-content">One answer would be to add more cubes.

So you&#x27;d have to solve, say, 1 5x5x5, 2 4x4x4, 5 3x3x3 and 10 2x2x2.

Finding and mixing 18 cubes for each competitor is probably a cure  
worse than the disease. And the best 5x5x5 guy would win anyway,  
since he has to be good at all the smaller cubes to be good at the  
big one.

&gt; <br>
&gt; Today I set a PB of 33.55 for the centres + edges of the 4x4x4. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Can any of you fast 4x4x4 solvers beat this? (regularly?)<br>
&gt; <br>

<br>
Oh, nice!<br>
<br>
Well, my best average is 1:15; I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;d consider that<br>
fast or not. Anyway, I&#x27;ve never had a nonlucky sub-1 time, so unless I<br>
had a really awful 3x3x3 I doubt I&#x27;ve had a centers+edges time as good<br>
as that.<br>

off it and put them on sticker book paper<br>
its like sorta waxy paper htat u stick stickers on and it dosent weaken <br>
the stickers that much<br>
if i leave the stickers on this paper for like 2-3 weeks before puting <br>
the stickers back on a new cube will they stick ok?<br>
if they dont what is the best glue for glueing stickers back on and <br>
where do i buy it<br>
<br>
also is this just as good as textured stickers?<br>

          <div class="email-content">29-30 moves for F2L are okay, 28 is the avarage number of moves, based
on the fact that the avarage number of moves for each corner-edge pair
is 7 moves(and 7x4=28, not 8x4...). You will be able to solve the F2L
in 28 moves on avarage if you learn the shortest algs for each F2L case.
And for the fingertricks and regripping, a suggest trying,practising,
and taking a look at speedcuber sites, f.e. cubewhiz.com(F2L algs
explained in text) and solvethecube.co.uk(few F2L algs in video at the
fingertricks section).

Yes, I think of DF. I&#x27;m not entirely sure why I switched from FD. 
Anyway, this doesn&#x27;t affect the turning *at all*, as it&#x27;s just a 
different perspective on the exact same thing.

swap the algs...or did you find another way?

With &quot;target&quot; I mean where you want it to go *before* applying the 
alg. And yes, that means when the centers are wrong, I just swap the 
algs. But if you memorize in pairs like I do, then you pretty much 
ignore it. Just memorize like you would with the centers not moving, 
and connect the pair-part-two item (an action for me) with the 
appropriate alg.

Thanks for the questions, I might clarify that on my page when I have 
more time.

Yes, it basically works exactly like my old method, it&#x27;s just faster. 
I use DF/UB as buffer/target, but you can also use FD/BU like I

An idéa to get a little around that is to do &quot;time of X cube&quot; divided 
by &quot;X&quot; where &quot;X&quot; is the size of the cube and then sum up the results of 
that.

UC Irvine cube club. i was hoping it started sooner or later. im 
guessing Chris Dzoan decided to start it?

anyways, from my former highschool, they meet occasionaly on friday 
afternoons after school and just VS one another. also we have stuff 
like &quot;algorithm of the week&quot;. really good cubers guide fellow beginners 
and amateurs on achieving sub-20 and offer guidelines like fingertricks 
and stuff.

The range of times for the top 20 single 2x2x2 speedsolves is less than
2 seconds. The range of times for the top 20 single 3x3x3 speedsolves is
less than 3 seconds. The range of times for the top 20 single 4x4x4
speedsolves is about 10 seconds.

Notwithstanding the fact that your suggestion involves a LOT of solves
(about 5 minutes worth, assuming world record speed and little
transition time, not to mention about 15 seconds worth of inspection PER
cube), the range of time you hope to add by including 1 more 4x4x4
solve, 4 more 3x3x3 solves, and 9 more 2x2x2 solves is about 40 seconds.
Comparing this to the range of 5x5x5 solves, this is equal to the range
of times for the first 40 single 5x5x5 speedsolves (roughly).

So what does this mean? Well, even if you can achieve world record speed
for the 2x2x2, 3x3x3, and 4x4x4 (note this means world record speed for
EACH 2x2x2-4x4x4, and there are 17 of them in the case Lars gave), a
5x5x5 solve that is about 40 seconds faster (which is conceivable) will
nearly guarantee you a win.

The problem with multiple cubes lies not only in finding and scrambling
them all, but the weight of the 5x5x5 solve should not be equal to the
other cube solve times. If you were, however, to weight the times
differently (by some sort of scoring system per different cube type,
e.g.), doing one of each cube may be sufficient. Thus, for example, a 1
second difference in the 2x2x2 solve could equate to a 2 second
difference in the 3x3x3, which could be equal to a 5 second difference
in the 4x4x4, or a 10 second difference in the 5x5x5. The numbers, of
course, would have to be very fastidiously chosen, for fears of placing
too much weight on the 2x2x2 solve, etc..

I break into new cycles just like with my old method. I should 
probably mention that one on the new method page.

http://www.stefan-pochmann.info/spocc/blindsolving/3x3/

Joel also explained this (and better than I did) here:

If you want to use FD/BU instead of DF/UB for buffer/target, just 
swap the algs for UL and LU, for FR and RF, etc.

I decided my triumphant victory will be even more glorious when my 
method is known in advance!

Either that or I was just eager to publish it. And with the recent 
results of Matyas and Chris and Danyang as well as my ongoing 
practice laziness and Diploma Thesis of Damocles causing me to not 
even allow myself a lot of practice, my chances to ever get the WR 
are getting smaller and smaller anyway. I might have to settle for 
regular ponies.

          <div class="email-content">What would the longer algorithms be for the edge cases BU, FU, BD,
etc? I think I see how this method works (it seems to find a way to
insert the target piece into the UB slot without disturbing the middle
layer) but I am not sure how to do this for these three cases.  

so for edge cycles, we need a swapping alg for every NEW cycle to get
some new cycle-starter into the DF spot? what happens in the case of
parity? also, for the &quot;unsolved edge orientation&quot; cases you refer to,

          <div class="email-content">since UB/BU and DF/FD are on opposite sides of the cube (ie. an M2
away), the algs for solving UB/BU are the same regardless of where you
encounter it in the cycle.  however, if you are memorizing in pairs,
like piece1-piece2, then if piece2 is a UF/FU, then you use the DB/BD
algorithm, or if piece2 is a DB/BD piece, then you use the UF/FU
algorithm (because after piece1 was solved, you have an M2 to undo,
and whatever was in UF/FU is now in DB/BD and vice-versa)

In short i think you only need to swap for UF/FU and DB/BD if it&#x27;s
being performed during an M2-is-currently-out-of-place situation

suppose you&#x27;re shooting from DF and want to shoot to RU...the alg in your page is x&#x27; U&#x27; R U M2 U&#x27; R&#x27; U x

when I &quot;found&quot; the algs myself I came up with x&#x27; R U M2 R&#x27; U&#x27; x

would that work? (same for LU) if not, why?

just wondering...

how x&#x27; U&#x27; R U brings RU into UB without messing up anything else in M?
if you just do x&#x27; R U, notice how it kicks the DB piece out of place.

No, no one to my knowledge can solve a 3x3 in 3 seconds. The range
refers to the positive difference between two cubers, in this case #20
and #1. I was merely trying to point out the difference in variation
between times for 2x2-4x4 and the 5x5.

Yes, this is what I was alluding to in my post, and there are many ways
this can be accomplished, IMO. However, it would have to be clear that
the resulting value of f2(x2) + f3(x3) + f4(x4) + f5(x5) is not a time
but a score.

Perhaps 20 years ago when Rubik&#x27;s cube attracted a larger group of

Alas, times have changed.

This slightly confuses me, mainly because UB/DF aren&#x27;t the 
&quot;problematic&quot; edges. They&#x27;re not solved relative to the centers, 
that&#x27;s UF and DB. Also, DF isn&#x27;t really ever solved at all, at least 
not directly, as it&#x27;s the buffer edge and gets solved by solving all 
other edges. And UB always belongs at UB.

That&#x27;s correct. Also, even though I know this is confusing at first, 
it can be completely hidden by an appropriate piece2 mapping to the 
correct alg. So once this is learned, one doesn&#x27;t need to think about 
the issue at all.

Basically of course the same effect, only the piece at DF before the 
alg and the piece at DF after the alg need an extra flip. You can see 
some possible algs in Erik&#x27;s tutorial:

http://erikku.er.funpic.org/rubik/M2.html

Yes. And preferably break into the new cycle at UB, UF or DB, which 
have the fastest algs. That actually saves time twice, as at the end 
of the cycle you&#x27;ll close it with the same fast alg. Unless the cycle 
contains an overall flip and you insist on solving BU/FU/BD with 
correct orientation right away.

If you want to do that, you could use Joel van Noort&#x27;s idea: break 
into a cycle right where one of the pieces UB/UF/DB is located, so 
the next alg *after* breaking into the cycle is fast and avoids the 
lengthy flipping M-slice alg.

> what happens in the case of parity?

After &quot;solving&quot; edges and corners, apply the parity alg:
(r2&#x27; U&#x27; r2) (R&#x27; U) (L&#x27; U2&#x27;) (R U&#x27; R&#x27; U2 R) (L U&#x27;) (r2&#x27; U)

Basically, yes. But also possibly some M-slice edges which I&#x27;ve 
&quot;solved&quot; with the wrong orientation. I very much like the case where 
one L or R slice edge was flipped from the getgo, and I saved time 
with M-slice algs leaving three M-slice edges flipped. Then with 
trivial setup, (M&#x27;U)*4 does the whole orientation (this btw is the 
case I prefer to point out when trying to explain why flipped M-slice 
edges isn&#x27;t that bad at all).

          <div class="email-content">I do have a question though about its speed
If there is a step at the end for orienting edges, then this is not
much further off from the EO phase of EO/EP solving in terms of time
spent in execution.  Which means it becomes a matter of comparing EP
to M2 method, which uses a short alg per edge plus an alg for starting
a new cycle.  is this going to ultimately be faster than EP which
solves 2 edges at a time and needs the EO anyway?

They turn poorly, and the stickers/tiles have very sharp edges... at
least if it&#x27;s the same kind I have, looks like it though.

Even if there is a step for orienting the edges, I think there won&#x27;t
be as many edges to orient. I might just be the ones in the M slice,
or the ones that are already permuted but not orientation. So it&#x27;s not
that time consuming...

If orientation is  such a problem...why not just do 3 cycle with no
orientation o.O?

          <div class="email-content">Kai is right.  The new minx is useable, although you wouldn&#x27;t want use it
for much beyond learning.  I bought one to try it and the first one broke 10
minutes out of the box.  They sent me a new one and the centers on that one
slowly unscrewed themselves after counterclockwise face rotations.  If
you&#x27;re learning the minx then buy this one first; it shoulg last long
enough.  Plus, your options are strictly limited at the moment:  As you know
Mefferts has no megaminxs in stock.  Uwe says to me in an e-mail:

&quot;We are trying to find better glue for the tiles which is quite difficult as
we have to comply with new Toy Safety regulation.&quot;

&quot;We are planning to have them back in stock by the end of the year.&quot;

You may try eBay.  I&#x27;ve seen a few of the older Tomy megaminxs on there in
the past few months; expensive though (Stefan sold one mint for a killing,
but the rest hover around 60-70 USD).  Keep your eyes open to markets like
eBay, wait until &quot;the end of the year&quot; for Mefferts to rerelease them, or
try to make due with the newer version.

Recently Uwe asked me about some stuff and we&#x27;ve also talked about 
the Megaminx. He told me he&#x27;s trying to bring them back at the end of 
the year. He mentioned a problem with the tiles and I suggested to 
also use softer springs and explained how I improved my megaminx. 
He&#x27;s interested and I hope it&#x27;ll lead to future Megaminxes being as 
great as mine right from the start.

Btw, he also said the Skewb Ultimate will be back by mid July.

I suspect after sanding the inside edges of the edge pieces (and 
maybe corners and centers a bit, too) like I also did with my Meffert 
megaminx, will make it quite alright. Those edges are just very sharp 
and catch a lot, causing pops.

Cheers!

Yes, that&#x27;s how it works.

          <div class="email-content">I got contacted to do a newspaper interview.  It&#x27;s nice for a
newspaper to be able to write an article about the US Open and mention
someone local that will be there.  It gives the story a local flavor,
instead of just a generic national article.  Besides, you might find a
bunch of local people that are speedcubers but didn&#x27;t know there were
others in their town.

I found out about Cubesmith while looking for replacement stickers for<br>
the Rubik&#x27;s cube. So I ordered $10 worth of stickers from them in<br>
mid-February. It is now June, and I haven&#x27;t received any stickers or<br>
any refunds. I have e-mailed him several times, they have not replied<br>
nor have they sent a refund or the stickers.<br>

Looking around many speedcubing sites, Cubesmith seems to be a very<br>
popular, affordable place to go for replacement stickers. Everyone<br>

          <div class="email-content">The rubiks.has.it forum gets about 5-10 spammers register a day.  That is
why it is manual review registration now.  I usually check the email to
verfiy... and always give the benefit of the doubt as to whether it is a
spammer or not.  I plan on upgrading the forum to vBulletin soon and moving
it to my own server, and possibly expanding to multiple languages, adding
tons of features, getting a real domain, etc.  For those of you who prefer
posting/reading through email, hopefully vB will come out with the option of
that soon, if not, we may be able to work around that (Ryan Heise, if you
any ideas, please email me). And by the way, none of the posts would be lost
if this occured... the only problem I could see if transfering the passwords
since the encryption process may be different for the upgraded software.  If
anyone has any comments or suggestions, please let me know.

I&#x27;ve ordered from him once and had no problems at all- I live in the
US though, so I wouldn&#x27;t know about overseas. I&#x27;ve recommended
cubesmith to some of my friends at school, and everything&#x27;s gone fine.

          <div class="email-content">The one on his site labeled &quot;odd parity.&quot; After solving for edges, you
should have an M2 that needs to be undome.  After solving for corners,
you should have an R2 that needs to be undone.  But doing so would not
solve those last two edges and last two corners! So you use the odd
parity alg to not only restore the M and R slice, but the edges and
corners as well.

My forum viewer is just receiving copies like any other mail reader<br>

Having said that, I did still implement a delete function which I use<br>

Banning members is not handled at my end, since I am just providing a<br>

  Okay, I understand.  So would it be possible to allow people to read/post
via email, and at the same time, allowed to be posted into a forum? I
believe vB is working on doing something like this.

There will probably one at either G-Wiz (Sarasota) again or in
Bradenton. Will is trying to get that set up. I&#x27;m trying to get a
Florida Fall set up that would be in Avon Park again. And maybe some
more around the state.

36 sec<br>
&gt; avg. is quite impressive.  Do you guys have any tips to move from 50<br>
seconds<br>
&gt; to sub-40 seconds avg for centers+edges?  Thanks<br>
<br>
Well, there&#x27;s the obvious, work on lookahead and don&#x27;t move too fast.<br>
You&#x27;ll need to move the cube around a lot, but that&#x27;s normal. Try to<br>
remember where things are if you think it will help.<br>
<br>
Also, you want to be as efficient as possible without losing speed.<br>
Try to be color-neutral on the centers, and learn to take advantage of<br>
blocks if you haven&#x27;t already. On the edges, you can usually (3/4 of<br>
the time) get an edge into the place you want with exactly three<br>
moves, so again work towards optimizing this, and making as few actual<br>
moves as you can (again, without losing too much time). Try finding<br>
your first pair of edges near the end of the centers step so you don&#x27;t<br>
slow down there, and try finding some of the cross while doing the<br>
last few edges.<br>
<br>
I don&#x27;t know how you get to sub-40 c+e, but I&#x27;m at 40-45 second average.<br>

  Okay, I can see that.  Those tips are basically what I have been working
on.  Practice makes perfect I suppose.  I just wanted to double check that I
am not missing the obvious.

<br>
Whenever you start your computer, you are faced with a few moments of<br>
thumb twiddling while Windows XP boots and prompts you to log on.<br>
Although you should expect to wait for a few moments, sometimes<br>
Windows XP seems to boot rather slowly. In fact, you may notice that<br>
over a period of time the PC that used to roar to life seems a bit<br>
sluggish instead. Fortunately, you can perform several techniques that<br>
help Windows XP get the bootup speed you want. This chapter explores<br>
how to put these techniques to work.<br>

i still have one question though, what do you do if, say, ub gets
solved in the first cycle? once the cycle&#x27;s over, both ub and df are
solved. do you *always* need to use some pll alg to swap in a new
cyclestarter?

After UB I prefer UF and BD, because their algs are short.

You&#x27;re welcome. You can find links to all the videos, as well as some
new and some old speedcubing info here: http://www.thepublicvoid.com.

Sorry it was so long in coming!  I&#x27;ve been getting back into
speedcubing this past year. I&#x27;ve finally gotten my average down to
sub-14 (13.82), and after years I&#x27;ve motivated to get some cube info
back up on the web.

I wish I could come to the 2007 World Championship, but my
step-brother&#x27;s getting married that weekend. I&#x27;ll be out at future
competitions, though, as circumstances/travel distances permit.

Happy cubing!

Dan

Then I choose another target to break into a new cycle. Just any 
piece inside that cycle.

No. And I don&#x27;t keep that in mind. Actually I don&#x27;t ever think about 
the position of the middle layer. I already did that during the 
construction of the method.

Cheers!

          <div class="email-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I would like to announce a new online competition for linear<br>
fewest-moves solving which will be run from the following site:<br>
<br>
    http://www.ryanheise.com/competitions/<br>
<br>
Linear FMC has the following basic rules:<br>
<br>
- 1 hour to solve.<br>
- No taking back moves (different from regular FMC)<br>
<br>
In this event, you are given only one chance to solve the cube and<br>
therefore must rely heavily on your ability to &quot;look ahead&quot;. Although<br>
the time limit is 1 hour, I expect that most people will not use this<br>
much time.<br>
<br>
The competition will be run in rounds of 12 weeks, where a different<br>
scramble is given each week. A winner will be declared for each week<br>
as well as an overall champion with the highest ranking after 12 weeks.<br>
<br>
This competition&#x27;s goal is to exercise look-ahead abilities and<br>
thinking speed for fewest moves solving, and to develop skills that<br>
can eventually be transferred over to speed cubing.<br>
<br>
Please contact me if you have questions about the format or the<br>
submission system. And finally, good luck to those who will<br>
participate :-)<br>

This is a great idea. I guess we&#x27;re not supposed to copy the state
onto a real cube and use that one? That&#x27;s cheating, right?

Actually, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re supposed to do :-) The applet is just<br>
there to show you what your cube should look like after you apply the<br>
scramble. However, it is expected that you use your own cube to<br>

You can take the Blue Line train from O&#x27;Hare to downtown for $1.50.

Are you staying at the Congress Plaza?  Do you plan on riding the train to
somewhere close and then just walk several blocks w/ all your stuff to the
hotel?  For those of you staying at the Congress Plaza, how are you going
from the airport to the hotel?  Thanks

          <div class="email-content">The screw only keeps the central axle together. You don&#x27;t need to
worry about that if you&#x27;re just taking the pieces out.

Turn a face 45 degrees, then lift up one of the edge pieces of the
rotated face. Depending on how tight your cube is, it may take a
little force to get the piece out (if necessary, find a key or
screwdriver that&#x27;s not too sharp and use it to pry it out. Don&#x27;t force
it too hard or you might break something). Once the first piece is out
the rest of the cube will practically disassemble itself.

          <div class="email-content">I am obviously going to say that this does not include a ridiculously lucky case.  The limits 
will be pushed, but I don&#x27;t think they will go past 8 seconds on a non-lucky (or too easy) 
solve.  With the use of additional algorithms, they will take slightly longer to recognize, 
and although they will do more at once, they may be slightly longer...

I&#x27;m interested to find out on what this prediction is based. You might
remember I did a similar statistical effort, for a bit of fun, to
predict the limits for an nxnxn cube, but everything hinged on my
forecast (which proved to be way wrong), that 13.22 seconds would not
be beaten as an average of 5 in competition.

Could you post some details about your method?

Cheers,

If it is a studio or diy cube should pop of the center cap on each
center. (after taking it apart) then there is a screw that loosens the
tension and makes the cube looser. if that&#x27;s what you want to know..

I met this guy at a competition who had a white diy cube that i liked
a lot. he claims he got it from rubiks.com but i looked and they don&#x27;t
specify colors. does anybody know where i can get a good quality white
plastic diy kit??

If it is a studio or diy cube should pop of the center cap on each
center. (after taking it apart) then there is a screw that loosens the
tension and makes the cube looser. if that&#x27;s what you want to know..

I was about to dig that old thread up when this one came up but changed 
my mind when I saw you admit you was wrong all by yourself :) Then I 
was about to say something about forecasting... like the wether... But 
of course, in England that is not a problem, just say i may rain and 
you are pretty safe :P

I recently got a job as a trainee weather forecaster working with the

What on earth do you mean by unsolved configurations? Surely it cannot 
mean unsolvable configurations nor &quot;not-yet-encountered configuration&quot;. 
So what do you mean by that? Is it simply possible configurations - 1 ??

Surely, some fairly simple algorithm will be able to determine this for 
arbitrary sized cubes? (Using &quot;array integer multiplication&quot; to keep 
all digits.)

By that I mean the number of possible, legal, positions for that cube
size minus the solved state.

I also just found that the number of unsolved configurations to an
11x11x11 cube is also a prime number ;-)

I have to admit I have no idea what array integer multiplication is
;-)  But if it would work to solve this problem I&#x27;d be interested in
learning about it.

I peel of the stickers with my fingers and using an old towel to rub 
of the glue, one peice at the time until it&#x27;s compleatly clean, not 
too much work that way either.

 hey i&#x27;m already in town and i was wondering if there is any place people are meeting up and hanging out that get in early. i&#x27;m working for another couple hours but then i&#x27;m free. i obviously have access to email, but my phone is six fife oh double seven double tree niner forty eight. if you can decipher that give me a call, i&#x27;m staying on the south side but am familiar with the pt around here so its not a problem to get anywhere

&gt; I&#x27;m kind of curious if there is a pattern as to which cubes have this<br>
&gt; property.  So far I only know it is true for the 3x3x3 and 8x8x8 cube.<br>
<br>
&gt; I also just found that the number of unsolved configurations to an<br>

I just tested the super-supercubes up to 21x21x21 and none of them are<br>
prime.  I can&#x27;t test any higher than that because the factor program I<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

Well, basically you hold each digit of an integer in each index of an 
array. Simply using the integer or longint datatypes found in most 
computer languages you will soon find that with large integers they 
are represented in the form a*10^b kind of thing and the numbers are 
not accurately represented anymore. With arays (or lists or similar) 
one can represent in principal arbitrary long integers with a full 
valid representation. I once calculated large factorials like this 
with Turbo Pascal. Addition, multiplication and subtraction with 
these arays is straight forward: the good old blackboard kind of 
thing from primary school.

Combine all this with some simple prime factor search and you are 
done. You can find out if size(nxnxn cube group)-1 is prime for 
arbitrary big n ;-)

Sounds really slow to me, actually. Even ECM factoring is fast, but it&#x27;s a 
lot easier to test for primality than to factor, you know (just ask a 
cryptologist).
And even pseudoprime tests (for elimination) to base 2 with Mathematica&#x27;s 
really efficient PowerMod command are slowing rapidly at n=30...
But by trial division and some other fast tests, Mathematica eliminates most 
numbers in a few seconds, often &lt;1 second. 55, 62, 64, 67, 74, 78, 80, 86, 
87, 92, 95, 98 are the only suspects it left below 100, not eliminated by 
PrimeQ in ten seconds (I already tested up to 54).

So it seems to me that primes are extremely rare. Unfortunately, the number 
of states-1 are not exactly the nicest numbers to analyze, since they get 
large so quickly and there are no Lucas-like checks (alluding to Mersenne &amp; 
GIMPS here, not myself) for Rubik&#x27;s nth Constant.

Can we get a number theory expert here?

          <div class="email-content">A while ago, Shotaro Makisumi came up with a nice idea for last slot: http://cubefreak.net/f2lc_llco.html<br>
Instead of solving all four F2L slots, then orienting all LL pieces, and then permuting them, the method substitutes:<br>
- 3 F2L slots <br>
- ELS: place the edge of the last slot (LS) and orient LL edges <br>
- CLS: place the LS corner and orient LL corners <br>
- PLL <br>
<br>
I found all the algs for it, and adopted it as a speedcubing method. Because I never thought of a good descriptive name for it (F2Lc+LLCO is not exactly easy to rattle off), I eventually got to calling it MGLS, for Makisumi-Garron Last Slot. (If ZB and VH, why not MG?)<br>
<br>
The pages with the description, algs, etc. are here: http://cube.garron.us/MGLS/<br>
<br>
I find it a very nice method; I can average sub-20 with it. In terms of moves and algs, it&#x27;s a teeny bit shorter than Fridrich, with a bit more algs (104 for CLS: 56+reflections), but very comparable. <br>
Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t tell about it at the US Open (because we had to cancel our vacation last-second), so I guess it&#x27;ll be just online announcement :-)<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m eager for any comments or suggestions (or criticism) -and please tell me if the pages aren&#x27;t working on your computer, or if you find a mistake. I do know that the applets tend to cause trouble, most often by using too many resources, so if you know it&#x27;s just that, don&#x27;t worry: that I&#x27;ll make an image-only page soon.<br>
<br>
I hope people like the idea, and actually use it; after all, the more users, the more people make it a better method.<br>

          <div class="email-content">Hi :-)

The main problem here is that the checking has to be be done with a 
non-standard data type. Integer or longint wont hold such big numbers 
with all digits represented. The array/list implemementation may not 
be the most effective but it&#x27;s simple and works nicely.

Practically one could decide the array-size beforehand to avoid 
having to expand them dynamically which is slow :-)

So the main problem is the data structure not the prime search in 
itself :-)

I really don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;m pretty convince it&#x27;s random, with some 
qualifiers.
By the way, is there a reason that 3+8=11 ?

See my horribly informal computation below.

>From the implementation notes in Mathematica&#x27;s help:
&quot;PrimeQ first tests for divisibility using small primes, then uses the 
Miller-Rabin strong pseudoprime test base 2 and base 3, and then uses a 
Lucas test.&quot;
But somewhere it hides:
&quot;As of 1997, this procedure is known to be correct only for n&lt;10^16, and it 
is conceivable that for larger n it could claim a composite number to be 
prime.

But not the other way (I think). If it returns false, the number has been 
proven composite, either with a factor or some pseudoprime test. That&#x27;s, as 
far as I can tell, how it tells me in 0.071 seconds that Cu[100]-1, a 
38415-digit number, is not prime. And Cu[1000]-1 (3874242 digits) in 14 
seconds. Anything else would even be torturously slower. (Note that in 
cryptology, where important secrets rely on primality and factorability, 
they&#x27;re talking about only hundreds of digits...)
Mathematica declares a lot of numbers composite in less than ten seconds, 
and has given me no other primes than 3, 8, and 11 (well, the corresponding 
states-1).
Only 36 numbers before 200 don&#x27;t make it, and I&#x27;ve even eliminated the first 
four before:
31, 39, 48, 52, 55, 62, 64, 67, 74, 78, 80, 86, 87, 92, 95, 98, 110, 114, 
118, 123, 130, 132, 144, 150, 152, 158, 163, 164, 166, 167, 170, 177, 184, 
192, 195, 198
It will be computationally taxing to prove any of these prime. It&#x27;d be 
better to bet on them being composite and see which don&#x27;t pass other tests.
Actually, I did try base 2 pseudoprime tests, and abandoned them; on 
analysis, checking time is O[1.2^n]. n =100 would take about 7 days. And 
that&#x27;s efficient, in a sense.

The numbers just grow so quickly (even the number of digits in them grows 
faster than linear) that almost any constructive approach is useless, except 
by specific theory.
I think Mathematica&#x27;s &quot;False&quot; return on most numbers is reliable, and 
sometime I&#x27;ll sieve even farther.

> Also what is the maximum size large number
> it can work with, how many digits?
It can work with millions of digits; the actual max depends on the system
$MaxNumber for my laptop is about 2*10^646456887 .
So, for me: more than half a billion digits

By the way, I&#x27;m relying on Hardwick&#x27;s formulas: Cu[n]=((24*2^10*12!)^Mod[n, 
2]*7!*3^6*24!^Floor[(n^2 - 2*n)/4])/4!^(6*Floor[(n - 2)^2/4]) and Su[n]=
[((24*2^21*12!)^Mod[n, 2]*7!*3^6*24!^Floor[(n^2 - 2*n)/4])/2^Floor[(n - 
2)^2/4]
They&#x27;re correct, right? Is 7548.5*n^2 a good enough approximation to Cu[n]?
Also, I checked a lot of supercubes and tried +1, just for fun, and they 
look hopeless. + or - anything other than 1  is also definitely composite, 
guaranteed up to 29^2=841.
And I got silly and tested, base ten, the sum of the digits and the number 
of digits for primality - there are none prime up to 150 or so for the 
former, and a few for the latter (n= 19, 37, 41, 72...)

This is getting to long...
Basically, I&#x27;m just guessing that primes will be really rare, and probably 
about as rare as regular primes. So that&#x27;d give about a probability of 
primality of 1 in 9n^2 (actually, closer to n^2*Log[24!/(4!^6)]/4) to Cu[n]. 
That means that the chances around n=1000 are about 1 in 10^7.
I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m manipulating infinite products correctly, but under 
the assumption that these numbers are as likely to be prime as any other of 
their size, I find that the probability that >any&lt; number above n=11 yields 
a prime is less than 1%
In fact, the probability that any of these numbers>1 is a prime at all is 
about 7%, and the fact that there are three such numbers doesn&#x27;t change 
that. It just suggests that the assumptions may not be warranted. (Again, 
I&#x27;m not so sure about the rigor of this, but taking in to account that 
knowing the numbers are not divisible by any prime up to 23 can possibly 
change these to 6% and 37%). I wasn&#x27;t too formal, but at least I convinced 
myself :-)
At least the probability that there is a prime does NOT go to 100% as n goes 
to infinity, though its limit is a bit of a matter of definition.

My point: I don&#x27;t expect to see another Scrambled Rubik&#x27;s Constant Prime.

Hope I didn&#x27;t confuse anyone too much.

          <div class="email-content">On speedcubing.com, the results of an unofficial competition in Hungary are linked.<br>
<br>
I know that this all is off course unofficial but it&#x27;s interesting to see that,if it was an official competition, 3 world records would have been broken.<br>
Matyas Kuti: 1.03.xx blindsolve.<br>
                     0.91 seconds magic average,<br>
<br>
Milan Baltitz: 3.9x seconds average 2x2x2.<br>
<br>
I think we can expect lots of records at the WC in Boedapest.<br>
That is if they all perform like this weekend off course.<br>

Ae you planning to use this for all of F2L? It&#x27;s really only intended for <br>
last slot. I suppose you could try to use it on previous slots to make the <br>
last one easier, but that would often take longer, I think. As for the <br>
vice-versa, I call that Mini-ZB:<br>
http://www.cubezone.be/insertE1.html<br>

working)<br>
<br>
&gt; if there is a printable page of the all<br>
&gt; the edge and corner cases somewhere that would be great.<br>
There is: http://cube.garron.us/MGLS/MGLS.pdf. It&#x27;s still a bit cluttered.<br>

&gt; http://web.archive.org/web/20031204022530/http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~rheise/cube/step2.html<br>
&gt; On that page, you can find all optimal solutions for step 2. The<br>
&gt; advantage of step 2 is that it is *very* fast and and has instant<br>
&gt; recognition.<br>
You put the intuitive techniques for that step very nicely. I&#x27;ve already <br>
gotten used to some of them, but didn&#x27;t want to make a page detailing them. <br>
Is this safe to link to? Or can I put these pages on my website (with full <br>

          <div class="email-content">I would only do it for the last F2L but I really would like to see how
it will affect my times. I would probably learn the cases where the
edge is in flipped correctly corner flipped a certain way from there
and do corner flipped correctly edge flipped a certain way, etc.  I
will have what I hope time to learn at least a good amount of cases in
the next few weeks.

Not fair, Minh was using a brand new untrigable cube. Look at the video 
from the competition and you can see him doing wrist turns all the way. 
Really impressing, I can&#x27;t get much better times than 1 minute if I&#x27;m 
using a stiff cube like that one.

It&#x27;s relatively safe: http://www.archive.org/about/faqs.php#4<br>

I suppose bigint is actually an array/list implementation like i 
described but with an easy to use API. And anyway, not everyone knows 
perl, but maybe something like C++ or VisualBasic or Java.

On the other side mathematica or Mathcad may do all of this for us 
automatically, but what&#x27;s the fun in that??

Actually Java has a Biginteger class also, just found out ;-)

The problem may not be with ur cube u prob just need to lubricate it.
I find that silicone lubricants work best.

  The best speedcubes are DIY (Do-it-yourself) cubes from various sites, such as cube4you. NEVER BUY FROM RUBIKS.COM unless you want to pay for the outrageous shipping rates. The cubes from Toys R Us are very bad for speedcubing, from my experience. You can buy Hungarian studio cubes from ebay, and people say they are very good (I personally haven&#x27;t tried it yet). You can also lubricate the insides of your cube buy taking it apart, cleaning the dust, spraying each piece with silicon spray, then putting it back together. I can&#x27;t think of anything else to say...

          <div class="email-content">i&#x27;m not really a pro either, but it sounds like you need some 
lubricating.  like other said silicon works best (make sure you clean 
the pieces first).  do NOT use a petroleum based lubricant as it will 
wear faster and get sticky and messy.  as far as cubes go, DIY&#x27;s are 
best (in my opinion) because you get to put it together and spring 
tension is adjustable.  If you dont want to spend that money, i would 
at least make sure you have an official Rubik&#x27;s brand cube (it will 
have the Rubik&#x27;s logo on the middle white sticker).

            i&#x27;m not really a pro either, but it sounds like you need some 

lubricating.  like other said silicon works best (make sure you clean 

the pieces first).  do NOT use a petroleum based lubricant as it will 

wear faster and get sticky and messy.  as far as cubes go, DIY&#x27;s are 

best (in my opinion) because you get to put it together and spring 

tension is adjustable.  If you dont want to spend that money, i would 

at least make sure you have an official Rubik&#x27;s brand cube (it will 

have the Rubik&#x27;s logo on the middle white sticker).
