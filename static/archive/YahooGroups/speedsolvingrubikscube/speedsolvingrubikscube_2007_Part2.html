        Should we change the WCA regulations and &gt; ask for the judge to check
        for the scrambled puzzle, telling the &gt; scrambler to solve/rescramble
        when there's a mistake? I thought that either a correctly scrmabled
        cube, or a diagram of the correctly applied scramble would be avalible
        to all the scramblers and is checked. Perhaps a head-scrambler can do
        this quick check. In the event of an incorrect scramble, it should be
        solved and re-scrmabled; I always assumed this was already the case.
        Correct me if I'm wrong. Another thing I just thought of: There have
        been at least 2 times, at different competions where I got the same
        scramble twice in a row... we need more safegaurds in place for this not
        to happen as much. -Doug

        from me (like by 8 &gt; inches!) and "fixing" the orientation so it's
        squared up to the mat. Yes, that did happen to me in a competition, too.
        And the worst thing about it was not the fraction of a second I need
        more to reach the cube, but the psychological effect. It's very much
        disrupting my concentration, and I kept thinking about it and the
        bastard judge through out the solve. For that reason, I suggest
        supporting this:
        http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=180 &gt;
        Someone talked abut the 3s we get to figure &gt; out the orientation,
        before a 2s penalty. Well I'd rather spend &gt; those 3s examining other
        things to get as much of an "edge" as I &gt; can That's cheating, and
        it's not what those 3s are intended for. &gt; I would even take it a
        step further, and stipulate in &gt; the rules for BLD that you are
        allowed to request a specific &gt; orientation given to you. That's
        unnatural. If you ask Joe Normal-Person to scramble the cube for you,
        he'll most probably not care about the cube orientation. Also, like
        Gilles Roux already mentioned, there are several ways to define specific
        cube orientations. Some people might take the centers as reference,
        others might take a corner as reference. If someone requests yellow
        center on top and orange center on front, someone else must be allowed
        to request the white/red/green corner to be at down/back/left. I'd vote
        for computer-random cube-orientations (i.e. pick one of the 24 whole
        cube orientations). And applied *before* the scramble algorithm. Cheers!

        So running into parity as a matter of luck or randomness is acceptable,
        but randomness in starting cube orientation is not? One affects your
        time by a lot, the orientation issue only takes you about 2 seconds of
        inspection time to fix. As far as I've observed, the majority of
        competitors don't take the full 15 seconds of preinspection anyway, and
        this doesn't affect their actual solve time, whereas parities or lucky
        last layers do. As for blindfolding, a random starting orientation is
        the most fair. If everyone starts with the same orientation, some people
        will never have to turn the cube, some people will always have to spend
        that extra second (I'm weird and solve with yellow top, orange front),
        even if they already know what the orientation will be. The only fair
        way is to give everyone the same chance of getting their preferred
        orientation. Trying to guarantee a constant orientation for everyone is
        too hard. Cubes get shuffled around too much on the scrambling table,
        especially in very busy rounds. At the Caltech tournaments, our method
        of randomizing orientation after scrambling is usually to just toss the
        cube in the air so that it spins a few times, then catch it and put it
        under the cover. Shelley --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi guys, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, we are debating
        this (I think) minor issue as if it were a &gt; major &gt; &gt; problem
        of mankind. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fran√ßois, I agree with you that it would
        be perfect if we could &gt; make &gt; &gt; the circumstances 100% the
        same for all competitors. &gt; &gt; So it would better if all
        competitors have the same scramble and &gt; the &gt; &gt; same
        orientation, than the same scramble and a random orientation. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; IMHO there are currently too many things that can go wrong to
        &gt; &gt; guarantee the same orientation for blindfolded solving. &gt;
        &gt; Some examples: &gt; &gt; - scrambler puts down the puzzle in a
        different way under the cover &gt; &gt; - when "organising" the
        scrambled puzzles on the table, someone &gt; &gt; accidentally rotates a
        puzzle or cover &gt; &gt; - when picking up the puzzle, the judge
        rotates the puzzle (he is &gt; &gt; often seeing the covers/puzzles from
        a different angle) &gt; &gt; - when transporting the puzzle, the puzzle
        is rotated under the &gt; cover &gt; &gt; - when putting down the
        puzzle, the puzzle is rotated under the &gt; cover &gt; &gt; or with the
        cover &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The biggest improvement I think we could make
        is to have a puzzle &gt; &gt; cover that: &gt; &gt; - perfectly fits the
        3x3 cube (so no rotation is possible under the &gt; &gt; cover) &gt;
        &gt; - has colors on the outside that show how to place the puzzle under
        &gt; &gt; the cover, and how to position the puzzle on the Stackmat &gt;
        &gt; Then we leave 5% chance of failure, in case of ignorance or mistake
        &gt; &gt; by scrambler/judge or if there are too few covers for the &gt;
        &gt; competition. Chance of failure increases if a competitor uses a
        &gt; &gt; different color scheme. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If someone can
        make this cover for a cheap price then I can &gt; guarantee &gt; &gt;
        that we will use it and change the regulations. &gt; &gt; If not, then
        let us forget about it and just for this one time &gt; &gt; believe me
        that it is not manageable. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a side note: would it
        not be the fairest if there would be only &gt; &gt; one cube that we
        were allowed to use in a competition, and that we &gt; &gt; would need
        to solve the same scramble all the time, with a standard &gt; &gt;
        orientation? And all competitors must use the same system, and &gt;
        start &gt; &gt; with the same color. That would be perfect! (Although
        very &gt; boring...) &gt; &gt; In Belgian Open 2007 I think I had 8
        parities in 4x4. One other &gt; &gt; competitor told me he had 0
        parities. Now that is unfair! :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have fun, &gt;

        parities on 4x4x4 &gt; is just luck/random. One could argue that after

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi guys, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, we are debating
        this (I think) minor issue as if it were a &gt; major &gt; &gt; problem
        of mankind. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fran√ßois, I agree with you that it would
        be perfect if we could &gt; make &gt; &gt; the circumstances 100% the
        same for all competitors. &gt; &gt; So it would better if all
        competitors have the same scramble and &gt; the &gt; &gt; same
        orientation, than the same scramble and a random orientation. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; IMHO there are currently too many things that can go wrong to
        &gt; &gt; guarantee the same orientation for blindfolded solving. &gt;
        &gt; Some examples: &gt; &gt; - scrambler puts down the puzzle in a
        different way under the cover &gt; &gt; - when "organising" the
        scrambled puzzles on the table, someone &gt; &gt; accidentally rotates a
        puzzle or cover &gt; &gt; - when picking up the puzzle, the judge
        rotates the puzzle (he is &gt; &gt; often seeing the covers/puzzles from
        a different angle) &gt; &gt; - when transporting the puzzle, the puzzle
        is rotated under the &gt; cover &gt; &gt; - when putting down the
        puzzle, the puzzle is rotated under the &gt; cover &gt; &gt; or with the
        cover &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The biggest improvement I think we could make
        is to have a puzzle &gt; &gt; cover that: &gt; &gt; - perfectly fits the
        3x3 cube (so no rotation is possible under the &gt; &gt; cover) &gt;
        &gt; - has colors on the outside that show how to place the puzzle under
        &gt; &gt; the cover, and how to position the puzzle on the Stackmat &gt;
        &gt; Then we leave 5% chance of failure, in case of ignorance or mistake
        &gt; &gt; by scrambler/judge or if there are too few covers for the &gt;
        &gt; competition. Chance of failure increases if a competitor uses a
        &gt; &gt; different color scheme. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If someone can
        make this cover for a cheap price then I can &gt; guarantee &gt; &gt;
        that we will use it and change the regulations. &gt; &gt; If not, then
        let us forget about it and just for this one time &gt; &gt; believe me
        that it is not manageable. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a side note: would it
        not be the fairest if there would be only &gt; &gt; one cube that we
        were allowed to use in a competition, and that we &gt; &gt; would need
        to solve the same scramble all the time, with a standard &gt; &gt;
        orientation? And all competitors must use the same system, and &gt;
        start &gt; &gt; with the same color. That would be perfect! (Although
        very &gt; boring...) &gt; &gt; In Belgian Open 2007 I think I had 8
        parities in 4x4. One other &gt; &gt; competitor told me he had 0
        parities. Now that is unfair! :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have fun, &gt;

        Quoting myself, just to make my last post more friedly... what I mean
        is...if you can tell the scramblers to scramble the cube with a certain

        that orientation...I can't see what would make it so hard, or even

        scrambling cubes with the same orientation is equal for everyone, while
        handing them in random orientations is not. It¬ís not coherent. If you
        want to make it random, make it random all the way, or not at all. And
        I¬ím not really getting the point of what you said: why should I bother
        looking that the guy is doing y2x¬í when I know I¬íll have to do y2x¬í, for a
        set ¬ìtable orientation¬î? If I know they¬íll be giving me the cube with
        yellow front and green top, I know I¬íll have to do x¬í, and I can practice
        at home in this fashion, picking up the cube while doing x¬í. If it¬ís set,
        no one will get lucky or unlucky, because it¬íll be the same for every
        single cube you¬íll ever solve in competition. But if I don¬ít know, maybe
        I¬íll be advantaged, and maybe not, but for sure, if I get a 1:21 bld
        solve with an unlucky orientation at the beginning, I¬íll be pretty
        pissed. It all looks to me like when we first chose the stackmat as the
        official timing device, the point was, we do count the time to pick up
        and drop the cube, you just have to practice at home so you¬íre used to
        picking it up fast and dropping it down quickly. Here, you just have to
        be doing whatever xyz you need very quickly, during the motion to lift
        the cube. But really my main point here is the coherence between
        scrambling and starting orientations. Whatever is chosen has to be
        coherent, and I don¬ít feel it is very logical as it is now. F. De :

        orientation? I actually think that using a set starting orientation for
        each scramble increases the unfairness factor. More specifically, the
        "unlucky" cubers who go first. For example, i know that many of the
        cubers use the same white cross to start. So i if i don't go first, i am
        happy. I watch someone that i know uses the same starting face color and
        see they had to waste the 1 second doing a y2 x'. And then when i go up
        there, i know what i have to do without even looking at the cube. I
        should be able to do it in one motion as i pick up the cube, almost
        eliminating the delay altogether. Whereas if it is just a total random
        orientation, we all have an equal chance of getting it in a good
        position, and an equal chance of having it in a bad position. -Dave

        Learn F2L, i.e. first two layers by putting in a corner and a middle

        middle layer edge into a pair, and then you insert the pair. There's

        intuitive approach, and try to find out yourself. Michiel

        I'm not sure everyone is talking about the same thing. There are two
        separate moments. 1. When the judge reveals the cube for the start of

        Hey! This is the first time posting on this group, but I have been
        reading it frequently. I'm glad to finally join and be a part of it (not
        sure why I didn't earlier.) Cubesmith is very legitimate. Your stickers
        WILL come. I contacted him at a secondary email I found, and I asked why
        he hadn't responded to my inquires and asked if his cubesmith email was
        down. He replied with, "My Cubesmith email is indeed down at the
        moment." It may take longer to receive your order, but, he WILL get it
        done. The stickers are INCREDIBLE quality, and it's worth the wait. This
        is not his only job, and he does this on his spare time. I had quite the
        large order, and mine did take quite a while, but rest assured, they did
        come exactly as ordered. He's having problems with his plotter, and he's
        getting them done as soon as he can. I will give his secondary email
        here at his permission (I'll ask him). Yasin (and everyone else), you
        WILL get the stickers. Just be patient guys, he is working on them, and
        your stickers will come. Hope that helps! Mike --- In

        the judge for (1) and &gt; by the competitor however s/he wants to start
        out for (2).

        I learned the last layer algorithms from Lars Vandenberg's page.
        http://www.cubezone.be/ Just click "oll" or "pll" at the top of the
        page. Keep in mind that on oll you can still use frur'u'f' or furu'r'f'
        to get the cross, then use one of seven algorithms to solve the oll.
        This is called the 3-look ll. Once you get those 7 algs down, you can
        slowly expand it until you know all of them. About the f2l, I suggest
        you learn it intuitively, and slowly.
        http://www.freespaces.com/jasa86/intro_f2l_intro.htm This helped me a
        lot. I do not suggest you simply memorize notation for f2l, but be able
        to recognize how to pair up the two cubies and insert them without
        having to recall a certain algorithm. Go slowly and look ahead so you
        can make a nearly flawless fluid movement during the f2l, even if you
        have to go 1 move per second or so. This will definitely help in the
        long run!! Don't expect to get this step down in a week- it might take a
        while to get it down to 2-3 moves per sec. Don't expect perfection every
        time. Go slowly on the f2l and work on muscle memory for the last layer.
        Also constantly work on looking ahead, which will decrease your time in
        the future. Have fun memorizing! lol ~Joshua --- In

        I agree with lars. If you really want to get the best solve you look at
        all the pieces. This would just convince beginners to learn how to solve
        it using colors other than white in order to get a better solve. It's
        their fault for using one color scheme, and just let it be if they don't
        get the lucky solve. I am in favor of random orientation, because it
        shows who can really solve the cube the fastest, in ANY orientation. I
        see everyone's point on fairness, but does it really matter whether
        someone will use a certain color (white) or whether they will look at
        the whole cube to find the best starting place? They will both probably
        have to move the cube around anyways to find the pieces for the first
        step, depending on the methods. ~Joshua --- In

        During the 15 second &gt; inspection I would look at all the pieces of

        same angle? &gt; &gt; I guess that would make things a very tiny bit
        more equal, but way &gt; beyond anything I would care about. &gt; &gt;
        Especially since everybody *would* have the same chance to get lucky,

        Hey, I agree completely. I own a studio cube, and I personally think
        it's quite poor. I've ordered from cube4you, and 9spuzzles, and I
        recommend 9spuzzles just because they're cheaper. I find them to be
        perfect for my needs. They're smooth right out of the box, and after
        lubricant they're even better. I'd go with the black or white type A
        cubes. I've heard C is good from cube4you, but I haven't tried them
        myself. If you're going to lube it (this has been said thousands of
        times, but might as well say it again) use some kind of silicone
        lubricant. I recommend CRC heavy duty lubricant shown here:
        http://www.idealtruevalue.com/servlet/the-41131/Detail . It's my
        favorite. For some reason,
        http://www.crcindustries.com/catalog/images/Lubricant%20and%20Penetrant/05074.jpg
        this CRC turned my black DIY cubes a bit white. I've heard this from
        other people, so if you have the option, try to get the kind that has a
        black "gradient" like the first link. Hopefully that helps, Cheers, Mike

        What do you mean by "never showed up either"? I assume it DID show up or
        you wouldn't have ordered again. Did I read this wrong? I don't mind
        waiting 2 weeks. I live in Texas, so I thought it would be faster. I
        look forward to getting them. Thanks to everyone for their comments on
        this issue. Alfredo --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Tim

        Try starting by solving the F2L intuitively. Almost every F2L alg can be
        divided up into smaller parts that are very easily understood once you
        understand the general concept. Once you can do the F2L intuitively, the
        algs should be much easier to memorize, and if you still have trouble,
        what you can do is just learn the sequence of tasks that each one
        performs, so that you're still doing it intuitively, but more optimized.
        Doug Reed has a great intuitive F2L page.

        Hi Chris, Sounds fantastic! I don't care about prizes or a personal
        sponsor. I personally do care about: - possibility to meet many (&gt;75)
        other cubers - a good quality field of competitors - my favorite events
        (3/4/5) - 2 day competition - nice entourage/atmosphere - some side
        stuff, like a puzzle market, informal meetings - last but not least: my
        family (so please announce 4 months early at least, then I can plan
        better) As a WCA guy I care about: - officialness - a good organization
        team (the fewer volunteers, the better) - lots of media attention - a
        good name, something like Microsoft World Masters 2007 - but not too
        commercial (to pay some people's trip is up to the sponsors, but how do
        you select fairly?) - annual event for at least 3 years - visa arranged
        within a day for all countries (especially countries like India, China

        Hi Chris, I also don't care about the prize, but for me to go I think it
        would either need to be a big enough event to justify my current
        sponsors paying my airfare/acommodation, or I would need to be a big
        enough name to warrant your sponsors paying for my airfare. Somehow I
        don't think I'll pull the second one off ;) But what you are planning
        sounds fantastic, and I would love to be a part of it. If I can help in
        any way also, don't hesitate to let me know. DanH :) --- In

        &gt; &gt; I don't care about prizes or a personal sponsor. &gt; I
        personally do care about: &gt; - possibility to meet many (&gt;75) other
        cubers &gt; - a good quality field of competitors &gt; - my favorite
        events (3/4/5) &gt; - 2 day competition &gt; - nice entourage/atmosphere
        &gt; - some side stuff, like a puzzle market, informal meetings &gt; -
        last but not least: my family (so please announce 4 months early at
        least, &gt; then I can plan better) &gt; As a WCA guy I care about: &gt;
        - officialness &gt; - a good organization team (the fewer volunteers,
        the better) &gt; - lots of media attention &gt; - a good name, something
        like Microsoft World Masters 2007 &gt; - but not too commercial (to pay
        some people's trip is up to the sponsors, &gt; but how do you select
        fairly?) &gt; - annual event for at least 3 years &gt; - visa arranged
        within a day for all countries (especially countries like &gt; India,
        China et cetera) &gt; &gt; How can I help you? :-) &gt; &gt; Have fun,

        As a poor student, I'd care a bit on the prize money, but also if there
        is a good atmosphere, lot's of very fast cubers. A multiple-day tournamt
        of course. Good accomodation (tournament hall and maybe hotel?) and
        organisation (I don't like to have to wait 5 min between each solve). A
        bit of audience would be nice too. It'd be great of this would become a

        I think most people would agree that the orientation is only an issue
        for bld where you don't get 15 s inspection. And it wouldn't be hard for
        judges to try to keep all the cubes for a given scramble oriented the
        same but it would be difficult to guarantee. People have already
        mentioned several judging blunders (it might be in the parallel thread
        about this issue) that it would just be another thing that we'd end up
        getting complaints about. --------------------------------- Don't pick

        hey chris, i think a tournament would be horrible especially with all
        the interest from big sponsors. haha jk..... it sounds almost too go to
        be true but i really think ron hit it on the head a. lots of
        competitiors without sacrificing rounds or events based on whats is
        convienient for the venue or media, cubers first! b. all events will
        full rounds, no scimping on less popular puzzles, probably means at
        least a 2 day event. c. a puzzle fair like dcd would be an incredible
        bonus. d. the possibility of meeting cubers i don't normally have the
        chance (ie YJM, and other asian cubers i will never meet) e. ease for
        competitiors around the world to come to including visa issues and the
        like f. good hotel sponsorship so maybe we can at least get cheap
        lodging if we're unable to get sponsors. g. for you to tell us exactly
        what is going on and who's interested :P

        Hello Everyone, Just a little heads up to let you know that I am still
        alive and all your orders are safe, just a little behind schedule right
        now. Personal issues with my family along with the equipment problems
        last month have taken a toll on my shipping schedule for both Cubesmith
        and my other company. I'm planning to update the site this weekend to
        let everyone know the situation. Also in the works is a new shipping
        method which will provide a little bit of tracking, at least for orders
        in the US, and offer better protection during shipment. Thanks for
        everyones patience, Chris www.cubesmith.com --- In

        Well, I ordered in October 2005, and it hasn't arrived yet. My

        Thank you everyone for your input so far, it's much appreciated. This
        multi-day event is in the planning for late 2008 or maybe even 2009. I
        don't want to conflict with the current scheduling of the international
        competition. I'm just trying to gauge how many people would be
        interested in attending an event of this size and what accommodations,
        competitions, time constraints, extra activities, ... etc people are
        interested in having. I'm working on a survey now and when it's
        complete, I would like as many of you as possible to reply with your
        opinions. I want to make this a well-attended, fun, exciting, and
        memorable experience that we can look forward to attending each year.
        With enough interest, a non-profit organization, and all the potential
        sponsors in the Seattle area, big things are possible. Right now we're
        just throwing around the idea and seeing if something like this could
        draw national and international competitors. It would be a tremendous
        amount of fun and a great get-together. :) I'll post again when I have a
        survey so we can organize everyone's input. Thanks, -Chris [Non-text

        I would also like to respond: 1) Why should all competitors have the
        same amount of attempts? That is definately not how it works for bigger
        cubes, where only the fastest can attempt all scrambles and those
        competitions only have 1 round! I think 5 solves are enough, even at the
        final. We are already correcting for lucky cases and screw-ups/pops,
        most other sports don't do that! 2) I would prefer a final with only the
        very best (top 5 or top 10%) competing directly against each other. For
        a big tournament like Worlds, this is how I would like it to happen: a1)
        Competitors ranked 9-16 (during semi-final) are called to the stage and
        all their pre-inspections start at once. Off course competitors can
        choose how much of their 15 secondes for pre-inspection they use, so the
        actual start of all solves cannot be controlled to occur at exactly the
        same time. a2) All times from the first 8 competitors will be shown on a
        scoreboard for the audience/media and a3) Same as a1, only for the
        competitors ranked 1-8 (during semi-final) a4) Same as a2, only for the
        competitors ranked 1-8 (during semi-final) b) Repeat a 4 times, and
        update she scoreboard to reflect current rankings so the audience (and
        media) can see who is in the lead The advantage of this would be that it
        looks much more organized and professional and competitors actually
        compete against each other. Scrambling and judging would take almost no
        extra time. An option would be to change the order of competitors
        according to their current ranking, but that would affect the scramblers
        because some cubers might cross-over from the second group to the first
        group, having to do 2 solves directly after another. ----- Original

        points: 1) if we have more attempts, ALL competitors should have more
        attempts 2) in special competitions like World Championship the final
        cannot take ages, because we have to think of our sponsors (and
        therefore of the media). I prefer to have more people in the final than
        the proposal to make the final longer by doing more attempts per
        competitor. 3) deciding the winner on the proposed measurements has
        flaws. Please react to these three points. Have fun, Ron ----- Original

        average of 12? &gt; I'm sorry, but I have to get in on this one and give
        my opinion about &gt; this. &gt;&gt; The main reason why I am personally
        against 12 solves in a final is easy. &gt;&gt;The WCA is there for ALL
        competitors, not for the FASTEST competitors. &gt; &gt;Remember our
        mission is: more competitions in more countries with more &gt;
        &gt;people and more fun, under fair conditions. &gt; &gt;So if we should
        add attempts, then I think we should add them for all
        &gt;&gt;competitors, not only the finalists. &gt; &gt; How would making
        the final avg 12 solves decrease the amount from each &gt; country? I
        don't think that would have the slightest impact on it. I &gt; also
        don't see how this would be unfair. The fairness would remain the &gt;
        same. The representation of the performance of each solver in the final
        &gt; would be improved. And increasing the avg among all rounds is great
        too, &gt; just improves the accuracy, however, it isn't nescessary (nor
        is the &gt; "plan" I am talking about on throughout this post). &gt;
        &gt;&gt;We have to run a final in 30 minutes. The media are not planning
        to stay &gt;&gt;for &gt;&gt;hours. &gt;&gt;We want to show them
        blindfolded final, then 3x3 final, then they go &gt;&gt;again.
        &gt;&gt;And we will be on the news in the evening. &gt; &gt; Woah, wait
        a sec. Are we basing the way an event occurs off what the &gt; media
        needs/wants? I personally think that the event should occur, &gt;
        regardless of media, and then media comes afterward. The time the media
        &gt; "plans" to stay should be irrelevant. I sure hope that
        speed-solving &gt; events don't begin to revolve around the media the
        slightest. &gt; &gt;&gt; Overall competition average: DNF. &gt; &gt; I
        don't understand that logic. &gt; &gt; Lastly, I just want to give you
        my opinion on this. Make 12 solves in the &gt; final would basically
        just give more representation to how well a solver &gt; performs. 5 is a
        low amount to average by, and yes, it works fine as it &gt; is. But to
        give a more accurate representation to who really is the best &gt; at
        any given event would be to increase the amount of solves, 12 happens
        &gt; to be a good number. &gt; &gt; -Pat &gt; &gt; Ron van Bruchem

        12 attempts, or &gt; 16 &gt; competitors with 5 attempts. &gt; I prefer
        the latter. &gt; &gt; About accepting all solves of a competition for
        the end result. &gt; Last week I won a local competition with the
        following results: &gt; 1st round: 10.00 10.00 10.00 10.00 DNF: average
        10.00 seconds &gt; semi final: 10.00 10.00 10.00 10.00 DNF: average
        10.00 seconds &gt; final: 10.00 10.00 10.00 10.00 DNF: average 10.00
        seconds &gt; Overall competition average: DNF. &gt; Any other method:
        finals would be boooooooooooooooooring. &gt; &gt; The winner is the one
        who wins the final. Like Rune said: the pressure in &gt; semi final is
        different. &gt; &gt; Have fun, &gt; &gt; Ron &gt; &gt; ----- Original

        rules - average of 12? &gt; &gt; I remember thinking that, after days
        (or even years) of buildup &gt; leading to the finals of WC2005 in
        Orlando, the finals seemed to go by &gt; in the blink of an eye. &gt;
        &gt; I've always thought that 5 solves is too few in the finals and I'd
        &gt; really like to see it change to an average of 12. Two good solves
        (or &gt; two bad ones) wouldn't affect an average of 12 nearly as
        dramatically &gt; as they would affect an average of 5. &gt; &gt; I know
        this means that the finals will take longer than they currently &gt; do
        but I don't think it would take too much longer since the 3x3 is &gt;
        quick to scramble and quick to solve (espeically by the caliber of &gt;
        finalist that we have today). Further, the 3x3 is the main event in &gt;
        every tournament so I'd be okay with the 3x3 event getting even more
        &gt; time in tournaments. &gt; &gt; I have e-mailed Ron privately about
        this and I know he's against it. &gt; Anyone else have thoughts on an
        average of 12 in the finals? &gt; &gt; Ian &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hello everyone, I will leave my small home country (Switzerland) for 6
        months next tuesday and I will stay in the Pasadena area during this
        time. I was wondering if any weekly/monthly cubing meeting takes place
        at Caltech. I am really looking forward to finally meet some american
        cubers and I hope I can learn a lot from you guys. See "some of you"

        them and wishes to sell one of the best : the one he has won in the
        Belgian open one month ago for his fabulous new world record with 10.36
        , I was there Smile . He has signed it Exclamation Exclamation , what
        does a signature of a world recordman worth ? answer in a few days

        KNOW THIS &gt; MAN! &gt; &gt; He was by far the most remarkable man that
        ever set foot on this &gt; earth. He preached a religion, founded a
        state, built a nation, laid &gt; down a moral code, initiated numberless
        social and political reforms, &gt; established a dynamic and powerful
        society to practice and represent &gt; his teachings, and completely
        revolutionized the worlds of human &gt; thought and action for all times
        to come. &gt; &gt; HIS NAME IS MUHAMMAD, peace and blessings of Almighty
        God be upon him &gt; and he accomplished all these wonders in the
        unbelievably short span &gt; of twenty-three years. &gt; &gt; Muhammad,
        peace and blessings of God Almighty be upon him was born in &gt; Arabia
        on the 20th of August, in the year 570 of the Christian era, &gt; and
        when he died after 63 years, the whole of the Arabian Peninsula &gt; had
        changed from paganism and idol-worship to the worship of One God; &gt;
        from tribal quarrels and wars to national solidarity and cohesion; &gt;
        from drunkenness and debauchery to sobriety and piety; from &gt;
        lawlessness and anarchy to disciplined living; from utter moral &gt;
        bankruptcy to the highest standards of moral excellence. Human &gt;
        history has never known such a complete transformation of a people or
        &gt; a place before or since! &gt; &gt; The Encyclopedia Britannica
        calls him "the most successful of all &gt; religious personalities of
        the world". Bernard Shaw said about him &gt; that if Muhammad were alive
        today he would succeed in solving all &gt; those problems which threaten
        to destroy human civilization in our &gt; times. Thomas Carlysle was
        simply amazed as to how one man, single- &gt; handedly, could weld
        warring tribes and wandering Bedouins into a &gt; most powerful and
        civilized nation in less than two decades. Napoleon &gt; and Gandhi
        never tired of dreaming of a society along the lines &gt; established by
        this man in Arabia fourteen centuries ago. &gt; &gt; Indeed no other
        human being ever accomplished so much, in such &gt; diverse fields of
        human thought and behavior, in so limited a space &gt; of time, as did
        Muhammad, peace and blessings of God Almighty be upon &gt; him. He was a
        religious teacher, a social reformer, a moral guide, a &gt; political
        thinker, a military genius, an administrative colossus, a &gt; faithful
        friend, a wonderful companion, a devoted husband, a loving &gt; father -
        all in one. No other man in history ever excelled or equaled &gt; him in
        any of these difficult departments of life. &gt; &gt; The world has had
        its share of great personalities. But these were &gt; one sided figures
        who distinguished themselves in but one or two &gt; fields such as
        religious thought or military leadership. None of the &gt; other great
        leaders of the world ever combined in himself so many &gt; different
        qualities to such an amazing level of perfection as did &gt; Muhammad,
        peace and blessings of God Almighty be upon him. &gt; &gt; The lives and
        teachings of other great personalities of the world are &gt; shrouded in
        the mist of time. There is so much speculation about the &gt; time and
        the place of their birth, the mode and style of their life, &gt; the
        nature and detail of their teachings and the degree and measure &gt; of
        their success or failure that it is impossible for humanity today &gt;
        to reconstruct accurately and precisely the lives and teachings of &gt;
        those men. &gt; &gt; Not so this man Muhammad, peace and blessings of
        God Almighty be upon &gt; him. Not only was he born in the fullest blaze
        of recorded history, &gt; but every detail of his private and public
        life, of his actions and &gt; utterances, has been accurately documented
        and faithfully preserved &gt; to our day. The authenticity of the
        information so preserved is &gt; vouched for not only by faithful
        followers but also by unbiased &gt; critics and open-minded scholars.
        &gt; &gt; At the level of ideas there is no system of thought and
        belief- &gt; secular or religious, social or political-which could
        surpass or &gt; equal ISLAAM- the system which Muhammad peace and
        blessings of God &gt; Almighty be upon him propounded. In a fast
        changing world, while &gt; other systems have undergone profound
        transformations, Islaam alone &gt; has remained above all change and
        mutation, and retained its original &gt; form for the past 1400 years.
        What is more, the positive changes that &gt; are taking place in the
        world of human thought and behavior, truly &gt; and consistently reflect
        the healthy influence of Islam in these &gt; areas. Further, it is not
        given to the best of thinkers to put their &gt; ideas completely into
        practice, and to see the seeds of their labors &gt; grow and bear fruit,
        in their own lifetime. Except of course, &gt; Muhammad, peace and
        blessings of God Almighty be upon him, who not &gt; only preached the
        most wonderful ideas but also successfully &gt; translated each one of
        them into practice in his own lifetime. At the &gt; time of his death
        his teachings were not mere precepts and ideas &gt; straining for
        fulfillment, but had become the very core of the life &gt; of tens of
        thousands of perfectly trained individuals, each one of &gt; whom was a
        marvelous personification of everything that Muhammad &gt; peace and
        blessings of God Almighty be upon him taught and stood for. &gt; At what
        other time or place and in relation to what other political, &gt;
        social, religious system, philosophy or ideology-did the world ever &gt;
        witness such a perfectly amazing phenomenon? &gt; &gt; Indeed no other
        system or ideology secular or religious, social or &gt; political,
        ancient or modern - could ever claim the distinction of &gt; having been
        put into practice in its fullness and entirety EVEN ONCE &gt; in this
        world, either before or after the death of its founder. &gt; Except of
        course ISLAAM, the ideology preached by Muhammad, peace and &gt;
        blessings of God Almighty be upon him which was established as a &gt;
        complete way of life by the teacher himself, before he departed from
        &gt; this world. History bears testimony to this fact and the greatest
        &gt; skeptics have no option but to concede this point. &gt; &gt; In
        spite of these amazing achievements and in spite of the countless &gt;
        absolutely convincing and authentic miracles performed by him and the
        &gt; phenomenal success which crowned his efforts, he did not for a
        moment &gt; claim to be God or God's incarnation or Son - but only a
        human being &gt; who was chosen and ordained by God to be a teacher of
        truth to man &gt; kind and a complete model and pattern for their
        actions. &gt; &gt; He was nothing more or less than a human being. But
        he was a man with &gt; a noble and exalted mission-and his unique
        mission was to unite &gt; humanity on the worship of ONE AND ONLY GOD
        and to teach them the way &gt; to honest and upright living in
        accordance with the laws and commands &gt; of God. He always described
        himself as A MESSENGER AND SERVANT OF &gt; GOD, and so indeed every
        single action and movement of his proclaimed &gt; him to be. &gt; &gt; A
        world which has not hesitated to raise to Divinity individuals &gt;
        whose very lives and missions have been lost in legend and who &gt;
        historically speaking did not accomplish half as much-or even one &gt;
        tenth-as was accomplished by Muhammad, peace and blessings of God &gt;
        Almighty be upon him should stop to take serious note of this &gt;
        remarkable man's claim to be God's messenger to mankind. &gt; &gt; Today
        after the lapse of some 1400 years the life and teachings of &gt;
        Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings of God Almighty be upon him, &gt;
        have survived without the slightest loss, alteration or &gt;
        interpolation. Today they offer the same undying hope for treating &gt;
        mankind's many ills which they did when Prophet Muhammad, peace and &gt;
        blessings of God Almighty be upon him, was alive. This is our honest
        &gt; claim and this is the inescapable conclusion forced upon us by a
        &gt; critical and unbiased study of history. &gt; &gt; The least YOU
        should do as a thinking, sensitive, concerned human &gt; being is to
        stop for one brief moment and ask yourself: Could it be &gt; that these
        statements, extraordinary and revolutionary as they sound, &gt; are
        really true? Supposing they really are true, and you did not know &gt;
        this man Muhammad, peace and blessings of God Almighty be upon him or
        &gt; hear about his teachings? Or did not know him well and intimately
        &gt; enough to be able to benefit from his guidance and example? Isn't
        it &gt; time you responded to this tremendous challenge and made some
        effort &gt; to know him? It will not cost you anything but it may well
        prove to &gt; be the beginning of a completely new era in your life.
        &gt; &gt; Come, let us make a new discovery of the life of this
        wonderful man &gt; Muhammad, peace and blessings of God Almighty be upon
        him the like of &gt; whom never walked on this earth, and whose example
        and teachings can &gt; change YOUR LIFE and OUR WORLD for the better.

      <div class="email-content">
        Following the Chattahoochee competition I decide to write this, and then
        to share with you all. It is hard sometimes to look back at performance
        at cube tournaments. Before the competition, I practice with an inspired
        vigor. I tell myself: "I hope this competition is going to be
        different." But, different how? Not all of us produce the results we
        expect or hope for. If this happens once, or twice, it is easier to give
        ourselves the benefit of the doubt: "I just had an off tournament. It
        happens to best of them." Then suddenly, we realize: "Damn, my 'off
        tournaments' are actually my normal tournaments." But still, before
        every one, I tell myself, like others may do: "I hope this competition
        is going to be different." It's going to be different because I'm going
        to do well. I'm going to do well because I prepared. And this tragic
        cycle begins to emerge, and I feel that my efforts are not realized.
        Then, "I hope this competition is going to be different," turns into,
        "Why do I bother with this competition?" It's hard to have a positive
        attitude 100% of the time following failure, unless you're not human.
        Then I look at the ones who completely swamped my times. And, I ask:
        "Who the hell are these people?" I have competed seriously for years,
        and these guys are surpassing my greatest efforts after a fraction of
        the time. I feel like an ounce of talent would take me a long way - or
        it is my excuse for these failures. I just don't know how they manage
        such fantastic results. Ladies and gentleman, Richard Patterson is
        filled with a lot of envy. I would never undermine the effort of others,
        but the ratio of time put in and results produced seems off balance. I
        often find myself fighting this impossible war against the next wave of
        'better than me' cubers. It's easy to drown in these feelings of doubt
        in the midst of performing. Worst of all, this horrible seed can grow
        into something quite terrible, effecting numerous events. "Why did I
        come again?" Great question. Again, expanded: "Why did I take time to
        prepare for, and attend to this event?" It had been just long enough
        since the last tournament to forget the answer to this question. I'm
        glad though, I realize it at the right time usually: "I like these
        people." Our opponents are often our friends. And, the whole time we
        eagerly applaud the same times that are going to bump us lower in the
        rankings. The same ones that inspired a bitter envy often share the same
        sour taste of defeat. A pat on the back after a good time - A pat on the
        back after a bad time. We're all friends here. A feeling which I would
        like to relate; I have had the interesting pleasure to make my 3x3
        blindfold attempts in tandem with Chris Hardwick's 5x5 blindfold
        attempts. These attempts, almost inevitably, produce World Records. And
        he can, and must, do this while I am in the middle of my solves. This is
        annoying, not because I am blindfolded and solving - It is annoying
        because I am blindfolded and cannot see his accomplishment (and I'd
        rather not stop to applaud and risk further encouragment of my 0%
        completion rate for blindfold solving). This is the first true
        reflection I've had on these feelings. I won't say anymore: "I hope this
        competition is going to be different." Instead: "I hope this competition
        is going to be the same as others." I hope that I continue to try my
        best. I hope that I continue to find pleasure in the successes of my
        friends. I hope I prepare better for the next one. :) I applaud the
        achievements of all of you. But, I think the least important part of
        these competitions is that which we find in the results. Best Regards,
        Richard Patterson

        Hi guys! I'm really new on speedcubing (started 2 weeks ago). I'm using
        the layer method and taking about 1 min and a half to solve the cube. I

        Don't worry about the 15 seconds for now. Just take your time trying to
        find the shortest solution you can. The cross is almost always solvable

        One thing I sometimes do, is look at the cube, then solve the cross with
        my eyes closed. This helps me not have to look at the pieces when trying
        to solve it. Then you do it with your eyes open, but look for the first

        11:42 AM Subject: [Speed cubing group] Some Thoughts... Following the
        Chattahoochee competition I decide to write this, and then to share with
        you all. It is hard sometimes to look back at performance at cube
        tournaments. Before the competition, I practice with an inspired vigor.
        I tell myself: "I hope this competition is going to be different." But,
        different how? Not all of us produce the results we expect or hope for.
        If this happens once, or twice, it is easier to give ourselves the
        benefit of the doubt: "I just had an off tournament. It happens to best
        of them." Then suddenly, we realize: "Damn, my 'off tournaments' are
        actually my normal tournaments." But still, before every one, I tell
        myself, like others may do: "I hope this competition is going to be
        different." It's going to be different because I'm going to do well. I'm
        going to do well because I prepared. And this tragic cycle begins to
        emerge, and I feel that my efforts are not realized. Then, "I hope this
        competition is going to be different," turns into, "Why do I bother with
        this competition?" It's hard to have a positive attitude 100% of the
        time following failure, unless you're not human. Then I look at the ones
        who completely swamped my times. And, I ask: "Who the hell are these
        people?" I have competed seriously for years, and these guys are
        surpassing my greatest efforts after a fraction of the time. I feel like
        an ounce of talent would take me a long way - or it is my excuse for
        these failures. I just don't know how they manage such fantastic
        results. Ladies and gentleman, Richard Patterson is filled with a lot of
        envy. I would never undermine the effort of others, but the ratio of
        time put in and results produced seems off balance. I often find myself
        fighting this impossible war against the next wave of 'better than me'
        cubers. It's easy to drown in these feelings of doubt in the midst of
        performing. Worst of all, this horrible seed can grow into something
        quite terrible, effecting numerous events. "Why did I come again?" Great
        question. Again, expanded: "Why did I take time to prepare for, and
        attend to this event?" It had been just long enough since the last
        tournament to forget the answer to this question. I'm glad though, I
        realize it at the right time usually: "I like these people." Our
        opponents are often our friends. And, the whole time we eagerly applaud
        the same times that are going to bump us lower in the rankings. The same
        ones that inspired a bitter envy often share the same sour taste of
        defeat. A pat on the back after a good time - A pat on the back after a
        bad time. We're all friends here. A feeling which I would like to
        relate; I have had the interesting pleasure to make my 3x3 blindfold
        attempts in tandem with Chris Hardwick's 5x5 blindfold attempts. These
        attempts, almost inevitably, produce World Records. And he can, and
        must, do this while I am in the middle of my solves. This is annoying,
        not because I am blindfolded and solving - It is annoying because I am
        blindfolded and cannot see his accomplishment (and I'd rather not stop
        to applaud and risk further encouragment of my 0% completion rate for
        blindfold solving). This is the first true reflection I've had on these
        feelings. I won't say anymore: "I hope this competition is going to be
        different." Instead: "I hope this competition is going to be the same as
        others." I hope that I continue to try my best. I hope that I continue
        to find pleasure in the successes of my friends. I hope I prepare better
        for the next one. :) I applaud the achievements of all of you. But, I
        think the least important part of these competitions is that which we
        find in the results. Best Regards, Richard Patterson [Non-text portions

        Anyway, after closer inspection, I found that some of the corner pieces
        appear to be hollow. Is this normal? I would think that it would be hard
        to lubricate them if they are hollow like that. Did I just get a bad or
        messed up cube? The other newer cubes, the ones where the stickers curl
        up and fall off, are all solid on the inside. See picture at:

        I only paid about $12 plus shiping. I thought that since the logo on the
        white side looked like the older logo, it was original. They said it was
        original from the 1980s. They probably got it at a garage sale and
        thought it was. The stickers look like vinyl, not those new crappy
        stickers that roll up and fall off. I hate those things. I just ordered
        a Studio cube from Hungary. Hope that one is better. Thanks for the

        Hi :-) Personally i think using the table for aligning purposes should
        be allowed. It's allowed for normal speedcubing. So as long as the table
        is not used as support for twisting (faster) and "table-alignment" is
        not used excessively i don't see any problems with it. I use it
        frequently for 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 when "hand-alignment" is harder to do than
        "table-alignment"! Im not a OH cuber so i might not have any saying in

        Personally, I think using the table for any purpose should be allowed,
        no restriction, since it is used for normal speedcubing (I know someone
        who can't solve a Megaminx in competitions without a table). Why is it
        forbidden? I don't know. If you can't use the table, let's be logical
        and forbid using the floor in feet cubing. It's the same kind of

        &gt; Personally i think using the table for aligning purposes should be
        &gt; allowed. It's allowed for normal speedcubing. So as long as the
        table &gt; is not used as support for twisting (faster) and
        "table-alignment" is &gt; not used excessively i don't see any problems
        with it. I use it &gt; frequently for 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 when
        "hand-alignment" is harder to do &gt; than "table-alignment"! Im not a
        OH cuber so i might not have any &gt; saying in this. I'm generally in
        favor of liberal rules :D I think the reason they have this rule (and
        also the one-handed inspection rule) is that they want to make a
        one-handed solve feel and look totally one-handed - you can only use
        that hand, and no other objects or body parts can even touch the cube
        while you're making turns. The question is, if someone said that they
        could solve it one-handed, and they used the table, would you hold it
        against them? On the other hand, I also think that it should be changed.
        I mean, the table's there, why not be able to use it! It's not
        "one-handed in the air", just "one-handed"...

        Hey, I'm not sure the official view, but I can hopefully answer the
        first question. &gt;From cube4you's forum, there is a post here about
        it: http://bbs.cube4you.com/thread-38-1-1.html . Rubik (owner of
        cube4you) says: "a is better than c , c is better than b , I think so
        but b is cheap than a and c , and with a paper box c is just like the
        Rubik's black diykit" Basically, A is the best and most expensive. C is
        next, while being a little cheaper, and B is the worst quality (but
        still not poor quality.) Yes, I have heard that Ron says that C are the
        best. I've talked to Rubik on MSN, and Finder, and they say that C is
        good, but A is probably better. I have a handful of As, and I think
        they're top notch. I've lubricated them with CRC silicone lubricant, and
        I'm VERY pleased with them. I cannot compare to rubiks.com, or type Cs,
        but once I get each I will take pictures and explain differences. I
        believe I read somewhere that Ron accidentally confused C with A, but I
        am not sure. I think it's best to ask Ron. I plan on buying Cs from
        cube4you and doing an intelligent review on twistypuzzle's forum. As of
        my standing right now, I was more pleased with my 9spuzzles.com order.
        They come with two sets of stickers instead of one (PVC stickers, sadly
        not the quality of cubesmith), "sticker" pads for applying them
        squarely, and his prices are cheaper. If you buy 5+, 20+, 50+, or 100+,
        you get discounts for each bracket. Doesn't make any sense to buy 19
        when 20 is cheaper. Hopefully that helps, Cheers, Mike Carroll

        &gt; There are so many types of DIY cubes on these new sites, 9spuzzles,
        &gt; cube4you, etc etc. Does anybody have a really good definitive
        answer &gt; as to which is the best type for speedcubing? Hi Dan, I got
        some from 9spuzzles a few weeks ago and I was suprised how good they
        turn, even without lubrication. WITH lube, they are the best cube I
        always had (but I had not that much, so that might not mean anything).
        Besides, they are really cheap. On the 9spuzzles website, there is a
        subcategory of 3x3 DIYkit which is called "Best for speedcubing". I
        think it is category "A", which is the one I ordered. I will bring mine
        to German Open Championship 2007. I read from the competitors list that
        you will be there, so if you want to, I can show you then.. Flo

        &lt;mzrg%40verizon.net&gt;&gt; escreveu: &gt; &gt; Personally i think
        using the table for aligning purposes should be &gt; &gt; allowed. It's
        allowed for normal speedcubing. So as long as the table &gt; &gt; is not
        used as support for twisting (faster) and "table-alignment" is &gt; &gt;
        not used excessively i don't see any problems with it. I use it &gt;
        &gt; frequently for 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 when "hand-alignment" is harder to do
        &gt; &gt; than "table-alignment"! Im not a OH cuber so i might not have
        any &gt; &gt; saying in this. I'm generally in favor of liberal rules :D
        &gt; &gt; I think the reason they have this rule (and also the
        one-handed &gt; inspection rule) is that they want to make a one-handed
        solve feel and &gt; look totally one-handed - you can only use that
        hand, and no other &gt; objects or body parts can even touch the cube
        while you're making &gt; turns. The question is, if someone said that
        they could solve it &gt; one-handed, and they used the table, would you
        hold it against them? &gt; &gt; On the other hand, I also think that it
        should be changed. I mean, the &gt; table's there, why not be able to
        use it! It's not "one-handed in the &gt; air", just "one-handed"... &gt;

        It doesn't &gt; say &gt; on the bag which type is which. From the

        I'm so behind on cube emails!! The word 'Australian' in the subject line
        just happened to catch my attention so I checked this thread (still way
        behind on many other threads). I'm always interested in cube media/demo
        stuff, but I'm guessing if Dan H is asking then it's something in the
        UK? I moved to the US earlier this year, so unfortunately will miss out
        on the UK cube action for now. :( Anyway, Dan, if there's anything I can

        I too live in Maryland, and would love to meet up with all of you guys.
        I didn't realize so many cubers lived in the area. A few years ago David
        Barr and I got together with a couple other cubers that we found out
        were in the area, but it looks like there are even more now. David and I

        Hello everybody!!! Im new both to this group and to speedcubing and im
        planning on buying a DIY kit from somewhere. Ive been looking around and
        decided to buy an A version, which seems to be the best of the DIYs.
        Shipping from rubiks.com is too expensive, so i was wondering whether to
        buy from 9puzzles or cube4you. the price is little different, but i
        wanted to know about the quality. have any of u ever had one of them??
        which do u think is better?? the ones from cube4you or from 9puzzles???
        and another thing: i live in brazil. does anybody know which of them
        would be cheaper in the end?? (considering shipping) Thats it for now!!!
        Thx all!!!! =D

      <div class="email-content">
        Hello, I have ordered white and black 3x3x3 type A from both companies
        (Cube4you , 9spuzzles.com), and I think they are nearly the same. The
        cube structure and plastic molds seem to be from the same manufacture,
        and preformed very similarly if not identically. When I bought from
        cube4you, I ordered a while ago before the website was available. He is
        a member of twistypuzzles forum, and for some time he only sold there.
        When I bought them much before the website, the screwsets differed
        slightly from when I received by twistpuzzles. The little baggies still
        consisted of 4 things, a screw, a small washer, a large washer, and a
        spring. The only difference was the screws were not "gold plated" like
        they are now. Rubik (He goes by this name on twistypuzzles; he runs
        cube4you) may have upgraded to the new screws, but if he didn't, I can
        not tell a difference from them. So to answer your first questions: I do
        not think the quality differs depending on what site you order from. I
        can tell you though, that these cubes are the best speedcubes I've ever
        used. I haven't had the chance to try rubiks.com, but several people
        have told me these are better. If you add lubrication to these, they
        even turn more smoothly, though, lubrication is honestly not even
        necessary (but of course it helps). As far as shipping, I am unaware of
        which would be cheaper shipping to Brazil. I do know that the shipping
        from 9spuzzles was cheaper than cube4you when I ordered to USA, so it
        might be similar to Brazil. The cubes on 9spuzzles are slightly cheaper,
        and if you buy 5+, 20+, 50+, or 100+, you get a discount on the cubes.
        On the 100+ tier, the cubes drop to 4.14 (if you have a 3x3x3 account,
        if not, they'll be 4.23 or something). Very cheap! My overall experience
        was better from 9spuzzles, however. Both were very good orders, but I do
        recommend 9spuzzles a bit more. If you have a problem, the guy who runs
        the site (finder on twistypuzzles) is always ready to help. Lastly, I've
        noticed the white cubes are a bit smoother than the blacks. I'm not sure
        why this is, but several other people have agreed with my thoughts on
        this. For some reason, you do not need to insert the "corner" caps on
        the corner pieces for the white pieces; whereas on the black you do. The
        white seem to bit a bit "Softer" plastic, which doesn't lock up as much
        and just feels a bit smoother. Don't get me wrong though, black is still
        incredible. I would just try a few white to go along. I still solve more
        quickly black because I can recognise colors more easily. Hope that
        helps, Cheers, Mike Carroll --- In

        Are you talking about from cube4you? from this page?
        http://cube4you.com/index.php?gOo=goods_search_list.dwt&amp;gcat=1&amp;gtype=
        ? Well, I *think*, just the boxes. Rubik (owner of cube4you) posts here
        http://bbs.cube4you.com/thread-44-1-1.html on his forum the difference
        (although he is quite brief and doesn't exactly explain) He said: "Just
        the box , M type with a nice box , for collection . M type will for sale
        soon" so I THINK they're all the same, besides the box. If you don't
        care, I'd get the cheapest one, as I *think* they're identical cubes and
        should preform equally. I'll verify this with Rubik and reply with his
        message. Hopefully that helps, Cheers, Mike Carroll --- In

        If we eventually have this meeting (which I'm really hoping for), we'd
        need to figure out a few things: 1) Who will attend? Surely there are
        other cubers in the area that haven't seen this thread... 2) Where
        should we have the meeting? --- In

        Hey, I'll answer both questions. "what type are the rubik's diy's? I'm
        looking for a good diy cube, but am unsure which site to buy from." At
        9spuzzles and cube4you, they do not sell the rubiks.com DIYs. Type A are
        very similar to the rubiks.com DIYS, but they are better in some
        respects. I've heard that these turn better than rubiks.com, and the
        center caps do not fall out without any modification. I cannot
        personally verify this as I have never owned a rubiks.com DIY, but I can
        attest that these cubes are the best cubes that I have, hands down. I
        have a studio, and it seems very VERY inferior to this cube. I don't
        think one can do better than a type A from either Chinese site.
        9spuzzles and cube4you type As are essentially identical, only with
        screws differing in each. I haven't ordered from cube4you recently, so
        they may have changed screws, but if they did not, they function very
        similarly. If I look at the picture of the screwsets, they seem to have
        upgraded, but I am not positive. "Also, does 9spuzzles have any a's that
        are not orange. Not that I'm against orange cubes or anything, but just
        wondering..." Yes, they do have basically all colors. Their black type A
        is here:
        http://9spuzzles.com/index.php?gOo=goods_details.dwt&amp;goodsid=4&amp;productname=
        and their white type a is here:
        http://9spuzzles.com/index.php?gOo=goods_details.dwt&amp;goodsid=3&amp;productname=
        When you want to order these from them, go to their homepage, click US
        currency, then click 3x3x3 DIY kit, and go to page two (pages 1 and 2
        are toggle-able at the bottom. "Quick question, what kind of currency do
        they use at 9puzzles and how much does that convert into us dollars?"
        They 'default' use Chinese Yuans, but the site does calculate in US
        dollars. You can select US dollars ONLY (Yes. !ONLY!) at the homepage on
        the left hand side. So when you go to the site, select that and then
        browse around. Now, I've NEVER had checkout to successfully work for me.
        I can add my total things into my order, but when it tries to calculate
        shipping the program tweaks out. Other people have had this problem as
        well. If this happens, you can screenshot your order and send it to
        Finder (his email is puzzles_finder@...) and he'll calculate shipping
        and set up the order. Lastly, if you're planning on buying more than a
        few, you get price discounts at 5+, 20+, 50+ and 100+ only at
        9spuzzles.com. You might have to be logged in to see this, but it's
        worth buying 5 because the price drop is quite considerable. I
        personally recommend 9spuzzles, as my overall experience was very good.
        The shipping was cheaper (USA, Minnesota), and the cubes were cheaper.
        I'm going to create a thread clearing up all this 9spuzzles, type A/B/C,
        cube4you, Finder, Rubik, cubefans, all this stuff that hasn't been
        explained very well anywhere on Twistypuzzles and other forums.
        Hopefully that helps, Cheers, Mike Carroll --- In

        What you can do is have too many trophees and if nobody wins in a

        Yep, it seems that they added a couple more buttons and changed the
        interface a bit, but the overall appearence is the same. It seems to
        have date features, and take 3 memory entries. For $20 USD, it is worth
        buying I think. Though I'm sure all serious cubers have gen 2 timers

        Hi Per! I have not been the webmaster, but I have heard some about what
        happened. In some way the site has been used for phising, and has been
        hacked a few times. The first time the web hotel agrred to put the site
        online again, but after the last time they didn't want to put it online
        until the security hole was fixed. The thing i that Gustav Fredell, who
        was the webmaster, didn't know how to find/fix it, so the site has been
        down since january or so. I have mailed him a few times to ask if he
        could put up a more trimmed version of the site, with basicly only a
        forum, but by some unknown reason he doesn't answer my mails. (The site
        uses mambo). So, to sum up, if we can't get in contact with Gustav, we
        need to start a totally new swedish cube site. I find this quite
        important, because it's much thanks to the site and it's forum that
        there has been so many swedish competitions and competitors. It feels
        like a lot of the swedish cubers will loose their intreset when they

        Hi :-) Seems to me like Gustav is quite fed up with the whole situation.
        But we/you would need his cooperation to restore the site, or else yes
        we/you would need start afresh. Just starting a swedish (or nordic)
        cubing forum is easy enough. - Get a cheap webhost that offers mysql
        database. - Use the site's control panel to install a forum or install a
        forum on the site via ftp (open source php forum like phpbb or smf) -
        Make the default startpage of the site point to the forum main page Etc
        etc .... more can be added later on an ad hoc basis. I know a pretty
        good and cheap host, but sadly it's US based and won't give a the site a
        swedish domain name (only the standard com/org/net etc ...) -Per PS!
        Another option is to simply start a yahoo-based forum, if nothing but a
        forum is needed ... -Per &gt; --- In

        times. The first time the web hotel agrred to put the &gt; site online
        again, but after the last time they didn't want to put it &gt; online
        until the security hole was fixed. The thing i that Gustav &gt; Fredell,
        who was the webmaster, didn't know how to find/fix it, so the &gt; site
        has been down since january or so. &gt; &gt; I have mailed him a few
        times to ask if he could put up a more trimmed &gt; version of the site,
        with basicly only a forum, but by some unknown &gt; reason he doesn't
        answer my mails. (The site uses mambo). &gt; &gt; So, to sum up, if we
        can't get in contact with Gustav, we need to &gt; start a totally new
        swedish cube site. I find this quite important, &gt; because it's much
        thanks to the site and it's forum that there has &gt; been so many
        swedish competitions and competitors. It feels like a lot &gt; of the

        Hi :-) Well even there is a 2x2x2 block given, the rest of the cube is
        quite well scrambled with that algorithm. X-cross start is very easy ;-)
        I don't think we need a new scrambling algorithm. What would the fun be
        in having an algorithm always giving us "hard" scrambles. The
        possibility of having "easy" scramble is what makes completely random
        scrambles fun. The easiest way to invent a "new algorithm" is to make
        them longer, like 50 or 60 turns (same as for larger cubes). if anyone
        thinks 50/60 turn scrambles are long then just let Cube Explorer quickly
        find a 20/21 turn substitute :D (using its webinterface) Another way
        would be to look at pair-breaking. This was discussed here some yrs ago.
        In fact, most discussions here are recurring ;-) Have fun! -Per &gt; ---

        I &gt; can attest that these cubes are the best cubes that I have, hands

        Chinese site. &gt; &gt; 9spuzzles and cube4you type As are essentially
        identical, only with &gt; screws differing in each. I haven't ordered
        from cube4you recently, &gt; so they may have changed screws, but if
        they did not, they function &gt; very similarly. If I look at the
        picture of the screwsets, they seem &gt; to have upgraded, but I am not
        positive. &gt; &gt; "Also, does 9spuzzles have any a's that are not
        orange. Not that I'm &gt; against orange cubes or anything, but just

        black type A is here: &gt; http://9spuzzles.com/index.php?

        gOo=goods_details.dwt&amp;goodsid=3&amp;productname= &gt; &gt; When you
        want to order these from them, go to their homepage, click US &gt;
        currency, then click 3x3x3 DIY kit, and go to page two (pages 1 and 2
        &gt; are toggle-able at the bottom. &gt; &gt; "Quick question, what kind

        but the site does calculate in US &gt; dollars. You can select US
        dollars ONLY (Yes. !ONLY!) at the homepage &gt; on the left hand side.
        So when you go to the site, select that and &gt; then browse around.
        &gt; &gt; Now, I've NEVER had checkout to successfully work for me. I
        can add &gt; my total things into my order, but when it tries to
        calculate shipping &gt; the program tweaks out. Other people have had
        this problem as well. &gt; If this happens, you can screenshot your
        order and send it to Finder &gt; (his email is puzzles_finder@...) and
        he'll calculate shipping &gt; and set up the order. &gt; &gt; Lastly, if
        you're planning on buying more than a few, you get price &gt; discounts
        at 5+, 20+, 50+ and 100+ only at 9spuzzles.com. You might &gt; have to
        be logged in to see this, but it's worth buying 5 because the &gt; price
        drop is quite considerable. I personally recommend 9spuzzles, &gt; as my
        overall experience was very good. The shipping was cheaper &gt; (USA,
        Minnesota), and the cubes were cheaper. &gt; &gt; I'm going to create a
        thread clearing up all this 9spuzzles, type &gt; A/B/C, cube4you,

        &gt; &gt; &gt; am unsure which site to buy from. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, does 9spuzzles have any a's that are not
        orange. Not &gt; that I'm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; against orange cubes or
        anything, but just wondering... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; Hi all, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        There are so many types of DIY cubes on these new sites, &gt; 9spuzzles,
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cube4you, etc etc. Does anybody have a really
        good &gt; definitive answer &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as to which is the
        best type for speedcubing? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Ron told me that type C are best from cube4you, but are all &gt;
        type &gt; &gt; c's, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b's, and a's the same on
        each site? I've heard other people &gt; say they &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; like type a's better... argh im confused! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any recommmendations? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I believe it is normal. I think the studio cubes have a much larger
        "work-in" period, and once they become worked in they become much
        better. I've bought DIY kits from 9spuzzles.com and cube4you.com , and
        they're cheaper and turn much much better. I have both, and I rarely use
        my studio cube. I'm not regretting buying it, because it makes an
        excellent collection piece, and I might be able to use it in the future.
        I think the pieces of a studio cube are made out of higher quality
        plastic, so I think I am going to try taking the removable pieces of a
        studio cube and putting them with a DIY core+center pieces (arched) so
        the tensions are perfect, and I recieve the benefits of an arched
        center. But yes, my Hungarian studio cube is quite poor. The article on
        "Make speedcube" on speedcubing.com I don't personally agree with. I
        tend to like DIY kits by FAR over my studio cube. Adjusting the screws
        would probably help, as would well as lubrication and working at it.
        Like I said, if you use this A LOT, it might become good, BUT, you still
        have the disadvantage of pops because the center pieces are not arched
        (thus my DIY kit idea.) I highly recommend buying a DIY kit from either
        of the two previous sites mentioned, -- you won't be disappointed. I
        think white DIY kits turn SLIGHTLY better than black, because it is made
        with a different type of plastic. I still recommend buying black though,
        as it's easier to recognise colors. If you read my other posts on the
        questions about the sites, I describe in more detail the differences
        between the sites/sellers/cubes. Hope that helps, Cheers, Mike Carroll

        Hi Ryan, &gt; Maybe a WCA board member can answer this... I'd like to
        know, anyway. &gt; &gt; Does the WCA* today still allow a sponsor to
        force additional &gt; restrictions on the allowable puzzles? Also, does
        the WCA still allow a &gt; sponsor to require that puzzles be
        restickered to display the sponsor's &gt; logo? First, I am not an
        expert on copyrights, trademarks et cetera. I do know that if Nike would
        be sponsor of World Championship athletics, they would not allow fake
        Nike shoes. That would be like accepting that people make fake copies of
        their products. It would be hard for them to win future legal cases if
        they would allow accept them. It is not one of the jobs of WCA to
        promote/accept illegal copying of puzzles. It is also not one of the
        jobs of WCA to check for illegal copies. But if our sponsor for a
        specific competition would notify me of people using illegal puzzles, I
        think it is reasonable to disallow those puzzles. Like I said, I am not
        an expert on this subject. I do respect Seventowns and all legal

        Hi Ryan, &gt;I think it's time someone invent a new scrambling algorithm
        :-) Actually last year I was thinking about defining lucky scrambles.
        This was after Czech Open 2006 where one of the 2x2 scrambles was
        solvable in 3 moves. See below for my ideas. There are different
        approaches for defining 'too lucky' scrambles. a) number of moves to
        solve optimally b) number of moves to solve using a standard system
        (which one???) c) number of moves to solve one face d) number of moves
        to do first step (for different systems) e) number of (specific pieces
        of) colors per face should be at least x f) number of faces per
        (specific piece of) color should be at least y g) et cetera. Since I did
        not want to favour specific systems I thought e and f are the best
        options (from the ones I can think of). I was not sure whether these
        would actually help in making sure the scrambles are not 'too lucky'. My
        proposal in 2006 was: = all 4 edge stickers per color should be placed
        on at least 3 different faces = all 4 corner stickers per color should
        be placed on at least 3 different faces = all 9 stickers of one color
        should be placed on at least 4 different faces A similar approach would
        be possible 4x4, 5x5 et cetera. Back then I was wondering which
        percentage of random scrambles would then be skipped. Question: Would
        Chris's scramble be skipped? No: - edges: OK - corners: OK - all: OK
        Does anyone have a better idea? Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message

        sponsor for a specific competition would notify me of people using &gt;
        illegal puzzles, I think it is reasonable to disallow those puzzles. My
        question is not about illegal copies, it is about different brands.
        Would, for example, the WCA allow Seven Towns as a sponsor to require
        competitors to use their brand over East Sheen? By the way, the WCA
        /should/ be experts on what constitutes an illegal copy, and shouldn't
        just ban a puzzle because a particular sponsor "claims" it to be an
        illegal copy. What if Seven Towns claimed East Sheen as an illegal copy?
        Would the WCA agree to ban it from a sponsored competition, or not? Or
        will the WCA make up its own mind about what puzzles are allowed and
        firmly stick to it? -- Ryan Heise http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/

        Well, I don't think that the pieces need to be totally scrambled in
        terms of the stickers, but we need to avoid certain things. For example,
        on the 3x3x3, since almost everyone starts with a cross or a 2x2x2
        block, we should make sure that neither of these can be solved extremely
        quickly. For example, a 4-move cross should count as lucky since it
        occurs only 5% of the time (according to the analysis at Dan's
        Cubestation). And, of course, keep away from 2x2x1 blocks which involve
        only one center piece. On the 2x2x2, an optimal solution of 7 moves or
        less (face turn metric) occurs only 7.9% of the time (according to
        Jaap's analysis), so it should be considered lucky too. Similarly, we
        might want to look for lucky first/second centers on the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5
        (assuming that most people use a centers-first strategy), although we
        should also keep away from any blocks that are 2x2x1 or bigger.

        time someone invent a new scrambling algorithm :-) &gt; Actually last
        year I was thinking about defining lucky scrambles. &gt; This was after
        Czech Open 2006 where one of the 2x2 scrambles was solvable &gt; in 3
        moves. &gt; See below for my ideas. &gt; &gt; There are different
        approaches for defining 'too lucky' scrambles. &gt; a) number of moves
        to solve optimally &gt; b) number of moves to solve using a standard
        system (which one???) &gt; c) number of moves to solve one face &gt; d)
        number of moves to do first step (for different systems) &gt; e) number
        of (specific pieces of) colors per face should be at least x &gt; f)
        number of faces per (specific piece of) color should be at least y &gt;
        g) et cetera. &gt; &gt; Since I did not want to favour specific systems
        I thought e and f are the &gt; best options (from the ones I can think
        of). &gt; I was not sure whether these would actually help in making
        sure the &gt; scrambles are not 'too lucky'. &gt; &gt; My proposal in
        2006 was: &gt; = all 4 edge stickers per color should be placed on at
        least 3 different &gt; faces &gt; = all 4 corner stickers per color
        should be placed on at least 3 different &gt; faces &gt; = all 9
        stickers of one color should be placed on at least 4 different faces
        &gt; A similar approach would be possible 4x4, 5x5 et cetera. &gt; &gt;
        Back then I was wondering which percentage of random scrambles would
        then be &gt; skipped. &gt; &gt; Question: Would Chris's scramble be
        skipped? &gt; No: &gt; - edges: OK &gt; - corners: OK &gt; - all: OK
        &gt; &gt; Does anyone have a better idea? &gt; A much better idea: Do
        nothing. The scramble that made a 2x2x2 solvable in 3 moves should have
        been kept, as I said when we talked about it. Some scrambles generate an
        easy starting configuration for most solvers. Others generate
        configurations that look hard, but some competitors can be individually
        "lucky" (depending on their method or even mistakes) and get a LL skip
        for instance. If someone solve a 3x3x3 in 7.5s because he has a LL skip
        and 3 easy pairs after a hard cross, we'll declare the record official.
        We should just accept that "luck" exists. In my opinion, a 2x2x2 solved
        in 3 moves would be a good thing to prove that: - Sometimes, this puzzle
        is definitely too easy, especially after a 15s inspection. - Averages
        only do really matter. Gilles.

        exactly why I announced the information on the website: early and in the
        broadest definition (all non Rubik's brands). I do trust our sponsors.
        The WCA regulations do not favor one brand over the other. It is
        possible though that for some competitions additional requirements are
        applied. For example you could limit the number of competitors. Have

        Hi Michael, Thanks for your ideas. When I applied Chris's scramble it
        took me some time to find out why he considered the scramble a 'wow'.
        But at home I normally scramble with white (my cross color) on the
        bottom. In general I think that all scrambles should be allowed. Like
        Gilles wrote in his message. I made a mistake in Czech Open 2006. I

        uses the 25 moves somewhat more economically, but still does not detect
        non-trivial cancellations, or sub-sequences of moves that have little
        scrambling power, such as B' F2 U2 F2 There is a difference between a
        random sequence of moves and a random scramble, and the former does not

        Rather, a smarter sequence is necessary if we want to produce a random

        Where in the regulations is it stated that limiting the puzzles (or the
        number of participants) is legal? I'm not saying that the organizer
        shouldn't be allowed to limit these things (nor am I saying they
        should), but in the current regulations, I just don't see how this is
        legal. For the number of participants: "8b) An open competition is open
        to anyone. 8c) A closed competition may be open to: persons with a
        specific nationality citizens of specific geographical areas members of
        specific clubs students / employees of specific organisations. No other
        distinctions are allowed to declare a competition closed." So, by the
        final line of 8c, no other distinctions (i.e. first x people) are
        allowed. Now, I think a reasonable limit should be allowed. I don't see
        how competitions such as worlds can run smoothly without them. However,
        the regulations don't seem to allow such limits. Of course, a new set of
        regulations could be published before worlds adding this. For the type
        of puzzle: I can't find any regulation that allows or disallows
        regulating the type of puzzle, except for: "2a) Any person may be a
        competitor during a competition, if he: ... 2a2) accepts additional
        regulations of the competition;" So I guess this does allow additional
        regulations to be set. OK, I guess it is legal. I'm not a fan of it,
        since East Sheen puzzles satisfy every criteria of Article 3. However, I
        accept that the regulations do allow banning of certain puzzle types. I
        apologize if this has been discussed before (I can't recall such
        discussion), but could someone explain "2a4) is not banned by WCA
        board."? How can a person be banned? The word "ban" appears nowhere else
        in the regulations, so it's not clear if there are any regulations on
        how a person could be banned. Is it arbitrary? Is there a process
        through which a person is banned? Does a person get 3 strikes or
        something? I apologize for mentioning this now and not in January when
        the rules were not set in stone, but I didn't really notice this before.

        &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It is not one of the jobs of WCA to

        It is also not one of the jobs of WCA to check for illegal copies. But
        if &gt; &gt;&gt; our sponsor for a specific competition would notify me

        to disallow those puzzles. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My question is
        not about illegal copies, it is about different brands. &gt; &gt; Would,

        Hi guys, &gt; There is a difference between a random sequence of moves
        and a random &gt; scramble. Most of us know that. I am open to a
        scrambling program that generates true random scrambles. Some
        requirements: - must be able to generate a new set of scrambles in
        seconds - must generate relatively short scrambling algorithms (not
        longer than current scrambles) - must show the pictures of the scrambles
        (like current scrambler) - must handle 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, and possibly
        other sizes - must handle the other official puzzle events (Square-1,
        Pyraminx, Megaminx, Clock, Fewest moves) - must be free to use (no fees)
        - source must be open to public - technology that does not require to
        install libraries et cetera (so similar to JavaScript) - must run on the
        common platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac) - must be able to run offline

        One of my motivating reasons for creating the WCA was to have a separate
        body that organizes and moderates Rubik's Cube competitions. In other
        words, for competitions that I run, I am the person who puts
        restrictions on the equipment. I have no problem with Eastsheens being
        used in competition. Whereas the Rubik's Cube is a toy, the only
        copyrighted part is really the trade mark. And whereas I understand a
        company's right to protect their profits, I feel that we have a right to
        practice our sport how we want it. So in my competitions, and
        competitions that I oversee, there are no restrictions on cube by brand.
        If a cube is an absolute piece of crap so that scrambling it is
        difficult, or that the colors are unrecognizable (or have glitter
        stickers... or something weird like that), yes I will disallow that
        Rubik's Cube. That being said, I also am not amazingly rich. So sadly to
        say, if I ran a championships, you wouldn't be getting any prize money.
        If you're all right with that, then the US Championships is the place to
        be. If you do really well and get first place, maybe you'll get a
        sandwich. But in exchange, you get some freedom. I don't know what's
        better. -Tyson On Mar 30, 2007, at 3:05 PM, Tim Reynolds wrote: &gt;
        Where in the regulations is it stated that limiting the puzzles (or &gt;
        the number of participants) is legal? I'm not saying that the &gt;
        organizer shouldn't be allowed to limit these things (nor am I saying
        &gt; they should), but in the current regulations, I just don't see how
        &gt; this is legal. &gt; &gt; For the number of participants: &gt; "8b)
        An open competition is open to anyone. &gt; 8c) A closed competition may
        be open to: &gt; &gt; persons with a specific nationality &gt; citizens
        of specific geographical areas &gt; members of specific clubs &gt;
        students / employees of specific organisations. &gt; No other
        distinctions are allowed to declare a competition closed." &gt; &gt; So,
        by the final line of 8c, no other distinctions (i.e. first x &gt;
        people) are allowed. Now, I think a reasonable limit should be &gt;
        allowed. I don't see how competitions such as worlds can run &gt;
        smoothly without them. However, the regulations don't seem to allow &gt;
        such limits. Of course, a new set of regulations could be published &gt;
        before worlds adding this. &gt; &gt; For the type of puzzle: &gt; I
        can't find any regulation that allows or disallows regulating the &gt;
        type of puzzle, except for: &gt; "2a) Any person may be a competitor
        during a competition, if he: &gt; ... &gt; 2a2) accepts additional
        regulations of the competition;" &gt; So I guess this does allow
        additional regulations to be set. OK, I &gt; guess it is legal. I'm not
        a fan of it, since East Sheen puzzles &gt; satisfy every criteria of
        Article 3. However, I accept that the &gt; regulations do allow banning
        of certain puzzle types. &gt; &gt; I apologize if this has been
        discussed before (I can't recall such &gt; discussion), but could
        someone explain "2a4) is not banned by WCA &gt; board."? How can a
        person be banned? The word "ban" appears nowhere &gt; else in the
        regulations, so it's not clear if there are any &gt; regulations on how
        a person could be banned. Is it arbitrary? Is &gt; there a process
        through which a person is banned? Does a person get &gt; 3 strikes or
        something? I apologize for mentioning this now and not &gt; in January
        when the rules were not set in stone, but I didn't really &gt; notice

        not an expert on copyrights, trademarks et cetera. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I
        do know that if Nike would be sponsor of World Championship &gt;

        would be like &gt; accepting that &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; people make fake

        jobs of WCA to promote/accept illegal &gt; copying of &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        puzzles. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It is also not one of the jobs of WCA to
        check for illegal &gt; copies. But if &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; our sponsor for
        a specific competition would notify me of people &gt; using &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; illegal puzzles, I think it is reasonable to disallow those
        &gt; puzzles. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My question
        is not about illegal copies, it is about different &gt; brands. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Would, for example, the WCA allow Seven Towns as a sponsor to

        Hello, I'm still trying to improve my F2L while learning OLL and PPL and
        I often read that you shouldn't rotate the cube while doing F2L. I
        totally agree with this but there are cases when I have a hard time
        finding a way of doing it easily without rotating the cube. For example:
        B' U B that I will usually solve doing: u' L' U L (to obviously being
        able to do U with the right index) So I'm curious, how you guys are
        doing it? As a side question, I'm wondering if there is somewhere a good
        collection of sub-20 videos with slow motion version to be able to study
        how you guys are doing F2L :) Thanks, Best Regards, Qu√¥c

        March 31, 2007 5:59 AM Subject: Re: [Speed cubing group] these new DIY
        cubes One of my motivating reasons for creating the WCA was to have a
        separate body that organizes and moderates Rubik's Cube competitions. In
        other words, for competitions that I run, I am the person who puts
        restrictions on the equipment. I have no problem with Eastsheens being
        used in competition. Whereas the Rubik's Cube is a toy, the only
        copyrighted part is really the trade mark. And whereas I understand a
        company's right to protect their profits, I feel that we have a right to
        practice our sport how we want it. So in my competitions, and
        competitions that I oversee, there are no restrictions on cube by brand.
        If a cube is an absolute piece of crap so that scrambling it is
        difficult, or that the colors are unrecognizable (or have glitter
        stickers... or something weird like that), yes I will disallow that
        Rubik's Cube. That being said, I also am not amazingly rich. So sadly to
        say, if I ran a championships, you wouldn't be getting any prize money.
        If you're all right with that, then the US Championships is the place to
        be. If you do really well and get first place, maybe you'll get a
        sandwich. But in exchange, you get some freedom. I don't know what's
        better. -Tyson On Mar 30, 2007, at 3:05 PM, Tim Reynolds wrote: &gt;
        Where in the regulations is it stated that limiting the puzzles (or &gt;

        &gt; they should), but in the current regulations, I just don't see how
        &gt; this is legal. &gt; &gt; For the number of participants: &gt; "8b)
        An open competition is open to anyone. &gt; 8c) A closed competition may
        be open to: &gt; &gt; persons with a specific nationality &gt; citizens

        students / employees of specific organisations. &gt; No other
        distinctions are allowed to declare a competition closed." &gt; &gt; So,
        by the final line of 8c, no other distinctions (i.e. first x &gt;
        people) are allowed. Now, I think a reasonable limit should be &gt;
        allowed. I don't see how competitions such as worlds can run &gt;
        smoothly without them. However, the regulations don't seem to allow &gt;
        such limits. Of course, a new set of regulations could be published &gt;
        before worlds adding this. &gt; &gt; For the type of puzzle: &gt; I
        can't find any regulation that allows or disallows regulating the &gt;
        type of puzzle, except for: &gt; "2a) Any person may be a competitor
        during a competition, if he: &gt; ... &gt; 2a2) accepts additional
        regulations of the competition;" &gt; So I guess this does allow
        additional regulations to be set. OK, I &gt; guess it is legal. I'm not
        a fan of it, since East Sheen puzzles &gt; satisfy every criteria of
        Article 3. However, I accept that the &gt; regulations do allow banning
        of certain puzzle types. &gt; &gt; I apologize if this has been
        discussed before (I can't recall such &gt; discussion), but could
        someone explain "2a4) is not banned by WCA &gt; board."? How can a
        person be banned? The word "ban" appears nowhere &gt; else in the
        regulations, so it's not clear if there are any &gt; regulations on how
        a person could be banned. Is it arbitrary? Is &gt; there a process
        through which a person is banned? Does a person get &gt; 3 strikes or
        something? I apologize for mentioning this now and not &gt; in January
        when the rules were not set in stone, but I didn't really &gt; notice

        &gt; &gt; By the way, the WCA /should/ be experts on what constitutes an

        &gt; That is exactly why I announced the information on the website:
        &gt; early and in &gt; &gt; the broadest definition (all non Rubik's
        brands). &gt; &gt; I do trust our sponsors. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The WCA
        regulations do not favor one brand over the other. It is &gt; possible
        &gt; &gt; though that for some competitions additional requirements are

        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Does the WCA* today still allow a sponsor to

        not an expert on copyrights, trademarks et cetera. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I
        do know that if Nike would be sponsor of World Championship &gt;
        athletics, &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; they would not allow fake Nike shoes. That
        would be like &gt; accepting that &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; people make fake

        jobs of WCA to promote/accept illegal &gt; copying of &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
        puzzles. &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It is also not one of the jobs of WCA to
        check for illegal &gt; copies. But if &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; our sponsor for
        a specific competition would notify me of people &gt; using &gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt; illegal puzzles, I think it is reasonable to disallow those
        &gt; puzzles. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My question
        is not about illegal copies, it is about different &gt; brands. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Would, for example, the WCA allow Seven Towns as a sponsor to
        &gt; require &gt; &gt; &gt; competitors to use their brand over East
        Sheen? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, the WCA /should/ be

        I could be wrong but isn't speedcubing: solving the rubik's cube as fast
        as you can from any (possible) RANDOM position? If the scrambles would
        have to keep certain constraints it is not exactly any random position
        anymore is it, more like any random position as long as it is not too
        easy. Of course, on the other hand, scrambles which are solvable in 3
        moves like in Czech 2006 are ridiculous too. Somebody said something
        about a 4 move cross? If they occur in 5% of the time we still would get
        some easy crosses when you would do an avg of 100. An easy start doesn't
        always mean an easy solve, the rest could be horror too. Not that I
        plead that scrambles where the F2L is already solved could be used in
        competitions, i'm not realy sure what would be best... --- In

        because they ARE different. Look towards the top, -- one has a black
        gradient, while the other can is all red. I believe they even have the
        same model number. They both 'lubricate' but I believe that the first
        one does right away. The first one doesn't turn your cubies "white" like
        the other kind. I've tried 3-4 brands, and this is the best. I found 1
        can at ace hardware (I bought them out), and then later I bought 4 cans

        Hey, In my opinion, and in many other cubers, DIY rubik's cubes are the
        best. You can either buy them via rubiks.com which are official, or you
        can get chinese DIYs. Suprisingly, the Chinese cubes have gotten better
        reviews that the rubiks.com. They're both very good, but many people
        recommend the Chinese ones over the official rubiks. The chinese DIY
        kits centers don't pop off, their molding might be a bit better, and
        just overall they seem better. I myself haven't tired a rubiks.com diy,
        so I cannot verify this, but I can verify the quality of the Chinese
        kits. They're VERY easy to put together (5-10 minutes), and you can
        adjust tension with both of them (like a studio cube.) You can buy DIY
        kits from 9spuzzles.com or cube4you.com . They're both very similar, but
        9spuzzles is cheaper and sends two sets of PVC stickers. There's several
        topics on this that you can read that I've described the differences. I
        recommend type A, as they turn the best and have the best screws. If you
        go to 9spuzzles.com, select US currency, and find the type A
        white/black/orange DIY kits and you'll be very satisfied. I think the
        white turn slightly better than the black. Get some aerosol silicone
        based lubricant (CRC I recommend), and these things will FLY. Hopefully
        that helps! Cheers, Mike Carroll --- In

        I'm not sure what all those settings mean. What I think is needed is to
        measure the average number of moves needed to optimally solve a
        scrambled cube, as a function of how many moves were used to scramble
        it. Concretely: Generate 10 scrambles with 18 scramble moves. Find the
        average for optimal solutions in Cube Explorer. Do the same for 19, 20,
        21 etc. Let's say the numbers look like this: 18 - 15.4 19 - 15.9 20 -
        16.3 21 - 16.8 22 - 17.2 23 - 17.5 24 - 17.9 25 - 18.3 26 - 18.6 27 -
        18.8 28 - 19.0 29 - 19.1 30 - 19.1 31 - 19.1 My claim is that these
        (very hypothetical) numbers would objectively tell us that 29 moves
        produces a fully scrambled cube. That's certainly debatable as a
        methodology, but my instinct is that's it's a very good practical
        measure, and I haven't heard anyone propose anything else. 10 moves is a
        bit low. 100 would be much better. Even more even better. On Mar 31,

        "Random" or pseudo-random is a very difficult art. It's often considered
        as part of the cryptography field, and proving that you have a good
        pseudo-random function is really hard. You would be surprised how many
        techniques there are to find hidden patterns and predict values in a
        pseudo-random sequences. To have an idea about what is possible, this
        paper is a very famous ones:
        http://www.bindview.com/Services/Razor/Papers/2001/tcpseq.cfm It
        introduces phase-space analysis. So why am I saying this? Well, just to
        point out that we could discuss all weeks about this, unless we have an
        cryptography expert in this mailing list (I have a strong background in
        this field, but I won't dare calling myself an expert), it's going to be
        hard to decide what is more random than what. Intuitively I would say
        that generating random position is probably "more random" than
        generating random scramble moves. But it's just my intuition... Having
        said that, "luck" is part of "random", but you have to make sure the
        probability of these lucks is the same or as close as possible from the
        mathematic values. Luck is not luck anymore if what is supposed to be a
        0.01% becomes 10% due to a bad scramble algorithm. For a 3x3 cube, I
        would imagine something like that: - create 4 arrays (corner
        orientations, edge orientations, corner positions, edges positions) -
        init them with their initital value: [0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0] (CO)
        [0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0] (EO) [0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7] (CP)
        [0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11] (EP) - Random shuffle them using a proven
        algorithm (in C++ random_shuffle () would do it) - Check parities, if
        parities are wrong, fix them (but it would have to be random too...
        that's a little bit tricky. You'll probably have to randomly choose if
        you are going to fix it by swapping edges or corners, and stuff like
        that. If this part is not carefully implemented your going to introduce
        a bias) And of course, all of this rely on your pseudo random function
        so don't use the one from the operating system, but use a
        cryptographically proven one. Also, a common error is to use modulo (%)
        to limit the maximum value. For example a lot of people do: rand() % 10
        to get a value from 0 to 9. This is very very bad as it folds the
        probability. The following example will show you a simple case: Imagine
        you have a _truly_ random function generating 2 true random bits (and
        having such a function is actually quite hard...). Thus, it generates 4
        possible values, and imagine you want 3 possible values. Most people
        will just do: rand() % 3. Now look at the probability tables: before:
        value prob 0 1/4 1 1/4 2 1/4 3 1/4 after %3: value prob 0 1/2 1 1/4 3
        1/4 I'm not explaining all of that to show how smart I am... I just want
        to point out that you guys are currently discussing a really tricky
        problem, and I just wanted to make sure that we all know to what extent
        this question is really really a tricky one. Thanks for reading... Qu√¥c

        I'm sure we are beating this topic to death, but just wanted to coment
        on this post below. "as fast as you can from any (possible) RANDOM
        position" Yes! *Position*, which is not the same as scramble. One such
        constraint that has been proposed is to pick from random positions
        instead and have a program churn out a reasonably short sequence to
        getting there. I've run into plenty of things like 4 turn crosses, and I
        don't think it's bad to have those appear in the probablity they should
        be appearing. And there was that 7 turn 2x2 I got in Nationals06 that I
        didn't capitalize on... According to analysis by DanH and/or LarsV,
        there is a 5.xxxx% chance of a 4 turn cross for example. It is unclear
        to me that using 25 turn scrmables we currently use actually achives
        this emperical value very precisely. Or any of the other theoretical
        probablities that I would consider to be desirable as to produce
        *truely* random positions. I believe Ryan is right, 25 turn scrambles do
        produce a skewed distribution. Some perfectly good and random positions
        simply cannot be reached at all with such scrambles. For us to be using
        this or continue using this, we just have to accept that. How skewed is
        anybody's guess, but I suspect it's a little more than people here
        imagine. -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        solvable in 3 moves like in Czech 2006 are ridiculous too. Somebody &gt;
        said something about a 4 move cross? If they occur in 5% of the time

        &gt; On a similar note, I think I've discovered why someone said that

        &gt;From such a test we should theoretically see some asymptotic
        relationship since we sould get diminishing returns as the scramble
        length increases. From that, we can decided on a good cutoff length for
        scrmables should be. Although an interesting endevor itself, why use
        this for 3x3 or 2x2 when we can generate random positions and turn them

        &gt; 10 moves is a bit low. 100 would be much better. Even more even

        Well it does show how smart you are, and you are right. I forgot about
        the concept that computers are inhearently imperfect at generating
        randomness. But I don't think we need a cryptography expert, although
        I'm sure with a community as big as ours there's probably one reading.
        When it comes down to it, it's really just dealing with "uniform
        distributions", "standard distributions", "confidence intervals" and
        other "statisictal significance" stuff or an intro level. That and the
        computer programming necessary to do a lot of the things we need in
        evaluating ideas, I think that we as a comunity are pretty strong with.
        That is to say..., we are all experts at telling each other how bad our
        ideas are and why, lol. &gt; Intuitively I would say that generating
        random position is probably &gt; "more random" &gt; than generating
        random scramble moves. But it's just my intuition... I would replace
        that with "more desirable". And I think it's obviously more desirable to
        do this if easily possible. Since in many competitions the scrambles are
        produced many days in advanced and sealed, I don't think it's an
        unreasonable thing to ask organizers to do. But that's me looking at it

        On the contrary, I think it was very constructive. First I pointed out
        that you intended to do some stuff, but you failed to say how you're
        going to reach a conclusion. Then I pointed out that when you're talking
        about "good enough scrambles", you ought to define what you mean with
        "good enough". Without these two missing pieces, I think the question
        you asked can't really be answered, so my post was a suggestion to
        provide them. Which I think is constructive. Ok, the third sentence

        breaking up the pairs to restart from a position that looks really

        1 0 1 0 0 0 2 1 -&gt; 0,611111111 pair on average Do you really often

        I'm interested in this. We should change the scrambling method we use if
        it's mathematically proven weak. But I still don't have the proof. Last
        time I asked to fewest moves solvers, it seemed that 25 moves were good
        enough to generate a random cubes. I think that Lars' idea about
        submitting loads of scrambles of various lengths to an optimal solver is
        good. The scrambling should at least be random enough for an optimal
        solver. Gilles. &gt; &gt; That is why, at the very least, current
        algorithms rule out certain &gt; sequences and favour others, rather
        than using a completely random &gt; sequence. &gt; &gt; -- &gt; Ryan

        Hey Stefan, Yes that is how I came up with my alg. I was trying to find
        an identity different from 12 moves, preferably longer, and thought of
        that "holes" design one. Then I just had to find an identity in 9 moves,
        and did a little trial and error until I found U2 D2 L2 R2 but with the
        first move done as a quarter turn instead. As for those sites, that is
        very interesting, but it is a little above my head! I see the main idea
        of how they are breaking their proof down into separate equivalence
        classes though, but I will need to take more time to try to understand
        this in a little more depth. Just as an interesting proposal can we find
        a 25 move scramble that produces the superflip? Also can we find a 25
        move algorithm that produces any one of the 86 super-superflips? I
        define the super-superflip as "any one of the 86 total positions where
        every piece is in its correct location, but none have the correct
        orientation." I know the superflip is a case often looked at, and
        perhaps if there is a counterexample to the 25 move scramble generating
        all possible cube states perhaps this could be one? Or maybe one of the
        super-superflips could be? Just a thought until we get a better idea
        about this problem, Chris

        for all. We do know something about how humans operate, and I think we
        can define an effective function that measures how hard a position is. A
        human looks for recognisable ways to create harmony between pieces. What
        is harmony? It is a function of how close the pieces' orientation and/or
        permutation are to each other, in terms of how many moves they are away
        from having the same orientation and/or permutation. What is easily
        recognisable? Usually the recognisable cases are those involving a small
        number of pieces that already have a high degree of harmony. This rough
        definition I think works across a wide variety of human methods. A
        simple measure of harmony would be to define a harmony() function on two
        pieces, and then calculate the sum of the harmony for all combinations
        of two pieces, or variations of this idea. I expect that harmony(cube)
        will be different from depth(cube), because we know that there are both
        hard and easy scrambles at depth 18. For example, Chris' "WOW" scramble
        was actually at depth 18, but was easy. -- Ryan Heise

        I don't know anyone knows a 25 turn HTM scramble (without obvious
        cancellations) that result in the solved state again, but I do remember
        a challenge a year or more old that had a 13 moves one (if memory serves
        me correct) as a winner. I thought Stefan found it. There were also some
        longer ones naturally. I am not going to try to find a 25 moves one, but

        Intuitively this must be the case, and I think it's a assertion that
        everybody here is willing to believe. But this is much easier than
        proving the other things being discussed, all this takes is finding a
        single case. I wouldn't even call it a "proof," just a "example/counter-
        example". Just entertain me and see if anyone here can find a 25 turn
        HTM scramble that produces the identity/solved state. I'm having a hard
        time finding one. Oh and by "scramble," I am discounting the really
        trivial cancellations and such. &gt; Whoa! There are positions not
        reachable in 25 turns? Proof please! &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt;

        position that has ever been tested can be reached in 20 moves (or less)
        so far. Less does not imply more. To think that every single cube state

        very hard for me to accept. [Non-text portions of this message have been

        Ok, here is an observation that should be easy for someone to verify
        with an IDA. Consider the following two positions, both at depth 8
        (HTM): Case 1: (B' U2 B D' B' U2 B D -- or -- D L' U L D' L' U' L) Case
        2: D2 L' U L D2 L' U' L Position 1 is reachable by exactly two 8-move
        sequences, and position 2 is reachable by exactly 1 8-move sequence
        (this is just from my own head, and so someone might like to verify this
        on a computer). Therefore, if we were to use standard scrambling
        algorithm set to length 8, it would be twice as likely to generate a
        scramble for case 1 than it would be to generate the scramble for case
        2. However, if we were to choose a position randomly, we would expect an
        equal chance of getting either case 1 or case 2. * What this means for
        the other proposals * (assuming the computer verifies my answer) Even if
        we were to find that the output of today's scrambling algorithms have
        roughly the same depth distribution as purely random positions, it would
        not mean that the algorithm is producing an even distribution over all
        cube positions. What it also means is that today's scrambling algorithms
        are more likely to produce cube positions that have many alternative
        solutions, rather than ones that have only a narrow solution path. And
        this means that, given such a cube position, any first move that you
        make is *more likely* to take you closer to the solved state than would
        be the case if you were given a purely random position. -- Ryan Heise

        There are about 3*10^29 different 25 move scrambles, and about 4.3*10^19
        different positions. So for each position there is around 7000 million
        25 move scrambles, on average. The actual number of scrambles leading to
        a certain position is clearly going to vary, but is there any reason to
        believe there is any significant systematic favoring of one kind of
        positions over an other? Things do tend to even out a lot when done

        Wow that is a nice scramble! Got a 12.60 solve with it. If I'm not
        mistaken the odds of a scramble producing a solved cross on the D face,
        allowing the possibility that you need to do an aligning turn to align
        the edges to the centers, is 1/47520. If you allow the cross to be
        anywhere the odds should be close to 1-(190076/190080)^6 or
        approximately 0.01% chance. That is probably overcounting possible
        solved crosses though, so I imagine my estimate will in effect be a
        lower bound if not the right number. Chris --- In

        are billions of possible scrambles for a position on average means that
        something has been done billions of times. The only thing that has been
        done multiple times is a move, and only 25 of those have been done. I
        have emailed Bernard Helmstetter, who searched all possible positions of
        the last layer up to depth 15, and asked him if he has any statistics on
        the distribution of "number of solutions per position". At depth 15,
        there still should be a huge number of possible scrambles, and I expect
        that some cases will have orders of magnitude more solutions than other
        cases. Hopefully he recorded such statistics, or can provide information

        have removable caps. If you could remove them (it would take a lot of
        work) you would be disappointed because you would not find screws. The
        generic cubes have rivets, making them impossible to adjust. Did you
        read the tutorial on making a speedcube on speedcubing.com? If so, you
        need a studio cube, or a DIY cube. I recommend getting a DIY cube. They
        have very positive reviews, and lots of guys use them. Either order from
        rubiks.com , cube4you.com , or 9spuzzles.com . They're all good, but I
        recommend 9spuzzles.com the most. You can always just take apart your
        Toys R us cube normally and lubricate it with some silicone spray. That
        should help. Hopefully that helps, Cheers, Mike Carroll --- In

        Aye, it might last all day for you, but on a Friday, it can last all
        night for me. I work 7 days a week + college + cubing ... so it's not
        good for me. And it'll work out for David, as he's hosting it. This is
        the date that we picked. If you can't make it, maybe next time. As I am

        Thanks Dan for taking the time to make this. I just watched it. I didn't
        learn anything about ce/pairing I didn't know already, but I'm still
        amazed at the ease of cross solving for you Fridrich people. A few
        things that I wanted to comment on though. You use empty slots extremely
        well, much better than me. I would surmise that you have been practicing
        speical algs for those things. I did notice a few times when you choose
        a sub-optimal alg for a pairing. I also think that it s possible to
        capitalize on a multi-slotting opportuinity on one cases near end of the
        video. Curious. Do you use any sort of ZB or VH now? Cuz, on the clip
        there where many times when you left the LL edges incorrectly oriented.
        Maybe that was just becasue is was beyond the scope of what the video
        was meant to show. Hem..., now I'm tempted to make one. -Doug

        Lars has a point though. I found that post enlightening and wondered why
        I didn't work out that simple computation myself. What it shows for me
        is that the likelyhood of a position not attainable in exactly 25 turns
        (with no trivial cancellations) is much less than what I previously
        thought. I though it was mnearly impossible for one not to exist, but
        now I'm not too sure. Still this is not a proof one way or another. I
        for one am eager to see something concrete. Proverbially, it is like
        looking for a needle in a haystack... -Doug --- In

        Hey Doug, Thanks for your comments :) The F2L is never ending, you can
        work on it a lot and never completely master it I think. I use empty
        slots a lot, to help minimise rotation, but I didn't use any special
        algs, just the pair up and insert tricks and knowing which slots they
        affect. You are probably right about choosing the sub-optimal algs,
        maybe you can send me some private examples by email? I use a pretty
        limited set of algs, but always try to minimise rotation and delays.
        Multi-slotting, I don't believe in it. VH/ZB I do use, but more so on
        the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5. LarsV and I are investigating a new strategy for
        the 4x4x4 which employs a VH style approach. However this video was just
        to show solves of the F2L, with no specialties at the end. Dan :) --- In

        on a two dimensional plane as well that would be great, but really if

        She is correct. For doing that sort of thing, I always use Mathematica,
        and I'm sure that any of the other computational software packages do it
        as well. (Not too sure about Matlab though, it's more numerical geared,
        but I have ploted lovely 3D things on Maple back in Calc III 6 yrs ago.)
        The programming necessary to do what you are talking about is fairly
        striaght forward and simple. Thus, I would imagine there are a lot of
        free programs out there that do this. A reason Mathematica is so
        expensive is that it does sooooooo much more. If I have some downtime
        I'll look around for ya Chris. Dinner startin'... -Doug --- In

        Hello all, I was looking at Dan's video, I noticed he was solving the
        f2l while solving the white side. Im still new at speed cubing but ive
        learned the beginner method. I wanted to get faster on the f2l because
        while im doing my f2l, I think thats where im spending the most in
        solving the cube. So I wanted to learn how to solve the f2l with the
        white layer. Also ive seen some videos where people solve the f2l then
        if a white peice is missing they correct that and in the end they end up
        with the same f2l and white layer. Are there some moves to memeorize
        like, if there is a peice in a certain place and another peice in a
        different place you perform this move to get it into this position. If
        somone could help me out id really appreciate it. Thanks

        He solves a white cross first, then he solves the F2L. The F2L includes
        the white face and the middle edges. So you pair up, for example, a
        white-green-red corner with a green-red edge, then put them in place.
        There are algorithims for these, you can look at

        If you check out 9spuzzles.com, they have a bunch of really cheap DIY

        Hey Stefan, I know your distaste for the Rubik's Revolution, but it's a
        newspaper article. Sometimes, you can get pressured into saying things a
        certain way, and it's very hard to understand the implications of
        everything you say to the media immediately on the spot. If it makes you

        Hi guys, I was just playing around with my cube and I found this for
        this case : http://tinyurl.com/33sypo - The FR edge is flipped (with the
        corner solved) and the BR F2L is ready to be inserted. Instead of
        solving the BR pair and then flipping the edge, you can do : R U' R2 U2
        R and then solve the FR pair [= (R U' R') (R' U2 R)] Hope you like it.

      <div class="email-content">
        Getting 50 cubes might be a challenge, but as I understood Dan might be
        able to help you out. As for an easy method: I use this simple
        explanation to get people started. It is the basic layer by layer method
        and requires 5/6 algs: (I am assuming white-yellow (light), red-orange
        (fire), blue-green (sea) opposites. I am using white (bottom)-yellow
        (up) purely to make this example easy to understand. Any opposite color
        and cube-position will do) 0) First layer: Let people figure out the
        first layer. If you want to teach them, this could be a possible method:
        0a) First layer edges: Put all 4 white edges at the yellow face 0b)
        First layer edges: If a white edge doesn't have the white sticker
        attached to the yellow center, hold it on the right side and do a move
        like R' U F' 0c) First layer edges: Rotate the yellow face untill a
        white edge "matches up" its non-white color to a center and turn that
        side a half turn, repeat untill you have formed the white cross 0d)
        First layer corners: Using the move R U R' U' (repeatedly) you can put
        white corners in the FDR-slot. This is really trivial, but difficult to
        explain. 1) Second layer edges: Use R U R U R U' R' U' R' and R' U' R'
        U' R' U R U R to put the UR-edge in the FR and BR slot respectively. In
        my experience, these are the sequences beginner like the best. I like R
        U R' U' F' U' F (U) and F' U' F (U) R U R' U' better. You decide. 2)
        Last layer edge orientation: Rotate the U layer so Rule1: Bad edges
        should be held at the UF-position (6 O'Clock) Rule2: Good edges should
        be held at the UL-position (9 O'Clock) do F R U R' U' F'. I sometimes
        explain this as Forwards FRU, Reverse RUF 3) Last layer corner
        orientation: Rotate the U layer so Rule1: If there is exactly 1 yellow
        corner that has yellow facing up, put it at the UFL-position Rule2: If
        there is 0 or 2 yellow corners that have yellow facing up, put a corner
        in the UFL-position so the yellow sticker faces left do R U R' U R U2
        R'. I explaing this as Right-face back and forth and full circle of the
        Up-face alternated. 4) Last layer corner permutation: Rotate the U layer
        so Rule1: Opposite colors are facing you at the UFL sticker and UFR
        sticker do (R' F R') B2 (R F' R') B2 R2. I don't have any explanation
        for this, except for the grouping I used. 5) Last layer edge
        permutation: Rotate the U layer so Rule 1: unsolved edges are on the
        front (UF-position) Rule 2: solved edges are on the back (UB-position)
        do F2 U (L R') F2 ( L' R) U F2. Sometimes I explain that the 2 U moves
        are because it moves the piece in the UF-position to the UL-position,
        which is a U move. I then explain that if the piece in the UF-position
        needs to go to the UR-position they would have to do F2 U' (L R') F2 (
        L' R) U' F2. (same, only 2 U' moves) 6) You are done :) I hope this was
        understandable and that you and the children will have fun. Don't: Learn
        them notation Do: Speedsolve it to impress them, maybe even blindfolded
        (a video of M√Ø¬ø¬Ωty√Ø¬ø¬Ωs Kutis 1;20 WR would do very well because he is
        young too) Do: Take one apart to show them the difference between
        centers, edges and corners Do: Let them play with it for a while after
        you have taken it apart Do: show them a 2x2x2 and bigger cubes also

        &gt; isn't too bad (i think). You'd probably have to order stickers &gt;
        from &gt; &gt; &gt; somewhere and spend some time assembling them, but
        it may be the &gt; &gt; cheapest &gt; &gt; &gt; option. Hope that helps
        some. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Good luck. &gt; &gt; &gt; -Sapan

        i think its sad how everyone is crying mutiny and being so ungrateful
        about everything that has been done already for the community. granted
        he is a personal friend so my opinion is biased, but i think people
        forget what the situation was before cubesmith offered very, very cheap
        high quality stickers at a moments notice, usually with free shipping no
        less. i think that anyone would be hard pressed to find, much less
        provide service that is even close to the normal service cubesmith
        gives. remember, he is practically a one man operation and receives
        quite a large number of emails everyday regarding stickers, if he spent
        all his time answering these emails, he'd never get caught up or get his
        equipment fixed. he did mention to people that he is in the process of
        getting caught up the last time he posted here, and has clearly stated
        his problem on the website, so its not like he's running in the dark,
        have a heart people, its just stickers. Dan &lt;dan_j_harris@...&gt;

        Well, on his website he provides an explanation, so what are the emails
        good for except bugging him? Also, what did he tell you when you asked
        *before* ordering? Cause 15/ 17 days ago he already explained about the

        actually this is a supercube, so neither chris nor myself has
        information up on our websites, chris posted the algs he gave me in a
        message, but i can't find it in the groups. what you need to do is solve
        the centers as normally, the 6th center can be solved with a commutator
        that is basically an A perm, shown below, worst case scenario would take
        2 to fix, recognize it like you would a normal A perm and apply it as
        such. for the OLL parity, the double parity speed solve version will
        work. for the pll parity it is a very nasty alg that is another
        commutator posted below, hope these help. centers 3 cycle (Rr)' F (Rr)'

        Your approach is to pedagogic. I belive anybody can learn to do Cross,
        working corner F2L (2 algs for last edge), orient LL edges (3 cases),
        orient LL corners (7 cases), permute corners (2 cases), permute edges (4
        cases). First two steps is mosty intuition, the rest is done using a
        total of 18 algs. This uses about half the number of moves the wery
        easies methods does. Algs for all the cases you can find in the set used
        for the pure Fridrich method. // Kenneth --- In

        wrote: &gt; &gt; Getting 50 cubes might be a challenge, but as I
        understood Dan might be able &gt; to help you out. As for an easy
        method: &gt; &gt; I use this simple explanation to get people started.
        It is the basic layer &gt; by layer method and requires 5/6 algs: &gt;
        &gt; (I am assuming white-yellow (light), red-orange (fire), blue-green
        (sea) &gt; opposites. I am using white (bottom)-yellow (up) purely to
        make this example &gt; easy to understand. Any opposite color and
        cube-position will do) &gt; 0) First layer: Let people figure out the
        first layer. If you want to teach &gt; them, this could be a possible
        method: &gt; 0a) First layer edges: Put all 4 white edges at the yellow
        face &gt; 0b) First layer edges: If a white edge doesn't have the white
        sticker &gt; attached to the yellow center, hold it on the right side
        and do a move like &gt; R' U F' &gt; 0c) First layer edges: Rotate the
        yellow face untill a white edge "matches &gt; up" its non-white color to
        a center and turn that side a half turn, repeat &gt; untill you have
        formed the white cross &gt; 0d) First layer corners: Using the move R U
        R' U' (repeatedly) you can put &gt; white corners in the FDR-slot. This
        is really trivial, but difficult to &gt; explain. &gt; 1) Second layer
        edges: Use R U R U R U' R' U' R' and R' U' R' U' R' U R U R &gt; to put
        the UR-edge in the FR and BR slot respectively. In my experience, &gt;
        these are the sequences beginner like the best. I like R U R' U' F' U' F
        (U) &gt; and F' U' F (U) R U R' U' better. You decide. &gt; 2) Last
        layer edge orientation: Rotate the U layer so &gt; Rule1: Bad edges
        should be held at the UF-position (6 O'Clock) &gt; Rule2: Good edges
        should be held at the UL-position (9 O'Clock) &gt; do F R U R' U' F'. I
        sometimes explain this as Forwards FRU, Reverse RUF &gt; 3) Last layer
        corner orientation: Rotate the U layer so &gt; Rule1: If there is
        exactly 1 yellow corner that has yellow facing up, put it &gt; at the
        UFL-position &gt; Rule2: If there is 0 or 2 yellow corners that have
        yellow facing up, put a &gt; corner in the UFL-position so the yellow
        sticker faces left &gt; do R U R' U R U2 R'. I explaing this as
        Right-face back and forth and full &gt; circle of the Up-face
        alternated. &gt; 4) Last layer corner permutation: Rotate the U layer so
        &gt; Rule1: Opposite colors are facing you at the UFL sticker and UFR
        sticker &gt; do (R' F R') B2 (R F' R') B2 R2. I don't have any
        explanation for this, &gt; except for the grouping I used. &gt; 5) Last
        layer edge permutation: Rotate the U layer so &gt; Rule 1: unsolved
        edges are on the front (UF-position) &gt; Rule 2: solved edges are on
        the back (UB-position) &gt; do F2 U (L R') F2 ( L' R) U F2. Sometimes I
        explain that the 2 U moves are &gt; because it moves the piece in the
        UF-position to the UL-position, which is a &gt; U move. I then explain
        that if the piece in the UF-position needs to go to &gt; the UR-position
        they would have to do F2 U' (L R') F2 ( L' R) U' F2. (same, &gt; only 2
        U' moves) &gt; 6) You are done :) &gt; &gt; I hope this was
        understandable and that you and the children will have fun. &gt; &gt;
        Don't: Learn them notation &gt; Do: Speedsolve it to impress them, maybe
        even blindfolded (a video of M√°ty√°s &gt; Kutis 1;20 WR would do very
        well because he is young too) &gt; Do: Take one apart to show them the
        difference between centers, edges and &gt; corners &gt; Do: Let them
        play with it for a while after you have taken it apart &gt; Do: show
        them a 2x2x2 and bigger cubes also &gt; &gt;

        I don't think this approach would be to pedagogic. It is directed to
        teach everyone how to solve a cube in a couple of hours. The method you

        algs+intuitive F2L), I think they will lose interest before they have
        ever solved a cube by themselves. This would be especially true if you
        had to teach 20 or more children at the same time. Also, read this
        again: "0) First layer: Let people figure out the first layer. If you

        edge+corner), but it took me much longer than 1 day to learn it. If &gt;
        you want to teach your method to get people started (18 algs+intuitive
        F2L), &gt; I think they will lose interest before they have ever solved
        a cube by &gt; themselves. This would be especially true if you had to
        teach 20 or more &gt; children at the same time. &gt; &gt; Also, read
        this again: "0) First layer: Let people figure out the first &gt; layer.
        If you want to teach them, this could be a possible method:" &gt; &gt;

        buy 50 or so &gt; cubes? &gt; &gt; &gt; Your approach is to pedagogic. I
        belive anybody can learn to do &gt; Cross, working corner F2L (2 algs
        for last edge), orient LL edges (3 &gt; cases), orient LL corners (7
        cases), permute corners (2 cases), &gt; permute edges (4 cases). &gt;
        &gt; First two steps is mosty intuition, the rest is done using a total
        of &gt; 18 algs. This uses about half the number of moves the wery
        easies &gt; methods does. Algs for all the cases you can find in the set
        used for &gt; the pure Fridrich method. &gt; I'm in eight grade and I
        taught myself how to solve it using the online tutorials. The thing that
        you have to teach them how to solve the cube in I don't know how long.
        Unless you think you can actually teach them to solve it, have something
        for them to learn off of after you leave. Why don't you have the little
        beginners solution book for them?

        I think I'm being very understanding. What I would suggest he do is
        create an auto responder so that we all don't feel isolated. Maybe he is
        a "one person operation", that's ok. I understand. But I paid for an
        order on March 20th and still don't have my stickers. I know they are
        "just stickers", but my kids have 2 cubes that don't have stickers on
        them and are asking me every day "did the stickers come"? I haven't
        contacted PayPal to complain and get my money back. I really want my
        stickers. If your friend could post to his website and give us an
        update, like he said he would over a week ago. If he doesn't want to do
        the business, then don't offer the product. As far as I'm concerned, I
        will continue to wait. I just hope I get them someday soon. If Cubesmith
        is reading this, I appreciate your quality stickers (I still haven't
        seen them, but from what I hear, they are very good). Here is a
        suggestion. When you get an order, set up a rule that automatically
        responses to the orderer giving some feedback on where you are (I'm 3
        weeks behind, so you may have to wait...). Some folks might be buying
        them as gifts, etc., and time is important. Anyway, just a suggestion.
        Asking the forum if there are other alternatives to good stickers is a
        reasonable request. I don't think you should come down on us for asking.

        he'd never get caught up or get his equipment fixed. he did mention to
        people that he is in the process of getting caught up the last time he
        posted here, and has clearly stated his problem on the website, so its

        Ok, if you only got a limited amount of time, like a day, then my

        window. (for the record i did stop on my breaks, get out of the car and
        retrieve the cube, and received some very nice statements from other
        drivers) i guess on the bright side i just needed a couple new stickers

        their website if you don't know what I mean. I recently ordered the

        to study math as a hobby interest. I'm very interested in geometry and
        this direction is currently my next one to try to study a little bit.
        Anyway these things seem pretty cool, the relationships of the lengths
        of the sides are given here: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Zome.html
        Apparently you can build a lot of stuff with them. My kit comes in about
        2 weeks, I can't wait! Chris

        I doubt your cube was hurt, except possibly sticker-wise. I'd be more

        Alright, time to admit it wasn't all that bad. Mostly because I'm a slow
        eater, even more so when cubing, so the pasta wasn't hot anymore, just
        somewhat warm. And the cube didn't fell into it all that deep as I was
        cubing at a height just above the pot, though in front of it (I'm not
        *that* dumb). I lost grip and the cube jumped forwards into the pot.
        Still very stupid and I was angry at myself. I keep telling myself
        "Don't eat and cube" but then I never listen to me. And I almost never
        drop the cube, but when I do, it's usually in a very bad situation.

        You should never just learn a single set of algorithms. You should find
        as many sets as you can. And when it's time to learn a new algorithm,
        try that one out from each set, and choose the one that works best for
        you. With that said, in my personal opinion you shouldn't be out the
        memorize F2L algs. I would recommend figuring most of them out on your
        own first. Then, after you understand how everything is working, go look
        up and replace your slower algs. In either case, whenever you are
        learning a F2L alg, make sure to do it slowly and understand what is
        happening. If you can do that, then you can make up new ways to create
        and insert pairs from different angles that you have never memorized.
        Use the algs as a hint, to give you ideas about the F2L in general. Just
        my 2 cents, -Evan On 08 Apr 2007 11:19:39 -0700, Omi Castanar

        I once had a friend who cubed while he was using the bathroom. It was a
        loose diy, and it popped rite into the toilet. The worst part about it
        was that he couldnt flush, or else the piece would go right down.

        Hi Ryan, I would be interested in the statistics too. One other thing I
        am not sure about is the fact that there are many half turns in the
        current scrambles. As we all know half turns do not change the
        orientation of corners and edges. If you consider quarter turns, then
        you only have a 1/6 chance of a half turn. With the current scrambling
        programs you have a 1/3 chance of a half turn. Could this affect the
        scrambling? An easy way to test this is to take 1000 scrambles and do
        some statistics on the orientation of the corners and edges. For example
        there should be an equal number of cases with 2 and 10 edges flipped.

        There are about 3*10^29 different 25 move scrambles, and about &gt;&gt;
        4.3*10^19 different positions. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So for each position
        there is around 7000 million 25 move scrambles, &gt;&gt; on average. The
        actual number of scrambles leading to a certain &gt;&gt; position is
        clearly going to vary, but is there any reason to believe &gt;&gt; there
        is any significant systematic favoring of one kind of positions &gt;&gt;
        over an other? Things do tend to even out a lot when done thousands
        &gt;&gt; of million times. &gt; &gt; I don't agree that the fact that
        there are billions of possible &gt; scrambles for a position on average
        means that something has been done &gt; billions of times. The only
        thing that has been done multiple times is a &gt; move, and only 25 of
        those have been done. &gt; &gt; I have emailed Bernard Helmstetter, who
        searched all possible positions &gt; of the last layer up to depth 15,
        and asked him if he has any statistics &gt; on the distribution of
        "number of solutions per position". At depth 15, &gt; there still should
        be a huge number of possible scrambles, and I expect &gt; that some
        cases will have orders of magnitude more solutions than other &gt;
        cases. Hopefully he recorded such statistics, or can provide information
        &gt; on the min and max cases. &gt; &gt; -- &gt; Ryan Heise &gt;

        It depends on how you define orientation. Your statement is true only
        for a very small number of possible definitions. But your overall point
        is still valid, because since the analysis should result in a "good"

        The only problem, of course, is you only get enough for a few
        applications and then you're done. And you're certainly not going to pay
        another $9.95 and wait-time from Timbuktu every week. So what clever
        folks have done was walk into the local megamart and purchase silicone
        lubricant. It's certainly better than nothing, but nowhere near as good
        as the real stuff. For one you have to be careful that your favorite
        brand (say Prestone) has not added pretroleum distillates which may ruin
        your cube. Two, the stuff initially makes your cube stick a bit and you
        must wait for it to dry after lubing before it does any good. Three, you
        have to disassemble your whole cube before spraying it for the best
        effect. And finally, after all that work, it still doesn't behave like

        I tried to do M2 E2 S2 and then eight random HTM and got pretty ok
        scrambles from those few moves. The firs three MES-turns breaks all

        There was a topic about this about 9 months ago on the rubiks.has.it
        forum. The cube lube from Rubiks comes with a disclaimer stating the
        origin of it. Basically, it is floor wax. If I lived in the USA, I would
        have ordered the biggest quantity immediately. Incredible that the web
        has evolved to a place where someone could open a store that sells one
        product (floorwax) to such a limited audience (speedcubers). But I guess
        this could be said for cubesmith more or less to. ----- Original Message

        I didn't do the math on it, but it looks like a normal distribution to
        me. The outer limits are a bit heavy to the left. If the program you
        used to do this is fast enough, you could try more scrambles. I think
        that this distribution is random enough not to interfere with both
        regular speedcubing and blindfolded speedcubing. P.S. (I hope normal

        Hi again, Here are the results of 20,000 random scramble sequences.
        Edges not oriented: 0: 29 2: 732 4: 5053 6: 8846 8: 4722 10: 605 12: 13
        Average 5.9367. The differences are not very big. Still I think this
        shows that there is a tendency towards specific groups of scrambled
        positions. For blindfolded solving the random scramble sequences give a
        relatively low number of edges to flip (=easier). Have fun, Ron -----

        Interesting approach. Are you proposing to use this approach for the WCA

        Whoever made this site is pretty *hiding*. Makes it sound like he's a
        cubing pro but then never provides a clue who he is. He even went as far
        as using this service when registering the domain to hide his identity:
        http://domainsbyproxy.com/ Doesn't exactly makes me trust him or his
        cubing abilities/knowledge. Also, I have a lot of that lube left and I
        just don't use it because I prefer my silicone sprays/oils. And he calls
        it "the real thing", like it has been produced especially for cubes,
        when in reality it's just a standard floor wax or so (as far as I know).
        Am I too mean? Not trying to damage his business (after all, it's not
        like he's the maker of the "revolution"), these are just the thoughts
        that came to my mind... Cheers! Stefan --- In

        pretroleum &gt; distillates which may ruin your cube. Two, the stuff
        initially makes &gt; your cube stick a bit and you must wait for it to
        dry after lubing &gt; before it does any good. Three, you have to
        disassemble your whole &gt; cube before spraying it for the best effect.

        There is one thing that stuns me with these numbers : "Edges not

        the average are smaller even though they exist). However,* in my
        opinion*, the occurance of these extreme values 0.21% (= (29+13)/20000)
        seems low enough to consider the current scrambling method a good one.

        As we all know half turns do not change the orientation of corners &gt;

        on how you define &gt; orientation. Your statement is true only for a

        Hi :-) 1 - Make intelligent scrambler that looks at pair-breaking and
        has a non-skewed mix of turning all faces and not too many consecutive
        turns about same axis (larger cubes) 2 - Make very long normal random
        scrambles. Spend a few secs coming up with a sub 25 turn solution (to
        that long scramble) using Reid/Kociemba 2-step algorithm. These points
        have been mentioned before, im just repeating them. Personally i don't

        area. Who is Ben? Cheers! ~ Chris

        yeah i was just logging on to tell everyone i talked to him today and
        all backorders have been filled and sent out. he will update the website
        asap to let everyone know that, he's also changed the operations side so
        orders are filled everyday not once or twice as before, so it should
        result in improved shipping times and smaller waits. check the website

        ok well custom logos have a different timeframe then normal stickers,
        there has to be at least 5 people or so that want them before he can
        produce them otherwise he looses money on them. the cubesmith email was
        down for while because it was full of people asking where their stickers
        were. the email should be functioning normally now, there isn't an
        alternate email address, i just called him, but if you try again you
        should receive a response sometime this week. yahoogroups@... wrote: On

        My conclusion was only about edge orientation. I only do math at
        problems that I suspect to have an interesting (practical) outcome. I
        don't even consider the current method of scrambling a problem. If I
        were the organiser of a competition, I would focus more on the question
        "How can we check if the scrambles have been performed correctly by the
        scramblers". I have seen clocks at competition that were only scrambled
        half and have had very difficult crosses that everyone was telling me
        had 4 moves only. I have been a scrambler at many competitions and all
        scramblers try and do the best they can, but sometimes they fail. I
        currently don't do any advanced math like this on the cube. I focus on
        making tutorials and helping beginners get started. And of course I
        organize weekly competitions. I do this mostly on the rubiks.has.it -
        forum. ----- Original Message ----- From: Ron van Bruchem To:

        Arnaud, That is a quick conclusion! This is only the edge orientation.

        i use a ton of moves for the cross and F2L, but read that you should be

        You may trust Stefan and you may trust me. Here is the source code of

        repeat c:=CubieCube.Create(Random(40320-1),Random(2187-
        1),Random(479001600-1),Random(2048-1)); if (c.CornParityEven and not
        c.EdgeParityEven) or (not c.CornParityEven and c.EdgeParityEven) then
        begin c.Free; c:=nil;end; until assigned(c); fCube.SetFacelets(c);
        FacePaint.Invalidate; c.Free; end; The first random number &lt;40320=8!
        gives the corner permutation, the second &lt;2187=3^7 the corner
        orientation, the third &lt;479001600=12! the edge permutation and the
        last &lt;2048=2^12 the edge orientation. Because the overall parity has
        to be even, the extra code is necessary which ignores cubes with odd
        overall parity. Btw., under Edit|Add Random cubes... you can produce as
        many random cubes as you like together with their generators with a few
        mouseclicks. Herbert &gt; &gt; Hi Stefan, &gt; &gt; You're right ! &gt;

        &gt; &gt; Am I too mean? &gt; &gt; Yeah, I think you're taking this a
        bit far here. Doesn't matter to me &gt; what kind of 'pro' he is or what
        his 5x5x5 times are. If the prices &gt; are reasonable, I actually get
        the product that I pay for, and it is &gt; what it claims to be then
        that's what's important. &gt; &gt; Now if you want to get into the
        discussion about whether Rubik's lube &gt; is better than plain silicone
        then that's another matter, and _if_ I &gt; were to blindly take
        someone's opinion THEN maybe I'd want to know how &gt; many years he's
        been cubing. But since I've tried both lube types I &gt; don't need to
        read random web sites for that as I've already formed my &gt; own
        opinion. &gt; &gt; Just my $0.02. Ok I take those, and apologize. Guess
        I get a bit emotional when people spread information I consider not
        accurate and there's commerce involved. Cheers! Stefan

        forgot to say that with "Edit|Add random cubes..." the cubes are added
        (100.000 cubes in about 3 seconds ;-) ), but the maneuvers are not
        computed. To do this you could select these cubes (with mouseclick and
        shift-mouseclick in the usual windows way) and use Run| Start Search for
        selected cubes. But I would not recommend to start more than 100 threads
        at the same time. A better way is to use "Run|Start Autrun for Two Phase
        Solver". Before doing so you should control the parameters in
        "Options|Two Phase Algorithm...". I would recommend "Stop Automatic
        Search at" 20 moves here and a "Autorun trigger Time" of 0.3 s. So you
        will get about 200 maneuvers per minute and the generator lenght will be
        &lt;= 20 moves (hopefully). The 100.000 cubes will be finished in less
        than 9 hours which will give you enough cubes to solve for a few
        years.... Herbert

        Hi Herbert! First, thanx for adding the ability to ignore errors
        (impossible cube states) in the facelet editor. I would like to add a
        request to the add random cubes feature. Add a checkbox to specify
        whether we want to come up with generator for each of the random cubes.
        As it is now we must click the run buttons to start generating. This is
        a bit tedious when making up 12 scrambles for an average session for
        instance :-) Best wishes! -Per &gt; --- In

        when solving 100.000 random cubes: Enable "Options|Free threads
        immediatly", else CE will not free the threads for the cubes. Windows
        does not like CE to have 40.000 handles open so CE would crash before

        generate another one, then let that one be solved, etc. I am looking for
        a way to input scrambles from my own generator (via batch-file, or
        internal-webserver), have Cube Explorer solve them optimaly, and then
        analyze the results (in Cube Explorer or in my generator program).
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Is it possible to get an optimal result from the built-in
        webserver? &gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe I could pass some options to Cube Explorer
        through &gt;&gt;&gt; querystring-parameters? &gt;The built-in webserver
        has to respond within a few seconds. You cannot wait &gt;lets say 10
        minutes for a web request to be fullfilled. So the optimal &gt;solver is
        not usefull for this purpose. We have had a discussion about this in the
        past. I wanted the webserver to respond as soon as possible, but you
        changed it to run for at least 1 second. (I was focussing on
        Two-Phase-Analysis then). Now you are saying that the webserver has to
        respond within a few seconds, but that is not a requirement for my use.
        I think it would be great if there was a webserver that you could feed
        scrambles and that would return optimal solves. I would even be willing
        to host such a server for free as I have done for the Two-Phase-Analysis
        before. I hope you change your mind about this. I think people want to
        use the "solving power" of Cube Explorer in ways that you haven't
        thought of.

        *Position*, which is not the same as scramble. &gt; &gt; One such
        constraint that has been proposed is to pick from random &gt; positions
        instead and have a program churn out a reasonably short &gt; sequence to

        probablity they should be &gt; appearing. And there was that 7 turn 2x2
        I got in Nationals06 that I &gt; didn't capitalize on... &gt; &gt;
        According to analysis by DanH and/or LarsV, there is a 5.xxxx% chance
        &gt; of a 4 turn cross for example. It is unclear to me that using 25
        turn &gt; scrmables we currently use actually achives this emperical
        value very &gt; precisely. Or any of the other theoretical probablities
        that I would &gt; consider to be desirable as to produce *truely* random
        positions. &gt; &gt; I believe Ryan is right, 25 turn scrambles do
        produce a skewed &gt; distribution. Some perfectly good and random
        positions simply cannot &gt; be reached at all with such scrambles. For
        us to be using this or &gt; continue using this, we just have to accept
        that. &gt; &gt; How skewed is anybody's guess, but I suspect it's a

        Hi Russ, I'd say it depends on the crack. I've had cracks before and
        sometimes they are very serious and sometimes they aren't at all. One of
        my best ever speedcubes, that I've since retired but for another reason,
        was cracked and I didn't notice it for a long time. There was cube dust
        in the crack and it obviously had built up for some time but the cube
        still turned great. I've also had cracked cubes where the whole center
        piece on my cube fell off during a pop because a big piece of plastic
        around the crack just broke off. I'd say it depends on the crack. The
        only cubes I've ever had disintegrate on me were studio cubes that were
        cracked. My good cube that was cracked was a rubiks.com one and it
        lasted for a while. This isn't to say all situations are like mine, but
        that is what happened to me in case that helps. I would strongly
        recommend not to ever drop your cube though ;-) Chris --- In

        I'm not sure what exactly the level of the damage is, but in general I
        think all speed cubers just need to get used to the idea that cubes wear
        out If your current cube is good, use it and don't worry about it. It
        *will* wear out, whether from that crack or from something else. I like
        to have one or two cubes "in waiting" that I groom to replace my current
        speed cube. Once the new one is faster than the older one, the
        transition is pretty natural. If you think it's too expensive to replace
        cubes like that, you're not doing the math right. Very few hobbies are
        nearly as cheap as this. On Apr 10, 2007, at 13:49, mt_highest wrote:

        Would it really make much of a difference? In picking out each turn in
        the sequence of 25, there is no bias for one axis/face over any other. I
        am not convinved it matters as long as one is being consistant. I'm sure
        there is a definition that is more suitable to the cube's symmetry.
        However, I assume he's using one of the definition used by most BLD
        cubers, and thus the numbers would be more insightful to judge quality
        of scrambles for BLD rounds. (If the definition does make a difference.)

        rotation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think it's that simple. Sometimes
        rotating the cube makes a &gt; &gt; difference, but not always. Think
        about the superflip position, no &gt; &gt; matter which way the cube is
        oriented all edges are incorrectly &gt; oriented. &gt; &gt; Excellent
        example, somewhat also underlining what I mentioned before, &gt; that
        there are several definitions of orientations. And that before &gt;
        talking about results at all, people should tell which definition &gt;
        they're using. Then something like the above wouldn't have happened.

        sounds a bit like you're thinking about orientation definitions you get
        by rotating and mirroring the cube. I meant the whole set of 4,478,976
        different straightforward orientation definitions for the 3x3, and they
        don't just differ by rotating/mirroring the cube. But like I said
        before, since the analysis should show a good distribution for *all*
        definitions, it should also do so for just one. If your favorite
        definition already proves to be a counterexample, you can conclude the
        scrambling method is bad. If it doesn't, you can't really conclude much.
        Only that your definition didn't prove the method bad. Another one
        might, though. Cheers! Stefan

        Quoting from h_kociemba's message... &gt; (C does not have a boolean
        data type) C++ added a boolean type (bool) several years ago along with
        constants true and false. And, as I found out from Wikipedia, more
        recently a newer C standard was defined (although existing C compilers
        may or may not support that standard) that also supports a boolean type
        (_Bool) along with a standard header (stdbool.h) file that defines a
        macros so you can use the C++ name (bool) along with true and false.
        &gt; if (c.CornParityEven &lt;&gt; c.EdgeParityEven)... is possible. You
        could also pick a number in the range 0..(239500800-1) for the edge
        permutation, and then convert it to a number in the range
        0..(479001600-1) in such a way that the edge permutation and corner
        permutation is the same. When I did my God's algorithm calculation for
        the permutations of the cubies (ignoring orientation), I used
        0..(239500800-1) to represent the edge permutations. I converted this
        number into the range 0..(479001600-1) by doubling the number, and then
        adding 1 if necessary to make the edge parity match the corner parity.
        My method for converting the edge permutation into a number in the range
        0..(479001600-1) was such that the least-significant bit of the number
        indicated which of the last two edge positions had the higher-numbered
        cubie. Since swapping the edge cubies in the last two edge positions (or
        any two cubies for that matter) changes the parity, it is guaranteed
        that one of these positions is even and the other odd. I used a
        239500800-bit lookup table to determine which was the even one and which
        was the odd one. You might not want to "waste" 30 million bytes in Cube
        Explorer for such a lookup table, but for my God's algorithm
        calculation, it was important to speed up the code as much as possible.

        the cubes are &gt; added (100.000 cubes in about 3 seconds ;-) ), but
        the maneuvers are &gt; not computed. To do this you could select these
        cubes (with &gt; mouseclick and shift-mouseclick in the usual windows
        way) and use Run| &gt; Start Search for selected cubes. But I would not
        recommend to start &gt; more than 100 threads at the same time. &gt; A
        better way is to use "Run|Start Autrun for Two Phase Solver". &gt;
        Before doing so you should control the parameters in "Options|Two &gt;
        Phase Algorithm...". I would recommend "Stop Automatic Search at" 20
        &gt; moves here and a "Autorun trigger Time" of 0.3 s. So you will get
        &gt; about 200 maneuvers per minute and the generator lenght will be
        &lt;= 20 &gt; moves (hopefully). The 100.000 cubes will be finished in
        less than 9 &gt; hours which will give you enough cubes to solve for a
        few years.... &gt; &gt; &gt; Herbert &gt;

        you should just practice, practice and practice even more so that you

        I've recently been hacking away at the source code to the MediaWiki
        software to turn it into an "Oracle". That is, a system that will try to
        answer any question about Rubik's Cube (if you teach it). Well, I kind
        of got carried away. here is the result: http://oosan.ryanheise.com/ The
        idea is that newbies can "Ask the Oracle a question" before they ask it
        here. The Oracle will also try to understand the same question worded in
        different ways. Of course, it needs people to write answers to
        questions, and, being a wiki, everyone is free to do that. I think it
        could be useful not just for newbie questions but maybe also for expert
        questions, since even those tend to get lost in the archives and get
        asked again periodically. I say I got carried away because I also wrote
        a number of extensions to allow it to be used as a community portal:
        e.g. polls and live feeds of all of our Yahoo! groups. Most things are
        editable by anyone. If you would like to create your own poll, add
        links, write answers to questions, this can be done by anyone through
        the wiki interface. Anything else I should add? I plan to write a few
        wiki extensions that will enable easier writing of Rubik's Cube related
        material, so that, for example, illustrations of cubes can be easily
        created on the fly. Also, I don't know yet whether my current server can
        handle such a big piece of software on top of all of the other things
        I'm already running. We'll see ;-) -- Ryan Heise

        Hi, I thought I would call attention to another aspect of scrambling and
        randomness of scrambles that seems to be overlooked in this overall
        discussion. Pseudorandom number generators generally have a fixed number
        of states. If you are using a pseudorandom number generator in a
        straightforward fashion, the number of different cube states that can be
        generated will be less than or equal to the number of states in the
        pseudorandom number generator. The typical pseudo-random number
        generators available in computer languages generators have rather poor
        randomness characteristics. The compiler I use seems to have rand()
        function that repeats every 2**31 (or 2147483648) invocations. This
        means that at most 2147483648 different scrambles would be generated no
        matter how many scrambles you tried to generate. Thus, only about 1 in
        every 20 billion (20E+09) 3x3x3 cube positions (at best) will be
        generated using all possible 2147483648 initial states of this
        pseudorandom number generator. If you generate a few thousand scrambles,
        you might get what looks to be a true random sampling of cube positions.
        But if you generate several billion scrambles, you will get many
        duplicates while never getting many other cube positions. If you really
        want the scramble algorithm to produce any of the possible puzzle
        positions with (nearly) equal probability, you basically need to use a
        pseudorandom number generator with several times more states than the
        number of puzzle positions. - Bruce --- In

        This applies if you try to just generate a single number and derive a
        cube state from it. So don't do that! It has no impact of methods like
        generating 25 random moves as a scramble, or generating a random
        position and orientation for each piece. Since if you generate 25 random
        moves, you generate 25 random numbers, rather than one. On Apr 11, 2007,

        attention to another aspect of scrambling and &gt; randomness of
        scrambles that seems to be overlooked in this overall &gt; discussion.
        Pseudorandom number generators generally have a fixed &gt; number of
        states. If you are using a pseudorandom number generator in &gt; a
        straightforward fashion, the number of different cube states that &gt;
        can be generated will be less than or equal to the number of states in
        &gt; the pseudorandom number generator. &gt; &gt; The typical
        pseudo-random number generators available in computer &gt; languages
        generators have rather poor randomness characteristics. The &gt;
        compiler I use seems to have rand() function that repeats every 2**31
        &gt; (or 2147483648) invocations. This means that at most 2147483648
        &gt; different scrambles would be generated no matter how many scrambles
        &gt; you tried to generate. Thus, only about 1 in every 20 billion
        (20E+09) &gt; 3x3x3 cube positions (at best) will be generated using all
        possible &gt; 2147483648 initial states of this pseudorandom number
        generator. If &gt; you generate a few thousand scrambles, you might get
        what looks to be &gt; a true random sampling of cube positions. But if
        you generate several &gt; billion scrambles, you will get many
        duplicates while never getting &gt; many other cube positions. &gt; &gt;
        If you really want the scramble algorithm to produce any of the &gt;
        possible puzzle positions with (nearly) equal probability, you &gt;
        basically need to use a pseudorandom number generator with several &gt;
        times more states than the number of puzzle positions. &gt; &gt; - Bruce

        And also, if you don't have a logo design ready, it would take a lot
        longer, cuz he'd have to help you develop one. Even if you do provide
        him with one, it might not be feasible or he might be able to improve it
        for you. Designs that look good on paper don't necessarily make good
        sticker logos, a lot of things have to be considered. Also he's not
        going to like bitmap-ish crap, it should be vector-based jpeg or
        something. I think it was about 5-6 week for me, but I thought it was
        well worth it. If he's backed up with regular orders, then don't pester

        Hi folks, I recently dug out my copy of Rubik's Games and started
        playing with it again. It got me thinking about what new Rubik's
        programs you folks were using. I haven't been keeping track of new
        programs as much as I used to and it would be interesting to hear what
        programs you guys have been using for timing yourselves on higher order
        cubes. Here is one you may not be aware of by Ken Silverman (of Duke
        Nuke 'Em fame) and Ben Jos Walbeehm which only appeared recently:
        http://advsys.net/ken/download.htm?#rubix I have tried it using cedega
        so I can report it works well enough to be usable under Linux although
        it is a Windows program. Evidently you can go all the way up to 64x64x64
        :) If you have written a Rubik's program I would be interested in
        hearing about it. I have an on-going historical interest in cube
        programs which I have listed at: http://cubeman.org/cubesoft.html (I
        realize it is out of date). There was another older program called
        "Rubik's Algebra" which was mentioned on the old cube-lovers list many
        moons ago which I never managed to track down. Mark

        I don't think that is too tedious. I think it's fine the way it is.
        Takes me like 2 seconds. Use the select all or shift-selection like he

        You should have listed you times. But in general, if you are truly
        serious about cubing and can imagine yourself cubing a year from now
        still, then I would recommend getting a speedstack timer. Go to the
        speedstacks website for it, and be sure to get one with a port that
        connects to a large audience display, also I recommend getting it
        without the mat and it would then be only $20 plus shipping the last
        time I checked. (I bought one when it was $50 : ( .) It's like
        generation 2.5 now it seems... Another thing to do is get JNetCube by
        Hunt on the strangepuzzle site. That keeps track of avarages for you,
        and it generates scrmables of the offical format. For quick single
        attempts, I still like to use Ron's v2 timer since it has huge bright
        numbers. That is a web-based java-applet that can be saved and run
        locally. There are many other options out there for a computer-based
        timer as well of course. You have to search around, especially cuber's
        links pages. The reason to get the stackmat timer is that they are
        incredibly portable - very good for long plane trips for instance. I'm
        still pretty okay with using a wrist-watch though, but technically those
        times are no good according to most rules for unoffical times now. It
        should time to the hundredths of course. Well, hope that helps! -Doug

        What types of programs are you looking for? Solvers? Timers? Those that
        do both? Programs for simulating cubes of various orders? All of the
        above? Just to add the the list, here's something really obscure... A
        few grad students at UMich in the Winter of 06 did a program for EECS
        570 class that allowed distributed computing and/or parallel computing
        (imagine a big room of computers on a LAN some of which being
        multi-core...) to determine a list of optimal solutions to cube states.
        It might have been for both 3x3 and 4x4, I know very few of the details
        but was consulted once or twice. I should have the guy post the program
        somewhere. &gt;From the grade they got, I'm sure the performance must
        have been something at least 50% return rate - at least N times faster
        than a program like ACube on 1 computer given a network size of 2*N of
        computers of the same performaance. -Doug --- In

        Hi, With regard to: &gt; It has no impact of methods like generating 25
        random moves as a &gt; scramble, or generating a random position and
        orientation for each &gt; piece. False! A pseudorandom number generator
        is not a true random number generator. If you call it enough times the
        sequence of returned values start repeating. It's like when you divide 1
        by 7 and look at the decimal digits of the result. At first the digits
        may look like a random sequence, but very soon the digits start
        repeating. In the same way, pseudorandom number generators eventually
        repeat their sequence. Let's say you have a scramble-generating function
        that calls the pseudorandom number generator function 25 times, once for
        each move in a 25-move scramble sequence. If you call this function
        many, many times, eventually you will be calling it when it is at the
        same point in the cycle of numbers as the first time the
        scramble-generating function was called. You will get the same sequence
        of 25 "random" numbers, and as a result, the same scramble sequence. The
        rand() function I use appears to have a cycle of 2147483648, and since
        25 and 2147483648 are relatively prime, you would expect that it would
        take 2147483648 calls to the scramble-generating function before it
        starts repeating the sequence of scrambles. As for choosing a single
        number for a random sequence, the rand() function that my compiler has
        returns a 15-bit value. The number of positions in the Rubik's cube is a
        66-bit number, so that rand() function would have to be called at least
        5 times to generate enough bits for an arbitrary cube position. If your
        scramble function only calls the pseudorandom number generator function
        once, you would only get 32768 different values, limiting you to 32768
        cube positions, and that is much worse than ~2 billion positions, of
        course. But both 32768 and 2147483648 are much smaller than the number
        of positions in Rubik's cube. You could try playing games like reseeding
        the pseudorandom number generator from time to time, but I would say it
        would be better to use a better pseudorandom number generator with known
        characteristics, rather than trying to play such games. - Bruce --- In

        call attention to another aspect of scrambling and &gt; &gt; randomness
        of scrambles that seems to be overlooked in this overall &gt; &gt;
        discussion. Pseudorandom number generators generally have a fixed &gt;
        &gt; number of states. If you are using a pseudorandom number generator
        in &gt; &gt; a straightforward fashion, the number of different cube
        states that &gt; &gt; can be generated will be less than or equal to the
        number of states in &gt; &gt; the pseudorandom number generator. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; The typical pseudo-random number generators available in
        computer &gt; &gt; languages generators have rather poor randomness
        characteristics. The &gt; &gt; compiler I use seems to have rand()
        function that repeats every 2**31 &gt; &gt; (or 2147483648) invocations.
        This means that at most 2147483648 &gt; &gt; different scrambles would
        be generated no matter how many scrambles &gt; &gt; you tried to
        generate. Thus, only about 1 in every 20 billion (20E+09) &gt; &gt;
        3x3x3 cube positions (at best) will be generated using all possible &gt;
        &gt; 2147483648 initial states of this pseudorandom number generator. If
        &gt; &gt; you generate a few thousand scrambles, you might get what
        looks to be &gt; &gt; a true random sampling of cube positions. But if
        you generate several &gt; &gt; billion scrambles, you will get many
        duplicates while never getting &gt; &gt; many other cube positions. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; If you really want the scramble algorithm to produce any
        of the &gt; &gt; possible puzzle positions with (nearly) equal
        probability, you &gt; &gt; basically need to use a pseudorandom number
        generator with several &gt; &gt; times more states than the number of
        puzzle positions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Bruce &gt; &gt; --- In

        &gt; I'd be interested in trying it out, it is a good price I think.
        &gt; (Though I still suspect the guy is making a good profit.) Was
        wondering where all these hits were coming from, so decided to pop over
        and see what was being said. Yes, I own the site in question. To address
        some of the points that you raised: It is in fact the same thing as what
        is in the syringes. If you've ever accidentally squirted way too much
        out and had it leak out of the cube all over your hands (easy to do with
        those darn things at first), you know it has a _very_ distinctive feel
        and scent. It is unmistakeably the same. Yeah, the site isn't the best
        looking thing in the world. This is just a hobby, certainly not a
        business by any stretch of the imagination. You will in fact receive
        what you order, but being a hobby it may take a day or two before it is
        actually shipped. I'm glad you find the current prices acceptable. What
        you may be very surprised about though is this is currently being sold
        at near ZERO profit as a short term experiment. (More historical data ==
        more fun number crunching). You have to realize all the costs involved
        which you may overlook at first glance. First, liquid is very heavy. And
        weight equals high shipping costs to get the stuff in the first place.
        Empty HDPE bottles and tops cost money, and it ain't measured in
        pennies. Can be as much as $0.50 each for the larger sizes. Ah, and of
        course those have to be shipped too. Bandwidth costs money. PayPal
        charges fees on incoming payments. Add to that labels, boxes, packing
        material, etc. What some companies like to do is have low product prices
        but then pass on all costs to the customer in the form of grossly
        inflated shipping. Since you usually don't see this until the last step
        of the checkout process I think that is underhanded and refuse to do so.
        Also the web is no longer a "build it and they will come" playing field.
        Even for a hobby site, if you want visitors you must usually pay for
        them, at least for a few months. Let's look at hypothetical site
        example: The absolute minimum cost per click is usually around $0.05.
        With a conversion rate of say 3%, when you go to site XYZ and order
        something, they may well have paid over $1.67 just to get you to the
        site. I think you can start to see how one tiny little bottle can exceed
        a few dollars in actual cost NOT EVEN INCLUDING the cost of the actual
        liquid itself. Sure, if I wanted to invest several thousand dollars and
        get some things by the crate I would save a marginal amount in costs.
        But being just a hobby I am not prepared to do that. So I do have to
        chuckle when I read comments on other forums talking about "big time
        profit". How many of you would spend 10 minutes filling up a bottle,
        packing it in a box, and printing a shipping label for less than a
        dollar profit? Not many, to be sure. Anyway, if you'd like to give the
        lube a try just pop on over and I'll get some out to you. At the current
        prices you don't have much to lose either way.

        In light of that, I personally think that he shouldn't be charging
        people until completion of services. In fact, thinking back to when I
        did that custom logo thing, I was a bit irked by it too. I guess I
        shouldn't just pick on him specifically. In general (unless it's fast
        food...), credit cards shouldn't be charged until either when services
        are completed or when the shipment is signed for. At the same time I do
        sympathize with places like dental work in low- income areas. I felt so
        insulted when I had two wisdom teeth extracted back in October and was
        asked to pay first. Later I totally understood why they have to do that.
        So ya, in conclusion it's a very complicated question in consumer
        economics. -Doug --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        contributing entries! Cool :-) There are some brief instructions on this
        page: http://oosan.ryanheise.com/Help:Contents To keep the database
        cleanly structured, we (the editors) should also try to express
        questions in a consistent way. For example, while the average user may
        refer to the cube as "3x3x3" or "3x3x3 cube" or "cube" or "Rubik's Cube"
        and the oracle will do its best to figure out what you mean, it is
        important that editors themselves don't write "the 3x3x3" sometimes and
        "Rubik's Cube" other times. I have been following the convention of
        always referring to the cube by its full name "Rubik's Cube" when
        formally entering the question into the database. We will need similar
        conventions for "Rubik's Revenge", etc. Of course, there are other basic
        conventions (for editors): - Questions must begin with an uppercase
        letter. - Questions must end with a question mark (?). - The word "I"
        must be uppercase. - Proper nouns and certain trademarks should begin
        with an uppercase letter. The average user need not concern themselves
        with these, however. -- Ryan Heise http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/

        here's something really obscure... A few &gt; grad students at UMich in
        the Winter of 06 did a program for EECS &gt; 570 class that allowed
        distributed computing and/or parallel &gt; computing (imagine a big room

        Rubik's programs you folks were using. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't
        been keeping track of new programs as much &gt; &gt; as I used to and it
        would be interesting to hear &gt; &gt; what programs you guys have been
        using for timing &gt; &gt; yourselves on higher order cubes. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Here is one you may not be aware of by Ken Silverman &gt; &gt;
        (of Duke Nuke 'Em fame) and Ben Jos Walbeehm which &gt; &gt; only
        appeared recently: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://advsys.net/ken/download.htm?#rubix &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have
        tried it using cedega so I can report it &gt; &gt; works well enough to
        be usable under Linux &gt; &gt; although it is a Windows program.
        Evidently you &gt; &gt; can go all the way up to 64x64x64 :) &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; If you have written a Rubik's program I would &gt; &gt; be
        interested in hearing about it. I have an &gt; &gt; on-going historical
        interest in cube programs &gt; &gt; which I have listed at:
        http://cubeman.org/cubesoft.html &gt; &gt; (I realize it is out of
        date). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There was another older program called
        "Rubik's Algebra" &gt; &gt; which was mentioned on the old cube-lovers
        list &gt; &gt; many moons ago which I never managed to track down. &gt;

        Even if each state took only one byte of storage, I think you would need
        over 40 exabytes of storage (4.0 x 10^7 terabytes). In reality, each

        &gt; &gt; &gt; Too bad you think the webinterface is only useful for
        people that &gt; build &gt; &gt; robots. It has so much more potential.
        I could be running the &gt; "special &gt;2 &gt; &gt; GB" version of Cube
        Explorer on my webserver and have everyone &gt; that wants &gt; &gt; to
        &gt; &gt; find the optimal solve use that. Also tests and analysis using
        Cube &gt; &gt; Explorer &gt; &gt; as a "solving-engine" would be very
        useful to many people that have &gt; &gt; written &gt; &gt; their own

        store this data. I will make you a fair price ;-) Do you really want to
        store all cube positions? Or do you omit the solved cube position and
        maybe all positions with generator length less than 10? This is a
        serious question: How much randomness do you really allow for your
        scrambles? A bit addicted with this problem I generated with my program
        1 million random cubes two days ago and advised my program to solve them
        with the suboptimal solver and not to stop before the maneuver length is
        &lt;= 20 moves. Here are the *suboptimal* maneuver length results: 13f:
        4 14f: 18 15f: 81 16f: 609 17f: 3893 18f: 23411 19f: 141366 20f: 830618
        So you see it is not difficult to produce random cubes which need 13
        moves or less. Would you sort these out then? Btw.: The zipped file with
        the million maneuvers is 15 MB. So a "smaller" version of your intended
        program could just select one of the generators in such a database.

        produce random cubes which need 13 &gt; moves or less. Which had to be
        expected. I think in a million random cubes, about three should be
        expected to be solvable in 13 moves or less. Those four you found with
        13f, can you please find out their optimal solution lengths? Cheers!

        &gt; &gt; What do you think ? I don't quite see the difference from

        With 6 degrees of freedom the tables show, that the chance that this
        value is &gt;18.55 is less then 0.005. So if I did not do anything
        false, the 25 move scramble is a very bad procedure. Especially the high

        tried again and get 12 expected cubes for 13f as well now. I did it like
        this: First I looked at the right column in this statistic:
        http://cubezzz.homelinux.org/drupal/?q=node/view/68 Multiplied the last
        number twice more with 13 (roughly the branching factor). Multiply with
        a million, divide by 4.3e19. Yeah I know, probably there's a statistic
        somewhere out there about the overall distribution, but I don't know
        where. Cheers! Stefan

        ZBF2L intuitively is usually called VHF2L, and is relatively simple. If
        you finish with COLL+EPLL, it's actually a really good system. If you
        want to never have to rotate, and only use RUL (and sometimes D) on your
        F2L, try orienting your edges at the beginning of your solve. Insanely
        fast F2L follows, and your LL edges are already oriented by the time you
        get to the LL. -Michael --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        thinking this way, i.e. that you want to understand how things work. I
        don't have a complete tutorial (since it is not my method), but there
        are essentially two skills that you need to weave together: 1. You need
        to be able to solve the corner/edge pair intuitively by itself. Read
        http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/f2l.html for details (specifically
        point 1 on the list in the 3rd paragraph). 2. You need to be able to
        orient the edges intuitively. For details, read
        http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/method/stage2.html#squares_and_edges
        specifically the section "Orienting the edges". In both cases, you need
        to be flexible and understand that there are many ways to put things
        together. This means that you will be able to see a sequence of moves
        that does (1) and (2) together. Since (1) is relatively straightforward,
        a deeper understanding of (2) will help guide your solution to (1). --

        Actually, VHF2L is another distinct (but similar) system. It is possible
        to do both ZBF2L and VHF2L intuitively. The latter is easier but
        requires more moves. The difference between the two systems is that
        VHF2L splits ZBF2L into two steps and requires fewer algorithms. -- Ryan

        generator has the theoretical behaviour if the probabilities are smaller
        than 0.05. So JNet has a severe problem with the orientations of the

        It's a little nicer (except at the high extremes), but that 23 -&gt; 248
        is not going away. And I'd estimate that the number of orient &amp;
        permute blindfolded solves scrambled via JNet is on the order of 10^[4
        or 5], so those dozen extra free EO's are not too comforting. Yes, they
        don't count for legal UWR's, but I find anomalies discomforting. It
        feels like I'm cheating a tiny bit, or someone is cheating for me. And
        what if more people start their solves by orienting edges before F2L? Or
        even use the Human Thistlethwaite? This "sport," formalized, is still
        relatively young. Do we expect 25 random turns to remain a standard for
        the next 100 years? &gt; Petrus: &gt; So can someone run these numbers
        for all mix lengths between, say, 20 - &gt; 30? I'm on it. Standard
        random-of-18-face-turns, then
        24x(random-of-those-15-turns-that-don't-retwist-the-previous-face), that
        is? &gt; There's lots of glory for whoever discovers the magic number.
        Really? Is there a cubing hall of fame? Where do I apply for admission?
        Is there a way to check the source code of JNet? Actually, Jaap's
        offical scrambler is of more official concern. From the comments, I
        think it's essentially an 18, 15, 15... scheme. Is there a simple way to
        modify it to output a few thousand scrambles, perhaps even into a file?
        We should remember, though, that we're really actually concerned with
        scrambles that are, for human cubing purposes, &gt;indistiguishable&lt;
        from random, not necessarily random. How many people notice, for
        example, that Ryan Heise's simulator's scrambles (even for BLD), give no
        cycle parity between corners and edges?

        moves I differ quite a bit from Lucas' experiment with JNetCube: Him:
        {41, 0, 2764, 0, 22444, 0, 44173, 0, 26360, 0, 3970, 0, 248}, Me: 42 0
        2895 0 23149 0 44489 0 25615 0 3673 0 134 Probably at least one of us
        made a mistake, or JNetCube uses a non-equivalent scramble generator.

        --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, Lars Petrus
        &lt;lars@...&gt; &gt; &gt; So we can finally answer the old question of
        how many moves it truly &gt; takes to fully &gt; scramble a cube? &gt;
        &gt; There's lots of glory for whoever discovers the magic number. You
        may &gt; even be responsible for invalidating all current cube records!
        &gt; I wrote a quick patch into CE to generate random scrambles of a
        given maneuver length. The following conditions were given: 0. All 18
        moves have the same probability . but: 1. Two adjacent moves must not
        turn the same face (like U U2). 2. If two adjacent moves have opposite
        faces (like U D') the next move must not turn any of these two faces. So
        if 1. or 2. were not satified another random move was taken. I generated
        2.048 million random cubes with scramble length 20,25,30,35,40 and
        counted the number of cubes which have 0,1,2,3...... flipped edges.
        According too Jaap the theoretical distribution for this should be
        exactly: {1000,0,66000,0,495000,0,924000,0,495000,0,66000,0,1000} What
        is seen is, that for a small number of scramble moves there are too many
        cubes with no flipped edges. Then I applied the chi-square test to the
        distributions.If the scramble algorithm is good, in 99% of all cases the
        chi-square value is less than 16.8. So if chisquare&gt;17 we should
        reject the hypothesis of a good scramble. Here are the astonishing
        results: m20={6247,0,84124,0,552610,0,892625,0,458001,0,53612,0,781}
        chi[m20]=45416.9
        m25={2755,0,75017,0,524075,0,911606,0,474435,0,59241,0,871}
        chi[m25]=7749.18
        m30={1337,0,69041,0,506102,0,921357,0,485578,0,63608,0,977}
        chi[m30]=776.807
        m35={1102,0,67609,0,498818,0,923714,0,491192,0,64626,0,939}
        chi[m35]=140.787
        m40={979,0,66490,0,497511,0,924236,0,491722,0,66033,0,1029}
        chi[m40]=39.4419 SO EVEN WITH 40 MOVES you get no good distribution!!!
        and 25 moves is OUT OF QUESTION Then I tested the same with my CE random
        generator and was pretty sure that all is perfectly right now. Sadly: It
        was not, Luckily: I found the fault Instead of
        c:=CubieCube.Create(Random(40320),Random(2187),Random(479001600),Random(2048));
        I coded
        c:=CubieCube.Create(Random(40320-1),Random(2187-1),Random(479001600-
        1),Random(2048-1)); With this corrected version I made a test with
        10.000.000 random cubes and got the result (I will put it online
        tomorrow)
        {10080,0,660511,0,4948308,0,9240725,0,4951253,0,659062,0,10061} with a
        chi-square value of 3.7 Herbert

        &gt; Actually, VHF2L is another distinct (but similar) &gt; system. It
        is possible to do both ZBF2L and VHF2L &gt; intuitively. The latter is
        easier but requires more &gt; moves. VHF2L is just the logical
        intermediate subset of ZBF2L. Comparable to permuting in 2 steps rather
        than one in the Fridrich's LL.

        because my results are also kinda "theoretical" (compared to the random
        simulation approach). Tomorrow I'll add the chi-square test. Also, I do
        actually have the frequencies not just for "number of flipped edges, 0
        to 12" but the frequencies of all 2048 individual states. I'll try to
        analyze that as well, because the "number of flipped edges" is already a
        summary where a lot of information is lost. Cheers! Stefan

        The basic idea is that for the first part of your solve, orient all
        edges correctly by getting four at a time on either F or B and doing a
        quarter turn. After this step, if you stay in the F2 B2 U D L R subset,
        that is don't turn F and B quarter turns, all the edges remain oriented
        correctly. In this sense all F2L algorithms can be done 2 generator and
        without rotating the cube. You could also do ZBLL. -Evan On 13 Apr 2007

        I've recently found my old Da Vinci Code Rubik's Cube (Philippines
        Version) and when i took it apart, i noticed that the axle was
        different. Instead of the standard black "screws" inside the axle,they
        were silver "screws" and it was really odd because the axle puts ALOT of
        tension on the pieces. So i was jsut wondering what type of cube is
        this? DIY maybe? and would it be fit for speed cubing if i were to
        change the stickers.

        out my copy of Rubik's Games and started &gt; playing with it again. It
        got me thinking about &gt; what new Rubik's programs you folks were
        using. &gt; &gt; Here is one you may not be aware of by Ken Silverman
        &gt; (of Duke Nuke 'Em fame) and Ben Jos Walbeehm which &gt; only
        appeared recently: &gt; &gt; http://advsys.net/ken/download.htm?#rubix
        OK. This is my first post here and I guess it could qualify as a
        "shameless plug" since I am Ben Jos Walbeehm. (And to introduce/plug
        myself more, I guess I still have SOME notoriety as the person for
        attacking the U-table on his Commodore 64.) The program Mark mentioned
        is something that Ken Silverman wrote. It displays a cube very
        realistically, makes sounds, has custom colours, keeps a history, can
        save situations, and so on. What I wrote was a solver. Actually, not one
        but three. An optimal 2x2x2 solver, a "pretty good" 3x3x3 solver, and a
        solver that solves ANY cube larger than 3x3x3. So it solves a 4x4x4,
        5x5x5, 10x10x10, and so on. Ken's program is limited to 64x64x64 now,
        but this can be increased trivially and my solver (as long as you pay
        attention to some of the remarks) will solve cubes of any size above
        that too. I had my own version solve a 128x128x128 just for fun. :P
        There's only one thing I'm not happy about... that is that there is a
        bug in my code... the code that Ken currently has freely available. When
        you use the editor to create a situation for my solvers to solve, it may
        sometimes crash. I fixed this already, so anyone interested in the fix,
        contact me. I have recently had my 5th or so revival regarding cubes and
        have come up with some interesting theories (I think) that maybe are
        worth looking into. So Mark told me to post them. I told him some of my
        ideas, but I still have to put them in a better format. Ben Jos.

        &gt; In both cases, you need to be flexible and understand that there

        good way to start is to learn all the base cases, cases with very short
        irreducible algs. Work on each f2l group at a time, learning how it can
        be reduced to other cases, and how each of the reductions flip LL edges.
        I don't know how intuitive that could be, but I think it's rather

        OK, I ran a huge test using my scramble generation code from last email.
        I used it to generate 100,000 scrambles of each length from 1-45. It
        took extremely long, because I was also counting cycles. The results of
        the solvedness counts (EO 0-13, CO 0-8 , EP 0-13, CP 0-8, EC 1-12, CC
        1-8) are in this file: http://cube.garron.us/scramblestat/scr_totals.txt
        For 100,000 "random" cubes from CubeExplorer, and a set of 100,00 cubes
        generated according to theoretical probabilities, I got: CubeExplorer:
        {{43, 0, 3248, 0, 24134, 0, 45215, 0, 24097, 0, 3215, 0, 48}, {3930,

        probabilistically generated cubes: {{34, 0, 3196, 0, 24181, 0, 45034, 0,

        32551, 32335, 16789, 4805, 773, 57, 0}} If you do straightforward
        chi-square sums on each of the six categories, you get something like
        these: CubeExplorer: {1.443, 10.275, 7.91489, 13.1464, 14.2199, 19.0312}
        100,00 probabilistic: {6.14985, 10.8045, 5.74321, 9.73557, 4.86605,
        11.2522} The results for length 1-45 scrambles are here:
        http://cube.garron.us/scramblestat/scr_chi.txt Note that they vary
        unusually sometimes, but generally follow a pattern. Blindly adding the
        six values these gives the following totals: {14784689825, 115090278,
        104693100, 36875271, 17131246, 7435318, 4174854, 310171, 1317725,
        787915, 442487, 268055, 149450, 91196, 52509, 33163, 19605, 11322, 7400,
        4186, 2928, 1914, 1547, 863, 569, 411, 311, 203, 155, 129, 101, 70, 102,
        83, 46, 41, 47, 56, 44, 64, 60, 38, 46, 31, 38} This is somewhat
        exponential-looking. Mathematica gives a pretty consistent fit with the
        values around 20-45: 38.8138+6142*exp[-0.385131(x+19)] (Yes, I know I
        could move that 19 into the coefficient of the exponential term. But
        this shows how I got the fit) The CubeExplorer set gives 66 and the
        100,000 probabilistic cubes give 48.6 66 fits the model at 33 twists;
        48.6 at 35.7 twists. With a bit of leniency, I'd say that the magic
        number of acceptable randomness as requested by Petrus: &gt;&gt; 34
        twists HTM &lt;&lt; Maybe 35. I'll give it a plus-or-minus of one or
        two. Again, this is a search for high-fidelity randomness, not practical
        acceptability. Things level out quickly (though not very evenly) around
        thirty (the derivative of the exponential model is -1 at 29, though that
        is almost a matter of scale). But really, the chi-sum is already in the
        hunred's by 25. 25 is definitely not random, but not horrible. I don't
        think it's worth suggesting to everyone that they should make their
        scrambles even 10 turns longer. For competitions, though, it'd be nice
        to use truly random scrambles. Kociemba (Should I call you Herbert?),
        would it be easy for you to implement a java file that could replace
        Jaap's official scrambler
        (http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#scrambling) with a
        generate-and-solve code? (since Cube-Explorer is not multi-platfrom
        -yet) It wouldn't need to be excellent, just give something around 25
        moves. Just a suggestion... But I'd love to see such a clean scrambler
        used officially. Why exactly is there an official defintion involving
        half turns in the WCA regulations, anyhow? So that, hopefully, is the
        end of my main investigation into the randomness of scrambles... (Now I
        only have to wait for Kociemba or Pochmann to find another mistake
        somewhere :-) -Lucas Garron

        &lt;0.01 . But: If the expected values are less then 5 you should omit
        this data, because then the test is unreliable. WHen applying this to CC
        the value reduces to 11, and then the chance is about 14%, which is
        acceptable. Herbert

        Hi :-) This is nothing more than axial control. Allow each layer on an
        axis only once in a chunk of consecutive turns. Once the next turn is on
        a different axis unlock all the layers on d axis again :-) For 2x2x2
        scrambles one locks both layers on the axis at the same time. U D or U

        Here's mine again: &gt; &gt; 1. Allow all moves. &gt; 2. Make random

        The Mid Atlantic Cube gathering was a success, our first get together
        consisted of 5 people, three locals from Maryland including David Barr,
        Chris, and Steve, then myself, and the unexpected (at least to me)
        Jasmine Lee. I left at about 4:30, directions were confusing, I'm not
        even sure when I got there. I was the last to arrive, the four already
        had their stackmats out, and ALL of their puzzles were scattered across
        the table. A couple 5x5s, a megaminx of two, some brain teasers, and
        3x3s, loads of 3x3s. I sat down amongst an unknown crowd, and just
        because our common grounds was the Rubik's cube there was no
        communication barrier, I hopped right in like we were all good friends.
        We had some pizza and wings for dinner, the food was great. We all cubed
        and showed off, talked about speedcubing methods, Jasmine talked a lot
        about her site. This guy Chris and I went off to the one end of the
        table and I showed him my blindfolded tricks for big cube bld. I
        actually ran through a whole scramble for him, showed him some
        commutators even. He caught on really fast, it was very nice to see that
        in person I could describe so easily commutators. It probably wasn't
        until 10:30 that we realized that we hadn't even raced yet! David put
        his children off to bed (now I laugh, I thought David was about 20 years
        younger) Jasmine started to pull out a program on her planner, and we
        began to scramble, we realized "Let's just pass cubes around and go
        random" I won most of the races. I finished off with about a 20.xx
        average ... I did have some bad solves though, Chris would beat me if I
        messed up (or decided to go with a white cross), I tried to even the
        challenge out a little bit with things like using an odd colored cross,
        or maybe solving the 3x3 on the 5x5. Oh yes, Jasmine set her own
        personal best time that night, a sub 20, non-lucky, that was nice to
        see. We concluded at about midnight, I then got lost here and there on
        the way home, I made it back in about three hours. The maps don't
        account for that extra hour, I suppose the computer knew where it was
        going ... Later, Daniel Beyer

        I like both of your approches. I think that expected values is excellent
        data to have. If you run chi-square on expected result vs. the randomly
        attained one, there should be extremely little difference. This is
        something that should be verified. This could show if the puedo-random
        generator within programs are good enough for waht we do. What has me
        concerned is that 40 turns is not enough to get "good enough" to random
        positions. Also, I think it's a breakthrough that Herbert has caught the

        Hi :-) If a scrambler using a sequence of random turns is not good
        enough to give us the desired permutation/orientation distribution, then
        why not have a "2-phase" scrambler then? First generate random
        permutation, then random orientations. Oh and a last step, find the
        sequence for that .... hehehe ;-) After all we gonna use the scramble

        your cube just sucks.. Get a new one.. Most people (me too) really like
        the DIY kits, that means that you get the parts and you have to assemble
        the whole cube by yourself. There are springs in the center (you can
        adjust the spring tension) which make it possible to "cut edges".. You
        can try to get a cube from rubik.com (DIYkit with stickers) or one from
        9spuzzles.com (from china, but very good quality). Those cubes will be
        very good even without any silicone. I also started with a crappy cube
        like you seem to have. I also was about 2 minutes back then.. I dropped
        about 20 seconds just by using silicone on my cube.. I dropped another
        15 seconds or so by buying a new Ideal/Arxon Cube on eBay and adjusting
        the spring tension.. I now use 9spuzzles DIYkit cubes and I averrage
        about 50 seconds (but there is still very much room for improvement)..

        So i have one of the new no-jack timers. Is manually inserting one an
        option? I don't have a degree in electrical engineering or anything but
        I feel that it could be don. Has anyone attempted/done this? If that's
        not an option, where would one procure a competition timer? Thanks, John

        Too far. But I'll make the offer to fix it if you can send it to me (MI,
        USA) along with a pre-paid envelope to send it back. I'm pretty sure
        that costs more than buying a new one though :). It's atually not too
        hard to string one yourself. It's basically a big loop of tiles and a
        single strange of sting runs across 3 consecutive tiles. There are 2
        strings (it can be thought of as one on each side) for every 3
        consecutive tiles. When in the loop formation each tile has a total of 6
        strings wrapped around it. Thus for a magic of N tiles, there should be
        2*N strings (although it is possible to have less but will be
        significantly less stable). Look at Jaap's site on a beginner guide for
        how to string. It's not too hard to get it working again. But to get it
        strung perfectly and uniformely (like mine are!) then you need to know
        exactly what you are doing (or find somebody who does). To start, what I
        would do is remove the loose strings (if a single tiles is out, I/you
        would have to remove 6 strings). They are kinda of tangled but each
        string is a loop that does not "link" (in the mathematical sence) to
        other strings. Then I would play out the other 11 tiles in a stright
        line on the table (pretty long). Then I would connect the loose tile
        using 2 of the 6 strings you have availible to the rest of it so like if
        it was XXXXXXXXXXX-Y (Y is the loose tile), then you place wo strings
        (one at a time) to connect the XXY part of it. Next you have to make the
        loop by connecting the XYX with two more strings. And finally the YXX
        with the remaining two strings. Also, figure out (trying normal flips)
        wheather the tile ties in the front or in the back. (You don't want to
        invert it and loop the wrong way.) I'm sure you can find a fellow cuber
        in your area that is willing to do this for you. -Doug --- In

        My (polished) program and its results are now online here:
        http://stefan-pochmann.info/spocc/other_stuff/tools/ There's
        documentation on top of the source code explaining the algorithm I used.
        If someone wants to add a chi square test or so (I don't know it so I
        can't do it), just put it into the "analyze" function which already
        knows the probability distributions for the 2048 edge orientation states
        as well as for the 13 number-of-flipped-edges states. Adapting it to
        corner orientation or corner permutation should be easy to do as well.
        Edge permutation not, because it has a lot more states and thus needs a
        lot of memory. If someone wants to do these things, I can help, but
        otherwise I'll be busy working on some other stuff now. Cheers! Stefan

        First of all, I recommend returning that timer if you still can. It
        costs only $20 for a newer gen 2.5 one that has a jack for sure. "I feel
        that it could be don." &lt;- A person with an EE degree would just pop
        it own and then know for sure. It's kinda 50-50 as to weather it's
        possible, even if it is it would cost 10-20 cents for the
        recepticle/port and someone to solder it on for you. A drill might help
        too... Go to the speedstack's website, and then look for the "store"
        part of the site. It's hard to miss. To the designers of the
        CALCubeTimer, how did you learn of the protocal used int he
        communication? I e-mailed speedstacks a year ago, and they refused to
        divulge this informaiton to me. I was kind or annoyed by it. My academic
        curiousity must be satisfied. -Doug --- In

        For edge orientation we now have three distributions: 1) The
        distribution for real random cubes (Jaap). 2) The distribution for a
        small number of randomly generated scrambles (Lucas, Herbert). 3) The
        distribution for *all* scrambles of that kind (Stefan). You guys have
        analyzed the quality of our scrambles by comparing distributions 1) and
        2). That is wrong. Doing that, you're *not* judging the quality of our
        way to scramble, you're judging the quality of the small scramble set
        your generater happened to produce. To judge the quality of our way to
        scramble, you ought to compare distributions 1) and 3). Additionally it
        can make sense to compare distributions 2) and 3), like Doug said to
        judge the quality of the random number generators you've used (and of
        how you've used them). Cheers! Stefan

        It's not really about finger/wrist strength. If you have a proper
        speedcube, it doesn't take that much effort to turn the sides.
        Speedcubers can move their cube quickly because the movements have been
        ingrained in muscle memory, not because they have freakishly strong
        hands. Even the fastest cubers would be slowed down a lot if they had to
        use a cube that sticks and is hard to turn. --- In

        In the configuration under stackmat settings, there is a checkbox that
        says "If your timer displays 15:165:165, change this box." That might
        fix it but I don't have that problem so I'm not sure. -Dan --- In

        It's kinda 50-50 as to &gt; weather it's possible, even if it is it
        would cost 10-20 cents for &gt; the recepticle/port and someone to
        solder it on for you. A drill &gt; might help too... &gt; &gt; Go to the
        speedstack's website, and then look for the "store" part &gt; of the
        site. It's hard to miss. &gt; &gt; To the designers of the CALCubeTimer,
        how did you learn of the &gt; protocal used int he communication? I
        e-mailed speedstacks a year &gt; ago, and they refused to divulge this
        informaiton to me. I was kind &gt; or annoyed by it. My academic

        This seems to be a problem with X because the way key repeat is handled.
        The only workaround to this is probably to turn off the keyrepeat by
        using xset temporarily. Ryan --- In

        &gt; It doesn't work for me. I'm on Mac OS X and I've downloaded the

        "CALCubeTimer.jar" couldn't be launched. Check the Console for &gt;
        possible error messages". &gt; &gt; Any ideas? &gt; &gt; Thanks, &gt;
        Joey &gt; Joey, That's too bad. I was hoping it would work fine. I just
        tested it using a buddy's computer and it works. Could you attempt to
        launch CALCubeTimer.jar from the terminal and see if you get any
        execptions? If you need instruction on how to do that, here's what I
        would do (granted, I'm not a Mac user). Make sure you know where your
        CCT folder (containing the jar file) is. -Click on the search thingy at
        the top right, and type in "terminal" -Once the terminal is open, type
        in "java -version". On my friend's Mac, I get this: java version
        "1.6.0-dp" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0-dp-b88-34) Java
        HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.6.0-b88-17-release, mixed mode, sharing)
        Hopefully, you get something like this. Anything about java 1.5 is not
        going to work. -Open the terminal prompt, and type in "cd Desktop" and
        then "cd CCT". This should get you into your CCT folder if it's on your
        desktop. -then type in "java -jar CALCubeTimer.jar" and press enter.
        That should attempt to run our program. -Copy paste any errors you get
        into this forum, and I'll try to help you. Please go to the effort of
        doing this if you get the time, I'd love to get our program working on
        OS X! Jeremy

        &gt; It would be nice to at least have a countdown option when using the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; timer with a keyboard, since starting a stackmat is a
        little easier &gt; &gt; &gt; than starting with the keyboard. I tried
        holding down the spacebar &gt; &gt; &gt; before starting like I might do
        on JNetCube with countdown set to 0, &gt; &gt; &gt; but this timer
        doesn't seem to like that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        itself. &gt; So do &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two separate timings? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, where would I find a
        microphone-to-microphone cable... ops, &gt; it's &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        standard audio jack right? So that's a commonly found cable like &gt;
        say &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on FM-transmitters for MP3 players and stuff
        right?. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Working great in Ubuntu linux 6.10 x64, though I don't have a &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; stackmat &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; timer to test that feature
        out with. I would like to see some &gt; sort &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; countdown timer for inspection time, but apart from
        that one small &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; omission I think the program is
        absolutely fantastic! Great job! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You should be able to start the timer with (almost)
        any key, by holding down any number of keys for any amount of time. The
        timer should not start until all of those keys have been released. The
        timer should stop immediately when any key is pressed down, and accepted
        when that (or those) keys are released. I hope that makes sense.
        Basically, it's supposed to function exactly the same as a stackmat. The
        linux issue is already known. I think I know how to fix it. It should
        work fine on Mac and Windows though.

        &gt; We managed to reverse engineer the protocol by stopping the timer
        at &gt; different times and figuring it out from patterns. &gt; &gt;
        Ryan &gt; Hem..., I guess that's what I would have done too. But that
        requires one to first accept the assumption that it outputs a unique
        periodic signal for each stopped value (as opposed to something
        stranger). I didn't know it was a standard 2.5mm jack either. If I did I
        could have taken an osciliscope to it too. Curious, is the signal
        digial, analog, or some sort of ADC step output? And what does it look
        like? I guess it doesn't necessarily have to be periodic, the time could
        be encoded in the frequency... Is it like a UART-ish binary encoding?

        So my answer to Per's question was totally wrong. I thought he was
        talking aobut the standard version not the server one. This jar vs zip

        the web browser (IE) handling it incorrectly. I don't remember the

        I just remember the term MIME. It's not my expertise though. Just do

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Joey, &gt; &gt; That's too bad. I was
        hoping it would work fine. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just tested it using a
        buddy's computer and it works. Could you &gt; &gt; attempt to launch
        CALCubeTimer.jar from the terminal and see if you &gt; &gt; get any
        execptions? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you need instruction on how to do
        that, here's what I would do &gt; &gt; (granted, I'm not a Mac user).
        Make sure you know where your CCT &gt; &gt; folder (containing the jar
        file) is. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Click on the search thingy at the top
        right, and type in "terminal" &gt; &gt; -Once the terminal is open, type
        in "java -version". On my friend's &gt; &gt; Mac, I get this: &gt; &gt;
        java version "1.6.0-dp" &gt; &gt; Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build
        1.6.0-dp-b88-34) &gt; &gt; Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build
        1.6.0-b88-17-release, mixed mode, &gt; &gt; sharing) &gt; &gt;
        Hopefully, you get something like this. Anything about java 1.5 is &gt;
        &gt; not going to work. &gt; &gt; -Open the terminal prompt, and type in
        "cd Desktop" and then "cd &gt; &gt; CCT". This should get you into your
        CCT folder if it's on your &gt; &gt; desktop. &gt; &gt; -then type in
        "java -jar CALCubeTimer.jar" and press enter. That &gt; &gt; should
        attempt to run our program. &gt; &gt; -Copy paste any errors you get
        into this forum, and I'll try to help &gt; &gt; you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Please go to the effort of doing this if you get the time, I'd love &gt;
        &gt; to get our program working on OS X! &gt; &gt; Jeremy &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Awesome! I'm glad I could help. Would you recommend changing the
        instructions (was there anything missing?) I hope you enjoy the program.

        &gt; The next question (or the original question) is can we design a
        better &gt; scrambling algorithm that achieves a good scramble in fewer
        moves? &gt; &gt; It would be interesting to run the same statistical
        analysis for a &gt; modification of the scrambling algorithm that uses
        fewer half turns. Quarter-turns only doesn't work. I ran that from 1-50.
        EO matches reasonably with Stefan, CO and EP are fine. But CO goes
        anomalous due to some parity that must have a good explanation based on
        cycles. Here are the number of corners oriented for 30-50 QT scrambles:

        considered orientations/permutations and in &gt; that space, we found
        that edge orientations were off. If we broaden the &gt; scope to
        consider other properties of the cube, we may find other things &gt;
        that are off. What if there is something that is even more "off" than
        &gt; edge orientation? I tried cycles. Seems a bit useless Except for
        extreme anomalies, I don't think sticker color counts are very useful.
        Should we define and compute "pieces joined"? Pieces correct relative to
        each other? A 2x2x2 block solved in the wrong corner involves fixing
        centers with at least four slice moves or some
        not-necessarily-so-obvious algs... Really, correlating pieces joined to
        an unfair advantage is a rather slippery business Crossiness?
        Extended-crossiness? Roux-blockiness? Easy corners-first susceptibility?
        And the problem is that these require simulations that take a long while
        to settle into order. Only EO, CO, and CP can be handled comprehensively
        like Stefan's. Or is there something else simple? I think that "generate
        &amp; solve" is really the best way out. It's not computationally
        expensive to generate a short solution anymore. -Lucas Garron

        Here's a scenario that happened a few times in the Berkeley competition.
        The competitor completes a solve, but happens to hit the reset button,
        leaving the stackmat showing 0.00. The judge clearly saw the display
        showing "21 something". I got a DNF, but I heard others got a time of
        22.00 in that case. To be clear, I don't care about my time at all, but
        I'd like for this to be judged consistently. I think the DNF is too
        draconian. The cube was solved, and we know the approximate time, so why
        not record it? I'd argue for adding an extra second to be sure. If the
        last anyone saw was 21.xx, it could have switched to 22.07 without
        anyone noticing, but recording 23.00 should be safe, and ensure no one
        gets a benefit from this. The other thing is that someone should build a
        little reset button cover to stop this from happening. Could this be a
        job for... Cubesmith? - - - - - - - - - - - - Curiosity was framed;

        In most European competitions I have taken part in, there were "small
        thick rubber rings" around the reset and start buttons of the stackmats.

        some really ugly POPs...haha...like...5 pieces flying away (on my good
        cube) but I guess that's what happens when you use a loose cube and try

        &gt; Petrus: &gt; I think the DNF is too draconian. The cube was solved,
        and we know &gt; the approximate time, so why not record it? I'd argue
        for adding an &gt; extra second to be sure. If the last anyone saw was
        21.xx, it could &gt; have switched to 22.07 without anyone noticing, but
        recording 23.00 &gt; should be safe, and ensure no one gets a benefit
        from this. It went up to 23.21.
        http://archive.garron.us/vid/2007/berkeleyspring/bks_petrus.mp4 And I
        remembered it stopping at 22, even though I recall watching that solve
        very intently for some particular reason. Maybe +5 is safer? If we use
        CCT, could it be optionally set to record the last sent time before it's
        reset? &gt; Morris: &gt; My first 5x5 solve had a pop where the pieces
        flew into the audience. Not exactly as exciting as you might expect, but
        here's the 5.8 MB video of that solve (pop at 28 seconds):
        http://archive.garron.us/vid/2007/berkeleyspring/morris_pop.mp4 And his
        58.91 4x4x4 solve: http://archive.garron.us/vid/temp/4x4x4b.mp4 &gt;
        Cochran &gt; just wondering if anyone there happened to catch a video of
        my 14.55 solve &gt; in the first round at berkeley, or the 1:17 revenge
        solve Don't think so... Since I'm posting, here are videos of my best
        times for speedsolve, OH, and BLD. (The latter two are now NR's :-)
        Among other things, my cube popped a center cap during almost every
        solve except the 15.89 and OH's, so these were extra-excellent for me.

        Nice cross, simple F2L, and a PLL skip that I didn't find until ten

        If I understand the protocal then yes, it is possible to do this.
        However, I don' thtink it's wise. Seting a time in such a way would
        deviate too much from what WCA accepts. The time it takes to lift one's
        hands and pick up the cube and the tiem it takes to stop the timer

        &gt; I think the DNF is too draconian. The cube was solved, and we know
        &gt; &gt; the approximate time, so why not record it? I'd argue for
        adding an &gt; &gt; extra second to be sure. If the last anyone saw was
        21.xx, it could &gt; &gt; have switched to 22.07 without anyone
        noticing, but recording 23.00 &gt; &gt; should be safe, and ensure no
        one gets a benefit from this. &gt; It went up to 23.21. &gt;

        I remembered it stopping at 22, even though I recall watching that &gt;
        solve &gt; very intently for some particular reason. Maybe +5 is safer?
        &gt; If we use CCT, could it be optionally set to record the last sent

        figured out how to interpret them, we (simply) wrote a program to do the

        &gt; You're right. It would be possible to record the last time sent,
        but I can guarantee that the last time sent to the computer will not be
        the same time as when the competitor would have stopped the timer. If
        you look, there is a distinct delay between the timer and the display.
        There is a similar delay between the timer and our program. Furthermore,
        the timer does not output at a frequency as high as it is capable of
        stopping at. However, I'm sure that a +2 would more than cover all these
        problems. Jeremy

        Using Stefans analysis we see, that using 25 move scrambles means the
        following deviations from the "true" probabilities for the number of
        correctly flipped edges: 0: -14%, 2: -10%, 4: -4%, 6: -1%, 8: +6%, 10:
        +13%, 12: +173% If this is acceptable for you I cannot judge because I
        do not know if there are any advantages/disadvantages when the number of
        flipped edges is smaller. Herbert

        http://stefan-pochmann.info/spocc/other_stuff/tools/ The Perl program is
        a puzzle in itself, hard to understand because I tried to squeeze as
        many bytes out of it as possible. The C++ program is my
        "almost-Thistlethwaite" algorithm implementation. For those who don't
        know this algorithm, look here:
        http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/compcube.htm#thisal
        http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/thistle.htm I think someone
        recently asked for a Java applet version of Cube Explorer algorithm, in
        order to produce high quality scrambles simply with a browser. Well,
        that might be a bit too much to ask, but the Thistlethwaite algorithm, a
        predecessor of the Cube Explorer algorithm, is fairly easy to implement
        and has a comparatively very low memory requirement. According to Jaap
        it averages 31.3 moves, and this can be improved by not just computing a
        single solution, but trying different paths. Cheers! Stefan

        http://stefan-pochmann.info/spocc/other_stuff/tools/ &gt; &gt; The Perl
        program is a puzzle in itself, hard to understand because I &gt; tried
        to squeeze as many bytes out of it as possible. &gt; &gt; The C++
        program is my "almost-Thistlethwaite" algorithm &gt; implementation. For

        http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/thistle.htm &gt; &gt; I think
        someone recently asked for a Java applet version of Cube &gt; Explorer
        algorithm, in order to produce high quality scrambles simply &gt; with a
        browser. Well, that might be a bit too much to ask, but the &gt;
        Thistlethwaite algorithm, a predecessor of the Cube Explorer &gt;
        algorithm, is fairly easy to implement and has a comparatively very &gt;
        low memory requirement. According to Jaap it averages 31.3 moves, and
        &gt; this can be improved by not just computing a single solution, but
        &gt; trying different paths. &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt;

        Many digital cameras with a high megapixel feature which can take videos

        solved, but I have no idea how to generate the lookup tables. I'm not

        ok well i've seriously tried now and can't get this thing to work. here
        are the symptoms and steps i've taken: laptop (ibm t60, windows xp) does
        acknowledge the timer is ON, but it will not start when i start the
        timer. i have tried values from 45-55 in the config options but still
        get nothing. integrated sound card, plugging into the microphone port.
        changed the stackmat battery to be sure everything was getting all the
        power it could need. my mat was used at a competition with a display so
        i'm sure that it at least did work, and believe it still does desktop
        also windows xp doesn't acknowledge the timer is on, have tried 45-55 in
        the values but nothing has changed. i am also plugging it into the pink
        aka microphone port. i do have analog line level input port (light blue)
        and when i plug it into that i hear some interested pulsing sounds that
        i'm reasonably sure are the 'noises' the stackmat makes to transfer the
        times to the tournament display. i know i have the right java because it
        opens just fine, and i've checked the associations just to be sure. also
        i thought maybe my old cords were going bad so i got a new cord and
        adapter at radioshack today which look to me to be the exact same kind
        you guys have in the picture, but still no love. am i missing something
        obvious, or is there a more in-depth troubleshooting section up on
        anyone's site yet? should i keep trying more values in the config

        We are currently in the process of updating the documentation of CCT. It
        is possible that the value does not have to be near 50. On my soundcard

        yes i'm sure i'm selecting the right input device, how will i know when
        i'm getting close? like on the laptop it says the timer is on, but it
        won't start when i start the timer, so is that a value problem? or
        something else? when i have the numbers right should it acknowledge the
        timer is on, and if it does say timer is on then am i in the right
        range? i also checked the input oscilloscope for the mic and do see
        small waves and stuff on it, and when i unplug it, they go away. does it
        show timer on, and i could still have the wrong value and just need to
        adjust it to show that, or if it shows the timer is on is there some
        input problem? i'm pretty computer literate so i think i have the basics
        down, for now i'll try every value between 0-100 in groups of 5 on both
        computers and see what happens, if one of you guys could answer the

        ok well my laptop i figured out in the soundmax panel there was
        microphone filtering on, apparently it was filtering out the input, also
        i needed a much lower value than 50, more like 20 for me. when i did the
        same thing on my desktop it started getting times, however it just jumps
        all over the place and gives weird results, lots of 15.15s and other
        weird stuff, i tried that checkbox thing, and it doesn't fix the
        problem. with any value over 9 in the config and it says the stackmat is

        I've had similar problems as Clancy. To get mine usable, I had to set
        the value all the way down to 2! I think there must be a lot of noise on
        my sound chip or something (it's built into the ASUS motherboard). I
        also can hear the "pulsing" noise if I enable the microphone on my sound
        mixer (this is Windows XP environment). The timer works whether I make
        it audible or not, but I still get extraneous garbage times, especially
        at the start of a solve (when I put my fingers on the pads). I really
        wish they would just make a USB competition timer. This whole analog
        thing is like going back to the late 70's when we used to save our BASIC
        programs on cassettes! Nevertheless, CCT is an excellent piece of
        software... I'll keep fiddling with it and share what I find. Chris ---

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; laptop (ibm t60, windows xp) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; does acknowledge the timer is ON, but it will not start when i
        start &gt; &gt; the timer. i have tried values from 45-55 in the config
        options but &gt; &gt; still get nothing. integrated sound card, plugging
        into the &gt; &gt; microphone port. changed the stackmat battery to be
        sure everything &gt; &gt; was getting all the power it could need. my
        mat was used at a &gt; &gt; competition with a display so i'm sure that
        it at least did work, and &gt; &gt; believe it still does &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; desktop also windows xp &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        doesn't acknowledge the timer is on, have tried 45-55 in the values &gt;
        &gt; but nothing has changed. i am also plugging it into the pink aka
        &gt; &gt; microphone port. i do have analog line level input port (light
        blue) &gt; &gt; and when i plug it into that i hear some interested
        pulsing sounds &gt; &gt; that i'm reasonably sure are the 'noises' the
        stackmat makes to &gt; &gt; transfer the times to the tournament
        display. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i know i have the right java
        because it opens just fine, and i've &gt; &gt; checked the associations
        just to be sure. also i thought maybe my old &gt; &gt; cords were going
        bad so i got a new cord and adapter at radioshack &gt; &gt; today which
        look to me to be the exact same kind you guys have in the &gt; &gt;
        picture, but still no love. am i missing something obvious, or is &gt;
        &gt; there a more in-depth troubleshooting section up on anyone's site
        yet? &gt; &gt; should i keep trying more values in the config options?
        any help is &gt; &gt; appreciated. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Clancy, I'm sorry that you've had to go through so much to try to get
        this thing working. I really hope that a new soundcard will clear your
        problem up. In answer to your question, I can give you a very brief
        explanation of just what the stackmat value is. I promise there will be
        a better one with pictures (on the readme) soon. So basically, we are
        interpreting the signal as a sound wave, and so it comes in looking
        something like this: ___ ____ | | | | | | _____| | | | ....whatever... |
        | |____ |____| We need to discretize these peaks and troughs into 1's
        and 0's. This should be pretty easy to conceptualize, but programming it
        is kind of tricky for a couple of reasons: 1. These peaks and troughs
        are not nearly as square as I have drawn them. 2. The height and depth
        of these are not uniform throughout the timer. 3. Finally, we've found
        that the aplitude also depends upon some other variables such as your
        computer/soundcard, and your OS. The "stackmat value" is a value we use
        to chop off the peaks and troughs and convert the signal to
        00000111100001110000 (in the example I drew). So it would make sense
        that if the value were too high, no peaks or valleys would be detected,
        and the program would see nothing but 000000000000000..... If the value
        were too low, noise will be introduced when is shouldn't be. This is
        harder to explain why, and I'll give a bettter explanation when I have a
        proper picture up. How this affects you: If playing with the stackmat
        value fails to fix your problem, as it appears, then there is something
        going on (either with your stackmat or computer) that we did not
        anticipate. This is worth investigating. If your new sound card does not
        fix the problem, let us know, and we'll come up with some diagnostics
        for you to run, so we can hopefully figure out your problem. Jeremy

        my laptop i figured out in the soundmax panel there was &gt; &gt;
        microphone filtering on, apparently it was filtering out the input, &gt;
        &gt; also i needed a much lower value than 50, more like 20 for me. &gt;
        when i &gt; &gt; did the same thing on my desktop it started getting
        times, however &gt; it &gt; &gt; just jumps all over the place and gives
        weird results, lots of &gt; 15.15s &gt; &gt; and other weird stuff, i
        tried that checkbox thing, and it doesn't &gt; fix &gt; &gt; the
        problem. with any value over 9 in the config and it says the &gt; &gt;
        stackmat is off, should i continue to experiment with different &gt;
        &gt; values, or is it more than likely something else in the sound &gt;
        control &gt; &gt; panel...thanks for the help so far :) &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; yes i'm sure i'm selecting the right input device, how &gt; &gt;
        will i know when i'm getting close? like on the laptop it says the &gt;
        &gt; timer is on, but it won't start when i start the timer, so is that
        a &gt; &gt; value problem? or something else? when i have the numbers
        right &gt; &gt; should it acknowledge the timer is on, and if it does
        say timer is &gt; on &gt; &gt; then am i in the right range? i also
        checked the input oscilloscope &gt; &gt; for the mic and do see small
        waves and stuff on it, and when i &gt; unplug &gt; &gt; it, they go
        away. does it show timer on, and i could still have the &gt; &gt; wrong
        value and just need to adjust it to show that, or if it shows &gt; &gt;
        the timer is on is there some input problem? i'm pretty computer &gt;
        &gt; literate so i think i have the basics down, for now i'll try every
        &gt; &gt; value between 0-100 in groups of 5 on both computers and see
        what &gt; &gt; happens, if one of you guys could answer the questions i
        posed her &gt; &gt; that would be helpful, thanks a &gt; &gt; &gt; ton,
        i like the program a lot already and i haven't even got to &gt; use &gt;
        &gt; the best features, &gt; &gt; &gt; great job :) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        hey no problem, i firmly believe it is worth the hassle :). i'm getting
        the soundcard tonite on the way home, but soundmax is pretty common as
        far as onboard sound goes, so if you guys have any diagnostics i can run
        and it would help you out let me know. i do have an older stackmat as
        well, and it has been beaten a little, i assume it should work because
        it works on the laptop. also if it works on the laptop, there isn't any
        settings or anything that should automatically transfer right, since you
        said it is based on the particular hardware on that computer, not the
        stackmat itself, right? Jeremy Fleischman &lt;jeremyfleischman@...&gt;
        wrote: Clancy, I'm sorry that you've had to go through so much to try to
        get this thing working. I really hope that a new soundcard will clear
        your problem up. In answer to your question, I can give you a very brief
        explanation of just what the stackmat value is. I promise there will be
        a better one with pictures (on the readme) soon. So basically, we are
        interpreting the signal as a sound wave, and so it comes in looking
        something like this: ___ ____ | | | | | | _____| | | | ....whatever... |
        | |____ |____| We need to discretize these peaks and troughs into 1's
        and 0's. This should be pretty easy to conceptualize, but programming it
        is kind of tricky for a couple of reasons: 1. These peaks and troughs
        are not nearly as square as I have drawn them. 2. The height and depth
        of these are not uniform throughout the timer. 3. Finally, we've found
        that the aplitude also depends upon some other variables such as your
        computer/soundcard, and your OS. The "stackmat value" is a value we use
        to chop off the peaks and troughs and convert the signal to
        00000111100001110000 (in the example I drew). So it would make sense
        that if the value were too high, no peaks or valleys would be detected,
        and the program would see nothing but 000000000000000..... If the value
        were too low, noise will be introduced when is shouldn't be. This is
        harder to explain why, and I'll give a bettter explanation when I have a
        proper picture up. How this affects you: If playing with the stackmat
        value fails to fix your problem, as it appears, then there is something
        going on (either with your stackmat or computer) that we did not
        anticipate. This is worth investigating. If your new sound card does not
        fix the problem, let us know, and we'll come up with some diagnostics
        for you to run, so we can hopefully figure out your problem. Jeremy

        get weird flashes of times, usually something with 15 in it. the

        sure what that value actually does, maybe some explanation would help. i
        think i'm going to go buy a real sound card today, probably some pci

        onboard sound, if that works, i'll let you know. my board is an
        intel865gbf btw. &gt; &gt; christopher_pelley

        something (it's built into the ASUS &gt; motherboard). I also can hear
        the "pulsing" noise if I enable the &gt; microphone on my sound mixer
        (this is Windows XP environment). The &gt; timer works whether I make it
        audible or not, but I still get &gt; extraneous garbage times,
        especially at the start of a solve (when I &gt; put my fingers on the
        pads). &gt; &gt; I really wish they would just make a USB competition
        timer. This &gt; whole analog thing is like going back to the late 70's

        &gt; So basically, we are interpreting the signal as a sound wave, and
        so &gt; it comes in looking something like this: &gt; ___ &gt; ____ | |
        &gt; | | | | &gt; _____| | | | ....whatever... &gt; | | |____ &gt;

        The program should be completely stackmat independent, since all our
        tests have shown different stackmats outputting the same signal. This
        makes sense, given that all the stackmats work with the displays.
        However, I'll admit that we have stumbled across some very wierd
        problems where a machine would somehow have issues with newer timers as
        opposed to older ones. We believe we fixed this problem. If your new
        soundcard doesn't work, our diagnostics will let us know whether there
        still is a stackmat-dependent problem. Just keep us updated! Jeremy ---

        you out let me know. i do have an older stackmat as well, and it has
        been beaten a little, i assume it should work because it works on the

        anything that should automatically transfer right, since you said it is
        based on the particular hardware on that computer, not the stackmat

        UMTS &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; UMTS stands for
        Ultimate Multiple Timer Support. There is a &gt; server &gt; &gt; &gt;

        remotely. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can see everybody's times, and
        people can choose to have &gt; the same &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        scrambles. In addition, if you have multiple soundcards (usb or &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; otherwise) then you can start up multiple instances
        of CCT &gt; and run &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them all with different

        You state that a stackmat display is required. While it would be nice, I
        don't see in the regulations where the $100 display is required for each
        station, just the timers themselves. Yes, I know with the CalCubeTimer,

        Great page! Well structured, almost no redundant information. I do have
        some possible additions: 1) Preferred and backup hotels. Especially for
        &gt; 1 day competitions and competitions with a lot of
        out-of-towners/foreigners 2) Generate scrambles in advance and seal
        them. Even better, let the WCA send scrambles in a sealed envelop to all
        official WCA competitions. Why not do it "Just-In-Time" at the
        competition? Because sometimes internet doesn't work! And a competition
        without scrambles.............Is called a cube meeting. 3) Encourage
        competitions to have something unique. A special event, a host,
        bigscreen + camera's, Rubot, toy-fair, Olympic Cubes, meet-and-greet
        with mr. Rubiks, etc. I hope this helps, Arnaud --------- Oorspronkelijk

        Though not required, they certainly add to the atmosphere and can be
        rented (I think free of charge). So far all 15 competitions I've been to
        have had them, so I consider it to be almost like an unwritten rule. Bob

        e-mail to have them match a competition in California on the same day. I

        so i've been trying to talk frank into using the olympic cubes 5x5 in a
        competition, but he has been pretty reluctant because the regulations
        aren't really clear. in article 3 of the wca regulation i don't see
        anything that says that's a problem, and there is a specific spot in the
        wca regulations that says 'we allow all brands of puzzles' so is this a
        big deal or not, as far as regulations are concerned. i'm sure there
        will be a squadron of boo-hoo'ers, but that's not really a concern, i
        just wanted to know if the times would end up getting thrown out or
        disallowed by wca. i can think of many other puzzles that people use
        that aren't generally available to most people, ie gamecubes, deluxe,
        the zauberwurfel (sp?) and other old cubes, that most people would be
        hard pressed to find. also the square one isn't that easy to find

        &gt; &gt; Bob &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bob, your timing is
        impeccable. Thanks, I appreciate you taking the &gt; &gt; &gt; time and
        putting forth the effort. I will definitely use this as a &gt; &gt; &gt;
        guideline to ensure I am on the right track for the Canadian Open. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At some point, I'd like to see us move away
        from Excel sheets for &gt; &gt; &gt; score keeping. It seems like a poor
        way to do it, especially given &gt; &gt; &gt; all of the
        programmers/developers the community has as its disposal. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        I believe I had read someone or group was working on something to &gt;
        &gt; &gt; replace this, but it seems shrouded in secrecy. It is
        something that &gt; &gt; &gt; the WCA should probably initiate and
        provide updates on so there are &gt; &gt; &gt; not multiple people
        trying to create the same thing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Question:
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Under which scenario does the WCA actually send the
        scrambles out for &gt; &gt; &gt; a competition? I was not aware that was
        an option. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And on the topic of
        competitions, here is our video promo for the &gt; &gt; &gt; Canadian

        I've been waiting for another one of these posts about Cubesmith. In my
        opinion we should give him a break. How many times has he gotten this
        far behind, and it's only due to a machine breaking. He has always been
        our best source for replacement stickers. I think we should just relax a
        bit and realize his machine is down and he is doing the best he can
        right now and soon it will back to normal. Thanks Cubesmith for the best

        F2L - First 2 Layers basically getting a corner and its corresponding
        edge in the correct place at the same time. OLL - Oreintation of the
        Last Layer making all of the corner and edge pieces flip to become the
        color of the last layer PLL - Permutation of the last layer placing
        corner and edges into there correct spots. I use Fridrich Method with
        cross on left I think Leyan does it like that some people also prefer

        Those puzzles you mention were at least at some point generally

        Zauberw√ºrfel is a generic term, just means "magic cube", applies to

        this? &gt; Yeah, I think he still is backed up. I ordered some stickers
        on April 1st, and they haven't come yet. He should be getting it fixed
        soon, and some of my friends who ordered mid-late march have started
        getting their orders. Ethan . &gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this

        well honestly i don't see its much of an advantage its not like he's
        getting sub 90 times on the OC versus the regular ones. and i think
        there are very few people that can give him a run on the 5x5 anyway,
        anyone that seriously has a problem with it is probably just grasping at
        straws anyway, because they know he would probably beat them anyway. and
        it follows the guidelines of the rules that its a normal moving puzzle
        with comparison to the other 5x5's that are out. if i built my own 5x5
        that i thought was great i'd want to use it. he's a much nicer and fair
        guy than me honestly, but i'm just curious to what the wca would do? not
        allowed, throw out the times, or other equally bad things, does anyone
        from the board have something to say about it? i think unless we are all
        required to use the same brand, make, and model of cubes, it seems
        rather selfish to disallow a certain kind, just because other people
        can't get them. getting a deluxe cube or a game cube is a matter of
        timing and luck, just like getting the OC's were for him. he has been a
        pioneer of 5x5 times, and from his hard work he was afforded an
        opportunity, that i think he should be able to capitalize on. i tried to

        ok. I thought he was reluctant because he himself didn't want to have an
        advantage because of it. well i can't comment on every single thing
        frank does and doesn't think exactly about it, i'm sure he'd be willing
        to tell you if you asked &gt; i can think of many other puzzles that
        people use that aren't generally available to most people, ie gamecubes,
        deluxe, the zauberwurfel (sp?) 1) The "generally available" requirement
        was thrown out:
        http://worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/regulations_history.html 2)
        Those puzzles you mention were at least at some point generally
        available, and do appear on ebay fairly often. Not the Olympicubes. i'd
        say were available and are available are 2 very different things. unless
        you were alive during the times they were available you're not going to
        be able to get them, and especially not on a mass scale where everyone
        that wants one can get it. i don't know lots of 'old cube' terms, i just
        know the ones that acutally say zauberwurfel that are the plastic cases
        are supposed to be good for speedcubes and are pretty rare. 3)
        Zauberw√ºrfel is a generic term, just means "magic cube", applies to
        pretty much any cubes, no? &gt; also the square one isn't that easy to
        find anymore.
        http://cubikon.de/product_info.php?products_id=1018&amp;language=en (and
        plenty more on ebay) that's not a an original square one, its a cube 21,
        and anything on ebay i don't think i'd agree is 'generally available'
        because everyone that wants one can't get it. Cheers! Stefan Messages in

        haha i wish. i've never even got to see one in person, and with my
        mediocre times it would take a hell of a lot more than an oc to make my

        do as well as he can, and even if it wasn't frank that had the ocs, i
        wouldn't mind because i'd like to see what can be done with 5x5 solving,

        If you think Fridrich is too much to handle at one time, you could try
        keyhole (also known as working corner). This does not requirere any
        extra algorithms to learn, but saves about 15 moves. I made a tutorial
        (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ-qIyScA5o) and some demo-solves

        AM Subject: [Speed cubing group] advancing I recently started to do
        rubiks cubes maybe a month ago. I was wondering what I should go to
        next. I've done Leyan Lo's Beginner's guide. With this I average about a
        minute and a half. Wondering if i should go to the Fridrich method or do
        somthing else, or even just having to get faster. any advice is
        appreciated. BTW even though i know how to solve a rubik's cube i'm
        still confused on the abbr such as OLL and F2L. Thanks, Contact me at

        http://www.deepcube.net/intermediate.html?#whitecorners is a very good
        stepping stone between fridrich and beginner methods. Its a good method
        to learn complete pll and oll with all edges already correctly oriented.
        It f2l is also fairly fast, and avg of 40? is very possible with this

        The room was way too small. Unfortunately, we didn't realize that many
        people were going to show up because people didn't preregister until a
        lot later. By then, we were unable to get a larger room. I guess people
        don't understand the reason we ask everyone to preregister is so that we
        can accommodate everyone. It doesn't help us out when 40 more people
        preregister the week before the tournament. Next semester we're going to
        start planning further in advance and hopefully we'll be able to reserve
        a much larger room. Oh, and hopefully next semester we'll have our own
        equipment so that we can set up earlier on our own in order to get
        started on time. Oh, and while I'm at it, I want to thank the Caltech
        people for letting us use their equipment and also to all the
        competitors that came out. I hope you had fun and I apologize for it
        being so hectic. I promise next semester's tournament will be better.

        Have you tried looking? Not to come across as an ass or anything, but
        just pointing out people would probably be more likely to help you if
        there was evidence you had put forth some effort first. And Google
        doesn't even require that much effort. (Neither does spelling
        "blindfolded" correctly) In any case, Tyson Mao, Shotaro Makisumi and
        Stefan Pochmann have all written blindfolding guides that are available

        Please explain this logic. If Olympicubes aren't allowed until they're
        available to anyone, I would think that would be more incentive to use
        them. I always thought Frank didn't use it just so he wouldn't get
        criticism if he broke the record, because there would always be someone
        out there saying, "Well, he wouldn't have the record if he didn't have

        problem using it. Note: I don't know Frank, but that's just my guess.

        if frank breaks the world record, its not because of a cube, its because
        of his superior skill. i think if anyone believes that, they are
        probably just jealous of his accomplishments so far, and are just
        looking for a reason to keep him advancing further. if i was going to
        use it i doubt anyone would care because the chances of me breaking the
        wr is pretty slim, so why should frank be punished because he's worked
        harder and has more skill? i thought after being gone all weekend there
        would be an authoritative answer from someone on the wca board, is there
        some hold up about this question or am i posting it in the wrong place?
        i'll be happy to post it on the wca website if it will get an
        acknowledgment from someone in a regulatory position to answer. i'm not
        really interested in what people's personal feelings are on the issue, i
        want to know if it was used in a competition would the times end up
        being disqualified or would there not be a problem? amiejl1981

        only one correction i want to say i didn't say it should be based on
        taxes, but the amount of bills/rent you have to pay to sustain yourself.
        it was a joke, and i do know most kids are in school and that takes a

        I've been keeping up wiht this conversation and interested in what has
        to be said. So I must express my disappointment in not seeing an

        Rutger's Tournmanet was great. I won the 5x5 event! Hsu popped twice

        and am not even sure if I still know it *now* that you've mentioned
        these pages to me. The official place that mentions WCA rules and
        regulations is at the WCA website, and it is not clear from, say,
        Article 8 that a competition can change any of these rules, except for
        imposing time limits (8d). The rules for allowed cubes are in Article 3,
        and according to that, non-Rubik's brands are allowed, but somehow at
        WC2007, according to the link you gave me, non-Rubik's brands are not
        allowed. Which clause in the official WCA rules and regulations allows a
        sponsor to change those rules? The document makes it clear that time
        limits may be changed, but not that rules in Article 3 can be changed.
        I'm not saying that it isn't there, but just that it's just not clear,
        which I think is a problem. In the future, I will write a post on the
        WCA forum detailing the articles/clauses that I think are ambiguous or
        unclear, or the ones that really state nothing and could be deleted
        without having any effect. I agree that that discussion belongs there.
        But as for whether the community thinks the WCA should allow sponsors to
        make such rule changes described above, I don't mind if we discuss that
        here. Here are my thoughts: - According to Ron's earlier
        statement/question "Do you think I like this situation?" it sounds like
        the WCA are being pressured into allowing this (the fact that the WCA
        regulations don't make it clear that they /can/ allow this is a
        different matter). Somehow I feel we still don't have the full story on
        this. I don't know exactly what the "situation" is that Ron speaks of. -
        Assuming it is that the sponsor in question is the owner of the Rubik's
        trademark and that they may exercise legal power to shut down the WCA if
        they do not agree to block non-rubik's brands, well I say we don't have
        anything to worry about there. If you don't think so, then the WCA
        should hire a lawyer to look into it, seriously. (IANAL, but I am
        familiar with the registered trademarks) - If it is that the sponsor is
        a major money provider and so the WCA has decided to allow the sponsor
        to block out competing brands just to get the money, then I have no
        respect for this, sorry. If the WCA were more strict to sponsors about
        allowing all brands equally in all competitions, I honestly think they
        will just quietly go along with it. Can you really imagine the owner of
        the Rubik's trademark making a big legal fuss about the WCA and try to
        shut it down? I don't think it will happen (or even /could/ happen), but
        even hypothetically if it did, it would still be good publicity for the
        WCA. -- Ryan Heise http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/

        Some results from Rutgers Spring 2007: 3x3: Mitchell Stern 14.xx average
        Anthony Hsu 15.xx Ian Winokur 16.5x 5x5: Doug Li 2:3x.xx average Magic
        &amp; Master Magic: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place were Tim Reynolds, Bob
        Burton, and Peter Greenwood 3x3 OH: Anthony Hsu BLD: Anthony Hsu I think
        Rowe W. Hessler finished 2nd Tim Reynolds The 4x4 event was cancelled
        for time reasons. Yesterday's event was really great. Congrats to
        Anthony and Tim for placing in just about every event (Tim strengthed
        his national record on the magic by .01 seconds) and congrats to
        Mitchell for winning the first tournament he ever entered! I judged his
        first solve in the first round. I wasn't really paying attention so I
        was floored when he stopped the timer at about 14.3! I think Anthony was
        in first place after each of the first two rounds (he got an 11.2 single
        solve at some point) but Mitchell was the best in the finals. I did way
        better than I was expecting to at the 3x3. I considered myself retired
        after my last competition which was one year ago. I haven't cubed much
        since then and I haven't seriously practiced since right before Orlando
        in November 2005. Back when I was cubing regularly, I probably averaged
        mid 19s so I was surprised that my averages in the first two rounds of
        yesterday's tournament were 19.2 and 19.5. I was even more surprised to
        have five 16s in the finals! In a typical average of 12 at home, I'd
        probably get one 16s solve. I couldn't believe I hit five in a row at
        Rutgers. Major props to James Ouyang who judged 4 of my 5 solves in the
        finals¬Öhe's my new favorite judge! I was also really happy to have my
        first successful BLD solve in a competition. I got 7:19 on my first
        attempt and I was so relieved to see a solved cube when I took off the
        blindfold. I missed my second attempt but managed a 5:10 on my third
        attempt which is really fast for me! Chris Parlette (fear the turtle)
        and I did some team BLD solves for fun and I think our best was about 55
        seconds. Tim Reynolds and I carpooled together so we cubed on the way
        home. Our best team BLD time with me calling was 46 seconds and our best
        with him calling was 45 seconds. This tourney was really well run and
        was a lot of fun. I met some old friends and made some new ones. Much
        thanks to Bob (and the whole Burton family) for running another great
        tournament (complete with free pizza and fancy certificates and cube
        trophies for the winners!). Ian Winokur

        OLL can be learned the same way. Another way that I've done before is
        find to two oll algs that set up each other, like (on dan harris's page)
        case 48 and case 32. Then you learn two at a time. --- In

        Nice job to everyone, especially Ian and Mitchell. And Anthony. And
        Doug. And Bob. Oh, heck, especially everyone. Doug won the 5x5 by about
        30 seconds (the 2nd and 3rd place averages were 3:03 and 3:04 or
        something). Anthony would have gotten sub-3 probably, but he popped on
        two solves. Nice job Ian on getting your BLD solve. I guess we won't be
        seeing you much more, but at least you got what you came for. For me, my
        biggest disappointment was a 1.13 magic DNF. It was a very close call,
        and I'd have had a 1.20 average if it weren't a DNF. I was surprised by
        my consistency throughout the day (my 3x3 averages were 18.24, 18.26,
        18.30), but more surprised by Ian's improvement in the finals. Great
        job. And, Ian, I won't betray your trust anymore. I'm not going to post
        your (and James') secret here :) There was a mystery event as well.
        Peter, Doug, and Dan Beyer each had a scrambled cube with all three
        parities. Peter won easily with a 38 I think, with Doug in second. I'm
        not quite sure what happened with Dan; I think he gave up after 50
        seconds. Thanks so much, Bob, your last Rutgers tourney was a great one.

        Nice job to everyone! And thanks to Bob for another great competition.
        Your replacements have a tough act to follow... :) That mystery event
        was great. Dan popped at around 15-20 seconds, put it back together and
        popped again later and ended up just giving up. :P Also, if anyone
        walked away with my megaminx, it would be great if I could get it back.
        Thanks :) It has cubesmith stickers, 12 colors. Thanks again Bob and

        it weren't a &gt; DNF. I was surprised by my consistency throughout the
        day (my 3x3 &gt; averages were 18.24, 18.26, 18.30), but more surprised
        by Ian's &gt; improvement in the finals. Great job. &gt; &gt; And, Ian,
        I won't betray your trust anymore. I'm not going to post &gt; your (and

        Peter, Doug, and Dan Beyer each &gt; had a scrambled cube with all three

        &gt; &gt; he stopped the timer at about 14.3! I think Anthony was in
        first &gt; &gt; place after each of the first two rounds (he got an 11.2
        single &gt; solve &gt; &gt; at some point) but Mitchell was the best in

        then and I haven't seriously practiced &gt; since &gt; &gt; right before
        Orlando in November 2005. Back when I was cubing &gt; &gt; regularly, I
        probably averaged mid 19s so I was surprised that my &gt; &gt; averages
        in the first two rounds of yesterday's tournament were 19.2 &gt; &gt;
        and 19.5. I was even more surprised to have five 16s in the &gt; finals!
        &gt; &gt; In a typical average of 12 at home, I'd probably get one 16s
        &gt; solve. I &gt; &gt; couldn't believe I hit five in a row at Rutgers.

        &gt; I was also really happy to have my first successful BLD solve in a
        &gt; &gt; competition. I got 7:19 on my first attempt and I was so
        relieved &gt; to &gt; &gt; see a solved cube when I took off the
        blindfold. I missed my second &gt; &gt; attempt but managed a 5:10 on my
        third attempt which is really fast &gt; &gt; for me! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Chris Parlette (fear the turtle) and I did some team BLD solves for &gt;
        &gt; fun and I think our best was about 55 seconds. Tim Reynolds and I
        &gt; &gt; carpooled together so we cubed on the way home. Our best team
        BLD &gt; &gt; time with me calling was 46 seconds and our best with him
        calling &gt; was &gt; &gt; 45 seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This tourney
        was really well run and was a lot of fun. I met some &gt; old &gt; &gt;
        friends and made some new ones. Much thanks to Bob (and the whole &gt;

        Hi everyone, Needless to say, I'm very glad with the turnout of my first
        competition :). Congratulations to everyone! In case anyone was
        wondering, the scrambles for the Final 3x3 Speedsolve Round were
        extremely easy! I think 3 or 4 of the solves had 4 or less move crosses,
        easy F2Ls, and my LL cases were pretty easy too! I'm also happy with my
        4:3x BLD solve. One of my best, and at a competition too. Anyways, I had
        a great time meeting everyone. I had a lot of fun! -Mitchell P.S. Does

        My little(?) Rutgers report: Overall, I was pretty happy with my
        performance. I had personal best competition times in both 3x3x3 and
        5x5x5. Unfortunately, unlike Ian, I did not did not yet get my first
        official BLD solve. In any case, somehow I seem to have come home with a
        trophy in my possession. (Is anyone missing a trophy? :-) ) I think this
        was the first competition where I attempted Fridrich-style solving (with
        3LLL). My first two attempts were Fridrich-style, but I made mistakes
        and got times on the order of 85 seconds each, assuring me of a poor
        average relative to what I would have liked to have gotten. My best time
        (41.56 I think) I got using my version of the Varasano corners first
        method. During pre-inspection I failed to come up with a plan for a
        cross or a Guimond case, so I decided to go with a Varasano-style solve.
        So I got my personal best official time with essentially nothing planned
        out during preinspection. I did another corners first solve with a
        Guimond-style start (I think). Then on my last attempt, I went with a
        Fridrich-style (surprising my judge) and this time got a fairly decent
        time (for me), 51.xx I think. In 5x5x5, I thought it would be nice to
        get a sub-7-minute solve, after having shattered my time from U.S.
        Nationals (9:58.28) at Cornell with two solves in the 7+ minute range.
        Well, I surprised myself with two sub-7 times, including a 6:18.xx in my
        first attempt. I've rarely had that good of time at home. (Still, it was
        only good enough for 2nd to last place.) In BLD, I have trouble getting
        my solves done within ten minutes, and as I expected, a 10-minute limit
        per solve was imposed. Also, a 20-minute limit was imposed for all 3
        solves. My first solve I managed to do fairly quickly (for me), around
        8.5 to 9 minutes, but at one point early on, when I came to undoing a
        setup move, I realized that I believed I had done a quarter-turn setup
        move that should have been a half-turn. I went on with the solve hoping
        that I had done the correct setup, but I ended up with all the cubies
        oriented for my orientation scheme, but several cubies out of place. My
        2nd BLD attempt I had trouble memorizing. Finally I put the blindfold
        on, then (before having made any moves) took it off again to refresh my
        corners memorization. I think it was now over eight minutes when I
        finally started the solve phase. As I was solving, I kept expecting to
        have the judge tell me my time was up, but that didn't happen. When I
        got to my last step, which is permuting edges, I was sure I couldn't get
        it done within the 10-minute limit, so I simply stopped the timer to see
        if I had at least gotten this far without an execution mistake (I
        hadn't). When I looked at the time, I was not only surprised to see that
        the time hadn't run out, but that the time was ...(drum roll)...
        9:58.27. Compare that with my U.S. Nationals 5x5x5 time! Of course, this
        one will just appear as DNF on the competition results. (Speaking of my
        U.S. Nationals 5x5x5 result, at Cornell I mentioned to Leyan that I had
        finally beaten my 5x5x5 time from U.S. Nationals, and he asked me in
        which direction I had beaten it.) Going into the competition, I was
        almost certain I could get a new personal best competition time in
        4x4x4. Unfortunately that event was cancelled. Well, any way, thanks to
        Bob for hosting this and the other past Rutgers competitions, and to
        everyone who helped out with those competitions. - Bruce

        restarted in the Cube world (Because I always loved it but was far away
        from cubes for more than 10 years). I can do the cube using the basic
        method with around 2 minutes and starting study VH System trying to do
        something better. Anyway, I toke a look in that website
        http://www.cube4you.com and the good thing is that they ship to Brazil,
        one of my problems since here we don't have any good brand to sell. My
        question is about their brands... how about Eastsheen? Are their cubes
        good? Are they compared to Rubik's or better than? And about the
        website. Can I buy there confident? Thanks for your helping Cheers

        For everything other than 3x3 (2x2, 4x4, 5x5), I recommend Eastsheen.

        well frank taught me this: when starting, find a particular set of edges

        have built up your ability to quickly find pieces, you can start doing
        whatever is easiest. also check out the methods for pairing on our site

        Rubik's sponsored, I &gt; don't remember any talk about banning
        non-rubiks cubes. In the 2x2 &gt; event I and many others use eashsheen
        and I, and my brother use &gt; eashsheen 5x5. It didn't seem to be an
        issue then. Maybe it is because the World Championships is a more
        high-profile event, but I'm not sure. Maybe everyone remembers the
        controversy for WC2003. If not, enjoy. It is recommended reading :-)
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/5431
        The most interesting requirements of the sponsors, in my opinion, were
        the following: - The cube must present the Rubik's logo on the white
        centre sticker. - The cube must use the
        red/orange/yellow/white/blue/green stickers. - The cube must use black
        plastic. As you may know, the patent on the Rubik's Cube puzzle has now
        expired, which means that it is now possible for other companies to
        legally make cubes with the same function. This is good for cubing as a
        sport, because any serious sport needs to allow several competing
        manufactures to produce the gear, and this competition will drive them
        to produce better quality cubes. However, Seven Towns are still actively
        trying to stamp out their competition using whatever other legal means
        they have at their disposal. To this end, Seven Towns registered a
        trademark for the "image" of the Rubik's Cube. You might see some
        inspiration in it for the requirements above! | The mark consists of a
        black cube having nine color patches on each | of its six faces with the
        color patches on each face being the same | and consisting of the colors
        red, white, blue, green, yellow and | orange. The drawing is lined for
        the colors red and green. The | remaining colors -- white, blue, yellow,
        and orange -- do not | appear in the drawing, but are claimed as a
        feature of the mark. This was U.S. Trademark registration number
        75,105,330 which can be found at http://www.uspto.gov/ It is just my
        speculation, but maybe they wanted us to become used to these particular
        colours because these are the colours where they actually have control
        over the market. Anyway, why did the WCA allow Seven Towns to do
        something similar again in 2007? I can understand why Seven Towns did
        it: because WCA gave them the power to, and so why not seize the
        opportunity. I wish the WCA were strongly against it, but in fact they
        (Ron) are actually of two minds. Ron has stated that he does "not like
        this situation", and that maybe the future will be a bit brighter. But
        at the same time Ron also said the following: &gt; Still I personally
        think that in a cola drinking competition sponsored &gt; by Coca Cola,
        it is reasonable that competitors can only drink Coca &gt; Cola, no
        Pepsi or Dr Pepper. This does not inspire a lot of confidence.
        Personally, I don't think that if Slazenger sponsored a major tennis
        tournament, that they would be allowed to force all competitors to use
        Slazenger brand racquets! Do we want to associate our sport with a
        serious sport like Tennis, or a joke sport like cola drinking? (Sorry if
        I offended anyone who takes cola drinking seriously ;-) I am not
        certain, but I also think that Seven Towns may be becoming more relaxed
        about the issue. The patent has expired, and there are ways of making
        legal alternatives that have the same function as Rubik's Cube. Maybe
        there will be a bright future, with healthy competition in the
        marketplace. In my opinion, WC2007 should not be thought of as the world
        championships for cubing, but rather just a special event to honour the
        Rubik's brand. A serious world championships in any serious sport should
        not be closed to only the brands made by the sponsor, and so it is
        unfortunate that this event happens to be given the title "world
        championships" when the nature of the event is more focused around
        Rubik's brand-only competition. -- Ryan Heise

        Hello, I still remember Tyson Mao at the 2x2 event in 2005. He said that
        the competition was not really a speedcubing competition, but more like
        a "Rubik's party". And that's exactly what it is. The way I see it: The
        sponsors are mainly interested in doing bussiness and getting media
        attention. They don't give a F*** about the interest or pleasure of the
        competitors, who travel long distances to make the whole competition
        possible in the first place, who want to do everything possible to set
        good times. The sponsor doesn't care about whether we have to compete in
        the burning sun, or if it's freezing cold. I know, in Florida the
        circumstances were the same for everybody, and it was a fair
        competition, I am just saying that the sponsor doesn't care much about
        making the circumstances optimal for cubing. They care about making the
        circumstances optimal for having a nice "media event". Anyways, that's
        just how I see it. Oh, one question: do I have to use sticker produced
        by Rubik's at the worlds? How about cubesmith? - Jo√´l. --- In

        my opinion, WC2007 should not be thought of as the world &gt;
        championships for cubing, but rather just a special event to honour the
        &gt; Rubik's brand. A serious world championships in any serious sport
        should &gt; not be closed to only the brands made by the sponsor, and so
        it is &gt; unfortunate that this event happens to be given the title
        "world &gt; championships" when the nature of the event is more focused
        around &gt; Rubik's brand-only competition. &gt; &gt; -- &gt; Ryan Heise

        as a world championship for "cubing", since this competition is closed
        to only Rubik's-only brands, whereas cubing is a more general sport. I
        think Seven Towns is in a difficult position deciding what to do here,

        sport to grow very large, which in the end will help everyone. -- Ryan

        Totally agreed...the sponsors are just looking for their $$$ but...if
        the world champion used a non-rubik's brand cube, what would it matter?
        would the media know about it? how much difference could it make? I
        would really really really really really really hate if I traveled some
        thousand miles to compete and wasn't allowed because of my cubesmith
        stickers...just because they don't sell good stickers we can't buy

        about the interest or pleasure of the competitors, who travel long
        distances to make the whole competition possible in the first place, who
        want to do everything possible to set good times. The sponsor doesn't
        care about whether we have to compete in the burning sun, or if it's
        freezing cold. I know, in Florida the circumstances were the same for
        everybody, and it was a fair competition, I am just saying that the
        sponsor doesn't care much about making the circumstances optimal for
        cubing. They care about making the circumstances optimal for having a
        nice "media event". Anyways, that's just how I see it. Oh, one question:

        &gt; Hmm. I'm a little confused. At EC2006, which was Rubik's sponsored,
        I &gt; &gt; don't remember any talk about banning non-rubiks cubes. In
        the 2x2 &gt; &gt; event I and many others use eashsheen and I, and my
        brother use &gt; &gt; eashsheen 5x5. It didn't seem to be an issue then.
        &gt; &gt; Maybe it is because the World Championships is a more
        high-profile &gt; event, but I'm not sure. &gt; &gt; Maybe everyone
        remembers the controversy for WC2003. If not, enjoy. It &gt; is
        recommended reading :-) &gt; &gt;
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/54 31
        &gt; &gt; The most interesting requirements of the sponsors, in my
        opinion, were &gt; the following: &gt; &gt; - The cube must present the
        Rubik's logo on the white centre sticker. &gt; - The cube must use the
        red/orange/yellow/white/blue/green stickers. &gt; - The cube must use
        black plastic. &gt; &gt; As you may know, the patent on the Rubik's Cube
        puzzle has now expired, &gt; which means that it is now possible for
        other companies to legally make &gt; cubes with the same function. This
        is good for cubing as a sport, &gt; because any serious sport needs to
        allow several competing manufactures &gt; to produce the gear, and this
        competition will drive them to produce &gt; better quality cubes. &gt;
        &gt; However, Seven Towns are still actively trying to stamp out their
        &gt; competition using whatever other legal means they have at their
        &gt; disposal. To this end, Seven Towns registered a trademark for the
        &gt; "image" of the Rubik's Cube. You might see some inspiration in it
        for &gt; the requirements above! &gt; &gt; | The mark consists of a
        black cube having nine color patches on each &gt; | of its six faces
        with the color patches on each face being the same &gt; | and consisting
        of the colors red, white, blue, green, yellow and &gt; | orange. The
        drawing is lined for the colors red and green. The &gt; | remaining
        colors -- white, blue, yellow, and orange -- do not &gt; | appear in the
        drawing, but are claimed as a feature of the mark. &gt; &gt; This was
        U.S. Trademark registration number 75,105,330 which can be &gt; found at
        http://www.uspto.gov/ &gt; &gt; It is just my speculation, but maybe
        they wanted us to become used to &gt; these particular colours because
        these are the colours where they &gt; actually have control over the
        market. &gt; &gt; Anyway, why did the WCA allow Seven Towns to do
        something similar again &gt; in 2007? I can understand why Seven Towns
        did it: because WCA gave them &gt; the power to, and so why not seize
        the opportunity. &gt; &gt; I wish the WCA were strongly against it, but
        in fact they (Ron) are &gt; actually of two minds. Ron has stated that
        he does "not like this &gt; situation", and that maybe the future will
        be a bit brighter. &gt; &gt; But at the same time Ron also said the
        following: &gt; &gt; &gt; Still I personally think that in a cola
        drinking competition sponsored &gt; &gt; by Coca Cola, it is reasonable
        that competitors can only drink Coca &gt; &gt; Cola, no Pepsi or Dr
        Pepper. &gt; &gt; This does not inspire a lot of confidence. Personally,
        I don't think &gt; that if Slazenger sponsored a major tennis
        tournament, that they would &gt; be allowed to force all competitors to
        use Slazenger brand racquets! Do &gt; we want to associate our sport
        with a serious sport like Tennis, or a &gt; joke sport like cola
        drinking? (Sorry if I offended anyone who takes &gt; cola drinking
        seriously ;-) &gt; &gt; I am not certain, but I also think that Seven
        Towns may be becoming more &gt; relaxed about the issue. The patent has
        expired, and there are ways of &gt; making legal alternatives that have
        the same function as Rubik's Cube. &gt; Maybe there will be a bright
        future, with healthy competition in the &gt; marketplace. &gt; &gt; In
        my opinion, WC2007 should not be thought of as the world &gt;

        I've thought a lot about this issue. That does not seperate me from the
        majority however. The problem (as I see it) is that not enough people
        vocalize their thoughts on this (and similar) issue(s). In 2003 the
        restrictions were acceptable because they were something we had to
        swallow. And why not? We owe a lot of thanks to SevenTowns. I'm not
        defending the recent pressure to restrict competitions. The strangest
        thing to me is that we have to have this discussion at all. As I said
        above, we owe a lot of thanks to 7towns, but we no longer need their
        support in the same way as before. I owe a lot of thanks to my parents
        for raising me and providing me an acceptable start in life. Just
        because they did well and I am grateful would not justify their bullying
        me into making decisions of their choosing. To clarify on the analogy:
        SevenTowns was a wonderful incubator for the community, but we have
        simply outgrown their influence. Ryan made some viable points as well
        regarding this whole situation. Read them again if you are unsure. I
        also have to express my discontent with WCA authority ignoring important
        questions. I understand there is a WCA forum, but this is where the bulk
        of the community finds their information. Ten people telling 1000 people
        where to find information makes less sense than 1000 people telling
        those ten where to provide it. "I'm busy" isn't an acceptable excuse
        anymore for WCA officials. Either stop doing the job (i hope you don't)
        or find more people and delegate responsibility. It's not terribly
        difficult and I don't see the weakness in expanding the board some. I
        would like to see a WCA board member's expanded answer on why we are
        still selling out to 7towns every two years? Or do we need the biannual
        reminder that we aren't a strong enough organization. And regarding the
        above, I would like to see each board members opinion on the situation.
        Is our board absent? With all due contempt, Richard

        Another method is the Petrus method: http://lar5.com/cube Personally, I
        use a combination of the Petrus and Fridrich methods: a Petrus first two
        layers (F2L) and a Fridrich last layer (LL). I do steps 1 - 4a of the
        Petrus method intuitively, so no move sequences need to be memorized.
        For step 4b (the last step of the F2L), take a look at this page:
        http://lar5.com/cube/s4b.html Once you understand how the pieces are
        being moved around, this step can be done fairly intuitively as well. I
        would only memorize the more difficult cases, which are in the last two
        rows. I know all the cases, but I only consider myself as having
        memorized 8 move sequences because the others are intuitive to me. Since
        you orient the edges in step 3 (which can be done intuitively once you
        understand how the edges are being flipped (see the Advanced section at
        http://lar5.com/cube/fas3.html)), when you reach the LL, all edges will
        be oriented. Thus, Fridrich OLL + PLL only requires memorization of 28
        move sequences. Thus, in total, you only need to memorize around 36 move
        sequences (or a few more if your first two layers is less intuitive).
        Using this method, I have averaged under 15 seconds. To be fast with
        this method, you need to focus on fewer moves in your intuitive
        solutions for steps 1 - 4a. Hop on over to the petrusmethod Yahoo! Group
        (http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/petrusmethod/) for more information
        and help with this method. Recently, there's been discussion and
        analysis about the maximum number of turns required for each step.

        &gt; &gt; That's odd. I just got 3914 (incl solved case, 3913 without).
        &gt; &gt; The calculation uses Burnside's Lemma: &gt;
        http://www.geocities.com/jaapsch/puzzles/theory.htm &gt; &gt; There are
        indeed 62208 = 4!*4!/2 *3^3 *2^3 positions. Rotating U &gt; doesn't
        quite divide it by 4 since there are some positions that are &gt; not
        changed by a U2 rotation, and even a few unchanged by a U or U'. &gt;
        Burnside accounts for this. &gt; There are 16 = 4*4/2 *1*2 positions
        unchanged by U or U'. &gt; There are 384 = 8*8/2 *3*4 positions
        unchanged by U2. &gt; So burnside gives the answer (62208 + 16+16+384)/4
        = 15656 positions &gt; if you don't care about U rotations. This does
        however assume a fixed &gt; colour on the front of the cube. Divide by 4
        to account for the &gt; choice of front colour (note that none of the
        15656 will be the same &gt; after a cube rotation because they are not
        the same after a U layer &gt; turn). &gt; This gives 15656/4 = 3914
        positions. Your calculations are correct up to the answer 15656, however
        dividing by 4 is not correct - you need to consider the 4 choices of the
        front colour within the framework of Burnside's Lemma to get the correct
        answer. Above, for each U-turn t you checked that a permutation p is
        fixed if p = t p t' Instead, for each U-turn t1 and U-turn t2, you
        should check that a permutation p is fixed if p = t1 p t1' t2 where a
        U-turn is one of { U0, U1, U2, U3 }. This makes 4 times as many
        symmetries, and if all of the additional symmetries have zero fixed
        points, then this will be the same as dividing by 4. Since we know that
        dividing by 4 gives an incorrect answer, we should expect some
        additional fixed points. Jaap, maybe you know if there a smart way to
        calculate the number of fixed points for symmetries of the second form
        (i.e. t1 p t1' t2) ? -- Ryan Heise http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/

        I recently gave a seminar for a job I have applied for. The topic for
        the lecture was Group theory and the Rubik's cube, specifically
        different ways to attack the problem of determining the diameter of the
        cube group. At any rate, it wasn't too in depth, but I did make up a few
        projector slides and I have posted them in a zip file in the files

        If you can already solve a 3x3x3 cube with some sort of layer-by- layer
        or cross+F2L approach, you should actually be able to get most of the
        megaminx with what you already know - give it a try before diving right
        into someone else's solution. You will just need to make some minor
        tweaks becuase of the change in puzzle structure. Regardless, I don't
        know about a beginner solution, but assuming you can already solve a

        some additional insights that are a good read, and also has some tips on

        I think it's incredibly stupid to not allow any other brand then Rubik.
        Also i heard every rubik cube has to have a sticker with the logo. I

        Just got the game as well. The standard color scheme of the cubes is
        white opposite blue, but this can be customized (colors of all faces are
        fully customizable. The controls are the same as most 3D applets.
        Dragging outside the cube rotates it, and dragging on edges/corner
        pieces rotates that face. Depending on the angle the cube is in, this
        works OK, but if you have the cube in the situation where all three
        visible faces are equally visible, the behaviour seems pretty random.
        The buttons on the NDS can be used to to 'peek around'. The direction
        keys for example will rotate the cube to 90 degrees in a certain
        direction while you hold one of them. When you release, it will jump
        back to the position you were first in. Also there's a quick undo
        button. However there seems to be no way to manipulate the cube (turning
        any faces) using the buttons. Also there's a tutorial mode which teaches
        to solve the cube. The system it teaches seems to be as follows: - Get
        edge pieces of the cross on the top layer (with the right orientation) -
        Permutate edge pieces - Place corner pieces of first layer - Place
        second layer pieces - Orient LL edges - Orient LL corners - Permutate LL
        corners - Permutate LL edges Aside from the cube solving there's also a
        mode where you have to match certain patterns that are showed on the top
        screen. I haven't really used/played the game yet, but these seem to be
        the basic contents. There's also a multiplayer mode.. Haven't tried
        connecting to the internet, but you can race CPU opponents too. I'll
        start around with it a little now, if you guys have any question just
        shoot. Grts Koen --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Eastsheen 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 are smaller then the Rubik ones. However, the
        2x2x2 is bigger then the rubik one. Everyone who does well is 2x2x2 uses
        an eastsheen, at least in europe. For the 4x4x4 both are possible for

        Hi Richard, &gt; I also have to express my discontent with WCA &gt;
        authority ignoring important questions. I honestly think all questions
        are answered. (at least those asked in a respectful way) The only issue
        that remains is that we did not succeed yet in making sure that for WC
        2007 all puzzle brands are allowed. I already told that we are working
        on this, and that we kind of got the answer that WC 2007 will be the
        last competition with this issue. We continue to strive that also WC
        2007 will be brand neutral. It is clear that every cuber here would want
        to use any of the brands. It is (or should be) a free world. That is
        also why WCA is brand neutral. &gt; SevenTowns was a wonderful incubator
        for the community, but we have simply &gt; outgrown their &gt;
        influence. I do not agree on this. Seventowns are organizing (and have
        organized) some great competitions. Competitions we would not have had
        without their support. Did you know that in 2007 Seventowns are involved
        in organizing the following competitions: - Roissy 2007 (with Winning
        Moves France) - France 2007 (with Winning Moves France) - Spanish Open
        2007 - Italian Open 2007 - World Championship 2007 - US Open 2007 I am
        not mentioning the many competitions where they do smaller things (like
        helping with the equipment et cetera). What happens is that they are the
        main organizers of the big competitions. For the smaller competitions
        they help us find the sponsors (often local distributors) and help
        organize the first edition of the competition. From then on they hope
        that things will become successful in the next couple of years and that
        the local organization teams can run the show with only little support.
        Anyway, although they are helping us extremely well, this does not mean
        that we should not have are own requirements, like allowing all brands.
        To answer your new question: &gt; I would like to see a WCA board
        member's expanded &gt; answer on why we are still selling out to 7towns
        every &gt; two years? Without Seventowns there would be no big
        competition on 5/6/7 October 2007, with big prizes, in a wonderful
        venue, with many competitors from all over the world. WCA calls it the
        World Rubik's Cube Championship 2007. I think this is going to be the
        best competition ever. Best in many ways. There is an issue though, the
        organizers had the requirement that only Rubik's brand puzzles are
        allowed. WCA do not like it. WCA asked to allow all puzzle brands. The
        answer up until last Thursday was still NO. WCA is still working on it.
        Any more questions? &gt; And regarding the above, I would like to see
        each &gt; board members opinion on the situation. &gt; Is our board
        absent? I will ask the other board members to answer too. &gt; With all
        due contempt, I am not a native English speaker. Please explain what you
        mean. Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message ----- From: "Richard

        at WC2007 &gt; I've thought a lot about this issue. That does not &gt;
        seperate me from the majority however. The problem &gt; (as I see it) is
        that not enough people vocalize their &gt; thoughts on this (and
        similar) issue(s). &gt; &gt; In 2003 the restrictions were acceptable
        because they &gt; were something we had to swallow. And why not? We &gt;
        owe a lot of thanks to SevenTowns. I'm not defending &gt; the recent
        pressure to restrict competitions. &gt; &gt; The strangest thing to me
        is that we have to have this &gt; discussion at all. As I said above, we
        owe a lot of &gt; thanks to 7towns, but we no longer need their support
        &gt; in the same way as before. I owe a lot of thanks to &gt; my parents
        for raising me and providing me an &gt; acceptable start in life. Just
        because they did well &gt; and I am grateful would not justify their
        bullying me &gt; into making decisions of their choosing. To clarify
        &gt; on the analogy: SevenTowns was a wonderful incubator &gt; for the
        community, but we have simply outgrown their &gt; influence. &gt; &gt;
        Ryan made some viable points as well regarding this &gt; whole
        situation. Read them again if you are unsure. &gt; &gt; I also have to
        express my discontent with WCA &gt; authority ignoring important
        questions. &gt; &gt; I understand there is a WCA forum, but this is
        where &gt; the bulk of the community finds their information. &gt; Ten
        people telling 1000 people where to find &gt; information makes less
        sense than 1000 people telling &gt; those ten where to provide it. &gt;
        &gt; "I'm busy" isn't an acceptable excuse anymore for WCA &gt;
        officials. Either stop doing the job (i hope you &gt; don't) or find
        more people and delegate &gt; responsibility. It's not terribly
        difficult and I &gt; don't see the weakness in expanding the board some.
        &gt; &gt; I would like to see a WCA board member's expanded &gt; answer
        on why we are still selling out to 7towns every &gt; two years? Or do we
        need the biannual reminder that &gt; we aren't a strong enough
        organization. &gt; &gt; And regarding the above, I would like to see
        each &gt; board members opinion on the situation. &gt; &gt; Is our board
        absent? &gt; &gt; With all due contempt, &gt; &gt; Richard &gt; &gt;

        Hi Ryan, The view of WCA is that all brands of puzzles should be allowed
        in WCA competitions. Unless the puzzles violate the WCA regulations of
        course. &gt;Can you please reply to the question at the head of this
        thread I have no idea which question you mean, so I will just answer all
        questions that you asked again. &gt;Does the WCA* today still allow a
        sponsor to force additional &gt;restrictions on the allowable puzzles? I
        don't like the choice of words (allow/force), but technically the answer
        is: yes for WC 2007, and no for any other competition and any other
        organisation team than the organisation team of WC 2007. Additionally: -
        WCA will not enforce the restrictions though, the organisation team may
        do that - WCA is talking and has been talking with organisation team to
        allow all puzzle brands - the current state is that because WC 2007 is a
        special competition (25th anniversary, in home country of the cube, with
        the inventor involved), there is a special wish to only use Rubik's
        brands - WCA already has an informal reaction from organisation team
        that this is the last competition where the allowed brands are limited I
        still think the answer is obvious. It was already mentioned in the
        message by Pedro that you actually reacted to! You could also just have
        gone to the WC 2007 site and find the answer within one minute.
        &gt;Would, for example, the WCA allow Seven Towns as a sponsor to
        require &gt;competitors to use their brand over East Sheen? Same answer.
        &gt; What if Seven Towns claimed East Sheen as an illegal copy? &gt;
        Would the WCA agree to ban it from a sponsored competition, or not? &gt;
        Or will the WCA make up its own mind about what &gt; puzzles are allowed
        and firmly stick to it? WCA does not have an active role in finding
        illegal puzzles (illegal copies, trademark violation et cetera). Still
        if some person or organisation points out with proof that a specific
        puzzle is illegal, then WCA will not allow that specific puzzle type in
        WCA competitions anymore. (In that case we have to change the WCA
        regulations.) More questions? &gt; It is not only we who should ask
        questions in a respectful way, but also &gt; the WCA who should answer
        them in a respectful way. I did not find it &gt; very professional for
        the WCA to reply to my question with "the answer &gt; is obvious" and
        then to not give me the answer, when I had made it clear &gt; from the

        document, and that even if the answer to my question were in it, I was
        &gt; simply unable to find it at the time. In that case you could just
        have said that instead of offending me. To me it was like shooting the
        messenger instead of helping us create a free world. You are smart
        enough to understand that I am on the cubers side. Have fun, Ron -----

        I get from this that we need seven towns for the tournament else it
        would be not so big. Also I get from this that WCA is trying to do the
        cubers whishers and talk about the brand issue to seven towns, I realy
        appreciate this :) --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Ron
        van Bruchem" &lt;ron@...&gt; wrote: &gt; &gt; Hi Ryan, &gt; &gt; The
        view of WCA is that all brands of puzzles should be allowed in WCA &gt;
        competitions. Unless the puzzles violate the WCA regulations of course.
        &gt; &gt; &gt;Can you please reply to the question at the head of this
        thread &gt; I have no idea which question you mean, so I will just
        answer all questions &gt; that you asked again. &gt; &gt; &gt;Does the
        WCA* today still allow a sponsor to force additional &gt;
        &gt;restrictions on the allowable puzzles? &gt; I don't like the choice
        of words (allow/force), but technically the answer &gt; is: yes for WC
        2007, and no for any other competition and any other &gt; organisation
        team than the organisation team of WC 2007. &gt; Additionally: &gt; -
        WCA will not enforce the restrictions though, the organisation team may
        do &gt; that &gt; - WCA is talking and has been talking with
        organisation team to allow all &gt; puzzle brands &gt; - the current
        state is that because WC 2007 is a special competition (25th &gt;
        anniversary, in home country of the cube, with the inventor involved),
        there &gt; is a special wish to only use Rubik's brands &gt; - WCA
        already has an informal reaction from organisation team that this is
        &gt; the last competition where the allowed brands are limited &gt; &gt;
        I still think the answer is obvious. It was already mentioned in the
        message &gt; by Pedro that you actually reacted to! &gt; You could also
        just have gone to the WC 2007 site and find the answer within &gt; one
        minute. &gt; &gt; &gt;Would, for example, the WCA allow Seven Towns as a
        sponsor to require &gt; &gt;competitors to use their brand over East
        Sheen? &gt; Same answer. &gt; &gt; &gt; What if Seven Towns claimed East
        Sheen as an illegal copy? &gt; &gt; Would the WCA agree to ban it from a
        sponsored competition, or not? &gt; &gt; Or will the WCA make up its own
        mind about what &gt; &gt; puzzles are allowed and firmly stick to it?
        &gt; WCA does not have an active role in finding illegal puzzles
        (illegal copies, &gt; trademark violation et cetera). Still if some
        person or organisation points &gt; out with proof that a specific puzzle
        is illegal, then WCA will not allow &gt; that specific puzzle type in
        WCA competitions anymore. (In that case we have &gt; to change the WCA
        regulations.) &gt; &gt; More questions? &gt; &gt; &gt; It is not only we
        who should ask questions in a respectful way, but also &gt; &gt; the WCA
        who should answer them in a respectful way. I did not find it &gt; &gt;
        very professional for the WCA to reply to my question with "the answer
        &gt; &gt; is obvious" and then to not give me the answer, when I had
        made it clear &gt; &gt; from the outset that I did not find the WCA
        regulations to be a clear &gt; &gt; document, and that even if the
        answer to my question were in it, I was &gt; &gt; simply unable to find
        it at the time. &gt; In that case you could just have said that instead
        of offending me. To me it &gt; was like shooting the messenger instead
        of helping us create a free world. &gt; You are smart enough to
        understand that I am on the cubers side. &gt; &gt; Have fun, &gt; &gt;

        some kind of licensing agreement &gt; &gt; with Seven Towns and
        therefore will be allowed by Seven Towns. Maybe &gt; &gt; Studio Cubes
        are manufactured by a separate company, under license, for &gt; &gt;
        example, and therefore might be allowed. The answer is not obvious to

        It is my belief that the "clone" DIY kits that are currently available
        would be accepted, since they are impossible to distinguish from a
        genuine Rubik's brand puzzle (of which there have been several makes

        After having personnal contact with Ron, I can Assure the WCA is doing
        everything in their power to help the cubers. However, having a
        competition this size requiers sponsors and also sponsors have demands.
        I still hope it will be a brand neutral competition, but even if not,
        you will see me there. I can always compete in the events of which I
        have a Rubik brand. ----- Message d'origine ---- De : Tobias Daneels

        cubing group] Re: Allowed / Blocked cubes at WC2007 I think it's
        incredibly stupid to not allow any other brand then Rubik. Also i heard
        every rubik cube has to have a sticker with the logo. I allready
        restickered my 3x3x3 anniversary "RUBIK" cube. I can't compete with this
        one?? If this all stays that way I have to reconsider my participation.

        Richard, It's not that simple. You can't go through life burning bridges
        just because you want something. You need to understand this right away,
        or it will impact your life beyond the scope of cubing. I will talk to
        SevenTowns. I do not believe that allowing different types of cubes
        hurts their publicity or their merchandising whatsoever. People see a
        cube, they don't think, "That's a Magic Square Puzzle!" They think,
        "That's a Rubik's Cube." And they will buy a Rubik's Cube, and not an
        imitation. -Tyson On 4/27/07, Richard Patterson

        issue. That does not &gt; seperate me from the majority however. The
        problem &gt; (as I see it) is that not enough people vocalize their &gt;
        thoughts on this (and similar) issue(s). &gt; &gt; In 2003 the
        restrictions were acceptable because they &gt; were something we had to
        swallow. And why not? We &gt; owe a lot of thanks to SevenTowns. I'm not
        defending &gt; the recent pressure to restrict competitions. &gt; &gt;
        The strangest thing to me is that we have to have this &gt; discussion
        at all. As I said above, we owe a lot of &gt; thanks to 7towns, but we
        no longer need their support &gt; in the same way as before. I owe a lot
        of thanks to &gt; my parents for raising me and providing me an &gt;
        acceptable start in life. Just because they did well &gt; and I am
        grateful would not justify their bullying me &gt; into making decisions
        of their choosing. To clarify &gt; on the analogy: SevenTowns was a
        wonderful incubator &gt; for the community, but we have simply outgrown
        their &gt; influence. &gt; &gt; Ryan made some viable points as well
        regarding this &gt; whole situation. Read them again if you are unsure.
        &gt; &gt; I also have to express my discontent with WCA &gt; authority
        ignoring important questions. &gt; &gt; I understand there is a WCA
        forum, but this is where &gt; the bulk of the community finds their
        information. &gt; Ten people telling 1000 people where to find &gt;
        information makes less sense than 1000 people telling &gt; those ten
        where to provide it. &gt; &gt; "I'm busy" isn't an acceptable excuse
        anymore for WCA &gt; officials. Either stop doing the job (i hope you
        &gt; don't) or find more people and delegate &gt; responsibility. It's
        not terribly difficult and I &gt; don't see the weakness in expanding
        the board some. &gt; &gt; I would like to see a WCA board member's
        expanded &gt; answer on why we are still selling out to 7towns every
        &gt; two years? Or do we need the biannual reminder that &gt; we aren't
        a strong enough organization. &gt; &gt; And regarding the above, I would
        like to see each &gt; board members opinion on the situation. &gt; &gt;
        Is our board absent? &gt; &gt; With all due contempt, &gt; &gt; Richard

        the head of this thread &gt; I have no idea which question you mean Ok,
        what is meant is the question at the head ("first message") of this
        thread ("Allowed / Blocked cubes at WC2007"). &gt; &gt;Does the WCA*
        today still allow a sponsor to force additional &gt; &gt;restrictions on
        the allowable puzzles? &gt; I don't like the choice of words
        (allow/force). I can't help this, because I always choose my words to
        say precisely what I mean. &gt; - the current state is that because WC
        2007 is a special competition (25th &gt; anniversary, in home country of
        the cube, with the inventor involved), there &gt; is a special wish to
        only use Rubik's brands Thank you! This appears to be the answer to my
        question:
        http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/speedsolvingrubikscube/message/34610
        This is the question I have been complaining has been left unanswered
        for several weeks, and so I am glad to have finally received an answer
        to it (but as with Richard's point, this is one example of a question
        that was initially ignored by the WCA) Now, it is clear to me that the
        question has been answered, but to anyone who scans the archives and
        finds my question in the message above, the problem for them is that
        they will not realise it has been answered, because you answered it in a
        different place to where it was asked (that was my earlier point). It is
        difficult when the WCA does not give answers directly to the questions
        where they were asked. &gt; - WCA already has an informal reaction from
        organisation team that this is &gt; the last competition where the
        allowed brands are limited This is also new information that I could not
        find in any earlier official WCA statement. Thank you, again. New
        information a'coming. &gt; I still think the answer is obvious. It was
        already mentioned in the message &gt; by Pedro that you actually reacted
        to! I disagree. I read Pedro's message carefully of course, and that is
        why I replied to it. He said that in the past, sponsors had forced
        additional restrictions on the allowed cubes. My question was whether
        the WCA still allowed sponsors to do this "today". I also stated that I
        read the WCA regulations, but found the WCA regulations to be unclear
        and that, while the answer might indeed be in it, it was simply not
        clear to me. Therefore, I asked to hear the WCA's clarification on this
        issue. &gt; You could also just have gone to the WC 2007 site and find
        the answer &gt; within one minute. I disagree. I went there and still
        did not find the answer to whether the WCA regulations allow this. The
        concern that I was trying to raise was that I had already found a number
        of ambiguities in the WCA regulations. On this particular issue, the
        document may have had the answer somewhere, but it was not clear to me.
        My question was not whether the WC2007 forces competitors to use
        Rubik-only brands, my question was whether this is legal under the WCA
        regulations. That is, I saw it as possible that in addition to the
        existing mistakes and inconsistencies in the regulations document that I
        had found so far, that there might also be another one concerning this
        issue. It is impossible to find the answer to a question about the
        regulations on a page about the WC2007. This question has now been
        answered and I am not asking for further clarification. I am just
        commenting on the way in which the WCA initially conducted themselves in
        making me feel like my question was stupid, when in fact my question(s)
        are usually motivated by non-trivial underlying issues. (Read my point
        at the bottom, as it is related) &gt; More questions? Thank you for
        finally answering the "What is the situation" question. The only
        question that remains is the one at the head of this thread. &gt; &gt;
        It is not only we who should ask questions in a respectful way, but also
        &gt; &gt; the WCA who should answer them in a respectful way. I did not
        find it &gt; &gt; very professional for the WCA to reply to my question
        with "the answer &gt; &gt; is obvious" and then to not give me the
        answer, when I had made it clear &gt; &gt; from the outset that I did
        not find the WCA regulations to be a clear &gt; &gt; document, and that
        even if the answer to my question were in it, I was &gt; &gt; simply
        unable to find it at the time. &gt; In that case you could just have
        said that I did. &gt; instead of offending me. If you are offended, it
        is not because I tried to offend you. I actually had what I thought was
        a valid question. ** Being in the position of representing the WCA, an
        organisation that makes decisions that affect a large number of people
        including not only competitors from this community but also
        manufacturers of competiting brands of cube in the free marketplace, I
        think that you, as a WCA official, need to accept that people will
        question the decisions of the WCA every now and then, especially when
        these decisions may affect competitors and/or manufacturers in a
        negative way. Of course, the very nature of these questions mean that
        they may naturally seem offensive to you, but as a professional, you
        should attempt to address these "valid" concerns nonetheless. I used
        words allow/force which I believe to be the perfect choice of words. I
        have tried to express the view that I believe it is wrong for the WCA to
        allow sponsors to force competitors to use their brand, especially in a
        "world championships". In my view, it would be difficult to express my
        question without being negative, because that is part of the nature of
        this particular question. And are you going to tell me that certain
        questions cannot be asked of the WCA because you find them offensive?
        &gt; To me it was like shooting the messenger instead of helping us
        create &gt; a free world. You are smart enough to understand that I am
        on the &gt; cubers side. This relates to the reference a few paragraphs
        up. I think you are also smart enough to know that I try to ask genuine
        questions, and usually the questions revolve around some underlying
        non-trivial issue which in my mind does not have an obvious answer. I am
        sorry if you feel offended, but that is the nature of the question. I
        wanted to know if the WCA allows what I consider to be a monopolistic
        act. It is not expected for the WCA to become emotional due to such a
        question, but rather to be level-headed and provide insightful and
        immediate answers to shed some light on the WCA's current thinking. One
        more question: As mentioned, I now have answers to all of my questions
        except for the one at the head of this thread. I am therefore aware (as
        per this latest email of yours) that WC2007 will probably be the last
        competition in which competitors will be "forced" to use Rubik brands.
        But I would like to know what sort of guarantees will be put into place
        to ensure that this sort of thing cannot happen again? For example, do
        we just have express intention to look out for this sort of thing, or
        will you actually put it into the regulations document so that this
        thing actually "can't" happen again? If you are not willing to put this
        into the regulations, then what about at least a rule which says that a
        competition cannot be called a "world championships" if the sponsors
        require competitors to use their brand of cube? -- Ryan Heise

        For a World Championship I think it would make sense to demand a pretty
        high starting fee from the competitors, to finance the event. Given that
        the average competitor has to pay around $500-$1000 just in travel and
        hotels, it seems reasonable if the competition itself would cost $100 or
        $200. I have no idea if that would be enough to make us sponsor
        independent. On Apr 30, 2007, at 12:12, megafrikkie wrote: &gt; I get

        which question you mean, so I will just answer all &gt; questions
        &gt;&gt; that you asked again. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Does the WCA* today
        still allow a sponsor to force additional &gt;&gt;&gt; restrictions on
        the allowable puzzles? &gt;&gt; I don't like the choice of words
        (allow/force), but technically the &gt; answer &gt;&gt; is: yes for WC
        2007, and no for any other competition and any other &gt;&gt;
        organisation team than the organisation team of WC 2007. &gt;&gt;
        Additionally: &gt;&gt; - WCA will not enforce the restrictions though,
        the organisation &gt; team may do &gt;&gt; that &gt;&gt; - WCA is
        talking and has been talking with organisation team to &gt; allow all
        &gt;&gt; puzzle brands &gt;&gt; - the current state is that because WC
        2007 is a special competition &gt; (25th &gt;&gt; anniversary, in home
        country of the cube, with the inventor &gt; involved), there &gt;&gt; is
        a special wish to only use Rubik's brands &gt;&gt; - WCA already has an
        informal reaction from organisation team that &gt; this is &gt;&gt; the
        last competition where the allowed brands are limited &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
        I still think the answer is obvious. It was already mentioned in the
        &gt; message &gt;&gt; by Pedro that you actually reacted to! &gt;&gt;
        You could also just have gone to the WC 2007 site and find the &gt;
        answer within &gt;&gt; one minute. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Would, for
        example, the WCA allow Seven Towns as a sponsor to &gt;&gt;&gt; require
        &gt;&gt;&gt; competitors to use their brand over East Sheen? &gt;&gt;
        Same answer. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; What if Seven Towns claimed East
        Sheen as an illegal copy? &gt;&gt;&gt; Would the WCA agree to ban it
        from a sponsored competition, or not? &gt;&gt;&gt; Or will the WCA make
        up its own mind about what &gt;&gt;&gt; puzzles are allowed and firmly
        stick to it? &gt;&gt; WCA does not have an active role in finding
        illegal puzzles (illegal &gt; copies, &gt;&gt; trademark violation et
        cetera). Still if some person or organisation &gt; points &gt;&gt; out
        with proof that a specific puzzle is illegal, then WCA will not &gt;
        allow &gt;&gt; that specific puzzle type in WCA competitions anymore.
        (In that case &gt; we have &gt;&gt; to change the WCA regulations.)
        &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; More questions? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It is not only
        we who should ask questions in a respectful way, &gt; but also
        &gt;&gt;&gt; the WCA who should answer them in a respectful way. I did
        not &gt;&gt;&gt; find it &gt;&gt;&gt; very professional for the WCA to
        reply to my question with "the &gt;&gt;&gt; answer &gt;&gt;&gt; is
        obvious" and then to not give me the answer, when I had made it &gt;
        clear &gt;&gt;&gt; from the outset that I did not find the WCA
        regulations to be a &gt;&gt;&gt; clear &gt;&gt;&gt; document, and that
        even if the answer to my question were in it, &gt;&gt;&gt; I was
        &gt;&gt;&gt; simply unable to find it at the time. &gt;&gt; In that case
        you could just have said that instead of offending me. &gt; To me it
        &gt;&gt; was like shooting the messenger instead of helping us create a
        free &gt; world. &gt;&gt; You are smart enough to understand that I am
        on the cubers side. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Have fun, &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ron

        Seven Towns and therefore will be allowed by Seven Towns. Maybe
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Studio Cubes are manufactured by a separate company, under

        I am not sure all competitors can afford such a thing. There surely is a
        difference between someone, say from Japan, and someone from Angola or
        Morocco for example. I think there are 2 visions : 1: large competition
        where people have lots of fun 2: "elite" competition (not only fast
        cubers, but restricted to rich &amp; fast cubers ==&gt; non cubing
        criteria) Personally I prefer #1. Gilles 2007/5/1, Lars Petrus

        Hi guys, German Open 2007 fun fact: Cl√©ment Gallet solved his 2nd cube
        blindfolded one-handed. That is why his result was 8 minutes instead of
        his usual 2-3 minutes. I hope everyone had a great time in Germany. I
        was very happy about the atmosphere and the willingness of everyone to
        help with judging and scramble. We have a great group of people. Have

        Hey Michiel, Did you come for Koninginnedag? I heard that it is a sort
        of pilgrimage. I was travelling back to the UK yesterday, via HOlland,
        and it was amazing to see everybody in orange with orange crowns and
        paintewd faces, having a great time. I can't imagine anyone in UK
        wanting to do that on the Queen Elizabeth II (or late Queen Mother's)

        I'll be flying there on Sunday. If any of the Dutch cubers want to &gt;
        &gt; meet, I am open to any suggestion. I'll be staying until the 18th.

        I'm sure a lot of people can't afford to travel to a World Championship,
        unless it happens to be held close to their home. Even if the
        competition itself is free of cost. That's just the nature of world
        championships, due to the size of the world. But among those who can
        afford to travel the globe, adding 10-20% to the total cost to pay for
        the actual competition should not keep away many more people. Perhaps
        even fewer that would be kept away by not being allowed to use their
        favorite cube brand. Someone has to pay for the competition, and whoever
        that is will be the one deciding how the competition is held. It's nice
        to have other people pay your bills, but then they get to decide things.
        I realize it's much too late to do this for WC2007. Just speculating. On

        Ryan, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The view of WCA is that all
        brands of puzzles should be allowed in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WCA
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; competitions. Unless the puzzles violate the WCA
        regulations of &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; course. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you please reply to the question at the head of
        this thread &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have no idea which question you mean, so
        I will just answer all &gt;&gt;&gt; questions &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you
        asked again. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does the WCA* today
        still allow a sponsor to force additional &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        restrictions on the allowable puzzles? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't like the
        choice of words (allow/force), but technically the &gt;&gt;&gt; answer
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is: yes for WC 2007, and no for any other competition
        and any other &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; organisation team than the organisation
        team of WC 2007. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - WCA
        will not enforce the restrictions though, the organisation &gt;&gt;&gt;
        team may do &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - WCA is talking and
        has been talking with organisation team to &gt;&gt;&gt; allow all
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; puzzle brands &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - the current state is
        that because WC 2007 is a special &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; competition
        &gt;&gt;&gt; (25th &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anniversary, in home country of the
        cube, with the inventor &gt;&gt;&gt; involved), there &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        is a special wish to only use Rubik's brands &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - WCA
        already has an informal reaction from organisation team that
        &gt;&gt;&gt; this is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the last competition where the
        allowed brands are limited &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I still
        think the answer is obvious. It was already mentioned in
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt;&gt; message &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by Pedro that
        you actually reacted to! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You could also just have gone
        to the WC 2007 site and find the &gt;&gt;&gt; answer within
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one minute. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        Would, for example, the WCA allow Seven Towns as a sponsor to
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; require &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; competitors to use
        their brand over East Sheen? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Same answer.
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What if Seven Towns claimed East
        Sheen as an illegal copy? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Would the WCA agree to
        ban it from a sponsored competition, or &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not?
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or will the WCA make up its own mind about what
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; puzzles are allowed and firmly stick to it?
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WCA does not have an active role in finding illegal
        puzzles &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (illegal &gt;&gt;&gt; copies, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        trademark violation et cetera). Still if some person or &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        organisation &gt;&gt;&gt; points &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out with proof that a
        specific puzzle is illegal, then WCA will not &gt;&gt;&gt; allow
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that specific puzzle type in WCA competitions anymore.
        (In that &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; case &gt;&gt;&gt; we have &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
        change the WCA regulations.) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; More
        questions? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not only we who
        should ask questions in a respectful way, &gt;&gt;&gt; but also
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the WCA who should answer them in a respectful way.
        I did not &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find it &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very
        professional for the WCA to reply to my question with "the
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; answer &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is obvious" and then to
        not give me the answer, when I had made it &gt;&gt;&gt; clear
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the outset that I did not find the WCA
        regulations to be a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clear &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        document, and that even if the answer to my question were in it,
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simply unable to find it
        at the time. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In that case you could just have said that
        instead of offending me. &gt;&gt;&gt; To me it &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was like
        shooting the messenger instead of helping us create a free &gt;&gt;&gt;
        world. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are smart enough to understand that I am on
        the cubers side. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have fun,

        Hi :) If wca official view is that it's brand neutral, then i can only
        conclude that there must be something wrong. If wca is truly brand
        neutral then we only allow brand neautral competitions :-) But ok, maybe
        it's storm in glass of water if 7towns has really promised to lift their
        ban from future sponsored competitions. I think we should never allow
        non-brand-neutral competitions ever again. The "non- branded" puzzles
        are a minority anyway. And competition is good also amongst puzzle
        manufacturers. If people get sponsors i think it's ok personally. As
        long as people can use any brand they want. As long as it behaves like
        the puzzle should. This should include using prototypes imho, not being
        restricted to "widely available" puzzles. Top athletes don't get their
        shoes or shirts off the local shops' shelves. If people start using
        exclusive customised puzzles it's ok with me. The benefit is quite small
        anyway. But we keep our freedom of choice :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        &gt; &gt; Someone has to pay for the competition, and whoever that is

        things. &gt; &gt; I realize it's much too late to do this for WC2007.

        seems reasonable if the competition itself &gt; &gt;&gt; would cost $100

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Ryan, &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        The view of WCA is that all brands of puzzles should be allowed in &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WCA &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; competitions. Unless the
        puzzles violate the WCA regulations of &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; course.
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you please reply to
        the question at the head of this thread &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have no
        idea which question you mean, so I will just answer all &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; questions &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you asked again. &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does the WCA* today still
        allow a sponsor to force additional &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        restrictions on the allowable puzzles? &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't
        like the choice of words (allow/force), but technically the &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; answer &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is: yes for WC 2007, and no
        for any other competition and any other &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        organisation team than the organisation team of WC 2007. &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally: &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - WCA will not
        enforce the restrictions though, the organisation &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; team
        may do &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - WCA is talking
        and has been talking with organisation team to &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; allow
        all &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; puzzle brands &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - the
        current state is that because WC 2007 is a special &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        competition &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (25th &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anniversary,
        in home country of the cube, with the inventor &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        involved), there &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is a special wish to only use
        Rubik's brands &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - WCA already has an informal
        reaction from organisation team that &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; this is &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the last competition where the allowed brands are
        limited &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I still think the
        answer is obvious. It was already mentioned in &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; message &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by Pedro that you
        actually reacted to! &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You could also just have gone
        to the WC 2007 site and find the &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; answer within &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one minute. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Would, for example, the WCA allow Seven Towns as a
        sponsor to &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; require &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        competitors to use their brand over East Sheen? &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        Same answer. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What if
        Seven Towns claimed East Sheen as an illegal copy? &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Would the WCA agree to ban it from a sponsored
        competition, or &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not? &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        Or will the WCA make up its own mind about what &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; puzzles are allowed and firmly stick to it? &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WCA does not have an active role in finding illegal
        puzzles &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (illegal &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; copies, &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trademark violation et cetera). Still if some person or
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; organisation &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; points &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out with proof that a specific puzzle is illegal, then
        WCA will not &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; allow &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that specific
        puzzle type in WCA competitions anymore. (In that &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        case &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; we have &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to change the WCA
        regulations.) &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; More
        questions? &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not
        only we who should ask questions in a respectful way, &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
        but also &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the WCA who should answer them in a
        respectful way. I did not &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find it &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very professional for the WCA to reply to my
        question with "the &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; answer &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is obvious" and then to not give me the answer,
        when I had made it &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; clear &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        from the outset that I did not find the WCA regulations to be a &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clear &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; document, and that
        even if the answer to my question were in it, &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
        I was &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simply unable to find it at the time.
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In that case you could just have said that instead
        of offending me. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To me it &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was
        like shooting the messenger instead of helping us create a free &gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; world. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are smart enough to
        understand that I am on the cubers side. &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;

        It is not obvious to me because I do not know &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Studio Cubes are
        manufactured by a separate company, under &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; license, for
        &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; example, and therefore might be allowed. The
        answer is not &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obvious to &gt;

        will impact your life beyond the scope of cubing. I have to say that
        point is arbitrary. My method of expression on this group gives no more
        insight than how I express myself on this group. I find it difficult to
        believe you could analyze my character based on that alone. It wouldn't
        be too difficult to find posts you have made out of frustration; at
        least mine are based on legitimate concerns. &gt; I will talk to
        SevenTowns. I do not believe that allowing different types &gt; of cubes
        hurts their publicity or their merchandising whatsoever. People &gt; see
        a cube, they don't think, "That's a Magic Square Puzzle!" They think,
        &gt; "That's a Rubik's Cube." And they will buy a Rubik's Cube, and not
        an &gt; imitation. Excellent point. This means there is no need to
        restrict based on brand then? :) -Richard &gt; On 4/27/07, Richard

        enough people vocalize their &gt; &gt; thoughts on this (and similar)
        issue(s). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In 2003 the restrictions were acceptable
        because they &gt; &gt; were something we had to swallow. And why not? We
        &gt; &gt; owe a lot of thanks to SevenTowns. I'm not defending &gt; &gt;
        the recent pressure to restrict competitions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The
        strangest thing to me is that we have to have this &gt; &gt; discussion
        at all. As I said above, we owe a lot of &gt; &gt; thanks to 7towns, but
        we no longer need their support &gt; &gt; in the same way as before. I
        owe a lot of thanks to &gt; &gt; my parents for raising me and providing
        me an &gt; &gt; acceptable start in life. Just because they did well
        &gt; &gt; and I am grateful would not justify their bullying me &gt;
        &gt; into making decisions of their choosing. To clarify &gt; &gt; on
        the analogy: SevenTowns was a wonderful incubator &gt; &gt; for the
        community, but we have simply outgrown their &gt; &gt; influence. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Ryan made some viable points as well regarding this &gt;
        &gt; whole situation. Read them again if you are unsure. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I also have to express my discontent with WCA &gt; &gt; authority
        ignoring important questions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I understand there is
        a WCA forum, but this is where &gt; &gt; the bulk of the community finds
        their information. &gt; &gt; Ten people telling 1000 people where to
        find &gt; &gt; information makes less sense than 1000 people telling
        &gt; &gt; those ten where to provide it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "I'm busy"
        isn't an acceptable excuse anymore for WCA &gt; &gt; officials. Either
        stop doing the job (i hope you &gt; &gt; don't) or find more people and
        delegate &gt; &gt; responsibility. It's not terribly difficult and I
        &gt; &gt; don't see the weakness in expanding the board some. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I would like to see a WCA board member's expanded &gt; &gt;
        answer on why we are still selling out to 7towns every &gt; &gt; two
        years? Or do we need the biannual reminder that &gt; &gt; we aren't a
        strong enough organization. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And regarding the above,
        I would like to see each &gt; &gt; board members opinion on the
        situation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is our board absent? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        With all due contempt, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Richard &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I think I follow what you're saying: the slide gives the impression of a
        canonical definition for orientation of cubies when there are many ways
        to assign an orientation to them. Luckily I believe that within the
        context of the presentation the purpose for my choice of these
        designations was clear, but I can see how as an independent entity it
        may be somewhat confusing. Thanks for pointing that out. -Daniel &gt;
        &gt; In "flip twist.doc" you make it look like you show "the" definition

        Hi all, At the recent German Open 2007, we had a LOT of fun. I team
        solved a lot with Joel, and also a bit with Stefan Pochmann, and it
        really is a funny event. Joel and I practised a bit, and developed some
        strategies, and we posted the unofficial world record (we are the first
        team to go under 40 seconds) -
        http://www.speedcubing.com/records/recs_fun_teamsolve.html So get
        practising, I'd like to see some more people trying this out at
        competitions/cube meetings! Maybe it would even be a nice "media event"
        for the World Championships. DanH :)

        In general I don't think I like that idea. But if it was to be put into
        place, I suggest that it be inversely proportional to the distance the
        competitor had to travel. Thus cubers that live in the city it is being
        hosted should pay the most. With this in place, I'd imagine it would
        defray the cost of running a competition make us independent. The more a
        compeitor has paid to travel, the less inclined I would be in asking
        them for an extra entry fee... it seems heartless. This fee could be an
        annual membership fee of some sort... It's easy for me to say becasue
        I'm becoming more willing to spend on traveling. Just to give you an
        idea of how much I'm willing to spend on this stuff.... I'm seriously
        considering attending CalTech Spring tournament this weekend. How

        Hi guys, I just received the good news that there will not be a
        limitation of using only Rubik's brands during WC 2007!!!!! For 3x3 cube
        there is still the limitation of legal copies though. I have no idea
        which copies are illegal and how to detect them. I think that if a cube
        looks like a regular Rubik's cube, then there is no way we can stop
        someone from using it. Any thoughts? Will update the WC 2007 website
        accordingly soon. Have fun, Ron --- In

        Hey Ron! That's good news! Even though I don't have a non-rubik, I'm
        sure the Eastsheen guys are happier now : ) I knew you guys could make
        it ; ) Pedro Ron &lt;ron@...&gt; escreveu: Hi guys, I just received the
        good news that there will not be a limitation of using only Rubik's
        brands during WC 2007!!!!! For 3x3 cube there is still the limitation of
        legal copies though. I have no idea which copies are illegal and how to
        detect them. I think that if a cube looks like a regular Rubik's cube,
        then there is no way we can stop someone from using it. Any thoughts?
        Will update the WC 2007 website accordingly soon. Have fun, Ron --- In

        actually been &gt; asked about this. I think if I were him, I wouldn't
        mind. &gt; &gt; Maybe I should also forbid people to use improved
        versions of my &gt; blindcubing method, that'd be similar. Though, I'm
        of course happy if &gt; people find improvements and use them. That's
        anything but &gt; disrespectful. &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt;

        You can also try "multiple team solve". So basically if you have 4
        people, there are 4 different cubes who are being solved using the same
        technique (each person does only one move and then passes the cube to
        the next person). This is also very funny (and of course, the more
        persons the better :D) Gilles 2007/5/3, Tobias Daneels

        I think it is not, the 2 lines of the borders are alligned so it is
        good, remember not to look at the top of the corner but on the inner
        side of that.

        Even though the top layer is less than 45¬∞ away from being solved, it
        seems that we are in this situation:
        http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/images/notsolved4.jpg
        Thus a +2 penalty. Maybe the angle of the camera view is not good enough
        for us to correctly estimate the situation as well. Otherwise, can
        somebody please explain to me how penalty applies to the 4x4? Also, I
        have watched Edouard's 12.73 seconds solve and the inspection time seems
        to be over 15 seconds + 1 second. I don't know if that would have
        changed anything (and I personally don't mind) but since we're pointing
        at possible judges' errors (Sorry for that). Maybe the new inspection
        procedure for 2008 will be better and easier (as discussed here
        http://tinyurl.com/2oz9kj ). Sven --- In

        I am a relatively new cuber, only beginning in February of this year,
        and my average solve time on the 3x3x3 is 1 minute 16 seconds. I believe
        that the part of the solving that slows me down is solving the middle
        layer. The sequence of moves I use for the middle layer, with the edge
        piece I want to move on the bottom of the back side, is FDF'D'R'D'. With
        no middle layer edge pieces correctly orientated or located, it takes me
        approximately 30 seconds to solve the middle layer. A turtle's pace no
        doubt, but I'm just glad I can solve it; my 4x4x4 Revenge is still
        unsolved following the two weeks after I purchased it. If anyone has a
        better sequence or method of solving the middle layer, please relay the
        info. also, any help with the Revenge would be greatly appreciated. I
        can't get past solving the first side.

        Hey guys, I'm on osx and I just plugged the stackmat into the line-in
        port (3.5mm stereo), turned the stackmat on, and launched calcube... but
        it didn't detect the stackmat. It said "Timer is OFF". My audio input is
        correctly selected as the mixer in the config. So I played around with
        the stackmat values... I only got it to detect it when I set the
        stackmat value to around 1-7 (default is 50, and they say the normal
        range is from 29-70). This is the only range I've found where it detects
        my stackmat, but no matter what calcube goes berserk (whether the
        15.165.165 checkbox is checked or not). The closer to 1, the more
        berserk, the farther, it seems to detect my stackmat less -- at around
        6-7 it only detects when I put my hands on the pads, but not in
        between... no timing, etc... so when I put my hands on the pads here
        it'll say "timer is ON" and when I take them off it'll say "timer is
        OFF" again. Let me know if something is unclear or you need more
        information. Have you guys experienced this? Have a solution? Alex On

        The rule for 4x4 is the same as for 5x5 and 3x3 : look at the lines. If

        the side of the cube, but we (or the camera) are looking at it from the
        back. I'm pretty sure Ron would have called a +2 on himself if it was
        over the edge. But if I watch the video it looks almost dead certain it
        was misaligned too far, although it's hard to tell because we don't see
        the borders. Since the pieces of the Rubik's 4x4x4 are a bit loose
        compared to other puzzles, it could be possible that the corner is too
        far one side but not on another side. On my 4x4x4 I was able to set up a
        position like this. Should the rules be adjusted for this case? Kind

        Ok that was the coolest thing I have seen in a long time. He memorized
        in 24 seconds and solved in the rest, so 31 seconds. He appears to be
        orienting first which, to me, is a strong motivator to work on learning
        a whole crapload of orienting algorithms to make memorization and
        execution of the orienting stage easier. I also think it is interesting
        to note that his first solve would have been over 1:28 by a few seconds,
        so maybe 1:30-1:40 range. So maybe the 55 was somewhat of a lucky case
        (he did memorize in half the time as from the first solve), though I'm
        not implying it was too lucky to count, just easier than some other
        cases. I am still absolutely blown away from seeing that, I really hope

        Oh my. On an amazing solve, it takes me that long to memorize. Given
        that they show the entire cube, it wouldn't be that hard to see exactly
        how easy the cases are. And the first solve would easily have been 1:34

        I think the 88 seconds is there to show wether or not he will break the
        WR. (but since it is 80 seconds this explaination does not make sense
        :-( ) On the contrary, it is possible that he suffered form pressure on
        his first solve and that he did much better on the 2nd solve when he
        felt more comfortable. Anyway, congratulations :-) It is very

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok that was the coolest thing I have seen in a
        long time. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He
        memorized in 24 seconds and solved in the rest, so 31 &gt; &gt; seconds.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appears to be orienting
        first which, to me, is a strong &gt; &gt; motivator to &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; work on learning a whole crapload of orienting algorithms to
        &gt; &gt; make &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; memorization and execution of
        the orienting stage easier. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I also think it is interesting to note that his first solve &gt;
        &gt; would &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been over
        1:28 by a few seconds, so maybe 1:30-1:40 range. &gt; So &gt; &gt; maybe
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the 55 was somewhat of a lucky case (he did
        memorize in half &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; as from the first solve), though I'm not implying it was too
        &gt; &gt; lucky &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; count,
        just easier than some other cases. I am still &gt; &gt; absolutely &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; blown &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away from seeing that, I
        really hope he goes to a &gt; competition &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; competes in the BLD category. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I really wish I had a natural memory like that. Or
        if he &gt; uses a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; memory system I wish I knew
        what he does. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris

        I do not know how this works (I actually asked Ron about such a case a
        while ago). Normally, Only 9.86 is the WR since Spanish Open is in an
        earlier time zone. However, you should compare the time schedules. Maybe
        there is still a chance for Dan... Anyway, congratulations too ! Gilles

        Hi guys, I must say I still find it hard to judge from these images. The
        video camera does not have a straight angle with the cube (you see parts
        of the right side of the cube). On the front side it looks like the
        corner has indeed passed the border of the next piece. Even by a clear
        margin. On the right side though it looks like it is still slightly
        clean. Although the time difference is not big (average would have been
        0.03 worse) I do feel bad about this case. :-( At the time it was my
        true opinion that the corner did not pass the line. I am very strict,
        also to myself. We may need an RFC for the next version of the WCA
        regulations for such cases. I already heard someone say that a half
        (quarter) turn would be easier to judge. Have fun, Ron --- In

        sure Ron would &gt; have called a +2 on himself if it was over the edge.
        But if I watch the video it looks almost &gt; dead certain it was
        misaligned too far, although it's hard to tell because we don't see the
        &gt; borders. &gt; &gt; Since the pieces of the Rubik's 4x4x4 are a bit
        loose compared to other puzzles, it could &gt; be possible that the
        corner is too far one side but not on another side. On my 4x4x4 I was
        &gt; able to set up a position like this. &gt; &gt; Should the rules be

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the video clearly shows that the solved cube
        should have received &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a +2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt;penalty &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are you sure about that?
        We checked it (as you can see on the video) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both judge and me thought it was exactly
        on the border. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; Great job, &gt; &gt; David It's true... the WR was 16.53 after
        Worlds 03, and now a best single solve like that won't even get you in
        the top 100! Anyway, I think that whether Dan set his time first doesn't
        matter much to you or me, but it would make a very big difference to
        Dan...

        Hi again guys, OK, I took my competition 4x4, I positioned it at the
        angle of the camera and tried to reconstruct exactly the same
        misalignment as the one on the video. There are at least 3 places where
        you could look for misalignment, and only 1 is the correct one: 1) left
        side of UFR corner &lt;==&gt; left side of ufr center (correct) 2) right
        side of UFR corner &lt;==&gt; right side of ufr center (incorrect) 3)
        right side of UFl edge &lt;==&gt; right side of uFL edge (incorrect)
        &gt;From the reconstructed misalignment on my cube the results were: 1)
        two mm past the border (with the loose corner I could bring it down to
        one mm) 2) still on good side of the border 3) exactly on the border So
        it looks like the judge's call (and mine of course) was incorrect. It
        should have been a penalty. Given the fact that I thought it was exactly
        on the border, I think I must have mistakingly looked at border 3. My
        mistake, sorry. FYI, I also think the 5x5 world record single had a
        misalignment that should have had a penalty. We will not change the
        results, but I think we do need actions to make sure this does not
        happen anymore. The best is to have very easy regulations. The second
        best is to better train the judges. Have fun, Ron --- In

        &gt; &gt; Hi guys, &gt; &gt; I must say I still find it hard to judge
        from these images. The video &gt; camera does not have a straight angle
        with the cube (you see parts of &gt; the right side of the cube). &gt;
        On the front side it looks like the corner has indeed passed the &gt;
        border of the next piece. Even by a clear margin. &gt; On the right side
        though it looks like it is still slightly clean. &gt; &gt; Although the
        time difference is not big (average would have been 0.03 &gt; worse) I
        do feel bad about this case. :-( &gt; At the time it was my true opinion
        that the corner did not pass the &gt; line. I am very strict, also to
        myself. &gt; &gt; We may need an RFC for the next version of the WCA
        regulations for &gt; such cases. I already heard someone say that a half
        (quarter) turn &gt; would be easier to judge. &gt; &gt; Have fun, &gt;

        think this is quite interesting. You can see Ron and Rama looking &gt;

        at it from the back. I'm &gt; pretty sure Ron would &gt; &gt; have
        called a +2 on himself if it was over the edge. But if I watch &gt; the
        video it looks almost &gt; &gt; dead certain it was misaligned too far,
        although it's hard to tell &gt; because we don't see the &gt; &gt;
        borders. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since the pieces of the Rubik's 4x4x4 are a
        bit loose compared to &gt; other puzzles, it could &gt; &gt; be possible
        that the corner is too far one side but not on another &gt; side. On my
        4x4x4 I was &gt; &gt; able to set up a position like this. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Should the rules be adjusted for this case? &gt; &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the video
        clearly shows that the solved cube should have &gt; received &gt; &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are you sure about that? We checked it (as
        you can see on &gt; the video) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both judge and me thought it was exactly

        &gt; FYI, I also think the 5x5 world record single had a misalignment
        that &gt; should have had a penalty. &gt; Hi Ron, Yes, I totally agree
        with you. The funny thing was, I was witnessing it, and assumed it was
        going to be a penalty... The judge had doubts, asked the main judge, who
        gave his opinion about it without even comming close to the cube. It all
        went by in a flash, and nobody in the audience got the time to even come
        close to the cube and judge for themselves; the judge quickly picked up
        the cube, and the incident was over. This last remark about the audience
        not being able to see for themselves might seem irrelevant to some, but
        I think it's quite important, especially when it's about a world record.

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He memorized in 24 seconds and solved
        in the rest, so 31 &gt; &gt; seconds. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; appears to be orienting first which, to me, is a strong
        &gt; &gt; motivator to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work on learning a whole
        crapload of orienting algorithms to &gt; &gt; make &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; memorization and execution of the orienting stage easier. &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also think it is interesting
        to note that his first solve &gt; &gt; would &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been over 1:28 by a few seconds, so maybe
        1:30-1:40 range. So &gt; &gt; maybe &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the 55 was
        somewhat of a lucky case (he did memorize in half &gt; &gt; the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; time &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as from the first solve),
        though I'm not implying it was too &gt; &gt; lucky &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; count, just easier than some other cases. I
        am still &gt; &gt; absolutely &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blown &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; away from seeing that, I really hope he goes to a competition
        &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competes in the BLD category.
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I really wish I had a
        natural memory like that. Or if he uses &gt; a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Spain is ahead of California by many hours. It would be very nice for
        Dan to have held the world record, even for a second. It is a shame,
        however, that by any means, whatever title is conveyed, the fact of the
        matter remains that there was a 9.86 second solve officially done before
        the 10.06. The video of Dan thinking he got a world record is absolutely
        hilarious though. We'll try to make it available once we get it. There
        was definitely a lot of confusion, and when I was called over by Chris
        Dzoan, I thought I was being asked to referee a rule violation or an
        accidental timer malfunction. -Tyson On May 5, 2007, at 8:24 PM, Michael

        We have more information available on the website for the US Open so
        please check it out. I'm not sure if people know this, but we actually
        have some financial sponsorship this time! Winning Moves will be sending
        the top United States competitor to Budapest, Hungary for the World
        Rubik's Cube 2007 Championships in order to represent the United States.
        I strongly urge people to attend this competition in Chicago. I won't
        say that it's the last thing I put together, but certainly the number of
        competitions like these that I will organize will become less common. I
        don't really have time to even read the yahoo groups... the same groups
        that I read with fanatical precision a couple years ago. So show up,
        solve some Rubik's Cubes, and get some other guy to buy you a plane
        ticket to Budapest. We have expanded the list of events that will be
        available. I am finalizing the schedule of the competition, but expect
        qualifying rounds on Saturday, and semi-final and final rounds on
        Sunday. Please register so that we know how many people will attend.

        Hi Corwin, With team solving, you solve a cube with 2 persons. This
        means one team member can make only 1 move at a time. For an example:

        Hi Fr√©d√©rick, Based on that 3rd image, I think it is still debatable
        whether it is solved or a 2 seconds penalty. I just have to trust the
        judge there, and for me there is no way to see for myself, allthough the
        3rd picture there provides some clues. I tried to reconstruct the
        situation, and found out that it matters from what distance the picture
        was taken. I set up a cube in such a state where the lines exactly form
        one line, and took a picture from a large distance. I zoomed in on both
        pictures, and my conclusion is that my suspicion is at least justified.
        This conclusion is partly based on how far the LFd piece is sticking out
        of the cube. I know this is NOT the piece to look at for judging, but
        when reconstructing the cube, I find it hard to make a picture from the
        same angle where it looks like the LFd piece comes out that far while
        the puzzle is in fact still officialy in solved state. You see, trusting
        judges is not an automatical thing for me, as I see more things
        happening during official competitions, like: Cube touched with other
        hand during OH solve to prevent it from falling, no disqualification. No
        2 second penalty given. Judge helping after POP (famous example). My
        intention was not to complain about this particular incident, but more
        about the procedures in general. I did not offend you in anyway, so I
        don't see why I should apologize. - Jo√´l. --- In

        Tyson, are you annoyed that Europe got the first sub-10 official solve
        or what? Does it matter who did it first? The important things should be
        that it was an amazing achievement and that hopefully it will inspire
        others for even better times in the future, wherever it will be ;-) -Per

        have been a penalty. Not with the outer layer, there I think it is

        past the border. Anyway, we will not change the results. Have fun, Ron

        &gt; From: "Tyson Mao" &gt; Winning Moves will be &gt; sending the top
        United States competitor to Budapest, Hungary for the &gt; World Rubik's
        Cube 2007 Championships in order to represent the United &gt; States.
        Questions: Best single? Best average? Any round, or in the finals? (Have
        you considered the possibility of a tie?) (OK, getting more unrealistic,
        but what if someone breaks all OH, BLD, and 2x2x2 records and misses
        first place in 3x3x3 by 0.01?) And (I'll quote it from the website):
        "Contest open to all. Winning Moves will sponsor the U.S. Competitor
        with the best time in the 3x3x3 to represent the U.S. at the 2007 World
        Championship in Budapest." -"open to all." -"U.S. Competitor" That can
        only be consistent if "U.S. Competitor" is anyone who competes in an
        American Competition. What about foreign nationalities? This is, after
        all, called the "U.S. Open," not the "Nationals," like last year, so the
        title implies a mindset that "U.S. representative" doesn't. I'm planning
        to attend the U.S. Open, but with German nationality (as always). I
        would be quite happy if this theoretically gives me an opportunity to go
        to World, but I can't tell whether it does... Confusedly, Lucas Garron

        The "winner" of the competition. The winner of the competition is the
        person who wins the 3x3x3 speed solve competition. This is the one the
        media will pick up, and the 3x3x3 speed solve competition has always
        been the main event. And for the last three years, you have to have the
        fastest trimmed average of 5 to win. -Tyson On May 6, 2007, at 4:59 AM,

        Annoyed? Why would I be annoyed? It is a wonderful accomplishment. I was
        saying this from a standpoint of utility for Dan and Jaquinot. If Dan
        gets the world record a microsecond before Jacquinot, what happens? Dan
        is able to call himself a former world record holder, and Jaquinot
        becomes the current world record holder. Let's say happiness there is 10
        + 50 = 60. If Jaquinot gets the world record first, his happiness is the
        same. He doesn't care of Dan did a 10.08 solve, he's still happy that he
        is a current world record holder. Meanwhile, Dan is disappointed, and
        looks like a sad panda. Happiness there is probably -10 + 50 = 40. So
        please explain why I would feel annoyed. -Tyson On May 6, 2007, at 7:06

        We cannot change the results. We have said all along that video evidence
        will not be accepted. In the United States, maybe 50 years ago, an
        umpire made a bad call in the world series. Someone had a picture of the
        person touching first base with the ball still in the air, and the
        umpire called him out, so they blew up the picture and it ended up on
        the front page. We will still continue to rely on humans to make these
        calls. I really do think it'll make things easier. -Tyson On May 6,

        Hi Lucas, The competition is open to everyone. Everyone can compete. The
        grand prize is the opportunity to go to Budapest to represent the United
        States in the World Championships. Unfortunately, you represent Germany
        in the WCA and you will not be able to change your country of

        It is too bad we don't keep track of two second penalties. I would

        have had a judge carry my cube over to the main judges table, instead of
        calling the main judge over. I'm not very fond of this procedure, and I
        wonder if it is against the rules. On a loose cube with 1mm making a

        it means "making moves". Another problem: For some puzzles (not cubes),
        touching them may be necessary. Gilles.

        Hi Frederick, My conclusion is not based on what I saw when I was
        witnessing the solve. During that, I only was suspicious, and I was a
        little surprised about the procedure, how the important decision was
        taken that quickly. Based on the images though, my suspicion is at least
        justified. I was not in front of it, that is right, and the same thing
        goes for the camera. Here is another image from the same video:
        http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~jnoort/img/5x5x5.jpg As you can see, the
        blue lines exactly seem to match the black ones. Anyone can try to
        reconstruct this with his own 5x5, to see that this is only possible
        when you look at the cube from an angle; and indeed, on the picture we
        also see part of the green face. Also, the blue line at the red cross
        exactly matches the black line. If I reconstruct this on my 5x5, at that
        place, the second layer from the bottom is 'sticking out'. (If this is
        not the case on your 5x5, you have a very special 5x5 :)). If I now look
        at the cube from a straight angke, so that I can't see the green or blue
        face, and look at the place of the red cross again, I can see that it is
        past the border slightly. If I am wrong, just tell me where I am wrong
        in this. - Jo√´l. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        Hi all, There is only one realy way to settle disputes like this, and
        that is to use the judgement set down in the ARSE (Association of Rubik
        Speedsolving Experts) regulations. Article 5 - Deciding if a penalty is
        needed. Step 1 - Carefully set down the puzzle so that the misaligned
        layers are perpendicular to the playing surface. Step 2 - The judge,
        with his/her dominant hand, or if ambidextrous, either hand, should then
        slam down on the puzzle to align the layers, being careful not to hurt
        themselves or any nearby competitors/judges/audience members. Step 3 -
        If the puzzle is solved, it is fine. If it is not solved, then a penalty
        must be applied based on the procedure for giving penalties set out in
        article 6. By these regulations, Fredericks case is most definitely
        fine. Ron's case is a bit more tricky to judge. Dan ;) --- In

        &gt; Yes, I totally agree with you. The funny thing was, I was &gt;
        witnessing &gt; &gt; &gt; it, and assumed it was going to be a
        penalty... The judge had &gt; doubts, &gt; &gt; &gt; asked the main
        judge, who gave his opinion about it without even &gt; &gt; &gt; comming
        close to the cube. It all went by in a flash, and nobody &gt; in &gt;
        &gt; &gt; the audience got the time to even come close to the cube and
        &gt; judge for &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves; the judge quickly picked up
        the cube, and the &gt; incident was &gt; &gt; &gt; over. This last
        remark about the audience not being able to see &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt;
        themselves might seem irrelevant to some, but I think it's quite &gt;
        &gt; &gt; important, especially when it's about a world record. &gt;

        Frederick! Get over it! No penalty was given :-) So all this talk about
        "should have been" is hypothetical. There's no consequences involved

        precisely. There's always borderline cases. That's why there is a judge

        penalty... The judge had &gt; doubts, &gt; &gt; &gt; asked the main

        close to the cube. It all went by in a flash, and nobody &gt; in &gt;

        &gt; judge for &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves; the judge quickly picked up

        as much as i hate to say it, i agree with per. i think its big of ron to
        go to all the effort and keeping a non-ego filled head to find out if
        his was a penalty or not. regarding the 5x5, from the picture i see that
        it is definitely questionable, its a bad angle to tell if its straight
        down on the left, and based on the line over on the right side, it looks
        like its a bit past the line, which would mean the one on the left side
        is too. its not a big deal since you're not loosing your precious single
        time record, so turn the ego down a bit. i think its a good chance to
        learn about the downfalls of our current system, and we could learn from
        it to improve future competitions. Per Kristen Fredlund

        (Reviving the recent thread about scramble qualities) I read the source
        code of Jaap's scrambler, the one used for official competitions:
        http://worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles/ scramble_cube.htm
        Looks like I've used a slightly non-equivalent algorithm. Don't know
        about the other guys (Herbert and Lucas). Jaap's scrambler doesn't allow
        an R turn followed by an L turn, only L followed by R (and similar for
        the other axes). The alg I used allows both. So we're talking about
        different sets of scrambles. STEFAN, scramble length: 25 probability for
        0 flipped edges: 0.00134544044252748545 probability for 2 flipped edges:

        Corwin: For the network feature to work, you need two people. One person
        will be the server and the other will be the client. Have the server
        start JNetCube in server mode and pick a port. Any port will work, but
        you can use port 1234 for this demonstration. After the server has
        started, then the client will start his timer in client mode and enter
        in the information for the server. The client will type in the IP
        address of the server (which the server can find by visiting
        whatismyip.com ) and port 1234 (or whatever port you started the server
        on). Then, the client connects to the server and you two will be
        connected. If that isn't working for you, then odds are the server is
        behind a router and/or firewall and you must connect to the router and
        configure "port forwarding" and must forward port 1234 (or whatever port
        you want) to the server computer's local ip address. For more
        information on port forwarding with you particular router, see your
        router manual and it will be in there. Thanks, -Chris On May 6, 2007, at

        yeah i'd be pretty close to the top of list actually. however i think
        this time it was directly more towards tyson personally as opposed to
        america, which still sucks, if people have petty personal differences
        with someone, email them privately about it. some people make themselves
        a target with whining, but in this case i don't really see why people
        would want to get so uptight. thibaut had the wr before dan, it would
        have been nice for dan to be able to have the wr for a bit, even if i
        was just a couple minutes, anyone that can say they wouldn't feel that
        way for themselves also, is full of crap, and i don't see why pointing
        that out is such a big deal. goodxy2002 &lt;goodxy2002@...&gt; wrote:

        Don't generalise my usage of 'you' towards all of america. The time of
        10.08 occured after the 9.86 one, I fail to see why you're still arguing

        Hi Thom, I am sorry, but it has been pointed out to me that my message
        was perhaps a bit unclear. Leyan sent me a message this morning telling
        me that "world records should not be given out based on happiness." To
        this I completely agree. As stated by other members of the group, the
        intent of my message was that it would have been nice if Dan had done
        the 10.08 solve first. Everything would be the same, but Dan would walk
        away with something nice. However, the fact of the matter is that Dan
        did NOT solve the 10.08 first, and he does not get a world record. I
        agree that Dan should not get a world record, and Dan knows this as
        well. It doesn't matter who awards the world record, it is truth of the
        matter that at the time of the 10.08 second solve, there was a 9.86
        second official solves on the books. The internet can easily
        misinterpret what we say. So don't worry about anything, and let's move
        on, and I'll be sure to make my writing a bit more clear in the future.

        I try not to post too much, but I just realized that this community
        contains some very very skilled programmers. I'd just like to throw it
        out there if there are any programmers, in particular those with
        experience in Java, Python, or C++, that are interested in a job in
        Beverly Hills, please e-mail me personally. This job is very
        competitive, and you will be tested on your knowledge before they grant
        you an interview. Preferably, you have a resume ready. So let me know. I
        work for a hedge fund as a commodities trader. -Tyson [Non-text portions

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The video of Dan thinking he got

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WR &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then it got beat.
        Anyway looking back at the World Champs o3 &gt; &gt; &gt; to now &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; amazing to see how

        &gt; It's true... the WR was 16.53 after Worlds 03, and now a best &gt;
        &gt; &gt; single &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solve like that won't even get
        you in the top 100! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Anyway, I think that whether Dan set his time first doesn't &gt; &gt;
        &gt; matter &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much to you or me, but it would
        make a very big difference to &gt; &gt; &gt; Dan... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I do not know if anyone realized but for the first time in history there
        will be 3 different competitions that will take place on the same day.
        Besides the fact that it is great, it also raises issues like the one we
        have seen with the Spanish Open and the Berkeley competition. What
        happens if 1 record is broken several times and in different
        competitions ? Personally I think that publishing the time schedules in
        the GMT time could be a solution. If 1 record is broken twice, the one
        who did it before on the basis of the time schedule gets the record. It
        if it as at the same exact hour, then the fastest gets it. What do you
        think ? (maybe I am just too pessmistic, or too optimistic depending on
        which side you are :p) Gilles VDP

        There was such a conflict last year on October 21 and November 18th...
        Here's my idea: give the records priority based on the exact time that
        the record was set (translated into GMT, say), and not the time of the
        competition or event in question. One way to do this would be to record
        the time that every possibly record-breaking solve was finished (it
        would be the main judge's responsibility to do this, and then translate
        it into GMT at some point), and then send this data to the WCA along
        with the records. What this would mean, though, is that if one person
        gets (say) a 9.70 in the 3x3x3 event, and then someone later gets a 9.60
        later but during the same event, both records would have to be
        considered WRs for consistency's sake, and this would go against WCA
        regulations. But I think that as the number of competitions and
        competitors increases (as it invariably must), doing something like this

        I think that this needs to be address if we continue to have more
        competitons the same day. I know if I break a record early on in a day.
        and then someone else that same day elsewhere breaks my record. I still

        There is nothing in the WCA regulations that states this would be
        against them. The only rules I found is the following: "9i2) Regional
        records are recognised at the end of a round. If a record is broken
        twice or more in a round, only the latter is recognised." So the main
        judge should annotate the time at the end of each round to determine the
        WR history. Sven --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Dan

        Hi Patrick, I guess that the company is based in China since their

        of $135.00 including $25.00 of Airmail shipping 4-10 days (Parcel Post)
        to Brazil. Basically I bought 1 Eastsheen 2x2x2, two DIY 3x3x3, 1
        Eastsheen 4x4x4 and 1 Eastsheen 5x5x5. And some those others strange
        cubes including one 2x2x2 penguin like! :) This is my first order with
        them. To check the quality of their products since I would like to sell
        it here because there are no good sellers in Brazil for these "toys". I
        bought last Friday and Yesterday (Monday) they sent me an email telling
        that the order was shipped. Now is just wait and see the results! :)

        against this regulation. It's nothing serious - I'm just pointing out

        Thanks for clearing up that rule. I didn't remember it. It does say at
        the end of the round though. I think that means that if someone were to
        break the record in the first round of a competition and then someone
        else were to get a faster time in the second round, they would both be
        recognized. However, I'm pretty sure this rule applies to the same
        competition. I believe the reason for this is so that the time you
        compete in a certain round isn't an issue. For example, if someone were
        to break a record but another person has not had a chance to complete
        his or her solves and then they complete a solve breaking the previous
        record but not the new one, they do not get a WR. If they had gone
        before, however, it would have been a WR. If this were the case, people
        would all want to go first so that they have the highest chance at a
        record. Competitions would be hard to run with everyone fighting for the
        chance to compete first so this issue is resolved with this rule. I
        suppose another way to resolve it would be to give both competitors the
        record but then you could potentially have somebody who never beat the
        record at the time of the solve but is still recognized as a former
        record holder (like in my situation if I were given it). Anyways, the
        main thing I wanted to point out was that it says at the end of the
        round and not in the whole event. So, if I am interpreting it correctly,
        the speedsolve world record can be broken 3 times in one tournament if
        there are 3 rounds. If I am mistaken then someone please correct me. And
        just for the record, I don't believe that I deserve the WR because I
        know that Thibaut completed his solves hours before mine. Oh, and I also
        wanted to say congratulations for the first sub 10 time and for the new
        world record. Sub 10 is incredible. -Dan --- In

        Okay, I see why I didn't spot this one-- it leads to a cross with one of
        the side colors (orange if you scrambled with yellow on top, green in
        front). I was looking for the cross-on-bottom color only. Still-- a nice
        one for color-neutral solvers :) I believe I could shave a few seconds
        if I could come up with more clever openings during inspection. I can
        generally do an X-cross but it doesn't seem to help my times, because my
        X-cross is just as many moves as doing an optimal cross-only and then
        the first pair. My X- cross method is basically to build a 2x2x2,
        starting with any already- built or nearly-built pair, then slot in the
        other two cross edges. Anybody have any good suggestions or web sites
        for doing better X- cross openings? Chris --- In

        I think it makes sense that this rule means in the same competition. It
        would seem true as well that everyone would want to go first to try and
        break the record. But what I am still unclear about is this. If Dan had
        broken the record before Thibault would he be credited with breaking the
        WR? It is of little matter to me. but I think if someone breaks the
        recordin one part of the world, and then somewhere else in the world
        another person breaks it, both should be recognized as having broken the
        record. Congrats Thibault for being the first to break the 10 second.

        Thanks for clearing up that rule. I didn't remember it. It does say at
        the end of the round though. I think that means that if someone were to
        break the record in the first round of a competition and then someone
        else were to get a faster time in the second round, they would both be
        recognized. However, I'm pretty sure this rule applies to the same
        competition. I believe the reason for this is so that the time you
        compete in a certain round isn't an issue. For example, if someone were
        to break a record but another person has not had a chance to complete
        his or her solves and then they complete a solve breaking the previous
        record but not the new one, they do not get a WR. If they had gone
        before, however, it would have been a WR. If this were the case, people
        would all want to go first so that they have the highest chance at a
        record. Competitions would be hard to run with everyone fighting for the
        chance to compete first so this issue is resolved with this rule. I
        suppose another way to resolve it would be to give both competitors the
        record but then you could potentially have somebody who never beat the
        record at the time of the solve but is still recognized as a former
        record holder (like in my situation if I were given it). Anyways, the
        main thing I wanted to point out was that it says at the end of the
        round and not in the whole event. So, if I am interpreting it correctly,
        the speedsolve world record can be broken 3 times in one tournament if
        there are 3 rounds. If I am mistaken then someone please correct me. And
        just for the record, I don't believe that I deserve the WR because I
        know that Thibaut completed his solves hours before mine. Oh, and I also
        wanted to say congratulations for the first sub 10 time and for the new
        world record. Sub 10 is incredible. -Dan --- In

        Hi guys, I have to agree that the best way to figure out the WR holder
        would be to write down the exact time that he or she breaks it. Since I

        I dont know how good your old cube is, but the cubes from cube4you.com
        and 9spuzzles.com (i think they are the same) are pretty good, even
        without lube.. I dont have many different cubes and I am no expert on
        preparing them, but the ones from cube4you/ 9spuzzles are by far the
        best I ever had..

        My times are in the low 20s with Fridrich, but I'm switching to
        block-building F2L, and my times are a bit slower with that method. I
        guess there are three ways I practice: 1. Going really slowly, trying to
        find the most efficient way of using my method. 2. Going at a medium
        speed, focusing on looking ahead and going as smoothly as possible. 3.
        Going as fast as possible. The first two ways are great for practicing
        the F2L, which is probably where you'll improve most. Fred On 5/9/07,

        Considering they're students in a school, and might not want to spend
        lots of time memorizing speedcubing algorithms like OLL and PLL (or
        maybe you want to?), I'd say start with getting your recognition time
        faster, fingers moving faster (fingertricks, etc) during algorithms, and
        maybe learn the intuitive F2L (which might slow you down initially until
        you learn it well). There are really 2 things that get you moving
        faster: - faster eyes and fingers - more knowledge (F2L, OLL, PLL) Watch
        videos on youtube and at strangepuzzle to see how faster cubers use
        their fingers to do multiple moves at once. Learn the intuitive F2L and
        maybe the PLL too (21 algorithms). Intuitive F2L:
        http://dougreed.no-ip.org/~doug/f2l/f2l.htm F2L Algorithms:
        http://www.speedcubing.com/f2l_crossbottom_print.html Last Layer
        Permutations: http://www.cubezone.be/pll.html Guide to Fingertricks:
        http://cubewhiz.com/fingertricks.html Don't disregard the cross though.
        Work on it too. Now, getting faster is just practice and learning more.
        Keep cubing. Alex On 5/9/07, smgfreak_dk

        First, you completely change the subject of an existing conversation
        thread instead of starting your own. Second, why ask Tyson specifically?
        He is not the only person capable of helping you (certainly not the only
        person in this group) and he does not exist to fulfill your every
        request. Third, by not asking questions about specific problems you
        might be having, your message indicates that you haven't even tried, and
        that you are reluctant to put in any effort of your own. Fourth, please
        refer to http://excessivepunctuation.ytmnd.com/ In conclusion, we don't

        Therefore, slice moves would only be a bad thing if, for example, r'R
        were more difficult to perform than, say, RB. I'm not an expert with
        feet, but isn't r'R at least as easy as RB? Also, my guess is that the
        real limiting factor for foot methods the number of cube rotations and
        the number of double turns. -- Ryan Heise http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/

        I personally like http://www.speedcubing.com/ . this site is very good
        for learning some of the basic permutations/algorithms/etc. what i went
        to first from your position was learning the last layer orientations and
        permutations (speedcubing.com/chris/3- orientations.hmtl,
        speedingcubing.com/chris/3-permutations.html respectively). there are
        some other links/etc. on the index page that will link you to some
        different ways to solving the cube. i personally would go to the last
        layer orientations and permutations first. then when you have those
        down, i suggest Freidrich's F2L to memorize next if you still want to
        get faster. Good Luck! email me if you have any other questions I would
        be glad to help!

        I was in the middle of a trigger when the edge popped out and the corner
        somehow filled it's place as I continued the L turn. I can't quite
        remember what happend, I was turning pretty quickly at the time. The
        first picture I took right after I set the cube down, I was afraid it
        wouldn't stay long without other pieces falling out. After that picture
        I realized the cube was surprisingly stable so I took pictures from
        other angles. I've just never had a corner slide into the spot of the
        popped out edge as it happened. Definitely a unique pop, easily one of
        the coolest I've ever had. Chris --- In

        How do you secure them without glueing them? I want to be able to remove

        Too many of those recently, increased popularity sadly has its
        disadvantages, too. Here's what I suggest: We build a comprehensive yet
        concise tutorial of what it takes to become a good speedcuber. Not too
        short (should cover all the essentials) but also not too long (shouldn't
        overwhelm and scare away). Should be possible for a newbie to read and
        understand in 10-15 minutes. - Where to get good cubes. - How to prepare
        them well. - An overview of solving methods (like a general description
        and then a diagram and short description for each of the steps, but no
        algorithm sets) and links to sites showing them in more detail. -
        Suggestions for how to practice (including tools like scramble
        generators and timer programs). - Suggestions for how to get faster
        (finger tricks, looking ahead, etc). - An overview of discussion sites
        and some guidelines, especially how to ask good questions. Then whenever
        some idiot asks an idiot question like that, we could simply reply with
        a link to that tutorial. It's on my list of cubing projects I'd like to
        do, but I don't have the time for it myself so here's the suggestion,
        maybe others can do it? Cheers! Stefan P.S. Nice picture, nice attitude.

        There is definitely the possibility of cheating to worry about. I
        remember at Horace Mann a few years ago a small group was able to
        determine which particular solve in a round had extended cross -- and

        that extended cross for your primary color. How is this tactic thwarted

        personally like http://www.speedcubing.com/ . this site is very good for
        learning some of the basic permutations/algorithms/etc. what i went to
        first from your position was learning the last layer orientations and
        permutations (speedcubing.com/chris/3- orientations.hmtl,
        speedingcubing.com/chris/3-permutations.html respectively). there are
        some other links/etc. on the index page that will link you to some
        different ways to solving the cube. i personally would go to the last
        layer orientations and permutations first. then when you have those
        down, i suggest Freidrich's F2L to memorize next if you still want to

        No offense to Jeff, but I promote learning rather than memorizing. F2L
        may always be the longest step in cube solving. It'd be good to get an
        intuitive insight into solving the first two layers (solving the each
        corner-edge pair at once), instead of memorizing algos. Also, there are
        about 57 OLL algos and 21 PLL algos. Just so you know :) Alex On

        02:41:40 -0000 &gt; &gt; I personally like http://www.speedcubing.com/ .
        this site is very good &gt; for learning some of the basic
        permutations/algorithms/etc. what i &gt; went to first from your
        position was learning the last layer &gt; orientations and permutations
        (speedcubing.com/chris/3- &gt; orientations.hmtl,
        speedingcubing.com/chris/3-permutations.html &gt; respectively). there
        are some other links/etc. on the index page that &gt; will link you to
        some different ways to solving the cube. i personally &gt; would go to
        the last layer orientations and permutations first. then &gt; when you
        have those down, i suggest Freidrich's F2L to memorize next if &gt; you
        still want to get faster. &gt; &gt; Good Luck! &gt; email me if you have

        So far I don't see any of these as feasible options. The idea of always
        scrambling in the same orientation is actually counter productive; Think
        about it...there is no need to talk about orientation of the cube at
        that point, just what to do when you get it (most people solve for white
        remember!) Unique mixes isn't going to work. The fairness and equality
        issue would go on perpetually. Leaving the room: I would think this
        would not only make the competition less fun, but more work for the
        organizers. I think the best way would be to use random orientations of
        the cube before scrambling it *and* random scrambles within the round.
        example: For Round 1 of 5 solves: Person A gets scrambles this order:
        2,4,3,1,5 Person B gets scrambles this order: 3,2,5,1,4 There is still
        room for cheating this way, but much less than before. I think the
        problem in managing this issue is that there are so many competitors.
        The first person to solve in a big competition can have 5-10 minutes to
        reflect on the scramble and share the information with others. With this
        in mind, perhaps it'd be best to have the fastest solvers go first.
        Obviously they would reap the greatest benefits of insider information
        anyway, and they would go through their solves fast enough I think as
        not to relate it to each other so quickly. The benefit is twofold here
        as well. You get your first group of people done with a round very
        quick, and then they are free to assist in that round for
        judging/organizing, hence speeding up the remaining competitors. Just
        some ideas, Richard --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        &gt; &gt; What do I have to do? &gt; &gt; Thanks, Tobias It's happening
        all the time =) The problem is that the thread of the screw is to steep.
        So it easily comes out by itself. To dela with it you must (gently) pull
        the tip out of the puzzle (there are a number of small parts that will
        come loose, a spring and a small metal ball for example, don't loose
        those parts =) Then cut open the centre using a thin blade. Then you
        apply Epoxy on the srew tip and put the peices back an thighten the
        screw. Then you can use a little Epoxy til glue the tip bakc on. The
        Epoxy on the srew tip will make sure it won't come of as easily as it
        would without. // Kenneth

        &gt; &gt; Didn't both persons have the exact same chance to get easy or

        As N increases, the probability that one competitor will get 3 easy
        scrambles and another competitor will get 3 difficult scrambles becomes
        very high. Let's just look at the memorisation part, and imagine a
        competition where you are timed to see how fast you can memorise three
        random bitfields. If each competitor gets DIFFERENT random bitfields,
        then with a large number of competitors it becomes more likely that one
        competitor might get three easy cases like 1111011110, ... while another
        competitor might get three more difficult cases like 101001101, ... We
        know that the entropy of different random strings can be extremely
        different making one much easier to memorise than another. But if you
        design a competition in the way you are suggesting, then luck is playing
        too much a part, and a less skilled competitor may well beat a more
        skilled competitor, simply by being given the gift of easier cases than
        everyone else. This is what I like about everyone being given the same
        cases. Then even if the cases are easier than normal, then everyone
        still gets the same advantage equally(*). I actually have some data
        which I could look at some day, in the multi-player simulator:
        http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/speed/ I have recorded every scramble and
        every solve since the game first started up, and I would be able to run
        some pretty graphs on it. In this game, the two competitors who are
        racing are always given the same scramble. I have noticed that often two
        competitors who are equally matched will get around the same times as
        each other, and then suddenly they will BOTH get very good times on the
        same scramble. Then other times tey will suddenly BOTH get very bad
        times on the same scramble. There are exceptions, but from observations
        it seems that both competitors are generally going up and down at the
        same time. (*) The alternative is to design a scrambling algorithm that
        tries to aim for a minimum level of entropy -- Ryan Heise

        It is a terrible misconception that learning the F2L intuitively is
        absolutely better. Through repetition most 'fast' speedcubers execute
        F2L cases mechanically anyway (even though they started intuitively)
        Take commutators for example; there seems to be an agreement that this
        is an excellent function in solving for bld (though it has at least one
        other practical application in FMC). Take any corner or edge subset,
        allow me time to match commutators with my own mechanical alg set. In
        execution I am faster every time because I don't waste time for
        intuition, which is ultimately a poor investment in speedcubing IMO.
        Obviously there is going to be intuition involved in the F2L on some
        level, but the 41 cases need not be understood. Some years ago the
        consensus was that solving for one primary color was the best approach,
        yet dual solving becomes more common and proves itself very well.

        I had an idea about the order that people solve in a round; this might
        be useful for future record attempts as well as to curb possible
        cheating. The idea is to 'seed' the competitors. The competitors would
        be ranked in order of their best time in contest, and then the
        competitors would go in order of speed, either from fastest to slowest
        or vice versa. Tied competitors would proceed in a random but previously
        decided order, and competitors who haven't done the event in competition
        yet would go last (again in a random order, or perhaps decided by their
        unofficial record). If you have the fastest people go first, there will
        be less opportunity for cheating (since it is the fastest people who get
        more benefit from cheating, they are given less time in which to observe
        solves) and the fast people could help with scrambling and judging, but
        by about halfway through an event very few people would be watching
        since all of the really fast people had already gone. If you have the
        slowest people go first, people are encouraged to keep watching, and
        there is more of an opportunity for people who are not necessarily the
        fastest in the competition to break existing records, but on the other
        hand the fast people would have a ton of time to cheat (if they wanted
        to). Again, I don't know if this will be useful, but it may be
        worthwhile to organize the competitors in an event in some order other
        than random.

        I'm with Rich here... I would assume the vast vast majority of people
        who want to learn F2L do so because they want to improve their
        speedcubing. People at this point are usually beginners who know a
        beginner method, and want to get faster by using a more advanced method.
        They won't have anywhere near enough experience to appreciate the finer
        points of F2L, why you would even want to learn all those techniques you
        describe, they just want to get faster. So learning F2L algorithms, and
        fast ones at that, by rote, is the quickest way to achieve this. When I
        first learned F2L, I did it from a printable page on Ron's website, and
        I think also Peter Jansen's tricks. It took some weeks, but I got there
        in the end, with brute force. But that hasn't stopped me, some years
        down the line, and with a lot more experience and appreciation for the
        finer parts of the F2L, completely understanding how all F2L algorithms
        work, knowing a lot of shortcuts, choosing the easiest pairs, etc etc.
        And if I hadn't learned the algorithms in the first place, I doubt I
        ever would have gained so much understanding! Dan H :)

        Hi Ryan, &gt; But if you design a competition in the way you are
        suggesting, then luck &gt; is playing too much &gt; a part, and a less
        skilled competitor may well beat a more skilled &gt; competitor, simply
        by being given the gift of easier cases than everyone &gt; else. Yes, I
        agree. Additionally, you only consider a single competition. If you look
        at regional records instead of competitions, then we still have the case
        that you mention. How do we compare to other sports/hobbies where each
        competition is different? I am not thinking of: - different weather
        conditions and altitude Speed skating world records are generally broken
        inside, at high altitude like Calgary and Salt Lake City. - different
        pressure WC final is much harder than a local competition, for several
        reasons (better competition, more media, bigger audience, more to win,
        ...). - different environment/equipment Formula I tracks and itineraries
        for cycling are very different. Soccer pitches. Lighting. - home/away
        advantage I haven't found hobbies/sports where a similar thing like a
        scramble is used that is the same per competition, but different for
        different competitions. At least not where still the regional records
        are recognised. Anyone? Sorry to steal the thread. I just think
        speedcubing is more a "fight" against yourself than against others. Or a
        "fight" outside the competition, more global. It is not like tennis,
        where you influence your opponent continuously. Have fun, Ron -----

        As N increases, the &gt; probability that one competitor will get 3 easy

        becomes very high. &gt; &gt; Let's just look at the memorisation part,
        and imagine a competition &gt; where you are timed to see how fast you
        can memorise three random &gt; bitfields. &gt; &gt; If each competitor
        gets DIFFERENT random bitfields, then with a large &gt; number of
        competitors it becomes more likely that one competitor might &gt; get
        three easy cases like 1111011110, ... while another competitor might
        &gt; get three more difficult cases like 101001101, ... We know that the

        being given the same cases. Then even &gt; if the cases are easier than
        normal, then everyone still gets the same &gt; advantage equally(*).
        &gt; &gt; I actually have some data which I could look at some day, in
        the &gt; multi-player simulator: &gt; &gt;
        http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/speed/ &gt; &gt; I have recorded every
        scramble and every solve since the game first &gt; started up, and I
        would be able to run some pretty graphs on it. In this &gt; game, the
        two competitors who are racing are always given the same &gt; scramble.
        I have noticed that often two competitors who are equally &gt; matched
        will get around the same times as each other, and then suddenly &gt;
        they will BOTH get very good times on the same scramble. Then other &gt;
        times tey will suddenly BOTH get very bad times on the same scramble.
        &gt; There are exceptions, but from observations it seems that both &gt;
        competitors are generally going up and down at the same time. &gt; &gt;

        to &gt; aim for a minimum level of entropy &gt; &gt; -- &gt; Ryan Heise

        of their competitions, or we could hold a few sanctioned memory sports
        events at one of our competitions. Say speed cards, speed numbers, names
        and faces, things like that. I don't know if holding a speed cards event
        at a Rubik's competition would draw memory competitors. I sure would
        attend a memory sports competition if they held a WCA sanctioned BLD
        event though. I would even try the memory events just for fun. Do the
        WCA regulations even allow the running of an officially sanctioned speed
        cards event at a Rubik's competition? This is of course assuming we
        followed all the memory sports rules of what is required for a
        sanctioned speed cards event. Could I do that at an event I organize in
        my area? Or would this somehow make it harder to get WCA sanctioning for

        Hello, I tend to agree with you. I think there is nothing wrong in
        learning algorithms from a 'sheet'. I heard about cubers that learned
        F2L intuitively that basically had a delay between pairing up and
        inserting the pair. It has advantages to learn this in one fluent
        motion. I do highly recommend using your intuition during the learning
        process though. Knowing and understanding how the F2L algs move the
        pieces around allows you to solve the pairs from all angles, which is
        important if you want to speed up. - Jo√´l. --- In

        &gt; cases mechanically anyway (even though they started &gt;
        intuitively) &gt; &gt; Take commutators for example; there seems to be
        an &gt; agreement that this is an excellent function in &gt; solving for
        bld (though it has at least one other &gt; practical application in

        faster every time because I don't waste &gt; time for intuition, which
        is ultimately a poor &gt; investment in speedcubing IMO. &gt; &gt;
        Obviously there is going to be intuition involved in &gt; the F2L on

        &gt; At least not where still the regional records are recognised. &gt;
        Anyone? &gt; &gt; Sorry to steal the thread. I just think speedcubing is
        more a "fight" &gt; against yourself than against others. Or a "fight"
        outside the competition, &gt; more global. It is not like tennis, where
        you influence your opponent &gt; continuously. Sure, it is not like
        Tennis, but I think it is very much like running, swimming and
        cross-country skiing. In those sports, competitors are always trying to
        improve their personal bests, yes, but at competition there is the
        additional excitement of using your skill to actually win a race.
        Speedcubing is entirely compatible with a "racing" type of sport. In
        each race, the landscape may be different, but all competitors in the
        race share the same landscape, and so the winner is fairly selected. In
        our sport, the landscape is the scramble. -- Ryan Heise

        Hi Ryan, &gt; If you have won more &gt; major competitions than anyone

        Speedcubing is entirely compatible with a "racing" type of sport. Except
        for the fact that there are easy scrambles and lucky cases, with easy
        and lucky depending on your solving method/style. Also, most sports with
        different conditions (like marathon) do not have an official world

        we still have the case &gt;&gt; that &gt;&gt; you mention. &gt; &gt; In
        a race, the main point is "who is the winner". Of course, record &gt;
        times will go down in history and be remembered, too, but they are a

        real way to compare the results of different competitions in the &gt;
        short term is to just observe "who is the winner". If you have won more
        &gt; major competitions than anyone else, then you are the best. &gt;
        &gt; &gt;&gt; How do we compare to other sports/hobbies where each

        &gt;&gt; - different weather conditions and altitude &gt;&gt; Speed
        skating world records are generally broken inside, at high altitude

        &gt;&gt; WC final is much harder than a local competition, for several
        reasons &gt;&gt; (better competition, more media, bigger audience, more
        to win, ...). &gt;&gt; - different environment/equipment &gt;&gt;
        Formula I tracks and itineraries for cycling are very different. Soccer
        &gt;&gt; pitches. Lighting. &gt;&gt; - home/away advantage &gt;&gt;

        Hi Michael, In the past I considered the following options: 1) place
        competitors in a waiting area where they are separated from videos and
        other people. 2) give different scrambles to all competitors 3) give
        different scrambles to different groups of competitors, only in
        preliminary rounds 4) give the same scrambles to all competitors, but in
        random order 5) give the same scrambles to all competitors, but add a
        random move (or more) 6) have different scrambles per solve (of a round)
        and select a random one per competitor I never considered your solution.
        It does have flaws, because it doesn't solve the worst threat (my
        opinion) of someone knowing the scramble (f.e. by video analysis) and
        setting an incredible time with that knowledge. Considering the way we
        run competitions now. For small competitions all competitors have the
        same scrambles. There is little time in between competitors. For first
        rounds of big competitions, we divide the competitors into groups, with
        different groups having different scrambles. For second rounds and
        finals of big competitions all competitors have the same scrambles.
        Again there is little time in between competitors. So basically there is
        always a small advantage, but the time is limited. The current solution
        I think suits best and also deals with the lack of judges/scramblers
        problem. It is not perfect though. Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message

        2007 5:13 AM Subject: [Speed cubing group] Solving order within a round
        I had an idea about the order that people solve in a round; this might
        be useful for future record attempts as well as to curb possible
        cheating. The idea is to 'seed' the competitors. The competitors would
        be ranked in order of their best time in contest, and then the
        competitors would go in order of speed, either from fastest to slowest
        or vice versa. Tied competitors would proceed in a random but previously
        decided order, and competitors who haven't done the event in competition
        yet would go last (again in a random order, or perhaps decided by their
        unofficial record). If you have the fastest people go first, there will
        be less opportunity for cheating (since it is the fastest people who get
        more benefit from cheating, they are given less time in which to observe
        solves) and the fast people could help with scrambling and judging, but
        by about halfway through an event very few people would be watching
        since all of the really fast people had already gone. If you have the
        slowest people go first, people are encouraged to keep watching, and
        there is more of an opportunity for people who are not necessarily the
        fastest in the competition to break existing records, but on the other
        hand the fast people would have a ton of time to cheat (if they wanted
        to). Again, I don't know if this will be useful, but it may be
        worthwhile to organize the competitors in an event in some order other
        than random.

        that luck plays less a part and the solver is more in control of the

        do several laps of swimming out from the beach to a floating buoy some
        distance out from shore, and then swim back to shore, taking advantage
        of the ever changing surf conditions. The lower-end competitors
        sometimes have some luck and manage to catch the right wave at the right
        time, but luck plays less of a part in the performance of the experts,
        since they invariably end up in the lead by being better able to take
        advantage of whatever random conditions are thrown at them. So yes, they
        can have lucky waves, or unlucky waves, which is similar to lucky cases
        and unlucky cases. So, it is compatible with racing. I don't think we
        have any "grandmasters" in our sport yet, but if we did have them, I'm
        sure they would be hindered less by unlucky cases and find a way to take
        advantage of whatever situation was thrown at them. It is still possible
        that someone can win with a lot of luck, just as in many other sports.

        Hi guys, The following is an issue in the current WCA regulations for
        Fewest moves. E2e) The solution of the competitor must not be in any way
        related to the scrambling algorithm. Penalty: disqualification of the
        solve. There is no way to objectively decide whether this is the case.
        (Except for the obvious cases of course...) So we are looking for a
        scramble method that fits the following requirements: - gives random
        scrambles (comparable to current quality) - scrambles are 40 or more
        moves long (to prevent someone just undoing the moves) - is easy to
        execute without making mistakes (so preferrably contains a lot of
        repeating moves) One example would be: A 4 random moves of 4 random
        different sides B 4 times (4 random moves of 4 random different sides) C
        4 random moves of 4 random different sides D 4 times (4 random moves of
        4 random different sides) of which 2 sides are the remaining sides of B
        No idea if this would give could quality though. Any other thoughts?

        Just a thought regarding the repeated moves, you would have to take care
        that your repeated moves didn't turn into a commutator affecting only a
        small number of pieces, or like I did in one competition, generate a
        repeating set that in effect did nothing to the cube (you could have
        left it out and still got the same scramble). When generating them, you
        would also have to be clever in not generating repeating sets such as (R
        U R')*n because that is of course only U*n That is of course, all
        assuming you went down the route of repeating moves, as used in the
        first Fewest Moves Scrambles in the (was it CFF?) magazine. Regarding
        the quality of the scrambles, I don't have the know-how (and from what I
        have read about the standard speedcubing scrambles on here lately it's
        not an easy subject) to give any advice here, but I'm sure other more

        This is a common debate (not surprisingly), and it's worthwhile for
        beginners to hear. At the speedsolving level, of course, both
        memorization and intuitiveness become mechanical anyway. The difference
        doesn't lie there. Intuitive solving reinforces this community as one of
        thinkers rather than one of robots, and it implies a continuing
        evolution of methodology. On 5/11/07, Jo√´l van Noort &lt;joel_vn@...&gt;

        agree with you. I think there is nothing wrong in learning &gt;
        algorithms from a 'sheet'. I heard about cubers that learned F2L &gt;
        intuitively that basically had a delay between pairing up and &gt;
        inserting the pair. It has advantages to learn this in one fluent &gt;
        motion. &gt; &gt; I do highly recommend using your intuition during the
        learning &gt; process though. Knowing and understanding how the F2L algs
        move the &gt; pieces around allows you to solve the pairs from all
        angles, which is &gt; important if you want to speed up. &gt; &gt; -

        It is a terrible misconception that learning the F2L &gt; &gt;
        intuitively is absolutely better. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Through repetition
        most 'fast' speedcubers execute F2L &gt; &gt; cases mechanically anyway
        (even though they started &gt; &gt; intuitively) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Take commutators for example; there seems to be an &gt; &gt; agreement
        that this is an excellent function in &gt; &gt; solving for bld (though
        it has at least one other &gt; &gt; practical application in FMC). &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; Take any corner or edge subset, allow me time to match
        &gt; &gt; commutators with my own mechanical alg set. In &gt; &gt;
        execution I am faster every time because I don't waste &gt; &gt; time
        for intuition, which is ultimately a poor &gt; &gt; investment in
        speedcubing IMO. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Obviously there is going to be
        intuition involved in &gt; &gt; the F2L on some level, but the 41 cases
        need not be &gt; &gt; understood. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some years ago the
        consensus was that solving for one &gt; &gt; primary color was the best
        approach, yet dual solving &gt; &gt; becomes more common and proves
        itself very well. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        I don't like repeating scramble moves. That makes it more complicated

        Hi :-) I have coded a scrambler that has repeating parts and different
        patterns like say : part-repeated part - part - repeated part - part It
        is coded such that there is guaranteed no redundancy. It doesn't exactly
        match the suggestion with a minimal number of layers used in each
        repeating part. I wrote it for the FMC and it was used for quite a
        while, before dan switched back to straight 25-turn scrambles again. If
        there's any interest i will be able to share it with others, and/or
        modify it further. Then someone could generate a set scrambles with it
        and check (somehow) whether the scrambles are good enough. Possible
        criteria: - find optimal solutions and make sure the optimal solution is
        say &gt; 17 turns - No obvious easy starts (subjective) regardless if
        optimal solution is ok. - No obvious bias towards using any layer more
        than any other etc etc ... -Per &gt; --- In

        I don't know the rules for this, so I'd like to ask. Sometimes, it
        seems, StackMat timers (especially older generation 2 timers) can stop
        at a time one second greater than the actual time. So when the time
        should be 26.99 or 27.00 it may say 27.99 instead. This hasn't happened
        to me on my StackMat timer, but I've seen it on my digital stopwatch and
        I know it's happened to other people. Now here's the thing. Normally,
        you can't really tell if a solve that ends up displaying xx.99 should be
        that time or one second less, unless you had judges carefully watching
        the timer (which is totally impractical). But in very short events, that
        one second can be both easily detectable and important. Specifically,
        I'm thinking of the Magic. If a competitor does the Magic in 0.99
        seconds (which will become more and more likely in the future), but the
        timer says 1.99 seconds, it is generally easy for both the judge and the
        solver to see that the solve did not take two seconds. Although (to my
        knowledge) this has never happened in competition, I am worried that it
        may happen, and I'd like to know how it would be dealt with. My fastest
        Magic solves are around 1.00 second, and there is a competition in two
        weeks (where I will be trying primarily for a good single solve) that I
        will be going to, so this concerns me a great deal...

        Ah! I was just looking for 1.9x in the database. Thanks, Tim. Actually,
        for that video, it looks like the time was officially recorded as 3.96,
        not the 2.96 that it probably should be. I know that no video or
        photographic evidence is allowed for tournaments, but in this case I
        think that it would be very useful to let the judges make their
        decision. If someone happens to be taping a Magic or Master Magic solve
        where this occurs, I think that it would be very important to be sure of
        the time of the solve (especially since one second is a very large
        'penalty' for those events).

        &gt; &gt; Stefan &gt; Hmm, I didn't think of that. I'll admit that this
        is pure speculation, but I'm betting it was the +1 error. My only bit of
        "evidence" is that the last time you can see before he stops the timer
        is 2.93, which makes it seem like 2.96 is approximately the right time.
        Though the fact that he got two 2.96's in a row certainly makes the
        other possibility possible. I'm not sure how the stackmat works entirely
        and thus have no authority to judge what is possible and what isn't, but
        for some reason the "forgetting" explanation doesn't seem all that
        likely to me. Tim

        I think Stefan is referring to a more internal error, such as the timer
        itself failing to "get rid" of the old time. Then, when the timer
        stopped, it already had a time stored as the ending time, which it

        I'd like to ask. &gt; &gt; Sometimes, it seems, StackMat timers
        (especially older generation 2 &gt; timers) can stop at a time one
        second greater than the actual time. So &gt; when the time should be
        26.99 or 27.00 it may say 27.99 instead. This &gt; hasn't happened to me
        on my StackMat timer, but I've seen it on my &gt; digital stopwatch and
        I know it's happened to other people. &gt; &gt; Now here's the thing.
        Normally, you can't really tell if a solve that &gt; ends up displaying
        xx.99 should be that time or one second less, &gt; unless you had judges
        carefully watching the timer (which is totally &gt; impractical). But in
        very short events, that one second can be both &gt; easily detectable
        and important. &gt; &gt; Specifically, I'm thinking of the Magic. If a
        competitor does the &gt; Magic in 0.99 seconds (which will become more
        and more likely in the &gt; future), but the timer says 1.99 seconds, it
        is generally easy for &gt; both the judge and the solver to see that the
        solve did not take two &gt; seconds. Although (to my knowledge) this has
        never happened in &gt; competition, I am worried that it may happen, and
        I'd like to know how &gt; it would be dealt with. &gt; &gt; My fastest
        Magic solves are around 1.00 second, and there is a competition &gt; in
        two weeks (where I will be trying primarily for a good single &gt;
        solve) that I will be going to, so this concerns me a great deal... &gt;

        &gt; And what was the time immediately before that one? Different from
        &gt; 1.97? &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan You raise an interesting point,
        but I don't think it's a case of the StackMat forgetting to record a
        result and instead displaying a previous one that just happens to be one
        second off. The main reason is because this hasn't been reported for any
        times that weren't within 0.1 second of a whole number of seconds. I
        don't see how something that only occurs right before a whole number of
        seconds and only replaces a time with another time that is almost
        exactly 1 second more can happen, unless it was deliberately programmed
        in. If it was an inadvertent bug (and if you trust the StackMat guys you
        have to assume it was), where one time was replaced with the previous
        one, the actual time would not be an issue - there's nothing special
        about x.9x times except that they are right before the second, which
        wouldn't affect memory errors, just timing errors. Besides, I've seen
        this on my stopwatch as well, and I can say for certain that on my
        stopwatch it is doing a +1 timing error and not replacing it with a
        previous time (since the error result is almost never the same as the
        previous time).

        For basic CFOP this is true. But because some people (extremely rare
        exceptions, but there are at least a few) don't want to be robots, they
        learn new things like X-cross or block building. This would be much
        harder if they had just memorized the "41 F2L algs" instead of doing it
        intuitively. And if X-cross becomes mechanical and too easy, just move
        on to double X-cross. There are always new things to learn, speedcubing
        doesn't need to mechanical. When I hear questions like "Where can I find
        the algorithms for the extended cross method?", or when someone knows
        2-look LL even though he/she averages above a minute, it makes me very
        sad. I wish there were more cubing sites that weren't just lists of
        algorithms for Fridrich. Beginners too often get the idea that
        speedcubing is just about memorization. I started practising Petrus
        almost 2 years ago, but 2x2x3 block isn't mechanical for me yet. And I
        don't want it to be. &gt; Intuitive solving reinforces this community as
        one of thinkers rather &gt; than one of robots, &gt; and it implies a
        continuing evolution of methodology. This is a very good point, too. But

        in a while, and it might be 'behind' on the actual time. Could this have
        something to do with it? Or not? (Just thinking out loud here... An

        Hello everybody, Yesterday evening I found an OLL algorithm that might
        be new... Well, some may know it, but I have never seen it. It is a
        variation of F RU'R'U'RUR' F'. It solves one of the 'knight move'
        shapes. Do the inverse or the move 3 times to setup: F U RU2R' U' RUR'
        F' F with right index, U with right ring. U2 with right index going all
        the way from BRU to FLU, without letting go of the cube with the right
        hand. As I always do before switching an OLL, I carefully investigate if
        it's a wise thing to do :). I timed my old algorithm and this one
        without a few times rushing, but just with a nice pace. The new
        algorithm is definately faster and quite consistent. Other advantages:
        No cube rotations... Also, some 'blocks' of pieces in the LL stay
        together during the algorithm. This can help PLL recognition during
        execution. I see that as a plus. - Jo√´l. PS: I also found another alg,
        but I am not swithching for that one: R'U2RU y' x' RU'R'F RUR'.

        Hi Jo√Ø¬ø¬Ωl, In the case of Bob it is proven beyond doubt that there was a
        timer malfunction. We got a free replacement of the timer. But there
        could be an internal bug. Because the timer showed exactly the same time
        as the previous time, it might have been an error situation where the
        last time was shown again. Yes, the display is slightly behind, but my
        experience is that it is never more than .2 behind. In Bob's case it was
        a full second. And we did see the start of the solve. If someone would
        sell products that have a rare bug in it, then they could (not saying
        they are) silently solve it in new versions of the product. That is why
        I am interested whether the same problem occurs in the new version with
        the save option. I searched Google with keywords like "stackmat" and
        "malfunction" and found nothing but speedcubing info. Funnily most of
        the sites with a hit on the word "stackmat" are about cubing. :-) Have
        fun, Ron ----- Original Message ----- From: "Jo√Ø¬ø¬Ωl van Noort"

        Timer malfunctions Hello, I also think there are other explanations. In
        this video, we can't see the start of the solve, but I think that
        matters as well. I heard that the timer display (the big one at least)
        updates every once in a while, and it might be 'behind' on the actual
        time. Could this have something to do with it? Or not? (Just thinking
        out loud here... An important lesson I learned is that 1 observation
        never has only 1 explanation ;)). - Jo√Ø¬ø¬Ωl. --- In

        I also use an algorithm (much like the inverse of the T permutation) for
        this case which I have not seen anywhere else before: F U R U' R2 F' R U

        these timer malfunctions that I think we need to talk about. We've
        established that some StackMats have this bug some of the time. So what

        Hi :-) Those applets are really really cool. I especially appreciate the
        guidelines showing what parts of the puzzles would be turned by clicking
        when moving the cursor over the polyhedra. Most computer simulations i
        have seen are a bit confusing wrt what layers will be turned when
        clicking various places. One suggestion though, how about merging all
        those applets into one? I bet they all share the same core engine
        anyway, at least within each family. Welcome to the forum :-) Signing up

        I am very interested! This looks like it has great potential. There are
        a few things I'd like to ask or request: - Could you please add a puzzle
        like the Megaminx but with one additional, shallower face-turn axis (the
        "Gigaminx")? - Could you change the colors on some of the puzzles (the
        cubes would be the most important) to more closely resemble Rubik's Cube
        colors, or allow the user to change the colors for given types of
        polyhedra? - How about tetrahedron puzzles? Those can be interesting. -
        Have you seen the "Helicopter Cube"
        (http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6253)? I think that that
        would be a good addition to your library. - Would it be possible, for
        some puzzles, to allow drag-drop turns, where you drag from one sticker
        to another to turn a slice? I imagine that for the less complicated
        puzzles this would be unambiguous most of the time. - I don't understand
        what makes a turn be clockwise and what makes it be counterclockwise.
        Could you explain how this works? - Could you make the divisions between
        the pieces smaller? It's sometimes hard to see the very small pieces.

        Hi, Just while we are talking about lubing bigger cubes, it's quite
        tough to lube a 5x5 using this method, because if you took out 3
        adjacent edge pieces, the likelihood is that more pieces of the cube
        will fall out, and it can get pretty frustrating. For the 5x5x5, I would
        recommend turning the top layer at 45 degrees to the next layer down,
        that layer 45 degrees to the layer beneath that, etc etc, and the put a
        drop of lube on each exposed part of the internal layer. Then turn it to
        rub the lube in. Repeat by turning layers on a different axis if
        necessary. All the best, Dan :) --- In

        Yes, different methods will have roughly the same amount of face moves,
        but if doing a slice move as face turns instead you also need to do a
        cube rotation... Double-layers moves are more tricker than single-layer
        moves when executed with feets (at least when using my feets...) /Anders

        Well, of course, Ron ;-) One possibility can be that the scrambled cube
        is given electronically in a program like the FMC Cube Companion (as
        found at Dan Harris' FMC site) with the scramble algorithm deleted, and
        the competitor uses this program to find his solution. If going for
        this, however, the organiser must provide computers for the
        competitors... /Anders --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        i own 3 different Gen 2 timers. One has a data port bought straight from

        /Anders Well, you could have a judge at the front scramble all of the
        cubes before the event and then rescramble anyone's cube(s) when they
        come up to ask. Or you could scramble every cube at the beginning, and
        then just give the competitors a sheet with a picture of the scramble.
        But both of these would slow the competitors down a lot, and it's
        already hard to come up with a good solution within an hour.

        Hi :-) A time.limited fewest moves with a picture and no scramble given
        will be more an exercise in "state-reproduction" than actually solving
        the position. I thik this defeats the object of fewest moves
        competitions. Yes, long scrambles will prevent abusing the scramble
        somehow. However, for fewest moves as well as for normal spedsolving i
        don't really see the problem in allowing random scrambles that MAY be
        below average complexity. Why have this added restriction only for
        fewest moves and not normal speedsolving. I don't agree with that :-)
        Personally i do like repeated parts in scrambles, makes it easier to set
        it up. Stefan if you find that hard then just practice it. You learnt
        counting in first grade at school ;-) It's easy to prevent reduction
        problems with repeated parts!! -Per &gt; --- In

        Hi everybody, Thank you for your comments. I really didn't expect so
        much favorable responses. It's already a great success for me. I'm sorry
        that my applet caused a crash for some of you. I should have warned that
        I didn't test on non-Windows platform Basically it should work on Mac,
        Linux and Solaris too, because my applet doesn't include any native
        codes. If other applets using JOGL(JAVA OpenGL), for example
        https://jogl-demos.dev.java.net/applettest.html invoke the same crash,
        the cause is very probably at JOGL side. Unfortunately I have no way to
        verify at this moment. Answering some of your questions: &gt;- I don't
        understand what makes a turn be clockwise and what makes it &gt;be
        counterclockwise. Could you explain how this works? Generally, left
        button is for counter-clockwise and right-button for clockwise twist.
        Except: if you clicked on a edge piece of a cube, left button turns the
        inner slice toward the direction of screen (just as you pushed it really
        with your finger) and right button makes the opposite. Is it confusing?
        I thought it's more intuitional... I will continue to improve my work
        consulting your suggestions. Thanks a lot, Paul the Gelatinbrain

        Shelley, a little harsh there? I count "Idiot" level on the punctuation.
        I liked that point most. It's not like Tyson's busy at all or anything.
        He should just "solv" the man's F2L. He should also use his magical
        powers to know what the problem is and what the F2L looks like at this
        very moment. I'm just kidding Shelley. Well handled, but I was expecting

        Maybe we would either consider helping you if you weren't so naive. What
        difference does it make from getting help from Tyson Mao or another
        speedcuber? don't say he is a professional since i'm sure that he does
        not get paid to speedcube. We don't need people like you in the

        Hi :-) My guess is that since the applets use JOGL it has more to do
        with the hardware if the applet is not working or crashing. I don't
        really think it's OS/Browser related. But i could be wrong :D -Per &gt;

        really didn't expect so much favorable responses. &gt; It's already a
        great success for me. &gt; &gt; I'm sorry that my applet caused a crash
        for some of you. &gt; I should have warned that I didn't test on
        non-Windows platform &gt; Basically it should work on Mac, Linux and
        Solaris too, &gt; because my applet doesn't include any native codes.
        &gt; If other applets using JOGL(JAVA OpenGL), for example &gt;
        https://jogl-demos.dev.java.net/applettest.html &gt; invoke the same
        crash, &gt; the cause is very probably at JOGL side. &gt; Unfortunately
        I have no way to verify at this moment. &gt; &gt; Answering some of your
        questions: &gt; &gt; &gt;- I don't understand what makes a turn be
        clockwise and what makes it &gt; &gt;be counterclockwise. Could you
        explain how this works? &gt; &gt; Generally, left button is for
        counter-clockwise and right-button for &gt; clockwise twist. &gt;
        Except: if you clicked on a edge piece of a cube, &gt; left button turns
        the inner slice toward the direction of screen &gt; (just as you pushed
        it really with your finger) and right button makes the &gt; opposite.
        &gt; Is it confusing? I thought it's more intuitional... &gt; &gt; I
        will continue to improve my work consulting your suggestions. &gt; &gt;

        Hi everyone, I have done a bit of hacking to make a "forum"-style
        interface to this Yahoo! group: http://oosan.ryanheise.com/ This means
        that all of us who prefer to read our messages via email, and all of the
        rest who prefer to use forums can now happily coexist :-) Well, it is
        not perfect yet... For example, I am not displaying the date of any of
        the messages, but I will get around to that eventually. Yes, you can
        even use your own "avatar" through Gravatar: http://site.gravatar.com/ A
        few other points: - At the moment, I am only keeping the 20 most recent
        threads due to disk space limitations, and for older threads I provide a
        link back to the Yahoo! groups archive. - My program will try to chop
        off excessive quotes, particularly bottom quotes. Top quotes are left
        intact, though, because these are usually more selectively chosen by the
        author and therefore more relevant to the post. - The code uses all
        sorts of tricks and I would be surprised if it works in any browser I
        haven't tested. So far, I have only tested Firefox on Linux and IE6
        (under WINE on Linux). -- Ryan Heise http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/

        http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html In the case of
        the last forum (petrusmethod), it is set up so that you can't view the
        messages from the outside unless you join the group. There is probably a
        case here, but I'll let Lars say whether he wants me to remove this
        forum from my interface. I hope Lars doesn't mind, since I think it
        would be useful to be able to read all 4 forums side by side. The first
        three forums are public mailing lists (the content is written and owned
        by us, and is implicitly shared with everyone) and this is generally ok.
        There are several examples of other services which provide public
        archives of mailing lists (including Yahoo!'s eGroups mailing lists) on
        the internet, including: http://www.mail-archive.com/ http://gmane.org/
        This group (speedsolvingrubikscube) is actually archived on both of
        those services.

        I guess about 1 month's work, with a number of technical challenges (as

        do state that we may not reproduce (i.e. copy) their material, but the
        material in question is not owned by Yahoo! and therefore falls outside
        of their rights on material. To possibly make you feel a little more
        comfortable, we would be free, for example, to move to another mailing

        the people who missed it, Craig's episode aired tonight, and it was
        really good. He did a speed solve which was 16.xx, and then did a
        blindfold solve which was just over 3 minutes. They didn't show the
        entire memorization and execution, of course. But they just kept
        skipping ahead, with the time constantly showing so viewers knew it was
        being edited for time. But his cubing was not the only good thing. He
        answered questions well, and represented cubing like a pro.
        Congratulations, Craig. The question will be when can we get a video of
        it? If we do, it will be available on http://www.canadiancubing.com but
        i don't suspect it will be in the coming days. Great job, Craig! -Dave

        as for me, I recomment otherwise. Unless you are a pro of such things, I
        do NOT recommend you to do this. You could suffer from bad and
        irreparable injuries and burns not just on your hands but all over your
        body if something bad happens. As you know, gasoline is quite dangerous.

        Instead of gasoline i might consider using some petroleum jelly which
        would burn quiet well but without the necessary explosive start. Gilles

        cubing yea get video of it I think all of us would like to see it. If I
        were you and had a crappy cube laying around test it to see how long it
        takes for the cube to melt and how high the flames get, for some reason
        gas tends to burn really good. Who knew cubing could be so dangerous.

        hey, i've been watching a few youtube videos on the 4x4, and i noticed
        that they never get caught even when they move so fast. I on the other
        hand get caught every 2 seconds (even after lubing my cube). So I was
        just wondering, is there a specific way to hold the cube and preform
        moves to keep from getting caught? also my cube is a Rubik's if that has
        anything to do with it. Russ

        no secret trick, just practice and experience. the 4x4x4 solvers on
        youtube are most likely not beginners. practice turning them slower and
        practicing lining up the sides perfectly at first. will more time you
        will get better and it will be easier for you to turn fast without
        getting the cubes stuck on each other. same goes for all cubes.

        Hi everyone, I had an interesting thought tonight and wanted to ask
        about it. Obviously for a layer-by-layer method it makes intuitive sense
        to refer to the "first two layers", but how coined the actual acronym
        "F2L" that we've all come to know and love? I just realized that I
        really don't know the answer to this question. Thanks, Chris

        If you know a few things about commuters, then I suppose one could
        "intuitively" solve the second layer. http://www.solvethecube.co.uk/ has
        a nice tutorial about commuters. On 5/16/07, Omi Castanar

        Uh, I rarely check this group, but man, seriously this is one of the
        dumbest things I've heard about. Gasoline is really toxic, and it will
        produce very bad fumes for you. I burned gasoline for a chemistry

        Hi all, Below is a link to my first solve in the finals of the latest
        Rutgers tournament (many thanks to Bruce Norskog for the clip). I got a
        chance to chat with the judge (I don't remember his name) during the
        tournament and he was a pretty cool guy but he needed a refresher in how
        to judge at just the wrong time! In his defense, I'm the one that
        trained him so it's my fault. Anyway, I think the beginning of the video
        is pretty funny.

        well i guess its just practice from there. top down is extremely
        important (in my opinion) to getting faster. this allows you to see
        moves and cubie placement in advance and not have to pause between
        algorithms to turn the cube over and look for your next move. notice
        this may cause you to re-learn alot of the algorithms upside down from
        what you are used to. take learning top down slow and work on finding
        shortcuts (finger tricks, etc.) to the algorithms. brain dead and cant
        think of anything else right now. jeff

        Hi, Average is around 14.07 seconds... That's based on 100 cubes. I

        In my opinion the C in CFOP is there just to indicate how to start F2L.
        The F2L still means solving the first 2 layers (with all it's cubies -
        including the cross). It is then easily deduced that step 2 is equal to
        solving those 4 famous c/e pairs. If Chris had asked what the F in CFOP
        means i agree it's the completion of F2L excluding the cross ;-) Anyway,
        this is now semantical nitpicking ;-) -Per &gt; --- In

        Here is a new tip I have worked on is R-OLL(Recognition during OLL), the
        deal is to look at the corner scheme before doing OLL, in order to
        anticipate the corner scheme after OLL. Now I apply this with about 20%
        of OLL's and save about 0.5-1s on my average times. I recommend this
        first to sub-20 cubers, because you should be very used to OLL and PLL
        to do this. Because of the way I worked my OLL, all identical schemes
        are placed identically(for example I place the two "thunder" OLL with
        the same pattern), and for PLL too. For all PLL of what I call the B
        type(A,T,J,R,G,F) I place the 2 correctly place corners on the L side.
        Then then R-OLL is perfectly adapted to my system. I recommend to start
        with OLL's with all oriented edges to get used to the tip. Enjoy it.

        Normally, I don't propose things -I find a way to do them. But I think
        this this a really good idea (that I'm pretty sure hasn't been suggested
        before), though I'm not capable of implementing it. Anyhow, the idea
        would be to create a browser extension (I would like it for Firefox :-)
        that allows a user to highlight an algorithm in a text and animate (or
        display the result of) the alg in a new tab. AnimCube (my preference) or
        Randelshofer's applet can be employed for this. It would look something
        like this: http://archive.garron.us/img/algclick.png And then open a new
        page, like this: http://archive.garron.us/img/algnewpage.png (here with
        an FMC helper page as an example display applet) Some ideas: It would be
        nice if the applet page were stored on the hard drive (so that this
        works offline). And that it could take blablabla/alganim.htm#alggoeshere
        and display the "alggoeshere". And if it had preconfigurable and
        adjustable options in a panel on the page. And so on with nice
        features... It's just an idea, and this is the best place to throw out
        those ideas. If anyone would want to do this (and knows how to), this
        list is the best way to perhaps reach such a person. --&gt; By the way,

        Hey Dan, Our paths may have crossed quite literally then. Actually to
        enjoy Koninginnedag I would have to have been there a day earlier. Now
        that day was just meeting my family and sleeping early. Anyway we had
        lots of fun. A thanks goes to Ron, Ton, Jaap for the effort of
        organizing a meeting and to Joel for visiting me in my home town. It's
        always fun to meet other cubers. I hope to meet you and Jasmine at some
        event in the future too, but unfortunately I will not be at Worlds this
        year. Michiel --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Dan"

        Also, I made this (the favelet) a long time ago and it might not work in
        more recent browsers. I am willing to give away the code as open source
        (hey it's javascript so anyone can steal it already). If you make an
        improved version let me know. I planned on making it available offline
        but never got to it. Also check out Charles Tsang's FMC helper, which is
        available as an offline program. Go to cubestation.co.uk to get it.

      <strong> 3405. [off topic] Universal parabolic constant proof </strong>

      <div class="email-content">
        Hi all you math people, I read about the universal parabolic constant on
        mathworld.wolfram.com and first off I thought it was amazing, and second
        off I wanted to try to construct a proof of it. I wanted to ask if I've
        done this correctly. What I did was as follows: I define a parabola to
        be any general function of the form f(x)=a*x^2+b*x+c where a,b,c and
        real numbers. Using the directrix as the equation : y=[-b^2+4ac-1]/(2a)
        and the focus as the point: ( -b/(2a) , [-b^2+4ac+1]/(2a) ) *and*
        additionally restricting the variable a to be a &gt; 0 I found the focal
        parameter to be: 1/(2a) For the arc length of the segment formed by the
        latus rectum I just used the following integral: integral from (-b-1)/2a
        to (-b+1)/2a of sqrt(1+(2ax+b)^2)dx This gave me a value of
        [sqrt(2)+ln(sqrt(2)+1)]/2a Taking the ratio of this arc length to the
        focal parameter gave me the desired constant of sqrt(2) + ln(sqrt(2)+1)
        To complete the proof I then let a &lt; 0 . In this case I said that I
        would instead look at the function: g(x)=-f(x) This gives me a new
        function g(x)=a'*x^2+b'*x+c' where a' &gt; 0 . By the previous part of
        the proof this parabola has the universal parabolic constant of: sqrt(2)
        + ln(sqrt(2)+1) Since the g(x) parabola was formed only by a reflection
        about the x axis of the original f(x) parabola with a &lt; 0 then the
        constant for the parabola g(x) is the same as for the parabola f(x) with
        a &lt; 0 . --------------- Have I done this correctly and rigorously
        enough? I have obviously left out the intermediate steps. My main
        question is does restricting a &gt; 0 and finding the constant for that
        general parabola, then solving the a &lt; 0 case by reflecting about the
        x axis count as a valid approach to this proof? Thanks, Chris

        wrote: &gt; &gt; Hi all you math people, &gt; &gt; I read about the
        universal parabolic constant on mathworld.wolfram.com &gt; and first off
        I thought it was amazing, and second off I wanted to try &gt; to
        construct a proof of it. &gt; &gt; I wanted to ask if I've done this
        correctly. What I did was as follows: &gt; &gt; I define a parabola to
        be any general function of the form &gt; f(x)=a*x^2+b*x+c where a,b,c
        and real numbers. &gt; &gt; Using the directrix as the equation : &gt;
        y=[-b^2+4ac-1]/(2a) &gt; &gt; and the focus as the point: &gt; ( -b/(2a)
        , [-b^2+4ac+1]/(2a) ) &gt; &gt; *and* additionally restricting the
        variable a to be a &gt; 0 I found the &gt; focal parameter to be: 1/(2a)
        &gt; &gt; For the arc length of the segment formed by the latus rectum I
        just &gt; used the following integral: &gt; &gt; integral from (-b-1)/2a
        to (-b+1)/2a of sqrt(1+(2ax+b)^2)dx &gt; &gt; This gave me a value of
        [sqrt(2)+ln(sqrt(2)+1)]/2a &gt; &gt; Taking the ratio of this arc length
        to the focal parameter gave me the &gt; desired constant of sqrt(2) +
        ln(sqrt(2)+1) &gt; &gt; To complete the proof I then let a &lt; 0 . In
        this case I said that I &gt; would instead look at the function: &gt;
        g(x)=-f(x) &gt; &gt; This gives me a new function &gt;
        g(x)=a'*x^2+b'*x+c' where a' &gt; 0 . By the previous part of the proof
        &gt; this parabola has the universal parabolic constant of: &gt; sqrt(2)
        + ln(sqrt(2)+1) &gt; &gt; Since the g(x) parabola was formed only by a
        reflection about the x &gt; axis of the original f(x) parabola with a
        &lt; 0 then the constant for &gt; the parabola g(x) is the same as for
        the parabola f(x) with a &lt; 0 . &gt; &gt; --------------- &gt; &gt;
        Have I done this correctly and rigorously enough? I have obviously &gt;
        left out the intermediate steps. My main question is does restricting
        &gt; a &gt; 0 and finding the constant for that general parabola, then
        solving &gt; the a &lt; 0 case by reflecting about the x axis count as a
        valid &gt; approach to this proof? &gt; &gt; Thanks, &gt; Chris &gt;

        is everyone else at? There are 5 of us going, and we are looking to find
        a good place to stay. It doesn't have to be too close, but as close as
        possible. We are hoping to find something under $120/night. If you know
        where you are staying, please list the site here. As far as
        transportation goes, what you are guys planning? Does anyone know if you
        can just "train" your way around town? I don't want to have to rent a
        car since they are so expensive... and hoping I can just walk and train.
        If anyone has any suggestions, comments, or ideas, please post. Thanks
        in advance for the help.

        Initially learned from Tyson, and taken nearly everything I know from

        times, my 1:39 from Idaho is far more realistic. Many of you are much
        faster than me, this solve was just very easy. I know it sounds arrogant
        to say this, and I don't mean it to be, but it should've been a lot
        faster. I'm out of practice and my memorization was rather slow, and my
        cube is in terrible shape (ask Craig). I think it could have easily been
        a 25/35 breakdown for a 60 second solve. Tyson and Leyan should have the
        credit, because without them as teachers and inspiration to improve,
        this wouldn't have happened. Thanks guys. And also thanks to Dave for

        I've been trying out Stefan Pochmann's method for solving the 3x3
        blindfolded the last couple of days. It's really easy, and I can get all
        the cubies where they need to go. But I'm having trouble memorizing the
        cube in such a way that all the cubies will end up oriented correctly.
        Is there anything I can do to help this?

        RM U2 RM' U2 RM I does not disturbe anything but the two deges and is
        pretty fast to do so I like it a lot =) Maybe it's possible to tweek it
        so you can use double layers, I have not tried, I'm into slices and does
        thoes as quickly as dbl layers so for me it's not nessesary. // Kenneth

        You'll have to memorize two different "keys" for each edge piece- for
        example, I'll use the blue and orange one. When blue is in the UL (top)
        position, I'll do d'L to turn that place where i want it to go into an
        easy t-perm. After the t-perm, do L'd to put that piece back where it
        is. On the other hand, if Orange is on top, simply do L' before the
        t-perm, reversing it with L at the end. You simply have to match up the
        top of one cubie with the correct orientation of the place you want it
        to go. I had a little trouble with this concept until I emailed Stefan-
        he proved to be a great help. I still have a little trouble with the
        corners, but it's coming along. btw I had fun making up the keys for
        memorization- OB is a frozen construction worker :-P ~Joshua --- In

        the most of a situation. And you did that. We can't go on about it would
        have been faster if someone faster was there to get the same scramble.
        We could do that for every record. Congratulations on your record, it
        was fantastic. Yes, we have it on video, and we will work to make it

        I had the same problem my Rubik 4x4x4 center piece broke and my Rubiks

        I am finding that my 4x4x4 Rubiks is starting to pop. It is well worked
        in and I am hesitant to part with it. I am getting a Eastsheen 5x5x5
        soon, hopefully I will see if it is better. Cannot help but better my
        times. Will probably get a Eastsheen 4x4x4 at some poin, if for nothing

        I know people complain when this sort of post comes up, saying we all
        need to just cut him some slack, but... Has anyone here recieved an
        order from CubeSmith placed on or after April 17th? A friend of mine
        needed to get some sticker replacements for his son, so I recommended
        CubeSmith. Now, he's getting kinda frustrated, since there has been no
        communication. When he placed his order (on April 17th), I also had him
        order a set of tiles for me and lets just say, my stickers are starting
        to get kinda bad. When we saw the 'news update' on Cubesmith, indicating
        that he hoped to be caught up by 5/9, we figured we could wait a while,
        but there hasn't been anything else, since then. If anyone (Chris at
        CubeSmith included) has any updates, it would be greatly appreciated -
        any word I can pass along would be helpful. - Grant --- Grant Tregay

        deserve the WR. Everyone else there had the same scramble, and no one
        came close. It is about having the ability to make the most of a
        situation. And you did that. We can't go on about it would have been
        faster if someone faster was there to get the same scramble. We could do
        that for every record. Congratulations on your record, it was fantastic.
        Yes, we have it on video, and we will work to make it available very
        soon. It has a fair amount of comedy involved, too. Chris is such a
        great guy that he didn't want to make a sound as everyone else was still
        doing their bld. So pictures a mime winning a WR, without the make up.
        Classic stuff. And let me take the opportunity to thank Chris for coming
        up and helping me out SO MUCH. It was unbelievable. He is a great guy.
        See you at US Open. -Dave Campbell

        &gt; We would love to see more foreigners to come this year. The &gt;
        venu is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great and it's easy to get there from
        Stockholm by local train. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stockholm is absolutly
        butiful in August. Why not combine a &gt; weeks &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        vacation in the town and the competition over the weekend? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The competition will also be great of
        course =) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone who plan to
        come? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; // Kenneth &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Eastsheen cubes are very fast out of the box, and often it's even better
        not to lube them (as they can get loose after a while). They are very
        stable - I've never had a piece break on my two-year-old Eastsheen
        5x5x5. But they cannot cut corners at all, so you have to be very
        careful to align the slices. Rubik/Studio cubes are slow out of the box,
        although they become faster when they are worn in and lubed. They aren't
        that stable, but if a piece breaks you can get another of the same piece
        from Cubesmith. They can cut corners very well due to their design,
        though. My advice is this: if you want a cube to play or practice with,
        or if you want to be fast but not necessarily world-class, get an
        Eastsheen. But if you want a cube to go extremely fast on, and you are
        willing to put a lot of time into that specific cube, get a Rubik or
        Studio cube. For illustration, my best 5x5x5 average is 2:30, on my
        Eastsheen, and I think I could do better on a good Rubik cube, but I
        don't have the time to wear one in to the point where it is better.

        today at school i was throwing my cube to my self as i ran home (ya i

        textured tiles because he hadn't been able to make any in quite a while.
        he was working on the batch when we spoke, but everything else is pretty
        much caught up, and the textured tile orders should be out soon. he's
        working on a tracking system that should eliminate most of the wondering

        some sticker replacements for his son, so I recommended CubeSmith. Now,
        he's getting kinda frustrated, since there has been no communication.
        When he placed his order (on April 17th), I also had him order a set of
        tiles for me and lets just say, my stickers are starting to get kinda
        bad. When we saw the 'news update' on Cubesmith, indicating that he
        hoped to be caught up by 5/9, we figured we could wait a while, but
        there hasn't been anything else, since then. If anyone (Chris at
        CubeSmith included) has any updates, it would be greatly appreciated -
        any word I can pass along would be helpful. - Grant --- Grant Tregay

        It sounds &gt; like orders should start flowing more freely again,

        It is mentioned in the rulings, in the part about a cube must be
        unambiguously solved. If you pop 4 caps all in the same slice this gives
        your cube 2 solutions, so the cube is no longer unambiguously solved. If
        you pop all 6 obviously your cube has now 12 solved positions so the
        cube is no longer unambiguously solved. If you pop 4 caps leaving 2
        adjacent faces still with caps this is ok however. Basically cap pops
        work like: 1 pop) still solved 2 pops anywhere) still solved 3 pops
        anywhere) still solved 4 pops) a) if all in one slice, not solved,
        counts as DNF b) if not all in once slice, still solved 5 pops) not
        solved, DNF 6 pops) not solved, DNF Chris --- In

        I would like some input to get faster and was hoping I get some help
        here. I currently solve the cube by doing the 4 corners, opposite 4
        corners, orient them all, fill in the edges of two opposite sides, then
        complete the middle slice. I "hold" the cube with my left hand and
        preform all the moves with my right hand - not the quickest way. I
        average under a minute but far from 30 seconds. In the mid-80's I
        averaged 38 seconds and had a best time of 23. I need to either change
        my method or learn some finger tricks. I don't want to be "World Class"
        but I do want to be faster. Any suggestions?

        Eastsheens are great, until they break. My sister (2 yrs old) threw my
        5x5 against the street, and it exploded. I was able to get all the

        Rubiks 4x4 was hard at first, but once I lubricated it, it worked great.

        Eastsheen cubes are very fast out of the box, and often it's even &gt;
        better not to lube them (as they can get loose after a while). They &gt;
        are very stable - I've never had a piece break on my two-year-old &gt;
        Eastsheen 5x5x5. But they cannot cut corners at all, so you have to be
        &gt; very careful to align the slices. &gt; &gt; Rubik/Studio cubes are
        slow out of the box, although they become &gt; faster when they are worn
        in and lubed. They aren't that stable, but &gt; if a piece breaks you
        can get another of the same piece from &gt; Cubesmith. They can cut
        corners very well due to their design, though. &gt; &gt; My advice is
        this: if you want a cube to play or practice with, or if &gt; you want
        to be fast but not necessarily world-class, get an Eastsheen. &gt; But
        if you want a cube to go extremely fast on, and you are willing to &gt;
        put a lot of time into that specific cube, get a Rubik or Studio cube.
        &gt; &gt; For illustration, my best 5x5x5 average is 2:30, on my
        Eastsheen, and &gt; I think I could do better on a good Rubik cube, but
        I don't have the &gt; time to wear one in to the point where it is
        better. &gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been

        but kills my OLL and PLL. And it seems to be wearing down at an
        extremely slow rate (still need effort to pop it). So if it were you
        would you use the DIY or wear down the old cube? And a side question.
        The first time you used Rubik's syringe lube, Did it like "BLow up" on
        you and make a really big mess?

        So I guess that along with Bert, Arne, Allan, and Bruno (, etc.), Sune
        could have been a natural name to occur to him. And given names are such
        a quaint idea for naming algs... -Lucas Garron &gt; &gt;From Wikipedia:
        &gt; The name (Sune) is believed to be a hybrid name with origins in the
        &gt; Dutch and local native dialects of South Africa. Its commonly
        accepted &gt; meaning is "Song of God" and is usually given to female
        children. &gt; &gt; What significance does the word "sune" have with
        respect to the &gt; orientation algorithm? &gt; Where did this come
        from?

        I think lots of fast cubers use DIY cubes. But as for me, I still use my
        first cube and after 2 years of speedcubing, it is in a remarquably good
        state. I think it all depends on the cubes you have. If you DIY is good
        for you, then use it. It not, then use another one. It is just a matter
        of preferences. Gilles 2007/5/24, Russell Co &lt;mt_highest@...&gt;:
        &gt; &gt; I was just wondering how long it takes for people to wear down
        their &gt; cubes because i have a DIY and my about 1 month old cube and
        i dont &gt; know which i should use. I like the old cube because it
        really helps &gt; the F2L but kills my OLL and PLL. And it seems to be
        wearing down at an &gt; extremely slow rate (still need effort to pop
        it). So if it were you &gt; would you use the DIY or wear down the old
        cube? &gt; &gt; And a side question. The first time you used Rubik's
        syringe lube, Did &gt; it like "BLow up" on you and make a really big
        mess? &gt; &gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been

        Yes, that is the scramble. If I may, how did you figure that out? All I
        could tell was that it was wrong. As you can see, though not lucky, it

        The scramble didn't seem too easy so I compared it to the cube in the
        video, and noticed that it's indeed different. Then I took some paper
        and a pen and started reconstructing the position from the video. Some
        faces were hard to see but it was doable. When I though I got it I
        compared it to the scramble and it didn't make any sense: it was off by
        7 edges and 4 corners. Then I checked all yellow and white stickers,
        found a couple of mistakes, and finally I had the position on paper. The
        difference was, as I excepted, 4 corners and 4 edges = 1 move. Then I
        marked the 4 edges with stickers (like looking for insertions in FMC)
        and went through the scramble to find a position where they are all on
        the same face (this is were the extra move is added). All this took
        60-80 minutes I think, but it was actually quite a nice puzzle. ;-) --

        Even though I live fairly near the venue (120km) I and my brother will
        probably stay at an hotel as last year. We were 6 guys that stayed at
        the same place and we did quite some cubing in the evening as you can
        understand. I recommend you to also come and stay at the same hotel. I
        will today put a suggestion for a hotel in the center of S√∂dert√§lje,
        which is at walking distance from the venue, and the prices are
        reasonable. There are several non-swedes that has shown interest in the
        competition already which makes me very happy. :-) One french competitor
        is even registered already. Visit

        So, if someone is interested. ;-) &gt; &gt; &gt; In exchange I can give

        Gilles &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Gilles =) &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; I forward that to the SveKub forum to see if anyone has got the
        room &gt; &gt; neeed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; // Kenneth &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        Hi Gilles! &gt; &gt; Even though I live fairly near the venue (120km) I
        and my brother will &gt; probably stay at an hotel as last year. We were
        6 guys that stayed at &gt; the same place and we did quite some cubing
        in the evening as you can &gt; understand. I recommend you to also come
        and stay at the same hotel. I &gt; will today put a suggestion for a
        hotel in the center of S√∂dert√§lje, &gt; which is at walking distance
        from the venue, and the prices are &gt; reasonable. &gt; &gt; There are
        several non-swedes that has shown interest in the &gt; competition
        already which makes me very happy. :-) One french &gt; competitor is

        "the son" (definit). In modern Swedish we use the same word as the
        Englishmen "son", (or rather the oppsite, they got it from the vikings
        =) The "e" in the end of "Sune" marks the definit form but today we say
        "sonen" = "en" ending instead of putting a "the" in front of the word as
        you do. But in some Swedish dialects you may say something like "sona",
        and that is pretty close to "Sune" :P // Kenneth

        There are very few silent letters in Swedish, and this E is no
        exception. All 4 letters are pronounced, with the stress falling on the
        first syllable. "SUneh" could be a pseudo phonetic way of writing it for
        english speakers. The Swedish "u" sound does not occur in English, and I
        don't think it can be described in text. I'm not sure, but I think it's
        even different from the German "u", and is among the sounds we try to
        use in military passwords. Even if the enemy actually learns the
        password, they can't pronounce it and can't make it through the
        checkpoint. Don't worry about the "u" part. Nobody likes a pronunciation
        snob. Had I had any idea this would be an internationally used term, I
        would have picked a more globally pronounceable name. Sorry about that.

        This Sunday (May 27) I will start an EBAY auction for a genuine boxed
        mint condition Dinosaur Rubik's Cube (Dino Cube) with dinosaur stickers.
        This is an original Dinosaur Cube (not a remake or clone) from 1995,
        never scrambled or played with, and still in original box. I have taken
        it out only to photograph it. Both the box and the cube are in original
        condition. This puzzle has been in my collection for over a decade and
        has been kept in a climate-controlled, smoke-free environment during
        that time. PHOTO: http://tinyurl.com/34xvsw Chris

        Rubik's bigcubes are definitely more stable, and potentially can be as
        smooth as Eastsheens. Over time, the Eastsheen wears, making it looser,
        which results (for my 5x5x5) lots of pops and cubes collapsing on itself
        every so often. The same thing for the 4x4x4; Eastsheens are nice until
        you have to take it apart to fix a mechanism pop or an actual cube pop
        (although the latter has never happened for me). Jonathan Choi

        If it's a normal 3x3 cube you bought in a store, don't waste your time.
        Not only are the center caps firmly attached, even if you do manage to
        get them off they use rivets instead of screws, so you can't
        loosen/tighten them. If you want to be able to adjust the tightness of

        sure, but I think it's even different from the German "u", and is among
        the sounds we try to use in military passwords. Even if the enemy
        actually learns the password, they can't pronounce it and can't make it

        Hi Gilles :-) You may have a go with ksolve. It's a very flexible solver
        that was discussed and posted at twistypuzzles. Let me see if i can find
        the link for you ... http://www.svekub.se/files/ksolve.zip Good luck!!

        HI :-) I believe that's Bandelow notation (yes a german, he was one of
        the foremost "cubewriters" in the early 80s alongside David B.
        Singmaster) Oh wait, the original Bandelow notation was more like MR and
        ML not RM and LM. Hmm ... Anyway it's the same as the more common r and
        l nowadays (for 4x4x4 and larger) :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        it seems to be something complitly different.. How can I identify my

        worry,but i just wondered,maybe i've have do re do it because of a
        mistake during my first registration. Or is more than 5 days normal for
        the aproval? If so, i'll be happy to wait untill it's done.

        Hey Ridhard, There was one time I got a nasty gash in my index and pinky
        fingers (rusty metal). Took the longest time to heal, and I think it
        might have slowed me down a little, but not too much. Also, before
        either Rutgers or Cornell I hyperextended my right thumb. That made it
        very hard to do practically anything for a while. Luckily it wasn't that
        bad and the doctors said it would just go away. Luckily, it had no
        affect on my cubing. The positions I use to hold the cube didn't make it
        hurt. Pretty much, don't be too worried about hurting your self before
        the competition. If its going to happen, its going to happen. Unless you
        can't physically cube, or cubing would make the problem worse, I would
        just deal with any problem that you might have. Hey, it worked for me.
        :) Hope that helps! -Peter Greenwood --- In

        About 3 weeks ago, I was backing out of a parking space downtown (one
        way street), and nobody was behind me until I got fully backed out, then
        I spotted someone coming at me fast. Having a 5 speed transmission, my
        hand quickly jumped from the wheel to the gearshift and in the process I
        slightly (very slightly) sprained my wrist. Luckily the guy went around
        me but he gave me a scare. It has hindered my times a bit... I'm off by
        a couple seconds, but fortunately the wrist does seem to be improving. I
        notice it most on slice turns (like H perm - M2' U M2 U2' M2' U M2).

        A reporter that covers a story about cubing won't necessarily be a cuber
        him/herself, nor will the reporter necessarily put too much effort into
        researching about cubing, so don't expect every (or any) news coverage
        to be too accurate, or worded correctly. I think it's still interesting
        to see that cubing has made quite a comeback from decades ago =).

        Well I have to disagree with the statement 'You always get what you pay
        for' cause I am used to get things for free. :p Seriously, the cheaper
        one will probably be of a much poorer quality. But the price increase to
        have a quality cube is about 1000%. So you need to balance between the
        high price and if you really want to have a good cube21 or if "just a
        cube21" is good enough. ;-) Gilles 2007/5/26, mpadgett85

        HI :) I really dislike the sluggish registration process at TP (Twisty
        Puzzles). Luckily i registered ages ago, when there was easy fast
        automatic registration ;) Personally i don't think this slowness can be
        justified from an antispam perspective. I would prefer a smarter
        automatic registration process instead of slow manual one :D -Per &gt;

        Hi Timothy, The current world record of 4.69 average was set on a
        Rubik's 2x2x2 Cube! And it was actually a pretty slow average for
        Lukasz. Have fun, Ron ----- Original Message ----- From: "Timothy Sun"

        That's very interesting... I suppose a good Rubik's 2x2x2 would be

        Hi Michael, I must say that I don't like his 2x2, it is extremely loose
        and feels unstable, but in his hands the cube looks like the extension
        of his fingers. Lukasz uses a combination of systems. This is what I
        understood when talking to him at Polish Open 2006. 1) first layer,
        second layer 2) 3 pieces of first layer, rest of the cube 3) bring
        together all 4 pieces of first layer (correctly oriented), second layer
        including permutation first layer In worst case he does not know the LL
        case of either of the 3, I think he uses 2) but then takes 3 steps. In
        best case he can actually see the whole solve ahead, often a 2) case.

        Me and my buddy Steve both won the raffle on the big cubes. They were
        cardboard boxes so we cut the tape on the top, flattened them out, then
        layed them in the back of my golf. All they need to be assembled is some
        more electrical tape. No problems. I was so psyched about winning one
        man! --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Tim Reynolds"

        Really? Then let me generate 100,000 scrambles and set my computer to
        pick out the easy ones.
        http://www.speedcubing.com/records/records-rules.html #3 I remember
        there was a scramble at the US Nationals '06 that had D2 (R B' R'B)x3)
        D2 for CP (or something like that)... Officially, it counts, but
        unofficially not? I'm not going to find them now, but maybe we should
        compute probabilites for placement and cycle length (orientation depends
        on the system and the solver) and require a BLD scramble to not be in
        the 1% "easiest" or "simplest" in any category? Or maybe at most one? I
        really don't like the great advantage of easy solves. Something like
        "Official WR is the fastest second-best personal time of anyone" would
        work better, but then again people like Tyson and Leyan have had a lot

        easy to make not-too-easy scrambles... there are a very limited number
        of solving strategies (unlike on a normal cube, where a Fridrich solver
        could do the same cube many different ways), so you could randomly or
        algorithmically construct cube positions with the properties of being
        about average difficulty (4-8 edges flipped, for example) for every main
        solving strategy, and then constructing a scramble when they are found.
        But maybe a simpler solution would be to have everyone do 3 solves, and
        compare people's "Mean of 3" averages. That would encourage higher
        consistency as well! --Michael Gottlieb

        &gt; I remember there was a scramble at the US Nationals '06 that had D2

        we've outgrown unofficial world records, or at least outgrown the
        prominence that they hold. I think listing everyone's personal bests on
        a list and comparing them is a good idea, but notice the prominence an
        unofficial world record gets on speedcubing.com's main site compared to
        official records. I just think it's interesting, especially since we're

        well that is just the thing. a scramble might be easier for one solving
        system but harder for another. there isn't really any way, I think, to
        deduce whether or not a scramble is inherently "easier" than another
        scramble for blindfold solving simply because people use different
        methods. even for a regular speedsolve, people solve it differently and
        therefore can achieve radically different times, even if they possess
        comparable handspeed and pattern recognition abilities. this sort of
        thing is much different from something like track, where the track
        doesn't really change much (unless you count weather conditions and the
        like). it's the same for everyone. cubing is much different due to the
        fact that you get a new scramble every time and people have different
        ways of getting to the goal (again, consider track. you aren't going to
        see some idiot running across the middle of the field in order to get
        ahead of everyone running ON the track). if someone gets a 3:40 mile,
        you can't deduce that as "lucky" like you can say a solve is lucky.
        however, as long as everyone has access to the same scrambles, then it's
        technically fair. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Stefan

        Hi :-) UWR's just serve an entirely different purpose from OWRs that's
        all. I don't see any problems with it. People can read into them what
        they like. Everyone knows that hard recognition is earned in official
        competitions like for any other sport. I particularly acknowledge that
        the UWR's is a great opportunity to post their results also for those
        who are not able to participate officially for some reason. Whether the
        lists should only contain recent results is another matter. The lists
        should reflect current capabilities :-) Also minesweeping has extensive
        UWR lists, and probably other gamelike activities also. I don't think
        (speed)cubing is really that unique in this respect ;-) My 2 cents. -Per

        You're right, though, I should have noted that that case was for the

        There was a discussion a while ago about only taking scrambles that were
        sufficiently hard (the idea of only taking scrambles at least x moves
        away from solved came up) and then and now I fully believe that this
        should not be the system. By setting limits like x moves away from
        solved, we're not doing anything. Nobody uses god's algorithm. And in
        some sense, we're being biased against that method (if somebody knew
        god's algorithm, they'd never have lucky or easy cases). Any limitation
        makes one method favorable to another, or one method less favorable than
        others. If you find a way of making non- lucky/easy scrambles that
        doesn't favor any method, real or theoretical, let me know. Setting
        limitations like "only 4-8 edges flipped" bothers me. Officially
        choosing one way of solving and picking only hard scrambles for that
        method is ridiculous. I don't care that a vast majority of speedcubers
        use a certain method. Changing the rules so that it's not as perfectly
        random as is possible given current technological limitations is going
        to inherently favor one method over another. An issue specific to "4-8
        edges flipped" is that it gives cubers too much information. (I'm
        referring to the definition of orientation where edges can be solved
        with U,D,F,B,R2,L2 for illustration). It's well-known that an odd number
        of edges on a cube can't be flipped unless there's some foul play going
        on. So you only need to look at 11 of the 12 edges to figure out the
        orientation. If you have checked 11 edges and there are 3 flipped, you
        know that the last one is flipped. That's fine, because it's true with
        any scrambling method. However, if you know that none of the first eight
        are flipped, there's no reason to believe that any orientation of the
        remaining eight edges is any more likely than any other. But if you know
        that only eight edges can be flipped, you can deduce that all of the
        remaining four are oriented correctly. That's not okay; you wouldn't
        have that knowledge outside the competition. Worse, this only gives
        information to cubers who use that specific definition of orientation.
        In short, I'm strongly against any method of picking scrambles which
        disallows any position. I personally think we should switch to something
        along the lines of CubeExplorer's way of picking a random position, then
        finding a scramble for it. Tim --- In

        blindfold it's relatively easy to make not-too-easy &gt; scrambles...
        there are a very limited number of solving strategies &gt; (unlike on a
        normal cube, where a Fridrich solver could do the same &gt; cube many
        different ways), so you could randomly or algorithmically &gt; construct
        cube positions with the properties of being about average &gt;
        difficulty (4-8 edges flipped, for example) for every main solving &gt;
        strategy, and then constructing a scramble when they are found. &gt;
        &gt; But maybe a simpler solution would be to have everyone do 3 solves,
        &gt; and compare people's "Mean of 3" averages. That would encourage

        About everything: I do acknowlegde that specific scramble restrictions
        are hsrd to handle. For one, EO (3-cycle method) is highly subjective; I
        would prefer a superflip (or a 10-flip) to a bad 6-flip. It depends on
        what algs I notice I can use. Easy CO, for me, though I can deal with
        hard scrambles well, depends on getting nice cases, but that varies for
        others by method and orientation for memo&amp;exec. However, I think
        that a measure of the following is reasonable: -Edges placed -Corners
        placed -Number of edge cycles -Number of corner cycles We could require
        that it not be too "easy" in more than one of these categories. I'd say:
        &lt;4 or &gt;8 edge cycles (counting those of length 1) &lt;3 or &gt;5
        corner cycles (counting those of length 1) &gt;3 edges placed &gt;3
        cornes placed If I calculated correctly, almost exactly 8/9 of all cube
        states follow at least 3 conditions (the issue of scrambles being random
        is a different issue, but not greatly influential). Of course, some
        stuff isn't covered (such as if there are four 3-edge cycles nicely set
        up), but it could weed out some uneven scrambles in the future. And no
        competitor will be able to use knowledge of these rules to very much of
        their advantage; it's probably better to practice more... The only
        problem would be in getting judges to follow this, and trusting them to
        do it correctly (and making sure they know how). Any such apathy ruins
        that, and even if there's a WCA delegate present, someone could probably
        convince others with "it normally won't make a difference." Most
        scramblers who could check this would proably be competing in BLD,
        too... And if only one person insists on following the rules, she/he
        gets called all sorts of things... Does this still seem unreasonable to
        anyone? -Lucas Garron

        well, i don't think anything is going to change as long as the scrambles
        are sufficiently random, i think that's the best that can be done.
        however, while i have never competed (and so i don't know the rules
        fully), i think anyone competing should have the chance to cube with the
        same scramble as another as long as, perhaps, the scrambles are given in
        different orders in order to avoid cheating. therefore you can't ever
        get any arguments such as "i never get any easy scrambles like he did/i
        always get hard scrambles!" because everyone competing would have gone
        through the same scrambles at the end of the day. i think allowing
        person A exclusive access to scramble X is not fair, and it is this way
        in any sport (i play many solo-player-oriented sports, and they all
        attempt to make it so everyone has a fair shot at the same conditions.
        if the same conditions cannot be met EXACTLY, then comparable conditions
        must be substituted). Person B should also have access to scramble X.
        anyone who disagrees with this, i feel, simply is unable to figure out
        how to enforce anti-cheating guidelines (eg. if person A has information
        about scramble X, he cannot tell person B a thing about that scramble.
        likewise, person B cannot observe person A solving scramble X). i think
        the best that can be done to determine what is "lucky" would be to first
        run many trials to determine average times given certain cube cases (eg.
        cycle lengths, completed pieces, etc). then, determine what is
        statistically significant in order to derive the conditions for what is
        lucky. in order to account for any solving system, lucky pieces would
        have to be fully-solved pieces (oriented/permuted correctly), although
        this could be debatable. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        do acknowlegde that specific scramble restrictions are hsrd to handle.
        &gt; For one, EO (3-cycle method) is highly subjective; I would prefer a
        &gt; superflip (or a 10-flip) to a bad 6-flip. It depends on what algs I

        scrambles well, depends on &gt; getting nice cases, but that varies for
        others by method and orientation for &gt; memo&amp;exec. &gt; &gt;
        However, I think that a measure of the following is reasonable: &gt;
        -Edges placed &gt; -Corners placed &gt; -Number of edge cycles &gt;
        -Number of corner cycles &gt; &gt; We could require that it not be too
        "easy" in more than one of these &gt; categories. I'd say: &gt; &lt;4 or
        &gt;8 edge cycles (counting those of length 1) &gt; &lt;3 or &gt;5
        corner cycles (counting those of length 1) &gt; &gt;3 edges placed &gt;
        &gt;3 cornes placed &gt; &gt; If I calculated correctly, almost exactly
        8/9 of all cube states follow at &gt; least 3 conditions (the issue of
        scrambles being random is a different &gt; issue, but not greatly
        influential). &gt; &gt; Of course, some stuff isn't covered (such as if
        there are four 3-edge cycles &gt; nicely set up), but it could weed out
        some uneven scrambles in the future. &gt; And no competitor will be able
        to use knowledge of these rules to very much &gt; of their advantage;
        it's probably better to practice more... &gt; The only problem would be

        probably convince others with "it normally won't make a difference."

        A 2x2x2 block is useless in corners-first strategies. So by saying "no
        2x2x2 blocks", we're favoring corners-first people by eliminating an
        easy possibility for Fridrich people, Petrus people, and to a certain
        extent, Roux people. So unless we outlaw something of perfectly equal
        goodness form CF people, we're favoring somebody. That's why "blatantly
        lucky" is a difficult term. And don't say that there aren't many fast CF
        people. The WCA regulations shouldn't favor one method to another, even
        if most people don't use a certain method. I assume you were referring
        to 3x3 speedsolve, since a 2x2x2 block isn't lucky in 3x3 BLD, unless
        other pieces are solved. Lucas: To play the devil's advocate, in
        Stefan's method, having a piece in place but twisted is no better than
        having it out of place in terms of algorithms. In fact, in Stefan's
        method's purest form, a piece in place but twisted takes more algorithms
        to solve. Direct solving methods do not benefit from having pieces in
        place but twisted. So an outright limitation on the number of pieces in
        place would, again, be unfair. If we were to say pieces in place,
        oriented correctly...well, I seem to remember from my days of using
        Pochmann that having the edge in my buffer position solved made it take
        more algorithms. So starting out with that edge or corner solved (or at
        least permuted) actually made it more difficult to solve. In response to
        your last comment, Michael, I think that many people would argue that
        the average record is a much better reflection of that. It's really
        impossible to eliminate all luck from contests; there's absolutely no
        way to eliminate luck on the LL. Averages neutralize some of the chance
        of getting lucky, which is why many people consider Gungz's 11.76
        average a better indication of speed than Thibaut's 9.86 or Dan's 10.08

        lucky for an average to be affected - and don't forget Harris's
        unofficial 10.46), but it's much less likely. But the problem with BLD
        is that it's hard to even take an average. Some people are very
        consistent, but others DNF most or all of the time even when they are
        good at the event, and most people are so slow at blindfolded solving
        that giving them five solves would seriously hinder a competition. I'd
        love it if we could consider averages in the blindfold event, but it
        would be somewhat impractical in a competition. --Michael Gottlieb

        the same opportunity to get a good scramble on each scramble. Clearly,
        this favors people who compete a lot, since they get more opportunities

        what is hard, as that is entirely subjective and varies from person to
        person.

        Blatantly lucky? Not so. At least not by the current definition: &gt;For
        blindfold solving a lucky case is defined by: &gt;1) more than 5 corners
        are correctly oriented, or &gt;2) more than 8 edges are correctly
        oriented, or &gt;3) more than 3 corners are correctly positioned, or
        &gt;4) more than 4 edges are correctly positioned. A 2x2x2 block has one
        corner correctly positioned and oriented, and three edges correctly
        positioned and oriented. So it's not lucky by the current definition on
        speedcubing.com &gt; In the speedsolve event, a block like that is very
        &gt; nice, but not necessarily equally lucky for everyone (although, in
        &gt; your example, a corners-first person can, in theory, solve the
        corners &gt; while keeping the block totally intact, and then be left
        with three &gt; good edges). &gt; Yes, but that's not part of their
        method. If, when you get to LL, all the pieces are in their place but
        not oriented, and you do OLL before PLL, the "luck" that you had is
        gone. Yet that would be lucky for people who do PLL then OLL (which is,
        I admit, a small if existent group of people). It is a similar situation
        here. If you use a cross-F2L method, and you have no experience in
        preserving corner-edge pairs while making the cross, it would slow you
        down so that the time saved from an easy insertion would not be worth
        it. This is a similar case: CF solvers have no reason to practice
        preserving a 2x2 block, as it generally does them no good. Tim

        I just started playing around with the cube. I can do one side real well
        but that's it. I've read and re-read instructions and steps. Watched
        movies. I can't get it. Anybody near Wisconsin. Wisconsin, USA? Chicago?
        Milwaukee? Madison? I'll pay money for a tutor. That's the only I'm
        gonna solve the cube. I'm 33 years old. I'm too old. Thanks bro's. -

        First time posting so i'm not sure if this is the right spot or

        the algs really fast and not very well, and when i had about 35 of them
        done, it finaly clicked in my brain how it works, and recently i've
        goten pretty good at doing it in about 28 moves most of the time. In all
        the super good speed cubing videos they don't turn the cube around a lot
        or move their hands from one corner edge pair slot to another, I don't
        see how they do it so easily, When i do that i know where the pieces
        should go but i have to do all these weird finger tricks, it doesn't
        work that well, any tips? My average is about 35 to 40 seconds, My

        Practice, practice, practice, even more practice. Look around the

        Hi all, I got a new Eastsheen 4x4x4 not too long ago and I loved the way

        if you are the visual type, you can reconstruct how the alg will look
        from a different angle in your mind and do it without moving the cube.
        go slow at first until you get it. like brian said, practice practice :)

        On either cube4you or 9spuzzles I've seen that they list them each as
        having a slightly different weight. I bought two of them (the highest
        and lowest costing) and I felt no difference, although I wouldn't
        declare there is none. I preferred Rubik's over these and never broke

        Lucky is not the same as improbable. Having all pieces out of place and
        oriented incorrectly has extremely low chance of occurence, but that
        doesn't mean it's a lucky case. The mistake you made is that having 3
        edges solved is just as easy as having 3 edges permuted and 3 *other*
        edges oriented, which isn't that rare. (I'm only talking about orient
        first approach here, for direct solvers having 4 pieces solved *could*
        be an easy case, but it depends on the details of the method.) --

        lucky case. It depends, if you apply the superflip to flip all the
        edges, and you know an algorithm for all 86 cases where every single
        corner is incorrectly twisted, then I would in fact consider this a
        lucky case. True it is not as lucky as all edges and all corners
        correctly oriented, but it would still be much easier to memorize a case
        like this than most cases, even if it isn't as easy to memorize as no
        flipped pieces at all. &gt; &gt; The mistake you made is that having 3
        edges solved is just as easy as &gt; having 3 edges permuted and 3
        *other* edges oriented, which isn't that &gt; rare. (I'm only talking
        about orient first approach here, for direct &gt; solvers having 4
        pieces solved *could* be an easy case, but it depends &gt; on the
        details of the method.) I specifically mentioned that I was finding the
        chance of 3 edges correctly permuted and correctly oriented, in addition
        to 1 corner correctly permuted and correctly oriented. The way I figured
        this does still allow for other edges and corners to be permuted (but
        not oriented), and also for other edges and corners to be not permuted
        but correctly oriented. I wanted to find the probability for a general
        2x2x2 being built after the scramble since that is the case that was
        mentioned to be very lucky. I didn't want to restrict to just a 2x2x2
        block, but rather it's components of 3 edges and 1 corner placed
        anywhere on the cube. Also I don't agree with this statement: &gt; The
        mistake you made is that having 3 edges solved is just as easy &gt;as
        &gt; having 3 edges permuted and 3 *other* edges oriented, which isn't
        &gt;that &gt; rare. I interpret this to mean that 3 edges are correctly
        permuted, but incorrectly flipped, and 3 other edges are not permuted,
        but correctly flipped. I disagree that this is just as easy as three
        edges that are both correctly permuted and correctly flipped. For the
        case where 3 edges are both correctly permuted and correctly flipped you
        not only don't have to memorize those pieces at all, but you also don't
        have to perform any sort of algorithm to affect those pieces. For your
        case, if I am interpretting this correctly, you would have to memorize
        all 3 edges that are correctly permuted but incorrectly flipped so that
        you could flip them later. Also you would have to memorize the 3 edges
        that are flipped correctly but not permuted so you could permute them
        later. I don't agree that this is equally as easy as the case where 3
        edges are both correctly permuted and correctly oriented. So having
        three edges correctly permuted and correctly flipped, as well as 1
        corner correctly permuted and correctly flipped, and no other piece on
        the cube that is both correctly permuted and correctly flipped, I
        maintain is fairly rare at about 0.3% chance of occurence. I also
        maintain that this case is significantly easier to both memorize and
        solve than 3 edges that are correctly permuted but incorrectly flipped
        and 3 other edges that are not permuted but correctly flipped (and the
        same idea for the 1 corner). Chris

        &gt; Ok, my bad. I memorize and solve EO and EP separately from each
        other, so for me it doesn't matter at all how they overlap. And I think
        that this is what was sccuber's point in message #36030, the one you
        replied to. I didn't know that some people memorize so that the relation
        of EO and EP matters, but after all I know almost nothing about memory
        methods. Direct solving is of course another matter, but these messages
        were about orienting first (I think). &gt; &gt; I also maintain that
        this case is significantly easier to both &gt; memorize and solve than 3

        I know who orient first. Memorization could maybe possibly be slightly
        easier because recognizing the solved pieces is easier, but for an
        experienced cuber it shouldn't be a difference. If you use direct
        solving then you are of course right, but I was talking about orienting
        and permuting separately. I should've been more clear about that, sorry.

        Still though, notice how three edges correctly permuted and correctly

        effectively reduces your cube to a 9 piece edge orbit, which should
        nearly always be easier to memorize and solve than a 12 piece orbit. The
        same applies for 1 corner solved recuding the corners to a 7 piece
        orbit. So I guess it probably only minutely helps an orient first solver
        to have 3 pieces completely solved vs. 3 pieces permuted and 3 separate
        pieces oriented. But yes for direct solving having three pieces
        completely solved is a *huge* advantage both for memorizing and solving.

        the centralmost edges of a 5x5x5 cube, and corners on both cubes have
        orientations. As for orient first vs. direct solving on a bigger cube
        consider my centralmost edge orientation algs: orient the 4 centralmost
        edges of the U layer of a 5x5x5: R' e' R2 e2 R' U' R' e' R2 e2 R' U' R
        e2 R2 e R U' R e2 R2 e R U' orient the 4 central most edges of the e
        layer: R F' U R' F e R F' U R' F e F' R U' F R' e F' R U' F R' e I also
        found this alg which is faster to execute, but still a very long alg.
        Orient ULs, URs, FRe, BRe: e' R e' R e' R2 e R e R e R2 F' B U B' F e' R
        e' R e' R2 e R e R e R2 F' B U' B' F Now compare that to the example of
        a typical commutator which solves both the position and orientation of 2
        centralmost edges at once: R' e R U2 R' e' R U2 It's really not a hard
        decision as to which method to use on a bigger cube BLD ;-) Now as for
        the 3x3x3 cube that's a whole other story. I just did a couple 3x3x3 BLD
        solves using the buffer method for memorization and freestyle
        commutators for solving and my best was a 1:50.60. Memorization took me
        1:08 so the solving phase then took me about 42 seconds. My best solves
        with this method right now are mid to low 1:50's, but my best solves
        with orient first are sub-1:40, so orient first is still faster for me.
        I know I can speed up my memory for the buffer method by training myself
        not to sub-vocalize my images during memorization, and also I can work
        on quicker image recall in general. My main interest are the bigger
        cubes though. If working on the bigger cubes speeds up my 3x3x3 then
        that's cool, but really I just work on the bigger cubes. I'm like Daniel
        Beyer, I've fallen in love with the bigger cubes BLD and I don't care as
        much for 3x3x3 BLD as I used to :-P Take a look at my results from
        Chattahoochee 2007 in the 3x3x3 BLD category to see what I mean ;-)

        &gt; &gt; direct-solving method would speed up times that much more, but
        i could &gt; &gt; be totally off here &gt; &gt; Yeah only the
        centralmost edges of a 5x5x5 cube, and corners on both &gt; cubes have
        orientations. &gt; &gt; As for orient first vs. direct solving on a
        bigger cube consider my &gt; centralmost edge orientation algs: &gt;
        &gt; orient the 4 centralmost edges of the U layer of a 5x5x5: &gt; R'
        e' R2 e2 R' U' R' e' R2 e2 R' U' R e2 R2 e R U' R e2 R2 e R U' &gt; &gt;
        orient the 4 central most edges of the e layer: &gt; R F' U R' F e R F'
        U R' F e F' R U' F R' e F' R U' F R' e &gt; &gt; I also found this alg
        which is faster to execute, but still a very &gt; long alg. &gt; &gt;
        Orient ULs, URs, FRe, BRe: &gt; e' R e' R e' R2 e R e R e R2 F' B U B' F
        e' R e' R e' R2 e R e R e R2 &gt; F' B U' B' F &gt; &gt; Now compare
        that to the example of a typical commutator which solves &gt; both the
        position and orientation of 2 centralmost edges at once: &gt; R' e R U2
        R' e' R U2 &gt; &gt; It's really not a hard decision as to which method
        to use on a bigger &gt; cube BLD ;-) &gt; &gt; Now as for the 3x3x3 cube
        that's a whole other story. I just did a &gt; couple 3x3x3 BLD solves
        using the buffer method for memorization and &gt; freestyle commutators
        for solving and my best was a 1:50.60. &gt; Memorization took me 1:08 so
        the solving phase then took me about 42 &gt; seconds. My best solves
        with this method right now are mid to low &gt; 1:50's, but my best
        solves with orient first are sub-1:40, so orient &gt; first is still
        faster for me. I know I can speed up my memory for the &gt; buffer
        method by training myself not to sub-vocalize my images during &gt;
        memorization, and also I can work on quicker image recall in general.
        &gt; My main interest are the bigger cubes though. If working on the
        &gt; bigger cubes speeds up my 3x3x3 then that's cool, but really I just
        &gt; work on the bigger cubes. &gt; &gt; I'm like Daniel Beyer, I've
        fallen in love with the bigger cubes BLD &gt; and I don't care as much
        for 3x3x3 BLD as I used to :-P Take a look &gt; at my results from
        Chattahoochee 2007 in the 3x3x3 BLD category to see &gt; what I mean ;-)

        That's not really true; it's more that I don't use your method and &gt;
        therefore am more likely to think of cases in terms of my method. I
        know. That's what I actually meant. &gt; By the way, what counts as
        lucky with your system? Would it only be &gt; edges/corners that are in
        the right place and position? Depends. Like Tim already said, one
        old/obsolete way of my method to orient a piece in place was to get it
        into the buffer with one alg and bring it back oriented correctly with
        another alg. So a piece in the "correct place" but bad orientation used
        to be my worst case. Nowadays I use an alg that orients one piece (along
        with the buffer) so the case isn't as bad anymore, but about the same as
        any other. However if you add an orient-first step to the beginning of
        my method and make that a regular phase of the method, then the case
        turns into an easy one. However, I don't do that. So yes, for me lucky
        only means correct place and orientation (I guess that's what you meant
        when you wrote "place and position"). And like Tim also pointed out, the
        buffer piece being solved actually doesn't help me at all and is more
        bad than lucky. Cheers! Stefan

        &gt; the same sitiation. Get over it. Still, though, what if the entire

        many people will be able to see that the F2L is that quick, and then do
        the F2L within 4 seconds or so. For some solvers, at least, this would
        be a lucky scramble. Basically, I would have no problem if a WR was set
        with an LL skip, because I have a chance of getting a LL skip at my next
        competition. But I wouldn't like it if someone set a WR with a lucky
        scramble, because then I know that before the event at my next
        competition, a computer would have already decided whether I am allowed
        to get luck like that, and if the computer says I can't then I would not
        have the same chance at a good time. I guess my point is that on the
        3x3x3 - or any bigger cube - it requires luck for a skip near the end,
        but a good scramble for a skip near the beginning. And you can have the
        same luck in any competition, but you can't have the same lucky scramble
        in any competition. Scrambles are predetermined, so before you even go
        up to solve the cube it's decided whether you will be lucky or not. That
        strikes me as somewhat unfair to the people who don't ever get to solve
        that scramble. For example - at the Captain's Cove competition, the
        first 5x5x5 scramble had what I'd consider a lucky center, where the
        entire thing could be very easily solved in about 5 moves. Everyone in
        the competition who used a reduction method had that lucky center, so
        it's an unfair advantage to the people who happened to compete there. If
        someone happened to set a WR using that scramble (it probably saved
        about 5 seconds, which could mean a new single solve WR for one of the
        sub-2 guys), they had predetermined luck, and I'd say that that's a
        little unfair to others who couldn't or didn't go to that competition.
        Besides, even if it doesn't affect 5x5x5 solves that much, whether a
        scramble is lucky can be very important on 2x2x2 (if you can see the
        whole solve during inspection, and one step is skipped, it will by
        necessity be extremely fast) and 3x3x3-blindfold (if pieces are already
        solved, memorization will be easier and execution will be faster).

        has to happen sometime. Also, as I have said many times, we're assuming
        a world in which everyone uses an F2L method. A 10-move F2L, for CF
        people, is not very good. On corners, you should usually be able to get
        the first four corners in less than 10 moves anyway. So a 10- move F2L
        doesn't really help everyone equally. &gt; Basically, I would have no
        problem if a WR was set with an LL skip, &gt; because I have a chance of
        getting a LL skip at my next competition. &gt; But I wouldn't like it if
        someone set a WR with a lucky scramble, &gt; because then I know that
        before the event at my next competition, a &gt; computer would have
        already decided whether I am allowed to get luck &gt; like that, and if
        the computer says I can't then I would not have the &gt; same chance at
        a good time. But you have the same chance of that good scramble as
        anybody else at any given competition. They both boil down to luck, easy
        scrambles and lucky LL's. &gt; I guess my point is that on the 3x3x3 -
        or any bigger cube - it &gt; requires luck for a skip near the end, but
        a good scramble for a skip &gt; near the beginning. And you can have the
        same luck in any competition, &gt; but you can't have the same lucky
        scramble in any competition. Can't you? &gt; Scrambles are
        predetermined, so before you even go up to solve the &gt; cube it's
        decided whether you will be lucky or not. That strikes me as &gt;
        somewhat unfair to the people who don't ever get to solve that scramble.
        Is it more unfair than if someone does a really efficient F2L and gets
        ugly LL cases while another person does a less efficient F2L and,
        completely by chance, gets an LL skip? They both boil down to luck. &gt;
        For example - at the Captain's Cove competition, the first 5x5x5 &gt;
        scramble had what I'd consider a lucky center, where the entire thing
        &gt; could be very easily solved in about 5 moves. Everyone in the &gt;
        competition who used a reduction method had that lucky center, so it's
        &gt; an unfair advantage to the people who happened to compete there. If
        &gt; someone happened to set a WR using that scramble (it probably saved
        &gt; about 5 seconds, which could mean a new single solve WR for one of
        the &gt; sub-2 guys), they had predetermined luck, and I'd say that
        that's a &gt; little unfair to others who couldn't or didn't go to that
        competition. This brings up another point. I didn't see that 5-move
        center (at least I don't remember seeing it). Granted, I'm terribly out
        of practice on the 5x5. But it requires some skill to see and plan out
        stuff. In block-building, you can't capitalize on luck unless you're
        good at block-building. &gt; &gt; Besides, even if it doesn't affect
        5x5x5 solves that much, whether a &gt; scramble is lucky can be very
        important on 2x2x2 (if you can see the &gt; whole solve during
        inspection, and one step is skipped, it will by &gt; necessity be
        extremely fast) and 3x3x3-blindfold (if pieces are &gt; already solved,
        memorization will be easier and execution will be faster). &gt; What do
        you want to do about 2x2? Take Anthony Hsu's WR single. A 3- move layer,
        then a sune (unless I'm mistaken). Is that lucky? Yes, it was a PLL
        skip. Can you control that? No. What can you control? Easy first layers?
        That's basically it. Will that reduce the number of lucky solves
        drastically? Probably not. I've given my views on blindfold already, I
        don't feel the need to do so again. Tim

        &gt; &gt; or 0.3% chance of occurence. So yes I agree this is a bit
        lucky. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; Hmm, so you say if something
        has a 0.3% (or lower, I guess?) chance &gt; of occurence, it's lucky?
        Then *every single cube state* is lucky, &gt; because every one of them
        has an even much lower chance of &gt;occurence! If we're really going to
        get into the semantics of this, then yes: I do in fact consider ever
        single position on the cube to be a lucky case. The chances of you
        seeing any random position on the cube are astronomically small. Except
        for cases like 1 move away from solved which come up more often for us
        because of how we scramble the cube from a solved state you may not ever
        see any one given cube state in your lifetime. There are probably cube
        states that have never been realized on all the cubes that have ever
        been scrambled since the cube was invented. I was applying my subjective
        opinion of what constitutes luck when comparing that 0.3% chance to
        other probabilities that occur in the solving methods with which I have
        experience. Apparently we disagree on whether or not that case is lucky.
        I could also have chosen to take the complete opposite stance in my
        original post. The chance that you get three edges both correctly
        permuted and oriented, and also the same for one corner, are so
        astronomically *huge* when compared to the chance of seeing any one
        particular cube state out of the total 43252003274489856000 as to be
        completely boring and common place. In fact I could also argue this
        about a LL skip in Fridrich solving. 1/15552 is so much more likely of a
        probability than 1/43252003274489856000 that I can subjectively consider
        it not only common place, but boringly common place. I don't however do
        that. I choose to consider a LL skip a lucky case. Luck is not
        mathematically defined, as far as I know, so obviously we will all have
        disagreements on what is lucky and what is not. I could always compare
        any uncommon occurence or small probability to the probability of
        quantum tunneling through my front door in the morning on the way to
        work. This would effectively make nearly any probability appear common
        place and boring. I don't think this would get anybody anywhere though.

        Even worse is that in any given pyraminx competition, assuming five
        distinct scrambles (with each having a different solution), there is a
        .0005% chance of only having to twist the trivial tips. Then again,

        Maybe it is a higher quality Square-1. The only difference I really see
        is that it is a Czech cube, so it is not unlike what Studio Cubes are to

        &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm, so you say if something has a 0.3%
        (or lower, I guess?) chance &gt; &gt; of occurence, it's lucky? Then
        *every single cube state* is lucky, &gt; &gt; because every one of them
        has an even much lower chance of &gt;occurence! &gt; &gt; Luck is not
        mathematically defined, as far as I know, so obviously we &gt; will all
        have disagreements on what is lucky and what is not. Or you could just
        say that luck for us means 1) skipping a step AND 2) the skip
        probability being below some agreed upon threshold. With that, you
        wouldn't have to call every single cube state lucky. What I actually
        meant to say is something slightly different, more general, though.
        Namely that looking at the raw occurence probability of a set of cube
        states something isn't enough. You need to see it in context,
        particularly relative to a cuber's method and the algs he knows. Cheers!

        Hi! I guess I'm fairly fast with my 1:10.07 average. My fastest timet
        centers+edges is 31.x, but my best times for centers and edges separated
        are: center: 10.47 edges: 17.68 It's the 3x3-step that slows my down. My
        average for this step excluding parities is around 23s, which is way to
        much. /Gunnar

        The lowest prior upper bound (also determined using computer analyses)
        that I was aware was 27 face turns. So I concur this represents a new
        upper bound in FTM. If you follow the link, there is a link for
        downloading the paper (PDF format). They do state within the paper that
        it is face-turn metric. It may be widely believed that 20 or at least 21
        face turns is sufficient, but there is no real proof yet for those
        figures. No position having some symmetry requires more than 20 face
        turns has reportedly been proven, but that represents a small fraction
        of the total positions of the cube. But based upon smaller related
        groups, the deepest positions seem to generally have a much
        over-abundant share of symmetric positions than their fraction of
        positions would suggest. So this leads people to believe there 20 (or
        maybe 21) could indeed be the ultimate value. - Bruce --- In

        decathelon event. In another mind sport "WORLD MEMORY CHAMPIONSHIP"
        there are 10 events. Although the winners of every indivdual event are
        honoured, the overall memory champion is decided by summing up the
        scores of all 10 events. The number of memorisers in the world is not
        more than 200. But I think the number of serious speed cubers are in
        multiples of that number. I think time factor and a thin number of
        participants might be reason for considering this event. Hence, itstead
        of going for a seperate event, a point system may be introduced for
        every event and overall championis decided by summing up them all. John
        Louis Corwin &lt;aznspazboi@...&gt; wrote: I'm proposing an event for
        competetion: a 2x2 through 5x5 speedsolve event for a total time. The
        point of this event is for the cuber to be able to solve all the
        different sizes of their cubes consistently fast, rather then be the
        best at one. The cuber will have all the puzzles laid down and will be
        allowed to solve in any order. The winner will have have the best time
        of three. What do you think? -Corwin ---------------------------------

        hey I made a club at my school and my advise is to keep people
        interested try to recruit, incoming freshman(or sophomores are ok too)
        so they can keep up your legacy, and also because odds are you wont have
        many active members try to find some people at other schools nearby. My
        biggest problem has been getting peopel to o to competitions, they
        usually use and excuse like "ohh i am to slow i will get last" or
        something to that effect and its makes it a bit difficult but i can
        usually get 2~5 people to go.

        That is BS, really -- I would agree with you that it is a shame, and
        really, they should allow the event. Who cares if the fastest 5x5 solver
        wins? It's still an event dealing with whole units, and still provides
        fodder for competition, and is still valid. Nobody in other sports
        discredits or disallows events of "grouping" styles because of
        speculation of who may win or lose. --- In

        There will always be an element of chance in Rubik's Cube that we cannot
        control. No offense to Chris Krueger. I believe Chris to be one of the
        world's best blindfolded Rubik's Cube solvers, and he does things that
        no one else in this world can do. He is simply world class. But having a
        world record only means you have the world record. It doesn't mean
        you're the best cuber around. In order to be the best cuber, you have to
        consistently win competitions against a high level of competition. If
        everyone gets the same scramble, and everyone gets F2L skips, doesn't
        the fastest person win? But if someone uses a different method... who's
        to say that person who uses method A gets lucky and person who uses
        method B doesn't? There's no way to control that. Perhaps the wind was
        blowing a certain way during the 100 meter dash? Or what about speed
        skating, where one guy falls, takes out everyone else, and the
        Australian (Bradbury?) who was so far behind, that he was able to avoid
        the crash, wins the gold medal? Short track speed skating... did he get
        lucky? He was damn lucky. He was getting owned, and then everyone in
        front of him got wiped out. Did he get the gold medal? Yes. Why? Because
        he won. End of story. Nothing we can do about luck. There simply isn't
        an unbiased way of coming up with a metric. Don't even waste your time
        trying to disprove this statement. In fact, if I weren't so tired, I'd
        write a proof on why this can't be done right now. Chris Krueger has the
        world record. Leave it there. He did very well. Is there any reason that
        he doesn't deserve it? No. I mean, 9.86, 10.09, 11.13... these were all
        "lucky" solves, but even if you do every step of the Fridrich method, if
        you had Katsu's 8 second solve, wouldn't that be luckier than a simply
        PLL skip? -Tyson On May 31, 2007, at 1:20 AM, Stefan Pochmann wrote:

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm, so you
        say if something has a 0.3% (or lower, I guess?) &gt; chance &gt; &gt;
        &gt; of occurence, it's lucky? Then *every single cube state* is &gt;
        lucky, &gt; &gt; &gt; because every one of them has an even much lower
        chance of &gt; &gt;occurence! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Luck is not
        mathematically defined, as far as I know, so obviously &gt; we &gt; &gt;
        will all have disagreements on what is lucky and what is not. &gt; &gt;
        Or you could just say that luck for us means &gt; 1) skipping a step AND
        &gt; 2) the skip probability being below some agreed upon threshold.
        &gt; With that, you wouldn't have to call every single cube state lucky.
        &gt; &gt; What I actually meant to say is something slightly different,
        more &gt; general, though. Namely that looking at the raw occurence
        probability &gt; of a set of cube states something isn't enough. You
        need to see it in &gt; context, particularly relative to a cuber's
        method and the algs he &gt; knows. &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; Stefan &gt;

        Okay, I have very little time as many as you know, but I read the
        subject of this, and I glanced at what this thread started out to be and
        all I can say is: IPO. A cuber can IPO himself/herself... in other
        words, you buy stock in the cuber, and that stock is worth 50% of the
        future cash earning of the cuber. The cuber could raise initial capital
        to go to competitions and earn the cash. Or if you believe a cuber is
        reliable, buy bonds from the cuber. We should set up an exchange so I

        well in those other sport examples, not everyone is having roughly the
        same chances as they are engaging in a sport at the same time WITH each
        other, with possibilities of interacting with one another, unlike
        cubing. however, the notion of "if others fail, you can succeed" still
        applies. the wind is a good example though, however subtle. but this is
        why i was happy earlier that everyone gets the same scramble lists. it
        makes it very fair. if person A gets a "lucky" case, there's no reason
        why person B can't either. and this applies to any solve, really, as any
        solve has the potential to be "lucky" depending on how you go about

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm, so you say if something has a 0.3% (or lower, I
        guess?) &gt; &gt; chance &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of occurence, it's lucky?
        Then *every single cube state* is &gt; &gt; lucky, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        because every one of them has an even much lower chance of &gt; &gt;
        &gt;occurence! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Luck is not mathematically
        defined, as far as I know, so obviously &gt; &gt; we &gt; &gt; &gt; will
        all have disagreements on what is lucky and what is not. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Or you could just say that luck for us means &gt; &gt; 1) skipping
        a step AND &gt; &gt; 2) the skip probability being below some agreed
        upon threshold. &gt; &gt; With that, you wouldn't have to call every
        single cube state lucky. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I actually meant to
        say is something slightly different, more &gt; &gt; general, though.
        Namely that looking at the raw occurence probability &gt; &gt; of a set
        of cube states something isn't enough. You need to see it in &gt; &gt;
        context, particularly relative to a cuber's method and the algs he &gt;
        &gt; knows. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; Stefan &gt; &gt; &gt;

        It would be helpful if you used the more universal notation for

        So, I already lubed it...but it's hard, since you can't do like on the

        ... another tutorial. I only looked briefly -- there may be other things
        I did not catch -- but your first step for last layer orientation
        (solving blue cross) is ineffective. What you've written does not always
        work. There are three cases: 1) no edges are oriented, 2) two adjacent
        edges are oriented, 3) 2 opposite edges are oriented. I tried to
        complete this step by your description (curiously) and failed. The
        "algorithm" (F U R U' R' F', by standard notation) you provided has a
        specific orientation it needs to be solved from, and it orients two
        adjacent edges (UF &amp; UR) and preserves the already oriented edges
        (UB &amp; UL). Very nice cube images. Notation... might as well change
        it. Alex On 6/2/07, Brian Le &lt;khoale1234567@...&gt; wrote: &gt; &gt;

        himself/herself... in other words, you buy stock in the cuber, and that
        stock is worth 50% of the future cash earning of the cuber. The cuber
        could raise initial capital to go to competitions and earn the cash. Or
        if you believe a cuber is reliable, buy bonds from the cuber. We should

        Hi Stefan, I just looked through the page. Very cool concept; I might
        need to give it a try. It's very cool that the algorithms are so short
        even though M2 and R2 affect a lot more pieces than, say, the
        T-permutation. So you would say that sub-1 min average is very easily
        possible with this method? In any case, I'm impressed. Macky --- In

        min average is very easily possible with &gt; this method? Hi Macky, I
        wouldn't say "easily" but yes, I think that's possible, at least a
        record average. Memorization is basically the same as my older method
        and Boris Konrad, a top memorizer, told me he averaged memorizing a cube
        for my older method in 40 seconds after a little practice. I've
        witnessed a guy memorizing a scrambled deck of 52 cards in 31 seconds
        several times at a memory competition, so I think a 30 seconds real
        average for memorizing the cube should be feasible, too, maybe faster.
        Sometimes I've blindsolved the same scramble several times and got the
        blindfolded execution into the low 30's once recall was fluent. Not with
        all scrambles, but with some. And I believe 40 seconds real average is
        possible, especially with a richer set of clean-up algorithms for
        orienting edges and corners and fixing parity together, and more
        practice. Together that'd be a 30+40 seconds real average. Cheers!

        Hi Guys, I have (or had! :) ) one Eastsheen 4x4x4 until yesterday when I
        was playing with in at the bathroom (during those free times that we
        spent seated there) when I dropped the cube and something happened
        inside it because I couldn't more do some movements with it. Well...
        anyway... I tried to fix it and accidentaly my cube disassembly into a
        thousand parts!! (no one is broken) do you know where can I find a
        tutorial to reassembly it or is easier to buy a new one? Thanks a lot.

        Hi Stefan, I know that probably is not so hard. I just want something to
        tell me which part goes to which part. Anyway, I found an image in
        cube4you website that shows how it is assembled (not entire). Now I can
        figure the internal pieces and also which one goes besides which cube.
        Tonight I will try this new puzzle. Hope to be lucky and solve it asap
        since the 4x4x4 is my prefered. I also have the 5x5x5 but really, the
        4x4x4 is the most funny since sometimes you solve the middles in
        different positions and just realize when are trying to finish the
        edges! :) Cheers On 04/06/07, Stefan Pochmann &lt;pochmann@...&gt;

        Hi :-) Here's my mini-tutorial how to assemble Eastsheen 4x4x4. It may
        not be the best way but it is quite fast to do it that way actually.
        Making the small internal pieces align correctly may be somewhat tricky!

        In plain notation (without lowercase) the way i originally found that
        one ages ago was like so: R2 U' B2 U R2 - F2 U L2 U' F2 ( D) The latter
        5 turns are just the mirrored version of first 5. Making cyclical shoft

        Hey everyone, If you have time tonight, and you average sub-20, could
        you do something for me? Open up a scrambling program. Scramble the
        cube, and speedsolve it. Record the time. Then using the same scramble
        rescramble the cube and do the exact same solve on it, counting the
        moves. Then repeat that for 10-15 solves, then send them to me. I don't
        need the scrambles, just the time and move count. I am doing a
        statistics project, and have already looked at times, and haven't found
        that interesting, but I just had an idea for this, and if I could get
        these before 9 EST tonight that would be awesome. Craig Bouchard

        Hey everyone, So my stackmat is way messed up. Like, could possible be
        dead messed up. I wanted to hear if anyone had any suggestions for a
        hard reset that I had not thought of before I look into sending it back
        to speedstacks. I've already checked every website I can find and
        nothing has any good info. Here's what's happening: When I first turned
        it on, only the red LED would like up, and faintly at that. When I push
        the reset button (the one on the back of the timer) with a paper clip
        the LED will go out, but as soon as I let off it comes back on in the
        exact same way. None of the buttons work in this state. If however I
        push the reset button in the back and hold the power button and the
        reset button in the front while I let off of the one in the back the
        green and red LEDs alternate turning on while the number panel will
        display the same number (counting from 1 to 9) in every single spot and
        sort of go through what I can only describe as a routine of displaying
        certain things. In this case if I push the power button the timer will
        turn off, and if I push the reset button (the one on the front) it goes
        to the red LED case. All in all I don't think it's a good situation, but
        just in case there's anything I can do and advice would be IMMENSELY
        appreciated. I can't find my original intruction booklet, so sorry if I
        posted this when it was in there. Thanks for any help in advance. ~John
        H.~ P.S. It's definitely not the battery because I changed it a week
        ago.

        I think memorizing the cube in 20 seconds or less each time is very
        possible, if not quicker. Think about memo'ing a deck of cards in 30
        seconds, that is almost 2 cards each second. If you are using your
        method where you fix orientation and permutation at one time, that
        leaves you 20 pieces to memo. If you can do 1 piece a second, or
        quicker, that is a max of 20 seconds. Of course memo'ing a deck vs. a
        cube is different since you have to look around as you memo while a deck
        you just flip through. I believe that is a very possible avg memo time.

        One answer would be to add more cubes. So you'd have to solve, say, 1
        5x5x5, 2 4x4x4, 5 3x3x3 and 10 2x2x2. Finding and mixing 18 cubes for
        each competitor is probably a cure worse than the disease. And the best
        5x5x5 guy would win anyway, since he has to be good at all the smaller
        cubes to be good at the big one. On Jun 1, 2007, at 14:38, Bob Burton

        stackmat is way messed up. Like, could possible be dead messed up. I
        wanted to &gt; hear if anyone had any suggestions for a hard reset that
        I had not thought of before I look &gt; into sending it back to
        speedstacks. I've already checked every website I can find and &gt;
        nothing has any good info. &gt; &gt; Here's what's happening: &gt; When
        I first turned it on, only the red LED would like up, and faintly at
        that. When I push &gt; the reset button (the one on the back of the
        timer) with a paper clip the LED will go out, &gt; but as soon as I let
        off it comes back on in the exact same way. None of the buttons work
        &gt; in this state. &gt; &gt; If however I push the reset button in the
        back and hold the power button and the reset &gt; button in the front
        while I let off of the one in the back the green and red LEDs alternate
        &gt; turning on while the number panel will display the same number
        (counting from 1 to 9) in &gt; every single spot and sort of go through
        what I can only describe as a routine of displaying &gt; certain things.
        In this case if I push the power button the timer will turn off, and if
        I push &gt; the reset button (the one on the front) it goes to the red
        LED case. &gt; &gt; All in all I don't think it's a good situation, but
        just in case there's anything I can do and &gt; advice would be
        IMMENSELY appreciated. I can't find my original intruction booklet, so
        &gt; sorry if I posted this when it was in there. Thanks for any help in
        advance. &gt; &gt; ~John H.~ &gt; &gt; P.S. It's definitely not the

        the stickers on this paper for like 2-3 weeks before puting the stickers
        back on a new cube will they stick ok? if they dont what is the best

        29-30 moves for F2L are okay, 28 is the avarage number of moves, based
        on the fact that the avarage number of moves for each corner-edge pair
        is 7 moves(and 7x4=28, not 8x4...). You will be able to solve the F2L in
        28 moves on avarage if you learn the shortest algs for each F2L case.
        And for the fingertricks and regripping, a suggest trying,practising,
        and taking a look at speedcuber sites, f.e. cubewhiz.com(F2L algs
        explained in text) and solvethecube.co.uk(few F2L algs in video at the

        have to turn the cube that much...but that's just a little thing... Yes,
        I think of DF. I'm not entirely sure why I switched from FD. Anyway,
        this doesn't affect the turning *at all*, as it's just a different
        perspective on the exact same thing. &gt; the other one is that you say
        that the UF/FU alg is just U2 M' U2 M' and the DB/BD is M U2 M U2...but
        that's just when the centers are in their "correct" position...when
        they're an M2 away, you have to swap the algs...or did you find another
        way? With "target" I mean where you want it to go *before* applying the
        alg. And yes, that means when the centers are wrong, I just swap the
        algs. But if you memorize in pairs like I do, then you pretty much
        ignore it. Just memorize like you would with the centers not moving, and
        connect the pair-part-two item (an action for me) with the appropriate
        alg. Thanks for the questions, I might clarify that on my page when I
        have more time. Cheers! Stefan

        What is "buffer"? And from the "buffer" you 'shoot' your piece at the

        exactly like my old method, it's just faster. I use DF/UB as
        buffer/target, but you can also use FD/BU like I initially did. It's
        really just a different view on the same thing. If you want to read the
        setup moves from my page and use FD/BU then just flip all targets in my

        All of a sudden today, my rubiks.com 5x5x5 is popping every solve. My
        outer layer turns are a lot easier to make, since every face feels
        looser. Turns out my white side is _extremely_ loose; when I pull on the
        white side, about 20 pieces pop off. I'm thinking it's a core problem,
        and I was wondering if there is anything I could do about it (since it's
        just one face). I would order a new core from Cubesmith and be done with
        it, but with the US Open coming up, I'd like to get this fixed ASAP so
        that I can continue practicing (and have a cube for the event).

        So you look at the piece in the buffer area according to the stickers.
        And by the algs/set-up moves from your page execute them doing it piece

        What is "buffer"? And from the "buffer" you 'shoot' your piece at the
        'target' just like your old method right Stefan? Yes, it basically works
        exactly like my old method, it's just faster. I use DF/UB as
        buffer/target, but you can also use FD/BU like I initially did. It's
        really just a different view on the same thing. If you want to read the
        setup moves from my page and use FD/BU then just flip all targets in my
        setup moves list as well. Cheers! Stefan [Non-text portions of this

        Stefan, could you elaborate exactly what you mean? consider the cycle

        does this mean you remember FR-UL, RB-UF, etc? pairs like these? what do
        you do for memory when DF is already solved, etc? how do you know which

        The range of times for the top 20 single 2x2x2 speedsolves is less than
        2 seconds. The range of times for the top 20 single 3x3x3 speedsolves is
        less than 3 seconds. The range of times for the top 20 single 4x4x4
        speedsolves is about 10 seconds. Notwithstanding the fact that your
        suggestion involves a LOT of solves (about 5 minutes worth, assuming
        world record speed and little transition time, not to mention about 15
        seconds worth of inspection PER cube), the range of time you hope to add
        by including 1 more 4x4x4 solve, 4 more 3x3x3 solves, and 9 more 2x2x2
        solves is about 40 seconds. Comparing this to the range of 5x5x5 solves,
        this is equal to the range of times for the first 40 single 5x5x5
        speedsolves (roughly). So what does this mean? Well, even if you can
        achieve world record speed for the 2x2x2, 3x3x3, and 4x4x4 (note this
        means world record speed for EACH 2x2x2-4x4x4, and there are 17 of them
        in the case Lars gave), a 5x5x5 solve that is about 40 seconds faster
        (which is conceivable) will nearly guarantee you a win. The problem with
        multiple cubes lies not only in finding and scrambling them all, but the
        weight of the 5x5x5 solve should not be equal to the other cube solve
        times. If you were, however, to weight the times differently (by some
        sort of scoring system per different cube type, e.g.), doing one of each
        cube may be sufficient. Thus, for example, a 1 second difference in the
        2x2x2 solve could equate to a 2 second difference in the 3x3x3, which
        could be equal to a 5 second difference in the 4x4x4, or a 10 second
        difference in the 5x5x5. The numbers, of course, would have to be very
        fastidiously chosen, for fears of placing too much weight on the 2x2x2
        solve, etc.. --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, Lars Petrus

        2x2x2. &gt; &gt; Finding and mixing 18 cubes for each competitor is

        &gt; how I can improve the technology to make this bit actually useful.
        When I started using the net through usenet in 1994 most groups had an
        FAQ. This FAQ was posted either monthly or bi-weekly to the group. This
        way newbies who just started reading the group would find the FAQ right
        away. Suggestions for the FAQ were then moderated by the group owner. I
        always thought that was a great solution. For you to implement this you
        just have to post the FAQ from the Oracle to the group, or maybe make a
        selection of the most frequently asked questions. Then at the bottom
        provide a link to 'add your own question'. My $2 (inflation) Michiel

        Altough I understand your point but I can't figure out where you these
        numbers from: &gt; The range of times for the top 20 single 2x2x2

        I doubt anyone can finish a 4x4 in 10 seconds or a 3x3 in 3 seconds. You
        have to somehow normalize the distribution of 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5
        times, and sum up each time of the competitor normalized. I think that
        is not possible to do such normalizations for the number of samples we
        have in the official database but let's assume we can. If x -&gt; f2(x)
        is the transformation that normalizes the 2x2 distribution (same with
        f3, f4, and f5) then the final time of the competitor would be f2(x2) +
        f3(x3) + f4(x4) + f5(x5). Sven

        since UB/BU and DF/FD are on opposite sides of the cube (ie. an M2
        away), the algs for solving UB/BU are the same regardless of where you
        encounter it in the cycle. however, if you are memorizing in pairs, like
        piece1-piece2, then if piece2 is a UF/FU, then you use the DB/BD
        algorithm, or if piece2 is a DB/BD piece, then you use the UF/FU
        algorithm (because after piece1 was solved, you have an M2 to undo, and
        whatever was in UF/FU is now in DB/BD and vice-versa) In short i think
        you only need to swap for UF/FU and DB/BD if it's being performed during
        an M2-is-currently-out-of-place situation --- In

        his method works like a commutator. you need to get the target piece

        &gt; 2 seconds. The range of times for the top 20 single 3x3x3

        I doubt anyone can finish a 4x4 in 10 seconds or a 3x3 in 3 seconds. No,
        no one to my knowledge can solve a 3x3 in 3 seconds. The range refers to
        the positive difference between two cubers, in this case #20 and #1. I
        was merely trying to point out the difference in variation between times
        for 2x2-4x4 and the 5x5. &gt; You have to somehow normalize the
        distribution of 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5 times, and sum &gt; up each time
        of the competitor normalized. I think that is not possible to do such
        &gt; normalizations for the number of samples we have in the official
        database but let's assume &gt; we can. If x -&gt; f2(x) is the
        transformation that normalizes the 2x2 distribution (same with f3, &gt;
        f4, and f5) then the final time of the competitor would be f2(x2) +
        f3(x3) + f4(x4) + f5(x5). &gt; &gt; Sven Yes, this is what I was
        alluding to in my post, and there are many ways this can be
        accomplished, IMO. However, it would have to be clear that the resulting
        value of f2(x2) + f3(x3) + f4(x4) + f5(x5) is not a time but a score.

        UF and DB. Also, DF isn't really ever solved at all, at least not
        directly, as it's the buffer edge and gets solved by solving all other
        edges. And UB always belongs at UB. &gt; however, if you are memorizing
        in pairs, &gt; like piece1-piece2, then if piece2 is a UF/FU, then you
        use the DB/ BD &gt; algorithm, or if piece2 is a DB/BD piece, then you
        use the UF/FU &gt; algorithm (because after piece1 was solved, you have
        an M2 to undo, &gt; and whatever was in UF/FU is now in DB/BD and
        vice-versa) &gt; &gt; In short i think you only need to swap for UF/FU
        and DB/BD if it's &gt; being performed during an

        I know this is confusing at first, it can be completely hidden by an

        I do have a question though about its speed If there is a step at the
        end for orienting edges, then this is not much further off from the EO
        phase of EO/EP solving in terms of time spent in execution. Which means
        it becomes a matter of comparing EP to M2 method, which uses a short alg
        per edge plus an alg for starting a new cycle. is this going to
        ultimately be faster than EP which solves 2 edges at a time and needs
        the EO anyway? --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com, "Stefan

        algorithms be for the edge cases BU, FU, BD, &gt; &gt; etc? &gt; &gt;
        Basically of course the same effect, only the piece at DF before the
        &gt; alg and the piece at DF after the alg need an extra flip. You can
        see &gt; some possible algs in Erik's tutorial: &gt; &gt;
        http://erikku.er.funpic.org/rubik/M2.html &gt; &gt; &gt; so for edge
        cycles, we need a swapping alg for every NEW cycle to &gt; get &gt; &gt;
        some new cycle-starter into the DF spot? &gt; &gt; Yes. And preferably
        break into the new cycle at UB, UF or DB, which &gt; have the fastest
        algs. That actually saves time twice, as at the end &gt; of the cycle
        you'll close it with the same fast alg. Unless the cycle &gt; contains
        an overall flip and you insist on solving BU/FU/BD with &gt; correct
        orientation right away. &gt; &gt; If you want to do that, you could use
        Joel van Noort's idea: break &gt; into a cycle right where one of the
        pieces UB/UF/DB is located, so &gt; the next alg *after* breaking into
        the cycle is fast and avoids the &gt; lengthy flipping M-slice alg. &gt;
        &gt; &gt; what happens in the case of parity? &gt; &gt; After "solving"
        edges and corners, apply the parity alg: &gt; (r2' U' r2) (R' U) (L'
        U2') (R U' R' U2 R) (L U') (r2' U) &gt; &gt; &gt; also, for the
        "unsolved edge orientation" cases you refer &gt; to, &gt; &gt; do these
        only refer to pieces correctly permuted but not oriented &gt; from &gt;
        &gt; the getgo? &gt; &gt; Basically, yes. But also possibly some M-slice
        edges which I've &gt; "solved" with the wrong orientation. I very much
        like the case where &gt; one L or R slice edge was flipped from the
        getgo, and I saved time &gt; with M-slice algs leaving three M-slice
        edges flipped. Then with &gt; trivial setup, (M'U)*4 does the whole
        orientation (this btw is the &gt; case I prefer to point out when trying
        to explain why flipped M-slice &gt; edges isn't that bad at all). &gt;

        Kai is right. The new minx is useable, although you wouldn't want use it
        for much beyond learning. I bought one to try it and the first one broke
        10 minutes out of the box. They sent me a new one and the centers on
        that one slowly unscrewed themselves after counterclockwise face
        rotations. If you're learning the minx then buy this one first; it
        shoulg last long enough. Plus, your options are strictly limited at the
        moment: As you know Mefferts has no megaminxs in stock. Uwe says to me

        the past few months; expensive though (Stefan sold one mint for a
        killing, but the rest hover around 60-70 USD). Keep your eyes open to
        markets like eBay, wait until "the end of the year" for Mefferts to
        rerelease them, or try to make due with the newer version. On 6/7/07,

        Does &gt; &gt; anybody know when they'll be available again? I have such
        a "new &gt; &gt; version" megaminx from cube for you and after sanding
        each piece it &gt; &gt; has turned out pretty okay. Even Stefan said
        that they are not THAT &gt; &gt; bad, after he tried mine. Well okay, he
        popped it multiple times but &gt; &gt; that doesn't happen to me :P &gt;
        &gt; So all in all the cube4you Minx is okay for a very very very low
        &gt; &gt; price. I would recomend you to try it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

        alright. Those edges are just very sharp and catch a lot, causing pops.

        to be able to write an article about the US Open and mention someone

        42.89 was the last average of ten I had...been cubing since late March
        2007 (just under three months ago)...trying to learn the OLL's....I know
        all but 18, but they are not all in the subconsciousness yet. PLL's I
        have learned pretty well...about 5 seconds for looking and performing
        the algorithm on average.

        The rubiks.has.it forum gets about 5-10 spammers register a day. That is
        why it is manual review registration now. I usually check the email to
        verfiy... and always give the benefit of the doubt as to whether it is a
        spammer or not. I plan on upgrading the forum to vBulletin soon and
        moving it to my own server, and possibly expanding to multiple
        languages, adding tons of features, getting a real domain, etc. For
        those of you who prefer posting/reading through email, hopefully vB will
        come out with the option of that soon, if not, we may be able to work
        around that (Ryan Heise, if you any ideas, please email me). And by the
        way, none of the posts would be lost if this occured... the only problem
        I could see if transfering the passwords since the encryption process
        may be different for the upgraded software. If anyone has any comments
        or suggestions, please let me know. On 5/28/07, Stefan Pochmann

        &gt; I am horrible at centers+edges and avg around 50 seconds for them.
        36 sec &gt; avg. is quite impressive. Do you guys have any tips to move
        from 50 seconds &gt; to sub-40 seconds avg for centers+edges? Thanks
        Well, there's the obvious, work on lookahead and don't move too fast.
        You'll need to move the cube around a lot, but that's normal. Try to
        remember where things are if you think it will help. Also, you want to
        be as efficient as possible without losing speed. Try to be
        color-neutral on the centers, and learn to take advantage of blocks if
        you haven't already. On the edges, you can usually (3/4 of the time) get
        an edge into the place you want with exactly three moves, so again work
        towards optimizing this, and making as few actual moves as you can
        (again, without losing too much time). Try finding your first pair of
        edges near the end of the centers step so you don't slow down there, and
        try finding some of the cross while doing the last few edges. I don't
        know how you get to sub-40 c+e, but I'm at 40-45 second average.

        recommend it. Has anyone else had this problem? I have &gt; seen &gt;

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What would the longer algorithms be for
        the edge cases BU, FU, BD, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; Basically of course the same effect, only the piece at DF
        before the &gt; &gt; &gt; alg and the piece at DF after the alg need an
        extra flip. You can see &gt; &gt; &gt; some possible algs in Erik's
        tutorial: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        http://erikku.er.funpic.org/rubik/M2.html &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; so for edge cycles, we need a swapping alg for every NEW cycle to
        &gt; &gt; &gt; get &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some new cycle-starter into the
        DF spot? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. And preferably break into
        the new cycle at UB, UF or DB, which &gt; &gt; &gt; have the fastest
        algs. That actually saves time twice, as at the end &gt; &gt; &gt; of
        the cycle you'll close it with the same fast alg. Unless the cycle &gt;
        &gt; &gt; contains an overall flip and you insist on solving BU/FU/BD
        with &gt; &gt; &gt; correct orientation right away. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; If you want to do that, you could use Joel van Noort's idea:
        break &gt; &gt; &gt; into a cycle right where one of the pieces UB/UF/DB
        is located, so &gt; &gt; &gt; the next alg *after* breaking into the
        cycle is fast and avoids the &gt; &gt; &gt; lengthy flipping M-slice
        alg. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what happens in the case of
        parity? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After "solving" edges and corners,
        apply the parity alg: &gt; &gt; &gt; (r2' U' r2) (R' U) (L' U2') (R U'
        R' U2 R) (L U') (r2' U) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also, for the
        "unsolved edge orientation" cases you refer &gt; &gt; &gt; to, &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; do these only refer to pieces correctly permuted but not
        oriented &gt; &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the getgo? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically, yes. But also possibly some M-slice edges
        which I've &gt; &gt; &gt; "solved" with the wrong orientation. I very
        much like the case where &gt; &gt; &gt; one L or R slice edge was
        flipped from the getgo, and I saved time &gt; &gt; &gt; with M-slice
        algs leaving three M-slice edges flipped. Then with &gt; &gt; &gt;
        trivial setup, (M'U)*4 does the whole orientation (this btw is the &gt;
        &gt; &gt; case I prefer to point out when trying to explain why flipped
        M- slice &gt; &gt; &gt; edges isn't that bad at all). &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Making Windows XP Start 60% Faster Whenever you start your computer, you
        are faced with a few moments of thumb twiddling while Windows XP boots
        and prompts you to log on. Although you should expect to wait for a few
        moments, sometimes Windows XP seems to boot rather slowly. In fact, you
        may notice that over a period of time the PC that used to roar to life
        seems a bit sluggish instead. Fortunately, you can perform several
        techniques that help Windows XP get the bootup speed you want. This
        chapter explores how to put these techniques to work. Read all tips here

        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What would the longer algorithms be for the edge
        cases BU, &gt; FU, BD, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically of course the same effect, only the piece
        at DF &gt; before the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alg and the piece at DF after
        the alg need an extra flip. You &gt; can see &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some
        possible algs in Erik's tutorial: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; http://erikku.er.funpic.org/rubik/M2.html &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so for edge cycles, we need a swapping alg for every
        NEW &gt; cycle to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some
        new cycle-starter into the DF spot? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; Yes. And preferably break into the new cycle at UB, UF or DB, &gt;
        which &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have the fastest algs. That actually saves
        time twice, as at &gt; the end &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the cycle you'll
        close it with the same fast alg. Unless the &gt; cycle &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; contains an overall flip and you insist on solving BU/FU/BD &gt;
        with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct orientation right away. &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you want to do that, you could use Joel van
        Noort's idea: &gt; break &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into a cycle right where
        one of the pieces UB/UF/DB is located, &gt; so &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
        next alg *after* breaking into the cycle is fast and avoids &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lengthy flipping M-slice alg. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what happens in the case of parity? &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After "solving" edges and corners, apply
        the parity alg: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (r2' U' r2) (R' U) (L' U2') (R U' R'
        U2 R) (L U') (r2' U) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also,
        for the "unsolved edge orientation" cases you refer &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        to, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do these only refer to pieces correctly
        permuted but not &gt; oriented &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from &gt; &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; the getgo? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically,
        yes. But also possibly some M-slice edges which I've &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        "solved" with the wrong orientation. I very much like the case &gt;
        where &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one L or R slice edge was flipped from the
        getgo, and I saved &gt; time &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with M-slice algs
        leaving three M-slice edges flipped. Then &gt; with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
        trivial setup, (M'U)*4 does the whole orientation (this btw is &gt; the
        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case I prefer to point out when trying to explain
        why flipped M- &gt; slice &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; edges isn't that bad at
        all). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers! &gt; &gt; &gt;

        Hey DanH and Everyone, You're welcome. You can find links to all the

        some cube info back up on the web. I wish I could come to the 2007 World

        Say you have the scramble U L2 B' &gt; R2 U' L2 F2 L2 U' R2 B' L2 U'.
        This leaves two cycles of three pieces &gt; each. After the first cycle

        Hi everyone, I would like to announce a new online competition for
        linear fewest-moves solving which will be run from the following site:
        http://www.ryanheise.com/competitions/ Linear FMC has the following
        basic rules: - 1 hour to solve. - No taking back moves (different from
        regular FMC) In this event, you are given only one chance to solve the
        cube and therefore must rely heavily on your ability to "look ahead".
        Although the time limit is 1 hour, I expect that most people will not
        use this much time. The competition will be run in rounds of 12 weeks,
        where a different scramble is given each week. A winner will be declared
        for each week as well as an overall champion with the highest ranking
        after 12 weeks. This competition's goal is to exercise look-ahead
        abilities and thinking speed for fewest moves solving, and to develop
        skills that can eventually be transferred over to speed cubing. Please
        contact me if you have questions about the format or the submission
        system. And finally, good luck to those who will participate :-) -- Ryan

        The screw only keeps the central axle together. You don't need to worry
        about that if you're just taking the pieces out. Turn a face 45 degrees,
        then lift up one of the edge pieces of the rotated face. Depending on
        how tight your cube is, it may take a little force to get the piece out
        (if necessary, find a key or screwdriver that's not too sharp and use it
        to pry it out. Don't force it too hard or you might break something).
        Once the first piece is out the rest of the cube will practically
        disassemble itself. Shelley --- In

        I am obviously going to say that this does not include a ridiculously
        lucky case. The limits will be pushed, but I don't think they will go
        past 8 seconds on a non-lucky (or too easy) solve. With the use of
        additional algorithms, they will take slightly longer to recognize, and
        although they will do more at once, they may be slightly longer... Craig

        Hi Craig, I'm interested to find out on what this prediction is based.
        You might remember I did a similar statistical effort, for a bit of fun,
        to predict the limits for an nxnxn cube, but everything hinged on my
        forecast (which proved to be way wrong), that 13.22 seconds would not be
        beaten as an average of 5 in competition. Could you post some details
        about your method? Cheers, DanH --- In

        7!*3^6*(24!)^12/24^54-1 I'm kind of curious if there is a pattern as to

        Hi Chris :) What on earth do you mean by unsolved configurations? Surely
        it cannot mean unsolvable configurations nor "not-yet-encountered
        configuration". So what do you mean by that? Is it simply possible
        configurations - 1 ?? Surely, some fairly simple algorithm will be able
        to determine this for arbitrary sized cubes? (Using "array integer
        multiplication" to keep all digits.) -Per &gt; --- In

        Hey Per, By that I mean the number of possible, legal, positions for
        that cube size minus the solved state. I also just found that the number
        of unsolved configurations to an 11x11x11 cube is also a prime number
        ;-) I have to admit I have no idea what array integer multiplication is
        ;-) But if it would work to solve this problem I'd be interested in
        learning about it. Chris --- In speedsolvingrubikscube@yahoogroups.com,

        I had only tested up to the 39x39x39 cube because I had to leave for
        work. I just tested the super-supercubes up to 21x21x21 and none of them
        are prime. I can't test any higher than that because the factor program
        I am using can't handle numbers over 10,000 digits long, which happens
        for the 22x22x22. Chris

        Hi :-) Well, basically you hold each digit of an integer in each index
        of an array. Simply using the integer or longint datatypes found in most
        computer languages you will soon find that with large integers they are
        represented in the form a*10^b kind of thing and the numbers are not
        accurately represented anymore. With arays (or lists or similar) one can
        represent in principal arbitrary long integers with a full valid
        representation. I once calculated large factorials like this with Turbo
        Pascal. Addition, multiplication and subtraction with these arays is
        straight forward: the good old blackboard kind of thing from primary
        school. Combine all this with some simple prime factor search and you
        are done. You can find out if size(nxnxn cube group)-1 is prime for
        arbitrary big n ;-) -Per &gt; --- In

        factoring is fast, but it's a lot easier to test for primality than to
        factor, you know (just ask a cryptologist). And even pseudoprime tests
        (for elimination) to base 2 with Mathematica's really efficient PowerMod
        command are slowing rapidly at n=30... But by trial division and some
        other fast tests, Mathematica eliminates most numbers in a few seconds,
        often &lt;1 second. 55, 62, 64, 67, 74, 78, 80, 86, 87, 92, 95, 98 are
        the only suspects it left below 100, not eliminated by PrimeQ in ten
        seconds (I already tested up to 54). So it seems to me that primes are
        extremely rare. Unfortunately, the number of states-1 are not exactly
        the nicest numbers to analyze, since they get large so quickly and there
        are no Lucas-like checks (alluding to Mersenne &amp; GIMPS here, not

        A while ago, Shotaro Makisumi came up with a nice idea for last slot:
        http://cubefreak.net/f2lc_llco.html Instead of solving all four F2L
        slots, then orienting all LL pieces, and then permuting them, the method
        substitutes: - 3 F2L slots - ELS: place the edge of the last slot (LS)
        and orient LL edges - CLS: place the LS corner and orient LL corners -
        PLL I found all the algs for it, and adopted it as a speedcubing method.
        Because I never thought of a good descriptive name for it (F2Lc+LLCO is
        not exactly easy to rattle off), I eventually got to calling it MGLS,
        for Makisumi-Garron Last Slot. (If ZB and VH, why not MG?) The pages
        with the description, algs, etc. are here: http://cube.garron.us/MGLS/ I
        find it a very nice method; I can average sub-20 with it. In terms of
        moves and algs, it's a teeny bit shorter than Fridrich, with a bit more
        algs (104 for CLS: 56+reflections), but very comparable. Unfortunately,
        I can't tell about it at the US Open (because we had to cancel our
        vacation last-second), so I guess it'll be just online announcement :-)
        I'm eager for any comments or suggestions (or criticism) -and please
        tell me if the pages aren't working on your computer, or if you find a
        mistake. I do know that the applets tend to cause trouble, most often by
        using too many resources, so if you know it's just that, don't worry:
        that I'll make an image-only page soon. I hope people like the idea, and
        actually use it; after all, the more users, the more people make it a
        better method. Sincerely, -Lucas Garron [Non-text portions of this

        Hi :-) The main problem here is that the checking has to be be done with
        a non-standard data type. Integer or longint wont hold such big numbers
        with all digits represented. The array/list implemementation may not be
        the most effective but it's simple and works nicely. Practically one
        could decide the array-size beforehand to avoid having to expand them
        dynamically which is slow :-) So the main problem is the data structure
        not the prime search in itself :-) -Per &gt; --- In

        it just &gt; find probable primes? I have worked with Mathematica some,
        but not &gt; with the prime functions. &gt;From the implementation notes
        in Mathematica's help: "PrimeQ first tests for divisibility using small
        primes, then uses the Miller-Rabin strong pseudoprime test base 2 and
        base 3, and then uses a Lucas test." But somewhere it hides: "As of
        1997, this procedure is known to be correct only for n&lt;10^16, and it
        is conceivable that for larger n it could claim a composite number to be
        prime. But not the other way (I think). If it returns false, the number
        has been proven composite, either with a factor or some pseudoprime
        test. That's, as far as I can tell, how it tells me in 0.071 seconds
        that Cu[100]-1, a 38415-digit number, is not prime. And Cu[1000]-1
        (3874242 digits) in 14 seconds. Anything else would even be torturously
        slower. (Note that in cryptology, where important secrets rely on
        primality and factorability, they're talking about only hundreds of
        digits...) Mathematica declares a lot of numbers composite in less than
        ten seconds, and has given me no other primes than 3, 8, and 11 (well,
        the corresponding states-1). Only 36 numbers before 200 don't make it,
        and I've even eliminated the first four before: 31, 39, 48, 52, 55, 62,
        64, 67, 74, 78, 80, 86, 87, 92, 95, 98, 110, 114, 118, 123, 130, 132,
        144, 150, 152, 158, 163, 164, 166, 167, 170, 177, 184, 192, 195, 198 It
        will be computationally taxing to prove any of these prime. It'd be
        better to bet on them being composite and see which don't pass other
        tests. Actually, I did try base 2 pseudoprime tests, and abandoned them;
        on analysis, checking time is O[1.2^n]. n =100 would take about 7 days.
        And that's efficient, in a sense. The numbers just grow so quickly (even
        the number of digits in them grows faster than linear) that almost any
        constructive approach is useless, except by specific theory. I think
        Mathematica's "False" return on most numbers is reliable, and sometime
        I'll sieve even farther. &gt; Also what is the maximum size large number
        &gt; it can work with, how many digits? It can work with millions of
        digits; the actual max depends on the system $MaxNumber for my laptop is
        about 2*10^646456887 . So, for me: more than half a billion digits By
        the way, I'm relying on Hardwick's formulas: Cu[n]=((24*2^10*12!)^Mod[n,
        2]*7!*3^6*24!^Floor[(n^2 - 2*n)/4])/4!^(6*Floor[(n - 2)^2/4]) and Su[n]=
        [((24*2^21*12!)^Mod[n, 2]*7!*3^6*24!^Floor[(n^2 - 2*n)/4])/2^Floor[(n -
        2)^2/4] They're correct, right? Is 7548.5*n^2 a good enough
        approximation to Cu[n]? Also, I checked a lot of supercubes and tried
        +1, just for fun, and they look hopeless. + or - anything other than 1
        is also definitely composite, guaranteed up to 29^2=841. And I got silly
        and tested, base ten, the sum of the digits and the number of digits for
        primality - there are none prime up to 150 or so for the former, and a
        few for the latter (n= 19, 37, 41, 72...) This is getting to long...
        Basically, I'm just guessing that primes will be really rare, and
        probably about as rare as regular primes. So that'd give about a
        probability of primality of 1 in 9n^2 (actually, closer to
        n^2*Log[24!/(4!^6)]/4) to Cu[n]. That means that the chances around
        n=1000 are about 1 in 10^7. I'm not sure that I'm manipulating infinite
        products correctly, but under the assumption that these numbers are as
        likely to be prime as any other of their size, I find that the
        probability that &gt;any&lt; number above n=11 yields a prime is less
        than 1% In fact, the probability that any of these numbers&gt;1 is a
        prime at all is about 7%, and the fact that there are three such numbers
        doesn't change that. It just suggests that the assumptions may not be
        warranted. (Again, I'm not so sure about the rigor of this, but taking
        in to account that knowing the numbers are not divisible by any prime up
        to 23 can possibly change these to 6% and 37%). I wasn't too formal, but
        at least I convinced myself :-) At least the probability that there is a
        prime does NOT go to 100% as n goes to infinity, though its limit is a
        bit of a matter of definition. My point: I don't expect to see another
        Scrambled Rubik's Constant Prime. Hope I didn't confuse anyone too much.

        On speedcubing.com, the results of an unofficial competition in Hungary
        are linked. I know that this all is off course unofficial but it's
        interesting to see that,if it was an official competition, 3 world
        records would have been broken. Matyas Kuti: 1.03.xx blindsolve. 0.91
        seconds magic average, Milan Baltitz: 3.9x seconds average 2x2x2. I
        think we can expect lots of records at the WC in Boedapest. That is if
        they all perform like this weekend off course.

        &gt; I think it will help out with the &gt; bad F2L cases where the edge

        to use it on previous slots to make the last one easier, but that would
        often take longer, I think. As for the vice-versa, I call that Mini-ZB:

        I would only do it for the last F2L but I really would like to see how
        it will affect my times. I would probably learn the cases where the edge
        is in flipped correctly corner flipped a certain way from there and do
        corner flipped correctly edge flipped a certain way, etc. I will have
        what I hope time to learn at least a good amount of cases in the next

        Did you lubricate it? If you did, sanding the insides of the cube would
        help. Also if you have a DIY, you can adjust the spring tension. If you

        Hi :-) I suppose bigint is actually an array/list implementation like i

        effective, what i did was give each sticker a number, so 1-24 on edges,
        and 1-24 on corners, and just do it like that, does anyone using that

        Well, I'm bored to death with summer, so I'll help you, even though
        other people are more pro than me. The best speedcubes are DIY
        (Do-it-yourself) cubes from various sites, such as cube4you. NEVER BUY
        FROM RUBIKS.COM unless you want to pay for the outrageous shipping
        rates. The cubes from Toys R Us are very bad for speedcubing, from my
        experience. You can buy Hungarian studio cubes from ebay, and people say
        they are very good (I personally haven't tried it yet). You can also
        lubricate the insides of your cube buy taking it apart, cleaning the
        dust, spraying each piece with silicon spray, then putting it back
        together. I can't think of anything else to say... Brian pplpeople8

        i'm not really a pro either, but it sounds like you need some
        lubricating. like other said silicon works best (make sure you clean the
        pieces first). do NOT use a petroleum based lubricant as it will wear
        faster and get sticky and messy. as far as cubes go, DIY's are best (in
        my opinion) because you get to put it together and spring tension is
        adjustable. If you dont want to spend that money, i would at least make
        sure you have an official Rubik's brand cube (it will have the Rubik's
        logo on the middle white sticker). --- In

        i'm not really a pro either, but it sounds like you need some
        lubricating. like other said silicon works best (make sure you clean the
        pieces first). do NOT use a petroleum based lubricant as it will wear
        faster and get sticky and messy. as far as cubes go, DIY's are best (in
        my opinion) because you get to put it together and spring tension is
        adjustable. If you dont want to spend that money, i would at least make
        sure you have an official Rubik's brand cube (it will have the Rubik's
        logo on the middle white sticker). --- In speedsolvingrubiksc

        &gt; &gt; &gt; The atmosphere for the final round of 3x3 speedsolve was
        &gt; &gt; &gt; nerve-wracking. Competitors went up on the stage one at a
        time and &gt; &gt; &gt; the audience was near silent for each solve.

        had received on his final solves. I got one good time, but not on 3x3.

        On a simular note, I (Arnaud van Galen) have lost both my Rubiks timer
        (not a speedstacking timer, but one of those black boxes) and a new
        Rubiks World (2x2x2). If someone found them, please let me know. -----

        and let me know. It says Bob Burton's Cubewhiz.com on the white logo
